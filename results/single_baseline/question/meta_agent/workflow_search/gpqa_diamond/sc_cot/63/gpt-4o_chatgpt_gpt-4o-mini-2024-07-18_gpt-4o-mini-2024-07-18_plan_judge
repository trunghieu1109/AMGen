Question: Example(question='An equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 g was heated to 200°C without air. In this case, only a mixture of gases was formed, which, without cooling, was passed successively through tubes filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 (№1), Ca(OH)2 (№2) solution, and red-hot copper (№3). Results: the weights of tubes №1 and №3 increased by 3.60 g and 0.80 g, respectively (CuO formed in tube №3). The weight of the second tube has not changed. As a result, only 2.24 liters of gas C (standard temperature and pressure) remained.\nIndicate the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.', choice1='15', choice2='13', choice3='17', choice4='19', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: To find the total number of atoms in salts A and B, we need to analyze the information given. We have an equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B, weighing 7.20 g. The gases formed were passed through different tubes, with specific weight changes indicating the types of gases present. The increase in weight of tube №1 suggests the absorption of water vapor or another gas that reacts with Mg(ClO4)2, while the increase in tube №3 indicates the formation of CuO from a gas that likely contained oxygen. The fact that tube №2 did not change in weight suggests that the gas did not react with Ca(OH)2, indicating it was likely a neutral gas like nitrogen or a noble gas. The remaining gas volume of 2.24 liters at standard temperature and pressure (STP) suggests we have a certain amount of gas left over after reactions. However, to find the number of atoms in salts A and B, we need to consider their molecular formulas. Assuming common salts, we can estimate the number of atoms based on typical compounds. For example, if A is NaCl (2 atoms) and B is KCl (2 atoms), the total would be 4 atoms. Without specific formulas for A and B, the answer is not straightforward. However, given the choices and typical compounds, we can infer that the total number of atoms could be 15, 13, 17, or 19. The most plausible total based on common salts and their molecular compositions is likely 15. Therefore, the answer is 15.
