    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;An equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 g was heated to 200°C without air. In this case, only a mixture of gases was formed, which, without cooling, was passed successively through tubes filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 (№1), Ca(OH)2 (№2) solution, and red-hot copper (№3). Results: the weights of tubes №1 and №3 increased by 3.60 g and 0.80 g, respectively (CuO formed in tube №3). The weight of the second tube has not changed. As a result, only 2.24 liters of gas C (standard temperature and pressure) remained.\nIndicate the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;15&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;13&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;17&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;19&#39;}

    <pre>The problem involves an equimolar mixture of salts A and B, which upon heating, decomposes to form gases. The gases are passed through three tubes: Tube #1 with Mg(ClO4)2 absorbs water, increasing by 3.60 g, indicating 0.20 moles of water (since molar mass of water is 18 g/mol). Tube #2 with Ca(OH)2 shows no change, indicating no CO2 is absorbed. Tube #3 with red-hot copper increases by 0.80 g due to the formation of CuO, indicating 0.01 moles of oxygen (since molar mass of O is 16 g/mol, and CuO is 80 g/mol, so 0.80 g increase corresponds to 0.01 moles of O2 reacted with Cu to form CuO). The remaining gas C is 2.24 liters at STP, corresponding to 0.10 moles (since 1 mole of gas at STP occupies 22.4 liters). The gases formed are likely H2O, O2, and possibly H2 or O2. Since no CO2 is absorbed, it suggests the gases are H2O and O2. Given the increase in mass of tubes and the volume of gas C, the gases are likely H2O, O2, and H2. The equimolar mixture decomposed to give 0.10 moles of gas, with 0.20 moles of H2O, 0.01 moles of O2, and 0.10 moles of H2. The total number of atoms in salts A and B can be deduced from the stoichiometry and the fact that the gases formed are H2O, O2, and potentially H2. The total number of atoms considering the decomposition and the gases produced is 17.
