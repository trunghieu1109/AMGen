    <pre>We have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 g. When heated, they form gases that are passed through three tubes. The first tube with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 increases by 3.60 g, indicating it absorbed water vapor, so 3.60 g of water was formed. The second tube with Ca(OH)2 shows no change, indicating no CO2 was absorbed, so no CO2 was formed. The third tube with red-hot copper increases by 0.80 g due to the formation of CuO, indicating 0.80 g of oxygen was absorbed. The remaining gas C has a volume of 2.24 liters at STP, which corresponds to 0.10 moles (since 1 mole of gas at STP occupies 22.4 liters). Therefore, gas C is likely a diatomic gas like H2, O2, or N2. Since the weight of the second tube did not change, no CO2 or SO2 was formed, so gas C is likely N2. The total mass of gases formed is 3.60 g (H2O) + 0.80 g (O2) = 4.40 g, and the remaining mass must be N2. The moles of N2 are 0.10 moles, which is 2.80 g. The total mass of gases is 4.40 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g, which matches the initial mass of the salts. Since the mixture is equimolar and forms N2, A and B are likely ammonium salts. Since the total number of atoms in the salts is requested, we need to consider the composition of these salts. The ammonium ion is NH4+ and is likely paired with an anion that decomposes to give the observed products. The simplest candidates are NH4Cl and NH4NO3, which would give H2O, N2, and O2 upon decomposition. NH4Cl gives H2O and N2, while NH4NO3 gives N2, H2O, and O2. The total number of atoms in NH4Cl and NH4NO3 is 5 (NH4) + 1 (Cl) = 6 and 5 (NH4) + 1 (N) + 3 (O) = 9, respectively. Therefore, the total number of atoms in the mixture is 6 + 9 = 15.
