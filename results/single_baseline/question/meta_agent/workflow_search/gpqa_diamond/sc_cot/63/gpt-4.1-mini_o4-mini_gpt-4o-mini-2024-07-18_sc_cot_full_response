Question: {'question': 'An equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 g was heated to 200°C without air. In this case, only a mixture of gases was formed, which, without cooling, was passed successively through tubes filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 (№1), Ca(OH)2 (№2) solution, and red-hot copper (№3). Results: the weights of tubes №1 and №3 increased by 3.60 g and 0.80 g, respectively (CuO formed in tube №3). The weight of the second tube has not changed. As a result, only 2.24 liters of gas C (standard temperature and pressure) remained.\nIndicate the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.', 'choice1': '15', 'choice2': '13', 'choice3': '17', 'choice4': '19'}\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent ctX7', content='We have an equimolar mixture of two salts A and B (n mol each) weighing 7.20 g. Upon heating, only a gas mixture forms. Passing the hot gases through tube 1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2) absorbs water: Δm₁=3.60 g ⇒ nᵂ(H₂O)=3.60/18=0.20 mol. Tube 2 (Ca(OH)2 solution) shows no mass change ⇒ no CO₂ or acidic gases. Tube 3 (red-hot Cu) forms CuO and gains 0.80 g ⇒ O₂ consumed: Δm=0.80 g; 2Cu+O₂→2CuO gives 32 g CuO–Cu mass per O₂, so nᵂ(O₂)=0.80/32=0.025 mol. Remaining gas C (after trapping H₂O and O₂) is 2.24 L at STP ⇒ n=2.24/22.4=0.10 mol of N₂. Check mass: H₂O 3.6 g+O₂ 0.80 g+N₂(0.10×28)=2.8 g totals 7.20 g OK. Let A and B each be n=0.05 mol. A candidate for producing only N₂ and H₂O is ammonium nitrite: NH₄NO₂→N₂+2H₂O. B that yields H₂O plus N₂O which on hot Cu decomposes to N₂+½O₂ is ammonium nitrate: NH₄NO₃→N₂O+2H₂O; 2 N₂O→2 N₂+O₂. Per 0.05 mol each: H₂O:0.05×2+0.05×2=0.20 mol; N₂:0.05×1+0.05×1=0.10 mol; O₂:0.05×0.5=0.025 mol. Mass:0.05×(64+80)=7.2 g matches. Thus A=NH₄NO₂ has 2 N+4 H+2 O=8 atoms; B=NH₄NO₃ has 2 N+4 H+3 O=9 atoms. Total atoms=8+9=17.\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
