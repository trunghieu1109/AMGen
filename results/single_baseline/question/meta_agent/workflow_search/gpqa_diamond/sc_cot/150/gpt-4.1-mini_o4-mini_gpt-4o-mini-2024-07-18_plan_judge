Question: Example(question='The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1). An observable of the system is represented by the matrix operator P having elements in the first row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0),  in the second row as (1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}) and in the third row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0). Calculate the probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 at time t.', choice1='1/3\n', choice2='2/3\n', choice3='\\sqrt{2/3}\n', choice4='1', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: First, find the eigenstate of P with eigenvalue 0 by solving P|ψ0⟩=0. This yields |ψ0⟩∝(1,0,−1), normalized to (1/√2)(1,0,−1). The given state |ψ⟩=(−1,2,1) has norm √6. Compute the overlap ⟨ψ0|ψ⟩=(1/√2)[(1)(−1)+(−1)(1)]=−2/√2=−√2, so |⟨ψ0|ψ⟩|²=2. Divide by ⟨ψ|ψ⟩=6 gives probability 2/6=1/3.
