An observable of the system is represented by the matrix operator P having elements in the first row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0),  in the second row as (1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}) and in the third row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0). Calculate the probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 at time t.",

        "response": "First, find the eigenstate of P with eigenvalue 0 by solving P|\u03c80\u27e9=0. This yields |\u03c80\u27e9\u221d(1,0,\u22121), normalized to (1/\u221a2)(1,0,\u22121). The given state |\u03c8\u27e9=(\u22121,2,1) has norm \u221a6. Compute the overlap \u27e8\u03c80|\u03c8\u27e9=(1/\u221a2)[(1)(\u22121)+(\u22121)(1)]=\u22122/\u221a2=\u2212\u221a2, so |\u27e8\u03c80|\u03c8\u27e9|\u00b2=2. Divide by \u27e8\u03c8|\u03c8\u27e9=6 gives probability 2/6=1/3.\n\nAnswer:A)",
