    <pre>To find the probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0, we need to find the eigenstate of the operator P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0. Then, we project the state vector onto this eigenstate and compute the square of the modulus of the projection to get the probability. First, we find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix P. The matrix P is given by: P = [[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]]. Solving the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0, we find the eigenvalues are λ = sqrt(2), 0, -sqrt(2). The eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 is proportional to [1, 0, -1]. We normalize this eigenvector to get [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)]. The state vector is [-1, 2, 1]. We project this onto the eigenvector [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)] and compute the inner product: ([-1, 2, 1] . [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)]) = (-1)(1/sqrt(2)) + (2)(0) + (1)(-1/sqrt(2)) = (-1/sqrt(2)) + (-1/sqrt(2)) = -2/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2). The probability is the square of the modulus of this projection, which is (-sqrt(2))^2 = 2. However, we must normalize this by the norm of the state vector. The norm of the state vector is sqrt((-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(6). The probability is (2/6) = 1/3.
