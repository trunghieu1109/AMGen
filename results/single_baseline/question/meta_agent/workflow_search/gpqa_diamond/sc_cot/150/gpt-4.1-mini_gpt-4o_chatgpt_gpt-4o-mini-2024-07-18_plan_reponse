        "response": "The state of the system is given by the vector \\( \\mathbf{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\). The observable is represented by the matrix \\( P = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\\\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ 0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\). To find the probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0, we need to find the eigenvector of the matrix P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0. The eigenvalue equation is \\( P\\mathbf{x} = \\lambda \\mathbf{x} \\). For \\( \\lambda = 0 \\), we solve \\( P\\mathbf{x} = 0 \\). Solving this, we find that the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 is \\( \\mathbf{x}_0 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\). We normalize this eigenvector: \\( \\mathbf{x}_0 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\). The probability of measuring the eigenvalue 0 is given by the square of the absolute value of the inner product of \\( \\mathbf{v} \\) with the normalized eigenvector \\( \\mathbf{x}_0 \\). Compute \\( \\langle \\mathbf{x}_0, \\mathbf{v} \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(-1)(1) + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(1)(-1) = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} = -\\sqrt{2} \\). The probability is \\( |\\langle \\mathbf{x}_0, \\mathbf{v} \\rangle|^2 = (\\sqrt{2})^2 = 2 \\). However, we need to normalize this by the norm of \\( \\mathbf{v} \\), which is \\( \\sqrt{6} \\), so the probability is \\( \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3} \\).\n\nAnswer:A)",
