Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent Spqk', content='To determine the mass dimension of \\kappa in the given Lagrangian, we analyze the components involved. The term \\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}$ consists of a fermionic field \\psi, which has mass dimension 3/2, and the field strength tensor $F^{\\mu\nu}$, which has mass dimension 2. The operator \\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$ is dimensionless. Therefore, the total mass dimension of the interaction term is \\left[\\bar{\\psi}\\right] + \\left[\\psi\\right] + \\left[F^{\\mu\\nu}\\right] = \\frac{3}{2} + \\frac{3}{2} + 2 = 4. Since the Lagrangian density must have mass dimension 4, we find that \\kappa must have mass dimension \\left[\\kappa\\right]_{M} = 4 - 4 = 0. This suggests that the theory is not renormalizable, as the coupling constant with mass dimension 0 does not lead to a consistent renormalization. Thus, the correct choice is the one that states \\left[\\kappa\\right]_{M} = 0 and that the theory is not renormalizable.\n\nAnswer:The mass dimension \\left[\\kappa\\right]_{M}=-1.
