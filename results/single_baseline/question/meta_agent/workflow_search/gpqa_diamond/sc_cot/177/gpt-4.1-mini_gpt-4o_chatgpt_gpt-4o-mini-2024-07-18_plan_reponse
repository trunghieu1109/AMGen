        "response": "First, we need to determine the mass dimension of each component in the interaction Lagrangian. The Dirac field \\(\\psi\\) has mass dimension \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\), and \\(\\bar{\\psi}\\) also has mass dimension \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\). The field strength tensor \\(F^{\\mu\\nu}\\) has mass dimension 2. The gamma matrices \\(\\gamma_{\\mu}\\) are dimensionless, so \\(\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\), which involves a commutator of gamma matrices, is also dimensionless. The interaction Lagrangian \\(\\mathcal{L}_{int}\\) must have mass dimension 4. Therefore, the mass dimension of \\(\\kappa\\) is determined by ensuring the entire Lagrangian has mass dimension 4. We have: \\([\\mathcal{L}_{int}] = [\\kappa] + [\\bar{\\psi}] + [\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}] + [\\psi] + [F^{\\mu\\nu}] = [\\kappa] + \\frac{3}{2} + 0 + \\frac{3}{2} + 2 = 4\\). Solving for \\([\\kappa]\\), we get \\([\\kappa] = 4 - (\\frac{3}{2} + \\frac{3}{2} + 2) = 4 - 5 = -1\\). A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. Since \\([\\kappa] = -1\\), the theory is not renormalizable.\n\nAnswer:C)",
