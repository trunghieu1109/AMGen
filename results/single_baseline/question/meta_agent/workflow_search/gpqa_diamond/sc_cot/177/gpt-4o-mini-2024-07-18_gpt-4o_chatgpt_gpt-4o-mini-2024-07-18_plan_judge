proposed answer: To determine the mass dimension of \( \kappa \), we need to know the mass dimensions of the fields and constants in the Lagrangian. In 4-dimensional spacetime, the mass dimension of a Dirac field \( \psi \) is \( \frac{3}{2} \), and the field strength tensor \( F^{\mu\nu} \) has mass dimension 2. The commutator of gamma matrices \( \sigma_{\mu\nu} \) is dimensionless. Therefore, the mass dimension of \( \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi \) is \( 3 \), since \( \bar{\psi} \) and \( \psi \) each have mass dimension \( \frac{3}{2} \). The mass dimension of the interaction term \( \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu} \) is \( 3 + 2 = 5 \). The Lagrangian density \( \mathcal{L} \) must have mass dimension 4, so \( \kappa \) must have mass dimension \( 4 - 5 = -1 \). A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimension in 4D spacetime. Since \( \kappa \) has mass dimension \(-1\), the theory is not renormalizable.
