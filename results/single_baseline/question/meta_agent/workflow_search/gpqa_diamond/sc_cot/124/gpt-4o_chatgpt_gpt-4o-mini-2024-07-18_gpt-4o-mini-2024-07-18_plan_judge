Question: Example(question='Consider a quantum mechanical system containing a particle of mass $m$ moving in an istropic three dimensional potential of the form $V(r) = 1/2 m \\omega^2 r^2$ corresponding to the acted force obeying Hooke’s law. Here, $\\omega$ is the angular frequency of oscillation and $r$ is the radial distance of the particle from the origin in spherical polar coordinate. What is the value of energy of the third excited state, and how many linearly independent eigenfunctions are possible for the same energy eigenvalue?', choice1='(9/2) \\hbar \\omega , 10', choice2='(9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 3', choice3='11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 10', choice4='11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 3', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: In a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are given by the formula E_n = (n + 3/2)ħω, where n is the principal quantum number. For the third excited state, n = 3, so E_3 = (3 + 3/2)ħω = (9/2)ħω. The number of linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to a given energy level in three dimensions can be determined by the degeneracy of that level. For a given n, the degeneracy is given by (n + 1)(n + 2)/2. For n = 3, the degeneracy is (3 + 1)(3 + 2)/2 = 10. Therefore, the energy of the third excited state is (9/2)ħω and there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions. This matches with choice 1.
