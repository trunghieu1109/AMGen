            "Consider a quantum mechanical system containing a particle of mass $m$ moving in an istropic three dimensional potential of the form $V(r) = 1/2 m \\omega^2 r^2$ corresponding to the acted force obeying Hooke\u2019s law. Here, $\\omega$ is the angular frequency of oscillation and $r$ is the radial distance of the particle from the origin in spherical polar coordinate. What is the value of energy of the third excited state, and how many linearly independent eigenfunctions are possible for the same energy eigenvalue?",

        "response": "The system described is a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. The energy levels for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are given by E_n = (n + 3/2) \\hbar \\omega, where n is the total quantum number. The degeneracy of each energy level is given by (n + 1)(n + 2)/2. For the third excited state, we need to find the value of n such that it corresponds to the fourth energy level (since the ground state is n = 0). The sequence of n values starts at n = 0 for the ground state, so the third excited state corresponds to n = 3. The energy for n = 3 is E_3 = (3 + 3/2) \\hbar \\omega = (9/2) \\hbar \\omega. The degeneracy for n = 3 is (3 + 1)(3 + 2)/2 = 10. Therefore, the energy of the third excited state is (9/2) \\hbar \\omega, and there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions.\n\nAnswer:A)",
