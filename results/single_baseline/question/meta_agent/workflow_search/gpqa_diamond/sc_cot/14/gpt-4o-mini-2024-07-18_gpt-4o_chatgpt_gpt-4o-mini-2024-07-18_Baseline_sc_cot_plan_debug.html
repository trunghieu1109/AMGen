    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Researchers are attempting to detect transits of two Earth-like planets: Planet_1 and Planet_2. They have limited observing time and want to observe the one that has the highest probability of transiting. Both of these planets have already been detected via the RV method, allowing us to know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Although both planets share the same masses, the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2. Interestingly, they both have circular orbits. Furthermore, we know the masses and radii of the host stars of these two planets. The star hosting Planet_1 has a mass that is twice that of the host star of Planet_2. As the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved, both host stars have the same radii. Based on the provided information, the researchers have chosen to observe:&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.\n&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~2.25 times higher probability to transit.\n&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~1.5 times higher probability to transit.\n&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~2.7 times higher probability to transit.\n&#39;}

    <pre>To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we need to consider the geometry of the situation. The probability of a planet transiting is given by the formula P(transit) = (R_star + R_planet) / a, where R_star is the radius of the host star, R_planet is the radius of the planet, and a is the semi-major axis of the planet&#39;s orbit. Since both stars have the same radii, we can ignore R_star in our comparison. The semi-major axis a is related to the orbital period P and the mass of the star M_star by Kepler&#39;s third law: P^2 = (4π^2 / G(M_star + M_planet)) a^3. For circular orbits and considering M_planet &lt;&lt; M_star, we approximate this to P^2 ≈ (4π^2 / GM_star) a^3. Solving for a, we get a ∝ P^(2/3) M_star^(1/3). For Planet_1, the period is shorter (P1 = P2/3) and the star is more massive (M1 = 2M2). For Planet_2, the period is longer and the star is less massive. Substituting these into the formula for a, we find that a1 ∝ (P2/3)^(2/3) (2M2)^(1/3) and a2 ∝ P2^(2/3) M2^(1/3). Simplifying, a1 ∝ P2^(2/3) (1/3)^(2/3) 2^(1/3) and a2 ∝ P2^(2/3). The ratio a1/a2 = ((1/3)^(2/3) * 2^(1/3)) / 1. Evaluating this ratio gives approximately 0.606. Therefore, the transit probability ratio P1/P2 ≈ a2/a1 ≈ 1/0.606 ≈ 1.65. Thus, Planet_1 has a ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.
