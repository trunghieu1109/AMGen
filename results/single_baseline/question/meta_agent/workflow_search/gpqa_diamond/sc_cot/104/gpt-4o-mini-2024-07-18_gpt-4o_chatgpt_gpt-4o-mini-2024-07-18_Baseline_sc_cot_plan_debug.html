    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#34;Astronomers are currently observing a star with a radius equal to that of the Sun. One  hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The star has an effective temperature (Teff) of 6000K, and the spots exhibit a temperature difference of 1000K. As only one hemisphere is spotty, photometric time-series observations will reveal periodic variations in brightness due to rotational modulation. Interestingly, this situation can closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet. To produce the same amplitude signal in the star&#39;s light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!), what should be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the radius of the host star (i.e. Rpl/Rstar)?&#34;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;~0.07&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;~0.32&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;~0.11&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;~0.39&#39;}

Please think step by step and then solve the task.</pre>

    <pre>To solve this problem, we need to determine the equivalent size of an exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude signal in the light curve as the star spots. The amplitude of the light curve variation due to star spots is determined by the difference in brightness between the unspotted and spotted areas. The spotted area has a filling factor of 20%, meaning 20% of the hemisphere is covered by spots that are 1000K cooler than the rest of the star. The flux from a blackbody is proportional to T^4, so the flux ratio between the spotted and unspotted areas can be calculated. Then, we find the effective change in brightness of the star due to these spots. The equivalent exoplanet size is the size that would block the same amount of light. The fractional drop in light due to a planet transit is (Rpl/Rstar)^2, so we equate this to the fractional change in brightness due to the spots and solve for Rpl/Rstar.
