            "Astronomers are currently observing a star with a radius equal to that of the Sun. One  hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The star has an effective temperature (Teff) of 6000K, and the spots exhibit a temperature difference of 1000K. As only one hemisphere is spotty, photometric time-series observations will reveal periodic variations in brightness due to rotational modulation. Interestingly, this situation can closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet. To produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!), what should be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the radius of the host star (i.e. Rpl/Rstar)?",

        "response": "The star has a radius equal to that of the Sun, and dark spots cover 20% of one hemisphere with a temperature difference of 1000K. The star's effective temperature is 6000K. The spots will cause a decrease in brightness due to their lower temperature. We need to calculate the brightness reduction due to spots and equate it to the brightness reduction from a transiting planet to find the planet's radius relative to the star. The brightness reduction due to spots can be approximated by the area they cover and the temperature difference. The brightness reduction due to a transiting planet is proportional to the square of the planet's radius relative to the star. By equating these two reductions, we find the relative radius of the hypothetical exoplanet.\n\nAnswer:C)",
