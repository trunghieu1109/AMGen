Question: Example(question="Astronomers are currently observing a star with a radius equal to that of the Sun. One  hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The star has an effective temperature (Teff) of 6000K, and the spots exhibit a temperature difference of 1000K. As only one hemisphere is spotty, photometric time-series observations will reveal periodic variations in brightness due to rotational modulation. Interestingly, this situation can closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet. To produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!), what should be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the radius of the host star (i.e. Rpl/Rstar)?", choice1='~0.07', choice2='~0.32', choice3='~0.11', choice4='~0.39', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: We want the planet radius ratio Rpl/Rstar that produces the same flux variation as the spot-covered hemisphere. The spotted hemisphere has filling factor f=0.2, photosphere temperature Tph=6000K, spot temperature Tspot=Tph–1000=5000K. The relative brightness of the spotted hemisphere vs unspotted is F_spotted/F_unspotted = ( (1−f)Tph^4 + f Tspot^4 ) / Tph^4 = (1−0.2) + 0.2*(5000/6000)^4. Compute (5000/6000)=0.8333; ^4 ≈0.8333^2=0.6944, squared again ≈0.482; times 0.2 gives ≈0.0964; plus 0.8 gives ≈0.8964. Thus the flux deficit ΔF =1−0.8964=0.1036. A planet transit depth δ = (Rpl/Rstar)^2 must equal this ΔF, so Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.1036) ≈0.3218. This corresponds to choice2: ~0.32.
