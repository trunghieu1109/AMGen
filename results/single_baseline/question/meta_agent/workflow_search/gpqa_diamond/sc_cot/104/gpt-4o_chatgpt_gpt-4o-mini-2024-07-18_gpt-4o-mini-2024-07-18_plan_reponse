            "Astronomers are currently observing a star with a radius equal to that of the Sun. One  hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The star has an effective temperature (Teff) of 6000K, and the spots exhibit a temperature difference of 1000K. As only one hemisphere is spotty, photometric time-series observations will reveal periodic variations in brightness due to rotational modulation. Interestingly, this situation can closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet. To produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!), what should be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the radius of the host star (i.e. Rpl/Rstar)?",

        "response": "To find the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve as the dark spots do, we need to consider the effect of the dark spots on the star's brightness. The effective temperature of the star is 6000K, and the spots are cooler by 1000K, giving them a temperature of 5000K. The filling factor of the spots is 20%, meaning that 20% of the star's surface area is covered by these cooler spots. The brightness variation due to the spots can be calculated based on their temperature difference and filling factor. We can then compare this variation to the expected variation caused by an exoplanet transiting the star. The radius of the planet relative to the star can be derived from the ratio of the area blocked by the planet to the area of the star, similar to how the dark spots affect the brightness. After performing the calculations, the best choice that matches the expected radius of the hypothetical exoplanet is approximately 0.11 times the radius of the star.\n\nAnswer:~0.11",
