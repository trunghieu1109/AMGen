            "Astronomers are searching for exoplanets around two stars with exactly the same masses. Using the RV method, they detected one planet around each star, both with masses similar to that of Neptune. The stars themselves have masses similar to that of our Sun. Both planets were found to be in circular orbits.\n\nPlanet #1 was detected from the up to 5 miliangstrom periodic shift of a spectral line at a given wavelength. The periodic wavelength shift of the same spectral line in the spectrum of the host of planet #2 was 7 miliangstrom.\n\nThe question is: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?",

        "response": "The radial velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by measuring the Doppler shift in the spectral lines of the star as the planet orbits it. The shift in wavelength is related to the velocity of the star due to the gravitational pull of the planet. The formula for the Doppler shift is \u0394\u03bb/\u03bb = v/c, where \u0394\u03bb is the change in wavelength, \u03bb is the original wavelength, v is the velocity, and c is the speed of light. The velocity of the star is related to the orbital period of the planet through Kepler's laws. Specifically, for circular orbits, the velocity v is inversely proportional to the orbital period P. Therefore, if the wavelength shift for planet #2 is greater than that for planet #1, the velocity of the star hosting planet #2 is greater, and its orbital period is shorter. The ratio of the shifts gives us the inverse ratio of the orbital periods. For planet #1, the shift is 5 miliangstroms, and for planet #2, the shift is 7 miliangstroms. Therefore, the orbital period of planet #2 is (5/7) times that of planet #1, which is approximately 0.71 times. However, the question asks for how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, which is the inverse of this ratio, approximately 1.40.\n\nAnswer:B)",
