    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Astronomers are searching for exoplanets around two stars with exactly the same masses. Using the RV method, they detected one planet around each star, both with masses similar to that of Neptune. The stars themselves have masses similar to that of our Sun. Both planets were found to be in circular orbits.\n\nPlanet #1 was detected from the up to 5 miliangstrom periodic shift of a spectral line at a given wavelength. The periodic wavelength shift of the same spectral line in the spectrum of the host of planet #2 was 7 miliangstrom.\n\nThe question is: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;~ 0.36&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;~ 1.40&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;~ 1.96&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;~ 0.85&#39;}

    <pre>The radial velocity (RV) method involves measuring the periodic shifts in the spectral lines of a star due to the gravitational influence of an orbiting planet. The amount of shift in the spectral line is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. The formula relating the mass of the planet (M), the mass of the star (M_star), the semi-major axis (a), and the orbital period (P) is given by Kepler&#39;s Third Law, which can be simplified for two planets around the same star. The ratio of the shifts (5 miliangstrom for planet #1 and 7 miliangstrom for planet #2) can give us a clue about the ratio of their orbital periods. If we denote the shifts as Δv1 and Δv2, we can relate them to the orbital periods P1 and P2. Since the mass of the planets is similar and the stars are the same, we can assume that the shifts are proportional to the inverse of the square root of the orbital period: Δv ∝ 1/sqrt(P). Therefore, we can set up the ratio: Δv1/Δv2 = sqrt(P2/P1). By substituting the values, we can find the ratio of the periods.

Answer:Planet #2&#39;s orbital period is approximately 1.96 times longer than that of planet #1.</pre>
