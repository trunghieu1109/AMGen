            "Astronomers are searching for exoplanets around two stars with exactly the same masses. Using the RV method, they detected one planet around each star, both with masses similar to that of Neptune. The stars themselves have masses similar to that of our Sun. Both planets were found to be in circular orbits.\n\nPlanet #1 was detected from the up to 5 miliangstrom periodic shift of a spectral line at a given wavelength. The periodic wavelength shift of the same spectral line in the spectrum of the host of planet #2 was 7 miliangstrom.\n\nThe question is: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?",

        "response": "We have two planets around identical stars with identical planet masses, so the only differences in RV amplitude K arise from different orbital periods. The measured wavelength shifts \u0394\u03bb are proportional to K: K \u221d \u0394\u03bb. For circular orbits, K \u221d P^(-1/3). Thus K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3), so P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3 = (5/7)^3 \u2248 0.36. Hence planet #2\u2019s period is about 0.36 times that of planet #1.\n\nAnswer:A)",
