        "response": "To find the interplanar distance d for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal, we use the formula for the interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral lattice: d_hkl = a / sqrt(h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + kl + lh)cos(alpha)). Here, a is the interatomic distance, and alpha is the angle between the axes. For the (111) plane, h = k = l = 1. Given a = 10 \u00c5 and alpha = 30 degrees, we substitute these values into the formula: d_111 = 10 / sqrt(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 2(1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1)cos(30 degrees)). Calculating further, cos(30 degrees) = sqrt(3)/2, so d_111 = 10 / sqrt(3 + 6 * sqrt(3)/2) = 10 / sqrt(3 + 3sqrt(3)). After evaluating, the interplanar distance is approximately 9.08 \u00c5.\n\nAnswer:C)",
