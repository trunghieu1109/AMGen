Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent Hm2A', content='We need the interplanar spacing d_{111} for a rhombohedral lattice with lattice vectors of length a=10 Å and angles α=β=γ=30°. The general formula using the metric tensor or reciprocal lattice gives d_{hkl}=1/|G| where G=h b1+k b2+l b3 and b_i are reciprocal vectors. Using the direct construction of lattice vectors:\n a1=(10,0,0),\n a2=(8.6603,5,0),\n a3=(8.6603,2.3205,4.4302),\n compute the volume V=det[a1,a2,a3]≈221.51 Å^3.\n Then G=b1+b2+b3 =2π (a2×a3 + a3×a1 + a1×a2)/V =2π N/V, with N=(22.151,5.934,3.584) Å^2. |N|≈23.21 Å^2, so |G|=2π·23.21/221.51≈0.6583 Å^{-1}. Thus d=2π/|G|≈9.546 Å, matching choice A).\n\nAnswer:A)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
