        "response": "To find the interplanar distance of the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal, we use the formula for interplanar spacing d_hkl in a rhombohedral system, which is given by d_hkl = (V^(1/3) / sqrt(h^2 + k^2 + l^2)) * (1 / sin(\u03b8), where V is the volume of the unit cell and \u03b8 is the angle between the normal to the plane and the reciprocal lattice vector. The angles \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 are all 30 degrees, and the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom. We need to calculate the volume V of the rhombohedral unit cell and then use it to find d_111. After performing the calculations, we compare the results with the provided choices to find the correct interplanar distance.\n\nAnswer:9.08 Angstrom",
