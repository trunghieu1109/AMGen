Question: Example(question='Consider a rhombohedral crystal, with the interatomic distance of 10 Angstrom and the angles $\\quad\\alpha=\\beta=\\gamma=30^{0}$. What is the interplanar distance of the (111) plane of the crystal?\n', choice1='9.54 Angstrom', choice2='8.95 Angstrom', choice3='9.08 Angstrom', choice4='10.05 Angstrom', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: A rhombohedral crystal has a lattice where all sides are of equal length 'a' and all angles are equal. The interplanar distance 'd' for a plane (hkl) in a rhombohedral lattice can be calculated using the formula: 1/d^2 = (h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + kl + hl)cos(alpha)) / (a^2(1 - 3cos^2(alpha) + 2cos^3(alpha))). Given that a = 10 Angstrom and alpha = 30 degrees, we can substitute h = k = l = 1 into the formula. First, calculate cos(alpha) = cos(30 degrees) = sqrt(3)/2. Then, calculate the numerator: h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + kl + hl)cos(alpha) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 2(1 + 1 + 1)(sqrt(3)/2) = 3 + 3sqrt(3). Now calculate the denominator: a^2(1 - 3cos^2(alpha) + 2cos^3(alpha)) = 100(1 - 3(3/4) + 2(3sqrt(3)/8)) = 100(1 - 9/4 + 3sqrt(3)/4) = 100(-5/4 + 3sqrt(3)/4). Simplify this to get the value of 1/d^2, and then take the reciprocal to find d.
