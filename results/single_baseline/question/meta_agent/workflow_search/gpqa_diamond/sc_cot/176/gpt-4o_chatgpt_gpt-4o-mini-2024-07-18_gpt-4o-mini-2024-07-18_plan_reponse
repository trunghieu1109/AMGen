            "Astronomers are interested in the luminosities of two stars. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2. The mass of Star_1 is also larger by the same factor (1.5 times). Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same. Astronomers also calculated the radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:",

        "response": "To find the luminosity of the two stars, we can use the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the luminosity (L) of a star is proportional to the fourth power of its radius (R) and the square of its temperature (T): L = 4\u03c0R^2\u03c3T^4. Given that Star_1 has a radius and mass 1.5 times larger than Star_2, we can denote the radius of Star_2 as R and the mass as M. Therefore, the radius of Star_1 is 1.5R and its mass is 1.5M. Since the stars appear brightest at the same wavelength, their temperatures can be assumed to be similar. Thus, the luminosity ratio can be calculated as follows: L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4. Given that R1 = 1.5R and assuming T1 = T2, we have L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. Therefore, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of approximately 2.25.\n\nAnswer:~2.25",
