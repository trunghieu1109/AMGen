            "Astronomers are interested in the luminosities of two stars. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2. The mass of Star_1 is also larger by the same factor (1.5 times). Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same. Astronomers also calculated the radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:",

        "response": "To solve this problem, we need to use the Stefan-Boltzmann law of black body radiation, which states that the luminosity L of a star is given by L = 4\u03c0R^2\u03c3T^4, where R is the radius of the star, \u03c3 is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature of the star. The problem states that the stars appear brightest at the same wavelength, which implies they have the same temperature (Wien's displacement law). Therefore, the difference in luminosity will only depend on the difference in radius. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Therefore, the luminosity of Star_1 compared to Star_2 will be (1.5)^2 = 2.25 times greater.\n\nAnswer:A)",
