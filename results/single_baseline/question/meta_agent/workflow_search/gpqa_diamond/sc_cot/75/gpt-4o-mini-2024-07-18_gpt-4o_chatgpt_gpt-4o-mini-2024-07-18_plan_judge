Question: Example(question='You want to create a mouse embryonic chimera with induced pluripotent stem cells from somatic cells of various tissues. You are interested in the iPSCs fate in the embryo and their co-localization with apoptotic events. The iPSC cells are labeled with a mRaspberry fused under a lineage-specific promoter for each cell type. You inject the dedifferentiated cells into the 32-cell stage blastocyst and track them over 48. Every 12 h, you prepare embryos with the TUNEL - FITC staining and observe under the confocal microscope.\n\nWhat is the first thing you notice?', choice1='green signal colocalizes with the red signal', choice2='there is no green signal', choice3='cell line-specific red signals label different organelles', choice4='cytoplasmic localization of the red signal', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The question describes an experiment where induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) labeled with a red fluorescent protein (mRaspberry) are injected into a mouse embryo to study their fate and co-localization with apoptotic events. The embryos are also stained with TUNEL-FITC, which labels apoptotic cells with a green signal. The goal is to track the iPSCs and observe any co-localization with apoptotic signals. The first thing to notice would be whether the iPSCs (red signal) are co-localizing with apoptotic cells (green signal), indicating if the iPSCs are undergoing apoptosis or are in close proximity to apoptotic events.
