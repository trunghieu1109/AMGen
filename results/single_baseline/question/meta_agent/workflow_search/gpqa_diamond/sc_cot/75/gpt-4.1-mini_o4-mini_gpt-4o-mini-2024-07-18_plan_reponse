            "You want to create a mouse embryonic chimera with induced pluripotent stem cells from somatic cells of various tissues. You are interested in the iPSCs fate in the embryo and their co-localization with apoptotic events. The iPSC cells are labeled with a mRaspberry fused under a lineage-specific promoter for each cell type. You inject the dedifferentiated cells into the 32-cell stage blastocyst and track them over 48. Every 12 h, you prepare embryos with the TUNEL - FITC staining and observe under the confocal microscope.\n\nWhat is the first thing you notice?",
            "green signal colocalizes with the red signal",
            "there is no green signal",
            "cell line-specific red signals label different organelles",
            "cytoplasmic localization of the red signal",

        "response": "The mRaspberry is expressed under a lineage-specific promoter, so the fluorescent signal will localize where the fluorescent protein resides, which is typically cytoplasmic unless a localization signal is present. The first observable feature is the cytoplasmic red fluorescence.\n\nAnswer:D)",
