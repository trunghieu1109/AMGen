            "You want to create a mouse embryonic chimera with induced pluripotent stem cells from somatic cells of various tissues. You are interested in the iPSCs fate in the embryo and their co-localization with apoptotic events. The iPSC cells are labeled with a mRaspberry fused under a lineage-specific promoter for each cell type. You inject the dedifferentiated cells into the 32-cell stage blastocyst and track them over 48. Every 12 h, you prepare embryos with the TUNEL - FITC staining and observe under the confocal microscope.\n\nWhat is the first thing you notice?",

            "there is no green signal",
            "cell line-specific red signals label different organelles",
            "cytoplasmic localization of the red signal",

        "response": "In this experiment, you are tracking the fate of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) labeled with mRaspberry in a mouse embryonic chimera. You are also observing apoptotic events using TUNEL-FITC staining, which would result in a green signal where apoptosis is occurring. The question asks what is the first thing you notice when observing these embryos under the confocal microscope. Given the options, if the iPSCs are successfully integrating and there is apoptosis, the most likely first observation would be that the green signal (apoptosis) colocalizes with the red signal (iPSCs). This indicates that some of the injected iPSCs are undergoing apoptosis. Therefore, the first thing to notice is likely the colocalization of the green and red signals, as it would provide immediate insight into the fate of the injected cells in relation to apoptotic events.\n\nAnswer:A",
