Question: {'question': 'You want to create a mouse embryonic chimera with induced pluripotent stem cells from somatic cells of various tissues. You are interested in the iPSCs fate in the embryo and their co-localization with apoptotic events. The iPSC cells are labeled with a mRaspberry fused under a lineage-specific promoter for each cell type. You inject the dedifferentiated cells into the 32-cell stage blastocyst and track them over 48. Every 12 h, you prepare embryos with the TUNEL - FITC staining and observe under the confocal microscope.\n\nWhat is the first thing you notice?', 'choice1': 'green signal colocalizes with the red signal', 'choice2': 'there is no green signal', 'choice3': 'cell line-specific red signals label different organelles', 'choice4': 'cytoplasmic localization of the red signal'}\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent Hj0Z', content='The mRaspberry is expressed under a lineage-specific promoter, so the fluorescent signal will localize where the fluorescent protein resides, which is typically cytoplasmic unless a localization signal is present. The first observable feature is the cytoplasmic red fluorescence.\n\nAnswer:D)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
