Question: Example(question='You want to create a mouse embryonic chimera with induced pluripotent stem cells from somatic cells of various tissues. You are interested in the iPSCs fate in the embryo and their co-localization with apoptotic events. The iPSC cells are labeled with a mRaspberry fused under a lineage-specific promoter for each cell type. You inject the dedifferentiated cells into the 32-cell stage blastocyst and track them over 48. Every 12 h, you prepare embryos with the TUNEL - FITC staining and observe under the confocal microscope.\n\nWhat is the first thing you notice?', choice1='green signal colocalizes with the red signal', choice2='there is no green signal', choice3='cell line-specific red signals label different organelles', choice4='cytoplasmic localization of the red signal', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The experiment involves injecting iPSCs labeled with mRaspberry into a 32-cell stage blastocyst and tracking them over 48 hours. The embryos are stained with TUNEL-FITC to detect apoptotic events, which will appear as a green signal. The iPSCs are labeled with a red signal. The question asks about what is first observed. The choices suggest different observations related to the colocalization of the green apoptotic signal and the red iPSC signal. If the iPSCs are undergoing apoptosis or are located in apoptotic regions, the green signal might colocalize with the red signal.
