Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent kOjg', content="The phrase 'my compounds are on top of each other' suggests that the compounds are not behaving as intended, likely due to some form of interaction that is causing them to aggregate or interfere with one another. The most plausible explanation among the choices given is that the compounds are bonding through non-covalent or van der Waals interactions, which would lead to them being physically 'on top of each other' or aggregated. The other options regarding polarities, optical rotations, or boiling points do not directly relate to the idea of compounds being on top of each other in a physical sense.\n\nAnswer:A", prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
