            "Your overhear two chemists talking to each other as they leave a synthetic organic chemistry lab. One asks the other \"So, how did it go?\" The second chemist replies, \"Not well - my compounds are on top of each other.\"\n\nWhat is the second chemist most likely referring to?",
            "The compounds they are working with are bonding to each other through non-covalent/van der Waals interactions.",
            "The compounds they are working with have similar polarities.",
            "The compounds they are working with have similar optical rotations.",
            "The compounds they are working with have similar boiling points.",

        "response": "The phrase 'my compounds are on top of each other' suggests that the compounds are not behaving as intended, likely due to some form of interaction that is causing them to aggregate or interfere with one another. The most plausible explanation among the choices given is that the compounds are bonding through non-covalent or van der Waals interactions, which would lead to them being physically 'on top of each other' or aggregated. The other options regarding polarities, optical rotations, or boiling points do not directly relate to the idea of compounds being on top of each other in a physical sense.\n\nAnswer:A",
