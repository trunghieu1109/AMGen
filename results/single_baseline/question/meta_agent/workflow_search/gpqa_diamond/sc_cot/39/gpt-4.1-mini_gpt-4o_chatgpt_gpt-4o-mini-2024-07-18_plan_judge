Question: Example(question='Your overhear two chemists talking to each other as they leave a synthetic organic chemistry lab. One asks the other "So, how did it go?" The second chemist replies, "Not well - my compounds are on top of each other."\n\nWhat is the second chemist most likely referring to?', choice1='The compounds they are working with are bonding to each other through non-covalent/van der Waals interactions.', choice2='The compounds they are working with have similar polarities.', choice3='The compounds they are working with have similar optical rotations.', choice4='The compounds they are working with have similar boiling points.', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The phrase 'my compounds are on top of each other' suggests that the compounds are interacting in a way that causes them to be physically close or mixed. In the context of chemistry, this could imply that the compounds are not separating as expected, possibly due to similar properties. Let's analyze the choices:

Choice 1: 'The compounds they are working with are bonding to each other through non-covalent/van der Waals interactions.' This could mean that the compounds are physically close due to weak interactions, which might cause them to be 'on top of each other' in a mixture.

Choice 2: 'The compounds they are working with have similar polarities.' Similar polarities could lead to the compounds not separating well in certain solvents, possibly causing them to be 'on top of each other' if they are not separating as intended.

Choice 3: 'The compounds they are working with have similar optical rotations.' Optical rotation is a property of chiral molecules, but it wouldn't directly cause compounds to be 'on top of each other'.

Choice 4: 'The compounds they are working with have similar boiling points.' Similar boiling points could cause difficulty in separating compounds by distillation, but the phrase 'on top of each other' suggests a more immediate physical interaction.

The most likely interpretation of 'on top of each other' in a chemistry context is that the compounds are interacting physically due to non-covalent interactions, such as van der Waals forces.

Therefore, the second chemist is most likely referring to:
