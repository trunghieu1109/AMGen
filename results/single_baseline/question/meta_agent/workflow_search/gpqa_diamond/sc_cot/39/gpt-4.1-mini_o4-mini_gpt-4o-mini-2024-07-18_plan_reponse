            "Your overhear two chemists talking to each other as they leave a synthetic organic chemistry lab. One asks the other \"So, how did it go?\" The second chemist replies, \"Not well - my compounds are on top of each other.\"\n\nWhat is the second chemist most likely referring to?",
            "The compounds they are working with are bonding to each other through non-covalent/van der Waals interactions.",
            "The compounds they are working with have similar polarities.",
