            "Your overhear two chemists talking to each other as they leave a synthetic organic chemistry lab. One asks the other \"So, how did it go?\" The second chemist replies, \"Not well - my compounds are on top of each other.\"\n\nWhat is the second chemist most likely referring to?",
            "The compounds they are working with are bonding to each other through non-covalent/van der Waals interactions.",
            "The compounds they are working with have similar polarities.",
            "The compounds they are working with have similar optical rotations.",

        "response": "The second chemist is likely referring to a situation where the compounds are not separating well, possibly during a purification step such as chromatography. When compounds are described as being 'on top of each other,' it often means they are co-eluting or not separating properly, which can happen if they have similar properties. The most relevant property in this context is polarity, as similar polarities can lead to compounds eluting together in chromatography. Therefore, the second chemist is likely referring to the compounds having similar polarities.\n\nAnswer:B)",
