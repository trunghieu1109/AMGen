Question: Example(question='Let us assume stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. In this scenario, how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx?', choice1='~ 1/plx^3', choice2='~ 1/plx^2', choice3='~ 1/plx^1', choice4='~ 1/plx^4', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: If stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number of stars within a shell of thickness dr at a distance r from us is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is 4πr^2 dr. Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance (r), specifically plx ∝ 1/r. Therefore, r ∝ 1/plx. The thickness dr in terms of parallax is related to the change in parallax, d(plx), by dr = -1/plx^2 d(plx). Thus, the number of stars per unit parallax range is proportional to the volume of the shell times the change in distance per change in parallax, which gives us 4π(1/plx^2)^2 (-1/plx^2 d(plx)). Simplifying this expression, we find that the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to 1/plx^4.
