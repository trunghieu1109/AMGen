Question: Example(question='Let us assume stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. In this scenario, how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx?', choice1='~ 1/plx^3', choice2='~ 1/plx^2', choice3='~ 1/plx^1', choice4='~ 1/plx^4', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: Assume stars are uniformly distributed in space with constant number density n. The number of stars within distance d is N(<d)=n*(4/3)π d^3, so N(<d)∝d^3. Parallax p=1/d, so d∝1/p. Thus the cumulative number as function of parallax p is N(>p)=N(<1/p)∝(1/p)^3=p^-3. The differential distribution is dN/dp∝d(p^-3)/dp∝p^-4. Therefore the number of stars per unit parallax goes as ~1/p^4.
