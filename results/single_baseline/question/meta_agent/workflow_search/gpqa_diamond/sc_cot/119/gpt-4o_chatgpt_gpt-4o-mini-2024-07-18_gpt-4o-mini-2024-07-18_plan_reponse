        "response": "In a uniform distribution of stars, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is related to the volume of space that corresponds to a given range of distances. Parallax is inversely related to distance, and if we denote distance as d, then d is proportional to 1/plx. The volume of space (which contains the stars) increases with the cube of the distance (since volume is proportional to d^3). Therefore, as plx increases, the number of stars per unit range of plx decreases as the cube of the distance, leading to the relationship: the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to 1/plx^3.\n\nAnswer:A",
