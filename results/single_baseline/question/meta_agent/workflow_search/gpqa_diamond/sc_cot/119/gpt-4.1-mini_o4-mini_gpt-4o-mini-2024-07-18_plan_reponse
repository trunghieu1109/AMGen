        "response": "Assume stars are uniformly distributed in space with constant number density n. The number of stars within distance d is N(<d)=n*(4/3)\u03c0 d^3, so N(<d)\u221dd^3. Parallax p=1/d, so d\u221d1/p. Thus the cumulative number as function of parallax p is N(>p)=N(<1/p)\u221d(1/p)^3=p^-3. The differential distribution is dN/dp\u221dd(p^-3)/dp\u221dp^-4. Therefore the number of stars per unit parallax goes as ~1/p^4.\n\nAnswer:D)",
