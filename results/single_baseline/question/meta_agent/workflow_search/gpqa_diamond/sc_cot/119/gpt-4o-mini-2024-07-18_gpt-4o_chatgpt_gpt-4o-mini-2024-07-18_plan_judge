Question: Example(question='Let us assume stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. In this scenario, how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx?', choice1='~ 1/plx^3', choice2='~ 1/plx^2', choice3='~ 1/plx^1', choice4='~ 1/plx^4', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: If stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number density of stars is constant per unit volume. The distance to a star is inversely proportional to its parallax (plx), i.e., distance d = 1/plx. Therefore, the volume of space at a given range of distances is proportional to d^2, since volume scales with the square of the distance (considering a spherical shell at distance d). Thus, the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to d^2. Since d = 1/plx, the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to (1/plx)^2 = 1/plx^2. Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to 1/plx^3, as we need to account for the change in variable from distance to parallax.
