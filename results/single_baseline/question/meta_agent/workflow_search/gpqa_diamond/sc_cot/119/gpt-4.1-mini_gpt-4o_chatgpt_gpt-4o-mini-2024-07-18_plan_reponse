        "response": "If stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number of stars within a shell of thickness dr at a distance r from us is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is 4\u03c0r^2 dr. Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance (r), specifically plx \u221d 1/r. Therefore, r \u221d 1/plx. The thickness dr in terms of parallax is related to the change in parallax, d(plx), by dr = -1/plx^2 d(plx). Thus, the number of stars per unit parallax range is proportional to the volume of the shell times the change in distance per change in parallax, which gives us 4\u03c0(1/plx^2)^2 (-1/plx^2 d(plx)). Simplifying this expression, we find that the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to 1/plx^4.\n\nAnswer:D)",
