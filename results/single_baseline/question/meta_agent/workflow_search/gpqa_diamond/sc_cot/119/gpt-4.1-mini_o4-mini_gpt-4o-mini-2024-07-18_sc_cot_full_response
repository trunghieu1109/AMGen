Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent mgpX', content='Assume stars are uniformly distributed in space with constant number density n. The number of stars within distance d is N(<d)=n*(4/3)π d^3, so N(<d)∝d^3. Parallax p=1/d, so d∝1/p. Thus the cumulative number as function of parallax p is N(>p)=N(<1/p)∝(1/p)^3=p^-3. The differential distribution is dN/dp∝d(p^-3)/dp∝p^-4. Therefore the number of stars per unit parallax goes as ~1/p^4.\n\nAnswer:D)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
