Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent gpXa', content='If stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number of stars within a shell of thickness dr at a distance r from us is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is 4πr^2 dr. Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance (r), specifically plx ∝ 1/r. Therefore, r ∝ 1/plx. The thickness dr in terms of parallax is related to the change in parallax, d(plx), by dr = -1/plx^2 d(plx). Thus, the number of stars per unit parallax range is proportional to the volume of the shell times the change in distance per change in parallax, which gives us 4π(1/plx^2)^2 (-1/plx^2 d(plx)). Simplifying this expression, we find that the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to 1/plx^4.\n\nAnswer:D)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
