    <pre>To solve the problem, we need to identify each compound in the reaction scheme starting from compound A. 
1. The strong IR peak at 1750 cm^-1 for compound A suggests it is a ketone, as ketones typically show a C=O stretch in this region.
2. The reaction of compound A with HCN to form B suggests that compound A is likely a ketone or aldehyde, as HCN adds to the carbonyl group to form a cyanohydrin (compound B).
3. Reduction of compound B with H2/Pd to form compound C indicates the conversion of the nitrile group (from the cyanohydrin) to an amine or similar group.
4. Reaction of compound C with HNO2 to form compound D suggests that compound C is an amine, as HNO2 can convert amines to diazonium salts.
5. The elimination of an inert gas from compound D to form E suggests a loss of N2, indicating compound D is a diazonium salt.
6. The IR peak of compound E at 1715 cm^-1 indicates a ketone, but likely a different one from compound A.
7. The hint about compound A forming 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane with a phosphorous ylide suggests that compound A is a cyclohexanone derivative.
8. Based on the choices and the IR peaks, compound E having an IR peak at 1715 cm^-1 is likely a ketone with a different structure from A, possibly due to rearrangement or ring contraction/expansion.
9. Given the choices, 3,4-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one (choice 4) is the most likely compound E, as it is a ketone and matches the IR data.
