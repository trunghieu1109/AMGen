    <pre>In structure-based drug discovery, especially with a complex molecule like Xantheraquin that has multiple chiral centers and tautomeric forms, it is crucial to identify which forms are most relevant for biological activity. While quantum mechanical calculations can help predict stable forms, and ADME properties are important for later stages, the initial step should focus on identifying the most biologically relevant forms. Combining in silico predictions with in vitro assays can help validate which forms are promising, but before that, analyzing the tautomeric and chiral forms to prioritize those most likely to be active based on their physicochemical properties is essential. This allows for a more targeted approach in subsequent docking studies.
