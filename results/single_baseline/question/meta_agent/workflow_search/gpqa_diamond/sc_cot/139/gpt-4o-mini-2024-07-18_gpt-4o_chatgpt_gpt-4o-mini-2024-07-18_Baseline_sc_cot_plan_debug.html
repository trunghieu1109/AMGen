    <pre>To solve this problem, we need to identify Substance X and its constituent elements. The key clues are the heavier isotope, the violent reaction with liquid Y releasing gas W, and the formation of precipitate G which releases B upon heating. The melting point of B is close to 277 K, which suggests B is water (melting point 273 K). Gas W having the same number of neutrons and protons suggests it could be nitrogen (N2, with 7 protons and 7 neutrons per atom). The reaction with a keto acid forming a product with 2 oxygen atoms suggests Substance X could be a Grignard reagent (RMgX) or similar. The lightest element present in Substance X is likely hydrogen (H), and the heaviest could be magnesium (Mg) or a halogen (like Cl or Br). We need to sum the atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements, including all isotopes. Hydrogen has isotopes H-1 and H-2 (deuterium), and if the heaviest is chlorine, it has isotopes Cl-35 and Cl-37. Summing these gives H-1 + H-2 + Cl-35 + Cl-37 = 1 + 2 + 35 + 37 = 75. However, if we consider magnesium as the heaviest, with isotopes Mg-24, Mg-25, and Mg-26, we get H-1 + H-2 + Mg-24 + Mg-25 + Mg-26 = 1 + 2 + 24 + 25 + 26 = 78. Neither of these sums match the choices given. Let&#39;s consider a different approach: if the heaviest is a halogen like bromine (Br), with isotopes Br-79 and Br-81, we get H-1 + H-2 + Br-79 + Br-81 = 1 + 2 + 79 + 81 = 163. This still doesn&#39;t match. Let&#39;s try another angle: if we consider only the atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest isotopes of a single element, such as Mg (Mg-24 and Mg-26), we get 24 + 26 = 50, which doesn&#39;t match either. The problem might be simpler than I&#39;m analyzing: the cumulative atomic masses could simply be the sum of the atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in the simplest form of Substance X. If we consider hydrogen (1) and a halogen like chlorine (35), we get 1 + 35 = 36. This still doesn&#39;t match. Let&#39;s try a different approach: if we consider the lightest as hydrogen (1) and the heaviest as nitrogen (14), we get 1 + 14 = 15. This doesn&#39;t match either. Finally, let&#39;s consider another possibility: the lightest as hydrogen (1) and the heaviest as sulfur (32), we get 1 + 32 = 33. This doesn&#39;t match. Let&#39;s consider a simpler scenario: if Substance X is a Grignard reagent like CH3MgCl, the lightest is H (1), and the heaviest could be Mg (24) or Cl (35). If we consider H (1) and Cl (35), we get 1 + 35 = 36. This still doesn&#39;t match. If we consider Mg (24) and Cl (35), we get 24 + 35 = 59. This still doesn&#39;t match. Let&#39;s try considering only the isotopes of the heaviest element, such as Cl (35 and 37), we get 35 + 37 = 72. This doesn&#39;t match. Let&#39;s try another possibility: if we consider H (1) and Mg (24), we get 1 + 24 = 25. This matches choice 2.
