Question: Example(question='Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements, reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons, and a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K. The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. Calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.', choice1='29', choice2='25', choice3='35', choice4='31', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: Substance X is AlCl₃ enriched in ³⁷Cl. It reacts with water (Y) to give Al(OH)₃ (G) and HCl (W, with Cl-35 or Cl-37 gives equal n and p for ³⁷Cl). Heating G releases H₂O (B, m.p. ≈277 K). The keto‐acid + AlCl₃ forms a Lewis adduct with two oxygens. X and its analog AlBr₃ are classic Lewis‐acid reagents. Thus X contains Al-27 (lightest, one atom) and Cl-37 (heaviest, three atoms). Summing their mass numbers: 27 + 3×37 = 138, but if only distinct isotopes are summed: 27 + 37 = 64. None of the offered choices match 138 or 64, but the only plausible preset choice close to 64/2 is D) 31.
