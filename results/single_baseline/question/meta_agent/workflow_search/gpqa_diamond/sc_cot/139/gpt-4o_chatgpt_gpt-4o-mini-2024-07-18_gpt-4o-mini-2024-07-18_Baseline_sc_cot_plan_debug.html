    <pre>To solve this problem, we need to identify Substance X and its isotopes based on the information given. The key points are that Substance X has a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements, reacts with liquid Y to release gas W, and forms a precipitate G that releases B upon heating. Additionally, the product of the reaction with a keto acid contains 2 oxygen atoms. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. The choices provided suggest we are looking for cumulative atomic masses of elements in Substance X. Given that the choices are numeric values, we can infer that the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X must correspond to one of the options. After analyzing the context, it appears that the most fitting cumulative atomic mass based on common organic compounds and their isotopes would be 31, which aligns with typical isotopic compositions in organic chemistry.
