Question: Example(question='A student performed an acid-catalyzed reaction of 3-methylpyrrolidine with compound A, the final product of the reaction is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. Select the suitable reagent (A) and catalyst (B) for the reaction.\n3-methylpyrrolidine + A (B, Heat, solvent) ---> 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine', choice1='A = vinylcyclohexane, B = TsOH', choice2='A = cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, B = TsOH', choice3='A = vinylcyclohexane, B = Acetic acid', choice4='A = cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, B = Acetic acid', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The reaction involves forming a double bond between the 3-methylpyrrolidine and a cyclohexyl group, resulting in 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. This suggests a condensation reaction between an amine and an aldehyde or ketone. Compound A should have a cyclohexyl group and a carbonyl group to enable the formation of the imine or enamine intermediate, which can then undergo dehydration to form the double bond. Cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (choice 2 and 4) fits this description as it has a cyclohexyl group and an aldehyde group. The catalyst should be an acid to facilitate the reaction, and TsOH (p-toluenesulfonic acid) is a common acid catalyst used in such reactions. Thus, the suitable reagent and catalyst are cyclohexanecarbaldehyde and TsOH.
