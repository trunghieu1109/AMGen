Question: Example(question='A student performed an acid-catalyzed reaction of 3-methylpyrrolidine with compound A, the final product of the reaction is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. Select the suitable reagent (A) and catalyst (B) for the reaction.\n3-methylpyrrolidine + A (B, Heat, solvent) ---> 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine', choice1='A = vinylcyclohexane, B = TsOH', choice2='A = cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, B = TsOH', choice3='A = vinylcyclohexane, B = Acetic acid', choice4='A = cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, B = Acetic acid', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To determine the suitable reagent A and catalyst B for the reaction, we need to analyze the final product, which is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. This product suggests that the reagent A should be a compound that can form a double bond with the pyrrolidine. The presence of a cyclohexyl group in the product indicates that the reagent A is likely to be cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, as it can react to form the desired product. The catalyst B should be an acid that can facilitate the reaction, and TsOH (p-toluenesulfonic acid) is a strong acid that can serve this purpose. Therefore, the most suitable choice is A = cyclohexanecarbaldehyde and B = TsOH.
