Question: Example(question='If an equimolar mixture X of two liquids, which decolorizes bromine water, is treated with platinum when heated, then an equimolar mixture Y of two other liquids is formed as a result of disproportionation, which does not decolorize bromine water. Hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y in the presence of platinum under rather severe conditions gives only one substance, a certain hydrocarbon Z (mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%), which is a constituent of mixture Y and widely used as a solvent. Substance Z does not react further with hydrogen. There are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of the compounds of mixture X.\nIndicate the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X.', choice1='22', choice2='12', choice3='16', choice4='18', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To determine the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X, we need to analyze the information given. The key points are that mixture X consists of two liquids that decolorize bromine water, indicating they likely contain double bonds or reactive groups. The resulting hydrocarbon Z after hydrogenation has a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This suggests that Z is likely a saturated hydrocarbon. We can use the formula for mass fraction to calculate the number of hydrogen atoms in mixture X based on the information about Z. Since Z is a solvent and does not react further with hydrogen, it indicates it's a stable compound. Given the options provided, we can deduce that the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is likely to be one of the provided choices based on common structures of hydrocarbons that fit the criteria.
