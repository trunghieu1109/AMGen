            "If an equimolar mixture X of two liquids, which decolorizes bromine water, is treated with platinum when heated, then an equimolar mixture Y of two other liquids is formed as a result of disproportionation, which does not decolorize bromine water. Hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y in the presence of platinum under rather severe conditions gives only one substance, a certain hydrocarbon Z (mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%), which is a constituent of mixture Y and widely used as a solvent. Substance Z does not react further with hydrogen. There are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of the compounds of mixture X.\nIndicate the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X.",

        "response": "We have an equimolar mixture X of two non\u2010conjugated dienes that decolorize Br\u2082 water. Platinum\u2010catalyzed disproportionation gives an equimolar mixture Y of benzene and cyclohexane (no Br\u2082 reaction). Hydrogenation of both X and Y yields only cyclohexane (Z), whose H mass fraction (12/84\u224814.28%) matches. The dienes in X are 1,4-cyclohexadiene and 1,5-cyclohexadiene, each C\u2086H\u2088 (8 H atoms). The total H atoms in the two liquids of X is 8+8=16.\n\nAnswer:C)",
