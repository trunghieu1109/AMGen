Question: Example(question='If an equimolar mixture X of two liquids, which decolorizes bromine water, is treated with platinum when heated, then an equimolar mixture Y of two other liquids is formed as a result of disproportionation, which does not decolorize bromine water. Hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y in the presence of platinum under rather severe conditions gives only one substance, a certain hydrocarbon Z (mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%), which is a constituent of mixture Y and widely used as a solvent. Substance Z does not react further with hydrogen. There are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of the compounds of mixture X.\nIndicate the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X.', choice1='22', choice2='12', choice3='16', choice4='18', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: The problem describes a situation with an equimolar mixture X of two liquids that decolorize bromine water, indicating the presence of carbon-carbon double bonds (alkenes). Upon treatment with platinum and heat, these undergo disproportionation to form another equimolar mixture Y of two other liquids that do not decolorize bromine water, indicating that they are saturated hydrocarbons (alkanes). Hydrogenation of both mixtures X and Y gives only one substance Z, a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%, which is a constituent of mixture Y and does not react further with hydrogen, suggesting it is fully saturated. The mass fraction of hydrogen 14.28% corresponds to a molecular formula of C7H16 (heptane), as 16/(7*12 + 16) = 14.28%. This indicates that heptane is the only product of hydrogenation and is also part of mixture Y. Since mixture X, upon hydrogenation, also gives heptane, the original unsaturated compounds must have a total of 16 hydrogen atoms to match the fully saturated heptane (C7H16) after hydrogenation. Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 16.
