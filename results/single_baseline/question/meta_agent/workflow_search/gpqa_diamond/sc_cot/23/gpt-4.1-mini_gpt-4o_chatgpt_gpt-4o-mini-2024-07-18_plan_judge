Question: Example(question='If an equimolar mixture X of two liquids, which decolorizes bromine water, is treated with platinum when heated, then an equimolar mixture Y of two other liquids is formed as a result of disproportionation, which does not decolorize bromine water. Hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y in the presence of platinum under rather severe conditions gives only one substance, a certain hydrocarbon Z (mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%), which is a constituent of mixture Y and widely used as a solvent. Substance Z does not react further with hydrogen. There are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of the compounds of mixture X.\nIndicate the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X.', choice1='22', choice2='12', choice3='16', choice4='18', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: The problem describes a chemical process involving an equimolar mixture X that decolorizes bromine water, indicating the presence of alkenes or alkynes. When treated with platinum, mixture X undergoes disproportionation to form mixture Y, which does not decolorize bromine water, suggesting alkanes or other saturated compounds. Hydrogenation of both mixtures X and Y results in the same hydrocarbon Z, with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. This fraction matches that of toluene, C7H8, which is a common solvent and does not react further with hydrogen. Therefore, mixture Y contains toluene. Since Z is a constituent of Y and is formed from hydrogenation of X, mixture X must contain unsaturated hydrocarbons that can be converted to toluene upon hydrogenation. The unsaturated hydrocarbons that can form toluene upon hydrogenation are likely to be alkenes or alkynes with a total of 12 carbon atoms (since toluene has 7 carbons, and the other compound in Y has to balance this). The total number of hydrogen atoms in the unsaturated hydrocarbons of X is calculated by considering the structure of potential compounds that can form toluene. A plausible combination is two alkenes such as styrene (C8H8) and phenylacetylene (C8H6), which upon hydrogenation form toluene and ethylbenzene (C8H10). The total number of hydrogen atoms in these two compounds is 8 + 8 = 16.
