Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The problem involves a series of reactions starting from 1,3-dibromoadamantane. First, it is heated with KOH, likely resulting in the formation of a ketone due to the IR absorbance at 1720 cm-1, which is characteristic of a carbonyl group. The NMR data suggests a structure with a carbonyl and other protons in the adamantane framework. Then, the product is treated with aluminum isopropoxide, which could lead to the formation of an alcohol via reduction or some rearrangement. The subsequent ozonolysis and treatment with dimethylsulfide likely cleaves double bonds, forming aldehydes or ketones. The most deshielded hydrogen atom in the final product (product 3) would likely be an aldehyde proton, which typically appears as a doublet due to coupling with adjacent hydrogens.

Answer:doublet of triplets
Extracted answer: doublet of triplets
Correct answer: 2
