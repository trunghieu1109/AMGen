    <pre>The initial compound, 1,3-dibromoadamantane, when heated with KOH, likely undergoes an elimination reaction to form a ketone, as indicated by the IR spectrum absorbance at 1720 cm-1. The 1H NMR suggests the presence of a ketone with two hydrogens at 4.79 ppm, which are likely adjacent to the carbonyl group. When this product is treated with aluminum isopropoxide, a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction could occur, reducing the ketone to an alcohol. Ozonolysis followed by dimethylsulfide treatment would cleave double bonds and form carbonyl compounds. The most deshielded hydrogen in the final product is likely adjacent to a carbonyl group, which would experience coupling with adjacent hydrogens. Considering the likely structure and the coupling patterns, the most deshielded hydrogen, adjacent to a carbonyl group, would couple with adjacent protons leading to the pattern described in choice 2.
