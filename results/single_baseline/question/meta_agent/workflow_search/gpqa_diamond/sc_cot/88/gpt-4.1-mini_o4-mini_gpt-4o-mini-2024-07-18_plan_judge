Question: Example(question='1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated to 240C with an excess of KOH, creating a light yellow solid product 1, With 1H nmr spectrum: 4.79(2H), 2.41-2.23(10H), 1.94(2H) and a characteristic absorbance in the IR spectrum at 1720cm-1.\n\nThis product was then heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide, forming product 2.\n\nozone was bubbled through a solution of 2 at -78C, followed by addition of dimethylsulfide, forming product 3.\n\nin the 1H nmr spectrum of 3, what is the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom (excluding those that will exchange with deuterated solvent)?', choice1='doublet of triplets', choice2='triplet of triplets', choice3='pentet', choice4='triplet', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: First, 1,3-dibromoadamantane on vigorous base elimination/rearrangement gives an adamantanone (product 1) (IR 1720 cm–1, NMR 4.79 ppm for the α-CH’s). Next, aluminum isopropoxide (Meerwein–Ponndorf–Verley conditions) reduces the ketone to the corresponding alcohol and dehydrates under heat to give an internal alkene (product 2). Ozonolysis of that alkene at –78 °C cleaves the double bond to a 1,3-diketone (product 3). In the ¹H NMR of 3 the most deshielded proton is the methine between two carbonyls; it is split by two inequivalent CH₂ groups on either side (each set of two protons has a different J), so it appears as a triplet of triplets.
