Question: Example(question='1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated to 240C with an excess of KOH, creating a light yellow solid product 1, With 1H nmr spectrum: 4.79(2H), 2.41-2.23(10H), 1.94(2H) and a characteristic absorbance in the IR spectrum at 1720cm-1.\n\nThis product was then heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide, forming product 2.\n\nozone was bubbled through a solution of 2 at -78C, followed by addition of dimethylsulfide, forming product 3.\n\nin the 1H nmr spectrum of 3, what is the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom (excluding those that will exchange with deuterated solvent)?', choice1='doublet of triplets', choice2='triplet of triplets', choice3='pentet', choice4='triplet', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The initial compound, 1,3-dibromoadamantane, when heated with KOH, likely undergoes an elimination reaction to form a ketone, as indicated by the IR spectrum absorbance at 1720 cm-1. The 1H NMR suggests the presence of a ketone with two hydrogens at 4.79 ppm, which are likely adjacent to the carbonyl group. When this product is treated with aluminum isopropoxide, a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction could occur, reducing the ketone to an alcohol. Ozonolysis followed by dimethylsulfide treatment would cleave double bonds and form carbonyl compounds. The most deshielded hydrogen in the final product is likely adjacent to a carbonyl group, which would experience coupling with adjacent hydrogens. Considering the likely structure and the coupling patterns, the most deshielded hydrogen, adjacent to a carbonyl group, would couple with adjacent protons leading to the pattern described in choice 2.
