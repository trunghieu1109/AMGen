            "1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated to 240C with an excess of KOH, creating a light yellow solid product 1, With 1H nmr spectrum: 4.79(2H), 2.41-2.23(10H), 1.94(2H) and a characteristic absorbance in the IR spectrum at 1720cm-1.\n\nThis product was then heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide, forming product 2.\n\nozone was bubbled through a solution of 2 at -78C, followed by addition of dimethylsulfide, forming product 3.\n\nin the 1H nmr spectrum of 3, what is the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom (excluding those that will exchange with deuterated solvent)?",

        "response": "To determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in product 3, we need to analyze the structure of product 3 after ozonolysis and the subsequent reaction with dimethylsulfide. Typically, ozonolysis followed by dimethylsulfide would cleave double bonds and introduce new functional groups, affecting the coupling patterns. The most deshielded hydrogen atom is likely to be adjacent to multiple other hydrogen atoms, leading to a complex splitting pattern. Given the options, a 'doublet of triplets' suggests that there are two different coupling constants affecting the splitting, which is plausible in a complex structure. Therefore, I lean towards that option based on the likely interactions in the molecule.\n\nAnswer:A",
