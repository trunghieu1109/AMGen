proposed answer: For the first reaction, we are dealing with a Michael addition of ethyl acrylate to 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. The base t-BuOK will deprotonate the most acidic hydrogen, which is the alpha hydrogen to the ketone, allowing for the Michael addition. The resulting product will be an ethyl 3-substituted propanoate. Considering the steric hindrance and the stability, the major product will likely have the addition at the less hindered position, which is the 4-position relative to the ketone, leading to ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate. For the second reaction, 1-nitropropane will undergo a Michael addition with (E)-but-2-enenitrile in the presence of KOH and water. The nitro group is a good Michael donor, and the reaction will likely add to the less hindered end of the but-2-enenitrile, leading to 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile as the major product.
