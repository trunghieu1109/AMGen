proposed answer: For reaction A, enolate formation occurs at the less hindered α‐carbon (the C6 position), not at C2, because t-BuOK abstracts the more accessible proton. That enolate then undergoes a Michael addition to ethyl acrylate, attaching the propanoate chain at the former C6 (now substituent carbon 1 in the cyclohexyl substituent). Numbering the substituent ring from that attachment carbon, the original ketone (at C1 of cyclohexanone) becomes the 2-oxo, and the original C2 substituents (ethyl and methyl) appear at substituent position 3 as ethyl and methyl, while the methyl on original C6 is at substituent position 1. Hence the product is ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate.

For reaction B, 1-nitropropane is deprotonated at its α-carbon to give the nitronate, which undergoes a Michael addition to (E)-but-2-enenitrile, extending the nitrile chain and placing the nitro group two carbons further down. The result is a six‐carbon nitrile (hexanenitrile) with a nitro at C4 and a methyl at C3: 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile. This matches choice 2.
