        "response": "To find the order of magnitude of the entropy of a black hole, we can use the formula for the entropy S of a black hole, which is given by S = k * A / (4 * G), where A is the area of the event horizon. The area A can be related to the angular size \u03b8 and the distance d. The angular size \u03b8 in radians can be converted from degrees, and the area can be approximated using the formula A = \u03c0 * (R_s)^2, where R_s is the Schwarzschild radius. The Schwarzschild radius can be calculated from the mass of the black hole. However, the problem does not provide the mass, but we can estimate it based on the angular size and distance. The entropy can be estimated using the known relation of black hole entropy and the angular size. After performing the calculations, we can compare the results to the provided choices.\n\nAnswer:C",
