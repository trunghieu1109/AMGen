    <pre>To find the order of magnitude of the entropy of the black hole, we can use the formula for the entropy of a black hole, which is given by the Bekenstein-Hawking formula: S = kA/4l_p^2, where A is the area of the event horizon, k is the Boltzmann constant, and l_p is the Planck length. The area A can be found from the radius of the event horizon, which is related to the angular size θ and the distance d. The radius r of the black hole is given by r = θd. Given θ = 10^-17 degrees and d = 10^10 parsecs, we convert θ to radians: θ = 10^-17 * (π/180) radians. Then, r = θd = 10^-17 * (π/180) * 10^10 parsecs. The Schwarzschild radius r_s is related to the mass M of the black hole by r_s = 2GM/c^2, where G is the gravitational constant and c is the speed of light. The area A = 4πr_s^2. The entropy S is then proportional to the square of the mass, which is proportional to the square of the radius. After calculating, we find the closest order of magnitude for the entropy from the given choices.
