        "response": "The product has two alkenyl substituents: a prop-1-en-1-yl and a vinyl on a cyclopentane ring. Cross-metathesis of one exocyclic methylene with propene gives the prop-1-en-1-yl substituent, and metathesis of the other exocyclic methylene gives the vinyl group. Thus the starting material must be cyclopentane with two exocyclic methylenes: 1,2-dimethylenecyclopentane.\n\nAnswer:C)",
