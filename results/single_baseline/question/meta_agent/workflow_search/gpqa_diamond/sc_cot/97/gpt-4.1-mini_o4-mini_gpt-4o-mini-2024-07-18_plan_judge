Question: Example(question='Identify the starting material, A, in the following reaction.\nA + a methyleneruthenium compound + 1-propene ---> 1-(prop-1-en-1-yl)-2-vinylcyclopentane', choice1='2-methyl-3-methylenebicyclo[2.1.0]pentane', choice2='bicyclo[3.2.0]hept-6-ene', choice3='1,2-dimethylenecyclopentane', choice4='2-methylbicyclo[3.1.0]hex-2-ene', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The product has two alkenyl substituents: a prop-1-en-1-yl and a vinyl on a cyclopentane ring. Cross-metathesis of one exocyclic methylene with propene gives the prop-1-en-1-yl substituent, and metathesis of the other exocyclic methylene gives the vinyl group. Thus the starting material must be cyclopentane with two exocyclic methylenes: 1,2-dimethylenecyclopentane.
