Question: Example(question="Compounds that have the same molecular formula but are different in their structural arrangement are known as isomers. Isomers have two types, constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but differ in their structures. In stereoisomers, molecules are connected in the same way, but their arrangements in space are different.\nWhich of the following organic moieties show optical isomerism?\n\n1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate\n2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n3. benzophenone\n4. dimethyl fumarate", choice1='2 and 3', choice2='1 and 2', choice3='3 and 4', choice4='1, 2 and 4', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: Optical isomerism requires a chiral center or axis. 1 has atropisomerism due to hindered rotation in ortho‐substituted biphenyl, giving an axis of chirality. 2 (methyl 2‐hydroxypropanoate) has a chiral α‐carbon. 3 (benzophenone) lacks any chirality, and 4 (dimethyl fumarate) is an achiral trans alkene (E/Z is geometric, not optical). Thus only 1 and 2 show optical isomerism.
