    <pre>To determine which compounds show optical isomerism, we need to identify chiral centers or the presence of chirality in the given compounds. 

1. Dimethyl 6,6&#39;-dinitro-[1,1&#39;-biphenyl]-2,2&#39;-dicarboxylate: This compound could potentially have chirality if the biphenyl moiety is twisted in such a way that it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. However, biphenyl compounds typically show optical isomerism only when there are bulky groups that prevent free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. 

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: This compound is also known as methyl lactate. It has a chiral center at the second carbon (the carbon bonded to the hydroxyl group), making it optically active.

3. Benzophenone: This compound does not have any chiral centers and is not optically active.

4. Dimethyl fumarate: Fumarate is the trans isomer of butenedioic acid and does not have chiral centers. It is not optically active.

Based on this analysis, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (compound 2) is the only compound that shows optical isomerism.

Therefore, the correct choice is 2 and 3, but since benzophenone does not show optical isomerism, the correct answer should only include compound 2.
