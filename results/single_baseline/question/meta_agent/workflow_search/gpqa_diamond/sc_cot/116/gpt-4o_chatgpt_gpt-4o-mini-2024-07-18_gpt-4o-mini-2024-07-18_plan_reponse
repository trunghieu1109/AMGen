            "Compounds that have the same molecular formula but are different in their structural arrangement are known as isomers. Isomers have two types, constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but differ in their structures. In stereoisomers, molecules are connected in the same way, but their arrangements in space are different.\nWhich of the following organic moieties show optical isomerism?\n\n1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate\n2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n3. benzophenone\n4. dimethyl fumarate",

        "response": "To determine which of the given organic moieties show optical isomerism, we need to identify if they have chiral centers or if they can exist as non-superimposable mirror images. A compound shows optical isomerism if it has at least one chiral center. Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate - This compound does not have any chiral centers due to the symmetrical biphenyl structure.\n2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate - This compound has a chiral center at the carbon attached to the hydroxyl group, hence it can show optical isomerism.\n3. Benzophenone - This compound does not have any chiral centers, as both phenyl groups are identical.\n4. Dimethyl fumarate - This compound has a double bond and can exist in two geometric isomers, but it does not have a chiral center, thus it does not show optical isomerism.\n\nFrom this analysis, only methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism. Therefore, the correct answer is choice 2 (1 and 2) since it is the only one that contains a compound with optical isomerism.\n\nAnswer:B",
