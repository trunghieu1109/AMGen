    <pre>To determine which organic moieties show optical isomerism, we need to identify if they have chiral centers or can exist in non-superimposable mirror images. 1. Dimethyl 6,6&#39;-dinitro-[1,1&#39;-biphenyl]-2,2&#39;-dicarboxylate: This compound can show optical isomerism due to the biphenyl structure which can have restricted rotation leading to chirality. 2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: This compound is also known as methyl lactate, which has a chiral center at the second carbon atom and can exhibit optical isomerism. 3. Benzophenone: This compound does not have a chiral center and does not exhibit optical isomerism. 4. Dimethyl fumarate: This compound is a geometric isomer and does not exhibit optical isomerism as it does not have a chiral center. Therefore, the compounds that show optical isomerism are 1 and 2.
