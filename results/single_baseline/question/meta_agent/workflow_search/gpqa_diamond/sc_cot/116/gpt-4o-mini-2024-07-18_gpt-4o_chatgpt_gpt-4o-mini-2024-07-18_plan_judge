Question: Example(question="Compounds that have the same molecular formula but are different in their structural arrangement are known as isomers. Isomers have two types, constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but differ in their structures. In stereoisomers, molecules are connected in the same way, but their arrangements in space are different.\nWhich of the following organic moieties show optical isomerism?\n\n1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate\n2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n3. benzophenone\n4. dimethyl fumarate", choice1='2 and 3', choice2='1 and 2', choice3='3 and 4', choice4='1, 2 and 4', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To determine which organic moieties show optical isomerism, we need to identify if they have chiral centers or can exist in non-superimposable mirror images. 1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate: This compound can show optical isomerism due to the biphenyl structure which can have restricted rotation leading to chirality. 2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: This compound is also known as methyl lactate, which has a chiral center at the second carbon atom and can exhibit optical isomerism. 3. Benzophenone: This compound does not have a chiral center and does not exhibit optical isomerism. 4. Dimethyl fumarate: This compound is a geometric isomer and does not exhibit optical isomerism as it does not have a chiral center. Therefore, the compounds that show optical isomerism are 1 and 2.
