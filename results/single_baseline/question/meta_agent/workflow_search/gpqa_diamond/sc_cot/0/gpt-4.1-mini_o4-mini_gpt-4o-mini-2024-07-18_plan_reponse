        "response": "To resolve two energy levels, their separation \u0394E must exceed the uncertainty (linewidth) given by \u0394E_uncert \u2248 \u0127/\u0394t. For the shorter lifetime \u0394t=10\u207b\u2079 s, \u0394E_uncert \u2248 (1.05\u00d710\u207b\u00b3\u2074 J\u00b7s)/(10\u207b\u2079 s) \u224810\u207b\u00b2\u2075 J \u22486\u00d710\u207b\u2077 eV. Any separation smaller than this cannot be clearly distinguished. Checking the choices: 10\u207b\u2079 eV, 10\u207b\u00b9\u00b9 eV, and 10\u207b\u2078 eV are all \u226a6\u00d710\u207b\u2077 eV, so only 10\u207b\u2074 eV is sufficiently larger than the uncertainty. Therefore the correct choice is D.\n\nAnswer:D",
