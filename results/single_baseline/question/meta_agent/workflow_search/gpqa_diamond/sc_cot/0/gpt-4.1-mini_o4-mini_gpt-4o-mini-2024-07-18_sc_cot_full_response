Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent tpUs', content='To resolve two energy levels, their separation ΔE must exceed the uncertainty (linewidth) given by ΔE_uncert ≈ ħ/Δt. For the shorter lifetime Δt=10⁻⁹ s, ΔE_uncert ≈ (1.05×10⁻³⁴ J·s)/(10⁻⁹ s) ≈10⁻²⁵ J ≈6×10⁻⁷ eV. Any separation smaller than this cannot be clearly distinguished. Checking the choices: 10⁻⁹ eV, 10⁻¹¹ eV, and 10⁻⁸ eV are all ≪6×10⁻⁷ eV, so only 10⁻⁴ eV is sufficiently larger than the uncertainty. Therefore the correct choice is D.\n\nAnswer:D', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
