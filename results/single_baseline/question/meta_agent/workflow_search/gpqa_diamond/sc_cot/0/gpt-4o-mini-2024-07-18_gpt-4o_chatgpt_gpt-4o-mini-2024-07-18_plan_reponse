            "Two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10^-9 sec and 10^-8 sec, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which one of the following options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?\n",

        "response": "To clearly distinguish two energy levels, the energy difference must be greater than or equal to the uncertainty in energy, which is determined by the uncertainty principle. The uncertainty in energy \u0394E is related to the lifetime \u03c4 of the state by \u0394E * \u03c4 \u2248 \u0127/2, where \u0127 is the reduced Planck's constant (approximately 6.58 x 10^-16 eV\u00b7s). For the state with the shorter lifetime (10^-9 sec), the uncertainty in energy is approximately \u0394E \u2248 \u0127/(2\u03c4) = 6.58 x 10^-16 eV\u00b7s / (2 x 10^-9 s) = 3.29 x 10^-7 eV. Therefore, to resolve the energy levels, the energy difference should be greater than 3.29 x 10^-7 eV. Among the given choices, 10^-4 eV is the only option greater than this value.\n\nAnswer:D)",
