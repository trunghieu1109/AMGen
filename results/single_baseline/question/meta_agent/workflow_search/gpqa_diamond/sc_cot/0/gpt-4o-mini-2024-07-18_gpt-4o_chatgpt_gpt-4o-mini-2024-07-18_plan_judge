Question: Example(question='Two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10^-9 sec and 10^-8 sec, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which one of the following options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?\n', choice1='10^-9 eV', choice2='10^-11 eV', choice3='10^-8 eV\n', choice4='10^-4 eV', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: To clearly distinguish two energy levels, the energy difference must be greater than or equal to the uncertainty in energy, which is determined by the uncertainty principle. The uncertainty in energy ΔE is related to the lifetime τ of the state by ΔE * τ ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant (approximately 6.58 x 10^-16 eV·s). For the state with the shorter lifetime (10^-9 sec), the uncertainty in energy is approximately ΔE ≈ ħ/(2τ) = 6.58 x 10^-16 eV·s / (2 x 10^-9 s) = 3.29 x 10^-7 eV. Therefore, to resolve the energy levels, the energy difference should be greater than 3.29 x 10^-7 eV. Among the given choices, 10^-4 eV is the only option greater than this value.
