proposed answer: To distinguish two quantum states with energies E1 and E2, we need to consider the energy-time uncertainty principle, which states that the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) are related by ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant (approximately 6.58 x 10^-16 eV·s). The lifetime of the states gives us the uncertainty in time. For the first state, Δt1 = 10^-9 s, and for the second state, Δt2 = 10^-8 s. The energy uncertainty for each state is ΔE1 = ħ/(2 * Δt1) and ΔE2 = ħ/(2 * Δt2). The energy difference required to resolve the two states should be greater than the energy uncertainty of the state with the larger uncertainty, which is ΔE2. Calculating ΔE2, we get ΔE2 = 6.58 x 10^-16 eV / (2 * 10^-8 s) = 3.29 x 10^-8 eV. Therefore, the energy difference should be greater than 3.29 x 10^-8 eV to resolve the states. The only option greater than this value is 10^-8 eV.
