    <pre>To clearly distinguish two energy levels, we need to consider the uncertainty principle, which relates the lifetime of a state to the uncertainty in energy. The uncertainty in energy (ΔE) can be estimated using the relation ΔE ≈ ħ / τ, where τ is the lifetime of the state. For the two states with lifetimes τ1 = 10^-9 sec and τ2 = 10^-8 sec, we can calculate their respective energy uncertainties. The state with the shorter lifetime (10^-9 sec) will have a larger uncertainty in energy. We want to find an energy difference that is larger than the uncertainty in energy for both states to ensure they can be clearly resolved. The uncertainty for the first state (τ1) is larger than for the second state (τ2), so we will use τ1 to estimate the minimum resolvable energy difference. If we calculate the energy uncertainty for τ1 = 10^-9 sec, we find that the energy uncertainty is on the order of 10^-6 eV. Therefore, we need an energy difference that is significantly larger than this uncertainty to clearly resolve the two states. Among the given options, 10^-4 eV is the only option that is significantly larger than 10^-6 eV, making it the best choice for a clearly resolvable energy difference.
