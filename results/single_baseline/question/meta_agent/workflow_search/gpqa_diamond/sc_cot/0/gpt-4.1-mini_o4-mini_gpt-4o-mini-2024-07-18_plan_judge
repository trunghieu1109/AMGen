Question: Example(question='Two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10^-9 sec and 10^-8 sec, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which one of the following options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?\n', choice1='10^-9 eV', choice2='10^-11 eV', choice3='10^-8 eV\n', choice4='10^-4 eV', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To resolve two energy levels, their separation ΔE must exceed the uncertainty (linewidth) given by ΔE_uncert ≈ ħ/Δt. For the shorter lifetime Δt=10⁻⁹ s, ΔE_uncert ≈ (1.05×10⁻³⁴ J·s)/(10⁻⁹ s) ≈10⁻²⁵ J ≈6×10⁻⁷ eV. Any separation smaller than this cannot be clearly distinguished. Checking the choices: 10⁻⁹ eV, 10⁻¹¹ eV, and 10⁻⁸ eV are all ≪6×10⁻⁷ eV, so only 10⁻⁴ eV is sufficiently larger than the uncertainty. Therefore the correct choice is D.

Answer:D
Extracted answer: D
Correct answer: 4
