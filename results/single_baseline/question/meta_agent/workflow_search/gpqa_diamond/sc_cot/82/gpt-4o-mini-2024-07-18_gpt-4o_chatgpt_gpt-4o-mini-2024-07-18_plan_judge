Question: Example(question='We dilute 20.00 cm3 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm3 water, then titrate the resulting solution with 0.1M NaOH (25 °C). What will be the value of pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point? The Ka of acetic acid is 1.85x10^-5.', choice1='4.57; 6.92  ', choice2='4.26; 8.52', choice3='4.73; 7.00', choice4='3.17; 6.73  ', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: First, calculate the initial moles of acetic acid: 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid gives 0.001 moles (20.00 cm³ * 0.05 mol/L * 1 L/1000 cm³). After dilution with 20.00 cm³ of water, the concentration is halved, but this doesn't affect the titration process. At 25% titration, 0.00025 moles of NaOH are added (0.25 * 0.001 moles), leaving 0.00075 moles of acetic acid and forming 0.00025 moles of acetate. Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]) = 4.74 + log(0.00025/0.00075) = 4.26. At the equivalence point, all acetic acid is converted to acetate. The concentration of acetate is 0.001 moles in 40.00 cm³, or 0.025 M. The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of acetate: pH = 7 + 1/2(pKa - log(C)) = 7 + 1/2(4.74 - log(0.025)) = 8.52.
