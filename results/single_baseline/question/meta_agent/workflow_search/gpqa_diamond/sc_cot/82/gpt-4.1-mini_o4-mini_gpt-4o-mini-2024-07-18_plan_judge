Question: Example(question='We dilute 20.00 cm3 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm3 water, then titrate the resulting solution with 0.1M NaOH (25 °C). What will be the value of pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point? The Ka of acetic acid is 1.85x10^-5.', choice1='4.57; 6.92  ', choice2='4.26; 8.52', choice3='4.73; 7.00', choice4='3.17; 6.73  ', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: We start with 20.00 cm^3 of 0.05 M acetic acid: moles HA = 0.02 L × 0.05 M = 0.0010 mol. After dilution with 20.00 cm^3 water total V = 0.040 L so [HA]_initial = 0.025 M. At 25% titration, moles OH– added = 0.25×0.0010 = 0.00025 mol (V_NaOH = 0.00025/0.1 = 0.0025 L), new V = 0.0425 L. Remaining HA = 0.00075 mol→[HA]=0.01765 M; A–=0.00025 mol→[A–]=0.00588 M. pH = pKa + log([A–]/[HA]) = 4.733 + log(0.3333) = 4.26. At equivalence, moles A– = 0.0010 in V=0.050 L→[A–]=0.02 M. Kb = Kw/Ka = 1e–14/1.85e–5 = 5.405e–10. pOH = ½(pKb – log C) = ½(9.267 – (–1.699)) = 5.482, so pH = 14 – 5.482 = 8.52.
