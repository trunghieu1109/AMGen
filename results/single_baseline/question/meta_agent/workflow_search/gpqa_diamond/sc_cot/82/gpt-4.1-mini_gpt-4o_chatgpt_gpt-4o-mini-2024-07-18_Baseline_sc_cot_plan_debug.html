    <pre>First, we calculate the initial moles of acetic acid. We have 20.00 cm3 of 0.05 M acetic acid, so the moles of acetic acid are 0.05 mol/L * 0.020 L = 0.001 moles. After dilution with 20.00 cm3 of water, the total volume becomes 40.00 cm3 or 0.040 L, but the concentration remains unchanged for the purpose of titration as the number of moles is the same. At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid is neutralized. The moles of NaOH used are 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 moles. The moles of acetic acid remaining are 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. The moles of acetate ion formed are 0.00025 moles. Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]), where pKa = -log(1.85x10^-5) = 4.73. Therefore, pH = 4.73 + log(0.00025/0.00075) = 4.73 + log(1/3) = 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253, approximately 4.26. At the equivalence point, all acetic acid has been neutralized and we have a solution of sodium acetate. The concentration of acetate ion is 0.001 moles / 0.040 L = 0.025 M. The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of acetate: CH3COO- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH-. The Kb for acetate is Kw/Ka = 1.0x10^-14 / 1.85x10^-5 = 5.41x10^-10. Using the equation: [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * [A-]), [OH-] = sqrt(5.41x10^-10 * 0.025) = 1.16x10^-5. Therefore, pOH = -log(1.16x10^-5) = 4.94, and pH = 14 - pOH = 9.06. The closest choice for the equivalence point pH is 8.52.
