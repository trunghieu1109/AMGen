Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent ft3o', content='We start with 20.00 cm^3 of 0.05 M acetic acid: moles HA = 0.02 L × 0.05 M = 0.0010 mol. After dilution with 20.00 cm^3 water total V = 0.040 L so [HA]_initial = 0.025 M. At 25% titration, moles OH– added = 0.25×0.0010 = 0.00025 mol (V_NaOH = 0.00025/0.1 = 0.0025 L), new V = 0.0425 L. Remaining HA = 0.00075 mol→[HA]=0.01765 M; A–=0.00025 mol→[A–]=0.00588 M. pH = pKa + log([A–]/[HA]) = 4.733 + log(0.3333) = 4.26. At equivalence, moles A– = 0.0010 in V=0.050 L→[A–]=0.02 M. Kb = Kw/Ka = 1e–14/1.85e–5 = 5.405e–10. pOH = ½(pKb – log C) = ½(9.267 – (–1.699)) = 5.482, so pH = 14 – 5.482 = 8.52.\n\nAnswer:B)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
