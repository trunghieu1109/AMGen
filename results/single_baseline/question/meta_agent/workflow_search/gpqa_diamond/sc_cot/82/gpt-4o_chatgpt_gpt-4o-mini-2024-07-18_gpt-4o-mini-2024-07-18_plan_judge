Question: Example(question='We dilute 20.00 cm3 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm3 water, then titrate the resulting solution with 0.1M NaOH (25 Â°C). What will be the value of pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point? The Ka of acetic acid is 1.85x10^-5.', choice1='4.57; 6.92  ', choice2='4.26; 8.52', choice3='4.73; 7.00', choice4='3.17; 6.73  ', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point for the titration of acetic acid with NaOH, we first need to calculate the concentrations after dilution and then apply the relevant equations for weak acids and their titrations. At 25% titration, we will have a mixture of acetic acid and its conjugate base acetate, and we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. At the equivalence point, all acetic acid will have been converted to acetate, and we will need to find the pH based on the concentration of acetate in the solution and its hydrolysis. After performing the calculations, we will compare the results with the given choices.
