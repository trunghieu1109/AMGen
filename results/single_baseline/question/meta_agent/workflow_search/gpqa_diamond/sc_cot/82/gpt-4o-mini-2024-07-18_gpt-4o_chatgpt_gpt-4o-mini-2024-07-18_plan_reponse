        "response": "First, calculate the initial moles of acetic acid: 20.00 cm\u00b3 of 0.05 M acetic acid gives 0.001 moles (20.00 cm\u00b3 * 0.05 mol/L * 1 L/1000 cm\u00b3). After dilution with 20.00 cm\u00b3 of water, the concentration is halved, but this doesn't affect the titration process. At 25% titration, 0.00025 moles of NaOH are added (0.25 * 0.001 moles), leaving 0.00075 moles of acetic acid and forming 0.00025 moles of acetate. Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]) = 4.74 + log(0.00025/0.00075) = 4.26. At the equivalence point, all acetic acid is converted to acetate. The concentration of acetate is 0.001 moles in 40.00 cm\u00b3, or 0.025 M. The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of acetate: pH = 7 + 1/2(pKa - log(C)) = 7 + 1/2(4.74 - log(0.025)) = 8.52.\n\nAnswer:B",
