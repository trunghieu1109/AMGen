    <pre>To determine which exoplanet has the highest density, we need to calculate the density of each option based on their mass and volume. Density is defined as mass divided by volume. For planets with the same composition as Earth, we can use Earth&#39;s density as a reference. The volume of a sphere (which we can approximate the planets to be) is given by the formula V = (4/3)Ï€r^3. The density of a planet can be calculated as follows:

1. Option a: An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet has a density of 5.5 g/cm^3 (same as Earth).
2. Option b: A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm^3 has a density of 5.5 g/cm^3.
3. Option c: A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth. The volume increases as the cube of the radius, so if the mass increases by 5 times, the radius increases by the cube root of 5, leading to a lower density than Earth.
4. Option d: A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth will also have a density of 5.5 g/cm^3.

From this analysis, options a, b, and d have the same density as Earth (5.5 g/cm^3), while option c will have a lower density due to its larger volume relative to its mass. Therefore, the options with the highest density are a, b, and d, but since a and b are both at 5.5 g/cm^3, they are the highest densities. However, since the question asks for the highest density among the given options and option c has a lower density, we can conclude that options a and b are tied for the highest density, but since the question asks for one, we can choose option b as it clearly states a density value.
