Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent sUdM', content='We compare densities of each choice: \n(a) Earth-mass, Earth-radius gives density ≈5.5 g/cm³. \n(b) 2 Earth masses but density ≈5.5 g/cm³ (given), so same density as Earth. \n(c) Same composition as Earth but 5× Earth mass: higher internal pressure leads to greater compression, so density >5.5 g/cm³. \n(d) Same composition but 0.5× Earth mass: less self-compression, so density <5.5 g/cm³. \nThus the 5-Earth-mass planet (option C) has the highest density.\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
