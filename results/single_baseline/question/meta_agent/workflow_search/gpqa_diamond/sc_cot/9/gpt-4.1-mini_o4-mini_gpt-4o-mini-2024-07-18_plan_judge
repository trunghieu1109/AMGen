Question: Example(question='Among the following exoplanets, which one has the highest density?\n\na) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet.\nb) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm^3.\nc) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth.\nd) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth.', choice1='a', choice2='c', choice3='b', choice4='d', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: We compare densities of each choice: 
(a) Earth-mass, Earth-radius gives density ≈5.5 g/cm³. 
(b) 2 Earth masses but density ≈5.5 g/cm³ (given), so same density as Earth. 
(c) Same composition as Earth but 5× Earth mass: higher internal pressure leads to greater compression, so density >5.5 g/cm³. 
(d) Same composition but 0.5× Earth mass: less self-compression, so density <5.5 g/cm³. 
Thus the 5-Earth-mass planet (option C) has the highest density.

Answer:C)
Extracted answer: C)
Correct answer: 2
