Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To determine which exoplanet has the highest density, we need to consider the mass and volume (or radius) of each planet, as density is defined as mass divided by volume. 

- Option a) is an Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet, which would have the same density as Earth, approximately 5.5 g/cm^3.

- Option b) is a planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm^3. This density is given directly and is the same as Earth's density.

- Option c) is a planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. Typically, a planet with more mass but the same composition would be slightly more dense due to gravitational compression, but without knowing the exact radius, we can't be sure it's denser than option b.

- Option d) is a planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass. This would likely have a lower density than Earth due to less gravitational compression.

Since option b) directly states the density as 5.5 g/cm^3, and option c) might be denser due to gravitational compression, but without specific data, we can't be sure.

Therefore, the answer is likely to be option c) because a more massive planet with the same composition as Earth is likely to have a higher density due to gravitational compression.
