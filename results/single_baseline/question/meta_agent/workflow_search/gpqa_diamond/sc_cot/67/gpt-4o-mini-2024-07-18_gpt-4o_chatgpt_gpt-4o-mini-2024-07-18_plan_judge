Question: Example(question='There is a spin 1/2 particle with magnetic moment mu (= gamma*Sz), aligned with a magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction. Suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction; both fields have the same magnitude, B. The average of the z-component of the particleâ€™s moment starts oscillating. What is its oscillation frequency?', choice1='gamma*B/2', choice2='gamma*B', choice3='gamma*B/sqrt(2)', choice4='sqrt(2)*gamma*B', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The problem involves a spin 1/2 particle with a magnetic moment in a magnetic field. Initially, the magnetic field is in the +Z direction, and the particle's magnetic moment is aligned with it. Then the field is switched to the +Y direction. The oscillation frequency of the z-component of the magnetic moment is determined by the Larmor precession frequency, which is given by the formula omega = gamma * B, where gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio and B is the magnitude of the magnetic field. Therefore, the oscillation frequency is gamma*B.
