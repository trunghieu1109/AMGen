Question: Example(question='There is a spin 1/2 particle with magnetic moment mu (= gamma*Sz), aligned with a magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction. Suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction; both fields have the same magnitude, B. The average of the z-component of the particleâ€™s moment starts oscillating. What is its oscillation frequency?', choice1='gamma*B/2', choice2='gamma*B', choice3='gamma*B/sqrt(2)', choice4='sqrt(2)*gamma*B', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: When the magnetic field is aligned with the +Z direction, the magnetic moment of the spin 1/2 particle is also aligned with it. When the field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction, the system will undergo precession around the new magnetic field direction. The oscillation frequency of the z-component of the magnetic moment is determined by the Larmor frequency, which is given by the formula omega = gamma * B, where B is the magnitude of the magnetic field. In this case, since the magnetic field is now in the +Y direction, the oscillation frequency of the z-component will still be omega = gamma * B. Therefore, the oscillation frequency is gamma * B.

Answer:gamma*B
Extracted answer: gamma*B
Correct answer: 2
