Question: {'question': 'There is a spin 1/2 particle with magnetic moment mu (= gamma*Sz), aligned with a magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction. Suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction; both fields have the same magnitude, B. The average of the z-component of the particle’s moment starts oscillating. What is its oscillation frequency?', 'choice1': 'gamma*B/2', 'choice2': 'gamma*B', 'choice3': 'gamma*B/sqrt(2)', 'choice4': 'sqrt(2)*gamma*B'}\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent moGY', content='Initially the spin is polarized along Z in a field B_z. When that field is switched off and replaced by a field of equal magnitude along Y, the Hamiltonian becomes H=−γS·B=−γB S_y. For a spin-½, S_y=(ħ/2)σ_y, so H induces Larmor precession about Y with angular frequency ω=γB. The z-component then oscillates as cos(ωt).\n\nAnswer:B)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
