            "There is a spin 1/2 particle with magnetic moment mu (= gamma*Sz), aligned with a magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction. Suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction; both fields have the same magnitude, B. The average of the z-component of the particle\u2019s moment starts oscillating. What is its oscillation frequency?",

        "response": "When the magnetic field is aligned with the +Z direction, the magnetic moment of the spin 1/2 particle is also aligned with it. When the field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction, the system will undergo precession around the new magnetic field direction. The oscillation frequency of the z-component of the magnetic moment is determined by the Larmor frequency, which is given by the formula omega = gamma * B, where B is the magnitude of the magnetic field. In this case, since the magnetic field is now in the +Y direction, the oscillation frequency of the z-component will still be omega = gamma * B. Therefore, the oscillation frequency is gamma * B.\n\nAnswer:gamma*B",
