    <pre>When the magnetic field is aligned with the +Z direction, the magnetic moment of the spin 1/2 particle is also aligned with it. When the field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction, the system will undergo precession around the new magnetic field direction. The oscillation frequency of the z-component of the magnetic moment is determined by the Larmor frequency, which is given by the formula omega = gamma * B, where B is the magnitude of the magnetic field. In this case, since the magnetic field is now in the +Y direction, the oscillation frequency of the z-component will still be omega = gamma * B. Therefore, the oscillation frequency is gamma * B.

Answer:gamma*B</pre>
