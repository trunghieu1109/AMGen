            "There is a spin 1/2 particle with magnetic moment mu (= gamma*Sz), aligned with a magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction. Suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction; both fields have the same magnitude, B. The average of the z-component of the particle\u2019s moment starts oscillating. What is its oscillation frequency?",

        "response": "Initially the spin is polarized along Z in a field B_z. When that field is switched off and replaced by a field of equal magnitude along Y, the Hamiltonian becomes H=\u2212\u03b3S\u00b7B=\u2212\u03b3B S_y. For a spin-\u00bd, S_y=(\u0127/2)\u03c3_y, so H induces Larmor precession about Y with angular frequency \u03c9=\u03b3B. The z-component then oscillates as cos(\u03c9t).\n\nAnswer:B)",
