Question: Example(question='There is a spin 1/2 particle with magnetic moment mu (= gamma*Sz), aligned with a magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction. Suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction; both fields have the same magnitude, B. The average of the z-component of the particle’s moment starts oscillating. What is its oscillation frequency?', choice1='gamma*B/2', choice2='gamma*B', choice3='gamma*B/sqrt(2)', choice4='sqrt(2)*gamma*B', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: Initially the spin is polarized along Z in a field B_z. When that field is switched off and replaced by a field of equal magnitude along Y, the Hamiltonian becomes H=−γS·B=−γB S_y. For a spin-½, S_y=(ħ/2)σ_y, so H induces Larmor precession about Y with angular frequency ω=γB. The z-component then oscillates as cos(ωt).
