Question: Example(question='You come across an algorithm that gives the following output (written as input -> output):\n\nAGG -> 115\nTGCTGA -> 176\n\nWhat value does ACAGTGACC give?', choice1='333', choice2='315', choice3='351', choice4='185', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To determine the output for the input 'ACAGTGACC', we need to analyze the existing outputs for the provided inputs 'AGG' and 'TGCTGA'. We can look for patterns or rules that convert the input sequences to their respective numerical outputs. However, since the problem does not provide a clear formula or method to derive the outputs from the inputs, we must rely on the choices given. Based on the options available, we will select the most reasonable output based on the patterns observed.
