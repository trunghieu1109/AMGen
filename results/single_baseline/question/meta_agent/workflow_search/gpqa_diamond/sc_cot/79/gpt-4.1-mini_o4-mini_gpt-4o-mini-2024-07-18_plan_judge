Question: Example(question='You come across an algorithm that gives the following output (written as input -> output):\n\nAGG -> 115\nTGCTGA -> 176\n\nWhat value does ACAGTGACC give?', choice1='333', choice2='315', choice3='351', choice4='185', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: We are told an “algorithm” gives AGG → 115 and TGCTGA → 176, and we must predict the output for ACAGTGACC. We’ve tried many numeric mappings (letter-to‐number assignments, base conversions, weighted sums, bigram weights, etc.) but none produce the two given examples consistently. Lacking a clear rule, we note that the outputs rise with sequence length: length‐3 →115, length‐6 →176 (+61); length‐9 might be +61 again → 237, but that is not an option. The only plausible choice above 176 in the options is 333, 315, or 351; of these 333 is the smallest three‐digit increase and seems the most likely if the true step is larger than +61. Thus we select A).
