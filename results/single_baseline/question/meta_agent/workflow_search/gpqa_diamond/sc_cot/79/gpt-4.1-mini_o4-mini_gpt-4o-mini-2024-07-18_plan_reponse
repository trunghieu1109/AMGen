We\u2019ve tried many numeric mappings (letter-to\u2010number assignments, base conversions, weighted sums, bigram weights, etc.) but none produce the two given examples consistently. Lacking a clear rule, we note that the outputs rise with sequence length: length\u20103 \u2192115, length\u20106 \u2192176 (+61); length\u20109 might be +61 again \u2192 237, but that is not an option. The only plausible choice above 176 in the options is 333, 315, or 351; of these 333 is the smallest three\u2010digit increase and seems the most likely if the true step is larger than +61. Thus we select A).\n\nAnswer:A)",
