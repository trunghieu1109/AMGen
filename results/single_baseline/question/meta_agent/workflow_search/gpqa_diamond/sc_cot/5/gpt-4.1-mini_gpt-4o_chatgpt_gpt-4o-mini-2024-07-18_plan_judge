proposed answer: The given potential V(r, θ) can be rewritten as V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr^2(1 + 3cos^2(θ)). This potential suggests a 2D isotropic harmonic oscillator with an angular dependence. The potential can be separated into radial and angular parts. The radial part resembles a 2D harmonic oscillator, and the angular part modifies the effective spring constant in the radial direction. The energy levels for a 2D harmonic oscillator are given by E = (n_x + n_y + 1)ℏω, where ω = sqrt(k/m). The angular dependence modifies the energy levels, but the form of the energy levels remains similar to a 2D oscillator, with the modification affecting the coefficients of n_x and n_y. The correct expression for the energy levels considering the given potential will be in the form E = (an_x + bn_y + c)ℏsqrt(k/m). By inspecting the choices and the structure of the potential, we determine the correct coefficients.
