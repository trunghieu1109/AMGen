proposed answer: The potential given is V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr^2 + (3/2)kr^2 cos^2(θ). This can be seen as a harmonic oscillator potential with anisotropy in the angular part. The radial part is a standard 2D harmonic oscillator potential, while the angular part introduces an additional term that can be treated as a perturbation. In the absence of the angular term, the energy levels of a 2D isotropic harmonic oscillator are given by E = (n_x + n_y + 1)ℏω, where ω = sqrt(k/m). The angular term splits the degeneracy and modifies the energy levels. By examining the symmetry and comparing the choices, we find that the correct energy spectrum considers the anisotropy introduced by the cos^2(θ) term. The choice that matches this consideration is choice 1.
