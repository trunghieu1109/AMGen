proposed answer: To identify the compound C9H11NO2, we analyze the provided IR and NMR data. The IR spectrum shows medium to strong bands at 3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1, which are indicative of NH or OH groups, followed by a strong band at 1720 cm-1 that suggests the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O). The 1H NMR spectrum indicates multiple signals: a triplet at 1.20 ppm (3H) suggests a methyl group adjacent to a methylene, a broad signal at 4.0 ppm (2H) could indicate an NH or an alcohol, a quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) indicates a methylene group adjacent to an electronegative atom, and two doublets at 7.0 ppm (2H) and 8.0 ppm (2H) suggest the presence of aromatic protons. Considering the options, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate fits the molecular formula and the NMR data well, as it has the necessary functional groups and the correct number of protons. Therefore, the correct identification of the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.
