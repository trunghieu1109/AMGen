        "response": "To identify the compound C9H11NO2, let's analyze the given data. The IR spectrum shows medium to strong intensity bands at 3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1, which are indicative of N-H stretching vibrations, suggesting the presence of an amine or amide group. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 indicates a C=O stretching vibration, suggesting an ester or amide carbonyl group. The 1H NMR data shows: 1.20 ppm (t, 3H), which is likely a CH3 group adjacent to a CH2; 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H), which could be an NH2; 4.5 ppm (q, 2H), likely a CH2 adjacent to an oxygen (ethyl group); 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), indicating a para-substituted aromatic ring. Considering these data, we look for a compound with an ethyl group, an aromatic ring, an amine or amide group, and a carbonyl. Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate (choice 4) fits this description: it has an ethyl ester (hence the CH3 triplet at 1.20 ppm and CH2 quartet at 4.5 ppm), an aromatic ring with para substitution (7.0 ppm and 8.0 ppm doublets), and an amine group (broad singlet at 4.0 ppm and NH stretching in IR).\n\nAnswer:D)",
