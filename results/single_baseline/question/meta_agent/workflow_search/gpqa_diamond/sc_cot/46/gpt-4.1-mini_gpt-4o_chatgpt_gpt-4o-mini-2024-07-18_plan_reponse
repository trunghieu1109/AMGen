        "response": "The IR spectrum shows bands at 3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1, which are indicative of N-H stretching, suggesting the presence of an amine or amide. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 indicates a carbonyl group, likely an ester or amide. The 1H NMR spectrum has a triplet at 1.20 ppm (3H), suggesting a CH3 group adjacent to a CH2. The broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H) could correspond to NH2 protons. The quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) suggests a CH2 group adjacent to the CH3 group, typical of an ethyl group. The doublets at 7.0 ppm (2H) and 8.0 ppm (2H) suggest an aromatic ring with substitution, such as a para-substituted benzene. Based on the data, the compound is likely ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, which fits the NMR and IR data.\n\nAnswer:D)",
