        "response": "We have a point charge q at distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius R. The method of images replaces the sphere by an image charge q' = -q R/d located at distance R^2/d from the center. The interaction energy between the real charge and its image, divided by 2 (because the image is not a real charge but enforces boundary conditions), gives the net potential energy: U = (1/2)\u22c5q\u22c5[k q'/(d - R^2/d)]. Substituting q' and simplifying: q' = -qR/d; separation = (d^2 - R^2)/d; so potential due to image at real charge: k(-qR/d)/((d^2 - R^2)/d) = -kqR/(d^2 - R^2). Thus U = (1/2) q\u22c5[-kqR/(d^2 - R^2)] = -\u00bd k q^2 R/(d^2 - R^2).\n\nAnswer:A)",
