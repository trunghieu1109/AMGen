        "response": "To find the net potential energy of the system with a charge q placed at a distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius R, we need to consider the method of images. The potential energy can be derived from the interaction between the charge and the induced charges on the sphere. The correct formula for the potential energy in this scenario is typically derived from the image charge method, which leads to the expression for potential energy based on the distance and the radius of the sphere. The correct choice must reflect the proper derivation of the potential energy in this configuration.\n\nAnswer:B",
