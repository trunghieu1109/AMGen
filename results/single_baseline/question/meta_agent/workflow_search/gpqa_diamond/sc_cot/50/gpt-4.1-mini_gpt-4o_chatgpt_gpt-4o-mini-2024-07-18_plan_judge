Question: Example(question='If a charge q is placed d distance away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius R. Calculate the net potential energy of this system.', choice1='U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)', choice2='U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)', choice3='U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)', choice4='U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: To find the net potential energy of the system, we can use the method of image charges. For a charge q placed at a distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius R, the image charge method involves placing an image charge q' at a distance R^2/d from the center of the sphere along the line joining the center and the charge q. The magnitude of the image charge q' is given by q' = -qR/d. The potential energy of the system is then given by the interaction energy between the real charge q and the image charge q'. The distance between the real charge q and the image charge q' is d - R^2/d. The potential energy is U = k * q * q' / (d - R^2/d). Substituting q' = -qR/d, we get U = -kq^2R/(d^2 - R^2). However, this is only half the potential energy since the sphere is grounded, so we take half of this result to get the net potential energy: U = -(1/2) * kq^2R/(d^2 - R^2).
