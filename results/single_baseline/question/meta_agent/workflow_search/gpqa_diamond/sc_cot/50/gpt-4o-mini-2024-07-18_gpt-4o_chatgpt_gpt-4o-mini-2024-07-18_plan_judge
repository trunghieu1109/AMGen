proposed answer: To solve this problem, we consider the method of image charges. When a charge q is placed at a distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius R, an image charge q' is considered to be placed inside the sphere to satisfy the boundary conditions of the problem (the potential on the surface of the sphere is zero). The image charge q' is placed at a distance R^2/d from the center of the sphere, and its magnitude is -qR/d. The potential energy of the system can be calculated as the interaction energy between the real charge q and the image charge q'. The potential energy U is given by the expression U = k * q * q' / |d - R^2/d|, where k is Coulomb's constant. Substituting q' = -qR/d and simplifying gives U = -kq^2 R/(d^2 - R^2). Since the sphere is grounded, the factor of 1/2 comes into play due to the method of images, leading to the expression U = -(1/2) * kq^2 R/(d^2 - R^2).
