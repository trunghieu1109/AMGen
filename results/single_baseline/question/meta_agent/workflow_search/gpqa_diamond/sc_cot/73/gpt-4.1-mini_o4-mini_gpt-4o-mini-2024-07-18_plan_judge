Question: Example(question='We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.\nSo far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? ', choice1='52%', choice2='48%', choice3='44%', choice4='40%', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: We have an exponential decay with P(decay within 100 min)=0.32 ⇒ λ = –(1/100)ln(0.68). By memoryless property, P(decay in next 150 min)=1–e^(–λ·150)=1–(e^(–λ·100))^1.5=1–0.68^1.5≈1–0.5607≈0.4393≈44%.
