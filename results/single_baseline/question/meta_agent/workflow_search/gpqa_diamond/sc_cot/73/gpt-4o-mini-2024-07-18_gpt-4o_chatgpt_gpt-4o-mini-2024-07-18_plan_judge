Question: Example(question='We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.\nSo far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? ', choice1='52%', choice2='48%', choice3='44%', choice4='40%', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The problem involves calculating the conditional probability of decay given that the atom has not decayed in the first 50 minutes. We know the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%. This implies the probability of not decaying within 100 minutes is 68%. Since the atom has not decayed in the first 50 minutes, we need to find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes. The survival probability for the first 50 minutes is unknown, but we can express the decay probability for 150 minutes as a function of the decay constant. If we assume exponential decay, the probability of decay in time t is P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt). Given P(100) = 0.32, we can find λ. After finding λ, we compute the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes given survival for 50 minutes.
