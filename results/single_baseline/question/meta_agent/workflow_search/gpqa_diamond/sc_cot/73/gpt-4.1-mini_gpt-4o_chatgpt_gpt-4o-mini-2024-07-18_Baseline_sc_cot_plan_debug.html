    <pre>We are given that the decay probability of the atom is 32% within 100 minutes. This implies a decay constant \( \lambda \) such that \( 1 - e^{-\lambda \times 100} = 0.32 \). The probability that the atom has not decayed after 50 minutes is \( e^{-\lambda \times 50} \). We want to find the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes given it has survived 50 minutes. This is the conditional probability: \( P(\text{decay in next 150 min} | \text{survived 50 min}) = \frac{P(\text{decay in 200 min})}{P(\text{survived 50 min})} \). First, find \( P(\text{decay in 200 min}) = 1 - e^{-\lambda \times 200} \) and \( P(\text{survived 50 min}) = e^{-\lambda \times 50} \). Then, \( P(\text{decay in next 150 min} | \text{survived 50 min}) = \frac{1 - e^{-\lambda \times 200}}{e^{-\lambda \times 50}} = 1 - e^{-\lambda \times 150} \). We need to find \( \lambda \) from \( 1 - e^{-\lambda \times 100} = 0.32 \), which gives \( e^{-\lambda \times 100} = 0.68 \), so \( \lambda = -\frac{\ln(0.68)}{100} \). Now, \( e^{-\lambda \times 150} = (e^{-\lambda \times 100})^{1.5} = 0.68^{1.5} \). Calculate \( 0.68^{1.5} \) to find the probability that the atom has not decayed in the next 150 minutes, then subtract from 1 to find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes.
