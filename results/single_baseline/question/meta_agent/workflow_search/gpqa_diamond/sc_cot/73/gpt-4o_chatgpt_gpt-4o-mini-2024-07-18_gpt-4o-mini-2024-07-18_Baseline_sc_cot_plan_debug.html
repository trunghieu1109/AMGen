    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.\nSo far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? &#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;52%&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;48%&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;44%&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;40%&#39;}

    <pre>To find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes given that it has not decayed in the first 50 minutes, we can use the concept of conditional probability and the exponential decay model. The decay probability of 32% in 100 minutes implies a decay constant. The probability of not decaying in 100 minutes is 68%, or 0.68. The probability of surviving for 50 minutes is the square root of the probability of surviving 100 minutes, which is approximately 0.82. Thus, the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes can be calculated using the remaining survival probability and the decay probability over the next 150 minutes. After calculating, we find that the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is 52%.
