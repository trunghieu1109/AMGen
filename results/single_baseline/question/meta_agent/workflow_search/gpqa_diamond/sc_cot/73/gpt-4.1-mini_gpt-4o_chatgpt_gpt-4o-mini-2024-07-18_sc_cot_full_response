Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent biy2', content='We are given that the decay probability of the atom is 32% within 100 minutes. This implies a decay constant \\( \\lambda \\) such that \\( 1 - e^{-\\lambda \\times 100} = 0.32 \\). The probability that the atom has not decayed after 50 minutes is \\( e^{-\\lambda \\times 50} \\). We want to find the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes given it has survived 50 minutes. This is the conditional probability: \\( P(\\text{decay in next 150 min} | \\text{survived 50 min}) = \\frac{P(\\text{decay in 200 min})}{P(\\text{survived 50 min})} \\). First, find \\( P(\\text{decay in 200 min}) = 1 - e^{-\\lambda \\times 200} \\) and \\( P(\\text{survived 50 min}) = e^{-\\lambda \\times 50} \\). Then, \\( P(\\text{decay in next 150 min} | \\text{survived 50 min}) = \\frac{1 - e^{-\\lambda \\times 200}}{e^{-\\lambda \\times 50}} = 1 - e^{-\\lambda \\times 150} \\). We need to find \\( \\lambda \\) from \\( 1 - e^{-\\lambda \\times 100} = 0.32 \\), which gives \\( e^{-\\lambda \\times 100} = 0.68 \\), so \\( \\lambda = -\\frac{\\ln(0.68)}{100} \\). Now, \\( e^{-\\lambda \\times 150} = (e^{-\\lambda \\times 100})^{1.5} = 0.68^{1.5} \\). Calculate \\( 0.68^{1.5} \\) to find the probability that the atom has not decayed in the next 150 minutes, then subtract from 1 to find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes.\n\nAnswer:52%', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
