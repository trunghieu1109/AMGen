            "A common approximation made in many-body nuclear calculations of some interaction (for example an electroweak interaction) is to suppose that nucleons in a nucleus behave in the same way as free nucleons. Which of the following four assumptions jointly imply this \"\"impulse\"\" approximation?\n\n1. The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.\n2. The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.\n3. The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.\n4. The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.",

        "response": "We need the minimal assumptions to treat nucleons in a nucleus as free during an interaction: (1) the current interacts only with individual nucleons, (2) no interactions with the rest of the nucleus (transparency apart from the struck nucleon), and (4) the struck nucleon feels no binding forces during the interaction. The nonrelativistic nature of the quarks (3) is irrelevant to the impulse approximation. Thus the required set is {1,2,4}, i.e. choice 4.\n\nAnswer:D)",
