    <pre>To determine which assumptions imply the &#39;impulse&#39; approximation, we need to consider what the impulse approximation entails. The impulse approximation assumes that the interaction can be treated as if it occurs with a free nucleon, ignoring the effects of the nuclear environment. Let&#39;s analyze each assumption:

1. The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons. This is important because it means we are considering the interaction as happening with a single nucleon, not involving the whole nucleus.

2. The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon. This means that the rest of the nucleus does not affect the interaction, which aligns with treating the nucleon as free.

3. The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic. This assumption is more about the internal structure of the nucleon and doesn&#39;t directly relate to the impulse approximation, which is more about the nucleon&#39;s interaction with the external probe.

4. The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces. This is a key part of the impulse approximation, as it implies the nucleon behaves as if it were free, not bound within the nucleus.

So, the relevant assumptions for the impulse approximation are 1, 2, and 4. Assumption 3 is not directly related to the concept of the impulse approximation as it pertains to the non-relativistic nature of quarks rather than the interaction dynamics.

Therefore, the correct choice is the one that includes assumptions 1, 2, and 4.
