    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;A common approximation made in many-body nuclear calculations of some interaction (for example an electroweak interaction) is to suppose that nucleons in a nucleus behave in the same way as free nucleons. Which of the following four assumptions jointly imply this &#34;&#34;impulse&#34;&#34; approximation?\n\n1. The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.\n2.

    <pre>To determine which assumptions imply the impulse approximation, we need to analyze each assumption in the context of treating nucleons as free particles. Assumption 1 suggests that interactions are localized to individual nucleons, which is consistent with the impulse approximation. Assumption 2 states that the nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon, which also supports the idea of treating the nucleon as free. Assumption 3 about quarks being non-relativistic is less relevant to the impulse approximation, which primarily concerns the nucleon as a whole rather than its internal structure. Assumption 4 directly states that the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces, which is a key aspect of treating it as free. Therefore, the correct set of assumptions that jointly imply the impulse approximation would be those that emphasize the independence of the selected nucleon from the rest of the nucleus, particularly assumptions 1, 2, and 4. Thus, the correct answer is choice 4, which includes assumptions 1, 2, and 4.
