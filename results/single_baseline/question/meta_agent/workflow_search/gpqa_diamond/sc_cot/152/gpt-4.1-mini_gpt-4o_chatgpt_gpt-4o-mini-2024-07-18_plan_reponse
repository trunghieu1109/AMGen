            "\u03b1-\u03b2 unsaturated carbonyls have a much more electrophilic carbon double bond. These double bonds act as a good Lewis acid and react with nucleophiles to produce enolate ions. In this case, when a nucleophile attacks the \u03b2 position, it produces a resonance-stabilized intermediate. When a nucleophile attacking the \u03b2-carbon is enolate, such reaction is known as the Michael reaction.\nWhat are the reactants and major final products of the following Michael addition reactions?\ndimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) -->(A)\n1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H3O+) --> (B)\nC + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H2O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione",

        "response": "To solve the given Michael addition reactions, we need to identify the reactants and the products formed in each case. The Michael addition involves the nucleophilic attack of an enolate ion on an \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated carbonyl compound, leading to the formation of a new carbon-carbon bond. Let's analyze each reaction:\n\n1. Reaction (A): Dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt, EtOH. Dimethyl malonate will form an enolate ion under basic conditions (NaOEt, EtOH) and attack the \u03b2-carbon of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. This results in the formation of trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate.\n\n2. Reaction (B): 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile in the presence of MeOH, H3O+. The enamine (from the cyclohexenyl moiety) acts as the nucleophile and attacks the \u03b2-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile, leading to the formation of 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile.\n\n3. Reaction with C: But-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H2O) with C being cyclohexane-1,3-dione. Cyclohexane-1,3-dione forms an enolate ion under basic conditions (KOH, H2O) and attacks the \u03b2-carbon of but-3-en-2-one, resulting in the formation of 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct choice is Choice 4.\n\nAnswer:D)",
