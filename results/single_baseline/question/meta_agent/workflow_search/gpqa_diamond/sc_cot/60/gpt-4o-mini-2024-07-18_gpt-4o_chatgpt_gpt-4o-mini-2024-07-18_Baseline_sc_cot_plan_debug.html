    <pre>Step 1: Benzene is treated with HNO3 and H2SO4, which is a nitration reaction, forming nitrobenzene (product 1). Step 2: Nitrobenzene is treated with Br2 and iron powder, which is a bromination reaction, forming m-bromonitrobenzene (product 2) because the nitro group is a meta-director. Step 3: m-Bromonitrobenzene is reduced with Pd/C under hydrogen, reducing the nitro group to an amine, forming m-bromoaniline (product 3). Step 4: m-Bromoaniline is treated with NaNO2 and HBF4, which is a diazotization reaction forming m-bromo-benzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate (product 4). Step 5: The diazonium salt is heated, causing loss of N2 and formation of m-bromo-fluorobenzene via the Schiemann reaction. Step 6: m-Bromo-fluorobenzene is treated with anisole, likely via a coupling reaction, to form a biphenyl compound with a methoxy group. The final product is 3-bromo-4&#39;-fluoro-1,1&#39;-biphenyl.
