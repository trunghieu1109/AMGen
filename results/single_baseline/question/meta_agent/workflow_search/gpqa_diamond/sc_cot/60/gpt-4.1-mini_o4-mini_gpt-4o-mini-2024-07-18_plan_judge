Question: Example(question='benzene is treated with HNO3 and H2SO4, forming product 1.\nproduct 1 is treated with Br2 and iron powder, forming product 2.\nproduct 2 is stirred with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere, forming product 3.\nProduct 3 is treated with NaNO2 and HBF4, forming product 4.\nProduct 4 is heated and then treated with anisole, forming final product 5.', choice1="3'-bromo-2-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl", choice2="3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl", choice3="4-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl", choice4="3-bromo-4'-fluoro-1,1'-biphenyl", correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: Step 1: Benzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrobenzene (meta director).
Step 2: Nitrobenzene + Br2/Fe → meta-bromonitrobenzene (3-bromonitrobenzene).
Step 3: 3-Bromonitrobenzene + H2/Pd-C → 3-bromoaniline.
Step 4: 3-Bromoaniline + NaNO2/HBF4 → 3-bromobenzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate.
Step 5: Heating the diazonium salt generates an aryl cation which electrophilically attacks anisole at its para position (most activated), yielding 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl.
