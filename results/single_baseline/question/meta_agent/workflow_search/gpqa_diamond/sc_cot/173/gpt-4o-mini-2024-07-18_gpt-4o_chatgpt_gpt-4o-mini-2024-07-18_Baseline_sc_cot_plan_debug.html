    <pre>First, let&#39;s denote the initial rest mass energy of the nucleus as E0 = 300 GeV. After fission, the total rest mass energy of the fragments is 0.99 * E0 = 297 GeV. Let the rest mass of the lighter fragment be m, and the rest mass of the heavier fragment be 2m. Thus, the sum of the rest masses is m + 2m = 3m, which is 297 GeV. Therefore, m = 99 GeV, and 2m = 198 GeV. The total kinetic energy released is the difference between the initial rest mass energy and the sum of the rest mass energies of the fragments, which is 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV. In the center of mass frame, the momentum of the two fragments must be equal and opposite. Let v1 and v2 be the velocities of the heavier and lighter fragments, respectively. Using conservation of momentum: (2m)v1 = (m)v2, so v2 = 2v1. The total kinetic energy is given by T = T1 + T2 = 3 GeV. Using relativistic expressions for kinetic energy, T1 = ((2m)c^2/sqrt(1-(v1^2/c^2))) - 2mc^2 and T2 = (mc^2/sqrt(1-(v2^2/c^2))) - mc^2. Solving these with the given conditions, we find the relativistic T1. For the classical approximation, T1_classical = 0.5 * (2m) * v1^2. The difference between the relativistic and classical T1 values is found to be 10 MeV.
