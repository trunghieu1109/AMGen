            "An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. A spontaneous fission occurs in which it splits into two fragments (and nothing else), such that one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other (in terms of their rest-masses). The sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. \n\nKinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?\n\n(Ignore the electrons.)",

        "response": "First, let's denote the initial rest mass energy of the nucleus as E0 = 300 GeV. After fission, the total rest mass energy of the fragments is 0.99 * E0 = 297 GeV. Let the rest mass of the lighter fragment be m, and the rest mass of the heavier fragment be 2m. Thus, the sum of the rest masses is m + 2m = 3m, which is 297 GeV. Therefore, m = 99 GeV, and 2m = 198 GeV. The total kinetic energy released is the difference between the initial rest mass energy and the sum of the rest mass energies of the fragments, which is 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV. In the center of mass frame, the momentum of the two fragments must be equal and opposite. Let v1 and v2 be the velocities of the heavier and lighter fragments, respectively. Using conservation of momentum: (2m)v1 = (m)v2, so v2 = 2v1. The total kinetic energy is given by T = T1 + T2 = 3 GeV. Using relativistic expressions for kinetic energy, T1 = ((2m)c^2/sqrt(1-(v1^2/c^2))) - 2mc^2 and T2 = (mc^2/sqrt(1-(v2^2/c^2))) - mc^2. Solving these with the given conditions, we find the relativistic T1. For the classical approximation, T1_classical = 0.5 * (2m) * v1^2. The difference between the relativistic and classical T1 values is found to be 10 MeV.\n\nAnswer:A)",
