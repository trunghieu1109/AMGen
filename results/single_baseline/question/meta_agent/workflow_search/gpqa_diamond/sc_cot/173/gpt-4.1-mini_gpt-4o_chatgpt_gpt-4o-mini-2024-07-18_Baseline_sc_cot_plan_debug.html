    <pre>First, we need to determine the rest masses of the two fragments. Let m1 be the rest mass of the more massive fragment and m2 be the rest mass of the less massive fragment. Given that m1 = 2 * m2 and m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M, we can solve for m1 and m2. We find that m2 = 0.33 * M and m1 = 0.66 * M. The initial rest-mass energy is 300 GeV, so 0.99 * M corresponds to 297 GeV. The total energy must be conserved, so the kinetic energy released is 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV. In the center of mass frame, the fragments move with equal and opposite momentum. Using relativistic energy-momentum conservation, we find the kinetic energies of the fragments. For the more massive fragment, T1 (relativistic) is found using the energy-momentum relation. The classical approximation would ignore relativistic effects, leading to a different value for T1. The difference between these values is typically small, on the order of MeV, depending on the mass ratios and total energy.
