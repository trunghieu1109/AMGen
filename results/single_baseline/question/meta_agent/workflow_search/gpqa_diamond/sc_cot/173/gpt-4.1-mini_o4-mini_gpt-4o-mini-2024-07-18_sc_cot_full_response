Question: {'question': 'An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. A spontaneous fission occurs in which it splits into two fragments (and nothing else), such that one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other (in terms of their rest-masses). The sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. \n\nKinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?\n\n(Ignore the electrons.)', 'choice1': '10 MeV.', 'choice2': '5 MeV.', 'choice3': '2 MeV.', 'choice4': '20 MeV.'}\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent fUCm', content='Let M c^2=300 GeV. After fission m1=2m2 and m1+m2=0.99M ⇒ m1=0.66M (198 GeV/c²), m2=0.33M (99 GeV/c²).
