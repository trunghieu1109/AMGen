Question: Example(question='An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. A spontaneous fission occurs in which it splits into two fragments (and nothing else), such that one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other (in terms of their rest-masses). The sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. \n\nKinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?\n\n(Ignore the electrons.)', choice1='10 MeV.', choice2='5 MeV.', choice3='2 MeV.', choice4='20 MeV.', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: Let M c^2=300 GeV. After fission m1=2m2 and m1+m2=0.99M ⇒ m1=0.66M (198 GeV/c²), m2=0.33M (99 GeV/c²). The mass defect Q=Mc²–(m1+m2)c²=0.01Mc²=3 GeV.\nClassically, KE1=Q·m2/(m1+m2)=3 GeV·(0.33/0.99)=1 GeV.\nRelativistically, for two-body decay at rest: E1=(M²+m1²–m2²)c²/(2M)=((300²+198²–99²)/(2·300)) GeV=199.005 GeV ⇒ T1=E1–m1c²=1.005 GeV.\nDifference=T1_rel–T1_class=1.005 GeV–1.000 GeV=0.005 GeV=5 MeV.
