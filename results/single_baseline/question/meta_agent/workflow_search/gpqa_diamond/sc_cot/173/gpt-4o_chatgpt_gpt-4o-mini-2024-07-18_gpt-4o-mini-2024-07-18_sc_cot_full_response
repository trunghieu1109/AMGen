Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent PCH6', content='To solve this problem, we first need to understand the situation described. We have an atomic nucleus with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV, which means its rest mass M can be calculated using E = mc^2. The nucleus splits into two fragments, one of mass m1 and the other of mass m2, where m1 = 2m2. The total rest mass of the fragments is 99% of M. Therefore, we can set up the equations to find the rest masses of the fragments and then their kinetic energies after the fission. We will compare the relativistic kinetic energy with the classical kinetic energy to find the difference. After calculating, we find that the difference between the correct T1 value and the classical approximation gives us the answer.\n\nAnswer:20 MeV.', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
