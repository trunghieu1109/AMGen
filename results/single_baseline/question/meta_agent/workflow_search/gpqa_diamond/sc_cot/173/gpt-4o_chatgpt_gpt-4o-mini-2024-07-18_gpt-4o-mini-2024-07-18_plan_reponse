            "An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. A spontaneous fission occurs in which it splits into two fragments (and nothing else), such that one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other (in terms of their rest-masses). The sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. \n\nKinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?\n\n(Ignore the electrons.)",

        "response": "To solve this problem, we first need to understand the situation described. We have an atomic nucleus with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV, which means its rest mass M can be calculated using E = mc^2. The nucleus splits into two fragments, one of mass m1 and the other of mass m2, where m1 = 2m2. The total rest mass of the fragments is 99% of M. Therefore, we can set up the equations to find the rest masses of the fragments and then their kinetic energies after the fission. We will compare the relativistic kinetic energy with the classical kinetic energy to find the difference. After calculating, we find that the difference between the correct T1 value and the classical approximation gives us the answer.\n\nAnswer:20 MeV.",
