Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent xMjR', content='We need a molecule with a threefold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane, but no vertical mirrors. Quinuclidine is bicyclic with low symmetry. The large fused-trifuran hexaones have complex π systems but are not simple C3h. Triisopropyl borate, B(O-iPr)3, has a trigonal arrangement around B (C3 axis) and a mirror plane through the B and the three O atoms (horizontal plane). The isopropyl groups are identical and each has a mirror in its own O–C–C plane, but there are no vertical mirrors for the whole molecule, giving C3h symmetry.\n\nAnswer:B)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
