proposed answer: To determine which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry, we need to analyze their structures. C3h symmetry indicates a molecule has a three-fold rotational axis and a horizontal mirror plane. Quinuclidine is known to have C3 symmetry due to its bicyclic structure. Triisopropyl borate has a more complex structure and does not exhibit C3h symmetry. The other two compounds also do not exhibit C3h symmetry due to their more complex arrangements. Therefore, quinuclidine is the only molecule among the choices that fits the criteria for C3h symmetry.
