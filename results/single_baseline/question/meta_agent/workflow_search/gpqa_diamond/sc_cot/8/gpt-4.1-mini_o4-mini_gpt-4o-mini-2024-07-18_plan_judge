Question: Example(question="which of the following molecules has c3h symmetry?\ntriisopropyl borate\nquinuclidine\nbenzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone\ntriphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone", choice1='quinuclidine', choice2='triisopropyl borate\n', choice3="benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone", choice4="triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone", correct_index=4)

proposed answer: We need a molecule with a threefold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane, but no vertical mirrors. Quinuclidine is bicyclic with low symmetry. The large fused-trifuran hexaones have complex π systems but are not simple C3h. Triisopropyl borate, B(O-iPr)3, has a trigonal arrangement around B (C3 axis) and a mirror plane through the B and the three O atoms (horizontal plane). The isopropyl groups are identical and each has a mirror in its own O–C–C plane, but there are no vertical mirrors for the whole molecule, giving C3h symmetry.
