        "response": "We need a molecule with a threefold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane, but no vertical mirrors. Quinuclidine is bicyclic with low symmetry. The large fused-trifuran hexaones have complex \u03c0 systems but are not simple C3h. Triisopropyl borate, B(O-iPr)3, has a trigonal arrangement around B (C3 axis) and a mirror plane through the B and the three O atoms (horizontal plane). The isopropyl groups are identical and each has a mirror in its own O\u2013C\u2013C plane, but there are no vertical mirrors for the whole molecule, giving C3h symmetry.\n\nAnswer:B)",
