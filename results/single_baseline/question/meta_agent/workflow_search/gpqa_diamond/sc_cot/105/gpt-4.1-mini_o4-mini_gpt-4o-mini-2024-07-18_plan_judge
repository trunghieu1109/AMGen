Question: Example(question='The reaction between cyclohexanone and piperidine can result in the formation of a cyclic imine, also known as a Schiff base. This type of reaction is a classic example of imine formation, which involves the condensation of a ketone (cyclohexanone in this case) with a primary amine (piperidine) in the presence of an acid catalyst.\nWhat will be the favorable acid used (A) and the final product (B) of the following reaction?\nCyclohexanone + piperidine + (A, acrylaldehyde, H3O+) ---> B', choice1='A = TsOH, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)propanal', choice2='A = HCl, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)propanal', choice3='A = TsOH, B = 1-(2-(3-oxopropyl)cyclohexylidene)piperidin-1-ium', choice4='A = HCl, B = 1-(2-(3-oxopropyl)cyclohexylidene)piperidin-1-ium', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: The reaction of cyclohexanone with piperidine (a secondary amine) proceeds via enamine formation rather than imine formation. Enamines form under mild acid catalysis that doesn’t overly protonate the amine. p-Toluenesulfonic acid (TsOH) is a suitable organic acid catalyst, whereas strong mineral acids like HCl would protonate piperidine and suppress enamine formation. The enamine generated from cyclohexanone and piperidine then undergoes conjugate addition (Michael addition) to acrylaldehyde; subsequent hydrolysis yields the γ-keto aldehyde 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)propanal. Thus, A = TsOH and B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)propanal, corresponding to choice A).
