Based on the infromation estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of electron.", choice1='~10^(-19) J', choice2='~10^(-18) J', choice3='~10^(-16) J', choice4='~10^(-17) J', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: To find the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of the electron, we can use the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The principle states that Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where Δx is the uncertainty in position, Δp is the uncertainty in momentum, and ħ is the reduced Planck's constant (ħ = h/2π ≈ 1.0545718 × 10^(-34) Js). Given Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 × 10^(-9) m, we can find Δp. Δp = ħ/(2Δx). Once we have Δp, we can relate it to the uncertainty in energy using the relation ΔE = v * Δp, since Δp = m * Δv and ΔE = Δp * v for a non-relativistic approximation. However, since the speed v is close to the speed of light, we should consider relativistic effects and use ΔE = c * Δp for a more accurate result. Let's calculate Δp first: Δp = ħ/(2Δx) = (1.0545718 × 10^(-34) Js) / (2 × 0.1 × 10^(-9) m) = 5.272859 × 10^(-25) kg m/s. Now, calculate ΔE: ΔE = c * Δp = (3 × 10^8 m/s) * (5.272859 × 10^(-25) kg m/s) = 1.5818577 × 10^(-16) J. This is closest to choice 3.
