        "response": "To estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy \u0394E of the electron, we can use the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which states that \u0394x * \u0394p \u2265 \u0127/2, where \u0394p is the uncertainty in momentum and \u0127 is the reduced Planck's constant (approximately 1.055 x 10^(-34) Js). The momentum p of the electron can be expressed as p = mv, where m is the mass of the electron (approximately 9.11 x 10^(-31) kg). The uncertainty in momentum \u0394p can be related to the uncertainty in energy \u0394E using the relation \u0394E = \u0394p * v. First, we calculate \u0394p using \u0394x and then find \u0394E.\n\nAnswer:D",
