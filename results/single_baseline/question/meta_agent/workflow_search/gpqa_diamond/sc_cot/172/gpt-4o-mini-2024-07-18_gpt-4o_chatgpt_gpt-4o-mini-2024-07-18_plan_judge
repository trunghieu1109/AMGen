Question: Example(question="If uncertainty in space of electron's location, which is travelling with speed v= 2* 10^8 m/s along x-direction is Δx=0.1 nm . Based on the infromation estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of electron.", choice1='~10^(-19) J', choice2='~10^(-18) J', choice3='~10^(-16) J', choice4='~10^(-17) J', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To find the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of the electron, we can use the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The principle states that Δx * Δp >= ħ/2, where Δx is the uncertainty in position and Δp is the uncertainty in momentum. Here, Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 * 10^(-9) m. The reduced Planck's constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718 * 10^(-34) J*s. We can find Δp as Δp >= ħ/(2 * Δx). Once we have Δp, we can relate it to the uncertainty in energy via ΔE = Δp * v, since the kinetic energy is the dominant form of energy for a high-speed electron. v = 2 * 10^8 m/s. Calculate Δp and then ΔE.
