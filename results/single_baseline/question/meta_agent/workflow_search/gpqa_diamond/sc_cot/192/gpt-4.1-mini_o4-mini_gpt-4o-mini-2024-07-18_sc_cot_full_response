Question: {'question': 'In a specific region of the sky, astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?', 'choice1': '~ r^2', 'choice2': '~ r^4', 'choice3': '~ r^3', 'choice4': '~ r^5'}\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent TQOi', content='We have N(plx)∝1/plx^5 and plx=1/r, so N(r)dr=N(plx)dplx with |dplx/dr|=1/r^2. Thus N(r)∝plx^(−5)*(1/r^2)=(r^5)*(1/r^2)=r^3.\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
