            "In a specific region of the sky, astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?",

        "response": "The parallax angle (plx) is inversely proportional to the distance (r), i.e., plx = 1/r. If the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5, then it means the number of stars is proportional to plx^5. Substituting plx = 1/r, we get that the number of stars is proportional to (1/r)^5 = r^5. Therefore, the number of stars changes with distance as ~ r^5.\n\nAnswer:D)",
