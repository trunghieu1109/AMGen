Question: Example(question='In a specific region of the sky, astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?', choice1='~ r^2', choice2='~ r^4', choice3='~ r^3', choice4='~ r^5', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The relationship given is that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. Parallax (plx) is inversely related to distance (r), specifically plx = 1/r (in some units). Therefore, if we substitute plx with 1/r, we have the number of stars varying as 1/(1/r)^5, which simplifies to r^5. Thus, the number of stars increases with the distance raised to the power of 5.
