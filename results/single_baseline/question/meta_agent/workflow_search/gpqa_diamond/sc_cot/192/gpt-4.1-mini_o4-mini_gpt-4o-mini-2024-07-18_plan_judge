Question: Example(question='In a specific region of the sky, astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?', choice1='~ r^2', choice2='~ r^4', choice3='~ r^3', choice4='~ r^5', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: We have N(plx)∝1/plx^5 and plx=1/r, so N(r)dr=N(plx)dplx with |dplx/dr|=1/r^2. Thus N(r)∝plx^(−5)*(1/r^2)=(r^5)*(1/r^2)=r^3.
