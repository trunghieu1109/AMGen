            "In a specific region of the sky, astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?",

        "n": "Baseline sc_cot",
        "response": "The relationship given is that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. Parallax (plx) is inversely related to distance (r), specifically plx = 1/r (in some units). Therefore, if we substitute plx with 1/r, we have the number of stars varying as 1/(1/r)^5, which simplifies to r^5. Thus, the number of stars increases with the distance raised to the power of 5.\n\nAnswer:D",
