            "Two planets have been detected orbiting a star using both the transit and radial velocity (RV) methods. The star has a mass of 1.5 times that of the Sun, a radius 1.2 times that of the Sun, and an effective temperature (Teff) of 6300 K. Planet1 has a mass equivalent to 7 Earth masses and a radius 1.7 times that of Earth, while Planet2 has a mass equivalent to 5 Earth masses and a radius 1.3 times that of Earth. Interestingly, both planets are in circular orbits. Planet1 induces a periodic shift of up to 0.03 \u00c5 in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 \u00c5, while the gravitational impact of Planet2 on the same line results in a periodic Doppler shift of up to 0.04 \u00c5. Assuming that both planets possess the same albedo, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2?",

        "response": "To find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of the two planets, we use the formula for equilibrium temperature: T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^0.25 * (R_star / (2 * d))^0.5, where T_star is the star's effective temperature, A is the albedo, R_star is the star's radius, and d is the distance from the star. Since both planets have the same albedo and orbit the same star, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures depends only on their distances from the star. The distance can be inferred from the Doppler shift they induce. The Doppler shift is proportional to the velocity of the star induced by the planet, which is related to the planet's mass and the distance from the star. Specifically, the velocity is proportional to M_planet / d^2. Given the shifts, Planet1 has a shift of 0.03 \u00c5 and Planet2 has a shift of 0.04 \u00c5. Using the relation for Doppler shift, we have (M1 / d1^2) / (M2 / d2^2) = 0.03 / 0.04. Solving for d1 / d2, we find d1 / d2 = sqrt((M1 * 0.04) / (M2 * 0.03)). Plugging in the masses, M1 = 7 Earth masses, M2 = 5 Earth masses, we get d1 / d2 = sqrt((7 * 0.04) / (5 * 0.03)) = sqrt(28 / 15). The equilibrium temperature ratio is (d2 / d1)^0.5 = (15 / 28)^0.25. Calculating this gives approximately 0.98.\n\nAnswer:B)",
