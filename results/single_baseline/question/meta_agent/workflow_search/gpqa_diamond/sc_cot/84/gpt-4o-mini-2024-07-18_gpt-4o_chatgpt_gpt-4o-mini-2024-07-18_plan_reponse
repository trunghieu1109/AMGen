            "Two planets have been detected orbiting a star using both the transit and radial velocity (RV) methods. The star has a mass of 1.5 times that of the Sun, a radius 1.2 times that of the Sun, and an effective temperature (Teff) of 6300 K. Planet1 has a mass equivalent to 7 Earth masses and a radius 1.7 times that of Earth, while Planet2 has a mass equivalent to 5 Earth masses and a radius 1.3 times that of Earth. Interestingly, both planets are in circular orbits. Planet1 induces a periodic shift of up to 0.03 \u00c5 in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 \u00c5, while the gravitational impact of Planet2 on the same line results in a periodic Doppler shift of up to 0.04 \u00c5. Assuming that both planets possess the same albedo, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2?",

        "response": "To find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of the two planets, we use the formula for equilibrium temperature: T_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a))^0.5 * (1 - A)^0.25, where T_star is the star's effective temperature, R_star is the star's radius, a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit, and A is the albedo. Since both planets have the same albedo, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures depends only on the ratio of their semi-major axes. The semi-major axis can be deduced from the Doppler shift: \u0394\u03bb/\u03bb = v/c, where \u0394\u03bb is the shift, \u03bb is the wavelength, v is the velocity, and c is the speed of light. The velocity v is related to the semi-major axis a by Kepler's third law and the gravitational pull of the star and planet. For both planets, the star's mass and the wavelength are the same, so the ratio of the velocities is the ratio of the Doppler shifts. Thus, the ratio of the semi-major axes is the inverse of the ratio of the Doppler shifts. Therefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is (0.04/0.03)^0.5 = (4/3)^0.5 \u2248 1.15. However, none of the choices match exactly, so the closest is ~ 1.05.\n\nAnswer:A)",
