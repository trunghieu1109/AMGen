    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Two planets have been detected orbiting a star using both the transit and radial velocity (RV) methods. The star has a mass of 1.5 times that of the Sun, a radius 1.2 times that of the Sun, and an effective temperature (Teff) of 6300 K. Planet1 has a mass equivalent to 7 Earth masses and a radius 1.7 times that of Earth, while Planet2 has a mass equivalent to 5 Earth masses and a radius 1.3 times that of Earth. Interestingly, both planets are in circular orbits. Planet1 induces a periodic shift of up to 0.03 Å in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å, while the gravitational impact of Planet2 on the same line results in a periodic Doppler shift of up to 0.04 Å. Assuming that both planets possess the same albedo, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2?&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;~ 1.05&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;~ 0.98&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;~ 0.53&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;~ 1.30&#39;}

    <pre>To find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between two planets, we can use the formula for equilibrium temperature: Teq = (L / (16 * π * σ * d^2))^(1/4), where L is the luminosity of the star, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and d is the distance from the star. Since both planets are orbiting the same star, we can simplify the ratio of their temperatures based on their distances from the star. However, since we are not given the distances directly, we can use the fact that the equilibrium temperature is also related to the mass and radius of the planets in terms of their ability to retain heat. Given the information, we can analyze the albedo and the effective temperature of the star to estimate the equilibrium temperatures. Without specific distance values, we can look at the provided choices and deduce which ratio is plausible based on the given parameters. The effective temperature of the star is 6300 K, and the differences in mass and radius of the planets suggest that their equilibrium temperatures will be relatively close to each other. The choices provided suggest a slight variation, with the closest likely being around 1.05 or 0.98. Given the nature of the planets, the ratio is likely to be close to 1, indicating a small difference in temperature due to their proximity to the star and their physical characteristics.
