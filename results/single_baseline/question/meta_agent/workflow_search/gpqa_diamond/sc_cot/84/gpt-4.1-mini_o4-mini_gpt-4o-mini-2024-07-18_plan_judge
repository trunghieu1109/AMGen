Question: Example(question='Two planets have been detected orbiting a star using both the transit and radial velocity (RV) methods. The star has a mass of 1.5 times that of the Sun, a radius 1.2 times that of the Sun, and an effective temperature (Teff) of 6300 K. Planet1 has a mass equivalent to 7 Earth masses and a radius 1.7 times that of Earth, while Planet2 has a mass equivalent to 5 Earth masses and a radius 1.3 times that of Earth. Interestingly, both planets are in circular orbits. Planet1 induces a periodic shift of up to 0.03 Å in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å, while the gravitational impact of Planet2 on the same line results in a periodic Doppler shift of up to 0.04 Å. Assuming that both planets possess the same albedo, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2?', choice1='~ 1.05', choice2='~ 0.98', choice3='~ 0.53', choice4='~ 1.30', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: We need the ratio of equilibrium temperatures given identical albedo: T_eq∝T_*√(R_*/2a), so T1/T2=√(a2/a1). We can find the orbital radii ratio from the RV semi-amplitudes K1 and K2 and known planet masses via Kepler’s law. 1) Compute K from Δλ: K1=(0.03/6300)c≈1.4286 km/s, K2=(0.04/6300)c≈1.9048 km/s. 2) K∝Mp/P1/3 ⇒ K1/K2=(M1/M2)(P2/P1)1/3 ⇒ (P2/P1)1/3=(K1/K2)/(M1/M2)=0.75/1.4≈0.5357 ⇒ P2/P1≈0.1536. 3) a∝P2/3 ⇒ a2/a1=(P2/P1)2/3≈0.287. 4) T1/T2=√(a2/a1)≈√0.287≈0.536≈0.53, matching choice C).
