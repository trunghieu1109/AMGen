            "Two planets have been detected orbiting a star using both the transit and radial velocity (RV) methods. The star has a mass of 1.5 times that of the Sun, a radius 1.2 times that of the Sun, and an effective temperature (Teff) of 6300 K. Planet1 has a mass equivalent to 7 Earth masses and a radius 1.7 times that of Earth, while Planet2 has a mass equivalent to 5 Earth masses and a radius 1.3 times that of Earth. Interestingly, both planets are in circular orbits. Planet1 induces a periodic shift of up to 0.03 \u00c5 in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 \u00c5, while the gravitational impact of Planet2 on the same line results in a periodic Doppler shift of up to 0.04 \u00c5. Assuming that both planets possess the same albedo, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2?",

        "response": "We need the ratio of equilibrium temperatures given identical albedo: T_eq\u221dT_*\u221a(R_*/2a), so T1/T2=\u221a(a2/a1). We can find the orbital radii ratio from the RV semi-amplitudes K1 and K2 and known planet masses via Kepler\u2019s law. 1) Compute K from \u0394\u03bb: K1=(0.03/6300)c\u22481.4286\u2009km/s, K2=(0.04/6300)c\u22481.9048\u2009km/s. 2) K\u221dMp/P1/3 \u21d2 K1/K2=(M1/M2)(P2/P1)1/3 \u21d2 (P2/P1)1/3=(K1/K2)/(M1/M2)=0.75/1.4\u22480.5357 \u21d2 P2/P1\u22480.1536. 3) a\u221dP2/3 \u21d2 a2/a1=(P2/P1)2/3\u22480.287. 4) T1/T2=\u221a(a2/a1)\u2248\u221a0.287\u22480.536\u22480.53, matching choice C).\n\nAnswer:C)",
