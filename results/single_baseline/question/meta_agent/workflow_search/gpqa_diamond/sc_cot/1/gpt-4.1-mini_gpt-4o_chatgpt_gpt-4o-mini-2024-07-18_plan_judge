proposed answer: trans-Cinnamaldehyde is an aldehyde with the formula C6H5CH=CHCHO. When treated with methylmagnesium bromide, a Grignard reagent, it will add to the carbonyl carbon, forming a secondary alcohol. This results in a new carbon being added, making the product C6H5CH=CHCH(CH3)OH. This is product 1, which has 10 carbon atoms. When product 1 is treated with pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC), the secondary alcohol is oxidized to a ketone, forming product 2, C6H5CH=CHC(CH3)=O, which still has 10 carbon atoms. Product 2 is then treated with (dimethyl(oxo)-l6-sulfaneylidene)methane (a sulfur ylide) in DMSO, which suggests a methylene insertion or epoxidation reaction. However, the key point is that this reaction typically does not change the carbon count, so product 3 will also have 10 carbon atoms.
