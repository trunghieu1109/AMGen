Question: Example(question='trans-cinnamaldehyde was treated with methylmagnesium bromide, forming product 1.\n\n1 was treated with pyridinium chlorochromate, forming product 2.\n\n3 was treated with (dimethyl(oxo)-l6-sulfaneylidene)methane in DMSO at elevated temperature, forming product 3.\n\nhow many carbon atoms are there in product 3?', choice1='10', choice2='12', choice3='11', choice4='14', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: Step 1: trans-cinnamaldehyde (Ph–CH=CH–CHO, 9 C) + MeMgBr → secondary alcohol Ph–CH=CH–CH(OH)Me (still 10 C).
Step 2: oxidation with PCC → α,β-unsaturated ketone Ph–CH=CH–C(=O)Me (10 C).
Step 3: treatment with dimethyl(oxo)-λ6-sulfaneylidene)methane (a sulfur ylide) on an enone induces cyclopropanation of the C=C. The new cyclopropane has 3 ring C (2 original + 1 new), plus 6 C in the phenyl, plus 1 carbonyl C and 1 Me. Total C = 3 + 6 + 1 + 1 = 11.
