        "response": "Operators in SMEFT must respect spacetime symmetries (Poincare symmetry, which includes Lorentz symmetry) and the CPT theorem ensures CPT invariance in any local quantum field theory. CP symmetry is not required as SMEFT can include CP-violating operators. Therefore the correct set is 1,2,4 corresponding to choice4.\n\nAnswer:D",
