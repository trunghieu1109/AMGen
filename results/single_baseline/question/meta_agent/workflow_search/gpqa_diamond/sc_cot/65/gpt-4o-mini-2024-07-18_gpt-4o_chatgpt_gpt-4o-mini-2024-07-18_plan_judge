proposed answer: The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) must respect certain fundamental symmetries that are intrinsic to the laws of physics. Lorentz symmetry and Poincare symmetry are fundamental spacetime symmetries that must be respected by any relativistic quantum field theory, including the SMEFT. CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry that must be respected by any local Lorentz invariant quantum field theory, due to the CPT theorem. CP symmetry, however, is not a fundamental symmetry that must be respected by all operators, as CP violation is observed in the Standard Model. Therefore, the symmetries that must be respected are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, and CPT symmetry.
