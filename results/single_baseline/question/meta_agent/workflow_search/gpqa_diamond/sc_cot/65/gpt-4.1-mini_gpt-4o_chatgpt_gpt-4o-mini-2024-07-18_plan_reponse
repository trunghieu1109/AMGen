        "response": "The SMEFT (Standard Model Effective Field Theory) must respect certain symmetries that are fundamental to the structure of spacetime and particle physics. Lorentz symmetry (1) is a fundamental symmetry of spacetime that must be respected. Poincare symmetry (2) is an extension of Lorentz symmetry that includes translations, and is also fundamental. CP symmetry (3) is not necessarily respected by all operators, as CP violation is a known phenomenon in particle physics. CPT symmetry (4) is a fundamental symmetry that must be respected by all physical theories according to the CPT theorem. Therefore, the symmetries that must be respected are 1 (Lorentz), 2 (Poincare), and 4 (CPT).\n\nAnswer:D)",
