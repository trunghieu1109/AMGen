Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent F5vM', content='In the context of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), we need to consider which symmetries are fundamental and must be respected by all operators. Lorentz symmetry is a fundamental symmetry in relativistic quantum field theories, and Poincare symmetry encompasses both Lorentz transformations and translations in space and time. CP symmetry is also respected in many theories, but not all operators must respect it universally. CPT symmetry, however, is a theorem that states that any local quantum field theory must respect CPT symmetry. Therefore, the operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The options that include these symmetries need to be evaluated. The only choice that includes Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, and CPT symmetry is choice 4 (1, 2, 4).\n\nAnswer:D', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
