Question: Example(question='cyclohexanone was treated with bromine, forming product 1.\n1 was heated with sodium hydroxide, forming product 2.\n2 was treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine, forming 3.\n3 was treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride, forming product 4.\n\nhow many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are there on product 4?', choice1='8', choice2='6', choice3='7', choice4='10', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The sequence is a Favorskii rearrangement of 2-bromocyclohexanone to the cyclopentanecarboxylate, converted to the acid chloride and then selectively reduced to cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. In the aldehyde, the only symmetry operation is a mirror plane through the formyl-bearing carbon and the midpoint of the opposite Câ€“C bond. Under this Cs symmetry the aldehyde H and the single ring CH H lie on the plane (each unique), the two H at C2 and C5 form two equivalent pairs, and the two H at C3 and C4 form another two pairs. Counting one for each pair plus the two on-plane gives 6 distinct H environments.
