        "n": "Baseline sc_cot",
        "response": "Cyclohexanone reacts with bromine to form 2-bromocyclohexanone. Heating with sodium hydroxide induces an alpha-elimination to form cyclohexenone. Treating cyclohexenone with thionyl chloride and pyridine converts it to a vinyl chloride, specifically 2-chlorocyclohexene. Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride reduces the vinyl chloride to cyclohexene. Cyclohexene has two types of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms: the vinylic hydrogens on the double bond and the allylic hydrogens on the adjacent carbons. Therefore, there are 2 vinylic hydrogens and 6 allylic hydrogens, totaling 8 distinct hydrogens.\n\nAnswer:A)",
