        "response": "To determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on product 4, we need to analyze the reactions step by step. Cyclohexanone reacts with bromine, likely forming a bromo-cyclohexanone. Heating this compound with sodium hydroxide could lead to a substitution or elimination reaction, possibly forming an alcohol or a different functional group. The subsequent reaction with thionyl chloride and pyridine typically converts alcohols to alkyl chlorides. Finally, treating the alkyl chloride with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride reduces it, likely affecting the hydrogen count. By considering the structure of product 4, we can deduce the number of distinct hydrogen atoms. After analyzing the potential structure of product 4, it is determined that there are 6 distinct hydrogen atoms present.\n\nAnswer:B",
