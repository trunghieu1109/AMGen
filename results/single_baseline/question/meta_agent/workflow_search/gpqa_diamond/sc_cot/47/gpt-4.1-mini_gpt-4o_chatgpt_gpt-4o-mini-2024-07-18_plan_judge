Question: Example(question='cyclohexanone was treated with bromine, forming product 1.\n1 was heated with sodium hydroxide, forming product 2.\n2 was treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine, forming 3.\n3 was treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride, forming product 4.\n\nhow many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are there on product 4?', choice1='8', choice2='6', choice3='7', choice4='10', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: Cyclohexanone reacts with bromine to form 2-bromocyclohexanone. Heating with sodium hydroxide induces an alpha-elimination to form cyclohexenone. Treating cyclohexenone with thionyl chloride and pyridine converts it to a vinyl chloride, specifically 2-chlorocyclohexene. Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride reduces the vinyl chloride to cyclohexene. Cyclohexene has two types of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms: the vinylic hydrogens on the double bond and the allylic hydrogens on the adjacent carbons. Therefore, there are 2 vinylic hydrogens and 6 allylic hydrogens, totaling 8 distinct hydrogens.
