Question: Example(question='cyclohexanone was treated with bromine, forming product 1.\n1 was heated with sodium hydroxide, forming product 2.\n2 was treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine, forming 3.\n3 was treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride, forming product 4.\n\nhow many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are there on product 4?', choice1='8', choice2='6', choice3='7', choice4='10', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: First, cyclohexanone treated with bromine likely forms 2-bromocyclohexanone (product 1). Heating this with sodium hydroxide leads to an alpha-elimination reaction, forming cyclohexenone (product 2). Treating this with thionyl chloride and pyridine likely forms a vinyl chloride (product 3). Finally, reduction with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride would convert the vinyl chloride to cyclohexanol (product 4). Cyclohexanol has 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms: 5 on the ring and 1 on the hydroxyl group.
