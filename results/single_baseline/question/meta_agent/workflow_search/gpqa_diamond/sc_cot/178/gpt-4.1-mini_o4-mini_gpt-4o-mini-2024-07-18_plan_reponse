W is Hermitian and involutory so unitary but X isn\u2019t unitary itself, so A false. Z is Hermitian but X is anti\u2010Hermitian not Hermitian, so D false. Y is a valid density matrix (Hermitian, positive, trace 1) and conjugation by the unitary e^X yields another density matrix, so C is correct.\n\nAnswer:C)",
