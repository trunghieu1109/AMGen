Question: Example(question='The study of quantum mechanics deals with a lot of matrices. Consider the following matrices. \n\nW = (0, 0, 1; 0, 1, 0; 1, 0, 0), \nX = (i, -1, 2i; 1, 0, 1;  2i, -1, -i),\nY = (0.5, 0.1, 0.2; 0.1, 0.25, 0.1; 0.2, 0.1, 0.25)\nZ - (3, 2i, 5; -2i, -2, -4i; 5, 4i, 4)\n\nNote. The matrices are formatted such that each row of the matrix is separated by a semicolon.  \n\nBased on these matrices, choose the correct statement.\n', choice1='W and X represent the evolution operator of some quantum system.', choice2='There exists a vector to which if one multiplies e^X, the norm of the vector changes.', choice3='(e^X)*Y*(e^{-X}) represents a quantum state.', choice4='Z and X represent observables.', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: In quantum mechanics evolution operators must be unitary and observables Hermitian. X†=−X so e^X is unitary (not X itself), hence B is false. W is Hermitian and involutory so unitary but X isn’t unitary itself, so A false. Z is Hermitian but X is anti‐Hermitian not Hermitian, so D false. Y is a valid density matrix (Hermitian, positive, trace 1) and conjugation by the unitary e^X yields another density matrix, so C is correct.
