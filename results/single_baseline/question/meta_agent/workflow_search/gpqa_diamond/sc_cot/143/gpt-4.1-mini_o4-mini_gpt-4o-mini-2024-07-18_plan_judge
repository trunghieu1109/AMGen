Question: Example(question='X is a meson resonance. What is the mean decay distance? Knowing that the production energy is $E_{X}=8GeV$, the mass $m_{X}=1.2GeV$, and the width $\\Gamma_{X}=320MeV$.', choice1='5.0223 * 10^-16 m', choice2='4.0655 * 10^-16 m', choice3='4.0655 * 10^-15 m', choice4='5.0223 * 10^-15 m', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: First, compute the resonance lifetime τ using τ = ħ/Γ with ħ = 6.582×10⁻²⁵ GeV·s and Γ = 0.32 GeV: τ ≈ 2.057×10⁻²⁴ s. Next, find the Lorentz factor γ = E/m = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV ≈ 6.667. Finally, the mean decay distance L = c·τ·γ ≈ (3×10⁸ m/s)·(2.057×10⁻²⁴ s)·6.667 ≈ 4.07×10⁻¹⁵ m, which corresponds to choice 3.
