        "response": "To find the mean decay distance of the meson resonance X, we can use the relationship between the decay width (Gamma), the mass (m), and the mean lifetime (tau) of the particle. The mean lifetime is given by tau = hbar / Gamma, where hbar is the reduced Planck's constant (approximately 1.055 x 10^-34 Js). The mean decay distance can then be calculated using the formula d = beta * gamma * tau, where beta is the velocity of the particle in terms of the speed of light, and gamma is the Lorentz factor. First, we need to find the velocity and gamma factor using the energy and mass of the particle. The total energy E is given by E = gamma * m * c^2, and we can find beta from beta = sqrt(1 - (m^2 / E^2)). After calculating these values, we can find the mean decay distance and compare it with the provided choices.\n\nAnswer:5.0223 * 10^-16 m",
