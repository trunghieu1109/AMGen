Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent hd8V', content='First, compute the resonance lifetime τ using τ = ħ/Γ with ħ = 6.582×10⁻²⁵ GeV·s and Γ = 0.32 GeV: τ ≈ 2.057×10⁻²⁴ s. Next, find the Lorentz factor γ = E/m = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV ≈ 6.667. Finally, the mean decay distance L = c·τ·γ ≈ (3×10⁸ m/s)·(2.057×10⁻²⁴ s)·6.667 ≈ 4.07×10⁻¹⁵ m, which corresponds to choice 3.\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
