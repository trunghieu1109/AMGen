            "Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known. The bright-red substance A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 (\u0277F=31,96%) and fluorine. A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. A3 can also interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y with fluorine. By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained. In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances. Indicate the range in which the molecular weight of the substance A4 falls.",

        "response": "We are told A1 (bright-red) decomposes at 293 K into A2 + F2. Thus A1 = YF\u2099 and A2 = YF\u2099\u208b\u2081. Given \u03c9_F in A2 = 31.96% = (19(n\u22121))/(M_Y + 19(n\u22121)). Solving for integer n gives n\u22121 = 4 \u2192 M_Y \u2248 161.8. Thus YF\u2084 is A2, YF\u2085 is A1. The set \u201cfive binary fluorides\u201d corresponds to n = 1\u20135. A4 is then YF\u2083, whose molar mass = M_Y + 3\u00b719 \u2248 161.8 + 57 = 218.8. That falls in the 220\u2013240 range.\n\nAnswer:A)",
