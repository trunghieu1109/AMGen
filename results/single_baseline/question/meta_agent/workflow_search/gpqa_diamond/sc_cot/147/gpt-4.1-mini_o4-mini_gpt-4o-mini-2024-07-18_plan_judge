Question: Example(question='Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known. The bright-red substance A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 (ɷF=31,96%) and fluorine. A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. A3 can also interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y with fluorine. By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained. In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances. Indicate the range in which the molecular weight of the substance A4 falls.', choice1='220-240', choice2='140-160', choice3='160-180', choice4='110-130', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: We are told A1 (bright-red) decomposes at 293 K into A2 + F2. Thus A1 = YFₙ and A2 = YFₙ₋₁. Given ω_F in A2 = 31.96% = (19(n−1))/(M_Y + 19(n−1)). Solving for integer n gives n−1 = 4 → M_Y ≈ 161.8. Thus YF₄ is A2, YF₅ is A1. The set “five binary fluorides” corresponds to n = 1–5. A4 is then YF₃, whose molar mass = M_Y + 3·19 ≈ 161.8 + 57 = 218.8. That falls in the 220–240 range.
