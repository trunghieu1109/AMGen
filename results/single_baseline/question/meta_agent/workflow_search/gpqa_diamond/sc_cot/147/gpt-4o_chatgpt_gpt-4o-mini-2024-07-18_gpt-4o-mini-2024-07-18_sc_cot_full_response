Question: {'question': 'Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known. The bright-red substance A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 (ɷF=31,96%) and fluorine. A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. A3 can also interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y with fluorine. By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained. In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances. Indicate the range in which the molecular weight of the substance A4 falls.', 'choice1': '220-240', 'choice2': '140-160', 'choice3': '160-180', 'choice4': '110-130'}\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent sTqe', content='To determine the range of the molecular weight of substance A4, we need to analyze the information given about the compounds and their interactions with other elements. The compounds are binary fluorides with an unknown element Y. The decomposition of A1 and its interactions suggest a complex structure involving fluorine and possibly a heavier element. The molecular weights of the options provided suggest that A4 is likely a heavier compound given the context of its reactions with xenon and the other substances. The range of 220-240 seems plausible considering the interactions described.\n\nAnswer:choice1', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
