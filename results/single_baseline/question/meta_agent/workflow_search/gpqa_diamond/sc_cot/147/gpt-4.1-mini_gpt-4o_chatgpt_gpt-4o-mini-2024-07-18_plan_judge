Question: Example(question='Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known. The bright-red substance A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 (É·F=31,96%) and fluorine. A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. A3 can also interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y with fluorine. By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained. In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances. Indicate the range in which the molecular weight of the substance A4 falls.', choice1='220-240', choice2='140-160', choice3='160-180', choice4='110-130', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To solve the problem, we need to identify the element Y and the compounds A1, A2, A3, A4, and A5. The problem involves binary compounds of fluorine with element Y. A1 decomposes to A2 and fluorine, and A1 oxidizes xenon, suggesting A1 is a strong oxidizer. A3 is obtained by fluorination of Y, indicating it is a fluoride of Y. A4 is a compound that reacts with Y to form A5, which decomposes in water into two substances. This suggests A5 might be a compound like a fluoride that hydrolyzes in water. The decomposition of A1 into A2 and fluorine with a given percentage of fluorine can help identify the compounds. The problem is essentially asking for the molecular weight range of A4. By identifying the compounds and their molecular weights, we can determine the range for A4.
