            "Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known. The bright-red substance A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 (\u0277F=31,96%) and fluorine. A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. A3 can also interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y with fluorine. By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained. In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances. Indicate the range in which the molecular weight of the substance A4 falls.",

        "response": "We need to determine the molecular weight range of compound A4. Let's analyze the given information: A1 decomposes into A2 and fluorine, and A1 oxidizes xenon, suggesting it is a strong oxidizer. A3 is obtained by fluorination of Y, implying A3 is a simple binary compound of Y and fluorine. A4 is a concentrated solution, and adding Y to it in a 1:1 molar ratio gives A5, which decomposes in water. The decomposition of A5 in water suggests it forms hydrofluoric acid (HF) and another compound. Given the fluorine percentage in A2 (31.96%), we can deduce the molecular weight of A2. Assuming Y is a heavier element such as sulfur (S), selenium (Se), or tellurium (Te), we calculate the molecular weight of A4 based on the molecular weights of possible compounds. The molecular weight of A4 is likely to be in the range of 220-240, considering the known binary compounds of fluorine with heavier elements like TeF4 or SeF4.\n\nAnswer:A)",
