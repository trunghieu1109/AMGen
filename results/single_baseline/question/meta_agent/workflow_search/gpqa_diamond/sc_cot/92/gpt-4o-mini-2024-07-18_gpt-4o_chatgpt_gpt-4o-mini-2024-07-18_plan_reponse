            "\"Scientist aims to run quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) on some samples. He first wants to make a calibration curve so he took positive control with known copy numbers and run qPCR on serially diluted positive control three technical replicates. The efficiency of qPCR was 100%. The R2 was 1, and the slope was -3.3. His results were as follows:\nAt the concentration of 100000 copies per \u00b5l, ct of triplicate results were 33.9, 34.2, 34.5.\nAt the concentration of 10000 copies per \u00b5l, ct of triplicate results were 30.6, 30.9, 31.2.\nAt the concentration of 1000 copies per \u00b5l, ct of triplicate results were 27.3, 27.6, 27.9.\nAt the concentration of 100 copies per \u00b5l, ct of triplicate results were 24, 24.3, 24.6.\nAt the concentration of 10 copies per \u00b5l, ct of triplicate results were 20.7, 21, 21.3\nWhich of the following explains the discrepancies in his results?\n\n",
            "Ct values are not in agreement with the amount of target nucleic acid in samples ",
            "Ten-fold dilution is more than 3.3 cycles",
            "The deviation is more than 0.3 between technical replicates",
            "qPCR cannot be used for the quantification of nucleic acid in samples ",

        "response": "The scientist is running qPCR to create a calibration curve. The efficiency of the qPCR is 100%, which means that ideally, a ten-fold dilution should result in a Ct value difference of about 3.3 cycles (since 2^3.3 \u2248 10). The reported slope of -3.3 confirms this efficiency. However, we need to check the Ct values at different concentrations. \n\n- At 100000 copies/\u00b5l, the average Ct is (33.9 + 34.2 + 34.5) / 3 = 34.2\n- At 10000 copies/\u00b5l, the average Ct is (30.6 + 30.9 + 31.2) / 3 = 30.9\n- At 1000 copies/\u00b5l, the average Ct is (27.3 + 27.6 + 27.9) / 3 = 27.6\n- At 100 copies/\u00b5l, the average Ct is (24 + 24.3 + 24.6) / 3 = 24.3\n- At 10 copies/\u00b5l, the average Ct is (20.7 + 21 + 21.3) / 3 = 21\n\nThe differences between the average Ct values at successive dilutions are:\n- 34.2 - 30.9 = 3.3\n- 30.9 - 27.6 = 3.3\n- 27.6 - 24.3 = 3.3\n- 24.3 - 21 = 3.3\n\nThese differences are consistent with the ideal 3.3 cycles per ten-fold dilution, indicating no discrepancy in the expected Ct values relative to the dilution factor. However, the deviation between technical replicates is more than 0.3 in some instances (e.g., 34.5 - 33.9 = 0.6), which suggests variability in the technical replicates.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible explanation for discrepancies in the results is the deviation between technical replicates being more than 0.3.\n\nAnswer:C)",
