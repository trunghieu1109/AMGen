    <pre>To analyze the discrepancies in the qPCR results, we need to consider the expected Ct values for a 10-fold dilution series with 100% efficiency. With 100% efficiency, each 10-fold dilution should result in a Ct increase of approximately 3.32 cycles. The given Ct values for each concentration are:

- 100000 copies/µl: Ct = 33.9, 34.2, 34.5
- 10000 copies/µl: Ct = 30.6, 30.9, 31.2
- 1000 copies/µl: Ct = 27.3, 27.6, 27.9
- 100 copies/µl: Ct = 24, 24.3, 24.6
- 10 copies/µl: Ct = 20.7, 21, 21.3

If we calculate the average Ct for each concentration, we see that the Ct values increase by approximately 3.3 cycles for each 10-fold dilution, which is consistent with the expected result for 100% efficiency. Therefore, choice 1 is not correct as the Ct values are in agreement with the amount of target nucleic acid in samples.

Choice 2 is incorrect because a ten-fold dilution should result in an increase of 3.32 cycles, which is consistent with the slope of -3.3.

Choice 3 mentions the deviation between technical replicates. The maximum deviation between the technical replicates for each concentration is 0.3, which is within an acceptable range for technical replicates.

Choice 4 is incorrect because qPCR is indeed used for the quantification of nucleic acid in samples.

Therefore, none of the choices seem to explain a discrepancy, but choice 3, &#39;The deviation is more than 0.3 between technical replicates&#39;, is the closest to a potential issue, even though the deviation is exactly 0.3 and not more than 0.3.
