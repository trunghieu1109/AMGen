    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;&#34;Scientist aims to run quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) on some samples. He first wants to make a calibration curve so he took positive control with known copy numbers and run qPCR on serially diluted positive control three technical replicates. The efficiency of qPCR was 100%. The R2 was 1, and the slope was -3.3. His results were as follows:\nAt the concentration of 100000 copies per µl, ct of triplicate results were 33.9, 34.2, 34.5.\nAt the concentration of 10000 copies per µl, ct of triplicate results were 30.6, 30.9, 31.2.\nAt the concentration of 1000 copies per µl, ct of triplicate results were 27.3, 27.6, 27.9.\nAt the concentration of 100 copies per µl, ct of triplicate results were 24, 24.3, 24.6.\nAt the concentration of 10 copies per µl, ct of triplicate results were 20.7, 21, 21.3\nWhich of the following explains the discrepancies in his results?\n\n&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;Ct values are not in agreement with the amount of target nucleic acid in samples &#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;Ten-fold dilution is more than 3.3 cycles&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;The deviation is more than 0.3 between technical replicates&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;qPCR cannot be used for the quantification of nucleic acid in samples &#39;}

    <pre>To analyze the discrepancies in the qPCR results, we need to consider the provided options. The efficiency of qPCR is 100%, and the slope of the calibration curve is -3.3, which indicates that a ten-fold dilution should correspond to approximately 3.3 cycles difference in Ct values. However, we need to check if the observed Ct values for each dilution align with this expectation. The second choice states that a ten-fold dilution is more than 3.3 cycles, which is valid because for a ten-fold dilution, we expect a change of about 3.3 cycles, and the observed changes are consistent with this. The first choice about Ct values not being in agreement is also a potential issue, but does not directly explain the discrepancies as well as the second choice. The third choice about deviations between technical replicates might indicate variability, but again does not directly explain the overall discrepancies in the results. The fourth choice is incorrect as qPCR can indeed be used for quantification. Therefore, the most logical explanation for the discrepancies is that the ten-fold dilution is more than the expected 3.3 cycles.
