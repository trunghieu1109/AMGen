Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 5SKA', content='The calibration curve shows ideal efficiency (100%), slope -3.3, R2=1. The CT difference for each ten-fold dilution is consistently 3.3 cycles across all points, so the primary issue is the replicate variability. Each set of triplicates spans 0.6 cycles (e.g., 33.9–34.5), exceeding the acceptable technical replicate deviation of 0.3 cycles. Thus the discrepancy is due to too much variation between replicates.\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
