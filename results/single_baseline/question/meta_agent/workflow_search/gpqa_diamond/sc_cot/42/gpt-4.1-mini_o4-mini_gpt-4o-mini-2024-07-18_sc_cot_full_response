Question: {'question': 'A benzene ring has a carboxylic acid a carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another. Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino and para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group. The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile. What is the correct IUPAC name for this molecule?\n', 'choice1': '5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid', 'choice2': '3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid', 'choice3': '2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid', 'choice4': '2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid'}\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent oaG6', content='Assign COOH as C-1. Substituents: HO and NMe2 ortho at C-2 and C-6; MeO para at C-4; –CHO and –CN meta at C-3 and C-5. The requirement that –OCH3 and –OH both ortho to –CN is satisfied only if –CN is at C-5 (neighbors C-4 and C-6). Thus –CHO must be at C-3, NMe2 at C-2, OH at C-6. For numbering direction, both give locant set {2,3,4,5,6}, so apply the first point of difference rule: comparing lists of substituent names by ascending locant gives DM at C-2 vs OH at C-2; “dimethylamino” < “hydroxy,” so the correct numbering places dimethylamino at C-2. Substituents are listed alphabetically (cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy), giving 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid, which is choice 1.\n\nAnswer:A)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
