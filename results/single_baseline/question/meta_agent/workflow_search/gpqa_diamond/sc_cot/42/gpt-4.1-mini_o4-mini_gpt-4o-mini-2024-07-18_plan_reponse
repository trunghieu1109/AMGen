            "A benzene ring has a carboxylic acid a carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another. Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino and para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group. The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile. What is the correct IUPAC name for this molecule?\n",

        "response": "Assign COOH as C-1. Substituents: HO and NMe2 ortho at C-2 and C-6; MeO para at C-4; \u2013CHO and \u2013CN meta at C-3 and C-5. The requirement that \u2013OCH3 and \u2013OH both ortho to \u2013CN is satisfied only if \u2013CN is at C-5 (neighbors C-4 and C-6). Thus \u2013CHO must be at C-3, NMe2 at C-2, OH at C-6. For numbering direction, both give locant set {2,3,4,5,6}, so apply the first point of difference rule: comparing lists of substituent names by ascending locant gives DM at C-2 vs OH at C-2; \u201cdimethylamino\u201d < \u201chydroxy,\u201d so the correct numbering places dimethylamino at C-2. Substituents are listed alphabetically (cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy), giving 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid, which is choice 1.\n\nAnswer:A)",
