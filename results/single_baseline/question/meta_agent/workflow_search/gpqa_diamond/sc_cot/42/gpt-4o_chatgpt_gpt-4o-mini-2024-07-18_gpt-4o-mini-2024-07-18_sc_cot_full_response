Question: {'question': 'A benzene ring has a carboxylic acid a carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another. Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino and para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group. The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile. What is the correct IUPAC name for this molecule?\n', 'choice1': '5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid', 'choice2': '3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid', 'choice3': '2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid', 'choice4': '2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid'}\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent oaG6', content='To determine the correct IUPAC name, we need to analyze the structure described in the question. The carboxylic acid is the main functional group, and we need to correctly identify the positions of the other substituents (the carbaldehyde, cyano group, hydroxyl, dimethylamino, and methoxy) based on their relationships (meta, ortho, para) to each other. The description suggests a specific arrangement of these groups around the benzene ring. After carefully considering the positions and the naming conventions, we can match the structure to one of the provided choices.\n\nAnswer:3', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
