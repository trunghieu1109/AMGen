Question: Example(question='By considering different factors like heat, acidic and basic medium, etc., select a suitable mechanism and point out the major products from the following reactions.\n1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol + (THF, KH, H+) ---> A\n(E)-pent-2-en-1-ol + acetyl bromide (Base = LDA) ---> B', choice1='A = (E)-bicyclo[5.3.1]undec-1(11)-en-4-one, B = 3-ethylpent-4-enoic acid', choice2='A = (E)-bicyclo[5.3.1]undec-1(11)-en-4-one, B = lithium 3-ethylpent-4-enoate', choice3='A = decahydro-7H-benzo[7]annulen-7-one, B = 3-ethylpent-4-enoic acid', choice4='A = decahydro-7H-benzo[7]annulen-7-one, B = lithium 3-ethylpent-4-enoate', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: For reaction 1: Deprotonation of the spiro‐alcohol gives an alkoxide that undergoes intramolecular oxy–anion‐ene cyclization onto the vinyl substituent, furnishing the bicyclo[5.3.1]undecene ketone with retention of the E‐alkene. This matches (E)‐bicyclo[5.3.1]undec‐1(11)‐en‐4‐one. For reaction 2: LDA deprotonates the allylic acetate (formed by SN2 of the pent‐2‐en-1-oxide onto acetyl bromide), then a [3,3] Claisen rearrangement followed by trapping of the carboxylate with Li+ gives the lithium salt. Thus the product is lithium 3-ethylpent-4-enoate, making choice 2 correct.
