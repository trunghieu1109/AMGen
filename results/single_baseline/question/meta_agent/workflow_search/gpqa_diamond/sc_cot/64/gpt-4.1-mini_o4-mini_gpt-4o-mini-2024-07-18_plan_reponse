        "response": "For reaction 1: Deprotonation of the spiro\u2010alcohol gives an alkoxide that undergoes intramolecular oxy\u2013anion\u2010ene cyclization onto the vinyl substituent, furnishing the bicyclo[5.3.1]undecene ketone with retention of the E\u2010alkene. This matches (E)\u2010bicyclo[5.3.1]undec\u20101(11)\u2010en\u20104\u2010one. For reaction 2: LDA deprotonates the allylic acetate (formed by SN2 of the pent\u20102\u2010en-1-oxide onto acetyl bromide), then a [3,3] Claisen rearrangement followed by trapping of the carboxylate with Li+ gives the lithium salt. Thus the product is lithium 3-ethylpent-4-enoate, making choice 2 correct.\n\nAnswer:B)",
