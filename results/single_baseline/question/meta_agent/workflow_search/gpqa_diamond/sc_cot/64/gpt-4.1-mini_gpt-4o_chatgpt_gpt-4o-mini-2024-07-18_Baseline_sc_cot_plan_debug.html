    <pre>For reaction A, 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol is treated with THF, KH, and H+. This suggests a possible intramolecular cyclization reaction. The presence of KH (a strong base) can deprotonate the alcohol to form an alkoxide, which can then undergo an intramolecular attack to form a bicyclic structure. The acidic workup (H+) would then lead to the formation of a ketone. This points to a bicyclo structure with a ketone, which matches (E)-bicyclo[5.3.1]undec-1(11)-en-4-one. For reaction B, (E)-pent-2-en-1-ol is treated with acetyl bromide in the presence of LDA, a strong base. LDA can deprotonate the alcohol to form an alkoxide, which can then react with acetyl bromide. However, the presence of LDA suggests that the product might be a carboxylate salt. Therefore, the product is likely to be lithium 3-ethylpent-4-enoate.
