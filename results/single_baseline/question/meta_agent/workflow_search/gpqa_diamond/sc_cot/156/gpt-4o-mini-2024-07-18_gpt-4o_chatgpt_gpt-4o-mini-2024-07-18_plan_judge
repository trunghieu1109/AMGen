Question: Example(question='There has been an outbreak of an viral infectious disease in your city. You have been asked to design a molecular diagnostic kit for quick detection of this retrovirus. How would you go about designing this kit?', choice1='First you identify the virus by performing DNA sequencing. You then develop a PCR kit for  quick and accurate diagnosis', choice2='First you identify the IgG antibodies for the infection. You then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG antibodies for quick \n and accurate diagnosis.', choice3='First you identify the virus using the information about the symptoms, provided by the affected patients. You then design a nested PCR kit based on the information for quick diagnosis.', choice4='First you identify the virus by performing cDNA sequencing.  You then develop a real time PCR kit for quick and accurate diagnosis.', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: To design a molecular diagnostic kit for a retrovirus, the key steps include identifying the virus accurately and then developing a method to detect it. Retroviruses have RNA genomes, so the identification should involve reverse transcription. cDNA sequencing is appropriate for retroviruses as it involves converting RNA to cDNA, which can then be sequenced. Once the virus is identified through sequencing, a real-time PCR kit can be developed to detect the viral RNA quickly and accurately by targeting specific sequences identified in the cDNA. This approach is more direct and specific compared to antibody detection or symptom-based identification.
