Question: {'question': 'There has been an outbreak of an viral infectious disease in your city. You have been asked to design a molecular diagnostic kit for quick detection of this retrovirus. How would you go about designing this kit?', 'choice1': 'First you identify the virus by performing DNA sequencing. You then develop a PCR kit for  quick and accurate diagnosis', 'choice2': 'First you identify the IgG antibodies for the infection. You then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG antibodies for quick \n and accurate diagnosis.', 'choice3': 'First you identify the virus using the information about the symptoms, provided by the affected patients. You then design a nested PCR kit based on the information for quick diagnosis.', 'choice4': 'First you identify the virus by performing cDNA sequencing.  You then develop a real time PCR kit for quick and accurate diagnosis.'}\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent uSPS', content='Since the disease is caused by a retrovirus, it means the virus has RNA as its genetic material. To design a molecular diagnostic kit, we need to identify the viral RNA. cDNA sequencing would be appropriate because it involves reverse transcribing the viral RNA into DNA, which can then be sequenced to identify the virus. Once identified, a real-time PCR kit can be developed to detect the viral RNA quickly and accurately in patient samples.\n\nAnswer:D)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
