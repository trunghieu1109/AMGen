        "response": "Retroviruses have RNA genomes and require reverse transcription to generate complementary DNA for detection. To design a rapid molecular diagnostic test, one would first isolate viral RNA from patient samples, perform reverse transcription to generate cDNA, sequence that cDNA to confirm viral identity and choose specific conserved regions, then develop a real-time PCR assay with primers and probes targeting those regions. Real-time PCR allows for quick, sensitive, and quantitative detection of the retroviral cDNA in clinical specimens.\n\nAnswer:D)",
