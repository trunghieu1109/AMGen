Question: Example(question='There has been an outbreak of an viral infectious disease in your city. You have been asked to design a molecular diagnostic kit for quick detection of this retrovirus. How would you go about designing this kit?', choice1='First you identify the virus by performing DNA sequencing. You then develop a PCR kit for  quick and accurate diagnosis', choice2='First you identify the IgG antibodies for the infection. You then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG antibodies for quick \n and accurate diagnosis.', choice3='First you identify the virus using the information about the symptoms, provided by the affected patients. You then design a nested PCR kit based on the information for quick diagnosis.', choice4='First you identify the virus by performing cDNA sequencing.  You then develop a real time PCR kit for quick and accurate diagnosis.', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: Retroviruses have RNA genomes and require reverse transcription to generate complementary DNA for detection. To design a rapid molecular diagnostic test, one would first isolate viral RNA from patient samples, perform reverse transcription to generate cDNA, sequence that cDNA to confirm viral identity and choose specific conserved regions, then develop a real-time PCR assay with primers and probes targeting those regions. Real-time PCR allows for quick, sensitive, and quantitative detection of the retroviral cDNA in clinical specimens.
