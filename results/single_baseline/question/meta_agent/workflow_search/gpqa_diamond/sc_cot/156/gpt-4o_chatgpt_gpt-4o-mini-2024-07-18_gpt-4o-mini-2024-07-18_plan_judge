Question: Example(question='There has been an outbreak of an viral infectious disease in your city. You have been asked to design a molecular diagnostic kit for quick detection of this retrovirus. How would you go about designing this kit?', choice1='First you identify the virus by performing DNA sequencing. You then develop a PCR kit for  quick and accurate diagnosis', choice2='First you identify the IgG antibodies for the infection. You then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG antibodies for quick \n and accurate diagnosis.', choice3='First you identify the virus using the information about the symptoms, provided by the affected patients. You then design a nested PCR kit based on the information for quick diagnosis.', choice4='First you identify the virus by performing cDNA sequencing.  You then develop a real time PCR kit for quick and accurate diagnosis.', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: To design a molecular diagnostic kit for a retrovirus, it is crucial to identify the virus's genetic material. Retroviruses are RNA viruses, so the first step is to convert the RNA into complementary DNA (cDNA) using reverse transcription. After that, a real-time PCR kit can be developed to amplify and detect the cDNA, allowing for quick and accurate diagnosis. This approach is more suitable than identifying antibodies or relying solely on symptoms.
