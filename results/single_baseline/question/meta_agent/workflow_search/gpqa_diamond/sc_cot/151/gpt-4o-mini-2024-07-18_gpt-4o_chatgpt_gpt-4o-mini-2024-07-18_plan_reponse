            "You identified a new quorum-sensing peptide in the bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus. You are highly interested if its role in intercellular communication is conserved among the eukaryotes. You treat yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with the peptide and interestingly observe the formation of the shmoo. You want to learn about the proteome of the active chromatin in the shmoo and recover it by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. The least of proteins from which complex below will you observe in your assay?",
            "pre-initiation complex",
            "pre-replication complex",
            "enhancer protein complex",

        "response": "The shmoo is a structure formed during yeast mating, which involves the expression of genes related to mating and cell cycle arrest. The proteome of active chromatin in the shmoo would likely involve proteins related to transcription and gene regulation. The pre-initiation complex is involved in the initiation of transcription, the enhancer protein complex is involved in enhancing transcription, and the nucleosome histone complex is involved in chromatin structure. The pre-replication complex is involved in DNA replication, not transcription, and is less likely to be observed in active chromatin during shmoo formation.\n\nAnswer:B)",
