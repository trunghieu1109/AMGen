            "You identified a new quorum-sensing peptide in the bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus. You are highly interested if its role in intercellular communication is conserved among the eukaryotes. You treat yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with the peptide and interestingly observe the formation of the shmoo. You want to learn about the proteome of the active chromatin in the shmoo and recover it by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. The least of proteins from which complex below will you observe in your assay?",

        "response": "In the context of the question, we are interested in the proteins associated with active chromatin during the formation of the shmoo in yeast. The pre-initiation complex is involved in transcription initiation, the pre-replication complex is involved in DNA replication, the enhancer protein complex is involved in gene regulation, and the nucleosome histone complex is part of chromatin structure. Since the question specifically asks for the least likely complex to be observed in relation to active chromatin during the shmoo formation, we can deduce that the pre-replication complex is not directly related to transcriptional activity and is more associated with DNA replication, which is not the focus here.\n\nAnswer:B",
