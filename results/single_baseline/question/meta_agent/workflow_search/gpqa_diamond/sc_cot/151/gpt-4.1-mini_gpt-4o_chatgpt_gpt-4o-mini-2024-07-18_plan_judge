Question: Example(question='You identified a new quorum-sensing peptide in the bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus. You are highly interested if its role in intercellular communication is conserved among the eukaryotes. You treat yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with the peptide and interestingly observe the formation of the shmoo. You want to learn about the proteome of the active chromatin in the shmoo and recover it by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. The least of proteins from which complex below will you observe in your assay?', choice1='pre-initiation complex', choice2='pre-replication complex', choice3='enhancer protein complex', choice4='nucleosome histone complex', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The question is asking about which protein complex would be least observed in the active chromatin of a shmoo in yeast. Shmoo formation in yeast is related to mating and involves changes in gene expression. The pre-initiation complex is involved in transcription initiation, the enhancer protein complex is involved in enhancing transcription, and the nucleosome histone complex is part of chromatin structure. The pre-replication complex is involved in DNA replication initiation, which is not directly related to transcription or shmoo formation. Therefore, the proteins from the pre-replication complex would be least observed in this context.
