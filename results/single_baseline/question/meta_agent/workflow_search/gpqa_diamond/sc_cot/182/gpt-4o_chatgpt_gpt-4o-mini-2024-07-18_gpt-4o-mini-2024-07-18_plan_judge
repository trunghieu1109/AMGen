Question: Example(question='What is the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product obtained when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess of HI?', choice1='1', choice2='3', choice3='0', choice4='5', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product formed from the reaction of 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid with red phosphorus and excess HI, we need to analyze the structure of the starting compound and the expected changes upon reaction. The reaction with HI typically leads to the saturation of double bonds and potential formation of new bonds. The IHD can be calculated based on the number of rings, double bonds, and overall saturation of the compound. After considering the structural changes and the saturation effects of HI, we can estimate the IHD of the final product.
