Question: Example(question='What is the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product obtained when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess of HI?', choice1='1', choice2='3', choice3='0', choice4='5', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The compound 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid has multiple unsaturated groups. When it is reacted with red phosphorus and excess HI, these conditions typically result in the reduction of double bonds and the conversion of functional groups to saturated forms. The formyl group (aldehyde) and the carboxylic acid group can be reduced to alkane groups, and the double bonds in the vinyl and cyclohexene parts can also be reduced. After complete reduction, the product becomes a fully saturated hydrocarbon. The index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) is calculated based on the number of rings and pi bonds. Since the product is fully saturated, the IHD is 0.
