Question: Example(question='What is the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product obtained when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess of HI?', choice1='1', choice2='3', choice3='0', choice4='5', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) is calculated as the number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. The given compound, 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, has a cyclohexene ring (1 double bond), a vinyl group (1 double bond), a formyl group (1 double bond), and a carboxylic acid group (1 double bond). The total IHD for the starting compound is 4. When this compound is reacted with red phosphorus and excess HI, it typically reduces all double bonds and functional groups to alkanes, removing all unsaturations. Therefore, the product is a fully saturated cyclohexane derivative, which has an IHD of 0.
