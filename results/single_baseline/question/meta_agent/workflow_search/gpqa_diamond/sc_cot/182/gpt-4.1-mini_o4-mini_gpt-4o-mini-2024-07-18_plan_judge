Question: Example(question='What is the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product obtained when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess of HI?', choice1='1', choice2='3', choice3='0', choice4='5', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: We start with 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Treatment with red P and excess HI reduces the aldehyde (–CHO) and carboxylic acid (–COOH) groups to –CH2 (i.e. –CH3 when they become substituents), but leaves C=C bonds intact. The original ring is cyclohex-3-ene (one ring and one double bond) and there is a vinyl substituent at C5 (another C=C). After reduction, the ring retains its double bond (1) and the vinyl substituent retains its double bond (1), plus the ring itself accounts for 1. Thus total index of hydrogen deficiency = 3.
