    <pre>To determine which compound does not show tautomerism, we need to analyze the structures of benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Benzoquinone typically does not exhibit tautomerism due to its stable structure, while cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can exhibit tautomerism. For optical isomerism, we look at methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and can exist in two enantiomeric forms, while dimethyl fumarate is a cis-trans isomer and does not have a chiral center. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism. Based on this analysis, choice 1 is correct: A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate.
