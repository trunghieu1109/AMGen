Question: Example(question='Compounds that have the same molecular formula but are different in their structural arrangement are known as isomers. Isomers have two types, constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but differ in their structures. In stereoisomers, molecules are connected in the same way, but their arrangements in space are different.\nAmong the given compounds (benzoquinone & cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione) the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) and among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate which one will show optical isomerism (B).', choice1='A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate', choice2='A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate', choice3='A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate', choice4='A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: We need to identify which of benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does not show tautomerism, and which of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate vs dimethyl fumarate shows optical isomerism. Benzoquinone lacks alpha hydrogens and tautomerization would break aromaticity, so it does not tautomerize. Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has alpha hydrogens between carbonyls and undergoes ketoâ€“enol tautomerism. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center at C-2 and so shows optical isomerism; dimethyl fumarate has a symmetric trans double bond, no chirality. Thus A=benzoquinone, B=methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which corresponds to choice 3 (C).
