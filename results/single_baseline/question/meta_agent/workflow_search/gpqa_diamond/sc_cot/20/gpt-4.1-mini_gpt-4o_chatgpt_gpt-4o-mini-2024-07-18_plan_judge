Question: Example(question='Compounds that have the same molecular formula but are different in their structural arrangement are known as isomers. Isomers have two types, constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but differ in their structures. In stereoisomers, molecules are connected in the same way, but their arrangements in space are different.\nAmong the given compounds (benzoquinone & cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione) the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) and among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate which one will show optical isomerism (B).', choice1='A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate', choice2='A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate', choice3='A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate', choice4='A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To determine which compound does not show tautomerism, we need to analyze the given compounds. Benzoquinone is a compound that does not have hydrogen atoms that can be easily transferred to form tautomers, while cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo tautomerism due to the presence of keto groups that can enolize. Therefore, A is benzoquinone. For optical isomerism, a compound must have a chiral center. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center at the second carbon atom, making it capable of optical isomerism. Dimethyl fumarate is a symmetrical compound and does not have a chiral center, so it does not show optical isomerism. Therefore, B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.
