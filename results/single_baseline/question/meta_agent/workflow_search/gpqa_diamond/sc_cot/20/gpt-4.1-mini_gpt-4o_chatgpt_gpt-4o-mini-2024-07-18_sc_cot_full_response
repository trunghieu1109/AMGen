Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent IrHm', content='To determine which compound does not show tautomerism, we need to analyze the given compounds. Benzoquinone is a compound that does not have hydrogen atoms that can be easily transferred to form tautomers, while cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo tautomerism due to the presence of keto groups that can enolize. Therefore, A is benzoquinone. For optical isomerism, a compound must have a chiral center. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center at the second carbon atom, making it capable of optical isomerism. Dimethyl fumarate is a symmetrical compound and does not have a chiral center, so it does not show optical isomerism. Therefore, B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
