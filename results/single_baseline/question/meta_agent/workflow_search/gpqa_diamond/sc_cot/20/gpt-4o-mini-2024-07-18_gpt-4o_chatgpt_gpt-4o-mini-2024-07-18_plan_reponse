            "Compounds that have the same molecular formula but are different in their structural arrangement are known as isomers. Isomers have two types, constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but differ in their structures. In stereoisomers, molecules are connected in the same way, but their arrangements in space are different.\nAmong the given compounds (benzoquinone & cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione) the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) and among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate which one will show optical isomerism (B).",
            "A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate",
            "A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate",
            "A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate",

        "response": "First, we need to determine which compound does not show tautomerism. Tautomerism involves the rearrangement of bonds, usually involving hydrogen. Benzoquinone does not show tautomerism, while cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can tautomerize to form enol forms. Therefore, A is benzoquinone. Next, we need to determine which compound will show optical isomerism. Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center at the 2nd carbon, while dimethyl fumarate does not have a chiral center. Therefore, B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\nAnswer:C)",
