Question: Example(question='Compounds that have the same molecular formula but are different in their structural arrangement are known as isomers. Isomers have two types, constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but differ in their structures. In stereoisomers, molecules are connected in the same way, but their arrangements in space are different.\nAmong the given compounds (benzoquinone & cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione) the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) and among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate which one will show optical isomerism (B).', choice1='A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate', choice2='A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate', choice3='A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate', choice4='A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To determine which compound does not show tautomerism, we need to analyze the structures of benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Benzoquinone typically does not exhibit tautomerism due to its stable structure, while cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can exhibit tautomerism. For optical isomerism, we look at methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and can exist in two enantiomeric forms, while dimethyl fumarate is a cis-trans isomer and does not have a chiral center. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism. Based on this analysis, choice 1 is correct: A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate.
