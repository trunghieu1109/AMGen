Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent IrHm', content='First, we need to determine which compound does not show tautomerism. Tautomerism involves the rearrangement of bonds, usually involving hydrogen. Benzoquinone does not show tautomerism, while cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can tautomerize to form enol forms. Therefore, A is benzoquinone. Next, we need to determine which compound will show optical isomerism. Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center at the 2nd carbon, while dimethyl fumarate does not have a chiral center. Therefore, B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
