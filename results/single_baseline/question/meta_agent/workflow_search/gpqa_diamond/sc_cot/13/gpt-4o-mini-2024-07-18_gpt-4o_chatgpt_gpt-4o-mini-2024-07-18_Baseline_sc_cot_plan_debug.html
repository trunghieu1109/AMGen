    <pre>ChIP-seq is a technique used to study protein-DNA interactions, and IKAROS is a transcription factor involved in gene regulation. PFA (paraformaldehyde) fixation is commonly used to cross-link proteins to DNA, but it can sometimes be insufficient for capturing certain interactions. DSG (disuccinimidyl glutarate) is a longer cross-linker that can capture protein-protein interactions more effectively. If ChIP peaks disappear when DSG is added, it suggests that the original interactions were not direct protein-DNA interactions, but rather involved intermediary proteins that DSG could disrupt. Active promoters and enhancers often involve complex protein-DNA interactions, sometimes with intermediary proteins, whereas repeats, introns, and random locations are less likely to involve such complex interactions. Thus, disappearing peaks are most likely at locations with complex protein interactions, such as active promoters and enhancers.
