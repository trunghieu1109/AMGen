Question: Example(question='ChIP-seq on a PFA-fixed sample with an antibody to the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells followed by next-generation sequencing and standard quality control, alignment and peak-calling steps produced ChIP peaks that disappeared when PFA+DSG fixation was used. Where are we most likely to find such disappearing peaks?', choice1='At active promoters and enhancers', choice2='At repeats', choice3='In the introns of large genes', choice4='At random locations in the genome', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: ChIP-seq is a technique used to study protein-DNA interactions, and IKAROS is a transcription factor involved in gene regulation. PFA (paraformaldehyde) fixation is commonly used to cross-link proteins to DNA, but it can sometimes be insufficient for capturing certain interactions. DSG (disuccinimidyl glutarate) is a longer cross-linker that can capture protein-protein interactions more effectively. If ChIP peaks disappear when DSG is added, it suggests that the original interactions were not direct protein-DNA interactions, but rather involved intermediary proteins that DSG could disrupt. Active promoters and enhancers often involve complex protein-DNA interactions, sometimes with intermediary proteins, whereas repeats, introns, and random locations are less likely to involve such complex interactions. Thus, disappearing peaks are most likely at locations with complex protein interactions, such as active promoters and enhancers.
