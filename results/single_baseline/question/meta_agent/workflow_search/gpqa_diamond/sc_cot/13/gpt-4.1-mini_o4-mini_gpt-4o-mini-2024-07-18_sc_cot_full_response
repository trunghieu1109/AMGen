Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent Kdyo', content='ChIP-seq with only PFA often yields artifactual peaks at highly accessible regions (active promoters/enhancers) due to non-specific binding when chromatin is loose. Adding DSG crosslinker strengthens true protein–protein and protein–DNA crosslinks and reduces these low‐affinity interactions, causing such artifactual peaks to disappear. Therefore, disappearing peaks are most likely at active promoters and enhancers.\n\nAnswer:A)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
