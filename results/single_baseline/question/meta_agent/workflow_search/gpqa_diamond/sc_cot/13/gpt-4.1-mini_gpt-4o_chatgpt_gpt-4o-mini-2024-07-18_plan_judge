Question: Example(question='ChIP-seq on a PFA-fixed sample with an antibody to the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells followed by next-generation sequencing and standard quality control, alignment and peak-calling steps produced ChIP peaks that disappeared when PFA+DSG fixation was used. Where are we most likely to find such disappearing peaks?', choice1='At active promoters and enhancers', choice2='At repeats', choice3='In the introns of large genes', choice4='At random locations in the genome', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The ChIP-seq experiment described involves using different fixation methods, PFA alone versus PFA+DSG, which affects the detection of IKAROS binding sites. IKAROS is a transcription factor known to bind to specific DNA regions. The fact that peaks disappear when using PFA+DSG suggests that these regions are sensitive to crosslinking strength or method. DSG is a stronger crosslinker that can stabilize protein-protein interactions more than protein-DNA interactions. Disappearing peaks likely represent regions where IKAROS is indirectly associated with DNA or where the binding is more transient. These characteristics are common in repetitive regions, where proteins might bind indirectly or transiently, and where stronger crosslinking could disrupt these interactions. Therefore, the disappearing peaks are most likely found at repeats.
