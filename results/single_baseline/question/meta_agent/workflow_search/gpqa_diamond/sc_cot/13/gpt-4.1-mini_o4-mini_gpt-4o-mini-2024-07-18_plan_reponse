            "ChIP-seq on a PFA-fixed sample with an antibody to the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells followed by next-generation sequencing and standard quality control, alignment and peak-calling steps produced ChIP peaks that disappeared when PFA+DSG fixation was used. Where are we most likely to find such disappearing peaks?",

        "response": "ChIP-seq with only PFA often yields artifactual peaks at highly accessible regions (active promoters/enhancers) due to non-specific binding when chromatin is loose. Adding DSG crosslinker strengthens true protein\u2013protein and protein\u2013DNA crosslinks and reduces these low\u2010affinity interactions, causing such artifactual peaks to disappear. Therefore, disappearing peaks are most likely at active promoters and enhancers.\n\nAnswer:A)",
