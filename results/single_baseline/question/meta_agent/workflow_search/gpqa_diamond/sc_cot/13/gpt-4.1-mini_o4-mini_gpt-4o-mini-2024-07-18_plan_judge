Question: Example(question='ChIP-seq on a PFA-fixed sample with an antibody to the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells followed by next-generation sequencing and standard quality control, alignment and peak-calling steps produced ChIP peaks that disappeared when PFA+DSG fixation was used. Where are we most likely to find such disappearing peaks?', choice1='At active promoters and enhancers', choice2='At repeats', choice3='In the introns of large genes', choice4='At random locations in the genome', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: ChIP-seq with only PFA often yields artifactual peaks at highly accessible regions (active promoters/enhancers) due to non-specific binding when chromatin is loose. Adding DSG crosslinker strengthens true protein–protein and protein–DNA crosslinks and reduces these low‐affinity interactions, causing such artifactual peaks to disappear. Therefore, disappearing peaks are most likely at active promoters and enhancers.
