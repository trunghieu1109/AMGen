    <pre>To identify the correct reactants for the given name reactions, we need to analyze the products provided for each reaction. The first reaction produces a compound with a specific structure, and we need to determine which of the choices corresponds to the correct reactant that would lead to that product. Similarly, for the second reaction, we need to match the product with the correct reactant. After evaluating the provided choices, it becomes clear which reactants correspond to the products in the reactions.

Answer:A = 2,8-dimethylspiro[4.5]decan-6-ol, B = 4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-one</pre>
