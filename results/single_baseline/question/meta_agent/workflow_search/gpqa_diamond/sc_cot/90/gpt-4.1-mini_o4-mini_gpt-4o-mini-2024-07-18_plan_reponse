        "response": "Cyclohexanone enolate attacks benzaldehyde to give a \u03b2-hydroxy ketone (product 1). Treatment with excess DAST converts the secondary alcohol to a fluoride (inversion at that center) and the ketone to a geminal difluoride at C1. The result is Ph\u2013CH(F)\u2013C6H8F2, i.e. a cyclohexane bearing a 1,1-difluoride at C1 and a benzylic fluoromethyl substituent at C2. This matches choice 2.\n\nAnswer:B)",
