Question: Example(question='cyclohexanone is treated with LDA at low temperature, followed by benzaldehyde. the reaction mixture is then acidified, forming product 1.\n\n1 is then treated with an excess of diethylaminosulfur trifluoride, forming product 2. what is the structure of prodcut 2?', choice1='(S)-2-((R)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one', choice2='((R)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene', choice3='(2R)-1-fluoro-2-((S)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-ol', choice4='((S)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: Cyclohexanone enolate attacks benzaldehyde to give a β-hydroxy ketone (product 1). Treatment with excess DAST converts the secondary alcohol to a fluoride (inversion at that center) and the ketone to a geminal difluoride at C1. The result is Ph–CH(F)–C6H8F2, i.e. a cyclohexane bearing a 1,1-difluoride at C1 and a benzylic fluoromethyl substituent at C2. This matches choice 2.
