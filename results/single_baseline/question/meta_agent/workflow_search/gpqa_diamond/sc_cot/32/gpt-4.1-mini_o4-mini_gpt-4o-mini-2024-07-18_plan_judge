Question: Example(question='Identify the EXO product of the following [4+2] cycloaddition reaction.\n2,5-dimethylthiophene + Furan-2,5-dione + Heat ---> ?', choice1='(3aR,4R,7S,7aS)-4,7-dimethyl-3a,4,7,7a-tetrahydro-4,7-epithioisobenzofuran-1,3-dione', choice2='(3aR,4S,7R,7aS)-4,7-dimethyl-3a,4,7,7a-tetrahydro-4,7-epoxybenzo[c]thiophene-1,3-dione', choice3='(3aR,4R,7S,7aS)-4,7-dimethyl-3a,4,7,7a-tetrahydro-4,7-epoxybenzo[c]thiophene-1,3-dione', choice4='(3aR,4S,7R,7aS)-4,7-dimethyl-3a,4,7,7a-tetrahydro-4,7-epithioisobenzofuran-1,3-dione', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The Dielsâ€“Alder between 2,5-dimethylthiophene and maleic anhydride gives a 7-thiabicyclo[2.2.1]heptene-2,3-dicarboxylic anhydride (an epithioisobenzofuran-1,3-dione). The exo product has the two methyl groups trans to the S-containing bridge, corresponding to 4R,7S in the bicyclic numbering. That matches choice1.
