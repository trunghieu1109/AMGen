Question: Example(question='Identify the EXO product of the following [4+2] cycloaddition reaction.\n2,5-dimethylthiophene + Furan-2,5-dione + Heat ---> ?', choice1='(3aR,4R,7S,7aS)-4,7-dimethyl-3a,4,7,7a-tetrahydro-4,7-epithioisobenzofuran-1,3-dione', choice2='(3aR,4S,7R,7aS)-4,7-dimethyl-3a,4,7,7a-tetrahydro-4,7-epoxybenzo[c]thiophene-1,3-dione', choice3='(3aR,4R,7S,7aS)-4,7-dimethyl-3a,4,7,7a-tetrahydro-4,7-epoxybenzo[c]thiophene-1,3-dione', choice4='(3aR,4S,7R,7aS)-4,7-dimethyl-3a,4,7,7a-tetrahydro-4,7-epithioisobenzofuran-1,3-dione', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition, also known as a Diels-Alder reaction. In this case, the diene is 2,5-dimethylthiophene, and the dienophile is furan-2,5-dione. The exo product is typically the one where the substituents are oriented away from the larger bridge. The sulfur atom in the thiophene ring can be considered as the bridge, and the exo product will have the substituents (methyl groups) oriented away from the larger bridge. This matches the stereochemistry of choice 3.
