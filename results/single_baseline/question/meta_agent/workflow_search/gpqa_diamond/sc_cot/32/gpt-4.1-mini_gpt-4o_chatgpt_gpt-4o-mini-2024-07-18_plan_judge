Question: Example(question='Identify the EXO product of the following [4+2] cycloaddition reaction.\n2,5-dimethylthiophene + Furan-2,5-dione + Heat ---> ?', choice1='(3aR,4R,7S,7aS)-4,7-dimethyl-3a,4,7,7a-tetrahydro-4,7-epithioisobenzofuran-1,3-dione', choice2='(3aR,4S,7R,7aS)-4,7-dimethyl-3a,4,7,7a-tetrahydro-4,7-epoxybenzo[c]thiophene-1,3-dione', choice3='(3aR,4R,7S,7aS)-4,7-dimethyl-3a,4,7,7a-tetrahydro-4,7-epoxybenzo[c]thiophene-1,3-dione', choice4='(3aR,4S,7R,7aS)-4,7-dimethyl-3a,4,7,7a-tetrahydro-4,7-epithioisobenzofuran-1,3-dione', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: In a [4+2] cycloaddition, the diene (2,5-dimethylthiophene) and the dienophile (furan-2,5-dione) will react. The EXO product is typically the one where the substituents on the dienophile are oriented away from the largest bridge in the bicyclic system. In this case, the EXO product for this reaction should have the substituents from the dienophile oriented away from the sulfur in the thiophene ring. The correct stereochemistry must be considered, and the EXO product is typically less sterically hindered. Given the choices, the correct stereochemistry for the EXO product is likely to be (3aR,4R,7S,7aS) with the substituents oriented away from the sulfur.
