Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 3bO5', content='We have decay length L = γ c τ. The survival probability to travel R is P = exp(−R/(γ c τ)). Given R = 30 m and initial γ₀ = 20 yields P₀ = 1/3 = exp(−30/(20 c τ)). So 30/(20 c τ) = ln3, giving c τ = 30/(20 ln3) ≈ 1.365 m. To get P = 2/3, we need exp(−30/(γ c τ)) = 2/3 ⇒ 30/(γ c τ) = ln(3/2) ≈ 0.4055 ⇒ γ = 30/(c τ · 0.4055) ≈ 54.16. The closest choice is 54.\n\nAnswer:D)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
