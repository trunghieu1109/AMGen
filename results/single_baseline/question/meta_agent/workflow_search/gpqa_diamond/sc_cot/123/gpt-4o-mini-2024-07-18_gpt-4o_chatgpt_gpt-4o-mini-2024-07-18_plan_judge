Question: Example(question='Particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector producing new type of particles that travel uninterrupted at ultra-relativistic velocities highly centered around Lorentz factor of ~20. On average, one third of these fast-decaying particles reaches the detector inner walls. \nThe radius of the detector is 30 meters.\n\nWhat Lorentz factor is needed in order to have about two thirds of these particles reaching the detector inner walls?', choice1='28', choice2='40', choice3='68', choice4='54', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To solve the problem, we need to understand the relationship between the Lorentz factor and the distance traveled by particles before they decay. The Lorentz factor (Î³) is related to time dilation, which affects the lifetime of particles moving at relativistic speeds. If the Lorentz factor is increased, the particles will have an effectively longer lifetime and can travel farther before decaying. Currently, with a Lorentz factor of ~20, one third of the particles reach the detector walls. We want two thirds to reach the walls, so we need to find a new Lorentz factor that would allow twice as many particles to reach the walls. The distance a particle can travel is proportional to its lifetime, which is proportional to the Lorentz factor. Therefore, to double the fraction of particles reaching the walls, we need to double the Lorentz factor. Doubling the Lorentz factor from 20 gives us 40.
