Question: Example(question='Particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector producing new type of particles that travel uninterrupted at ultra-relativistic velocities highly centered around Lorentz factor of ~20. On average, one third of these fast-decaying particles reaches the detector inner walls. \nThe radius of the detector is 30 meters.\n\nWhat Lorentz factor is needed in order to have about two thirds of these particles reaching the detector inner walls?', choice1='28', choice2='40', choice3='68', choice4='54', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The problem involves calculating the Lorentz factor needed for a different fraction of particles to reach the detector walls. Given that with a Lorentz factor of 20, one third of the particles reach the walls, we need to find a Lorentz factor where two thirds of the particles reach the walls. The Lorentz factor, Î³, affects the time dilation and length contraction experienced by the particles. With a higher Lorentz factor, particles travel effectively 'longer' distances in their rest frame due to time dilation, allowing more of them to reach the detector walls before decaying. To double the fraction of particles reaching the walls from one third to two thirds, the Lorentz factor must be increased. We can estimate the required Lorentz factor by considering the relationship between the Lorentz factor and the fraction of particles reaching the walls. Doubling the fraction suggests a significant increase in the Lorentz factor. Among the choices, 40 is a reasonable estimate, as it is twice the original Lorentz factor of 20, suggesting that it might allow twice the fraction of particles to reach the walls.
