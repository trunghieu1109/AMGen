            "In an industrial research lab, a scientist performs ethylene polymerization with a homogeneous organometallic catalyst system, generating a polymer of high density. He intends to add a second catalyst system to introduce regular branches in the polymer backbone, also only using ethylene as the reactant. He consults a senior scientist, who gives the following statements. \u201cSuch combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US. One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators. Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step. Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.\u201d\nWhich of these four statements is correct regarding the formation of a polymer with regular branches using only ethylene as the monomer and a dual catalyst system?",

        "response": "To introduce regular branches in polyethylene using only ethylene, one needs a chain\u2010walking catalyst (e.g. Ni or Pd complexes) rather than a group VI metal. Aluminum activators (e.g. MAO) do activate Ni catalysts. Dual systems are not yet commercial at scale in the US in this mode. Noble\u2010metal catalysts (Pd) can perform chain walking to give branches, but their high cost makes them impractical industrially. Thus the only correct statement is that certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.\n\nAnswer:D",
