Question: Example(question='In an industrial research lab, a scientist performs ethylene polymerization with a homogeneous organometallic catalyst system, generating a polymer of high density. He intends to add a second catalyst system to introduce regular branches in the polymer backbone, also only using ethylene as the reactant. He consults a senior scientist, who gives the following statements. “Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US. One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators. Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step. Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.”\nWhich of these four statements is correct regarding the formation of a polymer with regular branches using only ethylene as the monomer and a dual catalyst system?', choice1='Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.', choice2='Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.', choice3='One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.', choice4='Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To determine which statement is correct regarding the formation of a polymer with regular branches using only ethylene as the monomer and a dual catalyst system, we need to evaluate each statement based on known industrial practices and catalyst chemistry. Statement 1 suggests that such systems are already implemented in the US, which is plausible given the advancements in polymer chemistry, but it needs verification. Statement 2 claims that aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step, which may not be true as aluminum-based activators are commonly used in polymerization processes. Statement 3 suggests using a group VIa transition metal catalyst, which is unusual for ethylene polymerization as these metals are not typically used for this purpose. Statement 4 talks about noble metal catalysts being too expensive, which is generally true as noble metals like palladium and platinum are costly, but they are not typically used for this type of polymerization. After evaluating, statement 1 is most likely correct as dual catalyst systems for producing branched polymers are indeed used industrially.
