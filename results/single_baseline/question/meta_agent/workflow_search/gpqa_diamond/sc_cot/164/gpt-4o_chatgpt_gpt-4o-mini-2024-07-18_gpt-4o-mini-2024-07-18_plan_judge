Question: Example(question='In an industrial research lab, a scientist performs ethylene polymerization with a homogeneous organometallic catalyst system, generating a polymer of high density. He intends to add a second catalyst system to introduce regular branches in the polymer backbone, also only using ethylene as the reactant. He consults a senior scientist, who gives the following statements. “Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US. One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators. Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step. Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.”\nWhich of these four statements is correct regarding the formation of a polymer with regular branches using only ethylene as the monomer and a dual catalyst system?', choice1='Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.', choice2='Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.', choice3='One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.', choice4='Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The question asks which statement is correct regarding the use of a dual catalyst system to form a polymer with regular branches using ethylene. The statements provided need to be evaluated for their accuracy based on known chemistry principles and industrial practices. The first statement claims that such systems are implemented industrially, which aligns with known practices. The second statement indicates aluminum-based activators do not work, which is likely true given the context. The third statement suggests the use of group VIa catalysts, which is plausible. The last statement about noble metal catalysts being too expensive is also accurate. However, the question only asks for one correct statement, and the first statement appears to be the most definitive and widely accepted in the context of industrial applications.
