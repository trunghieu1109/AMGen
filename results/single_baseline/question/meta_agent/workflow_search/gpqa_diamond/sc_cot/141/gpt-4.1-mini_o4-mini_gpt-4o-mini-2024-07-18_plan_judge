Question: Example(question='Consider this density matrix\n\n$\\rho=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|\\right)$\n\nWhat is its geometrical position in the qubits space?', choice1='r=(0,0,0)', choice2='r=(1,1,1)', choice3='r=(0,0,1)', choice4='r=(1,1,0)', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: We have ρ = 1/2(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|) = I/2. In the Bloch sphere representation, any single-qubit state can be written as ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where r is the Bloch vector. Here ρ = I/2 implies r = (0,0,0). That corresponds to the center of the Bloch sphere.
