Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent yFvz', content='We have ρ = 1/2(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|) = I/2. In the Bloch sphere representation, any single-qubit state can be written as ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where r is the Bloch vector. Here ρ = I/2 implies r = (0,0,0). That corresponds to the center of the Bloch sphere.\n\nAnswer:A)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
