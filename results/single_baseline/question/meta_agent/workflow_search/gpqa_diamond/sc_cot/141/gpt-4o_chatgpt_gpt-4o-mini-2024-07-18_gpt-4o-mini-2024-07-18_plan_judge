Question: Example(question='Consider this density matrix\n\n$\\rho=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|\\right)$\n\nWhat is its geometrical position in the qubits space?', choice1='r=(0,0,0)', choice2='r=(1,1,1)', choice3='r=(0,0,1)', choice4='r=(1,1,0)', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The given density matrix is a mixed state represented as \rho = \frac{1}{2} (|0\rangle \langle 0| + |1\rangle \langle 1|). This indicates that the system is in a completely mixed state, with equal probabilities of being in the state |0⟩ or |1⟩. In the Bloch sphere representation, a completely mixed state corresponds to the center of the sphere, which is at the origin (0,0,0). Therefore, the geometrical position in the qubits space is at the point r=(0,0,0).
