            "A eukaryotic cell evolved a mechanism to turn macromolecular building blocks into energy. The process occurs in mitochondria, which are cellular energy factories. In the series of redox reactions, the energy from food is stored between the phosphate groups and used as a universal cellular currency. The energy-laden molecules are shuttled out of the mitochondrion to serve in all cellular processes. You discovered a new anti-diabetes drug and want to investigate whether it has an effect on the mitochondria. You set up a range of experiments with your HEK293 cell line. Which of the experiments listed below will not help you discover the mitochondrial role of your drug:",
            "Transformation of cells with recombinant luciferase and luminometer reading after 5 \u03bcM of luciferin addition to the supernatant",
            "Confocal fluorescence microscopy after Mito-RTP staining of the cells",
            "Differential centrifugation extraction of mitochondria followed by the Glucose Uptake Colorimetric Assay Kit ",

        "response": "To determine which experiment will not help discover the mitochondrial role of the drug, we need to assess how each experiment relates to mitochondrial function. Choice 1 involves luciferase and luminescence, which is typically used for ATP measurement, indirectly related to mitochondrial activity. Choice 2 involves Mito-RTP staining, a direct method for visualizing mitochondria. Choice 3 involves extracting mitochondria and performing a glucose uptake assay, which does not directly assess mitochondrial function but rather glucose uptake. Choice 4 involves flow cytometry with a mitochondrial membrane potential dye, which directly assesses mitochondrial function. Therefore, choice 3 is more related to glucose uptake than directly assessing mitochondrial function.\n\nAnswer:C)",
