            "A eukaryotic cell evolved a mechanism to turn macromolecular building blocks into energy. The process occurs in mitochondria, which are cellular energy factories. In the series of redox reactions, the energy from food is stored between the phosphate groups and used as a universal cellular currency. The energy-laden molecules are shuttled out of the mitochondrion to serve in all cellular processes. You discovered a new anti-diabetes drug and want to investigate whether it has an effect on the mitochondria. You set up a range of experiments with your HEK293 cell line. Which of the experiments listed below will not help you discover the mitochondrial role of your drug:",
            "Transformation of cells with recombinant luciferase and luminometer reading after 5 \u03bcM of luciferin addition to the supernatant",

        "response": "To determine which experiment will not help discover the mitochondrial role of the drug, we need to evaluate each option based on its relevance to mitochondrial function. The first option involves luciferase, which measures light output from reactions, but it does not directly assess mitochondrial activity. The second option, confocal microscopy with Mito-RTP staining, is relevant as it visualizes mitochondria. The third option, differential centrifugation and glucose uptake assay, is also relevant as it extracts mitochondria and assesses their function. The fourth option, flow cytometry with a mitochondrial dye, is relevant as it assesses mitochondrial membrane potential. Therefore, the first option is the least relevant to understanding mitochondrial function.\n\nAnswer:A",
