            "A eukaryotic cell evolved a mechanism to turn macromolecular building blocks into energy. The process occurs in mitochondria, which are cellular energy factories. In the series of redox reactions, the energy from food is stored between the phosphate groups and used as a universal cellular currency. The energy-laden molecules are shuttled out of the mitochondrion to serve in all cellular processes. You discovered a new anti-diabetes drug and want to investigate whether it has an effect on the mitochondria. You set up a range of experiments with your HEK293 cell line. Which of the experiments listed below will not help you discover the mitochondrial role of your drug:",
            "Transformation of cells with recombinant luciferase and luminometer reading after 5 \u03bcM of luciferin addition to the supernatant",
            "Confocal fluorescence microscopy after Mito-RTP staining of the cells",
            "Differential centrifugation extraction of mitochondria followed by the Glucose Uptake Colorimetric Assay Kit ",

        "response": "We need the experiment that will NOT help discover the mitochondrial role of the drug. Option 1: luciferase/luciferin luminescence in supernatant does not measure mitochondrial ATP directly but could be adapted to assess ATP levels. Option 2: Mito-RTP staining visualizes mitochondria directly. Option 3: isolating mitochondria then performing a glucose uptake assay is inappropriate because mitochondria do not import glucose. Option 4: JC-1 flow cytometry measures mitochondrial membrane potential. Therefore, experiment 3 will not help investigate mitochondrial function.\n\nAnswer:C)",
