Question: Example(question='Which of the following physical theories never requires regularization at high energies?', choice1='Superstring Theory', choice2='Quantum Electrodynamics', choice3='Quantum Chromodynamics', choice4='Classical Electrodynamics', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: Regularization is needed in quantum field theories to handle ultraviolet divergences. QED and QCD both exhibit UV divergences and require renormalization (a form of regularization). Classical electrodynamics has singularities at point charges but is not formulated as a high-energy quantum theory requiring UV regularization in the same sense. Superstring theory, however, is constructed to be finite at high energies and does not require additional regularization.
