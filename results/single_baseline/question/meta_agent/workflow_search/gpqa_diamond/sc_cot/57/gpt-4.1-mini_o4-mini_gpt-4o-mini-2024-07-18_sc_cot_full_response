Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent jHjk', content='Regularization is needed in quantum field theories to handle ultraviolet divergences. QED and QCD both exhibit UV divergences and require renormalization (a form of regularization). Classical electrodynamics has singularities at point charges but is not formulated as a high-energy quantum theory requiring UV regularization in the same sense. Superstring theory, however, is constructed to be finite at high energies and does not require additional regularization.\n\nAnswer:A)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
