        "response": "Regularization is a technique used to handle infinities that arise in quantum field theories. Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) and Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) are quantum field theories that require regularization to deal with divergences at high energies. Superstring Theory, as a theory of quantum gravity, is constructed to be finite and does not require regularization in the same way as QED and QCD. Classical Electrodynamics, being a classical theory, does not have the same issues with infinities at high energies as quantum field theories do, because it does not involve quantum mechanical effects. Therefore, the theory that never requires regularization at high energies is Classical Electrodynamics.\n\nAnswer:D)",
