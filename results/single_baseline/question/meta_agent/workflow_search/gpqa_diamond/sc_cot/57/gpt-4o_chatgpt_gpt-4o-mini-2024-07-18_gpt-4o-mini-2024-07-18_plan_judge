Question: Example(question='Which of the following physical theories never requires regularization at high energies?', choice1='Superstring Theory', choice2='Quantum Electrodynamics', choice3='Quantum Chromodynamics', choice4='Classical Electrodynamics', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To determine which physical theory does not require regularization at high energies, we need to consider the nature of each theory. Superstring Theory is a high-energy theory that often requires regularization. Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) can encounter divergences that require regularization techniques. Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) also faces similar challenges at high energies. Classical Electrodynamics, on the other hand, does not have these high-energy divergences and does not require regularization. Therefore, the correct answer is Classical Electrodynamics.
