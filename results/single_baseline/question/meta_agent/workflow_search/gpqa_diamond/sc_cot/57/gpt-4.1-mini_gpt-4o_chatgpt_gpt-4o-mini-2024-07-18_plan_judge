Question: Example(question='Which of the following physical theories never requires regularization at high energies?', choice1='Superstring Theory', choice2='Quantum Electrodynamics', choice3='Quantum Chromodynamics', choice4='Classical Electrodynamics', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: Regularization is a technique used in quantum field theories to handle infinities that arise in calculations. Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) and Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) are both quantum field theories that require regularization to deal with divergences at high energies. Superstring Theory, while a candidate for a fundamental theory, also involves complex calculations and can have its own regularization issues. Classical Electrodynamics, on the other hand, is a classical theory and does not involve the same type of infinities as quantum field theories. Therefore, it does not require regularization in the same sense as the quantum theories do.
