            "While designing a high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating at an accelerating voltage of 1000 kV, Mike connected vacuum pumps to create an ultra-high vacuum state (< 10^-9 Torr) in the sample compartment, aiming to minimize the presence of gas molecules for improved electron microscopy. However, as expected, some gas particles remained inside the compartment, as detected by the mass spectrometer. Mike accurately determined the mean free path of these gas molecules in the vacuum state (< 10^-9 Torr) to be \u03bb1, based on factors such as sample compartment volume, pressure, and temperature. However, upon initiating the electron beam, he made an intriguing observation concerning the mean free path based on electron scattering with the gas molecules. He found that the mean free path was no longer equal to \u03bb1; rather, it was \u03bb2, even though the sample compartment temperature remained the same.\n\nWhat can we conclude about \u03bb2 based on the aforementioned scenario?",

        "response": "We compare the mean free path for gas\u2013gas collisions, \u03bb1, to that for electron\u2013gas scattering, \u03bb2. The molecular mean free path is \u03bb1 = (kT)/(\u221a2 \u03c0 d^2 P), where d is the molecular diameter. Electrons, treated as point particles scattering off molecules of cross-sectional area \u03c3e \u2248 \u03c0d^2, have \u03bb2 = (kT)/(\u03c3e P). Thus \u03bb2/\u03bb1 = \u221a2 \u22481.414>1.22, so \u03bb2 exceeds \u03bb1 by at least that factor.\n\nAnswer:D)",
