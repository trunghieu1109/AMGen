proposed answer: The boson X has a mass of 6 GeV. To determine the kinematically allowed decays, we need to consider the masses of the possible decay products. The decay products must have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV. The relevant particles are quark-antiquark pairs and lepton-antilepton pairs. The charm quark (c) has a mass of about 1.27 GeV, and the bottom quark (b) has a mass of about 4.18 GeV. The top quark (t) is much heavier, about 173 GeV, so it cannot be a decay product. The strange quark (s), up quark (u), and down quark (d) are all much lighter than 6 GeV. For leptons, the tau lepton (τ) has a mass of about 1.78 GeV, the muon (μ) has a mass of about 0.105 GeV, and the electron (e) has a mass of about 0.000511 GeV. Thus, the kinematically allowed decays are to pairs of particles where the combined mass is less than or equal to 6 GeV.
