        "response": "The reaction of vicinal diols with nitrous acid (generated from NaNO2 and HCl in water) oxidizes them to \u03b1-diketones. For A, the methoxy group at C2 is hydrolyzed under acidic aqueous conditions to give the 1,2-diol, which is then oxidized to the cyclohexane-1,2-dione. For B, the 2,3-diol is directly oxidized to the hexane-2,3-dione. Thus A = 4-isopropyl-2-methoxycyclohexan-1-ol and B = 5-methylhexane-2,3-diol, corresponding to choice 2.\n\nAnswer:B)",
