    <pre>The reaction described involves converting a compound with a secondary alcohol group into a diketone using NaNO2, HCl, and H2O. This suggests a reaction where the alcohol group is oxidized to a ketone. For compound A, 4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-dione is produced, indicating that the starting material must be a cyclohexanol derivative that allows for oxidation at two positions. For compound B, 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione is produced, suggesting a similar oxidation of a diol. Choice 1 provides A as a cyclohexanone and B as a diol, which matches the expected reactions. Choice 4 provides both A and B as ketones, which would not react further to form diketones. Therefore, choice 1 is the correct selection.
