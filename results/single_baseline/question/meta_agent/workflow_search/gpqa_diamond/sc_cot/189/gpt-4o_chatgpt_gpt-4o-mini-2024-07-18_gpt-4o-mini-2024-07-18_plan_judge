Question: Example(question='The reaction of an electron pair donor, nucleophile (Nu) with an electron pair acceptor is called nucleophilic substitution reaction. An sp3-hybridized electrophile needs to have a leaving group to proceed with the reaction. Substitution reactions have the following two types. One is SN1 and the other is the SN2 reaction. In contrast to the substitution reaction, the elimination reaction involves the removal of a pair or groups of atoms from a molecule. These are chemical reactions in which single carbon-carbon bonded organic compounds are converted to compounds containing double/triple bonds (unsaturated compounds).\nArrange the following nucleophiles more reactive to the poorest reactive in the aqueous solution.\n\n1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate\n2. Hydroxide\n3. Propionate\n4. Methanol\n5. Ethanethiolate', choice1='5, 2, 1, 3 and 4', choice2='2, 5, 1, 4 and 3', choice3='5, 2, 3, 1 and 4', choice4='2, 5, 3, 4 and 3', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To determine the reactivity of the given nucleophiles in aqueous solution, we need to consider their basicity and stability. Generally, stronger bases are more reactive nucleophiles. Among the choices, ethanethiolate (5) is a strong nucleophile due to the negative charge on sulfur, followed by hydroxide (2), which is also a strong nucleophile. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (1) is a less reactive nucleophile compared to hydroxide and ethanethiolate. Propionate (3) is a weaker nucleophile as it is a carboxylate, and methanol (4) is the least reactive due to its neutral nature. Therefore, the order of reactivity from most to least reactive should be: ethanethiolate (5), hydroxide (2), 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (1), propionate (3), and methanol (4). This matches with choice 1: 5, 2, 1, 3 and 4.
