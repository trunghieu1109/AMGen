Question: Example(question='7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene is combined with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature, forming product 1.\n\n1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid, forming 2\n\n2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO, forming 3.\n\n3 is heated at 150C, forming final product 4. how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are there on 4?', choice1='7', choice2='8', choice3='10', choice4='4', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The reaction sequence involves several steps: 
1. Formation of product 1 from 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene with 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide. This likely involves some form of coupling or substitution reaction.
2. Treatment of product 1 with aqueous sulfuric acid to form product 2. This could involve hydrolysis or rearrangement.
3. Treatment of product 2 with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO to form product 3. This step likely involves sulfonation or further functional group modification.
4. Heating product 3 at 150Â°C to form final product 4. This could involve elimination or rearrangement to form a more stable compound.

The final product 4 is likely a polycyclic compound with some functional groups modified or eliminated. The number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms depends on the symmetry and structure of product 4. Given the choices, a reasonable estimate would be that the final product has 7 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, considering potential symmetry and the complexity of the transformations.
