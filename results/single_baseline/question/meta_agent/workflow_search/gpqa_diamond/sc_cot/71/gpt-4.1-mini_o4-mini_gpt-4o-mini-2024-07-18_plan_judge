Question: Example(question='7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene is combined with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature, forming product 1.\n\n1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid, forming 2\n\n2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO, forming 3.\n\n3 is heated at 150C, forming final product 4. how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are there on 4?', choice1='7', choice2='8', choice3='10', choice4='4', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The sequence uses norbornadiene as a masked dienophile in two successive Diels–Alder reactions with 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene, followed by acid-induced cleavage of the tert-butyl ether, oxidation of the resulting tertiary alcohol to a ketone (Parikh–Doering conditions), and finally thermal extrusion to aromatize the framework. The net result is assembly of an anthracene core (C14H10). Anthracene has 10 hydrogens but only four chemically distinct environments (the two peri-hydrogens at positions 1 and 8, the four α-hydrogens at positions 2,7, and the four β-hydrogens at positions 3,6,4,5 give two sets by symmetry). Therefore, the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms is 4.
