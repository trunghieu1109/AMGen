    <pre>The reaction sequence involves several steps: 
1. Formation of product 1 from 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene with 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide. This likely involves some form of coupling or substitution reaction.
2. Treatment of product 1 with aqueous sulfuric acid to form product 2. This could involve hydrolysis or rearrangement.
3. Treatment of product 2 with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO to form product 3. This step likely involves sulfonation or further functional group modification.
4. Heating product 3 at 150Â°C to form final product 4. This could involve elimination or rearrangement to form a more stable compound.

The final product 4 is likely a polycyclic compound with some functional groups modified or eliminated. The number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms depends on the symmetry and structure of product 4. Given the choices, a reasonable estimate would be that the final product has 7 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, considering potential symmetry and the complexity of the transformations.
