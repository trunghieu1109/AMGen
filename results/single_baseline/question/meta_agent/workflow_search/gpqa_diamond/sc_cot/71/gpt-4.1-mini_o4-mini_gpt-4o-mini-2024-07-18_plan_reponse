        "response": "The sequence uses norbornadiene as a masked dienophile in two successive Diels\u2013Alder reactions with 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene, followed by acid-induced cleavage of the tert-butyl ether, oxidation of the resulting tertiary alcohol to a ketone (Parikh\u2013Doering conditions), and finally thermal extrusion to aromatize the framework. The net result is assembly of an anthracene core (C14H10). Anthracene has 10 hydrogens but only four chemically distinct environments (the two peri-hydrogens at positions 1 and 8, the four \u03b1-hydrogens at positions 2,7, and the four \u03b2-hydrogens at positions 3,6,4,5 give two sets by symmetry). Therefore, the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms is 4.\n\nAnswer:D)",
