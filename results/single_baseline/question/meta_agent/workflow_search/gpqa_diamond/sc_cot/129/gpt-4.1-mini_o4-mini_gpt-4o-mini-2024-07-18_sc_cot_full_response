Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 2j6h', content='The Lyman-α rest wavelength is λ₀=1216\u2009Å. To detect it from the ground we need it redshifted into the optical window (≈3500\u2009Å minimum). The required redshift is z=(λ_obs/λ₀)−1≈(3500/1216)−1≈1.88. That corresponds to the choice ≃1.9.\n\nAnswer:A)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
