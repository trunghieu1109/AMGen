Question: Example(question='Large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorb the light from background quasars at Lyman alpha wavelength ~1216 Angstrom. Estimate the lower limit on the redshift of this objects such that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes? ', choice1='1.9\n\n', choice2='2.4', choice3='3', choice4='1.2\n\n', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To determine the lower limit on the redshift (z) such that Lyman alpha absorption can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes, we need to consider the wavelength range accessible to these telescopes. Optical telescopes typically cover the range from about 4000 Angstroms to 7000 Angstroms. The Lyman alpha wavelength is 1216 Angstroms. The observed wavelength (λ_observed) is related to the rest wavelength (λ_rest = 1216 Angstroms) by the redshift formula: λ_observed = λ_rest * (1 + z). For the Lyman alpha line to be observed in the optical range, we set λ_observed to be at least 4000 Angstroms, which is the lower limit of optical detection. Therefore, 4000 = 1216 * (1 + z). Solving for z gives z = (4000/1216) - 1 ≈ 2.29. The closest choice that is greater than this value is 2.4.
