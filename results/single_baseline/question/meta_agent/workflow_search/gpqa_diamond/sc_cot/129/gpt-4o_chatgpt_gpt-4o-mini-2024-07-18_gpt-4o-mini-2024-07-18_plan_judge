Question: Example(question='Large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorb the light from background quasars at Lyman alpha wavelength ~1216 Angstrom. Estimate the lower limit on the redshift of this objects such that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes? ', choice1='1.9\n\n', choice2='2.4', choice3='3', choice4='1.2\n\n', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To detect the Lyman alpha absorption from neutral hydrogen clouds using optical ground-based telescopes, we need to consider the redshift at which the Lyman alpha emission at 1216 Angstroms shifts into the optical range. The Lyman alpha wavelength is redshifted according to the formula: observed wavelength = emitted wavelength * (1 + z). For ground-based optical telescopes, we typically consider the optical range to be around 4000 to 7000 Angstroms. Therefore, we need to find the redshift (z) such that 1216 Angstroms is shifted into this range. The lower limit would be when the observed wavelength is just above 4000 Angstroms. Setting up the equation: 4000 = 1216 * (1 + z), we can solve for z. This gives us a redshift of approximately 2.29, which is closest to choice 2.4.
