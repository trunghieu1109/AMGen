        "response": "The Lyman alpha wavelength is 1216 Angstroms, which is in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum. For a ground-based optical telescope to detect this absorption feature, it must be redshifted into the optical range. The optical range starts at around 4000 Angstroms. The redshift z is given by z = (observed wavelength / rest wavelength) - 1. To find the lower limit on the redshift, we set the observed wavelength to the lower end of the optical range, 4000 Angstroms, and solve for z: z = (4000 / 1216) - 1 \u2248 2.29. Therefore, the closest option that is greater than or equal to this value is 2.4.\n\nAnswer:B)",
