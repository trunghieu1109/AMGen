Question: Example(question='Large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorb the light from background quasars at Lyman alpha wavelength ~1216 Angstrom. Estimate the lower limit on the redshift of this objects such that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes? ', choice1='1.9\n\n', choice2='2.4', choice3='3', choice4='1.2\n\n', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The Lyman-α rest wavelength is λ₀=1216 Å. To detect it from the ground we need it redshifted into the optical window (≈3500 Å minimum). The required redshift is z=(λ_obs/λ₀)−1≈(3500/1216)−1≈1.88. That corresponds to the choice ≃1.9.
