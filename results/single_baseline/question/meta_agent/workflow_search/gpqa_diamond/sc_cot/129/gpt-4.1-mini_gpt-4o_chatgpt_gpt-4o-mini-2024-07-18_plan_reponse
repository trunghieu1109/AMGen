        "response": "To determine the lower limit on the redshift (z) such that Lyman alpha absorption can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes, we need to consider the wavelength range accessible to these telescopes. Optical telescopes typically cover the range from about 4000 Angstroms to 7000 Angstroms. The Lyman alpha wavelength is 1216 Angstroms. The observed wavelength (\u03bb_observed) is related to the rest wavelength (\u03bb_rest = 1216 Angstroms) by the redshift formula: \u03bb_observed = \u03bb_rest * (1 + z). For the Lyman alpha line to be observed in the optical range, we set \u03bb_observed to be at least 4000 Angstroms, which is the lower limit of optical detection. Therefore, 4000 = 1216 * (1 + z). Solving for z gives z = (4000/1216) - 1 \u2248 2.29. The closest choice that is greater than this value is 2.4.\n\nAnswer:B)",
