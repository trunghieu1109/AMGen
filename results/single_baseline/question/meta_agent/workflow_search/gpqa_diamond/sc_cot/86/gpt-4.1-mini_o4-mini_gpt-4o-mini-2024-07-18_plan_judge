Question: Example(question='You have prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound containing 8 carbon atoms in total. Peaks in the FTIR spectrum of this compound indicate the presence of a carbonyl group as well as an aromatic-halogen bond. Identify the correct 1H NMR data for this compound. ', choice1='1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)', choice2='1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)', choice3='1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)', choice4='1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The compound is a di‐substituted benzene with a carbonyl (ketone) substituent (–COCH3) and an aromatic–halogen bond. Total C8: C6 ring + COCH3 (2 C). A para‐ or ortho‐halogenated acetophenone shows four aromatic protons as two doublets (~7.8 and ~7.6 ppm) and a methyl singlet around 2.3 ppm. Choice 4 matches this pattern.
