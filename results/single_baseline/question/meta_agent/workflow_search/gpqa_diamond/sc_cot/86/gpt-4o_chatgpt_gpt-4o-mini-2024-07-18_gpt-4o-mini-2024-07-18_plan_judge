Question: Example(question='You have prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound containing 8 carbon atoms in total. Peaks in the FTIR spectrum of this compound indicate the presence of a carbonyl group as well as an aromatic-halogen bond. Identify the correct 1H NMR data for this compound. ', choice1='1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)', choice2='1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)', choice3='1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)', choice4='1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. The aromatic protons typically resonate in the range of 6.5 to 8.0 ppm. The presence of a carbonyl group may affect the chemical shifts, but the aromatic protons will still be in the expected range. I need to identify which of the given NMR data fits the characteristics of this compound based on the expected chemical shifts for aromatic protons and the carbonyl group.

Answer:1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)
Extracted answer: 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)
Correct answer: 4
