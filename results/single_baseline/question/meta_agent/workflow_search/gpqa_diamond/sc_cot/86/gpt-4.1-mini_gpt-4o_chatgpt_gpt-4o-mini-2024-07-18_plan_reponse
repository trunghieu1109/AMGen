        "response": "The compound is a di-substituted aromatic ring with 8 carbon atoms and contains a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. The aromatic ring will have protons in the aromatic region (around 7-8 ppm) and the carbonyl might cause a shift in nearby protons. The presence of halogen might also affect chemical shifts. Choice 2 has aromatic protons in the expected region (7.8 and 7.6 ppm) and also a singlet at 9.9 ppm, which could be due to a proton near a carbonyl group. The other choices have chemical shifts that don't match well with these expectations.\n\nAnswer:B)",
