Question: {'question': 'You are analyzing a small peptidic compound that has been chemically synthesized. The 1H NMR spectrum of the crude compound appears consistent with the expected molecule, with the exception of two peaks that both correspond to the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar chemical shifts and roughly equal integrals (together they integrate to 1H - the expected integral); based on the coupling pattern, you can rule out spin-spin coupling as an explanation for the duplicate peaks. LC-MS analysis of the crude compound at elevated temperature shows two clearly defined peaks of equal intensities. Both peaks have the same mass spectrum, which is consistent with the expected molecule.

Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent Taim', content='The presence of two peaks for the same alpha-proton in the 1H NMR spectrum, which integrate to the expected total of 1H, suggests that the compound is likely to exist in two forms that are not due to spin-spin coupling. The fact that LC-MS shows two peaks of equal intensities with the same mass spectrum indicates that these forms have the same molecular weight and likely correspond to different stereoisomers. Since the peaks are not due to coupling, the most plausible explanation is that the compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers, which can have different environments leading to distinct NMR signals. Enantiomers would not typically produce two peaks for the same proton in a 1H NMR spectrum if they are not resolved. Therefore, the best answer is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers.\n\nAnswer:B', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
