Question: Example(question='You are analyzing a small peptidic compound that has been chemically synthesized. The 1H NMR spectrum of the crude compound appears consistent with the expected molecule, with the exception of two peaks that both correspond to the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar chemical shifts and roughly equal integrals (together they integrate to 1H - the expected integral); based on the coupling pattern, you can rule out spin-spin coupling as an explanation for the duplicate peaks. LC-MS analysis of the crude compound at elevated temperature shows two clearly defined peaks of equal intensities. Both peaks have the same mass spectrum, which is consistent with the expected molecule. What is the most likely explanation for these observations?', choice1='The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers', choice2='The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers', choice3="'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction", choice4='The compound is contaminated with a precursor', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The 1H NMR spectrum shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton with similar chemical shifts and equal integrals, indicating that the proton environments are very similar but not identical. This suggests the presence of stereoisomers. Since the LC-MS shows two peaks with the same mass spectrum and equal intensities, it indicates the presence of two forms of the compound that have the same mass but different structures. Enantiomers would have identical NMR spectra in a non-chiral environment, so they would not cause two distinct peaks in the NMR. However, diastereoisomers can have different NMR chemical shifts. Therefore, the most likely explanation is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers.
