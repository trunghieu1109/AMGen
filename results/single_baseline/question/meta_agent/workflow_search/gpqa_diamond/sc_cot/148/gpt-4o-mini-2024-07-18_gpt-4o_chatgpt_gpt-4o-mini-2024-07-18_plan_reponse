            "You are analyzing a small peptidic compound that has been chemically synthesized. The 1H NMR spectrum of the crude compound appears consistent with the expected molecule, with the exception of two peaks that both correspond to the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar chemical shifts and roughly equal integrals (together they integrate to 1H - the expected integral); based on the coupling pattern, you can rule out spin-spin coupling as an explanation for the duplicate peaks. LC-MS analysis of the crude compound at elevated temperature shows two clearly defined peaks of equal intensities. Both peaks have the same mass spectrum, which is consistent with the expected molecule. What is the most likely explanation for these observations?",

        "response": "The observations in the 1H NMR spectrum show two peaks for the same alpha-proton with similar chemical shifts and equal integrals, suggesting the presence of two chemically distinct environments for the same proton. The LC-MS analysis shows two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass spectrum, indicating two species with the same molecular weight. The fact that the peaks are of equal intensity and have the same mass spectrum rules out contamination with a precursor. The presence of two distinct environments for the same proton in the NMR suggests stereoisomerism, and since the peaks are equal in intensity, this suggests a mixture of stereoisomers that are not enantiomers, as enantiomers would not show distinct peaks in NMR under normal conditions. Therefore, the most likely explanation is that the compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers, which can have different chemical shifts in NMR.\n\nAnswer:B)",
