    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;You are analyzing a small peptidic compound that has been chemically synthesized. The 1H NMR spectrum of the crude compound appears consistent with the expected molecule, with the exception of two peaks that both correspond to the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar chemical shifts and roughly equal integrals (together they integrate to 1H - the expected integral); based on the coupling pattern, you can rule out spin-spin coupling as an explanation for the duplicate peaks. LC-MS analysis of the crude compound at elevated temperature shows two clearly defined peaks of equal intensities. Both peaks have the same mass spectrum, which is consistent with the expected molecule. What is the most likely explanation for these observations?&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#34;&#39;Double coupling&#39; has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction&#34;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;The compound is contaminated with a precursor&#39;}

    <pre>The 1H NMR shows two distinct peaks for the same α-proton, each integrating to 0.5 H, ruling out coupling. LC-MS at elevated temperature still shows two separate chromatographic peaks of equal intensity but identical mass, indicating two species of the same molecular formula. Enantiomers in an achiral environment would give identical NMR chemical shifts; they also generally coelute unless a chiral column is used. Contamination would show different mass or extra signals. The most plausible explanation is that the α-carbon has epimerized during synthesis, giving a mixture of diastereomers with slightly different retention times and NMR chemical shifts.
