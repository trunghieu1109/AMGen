Question: Example(question='Observations of a quasar across the electromagnetic spectrum are being carried out. Focusing on the near infrared and optical spectrum, there is a peak at wavelength of about 790 nm, and at shorter wavelengths < 790 nm the flux drops significantly.\n\nIf we lived in a universe defined by Lambda-CDM model such that the current Hubble constant is 70 km s^-1 Mpc^-1, matter density parameter is 0.3, dark energy density parameter is 0.7, and universe is flat,\nwhat can be assumed about the value of the comoving distance (for scale factor a=1) of this quasar from the Earth?', choice1='8 Gpc', choice2='9 Gpc', choice3='7 Gpc', choice4='6 Gpc', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The observed peak wavelength of 790 nm suggests a redshifted spectrum. In the Lambda-CDM universe with given parameters, the comoving distance can be estimated using the redshift. The Hubble constant and density parameters can help calculate the expansion history and thus the comoving distance. Typically, such quasars with strong redshifted peaks are very far, often several Gpc away. Considering typical values, the comoving distance is likely around 8 Gpc.
