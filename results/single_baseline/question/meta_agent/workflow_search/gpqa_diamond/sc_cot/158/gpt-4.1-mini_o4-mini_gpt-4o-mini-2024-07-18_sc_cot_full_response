Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent TjFt', content='The sharp drop at λ≈790\u2009nm suggests the Lyman-α break (121.6\u2009nm) is redshifted: 121.6\u2009nm×(1+z)=790\u2009nm ⇒ z≈5.5. In a flat ΛCDM (H0=70, Ωm=0.3, ΩΛ=0.7) the comoving distance to z≈5.5 is ≈7–8\u2009Gpc. Of the given choices, 8\u2009Gpc is the best match.\n\nAnswer:A)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
