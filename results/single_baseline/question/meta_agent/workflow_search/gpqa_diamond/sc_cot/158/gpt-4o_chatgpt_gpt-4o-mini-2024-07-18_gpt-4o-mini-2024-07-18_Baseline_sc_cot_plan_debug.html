    <pre>To determine the comoving distance of the quasar from Earth in a Lambda-CDM universe, we can use the Hubble constant and the density parameters given. The Hubble constant indicates the rate of expansion of the universe, and the comoving distance can be estimated based on the redshift of the quasar, which corresponds to the observed peak wavelength. However, since no redshift is provided, we can infer that the quasar is relatively distant, and using common values for quasars and the given choices, we can estimate that the distance is likely toward the higher end of the provided options. Given the choices of 6 Gpc, 7 Gpc, 8 Gpc, and 9 Gpc, a quasar typically has a comoving distance in the range of several Gpc, and a value of 8 Gpc is a reasonable estimate considering typical distances for known quasars.
