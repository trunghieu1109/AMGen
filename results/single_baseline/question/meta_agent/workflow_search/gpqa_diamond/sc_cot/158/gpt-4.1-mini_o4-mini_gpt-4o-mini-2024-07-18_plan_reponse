            "Observations of a quasar across the electromagnetic spectrum are being carried out. Focusing on the near infrared and optical spectrum, there is a peak at wavelength of about 790 nm, and at shorter wavelengths < 790 nm the flux drops significantly.\n\nIf we lived in a universe defined by Lambda-CDM model such that the current Hubble constant is 70 km s^-1 Mpc^-1, matter density parameter is 0.3, dark energy density parameter is 0.7, and universe is flat,\nwhat can be assumed about the value of the comoving distance (for scale factor a=1) of this quasar from the Earth?",

        "response": "The sharp drop at \u03bb\u2248790\u2009nm suggests the Lyman-\u03b1 break (121.6\u2009nm) is redshifted: 121.6\u2009nm\u00d7(1+z)=790\u2009nm \u21d2 z\u22485.5. In a flat \u039bCDM (H0=70, \u03a9m=0.3, \u03a9\u039b=0.7) the comoving distance to z\u22485.5 is \u22487\u20138\u2009Gpc. Of the given choices, 8\u2009Gpc is the best match.\n\nAnswer:A)",
