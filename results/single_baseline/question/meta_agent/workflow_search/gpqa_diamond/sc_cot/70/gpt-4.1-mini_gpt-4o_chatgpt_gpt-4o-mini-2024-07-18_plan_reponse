            "Astronomers are studying a system of five exoplanets with circular orbits, discovered through the TTV method. The planets (designated as Planet_1 through Planet_5), which are in orbital resonance, have orbital periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Assuming these planets possess the same albedo, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2?",

        "n": "Baseline sc_cot",
        "response": "The equilibrium temperature of a planet is inversely proportional to the square root of its orbital distance, assuming the same albedo. The orbital period T is related to the orbital distance a by Kepler's third law, where T^2 is proportional to a^3. Therefore, a is proportional to T^(2/3). The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures (T_eq) of two planets is then the inverse of the square root of the ratio of their orbital distances. Given the orbital periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5, the distance ratio for Planet_4 to Planet_2 is (3.5/2)^(2/3). The temperature ratio is then (2/3.5)^(1/2 * 2/3), which simplifies to (2/3.5)^(1/3). Calculating this gives approximately 0.83.\n\nAnswer:B)",
