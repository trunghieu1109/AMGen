Question: Example(question='Astronomers are studying a system of five exoplanets with circular orbits, discovered through the TTV method. The planets (designated as Planet_1 through Planet_5), which are in orbital resonance, have orbital periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Assuming these planets possess the same albedo, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2?', choice1='~0.75', choice2='~0.83', choice3='~0.69', choice4='~0.57', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: Equilibrium temperature T_eq∝(stellar flux)^{1/4}∝a^{-1/2}, and from Kepler’s law a∝P^{2/3}, so T_eq∝P^{-1/3}. Here P2=2,P4=3.5 (in same units), so T4/T2=(3.5/2)^{−1/3}=(1.75)^{−1/3}=1/(1.75^{1/3})≈1/1.205≈0.83.
