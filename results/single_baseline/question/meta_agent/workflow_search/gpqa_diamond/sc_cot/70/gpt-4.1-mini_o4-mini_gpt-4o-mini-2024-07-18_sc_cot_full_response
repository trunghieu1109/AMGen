Question: {'question': 'Astronomers are studying a system of five exoplanets with circular orbits, discovered through the TTV method. The planets (designated as Planet_1 through Planet_5), which are in orbital resonance, have orbital periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Assuming these planets possess the same albedo, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2?', 'choice1': '~0.75', 'choice2': '~0.83', 'choice3': '~0.69', 'choice4': '~0.57'}\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 6GRO', content='Equilibrium temperature T_eq∝(stellar flux)^{1/4}∝a^{-1/2}, and from Kepler’s law a∝P^{2/3}, so T_eq∝P^{-1/3}. Here P2=2,P4=3.5 (in same units), so T4/T2=(3.5/2)^{−1/3}=(1.75)^{−1/3}=1/(1.75^{1/3})≈1/1.205≈0.83.\n\nAnswer:B)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
