            "Astronomers are studying a system of five exoplanets with circular orbits, discovered through the TTV method. The planets (designated as Planet_1 through Planet_5), which are in orbital resonance, have orbital periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Assuming these planets possess the same albedo, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2?",

            "~0.83",

        "response": "The equilibrium temperature of a planet is inversely proportional to the square root of its orbital radius, assuming the same albedo and stellar luminosity. The orbital period is proportional to the 3/2 power of the orbital radius (Kepler's third law). For planets in resonance, we compare the orbital periods. Given the periods are in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5, we find the orbital radius ratio using T \u221d r^(3/2), so r \u221d T^(2/3). The ratio of orbital radii for Planet_4 and Planet_2 is (3.5/2)^(2/3). The temperature ratio is then (r_4/r_2)^(-1/2). Calculating, (3.5/2)^(2/3) \u2248 1.396, and (1.396)^(-1/2) \u2248 0.845. Therefore, the closest answer is ~0.83.\n\nAnswer:B)",
