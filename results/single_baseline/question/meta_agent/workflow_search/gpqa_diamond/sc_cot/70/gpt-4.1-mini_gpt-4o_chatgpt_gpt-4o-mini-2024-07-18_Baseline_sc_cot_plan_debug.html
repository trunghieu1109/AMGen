    <pre>The equilibrium temperature of a planet is inversely proportional to the square root of its orbital distance, assuming the same albedo. The orbital period T is related to the orbital distance a by Kepler&#39;s third law, where T^2 is proportional to a^3. Therefore, a is proportional to T^(2/3). The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures (T_eq) of two planets is then the inverse of the square root of the ratio of their orbital distances. Given the orbital periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5, the distance ratio for Planet_4 to Planet_2 is (3.5/2)^(2/3). The temperature ratio is then (2/3.5)^(1/2 * 2/3), which simplifies to (2/3.5)^(1/3). Calculating this gives approximately 0.83.
