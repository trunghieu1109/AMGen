Question: Example(question='Astronomers are studying a system of five exoplanets with circular orbits, discovered through the TTV method. The planets (designated as Planet_1 through Planet_5), which are in orbital resonance, have orbital periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Assuming these planets possess the same albedo, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2?', choice1='~0.75', choice2='~0.83', choice3='~0.69', choice4='~0.57', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we can use the formula for equilibrium temperature, which is T ‚àù (L / d)^(1/4), where L is the luminosity and d is the distance from the star. Since the planets are in orbital resonance and have the same albedo, we can relate their distances based on their orbital periods. The periods are in the ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. We can find the ratio of the distances (and thus the temperatures) based on the periods. The ratios of the periods are 1, 2, 2.5, 3.5, and 5, which correspond to the distances as the square root of the period ratios. Therefore, the temperature ratio T4/T2 = (P2/P4)^(1/4). The periods are 3.5 and 2, so we find the ratio of their periods and take the fourth root. After calculating this, we compare it with the given choices.
