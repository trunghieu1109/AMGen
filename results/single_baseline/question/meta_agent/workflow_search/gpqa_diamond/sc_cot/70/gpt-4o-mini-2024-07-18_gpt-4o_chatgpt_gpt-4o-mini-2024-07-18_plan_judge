Question: Example(question='Astronomers are studying a system of five exoplanets with circular orbits, discovered through the TTV method. The planets (designated as Planet_1 through Planet_5), which are in orbital resonance, have orbital periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Assuming these planets possess the same albedo, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2?', choice1='~0.75', choice2='~0.83', choice3='~0.69', choice4='~0.57', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The equilibrium temperature of a planet is inversely proportional to the square root of its orbital radius, assuming the same albedo and stellar luminosity. The orbital period is proportional to the 3/2 power of the orbital radius (Kepler's third law). For planets in resonance, we compare the orbital periods. Given the periods are in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5, we find the orbital radius ratio using T ∝ r^(3/2), so r ∝ T^(2/3). The ratio of orbital radii for Planet_4 and Planet_2 is (3.5/2)^(2/3). The temperature ratio is then (r_4/r_2)^(-1/2). Calculating, (3.5/2)^(2/3) ≈ 1.396, and (1.396)^(-1/2) ≈ 0.845. Therefore, the closest answer is ~0.83.
