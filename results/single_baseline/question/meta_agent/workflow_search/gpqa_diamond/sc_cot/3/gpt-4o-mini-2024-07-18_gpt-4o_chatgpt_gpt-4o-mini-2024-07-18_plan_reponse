        "response": "In our universe, Maxwell's equations include Gauss's law for magnetism, which states that the divergence of the magnetic field is zero (div B = 0), implying no magnetic monopoles exist. If magnetic monopoles were to exist, this equation would need to change to account for the presence of isolated magnetic charges. Additionally, Ampere's law with Maxwell's addition relates the curl of the magnetic field to the electric current and the rate of change of the electric field. If magnetic monopoles exist, there would be a symmetry where the curl of the magnetic field would also relate to the magnetic current density. Therefore, both the equations related to the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field would be affected.\n\nAnswer:B)",
