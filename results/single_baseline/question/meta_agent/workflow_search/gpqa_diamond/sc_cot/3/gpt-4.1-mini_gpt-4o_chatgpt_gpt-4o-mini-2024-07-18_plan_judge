', choice2='The ones related to the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field.', choice3='The ones related to the circulation of the electric field and the divergence of the magnetic field.  ', choice4='The one related to the circulation of the magnetic field and the flux of the electric field. ', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: In our universe, Maxwell's equations consist of Gauss's law for electricity, Gauss's law for magnetism, Faraday's law of induction, and Ampère's law with Maxwell's addition. Gauss's law for magnetism states that the divergence of the magnetic field is zero, reflecting the absence of magnetic monopoles. If magnetic monopoles exist, this equation would change to account for a non-zero divergence of the magnetic field. Additionally, the existence of magnetic monopoles would introduce a magnetic current term in the modified Ampère's law, affecting the curl of the magnetic field. Therefore, the equations related to the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field would be different in this parallel universe.
