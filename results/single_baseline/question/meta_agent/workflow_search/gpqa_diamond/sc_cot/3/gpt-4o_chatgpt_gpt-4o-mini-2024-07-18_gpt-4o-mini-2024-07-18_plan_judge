Question: Example(question='In a parallel universe where a magnet can have an isolated North or South pole, Maxwellâ€™s equations look different. But, specifically, which of those equations are different?', choice1='The one related to the divergence of the magnetic field. ', choice2='The ones related to the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field.', choice3='The ones related to the circulation of the electric field and the divergence of the magnetic field.  ', choice4='The one related to the circulation of the magnetic field and the flux of the electric field. ', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: In a parallel universe where magnets can have isolated poles, Maxwell's equations would indeed change. The divergence of the magnetic field relates to the existence of magnetic monopoles. In our universe, the divergence of the magnetic field is zero, indicating no isolated poles. If isolated poles existed, this equation would change. The curl of the magnetic field, however, is not directly affected by the existence of monopoles. Therefore, the correct choice would be the one related to the divergence of the magnetic field.
