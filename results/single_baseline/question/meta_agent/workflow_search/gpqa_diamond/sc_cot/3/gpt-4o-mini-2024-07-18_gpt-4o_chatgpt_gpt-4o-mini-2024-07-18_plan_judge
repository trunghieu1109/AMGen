Question: Example(question='In a parallel universe where a magnet can have an isolated North or South pole, Maxwellâ€™s equations look different. But, specifically, which of those equations are different?', choice1='The one related to the divergence of the magnetic field. ', choice2='The ones related to the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field.', choice3='The ones related to the circulation of the electric field and the divergence of the magnetic field.  ', choice4='The one related to the circulation of the magnetic field and the flux of the electric field. ', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: In our universe, Maxwell's equations include Gauss's law for magnetism, which states that the divergence of the magnetic field is zero (div B = 0), implying no magnetic monopoles exist. If magnetic monopoles were to exist, this equation would need to change to account for the presence of isolated magnetic charges. Additionally, Ampere's law with Maxwell's addition relates the curl of the magnetic field to the electric current and the rate of change of the electric field. If magnetic monopoles exist, there would be a symmetry where the curl of the magnetic field would also relate to the magnetic current density. Therefore, both the equations related to the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field would be affected.
