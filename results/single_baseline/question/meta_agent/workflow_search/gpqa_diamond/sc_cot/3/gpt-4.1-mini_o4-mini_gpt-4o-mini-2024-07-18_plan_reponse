        "response": "Maxwell\u2019s equations in the presence of magnetic monopoles require adding magnetic charge density to Gauss\u2019s law for magnetism (\u2207\u00b7B\u22600) and adding a magnetic current term to Faraday\u2019s law (\u2207\u00d7E). The other two equations remain structurally the same. Thus the divergence of B and the curl of E equations change.\n\nAnswer:C)",
