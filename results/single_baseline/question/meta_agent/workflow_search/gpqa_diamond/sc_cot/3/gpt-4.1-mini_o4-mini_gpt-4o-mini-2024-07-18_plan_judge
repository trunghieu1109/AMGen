Question: Example(question='In a parallel universe where a magnet can have an isolated North or South pole, Maxwell’s equations look different. But, specifically, which of those equations are different?', choice1='The one related to the divergence of the magnetic field. ', choice2='The ones related to the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field.', choice3='The ones related to the circulation of the electric field and the divergence of the magnetic field.  ', choice4='The one related to the circulation of the magnetic field and the flux of the electric field. ', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: Maxwell’s equations in the presence of magnetic monopoles require adding magnetic charge density to Gauss’s law for magnetism (∇·B≠0) and adding a magnetic current term to Faraday’s law (∇×E). The other two equations remain structurally the same. Thus the divergence of B and the curl of E equations change.
