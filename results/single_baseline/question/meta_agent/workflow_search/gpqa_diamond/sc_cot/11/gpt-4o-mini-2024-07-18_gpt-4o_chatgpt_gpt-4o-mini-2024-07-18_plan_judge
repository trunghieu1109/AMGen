Question: Example(question='Find KE of product particles in,\nPi(+) = mu(+) + nu\nhere Pi(+) is stationary.\nRest mass of Pi(+) &  mu(+) is 139.6 MeV & 105.7 MeV respectively.', choice1='2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV', choice2='7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV', choice3='3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV', choice4='4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The decay of a stationary Pi(+) into a mu(+) and a neutrino involves conserving both energy and momentum. The total energy of the system initially is the rest energy of the Pi(+), which is 139.6 MeV. After the decay, this energy is shared between the kinetic energy of the mu(+) and the neutrino (nu). We can use conservation of energy and momentum to find the kinetic energies of the decay products. The rest mass energy of the mu(+) is 105.7 MeV, so the energy available for kinetic energy is 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 33.9 MeV. The neutrino is massless (or very light), so its energy is entirely kinetic. Using the conservation of momentum and energy equations, we can solve for the kinetic energies of the mu(+) and the neutrino. This typically involves solving two equations: one for energy conservation and one for momentum conservation. The correct solution gives the kinetic energy values for both the mu(+) and the neutrino.
