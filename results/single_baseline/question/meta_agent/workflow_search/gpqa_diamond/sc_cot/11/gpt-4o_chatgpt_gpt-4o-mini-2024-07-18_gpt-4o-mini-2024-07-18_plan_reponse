        "response": "To find the kinetic energy (KE) of the product particles in the decay process Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu, we need to apply conservation of energy. The rest mass energy of the initial particle Pi(+) must equal the sum of the rest mass energies and kinetic energies of the final particles. Given the rest masses, we can calculate the kinetic energies based on the conservation of energy principle. The rest mass energy of Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV and for mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. The neutrino (nu) is nearly massless. We can set up the equation: KE(Pi) = KE(mu) + KE(nu) + (Rest mass energy of mu + Rest mass energy of nu). By solving this, we can determine the KE values and compare them with the choices provided.\n\nAnswer:choice1",
