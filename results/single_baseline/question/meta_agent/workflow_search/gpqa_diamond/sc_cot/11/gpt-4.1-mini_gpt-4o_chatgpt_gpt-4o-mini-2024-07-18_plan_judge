Question: Example(question='Find KE of product particles in,\nPi(+) = mu(+) + nu\nhere Pi(+) is stationary.\nRest mass of Pi(+) &  mu(+) is 139.6 MeV & 105.7 MeV respectively.', choice1='2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV', choice2='7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV', choice3='3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV', choice4='4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The process described is the decay of a stationary pion (Pi+) into a muon (mu+) and a neutrino (nu). Since the pion is initially at rest, its total energy is its rest mass energy, which is 139.6 MeV. By conservation of energy, the total energy of the products (mu+ and nu) must also be 139.6 MeV. The rest mass energy of the muon is 105.7 MeV, so the kinetic energy of the muon is the total energy minus its rest mass energy. The neutrino is assumed to have negligible mass and thus has kinetic energy equal to its total energy. The total kinetic energy of the products is the difference between the initial rest mass energy of the pion and the sum of the rest mass energies of the products. Total KE = 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 33.9 MeV. This energy is shared between the muon and the neutrino. By momentum conservation and typical decay kinematics, the heavier muon will have less kinetic energy than the neutrino. Checking the choices, we calculate the KE of mu+ and nu. If mu+ has KE of 4.12 MeV, nu will have 33.9 MeV - 4.12 MeV = 29.78 MeV, which matches choice 4.
