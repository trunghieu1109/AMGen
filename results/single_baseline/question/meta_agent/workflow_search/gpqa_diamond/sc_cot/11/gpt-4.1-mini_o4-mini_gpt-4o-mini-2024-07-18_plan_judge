Question: Example(question='Find KE of product particles in,\nPi(+) = mu(+) + nu\nhere Pi(+) is stationary.\nRest mass of Pi(+) &  mu(+) is 139.6 MeV & 105.7 MeV respectively.', choice1='2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV', choice2='7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV', choice3='3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV', choice4='4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: For a two-body decay at rest, the decay momentum is p = (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2)/(2 m_pi) = (139.6^2 - 105.7^2)/(2·139.6) ≃ 29.8 MeV/c. The neutrino (massless) has E_nu = p c ≃ 29.8 MeV (its kinetic energy). The muon energy is E_mu = (m_pi^2 + m_mu^2)/(2 m_pi) ≃ 109.82 MeV, so its kinetic energy is KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu ≃ 109.82 - 105.7 = 4.12 MeV. This corresponds to choice 4.
