Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent gCuk', content='For a two-body decay at rest, the decay momentum is p = (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2)/(2 m_pi) = (139.6^2 - 105.7^2)/(2·139.6) ≃ 29.8 MeV/c. The neutrino (massless) has E_nu = p c ≃ 29.8 MeV (its kinetic energy). The muon energy is E_mu = (m_pi^2 + m_mu^2)/(2 m_pi) ≃ 109.82 MeV, so its kinetic energy is KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu ≃ 109.82 - 105.7 = 4.12 MeV. This corresponds to choice 4.\n\nAnswer:D)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
