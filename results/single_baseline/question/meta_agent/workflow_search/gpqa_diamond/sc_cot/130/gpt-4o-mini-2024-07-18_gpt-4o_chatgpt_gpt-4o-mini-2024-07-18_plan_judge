Question: Example(question='A dicarboxylic acid containing a cis-alkene was dehydrated to the corresponding anhydride. This anhydride, which has a single peak (7 ppm) in its 1H NMR spectrum and two peaks (137 ppm, 165 ppm) in its 13C spectrum, was reacted with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to yield two products (a major and a minor product). Both products have a molecular formula of C13H16O3.\n\nThe 2D NOESY NMR spectra of the major and minor products were taken. A cross-peak was present in the spectrum of the major product but absent (or very weak) in spectrum of the minor product.\n\nIn the spectrum of the major product, which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak (integrals are taken from the corresponding 1H NMR)?', choice1='A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm', choice2='A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm', choice3='A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm', choice4='A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The problem involves a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene that forms an anhydride, which is then reacted with a diene to form two products. The major product has a NOESY cross-peak indicating spatial proximity between two protons. The 1H NMR peaks suggest the presence of methyl groups and possibly methylene or methine protons. The cross-peak in the major product's NOESY spectrum likely indicates interactions between protons that are close in space, such as those on adjacent carbons or in a similar environment. The options suggest various combinations of proton signals. The correct choice will involve signals that are spatially close, as indicated by the NOESY cross-peak. Given the typical chemical shifts, the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm are likely to be spatially close, indicating a connection in the major product's structure.
