            "A dicarboxylic acid containing a cis-alkene was dehydrated to the corresponding anhydride. This anhydride, which has a single peak (7 ppm) in its 1H NMR spectrum and two peaks (137 ppm, 165 ppm) in its 13C spectrum, was reacted with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to yield two products (a major and a minor product). Both products have a molecular formula of C13H16O3.\n\nThe 2D NOESY NMR spectra of the major and minor products were taken. A cross-peak was present in the spectrum of the major product but absent (or very weak) in spectrum of the minor product.\n\nIn the spectrum of the major product, which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak (integrals are taken from the corresponding 1H NMR)?",

        "response": "The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene that forms an anhydride. The anhydride has a single peak in 1H NMR and two peaks in 13C NMR, suggesting symmetry. Upon reaction with tetramethylcyclopentadiene, two products are formed with the same formula, C13H16O3. The major product has a NOESY cross-peak, indicating spatial proximity between certain protons. The choices describe possible NMR resonances and their connections. The cross-peak is likely between protons that are spatially close due to the stereochemistry of the major product. The 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm likely corresponds to methyl groups on the cyclopentadiene, and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm could be protons on a methylene group that are close in space to the methyl groups. This spatial proximity would give rise to a NOESY cross-peak.\n\nAnswer:A)",
