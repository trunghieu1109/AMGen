            "A dicarboxylic acid containing a cis-alkene was dehydrated to the corresponding anhydride. This anhydride, which has a single peak (7 ppm) in its 1H NMR spectrum and two peaks (137 ppm, 165 ppm) in its 13C spectrum, was reacted with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to yield two products (a major and a minor product). Both products have a molecular formula of C13H16O3.\n\nThe 2D NOESY NMR spectra of the major and minor products were taken. A cross-peak was present in the spectrum of the major product but absent (or very weak) in spectrum of the minor product.\n\nIn the spectrum of the major product, which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak (integrals are taken from the corresponding 1H NMR)?",

        "response": "To determine which two resonances are connected by the cross-peak in the 2D NOESY NMR spectrum of the major product, we need to analyze the possible connections based on the given choices. The presence of a cross-peak indicates spatial proximity between the protons of the two resonances. The major product is likely to have distinct chemical environments that allow for this correlation. The choice with the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm suggests a significant structural relationship that could lead to a cross-peak due to spatial proximity, especially considering the integration values. Therefore, I will select this option as the most plausible answer.\n\nAnswer:A",
