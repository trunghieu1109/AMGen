            "A dicarboxylic acid containing a cis-alkene was dehydrated to the corresponding anhydride. This anhydride, which has a single peak (7 ppm) in its 1H NMR spectrum and two peaks (137 ppm, 165 ppm) in its 13C spectrum, was reacted with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to yield two products (a major and a minor product). Both products have a molecular formula of C13H16O3.\n\nThe 2D NOESY NMR spectra of the major and minor products were taken. A cross-peak was present in the spectrum of the major product but absent (or very weak) in spectrum of the minor product.\n\nIn the spectrum of the major product, which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak (integrals are taken from the corresponding 1H NMR)?",

        "response": "We have a Diels\u2013Alder between maleic anhydride (the cis-alkene dicarboxylic acid dehydrated) and 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. The adducts are endo (major) and exo (minor). The key NOE in the endo adduct arises from close spatial proximity of the anhydride methine protons (C2/C3, appearing as a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm) to the methyl groups on the alkene carbons (vinylic methyls, giving a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm). The bridgehead methyls (~1.0 ppm) lie too far for a strong NOE. Thus the observed cross-peak in the major product connects the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm with the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.\n\nAnswer:A)",
