Question: Example(question='You have prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The FTIR spectrum of this compound shows absorption peaks indicating the presence of an ester group. The 1H NMR spectrum shows six signals: two signals corresponding to aromatic-H, two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups. There are no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups. Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, or C12H14O2.', choice1='C12H14O2', choice2='C12H12O2', choice3='C11H14O2', choice4='C11H12O2', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The compound is a di-substituted aromatic ring with an ester group, which contributes an absorption peak in the FTIR spectrum. The 1H NMR spectrum shows six signals: two aromatic protons, two vinyl protons (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two methyl groups. The absence of methylene protons (-CH2-) suggests the presence of two methyl groups rather than ethyl or longer alkyl chains. The compound contains an ester group, which typically contributes -COO- in the formula. The aromatic ring contributes C6H4 (since it is di-substituted), the ester group contributes C2H2O2, and the two methyl groups contribute C2H6. Adding these together gives C10H12O2. However, the closest option provided is C12H14O2, which accounts for additional carbon and hydrogen from the vinyl group.

Answer:C12H14O2
Extracted answer: C12H14O2
Correct answer: 4
