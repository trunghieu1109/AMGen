Question: Example(question='You have prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The FTIR spectrum of this compound shows absorption peaks indicating the presence of an ester group. The 1H NMR spectrum shows six signals: two signals corresponding to aromatic-H, two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups. There are no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups. Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, or C12H14O2.', choice1='C12H14O2', choice2='C12H12O2', choice3='C11H14O2', choice4='C11H12O2', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To determine the chemical formula of the compound, we analyze the information given. The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring, which suggests it has a benzene-like structure. The presence of an ester group indicates that there is a carbonyl (C=O) and an alkoxy (–O–R) group. The 1H NMR spectrum shows six signals: two for aromatic protons, two for vinyl protons, and two for methyl (–CH3) groups, with no signals for –CH2 groups. This suggests that the compound is likely symmetrical with two methyl groups and an ester. The total number of carbons can be deduced from the signals: 4 from the aromatic (2 from the aromatic protons and 2 from the vinyl), plus 2 from the methyl groups, totaling 6, plus additional carbons from the ester. The possible formulas provided are C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, and C12H14O2. The presence of two methyl groups and the structure suggests the compound is likely C12H14O2, as it accounts for the extra hydrogen atoms needed for the two methyl groups and the overall structure. Therefore, the answer is C12H14O2.

Answer:C12H14O2
Extracted answer: C12H14O2
Correct answer: 4
