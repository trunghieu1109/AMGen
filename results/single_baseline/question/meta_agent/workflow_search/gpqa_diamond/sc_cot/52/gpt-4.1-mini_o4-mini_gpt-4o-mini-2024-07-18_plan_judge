Question: Example(question='You have prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The FTIR spectrum of this compound shows absorption peaks indicating the presence of an ester group. The 1H NMR spectrum shows six signals: two signals corresponding to aromatic-H, two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups. There are no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups. Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, or C12H14O2.', choice1='C12H14O2', choice2='C12H12O2', choice3='C11H14O2', choice4='C11H12O2', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: We have a di-substituted (para only) aromatic ring showing only 2 aromatic proton signals (each integrating to 2H). The FTIR shows an ester, and the 1H NMR has two vinyl signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets) and two methyl signals. The doublet of quartets for one vinyl proton indicates coupling to both the other vinyl proton (trans, large J) and to a methyl group on the adjacent sp2 carbon. Thus the side chain is an α-methylcinnamate (Ar─CH═C(CH3)─COOCH3). Para-substitution of the ring (with a methyl group as the other substituent) gives the observed aromatic pattern and two methyl signals: one from the vinyl methyl (doublet) and one from the ester OCH3 (singlet). Counting all atoms yields C11H12O2. This matches choice D).
