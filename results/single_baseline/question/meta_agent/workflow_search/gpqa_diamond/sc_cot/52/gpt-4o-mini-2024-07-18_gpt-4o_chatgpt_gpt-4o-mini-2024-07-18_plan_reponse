            "You have prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The FTIR spectrum of this compound shows absorption peaks indicating the presence of an ester group. The 1H NMR spectrum shows six signals: two signals corresponding to aromatic-H, two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two signals corresponding to \u2013CH3 groups. There are no signals corresponding to \u2013CH2 groups. Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, or C12H14O2.",

        "response": "The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with an ester group. The FTIR confirms the ester group. The 1H NMR shows six signals: two aromatic-H, two vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two \u2013CH3 groups. The absence of \u2013CH2 signals suggests the ester is not attached to a \u2013CH2 group. The aromatic ring likely has four hydrogens, consistent with a di-substituted benzene. The two vinyl-H suggest an alkene group, likely part of the ester. Two \u2013CH3 groups suggest additional methyl groups. The molecular formula must account for these observations. C12H14O2 can account for the aromatic ring (C6H4), two vinyl-H (C2H2), and two \u2013CH3 (C2H6), along with the ester (C1O2).\n\nAnswer:C12H14O2",
