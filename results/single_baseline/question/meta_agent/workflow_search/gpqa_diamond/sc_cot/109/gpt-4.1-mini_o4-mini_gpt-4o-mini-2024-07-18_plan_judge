Question: Example(question="Which of the following stars can be detected with both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at the Keck Observatory? Please refer to the links below for more information about the observatories. It should be noted that with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed, while with HIRES, stars brighter than 16 V mag can be observed. For the sake of simplicity, let's disregard the pointing limits of the telescopes (such as maximum and minimum elevations) as well as the altitudes of the telescopes.\n\nLinks:\nParanal Observatory: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranal_Observatory\nW. M. Keck Observatory: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._M._Keck_Observatory\n\n\nStar1 - RA = 15 deg and DEC = -75 deg, absolute V magnitude of 15.5 mag and located at 10 pc distance from us.\n\nStar2 - RA = 30 deg and DEC = 55 deg, apparent V magnitude of 16.5 mag and located at 5 pc distance from us.\n\nStar3 - RA = 11 h and DEC = 48 deg, apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us. Note that the total absorption in the V band is related to the color excess in B-V with a coefficient equal to 3.1.\n\nStar4 - RA = 85 deg and DEC = -48 deg, absolute V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.4 mag and located at 10 pc distance from us. Note that the total absorption in the V band is related to the color excess in B-V with a coefficient equal to 3.1.\n\nStar5 - RA = 10 h and DEC = 60 deg, absolute V magnitude of 16.5 mag and located at 5 pc distance from us.", choice1='Star1 and Star4', choice2='Star4 and Star5', choice3='Star2 and Star3', choice4='Star3 and Star5', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: First, determine which stars have apparent V magnitudes below both instrument limits (ESPRESSO <17 mag; HIRES <16 mag).

Star1: M_V=15.5 at 10 pc → m=15.5 (no extinction) → detectable by both.
Star2: m=16.5 → too faint for HIRES.
Star3: given m=15.5 (extinction already included in “apparent”) → detectable by both.
Star4: M_V=15.5 at 10 pc → m=15.5; A_V=3.1×0.4=1.24 → m_obs=16.74 → too faint for HIRES.
Star5: M_V=16.5 at 5 pc → m=16.5−1.505≈15.0 → detectable by both.

Check choices for pairs both <16: only Star3 and Star5 satisfy both limits. That is choice D).
