    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#34;Which of the following stars can be detected with both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at the Keck Observatory? Please refer to the links below for more information about the observatories. It should be noted that with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed, while with HIRES, stars brighter than 16 V mag can be observed. For the sake of simplicity, let&#39;s disregard the pointing limits of the telescopes (such as maximum and minimum elevations) as well as the altitudes of the telescopes.\n\nLinks:\nParanal Observatory: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranal_Observatory\nW. M. Keck Observatory: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._M._Keck_Observatory\n\n\nStar1 - RA = 15 deg and DEC = -75 deg, absolute V magnitude of 15.5 mag and located at 10 pc distance from us.\n\nStar2 - RA = 30 deg and DEC = 55 deg, apparent V magnitude of 16.5 mag and located at 5 pc distance from us.\n\nStar3 - RA = 11 h and DEC = 48 deg, apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us.

    <pre>To determine which stars can be detected with both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs, we need to calculate the apparent V magnitudes of the stars based on their absolute magnitudes and distances. The formula for apparent magnitude (m) is: m = M + 5 * log10(d) - 5, where M is the absolute magnitude and d is the distance in parsecs. 

1. **Star1**: Absolute V magnitude = 15.5 mag, distance = 10 pc. 
   Apparent magnitude = 15.5 + 5 * log10(10) - 5 = 15.5 + 5 - 5 = 15.5 mag (observable by both).

2. **Star2**: Apparent V magnitude = 16.5 mag (observable by both).

3. **Star3**: Apparent V magnitude = 15.5 mag (observable by both).

4. **Star4**: Absolute V magnitude = 15.5 mag, distance = 10 pc. 
   Apparent magnitude = 15.5 + 5 * log10(10) - 5 = 15.5 + 5 - 5 = 15.5 mag (observable by both).

5. **Star5**: Absolute V magnitude = 16.5 mag, distance = 5 pc. 
   Apparent magnitude = 16.5 + 5 * log10(5) - 5 = 16.5 + 5 * 0.699 - 5 = 16.5 + 3.495 - 5 = 14.995 mag (observable by both).

Now we check which stars have apparent magnitudes that are bright enough for both ESPRESSO (brighter than 17 mag) and HIRES (brighter than 16 mag): 
- Star1: 15.5 mag (yes)
- Star2: 16.5 mag (yes)
- Star3: 15.5 mag (yes)
- Star4: 15.5 mag (yes)
- Star5: 14.995 mag (yes)

The choices given are:
- Star1 and Star4: Both can be observed.
- Star4 and Star5: Both can be observed.
- Star2 and Star3: Both can be observed.
- Star3 and Star5: Both can be observed.

Since all selected stars can be observed by both spectrographs, the correct answer must be one of the pairs that include stars that can be observed. The pairs Star1 and Star4, Star4 and Star5, Star2 and Star3, and Star3 and Star5 are all valid. However, the question asks for which stars can be detected with both spectrographs, and we can confirm that Star1 and Star4 are both observable by both instruments. Thus, the answer is &#39;Star1 and Star4&#39;.
