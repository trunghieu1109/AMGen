For the sake of simplicity, let&#39;s disregard the pointing limits of the telescopes (such as maximum and minimum elevations) as well as the altitudes of the telescopes.\n\nLinks:\nParanal Observatory: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranal_Observatory\nW.

    <pre>To determine which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES, we need to calculate their apparent V magnitudes and compare them to the observatories&#39; limits. ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag, while HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag.

1. Star1: Absolute V magnitude is 15.5 mag, and it&#39;s at 10 pc. Apparent magnitude = 15.5 + 5 * log10(10/10) = 15.5 mag.
   - Star1 is brighter than 16 mag, so it can be observed by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

2. Star2: Apparent V magnitude is 16.5 mag.
   - Star2 is brighter than 17 mag but fainter than 16 mag, so it can only be observed by ESPRESSO.

3. Star3: Apparent V magnitude is 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag.
   - Total absorption A(V) = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 1.86 mag.
   - Corrected apparent magnitude = 15.5 + 1.86 = 17.36 mag.
   - Star3 is fainter than 17 mag, so it cannot be observed by either ESPRESSO or HIRES.

4. Star4: Absolute V magnitude is 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.4 mag, and it&#39;s at 10 pc.
   - Apparent magnitude = 15.5 + 5 * log10(10/10) = 15.5 mag.
   - Total absorption A(V) = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 1.24 mag.
   - Corrected apparent magnitude = 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74 mag.
   - Star4 is brighter than 17 mag but fainter than 16 mag, so it can only be observed by ESPRESSO.

5. Star5: Absolute V magnitude is 16.5 mag, and it&#39;s at 5 pc.
   - Apparent magnitude = 16.5 + 5 * log10(5/10) = 16.5 - 1.505 = 14.995 mag.
   - Star5 is brighter than 16 mag, so it can be observed by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

Stars that can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES: Star1 and Star5.
