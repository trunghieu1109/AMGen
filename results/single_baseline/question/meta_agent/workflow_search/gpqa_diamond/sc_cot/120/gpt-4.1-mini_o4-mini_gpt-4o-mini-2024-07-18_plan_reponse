            "When saturated epoxides are reacted with organocuprates, the alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring. In the disubstituted epoxides, inversion of configuration occurs at a carbon to which Nu is added.

        "response": "Identify epoxide on cyclohexane: trimethyl-epoxycyclohexane opens at less hindered epoxy carbon (C2) with inversion at that center. The attacked center (C2) in substrate is S, inversion gives R. The nonattacked center (C1) retains R. Original methyl centers C3, C4 remain R. Thus product is (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol, corresponding to choice3.\n\nAnswer:C)",
