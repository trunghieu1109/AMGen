    <pre>The compound (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane is a bicyclic epoxide. When reacting with Me2CuLi, the methyl group will attack the less hindered carbon of the epoxide, which is the carbon at position 6. This attack will result in the ring opening of the epoxide and inversion of configuration at the carbon being attacked. In this case, the attack at C-6 will invert its configuration from S to R. After the attack, the resulting product will have a methyl group at C-6, and the stereochemistry will be adjusted accordingly. The product will be a cyclohexanol derivative with the methyl group added to the less hindered carbon, and the original stereochemistry at C-6 will be inverted.
