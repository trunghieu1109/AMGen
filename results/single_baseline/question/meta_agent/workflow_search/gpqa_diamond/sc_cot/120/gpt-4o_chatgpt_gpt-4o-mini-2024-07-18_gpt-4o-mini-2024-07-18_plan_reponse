            "When saturated epoxides are reacted with organocuprates, the alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring. In the disubstituted epoxides, inversion of configuration occurs at a carbon to which Nu is added.

        "response": "To determine the product of the reaction between (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo [4.1.0] heptane and Me2CuLi, we need to analyze the structure of the starting epoxide and the regioselectivity of the reaction with the organocuprate. The reaction will introduce the methyl group at the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring, and inversion of configuration will occur at the carbon where the nucleophile attacks. Based on the provided options, we need to identify which product corresponds to this transformation.\n\nAnswer:A",
