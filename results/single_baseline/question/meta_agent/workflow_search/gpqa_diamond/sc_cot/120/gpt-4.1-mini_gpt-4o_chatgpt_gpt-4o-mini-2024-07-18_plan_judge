Question: Example(question='When saturated epoxides are reacted with organocuprates, the alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring. In the disubstituted epoxides, inversion of configuration occurs at a carbon to which Nu is added. Identify the product when (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo [4.1.0] heptane is reacted with Me2CuLi:', choice1='(1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol', choice2='(1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol ', choice3='(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol ', choice4='(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol ', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: The given compound is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo [4.1.0] heptane. This is a bicyclic epoxide where the epoxide ring is between carbons 6 and 7. Organocuprates such as Me2CuLi open epoxides at the less hindered carbon with inversion of configuration. Here, the less hindered carbon is C6, which is the bridgehead carbon, and the nucleophile will attack this carbon, resulting in the opening of the epoxide ring. The methyl group from Me2CuLi will add to C6, and inversion of configuration at C6 will occur. The configuration at C4 is retained since it is not involved in the reaction, and the epoxide ring opens to form a cyclohexanol structure. The resulting product will have a methyl group added to C6, with inversion, and the other groups retaining their configuration. This leads to the product being (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.
