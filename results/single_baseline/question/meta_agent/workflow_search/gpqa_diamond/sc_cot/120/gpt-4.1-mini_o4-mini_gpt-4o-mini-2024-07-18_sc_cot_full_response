Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent a9bL', content='Identify epoxide on cyclohexane: trimethyl-epoxycyclohexane opens at less hindered epoxy carbon (C2) with inversion at that center. The attacked center (C2) in substrate is S, inversion gives R. The nonattacked center (C1) retains R. Original methyl centers C3, C4 remain R. Thus product is (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol, corresponding to choice3.\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
