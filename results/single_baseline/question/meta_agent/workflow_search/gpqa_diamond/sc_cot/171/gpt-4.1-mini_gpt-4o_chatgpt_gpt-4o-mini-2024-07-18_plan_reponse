            "Two stars are being studied. It has been observed that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2. In fact, the energy difference between the considered energy levels was determined to be approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J. Assuming that the stellar photospheres are in LTE, which of these equations for the effective temperatures of the stars (T_1 and T_2) is correct?",

        "response": "We are given that the energy difference between the levels is 1.38 x 10^(-23) J, and the excitation of iron atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2. In LTE, the population of energy levels follows the Boltzmann distribution: N_1/N_2 = exp(-E/kT). For star_1, N_1/N_2 = 2 * (N_1/N_2 for star_2). Therefore, 2 = exp(-E/kT_1) / exp(-E/kT_2) = exp(-E(1/T_1 - 1/T_2)/k). Taking the natural logarithm, ln(2) = -E(1/T_1 - 1/T_2)/k. Solving for the temperatures, we get ln(2) = E(1/T_2 - 1/T_1)/k. This matches the form of choice 4.\n\nAnswer:D)",
