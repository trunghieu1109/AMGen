Question: Example(question='Two stars are being studied. It has been observed that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2. In fact, the energy difference between the considered energy levels was determined to be approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J. Assuming that the stellar photospheres are in LTE, which of these equations for the effective temperatures of the stars (T_1 and T_2) is correct?', choice1='ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]\n', choice2='ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]\n', choice3='ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n', choice4='ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: Under LTE, the ratio of excited‐state populations n_j∝e^{−E/(kT)}. Given n_j(1)/n_j(2)=2, we have:
2=exp[−E/(kT1)+E/(kT2)] ⇒ ln2=E/k*(1/T2−1/T1).
Since E/k≈1 (1.38×10−23 J≈k_B), this reduces to ln2=(T1−T2)/(T1*T2). That is choice 4.
