Question: Example(question="You identified a new ligand-receptor pair initially expressed in the neural crest cells and want to understand the developmental fate of their interaction. The receptor is a monomeric transmembrane barrel with eight alpha helices, four extracellular helices, and three beta sheets that create a binding site for the ligand. The ligand is a coiled-coil of two alpha helices. You create a bicistronic lox-Cre vector with the ligand ORF at the 5' position, fused to mCherry; the receptor ORF is at the 3' and fused to the eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and upstream of the receptor is the IRES regulatory element. Between the ligand ORF and mCherry, there is a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, and between the receptor and the eGFP, there is a stop in the lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. You had also raised antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and now use them to test the construct expression on the Western blot after plasmid transfection to primary astrocyte culture. Total proteins give a signal proportional to the actin loading. You finally breed a mouse model homozygous for your construct in the wt background. You cross it to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice; after the offspring is born you visualize them under the fluorescent confocal microscope. You do not observe a green signal. Which of the answers below explains the most likely reason for it?", choice1='ligand and the receptor are in a paracrine relationship', choice2='the receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame', choice3='the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing', choice4='the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The question describes a genetic construct where a ligand and receptor are expressed in a controlled manner using a Cre-lox system. The ligand is fused to mCherry and the receptor to eGFP, with stop cassettes that are flanked by loxP and lox2272 sites, respectively. The construct is designed to express the ligand and receptor in the presence of Cre recombinase. The SOX10-Cre mice express Cre in neural crest-derived cells, which should remove the stop cassettes and allow expression of mCherry and eGFP. However, no green signal (eGFP) is observed. This suggests that the receptor-eGFP fusion protein is not being expressed or is not fluorescent. The reason could be a frame shift, preventing eGFP from being expressed correctly, or another issue such as localization or folding problems. The options provided are: ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship (which does not affect fluorescence), receptor-eGFP not in frame (which would prevent green fluorescence), missing enhancer (which could prevent expression, but the IRES should allow expression), and receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi (which might affect localization but not necessarily fluorescence). The most likely reason for no green signal is that the receptor-eGFP is not in frame, preventing eGFP from being expressed correctly.
