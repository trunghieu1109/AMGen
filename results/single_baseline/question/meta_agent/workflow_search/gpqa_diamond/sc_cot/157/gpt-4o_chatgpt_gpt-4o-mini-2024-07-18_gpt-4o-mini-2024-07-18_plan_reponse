            "In an inactive state, a transcription factor subunit awaits an activation signal from the membrane phosphorylation cascade. Upon phosphorylation on the Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, shuttles into the nucleus, and serves in gene transcription. A missense mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. You observe that a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Which of the following molecular phenotypes is most likely observed in the presence of mutation Y?",
            "loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype",
            "protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype",
            "protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele",
            "change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype",

        "response": "The question describes two mutations: a recessive loss-of-function mutation X in the transactivation domain and a heterozygous dominant-negative mutation Y in the dimerization domain. A dominant-negative mutation typically interferes with the function of the wild-type protein, often leading to a loss of function. Given that mutation Y is in the dimerization domain, it is likely to disrupt the ability of the transcription factor to dimerize properly. This could lead to issues such as protein degradation or a loss-of-function phenotype due to the inability to form functional dimers. The choices suggest different phenotypes, and the most likely outcome of a dominant-negative mutation in this context would be that it disrupts the normal function of the wild-type allele, potentially leading to protein degradation or a loss of function. Therefore, the most fitting answer is that mutation Y causes protein degradation and results in a loss-of-function of the wild-type allele.\n\nAnswer:C",
