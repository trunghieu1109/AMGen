            "In an inactive state, a transcription factor subunit awaits an activation signal from the membrane phosphorylation cascade. Upon phosphorylation on the Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, shuttles into the nucleus, and serves in gene transcription. A missense mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. You observe that a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Which of the following molecular phenotypes is most likely observed in the presence of mutation Y?",
            "loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype",
            "protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype",
            "protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele",
            "change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype",

        "response": "The question describes a transcription factor that must dimerize to become active. A heterozygous mutation in the dimerization domain that is dominant-negative will allow the mutant protein to bind (dimerize) with the wild-type protein, but the resulting heterodimers will be nonfunctional. This leads to loss of overall transcription factor function despite the presence of one normal allele. Among the choices, protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype best matches dominant-negative interference at the dimerization step.\n\nAnswer:B)",
