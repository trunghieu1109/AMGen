Question: Example(question='In an inactive state, a transcription factor subunit awaits an activation signal from the membrane phosphorylation cascade. Upon phosphorylation on the Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, shuttles into the nucleus, and serves in gene transcription. A missense mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. You observe that a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Which of the following molecular phenotypes is most likely observed in the presence of mutation Y?', choice1='loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype', choice2='protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype', choice3='protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele', choice4='change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: Mutation Y is in the dimerization domain and is a dominant-negative mutation. This means that the mutated protein can still interact with the wild-type protein but disrupts its function. In dominant-negative mutations, the mutated protein often interferes with the function of the wild-type protein, leading to a loss-of-function phenotype. Since the mutation is in the dimerization domain, it likely affects the dimerization process. This could lead to protein aggregation or improper dimerization that disrupts function, resulting in a loss-of-function phenotype. Therefore, the most likely molecular phenotype is protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype.
