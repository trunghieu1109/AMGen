Question: Example(question='In an inactive state, a transcription factor subunit awaits an activation signal from the membrane phosphorylation cascade. Upon phosphorylation on the Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, shuttles into the nucleus, and serves in gene transcription. A missense mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. You observe that a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Which of the following molecular phenotypes is most likely observed in the presence of mutation Y?', choice1='loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype', choice2='protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype', choice3='protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele', choice4='change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The transcription factor requires dimerization to function in gene transcription. A dominant-negative mutation in the dimerization domain implies that the mutant protein can still interact with the wild-type protein but disrupts its function. Thus, the presence of mutation Y likely leads to the formation of non-functional dimers, resulting in a loss-of-function phenotype. Protein aggregation is a common result of improper dimerization or folding. Therefore, the most likely molecular phenotype is protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype.
