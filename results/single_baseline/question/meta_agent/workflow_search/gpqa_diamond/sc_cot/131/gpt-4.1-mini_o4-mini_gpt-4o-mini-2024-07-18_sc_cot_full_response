Question: {'question': 'The 1H NMR spectrum of a solution containing a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14 exhibits two signals (two singlets) at around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. There are also three signals at around 2.2 ppm (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio. Which two compounds are present in the mixture from the following options: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, and 1,4-diethylbenzene.', 'choice1': '1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene', 'choice2': '1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene', 'choice3': '1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene', 'choice4': '1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene'}\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent TujJ', content='The NMR shows two aromatic singlets (2H each) from two different highly symmetric tetramethylbenzenes. The alkyl region has three singlets in a 12\u2009:\u20096\u2009:\u20096 ratio (24H total), implying each isomer has two equivalent CH3 pairs (6H each), with one signal pair coincident (6H+6H=12H). Only the 1,2,4,5- and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzenes both give two 6H methyl singlets and one aromatic singlet, and their methyl shifts overlap for one set to yield 12H. Thus choice D.\n\nAnswer:D)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
