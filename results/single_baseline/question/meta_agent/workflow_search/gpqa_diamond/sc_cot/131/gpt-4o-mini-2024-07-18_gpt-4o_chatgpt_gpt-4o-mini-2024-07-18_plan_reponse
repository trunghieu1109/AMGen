        "response": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the NMR data and match it with the given compounds. The 1H NMR spectrum shows two signals at around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio, which indicates two types of aromatic protons in equal amounts. There are also three signals at around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio, indicating three types of methyl protons in this ratio. \n\nLet's analyze the given compounds:\n\n1. 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: This compound has two types of aromatic protons (para to each other) and two types of methyl groups (2:2 ratio).\n2. 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene: This compound has two types of aromatic protons (meta to each other) and three types of methyl groups (2:1:1 ratio).\n3. 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene: This compound has four types of aromatic protons (different chemical environments) and four types of methyl groups (1:1:1:1 ratio).\n4. 1,4-diethylbenzene: This compound has one type of aromatic protons and two types of ethyl groups.\n\nThe spectrum with two aromatic signals in a 1:1 ratio and three methyl signals in a 2:1:1 ratio matches 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. The other compound must have two types of aromatic protons in a 1:1 ratio, which matches 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene. \n\nTherefore, the compounds present are 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\nAnswer:A)",
