Question: Example(question='The 1H NMR spectrum of a solution containing a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14 exhibits two signals (two singlets) at around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. There are also three signals at around 2.2 ppm (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio. Which two compounds are present in the mixture from the following options: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, and 1,4-diethylbenzene.', choice1='1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene', choice2='1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene', choice3='1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene', choice4='1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The question provides a 1H NMR spectrum analysis of a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds. The two signals at around 6.7 ppm indicate that both compounds have similar aromatic protons, and the 2:1:1 ratio of the signals at around 2.2 ppm suggests different environments for the protons on the alkyl groups. The compounds listed have different substitution patterns that affect their NMR signals. By considering the symmetry and the expected NMR signals based on substitution patterns, we can deduce which two compounds fit the given data.

Answer:1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene
Extracted answer: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene
Correct answer: 4
