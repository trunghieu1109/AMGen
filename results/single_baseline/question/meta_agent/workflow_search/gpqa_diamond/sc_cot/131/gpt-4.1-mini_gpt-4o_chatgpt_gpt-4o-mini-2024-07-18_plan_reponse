            "The 1H NMR spectrum of a solution containing a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14 exhibits two signals (two singlets) at around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. There are also three signals at around 2.2 ppm (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio.

        "response": "The NMR spectrum shows two signals at around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio, which suggests each compound has one aromatic proton environment. The three signals at around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio indicate three types of methyl groups. \n\n1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene has one aromatic proton environment (two equivalent protons) and two types of methyl groups, which would give a 2:1 ratio for the methyl signals. \n\n1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene has two aromatic proton environments (two protons) and three types of methyl groups, which would give a 1:1:1 ratio for the methyl signals. \n\n1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene has two aromatic proton environments (two protons) and two types of methyl groups, which would give a 2:1 ratio for the methyl signals. \n\n1,4-diethylbenzene has one aromatic proton environment (four equivalent protons) and two types of ethyl groups, which would not match the 2:1:1 ratio for the methyl signals. \n\nThe compounds that match the observed NMR data are 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\nAnswer:A)",
