Question: Example(question='The 1H NMR spectrum of a solution containing a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14 exhibits two signals (two singlets) at around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. There are also three signals at around 2.2 ppm (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio. Which two compounds are present in the mixture from the following options: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, and 1,4-diethylbenzene.', choice1='1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene', choice2='1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene', choice3='1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene', choice4='1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the NMR data and match it with the given compounds. The 1H NMR spectrum shows two signals at around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio, which indicates two types of aromatic protons in equal amounts. There are also three signals at around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio, indicating three types of methyl protons in this ratio. 

Let's analyze the given compounds:

1. 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: This compound has two types of aromatic protons (para to each other) and two types of methyl groups (2:2 ratio).
2. 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene: This compound has two types of aromatic protons (meta to each other) and three types of methyl groups (2:1:1 ratio).
3. 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene: This compound has four types of aromatic protons (different chemical environments) and four types of methyl groups (1:1:1:1 ratio).
4. 1,4-diethylbenzene: This compound has one type of aromatic protons and two types of ethyl groups.

The spectrum with two aromatic signals in a 1:1 ratio and three methyl signals in a 2:1:1 ratio matches 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. The other compound must have two types of aromatic protons in a 1:1 ratio, which matches 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene. 

Therefore, the compounds present are 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.
