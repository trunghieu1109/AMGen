Question: Example(question='The 1H NMR spectrum of a solution containing a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14 exhibits two signals (two singlets) at around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. There are also three signals at around 2.2 ppm (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio. Which two compounds are present in the mixture from the following options: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, and 1,4-diethylbenzene.', choice1='1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene', choice2='1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene', choice3='1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene', choice4='1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The NMR spectrum shows two signals at around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio, which suggests each compound has one aromatic proton environment. The three signals at around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio indicate three types of methyl groups. 

1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene has one aromatic proton environment (two equivalent protons) and two types of methyl groups, which would give a 2:1 ratio for the methyl signals. 

1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene has two aromatic proton environments (two protons) and three types of methyl groups, which would give a 1:1:1 ratio for the methyl signals. 

1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene has two aromatic proton environments (two protons) and two types of methyl groups, which would give a 2:1 ratio for the methyl signals. 

1,4-diethylbenzene has one aromatic proton environment (four equivalent protons) and two types of ethyl groups, which would not match the 2:1:1 ratio for the methyl signals. 

The compounds that match the observed NMR data are 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.
