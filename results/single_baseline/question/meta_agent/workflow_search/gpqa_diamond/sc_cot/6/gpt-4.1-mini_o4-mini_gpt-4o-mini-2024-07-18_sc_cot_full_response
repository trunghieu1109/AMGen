Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent cXsv', content='The pair-production threshold occurs when E_gamma * E_CMB ≈ (m_e c^2)^2. Here m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV = 5.11×10^5 eV, so (m_e c^2)^2 ≈ 2.61×10^11 eV^2. With E_CMB ≈ 10^-3 eV, the threshold gamma-ray energy is E_gamma ≈ 2.61×10^11 eV^2 / 10^-3 eV = 2.61×10^14 eV = 2.61×10^5 GeV.\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
