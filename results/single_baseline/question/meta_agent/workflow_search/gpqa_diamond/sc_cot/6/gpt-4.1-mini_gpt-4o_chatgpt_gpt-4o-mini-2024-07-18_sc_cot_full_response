Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent cXsv', content='To find the energy of gamma-rays that would have their lifetimes limited by annihilation with CMB photons, we can use the condition for pair production: the center-of-mass energy must be at least 2 times the rest mass energy of an electron (2 * 0.511 MeV = 1.022 MeV). The energy of a CMB photon is given as 10^-3 eV. In the center-of-mass frame, the energy of the gamma-ray E_γ and the CMB photon ε must satisfy the condition E_γ * ε ≈ (m_e * c^2)^2, where m_e * c^2 = 0.511 MeV. Therefore, E_γ ≈ (0.511 MeV)^2 / (10^-3 eV) = 2.6 * 10^5 GeV.\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
