        "response": "To determine the energy of gamma-rays that would have their lifetimes limited by annihilation with CMB photons into electron-positron pairs, we consider the threshold energy for the process \\( \\gamma \\gamma \\rightarrow e^+ e^- \\). The threshold condition is given by the invariant mass of the two photons being at least twice the rest mass energy of the electron (since an electron and a positron are created). The rest mass energy of an electron is \\( m_e c^2 = 0.511 \\text{ MeV} \\). The average energy of CMB photons is \\( 10^{-3} \\text{ eV} \\). In the center-of-mass frame, the energy of each photon must satisfy \\( 2 E_{\\gamma} E_{\\text{CMB}} \\geq (2 m_e c^2)^2 \\). Solving for \\( E_{\\gamma} \\), we find \\( E_{\\gamma} \\geq \\frac{(2 \\, 0.511 \\, \\text{MeV})^2}{2 \\, 10^{-3} \\, \\text{eV}} \\approx 2.6 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV} \\). Therefore, the energy of gamma-rays that would have their lifetimes limited by this process is approximately 2.6*1e5 GeV.\n\nAnswer:C)",
