            "The universe is filled with the Cosmic Microwave Background. Consider the annihilation of high energy \\gamma-rays with a photon from the CMB Radiation into electron-positron, i.e. $\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$. From what energy \\gamma-rays would have their lifetimes in the universe limited by this process? Knowing that the average photon energy of the CMB is $10^{-3}eV$.",

        "response": "The pair-production threshold occurs when E_gamma * E_CMB \u2248 (m_e c^2)^2. Here m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV = 5.11\u00d710^5 eV, so (m_e c^2)^2 \u2248 2.61\u00d710^11 eV^2. With E_CMB \u2248 10^-3 eV, the threshold gamma-ray energy is E_gamma \u2248 2.61\u00d710^11 eV^2 / 10^-3 eV = 2.61\u00d710^14 eV = 2.61\u00d710^5 GeV.\n\nAnswer:C)",
