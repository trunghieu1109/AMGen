proposed answer: To determine the energy of gamma-rays that would have their lifetimes limited by annihilation with CMB photons into electron-positron pairs, we consider the threshold energy for the process \( \gamma \gamma \rightarrow e^+ e^- \). The threshold condition is given by the invariant mass of the two photons being at least twice the rest mass energy of the electron (since an electron and a positron are created). The rest mass energy of an electron is \( m_e c^2 = 0.511 \text{ MeV} \). The average energy of CMB photons is \( 10^{-3} \text{ eV} \). In the center-of-mass frame, the energy of each photon must satisfy \( 2 E_{\gamma} E_{\text{CMB}} \geq (2 m_e c^2)^2 \). Solving for \( E_{\gamma} \), we find \( E_{\gamma} \geq \frac{(2 \, 0.511 \, \text{MeV})^2}{2 \, 10^{-3} \, \text{eV}} \approx 2.6 \times 10^5 \text{ GeV} \). Therefore, the energy of gamma-rays that would have their lifetimes limited by this process is approximately 2.6*1e5 GeV.
