Consider the annihilation of high energy \\gamma-rays with a photon from the CMB Radiation into electron-positron, i.e. $\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$. From what energy \\gamma-rays would have their lifetimes in the universe limited by this process? Knowing that the average photon energy of the CMB is $10^{-3}eV$.",

        "response": "To find the threshold energy for gamma-rays that would have their lifetimes limited by the annihilation process with CMB photons, we can use the concept of threshold energy in pair production. The threshold energy for the process \\( \\gamma\\gamma \\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-} \\) occurs when the energy of the gamma-ray photons is enough to create an electron-positron pair. The total energy required for this process is twice the rest mass energy of the electron, which is approximately \\( 2 \times 0.511 \\text{ MeV} \\). The energy of the CMB photon is given as \\( 10^{-3} \\text{ eV} \\). For a gamma-ray photon to interact with a CMB photon to produce an electron-positron pair, we can use the threshold condition: \\( E_{\\gamma} \\approx \\frac{(2m_{e}c^{2})^{2}}{E_{CMB}} \\). We can calculate the threshold energy for the gamma-ray photons based on this relationship and compare it with the provided choices to find the correct one.\n\nAnswer:2.6*1e5 GeV",
