Question: Example(question='The universe is filled with the Cosmic Microwave Background. Consider the annihilation of high energy \\gamma-rays with a photon from the CMB Radiation into electron-positron, i.e. $\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$. From what energy \\gamma-rays would have their lifetimes in the universe limited by this process? Knowing that the average photon energy of the CMB is $10^{-3}eV$.', choice1='9.5*1e4 GeV', choice2='1.8*1e5 GeV', choice3='2.6*1e5 GeV', choice4='3.9*1e5 GeV', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: To find the energy of gamma-rays that would have their lifetimes limited by annihilation with CMB photons, we can use the condition for pair production: the center-of-mass energy must be at least 2 times the rest mass energy of an electron (2 * 0.511 MeV = 1.022 MeV). The energy of a CMB photon is given as 10^-3 eV. In the center-of-mass frame, the energy of the gamma-ray E_γ and the CMB photon ε must satisfy the condition E_γ * ε ≈ (m_e * c^2)^2, where m_e * c^2 = 0.511 MeV. Therefore, E_γ ≈ (0.511 MeV)^2 / (10^-3 eV) = 2.6 * 10^5 GeV.
