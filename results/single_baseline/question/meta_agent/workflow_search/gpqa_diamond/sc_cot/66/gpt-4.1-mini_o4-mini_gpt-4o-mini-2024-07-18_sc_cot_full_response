Question: {'question': 'Consider two electrons are in p orbital angular momentum state. Ignoring there spin angular momentum, the coupled angular momentum state of the 2-electron system is represented by $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1,1, 2, -1>. Here, $l_1, l_2$ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of particles 1 and 2 respectively. And, $l, m$ are the total angular momentum quantum number and the corresponding Z component of the 2-electron system respectively. If measurement is made of the orbital angular momentum components $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, what is the joint probability of getting the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$?\n', 'choice1': '1', 'choice2': '1/2', 'choice3': '0', 'choice4': '2/3'}\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent iMkA', content='We need the joint probability of measuring m1 = –1 and m2 = –1 in the coupled state |l1=1, l2=1; l=2, m=–1>. The probability is |⟨m1, m2|l=2, m=–1⟩|^2. Here m1 + m2 = –2, which does not match the total m = –1, so the Clebsch–Gordan coefficient is zero and hence the probability is zero.\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
