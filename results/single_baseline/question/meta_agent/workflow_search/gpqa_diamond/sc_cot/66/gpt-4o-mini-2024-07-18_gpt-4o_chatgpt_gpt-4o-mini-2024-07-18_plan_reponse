            "Consider two electrons are in p orbital angular momentum state. Ignoring there spin angular momentum, the coupled angular momentum state of the 2-electron system is represented by $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1,1, 2, -1>. Here, $l_1, l_2$ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of particles 1 and 2 respectively. And, $l, m$ are the total angular momentum quantum number and the corresponding Z component of the 2-electron system respectively. If measurement is made of the orbital angular momentum components $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, what is the joint probability of getting the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$?\n",

        "response": "The given state is |l1, l2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>. This is a coupled state of two p orbitals (l1 = 1, l2 = 1) with total angular momentum l = 2 and its z-component m = -1. We want to find the probability of measuring L_{1z} = -\u0127 and L_{2z} = -\u0127 for this state. The uncoupled basis states are |m1, m2> where m1 and m2 are the z-components of the angular momenta of the individual electrons. The state |2, -1> can be expressed in terms of these uncoupled basis states. The state |2, -1> can be written as a linear combination of |m1, m2> states such that m1 + m2 = -1. The possible combinations are: |1, -2>, |0, -1>, |-1, 0>, |-2, 1>. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients determine the probability amplitude for each combination. To get L_{1z} = -\u0127 and L_{2z} = -\u0127, we need m1 = -1 and m2 = -1, which corresponds to the state |-1, -1>. However, |-1, -1> is not a valid combination for the state |2, -1> because -1 + -1 = -2, which does not match m = -1. Therefore, |-1, -1> does not appear in the expansion of |2, -1>, and the probability of measuring L_{1z} = -\u0127 and L_{2z} = -\u0127 is 0.\n\nAnswer:C)",
