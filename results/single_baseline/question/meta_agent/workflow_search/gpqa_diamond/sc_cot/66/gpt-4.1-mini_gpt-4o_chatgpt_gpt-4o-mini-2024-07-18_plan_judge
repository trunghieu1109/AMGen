Question: Example(question='Consider two electrons are in p orbital angular momentum state. Ignoring there spin angular momentum, the coupled angular momentum state of the 2-electron system is represented by $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1,1, 2, -1>. Here, $l_1, l_2$ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of particles 1 and 2 respectively. And, $l, m$ are the total angular momentum quantum number and the corresponding Z component of the 2-electron system respectively. If measurement is made of the orbital angular momentum components $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, what is the joint probability of getting the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$?\n', choice1='1', choice2='1/2', choice3='0', choice4='2/3', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: We have two electrons in a p orbital, so each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number l1 = l2 = 1. The state given is |1, 1, 2, -1>. This is a coupled state where the total angular momentum l = 2 and the z-component m = -1. We want to find the probability of measuring L1z = -ħ and L2z = -ħ. In the uncoupled basis, the possible values for m1 and m2 (the z-components of the individual angular momenta) must satisfy m1 + m2 = m. Here, m = -1, so possible pairs (m1, m2) are (-1, 0), (0, -1), and (-1, -1). The probability amplitude for each pair is given by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The pair (-1, -1) corresponds to both L1z and L2z being -ħ. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for |1, 1, 2, -1> to |1, -1> |1, -1> is 0, because the total m = -1 cannot be formed from both m1 = -1 and m2 = -1 in a state where l = 2. Therefore, the probability is the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, which is 0.
