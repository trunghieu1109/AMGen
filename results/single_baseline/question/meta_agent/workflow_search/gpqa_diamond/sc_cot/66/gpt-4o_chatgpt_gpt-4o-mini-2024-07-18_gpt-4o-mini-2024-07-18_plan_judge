Question: Example(question='Consider two electrons are in p orbital angular momentum state. Ignoring there spin angular momentum, the coupled angular momentum state of the 2-electron system is represented by $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1,1, 2, -1>. Here, $l_1, l_2$ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of particles 1 and 2 respectively. And, $l, m$ are the total angular momentum quantum number and the corresponding Z component of the 2-electron system respectively. If measurement is made of the orbital angular momentum components $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, what is the joint probability of getting the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$?\n', choice1='1', choice2='1/2', choice3='0', choice4='2/3', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: In the given state |1,1,2,-1>, the quantum numbers indicate that both electrons are in the p orbital (l=1). The possible eigenvalues for L_{1z} and L_{2z} for each electron in the p orbital are m = -1, 0, and +1 (where m is the magnetic quantum number). For both electrons to have L_{1z} = -ℏ and L_{2z} = -ℏ, each electron must be in the state corresponding to m = -1. The joint probability of obtaining these eigenvalues can be calculated based on the coefficients of the state |1,1,2,-1>. Since the total m value is -1, and both electrons have m = -1, the probability of measuring both L_{1z} and L_{2z} as -ℏ is non-zero. The possible configurations for m values are limited, and the derived probabilities indicate that the outcome is feasible. After consideration of the allowed configurations and the normalization of states, the joint probability of obtaining both L_{1z} and L_{2z} as -ℏ is 1/2.
