Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent SQWH', content='The given state is |l1, l2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>. This is a coupled state of two p orbitals (l1 = 1, l2 = 1) with total angular momentum l = 2 and its z-component m = -1. We want to find the probability of measuring L_{1z} = -ħ and L_{2z} = -ħ for this state. The uncoupled basis states are |m1, m2> where m1 and m2 are the z-components of the angular momenta of the individual electrons. The state |2, -1> can be expressed in terms of these uncoupled basis states. The state |2, -1> can be written as a linear combination of |m1, m2> states such that m1 + m2 = -1. The possible combinations are: |1, -2>, |0, -1>, |-1, 0>, |-2, 1>. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients determine the probability amplitude for each combination. To get L_{1z} = -ħ and L_{2z} = -ħ, we need m1 = -1 and m2 = -1, which corresponds to the state |-1, -1>. However, |-1, -1> is not a valid combination for the state |2, -1> because -1 + -1 = -2, which does not match m = -1. Therefore, |-1, -1> does not appear in the expansion of |2, -1>, and the probability of measuring L_{1z} = -ħ and L_{2z} = -ħ is 0.\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
