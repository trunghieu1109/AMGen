Question: Example(question='Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are\nconstrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system\ncorrect to three decimals?', choice1='2.822 x 10^-26', choice2='5.645 x 10^-26', choice3='7.056 x 10^-27', choice4='122.330', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To find the minimum energy of the system, we need to calculate the potential energy due to the electrostatic interactions between the charges. Each of the 12 charges is located 2 m from the fixed charge at point P. The potential energy U between two point charges is given by the formula U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant (approximately 8.99 x 10^9 N m²/C²), q1 and q2 are the charges, and r is the distance between them. Here, each charge is 2e, where e is the elementary charge (approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 C). Therefore, q1 = q2 = 2 * 1.602 x 10^-19 C = 3.204 x 10^-19 C. The distance r is 2 m. We calculate the potential energy for one charge interacting with the fixed charge, and then consider the interactions among the 12 charges themselves. The total energy is the sum of these potential energies. After calculating the total energy, we compare it with the provided choices to find the closest match.
