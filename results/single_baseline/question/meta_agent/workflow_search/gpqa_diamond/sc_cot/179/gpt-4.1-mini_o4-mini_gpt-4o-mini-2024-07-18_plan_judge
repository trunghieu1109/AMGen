Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: We have 13 charges of q=2e; one at the center and 12 on a sphere of radius R=2 m. The minimal configuration of 12 on a sphere is the vertices of a regular icosahedron. The total electrostatic energy U is the sum of the 12 center–surface interactions plus the 66 surface–surface interactions.

1) Center–surface: 12 pairs at distance R give U_c = 12·kq²/R = 12·(8.988×10⁹)(4e²)/2.  With e=1.602×10⁻¹⁹ C, q²=4e²=1.026×10⁻³⁷ C², so kq²=9.226×10⁻²⁸ J·m.  Thus U_c=12·9.226×10⁻²⁸/2=5.536×10⁻²⁷ J.

2) Surface–surface: 12 points at icosahedron vertices have 66 pairs: 30 edges at distance a, 30 at ξ, and 6 diametrical at 2R.  From the standard icosahedron model we find a=2.103 m, ξ=3.402 m.  Hence U_s = kq²[30/a + 30/ξ + 6/(2R)] = 9.226×10⁻²⁸[30/2.103 + 30/3.402 + 6/4] ≃ 2.269×10⁻²⁶ J.

Adding: U=U_c+U_s ≃0.5536×10⁻²⁶+2.269×10⁻²⁶=2.823×10⁻²⁶ J.  To three decimals this is 2.822×10⁻²⁶ J.
