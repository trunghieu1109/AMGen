Question: Example(question='Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are\nconstrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system\ncorrect to three decimals?', choice1='2.822 x 10^-26', choice2='5.645 x 10^-26', choice3='7.056 x 10^-27', choice4='122.330', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To find the minimum energy of the system, we need to calculate the potential energy due to the electrostatic interactions between the charges. We have 12 charges, each with charge 2e, placed at a distance of 2 m from a central charge, also 2e, at point P. The potential energy between two point charges is given by U = k * q1 * q2 / r, where k is Coulomb's constant (approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N m²/C²), q1 and q2 are the charges, and r is the distance between them. Since all 12 charges are at the same distance from the central charge, we calculate the potential energy for one pair and then multiply by 12. Each charge is 2e, so q1 = q2 = 2e, where e is the elementary charge (approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 C). The distance r is 2 m. Thus, the potential energy for one pair is U_single = k * (2e) * (2e) / 2 = k * 4e² / 2 = 2k * e². For 12 pairs, the total energy is U_total = 12 * 2k * e². Substituting the values, we get U_total = 12 * 2 * 8.988 x 10^9 N m²/C² * (1.602 x 10^-19 C)². Calculating this gives the minimum energy of the system.
