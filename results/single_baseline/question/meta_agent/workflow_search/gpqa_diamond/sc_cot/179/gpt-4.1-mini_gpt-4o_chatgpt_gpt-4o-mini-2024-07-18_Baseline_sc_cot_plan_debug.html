    <pre>To find the minimum energy of the system, we need to calculate the electrostatic potential energy. The 13th charge is fixed at point P, and the other 12 charges are at a distance of 2 m from P. Each particle has charge 2e, where e is the elementary charge (approximately 1.6 x 10^-19 C). The electrostatic potential energy U for two point charges q1 and q2 separated by a distance r is given by U = k * q1 * q2 / r, where k is Coulomb&#39;s constant (approximately 8.99 x 10^9 N m^2/C^2). Here, each of the 12 charges interacts with the fixed charge at P. The potential energy for one pair is U_pair = k * (2e) * (2e) / 2. Therefore, U_pair = (8.99 x 10^9) * (4 * (1.6 x 10^-19)^2) / 2. The total potential energy is 12 times U_pair, since there are 12 charges interacting with the fixed charge. Calculating this gives the total energy.
