Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent ftxz', content='First, we need to calculate the moles of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. For KH2PO4, the moles are 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.00735 mol. For Na2HPO4·2H2O, the moles are 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.00562 mol. In solution, KH2PO4 will dissociate to H2PO4^- and H+, while Na2HPO4·2H2O will dissociate to HPO4^2- and Na+. The concentration of H2PO4^- is 0.00735 mol / 0.200 L = 0.03675 M, and the concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.00562 mol / 0.200 L = 0.0281 M. The equilibrium between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- is governed by the second dissociation constant, Ka2 = 6.2x10^-8. At equilibrium, [H2PO4^-] = 0.03675 - x, [HPO4^2-] = 0.0281 + x, and [H+] = x. Solving for x, we find x = 6.24x10^-7 M, which is the concentration of orthophosphate ions, PO4^3-, formed from the dissociation of HPO4^2-.\n\nAnswer:B)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
