Question: Example(question='We have a solution which has the volume of 200.00 cm3 and contains 1.00 g KH2PO4 (Mw = 136.09 g/mol) and 1.00 g Na2HPO4●2H2O (Mw = 177.99 g/mol) (T = 25 °C). What is the concentration of orthophosphate ions in this solution? The Ka1, Ka2 and Ka3 values for H3PO4 are 7.5x10^-3, 6.2x10^-8 and 1.8x10^-12, respectively.', choice1='5.48x10^-7 M ', choice2='6.24x10^-7 M', choice3='2.81x10^-7 M', choice4='3.97x10^-7 M ', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: First, calculate the moles of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4●2H2O. For KH2PO4: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.00735 mol. For Na2HPO4●2H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.00562 mol. The total moles of phosphate ions from both salts are 0.00735 mol + 0.00562 mol = 0.01297 mol. Since the volume of the solution is 200.00 cm3 = 0.200 L, the concentration of phosphate ions is 0.01297 mol / 0.200 L = 0.06485 M. However, we need to consider the equilibrium of the phosphate system. The dominant species at this pH will likely be HPO4^2- and PO4^3-. Using the given Ka values, we can determine the distribution of phosphate species. Given that the solution is a buffer, the concentration of PO4^3- can be calculated considering the equilibrium between HPO4^2- and PO4^3-. The concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) will be a small fraction of the total phosphate concentration due to the low Ka3 value. After calculating, the concentration of orthophosphate ions is approximately 6.24x10^-7 M.
