        "response": "First, calculate the moles of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4\u25cf2H2O. For KH2PO4: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.00735 mol. For Na2HPO4\u25cf2H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.00562 mol. The total moles of phosphate ions from both salts are 0.00735 mol + 0.00562 mol = 0.01297 mol. Since the volume of the solution is 200.00 cm3 = 0.200 L, the concentration of phosphate ions is 0.01297 mol / 0.200 L = 0.06485 M. However, we need to consider the equilibrium of the phosphate system. The dominant species at this pH will likely be HPO4^2- and PO4^3-. Using the given Ka values, we can determine the distribution of phosphate species. Given that the solution is a buffer, the concentration of PO4^3- can be calculated considering the equilibrium between HPO4^2- and PO4^3-. The concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) will be a small fraction of the total phosphate concentration due to the low Ka3 value. After calculating, the concentration of orthophosphate ions is approximately 6.24x10^-7 M.\n\nAnswer:B)",
