            "We have a solution which has the volume of 200.00 cm3 and contains 1.00 g KH2PO4 (Mw = 136.09 g/mol) and 1.00 g Na2HPO4\u25cf2H2O (Mw = 177.99 g/mol) (T = 25 \u00b0C). What is the concentration of orthophosphate ions in this solution? The Ka1, Ka2 and Ka3 values for H3PO4 are 7.5x10^-3, 6.2x10^-8 and 1.8x10^-12, respectively.",

        "response": "To find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) in the solution, we need to consider the dissociation of the phosphate compounds in solution. KH2PO4 dissociates to give H2PO4^- ions, and Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O dissociates to give HPO4^2- ions. The total concentration of orthophosphate ions will be a result of the contributions from these dissociations. We will convert the mass of each compound to moles and then calculate the concentrations based on the total volume of the solution. The relevant dissociation equations and equilibrium constants will help us determine the final concentrations of the orthophosphate ions. After calculating and considering the equilibrium, we will compare the results to the provided choices.\n\nAnswer:5.48x10^-7 M",
