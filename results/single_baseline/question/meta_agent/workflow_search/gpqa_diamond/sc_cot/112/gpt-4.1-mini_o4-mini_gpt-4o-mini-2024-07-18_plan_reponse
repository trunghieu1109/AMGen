            "You have prepared an unknown compound. To identify the product, you have used the following characterisation techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers. Two other strong absorption peaks are observed at 1700 and 1650 wavenumbers. Several peaks were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum including peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens. The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45. Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O2.",

        "response": "The broad IR absorption at ~3000 cm\u207b\u00b9 indicates an O\u2013H stretch (likely carboxylic acid), the strong peak at 1700 cm\u207b\u00b9 is a C=O stretch, and the 1650 cm\u207b\u00b9 band is a C=C stretch. \u00b9H NMR shows vinyl hydrogens (from an alkene), and the m/z = 45 fragment in the mass spectrum corresponds to the acylium ion [CH\u2083CO]\u207a or COOH\u207a typical of carboxylic acids. This points to a monocarboxylic acid with one C=C and one C=O, matching C\u2086H\u2081\u2080O\u2082.\n\nAnswer:A)",
