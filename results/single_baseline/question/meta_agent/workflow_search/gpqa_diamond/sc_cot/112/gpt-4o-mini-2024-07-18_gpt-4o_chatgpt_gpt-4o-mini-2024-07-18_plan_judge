Question: Example(question='You have prepared an unknown compound. To identify the product, you have used the following characterisation techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers. Two other strong absorption peaks are observed at 1700 and 1650 wavenumbers. Several peaks were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum including peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens. The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45. Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O2.', choice1='C6H10O2', choice2='C6H12O', choice3='C6H10O', choice4='C6H12O2', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The FTIR spectrum shows a broad absorption peak at 3000 cm^-1, which is characteristic of an -OH group, suggesting the presence of an alcohol or carboxylic acid. The strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1 indicate the presence of carbonyl groups (C=O), possibly in a conjugated system. The 1H NMR spectrum shows vinyl hydrogens, suggesting the presence of a double bond. The mass spectrometry fragment at m/z = 45 could correspond to a common fragment such as CH3CO+ (acetyl group). Considering these observations, the compound likely has an -OH group, a carbonyl group, and a double bond, which fits the formula C6H10O2.
