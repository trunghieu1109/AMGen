Question: {'question': 'You have prepared an unknown compound. To identify the product, you have used the following characterisation techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers. Two other strong absorption peaks are observed at 1700 and 1650 wavenumbers. Several peaks were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum including peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens. The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45. Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O2.', 'choice1': 'C6H10O2', 'choice2': 'C6H12O', 'choice3': 'C6H10O', 'choice4': 'C6H12O2'}\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 0dkF', content='The broad IR absorption at ~3000 cm⁻¹ indicates an O–H stretch (likely carboxylic acid), the strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is a C=O stretch, and the 1650 cm⁻¹ band is a C=C stretch. ¹H NMR shows vinyl hydrogens (from an alkene), and the m/z = 45 fragment in the mass spectrum corresponds to the acylium ion [CH₃CO]⁺ or COOH⁺ typical of carboxylic acids. This points to a monocarboxylic acid with one C=C and one C=O, matching C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\nAnswer:A)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
