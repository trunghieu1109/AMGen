Question: Example(question='You have prepared an unknown compound. To identify the product, you have used the following characterisation techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers. Two other strong absorption peaks are observed at 1700 and 1650 wavenumbers. Several peaks were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum including peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens. The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45. Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O2.', choice1='C6H10O2', choice2='C6H12O', choice3='C6H10O', choice4='C6H12O2', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The FTIR spectrum shows a broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers, which suggests the presence of an O-H group, indicating an alcohol or carboxylic acid. The strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 wavenumbers suggest the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and possibly a conjugated system. The 1H NMR spectrum shows peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens, indicating the presence of an alkene. The mass spectrum fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a common fragment for an acetyl group (CH3CO). Considering all these observations, the compound likely contains both an alkene and a carbonyl group, and possibly an alcohol or carboxylic acid group. The formula C6H10O2 fits these observations as it could represent a compound with a carbonyl group and an alcohol, forming an enol or a conjugated ketone or aldehyde. The other formulas do not fit as well with the presence of both an alkene and a carbonyl group with an O-H stretch.
