Question: Example(question='A compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO and the given NMR data is reacted with the following set of reagents:\n\n1. NaNO2 + HCl\n2. H2O\n3. aq. KOH, Heat \n\n1H-NMR (ppm): 9.72 (t, 1H), 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H), 6.27 (bs, 2H), 3.66 (d, 2H). Identify the final product.', choice1='4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal', choice2='3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal', choice3='2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal', choice4='2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The starting compound is p-aminophenylacetaldehyde (C8H9NO). 1H NMR shows an aldehyde (9.72 ppm, t, CHO coupling with CH2), CH2 doublet at 3.66 ppm, aromatic 1,4-disubstituted pattern (two doublets at 6.98 and 6.51 ppm), and NH2 (bs at 6.27 ppm). 1) Diazonium formation (NaNO2/HCl) then H2O replaces NH2 with OH, giving p-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. 2) Heating with aqueous KOH induces self-aldol condensation: deprotonation of CH2, attack on another aldehyde, then dehydration yields the α,β-unsaturated aldehyde with aryl substituents at C2 and C4 of a but-2-enal framework. This corresponds to 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal, choice 3.
