        "response": "The starting compound is p-aminophenylacetaldehyde (C8H9NO). 1H NMR shows an aldehyde (9.72 ppm, t, CHO coupling with CH2), CH2 doublet at 3.66 ppm, aromatic 1,4-disubstituted pattern (two doublets at 6.98 and 6.51 ppm), and NH2 (bs at 6.27 ppm). 1) Diazonium formation (NaNO2/HCl) then H2O replaces NH2 with OH, giving p-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. 2) Heating with aqueous KOH induces self-aldol condensation: deprotonation of CH2, attack on another aldehyde, then dehydration yields the \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated aldehyde with aryl substituents at C2 and C4 of a but-2-enal framework. This corresponds to 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal, choice 3.\n\nAnswer:C)",
