        "response": "The sequence is a Corey\u2013Seebach alkylation followed by a Wittig reaction. Propionaldehyde is protected as a dithiane (A), lithiated and alkylated to give a symmetric ketone D = CH3CH2COCH2CH3 (3-pentanone). Reaction with Ph3P and 3-bromopentane gives the ylide Ph3P= C(Et)2, which Wittig-reacts with the ketone to yield the fully symmetrical tetrasubstituted alkene E = (Et)2C=C(Et)2. By symmetry all eight ethyl carbons collapse into two types (CH2 and CH3), plus the equivalent sp2 carbons. Thus there are 3 distinct 13C signals.\n\nAnswer:A)",
