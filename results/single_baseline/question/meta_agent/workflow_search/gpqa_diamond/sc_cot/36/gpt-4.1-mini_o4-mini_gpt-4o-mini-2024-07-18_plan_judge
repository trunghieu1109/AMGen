Question: Example(question='Identify the number of 13C-NMR signals produced by the final product, denoted as E, resulting from the series of reactions shown below.\nPropionaldehyde + EDT / BF3 ---> A\nA + BuLi ---> B\nB + Bromoethane ---> C\nC + HgCl2 / H2O / H+ ---> D\nD + PPh3 / 3-bromopentane / BuLi ---> E', choice1='3', choice2='11', choice3='8', choice4='6', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The sequence is a Coreyâ€“Seebach alkylation followed by a Wittig reaction. Propionaldehyde is protected as a dithiane (A), lithiated and alkylated to give a symmetric ketone D = CH3CH2COCH2CH3 (3-pentanone). Reaction with Ph3P and 3-bromopentane gives the ylide Ph3P= C(Et)2, which Wittig-reacts with the ketone to yield the fully symmetrical tetrasubstituted alkene E = (Et)2C=C(Et)2. By symmetry all eight ethyl carbons collapse into two types (CH2 and CH3), plus the equivalent sp2 carbons. Thus there are 3 distinct 13C signals.
