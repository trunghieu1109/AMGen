Question: Example(question='3,3,6-trimethylhepta-1,5-dien-4-one is treated with 1 equivalent of meta-chloroperbenzoic acid. Two different products are formed, in approximately a 1:1 ratio.\n\nIn a separate vessel, Methyllithium is treated with copper(I)iodide. an excess of the resulting solution is slowly added to the product mixture of the first reaction. Name one product that will be formed by this reaction:', choice1='4,4,5,7,7-pentamethyloctane-3,5-diol', choice2='2,3,4,5,5-pentamethylhept-6-ene-2,4-diol', choice3='5-hydroxy-3,3,6,6-tetramethylhept-1-en-4-one', choice4='6-hydroxy-2,2,5,5-tetramethyloctan-4-one', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The reaction involves treating 3,3,6-trimethylhepta-1,5-dien-4-one with meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which typically leads to epoxidation. The product mixture will contain epoxides. When Methyllithium is treated with copper(I) iodide, it forms a Gilman reagent, which can react with the epoxides to open them and form alcohols. Given the options, I need to identify which product corresponds to the expected reaction with the epoxide formed from the original compound.

Answer:5-hydroxy-3,3,6,6-tetramethylhept-1-en-4-one
Extracted answer: 5-hydroxy-3,3,6,6-tetramethylhept-1-en-4-one
Correct answer: 4
