Question: Example(question='3,3,6-trimethylhepta-1,5-dien-4-one is treated with 1 equivalent of meta-chloroperbenzoic acid. Two different products are formed, in approximately a 1:1 ratio.\n\nIn a separate vessel, Methyllithium is treated with copper(I)iodide. an excess of the resulting solution is slowly added to the product mixture of the first reaction. Name one product that will be formed by this reaction:', choice1='4,4,5,7,7-pentamethyloctane-3,5-diol', choice2='2,3,4,5,5-pentamethylhept-6-ene-2,4-diol', choice3='5-hydroxy-3,3,6,6-tetramethylhept-1-en-4-one', choice4='6-hydroxy-2,2,5,5-tetramethyloctan-4-one', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: First, MCPBA epoxidizes each isolated alkene in 3,3,6-trimethylhepta-1,5-dien-4-one to give two monoepoxides (at C1–C2 or C5–C6). Treatment with MeLi/CuI (a soft nucleophile) opens the epoxide at the more substituted carbon. For the C5–C6 epoxide, attack occurs at C6 (secondary) rather than C5 (primary), installing a Me at C6 and leaving an OH at C5. The remaining C1–C2 alkene and the C4 ketone are untouched.  This product is 5-hydroxy-3,3,6,6-tetramethylhept-1-en-4-one, matching choice 3.
