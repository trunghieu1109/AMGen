    <pre>First, MCPBA epoxidizes each isolated alkene in 3,3,6-trimethylhepta-1,5-dien-4-one to give two monoepoxides (at C1–C2 or C5–C6). Treatment with MeLi/CuI (a soft nucleophile) opens the epoxide at the more substituted carbon. For the C5–C6 epoxide, attack occurs at C6 (secondary) rather than C5 (primary), installing a Me at C6 and leaving an OH at C5. The remaining C1–C2 alkene and the C4 ketone are untouched.  This product is 5-hydroxy-3,3,6,6-tetramethylhept-1-en-4-one, matching choice 3.
