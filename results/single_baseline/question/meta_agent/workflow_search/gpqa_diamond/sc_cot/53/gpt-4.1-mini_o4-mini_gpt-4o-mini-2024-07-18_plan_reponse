        "response": "To form 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene by RCM, we need an octadiene with terminal alkenes at C1\u2013C2 and C7\u2013C8 so that closing between C2 and C7 gives a cyclohexene (6-membered) with its double bond at the ring. Mapping substituents: the resultant ring carbons C3 and C4 (of cyclohexene) must be methyl-substituted, and C5 must bear the isopropyl. Back-mapping onto the linear chain (numbered from the first alkene), this places an isopropyl at C4 and methyls at C5 and C6. That corresponds to 4-isopropyl-5,6-dimethylocta-1,7-diene.\n\nAnswer:D)",
