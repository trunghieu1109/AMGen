Question: Example(question='Determine the starting material needed to synthesize 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene via ring-closing metathesis.', choice1='5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene', choice2='5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene', choice3='5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene', choice4='4-isopropyl-5,6-dimethylocta-1,7-diene', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To form 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene by RCM, we need an octadiene with terminal alkenes at C1–C2 and C7–C8 so that closing between C2 and C7 gives a cyclohexene (6-membered) with its double bond at the ring. Mapping substituents: the resultant ring carbons C3 and C4 (of cyclohexene) must be methyl-substituted, and C5 must bear the isopropyl. Back-mapping onto the linear chain (numbered from the first alkene), this places an isopropyl at C4 and methyls at C5 and C6. That corresponds to 4-isopropyl-5,6-dimethylocta-1,7-diene.
