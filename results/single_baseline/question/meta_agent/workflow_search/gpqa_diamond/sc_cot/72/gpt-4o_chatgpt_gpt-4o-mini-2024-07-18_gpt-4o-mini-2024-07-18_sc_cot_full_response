Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent e15k', content='To find the relative speed of the two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, we can use the relativistic velocity addition formula: v_rel = (v1 + v2) / (1 + (v1 * v2 / c^2)). Here, v1 = 0.6c and v2 = 0.5c. Plugging these values into the formula will give us the relative speed. After calculating the relative speed, we can find the total energy of the system using the relativistic energy formula E = mc^2 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)) for each astronaut and summing them up. The total mass-energy of the system will be calculated based on their respective relativistic speeds and masses.\n\nAnswer:v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
