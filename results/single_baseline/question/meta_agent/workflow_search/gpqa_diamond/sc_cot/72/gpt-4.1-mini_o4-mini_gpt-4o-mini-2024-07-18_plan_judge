Question: Example(question='Two astronauts of masses 2m and 3m travel at relativistic speeds of 0.6 c and 0.5 c, respectively, in the positive x-direction. Here, c is the speed of light. What will be the relative speed and the total energy of the system?', choice1='v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2', choice2='v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2', choice3='v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2', choice4='v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: We have two astronauts with masses m1=2m, m2=3m traveling at speeds v1=0.6c and v2=0.5c in the same direction. The relative speed v_rel of astronaut 1 as seen by astronaut 2 is given by (v1−v2)/(1−(v1 v2)/c^2) = (0.6c−0.5c)/(1−0.6·0.5) = 0.1c/0.7 = 0.142857c ≈ 0.14c. The total energy in the lab frame is E_total = γ1 m1 c^2 + γ2 m2 c^2 where γ1 = 1/√(1−0.6^2)=1.25 and γ2 = 1/√(1−0.5^2)=1.1547. Thus E1=1.25·2m c^2=2.5m c^2, E2=1.1547·3m c^2≈3.4641m c^2, giving E_total≈5.9641m c^2 ≈5.96m c^2. This matches choice1.
