        "response": "We have two astronauts with masses m1=2m, m2=3m traveling at speeds v1=0.6c and v2=0.5c in the same direction. The relative speed v_rel of astronaut 1 as seen by astronaut 2 is given by (v1\u2212v2)/(1\u2212(v1 v2)/c^2) = (0.6c\u22120.5c)/(1\u22120.6\u00b70.5) = 0.1c/0.7 = 0.142857c \u2248 0.14c. The total energy in the lab frame is E_total = \u03b31 m1 c^2 + \u03b32 m2 c^2 where \u03b31 = 1/\u221a(1\u22120.6^2)=1.25 and \u03b32 = 1/\u221a(1\u22120.5^2)=1.1547. Thus E1=1.25\u00b72m c^2=2.5m c^2, E2=1.1547\u00b73m c^2\u22483.4641m c^2, giving E_total\u22485.9641m c^2 \u22485.96m c^2. This matches choice1.\n\nAnswer:A)",
