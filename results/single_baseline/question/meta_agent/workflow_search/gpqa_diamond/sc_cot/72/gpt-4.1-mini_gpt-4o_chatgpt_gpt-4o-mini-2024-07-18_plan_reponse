        "response": "To find the relative speed of two objects moving at relativistic speeds, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula: v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - v1*v2/c^2), where v1 = 0.6c and v2 = 0.5c. Plug these values into the formula to get v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6*0.5)) = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3) = 0.1c / 0.7 = 0.142857c, approximately 0.14c. Next, to calculate the total energy of the system, we use the relativistic energy formula E = gamma * m * c^2, where gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2). For the astronaut with mass 2m and speed 0.6c, gamma_1 = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1.25, so E1 = 1.25 * 2m * c^2 = 2.5mc^2. For the astronaut with mass 3m and speed 0.5c, gamma_2 = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1.1547, so E2 = 1.1547 * 3m * c^2 = 3.4641mc^2. The total energy E = E1 + E2 = 2.5mc^2 + 3.4641mc^2 = 5.9641mc^2, approximately 5.96mc^2.\n\nAnswer:A)",
