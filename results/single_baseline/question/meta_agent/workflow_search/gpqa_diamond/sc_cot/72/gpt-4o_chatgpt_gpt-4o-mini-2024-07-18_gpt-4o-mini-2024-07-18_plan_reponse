            "Two astronauts of masses 2m and 3m travel at relativistic speeds of 0.6 c and 0.5 c, respectively, in the positive x-direction. Here, c is the speed of light. What will be the relative speed and the total energy of the system?",

        "correct_answer": 1,
        "n": "Baseline sc_cot",
        "response": "To find the relative speed of the two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, we can use the relativistic velocity addition formula: v_rel = (v1 + v2) / (1 + (v1 * v2 / c^2)). Here, v1 = 0.6c and v2 = 0.5c. Plugging these values into the formula will give us the relative speed. After calculating the relative speed, we can find the total energy of the system using the relativistic energy formula E = mc^2 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)) for each astronaut and summing them up. The total mass-energy of the system will be calculated based on their respective relativistic speeds and masses.\n\nAnswer:v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2",
