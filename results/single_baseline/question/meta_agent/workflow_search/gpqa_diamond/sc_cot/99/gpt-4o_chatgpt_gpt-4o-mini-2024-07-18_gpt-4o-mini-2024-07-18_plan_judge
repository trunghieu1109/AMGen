Question: Example(question='Compound A (C3H6) undergoes bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride to form compound B. When compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH, it forms compound C. Passing compound C through a red-hot iron tube produces compound D. Compound D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form compound E. Compound E, in the presence of iron scrap and hydrochloric acid, forms compound F. Compound F reacts with nitrous acid to form G. When G reacts with sodium hydroxide, it forms H. Identify the incorrect statement about the products obtained in this reaction sequence.', choice1='D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.', choice2='F is used for the synthesis of dyes.', choice3='H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.', choice4='C is a flammable gas.', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To identify the incorrect statement about the products obtained in the reaction sequence, we need to analyze each choice based on the properties of the compounds involved. Compound D is typically a stable compound that may show characteristic NMR signals. Compound F is often a precursor in dye synthesis. Compound H's reaction with ferric chloride is a common test for phenols, which would give a color change. Compound C being a flammable gas must be verified. Each statement needs to be evaluated for its correctness based on organic chemistry knowledge.
