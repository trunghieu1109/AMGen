            "Compound A (C3H6) undergoes bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride to form compound B. When compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH, it forms compound C. Passing compound C through a red-hot iron tube produces compound D. Compound D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form compound E. Compound E, in the presence of iron scrap and hydrochloric acid, forms compound F. Compound F reacts with nitrous acid to form G. When G reacts with sodium hydroxide, it forms H. Identify the incorrect statement about the products obtained in this reaction sequence.",
            "D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.",
            "F is used for the synthesis of dyes.",
            "H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.",

        "response": "We start with A = propene (C3H6). Bromination gives 1,2-dibromopropane (B). Alcoholic KOH on B yields alkyne C = propyne (C3H4). Passing C through a red-hot iron tube causes trimerization to benzene (D). Nitration of benzene with mixed acids gives nitrobenzene (E). Reduction with Fe/HCl gives aniline (F). Diazotization of F gives diazonium G. Hydrolysis of G with NaOH yields phenol (H). Now check statements: 1) D = benzene gives one singlet in 1H NMR, not two \u2013 false. 2) F = aniline is used in dye synthesis \u2013 true. 3) H = phenol gives yellow color with FeCl3 \u2013 true. 4) C = propyne is a flammable gas \u2013 true. Thus the incorrect statement is choice A).\n\nAnswer:A)",
