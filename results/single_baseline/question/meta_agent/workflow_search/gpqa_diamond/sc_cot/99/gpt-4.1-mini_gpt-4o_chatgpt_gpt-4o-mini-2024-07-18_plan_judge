Question: Example(question='Compound A (C3H6) undergoes bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride to form compound B. When compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH, it forms compound C. Passing compound C through a red-hot iron tube produces compound D. Compound D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form compound E. Compound E, in the presence of iron scrap and hydrochloric acid, forms compound F. Compound F reacts with nitrous acid to form G. When G reacts with sodium hydroxide, it forms H. Identify the incorrect statement about the products obtained in this reaction sequence.', choice1='D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.', choice2='F is used for the synthesis of dyes.', choice3='H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.', choice4='C is a flammable gas.', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: Let's analyze the reaction sequence step by step. Compound A is propene (C3H6). Bromination of propene in the presence of CCl4 gives 1,2-dibromopropane (compound B). Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH to undergo dehydrohalogenation, forming propene (compound C). Passing propene through a red-hot iron tube leads to cyclization, forming benzene (compound D). Benzene reacts with a mixture of two strong acids (HNO3 and H2SO4) to form nitrobenzene (compound E). Nitrobenzene, in the presence of iron scrap and HCl, is reduced to aniline (compound F). Aniline reacts with nitrous acid to form a diazonium salt (compound G), which reacts with NaOH to form phenol (compound H). Now, let's evaluate the statements: D is benzene, which gives one singlet in the 1H NMR spectra, not two, so statement 1 is incorrect. F is aniline, which is used in dye synthesis, so statement 2 is correct. H is phenol, which gives a violet color with ferric chloride, not yellow, so statement 3 is incorrect. C is propene, a flammable gas, so statement 4 is correct.
