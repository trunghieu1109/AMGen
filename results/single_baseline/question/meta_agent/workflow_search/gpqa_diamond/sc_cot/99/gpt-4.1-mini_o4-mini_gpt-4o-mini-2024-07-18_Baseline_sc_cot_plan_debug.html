    <pre>We start with A = propene (C3H6). Bromination gives 1,2-dibromopropane (B). Alcoholic KOH on B yields alkyne C = propyne (C3H4). Passing C through a red-hot iron tube causes trimerization to benzene (D). Nitration of benzene with mixed acids gives nitrobenzene (E). Reduction with Fe/HCl gives aniline (F). Diazotization of F gives diazonium G. Hydrolysis of G with NaOH yields phenol (H). Now check statements: 1) D = benzene gives one singlet in 1H NMR, not two – false. 2) F = aniline is used in dye synthesis – true. 3) H = phenol gives yellow color with FeCl3 – true. 4) C = propyne is a flammable gas – true. Thus the incorrect statement is choice A).
