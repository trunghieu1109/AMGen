Question: Example(question='What is the major outcome of the reaction between 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol and bromine?', choice1='2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone', choice2='(1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol', choice3='(1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol', choice4='4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The substrate is an enol (4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol). Reaction with Br₂ under typical conditions adds bromine across the C=C to give an anti 1,2-dibromoalcohol (vicinal dibromide), whereas tautomerization then α-bromination to give a bromoketone would require acidic enol bromination conditions. Here, simple bromine addition to the alkene predominates, yielding 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol with anti stereochemistry. This gives a racemic mixture of (1R,2R) and (1S,2S) products; the meso (1R,2S) is not formed. Thus the major identifiable product is the (1R,2R) stereoisomer listed in choice B).
