Question: Example(question='What is the major outcome of the reaction between 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol and bromine?', choice1='2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone', choice2='(1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol', choice3='(1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol', choice4='4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The reaction between 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol and bromine typically involves the addition of bromine across the double bond present in the enol. This reaction can lead to the formation of dibrominated products. The major outcome would be the dibromination of the double bond, which would likely lead to the formation of a dibromo alcohol. The specific stereochemistry of the product will depend on the conditions of the reaction. Among the provided choices, the dibromo alcohols are the most likely major products, and I need to analyze them to find the most plausible one.
