Question: Example(question='What is the major outcome of the reaction between 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol and bromine?', choice1='2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone', choice2='(1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol', choice3='(1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol', choice4='4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The reaction of an alkene with bromine typically leads to a bromination across the double bond, resulting in a vicinal dibromide. The compound in question, 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol, has a double bond in the cyclopentene ring. When bromine is added to the double bond, it will form a dibromide. The stereochemistry of the addition is typically anti, resulting in a trans product. Therefore, the major product should be a dibromide with trans stereochemistry at the addition sites.
