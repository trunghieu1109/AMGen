        "response": "The substrate is an enol (4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol). Reaction with Br\u2082 under typical conditions adds bromine across the C=C to give an anti 1,2-dibromoalcohol (vicinal dibromide), whereas tautomerization then \u03b1-bromination to give a bromoketone would require acidic enol bromination conditions. Here, simple bromine addition to the alkene predominates, yielding 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol with anti stereochemistry. This gives a racemic mixture of (1R,2R) and (1S,2S) products; the meso (1R,2S) is not formed. Thus the major identifiable product is the (1R,2R) stereoisomer listed in choice B).\n\nAnswer:B)",
