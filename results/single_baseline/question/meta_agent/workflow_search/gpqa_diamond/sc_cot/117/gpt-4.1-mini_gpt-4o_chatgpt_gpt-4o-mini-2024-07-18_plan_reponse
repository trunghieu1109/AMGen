        "n": "Baseline sc_cot",
        "response": "The reaction of an alkene with bromine typically leads to a bromination across the double bond, resulting in a vicinal dibromide. The compound in question, 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol, has a double bond in the cyclopentene ring. When bromine is added to the double bond, it will form a dibromide. The stereochemistry of the addition is typically anti, resulting in a trans product. Therefore, the major product should be a dibromide with trans stereochemistry at the addition sites.\n\nAnswer:C)",
