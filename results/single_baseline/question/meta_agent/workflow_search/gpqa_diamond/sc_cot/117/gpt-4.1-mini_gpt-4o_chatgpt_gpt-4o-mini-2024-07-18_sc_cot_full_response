Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent nFFY', content='The reaction of an alkene with bromine typically leads to a bromination across the double bond, resulting in a vicinal dibromide. The compound in question, 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol, has a double bond in the cyclopentene ring. When bromine is added to the double bond, it will form a dibromide. The stereochemistry of the addition is typically anti, resulting in a trans product. Therefore, the major product should be a dibromide with trans stereochemistry at the addition sites.\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
