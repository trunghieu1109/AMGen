Question: Example(question='What is the major outcome of the reaction between 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol and bromine?', choice1='2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone', choice2='(1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol', choice3='(1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol', choice4='4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The reaction between 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol and bromine involves the addition of bromine across the double bond. The double bond in the enol will react with bromine to form a dibromo compound. Since the enol has a hydroxyl group, it will likely result in a dibromo alcohol. The stereochemistry of the addition would depend on the mechanism, but typically bromine adds in an anti fashion, leading to vicinal dibromides. The (1R,2S) stereochemistry suggests that the bromines are added on opposite sides of the plane of the ring.
