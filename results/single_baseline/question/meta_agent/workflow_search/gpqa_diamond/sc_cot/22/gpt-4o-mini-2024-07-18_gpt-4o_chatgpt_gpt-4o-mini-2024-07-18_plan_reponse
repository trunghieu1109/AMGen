            "In an experiment, a researcher reacted ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene with hydrogen bromide. After some time, they checked the progress of the reaction using TLC. They found that the reactant spot had diminished, and two new spots were formed. Which of the following could be the structures of the products?",

        "response": "The reaction of an alkene with hydrogen bromide typically follows Markovnikov's rule, where the hydrogen adds to the less substituted carbon and the bromine adds to the more substituted carbon. In this case, the alkene is part of the ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene structure. The alkene part is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-ene, which means the double bond is between the 3rd and 4th carbon of a 4-carbon chain with two methyl groups on the 2nd carbon. Adding HBr would result in a bromine adding to the more substituted carbon, which is the 3rd carbon. This would lead to the formation of (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene. Additionally, the reaction could lead to rearrangements or other products, but the most straightforward addition of HBr would lead to this product. The choice that includes (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene is choice 2, which pairs it with (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene, another possible product if the bromine adds to a different position.\n\nAnswer:B)",
