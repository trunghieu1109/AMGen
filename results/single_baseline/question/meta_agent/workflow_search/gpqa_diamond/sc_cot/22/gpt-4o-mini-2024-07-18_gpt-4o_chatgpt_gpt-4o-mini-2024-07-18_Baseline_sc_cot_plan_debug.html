    <pre>The reaction of an alkene with hydrogen bromide typically follows Markovnikov&#39;s rule, where the hydrogen adds to the less substituted carbon and the bromine adds to the more substituted carbon. In this case, the alkene is part of the ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene structure. The alkene part is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-ene, which means the double bond is between the 3rd and 4th carbon of a 4-carbon chain with two methyl groups on the 2nd carbon. Adding HBr would result in a bromine adding to the more substituted carbon, which is the 3rd carbon. This would lead to the formation of (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene. Additionally, the reaction could lead to rearrangements or other products, but the most straightforward addition of HBr would lead to this product. The choice that includes (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene is choice 2, which pairs it with (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene, another possible product if the bromine adds to a different position.
