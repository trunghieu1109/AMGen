            "In an experiment, a researcher reacted ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene with hydrogen bromide. After some time, they checked the progress of the reaction using TLC. They found that the reactant spot had diminished, and two new spots were formed. Which of the following could be the structures of the products?",

        "response": "The reaction between ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene and hydrogen bromide is likely to involve the addition of HBr across the double bond. The double bond in the alkene can react with HBr to form a carbocation intermediate, which can then react with the bromide ion to form a bromoalkane. The reaction can proceed via Markovnikov or anti-Markovnikov addition, leading to different isomeric bromoalkanes. Choice 2 suggests the formation of two isomeric bromoalkanes, which aligns with the expected outcome of the reaction of an alkene with HBr. The other choices involve different types of reactions or products that do not align with the expected reaction mechanism.\n\nAnswer:B)",
