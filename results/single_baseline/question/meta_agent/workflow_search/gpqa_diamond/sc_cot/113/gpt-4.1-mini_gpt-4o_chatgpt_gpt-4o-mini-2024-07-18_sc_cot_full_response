Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent zvyT', content="Let's analyze the reactions step by step. In the first reaction, butan-2-one reacts with NaCN to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. This is a cyanohydrin formation reaction, which typically requires an acidic workup such as H3O+ to protonate the alkoxide intermediate. Therefore, A should be H3O+. In the second reaction, 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile is converted to 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. This is a hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid, which can be done with aqueous acid such as HCl. Therefore, B should be HCl.\n\nAnswer:D", prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
