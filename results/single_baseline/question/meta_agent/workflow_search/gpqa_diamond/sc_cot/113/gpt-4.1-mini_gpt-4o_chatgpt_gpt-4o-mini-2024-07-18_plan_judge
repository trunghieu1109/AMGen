Question: Example(question='Select the suitable reagents for the following mentioned reactions.\nbutan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile\n2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid', choice1='A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH', choice2='A = NaHSO3, B = HCl', choice3='A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH', choice4='A = H3O+, B = HCl', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: Let's analyze the reactions step by step. In the first reaction, butan-2-one reacts with NaCN to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. This is a cyanohydrin formation reaction, which typically requires an acidic workup such as H3O+ to protonate the alkoxide intermediate. Therefore, A should be H3O+. In the second reaction, 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile is converted to 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. This is a hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid, which can be done with aqueous acid such as HCl. Therefore, B should be HCl.
