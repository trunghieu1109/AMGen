Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 8UBr', content='To solve the reactions, we need to identify the appropriate reagents for each step. For the first reaction, butan-2-one reacts with NaCN and we need a reagent (A) that can facilitate the formation of a hydroxy compound, which is typically an acid catalyst like H3O+. For the second reaction, we have a hydroxybutanenitrile that needs to be converted to a carboxylic acid, which can be done with a reagent (B) such as CH3COOH or HCl. After analyzing the choices, A = H3O+ and B = CH3COOH seems to fit well for the respective transformations.\n\nAnswer:A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
