        "response": "First, consider the reaction of butan-2-one with NaCN. The reaction is a cyanohydrin formation, which typically involves the addition of HCN to the ketone to form the cyanohydrin. In practice, NaCN can be used along with an acid to generate HCN in situ. Thus, A should be an acid like H3O+. For the second reaction, 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile is converted to 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. This is a hydrolysis of the nitrile group to a carboxylic acid, which can be done in acidic conditions using an acid like HCl. Therefore, B should be HCl.\n\nAnswer:D",
