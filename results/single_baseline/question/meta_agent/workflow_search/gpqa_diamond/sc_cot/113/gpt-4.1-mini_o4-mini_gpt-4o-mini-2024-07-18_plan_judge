Question: Example(question='Select the suitable reagents for the following mentioned reactions.\nbutan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile\n2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid', choice1='A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH', choice2='A = NaHSO3, B = HCl', choice3='A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH', choice4='A = H3O+, B = HCl', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The first step is cyanohydrin formation: butan-2-one + NaCN requires a proton source (H3O+ or a strong acid) to generate HCN. NaHSO3 would give a bisulfite adduct, not a cyanohydrin. The second step is acid hydrolysis of the nitrile to a carboxylic acid, which requires a strong acid such as HCl. CH3COOH is too weak for efficient nitrile hydrolysis. Thus A = H3O+ and B = HCl (choice 4).
