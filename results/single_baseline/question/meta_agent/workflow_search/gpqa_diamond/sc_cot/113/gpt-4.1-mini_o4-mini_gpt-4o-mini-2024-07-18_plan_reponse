        "response": "The first step is cyanohydrin formation: butan-2-one + NaCN requires a proton source (H3O+ or a strong acid) to generate HCN. NaHSO3 would give a bisulfite adduct, not a cyanohydrin. The second step is acid hydrolysis of the nitrile to a carboxylic acid, which requires a strong acid such as HCl. CH3COOH is too weak for efficient nitrile hydrolysis. Thus A = H3O+ and B = HCl (choice 4).\n\nAnswer:D)",
