Question: Example(question='Imagine an operator $\\vec{P}$ of a system have components $P_x, P_y$ and $P_z$. The matrix form of the  operator $P_x$ has components in the first row as $(0, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,\\hbar/\\sqrt{2},0)$.  The matrix form of the  operator $P_y$ has components in the first row as $(0, -i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0, -i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2},0)$. Similarly, matrix form of the  operator $P_z$ has components in the first row as $(\\hbar, 0, 0)$, that in the second row as $(0, 0, 0)$ and that in the third row as $(0,0, -\\hbar)$. The basis vectors here are the eigenvectors of $P_z$. The system is found in the eigenstate of $P_x$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$. To be more specific, the explicit form of the state of the system is given by the column vector having elements $(-1/2, 1/\\sqrt{2}, -1/2)$. What is the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z $ of $P_z$', choice1='\\hbar\n', choice2='\\hbar/2', choice3='\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}\n', choice4='\\sqrt{2}\\hbar', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: To find the uncertainty \( \Delta P_z \) in the state \( | \psi \rangle = \begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \ 1/\sqrt{2} \ -1/2 \end{pmatrix} \), we first calculate the expectation value \( \langle P_z \rangle \) using the matrix form of \( P_z \) and the given state. The matrix for \( P_z \) is \( \begin{pmatrix} \hbar & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -\hbar \end{pmatrix} \). The expectation value is \( \langle \psi | P_z | \psi \rangle = \begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} \hbar & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -\hbar \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\ 1/\sqrt{2} \\ -1/2 \end{pmatrix} \). Calculating this, we get \( \begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} -\hbar/2 \\ 0 \\ \hbar/2 \end{pmatrix} = \hbar/2 \). Next, we calculate \( \langle P_z^2 \rangle \) using the same state and the square of \( P_z \) which is \( \begin{pmatrix} \hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \hbar^2 \end{pmatrix} \). The expectation value \( \langle P_z^2 \rangle = \begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} \hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \hbar^2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\ 1/\sqrt{2} \\ -1/2 \end{pmatrix} = \hbar^2/2 \). Finally, the uncertainty \( \Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2} = \sqrt{\hbar^2/2 - (\hbar/2)^2} = \sqrt{\hbar^2/2 - \hbar^2/4} = \sqrt{\hbar^2/4} = \hbar/2 \).
