proposed answer: To solve this problem, we first need to normalize the state |alpha> and then find the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of the given operator. The state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. We first normalize this state. The norm is sqrt((1+i)(1-i) + (2-i)(2+i)) = sqrt(1 + 1 + 4 + 1) = sqrt(7). So the normalized state is |alpha> = ((1+i)/sqrt(7))|up> + ((2-i)/sqrt(7))|down>. Next, we need to find the eigenstates of the operator A with matrix representation Aij = hbar/2 if i != j and 0 otherwise. This operator is represented in the |up>, |down> basis as (0, hbar/2; hbar/2, 0). The eigenvalues of this matrix are +/- hbar/2, and the corresponding eigenstates are |+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). Now we express |alpha> in terms of |+> and |->. We have |up> = (|+> + |->)/sqrt(2) and |down> = (|+> - |->)/sqrt(2). Substituting these into |alpha>, we get |alpha> = ((1+i)/sqrt(7))(1/sqrt(2))(|+> + |->) + ((2-i)/sqrt(7))(1/sqrt(2))(|+> - |->). Simplifying, we find the coefficients of |+> and |->. The coefficient of |+> is ((1+i) + (2-i))/sqrt(14) = (3/sqrt(14)), and the coefficient of |-> is ((1+i) - (2-i))/sqrt(14) = (i/sqrt(14)). The probability of measuring |+> is |3/sqrt(14)|^2 = 9/14, and the probability of measuring |-> is |i/sqrt(14)|^2 = 1/14. These probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36. The average value of the operator is the expectation value, which is (9/14)(hbar/2) + (1/14)(-hbar/2) = 8hbar/28 = hbar/7. Therefore, the correct choice is 0.64, 0.36 and hbar / 7.
