    <pre>To solve this problem, we first need to normalize the state |alpha&gt; and then find the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of the given operator. The state |alpha&gt; is given as proportional to (1+i)|up&gt; + (2-i)|down&gt;. We first normalize this state. The norm is sqrt((1+i)(1-i) + (2-i)(2+i)) = sqrt(1 + 1 + 4 + 1) = sqrt(7). So the normalized state is |alpha&gt; = ((1+i)/sqrt(7))|up&gt; + ((2-i)/sqrt(7))|down&gt;. Next, we need to find the eigenstates of the operator A with matrix representation Aij = hbar/2 if i != j and 0 otherwise. This operator is represented in the |up&gt;, |down&gt; basis as (0, hbar/2; hbar/2, 0). The eigenvalues of this matrix are +/- hbar/2, and the corresponding eigenstates are |+&gt; = (|up&gt; + |down&gt;)/sqrt(2) and |-&gt; = (|up&gt; - |down&gt;)/sqrt(2). Now we express |alpha&gt; in terms of |+&gt; and |-&gt;. We have |up&gt; = (|+&gt; + |-&gt;)/sqrt(2) and |down&gt; = (|+&gt; - |-&gt;)/sqrt(2). Substituting these into |alpha&gt;, we get |alpha&gt; = ((1+i)/sqrt(7))(1/sqrt(2))(|+&gt; + |-&gt;) + ((2-i)/sqrt(7))(1/sqrt(2))(|+&gt; - |-&gt;). Simplifying, we find the coefficients of |+&gt; and |-&gt;. The coefficient of |+&gt; is ((1+i) + (2-i))/sqrt(14) = (3/sqrt(14)), and the coefficient of |-&gt; is ((1+i) - (2-i))/sqrt(14) = (i/sqrt(14)). The probability of measuring |+&gt; is |3/sqrt(14)|^2 = 9/14, and the probability of measuring |-&gt; is |i/sqrt(14)|^2 = 1/14. These probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36. The average value of the operator is the expectation value, which is (9/14)(hbar/2) + (1/14)(-hbar/2) = 8hbar/28 = hbar/7. Therefore, the correct choice is 0.64, 0.36 and hbar / 7.
