Question: Example(question='Let |alpha> be the state describing an electron, such that it is proportional to (1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>, where |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. Calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of the operator whose matrix representation is given by the elements Aij, such that Aij = hbar/2 if i is different from j, and 0 otherwise. Also, find the average value of that operator. ', choice1='0.61, 0.29 and 2*hbar / sqrt(7)', choice2='0.54, 0.46 and 3*hbar / sqrt(7)', choice3='0.28, 0.72 and hbar / sqrt(7)', choice4='0.64, 0.36 and hbar / 7', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To find the probabilities of measuring the electron in the |up> and |down> states, we need to normalize the state |alpha> and then calculate the probabilities based on the coefficients of the normalized state. The average value of the operator can be calculated using the expectation value formula based on the state |alpha> and the operator given. After performing the calculations, we compare the results with the provided choices.
