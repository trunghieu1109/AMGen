Calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of the operator whose matrix representation is given by the elements Aij, such that Aij = hbar/2 if i is different from j, and 0 otherwise. Also, find the average value of that operator. ",

        "response": "We have state |\u03b1\u27e9 \u221d (1+i)|\u2191\u27e9 + (2\u2212i)|\u2193\u27e9. Normalizing gives amplitudes a=(1+i)/\u221a7 and b=(2\u2212i)/\u221a7. The operator A has matrix \u0127/2 off-diagonals, i.e. A=(\u0127/2)\u03c3_x whose eigenstates are |\u00b1x\u27e9=(|\u2191\u27e9\u00b1|\u2193\u27e9)/\u221a2 with eigenvalues \u00b1\u0127/2. The overlap with |+x\u27e9: \u27e8+x|\u03b1\u27e9=((1+i)+(2\u2212i))/\u221a(14)=3/\u221a14 \u2192 P(+)=9/14\u22480.64. With |\u2212x\u27e9: amplitude (1+i\u22122+i)/\u221a14=(\u22121+2i)/\u221a14 \u2192 P(\u2212)=5/14\u22480.36. The expectation \u27e8A\u27e9=(\u0127/2)\u27e8\u03c3_x\u27e9 with \u27e8\u03c3_x\u27e9=2Re(a* b)=2*(1/7)=2/7 gives \u0127/7. This matches choice 4.\n\nAnswer:D)",
