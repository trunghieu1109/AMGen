Question: Example(question='You have prepared an unknown organic compound. The following 1H NMR data was obtained:\n1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.0 (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz), 5.5 (1H, dq), 2.1 (3H, s), 1.6 (3H, d)\nIdentify the unknown compound as either Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, or Trans-butenyl acetate.', choice1='Trans-propenyl acetate', choice2='Cis-propenyl acetate', choice3='Cis-butenyl acetate', choice4='Trans-butenyl acetate', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The spectrum shows two vinylic protons at 7.0 (d, J=16 Hz) and 5.5 (dq), indicating a trans-alkene (large J). The 5.5 ppm proton is also split by a methyl (1.6 ppm, d), and the 2.1 ppm singlet is an acetate methyl. This corresponds to trans-propenyl acetate.
