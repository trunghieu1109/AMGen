Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent IXzb', content='The spectrum shows two vinylic protons at 7.0 (d, J=16 Hz) and 5.5 (dq), indicating a trans-alkene (large J). The 5.5 ppm proton is also split by a methyl (1.6 ppm, d), and the 2.1 ppm singlet is an acetate methyl. This corresponds to trans-propenyl acetate.\n\nAnswer:A)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
