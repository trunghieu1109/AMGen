proposed answer: To calculate the enthalpy of formation of the compound (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2, we need to consider the bonds present in the molecule. The molecular formula is C12H20. We need the total bond energies of the molecule and compare it with the energies required to form the atoms from their standard states. First, calculate the number of each type of bond: C-C, C=C, C-H. Then use the given bond energies to find the total bond energy of the molecule. Finally, use the enthalpy of atomization to find the enthalpy of formation.
