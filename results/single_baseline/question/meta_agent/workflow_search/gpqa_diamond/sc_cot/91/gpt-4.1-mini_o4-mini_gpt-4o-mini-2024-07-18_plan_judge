Question: Example(question='Calculate the enthalpy of formation of (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Given,\nEnthalpy of atomization of carbon = 1000 kJ/mol.\nBond energy of H-H = 100 kJ/mol\nBond energy of C-C = 200 kJ/mol\nBond energy of C=C = 300 kJ/mol\nBond energy of C-H = 400 kJ/mol', choice1='11200 kJ/mol', choice2='1900 kJ/g', choice3='11.44 kJ/g', choice4='67.4 kJ/mol', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: First, determine the molecular formula and count of bonds. The molecule is C12H22 with two C=C double bonds. Each C has valence 4, so total valence bonds =12×4 +22×1 =70 electrons →35 bond‐pairs. H atoms account for 22 CH bonds →22 bond‐pairs. Remaining 35−22 =13 bond‐pairs involve only C–C: each single C–C uses 1 bond‐pair, each C=C uses 2. With 2 C=C bonds, that’s 2×2=4 bond‐pairs; the remaining 9 are C–C singles.

Atomization energies: 12 C atoms at 1000 kJ/mol =12000 kJ; 11 H₂ at 100 kJ/mol =1100 kJ; total atomization =13100 kJ. Bond formation releases 22×400 +9×200 +2×300 =8800 +1800 +600 =11200 kJ. 

ΔHf = ΔH(atomization) − ΔH(bond formation) =13100 −11200 =1900 kJ per mole. 

Among the given choices, only 1900 appears (though mis‐labelled kJ/g), so the correct choice is B).
