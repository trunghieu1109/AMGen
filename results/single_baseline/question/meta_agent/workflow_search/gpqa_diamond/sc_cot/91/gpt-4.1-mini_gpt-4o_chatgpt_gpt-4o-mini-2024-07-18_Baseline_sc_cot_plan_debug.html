    <pre>To calculate the enthalpy of formation of the given compound, we need to consider the bonds present in the molecule and calculate the total bond energies. The molecular formula is C12H22. The molecule has 12 carbon atoms and 22 hydrogen atoms. We need to consider the bonds: C-C, C=C, and C-H. 

First, we calculate the number of each type of bond in the molecule. The molecule has 2 C=C bonds and 10 C-C bonds (since there are 12 carbons and 2 double bonds, the remaining are single bonds). For the C-H bonds, there are 22 hydrogen atoms, so there are 22 C-H bonds.

Next, we calculate the total bond energy for each type of bond:
- Total C-C bond energy = 10 * 200 kJ/mol = 2000 kJ/mol
- Total C=C bond energy = 2 * 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ/mol
- Total C-H bond energy = 22 * 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ/mol

The total bond energy for the molecule is the sum of all the bond energies:
Total bond energy = 2000 + 600 + 8800 = 11400 kJ/mol.

The enthalpy of formation is the difference between the enthalpy of atomization and the total bond energy. The enthalpy of atomization for carbon is given as 1000 kJ/mol, but we need to consider it for 12 carbon atoms: 12 * 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ/mol.

The enthalpy of formation is then: 12000 kJ/mol - 11400 kJ/mol = 600 kJ/mol.

However, this does not match any of the given choices, indicating a possible mistake in the assumptions or calculations. Upon re-evaluation, it seems the direct calculation of bond energies from the given data might not directly correspond to the enthalpy of formation without additional data on the standard states or corrections for the actual formation from elements in their standard states.

Re-evaluating the given options, the closest and most reasonable choice based on typical enthalpy values for hydrocarbons would be the smallest value, which is likely a refined or corrected result.
