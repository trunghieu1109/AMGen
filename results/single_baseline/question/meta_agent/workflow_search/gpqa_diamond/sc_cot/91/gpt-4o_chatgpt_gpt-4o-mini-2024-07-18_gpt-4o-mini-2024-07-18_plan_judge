Given,\nEnthalpy of atomization of carbon = 1000 kJ/mol.\nBond energy of H-H = 100 kJ/mol\nBond energy of C-C = 200 kJ/mol\nBond energy of C=C = 300 kJ/mol\nBond energy of C-H = 400 kJ/mol', choice1='11200 kJ/mol', choice2='1900 kJ/g', choice3='11.44 kJ/g', choice4='67.4 kJ/mol', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To calculate the enthalpy of formation of the compound (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2, we need to consider the number of atoms involved and the bond energies given. We will first determine the number of each type of bond in the molecule and then use the bond energies to calculate the total energy change associated with forming the compound from its constituent atoms. The enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the formula: ΔH_f = Σ(bond energies of reactants) - Σ(bond energies of products). After calculating, we will compare our result with the provided choices.

Answer:11200 kJ/mol
Extracted answer: 11200 kJ/mol
Correct answer: 3
