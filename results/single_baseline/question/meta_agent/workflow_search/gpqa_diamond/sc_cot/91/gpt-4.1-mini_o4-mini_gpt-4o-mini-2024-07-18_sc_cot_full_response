Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent QGSl', content='First, determine the molecular formula and count of bonds. The molecule is C12H22 with two C=C double bonds. Each C has valence 4, so total valence bonds =12×4 +22×1 =70 electrons →35 bond‐pairs. H atoms account for 22 CH bonds →22 bond‐pairs. Remaining 35−22 =13 bond‐pairs involve only C–C: each single C–C uses 1 bond‐pair, each C=C uses 2. With 2 C=C bonds, that’s 2×2=4 bond‐pairs; the remaining 9 are C–C singles.\n\nAtomization energies: 12 C atoms at 1000 kJ/mol =12000 kJ; 11 H₂ at 100 kJ/mol =1100 kJ; total atomization =13100 kJ. Bond formation releases 22×400 +9×200 +2×300 =8800 +1800 +600 =11200 kJ. \n\nΔHf = ΔH(atomization) − ΔH(bond formation) =13100 −11200 =1900 kJ per mole. \n\nAmong the given choices, only 1900 appears (though mis‐labelled kJ/g), so the correct choice is B).\n\nAnswer:B)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
