Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent xbLD', content='To find the momentum of the absorbed photon, we need to calculate the energy difference between the fundamental state and the next state of the molecule, which involves both rotational and vibrational transitions. First, calculate the reduced mass μ of the diatomic molecule using the formula μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My). With Mx = 20 amu and My = 2 amu, μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 / 22 amu. Convert this to kg by multiplying by 1.66053906660 × 10^-27 kg/amu. Next, calculate the moment of inertia I = μ * R^2, where R = 2 angstroms = 2 × 10^-10 m. The energy of a rotational transition ΔE_rot is given by B(J+1)(J+2), where B = h / (8π^2I), and J is the rotational quantum number. For the lowest energy transition, J = 0 to J = 1. Calculate B and then ΔE_rot. For the vibrational transition, use ΔE_vib = ħω, where ω = 4 × 10^14 rad/s. The total energy change ΔE = ΔE_rot + ΔE_vib. The momentum of the photon p is given by p = ΔE / c, where c is the speed of light, 3 × 10^8 m/s. Calculate p and compare with the given choices.\n\nAnswer:A)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
