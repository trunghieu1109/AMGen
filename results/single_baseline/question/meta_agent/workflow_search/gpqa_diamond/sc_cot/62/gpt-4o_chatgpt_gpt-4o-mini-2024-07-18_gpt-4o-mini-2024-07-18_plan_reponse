            "Let there be a diatomic molecule, with elements X and Y, that can be modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model (or non-rigid rotor model). If the molecule is in its fundamental state, what momentum should an absorbed photon have, in order for the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy?\nMx: mass of atom X = 20 amu\nMy: mass of atom Y = 2 amu\nR: molecular bond length = 2 angstroms\nw: angular frequency of vibration = 4*10^14 rad/s",

        "response": "To determine the momentum of the absorbed photon that allows the molecule to transition to the next state, we need to consider the energy levels of the rotational states of the diatomic molecule. The energy difference between the rotational states can be calculated using the formula for the rotational energy levels of a diatomic molecule. The momentum of the photon is related to the energy of the photon by the equation E = pc, where E is the energy of the photon, p is its momentum, and c is the speed of light. The energy difference between the states will correspond to the energy of the absorbed photon, allowing us to calculate the required momentum.\n\nAnswer:p = 2.3*10^(-27) N*s",
