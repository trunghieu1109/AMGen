            "Let there be a diatomic molecule, with elements X and Y, that can be modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model (or non-rigid rotor model). If the molecule is in its fundamental state, what momentum should an absorbed photon have, in order for the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy?\nMx: mass of atom X = 20 amu\nMy: mass of atom Y = 2 amu\nR: molecular bond length = 2 angstroms\nw: angular frequency of vibration = 4*10^14 rad/s",

        "response": "We consider the molecule initially in its ground vibrational state (v=0) and look for the lowest\u2010energy excited state. In the quantum harmonic oscillator model the vibrational levels are separated by \u0394E = \u0127\u03c9. Given \u03c9 = 4\u00d710^14 s^\u20131, \u0127 = 1.05\u00d710^\u201334 J\u00b7s, we have \u0394E = \u0127\u03c9 = (1.05\u00d710^\u201334 J\u00b7s)(4\u00d710^14 s^\u20131) = 4.2\u00d710^\u201320 J. The photon momentum is p = \u0394E/c. With c \u2248 3\u00d710^8 m/s, p = 4.2\u00d710^\u201320 J / 3\u00d710^8 m/s \u2248 1.4\u00d710^\u201328 N\u00b7s, which matches choice D).\n\nAnswer:D)",
