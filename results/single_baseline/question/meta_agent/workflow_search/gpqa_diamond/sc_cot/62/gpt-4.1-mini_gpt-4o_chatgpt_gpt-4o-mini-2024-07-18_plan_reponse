        "response": "To find the momentum of the absorbed photon, we need to determine the energy difference between the initial and the next state of the molecule. In the quantum rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are quantized. The rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = B * J * (J + 1), where B is the rotational constant and J is the rotational quantum number. The vibrational energy levels are E_vib = (v + 1/2) * \u0127 * w, where v is the vibrational quantum number. In the fundamental state, J = 0 and v = 0. The next state with the lowest possible energy is typically the first excited rotational state (J = 1, v = 0). The rotational constant B is given by B = \u0127^2 / (2 * I), where I is the moment of inertia I = \u03bc * R^2, and \u03bc is the reduced mass \u03bc = Mx * My / (Mx + My). Calculate \u03bc, then I, then B. The energy difference \u0394E = E_rot(J=1) - E_rot(J=0) = 2B. The momentum of the photon is given by p = \u0394E / c, where c is the speed of light.\n\nAnswer:C",
