Question: Example(question='Let there be a diatomic molecule, with elements X and Y, that can be modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model (or non-rigid rotor model). If the molecule is in its fundamental state, what momentum should an absorbed photon have, in order for the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy?\nMx: mass of atom X = 20 amu\nMy: mass of atom Y = 2 amu\nR: molecular bond length = 2 angstroms\nw: angular frequency of vibration = 4*10^14 rad/s', choice1='p = 2.3*10^(-27) N*s', choice2='p = 1.9*10^(-28) N*s', choice3='p = 1.1*10^(-27) N*s', choice4='p = 1.4*10^(-28) N*s', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To find the momentum of the absorbed photon, we need to determine the energy difference between the initial and the next state of the molecule. In the quantum rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are quantized. The rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = B * J * (J + 1), where B is the rotational constant and J is the rotational quantum number. The vibrational energy levels are E_vib = (v + 1/2) * ħ * w, where v is the vibrational quantum number. In the fundamental state, J = 0 and v = 0. The next state with the lowest possible energy is typically the first excited rotational state (J = 1, v = 0). The rotational constant B is given by B = ħ^2 / (2 * I), where I is the moment of inertia I = μ * R^2, and μ is the reduced mass μ = Mx * My / (Mx + My). Calculate μ, then I, then B. The energy difference ΔE = E_rot(J=1) - E_rot(J=0) = 2B. The momentum of the photon is given by p = ΔE / c, where c is the speed of light.
