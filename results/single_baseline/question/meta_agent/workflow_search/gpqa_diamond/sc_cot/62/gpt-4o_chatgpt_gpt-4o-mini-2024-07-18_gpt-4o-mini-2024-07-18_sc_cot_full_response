Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent BDny', content='To determine the momentum of the absorbed photon that allows the molecule to transition to the next state, we need to consider the energy levels of the rotational states of the diatomic molecule. The energy difference between the rotational states can be calculated using the formula for the rotational energy levels of a diatomic molecule. The momentum of the photon is related to the energy of the photon by the equation E = pc, where E is the energy of the photon, p is its momentum, and c is the speed of light. The energy difference between the states will correspond to the energy of the absorbed photon, allowing us to calculate the required momentum.\n\nAnswer:p = 2.3*10^(-27) N*s', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
