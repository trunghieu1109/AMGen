        "response": "To find the momentum of the absorbed photon, we need to calculate the energy difference between the fundamental state and the next state of the molecule, which involves both rotational and vibrational transitions. First, calculate the reduced mass \u03bc of the diatomic molecule using the formula \u03bc = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My). With Mx = 20 amu and My = 2 amu, \u03bc = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 / 22 amu. Convert this to kg by multiplying by 1.66053906660 \u00d7 10^-27 kg/amu. Next, calculate the moment of inertia I = \u03bc * R^2, where R = 2 angstroms = 2 \u00d7 10^-10 m. The energy of a rotational transition \u0394E_rot is given by B(J+1)(J+2), where B = h / (8\u03c0^2I), and J is the rotational quantum number. For the lowest energy transition, J = 0 to J = 1. Calculate B and then \u0394E_rot. For the vibrational transition, use \u0394E_vib = \u0127\u03c9, where \u03c9 = 4 \u00d7 10^14 rad/s. The total energy change \u0394E = \u0394E_rot + \u0394E_vib. The momentum of the photon p is given by p = \u0394E / c, where c is the speed of light, 3 \u00d7 10^8 m/s. Calculate p and compare with the given choices.\n\nAnswer:A)",
