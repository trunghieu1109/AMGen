Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent BDny', content='To find the momentum of the absorbed photon, we need to determine the energy difference between the initial and the next state of the molecule. In the quantum rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are quantized. The rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = B * J * (J + 1), where B is the rotational constant and J is the rotational quantum number. The vibrational energy levels are E_vib = (v + 1/2) * ħ * w, where v is the vibrational quantum number. In the fundamental state, J = 0 and v = 0. The next state with the lowest possible energy is typically the first excited rotational state (J = 1, v = 0). The rotational constant B is given by B = ħ^2 / (2 * I), where I is the moment of inertia I = μ * R^2, and μ is the reduced mass μ = Mx * My / (Mx + My). Calculate μ, then I, then B. The energy difference ΔE = E_rot(J=1) - E_rot(J=0) = 2B. The momentum of the photon is given by p = ΔE / c, where c is the speed of light.\n\nAnswer:C', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
