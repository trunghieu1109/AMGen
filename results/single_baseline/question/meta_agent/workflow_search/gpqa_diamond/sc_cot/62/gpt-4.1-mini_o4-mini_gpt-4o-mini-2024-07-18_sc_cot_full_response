Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent Z92x', content='We consider the molecule initially in its ground vibrational state (v=0) and look for the lowest‐energy excited state. In the quantum harmonic oscillator model the vibrational levels are separated by ΔE = ħω. Given ω = 4×10^14 s^–1, ħ = 1.05×10^–34 J·s, we have ΔE = ħω = (1.05×10^–34 J·s)(4×10^14 s^–1) = 4.2×10^–20 J. The photon momentum is p = ΔE/c. With c ≈ 3×10^8 m/s, p = 4.2×10^–20 J / 3×10^8 m/s ≈ 1.4×10^–28 N·s, which matches choice D).\n\nAnswer:D)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
