        "response": "The problem involves finding the mass of the pseudo-Goldstone boson H2 through radiative corrections in an extension of the Standard Model. The mass formula is given in terms of various particle masses and couplings. We need to identify which choice correctly represents the mass of H2. The key is to look at the structure of the mass formula and the terms involved. The pseudo-Goldstone boson mass is typically given by radiative corrections involving loop integrals, which often result in a factor like 1/(8\u03c0^2) in front of the expression. Therefore, the correct choice should have this factor in the denominator, not the numerator. Additionally, the mass terms should be squared and involve the correct particles. Let's compare the choices based on these criteria.\n\nAnswer:C)",
