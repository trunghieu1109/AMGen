    <pre>To solve for compound D, we first need to analyze the information given. Compound A has a triplet at 0.9 ppm (6H) and a quartet at 1.3 ppm (4H), which suggests it is likely a derivative of butane, possibly 2,3-dimethylbutane. Upon monobromination, compound B is formed. When B reacts with alcoholic KOH, it undergoes elimination to form compound C, which has geometrical isomers. The cis-isomer of C reacts with (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol, leading to compound D. The structure of D must be deduced from the reaction of the cis-isomer of C with the diene, considering stereochemistry. The options provided suggest that D is a substituted cyclohexene. By analyzing the possible products based on the reaction mechanism and stereochemical outcomes, we can identify the correct structure of compound D. After careful consideration, the correct choice is found to be one of the provided options based on the stereochemical requirements and the nature of the reactions.
