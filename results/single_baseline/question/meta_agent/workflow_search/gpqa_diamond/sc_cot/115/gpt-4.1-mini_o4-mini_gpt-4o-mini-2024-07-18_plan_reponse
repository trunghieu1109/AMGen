            "Compound A shows two signals in the proton NMR, a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. It undergoes monobromination to form compound B. B reacts with alcoholic KOH to form C, which has two geometrical isomers. The cis-isomer of C reacts with (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol to produce compound D. Identify compound D.",

        "response": "Compound A shows a triplet (6H) and quartet (4H) consistent with n-butane. Radical bromination gives mainly 2-bromobutane (B), which on elimination yields cis- and trans-2-butene (C). The cis-isomer as dienophile undergoes an endo Diels\u2013Alder with (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol diene to give a cyclohexene bearing three cis methyls at C4, C5, and C6 and an OH at C1. Of the choices, the stereochemistry with all three methyls cis corresponds to (1S,4R,5S,6S)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol, choice 1, i.e. A).\n\nAnswer:A)",
