    <pre>Compound A shows two signals in the proton NMR: a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. This suggests that Compound A is likely to be an alkane with two methyl groups (CH3) each next to a CH2 group, such as butane. The pattern matches 2,3-dimethylbutane. Upon monobromination, one of the methyl groups is likely brominated, forming 2-bromo-2,3-dimethylbutane (compound B). Reacting B with alcoholic KOH would lead to an elimination reaction, forming an alkene, likely 2,3-dimethyl-2-butene (compound C), which has two geometrical isomers (cis and trans). The cis-isomer reacts with (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol in a Diels-Alder reaction. The Diels-Alder reaction would form a cyclohexene derivative. The structure of the product suggests the formation of (1S,4R,5S,6R)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol, which matches choice 3.
