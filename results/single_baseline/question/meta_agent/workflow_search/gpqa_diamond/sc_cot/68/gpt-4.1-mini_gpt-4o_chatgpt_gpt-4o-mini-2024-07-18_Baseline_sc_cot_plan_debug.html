    <pre>To find the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays, we need to determine the distance traveled by X^0 before decaying. The decay is exponential, so the fraction of particles decayed by time t is given by 1 - exp(-t/τ). We want this fraction to be 0.3, so we solve 0.3 = 1 - exp(-t/τ) for t, which gives t = -τ ln(0.7). The proper lifetime τ_0 is given, and we need to account for time dilation due to the relativistic speed of X^0. The time dilation factor is γ = E/mc^2, where E is the energy and m is the mass. E = 27 GeV, m = 3.41 GeV, so γ = 27/3.41. The dilated lifetime is τ = γτ_0. The distance traveled is d = vτ, where v ≈ c for relativistic speeds. Therefore, d = cγτ_0(-ln(0.7)). Calculate this distance to find the minimum resolution.
