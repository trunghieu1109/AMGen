Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent z13v', content='We’re given τ₀=8×10⁻¹⁶\u2009s, E=27\u2009GeV, m=3.41\u2009GeV ⇒ γ=E/m≈7.92. Mean decay length L=γcτ₀≈7.92×3×10⁸\u2009m/s×8×10⁻¹⁶\u2009s≈1.9×10⁻⁶\u2009m (≈2.08×10⁻⁶\u2009m). To see 30% of decays we need x such that 1–exp(–x/L)=0.3 ⇒ x≈L·(–ln0.7)≈0.36L≈0.7×10⁻⁶\u2009m, which is of order 10⁻⁶\u2009m. The closest choice is 2.08×10⁻⁶\u2009m.\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
