        "response": "To find the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays, we need to determine the distance traveled by X^0 before decaying. The decay is exponential, so the fraction of particles decayed by time t is given by 1 - exp(-t/\u03c4). We want this fraction to be 0.3, so we solve 0.3 = 1 - exp(-t/\u03c4) for t, which gives t = -\u03c4 ln(0.7). The proper lifetime \u03c4_0 is given, and we need to account for time dilation due to the relativistic speed of X^0. The time dilation factor is \u03b3 = E/mc^2, where E is the energy and m is the mass. E = 27 GeV, m = 3.41 GeV, so \u03b3 = 27/3.41. The dilated lifetime is \u03c4 = \u03b3\u03c4_0. The distance traveled is d = v\u03c4, where v \u2248 c for relativistic speeds. Therefore, d = c\u03b3\u03c4_0(-ln(0.7)). Calculate this distance to find the minimum resolution.\n\nAnswer:D)",
