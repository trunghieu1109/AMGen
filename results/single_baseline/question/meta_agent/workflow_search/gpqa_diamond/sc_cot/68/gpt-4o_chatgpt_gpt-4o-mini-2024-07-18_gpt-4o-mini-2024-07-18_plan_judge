What minimum resolution is needed to observe at least 30% of the decays? Knowing that the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27GeV, and the mass of X^{0} is 3.41GeV.', choice1='2.08*1e-1 m', choice2='2.08*1e-9 m', choice3='2.08*1e-6 m', choice4='2.08*1e-3 m', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To determine the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of the particle X^0, we first need to calculate the distance the particle travels before decaying. The proper lifetime of X^0 is given as τ_0 = 8 × 10^{-16} s. We also need to calculate the speed of the particle using its energy and mass, and then use this to find the distance traveled during its lifetime. The energy of the particle is 27 GeV, and using the mass of X^0 (3.41 GeV), we can find its relativistic speed and the distance it travels in the given proper lifetime. Once we have this distance, we can determine the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays, which will be a fraction of the distance traveled. After performing the calculations, we can compare the result to the provided choices to find the correct answer.
