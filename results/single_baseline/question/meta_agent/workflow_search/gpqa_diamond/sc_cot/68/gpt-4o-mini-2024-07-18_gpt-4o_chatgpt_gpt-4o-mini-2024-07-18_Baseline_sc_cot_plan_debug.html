    <pre>To determine the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays, we need to calculate the distance traveled by the particle before it decays. This is related to the lifetime of the particle and its velocity. We use the formula for decay length: L = \beta \gamma c \tau_0, where \beta is the velocity as a fraction of the speed of light, \gamma is the Lorentz factor, c is the speed of light, and \tau_0 is the proper lifetime. First, we calculate the Lorentz factor \gamma = E/mc^2 = 27 \, \text{GeV} / 3.41 \, \text{GeV} = 7.92. The velocity \beta is approximately 1 since the energy is much larger than the rest mass. Therefore, the decay length is L = \gamma c \tau_0 = 7.92 \times 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \times 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s} = 1.9 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}. To observe at least 30% of the decays, we need a resolution that covers at least 30% of the decay length. The decay length for 30% is L_{30} = -\ln(0.7) \times 1.9 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \approx 6.1 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}. The closest choice is 2.08 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}.
