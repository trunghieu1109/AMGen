Question: Example(question='1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. How many possible organic products are there in this reaction?', choice1='4', choice2='3', choice3='1', choice4='2', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: In benzyne formation from 1-bromo-2-D-benzene, NaNHâ‚‚ can abstract either the D (at C2) or the H (at C6). Elimination of D gives an unlabeled benzyne (hence unlabeled aniline after addition). Elimination of H gives a benzyne retaining D at C2, and nucleophilic attack at either end of the triple bond yields two distinct D-labeled aniline isotopomers (2-D and 5-D). Total = 3 products.

Answer:B)
Extracted answer: B)
Correct answer: 2
