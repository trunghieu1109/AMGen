Question: Example(question='1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. How many possible organic products are there in this reaction?', choice1='4', choice2='3', choice3='1', choice4='2', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: 1-bromobenzene-2-d is a deuterated bromobenzene where deuterium (D) is at the 2-position. When treated with NaNH2 in liquid ammonia, it undergoes a benzyne elimination-addition mechanism. The NaNH2 deprotonates the hydrogen ortho to the bromine, forming a benzyne intermediate. The benzyne can be attacked by the amide ion at either end of the triple bond, leading to different substitution products. Since the starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d, the deuterium affects the possible products. However, the main products will be aniline derivatives where NH2 is added at positions ortho or meta to the original bromine position. Considering the possible positions for nucleophilic attack, there are 2 possible products: one where NH2 is added at the 2-position (where D was) and one where NH2 is added at the 3-position.
