Question: Example(question='1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. How many possible organic products are there in this reaction?', choice1='4', choice2='3', choice3='1', choice4='2', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: 1-bromobenzene-2-d is a benzene ring with a bromine atom and a deuterium atom on adjacent carbons. When treated with NaNH2 in liquid ammonia, this is a typical reaction for benzyne formation. The NaNH2 can abstract the proton adjacent to the bromine, leading to the formation of a benzyne intermediate. The benzyne can be attacked by the amide ion (NH2-) at either end, leading to two possible aniline derivatives. Additionally, the deuterium can end up on different positions in the final product due to the scrambling that can occur during the reaction. Therefore, there are multiple possible products due to different sites of nucleophilic attack and deuterium placement.
