Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent tiVI', content='In benzyne formation from 1-bromo-2-D-benzene, NaNHâ‚‚ can abstract either the D (at C2) or the H (at C6). Elimination of D gives an unlabeled benzyne (hence unlabeled aniline after addition). Elimination of H gives a benzyne retaining D at C2, and nucleophilic attack at either end of the triple bond yields two distinct D-labeled aniline isotopomers (2-D and 5-D). Total = 3 products.\n\nAnswer:B)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
