Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent Sh5D', content='1-bromobenzene-2-d is an aromatic compound that can undergo nucleophilic substitution reactions. When treated with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia, the bromine can be replaced by a nucleophile. The presence of the deuterium (D) at the 2-position can lead to different substitution patterns. The reaction can potentially yield multiple products depending on the position of substitution and the stability of the resulting intermediates. Considering the positions available for substitution and the stability of the products, I will analyze the possible outcomes.\n\nAnswer:4', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
