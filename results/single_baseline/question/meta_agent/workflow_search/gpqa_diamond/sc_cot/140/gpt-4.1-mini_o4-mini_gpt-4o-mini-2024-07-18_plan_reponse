        "response": "In benzyne formation from 1-bromo-2-D-benzene, NaNH\u2082 can abstract either the D (at C2) or the H (at C6). Elimination of D gives an unlabeled benzyne (hence unlabeled aniline after addition). Elimination of H gives a benzyne retaining D at C2, and nucleophilic attack at either end of the triple bond yields two distinct D-labeled aniline isotopomers (2-D and 5-D). Total = 3 products.\n\nAnswer:B)",
