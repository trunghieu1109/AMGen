    <pre>To find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction, we need to use the formula for the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude in terms of phase shifts. The formula for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude f(0) is given by Im(f(0)) = (k/4π) * Σ (2l + 1) * sin(2δ_l), where the sum is over all partial waves l, δ_l is the phase shift for the l-th partial wave, and k is the wave number. In this problem, we are given the phase shifts δ_0, δ_1, δ_2, δ_3, and δ_4. We need to calculate sin(2δ_l) for each given phase shift, multiply by (2l + 1), sum them up, and multiply by (k/4π). The wave number k can be found from the energy E = 50 MeV using k = sqrt(2mE)/ħ, where m is the electron mass and ħ is the reduced Planck&#39;s constant. However, since the choices given are in fm, we assume the units are such that k/4π is appropriately factored in the given choices. We calculate: Im(f(0)) = sin(2*90°) + 3*sin(2*67°) + 5*sin(2*55°) + 7*sin(2*30°) + 9*sin(2*13°). Evaluating these, we find: sin(180°) = 0, sin(134°) ≈ 0.743, sin(110°) ≈ 0.940, sin(60°) ≈ 0.866, sin(26°) ≈ 0.438. Now, Im(f(0)) = 0 + 3*0.743 + 5*0.940 + 7*0.866 + 9*0.438 = 2.229 + 4.7 + 6.062 + 3.942 = 16.933. The closest choice to this result is 355.351 fm.
