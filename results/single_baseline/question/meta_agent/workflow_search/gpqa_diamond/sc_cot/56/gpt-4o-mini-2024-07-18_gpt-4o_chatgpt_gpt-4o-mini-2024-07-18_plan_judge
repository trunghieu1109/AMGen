Question: Example(question='Given the measured phase shifts $\\delta_o=90^o, \\delta_1=67^o, \\delta_2=55, \\delta_3=30^o$ and $\\delta_4=13^o$ in an experiment of elastic scattering of $50~MeV$ electrons from a nuclear target. Ignore rest of the phase shifts. Calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. ', choice1='177.675 fm\n', choice2='87163.4 fm\n', choice3='251.271 fm\n', choice4='355.351 fm', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction is given by the optical theorem, which relates it to the total cross-section. However, in this context, we need to consider the phase shifts and use the partial wave expansion of the scattering amplitude. The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude f(0) in the forward direction is given by Im(f(0)) = (1/2ik) sum( (2l+1) * sin^2(delta_l) ), where k is the wave number and delta_l are the phase shifts. We are given delta_0, delta_1, delta_2, delta_3, and delta_4, and we can ignore higher phase shifts. We need to calculate this sum using the given phase shifts.
