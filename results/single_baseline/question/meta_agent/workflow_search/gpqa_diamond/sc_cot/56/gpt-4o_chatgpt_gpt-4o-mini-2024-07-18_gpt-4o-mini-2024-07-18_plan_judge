Question: Example(question='Given the measured phase shifts $\\delta_o=90^o, \\delta_1=67^o, \\delta_2=55, \\delta_3=30^o$ and $\\delta_4=13^o$ in an experiment of elastic scattering of $50~MeV$ electrons from a nuclear target. Ignore rest of the phase shifts. Calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. ', choice1='177.675 fm\n', choice2='87163.4 fm\n', choice3='251.271 fm\n', choice4='355.351 fm', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, we typically use the phase shifts given. In this case, we can use the formula for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude in terms of the phase shifts. The relevant formula relates the phase shifts to the scattering amplitude. We need to take into account the contributions of the phase shifts provided. After calculating the contributions and summing them up, we can determine the correct value for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude.
