Question: Example(question='Which of the following (effective) particles is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry?', choice1='Magnon', choice2='Skyrmion', choice3='Pion', choice4='Phonon', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To determine which particle is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry, we need to consider each option: Magnons are quasiparticles associated with the collective excitation of electron spins in a lattice, related to the spontaneous breaking of spin rotational symmetry. Skyrmions are topological solitons that arise in certain field theories, often related to broken symmetries in nuclear and condensed matter physics. Pions are associated with the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics. Phonons, however, are quasiparticles representing quantized sound waves in a crystal lattice, and are not typically associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry.
