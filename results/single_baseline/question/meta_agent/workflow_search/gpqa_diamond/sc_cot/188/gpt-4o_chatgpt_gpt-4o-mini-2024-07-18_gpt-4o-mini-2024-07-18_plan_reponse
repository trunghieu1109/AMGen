        "response": "To determine which particle is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry, we need to analyze each option. Magnons are associated with the spontaneous breaking of spin symmetry in magnetic systems. Skyrmions are topological solitons that also relate to spontaneous symmetry breaking in certain field theories. Pions are the Goldstone bosons associated with the breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics. Phonons, however, are quantized modes of vibrations in a lattice and do not arise from spontaneously broken symmetries in the same sense as the others. Therefore, the answer is Phonon.\n\nAnswer:D",
