Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 1Dfi', content='Magnons are spin-wave Goldstone bosons from broken spin-rotational symmetry; pions are pseudo-Goldstone bosons from chiral symmetry breaking in QCD; phonons are Goldstone bosons of broken continuous translation symmetry in crystals. Skyrmions, by contrast, are topological solitons, not Goldstone modes of a spontaneously-broken symmetry.\n\nAnswer:B)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
