        "response": "To determine which particle is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry, we need to analyze each option. A magnon is a quasiparticle associated with the collective excitation in a crystal lattice, often related to spin waves in a magnetically ordered system, which is a result of spontaneously broken symmetry. A skyrmion is a topological soliton used to describe certain configurations in field theories, and can be associated with broken symmetries in certain contexts. A pion is a Goldstone boson associated with the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics. A phonon is a quasiparticle representing quantized lattice vibrations and is not typically associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry in the same sense as the others. Therefore, the phonon is the particle not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry.\n\nAnswer:D)",
