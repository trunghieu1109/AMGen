        "response": "Magnons are spin-wave Goldstone bosons from broken spin-rotational symmetry; pions are pseudo-Goldstone bosons from chiral symmetry breaking in QCD; phonons are Goldstone bosons of broken continuous translation symmetry in crystals. Skyrmions, by contrast, are topological solitons, not Goldstone modes of a spontaneously-broken symmetry.\n\nAnswer:B)",
