Question: Example(question='Which of the following (effective) particles is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry?', choice1='Magnon', choice2='Skyrmion', choice3='Pion', choice4='Phonon', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: Magnons are spin-wave Goldstone bosons from broken spin-rotational symmetry; pions are pseudo-Goldstone bosons from chiral symmetry breaking in QCD; phonons are Goldstone bosons of broken continuous translation symmetry in crystals. Skyrmions, by contrast, are topological solitons, not Goldstone modes of a spontaneously-broken symmetry.

Answer:B)
Extracted answer: B)
