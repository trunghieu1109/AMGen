The central B atom is sp\u00b2\u2010hybridized and trigonal\u2010planar, each O bound to a CH(CH\u2083)\u2082 substituent.  \n\n2. Quinuclidine is the well\u2010known bicyclic tertiary amine C\u2087H\u2081\u2083N. It consists of a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane skeleton with a nitrogen at one bridgehead.

There is no mirror plane or inversion center (the nitrogen lone pair breaks planarity and homonuclear inversion symmetry), so the net symmetry is also C3. 3) The benzo-trifuran hexaone is a fully planar system with three identical furan-1,3-dione units fused symmetrically onto a benzene core. It thus has a three\u2010fold axis perpendicular to the molecular plane (C3), a horizontal mirror plane in that plane (\u03c3h), and three vertical mirror planes (\u03c3v) each bisecting one furan and the opposite C\u2013C bond of the benzene. That combination corresponds to D3h symmetry. 4) The triphenyleno-trifuran hexaone is likewise a planar PAH core fused to three identical furan-diones at its three bay regions. It also has C3, \u03c3h in the molecular plane, and three \u03c3v planes, giving D3h.; answer - Triisopropyl borate: C3 axis only \u2192 C3 point group\nQuinuclidine: approximate C3 axis only \u2192 C3 point group\nBenzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone: C3 axis + \u03c3h + 3\u03c3v \u2192 D3h point group\nTriphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone: C3 axis + \u03c3h + 3\u03c3v \u2192 D3h point group\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - To determine C3h symmetry, each molecule must have a principal C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane (\u03c3h) perpendicular to that axis. Triisopropyl borate has three identical isopropoxy groups around trigonal planar B, giving a C3 axis, but the bulky alkyl groups are not coplanar in a mirror plane, so there is no \u03c3h. Quinuclidine has an approximate C3 axis through the cage nitrogen and three equivalent CH2\u2013CH2 bridges, but its nonplanar, puckered structure lacks a horizontal mirror plane. Both therefore fall in point group C3, not C3h. The two fused\u2010furan hexaones (benzo[...]hexaone and triphenyleno[...]hexaone) are fully planar PAHs with three identical furan-1,3-dione units symmetrically fused, yielding a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane and a \u03c3h coincident with that plane (along with three \u03c3v planes). These satisfy all C3h symmetry elements. Potential limitations arise from distortions or out\u2010of\u2010plane bending, but idealized rigid structures give these assignments.; answer - Triisopropyl borate: no C3h symmetry; Quinuclidine: no C3h symmetry; Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone: yes, C3h symmetry; Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone: yes, C3h symmetry\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - To have C3h symmetry, a molecule must possess a principal C3 rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane (\u03c3h) perpendicular to that axis. Both the benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone and the triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone are fully planar fused\u2010ring systems with three identical furan-1,3-dione units arranged evenly around the central ring structure. This arrangement provides a threefold rotation axis perpendicular to the molecular plane and the molecular plane itself serves as a \u03c3h mirror plane. Thus they fulfill all symmetry requirements for point group C3h.; answer - Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone; Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - C3h symmetry requires a principal C3 rotation axis perpendicular to the molecular plane and a horizontal mirror plane (\u03c3h) coincident with that plane. Both benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone (choice C) and triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone (choice D) are fully planar fused-ring systems with three identical furan-1,3-dione units symmetrically arranged around a central core, providing the required C3 axis and \u03c3h plane. The other options lack this symmetry arrangement.; answer - C and D"
