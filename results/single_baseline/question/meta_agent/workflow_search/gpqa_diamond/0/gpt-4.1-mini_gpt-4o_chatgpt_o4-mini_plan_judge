proposed answer: Based on the analysis provided by the debate agents, triisopropyl borate is consistently identified as the molecule that exhibits C3h symmetry. This conclusion is reached because triisopropyl borate has a C3 rotational axis due to the symmetrical arrangement of the three isopropyl groups around the central boron atom. Additionally, the presence of a horizontal mirror plane is plausible, as the plane containing the boron and the three isopropyl groups can serve as this mirror plane, reflecting the molecule onto itself. The other molecules, such as quinuclidine and the complex polycyclic structures, lack the necessary symmetrical features to support C3 or C3h symmetry. Therefore, triisopropyl borate is the only candidate that can exhibit C3h symmetry.
