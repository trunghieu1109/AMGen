proposed answer: C3h symmetry requires a molecule to have a principal C3 rotational axis and a horizontal mirror plane perpendicular to this axis. Among the given molecules, triisopropyl borate has a trigonal planar arrangement around the boron atom with three identical isopropyl groups symmetrically arranged. This structure provides the necessary C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane, fulfilling the criteria for C3h symmetry. Quinuclidine, due to its bicyclic cage structure, does not have these symmetry elements. The complex polycyclic compounds benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone and triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone, although planar, lack the required combination of C3 rotational symmetry and a horizontal mirror plane. Therefore, triisopropyl borate is the only molecule among the choices with C3h symmetry.

proposed answer: Triisopropyl borate has a boron atom bonded to three isopropyl groups arranged in a trigonal planar geometry, which provides a threefold rotational axis (C3). Additionally, it has a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to this axis. These symmetry elements together define the C3h point group. The other molecules, quinuclidine and the two complex polycyclic compounds, lack either the threefold rotational axis or the horizontal mirror plane due to their structural complexity and geometry. Therefore, triisopropyl borate is the only molecule among the given choices that exhibits C3h symmetry.

proposed answer: C3h symmetry requires a molecule to have a principal C3 rotational axis and a horizontal mirror plane perpendicular to this axis. Among the given molecules, quinuclidine is a bicyclic amine with an asymmetric, non-planar structure lacking these symmetry elements. The complex fused polycyclic molecules benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone and triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone have multiple fused rings and substituents that disrupt symmetry, making C3h symmetry unlikely. Triisopropyl borate has a boron atom bonded symmetrically to three isopropoxy groups arranged in a trigonal planar geometry, providing a C3 rotational axis and a horizontal mirror plane, fulfilling the criteria for C3h symmetry. Therefore, triisopropyl borate is the only molecule among the choices that exhibits C3h symmetry.

proposed answer: C3h symmetry requires the presence of a principal C3 rotational axis and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to this axis. Among the four molecules, triisopropyl borate has a trigonal planar structure with a boron atom symmetrically bonded to three isopropyl groups, which provides a C3 rotational axis. Additionally, it has a horizontal mirror plane perpendicular to this axis, fulfilling the criteria for C3h symmetry. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic amine with an asymmetric, non-planar structure, lacking both the C3 axis and the horizontal mirror plane. The complex fused polycyclic structures of benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone and triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone disrupt any potential C3 rotational symmetry and horizontal mirror planes due to their asymmetry and complexity, resulting in lower symmetry point groups. Therefore, only triisopropyl borate possesses C3h symmetry because it uniquely combines both the C3 rotational axis and the horizontal mirror plane, unlike the other molecules whose structures prevent such symmetry elements from existing simultaneously.

Triisopropyl borate has a trigonal planar structure with a boron atom bonded symmetrically to three isopropyl groups, which provides the necessary C3 axis. Additionally, the planar arrangement allows for a horizontal mirror plane perpendicular to this axis, fulfilling the C3h symmetry criteria. The other molecules—quinuclidine, benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone, and triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone—have more complex and asymmetric structures lacking either the C3 axis or the horizontal mirror plane, so they do not exhibit C3h symmetry. Therefore, the only molecule among the given choices that has C3h symmetry is triisopropyl borate.
