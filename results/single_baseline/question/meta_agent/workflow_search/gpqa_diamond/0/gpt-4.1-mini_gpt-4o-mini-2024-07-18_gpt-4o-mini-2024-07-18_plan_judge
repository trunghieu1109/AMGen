proposed answer: To determine which molecule exhibits C3h symmetry, we analyze the provided options for the presence of a C3 principal rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane (σh). Quinuclidine has a bicyclic structure that supports a three-fold rotational axis and includes a horizontal mirror plane, confirming its C3h symmetry. In contrast, triisopropyl borate does not possess a C3 axis or a horizontal mirror plane, ruling it out. The other two molecules, benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone and triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone, are complex and do not exhibit the necessary symmetry elements for C3h. Thus, quinuclidine is confirmed to have C3h symmetry, making it the correct choice.

proposed answer: After analyzing the symmetry elements of each molecule, it is clear that quinuclidine is the only molecule that exhibits C3h symmetry. This is because it possesses a three-fold rotational axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh), which are the defining characteristics of C3h symmetry. The other molecules do not have these symmetry elements and therefore do not belong to the C3h point group.
