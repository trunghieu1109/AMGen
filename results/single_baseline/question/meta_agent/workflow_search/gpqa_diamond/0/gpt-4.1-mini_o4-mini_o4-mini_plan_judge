proposed answer: For C₃h symmetry a molecule must have exactly one C₃ principal axis and a single mirror plane σₕ perpendicular to that axis, with no additional C₂ axes or σᵥ planes. Evaluating each choice:

A) Quinuclidine has a C₃ axis through the nitrogen, but its three equivalent CH₂–CH₂–CH₂ bridges are not coplanar and it possesses vertical mirror planes (σᵥ), giving it C₃ᵥ symmetry, not C₃h.

B) Triisopropyl borate (B(O-iPr)₃) has a C₃ axis at boron, but its three isopropoxy groups are staggered out of any common plane, so there is no horizontal mirror plane. It is simply C₃.

C) Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone is a fully planar, highly symmetric D₃ₕ system: it has a C₃ axis and a σₕ plane but also three C₂ axes perpendicular to C₃ and three σᵥ planes. This exceeds C₃h symmetry.

D) Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone has a C₃ axis but its peripheral rings are twisted, so no single horizontal mirror plane. It is therefore only C₃.

None of the four species meets the requirement of exactly one C₃ axis and exactly one perpendicular mirror plane with no further symmetries. Hence, no choice exhibits pure C₃h symmetry.

proposed answer: To exhibit C3h symmetry a molecule must have a single principal C3 rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to that axis, without any extra vertical mirror planes or inversion centers that would elevate its point group beyond C3h. Quinuclidine has C3v symmetry (it features vertical mirror planes but no σh). Triisopropyl borate has only a C3 axis (no σh). Triphenyleno[…]hexaone has D3h symmetry (it contains σh, σv planes, and an inversion center). In contrast, benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone is a strictly planar molecule with its molecular plane serving as σh and a threefold rotation axis perpendicular to that plane, with no additional symmetry elements. This matches exactly the C3h point group.

proposed answer: A strict C3h point group requires exactly one C3 axis and one horizontal mirror plane (σh), with no vertical mirror planes (σv), no additional C2 axes or inversion center. Reviewing each candidate:
1. Quinuclidine is asymmetric (C1).
2. Triisopropyl borate has a C3 axis but its three isopropyl substituents define σv planes rather than a horizontal σh, giving C3v.
3. Both benzo- and triphenyleno-trifuran hexaones are planar with multiple C2 axes and σv planes, placing them in D3h.
None of the four meets the strict C3h criteria without extra symmetry elements. Therefore, no molecule here exhibits C3h symmetry.

Answer:None of the four molecules has C3h symmetry.

proposed answer: To have C3h symmetry, a molecule must possess a single threefold rotation axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh), but no vertical mirror planes (σv). From the symmetry analyses: triisopropyl borate and the triphenyleno-trifuran hexaone derivative both have additional vertical mirror planes (D3h), quinuclidine lacks σh (C3v), whereas benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone has exactly one C3 axis and one horizontal reflection plane, with no vertical mirrors. Thus it uniquely matches the C3h point group.

proposed answer: Subtask 7 requires selecting the molecule with confirmed C3h symmetry. Triisopropyl borate has three identical isopropoxy groups arranged at 120°, giving a C3 axis, and its BO3 plane serves as a horizontal mirror plane (σh). Reflection through any vertical plane fails because the bulky isopropyl groups do not map onto each other, so no σv planes exist. Quinuclidine lacks a C3 axis, and both fused-ring hexaones possess additional σv planes (D3h), not pure C3h. Thus, the only C3h molecule is triisopropyl borate.
