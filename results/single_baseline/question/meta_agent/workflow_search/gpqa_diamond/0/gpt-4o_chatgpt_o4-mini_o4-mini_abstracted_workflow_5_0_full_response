There is no mirror plane or inversion center (the nitrogen lone pair breaks planarity and homonuclear inversion symmetry), so the net symmetry is also C3. 3) The benzo-trifuran hexaone is a fully planar system with three identical furan-1,3-dione units fused symmetrically onto a benzene core. It thus has a three‐fold axis perpendicular to the molecular plane (C3), a horizontal mirror plane in that plane (σh), and three vertical mirror planes (σv) each bisecting one furan and the opposite C–C bond of the benzene.

Triisopropyl borate has three identical isopropoxy groups around a trigonal planar B, giving a single C₃ principal axis and three two‐fold C₂ axes perpendicular to it (no mirror plane through the substituents), i.e. D₃ symmetry.  Quinuclidine’s three identical –CH₂–CH₂– bridges around the nitrogen define a C₃ axis through N and the opposite carbon plus three perpendicular C₂ axes; the cage also has three dihedral σ_d planes and a center of inversion, so the point group is D₃d.

These correspond to choices C and D.; answer: C, D\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent xKiP, round 0, mapping to letter choice, thinking: C3h symmetry requires a C3 principal axis and a horizontal mirror plane. Both the benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone (choice C) and the triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone (choice D) are planar with three identical furan-1,3-dione units arranged evenly around a central ring. This arrangement provides a threefold axis perpendicular to the plane and the molecular plane itself is the σh mirror plane. Thus the correct letter choices are C and D.; answer: C and D\n<SEPERATOR>\nFinal Decision agent, calculating final letter choice, thinking: C3h symmetry requires a principal C3 rotation axis perpendicular to the molecular plane and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) coincident with that plane. Both benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone (choice C) and triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone (choice D) are fully planar fused-ring systems with three identical furan-1,3-dione units symmetrically arranged around a central core, providing the required C3 axis and σh plane.
