Therefore, triisopropyl borate uniquely exhibits the C3h symmetry elements (C3 rotation axis and \u03c3h mirror plane), while the other molecules do not have these symmetry elements.; answer - Triisopropyl borate: C3 rotation axis and horizontal mirror plane (\u03c3h), hence C3h symmetry. Quinuclidine: lacks C3 axis and \u03c3h plane, no C3h symmetry. Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone: complex fused rings and substituents break C3 and \u03c3h symmetry elements. Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone: similarly complex, lacks C3 rotation axis and \u03c3h mirror plane.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - The point group symmetry determination focuses on the presence of a C3 rotational axis and a horizontal mirror plane (\u03c3h), which together define the C3h point group. Triisopropyl borate clearly exhibits these symmetry elements: it has a threefold rotational axis passing through the boron atom and the plane of the three isopropyl groups arranged symmetrically, and a horizontal mirror plane perpendicular to this axis. This combination confirms its C3h symmetry. Quinuclidine, due to its bicyclic and asymmetric structure, lacks a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane, so it does not have C3h symmetry.

While local symmetries might exist in these complex molecules, the overall molecular symmetry does not meet the criteria for C3h. Limitations include the assumption of idealized static structures without considering dynamic distortions or environmental effects that might lower symmetry in practice.

Triisopropyl borate has a trigonal planar structure with a boron atom bonded symmetrically to three isopropyl groups, providing a C3 rotational axis. It also has a horizontal mirror plane perpendicular to this axis, fulfilling the criteria for C3h symmetry.

C3h symmetry includes a C3 principal axis (threefold rotational symmetry) and a horizontal mirror plane (\u03c3h) perpendicular to this axis. Triisopropyl borate consists of a borate center bonded to three isopropyl groups arranged symmetrically, which can give rise to a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane, thus exhibiting C3h symmetry.
