Quinuclidine lacks any C3 axis (C1 symmetry). Triisopropyl borate has C3v (σv’s but no σh). Both hexaones possess additional C2 axes and σv’s, consistent with D3h, not the stricter C3h.

Quinuclidine lacks any C3 axis (C1 symmetry). Triisopropyl borate has C3v (σv’s but no σh). Both hexaones possess additional C2 axes and σv’s, consistent with D3h, not the stricter C3h. All approaches agree: no candidate meets only C3h criteria.; answer: None of the four molecules\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent Gp5k, round 0, selecting C3h molecule, thinking: A strict C3h point group requires a single C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane (σh), but no vertical mirrors, C2 axes, or inversion center. Three independent checks were performed:\n1) Literature assignments: Quinuclidine is C1; triisopropyl borate is C3v (no σh); both hexaones are D3h (they have extra C2 and σv elements beyond C3h). \n2) Computational symmetry analyses reproduce those assignments. \n3) Manual symmetry‐operation enumeration confirms the absence of an isolated C3h pattern in any candidate. \nAll three methods agree that none of the four molecules meets only the C3h criteria without additional symmetry elements.; answer: None of the four molecules has C3h symmetry.\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent zrGJ, round 0, selecting C3h molecule, thinking: To have C3h symmetry, a molecule must have a single C3 axis and one horizontal reflection plane (σh) but lack any vertical σv planes, C2 axes, inversion centers, or other improper axes (except S3 which coincides with the combination of C3 and σh). \n\nReviewing each candidate:\n1. Quinuclidine is a saturated bicyclic amine with no nontrivial rotation axes—it is C1.\n2. Triisopropyl borate features a B(O–iPr)3 trigonal arrangement, but its three isopropyl groups each define a σv plane rather than a σh. It is C3v.\n3. benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone is a planar D3h molecule (it has additional C2 axes and σv planes beyond C3h).\n4. triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone is also D3h.\n\nNone meets the strict C3h criteria by literature survey, computational symmetry analysis, and manual enumeration. Thus no molecule here is C3h.; answer: None\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent MGzN, round 0, selecting C3h molecule, thinking: To satisfy C3h, a molecule must have a single C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane (σh), but no vertical planes (σv), no C2 axes, no S3 improper axes beyond the required, and no inversion center. In Sub-task 4 I used three independent approaches (literature survey, computational symmetry analysis, and manual operation enumeration) and found: quinuclidine is C1; triisopropyl borate is C3v (it has σv planes, not a σh); both benzo- and triphenyleno-trifuran hexaones are actually D3h (they have extra C2 axes and σv planes beyond C3h). None meets the strict C3h criteria.; answer: None of the four molecules has C3h symmetry.\n<SEPERATOR>\nFinal Decision agent, selecting C3h molecule, thinking: A strict C3h point group requires exactly one C3 axis and one horizontal mirror plane (σh), with no vertical mirror planes (σv), no additional C2 axes or inversion center. Reviewing each candidate:\n1. Quinuclidine is asymmetric (C1).\n2. Triisopropyl borate has a C3 axis but its three isopropyl substituents define σv planes rather than a horizontal σh, giving C3v.\n3. Both benzo- and triphenyleno-trifuran hexaones are planar with multiple C2 axes and σv planes, placing them in D3h.\nNone of the four meets the strict C3h criteria without extra symmetry elements. Therefore, no molecule here exhibits C3h symmetry.; answer: None of the four molecules has C3h symmetry.", iteration_idx=-1)]
