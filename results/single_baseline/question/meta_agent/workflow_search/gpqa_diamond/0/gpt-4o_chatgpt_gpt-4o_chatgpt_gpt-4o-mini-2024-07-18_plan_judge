Question: Example(question="which of the following molecules has c3h symmetry?\ntriisopropyl borate\nquinuclidine\nbenzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone\ntriphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone", choice1='quinuclidine', choice2='triisopropyl borate\n', choice3="benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone", choice4="triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone", correct_index=4)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_5_0
proposed answer: All debate agents agree that triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone exhibits C3h symmetry. This molecule has a threefold rotational axis and a horizontal mirror plane, which are the necessary symmetry elements for C3h symmetry. The other molecules do not have these symmetry elements. Therefore, the consensus is that the correct choice is D.

Answer:D
Extracted answer: D
Correct answer: 4
