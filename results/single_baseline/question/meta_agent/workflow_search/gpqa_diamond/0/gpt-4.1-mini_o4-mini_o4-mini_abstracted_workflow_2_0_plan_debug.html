### Subtask 6: Integrate the results from Subtasks 4 and 5 to conclusively determine which molecule(s) exhibit C3h symmetry by confirming presence of C3 and σ_h elements and absence of any σ_v planes. Use a self-consistency approach by performing at least two independent symmetry assessments or a debate-style cross-validation to ensure robustness of the classification. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent xMjR:
To decide which compound(s) truly belong to the C₃h point group, we must confirm they have (1) a 3-fold rotation axis (C₃), (2) a horizontal mirror plane (σₕ) perpendicular to that axis, and (3) absolutely no vertical mirror planes (σᵥ).  

Assessment 1 – Subtasks Review:
• Subtask 4 tested for σᵥ planes and found triisopropyl borate and quinuclidine to have candidate σᵥ, but Subtask 5 corrected that triisopropyl borate’s substituents are arranged in a trigonal-planar fashion with no true σᵥ—only the BO₃ plane as σₕ. Quinuclidine lacks any 3-fold axis. The two fused-ring hexaones each have 3-fold axes and a σₕ but also possess three σᵥ planes (D₃h).  

Assessment 2 – Debate-Style Cross-Check:
Agent A: “Triisopropyl borate has identical isopropoxy groups at 120°—so C₃ and C₃² exist—and the B–O plane is σₕ. Even though one might imagine σᵥ through B–O–C, reflection fails because isopropyl groups aren’t linear substituents; they do not map perfectly, so no σᵥ.”
Agent B: “The trifuran hexaones likewise have C₃ and σₕ, but each of their furan rings is planar and identical, so every plane through the C₃ axis bisecting one ring is a σᵥ—confirming D₃h, not pure C₃h.”
Agent A: “And quinuclidine has no set of three equivalent groups at 120°, so no C₃ or σₕ.”

Both lines lead to a single molecule meeting exactly C₃h (E, C₃, C₃², σₕ) and no σᵥ: triisopropyl borate.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent xMjR:
Triisopropyl borate

Given the above, answer the following question: Subtask 7: Select the molecule(s) with confirmed C3h symmetry from the given choices and provide the final answer strictly in the required multiple-choice format (A, B, C, or D), supported by a concise summary of the symmetry analysis.

    <pre>Subtask 7 requires selecting the molecule with confirmed C3h symmetry. Triisopropyl borate has three identical isopropoxy groups arranged at 120°, giving a C3 axis, and its BO3 plane serves as a horizontal mirror plane (σh). Reflection through any vertical plane fails because the bulky isopropyl groups do not map onto each other, so no σv planes exist. Quinuclidine lacks a C3 axis, and both fused-ring hexaones possess additional σv planes (D3h), not pure C3h. Thus, the only C3h molecule is triisopropyl borate.
