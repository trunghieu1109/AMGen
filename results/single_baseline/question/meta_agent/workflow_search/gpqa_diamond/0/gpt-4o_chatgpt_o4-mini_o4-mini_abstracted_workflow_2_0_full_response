Triisopropyl borate has a C3 axis but lacks a σh plane. Quinuclidine is essentially C1. The benzo- and triphenyleno-trifuran hexaones are planar aromatic systems with C3 and σh but also possess three in-plane C2 axes and three σv planes, giving D3h symmetry rather than pure C3h.

Triisopropyl borate B(OiPr)3. In an idealized conformation (all three isopropyl groups eclipsed about the B–O bonds), the molecule has D3h symmetry: a C3 principal axis through B and perpendicular to the O3 plane; three C2 axes in that plane; a horizontal mirror plane σh (the O3 plane); and three vertical mirror planes σv. In reality, steric repulsion favors a staggered arrangement of the isopropyl groups, lowering the symmetry to C3: only the threefold rotation axis remains (no σh or C2 axes, and no σv).\n\n2. Quinuclidine (bicyclo[2.2.2]octane with a bridgehead N). The low‐energy chairlike conformation is nearly perfectly symmetric: it belongs to C3v. There is a C3 axis running through the nitrogen and the carbon opposite; and three vertical σv planes each bisect a C–N–C angle. There is no σh or C2 perpendicular to the C3, so C3v holds both ideally and at equilibrium.\n\n3.

Both in an idealized and in the real planar geometry the molecule has D3h symmetry: one C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane; three C2 axes in the plane; a σh plane (the molecular plane); and three σv planes.\n\n4. Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone: the triphenylene core plus three identical furan-2-one rings is also a planar D3h system in both ideal and equilibrium structures, with the same set of symmetry elements as in (3).; answer: 1. Triisopropyl borate: idealized D3h; equilibrium C3. 2. Quinuclidine: C3v (ideal and equilibrium). 3. Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c:5,6-c'']trifuran-hexaone: D3h (ideal and equilibrium). 4. Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-hexaone: D3h (ideal and equilibrium).\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent MHjR, determining symmetry elements, thinking: We must assign symmetry elements for each molecule in both idealized (eclipsed or hypothetical high-symmetry) and realistic equilibrium conformations. Triisopropyl borate has a trigonal planar B center: if all three isopropyl groups were locked in an eclipsed arrangement, the molecule would be D3h (E, 2 C3 about the B–O axis, 3 C2 through B and midpoints of O–C, a horizontal σh through the O atoms, 3 σv through each O–C arm, plus S3 operations). In its real, staggered lowest-energy state, the O–C–C–H torsions break the C2 and mirror planes, leaving only the principal C3 (point group C3). Quinuclidine is a bicyclic tertiary amine with a pyramidal N: its equilibrium geometry is C3v (one C3 through N and the opposite CH2 bridge, three σv bisecting each CH2CH2 bridge). A hypothetical planar N would raise it to D3h, but that conformation is not observed. Both benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c:5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone and triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone are fully planar fused-ring systems with identical substituents at 120° intervals. In both idealized and real planar forms they belong to D3h: a C3 axis perpendicular to the plane, three in-plane C2 axes through opposite ring atoms, a σh (the molecular plane), three σv, and the associated S3 operations.; answer: Triisopropyl borate: idealized eclipsed D3h (E, 2 C3, 3 C2, σh, 3 σv, 2 S3); equilibrium staggered C3 (only the threefold axis remains). Quinuclidine: equilibrium C3v (one C3 through N, three σv bisecting each CH2CH2 bridge); planar D3h only in a hypothetical conformation. Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c:5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone: D3h (E, 2 C3, 3 C2, σh, 3 σv, S3) in both idealized and real planar conformations.

Looking at each: 1) Triisopropyl borate in its idealized eclipsed form has only a C3 axis and no σh (the isopropyl groups are not coplanar), so it is C3 not C3h. 2) Quinuclidine has no C3 in its true structure (C1). 3) The two trifuran-hexaone compounds are fully planar and have a C3 axis plus σh but also three C2 axes and three σv planes—point group D3h rather than C3h. Hence none of the molecules meets the strict requirement of exactly one C3 and one σh with no additional symmetry elements.; answer: None of the given molecules possesses C3h symmetry.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCritic agent Vr9h, providing feedback, thinking: The evaluation correctly identifies that none of the candidates strictly meets C3h (one C3 plus one σh only), but it assumes idealized, static geometries without considering conformational flexibility and real‐world distortions. For example, triisopropyl borate can adopt conformers with a horizontal mirror plane in certain eclipsed arrangements, and the planar trifuran hexaones may lose or distort some σv/C2 elements when substituted, reducing D3h to possibly C3h under strain. A full analysis should include conformer energetics, dynamic averaging, and potential asymmetries introduced by substituents.; answer: None of the given molecules possesses C3h symmetry.\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent DQVo, refining C3h symmetry evaluation, thinking: C3h requires exactly one C3 axis and a single horizontal mirror plane (σh), with no additional C2 axes or σv planes.\n\n1) Triisopropyl borate (idealized eclipsed):\n   - Has a C3 axis through boron and the three O–iPr groups.\n   - No σh exists because the isopropyl groups are not all coplanar; any mirror plane would bisect substituents unevenly.\n   - Therefore point group is C3, not C3h.\n\n2) Quinuclidine:\n   - In reality its geometry is C1 (no C3).\n   - Even an idealized D3d assignment treats N and C bridgeheads as equivalent—a purely theoretical model that still includes inversion and C2 axes, not a lone σh.\n   - So it cannot be C3h.\n\n3) Benzo- and triphenyleno-trifuran hexaones:\n   - Both are planar with a C3 axis perpendicular to the ring plane and a σh (the molecular plane).\n   - However, they also have three in‐plane C2 axes and three vertical σv planes, thus D3h overall.\n   - Breaking those extra symmetries (e.g. by distortion) would also disrupt either the C3 axis or the σh, so true C3h cannot be isolated.\n\nConclusion: None of the four molecules meets the strict C3h criteria of exactly one C3 and one σh with no other symmetry elements.; answer: None of the given molecules possesses C3h symmetry.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT agent 2cpG, selecting C3h symmetry molecules, thinking: C3h symmetry requires exactly one C3 axis and one horizontal mirror plane σh, with no additional C2 axes or σv planes.
