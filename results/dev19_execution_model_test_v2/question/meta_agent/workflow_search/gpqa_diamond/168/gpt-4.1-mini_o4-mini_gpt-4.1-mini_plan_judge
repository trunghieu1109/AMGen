Question: Example(question='You are studying a nuclear decay which converts two heavy nucleons of flavor A to another flavor B, while simultaneously emitting two much lighter particles E and V. In short, 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V. It is known that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous, with some endpoint value Q.\n\nA variant of this decay emits one exotic, massless particle M instead of the 2V. In this case, how does the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles compare to that of the original decay?', choice1='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint increases.', choice2='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases.', choice3='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.', choice4='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint decreases.', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: Step 1: Define masses and Q-values
• Let m_A,m_B,m_E,m_V be the rest masses of A,B,E,V; M is massless (m_M=0).
• Initial rest‐energy: E_i=2m_Ac^2.
• Original final rest‐energy: E_f_orig=2m_Bc^2+2m_Ec^2+2m_Vc^2.
• Available kinetic energy originally: Q=E_i–E_f_orig=2m_Ac^2–(2m_B+2m_E+2m_V)c^2.

Step 2: Compute variant available energy
• Variant final rest‐energy: E_f_var=2m_Bc^2+2m_Ec^2.
• Available kinetic energy in variant: Q'=E_i–E_f_var=2m_Ac^2–(2m_B+2m_E)c^2=Q+2m_Vc^2.
• Hence Q'>Q by exactly the rest‐mass energy of the two V’s removed.

Step 3: Continuity of the spectrum
• A single‐particle energy spectrum is discrete only in a strict two‐body decay (fixed kinematics).
• Original decay has four light particles (2E+2V), i.e. a 6‐body final state including 2B, so the E spectrum is a continuous projection of a multi‐body phase space.
• Variant decay has three light particles (2E+M), still more than two, so the E spectrum remains continuous.

Step 4: Endpoint shift
• The maximum total energy carried by the two E’s occurs when the other particles carry minimal kinetic energy allowed by momentum conservation.
• Since the total kinetic energy increased from Q to Q'=Q+2m_Vc^2, the maximum energy sum for the two E’s increases by 2m_Vc^2, so the endpoint shifts upward.

Step 5: Shape adjustment
• Reducing the number of light particles from four to three alters the phase‐space density, making the spectrum somewhat harder near the endpoint, but does not introduce discrete lines.

Conclusion: The variant decay 2A→2B+2E+M yields a continuous energy spectrum for E with an increased endpoint (Q′>Q).
