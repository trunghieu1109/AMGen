Question: Example(question='A chemist performs two reactions:\n\nReaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. \n\nReaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.\n\nBoth reactions go to 100% completion. The chemist combines the products of both reactions, and then runs the product mixture on both a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column and a chiral HPLC column.\n\nAssuming that the chromatographic resolution is as high as theoretically possible in both cases, what does the chemist observe in each of these chromatograms?', choice1='4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', choice2='3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice3='2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice4='2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: Step 1: Identify products from each alkene
a) Epoxidation of (E)-oct-4-ene (trans alkene) with mCPBA is a concerted syn addition, giving a trans-epoxide. Each epoxide carbon bears different substituents (propyl vs. butyl), so the trans-epoxide lacks an internal mirror plane and is a chiral molecule. Without chiral induction, it is formed as a racemic mixture of two enantiomers.
b) Epoxidation of (Z)-oct-4-ene (cis alkene) gives a cis-epoxide by syn addition. In this case each epoxide carbon again bears propyl and butyl, but the overall epoxide has an internal mirror plane, making it a meso (achiral) compound. Only one stereoisomer results.

Step 2: Composition of the combined mixture
– Two enantiomers (R,R and S,S) of the trans-epoxide from the E-alkene
– One meso (R,S) cis-epoxide from the Z-alkene
Total = 3 stereoisomers: a racemic pair + a meso compound.

Step 3: Behavior on a chiral HPLC column
– Chiral stationary phases resolve enantiomers into separate peaks.
– The meso epoxide, being achiral, gives a single peak.
– Therefore, the two trans-epoxide enantiomers appear as two distinct peaks and the meso epoxide appears as one peak.

Conclusion: On a chiral HPLC column under ideal resolution, three baseline-separated peaks are observed.
