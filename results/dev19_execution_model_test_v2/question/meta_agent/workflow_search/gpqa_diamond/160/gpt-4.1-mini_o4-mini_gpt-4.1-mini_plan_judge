Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_51_160
proposed answer: 1. λ1 is the gas‐molecule mean free path under UHV (P<10⁻⁹ Torr), given by λ1=1/(√2·n·π·d²) where n is molecular density and d is molecular diameter.  
2. When the 1000 kV electron beam is on, electrons scatter off residual gas molecules with cross section σ_e–gas, which is orders of magnitude smaller than the gas–gas collision cross section σ_g–g≈π·d². Thus the electron mean free path λs=1/(n·σ_e–gas)≫λ1.  
3. In electron‐optical measurements one uses the transport mean free path λtr=λs/(1–⟨cosθ⟩) to account for scattering angles. High‐energy electrons scatter strongly forward, with ⟨cosθ⟩≈0.18–0.2 at MeV energies, yielding 1/(1–⟨cosθ⟩)≈1.22 at most.  
4. Hence the effective electron mean free path λ2 satisfies λ1<λ2<1.22·λ1.  
5. Among the provided choices, only B) matches λ1<λ2<1.22·λ1.

proposed answer: 1. Define λ1 and λ2 in terms of scattering cross sections:
   - λ1 is the mean free path for gas–gas collisions: λ1 = 1/(n·σ_g–g).
   - λ2 is the mean free path for electrons scattering off gas molecules: λ2 = 1/(n·σ_e–gas).

2. Compare typical cross sections:
   - For diatomic gas molecules in UHV, σ_g–g ≈ 3×10^−19 m^2.
   - For 1 MeV electrons scattering from the same gas, σ_e–gas ≈ 10^−23 to 10^−22 m^2.
   - Therefore σ_g–g/σ_e–gas ≈ 10^4 to 10^5.

3. Implications for mean free paths:
   - λ2/λ1 = σ_g–g/σ_e–gas ≈ 10^4–10^5, so λ2 is orders of magnitude larger than λ1.

4. Evaluate the choices:
   A) λ2 = λ1 requires σ_e–gas = σ_g–g, contradicting σ_g–g ≫ σ_e–gas.
   C) λ2 < λ1 implies σ_e–gas > σ_g–g, also false.
   B) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22·λ1 caps λ2 at a mere 22% increase, but we have λ2/λ1 ≫ 1.22.
   D) λ2 ≥ 1.22·λ1 is the only choice consistent with λ2 ≫ λ1, and the 1.22 factor is only a small transport correction, not an upper bound.

5. Conclusion: The vast difference in cross sections guarantees λ2 far exceeds λ1, so the correct relation is λ2 ≥ 1.22·λ1.
