Extract and Summarize Given Information:\n- Two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2.\n- Orbital periods (time between consecutive primary eclipses): system_1 has 2 years, system_2 has 1 year.\n- Radial velocity (RV) sinusoidal amplitude observations:\n  * system_1: 10 km/s and 5 km/s for the two stars.\n  * system_2: 15 km/s and 10 km/s for the two stars.\n- The mass of each system is defined as the sum of the masses of its two stars.\n\n2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:\n- The orbital period relates to the total mass of the binary system via Kepler\'s third law.\n- Radial velocity amplitudes correspond to the orbital velocities of each star around the center of mass, which depend on the mass ratio and orbital parameters.\n- The ratio of the RV amplitudes inversely relates to the mass ratio of the two stars in each system.\n- The periods and velocity amplitudes together provide information to estimate the total mass of each system.\n- Constraints such as sinusoidal RV variations imply circular or near-circular orbits.\n\n3.

Thus the ratio M1/M2 = [P1\u2009(K1_1+K1_2)^3]\u2009/\u2009[P2\u2009(K2_1+K2_2)^3]. Here P1=2\u2009yr, P2=1\u2009yr, (K1_1+K1_2)=10+5=15\u2009km/s, (K2_1+K2_2)=15+10=25\u2009km/s. So M1/M2 = 2\u2009×\u200915^3\u2009/\u2009(1\u2009×\u200925^3) = 2×3375\u2009/\u200915625 = 6750\u2009/\u200915625 ≃ 0.432.

For a circular, edge‐on orbit, each star’s semimajor axis a_i = (K_i\u2009P)/(2π), where K_i is its RV amplitude. Thus the total semimajor axis a = a_1 + a_2 = (P/(2π))(K_1+K_2). Substituting into Kepler’s law gives M_tot ∝ [(P(K_1+K_2))^3/(2π)^3]/P^2 ∝ P(K_1+K_2)^3 (constant factors cancel in the ratio).

For circular motion, each star’s projected orbital velocity amplitude is K_i=2π\u2009a_i/P, where a_i is its orbital radius about the center of mass.  \n2. Thus a1=P\u2009K1/(2π) and a2=P\u2009K2/(2π).  The total separation is a=a1+a2=P\u2009(K1+K2)/(2π).  \n3.
