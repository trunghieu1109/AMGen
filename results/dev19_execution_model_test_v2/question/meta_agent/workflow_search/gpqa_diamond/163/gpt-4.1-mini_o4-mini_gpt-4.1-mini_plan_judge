Question: Example(question='Astronomers are studying two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2. Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.', choice1='~ 0.4', choice2='~ 0.7', choice3='~ 0.6\n', choice4='~ 1.2', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: 1. For double‐lined spectroscopic eclipsing binaries with circular, edge‐on orbits, the total mass M_tot obeys Kepler’s third law combined with RV amplitudes as M_tot ∝ P⋅(K₁+K₂)³, where P is the orbital period and K₁+K₂ is the sum of the radial‐velocity semi‐amplitudes. 2. Thus the ratio of total masses is
   M₁/M₂ = (P₁/P₂) × [(K₁+K₂)₁/(K₁+K₂)₂]³. 3. From the data:
   P₁ = 2 yr, P₂ = 1 yr;
   (K₁+K₂)₁ = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s;
   (K₁+K₂)₂ = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s. 4. Compute the ratio:
   M₁/M₂ = (2/1) × (15/25)³ = 2 × (0.6)³ = 2 × 0.216 = 0.432. 5. Comparing 0.432 to the provided options (~0.4, ~0.7, ~0.6, ~1.2), the closest is ~0.4. Therefore the correct choice is A).
