Question: Example(question='The Mott-Gurney equation describes the dark current (J) versus voltage (V) behavior of a semiconductor device in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. The equation can be expressed as\n$ J = \\frac{9}{8} \\epsilon \\mu \\frac{V^2}{L^3}$\nwhere $\\epsilon$ is the dielectric constant, $\\mu$ is the charge carrier mobility, and L is the length of the device. Which of the following statements is true about the validity of this equation?\n', choice1='The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.', choice2='The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.', choice3='The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.', choice4='The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: The Mott–Gurney law J=(9/8)εμV²/L³ applies under four core assumptions: 1) trap-free medium (no charge traps impede transport), 2) single-carrier conduction (only electrons or holes dominate), 3) Ohmic contacts (no injection barrier so space charge, not contact resistance, limits current), and 4) drift-dominated transport (diffusion current is negligible). Evaluate each choice:

A) “Trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.”
   • Trap-free ✔ (no traps)
   • Single-carrier ✔ (one carrier type)
   • No injection barrier ⇒ Ohmic contact ✔
   • Negligible diffusion ⇒ drift-dominated ✔
   ⇒ Satisfies all four assumptions.

B) “Trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.”
   • Negligible drift ✘ contradicts drift-dominated requirement.

C) “Two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.”
   • Two-carrier ✘ violates single-carrier assumption.

D) “Single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.”
   • Schottky contact ✘ has an injection barrier, violating Ohmic requirement.

Only choice A meets every prerequisite for the Mott–Gurney equation to be valid.
