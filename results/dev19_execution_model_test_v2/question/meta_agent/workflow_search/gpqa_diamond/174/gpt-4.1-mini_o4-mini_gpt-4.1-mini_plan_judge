proposed answer: We model the oscillating spheroidal charge distribution as an effective electric dipole along the z-axis. In the far field: 1) Angular dependence: dipole radiation intensity I(θ) ∝ sin²θ. The maximum A occurs at θ=90° (sin²90°=1). At θ=30°, sin30°=1/2 so sin²30°=1/4, giving a fraction of A equal to 1/4. 2) Wavelength dependence: the radiated power ∝|p̈|², and for a dipole oscillating at angular frequency ω, p̈∝ω² so I∝ω⁴. Since ω=2πc/λ, we have ω⁴∝λ⁻⁴. Thus the general form is f(λ,θ)=constant·λ⁻⁴·sin²θ. Among the choices, only option C matches both the fraction 1/4 at θ=30° and the λ⁻⁴ dependence.

proposed answer: 1. The spheroidal charge distribution is symmetric under inversion (z→–z) with no net dipole moment, so the leading time‐varying multipole is the electric quadrupole (l=2).
2. General multipole scaling: an oscillating multipole of order l radiates power P ∝ ω^(2l+2). For l=2 (quadrupole), P ∝ ω^6.
3. Since ω = 2πc/λ, the wavelength dependence is P ∝ λ^(-6).
4. The angular distribution for an axisymmetric electric quadrupole aligned along the z‐axis is P(θ) ∝ (sinθ·cosθ)^2.
5. The maximum of (sinθ·cosθ)^2 occurs at θ = 45°, giving (sin45°·cos45°)^2 = (√2/2·√2/2)^2 = 1/4. Denote this peak power per unit solid angle as A.
6. At θ = 30°: sin30° = 1/2, cos30° = √3/2, so (sin30°·cos30°)^2 = (1/2·√3/2)^2 = 3/16.
7. The fraction of the peak A at θ = 30° is (3/16) ÷ (1/4) = (3/16)·4 = 3/4.
8. Thus the radiated power per unit solid angle can be written as f(λ,θ) = const·λ^(-6)(sinθ·cosθ)^2, and the fraction of A at θ = 30° is 3/4.
9. Among the provided options, only choice B) matches both 3/4 and λ^(-6).
