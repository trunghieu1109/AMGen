Question: Example(question='In an industrial research lab, a scientist performs ethylene polymerization with a homogeneous organometallic catalyst system, generating a polymer of high density. He intends to add a second catalyst system to introduce regular branches in the polymer backbone, also only using ethylene as the reactant. He consults a senior scientist, who gives the following statements. “Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US. One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators. Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step. Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.”\nWhich of these four statements is correct regarding the formation of a polymer with regular branches using only ethylene as the monomer and a dual catalyst system?', choice1='Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.', choice2='Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.', choice3='One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.', choice4='Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: Step 1: Understand the task. We must pick which single statement (A–D) correctly describes how to form regularly branched polyethylene from pure ethylene using a dual homogeneous catalyst system.

Step 2: Evaluate each statement in turn.

Statement A: “Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.”
– Reality: Industrial branching from pure ethylene uses either heterogeneous catalysts or copolymerization with α-olefins, not a purely homogeneous dual‐catalyst, ethylene-only process. No commercial plant runs the claimed homogeneous dual system. 
– Conclusion: A is false.

Statement B: “Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.”
– Chemistry: Al-based activators (e.g. MAO) can generate active catalysts for linear polymerization but fail to produce the chain-walking or oligomerization species needed for regular branching in a second catalyst. This limitation is real. 
– But the question asks which statement correctly describes the method to form the branched polymer, not a side constraint. 
– Conclusion: B is true as a caveat but not the main enabling strategy.

Statement C: “One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.”
– Proven approach: Molybdenum or tungsten complexes activated by non-aluminum cocatalysts (e.g. perfluoroaryl borates) effect ethylene oligomerization or chain walking, generating in situ branches, and when combined with a polyethylene polymerization catalyst yield regularly branched polyethene from pure ethylene. Demonstrated at pilot scale. 
– This directly states the dual‐catalyst solution fulfilling the problem’s requirements.
– Conclusion: C is correct.

Statement D: “Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.”
– Fact: Late‐metal chain-walking catalysts (Pd, Pt) can introduce branches but their cost and scarcity make them impractical. 
– Again, this describes an alternative that works but is not the recommended industrial method. 
– Conclusion: D is true in isolation but not the key answer to the question.

Step 3: Choose the one statement that both correctly describes and positively identifies the proven dual‐catalyst method for regularly branching polyethylene from pure ethylene. That is statement C.

Therefore, the correct answer is C).
