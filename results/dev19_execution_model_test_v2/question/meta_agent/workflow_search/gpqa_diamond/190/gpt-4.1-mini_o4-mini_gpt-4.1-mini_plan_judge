proposed answer: Step 1: Benzylation of the primary alcohol. Starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Treatment with NaH deprotonates the –CH2OH at C3. Reaction with benzyl bromide replaces the H with a benzyl group, giving a benzyl ether: 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.

Step 2: Tosylhydrazone formation. p-Toluenesulfonyl hydrazide condenses with the C1 ketone, forming the tosylhydrazone at C1. The benzyloxymethyl ether and the isopropenyl side chain remain unchanged.

Step 3: Shapiro elimination (n-BuLi). Treatment of the tosylhydrazone with n-BuLi at low temperature generates a vinyllithium intermediate, expels N2 and the tosyl group, and yields an alkene between C1 and C2: 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.

Step 4: Catalytic hydrogenation (H2, Pd/C). Three transformations occur simultaneously: 1) Hydrogenation of the ring C1–C2 double bond to give a saturated cyclohexane. 2) Hydrogenation of the exocyclic prop-1-en-2-yl (isopropenyl) group to isopropyl (–CH(CH3)2). 3) Hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether, cleaving the O–CH2Ph bond and regenerating the free primary alcohol at C3.

Final structure: A cyclohexane bearing a hydroxymethyl substituent (–CH2OH) at C1 and an isopropyl substituent at C3. Numbering the ring so that the –CH2OH is C1 places the isopropyl at C3, giving (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol, which matches choice A.
