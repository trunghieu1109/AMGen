Question: Example(question="If uncertainty in space of electron's location, which is travelling with speed v= 2* 10^8 m/s along x-direction is Δx=0.1 nm . Based on the infromation estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of electron.", choice1='~10^(-19) J', choice2='~10^(-18) J', choice3='~10^(-16) J', choice4='~10^(-17) J', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: 1. We want the minimum uncertainty in the electron’s energy ΔE given Δx=0.1 nm and v=2×10^8 m/s.  
2. By the one‐dimensional Heisenberg principle: Δx·Δp ≥ ħ/2. For the minimum case, Δp = ħ/(2Δx).  
   • ħ = 1.055×10^−34 J·s, Δx = 1.0×10^−10 m  
   • Δp ≈ (1.055×10^−34)/(2×1.0×10^−10) ≈ 5.28×10^−25 kg·m/s  
3. To relate Δp to ΔE, use ΔE ≈ (dE/dp)·Δp. Both nonrelativistic and relativistic formulas give dE/dp = v exactly, even for v/c≈0.67, because d/dp(√(p^2c^2 + m^2c^4)) = pc^2/E = v.  
4. Therefore ΔE ≈ v·Δp = (2.0×10^8 m/s)·(5.28×10^−25 kg·m/s) ≈ 1.06×10^−16 J.  
5. Comparing to the provided options (~10^−19, 10^−18, 10^−16, 10^−17 J), the value 1.06×10^−16 J is closest to 10^−16 J, which is choice C).
