Question: Example(question='We would like to dissolve (at 25°С) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm3 total volume. What is the minimum volume (cm3) of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution and what is the pH of the resulting solution?', choice1='pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3', choice2='pH 2.69; 30.09 cm3', choice3='pH 3.16; 32.14 cm3', choice4='pH 4.94; 20.40 cm3', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_14_162
proposed answer: 1. Calculate moles of Fe(OH)₃: M = 55.85 + 3×(16.00 + 1.01) = 106.88 g/mol, so n = 0.100 g / 106.88 g/mol = 9.36×10⁻⁴ mol.
2. Dissolution stoichiometry: Fe(OH)₃ + 3H⁺ → Fe³⁺ + 3H₂O requires 3 mol H⁺ per mol Fe(OH)₃, so n_H⁺ = 3 × 9.36×10⁻⁴ = 2.81×10⁻³ mol.
3. Volume of 0.1 M acid: V = n_H⁺ / 0.1 M = 2.81×10⁻³ mol / 0.1 mol·L⁻¹ = 0.0281 L = 28.05 cm³.
4. After neutralization, [Fe³⁺] = 9.36×10⁻⁴ mol / 0.100 L = 9.36×10⁻³ M.
5. Fe³⁺ hydrolyzes: Fe³⁺ + H₂O ⇌ FeOH²⁺ + H⁺ with Ka₁ ≈ 6.3×10⁻³. Let x = [H⁺]; Ka₁ = x²/(c₀ − x) with c₀ = 9.36×10⁻³. Solving gives x ≈ 9.12×10⁻³ M ⇒ pH = −log x ≈ 2.04.
6. The computed volume (28.05 cm³) and pH (2.04) match choice A) exactly. No other option fits both values.

proposed answer: 1. Compute moles of Fe(OH)3: M(Fe(OH)3)=55.85+3×17.01=106.88 g/mol; n=0.100 g/106.88 g/mol=9.36×10⁻⁴ mol.
2. Reaction stoichiometry: Fe(OH)3 + 3H⁺ → Fe³⁺ + 3H2O. H⁺ needed = 3×9.36×10⁻⁴ = 2.808×10⁻³ mol.
3. Volume of 0.1 M acid: V = n/C = 2.808×10⁻³ mol / 0.100 M = 0.02808 L = 28.08 cm³. Only choice A has ≈28.05 cm³.
4. After dissolution and dilution to 100 cm³, no excess strong acid remains; [Fe³⁺] = 9.36×10⁻⁴ mol / 0.100 L = 9.36×10⁻³ M.
5. Fe³⁺ hydrolyzes: Fe³⁺ + H₂O ⇌ FeOH²⁺ + H⁺; K₁ = 10^(–2.20) = 6.31×10⁻³.
   Let x = [H⁺] from hydrolysis: x²/(9.36×10⁻³ – x) = 6.31×10⁻³ ⇒ x ≈ 5.16×10⁻³ M ⇒ pH ≈ 2.29.
6. No answer choice lists pH ≈2.29; closest is A’s pH 2.04 (ΔpH≈0.25). Other choices differ more in volume and/or pH.
7. Thus, although A’s pH is lower than the calculated value, it best matches the acid volume requirement and is the nearest pH among options.
