Magnon: Quasiparticle from collective spin-wave excitations in a magnetically ordered material. Ferromagnetic order arises from spontaneous breaking of spin-rotational symmetry, and magnons are the associated Nambu–Goldstone bosons.\n\n2.

Skyrmion: A topological soliton solution in certain non-linear field theories (e.g., in magnets or nuclear physics). While it requires a broken symmetry background to exist, it is not itself a Nambu–Goldstone boson arising from spontaneous symmetry breaking; it is a stable topological excitation rather than a mode of a broken continuous symmetry.\n\nThus the one not directly associated as a Nambu–Goldstone boson of a spontaneously broken continuous symmetry is the skyrmion.; answer: B)\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent UkQx, round 0, thinking: We need to summarize the defining physical characteristics and symmetry-related properties of each effective particle:\n\n1. Magnon: A quantized spin-wave excitation in a magnetically ordered lattice. When a ferromagnet or antiferromagnet undergoes spontaneous breaking of its continuous spin-rotational symmetry (e.g., SU(2) down to U(1)), low-energy Goldstone modes appear. These are magnons, carrying spin-1 and dispersing at low momenta with energy proportional to k (or k^2 in some antiferromagnets).\n\n2. Skyrmion: A topologically stable soliton configuration in a field theory or condensed-matter system (e.g., magnetic systems). Skyrmions are characterized by a nonzero topological winding number but are not themselves Nambu–Goldstone bosons of any broken continuous symmetry. Their stability arises from topology rather than spontaneously broken symmetry.\n\n3. Pion: In quantum chromodynamics (QCD), approximate chiral SU(2)_L×SU(2)_R symmetry is spontaneously broken to the diagonal SU(2)_V (isospin) subgroup. The three resulting Goldstone bosons are the pions (π^+, π^0, π^-), light relative to other hadrons. They carry isospin-1 and are pseudoscalar mesons.\n\n4. Phonon: A quantized normal mode of lattice vibrations in a crystal. The discrete lattice structure breaks continuous translational symmetry explicitly, but in the long-wavelength limit one treats acoustic phonons as Goldstone modes of spontaneously broken continuous translation invariance. Thus acoustic phonons appear due to emergent spontaneous symmetry breaking of continuous translations in the effective continuum description.\n\nComparing these, magnons, pions, and acoustic phonons are Nambu–Goldstone modes arising from spontaneously broken continuous symmetries (spin rotation, chiral, translation respectively). Skyrmions, being topological solitons, are not themselves Goldstone excitations of a broken symmetry.Therefore the particle not associated with spontaneously-broken symmetry is the Skyrmion.; answer: B)\n<SEPERATOR>\nFinal Decision agent, thinking: We examine each effective particle’s relation to spontaneous symmetry breaking:\n\n1.

Magnon: In a ferromagnet or antiferromagnet, the microscopic Hamiltonian has continuous spin‐rotation symmetry (SU(2)). When the system orders magnetically, this symmetry is spontaneously broken (e.g. SU(2)→U(1)), and the resulting gapless spin‐wave excitations are the Nambu–Goldstone modes. The quanta of these modes are magnons, so magnons arise from spontaneous symmetry breaking.\n\n2. Pion: In quantum chromodynamics with (approximately) massless up and down quarks, there is an approximate global chiral symmetry SU(2)_L×SU(2)_R. The QCD vacuum spontaneously breaks this down to the diagonal isospin SU(2)_V, producing three Goldstone bosons. These are identified with the pions (π^+, π^0, π^-), which become pseudo‐Goldstone bosons when quark masses introduce explicit breaking.\n\n3. Phonon: In a crystal, the formation of a periodic lattice spontaneously breaks the continuous translational symmetry of space down to a discrete subgroup. According to Goldstone’s theorem, the long‐wavelength acoustic phonons are the gapless modes associated with this broken continuous translation symmetry, making phonons Nambu–Goldstone bosons in this context.\n\n4. Skyrmion: A skyrmion is a localized topological soliton carrying a nonzero winding number in a nonlinear field theory. Its stability is guaranteed by topology (a nontrivial homotopy class), not by small fluctuations around a symmetric vacuum. Skyrmions are finite‐energy topological defects or solitons rather than Goldstone modes of any spontaneously broken continuous symmetry.\n\nConclusion: Magnons, pions, and phonons are all Nambu–Goldstone (or pseudo‐Goldstone) modes arising from spontaneously broken continuous symmetries, whereas skyrmions are topological solitons not tied to Goldstone’s theorem. Thus, the skyrmion is the only one not associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking.; answer: B)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent KYfg, thinking: We examine each effective particle in turn and determine whether it arises as a Nambu–Goldstone mode of a spontaneously broken continuous symmetry:\n\n1.

Phonons: Treating crystal lattice vibrations as Goldstone modes assumes strictly continuous translational symmetry breaking, whereas a real solid only has a discrete lattice subgroup. That nuance can affect whether phonons are viewed as true NG bosons or as pseudo-NG modes.\n2. Skyrmions: Although they are not gapless Goldstone excitations themselves, their existence does depend on an underlying symmetry-broken order parameter (e.g.\\/ ferromagnetic or chiral field backgrounds). The solution could clarify that skyrmions are topological solitons in a broken-symmetry phase, not fundamental excitations of an unbroken vacuum.\n3. Pions: Their NG status is only approximate due to explicit chiral symmetry breaking from finite quark masses, which gives them a small mass.\nOverall, these issues do not invalidate the identification of the skyrmion as the exception, but they highlight that “association with spontaneous symmetry breaking” can have grey areas.; correct: True\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent TYJ8, round 0, thinking: Spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) produces gapless Nambu–Goldstone (NG) modes whenever a continuous symmetry of the system’s laws is not respected by its ground state. We check each candidate:\n\n1. Magnon: In a ferromagnet the global spin-rotation symmetry SU(2) is spontaneously broken down to U(1). The resulting spin-wave excitations (magnons) are NG bosons.\n\n2. Pion: In quantum chromodynamics the approximate chiral symmetry SU(2)L×SU(2)R is spontaneously broken to SU(2)V. Pions emerge as (pseudo)-NG bosons of this breaking.\n\n3. Phonon: In a crystal the continuous translational symmetry is spontaneously broken by the lattice, yielding acoustic phonons as NG modes of the broken translation symmetry.\n\n4. Skyrmion: Although skyrmions appear in systems with broken symmetry, they are topological solitons—localized, stable field configurations characterized by a winding number. They are not gapless fluctuations (NG modes) of the vacuum but rather massive, nonperturbative objects whose stability is due to topology rather than the Goldstone mechanism.\n\nThus, the only item not associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking in the NG sense is the skyrmion.; answer: B)\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent 7FCg, round 0, thinking: We must identify which of the four effective particles is not an emergent Nambu–Goldstone mode arising from spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry. 1) Magnons: In a magnetically ordered ferromagnet, the SU(2) spin rotation symmetry is spontaneously broken to U(1), producing gapless spin‐wave excitations (magnons) as Goldstone bosons. 2) Pions: In QCD, the approximate chiral SU(2)_L×SU(2)_R symmetry is spontaneously broken to SU(2)_V, yielding (pseudo)‐Goldstone bosons (pions). 3) Phonons: In a crystal, continuous translational symmetry is spontaneously broken to a discrete lattice symmetry, giving rise to acoustic phonons as Goldstone modes. 4) Skyrmions: These are topological solitons—localized, stable configurations characterized by nontrivial winding numbers—and are not themselves gapless excitations of a broken continuous symmetry but rather finite-energy topological defects.
