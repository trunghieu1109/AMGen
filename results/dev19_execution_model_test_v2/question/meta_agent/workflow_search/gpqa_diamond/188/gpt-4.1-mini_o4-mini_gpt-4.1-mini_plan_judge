Question: Example(question='Which of the following (effective) particles is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry?', choice1='Magnon', choice2='Skyrmion', choice3='Pion', choice4='Phonon', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_41_188
proposed answer: We seek which particle is not a Nambu–Goldstone mode arising from spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry:
1. Magnon (A): In a ferromagnet, the SU(2) spin‐rotation symmetry is spontaneously broken to U(1), producing gapless spin‐wave excitations (magnons) as Goldstone bosons.
2. Pion (C): In QCD, the approximate chiral SU(2)_L×SU(2)_R symmetry is spontaneously broken to SU(2)_V, yielding (pseudo)‐Goldstone bosons (pions).
3. Phonon (D): In a crystal, continuous translational symmetry is spontaneously broken to the discrete lattice, giving rise to acoustic phonons as Goldstone modes.
4. Skyrmion (B): A skyrmion is a topological soliton—an extended, stable configuration stabilized by nontrivial topology. It is not a gapless fluctuation of a broken continuous symmetry (not a Goldstone mode) but rather a finite‐energy defect in a broken phase.
Therefore, the only effective particle not directly associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking in the Goldstone sense is the skyrmion.
