Question: Example(question='α-β unsaturated carbonyls have a much more electrophilic carbon double bond. These double bonds act as a good Lewis acid and react with nucleophiles to produce enolate ions. In this case, when a nucleophile attacks the β position, it produces a resonance-stabilized intermediate. When a nucleophile attacking the β-carbon is enolate, such reaction is known as the Michael reaction.\nWhat are the reactants and major final products of the following Michael addition reactions?\ndimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) -->(A)\n1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H3O+) --> (B)\nC + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H2O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice1='A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice2='A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice3='A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice4='A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: 1. Reaction A: Under NaOEt/EtOH, dimethyl malonate is deprotonated at its central methylene to give a stabilized enolate. This enolate performs a 1,4‐Michael addition onto the β‐carbon of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. After protonation, the new C–C bond lies at what becomes C-2 of the propane backbone, bearing the p-tolyl substituent, and all three esters remain intact. The correct name is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. Options 2 and 3 incorrectly place the aryl group at C-3; only options 1 and 4 give the 2-substituted product.

2. Reaction B: Cyclohexanone condenses with piperidine to form the corresponding enamine, which attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile. Acidic hydrolysis (MeOH, H3O+) then regenerates the ketone and frees the nitrile. The final product is the β-keto nitrile 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile. Options 2 and 3 propose a hydroxy‐enol or enamine-derived structure; only options 1 and 4 name the oxo-substituted cyclohexyl nitrile.

3. Reaction C: To form 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione under KOH/H2O, the Michael donor must be cyclohexane-1,3-dione (capable of enolate formation at C-2). Its enolate adds to but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone) at the β-carbon. Protonation yields the keto product 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. Options 1 and 3 list a 2-hydroxy derivative for C, while only options 2 and 4 correctly identify C as cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

4. Cross‐matching all three products shows that only choice D (option 4) consistently gives:
   A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate
   B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile
   C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione

Thus, the most chemically consistent answer is D).
