Question: Example(question='In an inactive state, a transcription factor subunit awaits an activation signal from the membrane phosphorylation cascade. Upon phosphorylation on the Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, shuttles into the nucleus, and serves in gene transcription. A missense mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. You observe that a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Which of the following molecular phenotypes is most likely observed in the presence of mutation Y?', choice1='loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype', choice2='protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype', choice3='protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele', choice4='change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: 1. Mutation Y resides in the dimerization domain of the transcription factor subunit and is described as heterozygous dominant-negative, implying the mutant polypeptide is expressed alongside the wild-type (WT) polypeptide.
2. For a dimeric transcription factor, proper dimerization is essential for activation (phosphorylation, nuclear translocation, DNA binding, and transactivation).
3. A classic dominant-negative in a dimerization domain still permits the mutant monomer to interact with WT monomers but produces nonfunctional heterodimers. These mispaired complexes cannot assume the correct quaternary structure or undergo the necessary post‐translational modifications for activity.
4. Misfolded heterodimers often expose hydrophobic surfaces that drive aberrant intermolecular interactions, leading to the formation of higher‐order aggregates or inclusion bodies. Aggregation sequesters both mutant and WT subunits, depleting the pool of functional homodimers.
5. The result is a severe loss‐of‐function phenotype even though one WT allele is present—the hallmark of a dominant‐negative effect.
6. Alternative options fail to account for dominant interference: (A) loss of dimerization would be recessive if mutant cannot bind WT; (C) targeted degradation of WT by mutant is less common in pure dimerization‐domain mutants; (D) gain‐of‐function contradicts the observed loss of transcriptional output.
7. Therefore, the most likely molecular phenotype caused by mutation Y is protein aggregation with resultant loss of function.
