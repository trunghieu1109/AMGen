Question: Example(question='In a specific region of the sky, astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?', choice1='~ r^2', choice2='~ r^4', choice3='~ r^3', choice4='~ r^5', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: We start from the given differential count in parallax space: dN/d(plx) ∝ plx^(–5).

1. Recall that parallax plx and distance r are inversely related by plx = k/r (k is a constant set by unit conventions).

2. We want the distribution in distance space: dN/dr. Use the change‐of‐variables formula:
   dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) × |d(plx)/dr|.

3. Substitute plx = k/r into dN/d(plx):
   dN/d(plx) ∝ (plx)^(–5) = (k/r)^(–5) = k^(–5) · r^5.

4. Compute the Jacobian factor:
   d(plx)/dr = d(k/r)/dr = -k/r^2 ⇒ |d(plx)/dr| = k/r^2.

5. Multiply these two factors:
   dN/dr ∝ [k^(–5) · r^5] × [k/r^2]
           = k^(–5+1) · r^(5–2)
           = k^(–4) · r^3.

6. The constant k^(–4) affects only normalization and does not change the power‐law exponent in r.

7. Therefore, the number of stars per unit distance interval scales as r^3.

8. Among the provided options (~r^2, ~r^4, ~r^3, ~r^5), the correct choice is ~r^3, which is choice C).
