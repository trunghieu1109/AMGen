Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_1_176
proposed answer: We use the Stefan–Boltzmann law for black‐body luminosity: L=4πR²σT⁴. For two stars,
L₁/L₂=(R₁²T₁⁴)/(R₂²T₂⁴).
Spectroscopy shows they peak at the same wavelength, so by Wien’s displacement law their effective temperatures are equal (T₁=T₂). That makes the temperature term unity, leaving L₁/L₂=(R₁/R₂)². Given R₁/R₂=1.5, we compute (1.5)²=2.25.
Comparing this result with the provided choices (~2.25, ~2.35, ~2.32, ~2.23), the closest—and exact—match is choice A (~2.25).

proposed answer: We apply the Stefan–Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴. Thus the luminosity ratio is L₁/L₂ = (R₁/R₂)²·(T₁/T₂)⁴.  

1. Radius factor: R₁/R₂ = 1.5 ⇒ (R₁/R₂)² = 2.25.  
2. Doppler correction for Star₂’s temperature:  
   • Star₂ recedes at v = 700 km/s. c ≈ 3×10⁵ km/s ⇒ v/c ≈ 0.002333.  
   • Observed peak wavelength λ_obs is the same for both stars, but for Star₂ λ_obs = λ₂,rest·(1 + v/c).  
   • By Wien’s law, T ∝ 1/λ_rest ⇒ T₂ = b/λ₂,rest = b/[λ_obs/(1 + v/c)] = T₁·(1 + v/c).  
   • Therefore T₁/T₂ = 1/(1 + v/c) ≈ 1/1.002333 ≈ 0.997667.  
3. Temperature factor: (T₁/T₂)⁴ ≈ (0.997667)⁴ ≈ 0.9907.  
4. Combine factors: L₁/L₂ = 2.25 × 0.9907 ≈ 2.2286.  
5. Compare with provided choices (~2.25, ~2.35, ~2.32, ~2.23); 2.2286 rounds to ~2.23.  
Hence the correct answer is D).
