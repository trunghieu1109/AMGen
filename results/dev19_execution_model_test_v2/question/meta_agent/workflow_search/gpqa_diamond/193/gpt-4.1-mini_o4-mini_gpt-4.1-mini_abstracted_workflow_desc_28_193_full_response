Extract and Summarize Given Information:\n- The system consists of three spins: S1, S2, and S3.\n- Each spin can take values +1 or -1.\n- The energy of the system is given by E = -J (S1 S2 + S1 S3 + S2 S3), where J is a coupling constant.\n- The parameter \\beta = 1/(kT), where k is the Boltzmann constant and T is temperature.\n- Four candidate expressions for the partition function Z are provided, each involving sums of exponentials with arguments proportional to J\\beta.\n\n2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:\n- The energy depends on pairwise products of spins, indicating interactions between each pair of spins.\n- Since spins take discrete values, the total number of configurations is 2^3 = 8.\n- The partition function Z is the sum over all configurations of e^{-\\beta E}.\n- The energy expression is symmetric in the spins, so configurations with the same number of aligned pairs will have the same energy.\n- The choices suggest grouping configurations by energy levels, with multiplicities reflected in coefficients (2 and 6).\n- The sign and magnitude of J influence whether aligned spins lower or raise energy.\n\n3. Identify the Field of Study:\n- The problem lies in statistical mechanics and mathematical physics.\n- It involves concepts from discrete mathematics (spin configurations), combinatorics (counting states), and exponential functions.\n- The partition function is a central object in thermodynamics and statistical mechanics.\n- Such problems are common in physics, particularly in the study of Ising models and magnetic systems.\n\n4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:\n- The value or sign of J is not specified; whether J > 0 (ferromagnetic) or J < 0 (antiferromagnetic) affects energy levels.\n- The problem assumes standard Boltzmann statistics but does not explicitly state boundary conditions or external fields.\n- The exact grouping of configurations into energy classes is implicit and requires enumeration.\n- The notation and constants are standard but may require explicit definitions for clarity in some contexts..These are just pieces of information related to the question. You are not required to answer the question — just follow what is defined in the instruction: Sub-task 3: Compute the partition function Z by summing over all configurations: Z = sum over e^(-beta*E), using the grouped energies and degeneracies from Sub-task 2, and match the resulting expression with the given choices.
