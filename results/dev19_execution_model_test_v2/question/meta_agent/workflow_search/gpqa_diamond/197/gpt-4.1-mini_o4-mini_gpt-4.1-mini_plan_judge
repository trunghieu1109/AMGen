Question: Example(question='We have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate, where the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M and the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16. What will be the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species in the solution? ', choice1='16.9%', choice2='42.3%', choice3='25.6%', choice4='38.1%', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: 1. Identify the species and given data:
   - Total cobalt concentration: [Co]tot = 1.0×10⁻² M.
   - Free thiocyanate concentration: [SCN⁻] = 0.10 M (in large excess, treated as constant).
   - Complexes: Co²⁺, Co(SCN)⁺, Co(SCN)₂, Co(SCN)₃⁻, Co(SCN)₄²⁻.
   - Cumulative formation constants: β1 = 9, β2 = 40, β3 = 63, β4 = 16.

2. Express each complex concentration in terms of free Co²⁺:
   [Co(SCN)n] = βn × [Co²⁺] × [SCN⁻]ⁿ, for n = 1 to 4.

3. Write the cobalt mass balance:
   [Co]tot = [Co²⁺] + [Co(SCN)⁺] + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃⁻] + [Co(SCN)₄²⁻]
           = [Co²⁺] × (1 + β1·L + β2·L² + β3·L³ + β4·L⁴),
   where L = [SCN⁻] = 0.10 M.

4. Compute the terms in the bracket:
   β1·L   = 9    × 0.10   = 0.90
   β2·L²  = 40   × 0.01   = 0.40
   β3·L³  = 63   × 0.001  = 0.063
   β4·L⁴  = 16   × 0.0001 = 0.0016
   Sum D  = 1 + 0.90 + 0.40 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646

5. Solve for free cobalt concentration:
   [Co²⁺] = [Co]tot / D = (1.0×10⁻² M) / 2.3646 ≈ 4.23×10⁻³ M.

6. Calculate the dithiocyanato complex concentration:
   [Co(SCN)₂] = β2 × [Co²⁺] × L²
               = 40 × 4.23×10⁻³ M × 0.01
               ≈ 1.69×10⁻³ M.

7. Determine its percentage of total cobalt:
   Percentage = ([Co(SCN)₂] / [Co]tot) × 100%
              = (1.69×10⁻³ / 1.0×10⁻²) × 100%
              ≈ 16.9%.

8. Compare with the provided choices: 16.9% corresponds to choice A).
