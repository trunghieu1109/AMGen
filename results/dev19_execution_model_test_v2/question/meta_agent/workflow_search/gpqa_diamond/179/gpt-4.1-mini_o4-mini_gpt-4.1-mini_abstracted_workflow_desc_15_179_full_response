In that problem, one seeks the arrangement of N point charges on a unit sphere that minimizes the sum of pairwise 1/r_{ij} interactions.\n\n1. Known result: For N=12, the unique energy‐minimizing configuration is the regular icosahedron.  This follows from exhaustive numerical and symmetry arguments: the icosahedron’s high 5‐fold symmetry evenly distributes the repulsive forces, yielding the lowest possible energy.\n\n2. Any other candidate (e.g., cuboctahedron or other polyhedron) has higher total pairwise potential because its vertices are not all equidistantly ‘‘far apart’’ in the sense that the icosahedron is.\n\n3. Therefore, the 12 charges sit at the 12 vertices of a regular icosahedron to minimize their mutual repulsions.\n\nThus the answer to sub‐task 1_2 (which of the possible arrangements gives the minimum energy) is the regular icosahedron.; answer: C)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCritic agent EGbS, providing feedback, thinking: The solution rightly recognizes that arranging 12 identical charges at the vertices of a regular icosahedron yields the minimum mutual repulsion (the classic Thomson problem for N=12).
