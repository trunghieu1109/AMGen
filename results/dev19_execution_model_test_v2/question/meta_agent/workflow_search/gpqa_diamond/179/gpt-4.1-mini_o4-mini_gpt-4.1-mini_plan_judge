Question: Example(question='Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are\nconstrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P.

proposed answer: First, recompute the central–sphere interactions:
- Each charge q = 2e = 2 × 1.602×10⁻¹⁹ C, so q² = 4e² = 4 × (1.602×10⁻¹⁹)² = 1.0264×10⁻³7 C².
- Coulomb constant k = 8.988×10⁹ N·m²/C², separation R = 2 m.
- Energy per central–surface pair U_pair = k·q²/R = (8.988×10⁹ × 1.0264×10⁻³7)/2 = 4.614×10⁻²8 J.
- There are 12 such pairs, so U_center = 12 × 4.614×10⁻²8 = 5.537×10⁻²7 J.

Next, compute the mutual interactions among the 12 charges on the sphere (the Thomson N=12 problem):
- On a unit sphere, the minimum‐energy arrangement (icosahedron) yields Σ_{i<j}(1/d_unit) ≈ 49.11.
- On a sphere of radius 2 m, every distance doubles, so Σ(1/r) = 49.11/2 = 24.555.
- Thus U_mutual = k·q²·Σ(1/r) = 8.988×10⁹ × 1.0264×10⁻³7 × 24.555 = 2.269×10⁻²6 J.

Total energy U_total = U_center + U_mutual = 5.537×10⁻²7 + 2.269×10⁻²6 = 2.822×10⁻²6 J.

Comparing with the choices (all in J, to three significant figures):
A) 2.822×10⁻²6  B) 5.645×10⁻²6  C) 7.056×10⁻²7  D) 122.330

Only choice A matches our computed value exactly. Possible errors could arise from miscalculating pairwise sums or using an incorrect geometric configuration, but the icosahedral arrangement for N=12 is well established. Hence the correct choice is A).
