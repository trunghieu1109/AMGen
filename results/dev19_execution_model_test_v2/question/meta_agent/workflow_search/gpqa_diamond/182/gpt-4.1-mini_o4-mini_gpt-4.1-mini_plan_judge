Question: Example(question='What is the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product obtained when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess of HI?', choice1='1', choice2='3', choice3='0', choice4='5', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_1_182
proposed answer: Step 1: Determine the starting molecule’s IHD
- 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid features:
  • One six-membered ring → 1 IHD
  • One C=C in the cyclohexene ring → 1 IHD
  • One vinyl C=C → 1 IHD
  • One aldehyde C=O → 1 IHD
  • One carboxylic acid C=O → 1 IHD
- Total starting IHD = 1 (ring) + 4 (π bonds) = 5

Step 2: Predict the reaction outcome with Red P and excess HI
- Red P/HI is a strong deoxygenative, reductive system:
  • Aldehyde (–CHO) and carboxylic acid (–COOH) are reduced to alkyl iodides, removing both C=O bonds.
  • Both C=C (ring and vinyl) are hydrogenated and converted to C–I bonds (or saturated C–H followed by iodination), removing all π bonds.
- The cyclohexane ring remains intact; substituents become iodides at carbons 2, 3, and 5.

Step 3: Compute the product’s IHD
- Product: 2,3,5-triiodocyclohexane (C6H9I3)
- Rings: 1 → 1 IHD
- π Bonds: 0 → 0 IHD
- Halogens do not contribute to IHD
- Total product IHD = 1 + 0 = 1

Step 4: Cross-check by formula method
- IHD = (2C + 2 – H – X)/2 = (2·6 + 2 – 9 – 3)/2 = (12 + 2 – 12)/2 = 1

Conclusion: The index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.
