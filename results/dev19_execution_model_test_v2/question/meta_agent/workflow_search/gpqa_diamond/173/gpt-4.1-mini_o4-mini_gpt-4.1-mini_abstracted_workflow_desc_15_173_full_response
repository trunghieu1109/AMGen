Extract and Summarize Given Information:\n- Initial atomic nucleus mass: M, with rest-mass energy 300 GeV.\n- The nucleus is initially at rest.\n- The nucleus undergoes spontaneous fission into exactly two fragments.\n- One fragment is twice as massive as the other in terms of rest mass.\n- The sum of the rest masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M (i.e., total rest mass after fission is 0.99 M).\n- Kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is denoted as T1.\n- The problem asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) T1 and the classical (non-relativistic) approximation of T1.\n- Electrons are ignored.\n\n2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:\n- The initial nucleus is at rest, so total initial momentum is zero.\n- After fission, the two fragments move in opposite directions to conserve momentum.\n- The rest mass loss (1% of M) corresponds to energy released as kinetic energy of the fragments.\n- The mass ratio (2:1) sets the rest masses of the fragments as m and 2m, with m + 2m = 0.99 M.\n- Conservation of energy and momentum must be applied relativistically to find the exact kinetic energies.\n- The classical approximation assumes kinetic energy T = p^2/(2m), ignoring relativistic effects.\n- The difference between relativistic and classical kinetic energies arises due to relativistic momentum and energy relations at high energies.\n\n3. Identify the Field of Study:\n- The problem lies in the domain of relativistic physics, specifically relativistic mechanics.\n- It involves concepts from nuclear physics (fission), special relativity (energy-momentum relations), and classical mechanics (kinetic energy approximation).\n- Subfields include particle physics and nuclear energy calculations.\n- Such problems are common in physics education, nuclear engineering, and high-energy physics contexts.\n\n4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:\n- The exact numerical values of fragment masses are implicit but can be derived; however, the problem does not specify if the fragments are point particles or have internal excitation.\n- The problem assumes no other particles are emitted, which simplifies momentum and energy conservation.\n- The term "correct T1" implies a fully relativistic calculation, but the problem does not specify the method or approximations allowed.\n- Potential challenge includes handling relativistic kinetic energy expressions and comparing them to classical approximations without explicit intermediate steps.\n- The problem ignores electrons, so electron binding energy or recoil effects are neglected..These are just pieces of information related to the question.

Relativistic total energy: E1=√[(p\u2009c)²+(m1c²)²]=√[(19.98)²+(198)²]\u2009GeV ≈√[399.2+39204]\u2009GeV ≈199.008\u2009GeV.  \n3. Relativistic kinetic energy: T1_rel=E1−m1c²≈199.008−198=1.008\u2009GeV=1008\u2009MeV.  \n4. Non‐relativistic approximation: T1_nr=p²/(2m1) with p=19.98\u2009GeV/c, m1=198\u2009GeV/c² ⇒ p²=399.2\u2009GeV²/c² ⇒ T1_nr=399.2/(2×198)\u2009GeV≈1.008\u2009GeV=1008\u2009MeV.  \n5. To next order, the relativistic expansion gives T_rel=T_nr−p⁴/(8m1³c²)+… so the first correction is Δ=T_rel−T_nr≈−p⁴/(8m1³c²).  \n6. Compute p⁴=(399.2)²≈1.5936×10⁵\u2009GeV⁴, m1³=198³≈7.7624×10⁶\u2009GeV³ ⇒ 8m1³≈6.2099×10⁷ ⇒ Δ≈−1.5936×10⁵/6.2099×10⁷\u2009GeV≈−0.00257\u2009GeV=−2.57\u2009MeV.  \n7.

Exact momentum from two‐body decay: p\u2009c≈19.98\u2009GeV, so classical approximation T1_nr=p²/(2m1)≈(19.98²)/(2·198)\u2009GeV≈1.007\u2009GeV.\n5. Difference ΔT1=T1_rel−T1_nr≈1.005−1.007=−0.002\u2009GeV≈−2\u2009MeV (classical overestimates by ~2\u2009MeV).\n6.

The non-relativistic approximation is T1_nr=p²/(2m1)=(19.98²)/(2·198) GeV≈1.008 GeV=1008 MeV.

Let their momenta be p⃗1 and p⃗2, and total energies E1 and E2. 3) Momentum conservation (vector): p⃗1 + p⃗2 = 0 ⇒ |p1| = |p2| = p and p⃗2 = −p⃗1. 4) Energy conservation (scalar): E1 + E2 = Mc^2. 5) Each fragment obeys the relativistic dispersion relation: E_i^2 = (p_i c)^2 + (m_i c^2)^2, for i=1,2. Together, these give three equations: (a) E1 + E2 = Mc^2, (b) E1^2 = p^2c^2 + m1^2c^4, (c) E2^2 = p^2c^2 + m2^2c^4. These are necessary and sufficient to determine p, E1, and E2 uniquely.

Hence 3m2=0.99\u2009M ⇒ m2=0.33\u2009M, m1=0.66\u2009M.\n2. Conservation laws: The initial nucleus is at rest, so total momentum zero. After fission, fragments move back-to-back with equal magnitude of momentum p. Energy conservation: E1+E2=Mc². Relativistic dispersion: Ei²=(pc)²+(mi c²)².\n3. Use standard two‐body decay formula for momentum in rest frame:  p\u2009c = [ (M² − (m1+m2)²)(M² − (m1−m2)²) ]^(1/2) / (2M).\n4.

Total initial four‐momentum: (E_initial, p_initial)=(Mc^2, 0). After fission, fragment 1 has total energy E1 and momentum p1, fragment 2 has E2 and p2, with p2=−p1 to conserve momentum. Conservation of energy: E1+E2 = Mc^2. Conservation of momentum (vector): p1 + p2 = 0 ⇒ p2 = −p1. Relativistic energy‐momentum relation for each fragment: E_i^2 = (p_i c)^2 + (m_i c^2)^2, i=1,2. Thus we have three scalar equations for the unknowns E1, E2, and |p1|=|p2|. Explicitly: (1) E1 + E2 = Mc^2, (2) E1^2 = p^2 c^2 + (m1 c^2)^2, (3) E2^2 = p^2 c^2 + (m2 c^2)^2.
