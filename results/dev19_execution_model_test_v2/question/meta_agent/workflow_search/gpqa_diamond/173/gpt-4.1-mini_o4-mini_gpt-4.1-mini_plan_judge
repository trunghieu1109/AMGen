proposed answer: 1. Initial nucleus rest‐mass energy: E₀ = M c² = 300 GeV. The 1% mass defect gives total kinetic energy released Q = 0.01·300 GeV = 3 GeV.
2. Fragment masses: one fragment is twice the other and m₁ + m₂ = 0.99 M, so m₂ = 0.33 M, m₁ = 0.66 M. In energy units: m₁c² = 0.66·300 GeV = 198 GeV, m₂c² = 99 GeV.
3. Classical kinetic energy of heavy fragment: T₁_nr = Q·(m₂/(m₁ + m₂)) = 3 GeV·(0.33/0.99) = 1 GeV.
4. To find the relativistic kinetic energy T₁_rel, compute the recoil momentum: p² = 2 m₁ T₁_nr = 2·198 GeV·1 GeV = 396 (GeV/c)².
5. Define δ = (pc/(m₁c²))² = 396/198² ≈ 0.0101. Then E₁ = m₁c²√(1+δ), so T₁_rel = m₁c²(√(1+δ) – 1).
6. Expand √(1+δ) ≈ 1 + δ/2 – δ²/8 = 1 + 0.00505 – 0.000013 ≈ 1.005037. Hence T₁_rel ≈ 198 GeV·0.005037 ≈ 0.9974 GeV.
7. Difference ΔT₁ = T₁_rel – T₁_nr = 0.9974 GeV – 1.000 GeV = –0.0026 GeV; in magnitude ≈ 2.6 MeV.
8. Among the given options (10, 5, 2, 20 MeV), the closest value is 2 MeV.
Therefore the correct choice is C).

proposed answer: We have an initial nucleus of rest energy 300 GeV splitting into two fragments with rest masses m_big=2m and m_small=m satisfying m_big+m_small=0.99M ⇒ m_big=0.66M=198 GeV/c², m_small=0.33M=99 GeV/c². The mass defect ΔM=(M−(m_big+m_small))=0.01M yields total kinetic energy Q=0.01·300 GeV=3 GeV. By momentum conservation in two‐body decay, both fragments have equal and opposite momenta p, with p c≈√[ (Q²+2Q·(m_big+m_small)c² ) ·(m_big²+m_small²−M²)/(4M²) ] which numerically gives p c≈19.98 GeV. Relativistic kinetic energy of the heavy fragment is T1_rel=√[(p c)²+(m_bigc²)²]−m_bigc²≈√[ (19.98)²+198² ]−198≈1.008 GeV. The non‐relativistic approximation T1_nr=p²/(2m_big)= (19.98²)/(2·198) GeV≈1.008 GeV as well at leading order. To find the small difference, we expand T_rel=T_nr−p⁴/(8m_big³c²)+… ⇒ ΔT=T1_rel−T1_nr≈−p⁴/(8m_big³c²)≈−(399.2²)/(8·198³) GeV≈−0.0026 GeV≈−2.6 MeV (classical slightly overestimates). In magnitude the correction is about 2 MeV, matching choice C).
