Question: Example(question='You identified a new quorum-sensing peptide in the bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus. You are highly interested if its role in intercellular communication is conserved among the eukaryotes. You treat yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with the peptide and interestingly observe the formation of the shmoo. You want to learn about the proteome of the active chromatin in the shmoo and recover it by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. The least of proteins from which complex below will you observe in your assay?', choice1='pre-initiation complex', choice2='pre-replication complex', choice3='enhancer protein complex', choice4='nucleosome histone complex', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: Step 1: Define the experimental context. We perform chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) of transcriptionally active chromatin from yeast cells undergoing shmoo formation, followed by mass spectrometry. Shmoo formation is induced by mating pheromone and causes cell-cycle arrest in G1 and activation of mating-specific gene expression.

Step 2: Examine each protein complex’s association with active chromatin under these conditions.
• Nucleosome histone complex: Core histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 wrap DNA in every chromatin region. Even in open, active chromatin, histones remain bound and crosslink efficiently to DNA. Thus histones will be highly abundant in any ChIP of chromatin.
• Pre-initiation complex (PIC): Consists of RNA polymerase II and general transcription factors assembled at promoters of actively transcribed genes. Shmoo formation strongly induces transcription of mating genes, so PIC components will be specifically enriched at these active promoters and co-purify with active chromatin.
• Enhancer protein complex: Composed of sequence-specific activators (e.g. Ste12), coactivators (e.g. Mediator, SAGA), and associated factors bound at upstream regulatory elements. Active enhancers loop to promoters of induced genes and are part of the active chromatin architecture, so these proteins will be appreciably recovered in a ChIP targeting active loci.
• Pre-replication complex (pre-RC): Includes the origin recognition complex (ORC), Cdc6, Cdt1, and the MCM helicase. These factors assemble at replication origins during late M and G1 to license DNA synthesis during S phase. During the mating response, yeast cells arrest in G1 and suppress origin licensing and S-phase entry. Pre-RC components are not associated with transcriptionally active regions and are largely absent or present only at dormant origins, not co-localized with active promoters/enhancers.

Step 3: Predict relative recovery in ChIP-MS of active chromatin.
• Histones will be most abundant (background chromatin).
• PIC factors will be enriched at active promoters.
• Enhancer proteins will be enriched at active regulatory elements.
• Pre-RC factors will be minimally crosslinked to active gene regions and thus recovered at background or near-zero levels.

Step 4: Conclusion. The pre-replication complex is functionally decoupled from transcriptionally active chromatin under pheromone arrest and will be the least observed in the ChIP-MS assay.
