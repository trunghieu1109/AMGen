proposed answer: 1. In four-dimensional spacetime with natural units (ℏ=c=1), the Lagrangian density must have mass dimension 4.
2. A Dirac spinor ψ has mass dimension 3/2, and its adjoint ψ̄ also has dimension 3/2.
3. The commutator σ_{μν} constructed from gamma matrices is dimensionless.
4. The electromagnetic field strength tensor F^{μν} has mass dimension 2.
5. The operator ψ̄σ_{μν}ψF^{μν} therefore has total dimension 3/2 + 3/2 + 2 = 5.
6. To make the interaction term κ ψ̄σ_{μν}ψF^{μν} have dimension 4, κ must supply mass dimension 4 − 5 = −1.
7. A coupling constant with negative mass dimension indicates a nonrenormalizable interaction under power-counting.
Conclusion: [κ] = −1 and the theory is not renormalizable, corresponding to choice C).
