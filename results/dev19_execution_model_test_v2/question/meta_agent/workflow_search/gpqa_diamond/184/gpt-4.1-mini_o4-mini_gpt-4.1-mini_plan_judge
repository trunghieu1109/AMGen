proposed answer: 1. The Hamiltonian is H = ε σ·n with n a unit vector and σ the Pauli matrices. 2. Define A = σ·n. Since σ_iσ_j + σ_jσ_i = 2δ_ijI and |n|=1, we get A^2 = I, so eigenvalues λ of A satisfy λ^2 = 1 ⇒ λ = ±1. 3. Therefore H = εA has eigenvalues ε·λ = ±ε. 4. No ħ appears in the given H, so any choice with ħ is incorrect. 5. Among the options, only choice A) gives +ε and –ε.
