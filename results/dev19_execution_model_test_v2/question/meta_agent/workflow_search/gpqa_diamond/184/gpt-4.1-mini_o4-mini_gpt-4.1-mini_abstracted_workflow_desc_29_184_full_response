We start from the Hamiltonian H = ε\u2009(σ·n), where σ = (σ_x,σ_y,σ_z) are the Pauli matrices and n = (n_x,n_y,n_z) is a real unit vector (n_x^2+n_y^2+n_z^2=1).  \n2. Define the operator A = σ·n = n_xσ_x + n_yσ_y + n_zσ_z. Because each σ_i is Hermitian and n_i are real, A is Hermitian with real eigenvalues.  \n3.

Since σ·n is a Hermitian 2×2 operator built from the Pauli matrices and a real unit vector n, its eigenvalues are ±1. Detailed steps:\n\n1. Hermiticity and matrix square: The Pauli matrices obey σ_iσ_j=δ_{ij}I + iε_{ijk}σ_k. Therefore (σ·n)^2 = n_i n_j σ_i σ_j = n_i n_j (δ_{ij}I + iε_{ijk}σ_k) = (n·n)I + iε_{ijk}n_i n_jσ_k.
