The equations imply v∝(1,0,−1), so a normalized eigenvector is |v_0⟩=(1/√2,\u20090,\u2009−1/√2).  \nStep 3: Construct the projector onto the 0 eigenspace: P_0=|v_0⟩⟨v_0|.  \nStep 4: Project |ψ_norm⟩ onto this eigenspace: ⟨v_0|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√2)(-1/√6) + (−1/√2)(1/√6) = -2/(√12)= -1/√3, so P_0|ψ_norm⟩ = (-1/√3)|v_0⟩ = (-1/√6,0,1/√6).  \nStep 5: The probability of measuring eigenvalue 0 is the squared norm of this projection: (1/6)+(0)+(1/6)=2/6=1/3.  \nComparing to the choices (1/3, 2/3, √(2/3), 1), the correct answer is 1/3, choice A).\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent DkZA:\nWe start with the normalized state ψ = (–1,2,1)ᵀ/√6. The observable P has eigenvalue 0 with eigenspace spanned by v₀ = (1,0,–1)/√2.

But since v₀ has two nonzero components, the projection has components (–1/6,0,1/6) up to sign, yielding total probability (1/6 + 1/6) = 2/6 = 1/3. Among the choices (A) 1/3, (B) 2/3, (C) √(2/3), (D) 1, only 1/3 matches.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent Bwgf:\nFirst, normalize the state vector ψ=(–1,2,1)ᵀ. Its norm is √[1+4+1]=√6, so ψ_norm=(–1/√6,2/√6,1/√6). Next, find the eigenspace of P for eigenvalue 0. Solving P\u2009v=0 yields v₀ proportional to (1,0,–1), normalized as v₀=(1/√2,0,–1/√2). According to quantum measurement theory, the probability of outcome 0 is |⟨v₀|ψ_norm⟩|². Compute the inner product: ⟨v₀|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√2)(–1/√6) + 0·(2/√6) + (–1/√2)(1/√6) = –2/(√12) = –1/√3. Squaring gives 1/3.
