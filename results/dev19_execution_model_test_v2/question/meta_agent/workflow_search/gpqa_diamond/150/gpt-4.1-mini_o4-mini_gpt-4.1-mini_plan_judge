Question: Example(question='The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1). An observable of the system is represented by the matrix operator P having elements in the first row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0),  in the second row as (1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}) and in the third row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0). Calculate the probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 at time t.', choice1='1/3\n', choice2='2/3\n', choice3='\\sqrt{2/3}\n', choice4='1', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: Step 1: Normalize the state vector |ψ⟩ = (–1, 2, 1)^T. Its norm is √[(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2] = √6, so |ψ_norm⟩ = (–1/√6, 2/√6, 1/√6).
Step 2: Find the eigenspace of P for eigenvalue 0 by solving P v = 0. This yields v ∝ (1, 0, –1). Normalize to get |v_0⟩ = (1/√2, 0, –1/√2).
Step 3: Compute the amplitude ⟨v_0|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√2)(–1/√6) + 0·(2/√6) + (–1/√2)(1/√6) = –2/√12 = –1/√3.
Step 4: The probability of measuring eigenvalue 0 is |⟨v_0|ψ_norm⟩|^2 = (1/√3)^2 = 1/3.
Step 5: Compare with the given choices {1/3, 2/3, √(2/3), 1}: only 1/3 matches, which is choice A).
