Question: Example(question='Astronomers are observing a planet with a radius of 1 Earth radius in a circular orbit, with a transit impact parameter of 0.2, around a star that has a radius 1.5 times that of the Sun. This planet has an orbital period of 3 days. What is the maximum orbital period of a second planet, with a radius of 2.5 times that of Earth, in the same system that will exhibit both transit and occultation events? Assume that the second planet also has a circular orbit and shares the same orbital plane as the previously mentioned transiting planet.', choice1='~ 7.5', choice2='~ 33.5', choice3='~ 37.5', choice4='~ 12.5', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: 1. Assume the star’s mass M*≃1 M⊙ so we can use Kepler’s third law P2∝a3/2 with P in years and a in AU.
2. Convert P1=3 d to years: P1=3/365.25≈0.008214 yr. Then a1=(P12)1/3≈(0.0082142)1/3≈0.0410 AU.
3. Star radius R*=1.5 R⊙=1.5×0.00465 AU≈0.006975 AU ⇒ a1/R*≈0.0410/0.006975≈5.88.
4. Impact parameter b1=0.2 gives cos i=b1/(a1/R*)=0.2/5.88≈0.0340 ⇒ i≈88.05°.
5. Second planet’s radius ratio k2=Rp2/R*=(2.5 R⊕)/(1.5 R⊙)≈(2.5×0.0000435 AU)/0.006975 AU≈0.0156≈0.0153.
6. For both transit and occultation: (a2/R*) cos i < 1–k2 ⇒ a2/R* < (1–0.0153)/0.0340 ≈0.9847/0.0340≈28.96.
7. Thus a2,max≈28.96 R*≈28.96×0.006975 AU≈0.2020 AU.
8. Then P2≈365.25 d×(0.2020 AU)3/2 ≈365.25×0.0913 yr ≈33.33 days.
9. Of the options (~7.5, ~33.5, ~37.5, ~12.5 d), ~33.33 d is nearest ≈33.5 d.
