proposed answer: Step 1: Identify functional groups from the IR spectrum. A broad stretch at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ and a strong band at 1720 cm⁻¹ indicate a carboxylic acid functional group (O–H and C=O). Aromatic C=C stretches at 1610 and 1450 cm⁻¹ confirm the presence of a benzene ring. Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR data. A broad singlet at 10.5 ppm (1H) corresponds to the COOH proton. Two doublets at 8.0 ppm (2H) and 7.2 ppm (2H) with equal integration and coupling show a para-disubstituted benzene ring. The aliphatic signals at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) integrate to seven protons, consistent with a sec-butyl substituent (CH(CH₃)–CH₂–CH₃). Thus, Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Step 3: Reaction with red phosphorus and HI. This reagent combination is known to effect reductive decarboxylation of aryl carboxylic acids, removing CO₂ and replacing the carboxyl group with hydrogen. The former acid position on the ring thus becomes a methyl substituent. The sec-butyl group remains unchanged at the para position. Step 4: Deduce the final product. Removing the COOH from 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid yields 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. Therefore, the correct final product is choice A).
