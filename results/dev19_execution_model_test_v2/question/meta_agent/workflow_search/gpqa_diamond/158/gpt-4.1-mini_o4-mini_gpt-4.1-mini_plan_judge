Question: Example(question='Observations of a quasar across the electromagnetic spectrum are being carried out. Focusing on the near infrared and optical spectrum, there is a peak at wavelength of about 790 nm, and at shorter wavelengths < 790 nm the flux drops significantly.\n\nIf we lived in a universe defined by Lambda-CDM model such that the current Hubble constant is 70 km s^-1 Mpc^-1, matter density parameter is 0.3, dark energy density parameter is 0.7, and universe is flat,\nwhat can be assumed about the value of the comoving distance (for scale factor a=1) of this quasar from the Earth?', choice1='8 Gpc', choice2='9 Gpc', choice3='7 Gpc', choice4='6 Gpc', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: Step 1: Identify the spectral break. The sharp drop in flux at wavelengths shorter than 790 nm corresponds to the Lyman-α break at rest wavelength λ₀ = 121.6 nm. Equate λ_obs = λ₀ (1 + z): (1 + z) = 790 / 121.6 ≈ 6.50, so z ≈ 5.50.

Step 2: Write the comoving distance formula in a flat ΛCDM universe:
Dₘ = D_C(z) = (c / H₀) ∫₀ᶻ dz' / √[Ωₘ(1 + z')³ + Ω_Λ]
with H₀ = 70 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹, Ωₘ = 0.3, Ω_Λ = 0.7, and c ≈ 3.0×10⁵ km/s.

Step 3: Compute c/H₀: c / H₀ ≈ (3.0×10⁵ km/s) / (70 km/s/Mpc) ≈ 4286 Mpc.

Step 4: Numerically evaluate the integral I = ∫₀⁵․⁵ dz' / √[0.3(1 + z')³ + 0.7]. Standard cosmology tables or numerical integration give I ≈ 1.87.

Step 5: Multiply: Dₘ ≈ 4286 Mpc × 1.87 ≈ 8012 Mpc ≈ 8.0 Gpc.

Step 6: Compare to the multiple‐choice options (6, 7, 8, 9 Gpc). The computed ≈8 Gpc matches choice A).
