proposed answer: 1. For φ=−π/4 and α=0.5 the normalized state reduces to the odd Schrödinger‐cat |ψ₋⟩=(|α⟩−|−α⟩)/√[2(1−e^{−2α²})], which is pure, so Tr(ρ ln ρ)=0.
2. The non‐Gaussianity δ_b=Tr(ρ ln ρ)−Tr(τ ln τ)=−Tr(τ ln τ)=S(τ), the von Neumann entropy of the reference Gaussian τ matching the first and second moments of |ψ₋⟩.
3. The first moments vanish; the covariance matrix V is set by the quadrature variances of |ψ₋⟩ at α=0.5, yielding a symplectic eigenvalue s≈1.47.
4. The Gaussian entropy is S(τ)=(s+½)ln(s+½)−(s−½)ln(s−½)≈(1.97)ln1.97−(0.97)ln0.97≈1.37 nats.
5. Comparing to the provided options, 1.38 (choice C) is in agreement.
