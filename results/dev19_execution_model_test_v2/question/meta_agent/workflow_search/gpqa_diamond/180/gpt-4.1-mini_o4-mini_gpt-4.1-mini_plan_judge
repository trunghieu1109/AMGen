proposed answer: 1. Determine which solar reaction branches contribute to each energy band under normal operation:
   - Band 1 (700–800 keV): Only the pp-III branch (8B decay) provides neutrinos in this range. Its total flux at Earth ≃5×10^6 cm⁻2 s⁻1, but only a small tail (≲10^5 cm⁻2 s⁻1) falls between 700–800 keV. No other branch contributes here.
   - Band 2 (800–900 keV): Dominated by the monoenergetic ^7Be line at 862 keV from the pp-II branch with flux ≃4.5×10^9 cm⁻2 s⁻1. The pp-III branch adds a negligible continuous tail (≲10^5 cm⁻2 s⁻1) in this band.
2. Account for the hypothetical stoppage of the pp-III branch 8.5 minutes ago (neutrino travel time from Sun to Earth):
   - After 8.5 minutes, no new pp-III neutrinos arrive at Earth, so all pp-III contributions vanish.
   - Band 1 loses its only source → flux drops to ≃0.
   - Band 2 loses only the tiny pp-III tail; the dominant ^7Be flux remains ≃4.5×10^9 cm⁻2 s⁻1.
3. Compute the new flux ratio:
   Flux(700–800 keV) / Flux(800–900 keV) = 0 / (4.5×10^9) ≃ 0.
4. Select the closest nonzero option from the given choices {0.1, 10, 1, 0.01} to represent an effectively vanishing ratio. The smallest choice, 0.01 (10⁻2), best approximates zero.
5. Therefore, the correct selection is D).
