proposed answer: 1. The starting material, (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene, presents two π-systems (the exocyclic vinyl at C-2 and the internal C5=C6 bond) rigidly held in an s-cis orientation by the norbornene framework and the (1S,4R) stereochemistry.
2. A suprafacial [3,3]-sigmatropic Cope rearrangement proceeds via a chair-like six-membered transition state, transferring the C2–C3 σ bond to form a new C6–C7 bond while converting the two π bonds into new σ bonds at C2–C6 and C5–Cvinyl.
3. The rearranged skeleton is a cyclopenta[c]pyridine: a six-membered heterocycle with two remaining double bonds at N-1=C-2 and C5=C6, fused to a cyclopentane ring.
4. Numbering of cyclopenta[c]pyridine assigns N as 1; the sp² carbons in the pyridine are 2, 3, 5, 6; the fusion point is C-4; and the three additional cyclopentane carbons are C-4a, C-7, and C-7a.
5. All carbons not involved in the pyridine π bonds (C-4, C-4a, C-7, C-7a) become sp³, giving a tetrahydro pattern at those positions.
6. Among the choices, only 4,4a,7,7a-tetrahydro-1H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine (choice A) correctly describes saturation at those four positions and the 1H tautomer of the pyridine ring. No other isomeric designation matches this mechanistic and nomenclature analysis.
