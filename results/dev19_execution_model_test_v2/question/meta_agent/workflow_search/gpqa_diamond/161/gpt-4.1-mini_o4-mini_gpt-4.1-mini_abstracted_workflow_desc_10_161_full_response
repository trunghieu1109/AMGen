The metric tensor g in polar coordinates has components g_rr = 32/(4−r²), g_θθ = 32r²/(4−r²), and off‐diagonals zero. Thus the area element is dA = √(g_rr·g_θθ) dr dθ = (32r/(4−r²)) dr dθ. The total area is A = ∫₀^{2π} ∫₀^{2} (32r/(4−r²)) dr dθ = 2π ∫₀^{2} (32r/(4−r²)) dr. Evaluate I = ∫₀^{2} (32r/(4−r²)) dr. Use substitution u = 4−r² ⇒ du = −2r dr ⇒ r dr = −du/2. Then I = ∫_{u=4}^{0} (32/(u)) (−du/2) = 16 ∫_{0}^{4} du/u = 16[ln u]₀^{4}. As u→0⁺ (r→2), ln u → −∞, so I diverges to +∞. Hence A = 2π·I = +∞. The pseudosphere of radius 2 thus has infinite area.
