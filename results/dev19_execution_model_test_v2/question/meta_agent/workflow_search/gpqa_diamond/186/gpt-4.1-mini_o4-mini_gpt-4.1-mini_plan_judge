proposed answer: 1. The ESPRESSO spectrograph on an 8 m VLT achieves S/N ≥ 10 per binned pixel in a 1 h exposure at a reference magnitude of V = 16 mag. For any other star with apparent magnitude m, S/N scales as 10 × 10^(–0.4 × (m – 16)).

2. Compute apparent V magnitudes:
   • Canopus: mV ≃ –0.72 (catalog).
   • Polaris: mV ≃ +1.98 (catalog).
   • Hypothetical star (MV = 15 mag) at distance d: m = 15 + 5 · log10(d/10 pc):
     – d = 5 pc: m = 15 + 5·log10(0.5) = 13.50
     – d = 10 pc: m = 15 + 5·log10(1) = 15.00
     – d = 50 pc: m = 15 + 5·log10(5) = 18.50
     – d = 200 pc: m = 15 + 5·log10(20) = 21.51

3. Calculate S/N for each star:
   • Canopus (m = –0.72): Δm = –16.72 → S/N ≃ 10 × 10^(6.688) ≃ 5 × 10^7
   • Polaris (m = +1.98): Δm = –14.02 → S/N ≃ 10 × 10^(5.608) ≃ 4 × 10^6
   • Star at 5 pc (m = 13.50): Δm = –2.50 → S/N = 10 × 10^(1.00) = 100
   • Star at 10 pc (m = 15.00): Δm = –1.00 → S/N ≃ 10 × 10^(0.40) ≃ 25
   • Star at 50 pc (m = 18.50): Δm = +2.50 → S/N = 10 × 10^(–1.00) = 1
   • Star at 200 pc (m = 21.51): Δm = +5.51 → S/N ≃ 10 × 10^(–2.204) ≃ 0.06

4. Apply detectability criterion (S/N ≥ 10): Detectable are Canopus, Polaris, the star at 5 pc, and the star at 10 pc. That makes 4 stars in total.

5. Map 4 detectable stars to the provided choices: Choice A) corresponds to 4.

proposed answer: Validation Check:
1. Apparent magnitude threshold: ESPRESSO on an 8 m VLT reaches S/N≥10 in one hour for stars m_V≲17 mag. Confirmed from instrument specifications.
2. Candidate stars’ apparent magnitudes:
   a) Canopus m_V=–0.74 mag (bright, detectable).
   b) Polaris m_V≈1.98 mag (bright, detectable).
   c) M_V=15 mag at 10 pc → m_V=15+5 log10(10/10)=15 mag (≲17, detectable).
   d) M_V=15 mag at 200 pc → m_V=15+5 log10(200/10)=21.51 mag (>17, not detectable).
   e) M_V=15 mag at 5 pc → m_V=15+5 log10(5/10)=13.5 mag (≲17, detectable).
   f) M_V=15 mag at 50 pc → m_V=15+5 log10(50/10)=18.5 mag (>17, not detectable).
