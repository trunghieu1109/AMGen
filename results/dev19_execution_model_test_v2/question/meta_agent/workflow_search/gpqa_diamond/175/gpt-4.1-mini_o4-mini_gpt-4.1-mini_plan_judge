Question: Example(question='The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1), and the operators of two observables P and Q of the system are represented by two square matrices. The matrix corresponding to operator P has the elements in first row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0), elements in the second row as (1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}) and that in third row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0). The matrix operator for Q is represented by the square matrix having elements in the first row as (1, 0, 0), second row as (0, 0, 0) and third row as (0, 0, -1). Now, if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P, what is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements?', choice1='1/2', choice2='1/6', choice3='1/3', choice4='2/3', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: 1. From Sub-task 4, after measuring P and obtaining eigenvalue 0, the system collapses into the normalized state ψ_post in the zero‐eigenspace of P. Explicitly, one finds ψ_post = (–1/√2, 0, 1/√2)^T (overall phase irrelevant).  
2. From Sub-task 3, the eigenvector of Q corresponding to eigenvalue –1 is v_{–1} = (0, 0, 1)^T, already normalized.  
3. According to the projection postulate, the probability of subsequently measuring Q=–1 is |⟨v_{–1}|ψ_post⟩|^2.  
4. Compute the overlap: ⟨v_{–1}|ψ_post⟩ = (0, 0, 1)·(–1/√2, 0, 1/√2) = 1/√2 (up to a sign, which does not affect the magnitude).  
5. Square this magnitude: |1/√2|^2 = 1/2.  
6. Therefore, the probability of getting P=0 followed by Q=–1 is 1/2, corresponding to choice A).

proposed answer: To find the joint probability P(P=0 and Q=−1), we use the chain rule of probabilities:

1. P(P=0) was found to be 1/3 (Sub-task 5).
2. P(Q=−1 | P=0) was found to be 1/2 (Sub-task 6).
3. The joint probability is P(P=0 and Q=−1) = P(P=0) × P(Q=−1 | P=0) = (1/3) × (1/2) = 1/6.

Thus the correct answer is choice B).
