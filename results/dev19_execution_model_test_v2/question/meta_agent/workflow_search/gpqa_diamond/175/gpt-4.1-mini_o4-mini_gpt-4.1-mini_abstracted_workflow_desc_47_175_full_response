Extract and Summarize Given Information:\n- The system\'s state at time t is given by the column vector \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\).\n- Two observables, P and Q, are represented by 3x3 matrices.\n- Operator P\'s matrix elements are:\n  \\[ P = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\\\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ 0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\]\n- Operator Q\'s matrix elements are:\n  \\[ Q = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\]\n- The problem involves sequential measurements: first measuring P and obtaining eigenvalue 0, then measuring Q and obtaining eigenvalue -1.\n\n2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:\n- The state vector represents the system\'s initial condition in a 3-dimensional Hilbert space.\n- Operators P and Q are Hermitian matrices representing observables with eigenvalues corresponding to possible measurement outcomes.\n- The measurement of P yielding 0 implies projecting the state onto the eigenspace of P associated with eigenvalue 0.\n- The subsequent measurement of Q yielding -1 involves projecting the post-P-measurement state onto the eigenspace of Q with eigenvalue -1.\n- The probability of these sequential outcomes depends on the overlaps between the initial state and the eigenvectors of P and Q, and the projection postulate of quantum mechanics.\n\n3. Identify the Field of Study:\n- The problem lies in the domain of quantum mechanics, specifically quantum measurement theory.\n- Mathematically, it involves linear algebra (eigenvalues, eigenvectors, projections), and complex vector spaces (Hilbert spaces).\n- Subfields include quantum information theory and operator theory.\n- Such problems commonly appear in physics (quantum theory), quantum computing, and mathematical physics.\n\n4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:\n- The normalization of the initial state vector is not specified; it may need normalization for probability calculations.\n- The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P and Q are not explicitly given; these must be determined to find projection operators.\n- The problem assumes standard quantum measurement postulates but does not explicitly state the measurement model (e.g., projective measurement).\n- Potential complexity arises in computing projections and probabilities without explicit eigen-decompositions provided.\n- The order of measurement (P then Q) is crucial and affects the state collapse and subsequent probabilities..These are just pieces of information related to the question.
