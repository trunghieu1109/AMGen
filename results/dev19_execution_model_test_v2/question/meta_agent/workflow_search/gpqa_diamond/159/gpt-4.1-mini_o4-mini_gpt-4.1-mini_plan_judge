Question: Example(question='Consider an aperture, which shapes like a N-sided polygon. All the apothems are of the same length a. When a monochromatic light (of wavelength \\lambda), travelling along z-axis, falls vertically on this aperture, it creates a series of intensity maxima and minima in the far field region. What is the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large ? Assume that the related angles are small so that tan theta = theta approximation can be taken.', choice1='1.220 \\lambda /a ', choice2='0.610 \\lambda / a', choice3='0.500 \\lambda / a', choice4='0.506 \\lambda / a', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: 1. As N → ∞, the regular N‐sided polygon with apothem a becomes a circular aperture of radius R = a.
2. In the Fraunhofer (far‐field) diffraction of a circular aperture, the intensity follows the Airy pattern I(θ) ∝ [2J₁(kR sinθ)/(kR sinθ)]², with k = 2π/λ.
3. The minima occur at the zeros xₘ of the Bessel function J₁: x₁ ≈ 3.8317 and x₂ ≈ 7.0156.
4. For small angles, sinθ ≈ θ, so the condition kRθₘ = xₘ gives θₘ = xₘ·λ/(2πa).
5. Calculate the first two minima:
   • θ₁ = 3.8317·λ/(2πa) ≈ 0.610·λ/a
   • θ₂ = 7.0156·λ/(2πa) ≈ 1.1165·λ/a
6. The angular separation is Δθ = θ₂ − θ₁ ≈ (1.1165 − 0.610)·λ/a ≈ 0.5065·λ/a.
7. Among the given options (1.220, 0.610, 0.500, 0.506)·λ/a, the closest value is 0.506·λ/a, corresponding to choice D.
