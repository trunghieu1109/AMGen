Factor 3 from the numerator: 3 + 6 cosα = 3(1 + 2 cosα). This simplifies the formula to:\n   d_{111} = a / sqrt[3(1 + 2 cosα)/(1 + 2 cosα)] = a / sqrt(3) * sqrt[(1 + 2 cosα)/(1 + 2 cosα)] = a * sqrt[(1 + 2 cosα)/3].\n4.

Thus\n\n d₍111₎ = a / √[ (3 + 6·cosα) / (1 + 2·cosα) ]\n       = a·√[ (1 + 2·cosα) / 3 ]\n\nSubstitute a = 10 Å and α = 30°, so cos 30° = √3/2 ≈ 0.8660:\n\n 1 + 2·0.8660 = 2.7320\n (2.7320) / 3 ≈ 0.9107\n √0.9107 ≈ 0.9543\n d₍111₎ ≈ 10 × 0.9543 = 9.543 Å ≈ 9.54 Å\n\nThis matches choice A). We check for possible missteps: the formula simplifies neatly because the numerator factor (3 + 6 cosα) shares the term (1 + 2 cosα) with the denominator, minimizing algebraic error. Both independent derivations yield the same result, confirming that 9.54 Å is correct.\n\n### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent qFRr (yourself):\nA)\n\n### Please review the answer above and criticize on where might be wrong.

However, when you simplify\n\n(3+6 cos α)/(1+2 cos α) = 3,\n\nthe factor (1+2 cos α) cancels out exactly.  This yields d₍111₎=a/√3, independent of α, not 10 √[(1+2 cos30°)/3] ≈9.54 Å.  In fact a/√3=10/1.732≈5.77 Å, and so none of the provided answers matches.  Moreover, the problem statement’s “interatomic distance” is almost certainly not the same as the rhombohedral cell edge length a used in the standard formula, and one must be very careful about whether the primitive rhombohedral or the hexagonal setting is intended.  In short, the algebraic simplification was done incorrectly and the initial assumption that “interatomic distance”=a is questionable.\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 1: Combine the quantitative calculation and evaluation results to select and justify the best answer choice for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane.

Factor 3 from the numerator inside the square root: 3 + 6 cos α = 3(1 + 2 cos α). Thus:\n   d_{111} = a / sqrt[3(1 + 2 cos α)/(1 + 2 cos α)] = a / sqrt(3) * sqrt[(1 + 2 cos α)/(1 + 2 cos α)] = a * sqrt[(1 + 2 cos α)/3].\n4. This compact formula, d_{111} = a * sqrt[(1 + 2 cos α)/3], directly relates lattice parameter a and angle α to the (111) interplanar distance.\n5.

Lattice geometry: a = b = c = 10 Å; α = β = γ = 30°. 2. For a rhombohedral system with equal axes and equal angles, the interplanar spacing for (hkl) is given by: d_hkl = a * sqrt(1 - cos²α) / sqrt(h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + kl + lh) cosα). 3. Here cosα = cos30° = √3/2, so 1 – cos²α = 1 – 3/4 = 1/4. Thus numerator = 10 * 0.5 = 5. 4. Denominator term: h=k=l=1 gives h²+k²+l²=3 and 2(hk+kl+lh)cosα = 2·3·(√3/2) = 3√3 ≈5.196.
