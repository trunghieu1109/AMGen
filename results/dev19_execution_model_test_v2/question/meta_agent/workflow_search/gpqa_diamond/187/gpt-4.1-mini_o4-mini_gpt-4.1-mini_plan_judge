Question: Example(question='Consider a rhombohedral crystal, with the interatomic distance of 10 Angstrom and the angles $\\quad\\alpha=\\beta=\\gamma=30^{0}$. What is the interplanar distance of the (111) plane of the crystal?\n', choice1='9.54 Angstrom', choice2='8.95 Angstrom', choice3='9.08 Angstrom', choice4='10.05 Angstrom', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: We need the (111) interplanar spacing in a primitive rhombohedral lattice with “interatomic distance” taken as the rhombohedral edge length a = 10 Å and interaxial angle α = 30°.  The standard expression for spacing is
    d_{hkl} = a / √[ (h² + k² + l² + 2(hk+hl+kl) cosα) / (1 + 2 cosα) ].
For (111): h=k=l=1, so the numerator inside the radical is 3 + 6 cosα and the denominator factor is 1+2 cosα.  Hence
    d_{111} = a / √[ (3 + 6 cosα)/(1 + 2 cosα) ]
           = a √[ (1 + 2 cosα)/3 ]
Substitute a=10 Å, cos30°=√3/2≈0.8660:
    1+2×0.8660 = 2.7320;
    (2.7320)/3 ≈0.9107;
    √0.9107 ≈0.9543;
    d_{111} ≈10×0.9543 = 9.543 Å ≈9.54 Å.
We note potential pitfalls: (1) mis‐identifying “interatomic distance” vs. cell edge—here both equal a in the primitive rhombohedron; (2) algebraic cancellation if one assumes a different formula; (3) choice of primitive vs. hexagonal setting.  Neither of these alters the numerical result of ≈9.54 Å, which matches choice A).
