Question: Example(question='Two stars are being studied. It has been observed that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2. In fact, the energy difference between the considered energy levels was determined to be approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J. Assuming that the stellar photospheres are in LTE, which of these equations for the effective temperatures of the stars (T_1 and T_2) is correct?', choice1='ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]\n', choice2='ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]\n', choice3='ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n', choice4='ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: 1. In Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the population of atoms in an excited level at temperature T follows the Boltzmann distribution: N_excited ∝ exp(–ΔE/(k T)).
2. For two stars with temperatures T₁ and T₂, the ratio of excited‐state populations is
   N₁/N₂ = exp(–ΔE/(k T₁)) / exp(–ΔE/(k T₂)) = exp[(ΔE/k)·(1/T₂ – 1/T₁)].
3. We observe N₁/N₂ = 2, so taking the natural logarithm gives
   ln 2 = (ΔE/k)·(1/T₂ – 1/T₁).
4. Given ΔE ≈ 1.38×10⁻²³ J and k = 1.38×10⁻²³ J/K, we have ΔE/k = 1 K. Substituting yields
   ln 2 = 1·(1/T₂ – 1/T₁) = (T₁ – T₂)/(T₁ T₂).
5. Comparing with the provided forms:
   A) ln(2)=T₂/T₁ — incorrect.
   B) ln(2)=(T₁–T₂)/(T₁ T₂)² — extra square in denominator.
   C) ln(2)=(T₁+T₂)/(T₁ T₂) — sum instead of difference.
   D) ln(2)=(T₁–T₂)/(T₁ T₂) — exact match.
Therefore, the correct equation is choice D.
