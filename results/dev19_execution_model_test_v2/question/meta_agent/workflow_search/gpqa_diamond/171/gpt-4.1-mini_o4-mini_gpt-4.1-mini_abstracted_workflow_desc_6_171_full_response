Extract and Summarize Given Information:\n- Two stars, star_1 and star_2, are studied.\n- Iron atoms in star_1\'s photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2.\n- The energy difference between the considered energy levels is approximately 1.38 × 10^(-23) J.\n- The stellar photospheres are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n- Four candidate equations relate the effective temperatures T_1 and T_2 of the stars.\n\n2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:\n- The excitation ratio (factor of 2) relates to the population of atoms in a given energy state, which under LTE follows the Boltzmann distribution.\n- The energy difference ΔE between levels and temperatures T_1, T_2 influence the relative populations via an exponential factor involving ΔE/(kT), where k is Boltzmann\'s constant.\n- The natural logarithm of the excitation ratio (ln(2)) is expected to relate to a function of T_1 and T_2 and ΔE/k.\n- The constraints imply a relationship between T_1 and T_2 that satisfies the observed excitation ratio.\n- The candidate equations propose different algebraic forms involving T_1 and T_2, suggesting different dependencies.\n\n3. Identify the Field of Study:\n- The problem lies primarily in astrophysics and statistical mechanics.\n- Relevant mathematical domains include thermodynamics, statistical physics, and algebra.\n- Concepts involved include Boltzmann distribution, energy level populations, and temperature-dependent excitation.\n- Such problems commonly arise in astrophysical spectroscopy and stellar atmosphere modeling.\n\n4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:\n- The problem does not explicitly state the value or role of Boltzmann\'s constant k, though it is implicitly involved.\n- The exact form of the equation relating excitation ratio to temperatures is not given, requiring assumptions about the underlying formula.\n- The notation in the candidate equations is somewhat ambiguous (e.g., whether (T1*T2)^2 means (T_1*T_2)^2 or T_1*(T_2)^2).\n- It is unclear if other factors (e.g., degeneracy, partition functions) are considered or neglected.\n- The problem assumes LTE, but the extent to which this simplifies the relation is not detailed..These are just pieces of information related to the question.

We observe N₁/N₂ = 2, so taking the natural logarithm gives\n   ln\u20092 = (ΔE/k)·(1/T₂ – 1/T₁).\n4. Given ΔE ≈ 1.38×10⁻²³\u2009J and k = 1.38×10⁻²³\u2009J/K, we have ΔE/k = 1\u2009K. Substituting yields\n   ln\u20092 = 1·(1/T₂ – 1/T₁) = (T₁ – T₂)/(T₁\u2009T₂).\n5. Comparing with the provided forms:\n   A) ln(2)=T₂/T₁ — incorrect.\n   B) ln(2)=(T₁–T₂)/(T₁\u2009T₂)² — extra square in denominator.\n   C) ln(2)=(T₁+T₂)/(T₁\u2009T₂) — sum instead of difference.\n   D) ln(2)=(T₁–T₂)/(T₁\u2009T₂) — exact match.\nTherefore, the correct equation is choice D.; answer: D)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCritic agent ZuUf, providing feedback, thinking: The solution is correct. Under LTE the excited‐state populations obey the Boltzmann law: N_exc∝exp(–ΔE/(kT)). Thus for the two stars,\n\nN₁/N₂ = exp[–ΔE/(kT₁)] / exp[–ΔE/(kT₂)] = exp[(ΔE/k)(1/T₂ – 1/T₁)].\n\nGiven N₁/N₂=2, take ln:\nln\u20092 = (ΔE/k)(1/T₂ – 1/T₁).\n\nNumerically ΔE≈1.38×10⁻²³\u2009J and k=1.38×10⁻²³\u2009J/K so ΔE/k=1\u2009K. Hence\nln\u20092 = 1·(1/T₂ – 1/T₁) = (T₁–T₂)/(T₁T₂).\n\nComparing with the choices shows choice 4 (ln 2 = (T₁–T₂)/(T₁\u2009T₂)) is an exact match.
