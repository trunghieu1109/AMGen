proposed answer: To rank the six monosubstituted benzenes by increasing weight fraction of the para-bromo isomer, we consider: 1) directing effect (ortho/para vs. meta), 2) activation/deactivation strength, 3) steric hindrance at ortho positions (which shifts substitution toward para).

1) Nitrobenzene (4, –NO2): strongest deactivator (–I and –R), strict meta-director → virtually no para product → lowest para fraction.

2) Ethyl benzoate (2, –COOEt) vs. Benzoic acid (6, –COOH): both are meta-directing deactivators (–I and –R). Hammett σm shows –COOEt (~+0.45) is more withdrawing than –COOH (~+0.37), so ester deactivates more and gives even less para product than the acid. Thus order: 4 < 2 < 6.

3) Chlorobenzene (3, –Cl): deactivating via –I but ortho/para-directing via resonance; small size means ortho sites are accessible, yielding a moderate para fraction. So it ranks above all meta-directors: 4 < 2 < 6 < 3.

4) Toluene (1, –CH3): weakly activating (+I and hyperconjugation), ortho/para-director; small methyl group gives both ortho and para products but still a high para percentage relative to deactivated rings. So: 4 < 2 < 6 < 3 < 1.

5) Ethylbenzene (5, –C2H5): similar activation to methyl but bulkier, causing greater steric hindrance at ortho positions and further favoring para substitution → highest para fraction. Final order: 4 < 2 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5, which corresponds to choice B).

proposed answer: We need to rank the six benzene derivatives by their expected para-bromination weight fraction under Br₂/FeBr₃ catalysis. Step 1: List each substituent’s electronic effect (Hammett σₚ), directing influence, and steric bias:
• 4) –NO₂ (σₚ ≈ +0.78): strongest deactivator, meta-director → almost no para product (lowest fraction).
• 6) –COOH (σₚ ≈ +0.45): deactivating meta-director; further deactivation by FeBr₃ coordination → very low para fraction, slightly above nitro.
• 2) –COOEt (σₚ ≈ +0.45): deactivating meta-director; weaker Lewis-acid binding than –COOH and ortho steric hindrance slightly favors para vs meta → para fraction above –COOH but still low.
• 1) –CH₃ (σₚ = –0.17): weak activator, ortho/para-director; minimal ortho steric hindrance → moderate para fraction.
• 5) –C₂H₅ (σₚ ≈ –0.15): weak activator, ortho/para-director; greater ortho steric hindrance than methyl → shifts more substitution to para, so para fraction > toluene.
• 3) –Cl (σₚ ≈ +0.23): inductively deactivating but ortho/para-director by resonance; both electronic deactivation at ortho and steric hindrance strongly favor para → highest para fraction.
Step 2: Order from lowest to highest para-isomer fraction:
4 (NO₂) < 6 (COOH) < 2 (COOEt) < 1 (CH₃) < 5 (C₂H₅) < 3 (Cl).
Step 3: Match this sequence to the provided choices: choice D) is 4<6<2<1<5<3. Therefore, the final answer is D).
