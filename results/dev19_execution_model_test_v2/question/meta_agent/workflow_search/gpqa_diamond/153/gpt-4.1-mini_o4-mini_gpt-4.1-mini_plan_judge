proposed answer: 1. The mass spectrum shows M+ at m/z 156 (100%) and M+2 at 158 (32%), exactly the 3:1 ratio for one chlorine atom. Thus the formula is C7H5ClO2 (MW 156).
2. IR shows a broad 3500–2700 cm⁻¹ band (strong H-bonded O–H) and a sharp 1720 cm⁻¹ band (C=O). This combination is diagnostic of a carboxylic acid, ruling out aldehydes (no broad O–H) and esters (C=O at higher wavenumber, no O–H).
3. ¹H NMR has a singlet at 11.0 ppm (1H) for the acid proton and two doublets at 8.02 ppm (2H) and 7.72 ppm (2H) with J≈8 Hz, forming an AA′BB′ pattern. This indicates a para-disubstituted benzene ring with two sets of equivalent protons.
4. Evaluate candidates:
   A) 4-Chlorobenzoic acid fits C7H5ClO2, contains a carboxylic acid (broad O–H + C=O at 1720 cm⁻¹), and para substitution yields exactly two aromatic doublets of 2H each.
   B) 2-Chlorobenzoic acid also C7H5ClO2 but ortho substitution gives four nonequivalent aromatic protons with complex splitting, not two doublets.
   C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde has an aldehyde proton near 9–10 ppm, a phenolic OH (not broad acid O–H), and an unsymmetrical aromatic pattern.
   D) Phenyl chloroformate is an ester (no O–H band), C=O at ~1750–1800 cm⁻¹, and a monosubstituted phenyl ring (five aromatic protons), not two doublets.
5. Only 4-chlorobenzoic acid satisfies all spectral requirements—molecular weight/isotope pattern, IR carboxylic acid bands, and para-substituted NMR pattern.
