Question: Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.

proposed answer: The problem is to count the number of lattice paths from the lower-left corner to the upper-right corner on an 8x8 grid, moving only right or up, that have exactly four direction changes. Each path consists of 16 moves: 8 horizontal (right) and 8 vertical (up). A direction change occurs when the path switches from moving horizontally to vertically or vice versa. Having exactly four direction changes means the path is composed of exactly five segments alternating between horizontal and vertical directions. There are two possible segment patterns: starting with a horizontal segment (H-V-H-V-H) or starting with a vertical segment (V-H-V-H-V). For the first pattern, there are 3 horizontal segments and 2 vertical segments; for the second, 2 horizontal and 3 vertical segments. Each segment length is a positive integer, and the sums of horizontal segments and vertical segments must each be 8. The number of ways to partition an integer n into k positive parts is given by the binomial coefficient C(n-1, k-1). For the first pattern, the number of ways to partition the horizontal moves is C(7,2) = 21, and vertical moves is C(7,1) = 7, giving 21*7=147 ways. For the second pattern, the number of ways to partition horizontal moves is C(7,1) = 7, and vertical moves is C(7,2) = 21, again 7*21=147 ways. Adding both cases, the total number of such paths is 147 + 147 = 294. This count is consistent with the combinatorial reasoning and the constraints of the problem, ensuring exactly four direction changes and covering all possible paths that satisfy the conditions without overlap or omission. Therefore, the final numeric result representing the number of paths with exactly four direction changes is 294.
