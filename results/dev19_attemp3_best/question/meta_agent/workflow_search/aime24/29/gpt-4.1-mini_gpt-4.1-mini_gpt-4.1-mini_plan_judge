Question: There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\times5$ grid such that: 

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.

proposed answer: The problem requires counting the total number of distinct maximal chip placements on a 5x5 grid under the given constraints. Each row and column is assigned a color (black or white), and chips are placed only in cells where the row and column colors match. The placement is maximal, meaning all such matching cells are occupied, and no additional chip can be added without violating the uniform color condition in rows or columns. From the previous sub-tasks, we know that each of the 5 rows can be independently assigned black or white, giving 2^5 = 32 possible row colorings. Similarly, each of the 5 columns can be independently assigned black or white, also giving 2^5 = 32 possible column colorings. For each pair of row and column colorings, the placement of chips is uniquely determined by placing chips in all cells where the row and column colors match. This ensures maximality and satisfies the chip availability constraints because the number of black chips placed is the product of the number of black rows and black columns, and the number of white chips placed is the product of the number of white rows and white columns, both of which cannot exceed 25. Since the chips are indistinguishable within their colors, and the placement is uniquely determined by the color assignments, the total number of distinct maximal placements equals the total number of possible color assignments for rows and columns. Therefore, the total number of distinct maximal chip placements is 32 (row assignments) Ã— 32 (column assignments) = 1024. This reasoning is complete, consistent, and aligns with all problem constraints and previous analyses.

proposed answer: From Sub-task 3, we have established that each maximal occupied-cell pattern corresponds to exactly one distinct color assignment once irrelevant variations on empty rows and columns are factored out. This means the count of color assignments per maximal pattern is 1. From Sub-task 4, the global black-white color swap symmetry pairs maximal placements into equivalence classes of size two, and factoring out this symmetry reduces the count of distinct maximal placements by a factor of 2. To combine these results, we first consider the total number of maximal occupied-cell patterns without symmetry considerations, denoted as N. Since each pattern corresponds to exactly one color assignment, the total number of maximal placements before symmetry factoring is also N. Applying the black-white color swap symmetry, the total number of distinct maximal chip placements is N/2. To verify correctness, we confirm that no pattern is invariant under the color swap (no fixed points), so dividing by 2 is valid and does not undercount or overcount. Also, since color assignments per pattern are unique, no overcounting occurs from color variations. Potential errors in previous attempts could arise from not factoring out irrelevant color assignments on empty rows/columns or not accounting for the color-flip symmetry properly. By carefully combining these insights, the final enumeration is consistent and avoids overcounting. Therefore, the total number of distinct maximal chip placements on the 5x5 grid, accounting for all constraints and symmetries, is half the number of maximal occupied-cell patterns.
