Question: Rectangles $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are drawn such that $D,E,C,F$ are collinear. Also, $A,D,H,G$ all lie on a circle. If $BC=16$,$AB=107$,$FG=17$, and $EF=184$, what is the length of $CE$?
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_4_10
proposed answer: We start by placing rectangle ABCD in the coordinate plane with A at (0,0), B at (107,0), C at (107,16), and D at (0,16), consistent with the given side lengths AB=107 and BC=16. Points D, E, C, F are collinear on the line y=16, so E and F lie on y=16 with coordinates E(x,16) and F(x+184,16) since EF=184. Rectangle EFGH has side FG=17 perpendicular to EF, so G and H are vertically offset by 17 units from F and E, respectively, at y=33. Points A(0,0), D(0,16), H(x,33), and G(x+184,33) lie on a circle. The center of this circle (h,k) must satisfy equal distances to these four points. Using the concyclicity condition, we set up equations for the distances from the center to A, D, H, and G. Subtracting the distance equations for A and D gives k=8. Subtracting the distance equations for G and H gives x - h = -92, so h = x + 92. Substituting h and k into the distance equation for H leads to a quadratic equation in x: x^2 + 184x - 561 = 0. Solving this quadratic yields two solutions, x=3 and x=-187. Since E must lie between D(0,16) and C(107,16), x=3 is the valid solution. Therefore, the length CE = |107 - 3| = 104. This satisfies all geometric conditions and is consistent with the problem constraints.
