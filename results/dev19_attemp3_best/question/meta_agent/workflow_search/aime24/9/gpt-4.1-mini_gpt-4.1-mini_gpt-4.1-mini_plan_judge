Question: Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: Jen chooses 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1, 2, ..., 10}. The total number of 4-element subsets of S is C(10,4) = 210. The problem states that Jen wins a prize if the randomly chosen 4-element subset intersects her chosen subset J in at least 2 elements. From previous calculations, the number of subsets intersecting J in exactly 2 elements is 90, in exactly 3 elements is 24, and in exactly 4 elements is 1. Therefore, the total number of winning subsets (prize winners) is 90 + 24 + 1 = 115. The grand prize is won only if the randomly chosen subset exactly matches Jen's chosen subset J, which corresponds to intersection size 4, and there is only 1 such subset. Hence, the conditional probability of winning the grand prize given that Jen won a prize is the ratio of the number of subsets with intersection size 4 to the total number of subsets with intersection size at least 2, which is 1/115. This fraction is already in lowest terms since 1 and 115 share no common divisors other than 1. Therefore, m = 1 and n = 115, and the sum m + n = 116.
