The total number of 4-element subsets of S is C(10,4) = 210. The problem states that Jen wins a prize if the randomly chosen 4-element subset intersects her chosen subset J in at least 2 elements. From previous calculations, the number of subsets intersecting J in exactly 2 elements is 90, in exactly 3 elements is 24, and in exactly 4 elements is 1.

The grand prize is won only if the randomly chosen subset exactly matches Jen's chosen subset J, which corresponds to intersection size 4, and there is only 1 such subset.

This is a straightforward combination calculation: choosing 4 elements out of 10 without regard to order. Next, they all correctly computed the number of 4-element subsets that intersect Jen's chosen 4-element subset J in exactly 2 elements. The reasoning is as follows: To have exactly 2 elements in common with J, we must select 2 elements from J (C(4,2) = 6 ways) and 2 elements from the remaining 6 elements in S (since 10 - 4 = 6) (C(6,2) = 15 ways). Multiplying these gives 6 * 15 = 90 subsets. This step-by-step reasoning is consistent and mathematically sound.

There cannot be any other 4-element subset that contains all elements of J because any other subset would have to differ by at least one element, reducing the intersection size. Mathematically, the number of subsets intersecting J in exactly 4 elements is the number of ways to choose all 4 elements from J (which is C(4,4) = 1) and 0 elements from the remaining 6 elements (which is C(6,0) = 1). Multiplying these gives 1*1 = 1.
