Question: Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.

proposed answer: The problem is to find the smallest sphere radius r that can contain any rectangular box with surface area 54 and volume 23. The radius r of the smallest enclosing sphere is half the space diagonal of the box, so r^2 = (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)/4. The constraints are surface area: 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54, so xy + yz + zx = 27, and volume: xyz = 23. From the previous sub-task, the maximum diagonal squared D^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 occurs when two sides are equal, x = y = 2, and z = 23/(2*2) = 23/4 = 5.75. Checking the surface area constraint: xy + yz + zx = 2*2 + 2*5.75 + 2*5.75 = 4 + 11.5 + 11.5 = 27, which satisfies the constraint. Calculate D^2: 2^2 + 2^2 + (23/4)^2 = 4 + 4 + 529/16 = 8 + 33.0625 = 41.0625. Expressing 41.0625 as a fraction: 41 + 1/16 = (656/16) + (1/16) = 657/16. Then r^2 = D^2 / 4 = (657/16) / 4 = 657/64. The fraction 657/64 is in lowest terms because 657 factors as 3^2 * 73 and 64 = 2^6, so numerator and denominator share no common factors. Therefore, p = 657, q = 64, and p + q = 721. This is consistent with all constraints and the maximizing diagonal solution, and the fraction is simplified properly.
