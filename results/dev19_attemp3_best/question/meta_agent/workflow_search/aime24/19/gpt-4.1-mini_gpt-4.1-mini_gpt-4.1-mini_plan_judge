Question: Let $\omega\neq 1$ be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\]
is divided by 1000.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_13_19
proposed answer: From Sub-task 4, we have determined that the exact value of the product \( \prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) \) is 8321. The problem now asks for the remainder when this product is divided by 1000. To find this remainder, we compute 8321 modulo 1000. Since 8321 divided by 1000 gives a quotient of 8 and a remainder of 321, the remainder is 321. This step is straightforward and consistent with the problem constraints. The calculation is verified by the division: 8321 = 8 * 1000 + 321. Therefore, the final answer is 321.
