Question: Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.

proposed answer: We are given four items: diamond rings (D), golf clubs (G), garden spades (S), and candy hearts (C). Every one of the 900 residents owns candy hearts, so |C| = 900, making candy hearts a universal set. The other three sets have sizes |D| = 195, |G| = 367, and |S| = 562. We know 437 residents own exactly two items and 234 own exactly three items. Since candy hearts are universal, owning exactly two items means owning candy hearts plus exactly one of D, G, or S; owning exactly three items means candy hearts plus exactly two of D, G, S; owning exactly one item means candy hearts only; owning exactly four items means candy hearts plus all three of D, G, and S. Let x be the number of residents owning all four items. We define variables: a = number owning candy hearts only (exactly one item), b = number owning candy hearts plus exactly one of D, G, S (exactly two items) = 437, c = number owning candy hearts plus exactly two of D, G, S (exactly three items) = 234, d = number owning all four items = x. Total residents: a + b + c + d = 900. The sum of owners of D, G, S is 195 + 367 + 562 = 1124. Using inclusion-exclusion for D, G, S: sum of pairwise intersections = P, triple intersection = x. Number owning exactly two of D, G, S (which corresponds to exactly three items including candy hearts) is c = P - 3x = 234. Number owning exactly one of D, G, S (which corresponds to exactly two items including candy hearts) is b = (sum of singles) - 2P + 3x = 437. Substituting sum of singles = 1124, we get two equations: 234 = P - 3x and 437 = 1124 - 2P + 3x. From the first, P = 234 + 3x. Substitute into the second: 437 = 1124 - 2(234 + 3x) + 3x = 1124 - 468 - 6x + 3x = 656 - 3x. So 3x = 656 - 437 = 219, x = 73. Then a = 900 - (b + c + d) = 900 - (437 + 234 + 73) = 156. Therefore, 73 residents own all four items. This conclusion is consistent with the inclusion-exclusion principle, the given counts, and the universal ownership of candy hearts.
