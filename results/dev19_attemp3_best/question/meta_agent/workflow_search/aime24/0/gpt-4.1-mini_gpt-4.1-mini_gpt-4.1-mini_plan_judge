Question: Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.

proposed answer: We are given that Aya walks 9 kilometers and stops at a coffee shop for t minutes. The total time for the walk plus coffee is given for two different speeds: s km/h and s+2 km/h. From the problem, when walking at speed s, the total time is 4 hours (240 minutes), and when walking at speed s+2, the total time is 2 hours 24 minutes (144 minutes). Both include the same coffee time t. 

First, we express the walking times at speeds s and s+2 as (9/s) hours and (9/(s+2)) hours respectively. The total times including coffee are:
- At speed s: (9/s) hours + t minutes = 4 hours
- At speed s+2: (9/(s+2)) hours + t minutes = 2 hours 24 minutes

Converting coffee time t to hours (t/60), we get two equations:
9/s + t/60 = 4
9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4

Subtracting the second from the first:
9/s - 9/(s+2) = 1.6

Solving this gives s = 2.5 km/h and t = 24 minutes.

Next, for speed s + 0.5 = 3.0 km/h, the walking time is 9/3 = 3 hours = 180 minutes.

Adding coffee time t = 24 minutes, total time = 180 + 24 = 204 minutes.

This total time is consistent with the problem constraints because it lies between the two given total times (240 minutes at s=2.5 km/h and 144 minutes at s=4.5 km/h), which makes sense as the speed 3.0 km/h is between 2.5 and 4.5 km/h. The coffee time remains constant, and the walking time decreases as speed increases, which aligns with the problem's conditions.

Therefore, the computed total time of 204 minutes for speed s + 0.5 km/h is consistent and correct.
