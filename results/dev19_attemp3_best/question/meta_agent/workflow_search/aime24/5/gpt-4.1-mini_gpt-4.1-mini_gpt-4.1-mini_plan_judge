Question: Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.

proposed answer: The inradius r of a tetrahedron is given by the formula r = 3V / S, where V is the volume and S is the total surface area. From Sub-task 3, the volume V was determined to be 36, and the total surface area S was found to be 110. Plugging these values into the formula gives r = 3 * 36 / 110 = 108 / 110 = 54 / 55. This fraction is already in simplest form because 54 and 55 share no common prime factors (54 = 2 * 3^3, 55 = 5 * 11). The problem requires expressing the inradius in the form (m * sqrt(n)) / p, where m and p are coprime positive integers and n is a positive square-free integer. Since the inradius is rational, it can be written as (54 * sqrt(1)) / 55, with m = 54, n = 1, and p = 55. The integer 1 is square-free by definition. Therefore, the sum m + n + p = 54 + 1 + 55 = 110. This satisfies all the problem's conditions and is the simplified form of the inradius expression.

proposed answer: The inradius r of a tetrahedron is given by the formula r = 3V / S, where V is the volume and S is the total surface area. From the previous subtasks, the volume V is given as 72 * sqrt(2) and the total surface area S is 24 * sqrt(21). Substituting these values into the formula, we get r = 3 * (72 * sqrt(2)) / (24 * sqrt(21)) = (216 * sqrt(2)) / (24 * sqrt(21)) = 9 * sqrt(2) / sqrt(21). To express this in the form (m * sqrt(n)) / p, we rationalize the denominator: r = 9 * sqrt(2) / sqrt(21) = 9 * sqrt(2) * sqrt(21) / 21 = 9 * sqrt(42) / 21. Simplifying the fraction 9/21 to 3/7, we get r = (3 * sqrt(42)) / 7. Here, m = 3, n = 42, and p = 7. The number 42 factors as 2 * 3 * 7, which is square-free (no prime squared divides 42). Also, 3 and 7 are relatively prime, satisfying the problem's conditions. Therefore, the simplified inradius expression is (3 * sqrt(42)) / 7. The sum m + n + p = 3 + 42 + 7 = 52. This is the exact simplified form and sum required by the problem.
