Question: Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.

proposed answer: From the previous analysis, the losing positions (P-positions) for the game where a player can remove either 1 or 4 tokens are exactly those positive integers n for which n mod 5 equals 0 or 2. This was established by examining the base cases and using the recursive definition of winning and losing positions. The pattern was verified by induction and checking initial values. For n ≤ 2024, the losing positions are all n such that n mod 5 = 0 or n mod 5 = 2. To count these, we consider the numbers from 1 to 2024. The numbers divisible by 5 (n mod 5 = 0) are 5, 10, 15, ..., up to the largest multiple of 5 less than or equal to 2024. The largest multiple of 5 ≤ 2024 is 2020 (since 2024/5 = 404.8). So there are 404 numbers where n mod 5 = 0. For n mod 5 = 2, these numbers are 2, 7, 12, ..., up to the largest number ≤ 2024 with remainder 2 when divided by 5. The largest such number is 2022 (since 2022 mod 5 = 2). To count these, note that the sequence starts at 2 and increments by 5 each time. The number of terms is ((2022 - 2)/5) + 1 = (2020/5) + 1 = 404 + 1 = 405. Therefore, the total number of losing positions for n ≤ 2024 is 404 + 405 = 809. This count corresponds to the initial states where Bob has a winning strategy, as these are the positions where Alice, who moves first, is in a losing position. This reasoning is complete and consistent with the pattern and boundary checks.
