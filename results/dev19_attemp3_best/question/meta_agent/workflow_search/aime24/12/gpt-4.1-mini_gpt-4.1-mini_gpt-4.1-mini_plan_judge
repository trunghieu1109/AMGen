Question: Find the largest possible real part of \[(75+117i)z+\frac{96+144i}{z}\]where $z$ is a complex number with $|z|=4$.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_1_12
proposed answer: We are given the expression (75+117i)z + (96+144i)/z with the constraint |z|=4. We want to verify the maximum real part found previously, which is 540, and confirm it is consistent with the problem conditions. Step 1: Express z in polar form as z = 4(cos θ + i sin θ). Step 2: Substitute into the expression and separate the real part, which was found to be 324 cos θ - 432 sin θ. Step 3: Combine into a single cosine function with amplitude R = sqrt(324^2 + (-432)^2) = 540 and phase shift φ = -arctan(4/3). Step 4: The maximum value of the cosine function is 1, so the maximum real part is 540, attained at θ = -arctan(4/3). Step 5: Check the constraint |z|=4 is satisfied by the chosen z since z = 4(cos θ + i sin θ) always has magnitude 4 regardless of θ. Step 6: Confirm no algebraic or trigonometric errors in the derivation. The amplitude calculation and phase shift are correct, and the maximum value of cosine is indeed 1. Step 7: The problem is well-posed and the maximum real part is achievable for some θ, so the solution is consistent with the problem conditions. Therefore, the maximum real part of the given expression under the constraint |z|=4 is 540, and this value is consistent and verified.
