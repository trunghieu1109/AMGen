Question: Find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid so that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is $999$, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is $99$. The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$.
\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\ \hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\ \hline \end{array}\]

proposed answer: We define the digits in the 2x3 grid as a,b,c in the first row and d,e,f in the second row, each digit from 0 to 9. The problem gives two conditions: (1) The sum of the two three-digit numbers formed by the rows equals 999, i.e., (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999. (2) The sum of the three two-digit numbers formed by the columns equals 99, i.e., (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99.

Step 1: From the first condition, rewrite as 100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999. Since each digit is between 0 and 9, the sums (a+d), (b+e), (c+f) are between 0 and 18. To get exactly 999, the natural decomposition is (a + d) = 9, (b + e) = 9, (c + f) = 9, because 100*9 + 10*9 + 9 = 999.

Step 2: Substitute d = 9 - a, e = 9 - b, f = 9 - c into the second condition: (10a + (9 - a)) + (10b + (9 - b)) + (10c + (9 - c)) = 99. Simplify each term: (9a + 9) + (9b + 9) + (9c + 9) = 99. Summing gives 9(a + b + c) + 27 = 99. Subtract 27: 9(a + b + c) = 72. Divide by 9: a + b + c = 8.

Step 3: The digits a,b,c are from 0 to 9, summing to 8. Since 8 ≤ 9, no digit exceeds 9, so all are valid.

Step 4: Count the number of nonnegative integer solutions to a + b + c = 8 with digits 0 to 9. Using stars and bars theorem, the number of solutions is C(8 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(10, 2) = 45.

Step 5: For each triple (a,b,c), the triple (d,e,f) is uniquely determined as (9 - a, 9 - b, 9 - c), which are valid digits since a,b,c ≤ 9.

Therefore, the total number of valid digit assignments satisfying both sum constraints is 45. This reasoning is consistent, complete, and avoids carry-over complications by direct sum decomposition, reducing the problem to counting integer solutions, which is efficient and accurate.
