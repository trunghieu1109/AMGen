Question: A list of positive integers has the following properties:
$\bullet$ The sum of the items in the list is $30$.
$\bullet$ The unique mode of the list is $9$.
$\bullet$ The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.
Find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

proposed answer: The problem states that the list of positive integers has a sum of 30, a unique mode of 9, and a median that is a positive integer not present in the list. To satisfy the median condition, the list length must be even, so the median is the average of the two middle numbers. For the median to be an integer not in the list, the two middle numbers must differ by 2, making their average an integer that does not appear in the list. The mode 9 must appear more times than any other number, so it must appear at least twice. Considering the sum constraint and the mode uniqueness, the list [5, 7, 9, 9] fits all conditions: sum is 5+7+9+9=30, mode is 9 appearing twice uniquely, median is (7+9)/2=8 which is not in the list, and all numbers are positive integers. Calculating the sum of squares: 5^2 + 7^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 = 25 + 49 + 81 + 81 = 236. No other valid list satisfies all conditions. Therefore, the sum of the squares of all items in the valid list is 236.
