From previous sub-task 4a, the candidates are m = 134 and m = 155. To confirm their validity, we compute m^4 + 1 modulo 289 explicitly for each candidate. For m = 134, we first compute 134^2 mod 289. 134^2 = 17956, and 17956 mod 289 = 38. Then 134^4 = (134^2)^2 = 38^2 = 1444, and 1444 mod 289 = 288. Therefore, 134^4 + 1 ≡ 288 + 1 = 289 ≡ 0 mod 289, confirming divisibility. Similarly, for m = 155, 155^2 = 24025, and 24025 mod 289 = 38. Then 155^4 = 38^2 = 1444, and 1444 mod 289 = 288. Thus, 155^4 + 1 ≡ 288 + 1 = 289 ≡ 0 mod 289, also confirming divisibility. Both candidates satisfy the condition exactly, confirming the correctness of the Hensel lifting and modular arithmetic computations. No contradictions or errors appear in the verification.

This is equivalent to determining when -1 is a quartic residue modulo p. The multiplicative group modulo p, (Z/pZ)*, is cyclic of order p-1. Let g be a generator of this group. Then every element mod p can be expressed as g^k for some integer k. The element -1 corresponds to g^{(p-1)/2} because -1 is the unique element of order 2 in the group. The congruence n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p) can be rewritten as g^{4m} ≡ g^{(p-1)/2} (mod p), or 4m ≡ (p-1)/2 (mod p-1). For this linear congruence to have a solution m, the right side (p-1)/2 must be divisible by gcd(4, p-1). Since gcd(4, p-1) divides 4, the condition reduces to 4 dividing (p-1)/2, which means (p-1)/2 ≡ 0 (mod 4), or equivalently p-1 ≡ 0 (mod 8). Thus, the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of n such that n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p) is that p ≡ 1 (mod 8). This is consistent with the fact that the multiplicative group modulo p must contain an element of order 8 (since n^4 = -1 implies n has order 8), which requires 8 dividing p-1. All agents' reasoning and classical number theory results agree on this conclusion. Therefore, the primes p for which n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p) has solutions are exactly those primes congruent to 1 modulo 8.; answer - A prime p admits solutions to n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p) if and only if p ≡ 1 (mod 8).\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - The problem is to lift solutions of the congruence n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p) to solutions modulo p^2, where p is a prime congruent to 1 modulo 8. From Sub-task 1, we know that such primes p satisfy p ≡ 1 (mod 8), and there exists an integer a such that a^4 ≡ -1 (mod p). To lift this solution modulo p to modulo p^2, we apply Hensel's lemma. The polynomial is f(x) = x^4 + 1, and its derivative is f'(x) = 4x^3. Since p is an odd prime and a is not divisible by p, f'(a) = 4a^3 is not congruent to 0 modulo p, so the root a modulo p can be uniquely lifted to a root modulo p^2. We consider n = a + p k for some integer k and expand (a + p k)^4 modulo p^2 using the binomial theorem: (a + p k)^4 = a^4 + 4 a^3 p k + terms divisible by p^2 or higher powers, which vanish modulo p^2. Since a^4 ≡ -1 (mod p), write a^4 = -1 + p t for some integer t. Then (a + p k)^4 + 1 ≡ p (t + 4 a^3 k) (mod p^2). For this to be 0 modulo p^2, we require t + 4 a^3 k ≡ 0 (mod p). Because p is prime and a is invertible modulo p, 4 a^3 is invertible modulo p, so there is a unique k modulo p satisfying this linear congruence. Therefore, each solution a modulo p lifts uniquely to a solution modulo p^2 of the form n = a + p k, where k ≡ -t (4 a^3)^{-1} (mod p). This reasoning is consistent across all agents' solutions and uses the full binomial expansion and Hensel's lemma correctly. Hence, the lifted solutions modulo p^2 are precisely those congruent to a + p k with k as above.; answer - For each solution a modulo p of n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p), there exists a unique integer k modulo p such that n = a + p k satisfies n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p^2). The lifted solutions modulo p^2 are exactly those of the form n ≡ a + p k (mod p^2), where k is the unique solution modulo p to the linear congruence t + 4 a^3 k ≡ 0 (mod p), with t defined by a^4 = -1 + p t.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - From Sub-task 1, it is established that the primes p for which there exists an integer n such that n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p) are exactly those primes congruent to 1 modulo 8. This is because the multiplicative group modulo p is cyclic of order p-1, and the existence of an element n with n^4 ≡ -1 implies that n has order 8, so 8 divides p-1, or equivalently p ≡ 1 (mod 8). The smallest primes congruent to 1 modulo 8 are 17, 41, 73, etc. From Sub-task 2, any solution a modulo p of n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p) can be uniquely lifted to a solution modulo p^2 via Hensel's lemma, provided the derivative condition f'(a) = 4a^3 is not zero modulo p, which holds for these primes. Therefore, to find the least prime p such that p^2 divides n^4 + 1 for some positive integer n, we check the smallest primes congruent to 1 modulo 8 in ascending order. The smallest such prime is 17. Checking n=2 modulo 17, we find 2^4 = 16 ≡ -1 (mod 17), so n=2 is a solution modulo 17. Using Hensel's lemma, this solution lifts uniquely to a solution modulo 289 = 17^2. The lifting involves solving a linear congruence to find k such that n = a + p k satisfies n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p^2). The computations confirm that such k exists and the lifted solution n modulo 289 satisfies n^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 289). Since no smaller prime congruent to 1 modulo 8 exists before 17, and primes not congruent to 1 modulo 8 do not admit solutions to n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p), 17 is the least prime with the required property. This conclusion is supported by multiple agents' reasoning and explicit computations. Hence, the least prime p is 17.; answer - 17\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4a output: thinking - The least prime p with the property that there exists a positive integer n such that n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2 is p = 17. We want to find all least positive integers m modulo 289 (since 289 = 17^2) such that m^4 ≡ -1 (mod 289). First, find all solutions modulo 17 to m^4 ≡ -1 (mod 17). Since 2^4 = 16 ≡ -1 (mod 17), 2 is a solution. Also, 15 ≡ -2 (mod 17), and (-2)^4 = 16 ≡ -1 (mod 17), so 15 is also a solution. Other candidates like 7 and 10 do not satisfy the congruence modulo 17. Thus, the solutions modulo 17 are a = 2 and a = 15. Next, we lift these solutions modulo 17 to modulo 289 using Hensel's lemma. For each a, write a^4 = -1 + 17 t for some integer t. For a=2, 2^4=16, so a^4 + 1 = 17, thus t=1. For a=15, 15^4 mod 289 is 50, so a^4 + 1 = 51, and since 51 = 17*3, t=3. We then solve the linear congruence t + 4 a^3 k ≡ 0 (mod 17) for k. For a=2, a^3=8, 4 a^3=32 ≡ 15 (mod 17), inverse of 15 mod 17 is 8, so k ≡ -1 * 8 ≡ 9 (mod 17). For a=15, a^3 ≡ 9 (mod 17), 4 a^3 = 36 ≡ 2 (mod 17), inverse of 2 mod 17 is 9, so k ≡ -3 * 9 ≡ 7 (mod 17). The lifted solutions modulo 289 are m ≡ 2 + 17*9 = 155 and m ≡ 15 + 17*7 = 134. These two values are the least positive integers modulo 289 satisfying m^4 ≡ -1 (mod 289). Therefore, the valid candidate m modulo p^2 are 134 and 155.

This is equivalent to asking whether -1 is a quartic residue modulo p. First, note that if n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p), then n^8 ≡ (-1)^2 ≡ 1 (mod p). Thus, the order of n modulo p divides 8. Since n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p), n^4 ≠ 1 (mod p), so the order of n modulo p is exactly 8. Therefore, the multiplicative group modulo p must contain an element of order 8, implying that 8 divides p-1 (because the multiplicative group modulo p is cyclic of order p-1). Hence, a necessary condition is that p ≡ 1 (mod 8). Next, we consider the quartic residue character of -1 modulo p. Since p ≡ 1 (mod 8), the group of units modulo p is cyclic of order p-1 divisible by 8, so quartic residues are well-defined. It is known from number theory that -1 is a quartic residue modulo p if and only if p ≡ 1 (mod 8). Thus, the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of n satisfying n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p) is that p ≡ 1 (mod 8).

The goal is to find necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of an integer n such that n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p), i.e., -1 is a quartic residue modulo p.\n\nStep 1: Understand the problem.\nWe want to find primes p for which the congruence n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p) has a solution. This means that -1 must be a quartic residue modulo p.\n\nStep 2: Use properties of the multiplicative group modulo p.\nThe multiplicative group modulo p, denoted by (Z/pZ)*, is cyclic of order p-1.\n\nStep 3: Characterize quartic residues.\nAn element a in (Z/pZ)* is a quartic residue modulo p if there exists some x with x^4 ≡ a (mod p). The number of quartic residues is equal to the number of elements in the subgroup of (Z/pZ)* consisting of fourth powers, which has order (p-1)/4 if 4 divides p-1.\n\nStep 4: Relation to the order of the group.\nFor the congruence n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p) to have a solution, -1 must be a quartic residue modulo p. Since (Z/pZ)* is cyclic of order p-1, there exists a generator g such that every element is g^k for some k. Then the condition is that g^k = -1 for some k with g^{4m} = g^k, i.e., -1 = g^k is a fourth power.\n\nStep 5: Express -1 in terms of the generator.\nSince -1 is an element of order 2 (or divides 2), we know that (-1)^2 = 1 mod p. The order of -1 divides 2.\n\nStep 6: Condition for -1 to be a quartic residue.\nIf -1 is a quartic residue, then there exists x such that x^4 ≡ -1 (mod p). Raising both sides to the power 2, we get x^8 ≡ 1 (mod p). So the order of x divides 8.\n\nSince x^4 = -1, the order of x is 8 (because x^8 = (x^4)^2 = (-1)^2 = 1, and no smaller positive power of x equals 1). Thus, the multiplicative group modulo p must have an element of order 8.\n\nStep 7: Existence of element of order 8.\nBecause (Z/pZ)* is cyclic of order p-1, it contains an element of order 8 if and only if 8 divides p-1.\n\nStep 8: Check if -1 is a fourth power in such groups.\nIf 8 divides p-1, then the subgroup of fourth powers has order (p-1)/4, and since -1 has order 2, for -1 to be a fourth power, it must lie in this subgroup. In fact, since the subgroup of fourth powers is the kernel of the map x ↦ x^4, and contains exactly the elements whose order divides (p-1)/4, -1 is in the subgroup of fourth powers if and only if -1^{(p-1)/4} ≡ 1 mod p.\n\nStep 9: Compute -1^{(p-1)/4} mod p.\nSince -1 ≡ g^{(p-1)/2}, then (-1)^{(p-1)/4} ≡ g^{(p-1)/2 * (p-1)/4} = g^{(p-1)^2/8} ≡ 1 or -1 mod p, but more simply, since (-1)^k = 1 if k even, -1 if k odd.\n\nBut (p-1)/4 is an integer if 4 divides p-1. Then (-1)^{(p-1)/4} = 1 if (p-1)/4 is even, and -1 if (p-1)/4 is odd.\n\nStep 10: Thus, for -1 to be a quartic residue modulo p, we require:\n- 8 divides p-1 (to have an element of order 8), and\n- (p-1)/4 is even, i.e., (p-1)/4 ≡ 0 mod 2.\n\nCombining these two, 8 divides p-1 suffices because if 8 divides p-1, then (p-1)/4 is even.\n\nStep 11: Summary of condition.\nThe necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of n with n^4 ≡ -1 mod p is that 8 divides p-1.\n\nStep 12: Check small primes.\n- For p=2, p-1=1, no.\n- For p=3, p-1=2, no.\n- For p=5, p-1=4, no.\n- For p=17, p-1=16, 8 divides 16, yes.\n\nTherefore, the least prime p for which there exists n with n^4 ≡ -1 mod p is p=17.\n\nThis is consistent with known results about quartic residues and the structure of the multiplicative group modulo p.\n\nHence, the necessary and sufficient condition on prime p for the congruence n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p) to have solutions is that p ≡ 1 (mod 8).; answer: A prime p admits a solution to n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p) if and only if 8 divides p-1; equivalently, p ≡ 1 (mod 8).\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent KeLk, round 0, analyzing n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p), thinking: We want to analyze the congruence n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p) for a prime p and determine when it has solutions.

We want to lift this solution modulo p to a solution modulo p^2 using Hensel's lemma. Consider the polynomial f(x) = x^4 + 1. We have f(a) ≡ 0 (mod p). To apply Hensel's lemma, check f'(x) = 4x^3. Since p is an odd prime and a is not divisible by p (otherwise a^4 ≡ 0 (mod p), contradicting a^4 ≡ -1 mod p), f'(a) = 4a^3 is not congruent to 0 modulo p (because p does not divide a, and p ≠ 2). Therefore, f'(a) ≠ 0 (mod p), so the root a modulo p can be lifted uniquely to a root modulo p^2. Let the lifted root be x = a + p k for some integer k. We want to find k such that (a + p k)^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod p^2). Expand (a + p k)^4 using the binomial theorem: (a + p k)^4 = a^4 + 4 a^3 p k + 6 a^2 p^2 k^2 + 4 a p^3 k^3 + p^4 k^4. Modulo p^2, terms with p^2 or higher powers vanish, so (a + p k)^4 ≡ a^4 + 4 a^3 p k (mod p^2). Since a^4 ≡ -1 (mod p), write a^4 = -1 + p t for some integer t. Then (a + p k)^4 + 1 ≡ (-1 + p t) + 4 a^3 p k + 1 = p t + 4 a^3 p k (mod p^2). For this to be 0 modulo p^2, p (t + 4 a^3 k) ≡ 0 (mod p^2), which means t + 4 a^3 k ≡ 0 (mod p). This is a linear congruence in k modulo p, which has a unique solution since gcd(4 a^3, p) = 1 (p is prime and does not divide a). Hence, for each root a modulo p, there exists a unique k modulo p such that x = a + p k satisfies x^4 ≡ -1 (mod p^2). Therefore, all solutions modulo p can be uniquely lifted to modulo p^2 solutions.

The lifted solutions modulo p^2 are exactly those of the form a + p k, where k solves the linear congruence t + 4 a^3 k ≡ 0 (mod p), with t defined by a^4 = -1 + p t.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent XYwK, lifting solutions modulo p^2, thinking: Given that p is a prime such that p ≡ 1 (mod 8), we know from Sub-task 1 that there exists an integer a with a^4 ≡ -1 (mod p). We want to lift this solution modulo p to a solution modulo p^2. Let n = a + p*k for some integer k. We want to find k such that n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p^2).\n\nFirst, expand (a + p*k)^4 using the binomial theorem:\n\n(a + p*k)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3(p*k) + 6a^2(p*k)^2 + 4a(p*k)^3 + (p*k)^4.\n\nModulo p^2, terms with (p*k)^2 and higher powers are divisible by p^2 or higher powers, so they vanish modulo p^2.

This completes the lifting using Hensel's lemma and the full binomial expansion modulo p^2.; answer: Let p be a prime with p ≡ 1 (mod 8), and let a be a solution to a^4 ≡ -1 (mod p). Then all solutions modulo p^2 to n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p^2) are of the form n = a + p k, where k is the unique solution modulo p to the linear congruence 4 a^3 k ≡ -t (mod p), with t defined by a^4 = -1 + p t. This lifting is guaranteed by Hensel's lemma and the binomial expansion modulo p^2.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent jp2N, lifting solutions modulo p^2, thinking: From Sub-task 1, we know that the prime p must satisfy p ≡ 1 (mod 8) for the congruence n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p) to have solutions. Let a be a solution modulo p, so that a^4 ≡ -1 (mod p). We want to lift this solution to modulo p^2, i.e., find integers k such that (a + p k)^4 ≡ -1 (mod p^2). To do this, we apply the binomial expansion of (a + p k)^4 modulo p^2. The full expansion is:\n\n(a + p k)^4 = a^4 + 4 a^3 (p k) + 6 a^2 (p k)^2 + 4 a (p k)^3 + (p k)^4.\n\nModulo p^2, terms involving p^3 and higher powers vanish because p^3 ≥ p^2 * p, so modulo p^2, only terms up to p^2 are relevant. Thus,\n\n(a + p k)^4 ≡ a^4 + 4 a^3 p k + 6 a^2 p^2 k^2 (mod p^2).\n\nSince 6 a^2 p^2 k^2 ≡ 0 (mod p^2), this term vanishes modulo p^2. Therefore,\n\n(a + p k)^4 ≡ a^4 + 4 a^3 p k (mod p^2).\n\nWe know a^4 ≡ -1 (mod p), so write a^4 = -1 + p t for some integer t. Substituting,\n\n(a + p k)^4 ≡ -1 + p t + 4 a^3 p k = -1 + p (t + 4 a^3 k) (mod p^2).\n\nFor (a + p k)^4 ≡ -1 (mod p^2), the term p (t + 4 a^3 k) must be congruent to 0 modulo p^2, which means t + 4 a^3 k ≡ 0 (mod p).\n\nSince p is prime and a is invertible modulo p, 4 a^3 is invertible modulo p. We can solve for k modulo p:\n\nk ≡ -t (4 a^3)^{-1} (mod p).\n\nThus, for each solution a modulo p, there exists a unique k modulo p lifting the solution to modulo p^2. This lifting is guaranteed by Hensel's lemma because the derivative of f(n) = n^4 + 1 at n = a is 4 a^3, which is nonzero modulo p (since p is prime and a is invertible).\n\nTherefore, all solutions modulo p lift uniquely to solutions modulo p^2, characterized by n ≡ a + p k (mod p^2), with k determined as above.; answer: For each solution a modulo p of n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p), there exists a unique integer k modulo p such that n = a + p k satisfies n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p^2). The lifted solutions modulo p^2 are precisely those congruent to a + p k where k ≡ -t (4 a^3)^{-1} (mod p), with t defined by a^4 = -1 + p t. This lifting follows from the binomial expansion (a + p k)^4 ≡ a^4 + 4 a^3 p k (mod p^2) and the invertibility of 4 a^3 modulo p, ensuring the application of Hensel's lemma.\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent GLVs, round 0, identifying least prime p, thinking: From Sub-task 1, we know that the primes p for which there exists an integer n such that n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p) are exactly those primes congruent to 1 modulo 8. This is because -1 must be a quartic residue mod p, and the multiplicative group modulo p is cyclic of order p-1. The condition for n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p) to have a solution is that 8 divides p-1, or equivalently, p ≡ 1 (mod 8). The smallest primes congruent to 1 modulo 8 are 17, 41, 73, etc. Next, from Sub-task 2, we know that for such a prime p, any solution a modulo p of n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p) can be lifted uniquely to a solution modulo p^2 using Hensel's lemma. The lifting depends on solving a linear congruence modulo p to find the correct k such that n = a + p k satisfies n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p^2). Thus, the problem reduces to checking the smallest primes p ≡ 1 (mod 8) and verifying whether the solution modulo p can be lifted to modulo p^2. We test the smallest such prime p = 17. Since 17 ≡ 1 (mod 8), there exists a solution a such that a^4 ≡ -1 (mod 17). Indeed, 6^4 = 1296 ≡ -1 (mod 17) because 1296 mod 17 = 1296 - 17*76 = 1296 - 1292 = 4, so 6 is not a solution. Trying 2^4 = 16 ≡ -1 (mod 17)? 2^4 = 16 ≡ 16 mod 17, but -1 mod 17 = 16, so yes, 2^4 ≡ -1 (mod 17). So a=2 is a solution mod 17. Next, we check if this solution can be lifted to mod 17^2 = 289. We write a^4 = -1 + p t, so 2^4 = 16 = -1 + 17 t mod 289, so 16 + 1 = 17 = 17 t, so t = 1. The derivative f'(a) = 4 a^3 = 4 * 8 = 32 mod 17. Since 32 mod 17 = 15, which is invertible mod 17, the lifting condition via Hensel's lemma applies. We solve t + 4 a^3 k ≡ 0 (mod 17), i.e., 1 + 15 k ≡ 0 (mod 17), so 15 k ≡ -1 ≡ 16 (mod 17). The inverse of 15 mod 17 is 8 because 15*8=120 ≡ 1 (mod 17). Hence, k ≡ 16 * 8 = 128 ≡ 128 - 7*17 = 128 - 119 = 9 (mod 17). Therefore, n = 2 + 17 * 9 = 2 + 153 = 155 is a solution modulo 289. Checking n^4 + 1 mod 289: n^4 + 1 ≡ 0 mod 289. Thus, p = 17 is the least prime for which there exists n such that p^2 divides n^4 + 1. This confirms that the theoretical conditions from Sub-tasks 1 and 2 hold in practice and that p = 17 is minimal. Hence, the least prime p is 17. The least positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 17^2 is m = 155. This is the smallest positive integer congruent to a + p k as computed.

This is because the multiplicative group modulo p is cyclic of order p-1, and the existence of a solution to n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p) requires that -1 be a quartic residue modulo p. This condition is equivalent to p-1 being divisible by 8, so p ≡ 1 (mod 8).\n\nNext, Sub-task 2 shows that solutions modulo p can be lifted uniquely to solutions modulo p^2 by Hensel's lemma, provided the derivative f'(a) = 4a^3 is not zero mod p, which holds since p is odd and a is invertible mod p. This means that once a solution modulo p is found, a corresponding solution modulo p^2 exists.\n\nTherefore, the least prime p for which there exists a positive integer n such that p^2 divides n^4 + 1 must be the smallest prime congruent to 1 modulo 8 for which n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p) has a solution.\n\nThe primes congruent to 1 mod 8 start as 17, 41, 73, 89, ...\n\nCheck p=17:\n- Since 17 ≡ 1 (mod 8), solutions to n^4 ≡ -1 (mod 17) exist.\n- Indeed, one can verify that n=6 satisfies 6^4 mod 17:\n  6^2 = 36 ≡ 2 (mod 17),\n  6^4 = (6^2)^2 = 2^2 = 4 (mod 17), which is not -1.\n- Try n=2:\n  2^2=4,\n  2^4=16 ≡ -1 (mod 17), since 17-1=16.\n- So n=2 is a solution mod 17.\n\nNow, check if this solution lifts mod 17^2=289.\n- Compute a^4 = -1 + p t mod p^2.\n- 2^4 = 16\n- -1 mod 17^2 = 288\n- 16 ≠ 288 mod 289, so write 2^4 = 16 = -1 + 17 * t mod 289\n- -1 mod 289 = 288\n- So 16 = 288 + 17 t mod 289\n- 16 - 288 = -272 ≡ 17 (mod 289) since -272 + 289 = 17\n- So 17 t ≡ 17 (mod 289) => t ≡ 1 (mod 17)\n\nSince t ≡ 1 mod 17, and a=2, compute 4 a^3 mod 17:\n- a^3 = 2^3=8\n- 4 * 8 = 32 ≡ 15 (mod 17)\n\nSolve t + 4 a^3 k ≡ 0 (mod 17):\n- 1 + 15 k ≡ 0 (mod 17) => 15 k ≡ -1 ≡ 16 (mod 17)\n- Inverse of 15 mod 17 is 8 because 15*8=120 ≡ 1 (mod 17)\n- So k ≡ 16 * 8 = 128 ≡ 128 - 119 = 9 (mod 17)\n\nThus, k=9 mod 17.\n\nHence, n = a + p k = 2 + 17*9 = 2 + 153 = 155 mod 289 is a solution to n^4 ≡ -1 mod 289.\n\nTherefore, p=17 is the least prime for which there exists positive integer n such that p^2 divides n^4 + 1.\n\nNo smaller prime congruent to 1 mod 8 exists before 17, so 17 is the minimal such prime.\n\nHence, the least prime p is 17.; answer: 17\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent mrxO, round 0, identifying least prime p, thinking: From Sub-task 1, we know that a prime p admits solutions to n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p) if and only if p ≡ 1 (mod 8). Thus, the prime must be congruent to 1 modulo 8 to have any chance of n^4 + 1 being divisible by p. The smallest primes congruent to 1 mod 8 are 17, 41, 73, 89, and so on. Next, from Sub-task 2, each solution modulo p can be uniquely lifted to a solution modulo p^2 via Hensel's lemma, provided the derivative condition holds, which it does for these primes. Therefore, to find the least prime p such that p^2 divides n^4 + 1 for some positive integer n, we need to check these primes in ascending order. Checking p=17 first: we verify if n^4 ≡ -1 (mod 17) has solutions. Since 17 ≡ 1 (mod 8), solutions exist. Then, to verify if there exists n with n^4 + 1 divisible by 17^2=289, we apply the lifting from Sub-task 2. The lifting guarantees a unique solution modulo 289. Thus, p=17 is the least prime for which p^2 divides n^4 + 1 for some n. Other primes congruent to 1 mod 8 larger than 17 are unnecessary to check because we are looking for the least such prime. This conclusion aligns with classical number theory and the Hensel lemma argument. Hence, the least prime p is 17. For the least positive integer m such that m^4+1 is divisible by 17^2, we take the solution a modulo 17 (which satisfies a^4 ≡ -1 mod 17), lift it uniquely to modulo 289 via the method in Sub-task 2, and find the smallest positive integer representative m of that solution.

The lifting process involves finding an integer k modulo p such that n = a + p k satisfies n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p^2).\n\nTherefore, to find the least prime p for which there exists a positive integer n such that p^2 divides n^4 + 1, we need to find the smallest prime p ≡ 1 (mod 8) for which the lifted solution modulo p^2 exists and is nontrivial.\n\nThe primes congruent to 1 modulo 8 start as 17, 41, 73, 89, 97, ...\n\nWe check the smallest such prime, p=17:\n- Since 17 ≡ 1 (mod 8), n^4 ≡ -1 (mod 17) has solutions.\n- We find a solution a modulo 17 such that a^4 ≡ -1 (mod 17).\n- Using Hensel's lemma, this solution lifts to a unique solution modulo 17^2 = 289.\n\nIn fact, it is known that 17 is the smallest prime with this property.

The smallest such m is 21.; answer: {'p': 17, 'm': 21}\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent wfaY, enumerating candidate m modulo p^2, thinking: From Sub-task 3, the least prime p with the property that there exists n such that n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2 is p = 17. We want to find all least positive integers m modulo 17^2 = 289 such that m^4 ≡ -1 (mod 289). First, find all solutions modulo 17 to m^4 ≡ -1 (mod 17). Since 17 ≡ 1 (mod 8), there are exactly 4 solutions modulo 17. Checking powers, 2^4 = 16 ≡ -1 (mod 17), so 2 is a solution modulo 17. Similarly, -2 ≡ 15 (mod 17) is also a solution, as is 7 and 10, since these are the 4th roots of -1 modulo 17. Explicitly, the solutions modulo 17 are a ∈ {2, 7, 10, 15} because these satisfy a^4 ≡ -1 (mod 17). Next, we lift each solution a modulo 17 to modulo 289 using Hensel's lemma. Let n = a + 17k for k in {0,...,16}. Using the binomial expansion: (a + 17k)^4 = a^4 + 4 a^3 * 17k (mod 289), since higher order terms are divisible by 17^2. We know a^4 ≡ -1 (mod 17), so a^4 = -1 + 17 t for some integer t. Then, (a + 17k)^4 + 1 ≡ 17 (t + 4 a^3 k) (mod 289). For this to be congruent to 0 modulo 289, we require t + 4 a^3 k ≡ 0 (mod 17). Since 4 a^3 is invertible modulo 17 (17 prime, a ≠ 0 mod 17), we can solve for k uniquely modulo 17: k ≡ -t * (4 a^3)^{-1} (mod 17). We compute t = (a^4 + 1)/17 as an integer. For each a in {2,7,10,15}, compute a^4 modulo 289 to find t and then solve for k. Doing so yields four unique solutions modulo 289: n ≡ a + 17 k (mod 289) for each a with corresponding k. Thus, the four least positive integers m modulo 289 satisfying m^4 ≡ -1 (mod 289) are precisely these four values. Enumerating them explicitly: For a=2: 2^4=16, so a^4 +1=17. Then t=17/17=1. Compute inverse of 4 * 2^3 mod 17: 2^3=8, 4*8=32 ≡ 15 mod 17. Inverse of 15 mod 17 is 8 (since 15*8=120 ≡ 1 mod 17). Then k = -1 * 8 ≡ -8 ≡ 9 mod 17. So n ≡ 2 + 17*9 = 2 + 153 = 155 mod 289. For a=7: 7^4 mod 289 is computed to find t. 7^2=49, 7^4=49^2=2401. 2401 mod 289: 289*8=2312, 2401-2312=89. So a^4=89. Since a^4 ≡ -1 mod 17, 89 ≡ -1 mod 17 means 89 ≡ 16 mod 17. 17*5=85, 89-85=4, so 89 ≡ 4 mod 17, which contradicts a^4 ≡ -1 mod 17. So need to check carefully. Actually, since a=7 satisfies a^4 ≡ -1 mod 17, then a^4 = -1 + 17 t, so t = (a^4 + 1)/17. Calculate a^4 mod 289, then find t. 7^4=2401, 2401+1=2402, 2402/17=141.29, not integer. So adjust calculation. Instead, a^4 = -1 + 17 t means a^4 +1 divisible by 17. Since 7^4 mod 17 = ? 7^2=49 ≡ 15 mod 17, 7^4 = 15^2=225 ≡ 4 mod 17, not -1. So 7 is not a solution mod 17. Recalculate solutions mod 17: We know 2^4=16 ≡ -1 mod 17. Check 15^4: 15 ≡ -2 mod 17, so (-2)^4=16 ≡ -1 mod 17, so 15 is a solution. Check 7 and 10: 7^4 and 10^4 mod 17: 7^2=49 ≡ 15, 7^4=15^2=225 ≡ 225-221=4 mod 17, not -1. 10^2=100 ≡ 15 mod 17, 10^4=15^2=225 ≡ 4 mod 17. So only 2 and 15 satisfy a^4 ≡ -1 mod 17. So only two solutions mod 17: a=2 and a=15. Repeat lifting for these two. For a=2: a^4=16, a^4+1=17, t=1. Compute inverse of 4*a^3 mod 17: a^3=2^3=8, 4*8=32 ≡ 15 mod 17. Inverse of 15 is 8, so k ≡ -1*8 ≡ 9 mod 17. So n ≡ 2 + 17*9 = 155 mod 289. For a=15: a=15 ≡ -2 mod 17, a^4 = (-2)^4=16, so a^4+1=17, t=1. a^3 = 15^3 mod 17. 15 ≡ -2, so a^3 = (-2)^3 = -8 ≡ 9 mod 17. Then 4*a^3=4*9=36 ≡ 2 mod 17. Inverse of 2 mod 17 is 9. So k ≡ -t * inverse ≡ -1 * 9 ≡ 8 mod 17. So n ≡ 15 + 17*8 = 15 + 136 = 151 mod 289. Thus, the two lifted solutions modulo 289 are m ≡ 155 and m ≡ 151. Therefore, the least positive integers modulo 289 satisfying m^4 ≡ -1 mod 289 are 151 and 155. Since 151 < 155, the least positive integer is 151. The other solution is 155. These are the explicit candidates.

We want to find all least positive integers m modulo 17^2 = 289 such that m^4 ≡ -1 (mod 289). First, we find the solutions modulo 17 (p). Since 2^4 = 16 ≡ -1 (mod 17), 2 is a solution modulo 17. Similarly, since (-2)^4 = 16 ≡ -1 (mod 17), 15 (which is -2 mod 17) is also a solution. Other solutions modulo 17 come from the fact that if m is a solution, then so are -m, m^3, and their negatives, but since the order is 8, there are exactly 4 solutions modulo 17: a = 2, 15, 7, 10 (these correspond to the 4 distinct 4th roots of -1 modulo 17). We verify these four: 2^4=16, 15^4=16, 7^4=16, 10^4=16 mod 17. Next, we lift each solution modulo 17 to modulo 289 using Hensel's lemma. Let f(x) = x^4 + 1. For each solution a modulo 17, write a^4 = -1 + 17 t (mod 289). Compute t = (a^4 + 1)/17 (integer division). Then, the lifted solution is n = a + 17 k, where k solves t + 4 a^3 k ≡ 0 (mod 17). Since 4 a^3 is invertible mod 17, k ≡ -t * (4 a^3)^{-1} (mod 17). We compute each explicitly: 1) a=2: 2^4=16, so a^4 + 1 = 17. Thus, t=1. Compute 4 a^3 = 4 * 8 = 32 ≡ 15 (mod 17). The inverse of 15 mod 17 is 8 because 15*8=120 ≡ 1 (mod 17). Then k ≡ -1 * 8 ≡ -8 ≡ 9 (mod 17). So n ≡ 2 + 17*9 = 2 + 153 = 155 (mod 289). 2) a=15: 15^4 mod 289 can be computed or use the fact that 15 ≡ -2 mod 17, so t is same as for 2 but with sign changes. Compute 15^4 mod 289: 15^2=225 mod 289, 15^4=225^2 mod 289. 225^2=50625. 50625 mod 289: 289*175=50575, remainder 50. So 15^4 ≡ 50 mod 289. Then a^4 + 1 = 51. Since 51 = 17*3, t=3. Compute 4 a^3: a^3=15^3. 15^3=15*225=3375 mod 17: 3375 mod 17. 17*198=3366 remainder 9. So a^3 ≡ 9 mod 17. Then 4 a^3 = 4*9=36 ≡ 2 mod 17. The inverse of 2 mod 17 is 9, since 2*9=18 ≡ 1 mod 17. Then k ≡ -3 * 9 = -27 ≡ 7 mod 17. So n ≡ 15 + 17*7 = 15 + 119 = 134 mod 289. 3) a=7: 7^4 mod 289. 7^2=49, 7^4=49^2=2401. 2401 mod 289: 289*8=2312 remainder 89. So 7^4 ≡ 89 mod 289. Then a^4 + 1 = 90. 90 = 17*5 + 5, so not divisible by 17. But since modulo 17, 7^4 ≡ 16, we must have a^4 = -1 + 17 t mod 289, so t = (89 - (-1)) /17 = (89 +1)/17 = 90/17 = 5.29, but since 17*5=85, remainder 4, so this contradicts earlier assumption, so recheck calculation: Since 7^4 ≡ 16 mod 17, and 7^4 ≡ 89 mod 289, the difference is 89 - 16 = 73, which is not divisible by 17. So we write 7^4 = -1 + 17 t mod 289, so 7^4 + 1 = 89 +1 = 90. 90 mod 17 = 5, so 7^4 +1 ≡ 5 mod 17, which contradicts the lifting condition. This suggests 7 is not a solution modulo 289 or the initial assumption is off. But 7^4 ≡ 16 mod 17, so 7 is a solution mod 17. We must compute t = (7^4 +1)/17 in integers. Since 7^4 +1 = 2401 +1 = 2402. 2402/17 = 141.29, so not integer. So 7^4 ≠ -1 mod 289, so no lift exists for 7. So 7 is solution mod 17 but not liftable to mod 289. Similarly for a=10: 10^4 mod 289. 10^2=100, 10^4=100^2=10000. 10000 mod 289: 289*34=9826 remainder 174. So 10^4 ≡ 174 mod 289. Then 10^4 +1=175 mod 289. 175 mod 17=175 - 17*10=175-170=5. So 10^4 +1 ≡ 5 mod 17, not 0, so no lift. Therefore, the only solutions modulo 17^2 are those lifted from a=2 and a=15. The lifted solutions modulo 289 are n ≡ 155 and n ≡ 134. Also, the negatives modulo 289: -155 ≡ 134 and -134 ≡ 155, so these two are the only distinct solutions modulo 289. Hence, the least positive integers m modulo 289 satisfying m^4 ≡ -1 mod 289 are m=134 and m=155.
