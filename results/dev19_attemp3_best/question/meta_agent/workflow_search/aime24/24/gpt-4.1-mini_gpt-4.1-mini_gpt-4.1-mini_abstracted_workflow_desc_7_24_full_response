Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 9pju', content='We are given a = log2(x) = -7/24, b = log2(y) = -3/8, and c = log2(z) = -5/12. We need to find |log2(x^4 y^3 z^2)|. Using logarithm properties, log2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = 4*log2(x) + 3*log2(y) + 2*log2(z) = 4a + 3b + 2c. Substitute the values: 4*(-7/24) + 3*(-3/8) + 2*(-5/12). Calculate each term: 4*(-7/24) = -28/24 = -7/6, 3*(-3/8) = -9/8, 2*(-5/12) = -10/12 = -5/6. Now sum these: -7/6 - 9/8 - 5/6. Find common denominator, which is 24. Convert each fraction: -7/6 = -28/24, -9/8 = -27/24, -5/6 = -20/24. Sum: (-28 - 27 - 20)/24 = -75/24. The absolute value is 75/24. Simplify 75/24 by dividing numerator and denominator by 3: 25/8. So |log2(x^4 y^3 z^2)| = 25/8. Here m=25 and n=8, which are relatively prime.

To solve for a, b, and c, we first add all three equations to find a relation among a, b, and c. Adding them yields -a - b - c = 13/12, which rearranges to a + b + c = -13/12. Next, express a in terms of b and c from the first equation: a = 1/2 + b + c. Substitute this expression for a into the second equation: b - a - c = 1/3, which simplifies to -1/2 - 2c = 1/3, leading to c = -5/12. Then, substitute c and the expression for a into the third equation: c - a - b = 1/4, which simplifies to -11/12 - 2b - c = 1/4. Substituting c = -5/12 gives -11/12 - 2b + 5/12 = 1/4, which simplifies to -1/2 - 2b = 1/4, yielding b = -3/8.

Using the properties of logarithms, specifically log(a/b) = log(a) - log(b), we rewrite each equation. For the first equation: log2(x) - log2(y) - log2(z) = 1/2, which translates to a - b - c = 1/2.
