Question: Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations:
\[\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}\]\[\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}\]\[\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}\]
Then the value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: We are given a = log2(x) = -7/24, b = log2(y) = -3/8, and c = log2(z) = -5/12. We need to find |log2(x^4 y^3 z^2)|. Using logarithm properties, log2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = 4*log2(x) + 3*log2(y) + 2*log2(z) = 4a + 3b + 2c. Substitute the values: 4*(-7/24) + 3*(-3/8) + 2*(-5/12). Calculate each term: 4*(-7/24) = -28/24 = -7/6, 3*(-3/8) = -9/8, 2*(-5/12) = -10/12 = -5/6. Now sum these: -7/6 - 9/8 - 5/6. Find common denominator, which is 24. Convert each fraction: -7/6 = -28/24, -9/8 = -27/24, -5/6 = -20/24. Sum: (-28 - 27 - 20)/24 = -75/24. The absolute value is 75/24. Simplify 75/24 by dividing numerator and denominator by 3: 25/8. So |log2(x^4 y^3 z^2)| = 25/8. Here m=25 and n=8, which are relatively prime. Therefore, m + n = 25 + 8 = 33.
