Question: Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.

proposed answer: We start with the hyperbola \( \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \) and points A, B on it, with C = -A and D = -B, forming a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin. The rhombus condition implies the orthogonality condition A·B = 0, which translates to 5 cosh u cosh v + 6 sinh u sinh v = 0 when parametrizing points as A = (2√5 cosh u, 2√6 sinh u) and B = (2√5 cosh v, 2√6 sinh v). From this, we derive tanh v = -5/(6 tanh u). The squared length of diagonal BD is BD^2 = 4(x_2^2 + y_2^2) = 176 cosh^2 v - 96. Using the identity cosh^2 v = 1/(1 - tanh^2 v), and substituting tanh v, we get cosh^2 v = 36 tanh^2 u / (36 tanh^2 u - 25). Letting t = tanh^2 u, the domain for real points and orthogonality is t > 25/36. Then BD^2(t) = (6336 t)/(36 t - 25) - 96. The function BD^2(t) is strictly decreasing on (25/36, 1), tending to +∞ as t approaches 25/36 from above, and tending to 480 as t approaches 1. Since t = tanh^2 u < 1, the minimal BD^2 achievable is 480, which is the greatest real number less than BD^2 for all such rhombi. This is consistent with all problem constraints: points on the hyperbola, orthogonality condition, rhombus properties, and diagonals intersecting at the origin. Therefore, the final answer is 480.
