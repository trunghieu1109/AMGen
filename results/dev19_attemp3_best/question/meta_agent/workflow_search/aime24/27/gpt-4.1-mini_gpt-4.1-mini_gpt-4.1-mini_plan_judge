Question: Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_0_27
proposed answer: The number N is given as 5694. To find Q and R, we divide N by 1000. Dividing 5694 by 1000, the quotient Q is the integer part of the division, which is 5, and the remainder R is the part left after subtracting 1000*Q from N, which is 5694 - 5*1000 = 694. The problem asks for the sum Q + R, so we calculate 5 + 694 = 699. This step-by-step division and addition gives the final answer.
