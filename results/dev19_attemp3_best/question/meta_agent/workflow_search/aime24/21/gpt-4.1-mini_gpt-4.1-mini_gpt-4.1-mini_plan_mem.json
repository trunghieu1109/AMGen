The previously identified 6 rectangles correspond only to those formed by vertices of the polygon. Additional rectangles formed by intersections of diagonals inside the polygon must be considered, which increases the total count. Therefore, the exact total number is unknown here but definitely more than 6.": "95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval: (0.0%, 0.0%), Median: 0.0%"
