This can be rewritten in the form R cos(θ - α) where R = sqrt(324^2 + (-432)^2) and α = arctan((-432)/324). First, calculate R: R = sqrt(324^2 + 432^2) = sqrt(104976 + 186624) = sqrt(291600) = 540. Next, calculate α: α = arctan(-432/324) = arctan(-4/3). Since cosine is positive and sine is negative, θ - α is in the fourth quadrant, so α = -arctan(4/3). The expression becomes 540 cos(θ - α). The maximum value of cosine is 1, which occurs when θ - α = 0 mod 2π, i.e., θ = α + 2kπ. Therefore, the values of θ that maximize the real part are θ = -arctan(4/3) + 2kπ, for k ∈ integers.

This is a linear combination of cosine and sine functions. We can rewrite it in the form R cos(θ - α) where R = sqrt(324^2 + (-432)^2) and α = atan2(-432, 324). Calculating R: R = sqrt(324^2 + 432^2) = sqrt(104976 + 186624) = sqrt(291600) = 540. Calculating α: α = atan2(-432, 324) = atan2(-432, 324). Since 324 > 0 and -432 < 0, α is in the fourth quadrant. α = -arctan(432/324) = -arctan(4/3). arctan(4/3) ≈ 0.9273 radians, so α ≈ -0.9273 radians. Therefore, Re = 540 cos(θ - (-0.9273)) = 540 cos(θ + 0.9273). The maximum value of cosine is 1, achieved when θ + 0.9273 = 0 mod 2π. Thus, θ = -0.9273 + 2πk for integers k.

This is the unique global maximum point for θ in [0, 2π).; answer: The values of θ in [0, 2π) that maximize the real part are θ = 5.3559 radians (approximately), which corresponds to θ = 2π - arctan(4/3).\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent 0BtN, finding maximizing theta, thinking: The real part of the expression is given by Re = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. This can be rewritten in the form R cos(θ - α) where R = √(324² + (-432)²) and α = arctan((-432)/324). Calculating R: R = √(324² + 432²) = √(104976 + 186624) = √291600 = 540. Calculating α: α = arctan(-432/324) = arctan(-4/3). Since cosine and sine have signs corresponding to positive cosine and negative sine, α lies in the 4th quadrant, so α = -arctan(4/3). The expression becomes Re = 540 cos(θ - α). To maximize Re, we want cos(θ - α) = 1, which happens when θ - α = 0 (mod 2π). Therefore, the θ that maximize Re are θ = α + 2kπ for integers k. Restricting θ to [0, 2π), the maximizing θ is θ = -arctan(4/3) + 2π.
