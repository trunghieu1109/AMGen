Question: Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_4_27
proposed answer: The problem requires finding the greatest four-digit number N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d such that changing any one digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. By setting up modular equations for each condition and solving them, we find the digits must satisfy certain congruences modulo 7. The digits that satisfy these congruences and are as large as possible within 0-9 are a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4, giving N=5694. Checking all four conditions confirms that changing any digit to 1 yields a number divisible by 7. Dividing 5694 by 1000 gives Q=5 and R=694, so Q+R=699. This satisfies all problem constraints and is the greatest such number.
