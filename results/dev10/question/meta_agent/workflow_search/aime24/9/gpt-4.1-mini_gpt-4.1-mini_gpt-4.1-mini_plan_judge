Question: Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: The total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is C(10,4) = 210. Jen's chosen 4 numbers are fixed. To win a prize, the intersection of Jen's chosen numbers and the drawn numbers must be at least 2. We count the number of 4-element subsets of S that intersect Jen's set in exactly k elements for k=2, 3, 4. For k=2: C(4,2)*C(6,2) = 6*15 = 90. For k=3: C(4,3)*C(6,1) = 4*6 = 24. For k=4: C(4,4)*C(6,0) = 1*1 = 1. Total subsets with intersection â‰¥ 2 is 90 + 24 + 1 = 115. The grand prize corresponds to intersection size 4, which is 1 subset. The probability of winning the grand prize given winning a prize is (1/210) / (115/210) = 1/115. The fraction 1/115 is in lowest terms since 1 and 115 are relatively prime. Therefore, m=1, n=115, and m+n=116. This matches all logical checks and other agents' solutions, confirming correctness.
