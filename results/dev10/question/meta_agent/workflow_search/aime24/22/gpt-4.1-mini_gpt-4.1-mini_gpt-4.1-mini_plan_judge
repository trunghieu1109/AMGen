Question: A list of positive integers has the following properties:
$\bullet$ The sum of the items in the list is $30$.
$\bullet$ The unique mode of the list is $9$.
$\bullet$ The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.
Find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_0_22
proposed answer: The unique valid list identified is [5, 7, 9, 9]. This list satisfies all the problem conditions: the sum is 5 + 7 + 9 + 9 = 30, the unique mode is 9 (which appears twice, more than any other number), and the median is (7 + 9)/2 = 8, which is a positive integer not in the list. To find the sum of the squares of all items, we calculate 5^2 + 7^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 = 25 + 49 + 81 + 81 = 236. This sum of squares matches the constraints and confirms the solution.
