Question: Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.

proposed answer: We have four items: diamond rings (D), golf clubs (G), garden spades (S), and candy hearts (C). All 900 residents own candy hearts, so |C| = 900. The other three items are subsets of candy hearts owners. The problem states: |D|=195, |G|=367, |S|=562, exactly two items owned = 437, exactly three items owned = 234. Since candy hearts ownership is universal, owning exactly two items means owning candy hearts plus exactly one of D, G, or S. Owning exactly three items means owning candy hearts plus exactly two of D, G, or S. Owning all four items means owning candy hearts plus all three of D, G, and S. Let x = number of residents owning all four items = |D ∩ G ∩ S|. Let the number of residents owning exactly one of D, G, S (with candy hearts) be a, b, c respectively. Then: - Number owning exactly one item (with candy hearts) = a + b + c. - Number owning exactly two items (with candy hearts) = sum of pairwise intersections minus 3x = 437. - Number owning exactly three items (with candy hearts) = x = number owning all four items. The problem states exactly three items owned = 234, which corresponds to owning candy hearts plus exactly two of D, G, S, so this is the number owning exactly three items, not the number owning all four items. We want to find x = number owning all four items. Using inclusion-exclusion for D, G, S: |D ∪ G ∪ S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - sum of pairwise intersections + x. The total number of residents owning at least one of D, G, S is |D ∪ G ∪ S|. Since all own candy hearts, total residents = 900. The number owning none of D, G, S is 900 - |D ∪ G ∪ S|. We know: - Number owning exactly two items = sum of pairwise intersections - 3x = 437 - Number owning exactly three items = sum of triple intersections - 4x = 234 (but since only one triple intersection exists, this is x) However, the problem only gives one triple intersection (D ∩ G ∩ S), so the number owning all four items is x. We can set up equations: Let A = number owning exactly one of D, G, S (with candy hearts), B = number owning exactly two of D, G, S (with candy hearts), C = number owning all three of D, G, S (with candy hearts) = x. Given: B = 437, C = x, and number owning exactly three items = 234. But the problem states exactly three items owned = 234, which corresponds to B = 234 (owning candy hearts plus exactly two of D, G, S). So B = 234, not 437. The problem states exactly two items owned = 437, which corresponds to owning candy hearts plus exactly one of D, G, S, so A = 437. So the corrected interpretation is: - Exactly one item (with candy hearts): 437 - Exactly two items (with candy hearts): 234 - Exactly three items (with candy hearts): x (number owning all four items) We know total residents = 900. So total residents = number owning exactly one + number owning exactly two + number owning exactly three + number owning none of D, G, S (but all own candy hearts). Let n0 = number owning none of D, G, S. Then: 900 = 437 + 234 + x + n0 => n0 = 900 - 437 - 234 - x = 229 - x. Also, sum of |D| + |G| + |S| = 195 + 367 + 562 = 1124. Using inclusion-exclusion: |D ∪ G ∪ S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - sum of pairwise intersections + x. Number owning none of D, G, S = 900 - |D ∪ G ∪ S| = n0 = 229 - x. So: |D ∪ G ∪ S| = 900 - n0 = 900 - (229 - x) = 671 + x. Also, number owning exactly one = 437, number owning exactly two = 234, number owning exactly three = x. The sum of residents owning at least one of D, G, S is: exactly one + exactly two + exactly three = 437 + 234 + x = 671 + x, which matches |D ∪ G ∪ S|. The sum of residents owning D, G, S is: sum of sizes = 1124. The sum of residents owning exactly one item is: a + b + c = 437. The sum of residents owning exactly two items is: sum of pairwise intersections - 3x = 234. The sum of residents owning exactly three items is: x. Using these, sum of sizes = exactly one + 2*(exactly two) + 3*(exactly three) = 437 + 2*234 + 3*x = 437 + 468 + 3x = 905 + 3x. But sum of sizes = 1124, so: 1124 = 905 + 3x => 3x = 219 => x = 73. Therefore, the number of residents owning all four items is 73. This satisfies all constraints and is consistent with the given data.
