proposed answer: Starting from the given equations log_x(y^x) = 10 and log_y(x^{4y}) = 10, we rewrite them as y^x = x^{10} and x^{4y} = y^{10}. Taking natural logarithms, we get: x ln(y) = 10 ln(x) and 4y ln(x) = 10 ln(y). From the first, ln(y) = (10 ln(x))/x. Substitute into the second: 4y ln(x) = 10 * (10 ln(x))/x, simplifying to 4y = 100 / x, so y = 25 / x. Substitute y back into the first equation: x ln(25 / x) = 10 ln(x), which expands to x ln(25) - x ln(x) = 10 ln(x), or x ln(25) = (x + 10) ln(x). Solving this transcendental equation numerically yields x approximately 1.535 and y approximately 16.28, both greater than 1. The product xy = x * y = 25. Verifying: y^x = (16.28)^{1.535} ≈ x^{10} = (1.535)^{10}, and x^{4y} = (1.535)^{4*16.28} ≈ y^{10} = (16.28)^{10}, confirming the solution. Hence, the value of xy is 25.
