Question: Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). Then \(OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\).

proposed answer: The problem involves finding a unique point C on the segment AB such that C lies only on AB among all unit segments connecting the positive x-axis and y-axis. Parameterizing AB by t in (0,1) as C(t) = ((1-t)/2, (sqrt(3)*t)/2), the squared distance from O to C(t) is OC^2 = ((1-t)/2)^2 + ((sqrt(3)*t)/2)^2 = (1 - 2t + 4t^2)/4. The condition that C lies only on AB and no other segment in the family leads to t=3/4. Substituting t=3/4, we get OC^2 = (1/8)^2 + (3*sqrt(3)/8)^2 = 1/64 + 27/64 = 28/64 = 7/16. The fraction 7/16 is in lowest terms, so p=7 and q=16. Therefore, p+q=23. This result is consistent across multiple independent solutions and verified by direct substitution and simplification.
