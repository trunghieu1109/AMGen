Alternative approaches such as numerical optimization and boundary analysis can confirm global optimality. If assumptions fail, alternative maxima may exist, affecting the minimal sphere radius. Final confirmation requires these checks; otherwise, further investigation is recommended to ensure robustness and transparency.": "95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval: (0.0%, 0.0%), Median: 0.0%"
