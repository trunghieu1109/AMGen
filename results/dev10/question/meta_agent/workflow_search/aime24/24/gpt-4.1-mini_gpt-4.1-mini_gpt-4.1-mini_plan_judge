Question: Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations:
\[\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}\]\[\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}\]\[\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}\]
Then the value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: From the previous sub-task, the value of |log2(x^4 y^3 z^2)| was found to be 25/8. The fraction 25/8 is already in simplest form since 25 and 8 share no common factors other than 1. Therefore, m = 25 and n = 8. The sum m + n = 25 + 8 = 33. This sum completes the problem's requirement.
