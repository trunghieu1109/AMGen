Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: The problem involves a torus with major radius R=6 and minor radius r=3, and a sphere of radius 11. The torus is externally tangent to the sphere along two distinct circles on its surface, with radii r_i and r_o. The difference r_i - r_o is expressed as a reduced fraction m/n, and we need to find m + n. Two different answers were proposed: 47 (from fraction 36/11) and 89 (from fraction 33/56). Considering the geometry, the torus circle radii difference related to the sphere radius often results in a fraction with denominator related to the sphere radius or the torus parameters. The fraction 36/11 is simpler and fits the problem's parameters better, as 11 is the sphere radius, and 36 relates to the torus dimensions. The fraction 33/56 seems less connected to the given numbers. Also, 36/11 is in lowest terms and the sum 47 is a reasonable final answer. Therefore, the final answer is 47.

The torus is tangent externally to the sphere along two circles on its surface with radii r_i and r_o. The difference r_i - r_o is expressed as a reduced fraction m/n, and we need to find m+n. Two different answers were proposed: 47 (from fraction 36/11) and 89 (from fraction 33/56). Considering the geometry, the minor radius is 3, so the difference in tangent circle radii should be less than or equal to 3. The fraction 36/11 ≈ 3.27 is slightly greater than 3, which is not reasonable since the difference cannot exceed the minor radius. The fraction 33/56 ≈ 0.589 is less than 3, which is reasonable. Also, the difference in tangent circle radii should be less than the minor radius, as the tangent circles lie on the torus cross-section circle of radius 3. Therefore, the fraction 33/56 is more consistent with the problem's geometry. Hence, m=33, n=56, and m+n=89. This result is consistent with the problem's conditions and geometric intuition.
