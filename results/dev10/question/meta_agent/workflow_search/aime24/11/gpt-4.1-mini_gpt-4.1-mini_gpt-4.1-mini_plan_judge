Question: Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.
[asy] size(10cm); usepackage("tikz");label("\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(2,0)--(2,3)--(5,3)--(5,8)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}",origin); label("\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(0,3)--(3,3)--(3,5)--(8,5)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}",E); [/asy]

proposed answer: The problem requires counting lattice paths from (0,0) to (8,8) with exactly 4 direction changes. Each path consists of 16 steps: 8 rights (R) and 8 ups (U). A direction change corresponds to a switch from R to U or U to R. Having exactly 4 direction changes means the path has exactly 5 runs of consecutive identical moves, alternating between R and U. There are two possible run patterns: starting with R (R-U-R-U-R) and starting with U (U-R-U-R-U). For the pattern starting with R, there are 3 runs of R and 2 runs of U. The number of compositions of 8 into 3 positive parts is C(7,2) = 21, and into 2 positive parts is C(7,1) = 7. Thus, the number of sequences for this pattern is 21 * 7 = 147. For the pattern starting with U, similarly, there are 3 runs of U and 2 runs of R, so the count is also 21 * 7 = 147. Adding both patterns, the total number of sequences with exactly 4 direction changes is 147 + 147 = 294. This counting is correct because the two patterns are mutually exclusive and each pair of compositions corresponds to a unique sequence. Therefore, the final answer is 294.
