Question: Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_13_8
proposed answer: The losing positions for the first player (Alice) are those where n mod 5 equals 0 or 2. To count how many integers n ≤ 2024 satisfy this, we count multiples of 5 (n mod 5 = 0) and numbers congruent to 2 mod 5. Multiples of 5 up to 2024 are 5, 10, ..., 2020. The number of such multiples is floor(2024/5) = 404. Numbers congruent to 2 mod 5 are of the form 5k + 2, starting from 2 up to 2022. The number of such numbers is floor((2022 - 2)/5) + 1 = floor(2020/5) + 1 = 404 + 1 = 405. Adding these gives 404 + 405 = 809. Therefore, there are 809 positive integers n ≤ 2024 for which Bob can guarantee a win (losing positions for Alice).
