Question: Alice chooses a set $A$ of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets $B$ of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of $B$ belongs to $A$. Bob's list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_13_26
proposed answer: To find the set A, we need to express 2024 as a sum of distinct powers of two of the form 2^{a-1}. This corresponds to the binary representation of 2024, where each set bit at position k (starting from 0 at the least significant bit) corresponds to an element a = k + 1 in A. Converting 2024 to binary carefully, we find the bits set at positions 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. These correspond to elements a = 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 in A. Summing 2^{a-1} for these elements gives 8 + 32 + 64 + 128 + 256 + 512 + 1024 = 2024, confirming correctness. Finally, summing the elements of A: 4 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 = 55. Therefore, the sum of the elements of A is 55.
