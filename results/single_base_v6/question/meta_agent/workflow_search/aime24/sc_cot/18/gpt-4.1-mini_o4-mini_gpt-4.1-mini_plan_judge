Question: Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). Then \(OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\).

proposed answer: We seek the unique interior point C on AB that lies on no other unit‐length segment with endpoints on the axes.  Parametrize AB by A+(t)(B−A) with A=(½,0), B=(0,√3/2), so C=( (1−t)/2, (√3/2)t ).  A general chord PQ from the axes of unit length satisfies (x_c/(1−s))^2+(y_c/s)^2=1 for some s∈[0,1].  Multiplying through and clearing denominators gives a quartic G(s) with a known root s=t.  Requiring that root to be double (so no other chord passes through C) forces G′(t)=0.  Carrying out the algebra yields t=¾.  Hence C=(1/8,3√3/8) and OC^2=(1/8)^2+(3√3/8)^2=7/16, so p+q=7+16=23.
