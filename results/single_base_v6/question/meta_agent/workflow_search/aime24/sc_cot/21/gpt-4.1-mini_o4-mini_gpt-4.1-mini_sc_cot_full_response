Question: Find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon ($12$-gon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The diagram below shows three of those rectangles.

Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 28Re', content='We need the number of rectangles whose vertices are among the 12 vertices of a regular 12-gon and whose sides lie along its edges or diagonals. Any rectangle inscribed in the same circumcircle must have its center coincide with the circleâ€™s center, so its diagonals are diameters of the 12-gon. There are 6 diameters (pairs of antipodal vertices), and any two distinct diameters determine a unique rectangle. Thus the number of rectangles is C(6,2)=15.\n\nAnswer:15', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
