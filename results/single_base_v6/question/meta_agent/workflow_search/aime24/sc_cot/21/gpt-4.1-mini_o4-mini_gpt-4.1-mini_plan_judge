Question: Find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon ($12$-gon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The diagram below shows three of those rectangles.

proposed answer: We need the number of rectangles whose vertices are among the 12 vertices of a regular 12-gon and whose sides lie along its edges or diagonals. Any rectangle inscribed in the same circumcircle must have its center coincide with the circleâ€™s center, so its diagonals are diameters of the 12-gon. There are 6 diameters (pairs of antipodal vertices), and any two distinct diameters determine a unique rectangle. Thus the number of rectangles is C(6,2)=15.
