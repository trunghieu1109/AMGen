Question: A list of positive integers has the following properties:
$\bullet$ The sum of the items in the list is $30$.
$\bullet$ The unique mode of the list is $9$.
$\bullet$ The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.
Find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 4YAD', content='We need a list of positive integers summing to 30, with unique mode 9 and median (an integer) not appearing in the list. If the list has odd length, the median is an actual list element, so must be even length. Try length 4: let the sorted list be [a1,a2,a3,a4]; a3=a4=9 to make 9 the unique mode. Then a1+a2+9+9=30 → a1+a2=12, with a2 odd so (a2+9)/2 an integer median ≠ any list element. The only solution is a2=7, a1=5 giving [5,7,9,9] with median=(7+9)/2=8, which is not in the list. No longer list works. Sum of squares is 5^2+7^2+9^2+9^2=25+49+81+81=236.\n\nAnswer:236', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
