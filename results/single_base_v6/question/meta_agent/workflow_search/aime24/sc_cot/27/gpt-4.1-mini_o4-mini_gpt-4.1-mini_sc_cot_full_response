Question: Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent zbwC', content='We seek the greatest 4-digit N=d1d2d3d4 such that replacing any one digit by 1 yields a multiple of 7. Let M_i be the result replacing digit i by 1. Set up congruences mod 7: for i=1 to 4, M_i≡0 mod7. Writing d1=x,d2=y,d3=z,d4=w, we get:\n(1) 2y+3z+w≡1\n(2) 6x+3z+w≡5\n(3) 6x+2y+w≡4\n(4) 6x+2y+3z≡6  (all mod7)\nEliminate w from (1),(2),(3),(4): from (1) w=1−2y−3z. Equate to w from (2)-(3) differences to derive relationships. Solving yields x≡5,y≡6,z≡2,w≡4 mod7. Valid digit options in [0,9]: x=5,y=6,w=4; z=2 or 9. The larger N is 5694. Check replacements: 1694,5194,5614,5691 are all divisible by 7. Finally N=5694 gives Q=5,R=694 so Q+R=699.\n\nAnswer:699', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
