Question: Find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid so that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is $999$, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is $99$. The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$.
\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\ \hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\ \hline \end{array}\]
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: We label the grid as
 a  b  c
 d  e  f

Left–right sum abc + def = 999 gives per‐digit sums with no carries (we find t1=t2=0):
 c+f=9, b+e=9, a+d=9.
Top–bottom sum ad + be + cf = 99 becomes 10(a+b+c)+(d+e+f)=99.
Substitute d=9−a, e=9−b, f=9−c:
 d+e+f=27−(a+b+c), so 10S+(27−S)=99 ⇒9S=72⇒S=a+b+c=8.
Thus a,b,c≥0 integers summing to 8. No further bounds bind since 8≤9. Number of nonnegative solutions is C(8+3−1,3−1)=C(10,2)=45.
