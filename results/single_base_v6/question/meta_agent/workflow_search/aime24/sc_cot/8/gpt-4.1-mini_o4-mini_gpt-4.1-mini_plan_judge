Question: Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.

proposed answer: We consider the subtraction game with moves {1,4}. A position n is losing (P-position) iff every move leads to a winning (N) position. Computing small values shows P-positions at n=0,2,5,7,10,12,… and the pattern repeats mod 5: exactly those n≡0 or 2 mod 5. Since Alice moves first, Bob wins with optimal play iff the starting position is P, i.e. n≡0 or 2 mod 5. We count positive n≤2024 with n≡0 or 2 mod 5. There are floor(2024/5)=404 multiples of 5 (n≡0) and floor((2024−2)/5)+1=405 with n≡2. Total = 404+405 = 809.
