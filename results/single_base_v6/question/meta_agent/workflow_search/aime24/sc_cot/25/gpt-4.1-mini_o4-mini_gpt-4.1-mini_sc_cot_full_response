Question: Let ABCDEF be a convex equilateral hexagon in which all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle whose sides are extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. Find the side length of the hexagon.\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent wBg1', content='We model the hexagon by three vectors v,w,x of equal length s with opposite sides parallel. The triangle formed by the lines supporting AB, CD, EF has angles A,B,C where A+B+C=π and side‐lengths opposite A,B,C proportional to sin\u2009A,sin\u2009B,sin\u2009C. A vector–coord calculation shows that if its side‐lengths are a,b,c, then s=1/(1/a+1/b+1/c)=abc/(ab+bc+ca). Plugging a,b,c=200,240,300 yields s=80.\n\nAnswer:80', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
