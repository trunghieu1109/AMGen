Question: Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.
[asy] size(10cm); usepackage("tikz");label("\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(2,0)--(2,3)--(5,3)--(5,8)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}",origin); label("\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(0,3)--(3,3)--(3,5)--(8,5)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}",E); [/asy]

proposed answer: We want lattice paths from (0,0) to (8,8) with 8 R moves and 8 U moves, and exactly 4 direction changes. A direction change occurs when we switch between R and U. Exactly 4 changes implies exactly 5 runs of consecutive identical moves. The runs alternate R and U, and we can start with either R or U.

Case 1: start with R. Then the runs are R (length r1), U (length u2), R (r3), U (u4), R (r5), with all ri, uj positive. We require r1+r3+r5=8 and u2+u4=8. The number of positive solutions is C(8-1,3-1)=C(7,2)=21 for the R runs and C(7,1)=7 for the U runs, giving 21·7=147.

Case 2: start with U. Then runs U (u1), R (r2), U (u3), R (r4), U (u5), with u1+u3+u5=8 and r2+r4=8. Similarly this yields 21·7=147.

Total paths =147+147=294.
