Question: Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.

proposed answer: We recognize that the tetrahedron has opposite edges equal (an isosceles tetrahedron). Let a=BC=√89, b=CA=√80, c=AB=√41. Then the volume is given by V=√A/12 where A=4a^2b^2c^2−a^2(b^2+c^2−a^2)^2−b^2(c^2+a^2−b^2)^2−c^2(a^2+b^2−c^2)^2+(b^2+c^2−a^2)(c^2+a^2−b^2)(a^2+b^2−c^2). Computing yields A=409600 and V=640/12=160/3. All four faces are congruent triangles with sides a,b,c, whose area by Heron is T=6√21, so the total surface area S=4T=24√21. The inradius is r=3V/S=(3·(160/3))/(24√21)=160/(24√21)=20/(3√21)=20√21/63. Thus m=20, n=21, p=63 and m+n+p=104.
