Question: Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.

proposed answer: We need the smallest sphere containing any rectangular box with surface area S=54 and volume V=23. For a box with edges a,b,c>0, the sphere’s radius is half its space diagonal: r=½√(a^2+b^2+c^2). We must maximize D^2=a^2+b^2+c^2 over all a,b,c>0 satisfying 2(ab+bc+ca)=54 and abc=23. Use symmetry: extremal occurs when two edges equal, say a=b=x, c=y. Then constraints: x^2+2xy=27 and x^2y=23 ⇒ y=23/x^2, giving x^2+46/x=27 ⇒ x^3−27x+46=0. Solutions: x=2 or x=−1+2√6≈3.90. For x=2, y=23/4=5.75, so D^2=2·2^2+(23/4)^2=8+529/16=657/16≈41.06. For x=−1+2√6, D^2=(27171−4032√6)/529≈32.7, smaller. Thus maximum D^2=657/16 and r^2=(D^2)/4=657/64, giving p+q=657+64=721.
