    <pre>Let the 4 items be diamond rings (R), golf clubs (G), garden spades (S), and candy hearts (C). Every one owns C, so |C|=900. We know |R|+|G|+|S|+|C|=195+367+562+900=2024. Let Nk be number of residents owning exactly k items. We have N2=437 and N3=234. Also N0=0 and N1+N2+N3+N4=900, so N1=900−437−234−x=229−x, where N4=x. The total item‐ownership count is N1+2N2+3N3+4N4 =2024. Substituting N1 gives (229−x)+2·437+3·234+4x=2024 → 1805+3x=2024 → x=73.
