Question: Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.

proposed answer: Let the 4 items be diamond rings (R), golf clubs (G), garden spades (S), and candy hearts (C). Every one owns C, so |C|=900. We know |R|+|G|+|S|+|C|=195+367+562+900=2024. Let Nk be number of residents owning exactly k items. We have N2=437 and N3=234. Also N0=0 and N1+N2+N3+N4=900, so N1=900−437−234−x=229−x, where N4=x. The total item‐ownership count is N1+2N2+3N3+4N4 =2024. Substituting N1 gives (229−x)+2·437+3·234+4x=2024 → 1805+3x=2024 → x=73.
