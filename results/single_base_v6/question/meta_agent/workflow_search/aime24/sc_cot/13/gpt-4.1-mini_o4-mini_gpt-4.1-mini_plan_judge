Question: Eight circles of radius $34$ are sequentially tangent, and two of the circles are tangent to $AB$ and $BC$ of triangle $ABC$, respectively. $2024$ circles of radius $1$ can be arranged in the same manner. The inradius of triangle $ABC$ can be expressed as $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: We interpret the ‘sequentially tangent’ circles as a row of equal circles all tangent to base AC of triangle ABC, with the first touching AB and the last touching BC.  If n circles of radius R fit, their centers lie at height R above AC, spaced 2R apart.  Let the base AC have length b and the inradius be r.  One shows that for each configuration of n,R,
  b = R·[cot(A/2)+cot(C/2)+2(n−1)],
and also cot(A/2)+cot(C/2)=b/r.  Hence for two configurations (n=8,R=34) and (n=2024,R=1) we get
  34·[K+14] = [K+4046],  where K=cot(A/2)+cot(C/2).
Solving gives K=1190/11, so b/r=1190/11.  Meanwhile b = R·[K+2(n−1)] = 1·[1190/11+4046] =45696/11, so
  r = b·(11/1190) =45696/1190 =192/5.
Thus m+n =192+5 =197.
