Question: There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\times5$ grid such that: 

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: We need maximal placements of chips so that each row and column is monochromatic and no additional chip can be added.  A key insight is to view the configuration as assigning each row a color R_i and each column a color C_j (white or black), then placing a chip at (i,j) if and only if R_i = C_j.  This ensures each row and column is monochromatic, and at any empty cell R_i ≠ C_j, so you cannot add a chip without violating the row/column color match.  Since there are 2 choices for each of 5 rows and 2 choices for each of 5 columns, the total number of assignments (and hence maximal configurations) is 2^5 × 2^5 = 1024.
