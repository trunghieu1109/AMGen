Question: Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.

proposed answer: We look for positive integers n with exactly two base-b digits x,y (n=xb+y, 1≤x<b, 0≤y<b) satisfying x+y=√n.  Writing n=(x+y)^2 gives (x+y)^2=xb+y ⇒ S=x+y ⇒ S(S−1)=x(b−1), so x= S(S−1)/(b−1) must be integer ≥1 and y=S−x integer in [0,b−1].  One shows that S mod (b−1) must be ≡0 or 1, giving 2 solutions per prime dividing b−1, but discarding S≡1 (x=0) leaves 2^ω(b−1)−1 values (where ω(m) is the number of distinct prime factors).  We need 2^ω(b−1)−1>10 ⇒ 2^ω(b−1)>11 ⇒ ω(b−1)≥4.  The smallest integer with ≥4 distinct prime factors is 2·3·5·7=210, so b−1=210 ⇒ b=211.
