Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent U2oR', content='We need the radii of the two circles along which the torus is tangent to the sphere when the torus rests externally on it, one touching the "inner" side of its tube and one the "outer" side.  Place coordinates so the sphere of radius 11 is centered at the origin and the torus is centered on the z-axis with major radius 6 and minor radius 3, then translated upward by h so that its surface is tangent to the sphere.  In cylindrical coordinates (R,z), the sphere is R^2+z^2=121 and the torus is (R−6)^2+(z−h)^2=9.  At points of tangency, the normals must align, giving ∇(R^2+z^2)=λ∇((R−6)^2+(z−h)^2).  This yields R=λ(R−6) and z=λ(z−h), plus the two surface equations.  Eliminating λ and h leads to a quadratic in R whose solutions are R=33/4 and R=33/7.  These are the radii of the two contact circles.  The difference is 33/4−33/7=99/28, so m+n=99+28=127.\n\nAnswer:127', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
