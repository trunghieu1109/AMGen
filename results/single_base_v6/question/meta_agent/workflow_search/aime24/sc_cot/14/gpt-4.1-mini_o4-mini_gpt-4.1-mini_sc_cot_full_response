Question: Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent cH5E', content='We seek rhombi centered at the origin with vertices ±p and ±q on the hyperbola x^2/20–y^2/24=1, with p·q=0.  One diagonal BD has length 2|q| so BD^2=4|q|^2.  Writing q=(√20\u2009cosh\u2009s,√24\u2009sinh\u2009s) gives |q|^2=20\u2009cosh^2s+24\u2009sinh^2s and p exists ⟺ tanh\u2009s>5/6, i.e. s>(1/2)ln\u200911.  The infimum as s→(1/2)ln\u200911 from above yields |q|^2→120, so BD^2→4·120=480.  Hence the greatest real c that is <BD^2 for all such rhombi is 480.\n\nAnswer:480', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
