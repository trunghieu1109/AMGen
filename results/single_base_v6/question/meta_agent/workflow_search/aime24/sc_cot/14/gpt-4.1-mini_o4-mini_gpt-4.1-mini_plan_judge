Question: Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: We seek rhombi centered at the origin with vertices ±p and ±q on the hyperbola x^2/20–y^2/24=1, with p·q=0.  One diagonal BD has length 2|q| so BD^2=4|q|^2.  Writing q=(√20 cosh s,√24 sinh s) gives |q|^2=20 cosh^2s+24 sinh^2s and p exists ⟺ tanh s>5/6, i.e. s>(1/2)ln 11.  The infimum as s→(1/2)ln 11 from above yields |q|^2→120, so BD^2→4·120=480.  Hence the greatest real c that is <BD^2 for all such rhombi is 480.
