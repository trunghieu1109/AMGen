Question: There exist real numbers $x$ and $y$, both greater than 1, such that $\log_x\left(y^x\right)=\log_y\left(x^{4y}\right)=10$. Find $xy$.\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent uY84', content='Let A=ln x, B=ln y>0. From log_x(y^x)=10 we get x·(ln y/ln x)=10 → e^A·B=10A. From log_y(x^{4y})=10 we get 4y·(ln x/ln y)=10 → 4e^B·A=10B. Solve: from the first B=10A/e^A. Substitute into the second: 4e^B·A=10·(10A/e^A) ⇒ 4e^B=100/e^A ⇒ e^(A+B)=25. Hence xy=e^(A+B)=25.\n\nAnswer:25', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
