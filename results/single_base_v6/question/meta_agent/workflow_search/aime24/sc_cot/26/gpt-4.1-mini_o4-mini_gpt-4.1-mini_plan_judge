Question: Alice chooses a set $A$ of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets $B$ of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of $B$ belongs to $A$. Bob's list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A.
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: We need to count all nonempty finite sets B of positive integers whose maximum is in A. For each a∈A there are 2^(a−1) such sets (choosing any subset of {1,…,a−1}). So ∑_{a∈A}2^(a−1)=2024. Writing 2024 in binary: 2024=2^10+2^9+2^8+2^7+2^6+2^5+2^3. Hence the exponents a−1 must be {10,9,8,7,6,5,3}, so A={11,10,9,8,7,6,4}. Summing these gives 4+6+7+8+9+10+11=55.
