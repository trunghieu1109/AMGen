Question: Let $p$ be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $n^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$. Find the least positive integer $m$ such that $m^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$.\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent OQsV', content='We seek the smallest prime p such that p^2 divides n^4+1 for some n. First, mod p we need n^4 ≡ −1, so −1 must be a fourth power mod p, giving p≡1 mod8. The smallest such prime is 17. We then lift a solution n≡2 mod17 to mod17^2=289 via Hensel’s lemma: x=2+17·9=155 is one solution. Repeating for the four residues ±2,±8 mod17 yields solutions mod289: 110, 134, 155, 179. The least positive is 110.\n\nAnswer:110', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
