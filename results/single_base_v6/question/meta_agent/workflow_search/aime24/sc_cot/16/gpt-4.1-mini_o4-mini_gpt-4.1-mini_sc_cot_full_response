Question: Let $\triangle ABC$ have circumcenter $O$ and incenter $I$ with $\overline{IA}\perp\overline{OI}$, circumradius $13$, and inradius $6$. Find $AB\cdot AC$.\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent vYke', content='We place O at (0,0), I at (√13,0) so that OI⊥IA forces A on vertical line x=√13 and on circle x²+y²=169, giving A=(√13,2√39). Then AI=2√39. Using AI=r/sin(A/2) gives sin(A/2)=6/(2√39)=√(3/13), so cosA=(10/13−3/13)=7/13 and sinA=2√30/13. Hence a=BC=2R·sinA=26·(2√30/13)=4√30. Let b=CA,c=AB. Using area relations r\u2009s=abc/(4R) with s=(a+b+c)/2 and the Law of Cosines at A yields s=6√30 and bc=468.\n\nAnswer:468', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
