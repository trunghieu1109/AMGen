Question: Rectangles $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are drawn such that $D,E,C,F$ are collinear. Also, $A,D,H,G$ all lie on a circle. If $BC=16$,$AB=107$,$FG=17$, and $EF=184$, what is the length of $CE$?\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent hpJ9', content='Place rectangle ABCD with A=(0,0), B=(107,0), C=(107,16), D=(0,16). The line DC is y=16. Rectangle EFGH has EF on this line with length 184 and FG perpendicular of length 17. Let E=(x,16), F=(x+184,16), G=(x+184,33), H=(x,33). Concyclicity of A=(0,0), D=(0,16), H, G yields x=3. Thus E=(3,16), so CE=|107âˆ’3|=104.\n\nAnswer:104', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
