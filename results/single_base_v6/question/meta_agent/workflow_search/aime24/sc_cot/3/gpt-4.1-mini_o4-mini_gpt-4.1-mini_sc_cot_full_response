Question: Define $f(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{4}|$. Find the number of intersections of the graphs of \[y=4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \quad\text{ and }\quad x=4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))).\]\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent UjlF', content='We look for intersections of y=A(x)=H(|sin2πx|) and x=B(y)=H(|cos3πy|) on [0,1].  Here H(u)=4| |u|−¼| is W-shaped on [0,1] with peaks 1 at u=0,½,1 and valleys 0 at u=¼,¾.  The function A(x) is periodic on [0,1] with |sin2πx| giving 4 ‘‘hills’’ and 4 ‘‘valleys,’’ producing 16 monotonic segments on which A runs monotonically between 0 and 1 or 1 and 0.  On each such segment A(x) spans the full [0,1], so composing B(A(x))=T(x) reproduces B(y) on a full y‐range from 0→1 or 1→0.  B(y)=H(|cos3πy|) on y∈[0,1] has 3 interior valleys (at B=0) and 4 peaks (at B=1), hence on each monotonic A‐segment T(x) oscillates through 3 full «down↔up» cycles, crossing the diagonal y=x exactly 6 times per segment (sign changes at each extremum).  There are 16 such segments → 16·6=96 roots in (0,1), plus the endpoint x=1 yields T(1)=1 so x=1 is also a solution.  Hence total intersections = 97.\n\nAnswer:97', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
