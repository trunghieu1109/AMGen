Question: Find the largest possible real part of \[(75+117i)z+\frac{96+144i}{z}\]where $z$ is a complex number with $|z|=4$.
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: We want to maximize Re[(75+117i)z + (96+144i)/z] subject to |z|=4. Write z = 4 e^{iθ}. Then the expression becomes
 E(θ) = 4(75+117i)e^{iθ} + (96+144i)/(4 e^{iθ})
       = (300+468i)e^{iθ} + (24+36i)e^{-iθ}.
Its real part is
 Re E = 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ + 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.
The maximum of A cosθ + B sinθ is √(A²+B²). Here A=324, B=−432 (since −432 sinθ = 432·(−sinθ), but magnitude same). So max = √(324²+432²) = √(104976+186624) = √291600 = 540.
