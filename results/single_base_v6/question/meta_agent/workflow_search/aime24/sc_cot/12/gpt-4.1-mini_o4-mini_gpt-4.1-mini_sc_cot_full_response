Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 7QKY', content='We want to maximize Re[(75+117i)z + (96+144i)/z] subject to |z|=4. Write z = 4 e^{iθ}. Then the expression becomes\n E(θ) = 4(75+117i)e^{iθ} + (96+144i)/(4 e^{iθ})\n       = (300+468i)e^{iθ} + (24+36i)e^{-iθ}.\nIts real part is\n Re E = 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ + 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.\nThe maximum of A cosθ + B sinθ is √(A²+B²). Here A=324, B=−432 (since −432 sinθ = 432·(−sinθ), but magnitude same). So max = √(324²+432²) = √(104976+186624) = √291600 = 540.\n\nAnswer:540', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
