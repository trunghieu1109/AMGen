Question: Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent bu1y', content='Let walk distance=9 km, walk speed s km/h, coffee time t minutes. Total time at speed s: 9/s + t/60 =4 h. At speed s+2: 9/(s+2)+ t/60=2.4 h. Subtract: 9/s−9/(s+2)=1.6 ⇒18/[s(s+2)]=1.6⇒s^2+2s−11.25=0⇒s=2.5 km/h. Then t/60=4−9/2.5=4−3.6=0.4⇒t=24 min. At speed s+0.5=3 km/h walk time=9/3=3 h=180 min; plus 24 min coffee=204 min.\n\nAnswer:204', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
