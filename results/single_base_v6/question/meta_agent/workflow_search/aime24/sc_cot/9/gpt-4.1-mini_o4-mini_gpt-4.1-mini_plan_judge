Question: Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: We need the probability that all 4 of Jen’s numbers match the drawn numbers (grand prize) given that at least 2 match (prize). There are C(10,4)=210 equally likely draws. Prize-winning draws have intersection size 2, 3, or 4 with Jen’s fixed 4-number set. Count: for intersection size i, there are C(4,i)*C(6,4−i) draws. Summing for i=2,3,4 gives 6*15 + 4*6 + 1 = 90 + 24 + 1 = 115 prize draws. Only 1 draw matches all 4 (grand prize). The conditional probability is 1/115, so m=1, n=115, and m+n=116.
