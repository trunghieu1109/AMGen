Question: Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?

proposed answer: We need the probability that a random two‐coloring of the 8 vertices admits a nontrivial rotation r for which no two blue vertices are r apart. Equivalently the “bad” colorings are those whose blue set B has for every nonzero r at least one blue–blue pair separated by r. One checks that such B must have size ≥5, and counting shows all subsets of sizes 5,6,7,8 satisfy the bad condition. There are C(8,5)=56, C(8,6)=28, C(8,7)=8, C(8,8)=1, total 93 bad colorings. Hence good colorings =256−93=163. The probability is 163/256, so m+n=163+256=419.
