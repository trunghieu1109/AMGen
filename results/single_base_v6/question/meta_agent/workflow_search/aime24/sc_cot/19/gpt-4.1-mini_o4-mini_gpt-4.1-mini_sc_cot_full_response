Question: Let $\omega\neq 1$ be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\]
is divided by 1000.\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 2KIX', content='We need P = ∏_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) where ω^13=1.  Notice 2 - 2x + x^2 = x^2 -2x +2 = f(x).  Thus P = ∏_{x^13=1} f(x) = resultant(f(x), x^13-1).  Equivalently P = ∏_{f(r)=0}(r^13 -1), where the roots of f are r=1±i.  Compute (1+i)^13 = -64(1+i) so (1+i)^13 -1 = -65 -64i, and its conjugate for (1-i).  Thus P = |-65 -64i|^2 = 65^2+64^2 = 4225+4096 = 8321.  Finally 8321 mod 1000 = 321.\n\nAnswer:321', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
