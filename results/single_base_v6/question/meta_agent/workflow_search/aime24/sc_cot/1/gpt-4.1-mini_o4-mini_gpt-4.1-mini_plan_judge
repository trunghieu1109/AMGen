Question: Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.

proposed answer: We use the fact that if D is the intersection of the tangents at B,C to the circumcircle of ABC, then for the line AD meeting the circle again at P we have DA·DP = DB^2, where DB is the tangent length from D to the circle.  We compute:
1.  By the law of cosines in ABC with AB=5, BC=9, AC=10, we get cos∠A = (5^2+10^2−9^2)/(2·5·10)=11/25.
2.  In the isosceles triangle DBC (DB=DC), ∠BDC =180°−2A, so
   BC =2·DB·cos A  ⇒  DB=BC/(2cos A)=9/(2·11/25)=225/22.
3.  Hence DB^2=50625/484.
4.  From power of D: DA·DP=DB^2, and DP=DA+AP ⇒ DA(DA+AP)=DB^2 ⇒ AP=(DB^2−DA^2)/DA.
5.  To find DA we place B=(−4.5,0),C=(4.5,0), solve for A, find the circumcenter and D=(0,−27√14/11), then parametrize AD and solve the circle–secant intersection by Vieta’s in the quadratic in t.  One finds DA=325/22 and the other intersection occurs at t=968/1859, giving
   AP = (968/1859)·(325/22) =100/13.
Thus m+n=100+13=113.
