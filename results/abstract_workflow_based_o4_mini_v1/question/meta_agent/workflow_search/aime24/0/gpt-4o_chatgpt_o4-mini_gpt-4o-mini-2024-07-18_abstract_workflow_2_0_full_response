Question: Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.

Subtracting yields 1.6 = 18/(s(s+2)), so s(s+2)=11.25, giving s=2.5 km/h.

Subtracting gives 9/s - 9/(s+2) = 1.6 → s(s+2)=11.25 → s=2.5. Then 9/2.5=3.6 so t/60=4–3.6=0.4 → t=24.; answer: 24\nCoT-SC agent A1Sg, determining coffee shop time `t`, thinking: We have two equations: 9/s + t/60 = 4 and 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4. Substituting s = 9/(4 - t/60) into the second yields a quadratic t^2 - 384t + 8640 = 0. Its solutions are t = 360 or t = 24, and 360 minutes is not plausible for a coffee break, so t = 24 minutes.; answer: 24\nCoT-SC agent 2pni, determining coffee shop time `t`, thinking: We have equations: 9/s + t/60 = 4 and 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4. From the first, s=9/(4–t/60). Sub into the second yields quadratic t^2–384t+8640=0 with solutions t=24 or 360.

Walking time: 9/(s+2) hours plus t minutes.\n[TOO_HARD]\nSuggestion: Use the second walking scenario (at speed s+2 km/h with total time 2\u2009h\u200924\u2009min including t) to form a second equation and solve for s and t numerically.\nCoT-SC agent 6jNj, calculating new speed for pacing 2 km/h more, thinking: To increase her pace by 2 km/h, her speed becomes s+2. The time spent walking 9 km at this speed is 9/(s+2) hours. Including t minutes in the coffee shop, the total time is 9/(s+2)+(t/60) hours, which equals 2 h 24 min.; answer: Speed: s+2 km/h; walking time: 9/(s+2) hours; total time including coffee stop: 2 hours 24 minutes.\nCoT-SC agent vuUW, calculating new speed for pacing 2 km/h more, thinking: We have the system 9/s + t/60 = 4 and 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4.
