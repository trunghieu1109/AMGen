Question: Example(question='What is the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c?\n\nKnowing that X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons.\n\nPS: the precision of the energy is at 1e-4.', choice1='18.475 GeV', choice2='20.132 GeV', choice3='23.069 GeV', choice4='21.419', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_31
proposed answer: Compute differences: |18.475−14.4077|=4.0673, |20.132−14.4077|=5.7243, |23.069−14.4077|=8.6613, |21.419−14.4077|=7.0113. The smallest difference is 4.0673 for choice1 (18.475 GeV), so the closest is A).
