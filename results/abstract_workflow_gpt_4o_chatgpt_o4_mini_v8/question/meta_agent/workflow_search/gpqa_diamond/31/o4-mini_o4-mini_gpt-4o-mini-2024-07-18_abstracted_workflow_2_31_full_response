Given it has 3 neutrons, N = 3. The mass number A = Z + N = 3 + 3 = 6.; answer: Z = 3, N = 3, A = 6.\nCoT-SC agent X5c8, retrieving rest mass, thinking: To find the rest mass of the 6Li nucleus, one uses the atomic mass from nuclear tables (mass excess method) and, if a pure nuclear mass is needed, subtracts the 3 electron masses.  The standard atomic mass of 6Li is 6.015122795 u, so the nuclear mass is 6.015122795 u – (3 × 0.000548579909 u) ≃ 6.013478 u.; answer: 6.015122795 u\nCoT-SC agent S9Oa, retrieving rest mass, thinking: The standard atomic mass of 6Li is 6.0151228874 u (AME2016). Subtracting 3 electron masses (3×0.000548579909 u) gives the 6Li nuclear rest mass ≃6.013477 u, rounded to four decimal places.; answer: 6.0135 u\nCoT-SC agent Qo95, retrieving rest mass, thinking: To find the nuclear mass of 6Li, start from the atomic mass of 6Li (6.0151223\u2009u) and subtract the masses of 3 electrons (3×0.00054858\u2009u≈0.00164574\u2009u). This yields the rest mass of the 6Li nucleus.; answer: The standard rest mass of the 6Li nucleus is 6.0134766 u.\nReflexion CoT agent 11lO, converting mass units, thinking: Convert the atomic mass in u to energy using 1 u = 931.494 MeV/c². Thus 6.015122795 u × 931.494 MeV/u ≃ 5603.05 MeV/c², then divide by 1000 to get GeV.; answer: 5603.05 MeV/c², which is 5.60305 GeV/c²\nCritic agent NkID, feedback on conversion, thinking: The conversion is done correctly. Using 1 u = 931.494 MeV/c² and multiplying by 6.015122795 u gives 5603.05 MeV/c², which is 5.60305 GeV/c². If one uses the more precise factor 931.49410242 MeV/c², the result shifts negligibly to 5603.051 MeV/c² (5.603051 GeV/c²), so the stated value is accurate to better than 1×10⁻⁴ GeV.; answer: 5.60305 GeV/c²\nReflexion CoT agent 11lO, refining unit conversion, thinking: To convert from atomic mass units to energy, multiply by the conversion factor 1 u = 931.494 MeV/c². Thus 6.015122795 u × 931.494 MeV/u ≃ 5603.05 MeV/c², and dividing by 1000 gives 5.60305 GeV/c².; answer: 5603.05 MeV/c², which is 5.60305 GeV/c²\nCoT agent uz3r, identifying formulas, thinking: To answer sub-task 4, we simply state the standard relativistic formulas for gamma and kinetic energy given the velocity parameter.; answer: Relativistic formulas:\n1) Lorentz factor: γ = 1/√(1 – v²/c²), for v = 0.96c\n2) Kinetic energy: Eₖ = (γ – 1) m c²\nCoT agent 0Ph6, computing Lorentz factor, thinking: We apply γ = 1/√(1 – v²/c²) with v = 0.96c: v²/c² = 0.96² = 0.9216, so 1 – v²/c² = 0.0784, √0.0784 = 0.28, hence γ = 1/0.28 ≈ 3.5714286. Rounding to 1e-4 gives γ ≈ 3.5714.; answer: Using v = 0.96c, the Lorentz factor γ is approximately 3.5714.\nDebate agent uDEp, round 0, computing E_k, thinking: We have γ≈3.5714 and m₀≈5.60305\u2009GeV/c².
