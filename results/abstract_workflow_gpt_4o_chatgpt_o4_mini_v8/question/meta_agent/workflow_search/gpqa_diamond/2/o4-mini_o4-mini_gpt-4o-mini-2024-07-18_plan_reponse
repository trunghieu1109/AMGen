            "A spin-half particle is in a linear superposition 0.5|\\uparrow\\rangle+sqrt(3)/2|\\downarrow\\rangle of its spin-up and spin-down states. If |\\uparrow\\rangle and |\\downarrow\\rangle are the eigenstates of \\sigma{z} , then what is the expectation value up to one decimal place, of the operator 10\\sigma{z}+5\\sigma_{x} ?
