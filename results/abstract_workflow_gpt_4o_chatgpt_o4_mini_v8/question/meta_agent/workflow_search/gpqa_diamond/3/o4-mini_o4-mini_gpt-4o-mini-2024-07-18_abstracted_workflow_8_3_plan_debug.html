    <pre>Related original question:

{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;In a parallel universe where a magnet can have an isolated North or South pole, Maxwell’s equations look different. But, specifically, which of those equations are different?&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;The one related to the divergence of the magnetic field. &#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;The ones related to the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field.&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;The ones related to the circulation of the electric field and the divergence of the magnetic field.  &#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;The one related to the circulation of the magnetic field and the flux of the electric field. &#39;}. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 6: Based on the actual modified equations from Sub-task 4 and the choice interpretations from Sub-task 5, determine which choice matches exactly. 

 ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent a9bL:
The modified Maxwell’s equations include additional monopole terms only in Gauss’s law for magnetism (∇·B) and Faraday’s law (∇×E). From the choice interpretations, Choice 3 exactly names these two equations.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent 5ZtY:
The modified Maxwell equations include monopole terms in Gauss’s law for magnetism (∇·B≠0) and in Faraday’s law (∇×E has an extra −J_m term). That matches choice 3, which states the divergence of the magnetic field and the circulation of the electric field differ.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent yEwv:
The modified Maxwell’s equations include monopole terms in Gauss’s law for magnetism (∇·B=μ₀ρₘ) and in Faraday’s law (∇×E=−∂B/∂t−Jₘ). These correspond to the divergence of B and the circulation (curl) of E being different, which matches choice 3.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent KWRV:
Sub-task 4 shows modified equations ∇·B=μ₀ρₘ and ∇×E=–∂B/∂t–Jₘ, so only Gauss’s law for magnetism (div B) and Faraday’s law (curl E) acquire monopole terms. Sub-task 5 maps these to choice 3.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Make final decision on correct choice.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
