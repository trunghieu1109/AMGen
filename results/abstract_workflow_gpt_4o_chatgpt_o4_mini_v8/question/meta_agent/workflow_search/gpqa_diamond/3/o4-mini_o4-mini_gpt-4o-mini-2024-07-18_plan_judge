Question: Example(question='In a parallel universe where a magnet can have an isolated North or South pole, Maxwell’s equations look different. But, specifically, which of those equations are different?', choice1='The one related to the divergence of the magnetic field. ', choice2='The ones related to the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field.', choice3='The ones related to the circulation of the electric field and the divergence of the magnetic field.  ', choice4='The one related to the circulation of the magnetic field and the flux of the electric field. ', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_3
proposed answer: Allowing magnetic monopoles adds a μ₀ρ_m term to Gauss’s law for magnetism (∇·B) and a –μ₀J_m term to Faraday’s law (∇×E), so only those two equations change.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_8_3
proposed answer: The modified Maxwell’s equations with magnetic monopoles introduce terms in Gauss’s law for magnetism (∇·B) and in Faraday’s law (∇×E). Choice 3 states exactly those two equations are different.
