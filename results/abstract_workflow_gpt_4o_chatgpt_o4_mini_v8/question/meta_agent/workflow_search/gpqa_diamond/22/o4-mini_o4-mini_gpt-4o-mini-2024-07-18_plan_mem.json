        "Choice 1 is correct because the mechanism favors intramolecular Friedel\u2013Crafts cyclization to chromane and intramolecular 5-exo-trig cyclization to dihydrobenzofuran, producing exactly the two products in choice 1. Choices 2 and 4 only give bromoethers, choice 3 gives phenols, and none match the two cyclized products observed.": "95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval: (0.0%, 0.0%), Median: 0.0%"
