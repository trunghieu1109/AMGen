The equilibrium constant (formation constant) relates the concentration of the complex to the product of the free ion concentrations.; answer: CaEDTA²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\nK = [CaEDTA²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻])\nCoT agent eBBW, thinking: Introduce x as the amount of Ca-EDTA that dissociates at equilibrium, yielding x for both Ca2+ and EDTA4- and reducing the complex by x.; answer: [Ca2+] = x, [EDTA4-] = x, [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 - x\nCoT agent sY4v, thinking: We set up the equilibrium expression for Ca–EDTA dissociation: K = [Ca2+][EDTA4–]/[Ca–EDTA] = x·x/(0.02–x) = x^2/(0.02–x). Substituting K = 5×10^10 and rearranging gives 5×10^10·x^2 = 0.02–x, or 5×10^10·x^2 + x – 0.02 = 0.; answer: 5×10^10·x^2 + x – 0.02 = 0\nCoT-SC agent gVqW, thinking: We have the quadratic 5×10¹⁰·x² + x – 0.02 = 0 with a = 5×10¹⁰, b = 1, c = –0.02. The discriminant Δ = b² – 4ac = 1 + 4·5×10¹⁰·0.02 = 1 + 4×10⁹ = 4.000000001×10⁹. sqrt(Δ) ≈ 6.32455532×10⁴. The positive root is x = [–1 + sqrt(Δ)]/(2·5×10¹⁰) = (6.32445532×10⁴)/(1×10¹¹) ≈ 6.32×10⁻⁷ M.; answer: x ≈ 6.32×10⁻⁷ M\nCoT-SC agent NFHe, thinking: We use the quadratic formula for ax^2 + bx + c = 0 with a = 5×10^10, b = 1, c = -0.02. The discriminant Δ = b^2 - 4ac = 1 + 4·5×10^10·0.02 = 1 + 4×10^9. Thus x = [ -1 ± sqrt(1 + 4×10^9 ) ] / (2·5×10^10) = [ -1 ± sqrt(4×10^9 + 1) ] / 1×10^11. The positive root is x ≈ ( -1 + 63 245.553 ) / 1×10^11 ≈ 6.32×10^-7 M.; answer: x = [ -1 + sqrt(1 + 4·5×10^10·0.02 ) ] / (1×10^11) ≈ 6.3×10^-7 M\nCoT-SC agent caWi, thinking: To solve 5×10^10 x^2 + x – 0.02 = 0, use the quadratic formula: x = [–b ± sqrt(b^2 – 4ac)]/(2a) with a = 5×10^10, b = 1, c = –0.02. The discriminant D = 1 – 4·5×10^10·(–0.02) = 1 + 4×10^9 ≈ 4.000000001×10^9. sqrt(D) ≈ 6.32455532×10^4. Thus x = [–1 ± 6.32455532×10^4]/(1×10^11). The two roots are x ≈ (6.32445532×10^4)/(1×10^11) ≈ 6.3245×10^-7 and x ≈ (–6.32465532×10^4)/(1×10^11) ≈ –6.3247×10^-7. Only the positive root is physically meaningful.; answer: x = [–1 ± sqrt(1 + 4·5×10^10·0.02)]/(2·5×10^10) ≈ 6.3×10^–7 M (the positive, physical solution)\nReflexion CoT agent QAtP, thinking: We have quadratic roots: x = [–1 ± √(1+4·5×10¹⁰·0.02)]/(2·5×10¹⁰). Numerically, √Δ ≈6.32455532×10⁴. Thus x₁ = (–1+6.32455532×10⁴)/(1×10¹¹) ≈6.32×10⁻⁷ M, x₂ = (–1–6.32455532×10⁴)/(1×10¹¹) ≈–6.32×10⁻⁴ M. The negative root is nonphysical; the positive root is much smaller than 0.02 M and is physically meaningful.; answer: x ≈6.32×10⁻⁷ M\nCritic agent 52x1, feedback: The positive root x ≈6.32×10⁻⁷ M is indeed the physically meaningful solution: it is positive and much smaller than the total 0.02 M, while the other root is negative and nonphysical.; correct: 6.3×10⁻⁷ M\nReflexion CoT agent QAtP, thinking: Using the quadratic formula on 5×10^10·x² + x – 0.02 = 0 gives two roots: x₁ ≈6.32×10⁻⁷ M and x₂ ≈–6.32×10⁻⁴ M. The negative root is nonphysical, so the physically meaningful root is the positive, much smaller one.; answer: x ≈ 6.32×10⁻⁷ M\nCoT agent vqH8, thinking: The physically meaningful root [Ca2+]≈6.32×10⁻⁷ M matches the provided choice 6.3×10⁻⁷ M, which is option C).; answer: C)\nDebate agent cMGJ, round 0, thinking: We compare the computed [Ca2+] ≈6.32×10⁻⁷ M with the provided options and find it matches 6.3×10⁻⁷ M, which is choice C).; answer: C)\nDebate agent zDyf, round 0, thinking: The calculated [Ca2+] ≈6.32×10⁻⁷ M corresponds to the provided choice 6.3×10⁻⁷ M, which is option C).; answer: C)\nDebate agent HhPU, round 0, thinking: The calculated free Ca²⁺ concentration (~6.32×10⁻⁷ M) corresponds to choice 6.3×10⁻⁷ M, i.e., option C).; answer: C)\nDebate agent kmoL, round 0, thinking: The calculated free calcium concentration is approximately 6.32×10⁻⁷ M, which corresponds to the provided choice 6.3×10⁻⁷ M.; answer: C)\nFinal Decision agent SwYl, thinking: Calculated free Ca2+ concentration ≈6.32×10⁻⁷ M matches the given choice 6.3×10⁻⁷ M, which is option C).; answer: C)', iteration_idx=-1)]
