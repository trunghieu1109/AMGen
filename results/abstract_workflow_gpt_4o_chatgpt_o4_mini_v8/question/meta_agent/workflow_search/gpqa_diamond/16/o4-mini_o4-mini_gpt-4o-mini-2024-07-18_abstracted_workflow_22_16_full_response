Therefore, that is the value of Kf.; answer: The formation constant Kf for the Ca–EDTA complex is 5×10^10.\nCoT agent MCjL, determining target quantity, thinking: We identify that the quantity to be determined is the equilibrium concentration of free calcium ions, [Ca2+], after partial dissociation of the Ca–EDTA complex. No further information is needed to state the target quantity.; answer: The target quantity is the equilibrium concentration of free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]).\nCoT agent YWUl, noting assumptions, thinking: The sub-task asks to note the assumption that at ideal pH and 25 °C EDTA is fully deprotonated. This means we can treat EDTA as Y4– in calculations without worrying about protonation equilibria. No additional data is needed.; answer: Under ideal pH and T = 25 °C, EDTA is fully deprotonated (Y4–), so the given KCa‐EDTA applies directly to the Ca2+–Y4– equilibrium without considering protonation states.\nReflexion CoT agent 5N6p, writing equilibrium and Kf expression, thinking: The task asks for the dissociation reaction of the Ca–EDTA complex and the corresponding formation constant expression, which are standard definitions.; answer: CaEDTA^{2-} ⇌ Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}\nKf = [CaEDTA^{2-}]/([Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}])\nCritic agent 2VLf, feedback round 0, thinking: The dissociation reaction and formation constant expression are correct: CaEDTA2– ⇌ Ca2+ + EDTA4– and Kf = [CaEDTA2–]/([Ca2+][EDTA4–]).; answer: yes\nReflexion CoT agent 5N6p, refining equilibrium and Kf expression, thinking: The dissociation reaction and formation constant expression follow the standard definition for metal–EDTA complexes: dissociation writes the complex dissociating into metal ion and EDTA4–, and Kf is defined as the ratio of complex concentration to the product of free ion concentrations.; answer: CaEDTA2- ⇌ Ca2+ + EDTA4-; Kf = [CaEDTA2-]/([Ca2+][EDTA4-])\nCoT agent vYeA, setting up mass-balance, thinking: We define the variable x as the equilibrium concentrations of free Ca2+ and EDTA4–. The initial total Ca–EDTA complex is 0.02 M, so the remaining complex at equilibrium is 0.02 – x.; answer: Let x = [Ca2+]eq = [EDTA4-]eq, then [CaEDTA2-]eq = 0.02 - x.\nCoT agent OfZu, deriving relation, thinking: We substitute [CaEDTA2-] = 0.02 - x and [Ca2+] = [EDTA4-] = x into the formation constant expression Kf = [CaEDTA2-]/([Ca2+][EDTA4-]).; answer: Kf = (0.02 - x)/(x·x)\nCoT agent Qcor, solving for x, thinking: Under the assumption Kf ≫ 1, we set x ≈ √(0.02/Kf). Substituting Kf = 5×10^10 gives x ≈ √(0.02/5×10^10) = √(4×10^−13) ≈ 2×10^−6.5 ≈ 6.3×10^−7 M.; answer: x ≈ 6.3×10^−7 M\nDebate agent ctX7, round 0, thinking: We computed x ≈ √(0.02/5×10^10) = 6.3×10^-7 M, which matches choice 3.; answer: C)\nDebate agent g2dS, round 0, thinking: We previously approximated x ≈ √(0.02/5×10^10) ≈ 6.3×10^−7 M.
