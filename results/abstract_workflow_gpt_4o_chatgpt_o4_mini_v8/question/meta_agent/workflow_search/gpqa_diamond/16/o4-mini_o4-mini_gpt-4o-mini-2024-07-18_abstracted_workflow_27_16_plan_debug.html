{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex (we assume that the pH is ideal, T = 25 °C). KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10.&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;1.0x10^-2 M &#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;5.0x10^-3 M&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;6.3x10^-7 M&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;2.0x10^-2 M &#39;}.
