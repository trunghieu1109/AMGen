Since the pion is at rest, its initial momentum is zero. By conservation of momentum, the muon and neutrino momenta are equal and opposite. Energy conservation also applies, equating initial and final energies.; answer: Initial momentum is zero (pi+ at rest). Momentum is conserved: mu+ and nu have equal and opposite momenta. Energy is conserved: total energy before decay equals sum of energies of mu+ and nu.\nCoT agent cw6l, momentum conservation, thinking: The question asks for the momentum conservation equation in the pion rest frame, which straightforwardly is p_mu + p_nu = 0, implying equal magnitudes of the muon and neutrino momenta.; answer: p_mu + p_nu = 0 ⇒ |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p\nCoT agent aOoO, energy conservation, thinking: The sub-task simply asks to express the conservation of energy for the decay, stating that the rest energy of the pion equals the sum of the total energies of the decay products.; answer: m_{\\pi}=E_{\\mu}+E_{\\nu}\nwhere\nE_{\\mu}=\\sqrt{p^{2}+m_{\\mu}^{2}},\nE_{\\nu}=\\sqrt{p^{2}+m_{\\nu}^{2}}\nCoT agent R9L8, energy expressions, thinking: The sub-task asks to state the expressions for the muon and neutrino energies in terms of p and m_mu. For the muon, E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2); for the neutrino (massless), E_nu = p.; answer: E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2); E_nu = p\nCoT-SC agent HSh5, solving for p, thinking: To solve m_pi = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) + p for p, isolate the square root: m_pi - p = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2). Square both sides: (m_pi - p)^2 = p^2 + m_mu^2. Expand: m_pi^2 - 2 m_pi p + p^2 = p^2 + m_mu^2. Cancel p^2: m_pi^2 - 2 m_pi p = m_mu^2. Solve for p: 2 m_pi p = m_pi^2 - m_mu^2, so p = (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2)/(2 m_pi).; answer: p = (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2)/(2*m_pi)\nCoT-SC agent DQLL, solving for p, thinking: To isolate p, start with m_pi = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) + p. Rearranged: m_pi - p = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2). Square both sides: m_pi^2 - 2 m_pi p + p^2 = p^2 + m_mu^2. Cancel p^2 and solve for p: 2 m_pi p = m_pi^2 - m_mu^2, hence p = (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2)/(2 m_pi).; answer: p = (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2)/(2*m_pi)\nCoT-SC agent SfEn, solving for p, thinking: Start with m_pi = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) + p.

Substituting m_pi = 139.6 MeV and m_mu = 105.7 MeV: p = (139.6^2 - 105.7^2)/(2*139.6) = (19488.16 - 11172.49)/279.2 ≈ 8315.67/279.2 ≈ 29.8 MeV/c.; answer: 29.8 MeV/c\nCoT agent OTPl, KE_nu calculation, thinking: For a (nearly) massless neutrino, kinetic energy KE≈pc.
