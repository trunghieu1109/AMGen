{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Find KE of product particles in,\nPi(+) = mu(+) + nu\nhere Pi(+) is stationary.\nRest mass of Pi(+) &amp;  mu(+) is 139.6 MeV &amp; 105.7 MeV respectively.&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV&#39;}. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 11: Compare KE_nu and KE_mu to the provided choices and select the matching choice. 

 ### thinking by Debate Agent XNLb:
We computed KE_nu = 29.8 MeV and KE_mu = 4.12 MeV, which matches choice 4 (4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV).

### thinking by Debate Agent vVmN:
Based on the computed KE_nu = 29.8 MeV and KE_mu = 4.12 MeV, the only matching choice is choice4 (4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV), corresponding to D).

### thinking by Debate Agent 8BGn:
The computed kinetic energies are KE_ν = 29.8 MeV and KE_μ = 4.12 MeV, which corresponds exactly to choice 4.

### thinking by Debate Agent aoDL:
Comparing KE_nu = 29.8 MeV and KE_mu = 4.12 MeV with the provided options, they match choice4.

### answer by Debate Agent XNLb:
D)

### answer by Debate Agent vVmN:
D)

### answer by Debate Agent 8BGn:
D)

### answer by Debate Agent aoDL:
D)

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 11: Make final decision on choice.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
