This is straightforward: π+ → μ+ + ν_μ.; answer: Sub-task 1: π+ → μ+ + ν_μ\nCoT-SC agent hSub, extracting masses, thinking: The problem statement provides the rest masses directly: π+ has 139.6 MeV and μ+ has 105.7 MeV.; answer: m_pi = 139.6 MeV, m_mu = 105.7 MeV\nCoT-SC agent DGcJ, extracting masses, thinking: The problem statement explicitly states the rest masses: π+ has mass 139.6 MeV and μ+ has mass 105.7 MeV.; answer: m_pi = 139.6 MeV; m_mu = 105.7 MeV\nCoT-SC agent valg, extracting masses, thinking: The problem statement specifies the rest masses of π+ and μ+ directly: 139.6 MeV and 105.7 MeV respectively, so extraction is trivial.; answer: Sub-task 2: m_pi = 139.6 MeV; m_mu = 105.7 MeV\nCoT agent ezO7, determining conservation laws, thinking: In any isolated two-body decay, total energy and momentum are conserved. With the pion at rest and negligible neutrino mass, we have E_π = E_μ + E_ν and 0 = p_μ + p_ν.; answer: Energy conservation: E_π = E_μ + E_ν; Momentum conservation: 0 = p_μ + p_ν\nCoT agent m7kK, writing conservation equations, thinking: The question simply asks to state the conservation equations for energy and momentum in the two-body decay with a stationary pion. No additional information is missing, and it’s straightforward to provide the required expressions.; answer: E_pi = E_mu + E_nu\n0 = p_mu - p_nu\nDebate agent FuR4, round 0, computing p, thinking: Calculated m_pi^2 = 139.6^2 = 19488.16 MeV^2, m_mu^2 = 105.7^2 = 11172.49 MeV^2. Their difference 8315.67 MeV^2 divided by 2 m_pi = 279.2 MeV gives p ≈29.8 MeV.; answer: p ≈ 29.8 MeV/c\nDebate agent 9Us2, round 0, computing p, thinking: We apply the formula p = (m_π^2 – m_μ^2)/(2 m_π) with m_π = 139.6\u2009MeV, m_μ = 105.7\u2009MeV. Compute m_π^2 = 19488.16\u2009MeV^2, m_μ^2 = 11172.49\u2009MeV^2. The difference is 8315.67\u2009MeV^2.
