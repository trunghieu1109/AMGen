For acyclic alkene 1 there is no chiral center and the Z double bond in a simple alkene does not produce chirality (mirror image superimposable). In 2, the ring junction and E double bond break all symmetry, giving a chiral molecule. Compound 3 is the meso form of dimethylsuccinic acid (internal mirror plane), so achiral. Compound 4 is a single enantiomer (no symmetry), so chiral. Compound 5 has one sp^3 stereocenter and no symmetry, so chiral. Compound 6, despite three stereocenters, has an S3 improper axis (all three substituents identical and symmetrically arranged), rendering it achiral (meso-like). Compound 7 has one stereocenter at the α‐carbon to the ketone, no symmetry, so chiral.; answer: 1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Achiral (no chiral centers; Z-alkene alone is not chiral)\n2.
