Thus there are no stereogenic centers and no other element of chirality. The molecule is achiral and cannot be optically active.; answer: No stereogenic centers; achiral; not optically active.\nCoT-SC agent Dfw5, thinking: The structure (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione contains two sp³ stereocenters at positions 3a and 7a, specified as R and S. The exocyclic chloromethylene (E) double bond does not create additional chirality beyond E/Z stereochemistry. There is no internal mirror plane or inversion center because the bicyclic methano bridge and substituents prevent any symmetry element that would render a meso form. Therefore the molecule is chiral and should be optically active.; answer: Two stereocenters at C3a and C7a (R and S), no internal symmetry, chiral and optically active.\nCoT-SC agent gpc1, thinking: The molecule is a bicyclic norbornane‐dicarboxylic anhydride derivative with two bridgehead stereocenters (3a and 7a). The exocyclic chloromethylene (E) double bond does not introduce a sp3 stereocenter. Because the chloromethylene substituent at C-8 destroys the mirror plane that would bisect the parent bicyclic core, there is no internal plane of symmetry and no meso form. Thus the two configured stereocenters (3aR,7aS) make the molecule chiral and optically active.; answer: Stereocenters: C-3a and C-7a (both sp3) E-chloromethylene is a configurational alkene, not a chiral center. No meso form or symmetry present. The compound is chiral and will be optically active.\nCoT-SC agent QKCq, thinking: The bicyclic core has two sp3 stereocenters at the bridgehead carbons 3a and 7a (configured R and S). The 8-(chloromethylene) substituent introduces an E‐alkene stereochemistry but no additional stereocenter. There is no internal plane of symmetry or meso form because the substituent at C8 breaks any symmetry. Thus the molecule is chiral and will be optically active.; answer: Stereocenters at C3a and C7a; no meso; chiral; optically active.\nCoT agent 9ICf, thinking: The molecule (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid has two stereocenters at C-2 and C-3. Because one center is R and the other is S, and the substituents are identical on both ends, an internal mirror plane bisects the molecule, giving a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral and do not rotate plane-polarized light.; answer: Stereocenters at C-2 and C-3; internal mirror plane yields a meso form; optically inactive\nCoT agent xPCH, thinking: The molecule has two stereocenters at C-2 and C-3, both assigned R. With identical configurations (R,R), there is no internal mirror plane to render it meso. The R,R form is the enantiomer of the S,S form and is therefore chiral and optically active.; answer: Stereocenters at C2 and C3 (both R); no meso form; molecule is chiral and optically active.\nCoT agent kpZk, thinking: The compound (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol has only one stereocenter (C-1), no internal plane or center of symmetry, and thus cannot be racemic or meso. Therefore it is chiral and will rotate plane-polarized light.; answer: (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol has one stereocenter at carbon-1, no internal compensation, and is therefore chiral and optically active.\nReflexion CoT agent 2Spq, thinking: The triol has three stereocenters at C1, C3 and C5. With all three centers of the same configuration (1S,3S,5S) and an odd number of stereocenters, there can be no internal mirror plane to make it meso. Instead it exists as an enantiomeric pair (the RRR and SSS forms), so the SSS is chiral and will rotate plane-polarized light.; answer: Optically active\nCritic agent k23u, feedback: The agent correctly identified the three stereocenters at C1, C3 and C5 and reasoned that with an odd number of identical-configured centers (1S,3S,5S) there is no internal mirror plane, so the molecule is chiral. To be more thorough, they could have examined the chair conformation symmetry (noting the C3 axis and absence of σ-planes) and discussed conformational dynamics (chair‐flip interconversion) to rule out any transient meso behavior. The analysis also omits mention of whether rapid chair flips average out chirality in practice. Nonetheless, the core symmetry check and conclusion stand.; correct: The analysis is correct: (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol is optically active.\nReflexion CoT agent 2Spq, refined thinking: We must identify stereocenters at C1, C3, and C5 (all bearing OH and two distinct substituents), then look for symmetry elements. With all three centers configured S (an odd number of like stereocenters) there is no internal mirror plane to render the molecule meso. The cyclohexane adopts a chiral chair conformation (point group C3) without σ‐planes. Chair flips interchange axial/equatorial but do not introduce a mirror plane; both enantiomers remain distinct. Hence the SSS stereoisomer is chiral and optically active.; answer: (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol has three stereocenters, no internal mirror plane, and adopts a chiral C3-symmetric chair conformation. It is optically active.\nCoT agent uCdO, thinking: The ketone carbon (C1) is sp2 and cannot be a stereocenter. The only potential stereocenter is C3, but it bears two identical methyl groups (one as the chain terminus and one as the 3-methyl substituent), so it is not stereogenic. The cyclopentyl ring is symmetric and introduces no chirality. Thus the molecule has no stereogenic centers or chiral elements and is achiral.; answer: 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: no stereogenic centers or chiral elements; achiral and not optically active.\nCoT agent OYu9, thinking: Evaluate each compound: 1) no stereocenter (Z-alkene), achiral; 2) two stereocenters in a bridged system, chiral; 3) R,S meso succinic acid, achiral; 4) R,R succinic acid, chiral; 5) (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, chiral center on ring, chiral; 6) (1S,3S,5S)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol is a meso form with D3d symmetry, achiral; 7) 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one has one stereocenter at C3, chiral.
