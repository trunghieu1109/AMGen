Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 8: Aggregate the determinations from Sub-tasks 1 through 7 to compute the total count of compounds that exhibit optical activity. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent OYu9:
Evaluate each compound: 1) no stereocenter (Z-alkene), achiral; 2) two stereocenters in a bridged system, chiral; 3) R,S meso succinic acid, achiral; 4) R,R succinic acid, chiral; 5) (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, chiral center on ring, chiral; 6) (1S,3S,5S)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol is a meso form with D3d symmetry, achiral; 7) 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one has one stereocenter at C3, chiral. Total = 4 optically active compounds.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent OYu9:
B)

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 9: Compare the computed total number of optically active compounds from Sub-task 8 with the provided choices (3, 4, 2, 5) and select the matching answer.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
