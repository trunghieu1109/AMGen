Assuming LTE and using the EW method, astronomers have determined the elemental abundances of these two stars: [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex, and [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. Consider the following photospheric composition for the Sun: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 and 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7. Calculate the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2.\n",
