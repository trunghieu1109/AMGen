{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10^-9 sec and 10^-8 sec, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which one of the following options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?\n&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;10^-9 eV&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;10^-11 eV&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;10^-8 eV\n&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;10^-4 eV&#39;}. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 3: Identify the larger of the two uncertainties ΔE1 and ΔE2 to determine the minimum energy separation required. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent OOE7:
We compare the two computed uncertainties: ΔE1 ≈ 3.29×10⁻⁷ eV and ΔE2 ≈ 3.29×10⁻⁸ eV. The larger of these is ΔE1.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent OOE7:
The larger uncertainty is ΔE1 ≈ 3.29×10⁻⁷ eV, so the minimum energy separation required is about 3.29×10⁻⁷ eV.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Compare the computed threshold with the provided options and select the smallest option exceeding the threshold to resolve the two levels.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>The threshold energy resolution required is ΔE1 ≈ 3.29×10⁻⁷ eV. Comparing the given options: 10⁻⁹ eV, 10⁻¹¹ eV, and 10⁻⁸ eV are all below the threshold, while 10⁻⁴ eV exceeds it. Therefore the smallest option above the threshold is 10⁻⁴ eV.
