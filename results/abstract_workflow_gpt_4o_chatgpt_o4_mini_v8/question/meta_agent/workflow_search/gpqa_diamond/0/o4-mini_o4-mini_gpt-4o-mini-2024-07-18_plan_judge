Question: Example(question='Two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10^-9 sec and 10^-8 sec, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which one of the following options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?\n', choice1='10^-9 eV', choice2='10^-11 eV', choice3='10^-8 eV\n', choice4='10^-4 eV', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_8_0
proposed answer: The threshold energy resolution required is ΔE1 ≈ 3.29×10⁻⁷ eV. Comparing the given options: 10⁻⁹ eV, 10⁻¹¹ eV, and 10⁻⁸ eV are all below the threshold, while 10⁻⁴ eV exceeds it. Therefore the smallest option above the threshold is 10⁻⁴ eV.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_12_0
proposed answer: To clearly distinguish the energy levels, we need an energy difference exceeding the minimum uncertainty δE_min ≈ ħ/(τ) ≈ 6.58×10⁻⁷ eV. Among the provided options, only 10⁻⁴ eV exceeds this threshold, and it is the smallest such option.
