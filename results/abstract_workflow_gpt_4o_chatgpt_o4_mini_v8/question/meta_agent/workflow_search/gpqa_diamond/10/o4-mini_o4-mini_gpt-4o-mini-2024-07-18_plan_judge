Iteration: abstracted_workflow_36_10
proposed answer: Sub-task 2_1 classification yields two false statements (choices 3 and 4), so the prompt’s request for a single false choice is ambiguous.

Answer:[TOO_HARD]
Please clarify whether to select choice 3 or choice 4 as the single false statement.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_44_10
proposed answer: Reviewing subtasks 3–6 shows statements 1 and 2 are well supported by structural and biochemical data, and statement 3 is consistent with known ORF3a-driven extrinsic apoptosis. Statement 4’s claim of a linear correlation between frameshifting efficiency and the number of pseudoknot conformations, plus both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 frameshift signals showing exactly two conformers under tension, contradicts single-molecule unfolding studies that observe multiple, dynamic folding states. Therefore the incorrect statement is choice 4.
