SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 frameshift signals show two pseudoknot conformations under tension: Pseudoknot structural dynamics\nReflexion CoT agent KLDw, evaluating choice1, thinking: Available structural and functional studies indicate that the SARS-CoV-2 −1 ribosomal frameshift signal (slippery sequence plus downstream pseudoknot) is nearly identical in sequence, folding, and frameshifting efficiency to that of SARS-CoV. Thus choice 1’s claim about the mechanism and conformational similarity is correct.; answer: Choice 1’s claim is valid.\nCritic agent z4Ok, feedback: The evaluation correctly concludes that choice 1’s claim is valid. SARS-CoV-2’s –1 ribosomal frameshift signal, including its slippery sequence and downstream pseudoknot, is highly conserved in sequence, folding, and frameshifting efficiency when compared with SARS-CoV, so there are no inaccuracies in the assessment.; correct: No correction needed.\nReflexion CoT agent KLDw, refining evaluation of choice1, thinking: Structural and functional studies demonstrate that the SARS-CoV-2 −1 ribosomal frameshift signal—including its slippery sequence and downstream pseudoknot—is highly conserved with that of SARS-CoV in both sequence and three-dimensional folding. Measured frameshifting efficiencies are also nearly identical. Therefore, the assertion that SARS-CoV-2’s frameshifting signal has the same conformation as SARS-CoV’s is supported by current data.; answer: Choice 1’s claim is valid.\nCoT agent vxai, evaluating choice2, thinking: The nsp14 ExoN domain indeed forms a heterodimer with nsp10 to carry out 3′→5′ exonucleolytic proofreading during RNA replication, improving fidelity by excising misincorporated nucleotides. However, it does not “prevent the breakdown of dsRNA” – it actively cleaves mismatched dsRNA during repair. Thus the description of heterodimer formation and proofreading is correct, but the function ascribed (preventing dsRNA breakdown) is mis‐stated.; answer: Choice 2 is partly correct about nsp10/nsp14 forming an active proofreading complex, but incorrect in claiming it prevents dsRNA breakdown; the ExoN actually cleaves mismatched dsRNA during repair.\nCoT agent 1Rp5, evaluating choice3, thinking: The literature shows SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a can activate both extrinsic (caspase-8) and intrinsic (mitochondrial, caspase-9) apoptotic pathways and may modulate Bcl-2 family proteins. Thus the claim of exclusive extrinsic induction without affecting Bcl-2 is unsupported and overly restrictive.; answer: Choice 3’s assertion is incorrect: ORF3a also engages the intrinsic (mitochondrial) apoptotic pathway and can influence Bcl-2 family proteins, so it does not exclusively trigger caspase-8–mediated extrinsic apoptosis without altering Bcl-2 levels.\nCoT agent Va1l, evaluating choice4, thinking: Choice 4’s claim hinges on two points: (1) that frameshifting efficiency increases strictly in direct proportion to the number of distinct pseudoknot folds under tension, and (2) that both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 frameshift pseudoknots exhibit exactly two tension-induced conformers. In fact, single-molecule force spectroscopy has revealed multiple folding intermediates and a non‐linear relationship between conformational heterogeneity and −1 frameshifting efficiency. Moreover, some studies report three or more transient states in the SARS-CoV pseudoknot. Thus, the linear correlation and “exactly two” conformer assertions are not supported by current data.; answer: Choice 4’s proposition is not supported by existing evidence and is therefore incorrect.\n[TOO_HARD]\nPlease supply detailed single-molecule folding landscapes and quantitative frameshifting efficiencies for each identified pseudoknot conformer in both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 so that the relationship can be rigorously tested.\nDebate agent Cptp, round 0, thinking: Subtasks 3–6 show that choices 1 and 2 are supported by structural and biochemical data, while choice 4’s linear correlation and “exactly two” conformers claim contradicts single-molecule studies.
