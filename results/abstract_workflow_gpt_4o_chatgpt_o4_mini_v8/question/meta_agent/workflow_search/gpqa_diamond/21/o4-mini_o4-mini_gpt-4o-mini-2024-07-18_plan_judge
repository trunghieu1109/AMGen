Iteration: abstracted_workflow_16_21
proposed answer: Thermodynamic data shows O₂/H₂O → OH⁻ has E° = +0.401 V, making O₂ a weaker oxidant in basic solution; O₂ reduction in acidic media has large overpotentials and slow electron‐transfer kinetics, so it reacts slower. Thus the correct pairing is weaker–slower.
