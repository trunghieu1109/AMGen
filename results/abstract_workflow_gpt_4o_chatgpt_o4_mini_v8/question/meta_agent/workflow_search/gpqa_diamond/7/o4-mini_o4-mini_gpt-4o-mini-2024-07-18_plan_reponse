            "You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function \u2013 G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control\u2019s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control\u2019s resistance; 0% \u2012 all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?\n",

Epistasis analysis shows G2 masks both G1 and G3, so G2 is epistatic to them. None of the provided choices state that G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3, so no answer matches perfectly. Choice1 is closest regarding G2 as TF and redundancy, but misassigns epistasis to G1.\n\nAnswer:A)\n[TOO_HARD]\nPlease revise the choices to include G2 being epistatic over both G1 and G3.",
