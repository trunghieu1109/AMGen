    <pre>Related original question:

{&#39;question&#39;: &#34;You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control’s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control’s resistance; 0% ‒ all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes&#39; interaction can you draw from this experiment?\n&#34;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3&#39;}. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 4: Identify which single knockout has 100% susceptibility indicating a transcription factor. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent 2j6h:
Susceptibility is 100% minus the resistance level. The g2 knockout has 0% resistance, thus 100% susceptibility, indicating G2 is the transcription factor.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent 2j6h:
g2

### Make final inference on gene-gene interactions. 

 ### thinking by Final Decision Agent XTai:
By comparing the double‐mutant phenotypes to their respective single mutants, we see: 
- g1g3 (10% resistance) is far more sensitive than g1 (75%) or g3 (50%), indicating G1 and G3 act in parallel/partially redundant pathways.
- g1g2 and g2g3 both show the same zero resistance as g2, so G2 masks the effects of G1 and G3. Thus G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, placing it upstream—consistent with it being the transcription factor.

### answer by Final Decision Agent XTai:
G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, and G1 and G3 function in partially redundant pathways.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Combine transcription factor and interaction inference to select the correct multiple-choice conclusion.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>G2 is clearly the transcription factor (g2 shows 100% susceptibility). G1 and G3 act in parallel redundant pathways (g1g3 is much more sensitive than either single mutant). Epistasis analysis shows G2 masks both G1 and G3, so G2 is epistatic to them. None of the provided choices state that G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3, so no answer matches perfectly. Choice1 is closest regarding G2 as TF and redundancy, but misassigns epistasis to G1.

Answer:A)
[TOO_HARD]
Please revise the choices to include G2 being epistatic over both G1 and G3.</pre>
