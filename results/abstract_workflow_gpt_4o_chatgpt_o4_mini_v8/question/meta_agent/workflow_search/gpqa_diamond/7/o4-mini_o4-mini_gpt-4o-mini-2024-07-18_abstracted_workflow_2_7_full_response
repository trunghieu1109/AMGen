This pattern reflects functional redundancy between G1 and G3 acting in parallel pathways, with no one gene masking the other (no classical epistasis).\n\n### answer by Final Decision Agent a1IU:\nG1 and G3 function redundantly and neither gene is epistatic over the other.\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Map the inferred transcription factor (Sub-task 4) and G1-G3 interaction model (Sub-task 5) onto the provided answer choices and select the matching choice.\n\nIf the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the "answer" entry and justify why you think so in the "thinking" entry'}], sub_tasks=None, agents="CoT agent iWQ8, tabulating resistance levels, thinking: The sub-task asks to extract and tabulate the given resistance percentages for each single and double mutant. All values are provided directly in the prompt.; answer: Single mutants:\n- g1: 75% of control\n- g2: 0% of control\n- g3: 50% of control\n\nDouble mutants:\n- g1g2: 0% of control\n- g1g3: 10% of control\n- g2g3: 0% of control\nCoT-SC agent c5eC, analyzing single mutant severity, thinking: To rank severity, I compare each mutant's resistance to wild-type: lower % means greater loss of resistance.; answer: Ranking of single mutants by severity of resistance loss:\n1) g2 (0% resistance, most severe loss)\n2) g3 (50% resistance)\n3) g1 (75% resistance, least severe loss)\nCoT-SC agent ScY8, analyzing single mutant severity, thinking: We have the resistance percentages for single mutants: g1 = 75%, g2 = 0%, g3 = 50%. The drop from wild-type (100%) is 25% for g1, 100% for g2, and 50% for g3. Therefore, g2 has the most severe loss of resistance, g3 is intermediate, and g1 is the least severe.; answer: Ranking of single mutants by severity of resistance loss: g2 > g3 > g1 (most severe to least severe).\nCoT-SC agent Chfg, analyzing single mutant severity, thinking: We directly compare each single mutant resistance to wild-type (100%). g2 has 0% resistance indicating complete loss (most severe), g3 has 50% (moderate loss), and g1 has 75% (least loss). Thus the ranking by severity of resistance loss is g2 > g3 > g1.; answer: g2: 0% of control, complete loss (most severe)\ng3: 50% of control, moderate loss\n g1: 75% of control, mild loss\nRanking by severity of resistance loss: g2 > g3 > g1\nReflexion CoT agent 8mJu, analyzing double mutant interactions, thinking: We compare each double mutant to its singles. For g1g2 and g2g3, the double shows the same 0% resistance as the g2 single, indicating that G2 masks the effect of G1 and G3 (epistasis/masking). For g1g3, the double has 10% resistance, much lower than either single (75% and 50%), indicating a synergistic (worse-than-additive) interaction.; answer: g1g2: masking (epistatic, G2 masks G1)\ng2g3: masking (epistatic, G2 masks G3)\ng1g3: synergistic interaction\nCritic agent 85KS, feedback: The analysis is accurate and complete. The classifications for all three double mutants are correct: g1g2 and g2g3 both show masking (epistasis) with G2 masking G1 and G3 respectively, and g1g3 exhibits a synergistic interaction.; correct: g1g2: masking epistasis (G2 masks G1); g2g3: masking epistasis (G2 masks G3); g1g3: synergistic interaction\nReflexion CoT agent 8mJu, refining interaction analysis, thinking: We compare each double mutant’s resistance to its single mutants. g1g2 (0%) equals g2 (0%), so G2 masks G1: masking (epistasis). g2g3 (0%) equals g2 (0%), so G2 masks G3: masking (epistasis). g1g3 (10%) is lower than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%), and lower than their additive expectation (~25%), indicating a worse-than-additive (synergistic) interaction.; answer: g1g2: masking (epistatic, G2 masks G1)\ng2g3: masking (epistatic, G2 masks G3)\ng1g3: synergistic interaction\nCoT agent ydVS, inferring transcription factor identity, thinking: Based on the single mutant ranking (g2 most severe, then g3, then g1) and the double mutants showing that g2 masks both g1 and g3 (0% resistance in g1g2 and g2g3), G2 must act upstream as the critical transcription factor whose loss abolishes resistance.; answer: G2\nDebate agent koo2, round 0, determining G1-G3 interaction, thinking: Single mutants show g1 (75%) and g3 (50%) partial resistance loss. The double g1g3 mutant shows a more severe resistance loss (10%) than either single and worse than additive expectation, indicating a synergistic (synthetic) interaction. This pattern is typical of genetic redundancy between G1 and G3, with no masking (no one gene is epistatic) but a combined effect stronger than individual knockouts.; answer: G1 and G3 function redundantly (synthetic interaction) and neither gene is epistatic over the other.\nDebate agent C2iJ, round 0, determining G1-G3 interaction, thinking: Comparing single vs double mutants: g1g3 shows 10% resistance, which is lower than the additive expectation (75%\u2009+\u200950%\u2009–\u2009100%\u2009=\u200925%), indicating a synergistic (worse‐than‐additive) interaction rather than redundancy or masking epistasis. Neither gene masks the other in g1g3, so no epistasis is observed between G1 and G3—they act in parallel pathways.; answer: G1 and G3 exhibit a synergistic interaction (worse‐than‐additive), indicating they function in parallel rather than redundantly, and neither gene is epistatic over the other.\nDebate agent a5ay, round 0, determining G1-G3 interaction, thinking: We ranked single mutants (g2>g3>g1) and saw g1g3 shows a stronger-than-additive loss of resistance (10% vs expected ~37.5%), indicating a synergistic (synthetic) interaction. Such a synthetic phenotype implies that G1 and G3 act in parallel, redundant pathways rather than one masking the other. Therefore, they exhibit redundancy and no epistatic masking is observed between them.; answer: G1 and G3 exhibit functional redundancy; neither gene is epistatic to the other.\nDebate agent X9bZ, round 0, determining G1-G3 interaction, thinking: Single mutants: g1 (75%), g3 (50%). Double g1g3 shows 10%, which is lower than either single and lower than additive expectation (25%), indicating a synergistic interaction rather than masking. This pattern is typical of functional redundancy (both genes back each other up), with no single gene masking the other (no classical epistasis).; answer: G1 and G3 exhibit a synergistic interaction indicative of functional redundancy; neither gene is epistatic over the other.\nFinal Decision agent a1IU, deciding G1-G3 interaction, thinking: The g1g3 double mutant shows a more severe loss of resistance (10%) than the additive expectation (75% + 50% – 100% = 25%), indicating a synergistic (worse‐than‐additive) interaction. This pattern reflects functional redundancy between G1 and G3 acting in parallel pathways, with no one gene masking the other (no classical epistasis).; answer: G1 and G3 function redundantly and neither gene is epistatic over the other.\nCoT agent FDOx, mapping to answer choices, thinking: Sub-task 4 identifies G2 as the upstream transcription factor. Sub-task 5 finds G1 and G3 function redundantly (no epistasis). Among the options, only choice1 names G2 as the TF and recognizes redundancy between G1 and G3, even though it misstates epistasis.
