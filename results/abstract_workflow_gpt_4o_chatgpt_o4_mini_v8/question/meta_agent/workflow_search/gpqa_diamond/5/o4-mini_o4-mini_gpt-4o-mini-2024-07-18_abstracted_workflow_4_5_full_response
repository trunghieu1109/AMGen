This gives V = 1/2 k (x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 k x^2 = (1/2 k x^2 + 1/2 k y^2) + (3/2 k x^2) = 2 k x^2 + (1/2) k y^2.; answer: V(x,y) = 2 k x^2 + (1/2) k y^2\nCoT-SC agent Fr2v, substitution reasoning, thinking: We have x = r cos(θ), y = r sin(θ), so r^2 = x^2 + y^2 and cos^2(θ) = x^2/r^2. Substitute into V: V = (1/2)k r^2 + (3/2)k r^2 cos^2(θ) = (1/2)k(x^2 + y^2) + (3/2)k x^2 = 2k x^2 + (1/2)k y^2.; answer: V(x,y) = 2k x^2 + (1/2)k y^2\nCoT-SC agent CNF7, substitution reasoning, thinking: We substitute x = r cosθ and y = r sinθ into V = 1/2 k r^2 + 3/2 k r^2 cos^2θ. Using cos^2θ = x^2/r^2 gives V = 1/2 k (x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 k x^2 = 2k x^2 + 1/2 k y^2.; answer: V(x,y) = 2k x^2 + (1/2)k y^2\nCoT agent OqPs, simplify V(x,y), thinking: We have V(x,y)=2kx^2+(1/2)ky^2. Write 2kx^2=(1/2)(4k)x^2 and (1/2)ky^2=(1/2)(k)y^2, so k_x=4k and k_y=k.; answer: V(x,y)=\\frac12 k_x x^2+\\frac12 k_y y^2 with k_x=4k, k_y=k\nCoT agent zqEy, identify k_x and k_y, thinking: From the simplified form V(x,y)=½ k_x x^2 + ½ k_y y^2 with V(x,y)=2kx^2+½ky^2, rewrite 2kx^2 as ½·(4k)x^2 and ½ ky^2 as ½·(k)y^2. Thus k_x=4k and k_y=k.; answer: k_x = 4k, k_y = k\nCoT agent mGv8, compute angular frequencies, thinking: We have the effective spring constants k_x = 4k and k_y = k.
