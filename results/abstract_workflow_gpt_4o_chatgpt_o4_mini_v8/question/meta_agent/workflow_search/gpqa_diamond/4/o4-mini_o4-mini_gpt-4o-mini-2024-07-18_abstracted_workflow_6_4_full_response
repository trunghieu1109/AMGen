The first equation gives (cosθ−1)v₁+sinθ v₂=0 ⇒ v₂/v₁=(1−cosθ)/sinθ=tan(θ/2). Thus v∝[1;tan(θ/2)]. Normalizing gives v=[cos(θ/2);sin(θ/2)].\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent iMkA:\n(cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2))\n\n### Sub-task 7: Normalize the spinor solution to unit length and express as (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)) up to a phase. \n\n ### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent oZtn (yourself):\nWe already have the unnormalized spinor ~[1, tan(θ/2)]. Its norm is √[1 + tan^2(θ/2)] = 1/cos(θ/2), so dividing yields [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)] up to an overall phase.\n\n### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent oZtn (yourself):\nNormalized spinor: (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)) up to an arbitrary global phase.\n\n### Critically evaluate the normalization and phase choice for correctness. \n\n ### feedback #1 by Critic Agent E6Fv:\nThe spinor (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)) has |cos(θ/2)|^2 + |sin(θ/2)|^2 = 1, so it is properly normalized, and including “up to a global phase” is correct since overall phases are physically irrelevant.\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 7: Normalize the spinor solution to unit length and express as (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)) up to a phase.\n\nIf the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the "answer" entry and justify why you think so in the "thinking" entry'}], sub_tasks=None, agents='CoT agent wCan, identifying Pauli matrices, thinking: The question simply asks for the known Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2.; answer: Px = (ħ/2) [[0, 1], [1, 0]]; Py = (ħ/2) [[0, -i], [i, 0]]; Pz = (ħ/2) [[1, 0], [0, -1]]\nCoT agent wHTj, expressing unit vector n, thinking: The sub-task asks to express the unit vector n in the x–z plane, which by definition has zero y-component and unit length. The standard parametrization uses polar angle θ measured from z-axis or x-axis; given the context, n=(sinθ,0,cosθ) matches the x–z plane representation.; answer: n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ)\nSelf-Consistency CoT agent pXTb, constructing Pn, thinking: We substitute Px and Pz into Pn=Px\u2009sinθ+Pz\u2009cosθ. Factor ħ/2: Pn=(ħ/2)[[0,1],[1,0]]sinθ+(ħ/2)[[1,0],[0,−1]]cosθ = (ħ/2)[[cosθ,\u2009sinθ],[sinθ,\u2009−cosθ]].; answer: Pn = (ħ/2) [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, −cosθ]]\nSelf-Consistency CoT agent 5cfs, constructing Pn, thinking: We substitute Px=(ħ/2)[[0,1],[1,0]] and Pz=(ħ/2)[[1,0],[0,-1]] and weight by sinθ and cosθ: Pn=Px\u2009sinθ+Pz\u2009cosθ = (ħ/2)[[0·sinθ+1·cosθ, 1·sinθ+0·cosθ],[1·sinθ+0·cosθ,0·sinθ+(-1)·cosθ]] = (ħ/2)[[cosθ, sinθ],[sinθ, -cosθ]].; answer: Pn = Px\u2009sinθ + Pz\u2009cosθ = (ħ/2)[[cosθ, sinθ],[sinθ, -cosθ]]\nSelf-Consistency CoT agent jowT, constructing Pn, thinking: We use Px=(ħ/2)[[0,1],[1,0]] and Pz=(ħ/2)[[1,0],[0,-1]] with n=(sinθ,0,cosθ). Then Pn=Px·sinθ+Pz·cosθ combines to a single 2×2 matrix.; answer: Pn = Px\u2009sinθ + Pz\u2009cosθ = (ħ/2) [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]\nSelf-Consistency CoT agent 65eB, forming matrix M, thinking: We substitute σx=[[0,1],[1,0]] and σz=[[1,0],[0,−1]] into M=σx\u2009sinθ+σz\u2009cosθ. This yields M=[[cosθ, sinθ],[sinθ, −cosθ]].; answer: M = σx sinθ + σz cosθ = [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, −cosθ]]\nSelf-Consistency CoT agent UBFY, forming matrix M, thinking: We have Pn = (ħ/2)[[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, −cosθ]]. Factoring out ħ/2 gives the dimensionless matrix M = [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, −cosθ]], which is exactly σx\u2009sinθ + σz\u2009cosθ.; answer: M = σx sinθ + σz cosθ\nSelf-Consistency CoT agent R7k5, forming matrix M, thinking: We substitute the Pauli matrices σx=[[0,1],[1,0]] and σz=[[1,0],[0,−1]] into M=σx\u2009sinθ+σz\u2009cosθ and sum the matrices.; answer: M = σx\u2009sinθ + σz\u2009cosθ = [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, −cosθ]]\nReflexion CoT agent bTb2, formulating eigenvalue equation, thinking: We have M = [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]] from Sub-task 4. The eigenvalue equation for eigenvalue +1 (i.e. Pn v = (ħ/2)v gives Mv = v) is straightforward to write by applying M to the vector v = (v1, v2).; answer: The eigenvalue equation is M v = v, i.e.\n\n[cosθ   sinθ]\n[sinθ  -cosθ] [v1; v2] = [v1; v2]\n\nwhich leads to the system:\n(cosθ - 1) v1 + sinθ v2 = 0\nsinθ v1 + (-cosθ - 1) v2 = 0\nCritic agent lzdt, providing feedback, thinking: The eigenvalue equation Mv=v is written correctly for the +1 eigenvalue.  Substituting M=[cosθ  sinθ; sinθ -cosθ] does indeed lead to (cosθ−1)v₁+sinθ·v₂=0 and sinθ·v₁+(−cosθ−1)v₂=0.  These two equations are equivalent (up to an overall factor) and fully encode the eigenvector condition.  You can proceed to solve one of them (e.g. (cosθ−1)v₁+sinθ·v₂=0) and then normalize the resulting vector.; answer: Yes\nReflexion CoT agent bTb2, refining eigenvalue equation, thinking: We set up the eigenvalue equation Mv=v for eigenvalue +1 by applying M from Sub-task 4 to v=(v₁,v₂)ᵀ and equating to (v₁,v₂)ᵀ, yielding two linear equations.; answer: The eigenvalue equation is:\nM v = v  ⇒  [cosθ  sinθ; sinθ  -cosθ] [v₁; v₂] = [v₁; v₂],\nwhich gives the system:\n(cosθ − 1) v₁ + sinθ · v₂ = 0\nsinθ · v₁ + (−cosθ − 1) v₂ = 0\nSelf-Consistency CoT agent sNsA, solving linear system, thinking: We have M = [[cosθ, sinθ]; [sinθ, -cosθ]] and need to solve (M - I)v = 0. Writing components gives (cosθ -1)v1 + sinθ v2 = 0 ⇒ v2/v1 = (1 - cosθ)/sinθ = tan(θ/2). Normalizing yields v ∝ (1, tan(θ/2)) with length √(1+tan^2(θ/2)) = 1/cos(θ/2), so v = (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)).; answer: (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2))\nSelf-Consistency CoT agent QqTv, solving linear system, thinking: We solve (M−I)v=0: (cosθ−1)v₁+sinθ v₂=0 ⇒ v₂/v₁=(1−cosθ)/sinθ=tan(θ/2). Normalize: v∝[1;tan(θ/2)]⇒v=[cos(θ/2);sin(θ/2)].; answer: The normalized two-component spinor is (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)).\nSelf-Consistency CoT agent iMkA, solving linear system, thinking: We have (M-I)v=0 with M=[[cosθ, sinθ],[sinθ,-cosθ]]. The first equation gives (cosθ−1)v₁+sinθ v₂=0 ⇒ v₂/v₁=(1−cosθ)/sinθ=tan(θ/2). Thus v∝[1;tan(θ/2)]. Normalizing gives v=[cos(θ/2);sin(θ/2)].; answer: (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2))\nReflexion CoT agent oZtn, normalizing spinor, thinking: We already have the unnormalized spinor ~[1, tan(θ/2)]. Its norm is √[1 + tan^2(θ/2)] = 1/cos(θ/2), so dividing yields [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)] up to an overall phase.; answer: Normalized spinor: (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)) up to an arbitrary global phase.\nCritic agent E6Fv, providing feedback, thinking: The spinor (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)) has |cos(θ/2)|^2 + |sin(θ/2)|^2 = 1, so it is properly normalized, and including “up to a global phase” is correct since overall phases are physically irrelevant.; answer: The normalization and phase choice are correct.\nReflexion CoT agent oZtn, refining normalization, thinking: Starting from the unnormalized spinor [1, tan(θ/2)], its norm is √(1+tan^2(θ/2))=1/cos(θ/2). Dividing by this gives [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)], and an overall phase remains arbitrary.; answer: (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)) up to an arbitrary global phase.', iteration_idx=1)]
