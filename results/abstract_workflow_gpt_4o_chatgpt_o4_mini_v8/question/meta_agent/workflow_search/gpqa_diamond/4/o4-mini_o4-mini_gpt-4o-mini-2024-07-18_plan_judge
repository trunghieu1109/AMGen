proposed answer: Starting from the unnormalized spinor [1, tan(θ/2)], its norm is √(1+tan^2(θ/2))=1/cos(θ/2). Dividing by this gives [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)], and an overall phase remains arbitrary.

Answer:(cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)) up to an arbitrary global phase.
Extracted answer: (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)) up to an arbitrary global phase.
Correct answer: 2
