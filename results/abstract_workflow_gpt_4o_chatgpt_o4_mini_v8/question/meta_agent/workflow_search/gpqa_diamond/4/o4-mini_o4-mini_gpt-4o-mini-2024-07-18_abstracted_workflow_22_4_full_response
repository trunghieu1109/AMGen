Then Pn = nx Px + nz Pz = (ħ/2)(nx[[0,1],[1,0]] + nz[[1,0],[0,-1]]) = (ħ/2)[[nz, nx],[nx, -nz]].; answer: Pn = (ħ/2) [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]\nCoT-SC agent qSLA, constructing Pn matrix, thinking: We have Px = (ħ/2)[[0,1],[1,0]] and Pz = (ħ/2)[[1,0],[0,-1]]. With n = (sinθ,0,cosθ), Pn = n_x Px + n_z Pz = (ħ/2)[[cosθ, sinθ],[sinθ, -cosθ]].; answer: Pn = (ħ/2) [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]\nCoT-SC agent j5VQ, constructing Pn matrix, thinking: From Sub-task 1: Px = (ħ/2)[[0,1],[1,0]] and Pz = (ħ/2)[[1,0],[0,-1]]. From Sub-task 2: n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ). Therefore Pn = n_x Px + n_z Pz = sinθ·(ħ/2)[[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ·(ħ/2)[[1,0],[0,-1]] = (ħ/2)[[cosθ, sinθ],[sinθ, -cosθ]].; answer: Pn = (ħ/2)[[cosθ, sinθ],[sinθ, -cosθ]]\nReflexion CoT agent G9kx, formulating eigenvalue equations, thinking: To derive the component equations, start from Pnψ=(ħ/2)ψ with Pn=(ħ/2)[[cosθ,sinθ],[sinθ,−cosθ]]. Writing ψ=(ψ1,ψ2), we get two scalar equations. Cancelling the common factor ħ/2 yields the final linear relations.; answer: In component form the eigenvalue equation Pn ψ=(ħ/2)ψ gives:\n(ħ/2)[cosθ·ψ1 + sinθ·ψ2] = (ħ/2)·ψ1  ⇒  cosθ·ψ1 + sinθ·ψ2 = ψ1\n(ħ/2)[sinθ·ψ1 − cosθ·ψ2] = (ħ/2)·ψ2  ⇒  sinθ·ψ1 − cosθ·ψ2 = ψ2\nCritic agent r2D4, providing feedback, thinking: The component equations are correctly derived; there are no errors in the formulation.; answer: cosθ·ψ1 + sinθ·ψ2 = ψ1  and  sinθ·ψ1 − cosθ·ψ2 = ψ2\nReflexion CoT agent G9kx, refining eigenvalue equations, thinking: We start from Pn=(ħ/2)[[cosθ,sinθ],[sinθ,−cosθ]] acting on ψ=(ψ1,ψ2) and set equal to (ħ/2)ψ.
