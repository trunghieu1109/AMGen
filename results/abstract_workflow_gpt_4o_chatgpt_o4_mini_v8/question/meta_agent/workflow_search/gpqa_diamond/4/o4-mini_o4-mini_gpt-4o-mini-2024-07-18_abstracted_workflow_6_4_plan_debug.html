{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Calculate the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator $\\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\\hbar/2$. Given the $X-$component, $P_x$ of the operator $P$ as $\\hbar/2$ times a 2 by 2 square matrix having elements in the first row as $(0 1)$, and that in the second row as $(1, 0)$. The $Y-$component, $P_y$ of the operator is given by the product of $\\hbar/2$ and a 2 by 2 square matrix having elements in the first row as $(0, -i)$, and that in the second row as $(i, 0)$. Finally, the $Z-$component, $P_z$ of the operator is given by the product of $\\hbar/2$  and another 2 by 2 square matrix having elements in the first row as $(1, 0)$, and that in the second row as $(0, -1)$.

### Sub-task 6: Solve (M - I) v = 0 for the two-component spinor v in terms of θ. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent iMkA:
We have (M-I)v=0 with M=[[cosθ, sinθ],[sinθ,-cosθ]]. The first equation gives (cosθ−1)v₁+sinθ v₂=0 ⇒ v₂/v₁=(1−cosθ)/sinθ=tan(θ/2). Thus v∝[1;tan(θ/2)]. Normalizing gives v=[cos(θ/2);sin(θ/2)].

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent iMkA:
(cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2))

### Sub-task 7: Normalize the spinor solution to unit length and express as (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)) up to a phase. 

 ### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent oZtn (yourself):
We already have the unnormalized spinor ~[1, tan(θ/2)]. Its norm is √[1 + tan^2(θ/2)] = 1/cos(θ/2), so dividing yields [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)] up to an overall phase.

### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent oZtn (yourself):
Normalized spinor: (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)) up to an arbitrary global phase.

### Critically evaluate the normalization and phase choice for correctness. 

 ### feedback #1 by Critic Agent E6Fv:
The spinor (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)) has |cos(θ/2)|^2 + |sin(θ/2)|^2 = 1, so it is properly normalized, and including “up to a global phase” is correct since overall phases are physically irrelevant.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 7: Normalize the spinor solution to unit length and express as (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)) up to a phase.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>Starting from the unnormalized spinor [1, tan(θ/2)], its norm is √(1+tan^2(θ/2))=1/cos(θ/2). Dividing by this gives [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)], and an overall phase remains arbitrary.

Answer:(cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)) up to an arbitrary global phase.</pre>
