Question: Example(question='The universe is filled with the Cosmic Microwave Background. Consider the annihilation of high energy \\gamma-rays with a photon from the CMB Radiation into electron-positron, i.e. $\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$. From what energy \\gamma-rays would have their lifetimes in the universe limited by this process? Knowing that the average photon energy of the CMB is $10^{-3}eV$.', choice1='9.5*1e4 GeV', choice2='1.8*1e5 GeV', choice3='2.6*1e5 GeV', choice4='3.9*1e5 GeV', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_1_6
proposed answer: We compare the computed threshold energy 2.61×10^5 GeV with the provided options; it matches choice 3: 2.6×10^5 GeV.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_21_6
proposed answer: We calculate the threshold energy for gamma–gamma → e⁺e⁻ using E_thr ≈ (m_e c²)²/(ε(1–cosθ)). For head-on (1–cosθ=2), E_thr ≈2.61×10^14 eV = 2.61×10^5 GeV, which matches option 3.
