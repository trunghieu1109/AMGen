### Sub-task 7: Based on the evaluation in Sub-task 6, select and report the molecule or molecules that satisfy C3h point-group symmetry. 

 ### thinking by Debate Agent 9v6F:
Triisopropyl borate and quinuclidine each have a C3 axis but only σv planes (point group C3v), so they lack a horizontal mirror plane. Both benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c&#39;:5,6-c&#39;&#39;]trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone and triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c&#39;:9,10-c&#39;&#39;]trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone were idealized with a C3 axis and a σh plane (point group D3h, which contains C3h). However, without explicit 3D coordinates or structural data, planarity and the exact orientation of σh cannot be fully confirmed.

### thinking by Debate Agent 79YQ:
Based on Sub-task 6, only the two hexaone molecules were idealized with both a C₃ axis and a horizontal mirror plane (σₕ), which are required for C₃h symmetry. However, without explicit 3D coordinates we cannot confirm planarity and the exact orientation of σₕ, so further structural data are needed.

### thinking by Debate Agent jaKR:
Sub-task 6 identified that only benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c&#39;:5,6-c&#39;&#39;]trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone and triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c&#39;:9,10-c&#39;&#39;]trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone possess both a principal C₃ axis and an assumed σₕ plane. However, without explicit 3D data the planarity (and thus the true σₕ) cannot be fully confirmed.

### thinking by Debate Agent 6GRO:
Based on symmetry catalogs, both benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c&#39;:5,6-c&#39;&#39;]trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone and triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c&#39;:9,10-c&#39;&#39;]trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone were idealized as D3h, which implies they possess a C3 principal axis and a horizontal mirror plane, satisfying C3h symmetry. However, without explicit 3D coordinates or crystal data, planarity and the true existence of σh cannot be fully confirmed.

### answer by Debate Agent 9v6F:
benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c&#39;:5,6-c&#39;&#39;]trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone; triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c&#39;:9,10-c&#39;&#39;]trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 7: Make final decision on which molecule(s) have C3h symmetry.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>Based on point‐group symmetry elements, only the two polyfuran‐hexaone frameworks can support both a C₃ axis and a horizontal mirror plane (σh), implying C₃h symmetry. The small molecules each lack σh and are C₃v. However, without 3D structural data, planarity and true σh cannot be fully confirmed.

Answer:benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c&#39;:5,6-c&#39;&#39;]trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone; triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c&#39;:9,10-c&#39;&#39;]trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone
