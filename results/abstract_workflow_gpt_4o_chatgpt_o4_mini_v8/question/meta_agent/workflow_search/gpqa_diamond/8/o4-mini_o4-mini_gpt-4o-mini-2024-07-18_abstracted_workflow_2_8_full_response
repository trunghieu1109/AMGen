Because each –OCH(CH₃)₂ substituent is identical and can be aligned so that its C–O–B bond and one C–H lie in a plane, the molecule exhibits C₃v symmetry. We lack a specific CIF or coordinate set, so minor distortions or conformational twists could reduce symmetry—but under typical computational/experimental structures, C₃v applies.; answer: Symmetry elements in triisopropyl borate:\n- Identity (E)\n- One C₃ principal axis (rotation by 120° and 240°, giving C₃ and C₃²)\n- Three vertical mirror planes (σᵥ), each containing the C₃ axis and one O–C–H moiety\n\n[TOO_HARD]\nPlease provide the optimized 3D coordinates or CIF file for triisopropyl borate so we can verify the exact substituent orientations and confirm the presence and orientation of the σᵥ planes.\nCoT agent mPTt, identifying symmetry in quinuclidine, thinking: Quinuclidine is 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, a bridged tertiary amine derived from bicyclo[2.2.2]octane. Replacing one bridgehead carbon with nitrogen lowers the symmetry from D₃h to C₃v: the three ethylene bridges remain equivalent about the N–C axis, yielding a principal C₃ axis and three vertical mirror planes (σᵥ), but no horizontal mirror plane or C₂ axes perpendicular to the principal axis. However, without explicit atomic coordinates or a CIF, the exact orientation of the lone pair and mirror planes can only be inferred approximately.; answer: Symmetry elements in quinuclidine:\n• Identity (E)\n• One C₃ principal axis (120° rotation about the axis through N and the opposite bridgehead C) and its inverse (C₃²)\n• Three vertical mirror planes (σᵥ) each containing the C₃ axis and bisecting one of the three ethylene bridges\n[TOO_HARD]\nPlease provide the optimized 3D coordinates or a CIF file so the precise orientation of the σᵥ planes relative to the nitrogen lone pair can be confirmed.\nCoT agent t3I8, identifying symmetry in benzo-trifuran hexaone, thinking: We do not have an actual optimized or experimental 3D structure for benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone.  Based on its idealized planar, threefold‐symmetric connectivity, it would belong to point group D3h.  However, keto substituents or slight distortions could lower the symmetry.  To be certain of the exact symmetry elements, we need the Cartesian coordinates or an X-ray/CIF file to verify planarity and equality of bond lengths and angles.; answer: Symmetry elements present in benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone (idealized D3h):\n- E (identity)\n- C3 principal axis (120° rotation about axis ⟂ molecular plane)\n- C3^2 (240° rotation)\n- three C2 axes lying in the molecular plane (each bisecting two furan linkages)\n- σh (horizontal mirror plane, the molecular plane itself)\n- three σv planes (each contains the C3 axis and one C2 axis)\n- two S3 improper axes (S3 = reflection in σh followed by C3 rotation)\nPoint group: D3h\n[TOO_HARD]\nPlease provide an optimized 3D coordinate file (e.g., CIF or XYZ) or experimental diffraction data so we can confirm that the molecule is perfectly planar and that all bond lengths/angles truly support D3h symmetry.\nCoT agent QNME, identifying symmetry in triphenyleno-trifuran hexaone, thinking: Without access to the explicit 3D coordinates or CIF file, I must infer symmetry from the molecular name, which suggests a triphenylene core (D3h) with three identical furanone units symmetrically fused. To be certain of all elements, coordinate data are needed.; answer: Symmetry elements (assuming idealized D3h symmetry):\nE (identity)\n2 C3 axes (rotation by ±120° about axis through center, perpendicular to molecular plane)\n3 C2 axes (in‐plane, each bisecting a bond angle of the triphenylene core)\nσ_h (horizontal mirror plane = molecular plane)\n3 σ_v planes (vertical planes containing the C3 axis and each C2 axis)\n2 S3 improper axes (rotation by 120° followed by reflection in σ_h, and its inverse)\n[TOO_HARD]\nPlease provide the optimized 3D coordinates (e.g., CIF or XYZ file) for this molecule so I can confirm and fully catalog its symmetry elements.\nReflexion CoT agent zsdh, evaluating C3h criteria, thinking: Triisopropyl borate and quinuclidine were found to have only a C3 axis and σv planes (point group C3v), so they lack a σh plane.
