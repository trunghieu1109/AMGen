Question: Example(question='Among the following exoplanets, which one has the highest density?\n\na) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet.\nb) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm^3.\nc) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth.\nd) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth.', choice1='a', choice2='c', choice3='b', choice4='d', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_9
proposed answer: We compare densities: a and b are about Earth’s density ~5.5 g/cm³; d (0.5 M⊕, same composition) ~5.14 g/cm³ due to less compression; c (5 M⊕, same composition) has higher internal pressure and a calculated density ≈6.5 g/cm³. Thus c is highest.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_6_9
proposed answer: For Earth-like composition planets, radius scales as M^(1/3), so density remains constant at ~5.5 g/cm³ regardless of mass. Planet b is given as ~5.5 g/cm³. Thus all four planets share the same density.

Answer:All four planets have the same density (~5.5 g/cm³), so none has the highest density.
Extracted answer: All four planets have the same density (~5.5 g/cm³), so none has the highest density.
