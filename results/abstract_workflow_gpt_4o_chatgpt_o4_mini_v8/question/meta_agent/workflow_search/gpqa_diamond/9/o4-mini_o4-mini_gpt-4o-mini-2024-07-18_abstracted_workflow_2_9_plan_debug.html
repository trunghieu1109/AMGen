### Sub-task 7: Compare densities of choices a, b, c, d and determine which is highest. 

 ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent a3YD:
Calculated densities are: a ≈5.5 g/cm³, b ≈5.5 g/cm³, c ≈6.5 g/cm³, d ≈5.14 g/cm³. Choice c has the highest density.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent gCKp:
Summarized densities: a ≈ 5.5 g/cm³, b ≈ 5.5 g/cm³, c ≈ 6.5 g/cm³, d ≈ 5.14 g/cm³. Choice c has the highest density.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent EW5I:
We compare the densities: choice a and b are about 5.5 g/cm³, choice c ≈6.5 g/cm³, choice d ≈5.14 g/cm³. Thus choice c has the highest density.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent Ze15:
Calculated densities: a ≈5.5 g/cm³, b ≈5.5 g/cm³, c ≈6.5 g/cm³, d ≈5.14 g/cm³. Choice c has the highest density.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 7: Decide which exoplanet has the highest density.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>We compare densities: a and b are about Earth’s density ~5.5 g/cm³; d (0.5 M⊕, same composition) ~5.14 g/cm³ due to less compression; c (5 M⊕, same composition) has higher internal pressure and a calculated density ≈6.5 g/cm³. Thus c is highest.
