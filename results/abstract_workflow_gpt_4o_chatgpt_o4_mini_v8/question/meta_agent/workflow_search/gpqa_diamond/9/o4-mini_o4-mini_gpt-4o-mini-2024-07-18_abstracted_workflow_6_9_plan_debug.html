### Sub-task 4: Compare the densities of all four planets and determine which has the highest density. 

 ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent S4CA:
For planets a, c, and d with Earth-like composition, R scales as M^(1/3), so density = (M/R^3)×5.5 = 5.5 g/cm³ in each case. Planet b is given as ≈5.5 g/cm³. Thus all four densities are equal.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent 3HVl:
For planets a, c, and d we used the scaling R ∝ M^(1/3) and found their densities remain at 5.5 g/cm³. Planet b is given as 5.5 g/cm³. Therefore all four have the same density.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent eBuF:
For an Earth-like composition R ∝ M^(1/3) so ρ = M/R^3 × 5.5 g/cm³ = 5.5 g/cm³ regardless of mass. Planet b is given as ~5.5 g/cm³. Thus all four have the same density.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent v1Tx:
For planets a, c, and d we use R = M^(1/3)R⊕ so R^3 = M, giving density = (M/R^3)×5.5 = 5.5 g/cm³. Planet b is given as ≈5.5 g/cm³. Thus all four planets have the same density.

### answer #1 by Debate Agent S4CA:
All four planets have the same density (≈5.5 g/cm³).

### answer #1 by Debate Agent 3HVl:
All four planets have the same density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³, so none has the highest density over the others.

### answer #1 by Debate Agent eBuF:
All four planets have the same highest density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³.

### answer #1 by Debate Agent v1Tx:
All four planets have the same density (~5.5 g/cm³), so none has a higher density than the others.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Make final decision on the highest density planet.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
