            "Dienes are organic compounds with two adjacent double bonds in their structure, and they exhibit unique reactivity due to their conjugated pi-electron system. They play a significant role in organic chemistry and are involved in various chemical reactions and natural processes.\nAmong the given options which one is the possible reactant (A) for the given reaction also mention the correct sequence of the dienes according to their reactivity ( most reactive to least reactive) B.\nCyclohexene + A ---> 8,8-diiodobicyclo[4.2.0]octan-7-one\n(B) 1. 2,3-dimethylbuta-1,3-diene, 2.
