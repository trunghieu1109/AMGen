Since R1*=R2*, M1*=2M2*, P1=P2/3, the ratio P1/P2 = (M2^(1/3)P2^(2/3)) / ((2M2)^(1/3)(P2/3)^(2/3)) = 3^(2/3)/2^(1/3) ≃ 1.65, favoring Planet_1.; answer: A)\nCoT agent aich, calculating semi-major axes, thinking: We know a∝M*^(1/3)P^(2/3).

No additional data are needed for the ratio.; answer: P_transit1 = R_star1/a1, P_transit2 = R_star2/a2, and since a1/a2 ≃0.61 and R_star1=R_star2, P_transit1/P_transit2 ≃1.65.\nCritic agent KfIY, feedback: The computed ratio P_transit1/P_transit2 ≃ 1.65 is accurate given R_star1 = R_star2 and a1/a2 ≃ 0.61 from Kepler’s third law.; correct: Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.\nReflexion CoT agent UN6v, refining transit probabilities, thinking: We know both stars have equal radii and from Sub-task 3 a1/a2≈0.61.

Thus P_transit1/P_transit2=(R*/a1)/(R*/a2)=a2/a1≈1/0.61≈1.65, meaning Planet 1’s transit probability is ~1.65× that of Planet 2.; answer: P_transit1/P_transit2 ≃ 1.65, so Planet_1 has the higher probability to transit.\nDebate agent WHIk, round 0, ratio calculation, thinking: Since both stars have equal radii and a1/a2 ≃ 0.61 from prior sub-tasks, the transit probability ratio P_transit1/P_transit2 = (R*/a1)/(R*/a2) = a2/a1 ≃ 1/0.61 ≃ 1.65, indicating Planet 1 is more likely to transit.; answer: P_transit1/P_transit2 ≃ 1.65; Planet_1 has the higher transit probability.\nDebate agent moGY, round 0, ratio calculation, thinking: Both stars have equal radii and from Sub-task 4 we found a1/a2 ≃ 0.61, so P_transit1/P_transit2 = a2/a1 ≃ 1/0.61 ≃ 1.65.; answer: P_transit1/P_transit2 ≃ 1.65, therefore Planet_1 has the higher probability to transit.\nDebate agent w2TS, round 0, ratio calculation, thinking: Using the result from Sub-task 4 that a1/a2 ≃ 0.61 and both stars have the same radii, the geometric transit probability ratio is P_transit1/P_transit2 = a2/a1 ≃ 1/0.61 ≃ 1.65.; answer: P_transit1/P_transit2 ≃ 1.65, so Planet_1 has the higher probability to transit.\nFinal Decision agent, deciding ratio outcome, thinking: Both stars have equal radii and from prior work we found a1/a2 ≃ 0.61. Since transit probability scales as R*/a, the ratio P_transit1/P_transit2 = a2/a1 ≃ 1/0.61 ≃ 1.65, indicating Planet_1 is more likely to transit.; answer: Planet_1 has the higher transit probability, by a factor of about 1.65.', iteration_idx=-1)]
