Question: Example(question='Researchers are attempting to detect transits of two Earth-like planets: Planet_1 and Planet_2. They have limited observing time and want to observe the one that has the highest probability of transiting. Both of these planets have already been detected via the RV method, allowing us to know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Although both planets share the same masses, the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2. Interestingly, they both have circular orbits. Furthermore, we know the masses and radii of the host stars of these two planets. The star hosting Planet_1 has a mass that is twice that of the host star of Planet_2. As the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved, both host stars have the same radii. Based on the provided information, the researchers have chosen to observe:', choice1='Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.\n', choice2='Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~2.25 times higher probability to transit.\n', choice3='Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~1.5 times higher probability to transit.\n', choice4='Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~2.7 times higher probability to transit.\n', correct_index=0)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_6_14
proposed answer: Both stars have equal radii and from prior work we found a1/a2 ≃ 0.61. Since transit probability scales as R*/a, the ratio P_transit1/P_transit2 = a2/a1 ≃ 1/0.61 ≃ 1.65, indicating Planet_1 is more likely to transit.

Answer:Planet_1 has the higher transit probability, by a factor of about 1.65.
Extracted answer: Planet_1 has the higher transit probability, by a factor of about 1.65.
Correct answer: 0

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_47_14
proposed answer: Since the ratio P_t1/P_t2 ≃ 1.65 > 1, Planet_1 has the higher transit probability, which corresponds to choice1.
