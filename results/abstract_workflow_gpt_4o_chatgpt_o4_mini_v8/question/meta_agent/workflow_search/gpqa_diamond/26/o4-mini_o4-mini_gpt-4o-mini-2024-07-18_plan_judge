Question: Example(question='"Oh, I know you," the ribonucleoprotein particle says to the nascent chain as they meet. "Pause there for a minute. Let me show you in; you really need some sugar."\n"It seems somewhat rough. I guess this is goodbye; I need to be on my way", the chain replies. Where did they meet, and where is the chain heading?', choice1='membrane to the nucleus', choice2='ribosome to the proteasome', choice3='Golgi to the mitochondrion', choice4='cytosol to the extracellular space', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_26
proposed answer: The SRP binds the nascent chain’s signal peptide and directs the ribosome–nascent chain complex to the rough ER for co-translational translocation and glycosylation, after which the protein proceeds through the secretory pathway and is ultimately secreted from the cell.
