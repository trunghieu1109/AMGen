(B) Which of the second pair shows optical isomerism?\nSC-CoT agent SQ6z, retrieving definitions, thinking: The user requests clear definitions of tautomerism and optical isomerism and the structural features that enable or prevent each. All necessary information is standard organic chemistry, so no additional data is required.; answer: Tautomerism:\nDefinition: A dynamic equilibrium between two (or more) constitutional isomers (tautomers) that differ by the relocation of a proton and the shift of a double bond (e.g., keto–enol tautomerism).\nStructural features that enable it:\n  • A proton donor (usually an acidic hydrogen on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl) and a π system (C=O or C=C) to accept the proton.\n  • The ability to delocalize electrons in the resulting enol (or other) form, stabilizing both tautomeric forms.\nStructural features that prevent it:\n  • Absence of acidic α–hydrogens next to a carbonyl or similar functional group.\n  • No conjugated π system to stabilize the alternative tautomer.\n\nOptical isomerism:\nDefinition: The existence of non-superimposable mirror-image forms (enantiomers) of a molecule that rotate plane-polarized light in opposite directions.\nStructural features that enable it:\n  • A stereogenic center, most commonly a tetrahedral carbon bearing four different substituents.\n  • Other forms of chirality (axial, planar) arising from restricted rotation or specific geometry.\nStructural features that prevent it:\n  • Lack of any stereogenic center or chiral element; molecule has an internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n  • All substituents on potential stereocenters are identical or arrangements are symmetrical.\nSC-CoT agent rebD, retrieving definitions, thinking: The user requests clear definitions of tautomerism and optical isomerism along with the key structural requirements that allow or block each phenomenon. I will provide concise but complete descriptions.; answer: Definition of tautomerism: A form of isomerism in which two (or more) structural isomers (tautomers) interconvert by the migration of a proton and a shift of a double bond (or lone pair). The classic example is keto–enol tautomerism. Structural features that enable tautomerism: 1) Presence of an acidic hydrogen (often α to a carbonyl or imine group). 2) A conjugated system or heteroatom that can stabilize the resulting enol (or enamine) via resonance. 3) A mechanism for proton transfer (intramolecular hydrogen bonding or solvent-mediated). Features that prevent tautomerism: 1) Lack of α-hydrogen (e.g., fully substituted carbonyl). 2) A rigid aromatic system that would lose aromaticity upon enolization. 3) Absence of a suitable acceptor/donor pair for proton transfer.  \n\nDefinition of optical isomerism: A type of stereoisomerism where molecules exist as non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers) that rotate plane-polarized light in opposite directions. Structural features that enable optical isomerism: 1) Presence of one or more stereogenic centers (e.g., an sp³ carbon bearing four different substituents). 2) Absence of an internal plane or center of symmetry. 3) Restricted rotation (in cases of axial or planar chirality). Features that prevent optical isomerism: 1) Molecules with a plane of symmetry or center of symmetry (meso compounds). 2) Identical substituents on a potential stereocenter. 3) Free rotation that interconverts mirror forms (no fixed chiral axis).\nSC-CoT agent UTaM, retrieving definitions, thinking: The question requests definitions of tautomerism and optical isomerism along with structural features that enable or prevent them. This is straightforward and can be answered without additional data.; answer: Tautomerism:\nDefinition: A form of structural (constitutional) isomerism in which isomers (tautomers) rapidly interconvert by transfer of a proton (H⁺) and a shift of a double bond (e.g., keto–enol tautomerism).\nEnabling features: \n- Presence of an acidic hydrogen on a carbon atom (an α-hydrogen) adjacent to a double-bonded atom (e.g., carbonyl).  \n- Ability of the π system to delocalize electrons (conjugation).  \nPreventing features:\n- Absence of α-hydrogens next to the functional group (no proton to transfer).  \n- Rigid ring systems or steric hindrance that block proton migration or π rearrangement.\n\nOptical isomerism:\nDefinition: A form of stereoisomerism where molecules are non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers) due to chirality.\nEnabling features:\n- Presence of at least one stereogenic (chiral) center: typically a carbon atom bonded to four different substituents.  \n- Absence of an internal plane or center of symmetry.  \nPreventing features:\n- Molecules lacking any stereogenic center or having an internal symmetry plane (meso forms).  \n- All substituents on a carbon being identical or arranged symmetrically so mirror images are superimposable.\nCoT agent 3SN5, analyzing benzoquinone tautomerism, thinking: Benzoquinone has conjugated carbonyls but no α-hydrogens on the carbons adjacent to the C=O groups, so it cannot donate a proton to form an enol. Without an acidic α-hydrogen and without a stabilized enol form, it cannot undergo keto–enol tautomerism.; answer: Benzoquinone does not undergo tautomerism because it lacks acidic α-hydrogens adjacent to its carbonyl groups and cannot form a stabilizing enol tautomer.\nCoT agent EP2j, analyzing cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione tautomerism, thinking: Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three carbonyl groups on a cyclohexane ring. Each carbonyl is flanked by CH2 groups bearing acidic α–hydrogens. Proton transfer from these α–hydrogens to a neighboring carbonyl oxygen generates enol forms. Those enols can further rearrange and conjugate into the aromatic triol phloroglucinol, stabilizing the tautomer. Therefore, it meets the structural requirements for keto–enol tautomerism.; answer: Yes. Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo keto–enol tautomerism (to phloroglucinol) because it has acidic α–hydrogens adjacent to its carbonyls and a π system to stabilize the enol form.\nDebate agent RVMO, round 0, debating tautomerism conclusion, thinking: Benzoquinone lacks acidic α-hydrogens adjacent to its carbonyls and cannot form an enol tautomer, whereas cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has such α-hydrogens and can tautomerize to a stabilized enolic form.; answer: The compound that does not exhibit tautomerism is benzoquinone.\nDebate agent z3kk, round 0, debating tautomerism conclusion, thinking: Benzoquinone lacks acidic α-hydrogens adjacent to its carbonyl groups and cannot form a stabilizing enol tautomer, whereas cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has α-hydrogens and can undergo keto–enol tautomerism to form phloroglucinol.; answer: Benzoquinone does not exhibit tautomerism.\nDebate agent SnG3, round 0, debating tautomerism conclusion, thinking: Benzoquinone lacks acidic α-hydrogens adjacent to its carbonyl groups and cannot form an enol tautomer, whereas cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has α-hydrogens that allow keto–enol tautomerism, so benzoquinone does not exhibit tautomerism.; answer: Benzoquinone\nDebate agent wT1O, round 0, debating tautomerism conclusion, thinking: Benzoquinone lacks acidic α-hydrogens adjacent to its carbonyl groups and cannot form an enol tautomer, whereas cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo keto–enol tautomerism to phloroglucinol.; answer: The compound that does not exhibit tautomerism is benzoquinone.\nFinal Decision agent, concluding tautomerism nonexhibitor, thinking: Benzoquinone lacks acidic α-hydrogens adjacent to its carbonyl groups and therefore cannot form an enolic tautomer, whereas cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo keto–enol tautomerism.; answer: Benzoquinone\nCoT agent Rn4C, analyzing methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate chirality, thinking: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (methyl lactate) has the α-carbon bonded to four different groups: –OH, –H, –CH3, and –COOCH3. This makes it a stereogenic center capable of existing as non-superimposable mirror images.; answer: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate can exhibit optical isomerism due to its chiral α-carbon.\nCoT agent Al0d, analyzing dimethyl fumarate chirality, thinking: Dimethyl fumarate is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, with a trans C=C double bond and no sp³ carbon bearing four different substituents. Thus it lacks any stereogenic center and cannot exist as non-superimposable mirror images.; answer: Sub-task 8: Dimethyl fumarate cannot exhibit optical isomerism because it has no chirality center.\nDebate agent 0f46, round 0, debating optical isomerism conclusion, thinking: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (methyl lactate) has an sp³ α-carbon bearing four different substituents (–OH, –H, –CH₃, –COOCH₃), making it a chiral center and thus capable of optical isomerism. Dimethyl fumarate is based on a trans C=C double bond and contains no such stereogenic sp³ carbon, so it cannot exhibit optical isomerism.; answer: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism; dimethyl fumarate does not.\nDebate agent i5qX, round 0, debating optical isomerism conclusion, thinking: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral α-carbon bearing –OH, –H, –CH₃, and –COOCH₃ groups, so it can exist as enantiomers. Dimethyl fumarate lacks any sp³ carbon with four different substituents and thus has no stereogenic center. Therefore only methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exhibits optical isomerism.; answer: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism; dimethyl fumarate does not.\nDebate agent uBSH, round 0, debating optical isomerism conclusion, thinking: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has an sp3 α-carbon bonded to –OH, –H, –CH3, and –COOCH3, making it a stereogenic center capable of existing as enantiomers. Dimethyl fumarate contains only a trans C=C and no carbon bearing four different substituents, so it cannot be optically active.; answer: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exhibits optical isomerism due to its chiral α-carbon, whereas dimethyl fumarate does not.\nDebate agent Uydv, round 0, debating optical isomerism conclusion, thinking: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral α‐carbon bearing four different substituents (–OH, –H, –CH₃, –COOCH₃), so it can exist as non‐superimposable mirror images (optical isomers). Dimethyl fumarate contains only a trans C=C and no sp³ carbon with four distinct groups, so it lacks any stereogenic center and cannot show optical isomerism.; answer: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism; dimethyl fumarate does not.\nFinal Decision agent, concluding optical isomer, thinking: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has an sp³ α-carbon bearing four different substituents (–OH, –H, –CH₃, –COOCH₃), making it a stereogenic center capable of existing as enantiomers. Dimethyl fumarate lacks any such stereogenic center, as it contains only a trans C=C and no carbon with four different groups.; answer: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism.\nCoT agent DGKy, mapping answers to choices, thinking: Sub-task 6 gives A = benzoquinone; Sub-task 9 gives B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.
