Question: Example(question='ChIP-seq on a PFA-fixed sample with an antibody to the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells followed by next-generation sequencing and standard quality control, alignment and peak-calling steps produced ChIP peaks that disappeared when PFA+DSG fixation was used. Where are we most likely to find such disappearing peaks?', choice1='At active promoters and enhancers', choice2='At repeats', choice3='In the introns of large genes', choice4='At random locations in the genome', correct_index=0)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_13
proposed answer: IKAROS binds specifically at promoters/enhancers and genuine sites remain under stringent DSG+PFA crosslinking. Peaks lost with DSG+PFA represent weak or nonspecific interactions, typical of repetitive elements. Thus disappearing peaks map to repeats.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_8_13
proposed answer: All debate agents agree that indirect IKAROS interactions disrupted by stronger PFA+DSG crosslinking are most prevalent at active promoters and enhancers. Thus the top disappearing peaks map to those regulatory regions.
