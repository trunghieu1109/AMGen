Question: Rectangles $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are drawn such that $D,E,C,F$ are collinear. Also, $A,D,H,G$ all lie on a circle. If $BC=16$,$AB=107$,$FG=17$, and $EF=184$, what is the length of $CE$?
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_4_10
proposed answer: To confirm the correctness of the computed length CE = 104, we verify all given geometric constraints and properties step-by-step:

1. Rectangles ABCD and EFGH:
- ABCD has sides AB=107 and BC=16, so placing A at (0,0), B at (107,0), C at (107,16), and D at (0,16) satisfies the rectangle properties with correct side lengths and right angles.
- EFGH has sides EF=184 and FG=17. Assigning E at (3,16) and F at (187,16) places EF horizontally with length 184. Then G at (187,33) and H at (3,33) complete the rectangle with FG=17 vertical.

2. Collinearity of points D, E, C, F:
- Points D(0,16), E(3,16), C(107,16), and F(187,16) all lie on the horizontal line y=16, confirming collinearity.

3. Concyclic points A, D, H, G:
- Points A(0,0), D(0,16), H(3,33), and G(187,33) lie on a circle.
- The circle center is at (95,8), found by equating distances from center to A and D and to H.
- The radius squared is 9089, confirmed by checking distances from center to all four points.

4. Length CE:
- Points C(107,16) and E(3,16) lie on the same horizontal line.
- Distance CE = |107 - 3| = 104.

5. Consistency and uniqueness:
- All rectangle side lengths and right angles are satisfied.
- Collinearity and concyclicity conditions hold true.
- The choice of E at (3,16) is consistent with the problem's constraints; the alternative position for E is inconsistent with rectangle placement.

Therefore, the length CE = 104 is consistent with all given conditions, satisfies the geometric constraints, and is unique under the problem's assumptions. The solution is verified and correct.
