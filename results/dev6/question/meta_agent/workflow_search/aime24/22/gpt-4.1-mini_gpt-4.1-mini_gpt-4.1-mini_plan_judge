Question: A list of positive integers has the following properties:
$\bullet$ The sum of the items in the list is $30$.
$\bullet$ The unique mode of the list is $9$.
$\bullet$ The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.
Find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_0_22
proposed answer: Step 1: Recall the candidate list identified as valid: [5, 7, 9, 9]. Step 2: Verify sum of elements equals 30: 5 + 7 + 9 + 9 = 30, which matches the problem requirement. Step 3: Verify unique mode is 9: 9 appears twice, 5 and 7 appear once each, so 9 is the unique mode. Step 4: Verify median is a positive integer not in the list: Sorted list is [5, 7, 9, 9]. Median is average of 2nd and 3rd elements: (7 + 9)/2 = 8, which is a positive integer and not in the list. Step 5: All elements are positive integers, satisfying the problem condition. Step 6: Compute sum of squares: 5^2 + 7^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 = 25 + 49 + 81 + 81 = 236. Step 7: Since all problem constraints are met and the sum of squares is computed correctly, the final answer is consistent and correct. No inconsistencies are found, so no need to revisit previous subtasks.
