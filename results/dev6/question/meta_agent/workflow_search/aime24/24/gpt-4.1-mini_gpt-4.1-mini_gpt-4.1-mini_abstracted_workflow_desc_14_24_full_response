Therefore, the ratios x/(yz), y/(xz), and z/(xy) are positive because a positive number divided by a positive number is positive. This ensures that the arguments inside the logarithms log_2(x/(yz)), log_2(y/(xz)), and log_2(z/(xy)) are positive, making the logarithmic expressions well-defined. From the given equations, we can rewrite each logarithm in exponential form: x/(yz) = 2^{1/2} = sqrt(2), y/(xz) = 2^{1/3}, and z/(xy) = 2^{1/4}. These expressions are consistent with the positivity and domain constraints and provide explicit relationships between x, y, and z.\n\n### answer by Final Decision Agent y3S0:\nx, y, and z are positive real numbers, ensuring the arguments x/(yz), y/(xz), and z/(xy) of the logarithms are positive and the logarithmic expressions are well-defined.

We want to find the absolute value of log2(x^4 y^3 z^2), which equals |4a + 3b + 2c|. First, calculate each term: 4a = 4 * (-7/24) = -28/24 = -7/6, 3b = 3 * (-3/8) = -9/8, and 2c = 2 * (-5/12) = -10/12 = -5/6. Next, sum these values: -7/6 - 9/8 - 5/6. To add, find a common denominator, which is 24. Convert each fraction: -7/6 = -28/24, -9/8 = -27/24, -5/6 = -20/24. Sum: -28/24 - 27/24 - 20/24 = -75/24. Take the absolute value: 75/24. Simplify the fraction by dividing numerator and denominator by 3: 75/3 = 25, 24/3 = 8, so the fraction reduces to 25/8. Since 25 and 8 are coprime, the fraction is in lowest terms. The problem asks for m + n where the fraction is m/n, so m = 25 and n = 8, thus m + n = 33.\n\n### answer by Final Decision Agent YeTk:\n33\n\n### Sub-task 1: Finalize sum m+n and verify fraction. \n\n ### thinking by Final Decision Agent NTTe:\nWe are given that the value of |log2(x^4 y^3 z^2)| is m/n in lowest terms, and from the previous analysis, this fraction is 25/8. To verify that 25/8 is in lowest terms, we check the greatest common divisor (gcd) of 25 and 8. Since 25 = 5^2 and 8 = 2^3, their gcd is 1, confirming the fraction is already reduced. The problem asks for the sum m + n where the fraction is m/n. Here, m = 25 and n = 8. Adding these gives 25 + 8 = 33.

We want to find the absolute value of log2(x^4 y^3 z^2), which equals |4a + 3b + 2c|. First, calculate each term: 4a = 4 * (-7/24) = -28/24 = -7/6, 3b = 3 * (-3/8) = -9/8, and 2c = 2 * (-5/12) = -10/12 = -5/6. Next, sum these values: -7/6 - 9/8 - 5/6.
