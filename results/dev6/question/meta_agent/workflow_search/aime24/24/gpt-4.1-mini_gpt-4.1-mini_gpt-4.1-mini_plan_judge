Question: Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations:
\[\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}\]\[\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}\]\[\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}\]
Then the value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: Step 1: Restate the problem and what is given. We have three equations involving logarithms base 2:

log2(x/(yz)) = 1/2
log2(y/(xz)) = 1/3
log2(z/(xy)) = 1/4

We want to find |log2(x^4 y^3 z^2)| in simplest fractional form m/n and then compute m + n.

Step 2: Convert the logarithmic equations into linear equations in terms of a = log2 x, b = log2 y, c = log2 z.

From the first equation:
log2(x) - log2(y) - log2(z) = 1/2
=> a - b - c = 1/2

From the second:
b - a - c = 1/3

From the third:
c - a - b = 1/4

Step 3: Write the system:
1) a - b - c = 1/2
2) -a + b - c = 1/3
3) -a - b + c = 1/4

Step 4: Add all three equations:
(a - b - c) + (-a + b - c) + (-a - b + c) = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4
Left side simplifies to:
a - b - c - a + b - c - a - b + c = -a - b - c
Right side:
1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 = (6/12 + 4/12 + 3/12) = 13/12

So:
-a - b - c = 13/12
=> a + b + c = -13/12

Step 5: We want to find:
log2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = 4a + 3b + 2c

Step 6: Use the original equations to express b and c in terms of a or vice versa.
From equation 1:
a - b - c = 1/2 => b + c = a - 1/2

From equation 2:
-b + a + c = -1/3 (rearranged)
But original is -a + b - c = 1/3
Rearranged: b - a - c = 1/3 => b = a + c + 1/3

From equation 3:
-c + a + b = -1/4 (rearranged)
Original: -a - b + c = 1/4
Rearranged: c = a + b - 1/4

Step 7: Substitute b from step 6 into c:
c = a + (a + c + 1/3) - 1/4 = 2a + c + (1/3 - 1/4)
=> c - c = 2a + (1/12)
=> 0 = 2a + 1/12
=> a = -1/24

Step 8: Find b:
b = a + c + 1/3
But c = a + b - 1/4
Substitute c into b:
b = a + (a + b - 1/4) + 1/3 = 2a + b + (1/3 - 1/4) = 2a + b + 1/12

Subtract b from both sides:
b - b = 2a + 1/12
0 = 2a + 1/12
We already have a = -1/24, check consistency:
2*(-1/24) + 1/12 = -1/12 + 1/12 = 0
Consistent.

Step 9: Now find b:
From b = a + c + 1/3
We need c:
From c = a + b - 1/4
Substitute a = -1/24:
c = -1/24 + b - 1/4 = b - (1/4 + 1/24) = b - 7/24

Then b = a + c + 1/3 = -1/24 + (b - 7/24) + 1/3 = b - 8/24 + 1/3 = b - 1/3 + 1/3 = b

This is tautological, so no contradiction.

Step 10: Use equation 1: a - b - c = 1/2
Substitute c = b - 7/24:
-1/24 - b - (b - 7/24) = 1/2
-1/24 - b - b + 7/24 = 1/2
(-1/24 + 7/24) - 2b = 1/2
6/24 - 2b = 1/2
1/4 - 2b = 1/2
-2b = 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4
b = -1/8

Step 11: Find c:
c = b - 7/24 = -1/8 - 7/24 = (-3/24) - (7/24) = -10/24 = -5/12

Step 12: Now compute 4a + 3b + 2c:
4*(-1/24) + 3*(-1/8) + 2*(-5/12) =
-4/24 - 3/8 - 10/12 =
-1/6 - 3/8 - 5/6
Find common denominator 24:
-1/6 = -4/24
-3/8 = -9/24
-5/6 = -20/24
Sum = -4/24 - 9/24 - 20/24 = -33/24 = -11/8

Step 13: Take absolute value:
| -11/8 | = 11/8

Step 14: Check if fraction is in lowest terms:
11 and 8 share no common factors, so fraction is reduced.

Step 15: Compute m + n = 11 + 8 = 19

Step 16: Compare with previous answer 33. The previous answer was 25/8 with sum 33, but our detailed calculation yields 11/8 with sum 19.

Step 17: Re-examine the problem and calculations. The previous answer 25/8 came from the initial analysis, but our step-by-step solution shows 11/8.

Step 18: Verify the initial sum of the right sides:
1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 = 6/12 + 4/12 + 3/12 = 13/12 correct.

Step 19: The system and substitutions are consistent and algebraically sound.

Step 20: Therefore, the correct value of |log2(x^4 y^3 z^2)| is 11/8, and m + n = 19.

Conclusion: The previous answer 33 corresponds to fraction 25/8, which does not match the system solution. Our detailed verification shows the correct fraction is 11/8, so the final answer should be 19. The entire solution process is consistent and correct, confirming the final answer matches the problem requirements.

proposed answer: Step 1: Verify that the values a = -7/24, b = -3/8, c = -5/12 satisfy the original logarithmic equations:

Original equations in terms of a, b, c:
1) a - b - c = 1/2
2) b - a - c = 1/3
3) c - a - b = 1/4

Substitute the values:
- Convert fractions to a common denominator (24) for easier addition:
  a = -7/24
  b = -3/8 = -9/24
  c = -5/12 = -10/24

Check equation (1):
 a - b - c = (-7/24) - (-9/24) - (-10/24) = (-7/24) + (9/24) + (10/24) = 12/24 = 1/2 ✓

Check equation (2):
 b - a - c = (-9/24) - (-7/24) - (-10/24) = (-9/24) + (7/24) + (10/24) = 8/24 = 1/3 ✓

Check equation (3):
 c - a - b = (-10/24) - (-7/24) - (-9/24) = (-10/24) + (7/24) + (9/24) = 6/24 = 1/4 ✓

All three equations are exactly satisfied.

Step 2: Confirm the computed value of |log2(x^4 y^3 z^2)|:

log2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = 4a + 3b + 2c
Calculate each term:
4a = 4 * (-7/24) = -28/24 = -7/6
3b = 3 * (-3/8) = -9/8
2c = 2 * (-5/12) = -10/12 = -5/6

Sum:
-7/6 - 9/8 - 5/6
Find common denominator 24:
-7/6 = -28/24
-9/8 = -27/24
-5/6 = -20/24
Sum = -28/24 - 27/24 - 20/24 = -75/24
Absolute value = 75/24
Simplify by dividing numerator and denominator by 3:
75/3 = 25, 24/3 = 8
So, |log2(x^4 y^3 z^2)| = 25/8

Step 3: Verify that 25/8 is in lowest terms:
25 and 8 share no common factors other than 1, so fraction is reduced.

Step 4: Compute m + n where fraction = m/n = 25/8:
m + n = 25 + 8 = 33

Step 5: Cross-validation with previous results:
- The system was shown to be solvable with unique solution (determinant nonzero).
- The values of a, b, c satisfy the system exactly.
- The computed value of |log2(x^4 y^3 z^2)| matches the fraction 25/8.
- The sum m + n = 33 matches the final answer given.

No inconsistencies found.

Conclusion: The solution is consistent, correct, and complete.
