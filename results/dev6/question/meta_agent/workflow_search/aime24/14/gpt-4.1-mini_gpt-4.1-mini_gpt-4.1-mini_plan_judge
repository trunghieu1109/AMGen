Question: Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.

proposed answer: To verify the derived supremum of BD^2 = 480, we consider the parameterization and the function BD^2(t) = (176/(1 - t^2)) - 96, where t = tanh(v) and t lies in (5/6, 1). At t = 5/6, BD^2 = 480 exactly. For values of t slightly greater than 5/6, BD^2 increases and tends to infinity as t approaches 1 from below. This means BD^2 can be made arbitrarily large but never less than 480 for the rhombi inscribed as described. Constructing sample rhombi with t values close to 5/6 (e.g., t = 0.84, 0.85, 0.86) yields BD^2 values slightly above 480, confirming that 480 is the minimum BD^2 value achievable and thus the greatest real number less than all BD^2 values. Since BD^2 cannot be less than 480, and values approach 480 from above, the supremum is consistent and correct. This step-by-step verification confirms the correctness and completeness of the answer.
