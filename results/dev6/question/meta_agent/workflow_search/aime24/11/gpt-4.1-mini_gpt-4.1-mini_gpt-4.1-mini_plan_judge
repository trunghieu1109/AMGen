proposed answer: We are asked to find the number of lattice paths from (0,0) to (8,8) on an 8x8 grid that have exactly four direction changes. Each path consists of 16 steps: 8 rights (R) and 8 ups (U). A direction change occurs when the path switches from R to U or U to R. Exactly four direction changes means the path is composed of five monotone segments alternating between R and U. 

Step 1: Determine the pattern of segments. Since there are 4 direction changes, the path is split into 5 segments. These segments alternate directions, so the path either starts with R or starts with U.

- Case 1: Start with R. Then the pattern of segments is R - U - R - U - R. Here, there are 3 R segments and 2 U segments.
- Case 2: Start with U. Then the pattern is U - R - U - R - U. Here, there are 3 U segments and 2 R segments.

Step 2: Each segment must have a positive length (no zero-length segments), and the total number of R steps is 8, total U steps is 8.

Step 3: Count the number of ways to partition the R steps and U steps into the required number of positive segments.

- Number of ways to write 8 as the sum of 3 positive integers = combinations of placing 2 dividers among 7 slots = C(7,2) = 21.
- Number of ways to write 8 as the sum of 2 positive integers = C(7,1) = 7.

Step 4: Calculate the number of paths for each case.

- Case 1 (start with R): R segments = 3 parts, U segments = 2 parts.
  Number of ways = 21 (for R) * 7 (for U) = 147.

- Case 2 (start with U): U segments = 3 parts, R segments = 2 parts.
  Number of ways = 21 (for U) * 7 (for R) = 147.

Step 5: Sum both cases to get the total number of paths with exactly four direction changes:

147 + 147 = 294.

Step 6: Verify no double counting or omissions.

- The two cases (starting with R or U) are mutually exclusive.
- Each unique partition corresponds to a unique path because the order and lengths of segments uniquely determine the path.
- The counting method uses standard combinatorial compositions, ensuring no zero-length segments.

Step 7: Cross-check with symmetry arguments.

- The problem is symmetric with respect to starting direction.
- The counts for both cases are equal, which aligns with the symmetry.

Therefore, the final verified count of lattice paths from (0,0) to (8,8) with exactly four direction changes is 294.
