To find the maximum value over θ in [0, 2π), we recognize this as a linear combination of sine and cosine functions. Such expressions can be rewritten in the form R cos(θ - α), where R = sqrt(a^2 + b^2) and α = arctan(b/a) for expression a cosθ + b sinθ. Here, a = 324 and b = -432. \n\nCalculate R: R = sqrt(324^2 + (-432)^2) = sqrt(104976 + 186624) = sqrt(291600) = 540. \n\nCalculate α: α = arctan(b/a) = arctan(-432/324) = arctan(-4/3). This angle α is the phase shift. \n\nThus, Real part = 540 cos(θ - α). The maximum value of cos function is 1, so the maximum real part is 540. This maximum is achieved when θ - α = 0 (mod 2π), i.e., θ = α (mod 2π). \n\nTherefore, the largest possible real part of the given expression is 540, achieved at θ = arctan(-4/3) (mod 2π). This approach uses the trigonometric identity for combining sine and cosine terms and the knowledge that the maximum of cosine is 1, ensuring no domain or optimization errors.\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent WJLV:\n540\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Your problem is to verify and finalize the maximum real part of the expression given |z|=4.
