Question: Alice chooses a set $A$ of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets $B$ of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of $B$ belongs to $A$. Bob's list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A.

proposed answer: The problem states that Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers such that the maximum element of B belongs to A, and the total number of such sets is 2024. We know that for each element a in A, the number of sets B with max(B) = a is 2^(a-1), because these sets are exactly the subsets of {1, 2, ..., a} that contain a, and there are 2^(a-1) such subsets. Therefore, the total number of sets B is the sum over all a in A of 2^(a-1). We want to find a set A such that sum_{a in A} 2^(a-1) = 2024. To find A, we express 2024 as a sum of distinct powers of two. Converting 2024 to binary gives 111111001000. The bits set to 1 correspond to powers of two at positions 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 (counting from 0 for the least significant bit). Each element a in A corresponds to bit position k + 1, so A = {4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11}. We verify the sum: 2^3 + 2^5 + 2^6 + 2^7 + 2^8 + 2^9 + 2^10 = 8 + 32 + 64 + 128 + 256 + 512 + 1024 = 2024, confirming correctness. Finally, we compute the sum of elements in A: 4 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 = 55. This matches the problem's requirement and confirms the solution.
