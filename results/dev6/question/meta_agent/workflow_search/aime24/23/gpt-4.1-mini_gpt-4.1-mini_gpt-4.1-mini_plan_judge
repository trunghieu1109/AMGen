Question: Find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid so that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is $999$, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is $99$. The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$.
\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\ \hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\ \hline \end{array}\]

proposed answer: Step 1: Define variables for the digits in the grid: top row digits are a, b, c; bottom row digits are d, e, f, each between 0 and 9.

Step 2: The problem states two conditions:
- The sum of the two 3-digit numbers formed by the rows is 999:
  100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999.
- The sum of the three 2-digit numbers formed by the columns is 99:
  (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99.

Step 3: Simplify the equations:
- Row sum: 100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999.
- Column sum: 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99.

Step 4: Let A = a + d, B = b + e, C = c + f.
Then row sum becomes: 100A + 10B + C = 999.

Step 5: Since 999 = 900 + 90 + 9, the natural choice is A = 9, B = 9, C = 9.
Check: 100*9 + 10*9 + 9 = 900 + 90 + 9 = 999.

Step 6: From the column sum:
10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99.
But (d + e + f) = (A + B + C) - (a + b + c) = 27 - (a + b + c).
So, 10(a + b + c) + 27 - (a + b + c) = 99 => 9(a + b + c) + 27 = 99 => 9(a + b + c) = 72 => a + b + c = 8.

Step 7: Since A = a + d = 9, then d = 9 - a; similarly e = 9 - b, f = 9 - c.

Step 8: The digits a, b, c must be between 0 and 9, and sum to 8. For each such triple, d, e, f are uniquely determined and also between 0 and 9 because 9 - a, 9 - b, 9 - c will be between 0 and 9.

Step 9: Count the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c = 8 with 0 ≤ a,b,c ≤ 9.
Using stars and bars, number of solutions = C(8 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(10, 2) = 45.

Step 10: Each such triple corresponds to exactly one valid grid satisfying both sum conditions.

Step 11: Confirm no solutions are missed:
- The choice A = B = C = 9 is forced by the row sum decomposition.
- The column sum condition forces a + b + c = 8.
- The digits d, e, f are uniquely determined by a, b, c.
- All digits are within 0-9.

Step 12: Confirm no duplicates:
- Each (a,b,c) triple corresponds to a unique (d,e,f) triple.
- No two different (a,b,c) triples produce the same grid.

Step 13: Confirm alignment with problem constraints:
- Leading zeros allowed, as shown in the example.
- Digits are from 0 to 9.
- Sum conditions are satisfied.

Therefore, the final verified number of valid digit placements is 45.

proposed answer: Step 1: Variables and constraints were clearly defined: digits a,b,c in top row, d,e,f in bottom row, all between 0 and 9.

Step 2: The sum of the two 3-digit numbers formed by rows equals 999, which was expanded and simplified to the system: a + d = 9, b + e = 9, c + f = 9.

Step 3: The sum of the three 2-digit numbers formed by columns equals 99, which after substitution and simplification gave the equation 9(a + b + c) + 27 = 99, leading to a + b + c = 8.

Step 4: Since a,b,c are digits 0-9, and d,e,f = 9 - a, 9 - b, 9 - c, these are also digits 0-9, so no digit restrictions are violated.

Step 5: Counting the number of nonnegative integer solutions to a + b + c = 8 with each ≤ 9 is straightforward because 8 ≤ 9, so no upper bound restrictions apply.

Step 6: The number of solutions is combinations with repetition: C(8+3-1,3-1) = C(10,2) = 45.

Step 7: Each solution (a,b,c) uniquely determines (d,e,f), so no duplicates occur.

Step 8: The example given in the problem matches one such solution, confirming the correctness of the approach.

Step 9: No solutions are missed because the problem constraints are fully captured by the equations derived.

Step 10: The reasoning is consistent, complete, and aligns with the problem constraints.

Therefore, the final verified number of valid digit placements is 45.
