Each digit is between 0 and 9.\n\nStep 2: From the problem, the sum of the two 3-digit numbers formed by the rows is 999:\n(100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999.\n\nStep 3: The sum of the three 2-digit numbers formed by the columns is 99:\n(10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99.\n\nStep 4: From the first sum, rearranged:\n100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999.\nSince 999 = 900 + 90 + 9, this implies:\na + d = 9,\nb + e = 9,\nc + f = 9.\n\nStep 5: Express bottom row digits in terms of top row digits:\nd = 9 - a, e = 9 - b, f = 9 - c.\n\nStep 6: Substitute into the second sum:\n(10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99\n=> (10a + 9 - a) + (10b + 9 - b) + (10c + 9 - c) = 99\n=> (9a + 9) + (9b + 9) + (9c + 9) = 99\n=> 9(a + b + c) + 27 = 99\n=> 9(a + b + c) = 72\n=> a + b + c = 8.\n\nStep 7: Since digits are from 0 to 9, and d, e, f = 9 - a, 9 - b, 9 - c must also be digits (0-9), a, b, c must be between 0 and 9.

By standard mathematical convention, a 3-digit number must have a nonzero leading digit (i.e., the hundreds place cannot be zero). However, the example given in the problem shows the first row as 008, which numerically equals 8, not a 3-digit number. This suggests that the problem allows leading zeros in the rows, treating the numbers as three-digit strings rather than strict 3-digit numbers. The sum 008 + 991 = 999 holds true as a sum of numbers, but 008 is not a 3-digit number in the strict sense. Therefore, the example contradicts the standard definition of a 3-digit number. Given this, enforcing that the leading digits (cells a and d) must be nonzero would exclude the example solution, which is explicitly stated as valid. Hence, the problem implicitly allows leading zeros in the rows, meaning the leading digits can be zero. To avoid overcounting invalid solutions, we must accept that leading zeros are allowed and treat the row numbers as 3-digit strings rather than strict 3-digit numbers. This assumption aligns with the example and the problem statement. Therefore, for all subsequent subtasks, we do not enforce the leading digits to be nonzero; leading zeros are allowed in the rows. This is crucial to correctly count all valid digit placements that satisfy the sum conditions.; answer - Leading zeros are allowed in the two 3-digit numbers formed by the rows, as evidenced by the example where the first row is 008. Therefore, the leading digits (cells a and d) are not required to be nonzero. We treat the row numbers as 3-digit strings rather than strict 3-digit numbers. This assumption is necessary to include the example solution and avoid excluding valid solutions. Hence, no leading-digit constraints (nonzero) are enforced on the rows for this problem.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 1.1 output: thinking - We are given two 3-digit numbers formed by the rows of the grid: the first row digits are a, b, c and the second row digits are d, e, f. Their sum is 999. We want to express this addition digit-wise, incorporating carry variables to account for the carry-over in addition. Let c0, c1, c2 be the carry-in variables for the units, tens, and hundreds places respectively, and c3 be the carry-out from the hundreds place. Since the sum is exactly 999, which is a 3-digit number, there is no carry beyond the hundreds place, so c3 = 0.\n\nThe addition is:\n\n  a b c\n+ d e f\n-------\n  9 9 9\n\nStarting from the units place (rightmost digit):\n- The sum of the units digits plus carry-in c0 equals the units digit of the sum plus 10 times the carry-out c1.\n- Similarly for tens and hundreds places.\n\nFormally:\n1) a + d + c0 = 9 + 10 * c1\n2) b + e + c1 = 9 + 10 * c2\n3) c + f + c2 = 9 + 10 * c3\n\nSince c3 = 0, the last equation simplifies to c + f + c2 = 9.\n\nEach carry variable c0, c1, c2 can be either 0 or 1 because the sum of two digits (0-9) plus a carry (0 or 1) can be at most 19, which means the carry out can only be 0 or 1.\n\nIt is crucial to consider all possible carry scenarios (0 or 1) for c0, c1, c2 to avoid missing valid solutions. Ignoring carry effects or assuming fixed carries would lead to incomplete or incorrect solution sets. This digit-wise formulation with carry variables fully captures the addition constraints and allows systematic enumeration or algebraic solving of the digit assignments.; answer - Define variables a,b,c,d,e,f as the digits in the grid (top row: a,b,c; bottom row: d,e,f). Define carry variables c0, c1, c2 for the units, tens, and hundreds places respectively, each can be 0 or 1.

From the digit-wise addition of the rows, with carry variables c0, c1, c2 (each 0 or 1), and c3=0, we have the equations:\n\n1) a + d + c0 = 9 + 10*c1\n2) b + e + c1 = 9 + 10*c2\n3) c + f + c2 = 9 + 10*c3 = 9\n\nFrom the column sum constraint:\n(10*a + d) + (10*b + e) + (10*c + f) = 99\nwhich simplifies to:\n10*(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99\n\nSumming the three addition equations:\n(a + d + c0) + (b + e + c1) + (c + f + c2) = 27 + 10*(c1 + c2)\n=> (a + b + c) + (d + e + f) + (c0 + c1 + c2) = 27 + 10*(c1 + c2)\n\nRearranged:\n(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 27 + 10*(c1 + c2) - (c0 + c1 + c2) = 27 + 9*c1 + 9*c2 - c0\n\nLet S = a + b + c and T = d + e + f. From the column sum constraint:\n10*S + T = 99\nFrom the above sum:\nS + T = 27 + 9*c1 + 9*c2 - c0\n\nSubstituting T = 99 - 10*S into the second equation:\nS + (99 - 10*S) = 27 + 9*c1 + 9*c2 - c0\n=> 99 - 9*S = 27 + 9*c1 + 9*c2 - c0\n=> 72 - 9*c1 - 9*c2 + c0 = 9*S\n\nDividing by 9:\n8 - c1 - c2 + c0/9 = S\n\nSince S is integer and c0 ∈ {0,1}, c0 must be 0 to keep S integer.

The digits in the grid are a,b,c (top row) and d,e,f (bottom row). The carry variables are c0, c1, c2, c3 for the column-wise addition.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the first column addition: a + d = 9 + 10*c1.\n- Since a and d are digits (0-9), their sum can be at most 18.\n- If c1=1, then a + d = 19, which is impossible.\n- Therefore, c1=0 and a + d = 9.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the second column addition: b + e + c1 = 9 + 10*c2.\n- With c1=0, b + e = 9 + 10*c2.\n- If c2=1, b + e = 19, impossible for digits 0-9.\n- Therefore, c2=0 and b + e = 9.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the third column addition: c + f + c2 = 9.\n- With c2=0, c + f = 9.\n\nStep 4: Sum of columns: 10*(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99.\n- From previous sums, a + d = 9, b + e = 9, c + f = 9.\n- So (a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 27.\n- Substitute into sum: 10*(a + b + c) + (27 - (a + b + c)) = 99.\n- Simplify: 9*(a + b + c) + 27 = 99 => 9*(a + b + c) = 72 => a + b + c = 8.\n\nStep 5: Since a + b + c = 8 and a + d = 9, b + e = 9, c + f = 9, then d + e + f = 19.\n\nStep 6: Digit ranges:\n- a,b,c ∈ {0,...,8} because their sum is 8.\n- d = 9 - a, e = 9 - b, f = 9 - c, so d,e,f ∈ {1,...,9}.\n\nStep 7: Carry variables c0 and c3 are zero as no carry-in or carry-out beyond the digits.\n\nStep 8: Leading zeros are allowed as per the example, so no restriction on a or d being zero.\n\nFinalization:\n- Carry variables: c0=0, c1=0, c2=0, c3=0.\n- Digit sums per column: a + d = 9, b + e = 9, c + f = 9.\n- Sum of top row digits: a + b + c = 8.\n- Sum of bottom row digits: d + e + f = 19.\n- Digit ranges: a,b,c ∈ {0,...,8}, d=9 - a, e=9 - b, f=9 - c.\n- Leading zeros allowed.\n\nThis finalization prunes impossible digit assignments early and ensures correctness by reducing the problem to enumerating triples (a,b,c) with sum 8 and digits ≤ 8, then computing (d,e,f) accordingly, with no carry propagation in any column.; answer - Carry variables are fixed as c0=0, c1=0, c2=0, c3=0. The digits satisfy a + d = 9, b + e = 9, c + f = 9, with a + b + c = 8. The digits a,b,c are in the range 0 to 8, and d,e,f are determined by d=9 - a, e=9 - b, f=9 - c, ensuring all digits are between 0 and 9. Leading zeros are allowed. No carry is propagated in any column. This finalization reduces the problem to enumerating all triples (a,b,c) with digits 0-8 summing to 8, and computing (d,e,f) accordingly.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2.1 output: thinking - From the previous detailed analysis and multiple chain-of-thought answers, the problem reduces to finding all triples (a,b,c) of digits from 0 to 8 such that a + b + c = 8. For each such triple, the bottom row digits are uniquely determined by d = 9 - a, e = 9 - b, and f = 9 - c. This ensures that each column sums to 9 (a + d = 9, b + e = 9, c + f = 9), and since the carry variables are zero, the sum of the two 3-digit numbers formed by the rows is exactly 999. Similarly, the sum of the three 2-digit numbers formed by the columns is 99. Leading zeros are allowed, so no restriction on a, b, or c being zero. The digits d, e, f are guaranteed to be between 1 and 9 inclusive because a, b, c are at most 8. This construction satisfies all digit range constraints and sum conditions. Therefore, the valid digit assignments are exactly all 2x3 grids where the top row digits (a,b,c) satisfy a + b + c = 8 with each digit in 0 to 8, and the bottom row digits are (9 - a, 9 - b, 9 - c). This set exhaustively and uniquely covers all solutions without double counting. The number of such triples (a,b,c) with digits 0 to 8 summing to 8 is the number of nonnegative integer solutions to a + b + c = 8, which is C(8+3-1,3-1) = C(10,2) = 45. Hence, there are 45 valid digit assignments satisfying both sum conditions. This conclusion is justified step-by-step by: (1) analyzing the sum constraints and carry variables, (2) deducing the relationship between top and bottom row digits, (3) confirming digit ranges and leading zero allowance, (4) enumerating all possible triples (a,b,c) summing to 8, and (5) verifying that these assignments satisfy the sum conditions exactly. Thus, the synthesis and confirmation of valid digit assignments is complete and rigorous.; answer - 45\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2.2 output: thinking - The problem requires counting the number of distinct digit assignments in a 2x3 grid such that the sum of the two 3-digit numbers formed by the rows is 999, and the sum of the three 2-digit numbers formed by the columns is 99. Leading zeros are allowed, and digits range from 0 to 9. From the sum conditions, each column's digits sum to 9, i.e., a + d = 9, b + e = 9, c + f = 9, where (a,b,c) are the top row digits and (d,e,f) are the bottom row digits. This implies d = 9 - a, e = 9 - b, f = 9 - c. Since digits must be between 0 and 9, a, b, c must be between 0 and 9, but since d, e, f = 9 - a, 9 - b, 9 - c must also be digits, a, b, c must be between 0 and 9 as well. However, to ensure d, e, f are digits (0-9), a, b, c must be between 0 and 9. The sum of the two 3-digit numbers formed by the rows is (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999. Substituting d, e, f, this becomes (a + d)*100 + (b + e)*10 + (c + f) = 999, which simplifies to 9*100 + 9*10 + 9 = 999, confirming the sum condition. The sum of the three 2-digit numbers formed by the columns is (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99. Substituting d, e, f, this becomes 10a + (9 - a) + 10b + (9 - b) + 10c + (9 - c) = 9a + 9b + 9c + 27 = 99, which simplifies to a + b + c = 8. Therefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of nonnegative integer solutions (a,b,c) to a + b + c = 8 with 0 ≤ a,b,c ≤ 8. The number of such solutions is the number of combinations with repetition: C(8+3-1,3-1) = C(10,2) = 45. Each such triple (a,b,c) uniquely determines (d,e,f) = (9 - a, 9 - b, 9 - c), so each corresponds to a unique valid digit assignment. Leading zeros are allowed, so no restrictions on a,b,c being zero. There are no duplicates because each triple (a,b,c) corresponds to a unique grid.

By standard mathematical convention, a 3-digit number must have a nonzero leading digit (i.e., the hundreds place cannot be zero). However, the example given in the problem shows the first row as 008, which numerically equals 8, not a 3-digit number. This suggests that the problem allows leading zeros in the rows, treating the numbers as three-digit strings rather than strict 3-digit numbers. The sum 008 + 991 = 999 holds true as a sum of numbers, but 008 is not a 3-digit number in the strict sense. Therefore, the example contradicts the standard definition of a 3-digit number. Given this, enforcing that the leading digits (cells a and d) must be nonzero would exclude the example solution, which is explicitly stated as valid. Hence, the problem implicitly allows leading zeros in the rows, meaning the leading digits can be zero. To avoid overcounting invalid solutions, we must accept that leading zeros are allowed and treat the row numbers as 3-digit strings rather than strict 3-digit numbers. This assumption aligns with the example and the problem statement. Therefore, for all subsequent subtasks, we do not enforce the leading digits to be nonzero; leading zeros are allowed in the rows. This is crucial to correctly count all valid digit placements that satisfy the sum conditions.; answer: Leading zeros are allowed in the two 3-digit numbers formed by the rows, as evidenced by the example where the first row is 008. Therefore, the leading digits (cells a and d) are not required to be nonzero. We treat the row numbers as 3-digit strings rather than strict 3-digit numbers. This assumption is necessary to include the example solution and avoid excluding valid solutions. Hence, no leading-digit constraints (nonzero) are enforced on the rows for this problem.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT agent weOp, formulating addition with carry, thinking: We are given two 3-digit numbers formed by the rows of the grid: the first row digits are a, b, c and the second row digits are d, e, f. Their sum is 999. We want to express this addition digit-wise, incorporating carry variables to account for the carry-over in addition. Let c0, c1, c2 be the carry-in variables for the units, tens, and hundreds places respectively, and c3 be the carry-out from the hundreds place. Since the sum is exactly 999, which is a 3-digit number, there is no carry beyond the hundreds place, so c3 = 0.\n\nThe addition is:\n\n  a b c\n+ d e f\n-------\n  9 9 9\n\nStarting from the units place (rightmost digit):\n- The sum of the units digits plus carry-in c0 equals the units digit of the sum plus 10 times the carry-out c1.\n- Similarly for tens and hundreds places.\n\nFormally:\n1) a + d + c0 = 9 + 10 * c1\n2) b + e + c1 = 9 + 10 * c2\n3) c + f + c2 = 9 + 10 * c3\n\nSince c3 = 0, the last equation simplifies to c + f + c2 = 9.\n\nEach carry variable c0, c1, c2 can be either 0 or 1 because the sum of two digits (0-9) plus a carry (0 or 1) can be at most 19, which means the carry out can only be 0 or 1.\n\nIt is crucial to consider all possible carry scenarios (0 or 1) for c0, c1, c2 to avoid missing valid solutions. Ignoring carry effects or assuming fixed carries would lead to incomplete or incorrect solution sets. This digit-wise formulation with carry variables fully captures the addition constraints and allows systematic enumeration or algebraic solving of the digit assignments.; answer: Define variables a,b,c,d,e,f as the digits in the grid (top row: a,b,c; bottom row: d,e,f). Define carry variables c0, c1, c2 for the units, tens, and hundreds places respectively, each can be 0 or 1.

The digits a,b,c are in the range 0 to 8, and d,e,f are determined by d=9 - a, e=9 - b, f=9 - c, ensuring all digits are between 0 and 9.

For each such triple, compute d,e,f by subtracting a,b,c from 9 respectively. Then verify the sum conditions: the sum of the two 3-digit numbers formed by the rows is 999, and the sum of the three 2-digit numbers formed by the columns is 99. Since the carry variables are zero and the digit sums per column are fixed, these sum conditions will hold if the digit assignments satisfy the above constraints. The enumeration is straightforward: iterate over all (a,b,c) with digits 0 to 8 and sum 8, compute (d,e,f), and check digit validity (which will hold by construction).

For each such triple, the corresponding digits in the bottom row are determined by d=9-a, e=9-b, f=9-c, ensuring each is between 1 and 9 inclusive. The carry variables are all zero, so no carry propagation needs to be considered. Leading zeros are allowed, so no restriction is placed on a, b, or c being zero. The two conditions to verify are: (1) the sum of the two 3-digit numbers formed by the rows equals 999, and (2) the sum of the three 2-digit numbers formed by the columns equals 99. Due to the constraints, these conditions are guaranteed if the digits satisfy the sums a+d=9, b+e=9, c+f=9, and a+b+c=8. Therefore, the enumeration procedure is as follows: systematically generate all (a,b,c) with digits 0-8 summing to 8; compute (d,e,f) as 9 minus each of a,b,c; verify that all digits are in the valid range (which they will be by construction); then confirm the sums (rows and columns) equal 999 and 99 respectively (which they will, given the constraints).

Verify the sums: (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999 and (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99. Given the constraints, these sums will hold. This method enumerates all valid digit assignments satisfying the problem conditions exhaustively and without double counting.\n<SEPERATOR>\nFinal Decision agent 8Vdv, synthesizing valid digit assignments, thinking: From the previous detailed analysis and multiple chain-of-thought answers, the problem reduces to finding all triples (a,b,c) of digits from 0 to 8 such that a + b + c = 8. For each such triple, the bottom row digits are uniquely determined by d = 9 - a, e = 9 - b, and f = 9 - c. This ensures that each column sums to 9 (a + d = 9, b + e = 9, c + f = 9), and since the carry variables are zero, the sum of the two 3-digit numbers formed by the rows is exactly 999. Similarly, the sum of the three 2-digit numbers formed by the columns is 99. Leading zeros are allowed, so no restriction on a, b, or c being zero. The digits d, e, f are guaranteed to be between 1 and 9 inclusive because a, b, c are at most 8. This construction satisfies all digit range constraints and sum conditions. Therefore, the valid digit assignments are exactly all 2x3 grids where the top row digits (a,b,c) satisfy a + b + c = 8 with each digit in 0 to 8, and the bottom row digits are (9 - a, 9 - b, 9 - c). This set exhaustively and uniquely covers all solutions without double counting. The number of such triples (a,b,c) with digits 0 to 8 summing to 8 is the number of nonnegative integer solutions to a + b + c = 8, which is C(8+3-1,3-1) = C(10,2) = 45. Hence, there are 45 valid digit assignments satisfying both sum conditions. This conclusion is justified step-by-step by: (1) analyzing the sum constraints and carry variables, (2) deducing the relationship between top and bottom row digits, (3) confirming digit ranges and leading zero allowance, (4) enumerating all possible triples (a,b,c) summing to 8, and (5) verifying that these assignments satisfy the sum conditions exactly. Thus, the synthesis and confirmation of valid digit assignments is complete and rigorous.; answer: 45\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent UaYV, filtering and verifying uniqueness, thinking: From the previous analysis, the problem reduces to finding all triples (a, b, c) of digits from 0 to 8 such that a + b + c = 8. Each such triple uniquely determines the bottom row digits as (9 - a, 9 - b, 9 - c). This ensures:\n\n1. The sum of the two 3-digit numbers formed by the rows is exactly 999 because each column sums to 9 without carryover.\n2. The sum of the three 2-digit numbers formed by the columns is 99.\n3. Leading zeros are allowed, so no restrictions on a, b, or c being zero.\n4. The digits d, e, f = (9 - a, 9 - b, 9 - c) are between 1 and 9 inclusive, since a, b, c ≤ 8.\n\nFiltering duplicates is not necessary because each triple (a, b, c) corresponds to exactly one unique grid configuration. The problem constraints are respected: digits are in 0-9, sums match, and leading zeros are permitted.\n\nThe number of such triples is the count of nonnegative integer solutions to a + b + c = 8, which is C(8+3-1, 3-1) = C(10, 2) = 45.\n\nTherefore, after filtering duplicates and confirming uniqueness and validity, there are exactly 45 valid digit assignments satisfying all problem constraints.; answer: 45\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent 3wcW, filtering and verifying uniqueness, thinking: The problem requires counting the number of distinct digit assignments in a 2x3 grid that satisfy two sum conditions: the sum of the two 3-digit numbers formed by the rows is 999, and the sum of the three 2-digit numbers formed by the columns is 99. Leading zeros are allowed, and digits range from 0 to 9. From the analysis, the digits in the top row are (a,b,c) and bottom row digits are (d,e,f). The sum of the two row numbers is 999, so (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999. The sum of the three column numbers is 99, so (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99. By examining the column sums, each column's digits sum to 9: a + d = 9, b + e = 9, c + f = 9. This implies d = 9 - a, e = 9 - b, f = 9 - c. Substituting into the row sum equation, we get (a + d)*100 + (b + e)*10 + (c + f) = 999, which simplifies to 9*100 + 9*10 + 9 = 999, confirming the condition. The only constraint on (a,b,c) is that each is between 0 and 8 (since d,e,f must be digits 0-9), and the sum a + b + c = 8. Counting the number of nonnegative integer solutions to a + b + c = 8 with 0 ≤ a,b,c ≤ 8 is the number of combinations with repetition: C(8+3-1,3-1) = C(10,2) = 45. Each such triple uniquely determines the bottom row digits and thus a unique grid. There are no duplicates because each triple (a,b,c) corresponds to a unique (d,e,f). Leading zeros allowed means no restriction on a,b,c being zero. Therefore, after filtering duplicates and confirming constraints, there are exactly 45 valid digit assignments satisfying both sum conditions.; answer: 45\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent ZBTh, filtering and verifying uniqueness, thinking: Starting from the previous analysis, we have the characterization of all valid digit assignments: the top row digits (a,b,c) are digits from 0 to 8 such that a + b + c = 8, and the bottom row digits are (9 - a, 9 - b, 9 - c). This guarantees that each column sums to 9, so the sum of the two 3-digit numbers formed by the rows is 999, and the sum of the three 2-digit numbers formed by the columns is 99. Since a, b, c are digits 0 to 8, the bottom row digits (9 - a, 9 - b, 9 - c) are digits 1 to 9, so all digits are valid (0-9). Leading zeros are allowed as per the example, so no restriction there. Next, we confirm uniqueness: each triple (a,b,c) corresponds to a unique bottom row triple (9 - a, 9 - b, 9 - c), so no duplicates arise. The number of solutions is the number of nonnegative integer solutions to a + b + c = 8 with each digit ≤ 8, which is C(8+3-1,3-1) = C(10,2) = 45. Since all these solutions satisfy the sum conditions and digit constraints, and no duplicates exist, the count of valid solutions is exactly 45. Thus, after filtering duplicates and verifying constraints, the number of valid digit assignments is 45.; answer: 45\n<SEPERATOR>\nFinal Decision agent 8VbG, finalizing unique valid assignments, thinking: The problem requires counting the number of distinct digit assignments in a 2x3 grid such that the sum of the two 3-digit numbers formed by the rows is 999, and the sum of the three 2-digit numbers formed by the columns is 99. Leading zeros are allowed, and digits range from 0 to 9. From the sum conditions, each column's digits sum to 9, i.e., a + d = 9, b + e = 9, c + f = 9, where (a,b,c) are the top row digits and (d,e,f) are the bottom row digits. This implies d = 9 - a, e = 9 - b, f = 9 - c. Since digits must be between 0 and 9, a, b, c must be between 0 and 9, but since d, e, f = 9 - a, 9 - b, 9 - c must also be digits, a, b, c must be between 0 and 9 as well. However, to ensure d, e, f are digits (0-9), a, b, c must be between 0 and 9. The sum of the two 3-digit numbers formed by the rows is (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999. Substituting d, e, f, this becomes (a + d)*100 + (b + e)*10 + (c + f) = 999, which simplifies to 9*100 + 9*10 + 9 = 999, confirming the sum condition. The sum of the three 2-digit numbers formed by the columns is (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99. Substituting d, e, f, this becomes 10a + (9 - a) + 10b + (9 - b) + 10c + (9 - c) = 9a + 9b + 9c + 27 = 99, which simplifies to a + b + c = 8. Therefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of nonnegative integer solutions (a,b,c) to a + b + c = 8 with 0 ≤ a,b,c ≤ 8. The number of such solutions is the number of combinations with repetition: C(8+3-1,3-1) = C(10,2) = 45. Each such triple (a,b,c) uniquely determines (d,e,f) = (9 - a, 9 - b, 9 - c), so each corresponds to a unique valid digit assignment. Leading zeros are allowed, so no restrictions on a,b,c being zero. There are no duplicates because each triple (a,b,c) corresponds to a unique grid.
