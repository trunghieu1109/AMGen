Question: Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_15_6
proposed answer: We are given that the maximum squared diagonal length of the boxes in the set \( \mathcal{B} \) is \( d^2 = \frac{657}{16} \). The radius \( r \) of the smallest sphere that can contain each box must be at least half the diagonal length, so \( r = \frac{d}{2} \). Squaring both sides, we get \( r^2 = \left( \frac{d}{2} \right)^2 = \frac{d^2}{4} \). Substituting \( d^2 = \frac{657}{16} \), we find \( r^2 = \frac{657}{16} \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{657}{64} \). Next, we verify that the fraction \( \frac{657}{64} \) is in lowest terms. The numerator 657 factors as \( 3^2 \times 73 \), and the denominator 64 is \( 2^6 \). Since there are no common prime factors, the fraction is already in lowest terms. The problem asks for \( p + q \) where \( r^2 = \frac{p}{q} \), so \( p + q = 657 + 64 = 721 \). Therefore, the final answer is 721.
