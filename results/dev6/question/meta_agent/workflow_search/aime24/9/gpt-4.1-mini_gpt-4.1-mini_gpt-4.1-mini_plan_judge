Question: Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: We start with the given probabilities: P(grand prize) = 1/210 and P(prize) = 23/42. The conditional probability P(grand prize | prize) = P(grand prize) / P(prize) = (1/210) / (23/42) = (1/210) * (42/23) = 42 / (210 * 23) = 42 / 4830. Next, simplify 42/4830 by dividing numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor. The GCD of 42 and 4830 is 6. Dividing numerator and denominator by 6 gives 7/805. Since 7 is prime and does not divide 805 (805 = 5 * 7 * 23? Actually, 805 = 5 * 7 * 23, so 7 divides 805), so we need to check carefully. 805 divided by 7 is 115, so 7 divides 805. This means 7/805 can be further simplified. Dividing numerator and denominator by 7 gives 1/115. So the fraction simplifies further to 1/115. Therefore, the simplified fraction is 1/115, not 7/805. Hence, m = 1 and n = 115, and m + n = 116. This contradicts the previous conclusion that the fraction is 7/805. The error was in the simplification step: 805 is divisible by 7, so 7/805 is not in lowest terms. The correct simplification is 1/115. Therefore, the conditional probability in lowest terms is 1/115, and m + n = 116. This matches the alternative answer mentioned in the analysis. Thus, the correct answer is 116, and the fraction 1/115 is in lowest terms because 1 and 115 share no common divisors other than 1. The previous conclusion of 7/805 was incorrect due to missing the factorization of 805. Hence, the verification shows that the conditional probability fraction is 1/115, which is in lowest terms, and m + n = 116 is accurate.
