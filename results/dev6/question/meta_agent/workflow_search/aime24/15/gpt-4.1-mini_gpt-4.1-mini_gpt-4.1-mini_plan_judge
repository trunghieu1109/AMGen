Question: Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.

proposed answer: We are given that all 900 residents own candy hearts (C), and the other three items are diamond ring (D), golf clubs (G), and garden spade (S). We want to find how many residents own all four items (D, G, S, and C). Since candy hearts are universal, the problem reduces to analyzing ownership of D, G, and S. Define variables for the number of residents owning exactly certain combinations of D, G, and S (all with candy hearts): x0 (none of D, G, S), xD (only D), xG (only G), xS (only S), xDG (D and G only), xDS (D and S only), xGS (G and S only), and xDGS (all three D, G, S). Given: total residents = 900; exactly two items owned (including candy hearts) = 437; exactly three items owned (including candy hearts) = 234; total owning D = 195; total owning G = 367; total owning S = 562. Since candy hearts are owned by all, owning exactly two items means candy hearts plus exactly one of D, G, or S, so xD + xG + xS = 437. Owning exactly three items means candy hearts plus exactly two of D, G, S, so xDG + xDS + xGS = 234. Total owning D is xD + xDG + xDS + xDGS = 195; total owning G is xG + xDG + xGS + xDGS = 367; total owning S is xS + xDS + xGS + xDGS = 562. The sum of all groups equals 900: x0 + xD + xG + xS + xDG + xDS + xGS + xDGS = 900. Substitute sums for exactly two and three items: x0 + 437 + 234 + xDGS = 900, so x0 + xDGS = 229. Sum total ownership of D, G, S is 195 + 367 + 562 = 1124. Group terms: (xD + xG + xS) + 2(xDG + xDS + xGS) + 3 xDGS = 1124. Substitute known sums: 437 + 2*234 + 3 xDGS = 1124, which simplifies to 905 + 3 xDGS = 1124, so 3 xDGS = 219, and xDGS = 73. Then x0 = 229 - 73 = 156. All variables are non-negative and sum to 900. Ownership totals check out. Therefore, 73 residents own all four items. This solution is consistent with all given data and constraints, confirming its correctness.
