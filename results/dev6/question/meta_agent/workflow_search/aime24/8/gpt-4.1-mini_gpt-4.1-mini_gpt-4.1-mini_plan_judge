Question: Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.

proposed answer: The problem is a combinatorial game where two players alternately remove either 1 or 4 tokens from a stack of n tokens, with Alice going first. The player who removes the last token wins. We want to find the number of positive integers n ≤ 2024 for which Bob can guarantee a win regardless of Alice's moves. This means the initial position must be losing for the first player (Alice). To solve this, we classify positions as winning or losing for the player to move. A position is losing if all moves lead to winning positions, and winning if there exists a move to a losing position. By analyzing the game states modulo 5, we find a pattern: the losing positions for the first player are those where n mod 5 = 0 or n mod 5 = 2. This is because from these positions, any move (removing 1 or 4 tokens) leads to a winning position for the opponent. To count how many such n ≤ 2024 exist: - Multiples of 5 (n mod 5 = 0): floor(2024/5) = 404 numbers. - Numbers where n mod 5 = 2: these are numbers of the form 5k + 2 with k from 0 to 404, totaling 405 numbers. Summing these gives 404 + 405 = 809. This count matches the classification and satisfies the problem constraints and assumptions (perfect play, allowed moves only if enough tokens remain). Therefore, there are 809 such values of n for which Bob has a guaranteed winning strategy. This reasoning is consistent, verified, and complete.
