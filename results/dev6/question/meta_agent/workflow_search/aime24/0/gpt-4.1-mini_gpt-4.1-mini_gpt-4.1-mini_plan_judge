Question: Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.

proposed answer: Step 1: Recall the given values and conditions. We have s = 2.5 km/h and t = 24 minutes. The distance is 9 km. The total time includes walking time plus coffee shop time t (converted to hours).

Step 2: Verify the first condition (speed s = 2.5 km/h, total time = 4 hours).
- Walking time = 9 / 2.5 = 3.6 hours.
- Coffee shop time = 24 minutes = 24/60 = 0.4 hours.
- Total time = 3.6 + 0.4 = 4.0 hours, which matches the given total time.

Step 3: Verify the second condition (speed s + 2 = 4.5 km/h, total time = 2 hours 24 minutes = 2.4 hours).
- Walking time = 9 / 4.5 = 2 hours.
- Coffee shop time = 0.4 hours.
- Total time = 2 + 0.4 = 2.4 hours, which matches the given total time.

Step 4: Calculate the total time for speed s + 0.5 = 3.0 km/h.
- Walking time = 9 / 3.0 = 3 hours.
- Coffee shop time = 0.4 hours.
- Total time = 3 + 0.4 = 3.4 hours.
- Convert to minutes: 3.4 * 60 = 204 minutes.

Step 5: Check reasonableness.
- The total time decreases as speed increases, which is consistent with expectations.
- The coffee shop time remains constant at 24 minutes.
- The computed total time for s + 0.5 km/h (204 minutes) lies between the total times for s (240 minutes) and s + 2 (144 minutes), which is logical.

Conclusion: The values s = 2.5 km/h and t = 24 minutes satisfy both initial conditions perfectly. The computed total time of 204 minutes for walking at s + 0.5 km/h including the coffee shop stop is consistent, reasonable, and correctly calculated.
