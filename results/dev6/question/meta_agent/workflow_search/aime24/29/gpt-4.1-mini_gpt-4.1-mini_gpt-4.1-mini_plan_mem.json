        "The verification by smaller cases (1x1 and 2x2 grids) and alternative reasoning confirms the correctness of the final count formula Sum_{r=0}^{4} Sum_{c=0}^{4} (6 - r)(6 - c)(2^{10 - r - c} - 2) for the 5x5 grid. The assumptions about contiguous empty rows and columns, color uniformity, and maximality are consistent and necessary, and the formula respects these constraints. Thus, the final count is verified as correct.": "95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval: (0.0%, 0.0%), Median: 0.0%"
