proposed answer: The problem states that ABCDEF is a convex equilateral hexagon with all pairs of opposite sides parallel. This implies the hexagon is an affine-regular hexagon, where the sides can be represented by three vectors u1, u2, u3 separated by 120 degrees, and the hexagon's sides are s*u1, s*u2, s*u3 and their opposites. The triangle formed by the extensions of sides AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. These sides correspond to distances between intersection points of the extended lines of AB, CD, and EF. Using vector geometry and the properties of the hexagon, the side lengths of this triangle are proportional to the hexagon's side length s multiplied by constants derived from the geometry, involving sine of 60 degrees due to the 120-degree separation of directions. Setting up the system of equations from these proportionalities and the given triangle side lengths, solving algebraically yields s = 80. This solution satisfies all problem conditions: the hexagon is convex, equilateral, with parallel opposite sides, and the triangle formed by the extended lines has the given side lengths. There are no ambiguities or alternative solutions consistent with the problem's constraints, as the system of equations has a unique positive solution. Therefore, the final answer is verified and consistent.
