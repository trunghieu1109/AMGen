        "The previously identified number N=9326 does not satisfy the condition that changing any digit to 1 yields a multiple of 7. Therefore, N=9326 is not the greatest such number, and Q+R=335 is not correct. The problem requires a more thorough modular arithmetic solution or exhaustive search to find the correct N. Without the correct N, Q and R cannot be determined, so the final answer cannot be given based on the current data.": "95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval: (0.0%, 0.0%), Median: 0.0%"
