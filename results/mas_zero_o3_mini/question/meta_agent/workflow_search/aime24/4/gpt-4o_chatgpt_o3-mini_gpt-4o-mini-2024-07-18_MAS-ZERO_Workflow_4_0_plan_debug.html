    <pre>Related original question:

Let $p$ be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $n^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$. Find the least positive integer $m$ such that $m^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 1: Identify the least prime number p such that there exists a positive integer n where n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent 8RBS:
We begin by noting that if p divides n^4 + 1 then n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p). For an odd prime p, the existence of an integer n with n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p) forces -1 to be a fourth power residue modulo p. This is possible only when the multiplicative order of n modulo p divides 8, which in turn implies that p must be congruent to 1 modulo 8. Although p = 2 is a prime, a direct check shows that for any integer n, n^4 + 1 ≡ 1 or 2 (mod 4) and hence cannot be 0 modulo 4 (which is 2^2). Thus we can eliminate p = 2. The next candidate in the sequence of primes congruent to 1 modulo 8 is 17. In fact, if we take n = 2 modulo 17, we have 2^4 = 16 and 16 + 1 = 17, demonstrating that 17 divides n^4 + 1. Though this proof only confirms the divisibility by 17, one then considers Hensel&#39;s lemma. Since f(n) = n^4 + 1 has derivative f&#39;(n) = 4n^3 which, for n = 2, is 32 (32 mod 17 = 15, nonzero), the solution can be uniquely lifted to a solution modulo 17^2. Therefore, 17 is the least prime number p for which there exists a positive integer n such that n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2.

### Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1, find the smallest positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2. 

 ### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent 3d19 (yourself):
We already know from Sub-task 1 that p = 17 is the least prime so that there exists an integer n with n^4 + 1 divisible by 17^2. In fact, for n = 2 we have 2^4 + 1 = 16 + 1 = 17 which is divisible by 17; and since f(x) = x^4+1 has derivative 4x^3, and 4*(2^3)=32 which is not divisible by 17, Hensel&#39;s Lemma guarantees that this solution lifts uniquely modulo 17^2 = 289. Our aim now is to find the unique lift; that is, we seek the smallest positive integer m such that m ≡ 2 (mod 17) and m^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 289). We set m = 2 + 17t and look for t with 0 ≤ t &lt; 17 for which m^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 289). Using the binomial expansion: (2 + 17t)^4 = 2^4 + 4·2^3·(17t) + 6·2^2·(17t)^2 + 4·2·(17t)^3 + (17t)^4. Notice that every term involving (17t)^2 or higher is divisible by 17^2 = 289. Thus modulo 289 we have: m^4 ≡ 16 + 4*8*17t = 16 + 544t. Then m^4 + 1 ≡ 16 + 544t + 1 = 17 + 544t (mod 289). We want 17 + 544t ≡ 0 (mod 289). Since 544 = 17*32, the congruence simplifies to 17*(1 + 32t) ≡ 0 (mod 289). Cancelling a factor of 17 (this is valid since 289 = 17^2, so for 17u to be divisible by 17^2, u must be divisible by 17), we get: 1 + 32t ≡ 0 (mod 17). Now, 32 mod 17 is 15, so we need to solve 1 + 15t ≡ 0 (mod 17), which is the same as 15t ≡ -1 (mod 17) or 15t ≡ 16 (mod 17). The inverse of 15 modulo 17 is 8 because 15*8 = 120 ≡ 1 (mod 17); thus, multiplying both sides by 8 gives t ≡ 16*8 = 128 (mod 17). Reducing 128 modulo 17: 128 - 17*7 = 128 - 119 = 9, so t ≡ 9 (mod 17). The smallest nonnegative integer t satisfying this is t = 9. Finally, m = 2 + 17t = 2 + 17*9 = 2 + 153 = 155. Therefore, the smallest positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 17^2 = 289 is 155.

155

### Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1, provide feedback on the current guess for m and correct it if necessary. 

 ### feedback #1 by Critic Agent qbtJ:
The provided guess of m = 155 is correct. Starting with the known solution n = 2 modulo 17 and applying Hensel’s lemma, m is written as 2 + 17t. A binomial expansion shows that modulo 289, m^4 + 1 simplifies to 17 + 544t. This leads to the congruence 1 + 32t ≡ 0 (mod 17), which, after simplification, uniquely yields t = 9. Therefore, m = 2 + 17*9 = 155, confirming the guess.

### Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1, find the smallest positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2. 

 ### thinking #2 by Chain-of-Thought Agent 3d19 (yourself):
We start by noting that from the output of sub-task 1 we have p = 17 and thus p² = 289. A solution modulo 17 is known: n = 2, since 2⁴ + 1 = 16 + 1 = 17, which is divisible by 17. To lift this solution modulo 289 via Hensel’s lemma, we write the general solution as m = 2 + 17t, where t is an integer between 0 and 16. We then look for t such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by 289. Using the binomial expansion, note that the terms containing (17t)² and higher are all divisible by 289, so modulo 289 we only need to consider the first two terms. Therefore, (2 + 17t)⁴ mod 289 simplifies to 2⁴ + 4 × 2³ × 17t = 16 + 544t. Adding 1 gives m⁴ + 1 ≡ 16 + 544t + 1 ≡ 17 + 544t (mod 289). Since 544 can be factored as 17 × 32, we have 17 + 544t = 17(1 + 32t). For this expression to be divisible by 289 (which is 17²), the factor (1 + 32t) must be divisible by 17. That is, we need 1 + 32t ≡ 0 (mod 17). Recognizing that 32 ≡ 15 (mod 17), we rewrite this congruence as 1 + 15t ≡ 0 (mod 17), leading to 15t ≡ 16 (mod 17). The multiplicative inverse of 15 modulo 17 is 8 (since 15 × 8 = 120, which is congruent to 1 modulo 17). Multiplying both sides by 8 yields t ≡ 16 × 8 = 128 (mod 17). Reducing 128 modulo 17, we subtract 17 × 7 = 119 to find 128 − 119 = 9, so t ≡ 9 (mod 17). Thus the smallest such t is 9, and plugging this back into m = 2 + 17t gives m = 2 + 17 × 9 = 155. This verifies that 155 is the smallest positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by 289 (i.e., p²).

### Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1, provide feedback on the current guess for m and correct it if necessary. 

 ### feedback #2 by Critic Agent qbtJ:
The current guess of m = 155 is correct. The process starts with identifying that p = 17 (hence p² = 289) and observing that 2⁴ + 1 = 17, which gives the initial solution n = 2 modulo 17. By setting m = 2 + 17t and expanding (2 + 17t)⁴, only the first two terms are needed modulo 289. This leads to the simplified expression m⁴ + 1 ≡ 17(1 + 32t) (mod 289). To have divisibility by 289, one must have 1 + 32t ≡ 0 (mod 17). Recognizing that 32 ≡ 15 (mod 17), the congruence becomes 1 + 15t ≡ 0 (mod 17), so 15t ≡ 16 (mod 17). Since the multiplicative inverse of 15 modulo 17 is 8, one finds t ≡ 16 × 8 ≡ 128 ≡ 9 (mod 17). Hence, plugging t = 9 into m = 2 + 17t gives m = 2 + 153 = 155. Every step has been carefully checked, confirming that m = 155 is the smallest positive integer that satisfies m⁴ + 1 being divisible by 289.

### Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1, find the smallest positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2. 

 ### thinking #3 by Chain-of-Thought Agent 3d19 (yourself):
We start with the known fact that p = 17 from Sub-task 1, so that p² = 289. Since 2⁴ + 1 = 16 + 1 = 17, we have a solution modulo 17 with n = 2. Using Hensel’s lemma, we look for a unique lift in the form m = 2 + 17t (with 0 ≤ t &lt; 17) to find a solution modulo 289 to m⁴ + 1 ≡ 0. When expanding (2 + 17t)⁴, the higher order terms (those with (17t)² and higher) are automatically divisible by 289. Therefore modulo 289 we have: m⁴ ≡ 2⁴ + 4·2³·(17t) = 16 + 544t. Adding 1, we obtain m⁴ + 1 ≡ 16 + 544t + 1 = 17 + 544t (mod 289). Since 544 = 17 × 32, we can factor this as 17(1 + 32t). For m⁴ + 1 to be divisible by 289 (=17²), the factor (1 + 32t) must be divisible by 17. This translates to the congruence 1 + 32t ≡ 0 (mod 17). Noticing that 32 ≡ 15 (mod 17), we have 1 + 15t ≡ 0 (mod 17), or equivalently 15t ≡ -1 (mod 17). Since -1 is congruent to 16 modulo 17, we solve 15t ≡ 16 (mod 17). The multiplicative inverse of 15 modulo 17 is 8, because 15 × 8 ≡ 120 ≡ 1 (mod 17). Multiplying both sides by 8 gives t ≡ 16 × 8 = 128 (mod 17). Reducing 128 modulo 17, we get 128 - 119 = 9. Thus, t = 9 is the smallest solution. Finally, m = 2 + 17t = 2 + 153 = 155, which is the smallest positive integer satisfying m⁴ + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 289).

### Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1, provide feedback on the current guess for m and correct it if necessary. 

 ### feedback #3 by Critic Agent qbtJ:
The current guess m = 155 is correct. The solution correctly applies Hensel&#39;s lemma by lifting the solution from modulo 17 to modulo 289. By starting with the solution n = 2 modulo 17 and writing m = 2 + 17t, the expansion of m^4 + 1 modulo 289 leads to a linear congruence that gives t = 9. This results in m = 2 + 17*9 = 155, and checking shows that 155^4 + 1 is indeed divisible by 289.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1, find the smallest positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2.

    <pre>We start with p = 17 (from Sub-task 1) so that p² = 289. We know that 2^4 + 1 = 17, providing a solution modulo 17 with n = 2. To lift this solution to modulo 289 using Hensel’s Lemma, we write the general solution as m = 2 + 17t, where t is an integer between 0 and 16. Expanding (2 + 17t)^4, notice that any term involving (17t)^2 or higher is divisible by 289, so modulo 289 we only need to consider the first two terms. Thus, (2 + 17t)^4 is congruent to 2^4 + 4 * 2^3 * (17t) = 16 + 544t modulo 289. Adding 1 gives m^4 + 1 ≡ 16 + 544t + 1 = 17 + 544t (mod 289). Since 544 = 17 * 32, we can factor out 17 to obtain m^4 + 1 ≡ 17 * (1 + 32t) (mod 289). For m^4 + 1 to be divisible by 289, the factor (1 + 32t) must be divisible by 17. Rewriting 32 modulo 17 gives 32 ≡ 15 (mod 17), so the condition becomes 1 + 15t ≡ 0 (mod 17) or equivalently 15t ≡ 16 (mod 17) because -1 modulo 17 is 16. The multiplicative inverse of 15 modulo 17 is 8 (since 15*8 = 120, and 120 ≡ 1 mod 17). Multiplying both sides by 8, we have t ≡ 16 * 8 = 128 (mod 17). Reducing 128 modulo 17 results in 128 - 7*17 = 128 - 119 = 9, so t = 9. Substituting back, m = 2 + 17*9 = 2 + 153 = 155. This step-by-step process confirms that 155 is the smallest positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 289 (i.e., p^2).
