proposed answer: We start with p = 17 (from Sub-task 1) so that p² = 289. We know that 2^4 + 1 = 17, providing a solution modulo 17 with n = 2. To lift this solution to modulo 289 using Hensel’s Lemma, we write the general solution as m = 2 + 17t, where t is an integer between 0 and 16. Expanding (2 + 17t)^4, notice that any term involving (17t)^2 or higher is divisible by 289, so modulo 289 we only need to consider the first two terms. Thus, (2 + 17t)^4 is congruent to 2^4 + 4 * 2^3 * (17t) = 16 + 544t modulo 289. Adding 1 gives m^4 + 1 ≡ 16 + 544t + 1 = 17 + 544t (mod 289). Since 544 = 17 * 32, we can factor out 17 to obtain m^4 + 1 ≡ 17 * (1 + 32t) (mod 289). For m^4 + 1 to be divisible by 289, the factor (1 + 32t) must be divisible by 17. Rewriting 32 modulo 17 gives 32 ≡ 15 (mod 17), so the condition becomes 1 + 15t ≡ 0 (mod 17) or equivalently 15t ≡ 16 (mod 17) because -1 modulo 17 is 16. The multiplicative inverse of 15 modulo 17 is 8 (since 15*8 = 120, and 120 ≡ 1 mod 17). Multiplying both sides by 8, we have t ≡ 16 * 8 = 128 (mod 17). Reducing 128 modulo 17 results in 128 - 7*17 = 128 - 119 = 9, so t = 9. Substituting back, m = 2 + 17*9 = 2 + 153 = 155. This step-by-step process confirms that 155 is the smallest positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 289 (i.e., p^2).
