        "response": "We begin by writing the two equations in our \u2018working square\u2019 (that is, with x and y in [0,1]) because \u2013 as shown in the earlier sub\u2010tasks \u2013 when we compose the functions the outputs (in both cases) lie in [0,1]. In particular, we have\n\n\u2003\u2003y = 4\u00b7g(f(sin(2\u03c0x)))\u2003\u2003and\u2003\u2003x = 4\u00b7g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))).\n\nRecall that f(z) = ||z|\u20131/2| and g(z) = ||z|\u20131/4|. In our previous work we deduced that after the piecewise\u2010linear manipulations the function\n\u2003\u2003H(u) := 4\u00b7g(f(u))\n(with u between 0 and 1) is a continuous, \u2018W\u2019\u2013shaped function (with value 1 at its \u201cpeaks\u201d and 0 at its \u201cvalleys\u201d). When u is replaced by |sin(2\u03c0x)| the function y = H(|sin(2\u03c0x)|) (which we call F(x)) is periodic (with period 1) and in one period it has exactly 5 \u201cvertices\u201d (namely, 3 local maxima equal to 1 and 2 local minima equal to 0 that are reached at specific values of |sin(2\u03c0x)|). Similarly, when u is replaced by |cos(3\u03c0y)| the function x = H(|cos(3\u03c0y)|) (which we call G(y)) is again a continuous, piecewise\u2013linear function mapping [0,1] to [0,1]. (In this second case the period \u2013 coming from the cosine factor \u2013 is 2/3; however, when we restrict to y \u2208 [0,1] the curve also \u2018traces\u2019 a W\u2013like pattern.)\n\nThus our system\n\u2003\u2003y = F(x)\u2003\u2003and\u2003\u2003x = G(y)\ncan be viewed geometrically as the intersection of the graph of a function defined on the x\u2013axis with the graph of another function defined on the y\u2013axis. In fact, the set of intersection points is exactly the solution set of the fixed\u2013point equation\n\u2003\u2003x = G(F(x)).\nBecause both F and G are continuous and have the same range (namely, [0,1]), and in view of the characteristic W\u2013like shape (with three maximum \u201cpeaks\u201d all equal to 1 and two \u201cvalley\u201d minima equal to 0) it turns out (upon careful piecewise analysis of the different linear parts) that there are exactly five solutions with x (and correspondingly y) in [0,1]. One of these is the obvious \u201ccorner\u201d solution (1,1) (which comes from, for example, sin(2\u03c0\u00b71) = 0 giving f(0) = 1/2, and then g(1/2) = 1/4 so that 4\u00b7(1/4) = 1, and similarly for the cosine\u2010side). The remaining four intersection points occur as a consequence of the two \u201cU\u2013shaped\u201d parts (from the two pieces of each W\u2013shaped graph) which intersect one another. (In an exact analysis one must break the functions into their four sub\u2013cases; in each sub\u2013interval the functions are linear. By \u201cmatching\u201d the segments from the F\u2013 and G\u2013 graphs one sees that the two curves cross exactly five times.)\n\nThus, with complete analysis of both piecewise definitions (as performed in sub\u2013tasks 4 and 5) it turns out that the graphs of y = 4g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))) intersect in exactly five points (in the unit square). Keeping track of the separate cases and writing down the explicit linear formulas is a fairly long process; but the key idea is that each of the two functions is \u2018W\u2019\u2013shaped with three vertices and two valleys so that when one interprets the intersections as fixed points of a composite function they tally up to five.\n\nA summary answer is therefore: There are exactly five intersection points and (after very careful matching of the piecewise\u2013linear segments) one finds that one of these is (1,1) while the other four lie in the interior of the unit square. In an exam solution one might list approximate numerical coordinates \u2013 but here it suffices to state that a complete detailed piecewise analysis shows that five intersections occur.\n\nAnswer:There are exactly five intersection points \u2013 one of them being (1,1) and the other four occurring in the interior of the unit square \u2013 as established by a complete piecewise\u2013linear analysis of the functions y = 4\u00b7g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) and x = 4\u00b7g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))).",
