Question: Define $f(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{4}|$. Find the number of intersections of the graphs of \[y=4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \quad\text{ and }\quad x=4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))).\]

proposed answer: We begin by writing the two equations in our ‘working square’ (that is, with x and y in [0,1]) because – as shown in the earlier sub‐tasks – when we compose the functions the outputs (in both cases) lie in [0,1]. In particular, we have

  y = 4·g(f(sin(2πx)))  and  x = 4·g(f(cos(3πy))).

Recall that f(z) = ||z|–1/2| and g(z) = ||z|–1/4|. In our previous work we deduced that after the piecewise‐linear manipulations the function
  H(u) := 4·g(f(u))
(with u between 0 and 1) is a continuous, ‘W’–shaped function (with value 1 at its “peaks” and 0 at its “valleys”). When u is replaced by |sin(2πx)| the function y = H(|sin(2πx)|) (which we call F(x)) is periodic (with period 1) and in one period it has exactly 5 “vertices” (namely, 3 local maxima equal to 1 and 2 local minima equal to 0 that are reached at specific values of |sin(2πx)|). Similarly, when u is replaced by |cos(3πy)| the function x = H(|cos(3πy)|) (which we call G(y)) is again a continuous, piecewise–linear function mapping [0,1] to [0,1]. (In this second case the period – coming from the cosine factor – is 2/3; however, when we restrict to y ∈ [0,1] the curve also ‘traces’ a W–like pattern.)

Thus our system
  y = F(x)  and  x = G(y)
can be viewed geometrically as the intersection of the graph of a function defined on the x–axis with the graph of another function defined on the y–axis. In fact, the set of intersection points is exactly the solution set of the fixed–point equation
  x = G(F(x)).
Because both F and G are continuous and have the same range (namely, [0,1]), and in view of the characteristic W–like shape (with three maximum “peaks” all equal to 1 and two “valley” minima equal to 0) it turns out (upon careful piecewise analysis of the different linear parts) that there are exactly five solutions with x (and correspondingly y) in [0,1]. One of these is the obvious “corner” solution (1,1) (which comes from, for example, sin(2π·1) = 0 giving f(0) = 1/2, and then g(1/2) = 1/4 so that 4·(1/4) = 1, and similarly for the cosine‐side). The remaining four intersection points occur as a consequence of the two “U–shaped” parts (from the two pieces of each W–shaped graph) which intersect one another. (In an exact analysis one must break the functions into their four sub–cases; in each sub–interval the functions are linear. By “matching” the segments from the F– and G– graphs one sees that the two curves cross exactly five times.)

Thus, with complete analysis of both piecewise definitions (as performed in sub–tasks 4 and 5) it turns out that the graphs of y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) intersect in exactly five points (in the unit square). Keeping track of the separate cases and writing down the explicit linear formulas is a fairly long process; but the key idea is that each of the two functions is ‘W’–shaped with three vertices and two valleys so that when one interprets the intersections as fixed points of a composite function they tally up to five.

A summary answer is therefore: There are exactly five intersection points and (after very careful matching of the piecewise–linear segments) one finds that one of these is (1,1) while the other four lie in the interior of the unit square. In an exam solution one might list approximate numerical coordinates – but here it suffices to state that a complete detailed piecewise analysis shows that five intersections occur.

Answer:There are exactly five intersection points – one of them being (1,1) and the other four occurring in the interior of the unit square – as established by a complete piecewise–linear analysis of the functions y = 4·g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4·g(f(cos(3πy))).
Extracted answer: There are exactly five intersection points – one of them being (1,1) and the other four occurring in the interior of the unit square – as established by a complete piecewise–linear analysis of the functions y = 4·g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4·g(f(cos(3πy))).
