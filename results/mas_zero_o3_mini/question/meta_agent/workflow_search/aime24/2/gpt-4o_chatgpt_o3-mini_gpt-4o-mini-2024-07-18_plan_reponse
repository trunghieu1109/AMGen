The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?",

        "response": "We begin with the fraction 109/256. First, we note that 109 is a prime number, so its only factors are 1 and 109. Next, we consider the denominator 256, which is equal to 2^8; hence, its only prime factor is 2. Since 109 does not share the factor 2, there are no common factors between 109 and 256 apart from 1. This confirms that the fraction 109/256 is already in its simplest form. With m = 109 and n = 256, we then compute m+n as 109 + 256 = 365.\n\nAnswer:365",
