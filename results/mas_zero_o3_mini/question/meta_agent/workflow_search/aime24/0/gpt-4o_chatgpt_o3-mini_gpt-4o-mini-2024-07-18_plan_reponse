        "problem": "Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.",

        "n": "MAS-ZERO Workflow 0_Iteration_0",
        "response": "We begin by using the results from the previous parts: Aya\u2019s walking speed at her normal pace is s = 2.5 km/h and her time spent in the coffee shop is t = 24 minutes. To find the time when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h, we first calculate the new walking speed. Adding 0.5 km/h to 2.5 km/h gives us 3 km/h. Since the distance she walks is 9 km, we determine the walking time by dividing the distance by the new speed: 9 km divided by 3 km/h equals 3 hours. Remember that 3 hours is equivalent to 180 minutes. Finally, because this walking time does not include the coffee shop time, we add the fixed break of 24 minutes. Therefore, the total time taken (walking + coffee shop) is 180 minutes + 24 minutes, which equals 204 minutes.\n\nAnswer:204",
