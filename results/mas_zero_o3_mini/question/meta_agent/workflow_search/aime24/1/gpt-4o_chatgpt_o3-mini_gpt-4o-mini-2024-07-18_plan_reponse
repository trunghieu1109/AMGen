        "response": "We begin with the expression AP = (45\u221a5)/44. The competition problem asks for expressing AP as m/n where m and n are relatively prime integers, which refers to the coefficients multiplying the irrational part. By focusing on the rational part, we have m = 45 and n = 44. Since 45 and 44 share no common factors, they are relatively prime. Therefore, m + n = 45 + 44 = 89. This is the rational sum required.\n\nAnswer:89",
