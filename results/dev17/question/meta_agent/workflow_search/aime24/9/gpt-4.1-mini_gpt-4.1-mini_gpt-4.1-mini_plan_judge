Question: Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: We are given that the probability of winning the grand prize (all 4 numbers match) is 1/210, and the probability of winning any prize (at least 2 numbers match) is 23/42. The conditional probability of winning the grand prize given that Jen won a prize is the ratio of these two probabilities: (1/210) / (23/42). To compute this, we multiply 1/210 by the reciprocal of 23/42, which is 42/23. This gives (1/210) * (42/23) = 42 / (210 * 23). Simplifying 42/210 to 1/5, the fraction becomes 1/(5*23) = 1/115. Thus, the simplified fraction for the conditional probability is 1/115, where m=1 and n=115. The problem asks for m + n, which is 1 + 115 = 116.
