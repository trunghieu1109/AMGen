Question: Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.

proposed answer: From Sub-task 8, we derived the expression for BD^2 in terms of the parameter t = tanh(v) as BD^2 = 4 * (44 / (1 - t^2) - 24). The constraint from the rhombus condition and perpendicularity of diagonals gives tanh(u) * tanh(v) = -5/6, which restricts t such that |t| > 5/6 to keep tanh(u) within (-1,1). As |t| approaches 1, BD^2 tends to infinity, but t cannot be exactly ±1 because that would correspond to points at infinity on the hyperbola, which are not valid vertices of the rhombus. At the boundary |t| = 5/6, tanh(u) reaches ±1, which is not allowed, so t must be strictly greater than 5/6 in absolute value. Evaluating BD^2 as t approaches 5/6 from above yields BD^2 approaching 480. Since BD^2 can be made arbitrarily large by choosing t close to ±1, the supremum of BD^2 is infinite. However, the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD^2 for all such rhombi, which means the supremum is approached but never reached. The minimal supremum approached from the domain is 480, which is the greatest real number less than BD^2 for all such rhombi. This conclusion strictly follows from the previous results without introducing new assumptions.
