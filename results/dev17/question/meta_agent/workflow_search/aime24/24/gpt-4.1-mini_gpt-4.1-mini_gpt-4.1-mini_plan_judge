Question: Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations:
\[\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}\]\[\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}\]\[\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}\]
Then the value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: We are given the system of logarithmic equations involving x, y, and z, and we want to find the absolute value of log2(x^4 y^3 z^2) in simplest fractional form m/n, then find m+n. From previous steps, we set a = log2(x), b = log2(y), c = log2(z). The system translates to linear equations: a - b - c = 1/2, b - a - c = 1/3, c - a - b = 1/4. Adding all three gives - (a + b + c) = 13/12, so a + b + c = -13/12. Solving the system yields a = -7/24, b = -3/8, c = -5/12. Then, log2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = 4a + 3b + 2c = 4*(-7/24) + 3*(-3/8) + 2*(-5/12) = -7/6 - 9/8 - 5/6. Combine -7/6 and -5/6 = -12/6 = -2. So sum is -2 - 9/8 = -16/8 - 9/8 = -25/8. The absolute value is 25/8. Since 25 and 8 are coprime, m=25, n=8, so m+n=33. This matches all previous consistent calculations and is the simplest form. Therefore, the final answer is 33.
