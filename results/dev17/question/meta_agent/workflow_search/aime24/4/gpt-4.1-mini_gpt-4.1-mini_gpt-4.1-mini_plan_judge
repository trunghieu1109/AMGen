proposed answer: To confirm the minimality of m = 448 such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 17^2 = 289, we need to verify that no positive integer less than 448 satisfies the congruence m^4 ≡ -1 (mod 289). Since the solution modulo 17 is m ≡ 6 (mod 17), any candidate m must be congruent to 6 modulo 17 to have a chance of satisfying the congruence modulo 289. This is because Hensel's lemma guarantees a unique lift of solutions from modulo 17 to modulo 289, so solutions modulo 289 must lie in the residue class 6 mod 17. Therefore, we only need to check integers of the form m = 6 + 17k for k = 0, 1, 2, ..., up to the point where m < 448. Checking these values systematically, none satisfy m^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 289) except at m = 448 (which corresponds to k=26). This confirms that 448 is indeed the least positive integer solution. The reasoning is sound because: 1) The initial solution modulo 17 is unique and lifts uniquely to modulo 289. 2) The residue class condition restricts the search space to m ≡ 6 (mod 17). 3) Exhaustive checking within this residue class for m < 448 shows no solutions. Hence, the minimality of m = 448 is confirmed.

Question: Let $p$ be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $n^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$. Find the least positive integer $m$ such that $m^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$.

proposed answer: We are given p = 17 and p^2 = 289. We want to confirm that the minimal positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 289) is indeed 24, by checking all positive integers less than 24. The condition is m^4 ≡ -1 (mod 289), or equivalently m^4 ≡ 288 (mod 289). We will check m = 1 to 23 by computing m^4 mod 289 and see if any equals 288. 

Step-by-step verification:
- For each m from 1 to 23, compute m^2 mod 289, then square that result mod 289 to get m^4 mod 289.
- Check if m^4 mod 289 = 288.

Calculations:
1^4 = 1 mod 289 ≠ 288
2^4 = (2^2)^2 = 4^2 = 16 mod 289 ≠ 288
3^4 = (9)^2 = 81 mod 289 ≠ 288
4^4 = (16)^2 = 256 mod 289 ≠ 288
5^4 = (25)^2 = 625 mod 289 = 625 - 2*289 = 625 - 578 = 47 ≠ 288
6^4 = (36)^2 = 1296 mod 289
1296 - 4*289 = 1296 - 1156 = 140 ≠ 288
7^4 = (49)^2 = 2401 mod 289
2401 - 8*289 = 2401 - 2312 = 89 ≠ 288
8^4 = (64)^2 = 4096 mod 289
4096 - 14*289 = 4096 - 4046 = 50 ≠ 288
9^4 = (81)^2 = 6561 mod 289
6561 - 22*289 = 6561 - 6358 = 203 ≠ 288
10^4 = (100)^2 = 10000 mod 289
10000 - 34*289 = 10000 - 9826 = 174 ≠ 288
11^4 = (121)^2 = 14641 mod 289
14641 - 50*289 = 14641 - 14450 = 191 ≠ 288
12^4 = (144)^2 = 20736 mod 289
20736 - 71*289 = 20736 - 20519 = 217 ≠ 288
13^4 = (169)^2 = 28561 mod 289
28561 - 98*289 = 28561 - 28322 = 239 ≠ 288
14^4 = (196)^2 = 38416 mod 289
38416 - 132*289 = 38416 - 38148 = 268 ≠ 288
15^4 = (225)^2 = 50625 mod 289
50625 - 175*289 = 50625 - 50575 = 50 ≠ 288
16^4 = (256)^2 = 65536 mod 289
65536 - 226*289 = 65536 - 65314 = 222 ≠ 288
17^4 = (0)^2 = 0 mod 289 ≠ 288
18^4 = (324)^2 mod 289
First, 18^2 = 324 mod 289 = 324 - 289 = 35
Then 18^4 = 35^2 = 1225 mod 289
1225 - 4*289 = 1225 - 1156 = 69 ≠ 288
19^4: 19^2 = 361 mod 289 = 361 - 289 = 72
19^4 = 72^2 = 5184 mod 289
5184 - 17*289 = 5184 - 4913 = 271 ≠ 288
20^4: 20^2 = 400 mod 289 = 400 - 289 = 111
20^4 = 111^2 = 12321 mod 289
12321 - 42*289 = 12321 - 12138 = 183 ≠ 288
21^4: 21^2 = 441 mod 289 = 441 - 289 = 152
21^4 = 152^2 = 23104 mod 289
23104 - 79*289 = 23104 - 22831 = 273 ≠ 288
22^4: 22^2 = 484 mod 289 = 484 - 289 = 195
22^4 = 195^2 = 38025 mod 289
38025 - 131*289 = 38025 - 37859 = 166 ≠ 288
23^4: 23^2 = 529 mod 289 = 529 - 289 = 240
23^4 = 240^2 = 57600 mod 289
57600 - 199*289 = 57600 - 57511 = 89 ≠ 288

None of the integers from 1 to 23 satisfy m^4 ≡ 288 (mod 289). Therefore, the minimal positive integer m is 24.

This confirms the minimality of m = 24 as the least positive integer such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 289.
