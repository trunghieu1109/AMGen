Question: Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_18_0
proposed answer: From the previous sub-tasks, we have found that the walking speed s is 2.5 km/h and the coffee break time t is 24 minutes. We need to find the total time (walking plus coffee break) in minutes when Aya walks at speed s + 0.5 km/h, which is 2.5 + 0.5 = 3.0 km/h. The walking distance is fixed at 9 km. The walking time at 3.0 km/h is distance/speed = 9 / 3.0 = 3 hours. The coffee break time t is 24 minutes, which is 24/60 = 0.4 hours. The total time in hours is walking time + coffee break time = 3 + 0.4 = 3.4 hours. Converting this total time to minutes: 3.4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 204 minutes. Therefore, the total time including the coffee break when walking at 3.0 km/h is 204 minutes.
