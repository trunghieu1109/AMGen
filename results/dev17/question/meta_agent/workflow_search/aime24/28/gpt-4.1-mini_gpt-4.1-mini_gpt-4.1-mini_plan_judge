Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: The problem states that the difference r_i - r_o can be expressed as a fraction m/n in lowest terms, and we need to find m + n. From the previous analysis and final verified expression, the difference r_i - r_o was found to be 3/2. This fraction is already in lowest terms since 3 and 2 share no common divisors other than 1. Therefore, m = 3 and n = 2. The sum m + n is 3 + 2 = 5. This conclusion is consistent with the geometric reasoning and algebraic derivation provided earlier, confirming that the fraction is simplified and the sum is correctly computed.

proposed answer: The fraction given is -336/65. We are asked to find the difference r_i - r_o = m/n in lowest terms and then compute m + n. First, note that the fraction is negative, but the problem asks for m and n as positive integers, so we consider the absolute value 336/65. To simplify 336/65, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 336 and 65. The prime factors of 336 are 2^4 * 3 * 7, and 65 factors as 5 * 13. Since there are no common prime factors, the GCD is 1, so the fraction is already in lowest terms. Therefore, m = 336 and n = 65. The sum m + n = 336 + 65 = 401. This confirms the fraction is simplified correctly and the sum is computed accurately. Hence, the final answer is 401.
