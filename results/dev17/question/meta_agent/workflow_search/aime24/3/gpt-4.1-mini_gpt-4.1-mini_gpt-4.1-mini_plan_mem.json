        "The 25 intersection points identified in subtask 11 are unique and valid within the fundamental domain [0,1) \u00d7 [0,2/3). There is no double counting because each solution arises from a unique pair of linear segments of Y and X, and the domain covers exactly one period of the functions. The piecewise linear structure and monotonicity on each segment ensure at most one solution per segment pair, confirming the multiplicity is one for each intersection point. Hence, all solutions are distinct, valid, and completely enumerated.": "95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval: (0.0%, 0.0%), Median: 0.0%"
