Question: Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?

proposed answer: The problem involves finding the probability that a random coloring of the vertices of a regular octagon (each vertex independently colored red or blue with equal probability) can be rotated so that all blue vertices map onto originally red vertices. The total number of colorings is 2^8 = 256. By analyzing the rotations (elements of the cyclic group of order 8) and using combinatorial arguments and inclusion-exclusion principle, the number of favorable colorings is found to be 121. Since 121 and 256 are relatively prime (121 = 11^2 and 256 = 2^8), the fraction 121/256 is in lowest terms. Therefore, m = 121 and n = 256, and the sum m + n = 377.

proposed answer: From the previous sub-task 7, the probability that the octagon can be rotated so that all blue vertices map onto originally red vertices is given as 73/256. This fraction is already in simplest form because 73 is a prime number and does not share any common factors with 256 (which is 2^8). Therefore, m = 73 and n = 256. The problem asks for the sum m + n, which is 73 + 256 = 329. This is the final answer for sub-task 8.
