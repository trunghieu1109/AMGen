Question: Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.

proposed answer: We are given the volume V = sqrt(457) and the total surface area S = 110 from previous sub-tasks. The inradius r of a tetrahedron is given by the formula r = 3V / S. Substituting the values, we get r = 3 * sqrt(457) / 110. We need to express this in the form (m * sqrt(n)) / p, where m, n, p are positive integers, m and p are coprime, and n is square-free. Here, m = 3, n = 457, and p = 110. Since 457 is a prime number, it is square-free. Also, 3 and 110 share no common factors other than 1, so they are coprime. Therefore, the inradius is r = (3 * sqrt(457)) / 110. The problem asks for m + n + p, which is 3 + 457 + 110 = 570.

proposed answer: The inradius r of a tetrahedron is given by the formula r = 3V / S, where V is the volume of the tetrahedron and S is the total surface area. From the problem and previous analysis, the volume V was found to be sqrt(457), and the total surface area S was found to be 40. This leads to r = 3 * sqrt(457) / 40. 

We need to express r in the form (m * sqrt(n)) / p, where m, n, p are positive integers, m and p are coprime, and n is square-free. Here, m = 3, n = 457, and p = 40. 

Check if 457 is square-free: 457 is a prime number, so it is square-free. 

Check if m and p are coprime: gcd(3, 40) = 1, so they are coprime. 

Thus, the expression r = (3 * sqrt(457)) / 40 meets all the conditions. 

Finally, compute m + n + p = 3 + 457 + 40 = 500. 

This is the simplest and correct form of the inradius, satisfying all the problem's requirements.
