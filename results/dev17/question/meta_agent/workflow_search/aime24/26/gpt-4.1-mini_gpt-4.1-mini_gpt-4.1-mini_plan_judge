Question: Alice chooses a set $A$ of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets $B$ of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of $B$ belongs to $A$. Bob's list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_3_26
proposed answer: From the previous sub-task, we found that the set A corresponding to the decomposition of 2024 into sums of powers of two of the form 2^(a-1) is A = {4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11}. This was derived by converting 2024 to binary and identifying the positions of the bits set to 1, then mapping those bit positions to elements of A by adding 1 to each bit position. The sum of the elements of A is simply the sum of these integers: 4 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11. Calculating this sum step-by-step: 4 + 6 = 10, 10 + 7 = 17, 17 + 8 = 25, 25 + 9 = 34, 34 + 10 = 44, 44 + 11 = 55. Therefore, the sum of the elements of A is 55. This sum is the final answer to the problem, as it directly answers the question asked after the decomposition was found.
