Question: Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.

proposed answer: We are given a set of rectangular boxes with edges x, y, z > 0, satisfying two constraints: surface area 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 and volume xyz = 23. The radius r of the smallest sphere containing the box is half the space diagonal, so r^2 = (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)/4. To find r^2, we need to maximize x^2 + y^2 + z^2 under the given constraints. 

Assuming symmetry x = y = a and z = b, the constraints become:
- Surface area: 2(a^2 + 2ab) = 54 => a^2 + 2ab = 27
- Volume: a^2 b = 23 => b = 23 / a^2

Substituting b into the surface area equation:
a^2 + 2a * (23 / a^2) = 27
=> a^2 + 46 / a = 27
=> Multiply both sides by a:
a^3 - 27a + 46 = 0

Testing roots, a=2 is a root. Factoring gives (a-2)(a^2 + 2a - 23) = 0. The quadratic roots are -1 ± 2√6, positive root approx 3.898.

Calculate sum of squares for both roots:
- For a=2, b=23/4=5.75, sum = 2*(2^2) + (5.75)^2 = 8 + 33.0625 = 41.0625
- For a≈3.898, b≈1.514, sum ≈ 2*(15.19) + 2.29 = 32.67

Maximum sum of squares is 41.0625 at a=2, b=5.75.

Expressing exactly:
Sum of squares = 2*a^2 + b^2 = 2*4 + (23/4)^2 = 8 + 529/16 = (128/16) + (529/16) = 657/16.

Therefore, r^2 = (1/4) * (657/16) = 657/64.

Since 657 and 64 share no common factors, the fraction is in lowest terms.

Hence, p = 657, q = 64, and p + q = 721.
