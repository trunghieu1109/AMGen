The problem is to maximize the sum of squares of the edges of the box, f(x,y,z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2, subject to two constraints: the surface area constraint g(x,y,z) = 2(xy + yz + zx) - 54 = 0 and the volume constraint h(x,y,z) = xyz - 23 = 0, with the positivity constraints x, y, z > 0. The standard and appropriate method to solve such a constrained optimization problem with two equality constraints is to use Lagrange multipliers. Introducing two multipliers λ and μ, the Lagrangian function is L(x,y,z,λ,μ) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - λ[2(xy + yz + zx) - 54] - μ(xyz - 23). Taking partial derivatives with respect to x, y, and z and setting them to zero yields three equations. Together with the two original constraints, this forms a system of five equations in five unknowns (x, y, z, λ, μ). This system can be solved to find the critical points that maximize the sum of squares under the given constraints. The positivity constraints are natural since the edges represent lengths of a box.
