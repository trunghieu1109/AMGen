Question: Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.

proposed answer: To determine the number of positive integers n ≤ 2024 for which Bob can guarantee a win regardless of Alice's moves, we analyze the game states based on the number of tokens modulo 5. The game allows removing either 1 or 4 tokens per turn, and the last to remove a token wins. By examining the positions, we find that the losing positions for the player to move are those where n mod 5 equals 0 or 2. Since Alice moves first, if the initial n satisfies n mod 5 = 0 or 2, Alice starts in a losing position, meaning Bob can force a win no matter what Alice does. To count these n, we calculate the number of integers ≤ 2024 with n mod 5 = 0 and n mod 5 = 2. The count of multiples of 5 up to 2024 is floor(2024/5) = 404. For n mod 5 = 2, numbers are of the form 5k + 2 with k from 0 to 404, giving 405 numbers. Adding these gives 404 + 405 = 809. Therefore, there are 809 such integers. This reasoning is based on the fundamental combinatorial game theory concept of winning and losing positions and the modular pattern arising from the allowed moves. The key insight is that the losing positions repeat every 5 tokens, and identifying these positions allows us to count the favorable initial states for Bob.
