Question: Find the largest possible real part of \[(75+117i)z+\frac{96+144i}{z}\]where $z$ is a complex number with $|z|=4$.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_12
proposed answer: From the previous sub-task, we have expressed the real part of the given expression as R cos(θ - α), where R = 540 and α ≈ -0.927 radians. Since cosine function has a maximum value of 1, the maximum value of R cos(θ - α) over θ is simply R * 1 = 540. This maximum is attained when θ = α, i.e., when θ = -0.927 radians. Therefore, the largest possible real part of the original expression is 540. This conclusion is consistent with the properties of the cosine function and the trigonometric form derived earlier. No other constraints affect this maximum, and the modulus condition |z|=4 was already incorporated in the derivation of R and α. Hence, the maximum real part is 540.
