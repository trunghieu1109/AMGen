Question: Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.
[asy] size(10cm); usepackage("tikz");label("\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(2,0)--(2,3)--(5,3)--(5,8)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}",origin); label("\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(0,3)--(3,3)--(3,5)--(8,5)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}",E); [/asy]

proposed answer: We have two valid patterns for the paths with exactly four direction changes: starting horizontal (H-V-H-V-H) and starting vertical (V-H-V-H-V). For each pattern, we calculated the number of valid segment length assignments. For the starting horizontal pattern, the number of ways to compose 8 into 3 positive parts (horizontal segments) is C(7,2) = 21, and the number of ways to compose 8 into 2 positive parts (vertical segments) is C(7,1) = 7, giving 21 * 7 = 147 ways. For the starting vertical pattern, the number of ways to compose 8 into 2 positive parts (horizontal segments) is C(7,1) = 7, and the number of ways to compose 8 into 3 positive parts (vertical segments) is C(7,2) = 21, giving 7 * 21 = 147 ways. Since each segment is monotone, the arrangement within each segment is fixed, so the total number of paths for each pattern equals the number of valid segment length assignments. Summing these counts from both patterns, we get 147 + 147 = 294. Therefore, the total number of lattice paths from (0,0) to (8,8) with exactly four direction changes is 294.
