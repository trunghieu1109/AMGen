Question: Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.

Without these values, it is impossible to determine the total time accurately.\n\n### thinking #2 by Debate Agent x0rN:\nTo answer the sub-task regarding the total time for Aya walking at speed s + 0.5 km/h, I recognize that the necessary values of s and t have not been provided. Without these specific values, I cannot accurately calculate the total time for the walk. This lack of information makes it impossible to derive a correct numerical answer based on the given scenario.\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Based on the output of sub-task 3, convert the total time including time in coffee shop into minutes and calculate the final answer.\n\nIf the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the "answer" entry (for example, 300\n[TOO_HARD]\nSuggestion:...) and justify why you think so in the "thinking" entry'}], sub_tasks=None, agents='CoT agent {cot_agent.id}, determining speed s, thinking: {thinking1.content}; answer: {answer1.content}\nCoT-SC agent {cot_agents[i].id}, computing time t, thinking: {thinking2.content}; answer: {answer2.content}\nCoT-SC agent {cot_agents[i].id}, computing time t, thinking: {thinking2.content}; answer: {answer2.content}\nCoT-SC agent {cot_agents[i].id}, computing time t, thinking: {thinking2.content}; answer: {answer2.content}\nReflexion CoT agent {cot_agent.id}, calculating total time, thinking: {thinking3.content}; answer: {answer3.content}\nCritic agent {critic_agent.id}, providing feedback, thinking: {feedback.content}; answer: {correct.content}\nReflexion CoT agent {cot_agent.id}, refining total time calculation, thinking: {thinking3.content}; answer: {answer3.content}\nCritic agent {critic_agent.id}, providing feedback, thinking: {feedback.content}; answer: {correct.content}\nReflexion CoT agent {cot_agent.id}, refining total time calculation, thinking: {thinking3.content}; answer: {answer3.content}\nCritic agent {critic_agent.id}, providing feedback, thinking: {feedback.content}; answer: {correct.content}\nReflexion CoT agent {cot_agent.id}, refining total time calculation, thinking: {thinking3.content}; answer: {answer3.content}\nDebate agent {agent.id}, round {r}, converting total time into minutes, thinking: {thinking4.content}; answer: {answer4.content}\nDebate agent {agent.id}, round {r}, converting total time into minutes, thinking: {thinking4.content}; answer: {answer4.content}\nDebate agent {agent.id}, round {r}, converting total time into minutes, thinking: {thinking4.content}; answer: {answer4.content}\nDebate agent {agent.id}, round {r}, converting total time into minutes, thinking: {thinking4.content}; answer: {answer4.content}\nDebate agent {agent.id}, round {r}, converting total time into minutes, thinking: {thinking4.content}; answer: {answer4.content}\nDebate agent {agent.id}, round {r}, converting total time into minutes, thinking: {thinking4.content}; answer: {answer4.content}', iteration_idx=2)]
