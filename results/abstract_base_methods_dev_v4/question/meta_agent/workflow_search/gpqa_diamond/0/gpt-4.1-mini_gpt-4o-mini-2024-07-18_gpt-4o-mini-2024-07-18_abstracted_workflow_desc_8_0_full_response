The reduced Planck's constant (ħ) is approximately 6.582119569e-16 eV·s. For the first state with a lifetime τ1 = 10^-9 s, we have: ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1 = (6.582119569e-16 eV·s) / (10^-9 s) = 6.582119569e-7 eV. For the second state with a lifetime τ2 = 10^-8 s, we compute: ΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2 = (6.582119569e-16 eV·s) / (10^-8 s) = 6.582119569e-8 eV. The energy uncertainties for the two states are ΔE1 ≈ 6.58e-7 eV and ΔE2 ≈ 6.58e-8 eV. To clearly distinguish between the two energy levels, the energy difference (ΔE) must be greater than the larger of these uncertainties, which is ΔE1 ≈ 6.58e-7 eV.
