Question: Example(question='Two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10^-9 sec and 10^-8 sec, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which one of the following options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?\n', choice1='10^-9 eV', choice2='10^-11 eV', choice3='10^-8 eV\n', choice4='10^-4 eV', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: To clearly distinguish between the two quantum states, the energy difference must exceed the larger energy uncertainty calculated, which is approximately 6.58e-7 eV. The provided options for the energy difference are 10^-9 eV, 10^-11 eV, 10^-8 eV, and 10^-4 eV. Among these, 10^-4 eV is the only option that exceeds the calculated uncertainty of 6.58e-7 eV. The other options (10^-9 eV, 10^-11 eV, and 10^-8 eV) are all significantly smaller than the required energy difference, thus they would not allow for a clear resolution of the two states. Therefore, 10^-4 eV is the only viable option for distinguishing the two energy levels.
