Question: Example(question='Calculate the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator $\\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\\hbar/2$. Given the $X-$component, $P_x$ of the operator $P$ as $\\hbar/2$ times a 2 by 2 square matrix having elements in the first row as $(0 1)$, and that in the second row as $(1, 0)$. The $Y-$component, $P_y$ of the operator is given by the product of $\\hbar/2$ and a 2 by 2 square matrix having elements in the first row as $(0, -i)$, and that in the second row as $(i, 0)$. Finally, the $Z-$component, $P_z$ of the operator is given by the product of $\\hbar/2$  and another 2 by 2 square matrix having elements in the first row as $(1, 0)$, and that in the second row as $(0, -1)$.  What are the elements of the normalized eigenvector? \n', choice1='(\\cos(\\theta), e^{i\\phi}\\sin (\\theta))\u2028', choice2='(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar, \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar)', choice3='(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin (\\theta/2))\n', choice4='(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar \\cos(\\theta/2), \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar \\sin (\\theta/2))', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: The normalized eigenvector obtained from the previous sub-task is (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)). I need to compare this with the provided multiple-choice options. The first option (cos(θ), e^{iφ}sin(θ)) does not match because it contains a phase factor and has a different form. The second option (√(2/3)ħ, √(1/3)ħ) does not match because it includes factors of ħ and does not resemble the normalized eigenvector. The third option (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)) matches exactly with our normalized eigenvector. The fourth option (√(2/3)ħ cos(θ/2), √(1/3)ħ sin(θ/2)) does not match as it also includes ħ factors and does not represent the normalized form. Therefore, the correct choice is the third option, which is the normalized eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2 along the direction in the x-z plane.
