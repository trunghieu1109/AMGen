The norm is calculated as ||v|| = sqrt(v_1^2 + v_2^2). Substituting the components, we have: ||v|| = sqrt(cos^2(θ/2) + sin^2(θ/2)). By the Pythagorean identity, we know that cos^2(θ/2) + sin^2(θ/2) = 1. Therefore, the norm ||v|| = sqrt(1) = 1, confirming that the vector is already normalized.

The operator P_n is defined as P_n = P_x * sin(theta) + P_y * 0 + P_z * cos(theta). Since P_y is multiplied by 0, it will not contribute to the final operator. We will evaluate P_x and P_z separately. The matrix for P_x is given as (\\hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]], and the matrix for P_z is given as (\\hbar/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]].

The operator P_n is given by P_n = (ħ/2) * [[cos(θ), sin(θ)], [sin(θ), -cos(θ)]]. Denoting the eigenvector |v> as (v_1, v_2), we can express the eigenvalue equation as: (ħ/2) * [[cos(θ), sin(θ)], [sin(θ), -cos(θ)]] * [v_1, v_2] = (+ħ/2) * [v_1, v_2]. This leads to two equations: (cos(θ)v_1 + sin(θ)v_2) = v_1 and (sin(θ)v_1 - cos(θ)v_2) = v_2. Rearranging these equations allows us to solve for v_1 and v_2, leading to the conclusion that the normalized eigenvector can be expressed as (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)).

In this case, the angle theta represents the angle from the z-axis. The x-component is given by sin(theta) and the z-component is given by cos(theta), while the y-component is zero since the vector lies in the x-z plane. Therefore, the direction vector can be expressed as (sin(theta), 0, cos(theta)).\\n\\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent rU4K:\\n(sin(theta), 0, cos(theta))\\n\\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 2: Construct the operator P_n = \\x0becP \\\\cdot \\x0becn = P_x sin\\theta + P_y * 0 + P_z cos\\theta using the given matrices for P_x, P_y, and P_z.

The operator P_n is given by P_n = (ħ/2) * [[cos(θ), sin(θ)], [sin(θ), -cos(θ)]].
