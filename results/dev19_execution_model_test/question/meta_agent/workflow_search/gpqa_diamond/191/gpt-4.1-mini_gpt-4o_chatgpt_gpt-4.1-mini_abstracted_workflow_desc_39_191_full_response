The charge induces a -q charge on the inner surface of the cavity and a +q charge on the outer surface of the conductor. For a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field inside the conductor\'s material is zero, and the field outside is equivalent to that of a point charge located at the center of the conductor. This is due to the spherical symmetry of the conductor, which ensures that the field outside depends only on the net charge and the distance from the center. The distances s, l, and the angle θ are internal parameters that do not affect the field at point P, which is outside the conductor. The field at P is determined by the effective central charge +q and the distance L from the center of the conductor to P. Therefore, the correct expression for the electric field at P is that of a point charge at distance L.

The inner surface will have a charge of -q to exactly cancel the electric field inside the conductor material, ensuring the conductor remains an equipotential. The outer surface of the conductor will have an induced charge of +q to maintain the overall neutrality of the conductor. Due to the spherical symmetry and the properties of conductors, the electric field outside the conductor depends only on the net charge enclosed within the conductor. The induced charges on the inner and outer surfaces do not affect the electric field at point P outside the conductor, which can be treated as if the entire charge +q is concentrated at the center of the conductor. Therefore, the electric field at point P is determined by the distance from the center of the conductor to P, which is L. The angle θ and the displacement s do not affect the field at P since the conductor's outer surface shields any internal asymmetry from affecting the field outside.

Due to the conductor being uncharged overall, an equal positive charge +q will appear on the outer surface of the conductor.

The conductor's outer surface behaves as if it is a shell carrying a charge +q at its center. Therefore, the electric field at a point P outside the conductor, at a distance L from the center of the spherical conductor, is determined by the effective charge +q at the center of the conductor. The distance L is the relevant distance for calculating the field, not the distance l from the cavity center.

This results in induced charges on the surfaces of the cavity and the outer surface of the conductor. The charge +q will induce a negative charge of -q on the inner surface of the cavity, directly opposite to its location, to ensure the electric field inside the conductor's material remains zero. Simultaneously, a positive charge of +q will appear on the outer surface of the conductor, ensuring the entire system remains electrically neutral. Outside the conductor, the electric field behaves as if the entire charge +q is located at the center of the conductor, due to the spherical symmetry and the conductor's shielding effect. This is a result of the conductor acting as a Faraday cage, where the field outside only depends on the total enclosed charge, not its specific distribution within the cavity. Hence, the electric field at point P, which is outside the conductor, will be equivalent to that produced by a point charge +q located at the center of the spherical conductor. Thus, the correct expression for the electric field at point P, at a distance l from the center of the cavity, is given by Coulomb's law for a point charge located at the center of the conductor, leading to choice C) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$.

The charge +q induces a charge of -q on the inner surface of the cavity, ensuring the electric field inside the conductor's material is zero, and a charge of +q on the outer surface of the conductor to maintain overall neutrality. The key insight is that the electric field outside the conductor is equivalent to that of a point charge +q located at the center of the conductor. This occurs because the spherical conductor redistributes the charge such that the electric field outside is spherically symmetric and appears as if the entire charge were concentrated at the center. Consequently, the electric field at point P, which is outside the conductor, depends only on the effective charge +q at the center of the conductor and the distance L from P to the center of the conductor. The parameters s, l, and θ, which describe the relative positions of the charge inside the cavity and the angle, do not affect the electric field at P because they are internal to the conductor.

The conductor redistributes charges to maintain an electrostatic equilibrium. The charge +q induces a charge of -q on the inner surface of the cavity, ensuring that the electric field inside the conductor's material is zero. This is a result of the conductor's property to shield its interior from external electric fields. To maintain overall neutrality of the conductor, a charge of +q is induced on the outer surface of the conductor. The key point is that the electric field outside the conductor is determined by the net charge on the conductor, which is +q. Due to the spherical symmetry of the conductor, the electric field outside is equivalent to that of a point charge +q located at the center of the conductor. This is a consequence of Gauss's law and the symmetry of the problem. The displacement s and the angle θ are relevant to the internal configuration of the cavity and the initial placement of the charge, but they do not alter the field outside the conductor. The field at a point outside the conductor depends solely on the distance from the center of the conductor, which is L in this case. Therefore, the electric field at point P is given by the expression for a point charge at distance L, which is $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$. This corresponds to choice D.; answer: D)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent xcMZ, applying electrostatic principles, thinking: When a charge +q is placed inside the cavity of an uncharged spherical conductor, it induces a charge of -q on the inner surface of the cavity to ensure the electric field inside the conductor's material is zero. This is due to electrostatic induction. Consequently, a charge of +q is induced on the outer surface of the conductor to maintain overall neutrality. The electric field outside the conductor is equivalent to that of a point charge +q located at the center of the conductor. This is because the conductor's surface redistributes the charge such that the field outside is as if the entire charge were concentrated at the center. The distance from point P to the center of the conductor is L, and since P is outside, the electric field at P is determined by this effective central charge. The angle θ and the displacement s are irrelevant for calculating the field at P, as the outer field is spherically symmetric.

The charge induces a -q charge on the inner surface of the cavity and a +q charge on the outer surface of the conductor. For a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field inside the conductor's material is zero, and the field outside is equivalent to that of a point charge located at the center of the conductor. This is due to the spherical symmetry of the conductor, which ensures that the field outside depends only on the net charge and the distance from the center. The distances s, l, and the angle θ are internal parameters that do not affect the field at point P, which is outside the conductor. The field at P is determined by the effective central charge +q and the distance L from the center of the conductor to P.

The conductor itself is uncharged. The key concept here is the electrostatic shielding effect of the conductor. When a charge is placed inside the cavity, it induces a charge of -q on the inner surface of the cavity and +q on the outer surface of the conductor to maintain overall neutrality. Due to the spherical symmetry of the conductor, the electric field outside the conductor is equivalent to the field produced by a point charge +q located at the center of the conductor. This is because the induced charges redistribute such that the field outside the conductor is as if the entire charge were concentrated at the center. Therefore, the electric field at point P, located at a distance L from the center of the conductor, is determined solely by this effective central charge. The internal configuration parameters s, l, and θ do not affect the field at P because the field outside is spherically symmetric.

The key point is that the conductor is uncharged, which means it will redistribute the charge to maintain electrostatic equilibrium. When the charge +q is placed inside the cavity, it induces a charge of -q on the inner surface of the cavity and a charge of +q on the outer surface of the conductor to ensure the electric field inside the conductor's material is zero. The spherical symmetry of the conductor ensures that the electric field outside the conductor is as if the entire charge +q were concentrated at the center of the conductor. This is due to the shielding effect and the fact that the field outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution is equivalent to that of a point charge located at the center of the sphere. Therefore, the electric field at point P, which is outside the conductor, depends only on the net charge and the distance from the center of the conductor to point P, which is L. The angle θ and the displacement s are irrelevant for calculating the field at P because the outer field is spherically symmetric.
