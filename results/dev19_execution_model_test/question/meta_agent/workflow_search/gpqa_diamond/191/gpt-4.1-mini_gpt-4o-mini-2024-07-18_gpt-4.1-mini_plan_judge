proposed answer: To determine the electric field at point P outside the spherical conductor, we analyze the configuration of the system. We have an uncharged spherical conductor with a radius R, containing a cavity of radius r (where r < R) that holds a positive charge +q. The center of the cavity is displaced from the center of the conductor by a distance s. The point P, where we want to find the electric field, is located outside the conductor at a distance L from the center of the conductor (with L > R), and the distance from point P to the center of the cavity is l (with l > R). The angle θ is defined between the vectors l (from the cavity center to point P) and s (from the conductor center to the cavity center). Since the conductor is uncharged, the positive charge +q inside the cavity induces a negative charge on the inner surface of the conductor and a corresponding positive charge on the outer surface. However, for points outside the conductor, the electric field can be treated as if the entire conductor behaves like a point charge located at its center. The electric field due to the charge +q at point P is primarily dependent on the distance l from the cavity's center to point P. The angle θ does not affect the magnitude of the electric field at point P since we are considering the distance l directly. Therefore, the correct expression for the electric field at point P is given by E = (1/4πε₀)(q/l²), which corresponds to choice C. This choice reflects the fact that the electric field due to a point charge is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the charge, confirming that the induced charges on the conductor do not affect the external field significantly. Thus, the answer is C.

proposed answer: In this problem, we have a spherical conductor with an off-center cavity containing a positive charge +q. The conductor is uncharged, which means that the total charge on the conductor remains zero. The presence of the charge +q inside the cavity induces a negative charge on the inner surface of the conductor, while the outer surface will have a positive charge that maintains the overall neutrality of the conductor. To find the electric field at point P, which is outside the conductor, we can utilize the principles of electrostatics. According to Gauss's law and the properties of conductors, the electric field outside a conductor depends only on the total charge enclosed by a Gaussian surface. Since the charge +q is inside the cavity and the conductor is neutral overall, we can treat the conductor as if it has a total charge of +q at its center when calculating the electric field outside. The distance L from the center of the conductor to point P is the relevant distance here for determining the electric field. Therefore, the correct expression for the electric field at point P should depend on L, and the formula that matches this consideration is the fourth option: E = (1/4πε₀)(q/L²). The other options either incorrectly account for the distance from the cavity center or do not reflect the shielding effect of the conductor, thus failing to provide the correct relationship for the electric field at the external point P.
