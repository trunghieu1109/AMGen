Question: Example(question='Imagine an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ having a small spherical cavity inside. The centre of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the centre of the spherical conductor. The radius of the cavity is $r$, and $r<R$. Now consider a small amount of positive charge $+q$ is somehow placed somewhere inside the cavity. What is the magnitude of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at a point P (outside the spherical conductor) of distance $L$ from the centre of the spherical conductor? Note, the distance of the point P from the centre of the cavity is $l$. Here, l, L > R.

proposed answer: The problem involves a spherical conductor with a cavity and a charge +q placed inside the cavity. The conductor is initially uncharged. When the charge +q is placed inside the cavity, it induces a charge of -q on the inner surface of the cavity and a charge of +q on the outer surface of the conductor to maintain overall neutrality. Due to the spherical symmetry of the conductor, the electric field outside the conductor is equivalent to that of a point charge +q located at the center of the conductor. This is because the induced charges redistribute such that the field outside is as if the entire charge were concentrated at the center. The point P is located outside the conductor at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and since P is outside, the electric field at P is determined by this effective central charge. The angle Î¸ and the displacement s are irrelevant for calculating the field at P, as the outer field is spherically symmetric. Therefore, the electric field at P is given by the expression for a point charge at distance L. The correct choice is D) $E = \dfrac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_o} \dfrac{q}{L^2}$. This reasoning assumes the conductor is ideal and perfectly conducting, and the symmetry ensures that the field outside depends only on the net charge and the distance from the center.
