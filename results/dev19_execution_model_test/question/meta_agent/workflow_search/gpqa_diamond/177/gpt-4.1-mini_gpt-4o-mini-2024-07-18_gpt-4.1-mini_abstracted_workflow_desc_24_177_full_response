The fermion field \\psi has a mass dimension of 3/2 in 4D spacetime. The field strength tensor \\ F^{\\mu\\nu} has a mass dimension of 2, as it is derived from the gauge field which is dimension 1. The operator \\sigma_{\\mu\\nu} is constructed from gamma matrices, which are dimensionless, thus it does not contribute any additional mass dimension.

In 4-dimensional spacetime, the mass dimension of a fermion field \\psi is 3/2, as it has dimension [\\psi] = 3/2 to ensure kinetic terms in the Lagrangian have dimension 4. The field strength tensor F^{\\mu\\nu} has dimension 2, as it corresponds to the derivative of a gauge field, which has dimension 1. The operator \\sigma_{\\mu\\nu} is a dimensionless quantity since it is constructed from gamma matrices, which are also dimensionless. Therefore, we can write the mass dimensions as follows: [\\bar{\\psi}] = 3/2, [\\psi] = 3/2, [F^{\\mu\\nu}] = 2, and [\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}] = 0. Now, we can combine these dimensions in the Lagrangian: [\\mathcal{L}_{int}] = [\\kappa] + [\\bar{\\psi}] + [\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}] + [\\psi] + [F^{\\mu\\nu}]. This gives us the equation: 4 = [\\kappa] + (3/2) + (0) + (3/2) + (2). Simplifying this, we find that 4 = [\\kappa] + 3, which leads to [\\kappa] = 1.

For the interaction Lagrangian \\mathcal{L}_{int}=\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}$, we need to analyze the mass dimensions of the fields involved. The fermionic field \\psi has a mass dimension of \\left[\\psi\\right]_{M}=\\frac{3}{2}$, and the field strength tensor \\ F^{\\mu\\nu}$ has a mass dimension of \\left[F^{\\mu\\nu}\\right]_{M}=2$. The operator \\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$, being constructed from gamma matrices, is dimensionless, so \\left[\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\right]_{M}=0$. The Lagrangian density itself must have a mass dimension of 4 in 4-dimensional spacetime.
