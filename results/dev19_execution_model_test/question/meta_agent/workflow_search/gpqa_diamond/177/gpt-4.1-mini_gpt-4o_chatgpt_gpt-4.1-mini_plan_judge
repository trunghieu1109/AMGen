proposed answer: To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant \( \kappa \) in the Lagrangian \( \mathcal{L}_{int} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu} \), we need to consider the mass dimensions of each component. In four-dimensional spacetime, the Lagrangian density must have a mass dimension of 4. The fermionic field \( \psi \) has a mass dimension of 3/2, and its adjoint \( \bar{\psi} \) has the same dimension. The electromagnetic field strength tensor \( F^{\mu\nu} \) has a mass dimension of 2. The \( \sigma_{\mu\nu} \) term, being a combination of gamma matrices, is dimensionless. Therefore, the mass dimension of the product \( \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu} \) is \( 3/2 + 3/2 + 2 = 5 \). To ensure the Lagrangian density has a total dimension of 4, the mass dimension of \( \kappa \) must be \( 4 - 5 = -1 \). A negative mass dimension for \( \kappa \) indicates the theory is not renormalizable, as renormalizable interactions typically have non-negative mass dimensions for coupling constants. This is because a negative mass dimension for a coupling constant implies that the interaction becomes stronger at higher energies, leading to non-renormalizable divergences. Therefore, the correct choice is that \( \kappa \) has a mass dimension of -1 and the theory is not renormalizable.
