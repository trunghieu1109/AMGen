proposed answer: To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant \kappa in the interaction Lagrangian \mathcal{L}_{int}=\kappa\bar{\psi}\sigma_{\mu\nu}\psi F^{\mu\nu}, we analyze the mass dimensions of the fields involved. In 4-dimensional spacetime, the mass dimension of a fermionic field \psi is \left[\psi\right]_{M}=\frac{3}{2}, and the mass dimension of the field strength tensor \ F^{\mu\nu} is \left[F^{\mu\nu}\right]_{M}=2$. The operator \sigma_{\mu\nu} is constructed from gamma matrices, which are dimensionless, so \left[\sigma_{\mu\nu}\right]_{M}=0$. The Lagrangian must have a total mass dimension of 4. Setting up the equation for the mass dimension of \kappa: \left[\mathcal{L}_{int}\right]_{M}=\left[\kappa\right]_{M}+\left[\bar{\psi}\right]_{M}+\left[\sigma_{\mu\nu}\right]_{M}+\left[\psi\right]_{M}+\left[F^{\mu\nu}\right]_{M}=4$, we find \left[\kappa\right]_{M}+\frac{3}{2}+0+\frac{3}{2}+2=4$. Simplifying this gives \left[\kappa\right]_{M}=1$. Couplings with positive mass dimensions typically indicate renormalizable theories, thus suggesting that the theory is renormalizable. Therefore, the mass dimension of \kappa is 1, and the theory is renormalizable, leading to the correct answer being choice B.

proposed answer: To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant \kappa in the interaction Lagrangian \mathcal{L}_{int} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}, we analyze the mass dimensions of the components involved. In 4-dimensional spacetime, the mass dimension of the Lagrangian density must equal 4. The mass dimension of the Dirac spinor field \psi is \left[\psi\right]_{M} = \frac{3}{2}, and the mass dimension of the electromagnetic field strength tensor \ F^{\mu\nu} is \left[F^{\mu\nu}\right]_{M} = 2. The term \sigma_{\mu\nu} is dimensionless as it is a product of gamma matrices. Therefore, we can express the total mass dimension of the Lagrangian as follows: \left[\mathcal{L}_{int}\right]_{M} = \left[\kappa\right]_{M} + \left[\bar{\psi}\right]_{M} + \left[\sigma_{\mu\nu}\right]_{M} + \left[\psi\right]_{M} + \left[F^{\mu\nu}\right]_{M} = \left[\kappa\right]_{M} + \frac{3}{2} + 0 + \frac{3}{2} + 2 = \left[\kappa\right]_{M} + 4. Setting this equal to 4 gives \left[\kappa\right]_{M} = -1. This indicates that \kappa has a negative mass dimension, which typically implies that the theory is non-renormalizable. Therefore, the conclusion is that the mass dimension of \kappa is -1 and the theory is not renormalizable, leading to choice C) as the correct answer.
