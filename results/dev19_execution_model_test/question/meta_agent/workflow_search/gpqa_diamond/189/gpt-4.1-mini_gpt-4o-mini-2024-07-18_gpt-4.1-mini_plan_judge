Question: Example(question='The reaction of an electron pair donor, nucleophile (Nu) with an electron pair acceptor is called nucleophilic substitution reaction. An sp3-hybridized electrophile needs to have a leaving group to proceed with the reaction. Substitution reactions have the following two types. One is SN1 and the other is the SN2 reaction. In contrast to the substitution reaction, the elimination reaction involves the removal of a pair or groups of atoms from a molecule. These are chemical reactions in which single carbon-carbon bonded organic compounds are converted to compounds containing double/triple bonds (unsaturated compounds).\nArrange the following nucleophiles more reactive to the poorest reactive in the aqueous solution.\n\n1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate\n2.

proposed answer: To determine the reactivity of the nucleophiles in aqueous solution, we analyze their properties based on charge, steric hindrance, solvation effects, and resonance stabilization. 1) 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate is a cyclic alkoxide with a negative charge, which generally enhances nucleophilicity, but its cyclic structure may introduce steric hindrance that could reduce its reactivity compared to simpler alkoxides. 2) Hydroxide (OH⁻) is a strong nucleophile due to its negative charge and low steric hindrance, making it very reactive in aqueous solution. 3) Propionate (CH3CH2COO⁻) is resonance-stabilized, which decreases its nucleophilicity compared to alkoxides and hydroxide, as the negative charge is delocalized. 4) Methanol (CH3OH) is a neutral alcohol, making it a poor nucleophile due to the lack of a negative charge. 5) Ethanethiolate (CH3CH2S⁻) is a thiolate, which tends to be more nucleophilic than hydroxide in protic solvents because thiolates are less solvated than hydroxides, enhancing their nucleophilicity. Considering these factors, the most reactive nucleophiles are likely to be hydroxide and ethanethiolate, followed by the cyclic alkoxide, then the carboxylate, and finally the neutral alcohol. This leads to the arrangement: 2 (hydroxide), 5 (ethanethiolate), 1 (4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate), 3 (propionate), and 4 (methanol). Therefore, the correct choice reflecting this order is '2, 5, 1, 4 and 3'.

proposed answer: To evaluate the reactivity of the nucleophiles in aqueous solution, we consider their charge, solvation effects, and steric factors. Hydroxide (OH⁻) is a strong nucleophile but is highly solvated, which can reduce its nucleophilicity. Ethanethiolate (CH3CH2S⁻) is also a strong nucleophile and is less solvated than hydroxide, enhancing its nucleophilicity. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate is a cyclic alkoxide and may experience steric hindrance, which could reduce its effective nucleophilicity compared to ethanethiolate. Propionate (CH3CH2COO⁻) is resonance stabilized, decreasing its nucleophilicity compared to the more reactive alkoxides and thiolates. Methanol (CH3OH) is neutral and thus the least reactive nucleophile. Therefore, the order of nucleophilicity from most to least reactive is: Hydroxide (2), Ethanethiolate (5), 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (1), Propionate (3), and Methanol (4). This leads to the conclusion that the correct arrangement of nucleophiles in terms of reactivity is choice 2: '2, 5, 1, 4 and 3'.
