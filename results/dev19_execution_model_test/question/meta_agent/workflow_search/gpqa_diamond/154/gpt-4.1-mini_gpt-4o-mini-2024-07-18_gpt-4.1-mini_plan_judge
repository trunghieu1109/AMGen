Question: Example(question='Imagine an operator $\\vec{P}$ of a system have components $P_x, P_y$ and $P_z$. The matrix form of the  operator $P_x$ has components in the first row as $(0, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,\\hbar/\\sqrt{2},0)$.  The matrix form of the  operator $P_y$ has components in the first row as $(0, -i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0, -i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2},0)$. Similarly, matrix form of the  operator $P_z$ has components in the first row as $(\\hbar, 0, 0)$, that in the second row as $(0, 0, 0)$ and that in the third row as $(0,0, -\\hbar)$. The basis vectors here are the eigenvectors of $P_z$. The system is found in the eigenstate of $P_x$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$. To be more specific, the explicit form of the state of the system is given by the column vector having elements $(-1/2, 1/\\sqrt{2}, -1/2)$. What is the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z $ of $P_z$', choice1='\\hbar\n', choice2='\\hbar/2', choice3='\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}\n', choice4='\\sqrt{2}\\hbar', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: To calculate the uncertainty ΔPz, we use the formula ΔPz = sqrt(<Pz^2> - <Pz>^2). From the previous sub-tasks, we have computed the expectation values: <Pz> = 0 and <Pz^2> = ħ^2/2. Now, we can substitute these values into the formula. First, we calculate <Pz>^2, which is 0^2 = 0. Next, we substitute <Pz^2> = ħ^2/2 into the formula: ΔPz = sqrt(ħ^2/2 - 0) = sqrt(ħ^2/2) = ħ/sqrt(2). This result indicates the uncertainty in the measurement of the observable corresponding to the operator Pz in the given state. The interpretation in terms of ħ shows that the uncertainty is proportional to ħ, which is a fundamental constant in quantum mechanics. Therefore, the final answer is C) ħ/√2.
