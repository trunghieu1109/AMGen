Question: Example(question='Imagine an operator $\\vec{P}$ of a system have components $P_x, P_y$ and $P_z$. The matrix form of the  operator $P_x$ has components in the first row as $(0, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,\\hbar/\\sqrt{2},0)$.  The matrix form of the  operator $P_y$ has components in the first row as $(0, -i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0, -i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2},0)$. Similarly, matrix form of the  operator $P_z$ has components in the first row as $(\\hbar, 0, 0)$, that in the second row as $(0, 0, 0)$ and that in the third row as $(0,0, -\\hbar)$. The basis vectors here are the eigenvectors of $P_z$. The system is found in the eigenstate of $P_x$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$. To be more specific, the explicit form of the state of the system is given by the column vector having elements $(-1/2, 1/\\sqrt{2}, -1/2)$. What is the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z $ of $P_z$', choice1='\\hbar\n', choice2='\\hbar/2', choice3='\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}\n', choice4='\\sqrt{2}\\hbar', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: To determine the uncertainty ΔP_z, we use the formula ΔP_z = sqrt(<P_z^2> - <P_z>^2). From the previous sub-tasks, we have calculated the expectation values: <P_z> = 0 and <P_z^2> = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}. Substituting these values into the formula, we get: ΔP_z = sqrt(\frac{\hbar^2}{2} - 0^2) = sqrt(\frac{\hbar^2}{2}). Simplifying this expression, we find ΔP_z = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}. This matches the choice C). All agents agree on this calculation, confirming the consistency and correctness of the result. Therefore, the most consistent and correct uncertainty ΔP_z is \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}, corresponding to answer choice C).
