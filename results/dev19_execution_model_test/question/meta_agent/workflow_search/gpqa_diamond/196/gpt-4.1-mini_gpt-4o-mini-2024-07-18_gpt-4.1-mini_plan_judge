proposed answer: The IR spectrum of Compound X shows a broad absorption at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹, indicating the presence of a carboxylic acid O–H stretch, which confirms that Compound X contains a carboxylic acid functional group. The peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ corresponds to a carbonyl (C=O) stretch typical of carboxylic acids, further supporting this functional group. The peaks at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ suggest C=C stretches in an aromatic ring, indicating that Compound X is likely an aromatic compound. The 1H NMR spectrum shows a broad singlet at 10.5 ppm, which is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton, corroborating the IR findings. The presence of two doublets at 8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm, each integrating to 2H, suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. The aliphatic region (2.9, 1.7, 1.4, 0.9 ppm) shows various splitting patterns that indicate the presence of a branched alkyl group, likely a sec-butyl group based on the integration and splitting patterns observed. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI suggests a reduction or halogenation process, which may affect the functional groups present in Compound X. Therefore, the final product after the reaction will likely retain the aromatic structure while modifying the alkyl or acid functionalities. Considering the choices provided, the most consistent product with the spectral data and potential transformations is '4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid', as it maintains the carboxylic acid functionality and the aromatic structure, which is supported by the spectral evidence.

proposed answer: The IR spectrum of Compound X shows a broad absorption between 3400-2500 cm⁻¹, indicating the presence of a carboxylic acid O–H stretch, which is consistent with the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group. The peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ suggests a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, reinforcing the presence of the carboxylic acid. The aromatic C=C stretches appear near 1610 and 1450 cm⁻¹. In the 1H NMR spectrum, the peak at 10.5 ppm is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton, further confirming the presence of this functional group. The aromatic protons appear as two doublets (8.0 and 7.2 ppm, each integrating to 2H), indicating a para-substituted benzene ring. The aliphatic region (2.9, 1.7, 1.4, 0.9 ppm) shows multiplets and splitting patterns consistent with a sec-butyl or related alkyl group. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI typically leads to decarboxylation of carboxylic acids, particularly in aromatic systems. Given the presence of red phosphorus and HI, the carboxylic acid group is likely to be converted to a methyl group through a decarboxylation mechanism. This involves the loss of CO2 and the formation of an aryl radical or cation, which can then be reduced to an alkyl group. Therefore, the assumption that the carboxylic acid remains intact is incorrect; it is transformed into a methyl group. The final product, based on the spectral data and the expected reaction pathway, aligns with the structure of 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which reflects the transformation of the carboxylic acid to a methyl group while retaining the sec-butyl substituent. Thus, the most consistent and correct interpretation of the reaction mechanism leads to the conclusion that the final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, making the answer A the most appropriate choice.
