proposed answer: The IR and NMR data for compound X suggest it is a para-substituted benzoic acid with a sec-butyl side chain. The IR spectrum shows a broad absorption at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹, indicating a carboxylic acid O–H stretch, and a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ for a carbonyl group, consistent with a carboxylic acid. The 1H NMR data includes a broad singlet at 10.5 ppm, characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton, and aromatic doublets at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm, consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring. The aliphatic signals suggest a sec-butyl group. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI is known to reduce carboxylic acids to alkanes, converting the carboxylic acid group to a methyl group while retaining the aromatic and alkyl side chain structure. This aligns with the transformation of a para-substituted benzoic acid to a para-substituted alkane. Among the choices, 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene (choice A) fits this description as the carboxylic acid is reduced to a methyl group, resulting in a para-substituted benzene with a sec-butyl group. All agents agree on this interpretation, and the reasoning is consistent with the known chemistry of the reaction. Therefore, the final product is choice A.
