Red phosphorus and HI are known to reduce carboxylic acids to alkanes. In this case, the IR and NMR data indicate that compound X contains a para-substituted benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group. The broad absorption in the IR spectrum from 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carboxylic acid O–H stretch, and the sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ indicates a carbonyl group (C=O) of a carboxylic acid. The 1H NMR signal at 10.5 ppm, a broad singlet, is also indicative of a carboxylic acid proton. When compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, the carboxylic acid group is reduced, likely to a methyl group or another alkyl group, depending on the specific conditions and structure of the original compound. This transformation results in the loss of the carboxylic acid functionality and the formation of an alkyl-substituted benzene. Given the spectral data and the typical reaction outcome, the carboxylic acid group is reduced to an alkyl group, leading to the formation of a para-substituted benzene with an alkyl side chain. This aligns with the final product being 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, as the carboxylic acid group is reduced to a methyl group, and the sec-butyl group remains intact.; answer: A)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent gGQg, interpret reaction, thinking: The reaction of compound X with red phosphorus and HI is a classic method for reducing carboxylic acids to alkanes. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the HI reduction method, where the carboxylic acid group (RCOOH) is reduced to an alkane (RH). This occurs through a series of steps: first, the carboxylic acid is converted to an acyl iodide by the action of HI. Then, the acyl iodide is further reduced to an alkyl iodide. Finally, the alkyl iodide is reduced to an alkane by the excess HI. In the context of the given problem, compound X contains a carboxylic acid moiety, as indicated by the IR and NMR data. The broad IR absorption at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ and the NMR signal at 10.5 ppm confirm the presence of a carboxylic acid. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI will reduce this carboxylic acid to an alkane, effectively removing the carboxyl group and replacing it with a hydrogen atom. The rest of the structure, including the para-substituted aromatic ring and the sec-butyl side chain, remains unchanged. Therefore, the transformation specifically affects the carboxylic acid moiety, converting it to an alkane, and the final product will be a para-substituted benzene with an alkyl group replacing the carboxylic acid.; answer: A)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent hAGb, interpret reaction, thinking: The reaction of a carboxylic acid with red phosphorus and HI typically results in the reduction of the carboxylic acid group to an alkyl group. This transformation is known as the HI reduction or HI/P reduction. In this process, the carboxylic acid functional group (R-COOH) is reduced to an alkane (R-CH3). The mechanism involves the formation of an alkyl iodide intermediate, which is then reduced further by HI. The IR and NMR data for compound X suggest it is a para-substituted benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group. The IR spectrum shows a broad O-H stretch and a C=O stretch, indicating a carboxylic acid group, while the NMR data supports a para-substitution pattern on the benzene ring. Upon reaction with red phosphorus and HI, the carboxylic acid group is reduced, resulting in the final product being a para-substituted benzene with an alkyl group replacing the carboxylic acid. Therefore, the carboxylic acid moiety is transformed into a methyl group.

The 1H NMR data includes a broad singlet at 10.5 ppm, typical for a carboxylic acid proton. These data suggest that compound X is a para-substituted benzoic acid with an alkyl side chain. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI is known to reduce carboxylic acids to alkanes by converting the carboxylic acid to an acyl iodide, then to an alkyl iodide, and finally to an alkane. This means the carboxylic acid group in compound X is reduced to a methyl group. The para-substituted aromatic ring and the sec-butyl side chain remain unchanged.

The 1H NMR signal at 10.5 ppm, a broad singlet, is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton. The signals at 8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm (doublets) suggest a para-substituted benzene ring. The aliphatic signals (2.9, 1.7, 1.4, and 0.9 ppm) are consistent with a sec-butyl group. Based on these data, compound X is likely a para-substituted benzoic acid with a sec-butyl side chain. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI is known to convert carboxylic acids to alkanes by reducing the carboxylic acid group.

The IR spectrum suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid group due to the broad absorption between 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ and the sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicating a carbonyl group.
