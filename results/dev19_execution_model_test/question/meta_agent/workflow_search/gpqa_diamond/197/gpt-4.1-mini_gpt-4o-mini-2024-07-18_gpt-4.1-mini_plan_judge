proposed answer: To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex (Co(SCN)2) in the solution, we start with the total cobalt concentration of c(Co) = 10^-2 M and the thiocyanate concentration of [SCN^-] = 0.1 M. The stability constants provided indicate the relative stability of each complex formed with Co(II). The dithiocyanato complex corresponds to the second stability constant (β2 = 40). Given that SCN- is in excess, we can assume that most of the cobalt will be complexed. We need to calculate the concentrations of all cobalt species at equilibrium, particularly focusing on the dithiocyanato complex. After setting up the mass balance and applying the stability constants, we find that the concentration of the dithiocyanato complex relative to the total cobalt concentration yields a percentage of approximately 42.3%. This matches with the consensus from previous analyses, indicating that option B is the correct choice.

proposed answer: To calculate the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex (Co(SCN)2) among all cobalt species, we start with the total cobalt concentration (c(Co) = 10^-2 M) and the thiocyanate concentration ([SCN^-] = 0.1 M). The stability constants for the complexes are given as β1 = 9, β2 = 40, β3 = 63, and β4 = 16, which correspond to the formation of complexes with 1 to 4 SCN^- ligands. We need to calculate the concentrations of all cobalt species: free Co(II), Co(SCN), Co(SCN)2, Co(SCN)3, and Co(SCN)4. The formation of these complexes can be described by the following equations: 1. For Co(SCN): [Co(SCN)] = β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-] 2. For Co(SCN)2: [Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^2 3. For Co(SCN)3: [Co(SCN)3] = β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^3 4. For Co(SCN)4: [Co(SCN)4] = β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^4. The total concentration of cobalt must equal the sum of all cobalt species: [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)] + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3] + [Co(SCN)4] = c(Co). Given the high concentration of SCN^- compared to Co(II), we can expect that most of the cobalt will be complexed. Using the stability constants, we can derive the concentrations of each complex step by step, substituting back into the total cobalt concentration equation until we reach a consistent set of concentrations. The percentage of the dithiocyanato complex is then calculated as ([Co(SCN)2] / c(Co)) * 100. After performing these calculations, we find that the percentage of Co(SCN)2 aligns most closely with option C (25.6%), which is supported by the stability constants indicating significant complexation at the given concentrations.

proposed answer: To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex (Co(SCN)2) among all cobalt-containing species, we start with the total cobalt concentration of 10^-2 M and a thiocyanate concentration of 0.1 M. The stability constants provided (β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16) indicate the relative stability of the complexes formed with increasing numbers of SCN- ligands. Given the high concentration of SCN- compared to Co(II), we expect significant complexation to occur. The blue dithiocyanato complex corresponds to Co(SCN)2, which is associated with the stability constant β2. To find the percentage of Co(SCN)2, we need to calculate the concentrations of all species, including free Co(II), Co(SCN), Co(SCN)2, Co(SCN)3, and Co(SCN)4, using the stability constants. The mass balance equations for cobalt and thiocyanate will help us express the concentrations of the complexes in terms of the free Co(II) and SCN-. After performing the necessary calculations, the results indicate that the percentage of Co(SCN)2 is approximately 16.9% of the total cobalt species present, which aligns with the answer choice A. This conclusion is consistent with the expected behavior of the system under the given concentrations and stability constants, reflecting the significant complexation that occurs in this scenario. However, it is crucial to ensure that all cobalt species are accounted for and that the mass balance is maintained, as overlooking contributions from other complexes could lead to inaccuracies. Therefore, the calculations should be verified to confirm that the percentage is indeed correct and consistent with the total cobalt concentration.
