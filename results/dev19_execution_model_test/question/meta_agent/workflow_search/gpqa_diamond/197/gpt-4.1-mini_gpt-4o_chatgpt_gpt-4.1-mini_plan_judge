Question: Example(question='We have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate, where the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M and the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16. What will be the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species in the solution?

proposed answer: To calculate the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex (Co(SCN)_2) relative to the total cobalt concentration, we use the equilibrium concentrations derived from the stability constants. The total cobalt concentration is 10^-2 M. The concentration of the Co(SCN)_2 complex is calculated using the stability constant β2 = 40 and the assumption that [SCN^-] ≈ 0.1 M. The concentration of Co(SCN)_2 is given by [Co(SCN)_2] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^2 = 40 * [Co^2+] * (0.1)^2. From the equilibrium calculations, we found [Co^2+] ≈ 4.23 * 10^-3 M. Therefore, [Co(SCN)_2] ≈ 0.4 * 4.23 * 10^-3 M ≈ 1.69 * 10^-3 M. The percentage of Co(SCN)_2 is then ([Co(SCN)_2] / 10^-2 M) * 100% = (1.69 * 10^-3 M / 10^-2 M) * 100% ≈ 16.9%. This calculation shows that the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex among all cobalt-containing species is 16.9%.
