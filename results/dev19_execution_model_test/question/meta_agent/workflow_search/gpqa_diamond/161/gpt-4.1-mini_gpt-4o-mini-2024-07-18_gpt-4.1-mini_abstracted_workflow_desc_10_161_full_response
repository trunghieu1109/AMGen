The area element in polar coordinates is given by dA = sqrt(g) dr dtheta, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. For our metric, the determinant can be calculated as g = (32 / (4 - r^2)) * r^2.

The area element in polar coordinates is given by dA = sqrt(g) dr dtheta, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. In this case, the metric tensor can be expressed as a 2x2 matrix with the components derived from the metric. The determinant g can be computed and will yield a scalar factor.

The metric is defined as ds² = (32 / (4 - x² - y²))(dx² + dy²), which indicates that the area is influenced by the factor (32 / (4 - x² - y²)). As we approach the boundary defined by x² + y² = 4 (which corresponds to a radius of 2), this factor approaches infinity, leading to a singularity in the metric.

In polar coordinates, the area element becomes dA = sqrt(g) dr dθ, where the determinant g of the metric tensor includes the singular factor. When we integrate over the region where r varies from 0 to 2, we find that the area diverges due to the singular nature of the metric at the boundary.

The metric is given by ds^2 = (32 / (4 - r^2))(dr^2 + r^2 dtheta^2), leading to the area element dA = sqrt(g) dr dtheta, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. In this case, g = (32 / (4 - r^2)) * r^2. Therefore, dA becomes dA = sqrt((32 / (4 - r^2)) * r^2) dr dtheta.

However, as r approaches 2, the term (4 - r^2) in the denominator approaches zero, causing the area element to diverge.

The metric is given by ds² = (32 / (4 - x² - y²))(dx² + dy²), which indicates that it is conformally equivalent to the Euclidean metric but with a scaling factor that depends on the coordinates x and y. The singularity occurs at the boundary where x² + y² = 4, corresponding to a radius of 2 in the Euclidean plane. This suggests that as we approach this boundary, the area element derived from the metric becomes unbounded. In polar coordinates, the metric can be expressed as ds² = (32 / (4 - r²))(dr² + r² dθ²), where r is the radial coordinate. The area element is then dA = √g dr dθ, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. Given that g = (32 / (4 - r²)) * r², we find that the area element becomes dA = √((32 / (4 - r²)) * r²) dr dθ. When integrating this area element over the region defined by 0 ≤ r < 2 and 0 ≤ θ < 2π, we observe that as r approaches 2, the term (4 - r²) in the denominator approaches zero, causing the area integral to diverge to infinity.
