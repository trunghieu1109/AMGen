proposed answer: To determine the area of the pseudosphere defined by the given metric, we analyze the metric expression ds² = (32 / (4 - x² - y²))(dx² + dy²). The region defined by 4 - x² - y² > 0 corresponds to a circle of radius 2 in the xy-plane. As we approach the boundary of this circle (x² + y² = 4), the term (4 - x² - y²) approaches zero, leading to a singularity in the metric. This suggests that the area will diverge as we integrate up to the boundary. When we set up the integral for the area using polar coordinates, we find that the area element becomes unbounded as we integrate up to the boundary. Thus, the area of the pseudosphere diverges, leading us to conclude that the area is infinite. Therefore, the most consistent answer is A) +∞.
