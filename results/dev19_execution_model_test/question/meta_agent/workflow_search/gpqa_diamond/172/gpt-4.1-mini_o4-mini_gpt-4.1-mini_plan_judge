Question: Example(question="If uncertainty in space of electron's location, which is travelling with speed v= 2* 10^8 m/s along x-direction is Δx=0.1 nm . Based on the infromation estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of electron.", choice1='~10^(-19) J', choice2='~10^(-18) J', choice3='~10^(-16) J', choice4='~10^(-17) J', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: 1. Use Heisenberg uncertainty principle: Δx·Δp ≥ ħ/2. Given Δx = 0.1 nm = 1.0×10⁻¹⁰ m and ħ ≃ 1.055×10⁻³⁴ J·s, the minimum momentum uncertainty is Δp ≃ ħ/(2Δx) = (1.055×10⁻³⁴)/(2×1.0×10⁻¹⁰) ≃ 5.28×10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s.
2. Relate Δp to energy uncertainty ΔE. For nonrelativistic kinetic energy E = p²/(2m), dE/dp = p/m = v. Thus ΔE ≃ v·Δp = (2×10⁸ m/s)×(5.28×10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s) ≃ 1.06×10⁻¹⁶ J.
3. Check approximations: The electron’s speed v≈0.67c gives relativistic corrections ≤10%, much smaller than the order‐of‐magnitude spacing of choices.
4. Since ΔxΔp = ħ/2 gives a lower bound, actual ΔE ≥ calculated value, so the minimum uncertainty in energy is ≃1×10⁻¹⁶ J.
5. Compare with options: A)~10⁻¹⁹ J, B)~10⁻¹⁸ J, C)~10⁻¹⁶ J, D)~10⁻¹⁷ J. The best match is choice C).
