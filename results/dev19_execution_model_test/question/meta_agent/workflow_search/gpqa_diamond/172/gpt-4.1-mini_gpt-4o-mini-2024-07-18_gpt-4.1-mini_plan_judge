proposed answer: To compute the minimum uncertainty in energy ΔE for the electron, we start with the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which states that Δx·Δp ≥ ħ/2. Given Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 × 10^(-9) m, we can calculate Δp using the reduced Planck's constant ħ ≈ 1.055 x 10^(-34) J·s. Rearranging gives Δp ≥ ħ/(2Δx). Substituting the values, we find Δp ≥ (1.055 x 10^(-34) J·s) / (2 * 0.1 x 10^(-9) m) = 5.275 x 10^(-24) kg·m/s. Next, we relate Δp to ΔE. The uncertainty in kinetic energy ΔE can be approximated as ΔE = v * Δp, where v = 2 × 10^8 m/s. Thus, ΔE = (2 × 10^8 m/s) * (5.275 x 10^(-24) kg·m/s) = 1.055 x 10^(-15) J. Comparing this value with the provided choices, it is closest to ~10^(-16) J, which corresponds to choice C. Therefore, the best estimate for the minimum uncertainty in energy ΔE is ~10^(-16) J.
