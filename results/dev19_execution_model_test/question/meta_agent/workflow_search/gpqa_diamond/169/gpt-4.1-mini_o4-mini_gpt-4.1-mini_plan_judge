Question: Example(question='An electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Find the expectation value of its spin along y-direction, S_y.\nNote: \\sigma_y (in latex format) is: \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & -i \\\\\ni & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}', choice1='-25*hbar/2\n\n', choice2='-12*hbar/25\n\n', choice3='12*hbar/25', choice4='25*hbar/2\n', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: 1. The given (unnormalized) spinor is |ψ⟩ = (3i, 4)^T. 2. Compute its norm squared: |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = 9 + 16 = 25. Thus the normalized state is |ψ_norm⟩ = (3i/5, 4/5)^T. 3. The operator S_y = (ħ/2) σ_y, and σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. 4. Apply σ_y to |ψ_norm⟩: σ_y|ψ_norm⟩ = ( -i·(4/5), i·(3i/5) )^T = ( -4i/5, -3/5 )^T. Hence S_y|ψ_norm⟩ = (ħ/2)(-4i/5, -3/5)^T. 5. The bra is ⟨ψ_norm| = (|ψ_norm⟩)† = ( -3i/5, 4/5 ). 6. Compute ⟨ψ_norm|σ_y|ψ_norm⟩ = (-3i/5)(-4i/5) + (4/5)(-3/5) = (12 i^2/25) - (12/25) = (-12/25) - (12/25) = -24/25. 7. Multiply by ħ/2: ⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2)(-24/25) = -12ħ/25. 8. Comparing to the choices, this matches option B) -12ħ/25.
