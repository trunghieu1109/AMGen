Question: Example(question='Observations of a quasar across the electromagnetic spectrum are being carried out. Focusing on the near infrared and optical spectrum, there is a peak at wavelength of about 790 nm, and at shorter wavelengths < 790 nm the flux drops significantly.\n\nIf we lived in a universe defined by Lambda-CDM model such that the current Hubble constant is 70 km s^-1 Mpc^-1, matter density parameter is 0.3, dark energy density parameter is 0.7, and universe is flat,\nwhat can be assumed about the value of the comoving distance (for scale factor a=1) of this quasar from the Earth?', choice1='8 Gpc', choice2='9 Gpc', choice3='7 Gpc', choice4='6 Gpc', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: To determine the comoving distance of the quasar from Earth, we first need to calculate the redshift (z) based on the observed peak wavelength of 790 nm. The Lyman-alpha emission line, which is a common feature in quasar spectra, has a rest-frame wavelength of approximately 121.6 nm. We can use the formula for redshift: z = (λ_observed - λ_rest) / λ_rest. Substituting the values, we find: z = (790 nm - 121.6 nm) / 121.6 nm = 5.49. This high redshift indicates that the quasar is very distant. Next, we relate this redshift to the comoving distance using the cosmological parameters provided in the Lambda-CDM model. For a flat universe with the given parameters (Hubble constant of 70 km/s/Mpc, matter density parameter of 0.3, and dark energy density parameter of 0.7), we can estimate the comoving distance for z ≈ 5.49. Typically, cosmological calculators or tables indicate that a redshift of this magnitude corresponds to a comoving distance around 8 Gpc. Therefore, after considering the options provided (6 Gpc, 7 Gpc, 8 Gpc, 9 Gpc), the most reasonable assumption for the comoving distance of the quasar is 8 Gpc, as it aligns with the expected values for such a high redshift in the context of the Lambda-CDM model. This conclusion is supported by the calculations and the understanding of cosmological distances, making 8 Gpc the most appropriate choice.
