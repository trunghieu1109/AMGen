In flat ΛCDM (H₀=70 km/s/Mpc, Ω_m=0.3, Ω_Λ=0.7), the comoving distance D_C(z) = (c/H₀) ∫₀^z dz\'/√[Ω_m(1+z\')^3+Ω_Λ]. With c/H₀ ≃ 4286 Mpc and ∫₀^{5.5}dz\'/… ≃ 1.87, we get D_C ≃ 4286×1.87 ≃ 8016 Mpc ≃ 8.0 Gpc. Among the options 6, 7, 8, 9 Gpc, 8 Gpc clearly matches this estimate and is robust against ±10% parameter uncertainties (which shift D_C by <0.5 Gpc).\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent zYVO:\nStep 1: Identify the spectral feature. The sharp drop in flux shortward of 790 nm is characteristic of the Gunn–Peterson trough from neutral hydrogen absorption at rest-frame 121.6 nm (Lyman-α).\n\nStep 2: Compute redshift. (1+z)=λ_obs/λ_rest=790 nm/121.6 nm≈6.50 ⇒ z≈5.5.\n\nStep 3: Set up comoving distance in flat ΛCDM: D_C(z)= (c/H₀) ∫₀^z dz\'/√[Ω_m(1+z\')^3+Ω_Λ].\n\nStep 4: Calculate prefactor: c/H₀=(3×10^5 km/s)/(70 km/s/Mpc)≈4286 Mpc.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate integral ∫₀^{5.5} dz\'/√[0.3(1+z\')^3+0.7] by numerical quadrature ≈1.87.\n\nStep 6: Multiply: D_C≈4286 Mpc×1.87≈8016 Mpc≈8.0 Gpc.\n\nStep 7: Compare to choices 6,7,8,9 Gpc: 8 Gpc (A) is the closest.

Thus (1+z)=790/121.6≈6.5 ⇒ z≈5.5. In a flat ΛCDM universe (H₀=70 km/s/Mpc, Ωₘ=0.3, Ω_Λ=0.7), the comoving distance D_C(z)= (c/H₀) ∫₀^z dz\'/√[Ωₘ(1+z\')³+Ω_Λ]. With c/H₀≈4286 Mpc and ∫₀^{5.5} dz\'/√[0.3(1+z\')³+0.7]≈1.87, we get D_C≈4286×1.87≈8016 Mpc≈8.0 Gpc. Among the choices (6,7,8,9 Gpc), only 8 Gpc matches this estimate.

If Ωₘ were larger (and Ω_Λ smaller), D_C would be smaller for the same z; conversely, a larger Ω_Λ would increase D_C. Given the standard parameters (H₀=70\u2009km/s/Mpc, Ωₘ=0.3, Ω_Λ=0.7), the comoving distance at z≈5.5 is closest to 8\u2009Gpc, corresponding to option A).; answer: A)\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent qAR5, round 0, calculating comoving distance, thinking: 1.

The sharp drop in flux blueward of the observed peak at λ_obs≈790 nm is characteristic of the Gunn–Peterson trough due to neutral hydrogen absorption just below the Lyα line in the quasar’s rest frame at λ_rest=121.6 nm. Thus (1+z)=λ_obs/λ_rest⇒z≈(790 nm/121.6 nm)−1≈5.5.\n\nStep 2: Write down the comoving distance integral for a flat ΛCDM universe.  In a flat universe (Ω_k=0) with H₀=70 km/s/Mpc, Ω_m=0.3, Ω_Λ=0.7, the line‐of‐sight comoving distance to redshift z is\nD_C(z) = (c/H₀) ∫₀ᶻ [Ω_m(1+z′)³ + Ω_Λ]^(−1/2) dz′.\n\nStep 3: Perform the numerical integration.  Converting H₀ to units with c=299792.458 km/s, the prefactor c/H₀≈4283 Mpc.  Evaluating the integral ∫₀⁵.⁵ dz′/√(0.3(1+z′)³+0.7) by standard quadrature yields ≈1870 Mpc for z=5.5.

The sharp flux drop blueward of the observed peak at 790 nm is the Gunn–Peterson trough from neutral hydrogen absorption just short of the Lyman-α emission at rest–frame 121.6 nm.  Therefore 1+z = 790/121.6 ≃ 6.496, so z ≃ 5.496.\n\nStep 2: Write down the comoving distance formula in a flat ΛCDM universe.

Using a standard numerical integration (e.g., Simpson’s rule or an adaptive integrator) one finds ∫_0^5.496 dz' / sqrt[0.3 (1+z')^3 + 0.7] ≃ 1.871.
