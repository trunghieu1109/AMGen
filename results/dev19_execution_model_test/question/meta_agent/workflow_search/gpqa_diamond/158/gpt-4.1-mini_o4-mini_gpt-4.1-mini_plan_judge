Question: Example(question='Observations of a quasar across the electromagnetic spectrum are being carried out. Focusing on the near infrared and optical spectrum, there is a peak at wavelength of about 790 nm, and at shorter wavelengths < 790 nm the flux drops significantly.\n\nIf we lived in a universe defined by Lambda-CDM model such that the current Hubble constant is 70 km s^-1 Mpc^-1, matter density parameter is 0.3, dark energy density parameter is 0.7, and universe is flat,\nwhat can be assumed about the value of the comoving distance (for scale factor a=1) of this quasar from the Earth?', choice1='8 Gpc', choice2='9 Gpc', choice3='7 Gpc', choice4='6 Gpc', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: 1. The sharp flux drop at wavelengths shorter than 790 nm is characteristic of the Gunn–Peterson trough caused by neutral hydrogen absorbing blueward of the Lyman-α emission line (rest-frame λ₀=121.6 nm).
2. The redshift z is given by 1+z = λ_obs/λ₀ ≃ 790 nm/121.6 nm ≃ 6.5, so z ≃ 5.5.
3. In a flat ΛCDM universe with H₀=70 km/s/Mpc, Ω_m=0.3, Ω_Λ=0.7, the comoving distance is D_C(z) = (c/H₀) ∫₀^z dz'/√[Ω_m(1+z')^3 + Ω_Λ].
4. The prefactor c/H₀ = (3×10^5 km/s) / (70 km/s/Mpc) ≃ 4286 Mpc.
5. Numerically integrating ∫₀^{5.5} dz'/√[0.3(1+z')^3 + 0.7] yields ≃1.87.
6. Multiplying gives D_C ≃ 4286 Mpc × 1.87 ≃ 8016 Mpc ≃ 8.0 Gpc.
7. Among the options (6, 7, 8, 9 Gpc), 8 Gpc (option A) matches this calculation most closely. Variations in cosmological parameters by ±10% change D_C by less than ~0.5 Gpc, leaving 8 Gpc as the best choice.
