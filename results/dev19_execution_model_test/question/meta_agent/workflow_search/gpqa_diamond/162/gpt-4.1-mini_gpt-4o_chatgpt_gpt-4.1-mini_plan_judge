proposed answer: To determine the correct answer, we need to ensure that the calculated minimum volume of acid and the resulting pH match one of the given multiple-choice options. The dissolution of Fe(OH)3 in acid involves neutralizing the OH- ions with H+ ions from the acid. The stoichiometry of the reaction is Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ -> Fe3+ + 3H2O. First, calculate the moles of Fe(OH)3: the molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is approximately 106.87 g/mol, so 0.1 g corresponds to 0.1 g / 106.87 g/mol = 0.000936 moles of Fe(OH)3. Since 3 moles of H+ are needed per mole of Fe(OH)3, we need 3 * 0.000936 = 0.002808 moles of H+. This requires 0.002808 moles / 0.1 M = 0.02808 L, or 28.08 cm³ of acid. This volume matches closely with the option A) 28.05 cm³. For the pH calculation, after neutralization, the concentration of H+ ions in the total 100 cm³ solution is 0.002808 moles / 0.1 L = 0.02808 M. The pH is -log(0.02808), which is approximately 2.04. This matches the pH given in option A). Therefore, the correct answer is A).

proposed answer: To determine the correct answer, we need to ensure that our calculated values for both the minimum acid volume required and the resulting pH match one of the provided multiple-choice options. From the previous analysis, we have determined that the dissolution of Fe(OH)3 requires neutralizing the OH- ions formed, and we calculated the minimum volume of 0.1 M acid needed to be approximately 28.1 cm³. This calculation considered the stoichiometry of the neutralization reaction and the solubility equilibrium of Fe(OH)3. Additionally, we accounted for the hydrolysis of Fe3+ ions to determine the pH. The hydrolysis of Fe3+ ions can affect the pH, as Fe3+ ions can hydrolyze to produce additional H+ ions, thereby lowering the pH. The calculated pH, considering the hydrolysis, was found to be around 2.04, which matches option A. The volume of 28.05 cm³ given in option A is very close to our calculated 28.1 cm³, and the pH of 2.04 matches our calculated pH. Thus, option A is the most chemically consistent choice, as it aligns with both the stoichiometry and equilibria considerations.
