Given that the excitation ratio of iron atoms in star_1 to star_2 is 2, we can express this as N_1/N_2 = 2. Assuming equal degeneracies for the excited states, we can write: N_1/N_2 = exp(-ΔE/(kT_1)) / exp(-ΔE/(kT_2)). This simplifies to 2 = exp(ΔE/k * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)). Taking the natural logarithm gives us ln(2) = ΔE/k * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1). Rearranging this leads to ln(2) = ΔE/k * (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2). This shows that ln(2) is directly related to the difference in the inverse temperatures of the two stars, scaled by the energy difference and Boltzmann\'s constant.
