Question: Example(question='Two stars are being studied. It has been observed that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2. In fact, the energy difference between the considered energy levels was determined to be approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J. Assuming that the stellar photospheres are in LTE, which of these equations for the effective temperatures of the stars (T_1 and T_2) is correct?', choice1='ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]\n', choice2='ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]\n', choice3='ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n', choice4='ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: 1. Under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state to a lower state at temperature T follows the Boltzmann distribution: n_exc/n_low ∝ exp(–ΔE/(kT)).
2. For star_1 at T₁: R₁ = exp(–ΔE/(kT₁)); for star_2 at T₂: R₂ = exp(–ΔE/(kT₂)).
3. The observed excitation ratio is R₁/R₂ = 2, so:
   2 = exp[–ΔE/(kT₁) + ΔE/(kT₂)] = exp[(ΔE/k)(1/T₂ – 1/T₁)].
4. Taking the natural logarithm gives:
   ln(2) = (ΔE/k)(1/T₂ – 1/T₁).
5. Algebraically, 1/T₂ – 1/T₁ = (T₁ – T₂)/(T₁ T₂).
6. The constant factor ΔE/k is a known numeric ratio (1.38×10⁻²³ J divided by Boltzmann’s constant), and the answer choices absorb that factor into their form.
7. Thus the relationship simplifies to:
   ln(2) = (T₁ – T₂)/(T₁ T₂).
8. Comparing to the provided options:
   A) ln(2) = T₂/T₁ ❌
   B) ln(2) = (T₁ – T₂)/(T₁ T₂)² ❌
   C) ln(2) = (T₁ + T₂)/(T₁ T₂) ❌
   D) ln(2) = (T₁ – T₂)/(T₁ T₂) ✔
9. Only choice D matches the derived formula exactly.
