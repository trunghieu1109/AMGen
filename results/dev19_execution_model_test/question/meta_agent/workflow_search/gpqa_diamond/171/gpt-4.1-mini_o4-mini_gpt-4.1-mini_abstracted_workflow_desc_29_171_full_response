Here the observed excitation ratio 2 = n₁(T₁)/n₁(T₂) arises from exp[–ΔE/(k k) (1/T₁ – 1/T₂)], so ln(2) = ΔE/k · (1/T₂ – 1/T₁). This explicitly involves Boltzmann’s constant k (1.38×10⁻²³ J/K) to convert between energy difference ΔE and temperature. The excitation ratio depends exponentially on ΔE/(kT), making the temperature dependence very sensitive. Thus, the analysis relies on statistical mechanics (Boltzmann factors) and thermodynamics (definition of temperature), with k bridging microscopic energy scales to macroscopic temperatures.; answer: B)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent GaWg, analyzing physical concepts, thinking: The problem hinges on the Boltzmann distribution in LTE, which gives the ratio of populations in two energy levels i and j as n_j/n_i = (g_j/g_i) exp[–ΔE/(k_B T)]. Here ΔE≈1.38×10^(–23)\u2009J is the energy gap and k_B is Boltzmann’s constant. Since star\u20091’s excited-level population is twice that of star\u20092, we write 2 = exp[–ΔE/(k_B T_1)] / exp[–ΔE/(k_B T_2)] = exp[ΔE/k_B (1/T_2 – 1/T_1)]. Taking the natural log gives ln(2) = (ΔE/k_B) (1/T_2 – 1/T_1). Rearranging yields ln(2) = (T_1 – T_2)/(T_1 T_2) · (ΔE/k_B). Thus the key concepts are: 1) LTE so the Boltzmann law applies, 2) excitation ratio arises from e^(–ΔE/kT), 3) ln of that ratio relates the inverse temperatures, and 4) k_B is the conversion factor between energy and temperature scales.; answer: D)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent LJux, analyzing physical concepts, thinking: We first recall that under local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), the relative population of two atomic levels i and j in a gas at temperature T follows the Boltzmann distribution: ni/nj=(gi/gj)exp[−ΔE/(kT)], where ΔE is the energy difference between levels and k is Boltzmann’s constant.

The observed ratio of excited populations is R₁/R₂ = 2, so 2 = exp[–ΔE/(kT₁) + ΔE/(kT₂)] = exp[(ΔE/k)(1/T₂ – 1/T₁)].  \n4. Taking the natural logarithm gives ln(2) = (ΔE/k)(1/T₂ – 1/T₁).  \n5. Rewrite 1/T₂ – 1/T₁ = (T₁ – T₂)/(T₁\u2009T₂).  \n6. If ΔE/k is absorbed into the normalization implied by the answer choices, the relation becomes ln(2) = (T₁ – T₂)/(T₁\u2009T₂).  \n7. This exactly matches choice D: ln(2) = (T₁ – T₂)/(T₁\u2009T₂).; answer: D)\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent 4k17, round 0, evaluating candidate equations, thinking: 1. Under LTE, the relative population of excited to ground states at temperature T follows the Boltzmann factor: n_exc/n_low ∝ exp(−ΔE/(kT)).\n2. For star₁ at T₁: R₁ = exp(−ΔE/(kT₁)); for star₂ at T₂: R₂ = exp(−ΔE/(kT₂)).\n3. The observed ratio R₁/R₂ = 2, so 2 = exp[−ΔE/(kT₁) + ΔE/(kT₂)] = exp[(ΔE/k)(1/T₂ − 1/T₁)].\n4. Taking natural logarithm yields ln(2) = (ΔE/k)(1/T₂ − 1/T₁).\n5. Rewrite 1/T₂ − 1/T₁ as (T₁ − T₂)/(T₁T₂). Thus ln(2) = (ΔE/k)·(T₁ − T₂)/(T₁T₂).\n6. The answer choices absorb the factor ΔE/k into their form, so the correct algebraic relationship is ln(2) = (T₁ − T₂)/(T₁T₂), which matches choice D.\n7. Choices A, B, C do not reproduce the derived form; only D correctly captures the difference over the product of temperatures.; answer: D)\n<SEPERATOR>\nFinal Decision agent, calculating final output, thinking: 1. Under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state to a lower state at temperature T follows the Boltzmann distribution: n_exc/n_low ∝ exp(–ΔE/(kT)).\n2. For star_1 at T₁: R₁ = exp(–ΔE/(kT₁)); for star_2 at T₂: R₂ = exp(–ΔE/(kT₂)).\n3. The observed excitation ratio is R₁/R₂ = 2, so:\n   2 = exp[–ΔE/(kT₁) + ΔE/(kT₂)] = exp[(ΔE/k)(1/T₂ – 1/T₁)].\n4. Taking the natural logarithm gives:\n   ln(2) = (ΔE/k)(1/T₂ – 1/T₁).\n5. Algebraically, 1/T₂ – 1/T₁ = (T₁ – T₂)/(T₁ T₂).\n6. The constant factor ΔE/k is a known numeric ratio (1.38×10⁻²³ J divided by Boltzmann’s constant), and the answer choices absorb that factor into their form.\n7.
