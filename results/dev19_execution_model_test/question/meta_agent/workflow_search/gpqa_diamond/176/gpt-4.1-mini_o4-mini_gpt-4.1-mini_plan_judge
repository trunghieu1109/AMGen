Question: Example(question='Astronomers are interested in the luminosities of two stars. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2. The mass of Star_1 is also larger by the same factor (1.5 times). Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same. Astronomers also calculated the radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:', choice1='~2.25', choice2='~2.35', choice3='~2.32', choice4='~2.23\n', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: 1. For a star radiating as a black body, luminosity L is given by the Stefan–Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴. 2. The ratio of luminosities of Star_1 to Star_2 is L₁/L₂ = (R₁/R₂)²×(T₁/T₂)⁴. 3. Wien’s displacement law (λ_max·T = constant) and the problem statement of identical peak wavelengths imply the two stars have the same surface temperature (T₁ = T₂), so (T₁/T₂)⁴ = 1. 4. The given radius ratio is R₁/R₂ = 1.5, hence (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25. 5. Comparing the computed value 2.25 to the multiple-choice options (~2.25, ~2.35, ~2.32, ~2.23), the exact match is ~2.25. 6. The radial velocity difference (700 km/s) only affects observed wavelengths via Doppler shift, which has been corrected to give identical intrinsic peak wavelengths; it does not change the intrinsic luminosity ratio. 7. The mass ratio likewise does not enter the black-body luminosity formula once R and T are specified. Therefore, the closest choice is A).
