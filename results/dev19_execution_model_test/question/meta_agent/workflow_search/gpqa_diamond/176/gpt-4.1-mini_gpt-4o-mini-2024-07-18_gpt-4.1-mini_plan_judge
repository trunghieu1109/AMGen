proposed answer: To determine the luminosity ratio of Star_1 to Star_2, we apply the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the luminosity (L) of a black body is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature (T) and the square of its radius (R). Since both stars have the same peak wavelength from spectroscopy, we conclude they have the same effective surface temperature (T1 = T2). Therefore, the temperature factor cancels out when calculating the luminosity ratio. The radius of Star_1 is given as 1.5 times that of Star_2 (R1 = 1.5 * R2). Thus, the luminosity ratio can be simplified to L1/L2 = (R1/R2)² = (1.5)² = 2.25. The radial velocities of the stars do not influence this intrinsic luminosity calculation, as they pertain to the motion of the stars rather than their emitted radiation properties. Therefore, the conclusion that the luminosity of Star_1 exceeds that of Star_2 by a factor of approximately 2.25 is consistent with the principles of black body radiation. Among the provided choices (~2.23, ~2.25, ~2.32, ~2.35), the closest matching factor is ~2.25. Hence, the final answer is A.

proposed answer: To determine the luminosity ratio of Star_1 to Star_2, we apply the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the luminosity (L) of a black body is given by L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius and T is the temperature. Given that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2, we express the radius ratio as R1/R2 = 1.5. Both stars having the same peak wavelength suggests they have the same temperature; however, the radial velocity of Star_2 indicates it is moving away, which affects its observed temperature (it experiences a redshift). This suggests that Star_2's effective temperature is lower than that of Star_1. Therefore, we denote T1 as the temperature of Star_1 and T2 as the temperature of Star_2, with T1 > T2 due to the redshift effect on Star_2. The luminosity ratio can be expressed as L1/L2 = (R1²T1⁴)/(R2²T2⁴). Substituting R1 = 1.5R2 yields L1/L2 = (1.5²R2²T1⁴)/(R2²T2⁴) = 2.25(T1/T2)⁴. Given that T1 is greater than T2, we need to estimate the temperature ratio (T1/T2). Assuming T1/T2 is slightly greater than 1 leads to a luminosity ratio that exceeds 2.25. Among the provided choices (~2.23, ~2.25, ~2.32, ~2.35), the most reasonable estimate for the luminosity ratio, considering the expected temperature difference due to the redshift, is approximately 2.32, which aligns with both the calculations and astrophysical expectations. Therefore, I conclude that the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of approximately 2.32.
