Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_10_176
proposed answer: The problem involves determining the luminosity ratio of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, assuming they radiate as black bodies. The key information is that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2, and both stars have the same peak wavelength, implying equal surface temperatures due to Wien's displacement law. The luminosity of a black body is given by L = 4πR^2σT^4. Since the temperatures are equal, the luminosity ratio depends solely on the square of the radius ratio, which is (1.5)^2 = 2.25. The radial velocities affect observed wavelengths due to the Doppler effect but do not influence intrinsic luminosity. The mass of the stars is not relevant to the luminosity calculation in this context. Therefore, the correct factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 is 2.25. Considering the provided choices, the closest numerical factor is ~2.25, which corresponds to choice A.

proposed answer: The problem involves determining the luminosity ratio between two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, given that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2 and both stars have the same peak wavelength. The same peak wavelength implies equal surface temperatures according to Wien's Law. The luminosity of a star radiating as a black body is given by L = 4πR²σT⁴. Since the temperatures are equal, the luminosity ratio depends on the square of the radius ratio: L1/L2 = (R1/R2)² = (1.5)² = 2.25. The radial velocity of Star_2 is 700 km/s, which could cause a Doppler shift, but the problem states that the wavelengths are the same, indicating that any Doppler shift has been accounted for and the intrinsic temperatures are indeed equal. The mass ratio does not directly affect the luminosity calculation as it does not enter the black body luminosity formula. Therefore, the calculated luminosity ratio is 2.25, which matches choice A) ~2.25. All agents agree on this conclusion, and the reasoning is consistent with the given information and the principles of black body radiation.
