proposed answer: To determine the maximum speed v_max of a one-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator, we analyze the energy conservation principles. The potential energy at maximum displacement A is given by PE = (1/2)kA^2. In relativistic dynamics, the total energy of the mass m moving at speed v is expressed as E = mc^2 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)). At maximum displacement, this potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, leading to the equation: (1/2)kA^2 = mc^2 / sqrt(1 - (v_max^2/c^2)). Rearranging this equation allows us to express v_max in terms of k, A, m, and c. We need to ensure that the resulting expression respects the condition v_max < c, which is a fundamental aspect of relativistic physics. After comparing the derived expression with the provided candidate formulas, choice B stands out because it incorporates the necessary relativistic corrections and maintains the condition for maximum speed under relativistic dynamics. Therefore, the correct expression for the maximum speed of the relativistic harmonic oscillator is encapsulated in choice B.
