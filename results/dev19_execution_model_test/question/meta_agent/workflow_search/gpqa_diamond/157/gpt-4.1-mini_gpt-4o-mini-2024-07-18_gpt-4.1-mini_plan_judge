Question: Example(question='In an inactive state, a transcription factor subunit awaits an activation signal from the membrane phosphorylation cascade. Upon phosphorylation on the Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, shuttles into the nucleus, and serves in gene transcription. A missense mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. You observe that a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Which of the following molecular phenotypes is most likely observed in the presence of mutation Y?', choice1='loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype', choice2='protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype', choice3='protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele', choice4='change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: Mutation Y is a heterozygous dominant-negative mutation in the dimerization domain of the transcription factor. This means that even with one wild-type allele present, the mutation can disrupt the normal function of the transcription factor. Dimerization is essential for the transcription factor to translocate to the nucleus and activate gene transcription. The dominant-negative effect of mutation Y suggests that it interferes with the dimerization process, potentially preventing the formation of functional dimers or leading to the formation of nonfunctional complexes. This interference is likely to result in a loss of function of the transcription factor, as the presence of the mutant protein can prevent the wild-type protein from functioning properly. The provided answer choices include various molecular phenotypes, but given the dominant-negative nature of mutation Y, the most likely observed phenotype is 'protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype'. This is because the mutant protein may aggregate with the wild-type protein, forming complexes that cannot fulfill their transcriptional role, thus leading to a loss of function. Therefore, the most consistent and likely molecular phenotype in the presence of mutation Y is 'protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype'.
