Question: Example(question='In an inactive state, a transcription factor subunit awaits an activation signal from the membrane phosphorylation cascade. Upon phosphorylation on the Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, shuttles into the nucleus, and serves in gene transcription. A missense mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. You observe that a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Which of the following molecular phenotypes is most likely observed in the presence of mutation Y?', choice1='loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype', choice2='protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype', choice3='protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele', choice4='change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: Mutation Y is a heterozygous dominant-negative mutation in the dimerization domain of a transcription factor. Dominant-negative mutations typically result in the mutant protein interfering with the function of the wild-type protein. In this case, the mutation affects the dimerization domain, which is crucial for the transcription factor to form functional dimers. The dominant-negative effect suggests that the mutant protein can still bind to the wild-type protein but disrupts its function. This often leads to the formation of nonfunctional complexes or aggregates, as the mutant protein forms dimers with the wild-type protein but prevents the complex from functioning correctly. Therefore, the most likely molecular phenotype is 'protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype' because the mutant protein aggregates with the wild-type protein, rendering the dimer nonfunctional and leading to a loss of function. This reasoning aligns with the consensus among the debate agents who also concluded that option B is the most consistent with the dominant-negative nature of mutation Y.
