proposed answer: The Hamiltonian operator is given by H = ε σ·n, where σ represents the Pauli matrices and n is a unit vector. The operator σ·n has eigenvalues of ±1 because the Pauli matrices are known to have these eigenvalues when acting on a two-dimensional spin-1/2 system. When we multiply these eigenvalues by the constant ε, we scale these eigenvalues by ε. Therefore, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian H will be ±ε. The choices presented in the question include various forms of eigenvalues; however, the correct interpretation leads us to the conclusion that the eigenvalues are indeed ±ε, aligning with the first choice. Other options involving factors of ħ or different scaling do not apply to the direct Hamiltonian form presented, as the Pauli matrices are typically treated as dimensionless in this context. Thus, the correct answer is A) +ε, -ε.
