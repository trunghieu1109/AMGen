proposed answer: The Hamiltonian operator is given by H = ε σ ⋅ n, where ε is a constant with dimensions of energy, σ is the vector of Pauli matrices, and n is a unit vector. The Pauli matrices are 2x2 Hermitian matrices with eigenvalues ±1. The dot product σ ⋅ n is a Hermitian operator with eigenvalues ±1 because n is a unit vector. Therefore, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are obtained by multiplying the eigenvalues of σ ⋅ n by ε, resulting in ±ε. The choices involving ħ/2 are incorrect because they imply a scaling that is not present in the given Hamiltonian. The eigenvalues of the operator σ ⋅ n are ±1, and the Hamiltonian scales these by ε, resulting in eigenvalues ±ε. Since the problem uses σ directly, there is no ħ/2 factor in the eigenvalues. Therefore, the correct choice is A).
