Question: Example(question='While designing a high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating at an accelerating voltage of 1000 kV, Mike connected vacuum pumps to create an ultra-high vacuum state (< 10^-9 Torr) in the sample compartment, aiming to minimize the presence of gas molecules for improved electron microscopy. However, as expected, some gas particles remained inside the compartment, as detected by the mass spectrometer. Mike accurately determined the mean free path of these gas molecules in the vacuum state (< 10^-9 Torr) to be λ1, based on factors such as sample compartment volume, pressure, and temperature. However, upon initiating the electron beam, he made an intriguing observation concerning the mean free path based on electron scattering with the gas molecules. He found that the mean free path was no longer equal to λ1; rather, it was λ2, even though the sample compartment temperature remained the same.\n\nWhat can we conclude about λ2 based on the aforementioned scenario?', choice1="λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation", choice2='λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1', choice3='λ2 < λ1', choice4='λ2 >= 1.22*λ1', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: We compare two mean free paths in the same residual gas at fixed density n:
1. Gas–gas mean free path: λ1=1/(√2·n·σ_mm).
2. Electron–gas mean free path: λ2=1/(n·σ_em).
Take the ratio:
  λ2/λ1 = [1/(n·σ_em)] / [1/(√2·n·σ_mm)] = √2·(σ_mm/σ_em).
Physical data: σ_mm (gas–gas) is on the order of 10⁻¹⁹–10⁻²⁰ m², while σ_em at 1 MeV is much smaller, ~10⁻²²–10⁻²¹ m². Thus σ_mm/σ_em ≫1, making λ2/λ1 ≫√2≈1.414.
Even in the extreme limit σ_em≈σ_mm, the ratio is √2≈1.414, which already exceeds 1.22. Therefore in all cases λ2≥1.414·λ1, and certainly λ2≥1.22·λ1.
No realistic scenario can give λ2<1.22·λ1, so the correct conclusion is λ2≥1.22·λ1.
