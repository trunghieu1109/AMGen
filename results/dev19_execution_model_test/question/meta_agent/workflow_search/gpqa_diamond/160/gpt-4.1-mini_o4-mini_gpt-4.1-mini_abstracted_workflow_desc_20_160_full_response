System parameters:\n   - Instrument: High-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM).\n   - Accelerating voltage: 1000 kV.\n\n2.

When the electron beam is on, the relevant mean free path λ2 refers to electron–molecule scattering: λ2=1/(n·σe)·(ve/⟨vrel⟩electron–molecule). Since electrons at 1000\u2009kV are extremely fast, ⟨vrel⟩≈ve, so λ2≈1/(n·σe). If σe≈σ, then λ2≈√2·λ1≈1.414\u2009λ1, i.e. significantly larger than λ1. Even if the electron–molecule cross‐section differs somewhat from σ, the factor remains ≥√2/1.15≈1.22 under realistic conditions. Thus λ2>λ1 and indeed λ2≥1.22\u2009λ1 (choice D).; answer: D)\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent u6Rj, round 0, analyzing physical relationships, thinking: 1. Definition of mean free path (MFP): For gas molecules in vacuum, λ1=1/(nσ), where n is molecular number density, σ is collisional cross‐section.\n2. Initial λ1 is determined by gas‐gas collisions under <10⁻⁹ Torr, with fixed T.\n3. When the 1000 kV electron beam is turned on, electrons scatter off residual gas molecules, introducing additional collision channels beyond molecule‐molecule collisions.\n4. Effective collision frequency increases (ν_total = ν_gas–gas + ν_e–gas), so the effective MFP λ2= v/ν_total decreases relative to λ1, since ν_total>ν_gas–gas alone.\n5. Temperature constant ⇒ gas density constant, so gas–gas MFP unchanged. The observed decrease in MFP must stem from electron–gas scattering.\n6. Electron–gas scattering cross‐sections at keV energies are significant; thus λ2 < λ1.\n7. No evidence supports λ2≥λ1 or λ2>λ1 (choices A, B, D). Therefore the only consistent relation is λ2 < λ1.; answer: C)\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent WjQ6, round 0, analyzing physical relationships, thinking: We compare the mean free path of gas molecules under ultra‐high vacuum (λ1) to the effective mean free path for electrons scattering off these residual gas molecules (λ2).  \n1. λ1 is given by kinetic‐theory: λ1 = kT/(√2\u2009π\u2009d^2\u2009p), where d is the molecular diameter.  \n2. λ2 is set by electron–gas scattering: λ2 = 1/(n\u2009σ_e), where σ_e is the electron–molecule cross‐section.  \n3. Typical molecular collision cross‐sections (σ_m ≈πd^2) are on the order of 10^−19–10^−20\u2009m^2.  \n4. At 1\u2009MeV energies, electron–molecule scattering cross‐sections σ_e are much smaller (≈10^−22–10^−21\u2009m^2).  \n5. Since σ_e ≪σ_m, we have λ2 ≫λ1.  Even accounting for the √2 factor in λ1’s denominator, λ2 exceeds λ1 by well over 22%.  \nTherefore, λ2≥1.22\u2009λ1.; answer: D)\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent 5ub7, round 0, analyzing physical relationships, thinking: We are asked to compare the mean free path λ1 of gas molecules in ultra-high vacuum (determined by molecule–molecule collisions) with the mean free path λ2 that characterizes electron–gas scattering when the high-energy electron beam is switched on. Recall that mean free path λ is inversely proportional to the collision cross section σ (λ = 1/(nσ) for number density n). \n\n1. For gas molecules in UHV (<10⁻⁹ Torr) at room temperature, λ1 is set by the molecular diameter (σ_mm ≃ πd² with d∼0.3–0.4 nm). This yields λ1 on the order of meters.  \n\n2. When an energetic electron (1\u2009MeV) traverses the residual gas, the relevant cross section σ_em for electron–molecule scattering is much smaller than σ_mm, because electrons are point particles and interact via much weaker Coulomb/quantum interactions at high energy. Typical σ_em at 1\u2009MeV is orders of magnitude lower than molecular collision cross sections.  \n\n3. Since λ2 = 1/(nσ_em) and σ_em ≪ σ_mm, we have λ2 ≫ λ1. Thus λ2 must exceed λ1 by more than any modest factor (certainly exceeding 1.22×λ1).  \n\n4. Therefore the correct inequality is λ2 ≥ 1.22·λ1 (in fact λ2 can be orders of magnitude larger).  \n\nHence choice D) is the only consistent option.; answer: D)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent P98P, assessing electron beam impact and factor 1.22, thinking: 1. In ultra-high vacuum, the gas-molecule mean free path λ1 is given by λ1 = 1/(√2·n·σ_mm), where n is the residual gas number density and σ_mm is the molecule–molecule collision cross section.\n2. When the electron beam is on, electrons scatter off gas molecules with cross section σ_em, so the effective mean free path for electron–gas scattering is λ2 = 1/(n·σ_em).\n3. The ratio λ2/λ1 = (√2·σ_mm)/σ_em. Because high-energy electrons have a much smaller scattering cross section (σ_em ≪ σ_mm), this ratio is much greater than unity.\n4. Even conservative estimates (σ_mm/σ_em ≳ 1) give λ2/λ1 ≥ √2 ≈ 1.414, which comfortably exceeds the 1.22 threshold. Thus electrons travel at least ~22% farther on average before scattering.\n5. The factor 1.22 represents a minimal increase (22%) in mean free path if σ_em were only modestly smaller than σ_mm. In reality σ_em is orders of magnitude smaller, so λ2 ≥ 1.22·λ1.\n6. Therefore, the presence of the electron beam increases the effective mean free path compared to molecule–molecule scattering, leading to λ2 ≥ 1.22·λ1.; answer: D)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent qeVK, assessing electron beam impact and factor 1.22, thinking: 1.

Estimating the ratio:\n   - Even if σ_mm and σ_em differ by only an order of magnitude, σ_mm/σ_em ≥10.\n   - Thus λ2/λ1 ≥√2·10 ≈14.14≫1.22.\n   - In the most conservative case (σ_mm≈σ_em), λ2/λ1=√2≈1.414>1.22.\n\n5.

Conclusion:\n   The presence of the high-energy electron beam reduces the scattering cross section relative to molecule–molecule collisions, increasing the mean free path by at least the factor √2, which exceeds 1.22.

Ratio of mean free paths:\n   λ2/λ1 = [1/(n·σ_em)] / [1/(√2·n·σ_mm)] = √2·(σ_mm/σ_em).\n\n3. Typical cross sections:\n   - σ_mm (gas–gas) ≈10⁻¹⁹–10⁻²⁰\u2009m².\n   - σ_em (electron–gas at 1\u2009MeV) ≈10⁻²²–10⁻²¹\u2009m².\n   Thus σ_mm/σ_em is on the order of 10²–10³ or larger.\n\n4. Numerical estimate:\n   Even taking conservative values σ_mm/σ_em≈10², we get λ2/λ1≈√2·10²≈1.414·100≈141.4, which is≫1.22.\n\n5. Interpretation of the 1.22 factor:\n   - The smallest factor above unity often cited for distinguishing regimes of mean free path changes is ~√2≈1.414, but the problem’s 1.22 threshold is lower, so any realistic electron–molecule cross‐section ratio produces λ2≥1.22λ1.\n\n6.

Therefore in all cases λ2≥1.414·λ1, and certainly λ2≥1.22·λ1.\nNo realistic scenario can give λ2<1.22·λ1, so the correct conclusion is λ2≥1.22·λ1.; answer: D)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCritic agent poK5, providing feedback, thinking: The reasoning correctly shows that the electron–gas scattering cross section σ_em at 1\u2009MeV is orders of magnitude smaller than the gas–gas collision cross section σ_mm, so that λ2/λ1 = √2·(σ_mm/σ_em) ≫ √2 ≈ 1.414, and therefore λ2 ≥ 1.22 λ1 (in fact λ2 ≫ λ1). \n\nLimitations of the solution:\n1. It uses rough orders of magnitude for σ_mm and σ_em; actual values depend strongly on the gas species and electron energy.  \n2. It assumes isotropic elastic scattering and ignores inelastic processes and energy-loss–dependent cross sections, which can change the effective mean free path.  \n3. It treats λ1 and λ2 as purely collision-limited, neglecting angular acceptance of the microscope (large-angle vs small-angle scattering).  \n4. It neglects possible space-charge effects or beam-induced desorption that could alter the residual gas density during operation.  \n\nDespite these caveats, the conclusion λ2 ≥ 1.22 λ1 is robust under typical TEM conditions.; answer: True', iteration_idx=0)]
