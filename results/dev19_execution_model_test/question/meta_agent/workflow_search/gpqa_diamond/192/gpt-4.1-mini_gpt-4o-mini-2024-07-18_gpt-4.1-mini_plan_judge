Question: Example(question='In a specific region of the sky, astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?', choice1='~ r^2', choice2='~ r^4', choice3='~ r^3', choice4='~ r^5', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: To determine how the number of stars changes with distance (r), we start from the relationship that the number of stars varies with parallax (plx) as 1/plx^5. Since parallax is inversely related to distance (plx ~ 1/r), we can rewrite the star count relation in terms of distance. Substituting plx with 1/r leads to stars ~ 1/(1/r)^5 = r^5, indicating that the number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance. However, to find the number of stars per unit distance interval, we must account for how a change in distance relates to a change in parallax. The differential relationship is given by dplx = -1/r^2 * dr, which indicates how a small change in distance corresponds to a change in parallax. The Jacobian of the transformation, |dplx/dr|, is 1/r^2. Therefore, the number of stars per unit distance interval becomes stars ~ r^5 * |dplx/dr| = r^5 * (1/r^2) = r^3. This shows that the number of stars per unit distance interval increases with the cube of the distance. Hence, the derived expression for the number of stars per unit distance interval is ~ r^3, which is consistent with the relationship derived from the original parallax relation. Therefore, the correct answer is C, as it reflects the derived relationship accurately.
