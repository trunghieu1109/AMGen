The observable P is symmetric with eigenvalues λ satisfying det(P−λI)=0. Compute det: |−λ,1/√2,0;1/√2,−λ,1/√2;0,1/√2,−λ| = −λ(λ²−1)=0, so eigenvalues λ=0,±1. 3. Find the eigenspace for λ=0: solve P v=0 ⇒ (1/√2)v₂=0 ⇒ v₂=0; and (1/√2)v₁+(1/√2)v₃=0 ⇒ v₃=−v₁. A basis vector is (1,0,−1). Normalize it to |v₀⟩ = (1/√2)(1,0,−1). 4. Compute the projection amplitude c = ⟨v₀|ψₙ⟩ = (1/√2,0,−1/√2)·(−1/√6,2/√6,1/√6) = (1/√12)(−1−1) = −2/√12 = −1/√3. 5. The probability of measuring λ=0 is |c|² = (1/√3)² = 1/3.

Projects the normalized state onto this eigenvector and squares the amplitude to get |⟨v₀|ψ⟩|²=1/3.\n\nLimitations to note:\n– Assumes the initial state need only be normalized up to a global phase (which does not affect probabilities).\n– Assumes P is Hermitian with nondegenerate eigenspace for λ=0 (true here, but should be stated).\n– Sign choices for eigenvectors are arbitrary and do not affect the final probability.\n– Works in the standard basis without explicit justification, though that is customary.\n\nDespite these assumptions, the logical steps are valid and the result is correct.; answer: True\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent URRd, finalizing probability and matching choices, thinking: Step 1: Normalize the given state vector |ψ⟩ = (–1,2,1)ᵀ. Its norm squared is (–1)² + 2² + 1² = 6, so the normalized state is |ψₙ⟩ = (1/√6)(–1,2,1).  \n\nStep 2: Find the eigenvalues of P by solving det(P – λI) = 0. For P = [[0,1/√2,0],[1/√2,0,1/√2],[0,1/√2,0]], we get characteristic equation –λ(λ² – 1) = 0, so eigenvalues are λ = 0, +1, –1.  \n\nStep 3: Determine the eigenspace for λ = 0 by solving P v = 0. This gives v₂ = 0 and v₃ = –v₁. A basis vector is (1,0,–1).
