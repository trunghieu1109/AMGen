Question: Example(question='The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1). An observable of the system is represented by the matrix operator P having elements in the first row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0),  in the second row as (1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}) and in the third row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0). Calculate the probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 at time t.', choice1='1/3\n', choice2='2/3\n', choice3='\\sqrt{2/3}\n', choice4='1', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: 1. Normalize the state vector |ψ⟩ = (−1,2,1)ᵀ. Its squared norm is (−1)²+2²+1² = 6, so |ψₙ⟩ = (−1/√6, 2/√6, 1/√6).
2. Find the eigenvalues of P by solving det(P – λI) = 0 for P = [[0,1/√2,0],[1/√2,0,1/√2],[0,1/√2,0]]. The characteristic equation is −λ(λ² − 1) = 0, giving λ = 0, ±1.
3. Determine the eigenspace for λ = 0 by solving P v = 0. This yields v₂ = 0 and v₃ = −v₁. An unnormalized eigenvector is (1,0,−1), which normalized is |v₀⟩ = (1/√2)(1,0,−1).
4. Compute the projection amplitude c = ⟨v₀|ψₙ⟩ = (1/√2)(−1/√6) + 0 + (−1/√2)(1/√6) = −2/√12 = −1/√3.
5. The probability is |c|² = (1/√3)² = 1/3.
6. Matching this result to the given choices, choice A) is 1/3.
