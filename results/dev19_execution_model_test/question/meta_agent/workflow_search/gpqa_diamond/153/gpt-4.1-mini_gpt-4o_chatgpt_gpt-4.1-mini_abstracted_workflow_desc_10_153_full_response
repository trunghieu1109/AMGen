The mass spectrometry data with a molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 and a peak at m/z = 158 suggests the presence of a chlorine atom, which is consistent with the isotopic pattern of chlorine (35Cl and 37Cl). This indicates the molecular weight is 156, and the compound likely contains one chlorine atom. \n2. The IR spectrum shows a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1, which is characteristic of O-H stretching, likely from a carboxylic acid group. The strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 is typical of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, which is consistent with a carboxylic acid. \n3.
