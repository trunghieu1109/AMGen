proposed answer: Step 1: Determine molecular weight and presence of chlorine. The mass spectrum shows a molecular ion peak at m/z 156 (100%) and a companion peak at m/z 158 (32%). A 3:1 intensity ratio is characteristic of one chlorine atom (³⁵Cl/³⁷Cl), giving a molecular formula of C₇H₅ClO₂ (MW = 156).

Step 2: Identify functional groups by IR. A broad absorption from 3500–2700 cm⁻¹ indicates a hydrogen-bonded O–H stretch of a carboxylic acid, and a strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the C=O stretch of a carboxylic acid carbonyl.

Step 3: Analyze the ¹H NMR data. A singlet at 11.0 ppm integrating to 1H is characteristic of the acidic proton of –COOH. Two aromatic doublets at 8.02 ppm (2H) and 7.72 ppm (2H), each coupling only to each other (A₂B₂ pattern), indicate a para-disubstituted benzene ring with two sets of equivalent protons.

Step 4: Evaluate candidate structures:
 A) 4-Chlorobenzoic acid: C₇H₅ClO₂, Cl and COOH para to each other. This gives two equivalent pairs of aromatic protons (A₂B₂), a COOH singlet at 11 ppm, IR carboxylic acid signals, and the correct MW/isotope pattern.
 B) 2-Chlorobenzoic acid: ortho substitution yields four inequivalent aromatic protons with complex coupling, not two simple doublets.
 C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde: has an aldehyde (CHO proton ~9–10 ppm) and a phenolic OH, three distinct aromatic protons—does not match the acid IR or the A₂B₂ pattern.
 D) Phenyl chloroformate: an ester lacking a COOH O–H and an acid C=O stretch at 1720 cm⁻¹; NMR would differ.

Conclusion: Only 4-chlorobenzoic acid (choice A) satisfies the MS (156/158 Cl isotope), IR (broad acid O–H, strong C=O), and NMR (acidic singlet + A₂B₂ aromatic pattern).
