Question: Example(question='There has been an outbreak of an viral infectious disease in your city. You have been asked to design a molecular diagnostic kit for quick detection of this retrovirus. How would you go about designing this kit?', choice1='First you identify the virus by performing DNA sequencing. You then develop a PCR kit for  quick and accurate diagnosis', choice2='First you identify the IgG antibodies for the infection. You then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG antibodies for quick \n and accurate diagnosis.', choice3='First you identify the virus using the information about the symptoms, provided by the affected patients. You then design a nested PCR kit based on the information for quick diagnosis.', choice4='First you identify the virus by performing cDNA sequencing.  You then develop a real time PCR kit for quick and accurate diagnosis.', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: To synthesize and select the optimal molecular diagnostic kit design for the retrovirus outbreak, we need to evaluate the options based on sensitivity, specificity, feasibility, and speed. Retroviruses have RNA genomes that are reverse transcribed into DNA, so the diagnostic method must account for this. Real-time PCR (choice D) is highly sensitive and specific because it targets the viral genetic material directly and can quantify the viral load. It is also rapid, providing results quickly, which is crucial in an outbreak scenario. ELISA (choice B) detects antibodies, which may not be present early in infection, reducing sensitivity for early detection. Nested PCR (choice C) is sensitive but involves a two-step process, making it slower and more prone to contamination. Real-time PCR is feasible in well-equipped labs and can be adapted for high-throughput testing. Considering these factors, choice D (cDNA sequencing followed by real-time PCR) is optimal for quick, accurate detection of the retrovirus. It balances high sensitivity and specificity with feasibility and speed, making it suitable for outbreak scenarios where rapid and reliable detection is crucial.
