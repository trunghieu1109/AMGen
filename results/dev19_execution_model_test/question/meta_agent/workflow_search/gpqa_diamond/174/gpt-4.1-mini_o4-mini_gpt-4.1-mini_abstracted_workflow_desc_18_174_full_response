An oscillating spheroidal charge distribution centered at the origin has zero net electric dipole moment, so the lowest nonzero radiation multipole is the electric quadrupole (ℓ=2).\n2.

To find the maximum radiated power A, locate the maximum of F(θ): dF/dθ=0 gives θ=45°, and F(45°)=(√2/2)^4=1/4. Thus A∝1/4.\n5.

Quadrupole radiation has an angular distribution dP/dΩ ∝ sin^2θ · cos^2θ.  \n3. To find the maximum A, set derivative w.r.t. θ to zero: the maximum occurs at θ=45°, giving f_max ∝ (sin45°)^2·(cos45°)^2 = (√2/2)^4 = 1/4.  \n4.

In electromagnetic radiation from an oscillating charge distribution, one expands the fields in multipoles indexed by ℓ (dipole ℓ=1, quadrupole ℓ=2, etc.).  \n2. The total radiated power per unit solid angle for an ℓ-pole scales as ω^(2ℓ+2) times an angular factor of θ.  \n3. For an oscillating spheroidal distribution about a fixed center, the net electric dipole moment vanishes (no ℓ=1 term).  \n4.
