Question: Example(question='Consider an oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis). Because it oscillates, it would radiate at a wavelength \\lambda. In the radiation zone, the radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of \\lambda and the angle \\theta (with z-axis), along which the power is measured. If the maximum power thus radiated is A, the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle \\theta = 30^0 and a possible form of f are, respectively,', choice1='1/2, \\lambda^(-4)', choice2='3/4, \\lambda^(-6)', choice3='1/4, \\lambda^(-4)', choice4='1/4, \\lambda^(-3)', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: 1. An oscillating spheroidal charge distribution centered at the origin has zero net electric dipole moment, so the lowest nonzero radiation multipole is the electric quadrupole (ℓ=2).
2. The power radiated per unit solid angle for an electric quadrupole varies as ω^(2ℓ+2)=ω^6 times an angular factor F(θ).
3. The angular dependence for quadrupole radiation is F(θ)=sin^2θ·cos^2θ.
4. To find the maximum radiated power A, locate the maximum of F(θ): dF/dθ=0 gives θ=45°, and F(45°)=(√2/2)^4=1/4. Thus A∝1/4.
5. At θ=30°, F(30°)=(sin30°)^2·(cos30°)^2=(1/2)^2·(√3/2)^2=1/4·3/4=3/16.
6. The fraction of the maximum at θ=30° is (3/16)/(1/4)=3/4.
7. Since ω=2πc/λ, ω^6 ∝λ^(-6), giving the power law dependence λ^(-6).
8. Matching the fraction 3/4 with the λ^(-6) dependence corresponds to choice B).
