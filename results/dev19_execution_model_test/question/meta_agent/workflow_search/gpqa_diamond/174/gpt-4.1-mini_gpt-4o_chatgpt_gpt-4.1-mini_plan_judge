proposed answer: The problem involves determining the fraction of maximum power radiated at an angle θ = 30° and identifying the correct wavelength dependence for the radiation pattern of an oscillating spheroidal charge distribution. The symmetry axis is along the z-axis, and the radiation pattern is axisymmetric about this axis. In classical electrodynamics, the radiation pattern for a dipole-like oscillation is typically described by an angular dependence of sin^2(θ), which means the power is maximum at θ = 90° and zero at θ = 0° and 180°. This pattern is consistent with the expected behavior of dipole radiation. The function g(θ) is normalized such that its maximum value is 1. At θ = 30°, g(30°) = sin^2(30°) = (1/2)^2 = 1/4. The wavelength dependence for dipole radiation is typically λ^(-4), consistent with the Larmor formula for radiation from an oscillating dipole. Therefore, the functional form is f(λ, θ) = sin^2(θ) * λ^(-4). The fraction of maximum power radiated at θ = 30° is g(30°) = 1/4. This analysis leads to the choice C) 1/4, λ^(-4), which corresponds to the expected behavior of dipole radiation from an oscillating spheroidal charge distribution. All agents agree on this conclusion, and the reasoning is consistent with classical electrodynamics principles.

proposed answer: The problem involves an oscillating spheroidal charge distribution with its symmetry axis along the z-axis, suggesting an axisymmetric radiation pattern. The most consistent multipole moment identified is the electric dipole moment, which typically exhibits a λ^(-4) dependence in the radiation pattern. For a dipole, the angular dependence of the radiated power is given by the function g(θ) = sin^2(θ), which is characteristic of dipole radiation and is symmetric about the z-axis. This function achieves its maximum value of 1 at θ = 90°, thus ensuring the normalization condition max_θ g(θ) = 1. Given this angular dependence, we evaluate g(30°) = sin^2(30°) = (1/2)^2 = 1/4. Therefore, the fraction of the maximum power A radiated at θ = 30° is 1/4, consistent with choice C. The λ-dependence of λ^(-4) aligns with the typical behavior of dipole radiation, supporting the choice of C) 1/4, λ^(-4). Thus, considering the angular function and wavelength dependence, the correct choice is C.
