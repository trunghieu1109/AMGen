proposed answer: To determine how many stars are detectable using the ESPRESSO spectrograph with a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure, we need to calculate the apparent magnitudes of each star based on their absolute magnitudes and distances. The distance modulus formula is used: m = M + 5 * (log10(d) - 1). The stars to analyze are: 1) Canopus, 2) Polaris, 3) Star at 10 pc (M = 15), 4) Star at 200 pc (M = 15), 5) Star at 5 pc (M = 15), and 6) Star at 50 pc (M = 15). 

1. **Canopus**: Absolute magnitude is approximately -5.5. It is very bright and likely detectable, suggesting a high S/N ratio. 

2. **Polaris**: Absolute magnitude is about -3.6, and it is approximately 132 pc away. The apparent magnitude is calculated as m = -3.6 + 5 * (log10(132) - 1) = 2.0, which is well above the threshold for S/N, making it easily detectable. 

3. **Star at 10 pc (M = 15)**: The apparent magnitude is m = 15 + 5 * (log10(10) - 1) = 15. This is at the threshold of detectability, potentially achieving an S/N of around 10. 

4. **Star at 200 pc (M = 15)**: The apparent magnitude is m = 15 + 5 * (log10(200) - 1) = 21.5, which is too faint for detection, resulting in an S/N significantly less than 10. 

5. **Star at 5 pc (M = 15)**: The apparent magnitude is m = 15 + 5 * (log10(5) - 1) = 13.5, which should provide a sufficient S/N ratio greater than 10 during a 1-hour exposure. 

6. **Star at 50 pc (M = 15)**: The apparent magnitude is m = 15 + 5 * (log10(50) - 1) = 18.5, which is also too faint, resulting in an S/N ratio below 10. 

In summary, the stars that are likely detectable with S/N â‰¥ 10 are Canopus, Polaris, and the star at 5 pc. The star at 10 pc is at the edge of detectability, while the others are too faint. Therefore, the conclusion is that 3 stars are detectable, aligning with choice B.
