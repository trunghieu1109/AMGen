proposed answer: To determine which particle is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry, we analyze the nature of each particle: 

1. Magnon: Magnons are quasiparticles that arise in magnetically ordered systems, such as ferromagnets. They represent collective excitations of the spin system and are associated with the spontaneous breaking of spin rotational symmetry. Therefore, magnons are indeed associated with spontaneously-broken symmetry.

2. Skyrmion: Skyrmions are topological solitons that can exist in various contexts, including condensed matter systems like magnetic materials. They are characterized by nontrivial topology rather than arising directly from spontaneous symmetry breaking. While they can exist in systems with broken symmetries, their existence is more about topological protection rather than being a direct consequence of spontaneous symmetry breaking. Thus, skyrmions are not necessarily associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry in the same way that Nambu-Goldstone bosons are.

3. Pion: In the context of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), pions are understood as Nambu-Goldstone bosons resulting from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry. This is a classic example of spontaneously-broken symmetry leading to the emergence of particles. Therefore, pions are definitely associated with spontaneously-broken symmetry.

4. Phonon: Phonons are quantized lattice vibrations and arise due to the periodic structure of a crystal lattice. They are associated with the breaking of continuous translational symmetry by the lattice, which is a form of spontaneous symmetry breaking. Thus, phonons are also associated with spontaneously-broken symmetry.

Based on this analysis, the particle that is not primarily associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry is the Skyrmion. Skyrmions are more about topological characteristics rather than being a direct result of symmetry breaking, unlike the other particles listed.
