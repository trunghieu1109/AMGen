proposed answer: To evaluate the four candidate formulae for the mass squared of the pseudo-Goldstone boson H_2, we need to analyze each option based on the principles of radiative corrections in quantum field theory. The contributions to the mass squared must reflect the correct signs and include all relevant particles. The first formula (choice 1) includes contributions from various bosons (M_{h_1}, M_W, M_Z, M_{H^{±}}, M_{H^0}, M_{A^0}) and a negative contribution from the sum of the fourth powers of the singlet fermion masses M_{N_i}. This aligns with the expectation that bosons contribute positively and fermions negatively to the mass corrections. The normalization factor of 8π²(x² + v²) is crucial as it ensures that the mass squared is appropriately scaled by the vacuum expectation values of the fields involved. The second formula (choice 2) omits the contribution from M_{H^{±}} and includes a negative contribution from M_t instead, which may not be consistent depending on the model specifics. The third formula (choice 3) includes both M_t and M_{H^{±}} but adds a positive contribution from M_{A^0}, which may not be justified. Finally, the fourth formula (choice 4) changes the normalization factor, which can lead to inconsistencies. Therefore, the first choice remains the most consistent with theoretical expectations and the principles of radiative corrections. Thus, I conclude that choice 1 is the best approximation for the mass of the pseudo-Goldstone boson H_2 through radiative corrections.

proposed answer: To critically evaluate the four candidate formulae for the pseudo-Goldstone boson mass squared, we need to analyze each choice based on the contributions from various particles and ensure that the signs and normalization factors are correctly applied. The contributions should include: 

1. **Gauge Bosons**: W and Z bosons contribute positively to the mass squared. 
2. **Scalar Bosons**: Charged Higgs (H±), neutral Higgs (H0), and pseudoscalar (A0) also contribute positively. 
3. **Top Quark**: The top quark contributes negatively due to its coupling to the scalar fields. 
4. **Singlet Fermions**: These contribute negatively as well. 

Now, let's evaluate each choice:

- **Choice 1**: Lacks the top quark mass term, which is crucial for the negative contribution. This makes it incomplete.
- **Choice 2**: Includes the top quark mass term but incorrectly assigns a positive contribution to it. This is a significant error as the top quark should contribute negatively.
- **Choice 3**: Includes both the top quark and singlet fermion contributions, but it also incorrectly includes a positive contribution from the top quark. This is also incorrect.
- **Choice 4**: Has the correct normalization but does not include the top quark mass term, which is essential for a complete expression.

Given these evaluations, none of the choices are fully correct. However, if I must select the one that is closest to being correct, it would be **Choice 2** as it at least attempts to include the top quark mass term, despite the sign error. Therefore, I will select **Choice A** as it is the most comprehensive in terms of particle contributions, reflecting the importance of including all relevant contributions, particularly the top quark's negative contribution, which is significant in the context of radiative corrections.
