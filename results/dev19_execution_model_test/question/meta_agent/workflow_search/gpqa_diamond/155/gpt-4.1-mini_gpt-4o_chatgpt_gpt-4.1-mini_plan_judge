proposed answer: The problem involves the stereospecific epoxidation of (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene using mCPBA. This results in two diastereomeric epoxides: a trans-epoxide from (E)-oct-4-ene and a cis-epoxide from (Z)-oct-4-ene. Each epoxide is chiral and exists as a pair of enantiomers. On a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column, enantiomers co-elute because they have identical interactions with the stationary phase, while diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated. Therefore, the two diastereomeric epoxides will appear as two distinct peaks on the achiral HPLC column, with each peak representing a pair of enantiomers. This results in a total of 2 peaks on the achiral HPLC column. On a chiral HPLC column, enantiomers can be resolved, resulting in four separate peaks. Each enantiomer from the (E)-derived epoxide and each enantiomer from the (Z)-derived epoxide will be resolved, resulting in four peaks. This reasoning is consistent with the behavior of enantiomers and diastereomers on achiral and chiral HPLC columns. Therefore, the correct answer is that there will be 2 peaks in the standard HPLC and 4 peaks in the chiral HPLC.

proposed answer: The problem involves the epoxidation of (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene using mCPBA, which is a stereospecific reagent. This means that the stereochemistry of the starting alkene is preserved in the epoxide product. (E)-oct-4-ene will form a trans-epoxide, while (Z)-oct-4-ene will form a cis-epoxide. Each of these epoxides can exist as a pair of enantiomers because the epoxide carbon centers are stereogenic. Therefore, we have four stereoisomers in total: two pairs of enantiomers. On a standard (achiral) HPLC column, enantiomers co-elute because they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. However, diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated. This means that the trans-epoxide (from (E)-oct-4-ene) will appear as one peak, representing both enantiomers, and the cis-epoxide (from (Z)-oct-4-ene) will appear as another peak, representing both enantiomers. Thus, we will observe two peaks on the standard HPLC column, corresponding to the two diastereomeric epoxides. On a chiral HPLC column, which can separate both enantiomers and diastereomers, all four stereoisomers will be resolved into separate peaks due to the high theoretical resolution assumed. Each enantiomeric pair will be resolved into two distinct peaks, resulting in a total of four peaks on the chiral column. Therefore, the most consistent analysis is that there will be 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC.
