proposed answer: In the reactions involving (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid, we analyze the products formed. The (E)-isomer will yield a trans-epoxide, while the (Z)-isomer will yield a cis-epoxide due to the stereochemistry of the double bond. Upon treatment with aqueous acid, the epoxide ring opens to form diols. Each isomer produces a different type of diol, leading to two distinct diastereomers from (E)-oct-4-ene and two distinct diastereomers from (Z)-oct-4-ene. Thus, when combining the products from both reactions, we will have a total of four distinct products: 2 diastereomers from (E)-oct-4-ene and 2 diastereomers from (Z)-oct-4-ene. In a standard (achiral) HPLC, diastereomers can co-elute and thus will appear as 2 peaks, as the achiral column cannot differentiate based on chirality. However, in a chiral HPLC, the distinct stereochemical nature of the diastereomers allows for their separation, resulting in 4 peaks. Therefore, the chemist will observe 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC. This leads us to the conclusion that the correct answer is choice B.

proposed answer: In the reactions involving (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene, both undergo epoxidation with mCPBA followed by acid-catalyzed ring opening. The (E)-oct-4-ene forms a trans-epoxide, which upon ring opening yields two diastereomeric products due to the anti addition of the acid. Similarly, the (Z)-oct-4-ene forms a cis-epoxide, which also opens to yield two different diastereomeric products. Therefore, we have a total of four distinct products: two from (E)-oct-4-ene and two from (Z)-oct-4-ene. These products are diastereomers of each other, and all are chiral. In a standard (achiral) HPLC column, which separates based on physical properties like polarity but cannot distinguish between enantiomers, we will observe 4 peaks due to the presence of 4 distinct compounds. In the chiral HPLC column, which can separate chiral compounds, we will also observe 4 peaks for the same reason. Thus, the chemist will observe 4 peaks in both the standard and chiral HPLC chromatograms. The conclusion is that both chromatograms will show 4 distinct peaks, confirming the presence of 4 different stereoisomers. Hence, the correct answer is A.
