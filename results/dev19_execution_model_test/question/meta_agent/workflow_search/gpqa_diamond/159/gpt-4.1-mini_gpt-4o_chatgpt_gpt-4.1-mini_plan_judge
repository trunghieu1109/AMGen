proposed answer: The problem involves the diffraction of light through an aperture that becomes a circle as the number of sides N approaches infinity. For a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern is characterized by the Bessel function of the first kind, J1. The first minimum in the diffraction pattern occurs at an angle where J1 first goes to zero, which is at 1.22 λ/a. The question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima. The first minimum is at 1.22 λ/a, and the second minimum is at approximately 2.23 λ/a. The angular distance between the first two minima is the difference between these two angles, which is (2.23 λ/a) - (1.22 λ/a) = 1.01 λ/a. The correct answer should reflect this angular distance. However, none of the given choices match 1.01 λ/a. The closest choice is A) 1.220 λ/a, but this is not the correct angular distance between the first two minima. Therefore, the correct answer is not among the given choices.

proposed answer: The problem involves determining the angular distance between the first two minima in the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture, which is the limit of an N-sided polygon as N approaches infinity. For a circular aperture, the positions of the minima are given by the zeros of the Bessel function J_1. The first zero is approximately 3.832, and the second zero is approximately 7.016. Using the small-angle approximation, the angular positions are given by theta_n = j_n * lambda / (2 * pi * a). The angular distance between the first two minima is then (7.016 - 3.832) * lambda / (2 * pi * a) = 3.184 * lambda / (2 * pi * a), which simplifies to approximately 0.506 * lambda / a. This matches choice D) exactly. The calculation is consistent with the known results for circular aperture diffraction, and the approximation used is valid for small angles. Therefore, the derived angular distance matches option D) precisely.
