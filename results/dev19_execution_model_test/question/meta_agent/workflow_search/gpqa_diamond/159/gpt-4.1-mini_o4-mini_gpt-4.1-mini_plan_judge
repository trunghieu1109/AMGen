Question: Example(question='Consider an aperture, which shapes like a N-sided polygon. All the apothems are of the same length a. When a monochromatic light (of wavelength \\lambda), travelling along z-axis, falls vertically on this aperture, it creates a series of intensity maxima and minima in the far field region. What is the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large ? Assume that the related angles are small so that tan theta = theta approximation can be taken.', choice1='1.220 \\lambda /a ', choice2='0.610 \\lambda / a', choice3='0.500 \\lambda / a', choice4='0.506 \\lambda / a', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: 1. As N→∞, the regular N‐sided polygon with apothem a becomes a circular aperture of radius a.
2. In Fraunhofer diffraction, the far‐field amplitude for a circular aperture is A(θ)∝2J₁(u)/u, where u=(2πa/λ) sinθ and J₁ is the first‐order Bessel function.
3. Intensity minima occur at the zeros of J₁(u). The first two positive zeros are u₁≈3.8317 and u₂≈7.0156.
4. For small angles θ, sinθ≈θ, so u≈(2πa/λ)θ. Setting u=uₙ yields θₙ=uₙλ/(2πa).
   • θ₁=u₁λ/(2πa)=3.8317λ/(2πa)≈0.610λ/a
   • θ₂=u₂λ/(2πa)=7.0156λ/(2πa)≈1.116λ/a
5. The angular separation between the first two minima is Δθ=θ₂−θ₁=(u₂−u₁)λ/(2πa)=(7.0156−3.8317)λ/(2πa)≈3.1839λ/(2πa)≈0.506λ/a.
6. Comparing Δθ≈0.506λ/a with the provided options, it corresponds to choice D).
