For small θ, sinθ≈θ, so the zeros satisfy k\u2009a\u2009θₙ=xₙ ⇒θₙ=xₙ\u2009λ/(2π\u2009a). Thus: θ₁=3.8317\u2009λ/(2π\u2009a)≈0.610\u2009λ/a and θ₂=7.0156\u2009λ/(2π\u2009a)≈1.116\u2009λ/a. The angular separation between the first two minima is Δθ=θ₂−θ₁=(x₂−x₁)λ/(2π\u2009a)=(7.0156−3.8317)λ/(2π\u2009a)≈0.506\u2009λ/a.
