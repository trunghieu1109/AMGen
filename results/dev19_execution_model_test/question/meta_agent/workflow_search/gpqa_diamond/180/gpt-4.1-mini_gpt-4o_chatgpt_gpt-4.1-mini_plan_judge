proposed answer: The pp-III branch of the solar fusion reactions is known for producing high-energy neutrinos, particularly from the decay of 8B, which significantly contribute to the 800-900 keV energy band (band 2). The 700-800 keV energy band (band 1) is primarily influenced by neutrinos from the pp-I and pp-II branches, which produce lower energy neutrinos. If the pp-III branch suddenly stops, the flux in band 2 would decrease significantly due to the loss of pp-III neutrinos, while the flux in band 1 would remain relatively unchanged as it is less dependent on the pp-III branch. This would result in an increase in the ratio of flux (band 1) / flux (band 2), as the denominator (flux in band 2) decreases more than the numerator (flux in band 1). The 8.5-minute delay corresponds to the time it takes for neutrinos to travel from the Sun's core to Earth, meaning the observed flux change would be noticed on Earth 8.5 minutes after the stoppage. The unchanged other branches continue to contribute to band 1, increasing the ratio to above 1. Therefore, the ratio becomes significantly larger, suggesting choice B) 10.

proposed answer: The problem involves determining the impact of stopping the pp-III branch on the neutrino fluxes in two specific energy bands: 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV. The pp-III branch primarily produces high-energy neutrinos from the decay of 8B, which are mostly above 1 MeV. Therefore, the pp-III branch does not significantly contribute to the 700-900 keV range. The 700-800 keV band (band 1) would have contributions from the low-energy tails of other reactions, while the 800-900 keV band (band 2) is dominated by neutrinos from the pp-II branch, specifically the 862 keV line from 7Be electron capture. Since the pp-III branch does not contribute significantly to either band, stopping the pp-III branch would not cause a significant change in the fluxes of these bands. The flux ratio (band 1 / band 2) would remain approximately the same, as the 800-900 keV band would still have more neutrinos due to the 862 keV line. Therefore, the pp-III branch contributes negligibly to these bands, and stopping it causes minimal flux change. The correct answer is A) 0.1 (10^-1).
