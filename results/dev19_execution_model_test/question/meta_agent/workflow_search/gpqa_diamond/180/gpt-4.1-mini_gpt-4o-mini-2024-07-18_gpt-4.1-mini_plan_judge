proposed answer: To determine the ratio of the flux of neutrinos in the energy bands of 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2) after the cessation of the pp-III branch, we analyze the contributions of the different branches of the proton-proton chain. The pp-III branch produces neutrinos primarily in the energy range that overlaps with both bands, but it is expected to contribute more significantly to the lower energy band (700-800 keV) than to the higher energy band (800-900 keV). When the pp-III branch stops, the flux in band 1 will decrease more than in band 2 because the other branches (pp-I and pp-II) continue to produce neutrinos, contributing less to the 700-800 keV band compared to the 800-900 keV band. Therefore, the ratio of Flux(band 1) to Flux(band 2) is expected to be significantly less than 1, leading to the conclusion that the ratio is likely around 0.1 (10^-1). This conclusion is based on the understanding that the pp-III branch's contribution to band 1 is more substantial than its contribution to band 2, and with its cessation, band 1's flux will drop more significantly. Thus, the answer is A).

proposed answer: When the pp-III branch of solar fusion reactions stops, it primarily affects the production of higher energy neutrinos, particularly those in the 800-900 keV band, since the pp-III branch produces 8B neutrinos which are significant contributors to this energy range. The 700-800 keV band, however, still receives contributions from the pp-I and pp-II branches, particularly the pp-II branch which produces 7Be neutrinos. Therefore, the flux in the 800-900 keV band will decrease more significantly than that in the 700-800 keV band. As a result, the ratio of the fluxes between these two bands, Flux(band 1) / Flux(band 2), will decrease. Given that the contribution from the pp-III branch is more pronounced in the higher energy band, we expect that the ratio will approximate to 0.1 (10^-1), indicating that the flux of neutrinos in the 700-800 keV band is about one-tenth of that in the 800-900 keV band after the pp-III branch has stopped. This reasoning leads to the conclusion that the expected ratio of fluxes is indeed approximately 0.1 (10^-1).
