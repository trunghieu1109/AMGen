proposed answer: To rank the substrates by increasing weight fraction of the para-bromo isomer, we consider for each substituent: (1) its electronic effect (activating vs. deactivating), (2) its directing influence (ortho/para vs. meta), and (3) steric hindrance at ortho positions (which shifts product distribution toward para).

1) Nitrobenzene (4): Very strong –I and –R effects, strongly deactivating and a meta director. Electrophilic attack gives almost exclusively the meta isomer, so the para fraction is essentially zero. This is the lowest.

2) Ethyl benzoate (2): Moderate –I and –R deactivation, meta director. Both ortho and para positions are disfavored, but para is slightly less hindered than ortho. The para fraction is small, but greater than that for nitro.

3) Benzoic acid (6): Also a –I/–R deactivator and meta director. Compared to the ester, the –COOH group’s stronger –I effect and hydrogen-bonding disfavor ortho substitution more, giving a marginally higher para fraction than the ester.

4) Chlorobenzene (3): Deactivating by –I but ortho/para directing by +R resonance. Although overall reactivity is lower, resonance donation makes ortho and para positions relatively richer, and steric crowding at ortho directs more substitution to para. The para fraction is moderate.

5) Toluene (1): Weakly activating (+I and hyperconjugation), ortho/para director. Both ortho and para are favored, but the small methyl group offers little steric bias, so ortho competes substantially. The para fraction is high but not the highest.

6) Ethylbenzene (5): Similar electronic activation to methyl, but the larger ethyl group creates greater ortho steric hindrance. This shifts substitution predominantly to the para position, yielding the highest para fraction.

Putting these in order of increasing para-isomer weight fraction:
4 (NO2) < 2 (COOEt) < 6 (COOH) < 3 (Cl) < 1 (CH3) < 5 (C2H5)

This sequence corresponds to choice B).
