proposed answer: To determine the order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield from the electrophilic substitution reactions of the given substances, we analyze the electronic effects of each substituent on the benzene ring. Electron-donating groups (EDGs) such as -CH3 (from toluene) and -C2H5 (from ethylbenzene) activate the ring and favor para substitution due to their ability to stabilize the positive charge developed during the electrophilic attack. Conversely, electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) like -NO2 (from nitrobenzene) and -COOH (from benzoic acid) deactivate the ring and direct substitution primarily to the meta position, leading to lower yields of the para-isomer. Chlorine (from chlorobenzene) is a weak EWG but has resonance donating ability, which allows for moderate para yields. Based on these considerations, the substances can be ranked as follows: 4 (NO2) and 6 (COOH) yield the least para-isomer due to strong deactivation and meta directing effects, followed by 2 (COOC2H5) which is also an EWG but less strong. Next is 3 (Cl) which has moderate para yield, followed by 1 (CH3) and 5 (C2H5) which are EDGs and yield the most para-isomers. Thus, the final order from lowest to highest para-isomer yield is 4 < 6 < 2 < 3 < 1 < 5, which corresponds to choice 4 in the provided options.
