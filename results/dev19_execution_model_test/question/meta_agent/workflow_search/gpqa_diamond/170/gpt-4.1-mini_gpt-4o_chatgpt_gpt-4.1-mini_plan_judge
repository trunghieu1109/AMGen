proposed answer: To determine the correct order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield, we need to consider the electronic and steric effects of each substituent on the benzene ring. The para-isomer yield is influenced by whether the substituent is electron-donating or electron-withdrawing, and whether it directs substitution to the ortho/para or meta positions. Additionally, steric hindrance can affect the preference for para substitution over ortho. 

1) C6H5-CH3 (toluene): The methyl group is an electron-donating group that activates the ring and directs substitution to the ortho and para positions. The para position is favored due to less steric hindrance compared to the ortho position.

2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (ethyl benzoate): The ester group is electron-withdrawing and typically directs substitution to the meta position. The para-isomer yield is expected to be low due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the group.

3) C6H5-Cl (chlorobenzene): Chlorine is an electron-withdrawing group but directs substitution to the ortho and para positions due to resonance effects. The para position is favored over ortho due to steric hindrance.

4) C6H5-NO2 (nitrobenzene): The nitro group is a strong electron-withdrawing group that deactivates the ring and directs substitution to the meta position. The para-isomer yield is expected to be very low.

5) C6H5-C2H5 (ethylbenzene): Similar to the methyl group, the ethyl group is electron-donating and directs substitution to the ortho and para positions. The para position is favored due to reduced steric hindrance.

6) C6H5-COOH (benzoic acid): The carboxylic acid group is electron-withdrawing and directs substitution to the meta position. The para-isomer yield is expected to be low.

Considering these effects, the order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer should be based on the directing effects and steric considerations. The para-isomer yield is lowest for nitrobenzene and benzoic acid due to strong meta-directing effects, while chlorobenzene and ethylbenzene have higher para-isomer yields due to ortho/para directing effects with less steric hindrance at the para position. Thus, the order is: 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3.

This matches choice D) 4<6<2<1<5<3.
