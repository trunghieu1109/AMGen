Question: Example(question='Astronomers are studying two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2. Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.', choice1='~ 0.4', choice2='~ 0.7', choice3='~ 0.6\n', choice4='~ 1.2', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: To determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we need to apply Kepler's third law correctly. According to Kepler's law, the square of the orbital period (T) is inversely proportional to the total mass (M) of the system. This means that if we have two systems with periods T1 and T2, the relationship can be expressed as M1/M2 = (T2^2)/(T1^2). For system_1, T1 = 2 years, and for system_2, T2 = 1 year. Plugging in these values gives us M1/M2 = (1^2)/(2^2) = 1/4. This indicates that system_1 is 1/4 the mass of system_2, or equivalently, system_2 is 4 times more massive than system_1. Therefore, when asked by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2, we find that it is not more massive at all; it is less massive. The question is misleading in its phrasing. The closest approximate answer choice that reflects the relationship is ~0.4, which indicates that system_1 is approximately 0.4 times the mass of system_2. Thus, the answer is A, as it is the only choice that aligns with the calculated mass ratio.
