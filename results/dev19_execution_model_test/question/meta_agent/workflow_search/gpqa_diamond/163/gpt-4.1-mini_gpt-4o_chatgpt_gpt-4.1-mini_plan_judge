proposed answer: To determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we use Kepler's third law and the radial velocity (RV) relations. Kepler's third law states that the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a) divided by the total mass (M) of the system: P^2 ∝ a^3/M. For circular orbits, the RV amplitude (K) is related to the semi-major axis and the mass of the companion star. The RV amplitude of a star in a binary system is given by K = (2πa sin i) / (P sqrt(1 - e^2)) * (M_other / (M1 + M2)), where M_other is the mass of the other star. Assuming circular orbits (e = 0) and edge-on view (sin i = 1), the RV amplitude ratios give us the mass ratios M2/M1. For system_1, with K1 = 10 km/s and K2 = 5 km/s, M2/M1 = 2. For system_2, with K1 = 15 km/s and K2 = 10 km/s, M2/M1 = 1.5. The orbital periods are 2 years for system_1 and 1 year for system_2. Using Kepler's law, the total mass M1 + M2 is proportional to T^(2/3). Therefore, the total mass of system_1 is proportional to (2 years)^(2/3) and for system_2 to (1 year)^(2/3). Since (2)^(2/3) is greater than (1)^(2/3), system_1 is more massive. The factor can be calculated by comparing these values, leading to a factor of approximately 1.2, which corresponds to choice D.

proposed answer: To determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we need to apply Kepler's third law, which relates the orbital period to the total mass of the system. The formula is M_total = (4π^2 / G) * (a^3 / P^2), where M_total is the total mass, a is the semi-major axis, P is the orbital period, and G is the gravitational constant. Given the periods of 2 years for system_1 and 1 year for system_2, the total mass is inversely proportional to the square of the orbital period, assuming the semi-major axis remains constant. The radial velocity amplitudes provide insights into the mass ratios of the stars in each system but do not directly affect the total mass calculation. Since system_1 has a longer period, it is expected to have a lower total mass compared to system_2. The calculations show that system_1 is approximately 0.4 times the mass of system_2. This result is consistent with the interpretation of the radial velocity amplitudes and Kepler's third law. Therefore, the best approximate answer for the ratio of the total mass of system_1 to system_2 is 0.4.
