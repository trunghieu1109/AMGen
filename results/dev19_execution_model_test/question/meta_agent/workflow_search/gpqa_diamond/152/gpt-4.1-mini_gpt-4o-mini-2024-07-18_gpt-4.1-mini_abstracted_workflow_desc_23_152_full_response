For reaction (A), dimethyl malonate reacts with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate under basic conditions provided by NaOEt and EtOH. The malonate is deprotonated to form an enolate, which then attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate, resulting in the formation of a resonance-stabilized intermediate that leads to the final product, which is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. This product is consistent with the expected outcome of a Michael addition reaction where the nucleophile (enolate) attacks the β-position of the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound. \n\nFor reaction (B), the nucleophile is 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine, which attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile under acidic conditions (MeOH, H3O+). The product formed here is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, which aligns with the expected outcome as the cyclohexyl group is retained and the nitrile functionality is preserved. \n\nIn reaction (C), compound C reacts with but-3-en-2-one in the presence of KOH and H2O. The reaction is likely to lead to a product that includes a hydroxy group, resulting in 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione.
