Question: Example(question='α-β unsaturated carbonyls have a much more electrophilic carbon double bond. These double bonds act as a good Lewis acid and react with nucleophiles to produce enolate ions. In this case, when a nucleophile attacks the β position, it produces a resonance-stabilized intermediate. When a nucleophile attacking the β-carbon is enolate, such reaction is known as the Michael reaction.\nWhat are the reactants and major final products of the following Michael addition reactions?\ndimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) -->(A)\n1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H3O+) --> (B)\nC + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H2O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice1='A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice2='A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice3='A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice4='A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: To determine the correct choice for the products A, B, and C from the Michael addition reactions, we need to analyze each choice in relation to the structural features of the reactants and expected products. For reaction (A), dimethyl malonate reacts with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The product must be a tricarboxylate indicating that the nucleophile (dimethyl malonate) has added to the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate. The correct product should therefore be a trimethyl derivative with the p-tolyl group correctly positioned. Choices 1 and 4 both propose trimethyl derivatives, but only choice 1 specifies a 1,1,3-tricarboxylate, which matches the expected structure. For reaction (B), the nucleophile is 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine, which attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile. The expected product should reflect the addition of the cyclohexene moiety, yielding a butanenitrile with a ketone functionality. Choice 2 proposes a hydroxy derivative which does not match the expected outcome, while choice 3 correctly identifies a product with the cyclohexyl structure. For reaction (C), compound C must lead to a diketone with a hydroxyl group, which is consistent with the expected outcome of the reaction with but-3-en-2-one. Choice 1 and choice 3 both propose hydroxy and diketone functionalities, but choice 3 aligns with the expected structural features of the product. By evaluating each choice against the reactions and expected products, choice 3 is the only one that accurately describes the products A, B, and C derived from the reactions described. Thus, the correct answer is C.

proposed answer: In analyzing the Michael addition reactions provided, we need to carefully consider the reactants, conditions, and expected products. For reaction (A), dimethyl malonate reacts with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt and EtOH. This suggests that dimethyl malonate will form an enolate that attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate, leading to a resonance-stabilized product. The expected product is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, which aligns with choices 1 and 4. For reaction (B), 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine reacts with (E)-but-2-enenitrile under acidic conditions (MeOH, H3O+). The nucleophile here is the piperidine, and the product is expected to be 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, matching choices 1 and 4. In reaction (C), compound C, which is not explicitly defined but likely a derivative of cyclohexane-1,3-dione, reacts with but-3-en-2-one in a basic medium (KOH, H2O) to yield a substituted cyclohexane-1,3-dione. The product is likely to be 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione, aligning with choice 1 and choice 3. After evaluating all options, choice 1 is the most consistent with the expected products based on the reaction mechanisms and conditions described. Therefore, the correct answer is choice A, as it accurately reflects the expected products for all three reactions.
