This enolate attacks the β-carbon of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, resulting in a Michael addition product. The product, trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, is a triester. Under the reaction conditions, the enolate form is favored initially, but the final product is a stable triester, which is less likely to undergo keto-enol tautomerism due to the ester groups.\n\nFor reaction (B), 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine can form an enamine or enolate, which attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile. The product, 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, contains a ketone group adjacent to a nitrile. In MeOH and H3O+, the ketone can undergo keto-enol tautomerism, but the nitrile is not prone to such tautomerism. The enol form is less stable and less likely to be present in significant amounts due to the acidic conditions favoring the keto form.\n\nFor reaction (C), cyclohexane-1,3-dione (compound C) forms an enolate under basic conditions (KOH, H2O) and attacks the β-carbon of but-3-en-2-one. The product, 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione, has two ketone groups. Both can undergo keto-enol tautomerism, especially in the presence of base, but the diketone form is more stable under the given conditions. The enol forms are likely transient intermediates during the reaction.\n\nIn summary, keto-enol tautomerism is possible for the ketone-containing products, but the keto forms are generally more stable under the reaction conditions.

Under basic conditions, the enolate form is favored, but the final product is likely to be the keto form due to the stability of the ester groups and the lack of acidic protons to promote enolization.\n\nFor reaction (B), 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine can form an enamine or enolate, which attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile. The reaction conditions (MeOH, H3O+) are acidic, which favors the keto form of the product. The product is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile. The presence of the oxo group suggests that the keto form is predominant, as the acidic conditions would favor protonation of any enol forms.\n\nFor reaction (C), cyclohexane-1,3-dione forms an enolate under basic conditions (KOH, H2O). This enolate attacks the β-carbon of but-3-en-2-one, forming 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

The resulting Michael adduct is a triester, specifically trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. In this product, the enol form is less favored due to the stability of the ester groups, so the keto form predominates. \n\nFor reaction (B), 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine can form an enamine or enolate, which attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile.

This enolate attacks the β-carbon of but-3-en-2-one, resulting in 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.
