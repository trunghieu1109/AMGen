Question: Example(question='You are studying a nuclear decay which converts two heavy nucleons of flavor A to another flavor B, while simultaneously emitting two much lighter particles E and V. In short, 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V. It is known that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous, with some endpoint value Q.\n\nA variant of this decay emits one exotic, massless particle M instead of the 2V. In this case, how does the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles compare to that of the original decay?', choice1='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint increases.', choice2='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases.', choice3='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.', choice4='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint decreases.', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: In the original decay process 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V, the energy spectrum of the E particles is continuous because the energy is shared among the E and V particles. The endpoint Q is determined by the total energy available minus the energy carried by the V particles. In the variant decay 2A -> 2B + 2E + M, the two V particles are replaced by a single massless M particle. This change reduces the number of particles sharing the energy and alters the kinematics. Since M is massless, it can carry away energy in the form of momentum without a rest mass contribution, potentially allowing more energy to be available to the E particles. The spectrum remains continuous because energy is still shared between E and M, and the conservation laws still apply. The endpoint of the energy spectrum for the E particles could increase because the energy that would have been shared with two V particles is now shared with one massless M particle. Therefore, the spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases due to the reduced number of particles sharing the energy and the massless nature of M.
