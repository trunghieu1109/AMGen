Question: Example(question='You are studying a nuclear decay which converts two heavy nucleons of flavor A to another flavor B, while simultaneously emitting two much lighter particles E and V. In short, 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V. It is known that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous, with some endpoint value Q.\n\nA variant of this decay emits one exotic, massless particle M instead of the 2V. In this case, how does the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles compare to that of the original decay?', choice1='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint increases.', choice2='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases.', choice3='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.', choice4='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint decreases.', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: 1. The nature of the energy spectrum for a subset of final‐state particles in a decay is governed by the available phase‐space: whenever there is at least one other particle sharing energy and momentum, the subset’s spectrum is continuous rather than discrete.
2. Original decay 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V is a four‐body final state. The two E’s share energy with the two V’s, giving a continuous distribution for the total E energy from its minimum up to a kinematic endpoint Q (when the V’s carry off only their rest‐mass energy).
3. Variant decay 2A → 2B + 2E + M is a three‐body final state (two E’s and one massless M). Three‐body kinematics still allow a continuous partition of energy between the E pair and M, so the total E energy remains a continuous variable.
4. The kinematic endpoint is set by the configuration in which the non‐E particle(s) carry minimal energy. In the original decay the two V’s have nonzero rest mass and thus consume 2m_V of the available Q. In the variant the single M is massless, so its minimum energy can be zero, leaving strictly more energy for the two E’s than in the original case.
5. Therefore, replacing 2V by a single massless M preserves the continuity of the E spectrum (three‐body decay) and raises the maximum possible total E energy above the original endpoint Q.
