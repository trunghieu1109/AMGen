Question: Example(question='Which of the following issues are the most common sources of difficult-to-spot erroneous results generated in genomics data analysis:\n\n- Mutually incompatible data formats\n- The "chr" / "no chr" confusion\n- Reference assembly mismatch\n- Incorrect ID conversion', choice1='3 and 4', choice2='2 and 3', choice3='All of the above', choice4='2, 3 and 4', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_5_167
proposed answer: Step 1: Assess each error source’s prevalence and stealth risk:
 1) Mutually incompatible data formats (e.g., VCF vs BED vs GTF): extremely common when merging outputs from different tools, and silent field drops or reordering often go unnoticed.
 2) “chr”/“no chr” confusion: ubiquitous naming mismatch (“chr1” vs “1”) across references and tools, causing whole chromosome records to be skipped without errors.
 3) Reference assembly mismatch (GRCh37 vs GRCh38): very common as older datasets persist, and coordinate shifts silently misplace or drop variants.
 4) Incorrect ID conversion (Ensembl↔HGNC↔rsIDs): routine mapping between gene/variant identifiers can misannotate without warnings.

Step 2: Examine how these combine:
  - Any single issue yields plausible yet flawed results.
  - Pairwise/triple combinations compound hidden failures across formatting, naming, coordinate, and semantic domains.
  - All four together produce end-to-end data corruption that appears valid at every stage.

Step 3: Compare to answer choices:
  A) 3 and 4 omits the two most pervasive silent-failure sources (formats, chr naming).
  B) 2 and 3 omits formats and ID conversion errors.
  D) 2, 3 and 4 still omits incompatible formats, arguably the top stealth culprit.
  C) All of the above includes every issue known to be both widespread and hard to detect.

Step 4: Conclusion:
  Omitting any of these four categories understates the landscape of common, difficult-to-spot errors in genomics pipelines. Only choice C captures the full set of stealthiest, most frequent pitfalls.
