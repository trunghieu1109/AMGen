proposed answer: 1. Identify the specific cat state: for φ=−π/4 and α=0.5, cosφ=1/√2, sinφ=−1/√2, so |ψ⟩∝(|α⟩−|−α⟩) and N²=1−e^{−2α²}, i.e. the odd Schrödinger‐cat state.  
2. Since ρ=|ψ⟩⟨ψ| is pure, Tr[ρ ln ρ]=0.  
3. The reference Gaussian τ is taken as the thermal state with the same mean photon number n̄=⟨ψ|a†a|ψ⟩.  
4. Compute n̄ for the odd cat: using known result  ⟨a†a⟩=α²(1+e^{−2α²})/(1−e^{−2α²}), substitute α=0.5 and e^{−2·0.25}=e^{−0.5}≈0.6065 → n̄≈0.25·1.6065/0.3935≈1.0215.  
5. The von Neumann entropy of a thermal state is S(τ)=(n̄+1) ln(n̄+1)−n̄ ln n̄.  With n̄≈1.0215:  n̄+1≈2.0215, ln2.0215≈0.7039 → (2.0215)(0.7039)≈1.423; ln1.0215≈0.0213 → (1.0215)(0.0213)≈0.0217; S(τ)≈1.423−0.0217≈1.401.  
6. Therefore δ_b=Tr[ρ ln ρ]−Tr[τ ln τ]=0−(−S(τ))=S(τ)≈1.40, matching choice C) 1.38.
