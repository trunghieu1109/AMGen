proposed answer: To synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene, we need to carefully consider the order of reactions based on the electronic and steric effects of the substituents. The first step is Friedel-Crafts alkylation using tert-butyl chloride and AlCl3, which introduces the bulky tert-butyl group at the ortho or para position on the benzene ring. Given that we want the tert-butyl group at position 2, this step is crucial. Next, we perform nitration using HNO3/H2SO4, which will introduce a nitro group at the meta position relative to the tert-butyl group, placing it at position 3 as desired. After that, we need to introduce the ethoxy group. This can be done through nucleophilic substitution using NaOH and ethyl bromide (EtBr), which will occur at the position ortho to the tert-butyl group, placing the ethoxy group at position 1. The sequence must respect the directing effects of the substituents: the tert-butyl group is an ortho/para director, while the nitro group is a meta director. Thus, the order of operations is critical to achieving the target molecule without unwanted side products. The other steps provided in the choices, such as reduction and diazotization, are not necessary for the synthesis of the target compound and could introduce complications. Therefore, the most consistent and straightforward choice that aligns with this analysis is A.

proposed answer: To synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene, we need to carefully analyze the proposed reaction sequences. The target molecule has specific substituents at defined positions on the benzene ring: the tert-butyl group at position 2, the ethoxy group at position 1, and the nitro group at position 3. The synthesis must start with a Friedel-Crafts alkylation using tert-butyl chloride and AlCl3 to introduce the tert-butyl group. This step is crucial as it influences the regioselectivity of subsequent reactions. The next step is nitration using HNO3/H2SO4, which will place the nitro group at position 3, owing to the ortho/para directing effects of the tert-butyl group. After the introduction of the nitro group, we need to introduce the ethoxy group. The ethoxy group can be introduced directly through a Williamson ether synthesis using NaOH and ethyl bromide (EtBr). The order of these steps is critical to ensure that the desired substitution pattern is achieved without unwanted side reactions. Each step is necessary: the Friedel-Crafts alkylation sets the stage for the nitration, and the Williamson ether synthesis introduces the ethoxy group at the correct position. The reduction of the nitro group to an amine is not necessary for the synthesis of the target compound, as the nitro group can remain intact. Therefore, the proposed sequence must be adjusted to reflect this understanding. After analyzing all sequences, it is clear that choice A provides the necessary steps in the correct order, while the other choices either misplace steps or include unnecessary reactions, leading to less efficient pathways.
