proposed answer: To synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene, we must consider the directing effects of substituents and the order of reactions. The tert-butyl group is an ortho/para director, so it should be introduced first using Friedel-Crafts alkylation (tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3). This directs further substitutions to the ortho and para positions. Next, we introduce the nitro group using HNO3/H2SO4, which is a meta director. However, due to steric hindrance, the nitro group will likely go to the para position relative to the tert-butyl group. After nitration, the nitro group is reduced to an amine using Fe/HCl. The amine is then diazotized with NaNO2/HCl to form a diazonium salt. This diazonium salt can undergo nucleophilic substitution with NaOH/EtBr to introduce the ethoxy group. This sequence ensures high yield and correct positioning of substituents, considering the directing effects and steric factors. Comparing this strategy with the provided choices, choice 1 aligns best. It starts with Friedel-Crafts alkylation to introduce the tert-butyl group, followed by nitration to add the nitro group. Then, it reduces the nitro group to an amine, diazotizes it, and finally substitutes with ethoxy using NaOH/EtBr. This sequence matches the logical synthetic strategy and yields the target molecule efficiently. All agents agree on this sequence, confirming its validity.

proposed answer: To synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene, the reaction sequence must be carefully planned to introduce each substituent in the correct order and position, considering the directing effects and compatibility of reactions. The target compound has a tert-butyl group at position 2, an ethoxy group at position 1, and a nitro group at position 3. The optimal sequence involves: 1) Friedel-Crafts alkylation to introduce the tert-butyl group at position 2, as alkyl groups are ortho/para-directing and activating. 2) Nitration to introduce the nitro group at position 3, which is meta to the tert-butyl group. 3) Reduction of the nitro group to an amine using Fe/HCl, as amines can be further transformed. 4) Diazotization of the amine to form a diazonium salt using NaNO2/HCl, which is a precursor for nucleophilic substitution. 5) Nucleophilic substitution with NaOH/EtBr to introduce the ethoxy group at position 1. Choice 1 aligns with this logical sequence, despite containing an unnecessary second nitration step. This choice avoids the errors of incorrect substitution patterns and unnecessary sulfonation seen in other choices. It maintains the correct order of reactions and functional group transformations, leading to the desired substitution pattern. Key insights for synthetic planning include understanding the directing effects of substituents and the stability of intermediates. The sequence should prioritize the introduction of activating groups before deactivating ones and consider the compatibility of reactions to avoid side reactions. The choice of reagents and conditions should aim for high yield and selectivity. Therefore, the optimal choice is A).
