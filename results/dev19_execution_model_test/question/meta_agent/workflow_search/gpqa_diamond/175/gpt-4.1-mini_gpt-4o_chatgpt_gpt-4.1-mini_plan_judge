Question: Example(question='The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1), and the operators of two observables P and Q of the system are represented by two square matrices. The matrix corresponding to operator P has the elements in first row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0), elements in the second row as (1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}) and that in third row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0). The matrix operator for Q is represented by the square matrix having elements in the first row as (1, 0, 0), second row as (0, 0, 0) and third row as (0, 0, -1). Now, if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P, what is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements?', choice1='1/2', choice2='1/6', choice3='1/3', choice4='2/3', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: To compute the overall probability of sequentially measuring 0 for P and then -1 for Q, we need to consider the results from the sub-tasks. In Sub-task 1, we calculated the probability of measuring eigenvalue 0 for P from the initial state as 2/3. In Sub-task 2, we found that the probability of measuring eigenvalue -1 for Q from the post-measurement state (after measuring 0 for P) is 0. The overall probability of these sequential measurements is the product of these two probabilities: (2/3) * 0 = 0. This result makes sense because after measuring 0 for P, the state collapses to a vector that has no component in the eigenspace of Q corresponding to eigenvalue -1, making the probability of measuring -1 for Q zero. Therefore, the overall probability of measuring 0 for P and then -1 for Q is 0.
