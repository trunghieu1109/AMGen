proposed answer: To determine the correct partition function Z for the system of three spins, we analyze the energy levels based on the configurations of the spins. Each spin can take values of +1 or -1, leading to a total of 8 configurations. The energy of the system is expressed as E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Evaluating the energy for each configuration, we find three distinct energy levels: -3J (for all spins aligned), -J (for one spin opposite to the others), and +J (for two spins aligned and one opposite). The degeneracies for these energy levels are 2 for -3J, 4 for -J, and 2 for +J. The contributions to the partition function Z can be calculated using the Boltzmann factor exp(-βE). Therefore, the total partition function Z can be expressed as Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 4e^(-Jβ) + 2e^(Jβ). However, upon reviewing the choices provided, none of them match this derived expression directly. The closest match, based on the contributions from degenerate states and their energy levels, appears to be choice A: Z = 2 e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ), which includes a similar structure but with a different coefficient for the middle energy level. This leads me to conclude that choice A is the best fit given the structure of the partition function derived, despite the discrepancy in coefficients. Thus, I select choice A as the answer.
