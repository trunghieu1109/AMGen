Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Final Decision Agent sFje', content='To determine the correct partition function Z, we need to evaluate the energy for all possible configurations of the three spins S1, S2, and S3, each of which can be +1 or -1. This results in 2^3 = 8 possible configurations. The energy of the system is given by E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Evaluating this expression for each configuration, we find two distinct energy levels: -3J and J. Specifically, the configurations (+1, +1, +1) and (-1, -1, -1) yield an energy of -3J, resulting in a degeneracy of 2 for this energy level. The remaining six configurations yield an energy of J, resulting in a degeneracy of 6 for this energy level. The partition function Z is calculated by summing over all configurations of e^{-βE}, where E is the energy of each configuration. Thus, Z = 2 * e^{3Jβ} + 6 * e^{-Jβ}. This matches choice A) in the original question, which is Z = 2 e^(3Jβ) + 6 e^(-Jβ).
