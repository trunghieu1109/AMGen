Question: Example(question='You identified a new quorum-sensing peptide in the bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus. You are highly interested if its role in intercellular communication is conserved among the eukaryotes. You treat yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with the peptide and interestingly observe the formation of the shmoo. You want to learn about the proteome of the active chromatin in the shmoo and recover it by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. The least of proteins from which complex below will you observe in your assay?', choice1='pre-initiation complex', choice2='pre-replication complex', choice3='enhancer protein complex', choice4='nucleosome histone complex', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: Step 1: Define the assay and target. Chromatin immunoprecipitation targeting active chromatin (e.g., RNAP II, H3K4me3) will enrich proteins directly bound to or associated with transcriptionally active regions in shmoo cells.

Step 2: Evaluate each complex’s association with active chromatin in shmoo cells.
A) Pre-initiation complex (PIC): Assembles at promoters of actively transcribed genes (mating genes induced in the shmoo). Contains TBP, TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF, TFIIH, RNAP II. Strongly enriched in ChIP–MS of active chromatin.

B) Pre-replication complex (pre-RC): Comprises ORC, Cdc6, Cdt1, MCM2–7. Loads at origins in late M/early G1 to license DNA replication. Shmoo cells are pheromone-arrested in G1 and not entering S phase; origins are not licensed, and pre-RC components are not bound at active transcription sites. Thus, they are absent or at extremely low levels in active chromatin ChIP.

C) Enhancer protein complex: Includes transcription factors, Mediator, chromatin remodelers recruited to enhancers of mating genes. Actively engaged in regulating transcription in shmoo; enriched in active chromatin ChIP.

D) Nucleosome histone complex: Histone octamers underlie all chromatin, including active regions. Even in open chromatin, histones (with active PTMs) remain tightly associated, so histones are robustly recovered.

Step 3: Compare expected recovery: PIC, enhancer complexes, and histones will all be readily detected. Pre-RC components neither bind active promoters/enhancers nor are loaded under pheromone-induced G1 arrest.

Conclusion: The pre-replication complex will be the least observed in the ChIP–MS assay of active chromatin in shmoo cells.
