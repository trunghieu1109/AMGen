Question: Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). Then \(OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\).
Iteration: abstract_workflow_5_18
proposed answer: We computed OC^2 = 7/16, so p = 7 and q = 16. Therefore, p + q = 7 + 16 = 23.

Iteration: abstract_workflow_2_18
proposed answer: From the provided result, the coordinates of C are (1/8, 3√3/8) so that OC² = 7/16, which expressed in relatively prime terms gives p = 7 and q = 16, leading to p + q = 23. However, the original question requested a detailed breakdown of the parameter restrictions (t ∈ [0, 1]) and analysis of the boundary cases (as θ → 0 and θ → π/2) to rigorously justify the uniqueness of point C. Since these details are not fully provided, additional explanation and decomposition of these cases would be necessary to fully address the problem's demands.

Answer:23
[TOO_HARD] Could you please provide further details on the parameter restrictions (t ∈ [0,1]) and the analysis of the boundary cases (as θ → 0 and θ → π/2) to justify the uniqueness of point C?
