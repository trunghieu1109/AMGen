    <pre>Related original question:

Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac12,0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac\sqrt32\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcalF\) be the family of segments \(\overlinePQ\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overlineAB\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcalF\) other than \(\overlineAB\). Then \(OC^2=\tfracpq\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\)..

### Sub-task 5: Make final decision on C coordinates and square distance. 

 ### thinking by Final Decision Agent xoXM:
After analyzing the given discussion and partial derivations, the coordinates of point C on segment AB are determined to be (1/8, 3√3/8) with OC² = 7/16. However, a completely rigorous derivation would involve further decomposition of the parameter constraints, particularly assuring that t ∈ [0, 1] and carefully handling the boundary cases. This decomposition is necessary to fully justify that C is unique in its non-membership in other segments of the family F.

### answer by Final Decision Agent xoXM:
Coordinates of C are (1/8, 3√3/8) and OC² = 7/16.
[TOO_HARD] Please provide a detailed breakdown of the parameter restrictions (t ∈ [0, 1]) and the analysis of boundary cases (as θ → 0 and θ → π/2) to fully justify the uniqueness of point C.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Represent OC^2 as a fraction in terms of relatively prime integers and compute p + q.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>From the provided result, the coordinates of C are (1/8, 3√3/8) so that OC² = 7/16, which expressed in relatively prime terms gives p = 7 and q = 16, leading to p + q = 23. However, the original question requested a detailed breakdown of the parameter restrictions (t ∈ [0, 1]) and analysis of the boundary cases (as θ → 0 and θ → π/2) to rigorously justify the uniqueness of point C. Since these details are not fully provided, additional explanation and decomposition of these cases would be necessary to fully address the problem&#39;s demands.

[TOO_HARD] Could you please provide further details on the parameter restrictions (t ∈ [0,1]) and the analysis of the boundary cases (as θ → 0 and θ → π/2) to justify the uniqueness of point C?</pre>
