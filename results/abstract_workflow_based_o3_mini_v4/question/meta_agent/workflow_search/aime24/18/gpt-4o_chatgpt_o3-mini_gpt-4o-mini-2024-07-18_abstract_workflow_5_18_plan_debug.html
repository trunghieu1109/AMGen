    <pre>Related original question:

Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac12,0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac\sqrt32\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcalF\) be the family of segments \(\overlinePQ\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overlineAB\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcalF\) other than \(\overlineAB\). Then \(OC^2=\tfracpq\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\).. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 6: Convert calculated OC^2 into the form p/q where p, q are coprime, and compute p+q. 

 ### thinking by Debate Agent He3s:
We computed OC^2 = (1/8)^2 + ((3√3)/8)^2 = 1/64 + 27/64 = 28/64, which simplifies to 7/16. Since p = 7 and q = 16 are coprime, p+q = 7+16 = 23.

### thinking by Debate Agent uxjN:
We are given that C has coordinates (1/8, (3√3)/8). Calculating OC^2, we have (1/8)^2 + ((3√3)/8)^2 = 1/64 + 27/64 = 28/64, which simplifies to 7/16. Since 7 and 16 are relatively prime, p = 7 and q = 16, giving p + q = 23.

### answer by Debate Agent He3s:
23

### answer by Debate Agent uxjN:
23

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Make final decision on p+q.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
