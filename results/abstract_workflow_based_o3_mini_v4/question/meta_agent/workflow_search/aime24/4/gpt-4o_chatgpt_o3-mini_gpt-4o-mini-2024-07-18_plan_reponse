Thus, based on the detailed modular arithmetic computations, the final decision is that the verification is correct.\n\nAnswer:Final verification confirmed: m = 110 is the least positive integer such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 289.",

        "response": "Using Hensel's lemma, we start with the solution m\u2080 = 8 to the congruence m\u2074 \u2261 -1 (mod 17) and set m = 8 + 17k. Expanding and applying the linear approximation leads to the congruence 3 + 8k \u2261 0 (mod 17). The modular inverse of 8 modulo 17 is 15, so k is determined from 8k \u2261 -3 (or equivalently 8k \u2261 14 mod 17) as k \u2261 14 \u00d7 15 \u2261 210 \u2261 6 (mod 17). This yields m = 8 + 17\u00d76 = 110. The process confirms that 110 is indeed the least positive integer m such that m\u2074 + 1 is divisible by 289 (which is 17\u00b2).\n\nAnswer:110",
