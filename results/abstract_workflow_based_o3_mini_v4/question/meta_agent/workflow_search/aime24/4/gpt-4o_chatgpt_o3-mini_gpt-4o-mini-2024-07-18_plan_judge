proposed answer: Both debate agents provide consistent verification by showing that when m=110 is substituted into the expression, the arithmetic modulo 289 yields that 110^4 + 1 is divisible by 289 (17^2), confirming the correctness of the solution. Thus, based on the detailed modular arithmetic computations, the final decision is that the verification is correct.

Answer:Final verification confirmed: m = 110 is the least positive integer such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 289.
Extracted answer: Final verification confirmed: m = 110 is the least positive integer such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 289.
Correct answer: 110

proposed answer: Using Hensel's lemma, we start with the solution m₀ = 8 to the congruence m⁴ ≡ -1 (mod 17) and set m = 8 + 17k. Expanding and applying the linear approximation leads to the congruence 3 + 8k ≡ 0 (mod 17). The modular inverse of 8 modulo 17 is 15, so k is determined from 8k ≡ -3 (or equivalently 8k ≡ 14 mod 17) as k ≡ 14 × 15 ≡ 210 ≡ 6 (mod 17). This yields m = 8 + 17×6 = 110. The process confirms that 110 is indeed the least positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by 289 (which is 17²).
