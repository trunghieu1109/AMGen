First, note that 110^2 = 12100 and when reduced modulo 289 (since 289 = 17^2) we get 12100 - 11849 = 251, so 110^2 ≡ 251 (mod 289). Squaring this result, (110^2)^2 = 251^2 = 63001, and because 289 × 218 = 63002, we have 63001 ≡ -1 (mod 289). Therefore, 110^4 ≡ -1 (mod 289) so that 110^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 289). This confirms that m^4 + 1, for m = 110, is divisible by 289.\n\n### thinking #3 by Debate Agent dUTI:\nWe confirm the solution by noting that when m = 110, we have 110^2 = 12100. Since 289 * 41 = 11849, then 12100 - 11849 = 251, which means 110^2 ≡ 251 (mod 289). Squaring this result, (110^2)^2 = 110^4, so 251^2 = 63001. Since 289 * 218 = 63002, we find that 63001 ≡ -1 (mod 289). Therefore, 110^4 + 1 ≡ (-1) + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 289).

That is, we must have n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p). Since the multiplicative group modulo an odd prime p is cyclic of order p - 1, any number is a kth power modulo p if and only if it lies in the subgroup of k-th powers. In particular, -1 must be a fourth power modulo p. A necessary and sufficient condition for an element a to be a fourth power modulo p is that a^((p-1)/4) ≡ 1 (mod p). Setting a = -1, we require (-1)^((p-1)/4) ≡ 1 (mod p). This congruence holds if and only if (p - 1)/4 is even, i.e. p - 1 is divisible by 8. Therefore, p must be congruent to 1 modulo 8. Once a solution is obtained modulo p (with n not divisible by p to avoid vanishing derivative issues), Hensel's lemma can often be applied to lift it to a solution modulo p^2. Thus the necessary condition is that p satisfies p ≡ 1 (mod 8).; answer: p must be an odd prime with p ≡ 1 (mod 8)\nCoT-SC agent lnmm, checking small primes, thinking: We first note that the necessary condition is that p must be an odd prime with p ≡ 1 (mod 8). Among the candidates given: 2, 3, and 5, none satisfy this condition. Specifically, p=2 is even and although for odd n we have n^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 2), one must check divisibility by 2^2 = 4. For n=1, 1^4 + 1 = 2 which is not divisible by 4, and similar tests for higher odd n yield the same result. For p=3, since 3 ≡ 3 (mod 8), the necessary condition fails and indeed, testing small values of n modulo 9 does not produce any n such that n^4 + 1 is divisible by 9. Similarly, for p=5 (with 5 ≡ 5 (mod 8)), the condition fails and tests for divisibility by 25 confirm that there is no positive integer n with n^4 + 1 divisible by 25. Thus, basic small primes 2, 3, and 5 do not satisfy the condition for having some n with n^4 + 1 divisible by p^2.; answer: None of these primes (2, 3, 5) yields a valid n such that n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2.\nCoT-SC agent HiV6, checking small primes, thinking: We begin by noting that our necessary condition for an odd prime p to have a solution of n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p) is that p ≡ 1 (mod 8). Checking the small primes: For p = 2 the condition does not apply in the same way (and one can verify by testing that no n makes n^4+1 divisible by 4). For p = 3 and p = 5, neither is congruent to 1 mod 8. In fact, modulo 3 any n^4 is either 0 (if 3 divides n) or 1 since 2^4 = 16 ≡ 1 (mod 3), so there is no n for which n^4 ≡ -1 (mod 3). Similarly, by Fermat’s little theorem, for any n not divisible by 5 we have n^4 ≡ 1 (mod 5), and when n is divisible by 5, n^4+1 ≡ 1 (mod 5), so there is no solution. Thus, none of the basic primes 2, 3, or 5 satisfy the required condition for n^4+1 to be divisible by p^2.; answer: None of the primes 2, 3, or 5 satisfy the condition; in particular, 2, 3, and 5 do not yield any positive integer n such that n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2.\nCoT-SC agent XJtp, checking small primes, thinking: We start by noting that for an odd prime p, a necessary condition for the existence of a solution to n^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod p^2) is that there is a solution modulo p, which requires n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p). Since the multiplicative group modulo p is cyclic of order p - 1, the element -1 can only be a fourth power if (-1)^((p-1)/4) ≡ 1 (mod p), which forces (p - 1)/4 to be even. In other words, for an odd prime p we must have p ≡ 1 mod 8. Checking the small primes given: p = 2 is even and so does not fall within the condition considered (and indeed no n gives n^4 + 1 divisible by 4); p = 3 and p = 5 are odd but 3 ≡ 3 (mod 8) and 5 ≡ 5 (mod 8) so neither satisfies the necessary condition. Direct verification by checking small n values for p = 3 (with modulus 9) and p = 5 (with modulus 25) confirms that no n exists such that n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2 for these primes.; answer: None of the primes 2, 3, or 5 satisfy the condition. For p = 2, although 1^4 + 1 is divisible by 2 (mod2) this does not lift to divisibility by 4. For p = 3 and p = 5, the necessary condition p ≡ 1 (mod 8) is not met, and testing confirms no value of n makes n^4 + 1 divisible by 9 or 25 respectively.\nReflexion CoT agent MSO0, finding least prime p, thinking: We require a prime p for which there exists an integer n such that n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2. A necessary condition is that n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p), and since the multiplicative group modulo an odd prime is cyclic, this forces -1 to be a fourth power, which is equivalent to having p ≡ 1 (mod 8). The smallest odd prime that satisfies p ≡ 1 (mod 8) is 17. With a solution modulo 17, Hensel's lemma can be used to lift it to modulo 17^2. Therefore, the least prime p is 17.; answer: 17\nCritic agent 0YyO, providing feedback, thinking: The identification of prime p = 17 is well reasoned. The explanation correctly observes that n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p) implies that -1 must be expressible as a fourth power mod p, which, for a cyclic group modulo an odd prime, forces p ≡ 1 (mod 8). Since 17 is the smallest prime with this property, and Hensel's lemma justifies lifting the solution from modulo 17 to modulo 17^2, the reasoning and conclusion are sound.; answer: 17\nReflexion CoT agent MSO0, refining least prime p, thinking: We note that for n^4 + 1 to be divisible by p^2, it is necessary that n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p), implying that -1 is a fourth power modulo p. In a cyclic group modulo an odd prime, this forces p to be congruent to 1 modulo 8. The smallest such prime is 17, and Hensel’s lemma ensures that a solution modulo 17 can be lifted to a solution modulo 17^2.; answer: 17\nCritic agent 0YyO, providing feedback, thinking: The identification of p = 17 is sound. The reasoning correctly notes that for n^4 + 1 to be divisible by p^2, one must have n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p), implying that -1 is a quartic residue modulo p. This forces the prime to be congruent to 1 modulo 8 (for odd primes). Since 17 is the smallest prime with 17 ≡ 1 (mod 8) and Hensel’s lemma guarantees that a solution modulo 17 can be lifted to a solution modulo 17^2, the answer appears to be correctly identified. It is also important to double-check that no smaller prime (such as 2) meets the criteria, which in this case it does not due to divisibility conditions by p^2.; answer: 17\nReflexion CoT agent MSO0, refining least prime p, thinking: Using the necessary condition n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p), it follows that -1 must be a fourth power modulo p. In a cyclic group modulo an odd prime, this requires that p ≡ 1 (mod 8). The smallest such prime is 17, and by Hensel's lemma a solution modulo 17 lifts to modulo 17^2. Therefore, the least prime p is 17.; answer: 17\nCritic agent 0YyO, providing feedback, thinking: The reasoning is well-structured. The chain-of-thought correctly notes that for n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p) to have a solution, there must exist an element of order 8 in the multiplicative group modulo p, which implies that 8 divides p - 1 (i.e., p ≡ 1 (mod 8)). Given that 17 is the smallest prime satisfying this condition and that Hensel's lemma allows a solution modulo p to be lifted to p^2, the conclusion that p = 17 is sound.; answer: 17\nReflexion CoT agent MSO0, refining least prime p, thinking: We require that there exists an integer n such that n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2. For a solution even modulo p, we must have n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p), which implies that -1 must be a fourth power modulo p. In a cyclic group modulo an odd prime, this constraints p so that p ≡ 1 (mod 8). The smallest prime satisfying that is 17, and using Hensel's lemma a solution modulo 17 can be lifted to modulo 17^2. Therefore, the least prime is 17.; answer: 17\nDebate agent FNAG, round 0, calculating least integer m, thinking: We first note that p = 17 is the least prime for which there exists a positive integer n with n⁴ ≡ -1 (mod 17). Working modulo 17, one of the solutions is n ≡ 2 (mod 17) (since 2⁴ = 16 ≡ -1 mod 17) and the other is n ≡ -2 ≡ 15 (mod 17). To lift a solution modulo 17 to one modulo 17² = 289 using Hensel’s lemma, consider the branch starting with n₀ = 2. Writing m = 2 + 17t, a first-order expansion gives (2 + 17t)⁴ ≡ 16 + 4·8·17t (mod 289) so that m⁴ + 1 ≡ 17 + 17(32t) = 17(1 + 32t) (mod 289). For m⁴ + 1 to be divisible by 289 we require 1 + 32t ≡ 0 (mod 17). Since 32 ≡ 15 (mod 17) this becomes 1 + 15t ≡ 0 (mod 17), yielding t ≡ 9 (mod 17) with the least positive choice t = 9 and m = 2 + 17·9 = 155. However note that if m is a solution then so is 289 – m (because raising to the fourth power eliminates the sign), so from m = 155 we get 289 – 155 = 134 as another solution. Considering the other initial branch n₀ = 15, a similar computation shows that its lift gives m = 15 + 17·8 = 151 (with the symmetric solution 289 – 151 = 138). Among these four solutions {134, 138, 151, 155} the least positive integer is 134. A quick check confirms that 134⁴ + 1 is divisible by 289. Therefore, the least positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by 17² is 134.; answer: 134\nDebate agent 3Lfq, round 0, calculating least integer m, thinking: We already have p = 17 so that p^2 = 289. We need the smallest positive m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 289, that is, m^4 ≡ -1 (mod 289). First, note that a necessary condition is that m^4 ≡ -1 (mod 17), i.e. m^4 ≡ 16 (mod 17). Working modulo 17 one finds four solutions; for example, m ≡ 2, 15, 8, or 9 (mod 17) work since 2^4 = 16, 15^4 = (−2)^4 = 16, and indeed one may verify that 8^4 ≡ (8^2)^2, with 8^2 = 64 ≡ 13 mod 17 so that 13^2 = 169 ≡ 16 mod 17, and similarly for 9). \n\nWe now lift one of these solutions to a solution modulo 289 using Hensel’s lemma. Take m ≡ 8 (mod 17) as an example. Write m = 8 + 17k for some integer k. Define f(m) = m^4 + 1. We have f(8) = 8^4 + 1 = 4096 + 1 = 4097, and since 4097 ≡ 0 (mod 17) (indeed, 17 × 241 = 4097), we can write f(8) = 17 × 241. \n\nTo lift the solution, note that modulo 289 (where 289 = 17^2) the higher order terms in the binomial expansion (involving (17k)^2 or higher) vanish. Thus, modulo 289 we have:\n\u2003\u2003f(8 + 17k) ≡ f(8) + f'(8)·(17k)\nwith f'(m) = 4m^3. Compute f'(8) = 4·512 = 2048. Hence,\n\u2003\u2003f(8 + 17k) ≡ 17 × 241 + 17 × 2048 · k  = 17 (241 + 2048 k) (mod 289).\n\nFor f(8 + 17k) to vanish modulo 289, we need:\n\u2003\u2003241 + 2048 k ≡ 0 (mod 17).\nSince 2048 mod 17 is computed by noting that 17 × 120 = 2040, so 2048 ≡ 8 (mod 17), and 241 mod 17 is 241 − 17×14 = 241 − 238 = 3, the congruence simplifies to:\n\u2003\u20033 + 8k ≡ 0 (mod 17)\u2003\u2003⇒\u2003\u20038k ≡ −3 (mod 17).\nSince −3 ≡ 14 (mod 17) and the inverse of 8 modulo 17 is 15 (because 8 × 15 = 120 ≡ 1 mod 17), we have:\n\u2003\u2003k ≡ 14 × 15 = 210 ≡ 210 − 17×12 = 210 − 204 = 6 (mod 17).\nTaking k = 6 gives m = 8 + 17 × 6 = 8 + 102 = 110.\n\nA check shows that 110^4 + 1 is indeed divisible by 289. Considering the four possible base solutions modulo 17, one finds that the lift starting from m ≡ 8 leads to the smallest positive lifted solution m = 110. Therefore, the least positive integer m satisfying m^4 + 1 divisible by 289 is 110.; answer: 110\nDebate agent FNAG, round 1, calculating least integer m, thinking: After analyzing the possible solutions modulo 17 and then lifting them to modulo 289 using Hensel’s lemma, we find that although one branch (starting with m ≡ 2 mod 17) gives solutions 155 and its symmetric 134, another branch (starting with m ≡ 8 mod 17) leads to a smaller solution. In this branch we set m = 8 + 17t and determine t by solving 3 + 8t ≡ 0 (mod 17), which gives t ≡ 6 (mod 17) and thus m = 8 + 17·6 = 110. A check confirms that 110⁴ + 1 is divisible by 289, thereby making m = 110 the least positive integer for which m⁴ + 1 is divisible by 17².; answer: 110\nDebate agent 3Lfq, round 1, calculating least integer m, thinking: After examining the problem through different solution branches, we note that the congruence m^4 ≡ -1 (mod 289) has four lifted solutions from the base solutions modulo 17. In particular, the branch starting with m ≡ 8 (mod 17) gives m = 8 + 17*6 = 110, with its symmetric partner being 289 - 110 = 179. The other branches yield solutions 134, 138, and 151. Since 110 is the smallest positive integer among these and a check confirms that 110^4 + 1 is divisible by 289, the least positive integer m is 110.; answer: 110\nDebate agent FNAG, round 2, calculating least integer m, thinking: We first confirm that p = 17 is the least prime for which a solution exists to n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p). Then, by lifting a solution modulo 17 to modulo 289 (17^2) using Hensel's lemma, it is seen that the choice m ≡ 8 (mod 17) leads to the solution m = 8 + 17*6 = 110. This m value is the smallest positive integer such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 289.; answer: 110\nDebate agent 3Lfq, round 2, calculating least integer m, thinking: The analysis shows that the least prime p for which there exists a positive integer n such that n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2 is 17 (since the condition n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p) implies p ≡ 1 (mod 8)). After lifting solutions to modulo 289 = 17^2 using Hensel's lemma, one branch yields m ≡ 8 (mod 17) and, upon solving, we find that the least positive integer m that satisfies m^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 289) is 110. This is confirmed by checking that 110^4 + 1 is indeed divisible by 289.; answer: 110\nFinal Decision agent, calculating least integer m, thinking: Both debate agents identified that p = 17 is the least prime that permits a solution for n^4 + 1 being divisible by p^2, and by Hensel's lemma, the smallest positive integer m satisfying m^4 + 1 being divisible by 289 (17^2) is m = 110. The lifting procedure confirmed the branch with m ≡ 8 (mod 17) leads to m = 110, making it the least such integer.; answer: 110\nDebate agent NYb3, round 0, verifying solution, thinking: To confirm the result, we work modulo 289 (which is 17^2). We have m = 110. First, compute 110^2 = 12100. Now, reducing modulo 289: 289 × 41 = 11849, so 12100 − 11849 = 251. This gives 110^2 ≡ 251 (mod 289). Next, compute 110^4 = (110^2)^2 ≡ 251^2 (mod 289). Since 251^2 = 63001 and 289 × 218 = 63002, we have 63001 ≡ -1 (mod 289). Therefore, 110^4 + 1 ≡ (-1) + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 289), confirming that 110^4 + 1 is divisible by 289.; answer: When m = 110, plugging into m^4 + 1, the result is divisible by 289 (which is 17^2), thus confirming the solution.\nDebate agent dUTI, round 0, verifying solution, thinking: We verify the solution by checking that 110^4 + 1 is divisible by 289 (which is 17^2). First, we note that 110^2 modulo 289 is 12100 mod 289. Since 289 * 41 = 11849, we have 12100 - 11849 = 251, so 110^2 ≡ 251 (mod 289). Then, computing (110^2)^2 gives 251^2 = 63001. Observing that 289 * 218 = 63002, we find 63001 ≡ -1 (mod 289). Therefore, 110^4 ≡ -1 (mod 289), and adding 1 gives 0 modulo 289. This proves that 289 divides 110^4 + 1, confirming the solution.; answer: Substituting m = 110 into m^4+1, we get 110^4+1 which is divisible by 289, confirming that m = 110 is indeed the least positive integer with this property.\nDebate agent NYb3, round 1, verifying solution, thinking: We use modular arithmetic to verify that substituting m = 110 into m^4 + 1 produces a multiple of p^2 (i.e., 289). First, we calculate 110^2 modulo 289: 110^2 = 12100, and 12100 - 11849 = 251 since 289 * 41 = 11849, so 110^2 ≡ 251 (mod 289). Next, square 251 to find 110^4 modulo 289: 251^2 = 63001, and since 289 * 218 = 63002, we have 63001 ≡ -1 (mod 289). Therefore, 110^4 ≡ -1 (mod 289), and adding 1 gives 110^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 289). This confirms that 289 divides 110^4 + 1.; answer: When m = 110, by computing the values modulo 289 we find that 110^2 ≡ 251 and 110^4 ≡ -1, so 110^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 289), which confirms the solution.\nDebate agent dUTI, round 1, verifying solution, thinking: We verify that substituting m = 110 into m^4 + 1 results in a number divisible by 289 (which is 17^2). First, compute 110^2 = 12100, and note that 12100 mod 289 equals 251 because 289 × 41 = 11849 and 12100 - 11849 = 251. Then, 110^4 is (110^2)^2, so we have 251^2 = 63001. Since 63001 is 1 less than 289 × 218 (which is 63002), it follows that 63001 ≡ -1 (mod 289). Thus, 110^4 + 1 ≡ (-1) + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 289), confirming that m = 110 is the least positive integer with the property.; answer: Substituting m = 110 into m^4 + 1 yields a result divisible by 289, as demonstrated by the modular computations (110^2 ≡ 251 mod 289 and 251^2 ≡ -1 mod 289, hence 110^4 + 1 ≡ 0 mod 289).\nDebate agent NYb3, round 2, verifying solution, thinking: We verify that m = 110 is correct. First, note that 110^2 = 12100 and when reduced modulo 289 (since 289 = 17^2) we get 12100 - 11849 = 251, so 110^2 ≡ 251 (mod 289). Squaring this result, (110^2)^2 = 251^2 = 63001, and because 289 × 218 = 63002, we have 63001 ≡ -1 (mod 289). Therefore, 110^4 ≡ -1 (mod 289) so that 110^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 289). This confirms that m^4 + 1, for m = 110, is divisible by 289.; answer: Substituting m = 110 back into m^4 + 1 yields 110^4 + 1 which is divisible by 289, confirming the solution.\nDebate agent dUTI, round 2, verifying solution, thinking: We confirm the solution by noting that when m = 110, we have 110^2 = 12100. Since 289 * 41 = 11849, then 12100 - 11849 = 251, which means 110^2 ≡ 251 (mod 289). Squaring this result, (110^2)^2 = 110^4, so 251^2 = 63001. Since 289 * 218 = 63002, we find that 63001 ≡ -1 (mod 289). Therefore, 110^4 + 1 ≡ (-1) + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 289).
