In the case where p is odd and n is not divisible by p, this implies that the multiplicative order of n modulo p is 8, since squaring gives n^8 ≡ 1 (mod p) and n^4 ≠ 1. Hence, an element of order 8 exists in the multiplicative group modulo p, which forces 8 to divide p − 1 (i.e. p ≡ 1 (mod 8)). In the special case p = 2, the derivative of n^4 + 1 becomes 0, so n^4 + 1 may have repeated roots modulo 2 leading to different lifting properties. Therefore, the necessary condition for an odd prime p is that the congruence n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p) is solvable, which in turn forces p ≡ 1 (mod 8).\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent xiOq:\nA necessary condition is that p = 2 or, if p is odd, then there exists an integer n with n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p), which forces 8 to divide p − 1 (i.e. p ≡ 1 (mod 8)).\n\n### Sub-task 2: Calculate the least prime number p that satisfies the conditions using n^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod p^2). \n\n ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent iEQ3:\nWe note that for an odd prime p to divide n^4+1 (with higher divisibility, i.e. p^2 dividing n^4+1 via Hensel lifting), a necessary condition is that there exists an n with n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p). This requires that the multiplicative order of n modulo p is 8, forcing 8 to divide p-1, i.e. p ≡ 1 (mod 8). The smallest odd prime satisfying p ≡ 1 (mod 8) is 17. Checking mod 17, we see that 2^4 = 16 ≡ -1 (mod 17) so that 2^4+1 is divisible by 17, and by Hensel’s lemma (since the derivative 4*2^3=32 ≢ 0 mod 17), this solution lifts uniquely to a solution modulo 17^2. Hence, 17 is indeed the least prime p for which there exists a positive integer n with n^4+1 divisible by p^2.\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent iEQ3:\n17\n\n### Sub-task 3: Determine the least positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by the squared value of the previously found prime number. \n\n ### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent aZA9 (yourself):\nWe already determined that the least prime p with p^2 dividing n^4+1 is 17. To find the minimal m with m^4+1 divisible by 17^2 = 289, we first note that the congruence m^4 ≡ -1 (mod 17) has four solutions mod 17, which (using a generator method) can be found to be 2, 9, 8, and 15. Hensel’s lemma guarantees a unique lift modulo 289 for each such solution provided the derivative f′(m) = 4m^3 is nonzero modulo 17. For each solution m0, we write m = m0+17k and use the approximation f(m) ≡ f(m0)+17k f′(m0) (mod289). For example, taking m0 = 8, we have f(8) = 8^4+1. Since 8^4 mod17 is 16 (because 8^2 ≡ 13 mod17 and 13^2 = 169 ≡ 16 mod17) we get f(8) ≡ 16+1 = 17, so f(8)=17. Also, f′(8)=4×8^3. Noting that 8^3 mod17 is 2 (since 8^3=512 and 512-17×30=512-510=2), we get f′(8)=8 mod17, whose inverse modulo 17 is 15 (because 8×15=120≡1 mod17). Then using Hensel’s lemma we set k ≡ - (f(8)/17)* (inverse of f′(8)) ≡ -1×15 ≡ 2 (mod17). Thus, the unique lift corresponding to m0=8 is m = 8+17×2 = 42. Checking the remaining lifts shows that 42 is the smallest positive integer among those lifted. Hence, the least positive integer m such that m^4+1 is divisible by 289 is 42.\n\n### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent aZA9 (yourself):\n42\n\n### please review the m determination and provide feedback. \n\n ### feedback #1 by Critic Agent s6Nj:\nThe solution correctly applies Hensel’s lemma by first identifying a solution modulo 17 (m₀ = 8) and verifying that the derivative f\'(8) = 4×8³ is nonzero modulo 17.

The chain-of-thought correctly identifies that m0 = 8 is a solution modulo 17, but the lifting via Hensel’s Lemma was misapplied. When setting m = 8 + 17k and expanding m^4 + 1, one obtains the condition 241 + 8k ≡ 0 (mod 17), which simplifies to 3 + 8k ≡ 0 (mod 17). Solving 8k ≡ -3 (or 8k ≡ 14) modulo 17 yields k ≡ 6 (since the inverse of 8 modulo 17 is 15). This gives m = 8 + 17*6 = 110.

The computation of the inverse of 8 modulo 17 as 15 and the subsequent solution k ≡ 6 (mod 17) culminating in m = 110 is accurate.

In this case, for any integer n, n^4 modulo 4 is either 0 (if n is even) or 1 (if n is odd), so n^4 + 1 is either 1 or 2 modulo 4; hence, no integer n gives n^4 + 1 divisible by 4.
