    <pre>Related original question:

Let $\mathcalB$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcalB$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\fracpq$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Subtask 5: Express the computed radius squared, r^2, as a fraction in its simplest form. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent IYQq:
The computed radius is (sqrt(657))/8, so r^2 is (sqrt(657)/8)^2 = 657/64. Since 657 factors as 3^2 * 73 and 64 is 2^6, they have no common factors, and thus the fraction 657/64 is already in simplest form.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent IYQq:
657/64

Given the above, answer the following question: Subtask 6: Determine and return the sum of the numerator and denominator of r^2 in simplest form.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>Using the result from Subtask 5, we have r^2 = 657/64 in simplest form. Adding the numerator and denominator, 657 + 64, gives 721.
