    <pre>Related original question:

Let $\mathcalB$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcalB$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\fracpq$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 1: Identify the geometric and algebraic conditions for rectangular boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent WmI4:
A rectangular box with dimensions x, y, and z has the volume xyz and the surface area 2(xy + xz + yz). In this problem, the volume is given as 23, so xyz = 23, and the surface area is 54, which implies 2(xy + xz + yz) = 54. Dividing the surface area equation by 2 gives xy + xz + yz = 27. Additionally, since the box must have positive dimensions, we require x, y, z &gt; 0.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent WmI4:
The geometric and algebraic conditions are: x, y, z &gt; 0, xyz = 23, and xy + xz + yz = 27.

### Sub-task 2: Formulate relationships and constraints for dimensions of the rectangular box based on identified conditions. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent BOLJ:
We already identified that for a box with dimensions x, y, z in ℝ^+, the volume and surface area conditions impose two symmetric constraints: xyz = 23 and xy + xz + yz = 27. Beyond these, one can note that by the identity (x+y+z)^2 = x^2+y^2+z^2 + 2(xy+xz+yz), the total squared sum x^2+y^2+z^2 can be expressed in terms of x+y+z and the given sum 27 (since 2×27=54). In addition, x, y, z are the positive roots of the cubic polynomial t^3 – (x+y+z)t^2 + 27t – 23 = 0. These relationships provide additional constraints when considering ordering, feasibility, and potential extrema (like maximizing the diagonal length).

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent BOLJ:
Let x, y, z &gt; 0 be the dimensions of the box. They must satisfy the following relationships and constraints: (1) Volume: xyz = 23; (2) Surface area (half): xy + xz + yz = 27; (3) The dimensions are the positive roots of t^3 – (x+y+z)t^2 + 27t – 23 = 0; and (4) They also satisfy the identity (x+y+z)^2 = x^2+y^2+z^2 + 54, so that any expression involving the box’s diagonal (√(x^2+y^2+z^2)) can be written in terms of x+y+z. These relations fully capture the algebraic and geometric constraints on the dimensions.

### Sub-task 3: Make final decision on sphere diameter. 

 ### thinking by Final Decision Agent XMa8:
The two debate agents both agreed that by taking two equal dimensions (x = y = 2, leading to z = 23/4), the maximum possible space diagonal (which is the sphere&#39;s diameter) is achieved. By computing x+y+z and using the identity (x+y+z)^2 = x^2+y^2+z^2+54, we have x^2+y^2+z^2 = 657/16, so the space diagonal is √(657/16) = (√657)/4. This is the smallest sphere that can circumscribe every rectangular box in the set, making the final decision for the sphere&#39;s diameter (√657)/4.

### answer by Final Decision Agent XMa8:
(√657)/4

### Sub-task 4: Calculate the expression for the squared radius of the circumscribing sphere. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent YdTc:
We know from previous analysis that the maximum space diagonal occurs for x = y = 2 and z = 23/4. For these dimensions, the space diagonal squared is x² + y² + z² = 4 + 4 + (23/4)² = 8 + 529/16 = (128 + 529)/16 = 657/16. The circumscribing sphere must have a diameter equal to this space diagonal. Therefore the radius is half of that, so r² = (space diagonal)²/4 = (657/16)/4 = 657/64.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent YdTc:
657/64

### Sub-task 5: Simplify the squared radius expression to a fraction with coprime numerator and denominator. 

 ### thinking #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent oN9d:
The squared radius expression was calculated as 657/64. Factoring 657 as 3^2 * 73 and observing that 64 is 2^6, there are no common factors between them, so the fraction 657/64 is already in simplest form with a coprime numerator and denominator.

### answer #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent oN9d:
657/64

### Sub-task 6: Determine the sum of the numerator and denominator of the squared radius fraction. 

 ### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent HUT6 (yourself):
The squared radius fraction was determined to be 657/64, which is already in its simplest form. The sum of the numerator and denominator is 657 + 64 = 721.

### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent HUT6 (yourself):
721

### Review final sum calculation. 

 ### feedback #1 by Critic Agent Y1VW:
The final sum calculation is correct. The squared radius given as 657/64 is in simplest form, and the sum of the numerator and denominator, 657 + 64, indeed equals 721.

### Sub-task 6: Determine the sum of the numerator and denominator of the squared radius fraction. 

 ### thinking #2 by Chain-of-Thought Agent HUT6 (yourself):
The chain-of-thought agents determined that the squared radius of the sphere is 657/64. Since this fraction is already simplified (with numerator 657 and denominator 64 being coprime), the required sum of the numerator and denominator is 657 + 64, which equals 721.

### answer #2 by Chain-of-Thought Agent HUT6 (yourself):
721

### Review final sum calculation. 

 ### feedback #2 by Critic Agent Y1VW:
The final sum calculation is correct. The squared radius of the sphere is expressed as 657/64, and since 657 and 64 are relatively prime, their sum is 657 + 64 = 721.

### Sub-task 6: Determine the sum of the numerator and denominator of the squared radius fraction. 

 ### thinking #3 by Chain-of-Thought Agent HUT6 (yourself):
The provided information shows that the squared radius of the circumscribing sphere is 657/64, which is already in its simplest form because 657 (factors as 3^2 * 73) and 64 (2^6) share no common factors. Therefore, the sum of the numerator and denominator is 657 + 64 = 721.

### answer #3 by Chain-of-Thought Agent HUT6 (yourself):
721

### Review final sum calculation. 

 ### feedback #3 by Critic Agent Y1VW:
The calculation is correct. The fraction 657/64 cannot be simplified further because 657 (3^2 * 73) and 64 (2^6) have no common factors, so the sum of the numerator and denominator is indeed 657 + 64 = 721.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Determine the sum of the numerator and denominator of the squared radius fraction.
