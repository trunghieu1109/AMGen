This is the rearranged version in terms of base-2 exponentials.; answer: x/(yz) = 2^(1/2)\nCoT agent kRKs, rearranging equation 2, thinking: To solve the equation log_2(y/(xz)) = 1/3 for an exponential expression, we use the definition of the logarithm: if log_b(a) = c, then a = b^c. Here, a = y/(xz), b = 2, and c = 1/3. Thus, we obtain y/(xz) = 2^(1/3), which can be rearranged to y = 2^(1/3) * xz.; answer: y = 2^(1/3) * xz\nCoT agent lzoU, rearranging equation 3, thinking: We start with the equation log_2(z/(xy)) = 1/4. Converting from logarithmic form to exponential form gives us z/(xy) = 2^(1/4). This expresses the equation in terms of base-2 exponentials.; answer: z/(xy) = 2^(1/4)\nCoT agent UBN5, solving the system of equations, thinking: We are given three equations in exponential form: x/(yz) = 2^(1/2), y/(xz) = 2^(1/3), and z/(xy) = 2^(1/4). Multiplying these equations gives (x/(yz))*(y/(xz))*(z/(xy)) = 1/(xyz) = 2^(1/2+1/3+1/4) = 2^(13/12), so that xyz = 2^(-13/12). Next, substituting back into the first equation, we have x = 2^(1/2)*(yz). But since yz = (xyz)/x = 2^(-13/12)/x, we get x^2 = 2^(1/2)*2^(-13/12) = 2^((6-13)/12) = 2^(-7/12) and so x = 2^(-7/24). Similarly, using the second equation y/(xz) = 2^(1/3) we get y^2 = 2^(1/3)*2^(-13/12) = 2^((4-13)/12) = 2^(-9/12) = 2^(-3/4) and thus y = 2^(-3/8). Lastly, from the third equation z/(xy) = 2^(1/4) we obtain z^2 = 2^(1/4)*2^(-13/12) = 2^((3-13)/12) = 2^(-10/12) = 2^(-5/6) and so z = 2^(-5/12). These are the simultaneous relationships among x, y, and z.; answer: x=2^(-7/24), y=2^(-3/8), z=2^(-5/12)\nCoT-SC agent RBsL, computing x^4y^3z^2, thinking: We use the derived values: x = 2^(-7/24), y = 2^(-3/8), and z = 2^(-5/12). Then x^4 = 2^(4*(-7/24)) = 2^(-7/6), y^3 = 2^(3*(-3/8)) = 2^(-9/8), and z^2 = 2^(2*(-5/12)) = 2^(-5/6). Adding the exponents: -7/6 - 9/8 - 5/6. Converting to a common denominator (24) gives -28/24 - 27/24 - 20/24 = -75/24 = -25/8. Thus, x^4y^3z^2 = 2^(-25/8).; answer: 2^(-25/8)\nCoT-SC agent 0PA6, computing x^4y^3z^2, thinking: Given x = 2^(-7/24), y = 2^(-3/8), and z = 2^(-5/12), we find exponents when raising to the requested powers: x^4 = 2^(4*(-7/24)) = 2^(-7/6), y^3 = 2^(3*(-3/8)) = 2^(-9/8), and z^2 = 2^(2*(-5/12)) = 2^(-5/6). Summing these exponents: -7/6 - 9/8 - 5/6. Finding a common denominator (24) gives: -28/24 - 27/24 - 20/24 = -75/24 = -25/8. Thus, x^4y^3z^2 = 2^(-25/8). This is the computed value using the relationships derived.; answer: 2^(-25/8)\nCoT-SC agent 849a, computing x^4y^3z^2, thinking: Using the relationships from subtask 4, we have x = 2^(-7/24), y = 2^(-3/8), and z = 2^(-5/12). To compute x^4 * y^3 * z^2, we calculate each term: x^4 = 2^(-7/24 * 4) = 2^(-7/6), y^3 = 2^(-3/8 * 3) = 2^(-9/8), and z^2 = 2^(-5/12 * 2) = 2^(-5/6). Multiplying these gives a combined exponent: (-7/6) + (-9/8) + (-5/6). First, combine the fractions with denominator 6: (-7/6) + (-5/6) = -12/6 = -2. Then convert -2 to eighths: -2 = -16/8. Adding with -9/8 gives -16/8 - 9/8 = -25/8. Thus, x^4 * y^3 * z^2 = 2^(-25/8).; answer: 2^(-25/8)\nCoT agent itdW, calculating |log_2(x^4y^3z^2)|, thinking: We have x^4 y^3 z^2 = 2^(-25/8), so log2(x^4y^3z^2) = -25/8.
