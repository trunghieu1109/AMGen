Rewriting this in exponential form gives x/(yz) = 2^(1/2), or equivalently, x/(yz) = √2. Multiplying both sides by yz, we obtain the expression x = √2 · y · z.; answer: x = √2 · y · z\nCoT agent W3FZ, solving equation for x, y, z, thinking: The given equation is log2(y/(xz)) = 1/3. This can be rewritten in exponential form as y/(xz) = 2^(1/3). Multiplying both sides by xz yields y = 2^(1/3) * x * z.; answer: y = 2^(1/3) * xz\nCoT agent gyrD, solving equation for x, y, z, thinking: The given equation is log₂(z/(xy)) = 1/4. Using the definition of the logarithm, this equation is equivalent to z/(xy) = 2^(1/4). Multiplying both sides by xy gives the relation z = 2^(1/4) * x * y, which is the desired expression relating x, y, and z.; answer: z = 2^(1/4)xy\nReflexion CoT agent c4Ki, creating unified condition, thinking: Combining the three given equations x = 2^(1/2)*yz, y = 2^(1/3)*xz, and z = 2^(1/4)*xy can be done by multiplying them. Multiplying the left‐sides gives x*y*z and the right‐sides multiply to 2^(1/2+1/3+1/4)* (xyz)^2. Noting that 1/2+1/3+1/4 = (6+4+3)/12 = 13/12 we get: x*y*z = 2^(13/12)*(x*y*z)^2. Assuming xyz > 0 we may divide by xyz to obtain 1 = 2^(13/12)*(xyz), i.e. xyz = 2^(-13/12). This is the unified condition among the variables. Furthermore, one may substitute this back into each individual equation. For instance, from x = 2^(1/2)*yz, write yz = (xyz)/x = 2^(-13/12)/x. Then x = 2^(1/2)*(2^(-13/12)/x) so that x^2 = 2^(1/2 - 13/12) = 2^(-7/12) and thus x = 2^(-7/24) (choosing the positive square root since x > 0). A similar procedure yields y = 2^(-3/8) = 2^(-9/24) and z = 2^(-5/12) = 2^(-10/24). Therefore the expressions for x, y, and z are given by:\n\n\u2003\u2003x = 2^(–7/24),\u2003 y = 2^(–9/24),\u2003 z = 2^(–10/24)\u2003\u2003with\u2003 x*y*z = 2^(–13/12).\n\nThis is the unified condition combining the three equations.; answer: x = 2^(–7/24), y = 2^(–9/24), z = 2^(–10/24), with the unified condition x*y*z = 2^(–13/12)\nCritic agent yxF1, providing feedback, thinking: The refined unified condition, in its simplest form, is that the product of x, y, and z satisfies x*y*z = 2^(-13/12). This can also be expressed in logarithmic form as log2(x*y*z) = -13/12.; answer: x*y*z = 2^(-13/12)\nReflexion CoT agent c4Ki, refining condition, thinking: We derived x = 2^(1/2)yz, y = 2^(1/3)xz, and z = 2^(1/4)xy from the given logarithmic equations. Multiplying these gives x*y*z = 2^(1/2+1/3+1/4) * (x*y*z)^2, where 1/2+1/3+1/4 = 13/12. This leads to x*y*z = 2^(13/12) * (x*y*z)^2, so dividing both sides by x*y*z (which is nonzero) we find x*y*z = 2^(-13/12). Substituting back into each equation gives x^2 = 2^(1/2 - 13/12) = 2^(-7/12) so x = 2^(-7/24) (choosing the positive root). Similarly, y = 2^(-9/24) and z = 2^(-10/24). Thus, the unified condition is x*y*z = 2^(-13/12), equivalently log2(x*y*z) = -13/12.; answer: x = 2^(-7/24), y = 2^(-9/24), z = 2^(-10/24), with the unified condition: x*y*z = 2^(-13/12) (or log2(x*y*z) = -13/12)\nCritic agent yxF1, providing feedback, thinking: The refined unified condition can be written in either exponential or logarithmic form. Since we derived that x*y*z = 2^(-13/12), the unified condition is refined to x*y*z = 2^(-13/12), which is equivalent to log₂(x*y*z) = -13/12.; answer: x*y*z = 2^(-13/12) or log₂(x*y*z) = -13/12\nReflexion CoT agent c4Ki, refining condition, thinking: We combine the equations: x = 2^(1/2)yz, y = 2^(1/3)xz, and z = 2^(1/4)xy. Multiplying these gives x·y·z = 2^(1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4) (x·y·z)^2. Noting that 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 = 13/12, we have x·y·z = 2^(13/12) (x·y·z)^2. Dividing by x·y·z (which is positive) yields x·y·z = 2^(-13/12). Then substituting back in, for example, x = 2^(1/2)yz and writing yz = (x·y·z)/x gives x = 2^(1/2) (2^(-13/12)/x) so that x^2 = 2^(1/2 - 13/12) = 2^(-7/12), whence x = 2^(-7/24). Similar computations give y = 2^(-9/24) and z = 2^(-10/24). Thus, the unified condition is x·y·z = 2^(-13/12), equivalently log₂(x·y·z) = -13/12.; answer: x = 2^(-7/24), y = 2^(-9/24), z = 2^(-10/24), with the unified condition: x*y*z = 2^(-13/12) (or equivalently, log₂(x*y*z) = -13/12).\nCritic agent yxF1, providing feedback, thinking: The unified condition can be refined to state that the sum of the binary logarithms of x, y, and z is -13/12. Equivalently, we have log₂(xyz) = -13/12, which implies that xyz = 2^(-13/12).; answer: log₂(xyz) = -13/12 or xyz = 2^(-13/12)\nReflexion CoT agent c4Ki, refining condition, thinking: We combine the three equations: x = 2^(1/2)yz, y = 2^(1/3)xz, and z = 2^(1/4)xy. Multiplying them, we obtain x*y*z = 2^(1/2+1/3+1/4)*(x*y*z)^2. Since 1/2+1/3+1/4 = 13/12, we have x*y*z = 2^(13/12)*(x*y*z)^2. Dividing by x*y*z (nonzero as x,y,z > 0) leads to x*y*z = 2^(-13/12), which is our unified condition (or equivalently, log₂(xyz) = -13/12). Substituting back into one of the original equations (e.g., x = 2^(1/2)yz, where yz = (xyz)/x) gives x^2 = 2^(1/2 - 13/12) = 2^(-7/12), so x = 2^(-7/24). Similarly, we obtain y = 2^(-9/24) and z = 2^(-10/24).; answer: x = 2^(-7/24), y = 2^(-9/24), z = 2^(-10/24), with the unified condition x*y*z = 2^(-13/12) (equivalently, log₂(x*y*z) = -13/12)\nCoT agent baqi, computing log2(x^4y^3z^2), thinking: Using the expressions x = 2^(-7/24), y = 2^(-9/24), and z = 2^(-10/24), we compute log₂(x⁴y³z²) = 4 log₂(x) + 3 log₂(y) + 2 log₂(z) = 4(-7/24) + 3(-9/24) + 2(-10/24) = (-28 - 27 - 20)/24 = -75/24 = -25/8.; answer: -25/8\nCoT agent 2nJL, calculating absolute value, thinking: From the given chain-of-thought, we know that x = 2^(-7/24), y = 2^(-9/24), and z = 2^(-10/24).
