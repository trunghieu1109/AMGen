Question: Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations:
\[\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}\]\[\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}\]\[\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}\]
Then the value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.
Iteration: abstract_workflow_2_24
proposed answer: From the given chain-of-thought, we know that x = 2^(-7/24), y = 2^(-9/24), and z = 2^(-10/24). Thus, log₂(x⁴y³z²) = 4 log₂(x) + 3 log₂(y) + 2 log₂(z) = 4(-7/24) + 3(-9/24) + 2(-10/24) = (-28 - 27 - 20)/24 = -75/24 = -25/8. Taking the absolute value yields |log₂(x⁴y³z²)| = 25/8. Since 25 and 8 are relatively prime, the expression in the form m/n is 25/8.
