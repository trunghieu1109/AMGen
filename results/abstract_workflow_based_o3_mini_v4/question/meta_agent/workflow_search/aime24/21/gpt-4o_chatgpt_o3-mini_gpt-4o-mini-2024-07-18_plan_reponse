        "response": "The original reasoning indicates a final count of 15 rectangles, based solely on selecting pairs of opposite vertices (which yields C(6,2)=15). However, since there is ambiguity regarding which additional diagonals (aside from those joining opposite vertices) are allowed for forming rectangle sides, further clarification is needed to confirm whether any other configurations should be considered. Thus, while 15 is our best answer under the current interpretation, the answer is marked [TOO_HARD] to signal that additional detail is required about the permitted diagonals.\n\nAnswer:15\n[TOO_HARD] Please clarify which additional diagonals, beyond those connecting opposite vertices, are allowed for forming the sides of the rectangles.",
