There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\\frac{m \\sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime.

While the derivations are abbreviated and not fully rigorous, the final answer is accepted as 11. However, for complete rigor, a full derivation using vertex coordinates or the Cayley\u2013Menger determinant is needed, and further decomposition or guidance is requested.\n\nAnswer:11\n[TOO_HARD] Please provide a full derivation, including use of vertex coordinates or the Cayley\u2013Menger determinant, to rigorously confirm the tetrahedron's volume and face areas.",

However, fully verifying the expression d = (3V)/(S_A + S_B + S_C + S_D) requires an extensive step-by-step derivation using the Cayley\u2013Menger determinant for the volume and Heron\u2019s formula for the face areas. This detailed breakdown is highly involved, so further decomposition steps would be needed to fully confirm the computation.\n\nAnswer:6\n[TOO_HARD] Please provide a detailed derivation using the Cayley\u2013Menger determinant for the volume and Heron\u2019s formula for the face areas to thoroughly verify the inradius expression, as the full breakdown involves complex algebra.",
