        "response": "The enumeration problem involves an intricate analysis of (r, c) configurations with constraints that force placements and require a bipartite selection process to trim to exactly 25 chips. Without an explicit breakdown for the forced placements in each (r, c) case and details on how to perform the matching, the complete closed-form total cannot be computed. Therefore, the problem as stated is too complex without further decomposition of cases and explicit combinatorial selection details.\n\nAnswer:[TOO_HARD]\nInformation Request: Please provide an explicit breakdown for each (r, c) configuration of white rows and white columns, along with the detailed algorithm (for example, via bipartite matching) used to adjust the forced placements to exactly 25 chips. This decomposition is necessary because the current formulation does not provide sufficient structural constraints to determine a definitive count.",

        "response": "The problem distinguishes two cases. In a maximal arrangement every active row and every active column must have at least one chip. If all rows are assigned the same color (all white or all black), then to be maximal every column must be that same color, giving 2 arrangements. In the mixed case where rows are not all identical, there are 2^5 = 32 color assignments possible for rows, but we have to exclude the 2 uniform color assignments, leaving 30 possibilities for rows. The same argument applies for columns, giving 30 possibilities. Thus, the mixed case contributes 30 * 30 = 900 arrangements. Adding the 2 uniform cases yields a total of 902 arrangements.\n\nAnswer:902",
