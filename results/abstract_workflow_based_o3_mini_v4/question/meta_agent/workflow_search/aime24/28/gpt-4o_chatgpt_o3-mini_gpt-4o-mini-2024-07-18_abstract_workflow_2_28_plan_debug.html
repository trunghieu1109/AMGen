    <pre>Related original question:

Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfracmn$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$..

### Sub-task 5: Make final decision on expressing difference as a fraction. 

 ### thinking by Final Decision Agent M59r:
The calculations and derivations in the related sub-tasks suggest that the difference can be expressed as the fraction 11/7 in simplest form. However, since the complete step-by-step geometric derivation (including tangency conditions and radical simplifications) is not fully detailed, this final answer is marked as [TOO_HARD]. Additional information such as a detailed breakdown of the tangency conditions and related geometric steps is requested to fully justify the result.

### answer by Final Decision Agent M59r:
11/7
[TOO_HARD] Please provide a comprehensive step-by-step derivation including all geometric explanations and radical simplifications to completely justify the tangency conditions.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Calculate the sum of the numerator and denominator of the fraction obtained.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>The fraction was determined to be 11/7, so the sum of the numerator and denominator is 11 + 7, which equals 18. However, as indicated in the related sub-task, the complete geometric derivation, which involves detailed step-by-step analysis of the tangency conditions and radical simplifications, is not fully provided. More information or decomposition on the derivation steps would be beneficial.

Answer:18
[TOO_HARD] Additional step-by-step geometric derivation details of the tangency conditions and radical simplifications are requested to fully justify how the fraction 11/7 was obtained.</pre>
