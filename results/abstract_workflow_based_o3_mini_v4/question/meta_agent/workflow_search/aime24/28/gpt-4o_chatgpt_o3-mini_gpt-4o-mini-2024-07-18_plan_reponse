Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.",

However, as indicated in the related sub-task, the complete geometric derivation, which involves detailed step-by-step analysis of the tangency conditions and radical simplifications, is not fully provided. More information or decomposition on the derivation steps would be beneficial.\n\nAnswer:18\n[TOO_HARD] Additional step-by-step geometric derivation details of the tangency conditions and radical simplifications are requested to fully justify how the fraction 11/7 was obtained.",
