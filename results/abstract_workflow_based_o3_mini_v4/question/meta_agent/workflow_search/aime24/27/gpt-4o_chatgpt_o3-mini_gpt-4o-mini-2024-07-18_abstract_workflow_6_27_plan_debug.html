    <pre>Related original question:

Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 5: Calculate Q, the quotient when N is divided by 1000. 

 ### thinking #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent QIkW:
Since N = 5694, dividing 5694 by 1000 gives a quotient of 5 (because 5694 = 5 × 1000 + 694). This calculation is straightforward and has been validated.

### answer #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent QIkW:
5

### Sub-task 6: Calculate R, the remainder when N is divided by 1000. 

 ### thinking #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent 4ZUe:
The remainder R is calculated by dividing N = 5694 by 1000. Since 5694 = 5 × 1000 + 694, the remainder is 694.

### answer #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent 4ZUe:
694

### Sub-task 7: Combine Q and R to find Q + R. Ensure logical consistency and correctness. 

 ### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent nMaX (yourself):
We are given that Q = 5 and R = 694. Adding these together, we get Q + R = 5 + 694 = 699.

### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent nMaX (yourself):
699

### Please review the calculation of Q+R. 

 ### feedback #1 by Critic Agent Ei2r:
The calculation of 5 + 694 = 699 is correct. Assuming Q = 5 and R = 694 as given in the chain-of-thought, their sum correctly adds up to 699.

### Sub-task 7: Combine Q and R to find Q + R. Ensure logical consistency and correctness. 

 ### thinking #2 by Chain-of-Thought Agent nMaX (yourself):
The sub-task clearly provides Q = 5 and R = 694 for N = 5694. Adding these together, we get 5 + 694 = 699, which is both logically consistent and correct.

### answer #2 by Chain-of-Thought Agent nMaX (yourself):
699

### Please review the calculation of Q+R. 

 ### feedback #2 by Critic Agent Ei2r:
The calculation of Q+R is correctly executed. Given Q = 5 and R = 694 for N = 5694, their sum 5 + 694 indeed equals 699, which is consistent with the problem&#39;s solution.

### Sub-task 7: Combine Q and R to find Q + R. Ensure logical consistency and correctness. 

 ### thinking #3 by Chain-of-Thought Agent nMaX (yourself):
Since Q is given as 5 and R is given as 694, their sum is 5 + 694 = 699. This is both logically consistent and correct.

### answer #3 by Chain-of-Thought Agent nMaX (yourself):
699

### Please review the calculation of Q+R. 

 ### feedback #3 by Critic Agent Ei2r:
The calculation of Q+R is correct. Given Q = 5 and R = 694, their sum is indeed 5 + 694 = 699. There is no discrepancy in the calculation.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 7: Combine Q and R to find Q + R. Ensure logical consistency and correctness.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
