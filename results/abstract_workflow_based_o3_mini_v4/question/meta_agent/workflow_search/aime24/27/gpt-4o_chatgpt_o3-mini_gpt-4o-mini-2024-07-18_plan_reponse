        "response": "We've verified that for N = 5694, substituting any single digit with 1 produces numbers that are divisible by 7. Specifically: replacing the thousands digit gives 1694 (which is 7\u00d7242), the hundreds digit gives 5194 (7\u00d7742), the tens digit gives 5614 (7\u00d7802), and the units digit gives 5691 (7\u00d7813). This confirms that all digit changes maintain divisibility by 7.\n\nAnswer:All substitutions (1694, 5194, 5614, 5691) are divisible by 7.",
