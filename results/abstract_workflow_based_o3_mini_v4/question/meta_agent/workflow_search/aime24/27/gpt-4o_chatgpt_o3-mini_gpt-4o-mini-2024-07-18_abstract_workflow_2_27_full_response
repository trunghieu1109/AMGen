Changing one digit (say, in the place with weight w) to 1 transforms N into N' = N + w*(1 - original_digit). For N' to be divisible by 7, we must have N + w*(1 - digit) ≡ 0 (mod 7). This is equivalent to N ≡ w*(digit - 1) (mod 7). In our four-digit number with weights 1000, 100, 10, and 1, note that 1000 ≡ 6 (mod 7), 100 ≡ 2 (mod 7), 10 ≡ 3 (mod 7), and 1 ≡ 1 (mod 7). Thus, the conditions become:\n\n• For the thousands digit: N ≡ 6*(a - 1) (mod 7).\n• For the hundreds digit: N ≡ 2*(b - 1) (mod 7).\n• For the tens digit: N ≡ 3*(c - 1) (mod 7).\n• For the ones digit: N ≡ (d - 1) (mod 7).\n\nThis means that for every digit of N, changing that digit to 1 will yield a number divisible by 7 if and only if N satisfies these congruences. In other words, all the expressions 6*(a - 1), 2*(b - 1), 3*(c - 1), and (d - 1) must be congruent to the same residue modulo 7 (namely to N modulo 7).; answer: A number with digits a, b, c, d (so that N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d) becomes divisible by 7 when one digit is changed to 1 if and only if replacing the digit in any place (with weight w) results in N + w*(1 - original_digit) being a multiple of 7. Equivalently, N must satisfy N ≡ 6*(a - 1) ≡ 2*(b - 1) ≡ 3*(c - 1) ≡ (d - 1) (mod 7). This set of congruences is the necessary and sufficient condition for the stated property.\nCoT-SC agent e8Da, determining greatest N, thinking: By expressing the four‐digit number as N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d and noting that replacing a digit by 1 changes the number by a multiple of the digit’s weight, we require that N is congruent modulo 7 to 6(a-1), 2(b-1), 3(c-1), and (d-1) (since 1000, 100, 10, 1 are congruent to 6, 2, 3, 1 mod 7 respectively). In order for N (which itself is 1000a+100b+10c+d and hence ≡6a+2b+3c+d mod 7) to be consistent with all these, one may derive a condition by equating 6(a-1) (the value coming from the thousands place) with 6a+2b+3c+d; simplifying modulo 7 leads to the requirement 3a ≡ 1 mod 7, which forces a ≡ 5 mod 7. Since a is a digit from 1 to 9, a must be 5. The remaining congruences then become b ≡ 3(a-1)+1, c ≡ 2(a-1)+1, and d ≡ 6(a-1)+1 modulo 7. With a = 5 (so a - 1 = 4), these yield b ≡ 13 ≡ 6, c ≡ 9, and d ≡ 25 ≡ 4 mod 7. Looking among digits 0–9 for the maximum possible digit in each residue class gives b = 6, c = 9, and for d the possibilities (0 or 7 are the digits ≡ 0 or 4? Here d must be ≡ 4; the only option within 0–9 is 4) so d = 4. This produces N = 5694. A quick check shows that if we replace any digit with 1 (yielding 1694, 5194, 5614, and 5691), each result is divisible by 7. Thus, 5694 is the greatest four‐digit N with the property.; answer: 5694\nCoT-SC agent uBn1, determining greatest N, thinking: We begin by letting N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d (with a ≠ 0) and note that when we change one digit (with weight w) to 1 the new number is N + w*(1 − original_digit). Requiring this to be divisible by 7 for every digit position gives four conditions. For example, replacing the thousands digit yields the requirement that N − 1000*(a − 1) is divisible by 7, so that N ≡ 1000*(a − 1) (mod 7). In a similar way we obtain the system (after reducing modulo 7, and using 1000 ≡ 6, 100 ≡ 2, 10 ≡ 3, and 1 ≡ 1 mod 7):\n\u2003\u2003(1)\u20036a + 2b + 3c + d ≡ 6(a − 1)\u2003⟹\u20032b + 3c + d + 6 ≡ 0\n\u2003\u2003(2)\u20036a + 2b + 3c + d ≡ 2(b − 1)\u2003⟹\u20036a + 3c + d + 2 ≡ 0\n\u2003\u2003(3)\u20036a + 2b + 3c + d ≡ 3(c − 1)\u2003⟹\u20036a + 2b + d + 3 ≡ 0\n\u2003\u2003(4)\u20036a + 2b + 3c + d ≡ (d − 1)\u2003\u2003\u2003⟹\u20036a + 2b + 3c + 1 ≡ 0\nSubtracting (4) from (3) gives: [6a + 2b + d + 3] − [6a + 2b + 3c + 1] = d − 3c + 2 ≡ 0 so that\n\u2003\u2003d ≡ 3c − 2\u2003 (mod 7).\nSubtracting (3) from (2) yields: [6a + 3c + d + 2] − [6a + 2b + d + 3] = 3c − 2b − 1 ≡ 0 so that\n\u2003\u20033c ≡ 2b + 1\u2003 (mod 7).\nAlso, subtracting (2) from (1) gives: [2b + 3c + d + 6] − [6a + 3c + d + 2] = 2b − 6a + 4 ≡ 0 so that\n\u2003\u20036a ≡ 2b + 4\u2003 (mod 7)\u2003⟹\u2003divide by 2 (which is invertible modulo 7) to get\n\u2003\u20033a ≡ b + 2\u2003 (mod 7) or equivalently\u2003b ≡ 3a − 2 (mod 7).\nNow using equation (2) in a different way (or combining with (4)) one may show that the tens digit must satisfy\n\u2003\u2003c ≡ 2a − 1\u2003 (mod 7).\nUp to this point the four conditions force the digits (mod 7) to be interrelated. In particular one obtains that a must satisfy, upon substitution into (4),\n\u2003\u20036a + 2(3a − 2) + 3(2a − 1) + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 7) → 18a − 6 ≡ 0 (mod 7) → 18a ≡ 6 (mod 7).\nSince 18 ≡ 4 (mod 7) this becomes\n\u2003\u20034a ≡ 6 (mod 7)\u2003⟹\u2003a ≡ 6×(4⁻¹) (mod 7).\nNoting that the multiplicative inverse of 4 modulo 7 is 2 (since 4×2 = 8 ≡ 1 mod 7), we get\n\u2003\u2003a ≡ 12 ≡ 5 (mod 7).\nBecause a is the thousands digit (and therefore 1 ≤ a ≤ 9) the only possibility is a = 5.\nThen b ≡ 3a − 2 = 15 − 2 = 13 ≡ 6 (mod 7). Since b is a digit (0–9) the only choice is b = 6. Similarly, from c ≡ 2a − 1 = 10 − 1 = 9 (mod 7) one may choose c = 9 (since 9 is available and is as high as possible). Finally, d ≡ 3c − 2 = 27 − 2 = 25 ≡ 4 (mod 7) forces d = 4. \nThus the four‐digit number is N = 1000×5 + 100×6 + 10×9 + 4 = 5694.\nOne may check that replacing each digit by 1 indeed gives numbers divisible by 7 (for example, replacing the thousands digit yields 1694, and 1694 ÷ 7 = 242). \nTherefore, the greatest four‐digit N with the required property is 5694.; answer: 5694\nCoT-SC agent iVvi, determining greatest N, thinking: The divisibility‐requirement means that if N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d, then replacing any one digit by 1 must yield a multiple of 7. In other words, the four numbers\n\u2003\u2003(1000·1 + 100b + 10c + d),\u2003(1000a + 100·1 + 10c + d),\u2003(1000a + 100b + 10·1 + d) and (1000a + 100b + 10c + 1)\nare all divisible by 7. A short computation shows that if we let N mod 7 = r then by writing the weights 1000, 100, 10 and 1 in mod 7 (namely 6, 2, 3 and 1, respectively) the conditions become\n\u2003\u20036(a – 1) ≡  r,\u20032(b – 1) ≡  r,\u20033(c – 1) ≡  r,\u2003(d – 1) ≡  r\u2003 (mod 7).\nOne may show that in order for these congruences to be simultaneously compatible with N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d (that is, with 6a + 2b + 3c + d ≡ r mod 7), the digits must satisfy a system of four congruences. Working with the equivalent system obtained by subtracting the congruence from N (which is based on writing\n\u2003\u2003N ≡ 6a + 2b + 3c + d  ≡ 6(a – 1)\u2003≡ 2(b – 1)\u2003≡ 3(c – 1)\u2003≡ (d – 1)\u2003(mod 7) \none derives (after minor rearrangement) the system\n\u2003\u20032b + 3c + d ≡ 1,\u20036a + 2b + d ≡ 4,\u20036a + 3c + d ≡ 5,\u20036a + 2b + 3c ≡ 6\u2003(mod 7).\nA search for a four–digit number (with a ≥ 1) maximizing N shows that one consistent solution is obtained by taking a = 5, b = 6, c = 9 and d = 4. One may verify that when a digit of 5694 is replaced by 1 the resulting numbers are, respectively, 1694, 5194, 5614 and 5691 – and each of these is divisible by 7.
