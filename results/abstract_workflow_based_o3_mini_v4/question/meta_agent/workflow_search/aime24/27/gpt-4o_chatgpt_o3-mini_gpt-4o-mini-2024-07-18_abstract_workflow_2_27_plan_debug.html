    <pre>Related original question:

Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$..

### Sub-task 4: Ensure all digit substitutions result in a number divisible by 7. 

 ### thinking #3 by Debate Agent UaWr:
For N = 5694, verifying the condition involves checking each substitution: replacing the thousands digit with 1 gives 1694, replacing the hundreds digit gives 5194, replacing the tens digit gives 5614, and replacing the units digit gives 5691. Each of these numbers is divisible by 7 (1694 = 7×242, 5194 = 7×742, 5614 = 7×802, 5691 = 7×813), confirming that the property holds.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent siIg:
We confirm that for N = 5694, replacing each digit with 1 produces numbers that are divisible by 7. Specifically, changing the thousands digit gives 1694 which is 7×242, the hundreds digit gives 5194 which is 7×742, the tens digit gives 5614 which is 7×802, and the units digit gives 5691 which is 7×813.

### answer #3 by Debate Agent UaWr:
All substitutions (1694, 5194, 5614, 5691) result in numbers divisible by 7.

### answer #3 by Debate Agent siIg:
Yes. For N = 5694: replacing the thousands digit yields 1694 (7×242), the hundreds digit yields 5194 (7×742), the tens digit yields 5614 (7×802), and the units digit yields 5691 (7×813), ensuring that all substitutions result in a number divisible by 7.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Confirm that all digit changes maintain divisibility by 7.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
