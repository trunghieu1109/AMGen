    <pre>Related original question:

Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\fracx^220- \fracy^224 = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi..

### Sub-task 9: Make decision on final format. 

 ### thinking by Final Decision Agent R79w:
The final answer is 80, but the additional decomposition using hyperbolic substitution is necessary to fully justify and verify the result. Hence, I include a [TOO_HARD] mark along with a request for a detailed derivation, because without these steps the derivation lacks rigorous verification that BD² cannot be less than 80 for all such rhombi.

### answer by Final Decision Agent R79w:
80
[TOO_HARD] Please provide a detailed hyperbolic substitution derivation (e.g., via tanh functions) to rigorously verify that BD² cannot be less than 80 for all such rhombi.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 10: Derive the final numerical answer for BD^2 ensuring clarity and correctness.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>The final numerical answer obtained through hyperbolic substitution and optimization techniques is 80. However, providing a full derivation that rigorously shows that BD^2 cannot be less than 80 for all such rhombi requires a detailed analysis using hyperbolic parametrizations (for example, using tanh functions) and verifying the optimizing conditions. Since the full derivation is quite involved and was not completely provided, this answer is marked [TOO_HARD] and requests a detailed decomposition of the hyperbolic substitution process.

Answer:80 [TOO_HARD] Please provide a detailed derivation using hyperbolic substitution (e.g., via tanh functions) to rigorously justify that BD² cannot be less than 80 for all such rhombi.</pre>
