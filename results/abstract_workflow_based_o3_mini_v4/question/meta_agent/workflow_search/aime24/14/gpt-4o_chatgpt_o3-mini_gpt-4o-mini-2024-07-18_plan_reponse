        "response": "Both Debate Agents derived that the expression for BD^2 is 480*(m^2+1)/(6*m^2-5) for the eligible range of m^2, and it monotonically decreases as m^2 increases. As m^2 approaches 6/5, BD^2 approaches 480 from above. Therefore, the greatest real number that is less than BD^2 for all such configurations is 480.\n\nAnswer:480",

        "response": "The final numerical answer obtained through hyperbolic substitution and optimization techniques is 80. However, providing a full derivation that rigorously shows that BD^2 cannot be less than 80 for all such rhombi requires a detailed analysis using hyperbolic parametrizations (for example, using tanh functions) and verifying the optimizing conditions. Since the full derivation is quite involved and was not completely provided, this answer is marked [TOO_HARD] and requests a detailed decomposition of the hyperbolic substitution process.\n\nAnswer:80 [TOO_HARD] Please provide a detailed derivation using hyperbolic substitution (e.g., via tanh functions) to rigorously justify that BD\u00b2 cannot be less than 80 for all such rhombi.",
