    <pre>Related original question:

Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\fracx^220- \fracy^224 = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 6: Optimize BD^2 expression and find the greatest real number less than its maximum. 

 ### thinking #3 by Debate Agent lyoi:
Using the expression BD^2 = 480*(m^2+1)/(6*m^2-5) with m^2 in the interval (5/6,6/5), the function is strictly decreasing. As m^2 approaches 6/5, BD^2 tends to 480. Since BD^2 is always greater than 480 for the acceptable configurations, the maximum lower bound is 480.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent VyH2:
Using the derivations provided, we have BD^2 = 480*(m^2+1)/(6*m^2-5) with m^2 in the interval (5/6, 6/5). As m^2 increases, the function decreases, and in the limit as m^2 tends to 6/5, BD^2 approaches 480. Since BD^2 is always greater than 480 for any valid configuration of the rhombus, the greatest real number that is less than BD^2 for every such rhombus is 480.

### answer #3 by Debate Agent lyoi:
480

### answer #3 by Debate Agent VyH2:
480

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Make final decision on optimized BD^2.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>Both Debate Agents derived that the expression for BD^2 is 480*(m^2+1)/(6*m^2-5) for the eligible range of m^2, and it monotonically decreases as m^2 increases. As m^2 approaches 6/5, BD^2 approaches 480 from above. Therefore, the greatest real number that is less than BD^2 for all such configurations is 480.
