    <pre>Related original question:

Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 5: Integrate results to determine the number of residents owning all four items. 

 ### thinking #3 by Debate Agent nTMc:
The previous sub-task chain-of-thought uniformly established that 73 residents own the three non-candy items. Since every resident also owns a bag of candy hearts, those same 73 residents own all four items.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent Iogd:
Based on the provided chain-of-thought and sub-task explanations, 73 residents own all the three non-candy items (diamond ring, golf clubs, and garden spade). Since every resident owns a bag of candy hearts, these 73 residents also own candy hearts. Thus, 73 residents own all four items.

### answer #3 by Debate Agent nTMc:
73

### answer #3 by Debate Agent Iogd:
73

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 5: Final decision for all four items.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
