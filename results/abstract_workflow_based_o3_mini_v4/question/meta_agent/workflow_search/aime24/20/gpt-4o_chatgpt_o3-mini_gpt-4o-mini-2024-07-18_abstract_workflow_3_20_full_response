Since the number must have exactly two digits, a must be nonzero (specifically, 1 ≤ a ≤ b−1) while c can range from 0 up to b−1. This implies that the smallest two-digit number in base b is when a = 1 and c = 0, i.e. n = b, and the largest is when a = b−1 and c = b−1, i.e. n = (b−1) * b + (b−1) = b² − 1. Thus, all positive integers n that can be expressed as two-digit numbers in base b are given by all numbers n satisfying b ≤ n ≤ b²−1. Alternatively, they can be enumerated as n = a * b + c, where a ∈ {1, 2, …, b−1} and c ∈ {0, 1, …, b−1}.; answer: For any integer b ≥ 2, the positive integers n that have exactly two digits in base b are those that can be written as n = a*b + c where a = 1, 2, …, b−1 and c = 0, 1, …, b−1; equivalently, these are all n such that b ≤ n ≤ b² − 1.\nCoT-SC agent bK7P, calculating two-digit conversions and sums, thinking: For a two‐digit number in base b, we write n = a*b + c with a (the tens digit) satisfying 1 ≤ a ≤ b−1 and c (the units digit) satisfying 0 ≤ c ≤ b−1. Thus for any such n, the representation is directly given by the digits a and c. Their sum is simply a + c. This is equivalent to computing the digits as a = floor(n / b) and c = n mod b, with the digit sum equal to floor(n / b) + (n mod b).; answer: For each n = a*b + c (with a in {1, 2, …, b−1} and c in {0, 1, …, b−1}), the base-b digits are a and c; the sum of these digits is a + c.\nCoT-SC agent V0nr, calculating two-digit conversions and sums, thinking: For any two-digit number n in base b written as n = a*b + c (with a in {1,...,b-1} and c in {0,...,b-1}), the two digits in base b are simply a (the first digit) and c (the second digit). Their sum is computed by a + c. This process applies to every n in the range b ≤ n ≤ b^2 - 1, as established in Sub-task 1.; answer: For each n = a*b + c (with 1 ≤ a ≤ b−1 and 0 ≤ c ≤ b−1), the corresponding two digits in base b are a (the tens digit) and c (the ones digit), and their sum is a + c.\nCoT-SC agent eowc, calculating two-digit conversions and sums, thinking: For each two-digit number n in base b, we can write it as n = a * b + c, where a (the tens digit) is between 1 and b - 1 (to ensure that there are exactly two digits) and c (the ones digit) is between 0 and b - 1. Thus, for each n, the base-b digits are given by a = ⌊n/b⌋ and c = n mod b, and their sum is a + c. This is a direct derivation from the representation, so the answer naturally results in the observation that for every n in the range b ≤ n ≤ b² − 1 (i.e. every two‐digit number in base b) the digits and sum are determined as stated.; answer: For every n = a*b + c, where a ∈ {1, 2, …, b − 1} and c ∈ {0, 1, …, b − 1}, the two digits in base b are: a = ⌊n/b⌋ (the tens digit) and c = n mod b (the ones digit). Their sum is simply a + c.\nReflexion CoT agent d4iT, filtering b-beautiful numbers, thinking: To filter the numbers n (where n = a*b + c with 1 ≤ a ≤ b − 1 and 0 ≤ c ≤ b − 1) such that the digit sum equals √n, we set a + c = √n. Since n is defined as a*b + c, this condition becomes a + c = √(a*b + c). Squaring both sides gives (a + c)^2 = a*b + c. Therefore, the filtering condition for each candidate number is to keep only those pairs (a, c) for which (a + c)^2 equals a*b + c. This is the precise criterion to decide if n is b–iteautiful.; answer: For every two-digit number n in base b, represented as n = a*b + c with a in {1,2,...,b−1} and c in {0,1,...,b−1}, n is selected if (a + c)^2 = a*b + c.\nCritic agent KMi2, feedback on filtering, thinking: The filtering method works by setting up the equation (a + c)^2 = a * b + c to capture the condition that the digit sum equals √n when n is written as a * b + c. However, there are several limitations. First, squaring the equation can introduce extraneous solutions; therefore, it is essential to verify that a + c really equals √n and not just that its square equals n. Second, the method inherently assumes that √n is an integer, which is only guaranteed if n is a perfect square. This means the filtering may miss nuances when n isn’t a perfect square or when rounding issues could arise if misapplied. Third, the approach is specifically designed for two-digit numbers in base b and does not easily generalize to numbers with more than two digits without additional considerations. Lastly, for large values of b, checking all candidate pairs (a, c) by brute force might become computationally inefficient, as the range of possible digits increases.; answer: The key limitations are: (1) the potential introduction of extraneous solutions when squaring the equation, necessitating a final check that a + c exactly equals √n; (2) the reliance on n being a perfect square, which is implicit in the condition but must be explicitly verified; (3) the restriction to two-digit numbers in base b, which limits the method’s applicability to more general cases; and (4) the inefficiency of brute-force checking when b is large, since the number of (a, c) pairs grows with b.\nReflexion CoT agent d4iT, refining filtered results, thinking: To filter two‐digit numbers in base b (n = a*b + c with 1 ≤ a ≤ b−1 and 0 ≤ c ≤ b−1) so that the digit sum equals √n, we use the following approach: For each candidate pair (a, c), compute n = a*b + c and the digit sum S = a + c. Then, since √n must be an integer (i.e. n must be a perfect square), we check if (a + c)^2 equals n. This is equivalent to solving (a + c)^2 = a*b + c. One must be cautious about exactly squaring the digit sum because squaring can sometimes hide mismatches if one does not confirm that a + c is indeed the integral square root of n. Therefore the filtering is valid as long as one verifies n is a perfect square and the digit sum is exactly its square root. The limitations are that the method presumes n is a perfect square and any extraneous solutions introduced from squaring need to be checked by explicitly recalculating √n, and that the approach is limited to two‐digit numbers in base b.; answer: For every two-digit number n in base b given by n = a*b + c (with a in {1, 2, ..., b−1} and c in {0, 1, ..., b−1}), we filter n by computing S = a + c and checking if (a + c)^2 = n. Only those n for which (a + c)^2 exactly equals n (ensuring that √n = a + c is an integer) are accepted as b‐beautiful. This method requires verifying that n is a perfect square and is specific to two-digit numbers, thus bearing limitations if one wishes to generalize to numbers with more digits.\nCritic agent KMi2, feedback on filtering, thinking: The filtering method works by considering only two-digit numbers in base b, expressed as n = a*b + c with 1 ≤ a ≤ b−1 and 0 ≤ c ≤ b−1, and then checking if the digit sum (a + c) satisfies (a + c)^2 = n. However, its limitations are several. First, it applies only to two-digit numbers; any b-beautiful numbers with more digits are ignored. Second, the method relies on the assumption that if (a + c)^2 equals n then √n will be exactly (a + c) without any further verification, which can potentially allow extraneous solutions if the perfect square check isn’t performed carefully. Third, squaring the sum could hide edge cases or miscounts if there are issues related to digit constraints inherent in base b representations (for example, ensuring that a is nonzero and accounting for any peculiar behavior at the extremes of the digit ranges).; answer: The filter’s limitations are that it is strictly confined to two-digit numbers in base b and does not generalize to numbers with more digits. It assumes that checking (a + c)^2 = n is enough to verify that n is a perfect square with √n = a + c, potentially allowing extraneous or incorrect cases if n is not rigorously verified as a perfect square. Moreover, the method does not address any nuances arising from base-specific properties, such as possible anomalies in digit extraction, digit sum calculation, or edge cases (like handling leading zeroes or unusual digit configurations), which could undermine the validity of the filter in more general settings.\nReflexion CoT agent d4iT, refining filtered results, thinking: For each two‐digit number n in base b (n = a*b + c with a ∈ {1,2,...,b−1} and c ∈ {0,1,...,b−1}), the filtering process involves computing the digit sum S = a + c. We then require that S is indeed the square root of n, which is equivalent to having (a + c)^2 = n. This ensures that √n = a + c and that n is a perfect square. Note that this procedure inherently assumes n is a perfect square and applies only to two-digit numbers in base b. It may also introduce extraneous solutions if one does not explicitly verify that n, when square-rooted, equals a + c. These are its limitations.; answer: For each candidate two-digit number n = a*b + c (with a from 1 to b−1 and c from 0 to b−1), calculate S = a + c. If (a + c)^2 = n, then include n as a b‐beautiful number. This filtering ensures that √n = a + c, with the limitation that it only applies to two-digit numbers and n must be a perfect square.\nCritic agent KMi2, feedback on filtering, thinking: The filtering method works by restricting attention to two-digit base b numbers (with a nonzero first digit) and then checking if (a + c)^2 equals the number n. However, this approach has several limitations. First, it only considers numbers that have exactly two digits, so any numbers that might satisfy a similar condition but have more digits in base b are not examined. Second, it implicitly assumes that n is a perfect square without an independent verification of this fact outside of the equality, which could lead to overlooking potential numerical issues or extraneous solutions. Third, while the digits a and c are confined to their valid ranges, the method does not explicitly address potential edge cases (such as handling leading zeros or ensuring the uniqueness of the digit representation) that could arise in different interpretations of digit representations in base b.; answer: The filtering of b-beautiful numbers is limited because it only applies to numbers with exactly two digits and assumes that n is a perfect square by enforcing (a + c)^2 = n. This means it may not capture all valid scenarios or handle edge cases like leading zeros, and it does not extend to numbers with more than two digits. Additionally, there is an inherent assumption that the base-b representation is strictly two-digit without any ambiguity, which might exclude borderline cases if not carefully checked.\nReflexion CoT agent d4iT, refining filtered results, thinking: The answer details that for each two‐digit number n in base b (n = a*b + c with 1 ≤ a ≤ b−1 and 0 ≤ c ≤ b−1), we compute the digit sum S = a + c and then check if S^2 equals n, ensuring that √n = S. This filtering works because if S^2 = n then n is a perfect square with its integral square root equal to the digit sum. However, this technique is limited because it only considers numbers with exactly two digits in base b, assumes n is a perfect square, and can potentially introduce extraneous solutions if the check isn’t carefully verified. Furthermore, the method does not extend to numbers with more digits which may also be b‐beautiful, nor does it handle edge cases in digit representation.; answer: For every two-digit number n represented as n = a*b + c (with a in {1, 2, …, b−1} and c in {0, 1, …, b−1}), compute S = a + c. Then filter n by testing whether (a + c)^2 = n. Only those n for which this equation holds have √n = a + c and are considered b‐beautiful numbers. Limitations include that this method only applies to two-digit numbers, requires n to be a perfect square (which may overlook cases outside this range), and depends on correctly verifying that n’s square root exactly equals the digit sum.\nReflexion CoT agent d7R2, aggregating counts of valid b-beautiful numbers, thinking: The aggregation of the count means that we must sum (or list) how many choices of (a, c) (with a from 1 to b−1 and c from 0 to b−1) lead to a number n = a*b + c that is b‐beautiful (that is, a + c = √n, so n = (a+c)²). Rewriting n = (a + c)² and substituting c = s − a (with s = a + c) gives a*b + s − a = s², or equivalently s² − s = a(b − 1). Hence for any given base b the equation forces a = s(s − 1)/(b − 1) and c = s − s(s − 1)/(b − 1). Additionally, since n must be a two‐digit number in base b we have b ≤ s² ≤ b² − 1 and the digits must satisfy 1 ≤ a ≤ b − 1 and 0 ≤ c ≤ b − 1. Thus, the count for a given base b is given by the number of integers s satisfying the following conditions: (i) s² lies between b and b² − 1, (ii) (b − 1) divides s(s − 1) (so that a is an integer), and (iii) the resulting a = s(s − 1)/(b − 1) and c = s − a both fall into their respective allowed ranges. In summary, if we define N(b) as the number of b‐beautiful numbers, then one expression for it is\n\n\u2003\u2003N(b) = #{ s ∈ ℤ : ceil(√b) ≤ s ≤ b − 1, (b − 1) | s(s − 1), 1 ≤ s(s − 1)/(b − 1) ≤ b − 1, and 0 ≤ s − s(s − 1)/(b − 1) ≤ b − 1 }.\n\nIt appears that a complete aggregation (or a closed‐form formula) requires further information or decomposition from Sub-task 3 (like explicit counts for particular values of s) which was not provided. Therefore, while the above expression is a conceptual aggregation, the answer remains in terms of a summation over the valid s. Further detail (for example a computed table for several bases) would be necessary to give a more concrete numerical aggregation for each base.; answer: [TOO_HARD] The aggregation is given by summing over all integers s with ceil(√b) ≤ s ≤ b−1 such that (b−1) divides s(s−1) and the corresponding digits a = s(s−1)/(b−1) and c = s − a satisfy 1 ≤ a ≤ b−1 and 0 ≤ c ≤ b−1. Additional details (or a computed example) from Sub-task 3 would be required to express a complete closed‐form count.\nCritic agent 9vCF, feedback on aggregation, thinking: The provided aggregation formulation is conceptually on track but has several limitations. It expresses the count N(b) as a sum over s subject to multiple conditions, yet it does not offer a closed‐form solution or address the handling of boundary cases (for instance, ensuring that the computed digits a and c strictly remain within the valid ranges). Moreover, the divisibility condition (b - 1)|s(s - 1) is imposed without an in‐depth discussion of its impact on the distribution of valid s values, and the lack of explicit computed examples for particular bases makes it hard to fully assess the correctness of the aggregation.; answer: In summary, the main limitations are: (1) the reliance on abstract divisibility and range conditions without numerical verification, (2) the absence of a closed‐form count or a simplified expression that clearly enumerates all valid b‐beautiful numbers, (3) insufficient treatment of edge cases regarding the valid ranges for s as well as the induced ranges for the digits a and c, and (4) a lack of decomposed examples that would help validate the aggregation step by step.\n[TOO_HARD]\nAdditional information request: A detailed breakdown with computed examples for small bases and an analysis of how the divisibility condition partitions the set of s values would help clarify and potentially resolve the ambiguities present in the aggregation calculation. This decomposition is necessary to ensure that all conditions are consistently and completely applied.\nReflexion CoT agent d7R2, refining aggregation, thinking: The aggregation of b‐beautiful numbers is based on the fact that for any two-digit number in base b we can write it as n = a*b + c with a and c within their valid ranges. By imposing the condition that a + c = √n (i.e. n = (a+c)²) and letting s = a + c, we reach the equation s² = a*b + c. Substituting c = s - a leads to s² = a*(b - 1) + s and hence a = s(s - 1)/(b - 1). The valid two-digit representation forces s² to be in the range [b, b² - 1] and the digits a and c must be in the ranges 1 ≤ a ≤ b−1 and 0 ≤ c ≤ b−1, respectively. Thus, one can write the count of b‐beautiful numbers as the number of integers s that satisfy:\n\n1. ceil(√b) ≤ s ≤ b - 1 (to ensure s² lies between b and b² - 1),\n2. (b - 1) divides s(s - 1) (so that a is an integer),\n3. a = s(s - 1)/(b - 1) lies in the range 1 ≤ a ≤ b - 1, and\n4. c = s - a lies in the range 0 ≤ c ≤ b - 1.\n\nHence, the aggregated count can be written conceptually as:\n\nN(b) = #{ s ∈ ℤ : ceil(√b) ≤ s ≤ b - 1, (b - 1)|s(s - 1), 1 ≤ s(s - 1)/(b - 1) ≤ b - 1, 0 ≤ s - s(s - 1)/(b - 1) ≤ b - 1 }.\n\nLimitations of this aggregation include:\n• It does not provide a closed-form expression or simplified summation formula; it only sets up the conditions that s must satisfy.\n• The divisibility condition (b - 1)|s(s - 1) is stated without an analysis of its frequency or impact on the valid s values for a given base b.\n• Boundary cases (for example, at the ends of the interval for s and digit ranges for a and c) are acknowledged but not treated explicitly with examples.\n• Without computed examples or further decomposition of the conditions, it is hard to assess if all cases (especially edge cases) have been adequately captured.\n\nOverall, while the formulation provides the correct conceptual framework for aggregating b-beautiful numbers, it is limited by the lack of explicit calculation or closed‐form representation and a detailed treatment of boundary conditions.\n\n[TOO_HARD] Further information or a step-by-step decomposition (for instance, analyzing the divisibility condition for specific small bases, or providing a table of counts for several values of b) would help in refining this aggregation into a more concrete answer.; answer: N(b) can be aggregated by counting the integers s satisfying:\n\u2003\u2003ceil(√b) ≤ s ≤ b - 1,\n\u2003\u2003(b - 1) divides s(s - 1) (so that a = s(s - 1)/(b - 1) is an integer), and\n\u2003\u2003the digits a = s(s - 1)/(b - 1) and c = s - a fall in the ranges 1 ≤ a ≤ b - 1 and 0 ≤ c ≤ b - 1, respectively.\nThis formulation, however, is limited because it does not provide a closed‐form solution, does not fully analyze the divisibility condition or boundary cases, and lacks computed examples. [TOO_HARD] Additional decomposition—such as explicit checks for small bases or an analysis of the behavior of s(s - 1) mod (b - 1)—is needed to arrive at a complete closed‐form count.\nCritic agent 9vCF, feedback on aggregation, thinking: The aggregation formulation is conceptually on track by defining s = a + c and setting up conditions for s to yield a valid two‐digit number in base b. However, its limitations lie in the lack of explicit computability: the method does not result in a closed‐form expression, and the divisibility condition (b - 1)|(s(s - 1)) is not analyzed in terms of its frequency or distribution over the interval ceil(√b) ≤ s ≤ b - 1. Additionally, the treatment of boundary cases for s, and hence for the corresponding digits a and c, is insufficiently detailed. Finally, without computed examples for small bases, it is hard to verify that all edge cases have been properly considered.; answer: The aggregation calculation is limited because (1) it provides only a conceptual framework rather than an explicit, closed‐form count for N(b), (2) it does not analyze or simplify the divisibility condition (b - 1)|(s(s - 1)) or quantify how often it holds, (3) the boundaries for s—in particular, at s = ceil(√b) and s = b - 1—are not treated with detailed examples or verification of the digit constraints, and (4) it lacks computational evidence or a concrete table of counts for small bases to support the theoretical formulation.\n[TOO_HARD]\nInfo Request: Could you provide specific computed examples for small bases (such as b = 10, 11, etc.) or a step-by-step breakdown of how the divisibility condition impacts the valid choices for s? This additional information would help justify the limitations noted in the current aggregation method.\nReflexion CoT agent d7R2, refining aggregation, thinking: To aggregate the count of b‐beautiful numbers, we first set s = a + c and require that n = (a + c)^2 (i.e., n = s^2) be a two‐digit number in base b. This forces s^2 to lie between b and b^2 − 1, meaning s must lie in the range ceil(√b) ≤ s ≤ b − 1. Moreover, since n = a*b + c and c = s − a, equating n = s^2 gives s^2 = a*(b − 1) + s, which leads to the relation a = s(s − 1)/(b − 1). For the number to have a valid representation in base b, we must have 1 ≤ a ≤ b − 1 and 0 ≤ c = s − a ≤ b − 1. In summary, the aggregated count can be expressed as:\n\nN(b) = #{ s ∈ ℤ : ceil(√b) ≤ s ≤ b − 1, (b−1) divides s(s−1), 1 ≤ s(s − 1)/(b − 1) ≤ b − 1, and 0 ≤ s − s(s − 1)/(b − 1) ≤ b − 1 }.\n\nThe limitations of this aggregation are that it does not provide a closed‐form expression, the impact of the divisibility condition (b − 1)|(s(s − 1)) is not explicitly analyzed (i.e. how often it is met over the interval), and the treatment of edge cases and boundary conditions is not fully detailed. This lack of computed examples for particular small bases further hampers the explicit evaluation of N(b).; answer: N(b) can be expressed as N(b)= #{ s in ℤ : ceil(√b) ≤ s ≤ b − 1, (b − 1) divides s(s − 1), 1 ≤ s(s − 1)/(b − 1) ≤ b − 1, and 0 ≤ s − s(s − 1)/(b − 1) ≤ b − 1 }.\n[TOO_HARD] Additional computed examples for specific bases and a detailed decomposition of the divisibility and boundary conditions are requested to refine this aggregation into a more explicit closed‐form answer.\nCritic agent 9vCF, feedback on aggregation, thinking: The aggregation calculation summarizes the count in a symbolic manner without breaking down the impact of each condition. Specifically, it does not provide a closed‐form expression and fails to analyze in detail how often the divisibility requirement (b−1 divides s(s−1)) holds over the range for s. Additionally, the treatment of the boundary conditions (the interval from ceil(√b) to b − 1) and the consistency of the digit constraints with a and c are not fully detailed.; answer: Limitations include: (1) The divisibility condition (b−1)|(s(s−1)) is not explicitly decomposed or illustrated with examples, causing ambiguity in its frequency and impact over the interval; (2) There is insufficient analysis of the edge cases and boundary conditions (i.e., how s exactly ranges to yield valid digit representations in base b); (3) The approach lacks computed examples for specific small bases that would validate and clarify the aggregation process; [TOO_HARD]\nAdditional decomposition: It would be beneficial to compute explicit cases for small bases and to analyze separately the instances when s(s−1) is divisible by (b−1), and to show how the digit constraints 1 ≤ a ≤ b − 1 and 0 ≤ c ≤ b − 1 interact with these conditions. This additional detail is crucial because the complexity of the divisibility condition makes a simple aggregate count hard to justify without further breakdown.\nReflexion CoT agent d7R2, refining aggregation, thinking: The aggregated count of b-beautiful numbers is expressed symbolically as the number of integers s that satisfy a series of conditions, arising from the representation n = a*b + c with a + c = s and n = s². However, the formulation only sets up the conditions: s must lie between ceil(√b) and b−1, (b−1) must divide s(s−1) so that a = s(s−1)/(b−1) is integral, and both resulting digits a and c must fall within their valid ranges. This symbolic aggregation does not yield a closed-form expression and the frequency of the divisibility condition, as well as the handling of edge cases for s, a, and c are not fully decomposed. Thus, the problem remains too complex without further computed examples or detailed analysis of these conditions.; answer: N(b) = #{ s ∈ ℤ : ceil(√b) ≤ s ≤ b−1, (b−1) divides s(s−1), 1 ≤ s(s−1)/(b−1) ≤ b−1, and 0 ≤ s − s(s−1)/(b−1) ≤ b−1 }.\n[TOO_HARD]\nAdditional information, such as computed examples for specific small bases or a thorough analysis of the divisibility condition (b−1)|(s(s−1)), is requested to resolve the inherent limitations and to refine this aggregation into a closed-form solution.\nDebate agent PmXG, round 0, identifying base with more than 10 b-beautiful numbers, thinking: The problem reduces to finding b such that the two‐digit b-beautiful numbers n = s^2 (with s = a+c) produced via a*(b - 1) = s(s − 1) yield more than 10 solutions. In our approach one observes that for a fixed base b, writing n = a·b + c with a + c = s and a = s(s − 1)/(b − 1) (with 1 ≤ a ≤ b − 1 and 0 ≤ c = s − a ≤ b − 1), the key divisibility condition is (b − 1) divides s(s − 1). Using the Chinese remainder theorem one deduces that, modulo (b − 1), the number of solutions to X(X − 1) = 0 is 2^r, where r is the number of distinct prime divisors of (b − 1). Since n = s^2 must be two-digit in base b, s is forced to range between ceil(√b) and b − 1. In the full residue system modulo (b − 1) there can be at most 2^r potential candidate values for s that satisfy (b − 1) | s(s − 1) (each valid residue appears at most once as s is bounded by b − 1). To have more than 10 b-beautiful numbers it is necessary that 2^r > 10, i.e. r ≥ 4. The smallest integer having four distinct prime factors is 210 = 2·3·5·7, so b − 1 = 210 and hence b = 211. (A detailed analysis checking the precise restrictions on s is needed, so while b = 211 is our best candidate, a fully rigorous derivation would require further computational verification of the digit constraints.); answer: 211\n[TOO_HARD]: Further detailed computations and explicit verification of the s range (including the restrictions on a and c) are requested to fully decompose the problem and confirm that b = 211 is indeed the least base with more than 10 b-beautiful integers.\nDebate agent gcco, round 0, identifying base with more than 10 b-beautiful numbers, thinking: The formulation of the b-beautiful numbers involves several constraints that have not been fully decomposed into a workable closed-form expression. In particular, the divisibility condition (b-1)|(s(s-1)) and the ranges for s, a, and c introduce complications that prevent pinning down an exact base b where there are more than ten b-beautiful numbers using the available information. Further computed examples for small bases and a more thorough analysis of these constraints are needed to ascertain the exact base. Due to these limitations, the problem is currently too complicated to resolve with the present details.; answer: [TOO_HARD]\nAdditional computed examples and a detailed analysis of the divisibility condition (b-1)|(s(s-1)) are required to fully resolve the constraints and to determine the least integer base b>=2 for which there are more than ten b-beautiful numbers.\nDebate agent PmXG, round 1, identifying base with more than 10 b-beautiful numbers, thinking: The analysis using the divisibility conditions and the range restrictions for s suggests that b = 211 is the candidate base, but the constraints involving the digits a and c still require further verification by computed examples. Thus, although 211 appears to be the least base with more than ten b-beautiful integers, a complete rigorous decomposition (including explicit testing of the range and divisibility conditions) is needed.; answer: 211\n[TOO_HARD]\nAdditional computed examples and a detailed analysis of the s range (including verification of the restrictions on a and c) are requested to fully confirm that base 211 indeed yields more than ten b-beautiful numbers.\nDebate agent gcco, round 1, identifying base with more than 10 b-beautiful numbers, thinking: Based on the analysis, we require that the number of valid residue classes modulo (b-1) is more than 10, which leads to the condition 2^r > 10, so r must be at least 4. The smallest integer with four distinct prime factors is 210, so setting b-1 = 210 gives b = 211. However, the full validity of the digit and range restrictions (particularly ensuring that n has exactly two digits in base b and that the digits satisfy the necessary conditions) requires further computed examples and deeper decomposition of the divisibility condition. Thus, while 211 is our best answer, further analysis or data is needed to confirm it completely.; answer: 211\n[TOO_HARD] Additional computed examples and detailed analysis of the constraints on s, a, and c (especially the divisibility condition (b-1)|(s(s-1))) are requested to fully confirm that b=211 is indeed the least base with more than 10 b-beautiful numbers.\nDebate agent PmXG, round 2, identifying base with more than 10 b-beautiful numbers, thinking: Based on the analysis and the chain-of-thought provided, 211 is identified as the candidate base where more than ten b-beautiful numbers exist. However, the constraints on s, a, and c, particularly the condition (b-1)|(s(s-1)), require further computed examples and detailed decomposition for full verification. The additional note [TOO_HARD] reflects these remaining complexities.; answer: 211\n[TOO_HARD] Please provide additional computed examples and a detailed analysis of the restrictions on s, a, and c (especially the divisibility condition) to rigorously justify that b = 211 is minimal.\nDebate agent gcco, round 2, identifying base with more than 10 b-beautiful numbers, thinking: Based on the analysis above, b = 211 appears to be the least base with more than 10 b-beautiful integers since b - 1 = 210 is the smallest integer having four distinct prime factors, which yields a sufficient number of valid residue classes (at least 2^4 > 10). However, additional computed examples and a more detailed verification of the divisor condition (b-1)|(s(s-1)) and the ranges for s, a, and c are needed to fully confirm that all conditions are met. Therefore, further analysis is recommended.; answer: 211\n[TOO_HARD] Additional computed examples and a detailed verification of the conditions on s, a, and c (especially ensuring (b-1)|(s(s-1))) are requested to completely confirm that b=211 is the least base with more than ten b-beautiful numbers.\nFinal Decision agent, determining least base, thinking: Both debate agents suggest that b = 211 is the least base with more than 10 b-beautiful integers, supported by the factorization of b - 1 = 210, which has four distinct prime factors yielding enough residue classes. However, full rigor requires additional computed examples and a detailed verification of the conditions on s, a, and c, in particular checking the divisibility condition (b-1)|(s(s-1)). Thus, while 211 is the best candidate based on the analysis, further verification is needed.; answer: 211\n[TOO_HARD] Please provide additional computed examples and a detailed breakdown of the restrictions on s, a, and c, especially verifying the condition (b-1)|(s(s-1)), to rigorously confirm that 211 is indeed minimal.', iteration_idx=-1)]
