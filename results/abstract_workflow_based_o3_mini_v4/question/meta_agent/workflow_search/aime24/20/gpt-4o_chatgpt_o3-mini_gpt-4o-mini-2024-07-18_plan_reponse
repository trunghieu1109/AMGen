        "response": "The analysis lacks a rigorous check of all boundary and internal cases of two\u2010digit numbers in base b, specifically the smallest (n = b) and largest (n = b^2 - 1) numbers. Without enumerating and verifying each digit pair (a, c) such that (a+c)^2 equals the number, the existence of over ten b-beautiful numbers in any base remains unvalidated. Consequently, a complete validation requires a more detailed step-by-step examination of all candidate pairs and edge cases. Therefore, the best answer is [TOO_HARD] with a request for further information.\n\nAnswer:[TOO_HARD]\nPlease provide a detailed step-by-step breakdown that includes: (1) listing all valid two-digit numbers for the candidate base, (2) a complete enumeration of digit pairs (a, c) along with verification that (a+c)^2 equals the number (n expressed in base b), and (3) explicit checks for the boundary cases (n = b and n = b^2 - 1). Without this comprehensive computational analysis, we cannot conclusively confirm that the count of b-beautiful numbers exceeds ten.",

        "response": "Both debate agents suggest that b = 211 is the least base with more than 10 b-beautiful integers, supported by the factorization of b - 1 = 210, which has four distinct prime factors yielding enough residue classes. However, full rigor requires additional computed examples and a detailed verification of the conditions on s, a, and c, in particular checking the divisibility condition (b-1)|(s(s-1)). Thus, while 211 is the best candidate based on the analysis, further verification is needed.\n\nAnswer:211\n[TOO_HARD] Please provide additional computed examples and a detailed breakdown of the restrictions on s, a, and c, especially verifying the condition (b-1)|(s(s-1)), to rigorously confirm that 211 is indeed minimal.",
