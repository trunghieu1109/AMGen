    <pre>Related original question:

Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textiteautiful\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textiteautiful\) because \(81  = \underline6 \ \underline3_13 \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt81\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textiteautiful\) integers.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 5: Identify the base b &gt;= 2 where more than 10 numbers are b-beautiful from Sub-task 4. 

 ### thinking by Debate Agent PmXG:
Based on the analysis and the chain-of-thought provided, 211 is identified as the candidate base where more than ten b-beautiful numbers exist. However, the constraints on s, a, and c, particularly the condition (b-1)|(s(s-1)), require further computed examples and detailed decomposition for full verification. The additional note [TOO_HARD] reflects these remaining complexities.

### thinking by Debate Agent gcco:
Based on the analysis above, b = 211 appears to be the least base with more than 10 b-beautiful integers since b - 1 = 210 is the smallest integer having four distinct prime factors, which yields a sufficient number of valid residue classes (at least 2^4 &gt; 10). However, additional computed examples and a more detailed verification of the divisor condition (b-1)|(s(s-1)) and the ranges for s, a, and c are needed to fully confirm that all conditions are met. Therefore, further analysis is recommended.

### answer by Debate Agent PmXG:
211
[TOO_HARD] Please provide additional computed examples and a detailed analysis of the restrictions on s, a, and c (especially the divisibility condition) to rigorously justify that b = 211 is minimal.

### answer by Debate Agent gcco:
211
[TOO_HARD] Additional computed examples and a detailed verification of the conditions on s, a, and c (especially ensuring (b-1)|(s(s-1))) are requested to completely confirm that b=211 is the least base with more than ten b-beautiful numbers.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 5: Make final decision on least base where count &gt; 10.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>Both debate agents suggest that b = 211 is the least base with more than 10 b-beautiful integers, supported by the factorization of b - 1 = 210, which has four distinct prime factors yielding enough residue classes. However, full rigor requires additional computed examples and a detailed verification of the conditions on s, a, and c, in particular checking the divisibility condition (b-1)|(s(s-1)). Thus, while 211 is the best candidate based on the analysis, further verification is needed.

Answer:211
[TOO_HARD] Please provide additional computed examples and a detailed breakdown of the restrictions on s, a, and c, especially verifying the condition (b-1)|(s(s-1)), to rigorously confirm that 211 is indeed minimal.</pre>
