Question: Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.
Iteration: abstract_workflow_2_8
proposed answer: The analysis confirms that Bob wins when n mod 5 is 0 or 2. There are 404 numbers (multiples of 5) and 405 numbers (of the form 5k+2) up to 2024, yielding a total of 809 winning positions for Bob.

Iteration: abstract_workflow_5_8
proposed answer: The analysis shows that Bob wins when the starting token count n is a losing position for Alice. This occurs when n ≡ 0 or 2 (mod 5). For n up to 2024, there are 404 numbers with n ≡ 0 (mod 5) and 405 numbers with n ≡ 2 (mod 5), giving a total of 404 + 405 = 809 winning values for Bob.
