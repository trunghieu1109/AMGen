These details are crucial for determining which configurations satisfy the sum, unique mode, and median conditions. Without further clarification, it is not possible to definitively aggregate and filter valid configurations. Therefore, I must mark the answer with [TOO_HARD] and request additional details on the total number of list elements as well as the intended definition of the median.\n\nAnswer:[TOO_HARD]\nPlease specify the total number of list elements and how the median should be determined (especially for even-length lists).",
