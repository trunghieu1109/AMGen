        "response": "The final computed product, as detailed in previous steps, results in 8321 which, when reduced modulo 1000, gives 321. However, because the derivation involves intricate algebraic manipulations including rewriting the factors in the form (\u03c9^k - (1+i))(\u03c9^k - (1-i)), applying the factorization of x^13 - 1 via substitutions with x = 1+i and x = 1-i, converting these complex numbers to polar form and using De Moivre\u2019s theorem to compute the 13th powers, followed by careful multiplication and modular reduction, the derivation is quite involved. Therefore, a more detailed step-by-step breakdown is requested to fully justify each of these steps.\n\nAnswer:321\n[TOO_HARD] Please provide a detailed step-by-step derivation starting with rewriting each term as (\u03c9^k - (1+i))*(\u03c9^k - (1-i)), then demonstrate the factorization of x^13 - 1 to allow substitutions with x = 1+i and x = 1-i, include the conversion of 1+i and 1-i into polar form, apply De Moivre\u2019s theorem for computing their 13th powers, and finally show the complete multiplication and reduction modulo 1000. This additional detail is requested because the underlying algebra and modular arithmetic involve nontrivial manipulations that warrant a thorough breakdown.",
