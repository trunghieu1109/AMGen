The earlier work expressed the inradius in terms of tan(B/2) as r = 2024 tan(B/2), but without additional geometric data (for example, a specific measure for angle B or further tangency conditions relating the circles to triangle ABC), one cannot uniquely resolve m and n. Therefore, a unique numerical sum m+n cannot be computed from the given information.\n\nAnswer:[TOO_HARD]\nAdditional details (such as the measure of angle B or other specific tangency constraints) are required to uniquely determine m and n and thus compute m+n.",
