    <pre>Related original question:

Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfracmn$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$..

### Sub-task 6: Calculate the conditional probability of winning the grand prize given that she has won a prize. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent Lqv2:
To get the conditional probability that Jen wins the grand prize given that she wins a prize, we use the ratio P(grand prize) / P(prize). We are given that there is 1 way to win the grand prize out of C(10,4)=210 outcomes, so P(grand prize) = 1/210. Also, by counting the cases where she wins a prize (matching exactly 2, 3, or 4 numbers) we have 115 winning outcomes, so P(prize) = 115/210. Dividing these gives (1/210) / (115/210) = 1/115. Written in lowest terms, this is 1/115 where m = 1 and n = 115 are relatively prime. Since the original question asks for m + n, the final answer is 1 + 115 = 116.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent Lqv2:
116

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 7: Determine the ratio in its simplest form and find the sum of the numerator and denominator.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
