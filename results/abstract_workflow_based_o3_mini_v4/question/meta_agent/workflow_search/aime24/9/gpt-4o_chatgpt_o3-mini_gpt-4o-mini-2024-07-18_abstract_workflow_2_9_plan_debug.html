    <pre>Related original question:

Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfracmn$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$..

### Sub-task 6: Make final decision on conditional probability. 

 ### thinking by Final Decision Agent XoSA:
The calculation for conditional probability is P(grand prize | prize) = (1/210) / (23/42) which simplifies to (1/210)*(42/23) = 42/(210*23). This reduces as 42/210 = 1/5, so the overall value is 1/(5*23) = 1/115. Since m=1 and n=115 are relatively prime, their sum is 1+115 = 116.

### answer by Final Decision Agent XoSA:
116

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 7: Express the conditional probability as a fraction in simplest form and compute m+n using the results from subtask 6.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>From the final decision provided in sub-task 6, the conditional probability is 1/115 in simplest form. This means m = 1 and n = 115, and therefore m+n = 116.
