    <pre>Related original question:

Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.
[asy] size(10cm); usepackage(&#34;tikz&#34;);label(&#34;egintikzpicture[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(2,0)--(2,3)--(5,3)--(5,8)--(8,8);\endtikzpicture&#34;,origin); label(&#34;\begintikzpicture[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(0,3)--(3,3)--(3,5)--(8,5)--(8,8);\endtikzpicture&#34;,E); [/asy].

### Sub-task 6: Synthesize and finalize the number of valid paths with four direction changes. 

 ### thinking #3 by Debate Agent RL2K:
By distributing the 8 horizontal moves into 3 segments (in C(7,2) = 21 ways) and the 8 vertical moves into 2 segments (in C(7,1) = 7 ways), we get 147 paths for a path that starts horizontally. An identical reasoning applies for paths starting vertically, adding another 147 paths to the total. Therefore, the combined total is 147 + 147 = 294.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent Zb8X:
By partitioning the 16 moves into 5 segments (with exactly 4 changes of direction), we can divide the 8 horizontal moves into 3 segments in C(7,2) = 21 ways, and the 8 vertical moves into 2 segments in C(7,1) = 7 ways, yielding 21 * 7 = 147 paths for those starting horizontally. The same applies for paths starting vertically, so we add another 147, resulting in a total of 294 valid paths.

### answer #3 by Debate Agent RL2K:
294

### answer #3 by Debate Agent Zb8X:
294

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Finalize the number of valid paths with four direction changes.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>The solution follows by partitioning the moves into segments with each segment being a consecutive group of moves. For a path with exactly 4 direction changes, there are 5 segments. If the path starts horizontally, the 8 horizontal moves are divided in 3 segments and can be partitioned in C(7,2)=21 ways while the 8 vertical moves are divided in 2 segments and can be partitioned in C(7,1)=7 ways, yielding 21*7=147 paths. A similar reasoning applies if the path starts vertically, adding another 147 paths. Thus the total number of valid paths is 147+147=294.
