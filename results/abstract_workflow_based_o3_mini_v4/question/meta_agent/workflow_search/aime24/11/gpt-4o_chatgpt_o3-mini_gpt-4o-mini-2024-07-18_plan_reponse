        "response": "The solution follows by partitioning the moves into segments with each segment being a consecutive group of moves. For a path with exactly 4 direction changes, there are 5 segments. If the path starts horizontally, the 8 horizontal moves are divided in 3 segments and can be partitioned in C(7,2)=21 ways while the 8 vertical moves are divided in 2 segments and can be partitioned in C(7,1)=7 ways, yielding 21*7=147 paths. A similar reasoning applies if the path starts vertically, adding another 147 paths. Thus the total number of valid paths is 147+147=294.\n\nAnswer:294",
