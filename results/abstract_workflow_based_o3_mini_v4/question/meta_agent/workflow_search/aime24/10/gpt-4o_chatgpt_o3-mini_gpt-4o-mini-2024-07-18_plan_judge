Question: Rectangles $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are drawn such that $D,E,C,F$ are collinear. Also, $A,D,H,G$ all lie on a circle. If $BC=16$,$AB=107$,$FG=17$, and $EF=184$, what is the length of $CE$?
Iteration: abstract_workflow_1_10
proposed answer: Based on the available sub-task analyses and despite the ambiguity about the precise collinear ordering of D, E, C, and F and how the circle condition (with A, D, H, G) further constrains the configuration, the best computed answer from the given information is 104. However, further clarification is needed to ensure that this configuration is correctly interpreted.

Answer:104
[TOO_HARD] Please clarify the exact relative positioning of D, E, C, and F and how the circle condition (with A, D, H, G) determines this alignment.

Iteration: abstract_workflow_2_10
proposed answer: The established equations yield CE = 107 - (16×184)/17. Evaluating (16×184)/17 gives 2944/17 ≈ 173.176, which makes CE ≈ 107 - 173.176 = -66.176, a negative length. This inconsistency indicates ambiguity in the segmentation of points along the line, suggesting that additional information (for example a diagram or details on the order of points D, E, C, F) is needed to resolve the configuration. Therefore, while the algebraic expression remains CE = 107 - (16×184)/17, the negative result shows that the assumed configuration does not support this outcome.

Answer:CE = 107 - (16×184)/17
[TOO_HARD] Please provide a clear diagram or explicit description of the ordering of points D, E, C, and F to resolve the ambiguity, as the computed value of DE exceeds 107 making CE negative.
Extracted answer: CE = 107 - (16×184)/17
