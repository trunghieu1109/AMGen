        "response": "The established equations yield CE = 107 - (16\u00d7184)/17. Evaluating (16\u00d7184)/17 gives 2944/17 \u2248 173.176, which makes CE \u2248 107 - 173.176 = -66.176, a negative length. This inconsistency indicates ambiguity in the segmentation of points along the line, suggesting that additional information (for example a diagram or details on the order of points D, E, C, F) is needed to resolve the configuration. Therefore, while the algebraic expression remains CE = 107 - (16\u00d7184)/17, the negative result shows that the assumed configuration does not support this outcome.\n\nAnswer:CE = 107 - (16\u00d7184)/17\n[TOO_HARD] Please provide a clear diagram or explicit description of the ordering of points D, E, C, and F to resolve the ambiguity, as the computed value of DE exceeds 107 making CE negative.",
