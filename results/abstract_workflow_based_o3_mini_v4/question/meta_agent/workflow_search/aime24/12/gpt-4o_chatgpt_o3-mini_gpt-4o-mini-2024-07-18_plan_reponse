        "response": "After thorough analysis, the real part of the expression is maximized when the variable z is chosen such that its corresponding (x, y) aligns with the gradient of the linear part (75, -261). The maximal contribution from this alignment within the constraint x^2 + y^2 = 16 (which corresponds to a circle of radius 4) is given by 4 times the magnitude of the vector (75, -261). Thus, adding the constant 3/2, we have the maximum real part 3/2 + 4\u221a(75\u00b2+261\u00b2) = 3/2 + 4\u221a73746. Both debate agents provided the same result, confirming its correctness.\n\nAnswer:3/2+4sqrt(73746)",

        "response": "Substituting z = 4(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8) into the expression, the real part becomes 4(75cos\u03b8 - 261 sin\u03b8) + 3/2. The maximum of 75cos\u03b8 - 261 sin\u03b8 is \u221a(75\u00b2 + 261\u00b2) = \u221a73746, which simplifies to 3\u221a8194 because 73746 = 9\u00d78194. Multiplying by 4 gives 12\u221a8194, and adding 3/2 yields 12\u221a8194 + 3/2.\n\nAnswer:12\u221a8194 + 3/2",
