### Sub-task 4: Count the solutions satisfying both conditions and verify their consistency. 

 ### thinking #3 by Debate Agent zHV1:
Using the algebraic reduction, we observe that the symmetric equation under a + b + c = 300 forces (a-100)(b-100)(c-100) = 0, meaning that at least one of the three variables must equal 100. If we fix a = 100 then b + c = 200, which has 201 nonnegative solutions; similarly for b = 100 and c = 100. Accounting for overcounting (solutions with two or three variables equal to 100) via inclusion–exclusion, we find a total of 3 × 201 - 3 + 1 = 601 solutions. This consistency can be verified computationally by iterating over all possible triples (a, b, c) with a + b + c = 300 and checking if (a-100)*(b-100)*(c-100) = 0, which confirms the algebraic result.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent qg9T:
We use the result that with a + b + c = 300, the symmetric equation reduces to (a-100)(b-100)(c-100) = 0, meaning at least one of a, b, or c must equal 100. Setting, for example, a = 100 leads to b + c = 200, which has 201 nonnegative solutions. Similarly for b = 100 and c = 100. However, the cases where two or all three are 100 are overcounted. By inclusion‐exclusion, the total unique solutions count is 3×201 - 3 + 1 = 601. This count can also be verified by a computational approach that iterates all valid combinations and checks the conditions. Therefore, the consistency between the algebraic reduction and computer enumeration confirms the answer.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Make final decision on the count of valid solutions.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>We reduce the original symmetric equation, under the constraint a+b+c=300, to (a-100)(b-100)(c-100)=0, which forces at least one variable to be 100. Fixing a variable to 100 yields 201 solutions (because the other two must sum to 200). Using inclusion–exclusion to eliminate overcounted cases (where more than one variable equals 100) gives the total count as 3×201 − 3 + 1 = 601.
