Question: Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: To finalize and verify the sum m+n, we start from the conditional probability of winning the grand prize given that Jen won a prize. From previous calculations, the probability of winning the grand prize is 1/C(10,4) = 1/210, since there is exactly one way for the drawn numbers to match Jen's chosen 4 numbers out of the total 210 possible 4-number combinations. The probability of winning any prize (at least 2 matches) was found to be 23/42. Therefore, the conditional probability is (1/210) / (23/42) = (1/210) * (42/23) = 42/(210*23) = (42/210)*(1/23) = (1/5)*(1/23) = 1/115. This fraction is already in simplest form because 1 and 115 share no common factors other than 1. Hence, m=1 and n=115, and their sum m+n = 1 + 115 = 116. This confirms the final answer is correct and consistent with the problem's requirements.
