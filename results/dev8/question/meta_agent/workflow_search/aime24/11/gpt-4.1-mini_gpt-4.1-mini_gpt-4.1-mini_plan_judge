Question: Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.

proposed answer: We are asked to find the number of lattice paths from (0,0) to (8,8) consisting of 16 steps (8 right and 8 up) that change direction exactly four times. A direction change means switching from right (R) to up (U) or vice versa. Exactly four direction changes imply the path is divided into five monotone segments alternating between R and U steps. The path can start either with R or with U, leading to two cases:

Case 1: Path starts with R
- The segments alternate as R-U-R-U-R.
- There are 3 R segments and 2 U segments.
- Each segment must have at least one step.
- The total R steps sum to 8, and total U steps sum to 8.
- Number of ways to partition 8 R steps into 3 positive parts is C(7,2) = 21.
- Number of ways to partition 8 U steps into 2 positive parts is C(7,1) = 7.
- Total segment length patterns in this case: 21 * 7 = 147.

Case 2: Path starts with U
- The segments alternate as U-R-U-R-U.
- There are 3 U segments and 2 R segments.
- Number of ways to partition 8 U steps into 3 positive parts is C(7,2) = 21.
- Number of ways to partition 8 R steps into 2 positive parts is C(7,1) = 7.
- Total segment length patterns in this case: 21 * 7 = 147.

Each segment length pattern corresponds to exactly one path because the order of steps is fixed once the segment lengths are fixed (all R steps are contiguous in their segments, and all U steps are contiguous in theirs). Therefore, the number of paths equals the number of segment length patterns.

Summing over both starting directions, the total number of paths with exactly four direction changes is 147 + 147 = 294.

This matches the consistent results from multiple independent analyses and is a reasonable count given the total number of monotone paths (C(16,8) = 12870). Hence, the final answer is 294.
