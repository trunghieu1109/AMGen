Question: Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.

proposed answer: We have previously calculated s = 2.5 km/h and t = 24 minutes. The total times given were 4 hours at speed s and 2.4 hours at speed s+2 = 4.5 km/h. The total time at speed s+0.5 = 3.0 km/h was calculated as 204 minutes (3.4 hours). To verify, we check if this value is reasonable: 4 hours (240 minutes) at 2.5 km/h, 204 minutes at 3.0 km/h, and 2.4 hours (144 minutes) at 4.5 km/h. The total time decreases as speed increases, which is consistent with expectations. The walking time at 3.0 km/h is 9/3 = 3 hours (180 minutes), plus coffee time 24 minutes, total 204 minutes. This matches the previous calculation. No components are overlooked, and the answer is consistent with the problem constraints and previous results.
