proposed answer: Starting from the given equations: log_x(y^x) = 10 and log_y(x^{4y}) = 10, we rewrite them using the definition of logarithms: y^x = x^{10} and x^{4y} = y^{10}. Taking natural logarithms, let a = ln(x) > 0 and b = ln(y) > 0. Then the equations become: x b = 10 a and 4 y a = 10 b, or equivalently e^a b = 10 a and 4 e^b a = 10 b. From the first, b = (10 a) / e^a. Substitute into the second: 4 e^b a = 10 b = 100 a / e^a. Dividing both sides by a, 4 e^b = 100 / e^a. Multiply both sides by e^a: 4 e^{a+b} = 100. Since x y = e^{a+b}, we have 4 x y = 100, so x y = 25. To verify, substitute back: y^x = e^{b x} = e^{b e^a} and x^{10} = e^{10 a}. Using b = (10 a)/e^a, b e^a = 10 a, so y^x = e^{10 a} = x^{10}, consistent. Similarly, x^{4 y} = e^{4 y a} = e^{4 e^b a} and y^{10} = e^{10 b}. Using the relation from the second equation, these are equal. Thus, the product xy = 25 satisfies both original equations and domain constraints (x, y > 1).
