Question: Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.

proposed answer: We want to find the number of positive integers n ≤ 2024 for which Bob has a guaranteed winning strategy. Since Alice moves first, Bob can guarantee a win if the initial position is losing for Alice. A losing position is one where the player to move cannot force a win. The moves allowed are removing 1 or 4 tokens. We define L(n) as True if the position with n tokens is losing for the player to move, False otherwise. Base case: L(0) = True (no tokens left, player to move loses). For n ≥ 1, L(n) = True if all moves lead to winning positions, i.e., if both L(n-1) and L(n-4) are False (if n-4 ≥ 0), else only consider L(n-1). Calculating the first few values: L(0)=True, L(1)=False (since L(0)=True), L(2)=True (since L(1)=False and L(-2) invalid), L(3)=False, L(4)=False, L(5)=True, and so on. This pattern repeats every 5 tokens. The losing positions occur when n mod 5 = 0 or n mod 5 = 2. To count such n ≤ 2024: numbers divisible by 5 are floor(2024/5) = 404, numbers congruent to 2 mod 5 are also 404. Total losing positions = 404 + 404 = 808. Therefore, for these 808 values of n, Bob can guarantee a win regardless of Alice's moves. This matches the theoretical pattern and is consistent with the game analysis.

proposed answer: To determine the losing positions for the first player (Alice) in the game where players can remove either 1 or 4 tokens, we analyze the game states from the base cases upward. A losing position is one where the current player has no winning move, meaning all moves lead to winning positions for the opponent. We start with small values of n:
- n=1: Alice can remove 1 token and win immediately, so n=1 is winning.
- n=2: Alice can remove 1 token leaving n=1 (winning for next player), so n=2 is winning.
- n=3: Alice can remove 1 token leaving n=2 (winning for next player), so n=3 is winning.
- n=4: Alice can remove 4 tokens and win immediately, so n=4 is winning.

But this contradicts the initial assumption that multiples of 4 are losing. Let's analyze carefully:

We define losing positions (L) and winning positions (W) as follows:
- A position is losing if all moves lead to winning positions.
- A position is winning if there exists at least one move to a losing position.

Check from n=0 (no tokens):
- n=0: no tokens to remove, so the player to move loses. So n=0 is losing.

Now, for n=1:
- Moves: remove 1 token -> n=0 (losing)
- Since there is a move to losing position, n=1 is winning.

n=2:
- Moves: remove 1 token -> n=1 (winning)
- remove 4 tokens not possible
- All moves lead to winning positions, so n=2 is losing.

n=3:
- Moves: remove 1 token -> n=2 (losing)
- remove 4 tokens not possible
- There is a move to losing position, so n=3 is winning.

n=4:
- Moves: remove 1 token -> n=3 (winning)
- remove 4 tokens -> n=0 (losing)
- There is a move to losing position, so n=4 is winning.

n=5:
- Moves: remove 1 token -> n=4 (winning)
- remove 4 tokens -> n=1 (winning)
- All moves lead to winning positions, so n=5 is losing.

n=6:
- Moves: remove 1 token -> n=5 (losing)
- remove 4 tokens -> n=2 (losing)
- There is a move to losing position, so n=6 is winning.

n=7:
- Moves: remove 1 token -> n=6 (winning)
- remove 4 tokens -> n=3 (winning)
- All moves lead to winning positions, so n=7 is losing.

n=8:
- Moves: remove 1 token -> n=7 (losing)
- remove 4 tokens -> n=4 (winning)
- There is a move to losing position, so n=8 is winning.

From this pattern, losing positions are n=0,2,5,7,...

The losing positions appear to be those where n mod 7 is 0, 2, or 5.

Check the pattern for n mod 7:
- n mod 7 = 0: n=0 losing
- n mod 7 = 1: n=1 winning
- n mod 7 = 2: n=2 losing
- n mod 7 = 3: n=3 winning
- n mod 7 = 4: n=4 winning
- n mod 7 = 5: n=5 losing
- n mod 7 = 6: n=6 winning

So losing positions are those where n mod 7 ∈ {0,2,5}.

Since Alice moves first, Bob can guarantee a win if the initial n is a losing position for Alice, i.e., n mod 7 ∈ {0,2,5}.

Now, count how many n ≤ 2024 satisfy n mod 7 ∈ {0,2,5}.

Number of integers ≤ 2024 divisible by 7 (n mod 7=0): floor(2024/7) = 289
Number of integers ≤ 2024 with n mod 7=2: numbers of form 7k+2 ≤ 2024
Max k: (2024-2)/7 = 2022/7 = 288.85 → 288
So count = 289 (k=0 to 288)
Similarly for n mod 7=5: numbers of form 7k+5 ≤ 2024
Max k: (2024-5)/7 = 2019/7 = 288.42 → 288
Count = 289

Total losing positions = 289 + 289 + 289 = 867

Therefore, the number of positive integers n ≤ 2024 for which Bob can guarantee a win is 867.
