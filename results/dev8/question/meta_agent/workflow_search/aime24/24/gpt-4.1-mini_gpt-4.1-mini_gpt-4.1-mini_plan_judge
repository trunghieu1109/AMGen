Question: Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations:
\[\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}\]\[\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}\]\[\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}\]
Then the value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: We are given the system of logarithmic equations:

log2(x/(yz)) = 1/2
log2(y/(xz)) = 1/3
log2(z/(xy)) = 1/4

Define a = log2(x), b = log2(y), c = log2(z). Using logarithm properties:

1) a - b - c = 1/2
2) b - a - c = 1/3
3) c - a - b = 1/4

Add all three equations:
(a - b - c) + (b - a - c) + (c - a - b) = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4
Simplify left side:
a - b - c + b - a - c + c - a - b = -a - b - c
Sum right side:
1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 = 6/12 + 4/12 + 3/12 = 13/12

So:
-a - b - c = 13/12 => a + b + c = -13/12

From equation (1):
a - b - c = 1/2
Add to sum equation:
(a - b - c) + (a + b + c) = 1/2 - 13/12
2a = 1/2 - 13/12 = 6/12 - 13/12 = -7/12
=> a = -7/24

Use sum to find b + c:
b + c = -13/12 - a = -13/12 + 7/24 = -26/24 + 7/24 = -19/24

From equation (2):
b - a - c = 1/3 => b - c = 1/3 + a = 1/3 - 7/24 = 8/24 - 7/24 = 1/24

Solve for b and c:
b + c = -19/24
b - c = 1/24
Add:
2b = -19/24 + 1/24 = -18/24 = -3/4
=> b = -3/8

Then:
c = -19/24 - b = -19/24 + 3/8 = -19/24 + 9/24 = -10/24 = -5/12

Check equation (3):
c - a - b = -5/12 - (-7/24) - (-3/8) = -5/12 + 7/24 + 3/8
Convert to 24ths:
-10/24 + 7/24 + 9/24 = 6/24 = 1/4
Correct.

Now, find log2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = 4a + 3b + 2c
Substitute values:
4*(-7/24) + 3*(-3/8) + 2*(-5/12) = -28/24 - 9/8 - 10/12
Convert all to 24ths:
-28/24 - 27/24 - 20/24 = -75/24

Absolute value:
| -75/24 | = 75/24
Simplify fraction:
75/24 = 25/8

Thus, m = 25, n = 8, and m + n = 33.

Therefore, the final answer is 33.
