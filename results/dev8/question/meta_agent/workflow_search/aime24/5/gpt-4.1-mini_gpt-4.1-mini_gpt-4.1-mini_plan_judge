Question: Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.

proposed answer: From the previous sub-task, the inradius r of the tetrahedron was found to be r = (12√7)/41. To verify this expression meets the problem's requirements, we check the following: 1) m=12, n=7, p=41 are positive integers. 2) n=7 is square-free since 7 is a prime number and contains no square factors. 3) m=12 and p=41 are coprime because 41 is prime and does not divide 12, so gcd(12,41) = 1. Therefore, the expression r = (12√7)/41 is in the simplified form required by the problem. Finally, we compute m + n + p = 12 + 7 + 41 = 60. Hence, the sum m+n+p equals 60, which is the final answer.
