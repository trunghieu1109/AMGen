Question: Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_14_15
proposed answer: We are given a total of 900 residents, each owning candy hearts, and three other items: diamond ring (195 owners), golf clubs (367 owners), and garden spade (562 owners). We know that 437 residents own exactly two items, and 234 residents own exactly three items. We want to find how many residents own all four items (candy hearts plus the other three).

Step 1: Define variables for the number of residents owning exactly k items:
- a = number owning exactly 1 item (only candy hearts, since everyone owns candy hearts)
- b = number owning exactly 2 items
- c = number owning exactly 3 items
- d = number owning exactly 4 items

From the problem:
b = 437
c = 234

total residents = a + b + c + d = 900

Step 2: Calculate the total number of owners of the three items (excluding candy hearts):
195 (diamond ring) + 367 (golf clubs) + 562 (garden spade) = 1124

Step 3: Express total ownership of the three items in terms of b, c, d:
- Those owning exactly 2 items have candy hearts plus exactly one of the other three items, so they own 1 of the 3 items.
- Those owning exactly 3 items have candy hearts plus exactly two of the other three items, so they own 2 of the 3 items.
- Those owning exactly 4 items have candy hearts plus all three items, so they own 3 of the 3 items.

Therefore, total ownership of the three items = 1*b + 2*c + 3*d = 437 + 468 + 3d = 905 + 3d

Step 4: Set this equal to total ownerships:
905 + 3d = 1124
3d = 219

d = 73

Step 5: Find a:
a + b + c + d = 900
=> a + 437 + 234 + 73 = 900
=> a + 744 = 900
=> a = 156

Step 6: Verify sum:
156 + 437 + 234 + 73 = 900 (correct)

Thus, the number of residents owning all four items is 73. This is consistent with all given data and the inclusion-exclusion principle applied to the problem.

Answer:73
