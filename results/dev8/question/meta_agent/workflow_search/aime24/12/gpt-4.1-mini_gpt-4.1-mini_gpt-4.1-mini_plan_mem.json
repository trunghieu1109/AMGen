        "The largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z for |z|=4 is 540. This maximum is verified consistently by expressing z in polar form, reducing the problem to maximizing a trigonometric expression, calculating the magnitudes of the complex coefficients, and confirming via geometric interpretation and direct substitution that no larger real part is possible under the given constraint.": "95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval: (0.0%, 0.0%), Median: 0.0%"
