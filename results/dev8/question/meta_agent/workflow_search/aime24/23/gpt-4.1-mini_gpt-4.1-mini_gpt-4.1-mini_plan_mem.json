        "The total number of valid digit assignments in the 2x3 grid satisfying the given sum conditions is 45. Leading zeros are allowed, digit repetition is permitted, and all digits are between 0 and 9. The problem reduces to counting the number of nonnegative integer solutions to a+b+c=8, which is 45, with d,e,f uniquely determined by d=9-a, e=9-b, f=9-c. This count fully satisfies the problem constraints with no overlooked edge cases.": "95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval: (0.0%, 0.0%), Median: 0.0%"
