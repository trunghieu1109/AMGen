Question: Let $\omega\neq 1$ be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\]
is divided by 1000.

proposed answer: The original product is \( \prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) \), where \( \omega \) is a 13th root of unity. We rewrite the expression inside the product as \( f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2 \) evaluated at \( x = \omega^k \). Since \( \omega^k \) for \( k=0,1,...,12 \) are all the 13th roots of unity, the product is \( \prod_{k=0}^{12} f(\omega^k) \). This product can be expressed as the resultant of \( f(x) \) and the 13th cyclotomic polynomial \( \Phi_{13}(x) \), multiplied by \( f(1) \) because \( \omega^0 = 1 \) is included. The resultant calculation and algebraic manipulations yield the product value as 169. Since the problem asks for the remainder when this product is divided by 1000, and 169 < 1000, the remainder is simply 169. This conclusion is consistent with all previous detailed algebraic steps and modular arithmetic considerations.

is divided by 1000.

proposed answer: From the previous sub-tasks, the verified resultant value of the product is 8321. The current task is to find the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000. To find this remainder, we perform the modular arithmetic operation 8321 mod 1000. Dividing 8321 by 1000 gives a quotient of 8 and a remainder of 321, since 8321 - 8*1000 = 8321 - 8000 = 321. This calculation is straightforward and consistent with all previous steps and verifications. Therefore, the remainder when the product is divided by 1000 is 321.
