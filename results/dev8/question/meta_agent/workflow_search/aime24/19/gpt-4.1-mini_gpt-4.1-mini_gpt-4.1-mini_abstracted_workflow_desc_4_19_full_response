To verify, we numerically approximate Phi_13(1+i) using high-precision methods and confirm it is very close to -64 + 65i. Multiplying Phi_13(1+i) and Phi_13(1-i) numerically also yields approximately 8321, confirming the exact integer value.

We need to find the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000. Performing modular arithmetic: 8321 mod 1000 equals the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000. Dividing 8321 by 1000 gives 8 with a remainder of 321. Therefore, the remainder is 321. This step is straightforward and involves simple division and modulus operation. The result 321 is consistent with the previous calculations and is the final answer to the original problem.; answer: 321", iteration_idx=-1)]
