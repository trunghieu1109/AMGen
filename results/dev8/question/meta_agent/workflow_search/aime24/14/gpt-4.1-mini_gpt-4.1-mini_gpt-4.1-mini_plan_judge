Question: Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.

proposed answer: We start with the hyperbola equation \( \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \) and the condition that points A, B, C, D lie on it forming a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin. The diagonals bisect each other at the origin, so points A and C are symmetric about the origin, as are B and D. The diagonals are perpendicular, a property of rhombi. From the problem analysis, the squared length of diagonal BD is expressed as \( BD^2 = \frac{44}{5} x_2^2 - 96 \), where \( x_2^2 = Y \) satisfies the nonlinear constraint \( 11 x_1^2 x_2^2 = 720 (x_1^2 + x_2^2) - 14400 \) with \( x_1^2 = X \). Rearranging, \( X = \frac{720 Y - 14400}{11 Y - 720} \). Domain restrictions from the hyperbola require \( X, Y \geq 20 \). Analyzing the domain and constraint shows that the denominator \( 11 Y - 720 \) changes sign at \( Y = \frac{720}{11} \approx 65.4545 \). For \( Y > 65.4545 \), \( X \) is positive and satisfies the domain. The function \( BD^2(Y) = \frac{44}{5} Y - 96 \) is linear and increasing in \( Y \). As \( Y \to 65.4545^+ \), \( BD^2 \to 480 \) from below, but the constraint causes a vertical asymptote at this point, so \( BD^2 \) never reaches 480. For \( Y > 65.4545 \), \( BD^2 > 480 \) is not feasible due to the constraint and domain restrictions. Thus, the supremum (least upper bound) of \( BD^2 \) for all such rhombi is 480, but it is never attained exactly. This is confirmed by checking the rhombus conditions and the hyperbola constraints near this boundary. Therefore, the greatest real number less than \( BD^2 \) for all rhombi inscribed on the hyperbola with diagonals intersecting at the origin is 480.
