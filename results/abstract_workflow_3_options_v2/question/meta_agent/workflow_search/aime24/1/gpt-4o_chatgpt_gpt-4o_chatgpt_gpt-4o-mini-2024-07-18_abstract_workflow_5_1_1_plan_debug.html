    <pre>Related original question:

Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$..

### Sub-task 6: Express AP in the form m/n where m and n are relatively prime integers. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent AeHT:
In the problem, we have a triangle ABC inscribed in a circle, and tangents at B and C intersect at D. The line AD intersects the circle again at P. We are given that AB = 5, BC = 9, and AC = 10. The key to solving this problem is recognizing that D is the intersection of the tangents, making it the pole of line BC with respect to the circle. This means that the cross-ratio (B, C; D, P) is -1, indicating a harmonic division. Using the power of a point theorem, we have that the power of D with respect to the circle is DB^2 = DA * DP. Since DB = DC (tangents from D), and using the fact that AD * DP = AB * AC, we can find AP. The relationship AD * DP = AB * AC simplifies to AP = (AB * AC) / AD. Solving this gives AP = 25/4, where 25 and 4 are relatively prime. Therefore, AP is expressed as 25/4.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent AeHT:
25/4

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 7: Calculate m + n to find the final answer. 

 then justify completely and detailedly why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. Again, your task is only to answer the question Sub-task 7: Calculate m + n to find the final answer. and explaination.</pre>

    <pre>In Sub-task 6, we found that AP can be expressed as the fraction 25/4, where 25 and 4 are relatively prime integers. In this fraction, m = 25 and n = 4. To find the final answer for Sub-task 7, we need to calculate m + n, which is 25 + 4. Therefore, m + n = 29.
