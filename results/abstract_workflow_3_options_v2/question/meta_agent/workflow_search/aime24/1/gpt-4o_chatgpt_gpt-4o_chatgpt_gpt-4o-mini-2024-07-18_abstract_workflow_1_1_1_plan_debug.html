    <pre>Related original question:

Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 6: Express AP in the form m/n where m and n are relatively prime integers. 

 ### thinking #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent JCgX:
From the previous sub-tasks, we determined that the length of AP is \( \frac{50}{9} \). To express AP in the form \( \frac{m}{n} \) where m and n are relatively prime integers, we need to ensure that the fraction is in its simplest form. The numbers 50 and 9 have no common factors other than 1, so \( \frac{50}{9} \) is already in its simplest form. Therefore, m = 50 and n = 9, and they are relatively prime. Thus, m + n = 50 + 9 = 59. This conclusion is based on the correct application of the Power of a Point theorem and the properties of tangents and secants in a circle, which were used to derive the expression for AP.

### answer #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent JCgX:
59

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 7: Calculate m + n to provide the final answer. 

 then justify completely and detailedly why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. Again, your task is only to answer the question Sub-task 7: Calculate m + n to provide the final answer. and explaination.</pre>

    <pre>In Sub-task 6, we found that the length of AP is expressed as \( \frac{50}{9} \), where 50 and 9 are relatively prime integers. This means that the fraction is already in its simplest form, with m = 50 and n = 9. To find m + n, we simply add these two numbers together: 50 + 9 = 59. Therefore, the final answer for m + n is 59.
