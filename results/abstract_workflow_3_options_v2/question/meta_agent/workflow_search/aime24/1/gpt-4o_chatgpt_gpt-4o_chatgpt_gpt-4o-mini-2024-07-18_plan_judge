Question: Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.
Iteration: abstract_workflow_1_1_1
proposed answer: In Sub-task 6, we found that the length of AP is expressed as \( \frac{50}{9} \), where 50 and 9 are relatively prime integers. This means that the fraction is already in its simplest form, with m = 50 and n = 9. To find m + n, we simply add these two numbers together: 50 + 9 = 59. Therefore, the final answer for m + n is 59.

proposed answer: In Sub-task 6, we found that AP can be expressed as the fraction 25/4, where 25 and 4 are relatively prime integers. In this fraction, m = 25 and n = 4. To find the final answer for Sub-task 7, we need to calculate m + n, which is 25 + 4. Therefore, m + n = 29.
