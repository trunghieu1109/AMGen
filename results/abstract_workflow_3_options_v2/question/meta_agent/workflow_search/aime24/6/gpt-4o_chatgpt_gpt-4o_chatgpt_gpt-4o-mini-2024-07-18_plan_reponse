        "response": "From the previous sub-task, we determined that the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain the rectangular boxes is given by r = \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{619}}{6} \\). To find \\( r^2 \\), we square this expression: \\( r^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{619}}{6}\\right)^2 = \\frac{619}{36} \\). The problem asks us to express \\( r^2 \\) as a fraction \\( \\frac{p}{q} \\) where \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) are relatively prime positive integers. In this case, \\( p = 619 \\) and \\( q = 36 \\) are already relatively prime, as they have no common factors other than 1. Therefore, the sum \\( p + q = 619 + 36 = 655 \\).\n\nAnswer:655",
