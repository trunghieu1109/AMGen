Question: Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.
Iteration: abstract_workflow_1_6
proposed answer: From the previous sub-task, we determined that the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain the rectangular boxes is given by r = \( \frac{\sqrt{619}}{6} \). To find \( r^2 \), we square this expression: \( r^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{619}}{6}\right)^2 = \frac{619}{36} \). The problem asks us to express \( r^2 \) as a fraction \( \frac{p}{q} \) where \( p \) and \( q \) are relatively prime positive integers. In this case, \( p = 619 \) and \( q = 36 \) are already relatively prime, as they have no common factors other than 1. Therefore, the sum \( p + q = 619 + 36 = 655 \).

proposed answer: From the final decision on r^2, we have r^2 = 10, which can be expressed as the fraction 10/1. In this fraction, p = 10 and q = 1, and they are relatively prime. Therefore, the sum p + q is 10 + 1 = 11.
