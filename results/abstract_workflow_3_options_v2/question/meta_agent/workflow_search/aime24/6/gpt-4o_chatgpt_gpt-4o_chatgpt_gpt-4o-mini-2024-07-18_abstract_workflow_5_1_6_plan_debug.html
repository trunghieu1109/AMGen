    <pre>Related original question:

Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$..

### Sub-task 5: Make final decision on r^2. 

 ### thinking by Final Decision Agent H4jj:
To determine the final decision on r^2, we need to consider the constraints given: the surface area of the box is 54 and the volume is 23. The goal is to find the maximum value of x^2 + y^2 + z^2, where x, y, and z are the dimensions of the box. The identity (x+y+z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + xz + yz) helps us express x^2 + y^2 + z^2 in terms of (x+y+z)^2 and the given surface area. We have xy + xz + yz = 27, so x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x+y+z)^2 - 54. To maximize x^2 + y^2 + z^2, we maximize (x+y+z)^2. By AM-GM inequality, x+y+z &gt;= 3 * 23^(1/3), which is approximately 8.44. Substituting this value, we get x^2 + y^2 + z^2 &gt;= 8.44^2 - 54 = 17.2736. However, through precise calculation and verification, the exact value of r^2 is found to be 10, as indicated by previous computations. This is because the maximum value of x^2 + y^2 + z^2 that satisfies the constraints is 40, leading to r^2 = 40/4 = 10. Therefore, r^2 = 10 can be expressed as a fraction 10/1, where 10 and 1 are relatively prime integers. Thus, the final decision on r^2 is 10.

### answer by Final Decision Agent H4jj:
10

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Find the sum p + q from the fraction p/q. 

 then justify completely and detailedly why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. Again, your task is only to answer the question Sub-task 6: Find the sum p + q from the fraction p/q. and explaination.</pre>

    <pre>From the final decision on r^2, we have r^2 = 10, which can be expressed as the fraction 10/1. In this fraction, p = 10 and q = 1, and they are relatively prime. Therefore, the sum p + q is 10 + 1 = 11.
