Question: Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?

proposed answer: The probability that a randomly colored octagon can be rotated to satisfy the condition is given as 3/128. In this fraction, 3 and 128 are relatively prime, meaning they have no common divisors other than 1. Therefore, m = 3 and n = 128. The problem asks for the sum m + n, which is 3 + 128. Thus, the sum is 131.

proposed answer: To make a final decision on the final probability, we need to ensure that the probability is expressed in its simplest form and verify the calculations. The problem involves coloring the vertices of a regular octagon and determining the probability that the octagon can be rotated such that all blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices. From the sub-tasks, we know there are 9 favorable colorings and a total of 256 possible colorings. Therefore, the probability is 9/256. We must check if 9 and 256 are relatively prime. Since 9 is 3^2 and 256 is 2^8, they have no common factors other than 1, confirming that 9/256 is in its simplest form. Thus, m = 9 and n = 256, and m + n = 9 + 256 = 265. This reasoning is consistent with the previous calculations and verifies that the fraction is in its simplest form. Therefore, the final decision on the probability is that it is 9/256, and m + n = 265.
