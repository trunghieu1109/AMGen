Question: Define $f(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{4}|$. Find the number of intersections of the graphs of \[y=4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \quad\text{ and }\quad x=4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))).\]
Iteration: abstract_workflow_1_1_3
proposed answer: To determine the number of intersections of the graphs y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))), we need to find the number of solutions to the equation 4g(f(sin(2πx))) = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). This simplifies to finding when g(f(sin(2πx))) = g(f(cos(3πy))). The function f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| maps any input to the range [0, 1/2]. The function g(x) = ||x| - 1/4| maps any input to the range [0, 1/4]. Therefore, both g(f(sin(2πx))) and g(f(cos(3πy))) have a range of [0, 1/4]. The function f(sin(2πx)) is periodic with period 1, and f(cos(3πy)) is periodic with period 2/3. The function g(x) is V-shaped with a minimum at x = 1/4. For g(f(sin(2πx))) = g(f(cos(3πy))), we need f(sin(2πx)) and f(cos(3πy)) to be equidistant from 1/4. Since both f(sin(2πx)) and f(cos(3πy)) take on every value in [0, 1/2] exactly once over their respective periods, we can equate them directly. The periodicity of f(sin(2πx)) and f(cos(3πy)) means that within one period of x and y, there will be multiple solutions. Specifically, for each value in [0, 1/2], there will be a corresponding value of x and y such that g(f(sin(2πx))) = g(f(cos(3πy))). Given the periodicity and symmetry, there will be 8 intersections in total, corresponding to the 8 solutions of the equation g(f(sin(2πx))) = g(f(cos(3πy))) over one period. The periodicity of f(sin(2πx)) and f(cos(3πy)) means that within one period of x and y, there will be multiple solutions.

proposed answer: To determine the number of intersections of the graphs y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))), we need to solve the equation 4g(f(sin(2πx))) = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). The functions f and g are piecewise and periodic. The function f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| is periodic with period 1 and symmetric about x = 0. The function g(x) = ||x| - 1/4| is also periodic and symmetric. The trigonometric functions sin(2πx) and cos(3πy) are periodic with periods 1 and 2/3, respectively. Within one period of x and y, the values of f(sin(2πx)) and f(cos(3πy)) will repeat, and we need to find when they are equal. The piecewise nature of f and g means that there are specific intervals where the functions take on certain values. By analyzing these intervals and considering the periodicity and symmetry, we find that there are 8 points where the graphs intersect. This is due to the fact that the functions repeat their values in a symmetric and periodic manner, leading to 8 solutions within the given range.
