In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.",

        "response": "To determine the number of residents who own all four items (diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts), we need to integrate the information from the previous sub-tasks. We know from Sub-task 1 that there are 900 residents, each owning a bag of candy hearts. Sub-task 3 tells us that 687 residents own at least one of the three items (diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade). This implies that 900 - 687 = 213 residents own only candy hearts and none of the other three items. Sub-task 4 provides that 234 residents own all three items (diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade). Since every resident owns candy hearts, these 234 residents also own candy hearts, meaning they own all four items. Therefore, the number of residents who own all four items is 234. This conclusion is based on the assumption that the data provided in the sub-tasks is accurate and that the ownership of candy hearts is universal among all residents, which is consistent with the problem statement.\n\nAnswer:234",

        "response": "To determine the number of residents who own all four items, we apply the principle of inclusion-exclusion. We know the total number of residents is 900, with 437 owning exactly two items, and 234 owning exactly three items. The total number of residents owning at least one of the three items (diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade) is 195 + 367 + 562 = 1124. This total counts residents multiple times if they own more than one item. Using inclusion-exclusion, we subtract the number of residents owning exactly two and three items from this total: 1124 - 437 - 234 = 453. This 453 includes those owning exactly one item and those owning all four items. Let y be the number of residents owning exactly one item, and x be the number of residents owning all four items. We have y + x = 453. The equation for the total number of residents is 900 = y + 437 + 234 + x. Substituting y = 453 - x into this equation gives 900 = (453 - x) + 437 + 234 + x. Simplifying, we find 900 = 1124, which is not possible, indicating an error in the assumption that any residents own all four items. Therefore, the number of residents owning all four items is 0.\n\nAnswer:0",
