Question: Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.

proposed answer: In subtask 4, the inradius of the tetrahedron was expressed in the form \( \frac{m \sqrt{n}}{p} \) as \( \frac{6 \sqrt{2}}{5} \). Here, \( m = 6 \), \( n = 2 \), and \( p = 5 \). It was verified that \( m \) and \( p \) are relatively prime, and \( n \) is square-free. Therefore, the expression is already in the desired form. The sum \( m + n + p = 6 + 2 + 5 = 13 \). This computation is complete and accurate, as it follows the problem's requirements and the conditions for \( m \), \( n \), and \( p \) are satisfied.

proposed answer: Both agents have independently calculated the inradius of the tetrahedron using the same method: finding the volume using the Cayley-Menger determinant and the areas of the faces using Heron's formula. They both arrived at the same expression for the inradius in the form mâˆšn/p, with m = 1, n = 41, and p = 6. Since both agents agree on these values and the calculations are consistent with the problem's requirements, the final output m+n+p is 1 + 41 + 6 = 48.
