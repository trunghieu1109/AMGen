    <pre>Related original question:

Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice&#39;s play..

 ### thinking by Debate Agent 4cmM:
To find the number of positive integers n less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob can guarantee a win, we need to determine how many multiples of 5 exist up to 2024. This is because, from the game analysis, we know that Bob has a winning strategy when n is a multiple of 5. The smallest multiple of 5 is 5, and the largest multiple of 5 less than or equal to 2024 can be found by dividing 2024 by 5. 2024 divided by 5 equals 404.8, so the largest integer k for which 5k is less than or equal to 2024 is 404. Therefore, there are 404 multiples of 5 from 5 to 2020 (inclusive), which are the numbers for which Bob can guarantee a win.

### thinking by Debate Agent c8wX:
To determine the number of positive integers n less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob can guarantee a win, we need to identify how many multiples of 5 exist up to 2024. From the analysis, we know that Bob has a winning strategy when n is a multiple of 5 because these positions are losing positions for Alice when both play optimally. The smallest multiple of 5 is 5, and the largest multiple of 5 less than or equal to 2024 can be found by dividing 2024 by 5 and taking the floor of the result. 2024 divided by 5 is 404.8, so the largest integer k for which 5k is less than or equal to 2024 is 404. Therefore, there are 404 multiples of 5 from 5 to 2020 (inclusive), which are the numbers for which Bob can guarantee a win.

    <pre>The game involves Alice and Bob taking turns to remove either 1 or 4 tokens from a stack of n tokens, with Alice going first. Bob can guarantee a win if he can always leave Alice in a losing position. Through analysis, we determine that the losing positions for Alice are when n is a multiple of 5. This is because if n is a multiple of 5, no matter what move Alice makes (removing 1 or 4 tokens), she will leave Bob with a non-multiple of 5, allowing Bob to eventually force Alice back into another multiple of 5. Therefore, Bob can guarantee a win when n is a multiple of 5. To find how many such positions exist for n less than or equal to 2024, we calculate the number of multiples of 5 up to 2024. The smallest multiple of 5 is 5, and the largest is found by dividing 2024 by 5, which gives 404.8. The largest integer k such that 5k is less than or equal to 2024 is 404. Thus, there are 404 multiples of 5 from 5 to 2020, inclusive, for which Bob can guarantee a win.
