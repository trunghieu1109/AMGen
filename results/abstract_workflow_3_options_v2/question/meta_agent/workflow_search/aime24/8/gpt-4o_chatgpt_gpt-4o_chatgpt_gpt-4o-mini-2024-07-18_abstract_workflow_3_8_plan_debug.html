    <pre>Related original question:

Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice&#39;s play..

 ### thinking by Debate Agent n4No:
The problem involves determining the number of positive integers n less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a guaranteed winning strategy. The analysis from previous steps indicates that Bob can guarantee a win for positions of the form 5k + 2, which are n = 2, 7, 12, ..., 2022. These positions form an arithmetic sequence with the first term a_1 = 2 and a common difference d = 5. The nth term of this sequence is given by a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d. Setting a_n = 2022, we solve 2022 = 2 + (n-1)5, which simplifies to n = 405. Therefore, there are 405 positions where Bob can guarantee a win. This conclusion is based on the assumption that the sequence 5k + 2 correctly represents the winning strategy for Bob, as derived from the game&#39;s rules and previous analysis. Since all agents agree on this analysis, the number of such positions is confirmed to be 405.

### thinking by Debate Agent pmgn:
To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers n less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a guaranteed winning strategy. From the analysis provided in the related sub-tasks, it is clear that Bob can guarantee a win when the number of tokens is in a position of the form 5k + 2. This is because these positions are losing positions for Alice, allowing Bob to win if he plays optimally. The sequence of positions where Bob can win starts at n = 2 and increases by 5 each time, forming an arithmetic sequence with the first term a_1 = 2 and a common difference d = 5. The nth term of this sequence is given by a_n = 2 + (n-1)5. To find the number of terms in this sequence that are less than or equal to 2024, we set a_n = 2022 and solve for n. This gives us 2022 = 2 + (n-1)5, which simplifies to n = 405. Therefore, there are 405 such positions, meaning there are 405 positive integers n for which Bob has a winning strategy. This reasoning is based on the game&#39;s rules and the analysis that positions of the form 5k + 2 are losing for Alice, allowing Bob to win with optimal play.
