The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.",

Here, \\( m = 1 \\) and \\( n = 115 \\) are relatively prime. To find \\( m+n \\), we simply add these two numbers together: \\( m+n = 1 + 115 = 116 \\).\n\nAnswer:116",
