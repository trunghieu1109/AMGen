Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.
[asy] size(10cm); usepackage(&#34;tikz&#34;);label(&#34;egin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(2,0)--(2,3)--(5,3)--(5,8)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}&#34;,origin); label(&#34;\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(0,3)--(3,3)--(3,5)--(8,5)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}&#34;,E); [/asy].

### Sub-task 6: Present the final count of valid paths as the solution to the query. 

 ### thinking by Debate Agent XSqg:
The task is to present the final count of valid paths that change direction exactly four times on an 8x8 grid. The paths consist of 8 right (R) moves and 8 up (U) moves, with exactly four changes in direction, resulting in five segments. The two possible patterns are R-U-R-U-R and U-R-U-R-U. For each pattern, the number of paths is calculated using combinations with repetition: C(10, 2) for distributing 8 moves into 3 segments, and C(9, 1) for distributing 8 moves into 2 segments. The total number of valid paths is the sum of the paths for both patterns: 2 * C(10, 2) * C(9, 1). Calculating these values gives C(10, 2) = 45 and C(9, 1) = 9, so the total number of valid paths is 2 * 45 * 9 = 810. This calculation has been verified and is consistent with the logic applied in the previous sub-tasks, confirming the total count of valid paths.

### thinking by Debate Agent oQ3b:
The problem involves finding the number of paths on an 8x8 grid that change direction exactly four times. This requires considering paths composed of 8 right (R) moves and 8 up (U) moves, divided into five segments with alternating directions, leading to four changes in direction. There are two possible segment patterns: R-U-R-U-R and U-R-U-R-U. For each pattern, the moves are distributed among the segments using combinations: C(10, 2) for distributing 8 moves into 3 segments and C(9, 1) for distributing 8 moves into 2 segments. The total number of paths is given by the sum of the paths for both patterns, calculated as 2 * C(10, 2) * C(9, 1). Substituting the values, we have C(10, 2) = 45 and C(9, 1) = 9, leading to a total of 2 * 45 * 9 = 810 paths. This calculation has been verified and is consistent with the approach used in previous sub-tasks, confirming the total count of valid paths.
