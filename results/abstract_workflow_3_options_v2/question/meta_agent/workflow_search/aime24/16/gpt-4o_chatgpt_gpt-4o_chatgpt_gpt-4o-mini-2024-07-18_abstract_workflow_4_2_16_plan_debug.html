    <pre>Related original question:

Let $\triangle ABC$ have circumcenter $O$ and incenter $I$ with $\overline{IA}\perp\overline{OI}$, circumradius $13$, and inradius $6$. Find $AB\cdot AC$..

### Sub-task 7: Calculate the product AB * AC using the transformed expressions. 

 ### thinking by Debate Agent 7Dgz:
To calculate the product AB * AC, we use the relationships derived from the problem&#39;s conditions. The triangle is a right triangle with the circumradius R = 13, making the hypotenuse BC = 26. The inradius r = 6 gives us the equation r = (a + b - c)/2 = 6, leading to a + b = 38. Additionally, the relationship abc = 312s, where s = (a + b + c)/2 = 32, provides abc = 9984. With c = 26, we find ab * 26 = 9984, leading to ab = 9984 / 26 = 384. This calculation is consistent with the properties of right triangles and the given circumradius and inradius, confirming the product AB * AC is 384.

### thinking by Debate Agent qWzh:
To calculate the product AB * AC, we utilize the relationships derived from the problem&#39;s conditions. The triangle is a right triangle with circumradius R = 13, which implies the hypotenuse BC = 2R = 26. The inradius r = 6 gives us the equation r = (a + b - c)/2 = 6, leading to a + b = 38. Additionally, the relationship abc = 312s, where s = (a + b + c)/2 = 32, provides abc = 9984. With c = 26, we find ab * 26 = 9984, leading to ab = 9984 / 26 = 384.

    <pre>Both agents have provided consistent reasoning and calculations for the product AB * AC. They have used the properties of the right triangle, the given circumradius R = 13, and inradius r = 6 to derive the necessary relationships. The circumradius implies the hypotenuse BC = 26, and the inradius gives the equation a + b = 38. Using the relationship abc = 312s with s = 32, they calculated abc = 9984. With c = 26, they found ab = 9984 / 26 = 384. This is consistent with the properties of the triangle and the given conditions, confirming the product AB * AC is 384.
