Question: Example(question='Consider a system of three spins S1, S2 and S3. Each of which can take spin +1 and -1. The energy of the system is given by, E= -J[ S1S2 +S1S3+S2S3 ].\nFind the partition function Z of the system. (\\beta = 1/kT , k= boltzmann constant and T= temperature)', choice1='Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)', choice2='Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)', choice3='Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)', choice4='Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_8_193
proposed answer: The derived partition function Z from the calculations is Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ). This expression matches exactly with choice 1, which states Z = 2 e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ). The calculations for the partition function were based on the energies of the configurations of the spins, and the terms align correctly with the provided options. Therefore, the correct answer is choice 1.
