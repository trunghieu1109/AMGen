Question: Example(question='Consider a system of three spins S1, S2 and S3. Each of which can take spin +1 and -1. The energy of the system is given by, E= -J[ S1S2 +S1S3+S2S3 ].\nFind the partition function Z of the system. (\\beta = 1/kT , k= boltzmann constant and T= temperature)', choice1='Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)', choice2='Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)', choice3='Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)', choice4='Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: After reviewing the calculations and contributions to the partition function Z for the system of three spins, it is clear that the derived expression is Z = 2 e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ). This expression corresponds to the energy states of the system, where the configurations leading to energy -3J contribute 2e^(3Jβ) and those leading to energy -J contribute 6e^(-Jβ). This matches exactly with choice A) from the provided options. The other choices do not reflect the correct contributions based on the energy states and their respective Boltzmann factors. Therefore, the correct answer is A.
