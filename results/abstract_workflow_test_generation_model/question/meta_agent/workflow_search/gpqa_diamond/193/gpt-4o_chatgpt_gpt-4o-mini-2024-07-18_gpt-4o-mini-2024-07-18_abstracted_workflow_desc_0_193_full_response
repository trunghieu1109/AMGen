We will evaluate this for each of the 8 configurations identified previously. The contributions to the energy from each pair of spins will depend on whether they are both +1 or both -1 (which will contribute +1) or mixed (which will contribute -1). After calculating the energy for each configuration, we can sum the contributions to find the partition function Z. The configurations and their corresponding energies are as follows: \n1. (+1, +1, +1) -> E = -3J \n2. (+1, +1, -1) -> E = -J \n3. (+1, -1, +1) -> E = -J \n4. (+1, -1, -1) -> E = +J \n5. (-1, +1, +1) -> E = -J \n6. (-1, +1, -1) -> E = +J \n7. (-1, -1, +1) -> E = +J \n8.
