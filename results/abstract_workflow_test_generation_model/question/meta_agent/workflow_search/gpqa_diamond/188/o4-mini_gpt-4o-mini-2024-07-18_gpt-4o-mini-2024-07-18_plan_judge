Question: Example(question='Which of the following (effective) particles is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry?', choice1='Magnon', choice2='Skyrmion', choice3='Pion', choice4='Phonon', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_2_188
proposed answer: Phonons are quantized vibrations of the lattice in a solid and do not arise from any spontaneously-broken symmetry. In contrast, magnons, skyrmions, and pions are all associated with different forms of spontaneously-broken symmetries in their respective physical contexts. Therefore, phonons are the particle that is not associated with spontaneously-broken symmetry.
