Magnons are excitations in a magnetically ordered system and are associated with the breaking of spin symmetry. Skyrmions are topological solitons that arise in systems with broken chiral symmetry. Pions are the lightest mesons and are associated with the breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Phonons, on the other hand, are quantized sound waves in a crystal lattice and do not arise from a spontaneously-broken symmetry; they are associated with the normal modes of vibration of the lattice.

Magnons arise in ferromagnetic systems where spin symmetry is broken, so they are associated with spontaneously-broken symmetry. Skyrmions are topological solitons in systems with broken chiral symmetry, thus they also relate to spontaneously-broken symmetry. Pions are associated with the breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics, which means they are linked to spontaneously-broken symmetry as well. Phonons, however, represent quantized vibrations in a crystal lattice and do not originate from a spontaneously-broken symmetry; they correspond to the normal modes of the lattice and do not involve any symmetry breaking. Therefore, the particle that is not associated with spontaneously-broken symmetry is the phonon.; answer: D\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent Tyie, evaluating association cases, thinking: To determine which particle is not associated with spontaneously-broken symmetry, we analyze each candidate: Magnons are excitations in magnetically ordered systems and arise from broken spin symmetry.
