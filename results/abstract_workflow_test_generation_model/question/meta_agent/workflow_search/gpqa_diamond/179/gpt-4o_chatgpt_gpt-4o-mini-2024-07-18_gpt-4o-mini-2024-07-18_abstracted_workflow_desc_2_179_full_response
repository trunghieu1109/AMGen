The principle at play is Coulomb's law, which describes the interaction between charged particles. The potential energy U between two point charges q1 and q2 separated by a distance r is given by U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant. In this case, we have multiple charges, and we need to consider the potential energy contributions from each pair of charges. The 12 charges are at a fixed distance from the point charge at P, and we need to sum the potential energy contributions from all interactions. Therefore, the physical principles involved are electrostatic interactions and potential energy calculations for multiple point charges.; answer - A\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - To calculate the electrostatic potential energy of a system of point charges, we use the formula derived from Coulomb's law. The potential energy U between two charges q1 and q2 separated by a distance r is given by U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant (approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N m^2/C^2). In the case of multiple charges, we need to sum the potential energy contributions from all unique pairs of charges. For this specific problem, with 12 charges of 2e each at a distance of 2 m from the fixed charge at point P, we calculate the potential energy between each of the 12 charges and the charge at P, and then sum these contributions to find the total potential energy of the system.

In this scenario, there are 12 identical charges, each with charge 2e, located at a distance of 2 m from a fixed charge of 2e at point P. The total potential energy of the system is the sum of the potential energies between the fixed charge and each of the 12 charges. Therefore, the total potential energy U_total can be calculated as: U_total = 12 * (k * (2e * 2e) / 2) = 12 * (k * (4e^2) / 2) = 6k * (4e^2) = 24k * e^2.

In this specific configuration, we have 12 charges, each with charge 2e, fixed at a distance of 2 m from the charge at point P (which also has charge 2e). The total potential energy of the system will be the sum of the potential energies of each of the 12 charges with respect to the charge at point P. Therefore, the formula for the total potential energy U_total of this system can be expressed as U_total = 12 * (k * (2e * 2e) / 2), where each pair contributes to the total potential energy.
