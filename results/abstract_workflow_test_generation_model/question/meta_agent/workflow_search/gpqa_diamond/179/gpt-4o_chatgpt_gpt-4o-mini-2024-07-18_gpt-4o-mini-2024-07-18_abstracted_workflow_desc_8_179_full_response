Here, k (Coulomb's constant) is approximately 8.99 x 10^9 N m²/C², q1 and q2 are both 2e (where e is the elementary charge, approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 C), and r is the distance, which is 2 m. Therefore, q1 = q2 = 2 * 1.602 x 10^-19 C = 3.204 x 10^-19 C. Plugging in the values, we get U = (8.99 x 10^9) * (3.204 x 10^-19) * (3.204 x 10^-19) / 2.
