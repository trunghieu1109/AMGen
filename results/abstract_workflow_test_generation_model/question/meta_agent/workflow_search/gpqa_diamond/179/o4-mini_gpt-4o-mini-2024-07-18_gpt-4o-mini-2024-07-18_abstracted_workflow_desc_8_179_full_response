This arrangement ensures that the distances between each pair of charges are maximized, which minimizes the repulsive potential energy due to their like charges. A common configuration for minimizing energy in such cases is to place the charges at the vertices of a regular polyhedron. For 12 charges, an arrangement like that of a cuboctahedron or similar symmetric configuration would ensure that the potential energy is minimized.

The most effective configuration for minimizing potential energy in such a case is to distribute the charges uniformly, which can be achieved by placing them at the vertices of a regular polyhedron. The arrangement that allows for such a uniform distribution while maintaining symmetry is the icosahedron, which has 12 vertices. This arrangement ensures that each charge experiences the same amount of repulsion from the others, thereby minimizing the overall potential energy of the system.

The potential energy (U) between two point charges is given by the formula U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, q1 and q2 are the magnitudes of the charges, and r is the distance between them. The central charge is fixed at P and has a charge of 2e, while each of the 12 outer charges also has a charge of 2e. The distance from the central charge to each outer charge is 2 m. Therefore, the potential energy between the central charge and one outer charge is U_central = k * (2e * 2e) / 2 = 2k * e^2. Since there are 12 outer charges, the total potential energy due to the central charge is U_total_central = 12 * U_central = 12 * 2k * e^2 = 24k * e^2. Next, we need to consider the interactions among the 12 outer charges. The potential energy between any two outer charges is also given by the same formula, but we need to account for the specific distances between them based on their arrangement. For a symmetrical arrangement like an icosahedron, we can calculate the average distance between the outer charges and multiply by the number of unique pairs of charges (which is 12 choose 2 = 66). Thus, the total potential energy among the outer charges can be expressed as U_outer = k * (2e * 2e) / d * 66, where d is the average distance between the outer charges. Combining these two contributions gives us the total potential energy of the system. Therefore, the symbolic expression for the total potential energy U_total can be written as U_total = 24k * e^2 + k * (2e * 2e) / d * 66.; answer: U_total = 24k * e^2 + k * (2e * 2e) / d * 66\n<SEPERATOR>\nCritic agent o2C2, providing feedback, thinking: The expression for the total potential energy is correct in its formulation, but the average distance 'd' between the outer charges needs to be calculated based on the specific geometry of the icosahedral arrangement.
