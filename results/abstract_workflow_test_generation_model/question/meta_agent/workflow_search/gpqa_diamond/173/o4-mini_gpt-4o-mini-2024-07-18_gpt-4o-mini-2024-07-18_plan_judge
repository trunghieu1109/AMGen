Question: Example(question='An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. A spontaneous fission occurs in which it splits into two fragments (and nothing else), such that one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other (in terms of their rest-masses). The sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. \n\nKinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?\n\n(Ignore the electrons.)', choice1='10 MeV.', choice2='5 MeV.', choice3='2 MeV.', choice4='20 MeV.', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_6_173
proposed answer: After analyzing the calculations for the difference in kinetic energy ΔT = T1_rel - T1_classical, it is evident that the relativistic kinetic energy is significantly greater than the classical kinetic energy due to the high velocities involved in the fission process. The relativistic effects, including mass-energy equivalence and relativistic momentum, lead to a substantial increase in kinetic energy. Among the provided choices, 10 MeV stands out as the closest match to the calculated ΔT, reflecting the significant impact of relativistic dynamics in this scenario.
