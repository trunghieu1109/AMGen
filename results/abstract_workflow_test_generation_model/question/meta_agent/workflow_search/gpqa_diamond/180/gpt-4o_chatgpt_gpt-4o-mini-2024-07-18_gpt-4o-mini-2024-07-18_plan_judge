proposed answer: The cessation of the pp-III branch significantly reduces the production of neutrinos in the 700-800 keV band, as this branch is primarily responsible for generating neutrinos in that energy range. The 800-900 keV band, however, continues to receive contributions from other fusion processes that are unaffected by the stopping of the pp-III branch. This leads to a much lower flux in the 700-800 keV band compared to the 800-900 keV band, resulting in a ratio of approximately 0.1 (10^-1). Therefore, the expected ratio of the flux between the two energy bands is 0.1, indicating a significant decrease in the lower energy band relative to the higher energy band due to its reliance on the pp-III branch for production.

proposed answer: The cessation of the pp-III branch in the Sun would lead to a significant reduction in the production of neutrinos in the 700-800 keV energy band, as this branch is responsible for generating a substantial number of neutrinos in that specific range. Meanwhile, the 800-900 keV band would still receive contributions from the remaining pp-I and pp-II branches, which are unaffected by the stopping of the pp-III branch. This results in a much lower flux for the 700-800 keV band compared to the 800-900 keV band. Therefore, the expected flux ratio of neutrinos in the 700-800 keV band to those in the 800-900 keV band would be approximately 0.1 (10^-1), indicating that the flux from the first band is significantly lower than that from the second band after the cessation of the pp-III branch.
