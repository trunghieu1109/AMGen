Question: Example(question='In an inactive state, a transcription factor subunit awaits an activation signal from the membrane phosphorylation cascade. Upon phosphorylation on the Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, shuttles into the nucleus, and serves in gene transcription. A missense mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. You observe that a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Which of the following molecular phenotypes is most likely observed in the presence of mutation Y?', choice1='loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype', choice2='protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype', choice3='protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele', choice4='change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: In the presence of mutation Y, which is a dominant-negative mutation in the dimerization domain, it is expected to interfere with the function of the wild-type transcription factor. This interference would prevent the formation of functional dimers, which are essential for the transcription factor's activity. The dominant-negative effect suggests that the wild-type phenotype is masked by the presence of the mutant protein, leading to a situation where the overall function of the transcription factor is compromised despite the presence of the wild-type allele. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is 'loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype'.

proposed answer: Mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation, which means it interferes with the function of the wild-type protein. This interference prevents the formation of functional dimers that are necessary for the transcription factor's activity. As a result, the presence of mutation Y leads to a loss of protein dimerization, which is critical for the transcription factor's function. The wild-type protein cannot form functional dimers with the mutant protein, leading to diminished transcriptional activity. Therefore, the most likely observed molecular phenotype in the presence of mutation Y is 'loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype'. This choice reflects the dominant-negative effect of mutation Y, which disrupts the normal function of the transcription factor without completely abolishing the presence of the wild-type protein, thus aligning with the observed molecular phenotype.

proposed answer: The presence of mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation, which means it interferes with the function of the wild-type protein. Dimerization is essential for the transcription factor's activity, so mutation Y would likely prevent the wild-type protein from forming functional dimers. This disruption can lead to the wild-type protein being misfolded or unstable, resulting in its degradation. Therefore, the most likely molecular phenotype observed in the presence of mutation Y is 'protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele'. This aligns with the characteristics of dominant-negative mutations, which typically lead to a loss of function of the wild-type protein due to interference in dimerization or stability.
