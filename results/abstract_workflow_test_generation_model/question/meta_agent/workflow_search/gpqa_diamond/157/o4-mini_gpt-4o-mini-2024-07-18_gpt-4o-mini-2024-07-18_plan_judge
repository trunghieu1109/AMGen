Question: Example(question='In an inactive state, a transcription factor subunit awaits an activation signal from the membrane phosphorylation cascade. Upon phosphorylation on the Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, shuttles into the nucleus, and serves in gene transcription. A missense mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. You observe that a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Which of the following molecular phenotypes is most likely observed in the presence of mutation Y?', choice1='loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype', choice2='protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype', choice3='protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele', choice4='change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_2_157
proposed answer: The dominant-negative mutation Y in the dimerization domain interferes with the normal function of the wild-type protein by forming non-functional dimers. This interaction can lead to the degradation of the wild-type protein, as it is unable to function properly when paired with the mutant. Therefore, the most fitting molecular phenotype that corresponds to the aggregation/loss-of-function phenotype is 'protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele'. This is because the presence of the dominant-negative mutation results in the wild-type protein being unable to perform its normal function, leading to a loss-of-function phenotype.

proposed answer: The dominant-negative mutation Y in the dimerization domain likely leads to the formation of nonfunctional complexes with the wild-type protein, which can result in a loss-of-function phenotype. This is consistent with the idea that dominant-negative mutations interfere with the normal function of the wild-type protein by forming inactive heterodimers. The presence of mutation Y would not cause degradation of the wild-type protein but rather inhibit its function by trapping it in a nonfunctional state. Therefore, the most likely molecular phenotype observed in the presence of mutation Y is 'protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele', as the wild-type protein is effectively rendered nonfunctional due to the presence of the dominant-negative mutation. This aligns with choice C, which indicates a loss-of-function due to the presence of the dominant-negative mutation.
