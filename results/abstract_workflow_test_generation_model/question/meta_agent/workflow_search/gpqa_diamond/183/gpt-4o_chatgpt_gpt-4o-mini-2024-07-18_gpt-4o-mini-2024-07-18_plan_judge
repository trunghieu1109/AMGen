proposed answer: The selected reaction sequence from choice 1 is prioritized based on its overall efficiency and practicality for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. The sequence begins with a Friedel-Crafts alkylation using tert-butyl chloride and AlCl3, which is a well-established method for introducing bulky groups onto the benzene ring. This step is crucial as it effectively installs the tert-butyl group, which is necessary for the subsequent nitration step. The nitration with HNO3/H2SO4 is known to introduce the nitro group at the meta position relative to the tert-butyl group, which is essential for the desired product. The sequence avoids unnecessary complications and competing reactions that are present in other choices, such as the placement of SO3/H2SO4 and NaNO2/HCl, which could lead to lower yields or unwanted byproducts. Therefore, choice 1 is the most straightforward and logical pathway, making it the best option for achieving a high yield of the target compound.

proposed answer: After analyzing the provided reaction sequences, it is evident that choice A is the most suitable for achieving a high yield of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. The sequence begins with the Friedel-Crafts alkylation using tert-butyl chloride and AlCl3, which is a reliable method for introducing the tert-butyl group onto the benzene ring. This step is crucial as it sets the stage for subsequent reactions. The nitration step using HNO3/H2SO4 is also well-established and effective, allowing for the introduction of the nitro group at the meta position, which is favorable for further substitutions. The presence of the Fe/HCl step is manageable and does not significantly detract from the overall yield potential. In contrast, the other choices introduce unnecessary complexity or less favorable reaction conditions that could lead to lower yields or unwanted byproducts. Therefore, choice A is the most coherent and efficient pathway for synthesizing the target compound, ensuring both yield and structural integrity are maintained throughout the process.
