Question: Example(question='We would like to dissolve (at 25°С) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm3 total volume. What is the minimum volume (cm3) of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution and what is the pH of the resulting solution?', choice1='pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3', choice2='pH 2.69; 30.09 cm3', choice3='pH 3.16; 32.14 cm3', choice4='pH 4.94; 20.40 cm3', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_8_162
proposed answer: After reviewing the calculations and the provided choices, it is clear that the minimum volume of 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required to dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)3 is 28.05 cm3, and the resulting pH of the solution is 2.04. The only choice that matches both the calculated volume and pH is choice A, which states 'pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3'. Therefore, the correct answer is A.
