For a relativistic particle, the energy E is given by E = √(p²c² + m₀²c⁴), where p is the momentum, c is the speed of light, and m₀ is the rest mass. The uncertainty in energy ΔE can be related to the uncertainty in momentum Δp by the formula ΔE = c² * (Δp / m₀) for small uncertainties. Given that the electron is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light, we can use this relationship to estimate ΔE. Since we have already calculated Δp, we can substitute it into this relationship to find ΔE. However, we also need to consider the order of magnitude of ΔE based on Δp. The calculated Δp is approximately 5.275 * 10^(-25) kg·m/s, and using the mass of the electron (approximately 9.11 * 10^(-31) kg), we can estimate ΔE.
