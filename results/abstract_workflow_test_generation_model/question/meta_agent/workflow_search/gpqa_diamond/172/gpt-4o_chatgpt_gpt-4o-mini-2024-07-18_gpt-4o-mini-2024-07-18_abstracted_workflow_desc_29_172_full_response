Answer is a string include the answer for this query'}], sub_tasks="Sub-task 1 output: thinking - To find the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, we start with the formula Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2. We know Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 * 10^(-9) m. The reduced Planck's constant ħ is approximately 1.055 * 10^(-34) J·s. We can rearrange the inequality to find Δp: Δp ≥ ħ/(2 * Δx). Plugging in the values, we get Δp ≥ (1.055 * 10^(-34) J·s) / (2 * 0.1 * 10^(-9) m) = (1.055 * 10^(-34)) / (2 * 0.1 * 10^(-9)) = (1.055 * 10^(-34)) / (2 * 10^(-10)) = 5.275 * 10^(-25) kg·m/s.

From sub-task 1, we found that the uncertainty in momentum Δp is approximately 5.275 * 10^(-25) kg·m/s. The speed of the electron is given as v = 2 * 10^8 m/s. Now we can calculate ΔE: ΔE = (5.275 * 10^(-25) kg·m/s) * (2 * 10^8 m/s) = 1.055 * 10^(-16) J. This value is approximately in the range of ~10^(-16) J, which corresponds to choice 3.
