Question: Example(question='Consider an oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis). Because it oscillates, it would radiate at a wavelength \\lambda. In the radiation zone, the radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of \\lambda and the angle \\theta (with z-axis), along which the power is measured. If the maximum power thus radiated is A, the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle \\theta = 30^0 and a possible form of f are, respectively,', choice1='1/2, \\lambda^(-4)', choice2='3/4, \\lambda^(-6)', choice3='1/4, \\lambda^(-4)', choice4='1/4, \\lambda^(-3)', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: After analyzing the derived functional form f(λ, θ) = K·λ^(-2)·(1/4) and considering the choices provided, I found that the angular fraction of 1/4 aligns with choice C, which states '1/4, λ^(-4)'. Although the exponent for λ in my derived function is -2, the factor of 1/4 from sin²(30°) leads to the conclusion that the angular fraction is indeed 1/4. Therefore, the best match for the derived functional form against the provided choices is choice C.
