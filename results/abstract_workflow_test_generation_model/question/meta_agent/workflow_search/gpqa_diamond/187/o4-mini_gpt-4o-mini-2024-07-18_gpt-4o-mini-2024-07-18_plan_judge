Question: Example(question='Consider a rhombohedral crystal, with the interatomic distance of 10 Angstrom and the angles $\\quad\\alpha=\\beta=\\gamma=30^{0}$. What is the interplanar distance of the (111) plane of the crystal?\n', choice1='9.54 Angstrom', choice2='8.95 Angstrom', choice3='9.08 Angstrom', choice4='10.05 Angstrom', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_25_187
proposed answer: After reviewing the calculations for the interplanar distance d_111 in the rhombohedral crystal, it has been consistently found to be approximately 9.08 Å. This value directly corresponds to one of the provided options. The other options (9.54 Å, 8.95 Å, and 10.05 Å) do not match the computed result. Therefore, the closest match to the calculated interplanar distance is indeed 9.08 Å, which corresponds to option C.
