First, we calculate the components: h^2 + k^2 + l^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 3. Next, we calculate 2 * (h * k + h * l + k * l) = 2 * (1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1) = 2 * 3 = 6. Now we need to find cos(30°), which is √3/2. Therefore, we have: d_111 = 10 / sqrt(3 + 6 * (√3/2)). This simplifies to d_111 = 10 / sqrt(3 + 3√3).

For a rhombohedral lattice, where α = β = γ, this simplifies to d_hkl = a / sqrt(h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2 * h * k * cos(α) + 2 * h * l * cos(α) + 2 * k * l * cos(α)). Since all angles are equal, we can use cos(30°) = sqrt(3)/2. Therefore, the formula can be simplified further for specific calculations later on. This is the correct formulation based on the properties of rhombohedral crystals.; answer: d_hkl = a / sqrt(h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2 * h * k * cos(α) + 2 * h * l * cos(α) + 2 * k * l * cos(α))\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent C8ap, deriving general d_hkl formula, thinking: The general formula for interplanar spacing d_hkl in a rhombohedral lattice is derived from the relationship between the lattice parameters and the Miller indices (h, k, l). For a rhombohedral crystal system, the interplanar spacing can be expressed as: d_hkl = (a / √(h² + k² + l² + 2 * h * k * cos(α) + 2 * h * l * cos(β) + 2 * k * l * cos(γ))). Since in this case α = β = γ = 30°, we can simplify this further. The cosine of 30 degrees is √3/2, which allows us to substitute and simplify the formula accordingly for the specific interplanar spacing we are interested in. Therefore, the interplanar spacing formula for the (111) plane becomes d_111 = a / √(h² + k² + l² + h * k * √3 + h * l * √3 + k * l * √3).; answer: d_hkl = a / √(h² + k² + l² + h * k * √3 + h * l * √3 + k * l * √3)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT agent Pskr, computing d_111, thinking: To find the interplanar distance d_111 for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal, we substitute h = 1, k = 1, l = 1, a = 10 Å, and α = 30° into the simplified formula: d_hkl = a / sqrt(h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2 * (h * k + h * l + k * l) * cos(α)). First, we calculate the components: h^2 + k^2 + l^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 3. Next, we calculate 2 * (h * k + h * l + k * l) = 2 * (1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1) = 2 * 3 = 6.
