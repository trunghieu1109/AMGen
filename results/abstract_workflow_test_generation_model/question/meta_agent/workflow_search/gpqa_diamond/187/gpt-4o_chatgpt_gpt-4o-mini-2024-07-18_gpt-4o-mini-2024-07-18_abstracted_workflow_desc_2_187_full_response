Here, h, k, l are the Miller indices of the plane, which are (1, 1, 1) for the (111) plane. The interatomic distance a is given as 10 Angstrom, and the angle α is given as 30 degrees. We first calculate the necessary components: h² + k² + l² = 1² + 1² + 1² = 3, and hk + kl + hl = 1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1 = 3. The cosine of 30 degrees is √3/2. Plugging these values into the formula, we can calculate d. After performing the calculations, we find that the interplanar distance d corresponds to one of the provided choices.
