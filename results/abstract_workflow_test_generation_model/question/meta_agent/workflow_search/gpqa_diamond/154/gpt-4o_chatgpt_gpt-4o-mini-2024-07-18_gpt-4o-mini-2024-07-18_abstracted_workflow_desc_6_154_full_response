The variance is given by the formula Var(P_z) = <P_z^2> - (<P_z>)^2. From previous calculations, we have determined that <P_z> = 0 and <P_z^2> = hbar^2/2. Substituting these values into the variance formula gives us: Var(P_z) = (hbar^2/2) - (0)^2 = hbar^2/2. The uncertainty ΔP_z is defined as the square root of the variance, so we compute ΔP_z = √(Var(P_z)) = √(hbar^2/2) = hbar/√2. Therefore, the correct answer for the uncertainty ΔP_z is hbar/√2, which corresponds to choice C.\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent fAhb:\nC\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 7: Compare the calculated uncertainty ΔP_z with the given choices to determine the correct answer.\n\n Return your answer in the "answer" entry and justify detailedly why you think so in the "thinking" entry.

The state vector is |ψ> = (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2)^T. We first apply the operator P_z to this state vector. The action of P_z on |ψ> gives us P_z |ψ> = P_z * |ψ| = (hbar * (-1/2), 0, -hbar * (-1/2)) = (-hbar/2, 0, hbar/2). Then we take the inner product <ψ|P_z|ψ> = (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2) * (-hbar/2, 0, hbar/2). This results in: <ψ|P_z|ψ> = (-1/2)(-hbar/2) + (1/sqrt(2))(0) + (-1/2)(hbar/2) = (hbar/4) + 0 - (hbar/4) = 0. Therefore, the expectation value <P_z> = 0. The uncertainty ΔP_z can be found using the formula ΔP_z = sqrt(<P_z^2> - <P_z>^2). We also need to compute <P_z^2>. Calculating P_z^2 gives us the same diagonal matrix with squares of the eigenvalues, which will have the same structure. The eigenvalues are hbar and -hbar, thus <P_z^2> = (1/4)(hbar^2) + 0 + (1/4)(hbar^2) = (hbar^2/4) + 0 + (hbar^2/4) = (hbar^2/2). Since <P_z> = 0, we find ΔP_z = sqrt(<P_z^2>) = sqrt(hbar^2/2) = hbar/sqrt(2). Thus the uncertainty ΔP_z is hbar/sqrt(2).; answer: C\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent NJ6N, calculating expectation value of P_z, thinking: To calculate the expectation value of P_z, we use the formula \\langle P_z \\rangle = \\psi^\\dagger P_z \\psi, where \\psi is the state vector and P_z is the operator matrix. The state vector is \\psi = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}. The adjoint (conjugate transpose) of \\psi is \\psi^\\dagger = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}. Multiplying these together, we first calculate P_z \\psi.
