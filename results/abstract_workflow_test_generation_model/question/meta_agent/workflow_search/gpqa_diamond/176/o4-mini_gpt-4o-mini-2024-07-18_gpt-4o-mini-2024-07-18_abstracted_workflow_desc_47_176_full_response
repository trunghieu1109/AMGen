We know that R1/R2 = 1.5, which gives us (1.5)^2 = 2.25. From the previous sub-task, we found that T1/T2 ≈ 0.9977, thus (T1/T2)^4 = (0.9977)^4, which is approximately 0.9903. Now, we multiply these two results together: L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9903 ≈ 2.226. This is closest to the choice of ~2.23. Therefore, the correct answer is ~2.23.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent vyT3:\nTo compute the luminosity ratio L1/L2, we use the formula L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4. We know from the problem that R1/R2 = 1.5. From the previous sub-task, we found that T1/T2 ≈ 0.9977. Plugging these values into the formula gives us L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * (0.9977)^4. Calculating this step-by-step: (1.5)^2 = 2.25 and (0.9977)^4 is approximately 0.9902. Therefore, L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9902 ≈ 2.2245.

Given that R1/R2 = 1.5 and from the previous calculation T1/T2 ≈ 0.9977, we can substitute these values into the formula. First, we calculate (R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. Next, we calculate (T1/T2)^4 = (0.9977)^4, which is approximately 0.9902. Now, we multiply these results: L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9902 ≈ 2.224.

The mass ratio M1/M2 is also 1.5 (since the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2). The observed peak wavelength is the same for both stars, but no specific numerical value is given, so we cannot extract a numerical value for it. The radial velocities are given as 0 km/s for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. Therefore, the extracted parameters are: R1/R2 = 1.5, M1/M2 = 1.5, observed peak wavelength = same (no numerical value), and radial velocities = 0 km/s for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2.; answer - R1/R2 = 1.5, M1/M2 = 1.5, peak wavelength = same, radial velocities = 0 km/s (Star_1), 700 km/s (Star_2)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - To compute the rest-frame wavelength ratio λ1_rest/λ2_rest using the Doppler shift formula, we can use the relation for the observed wavelength shift due to radial velocity. The formula for the observed wavelength (λ_observed) is given by λ_observed = λ_rest * (1 + v/c) for an object moving away from the observer, where v is the radial velocity and c is the speed of light. For Star_1, which has a velocity v1 = 0 km/s, the observed wavelength λ1_observed = λ1_rest. For Star_2, with a velocity v2 = 700 km/s, the observed wavelength is λ2_observed = λ2_rest * (1 + 700/c). The ratio of the rest-frame wavelengths is then calculated as follows: λ1_rest/λ2_rest = λ1_observed / (λ2_observed / (1 + 700/c)) = λ1_observed * (1 + 700/c) / λ2_observed. Since both stars have the same observed peak wavelength, we can set λ1_observed = λ2_observed, leading to λ1_rest/λ2_rest = (1 + 700/c). Using c ≈ 300,000 km/s, we find that 700/c ≈ 0.00233, thus λ1_rest/λ2_rest ≈ 1 + 0.00233 ≈ 1.00233. Therefore, the rest-frame wavelength ratio is approximately 1.00233.; answer - A\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - To derive the temperature ratio T1/T2 using Wien's displacement law, we use the relationship that the peak wavelength (λ) of black body radiation is inversely proportional to the temperature (T) of the black body. Specifically, Wien's law states that λ_max * T = b, where b is a constant. Therefore, we can express the temperature ratio as T1/T2 = λ2_rest/λ1_rest. From the previous sub-task, we found that λ1_rest/λ2_rest ≈ 1.00233, which means λ2_rest/λ1_rest ≈ 1/1.00233. Thus, T1/T2 = 1/1.00233 ≈ 0.9977. This indicates that T1 is slightly less than T2. However, since the question asks for the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we need to consider the luminosity formula which is proportional to R^2 * T^4. Given that R1/R2 = 1.5 and T1/T2 is approximately 0.9977, we can compute the luminosity ratio as follows: L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4. Plugging in the values, we get L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * (0.9977)^4.

For Star_1, with v1 = 0 km/s, the observed wavelength λ1_observed = λ1_rest. For Star_2, with v2 = 700 km/s, the observed wavelength is λ2_observed = λ2_rest * (1 + 700/c). Since the observed peak wavelengths are the same, we can equate λ1_observed and λ2_observed, leading to λ1_rest = λ2_rest * (1 + 700/c). Thus, the ratio λ1_rest/λ2_rest = 1/(1 + 700/c). Given that c is approximately 300,000 km/s, we can compute this ratio: λ1_rest/λ2_rest = 1/(1 + 700/300000) = 1/(1 + 0.00233) ≈ 1/1.00233, which is approximately 0.9977.

For Star_1, with v1 = 0 km/s, we have λ1_obs = λ1_rest * (1 + 0/300,000) = λ1_rest. For Star_2, with v2 = 700 km/s, we have λ2_obs = λ2_rest * (1 + 700/300,000). The rest-frame wavelength ratio is then λ1_rest / λ2_rest = λ1_obs / λ2_obs = λ1_rest / (λ2_rest * (1 + 700/300,000)). Since the observed peak wavelengths are the same, we can denote them as λ and find that λ1_rest / λ2_rest = λ / (λ * (1 + 700/300,000)) = 1 / (1 + 0.00233) = 1 / 1.00233.
