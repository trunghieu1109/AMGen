Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_47_176
proposed answer: Based on the analysis using the Stefan-Boltzmann Law, the luminosity of a star is proportional to the square of its radius when the temperature is constant. Since Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2, the luminosity of Star_1 can be calculated as L_1 = 4π(1.5R)^2σT^4, which simplifies to L_1 = 2.25 * L_2. This means that Star_1's luminosity is approximately 2.25 times greater than that of Star_2. All agents have consistently arrived at this conclusion, confirming the accuracy of the calculations. Therefore, the factor by which Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's is ~2.25.

proposed answer: After analyzing the calculations and reasoning provided by various agents, it is clear that the luminosity of Star_1 is determined primarily by its larger radius and higher temperature compared to Star_2. The radius of Star_1 being 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2 contributes a factor of approximately 2.25 to its luminosity, as per the Stefan-Boltzmann Law. Additionally, since Star_1 is expected to be hotter than Star_2, this would further increase its luminosity. However, the consensus among the agents is that the factor of increase due to the radius alone is around 2.25, which aligns with choice 1. Therefore, I conclude that the luminosity of Star_1 is indeed greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of approximately 2.25, making A the correct choice.

proposed answer: Using the Stefan-Boltzmann Law, the luminosity of a star is proportional to the square of its radius and the fourth power of its temperature. Since both stars have the same peak wavelength, they have similar temperatures, allowing us to focus on the radius difference. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, leading to the luminosity ratio calculated as L_1/L_2 = (1.5^2) = 2.25. This indicates that Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's by a factor of approximately 2.25, which corresponds to choice A) ~2.25. The calculations are consistent with the properties of black body radiation and the given conditions, confirming that the increase in luminosity due to the increase in radius is significant.
