Question: Example(question='You identified a new quorum-sensing peptide in the bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus. You are highly interested if its role in intercellular communication is conserved among the eukaryotes. You treat yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with the peptide and interestingly observe the formation of the shmoo. You want to learn about the proteome of the active chromatin in the shmoo and recover it by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. The least of proteins from which complex below will you observe in your assay?', choice1='pre-initiation complex', choice2='pre-replication complex', choice3='enhancer protein complex', choice4='nucleosome histone complex', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_2_151
proposed answer: The selected protein complex that is expected to yield the fewest proteins in the context of the shmoo-forming yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is the pre-replication complex. This is because the pre-replication complex is associated with DNA replication, which is not relevant during the G1 phase when the yeast is forming shmoos. In contrast, the pre-initiation complex and enhancer protein complex are more directly involved in transcription, and the nucleosome histone complex is a structural component of chromatin. Therefore, the pre-replication complex is the least likely to be observed in the chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry assay focused on active chromatin during this phase.
