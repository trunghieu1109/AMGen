Parallax is inversely related to distance (d) as p = 1/d. Therefore, we can express the number of stars in terms of distance. Substituting p with 1/d gives us N(d) ∝ 1/(1/d)^5 = d^5.

Since parallax p is inversely proportional to distance r (p ∝ 1/r), we can express N in terms of r. Substituting p with k/r (where k is a constant), we get N(r) ∝ 1/(k/r)^5 = (r^5)/k^5. Next, we differentiate p with respect to r to find dp/dr: dp/dr = -k/r^2, thus |dp/dr| = k/r^2. Now, substituting into N(r) = N(p(r)) × |dp/dr| gives us N(r) ∝ (r^5) × (k/r^2) = k' r^3, where k' is a constant.

The relationship between parallax and distance is given by the formula p ∝ 1/r, where r is the distance to the star. This means that as the distance (r) increases, the parallax (p) decreases. Therefore, if we consider the inverse relationship, we can say that the parallax is inversely proportional to the distance.; answer: A\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent RNoE, identifying p ∝ 1/r, thinking: Parallax (p) is defined as the apparent shift in position of an object when observed from two different points.

We know that p ∝ 1/r, which means p = k/r for some constant k. Therefore, we can express N in terms of r: N(r) ∝ 1/(k/r)^5 = (r^5)/k^5. Now, we need to find dp/dr. Since p = k/r, we differentiate this with respect to r: dp/dr = -k/r^2. The absolute value is |dp/dr| = k/r^2. Now, we can express N(r) as N(r) = N(p(r)) × |dp/dr|. Substituting N(p(r)) and |dp/dr| gives us N(r) ∝ (r^5) × (k/r^2) = k' r^3, where k' is a constant.
