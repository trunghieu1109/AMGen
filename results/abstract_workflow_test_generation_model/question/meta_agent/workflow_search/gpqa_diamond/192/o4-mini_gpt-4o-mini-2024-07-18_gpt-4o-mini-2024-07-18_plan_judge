Question: Example(question='In a specific region of the sky, astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?', choice1='~ r^2', choice2='~ r^4', choice3='~ r^3', choice4='~ r^5', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_1_192
proposed answer: The analysis of the relationship N(r) ‚àù r^3 indicates that the number of stars in the region of the sky increases with the cube of the distance. This is consistent with the physical understanding of how volume increases with the cube of the radius in three-dimensional space. Among the provided choices, the only one that corresponds to this relationship is choice C) ~ r^3. Therefore, the correct answer is C.

Answer:C
Extracted answer: C
Correct answer: 3
