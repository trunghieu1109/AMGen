Question: Example(question='In a specific region of the sky, astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?', choice1='~ r^2', choice2='~ r^4', choice3='~ r^3', choice4='~ r^5', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: In the previous analysis, we established that the number of stars N varies with distance r as N ~ r^5. This relationship indicates that the number of stars increases significantly with distance, following a fifth power relationship. Among the provided choices, only choice D) ~ r^5 directly matches this derived expression. The other options (A, B, and C) do not reflect this relationship, confirming that D is the correct answer. Therefore, the final decision is that the number of stars in that region of the sky changes with distance according to the relationship N ~ r^5.

proposed answer: The derived relationship indicates that the number of stars N(r) is proportional to 1/plx^5. Since parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance (r), we can express this as plx ~ 1/r. Substituting this into the expression for N(r), we find that N(r) ~ 1/(1/r)^5 = r^5. This means that the number of stars increases with distance as r^5. Among the provided choices, D) ~ r^5 is the only option that accurately reflects this derived relationship, indicating that as distance increases, the number of stars also increases significantly. Therefore, I conclude that the correct relationship is represented by D).
