Question: Example(question='Identify the possible product when (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene undergoes Cope rearrangement.', choice1='4,4a,7,7a-tetrahydro-1H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine', choice2='4,4a,5,7a-tetrahydro-3H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine', choice3='4,6,7,7a-tetrahydro-3H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine', choice4='4,4a,5,6-tetrahydro-1H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_48_185
proposed answer: The selected product from the Cope rearrangement of (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene is 4,4a,5,6-tetrahydro-1H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine. This matches with choice4, which is the only option that describes a product with the correct IUPAC name and stereochemical descriptors. The other choices do not correspond to the expected product from the rearrangement, as they either have incorrect hydrogenation patterns or do not maintain the necessary bicyclic structure. Therefore, the correct match is choice D.

Answer:D
Extracted answer: D
Correct answer: 1
