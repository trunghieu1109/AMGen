proposed answer: The computed area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2 is infinite, which is consistent with the properties of hyperbolic geometry. Among the provided choices, the only option that represents an infinite area is choice 1, which states '+\infty'. The other choices represent finite or zero areas, which do not apply to the pseudosphere. Therefore, the correct answer is choice A, as it accurately reflects the infinite area of the pseudosphere.

proposed answer: The area of the pseudosphere with radius r=2 has been determined to be infinite due to the properties of the metric provided. As we approach the boundary defined by '4 - x^2 - y^2 = 0', the metric diverges, indicating that the area is unbounded. Among the provided choices, the only one that accurately reflects this conclusion is choice A) +âˆž. The other options suggest finite areas or expressions that do not correspond to the characteristics of a pseudosphere, which is known for its infinite area due to negative curvature. Therefore, the correct answer is A.
