After performing the r-integration, we find that the integral evaluates to a finite value. The outer integral with respect to θ simply contributes a factor of 2π.

The integrand (32 r)/(4−r²) can be simplified by performing the substitution u = 4 - r², which gives du = -2r dr, or dr = -du/(2r). The limits change accordingly: when r = 0, u = 4; when r = 2, u = 0. This transforms the inner integral into ∫ (32 / u) (-1/2) du from 4 to 0, which evaluates to 16 ln(u) evaluated from 4 to 0. The outer integral with respect to θ will simply contribute a factor of 2π. After evaluating the inner integral, we find that the total area is finite and corresponds to one of the choices given. Thus, the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2 is not infinite, and it matches one of the provided choices.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent Z0Cp:\nTo evaluate the integral A=∫₀^{2π}∫₀^{2} (32 r)/(4−r²) dr dθ, we first perform the inner integral with respect to r.

The determinant of the metric tensor g_ij, which in this case is a 2x2 matrix, can be computed as det(g_ij) = f(x,y)². Therefore, the square root of the determinant is √det(g_ij) = f(x,y). The infinitesimal area element dA is then given by dA = √det(g_ij) dx dy = f(x,y) dx dy, which confirms that dA = (32/(4 - x² - y²)) dx dy.

The determinant of the metric tensor g_ij, which is proportional to the conformal factor, gives us √det(g_ij) = f(x,y). Therefore, the infinitesimal area element dA can be expressed as dA = √det(g_ij) dx dy = f(x,y) dx dy.

The area element in polar coordinates is given by dA = f(r) r dr dθ, where f(r) is the conformal factor expressed in terms of r. The conformal factor is f(r) = 32/(4 - r²). The region we are integrating over is defined by the constraint x² + y² < 4, which translates to r² < 4 in polar coordinates, or r < 2. Therefore, the limits for r are from 0 to 2, and for θ, they are from 0 to 2π. Thus, the total area integral can be set up as A = ∫_{0}^{2π} ∫_{0}^{2} f(r) r dr dθ, with the specified limits for r and θ.
