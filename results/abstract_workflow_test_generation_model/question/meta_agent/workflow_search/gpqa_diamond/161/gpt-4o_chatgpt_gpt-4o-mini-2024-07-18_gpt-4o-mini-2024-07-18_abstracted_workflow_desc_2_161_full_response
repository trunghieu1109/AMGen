The implications for calculating areas on such surfaces are significant because the area can diverge or be finite depending on the curvature and the radius. In this case, the metric suggests that as we approach the boundary defined by the condition '4 - x^2 - y^2 = 0', the area can become infinite.

The implications for calculating areas on such surfaces are significant because the area can diverge or be finite depending on the curvature and the radius. In this case, the metric suggests that as we approach the boundary defined by the condition '4 - x^2 - y^2 = 0', the area can become infinite.
