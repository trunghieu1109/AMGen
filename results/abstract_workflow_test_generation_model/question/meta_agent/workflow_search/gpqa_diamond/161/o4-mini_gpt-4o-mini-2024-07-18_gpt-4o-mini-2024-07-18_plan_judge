proposed answer: After evaluating the integral A = ∫₀^{2π}∫₀^{2} (32 r)/(4−r²) dr dθ, we find that the inner integral diverges. Specifically, the substitution leads to an evaluation that results in a logarithmic divergence as we approach the limit. Therefore, the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2 is infinite. This matches the first choice given in the options, which is +∞.
