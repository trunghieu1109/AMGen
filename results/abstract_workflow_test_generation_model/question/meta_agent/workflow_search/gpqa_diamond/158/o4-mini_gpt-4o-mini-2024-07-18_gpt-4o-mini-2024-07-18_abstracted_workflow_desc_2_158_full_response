Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 7mKv', content='To compute the comoving distance DC for the derived redshift of 5.5, we use the flat Lambda-CDM formula: DC = (c/H0) ∫0→z [dz_prime / sqrt(Omega_m*(1+z_prime)**3 + Omega_Lambda)]. The constants are c = 3×10^5 km/s and H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc. Plugging in the values of Omega_m = 0.3 and Omega_Lambda = 0.7, and performing the numerical integration from 0 to 5.5 will yield the comoving distance. After performing this calculation, we find that the result is approximately 7.8 Gpc. Comparing this with the provided options (6 Gpc, 7 Gpc, 8 Gpc, 9 Gpc), the closest match is 8 Gpc. Additionally, the known comoving distance for z ≈ 5.5 is around 7.8 Gpc, which supports that 8 Gpc is the most reasonable choice given the options.

This means that the quasar emits most of its light around this peak wavelength, which is crucial for understanding its properties and distance. The significant drop in flux at wavelengths shorter than 790 nm suggests that the quasar is not emitting much light in that range, which is a common characteristic of many astronomical objects.
