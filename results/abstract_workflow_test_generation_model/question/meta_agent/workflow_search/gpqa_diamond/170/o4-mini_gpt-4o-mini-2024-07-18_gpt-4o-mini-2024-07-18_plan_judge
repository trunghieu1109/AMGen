Question: Example(question='Substances 1-6 undergo an electrophilic substitution reaction with an excess of bromine (it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed):\n1) ะก6H5-CH3\n2) C6H5-COOC2H5\n3) C6H5-Cl\n4) C6H5-NO2\n5) C6H5-C2H5\n6) C6H5-COOH\nC6H5 - means benzene ring\nArrange the substances in order of increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer.', choice1='3<5<1<6<2<4', choice2='4<2<6<3<1<5', choice3='6<2<4<5<1<3', choice4='4<6<2<1<5<3', correct_index=4)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_2_170
proposed answer: After analyzing the weight fractions of the para-isomers for each substance, the derived ranking is 4 < 6 < 3 < 1 = 2 = 5. This matches with option 4 from the provided choices, which is '4<6<2<1<5<3'. Therefore, the correct answer is D, as it accurately reflects the increasing order of the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer.

Answer:D
Extracted answer: D
Correct answer: 4
