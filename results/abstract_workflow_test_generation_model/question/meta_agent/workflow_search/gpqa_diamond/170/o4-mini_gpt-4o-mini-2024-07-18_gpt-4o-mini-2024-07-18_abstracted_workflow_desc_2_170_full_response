For electron-donating groups (EDGs) like CH3, COOC2H5, and C2H5, they will favor the ortho and para positions significantly over the meta position. Therefore, we can expect a high ratio of ortho and para products compared to meta. For the chloro substituent (Cl), which is an EWG but ortho/para directing, we can also expect a significant amount of ortho and para products, but less than the EDGs. For the nitro (NO2) and carboxy (COOH) groups, which are strong EWGs, they will direct to the meta position, and we can expect a very low yield of ortho and para products. Thus, the estimated distributions would be: 1) CH3: 1:0:3 (high para), 2) COOC2H5: 1:0:3 (high para), 3) Cl: 1:0:1 (equal ortho and para), 4) NO2: 0:3:0 (all meta), 5) C2H5: 1:0:3 (high para), 6) COOH: 0:3:0 (all meta).

The ratios indicate the relative amounts of ortho, meta, and para products formed. For example, a distribution of 1:0:3 means that for every 4 total products, 3 are para, which gives a weight fraction of para = 3/4 = 0.75. Similarly, for 1:0:1, the weight fraction of para is 1/2 = 0.5. For 0:3:0, the weight fraction of para is 0/3 = 0.

Substituents can be either electron-donating or electron-withdrawing.

The ratios indicate the relative amounts of ortho, meta, and para products formed. For example, a distribution of 1:0:3 means that for every 4 total products, 3 are para, which gives a weight fraction of para = 3/4 = 0.75. Similarly, for 1:0:1, the weight fraction of para is 1/2 = 0.5. For 0:3:0, the weight fraction of para is 0/3 = 0.
