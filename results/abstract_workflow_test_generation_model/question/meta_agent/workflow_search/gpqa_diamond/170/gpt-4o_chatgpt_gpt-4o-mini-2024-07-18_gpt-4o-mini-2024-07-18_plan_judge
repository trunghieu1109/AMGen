proposed answer: After analyzing the evaluations from subtask 3, it is clear that the order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer is influenced by the nature of the substituents on the benzene ring. The nitro group (4) is the most deactivating and directs to meta, leading to the lowest yield of para-isomer. The ethoxycarbonyl group (2) is also deactivating but has a slightly better yield than nitro. The carboxylic acid (6) is similarly deactivating, but less so than both nitro and ethoxycarbonyl. The chloro group (3) is deactivating but directs to ortho/para, resulting in a moderate yield. The methyl (1) and ethyl (5) groups are activating and direct to ortho/para, leading to the highest yields of para-isomer. Therefore, the final arrangement based on increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer is: 4 < 2 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5, which corresponds to choice 2: 4<2<6<3<1<5.

proposed answer: After analyzing the effects of the substituents on the benzene ring in terms of their directing effects and electronic nature, it is clear that the nitro (4) and carboxylic acid (6) groups are strongly deactivating and direct meta, leading to no para-isomer formation. The chloro group (3) is deactivating and directs to ortho/para, but sterics may slightly favor ortho, making para less favored. The ethoxy group (2) is weakly activating and directs to ortho/para, allowing for likely para formation. The methyl (1) and ethyl (5) groups are activating and direct to ortho/para, with para being more favored due to lower steric hindrance. Therefore, the order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer is: 4 (NO2) and 6 (COOH) have the least, followed by 3 (Cl), then 2 (COOC2H5), 1 (CH3), and finally 5 (C2H5) which has the highest likelihood of para-isomer formation. This leads to the final order: 4 < 6 < 3 < 2 < 1 < 5.

proposed answer: After analyzing the evaluations from subtask 3 and considering the directing effects of the substituents on the electrophilic substitution reaction, the order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer is determined. The nitro group (C6H5-NO2) is the least likely to form para-isomers due to its strong deactivating and meta-directing nature. The ethoxycarbonyl group (C6H5-COOC2H5) and carboxylic acid group (C6H5-COOH) are also deactivating but less so than the nitro group. The chloro group (C6H5-Cl) is deactivating but allows for some para formation, ranking above the deactivating groups. Alkyl groups such as methyl (C6H5-CH3) and ethyl (C6H5-C2H5) are activating and direct electrophiles to the ortho and para positions, making them more favorable for para-isomer formation. Therefore, the final arrangement based on increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer is 4 (NO2) < 2 (COOC2H5) < 6 (COOH) < 3 (Cl) < 1 (CH3) < 5 (C2H5), which corresponds to choice 2.
