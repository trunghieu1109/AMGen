The normalization condition requires that the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the components equals 1. We compute the norm as follows: ||ψ|| = sqrt(|3i|² + |4|²) = sqrt((3i)(-3i) + 4²) = sqrt(9 + 16) = sqrt(25) = 5. Therefore, the normalization constant is 1/5.

The multiplication is as follows: \n\nσ_y |ψ⟩ = [[0, -i], [i, 0]] * [[3i/5], [4/5]] = [[0 * (3i/5) + (-i) * (4/5)], [i * (3i/5) + 0 * (4/5)]] = [[-4i/5], [-3/5]]. \n\nThus, the result of the matrix multiplication is the vector (-4i/5, -3/5)ᵀ, which gives the application of the spin operator along the y-direction to the normalized state.; answer: C)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent biy8, applying σ_y, thinking: To apply the operator σ_y to the normalized state |ψ⟩, we perform the matrix multiplication of σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]] with |ψ⟩ = (3i/5, 4/5)ᵀ. The multiplication is done as follows: σ_y|ψ⟩ = [[0, -i], [i, 0]] * [[3i/5], [4/5]]. This results in the first component being 0*(3i/5) + (-i)*(4/5) = -4i/5 and the second component being i*(3i/5) + 0*(4/5) = -3/5. Thus, σ_y|ψ⟩ = (-4i/5, -3/5)ᵀ.
