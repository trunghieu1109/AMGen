Question: Example(question='Astronomers are studying two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2. Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.', choice1='~ 0.4', choice2='~ 0.7', choice3='~ 0.6\n', choice4='~ 1.2', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_8_163
proposed answer: The computed mass ratio of system_1 to system_2 is approximately 1.2. This indicates that system_1 is 1.2 times more massive than system_2. Among the provided options, the closest match to this calculated ratio is ~1.2. The other options (~0.4, ~0.7, ~0.6) are significantly lower than 1.2, making them incorrect. Therefore, the correct choice is D, as it accurately reflects the computed mass ratio.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_8_163
proposed answer: After analyzing the mass ratio of system_1 to system_2, it has been determined that system_1 is approximately 0.6 times more massive than system_2. This conclusion is supported by multiple calculations and aligns with the provided choices. Among the options given (~0.4, ~0.7, ~0.6, ~1.2), the value ~0.6 is the closest to our calculated mass ratio. Therefore, the correct answer is C, as it accurately reflects the findings.
