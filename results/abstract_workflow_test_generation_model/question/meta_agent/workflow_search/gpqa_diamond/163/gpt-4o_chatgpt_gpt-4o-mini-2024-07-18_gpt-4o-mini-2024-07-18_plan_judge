Question: Example(question='Astronomers are studying two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2. Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.', choice1='~ 0.4', choice2='~ 0.7', choice3='~ 0.6\n', choice4='~ 1.2', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_37_163
proposed answer: After analyzing the mass ratio of the two binary star systems, it has been consistently determined that the total mass of system_1 is approximately 0.6 times that of system_2. This indicates that system_1 is less massive than system_2. The provided choices include one that accurately reflects this ratio, which is choice 3, '~ 0.6'. Therefore, the correct answer is C.

proposed answer: After analyzing the mass ratio of the two binary star systems, it is clear that system_1 has a mass that is approximately 0.6 times that of system_2. This indicates that system_1 is not more massive than system_2, but rather less massive. The question specifically asks for the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, which would be a value less than 1. The closest choice that reflects this relationship is ~ 0.6, corresponding to option C. Therefore, the correct answer is C.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_6_163
proposed answer: After analyzing the data from the two binary star systems, it has been determined that system_1 has a total mass that is approximately 0.6 times that of system_2. This indicates that system_1 is less massive than system_2, which means the question of by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2 is not applicable. The correct choice that reflects this finding is ~ 0.6, which corresponds to option C. Therefore, the final decision is that the correct answer is C.
