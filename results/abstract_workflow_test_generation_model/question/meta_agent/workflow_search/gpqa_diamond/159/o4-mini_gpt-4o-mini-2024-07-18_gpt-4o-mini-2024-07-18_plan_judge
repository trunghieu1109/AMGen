Question: Example(question='Consider an aperture, which shapes like a N-sided polygon. All the apothems are of the same length a. When a monochromatic light (of wavelength \\lambda), travelling along z-axis, falls vertically on this aperture, it creates a series of intensity maxima and minima in the far field region. What is the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large ? Assume that the related angles are small so that tan theta = theta approximation can be taken.', choice1='1.220 \\lambda /a ', choice2='0.610 \\lambda / a', choice3='0.500 \\lambda / a', choice4='0.506 \\lambda / a', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: After calculating the angular separation Delta theta using the formula Delta theta = 3.1839 * lambda / (2 * pi * a), we find that this expression simplifies to approximately 1.220 * lambda / a. This value corresponds directly to the first choice provided in the options. The other choices do not match this calculated value, confirming that the only valid option is A. Therefore, the correct answer is A.

proposed answer: The verified numerical value for Δθ has been calculated to be approximately 0.506 λ/a. When comparing this value to the provided choices, it matches exactly with choice 4, which is also 0.506 λ/a. The other choices do not correspond to this value, making choice 4 the only correct answer. Therefore, the correct answer is D.
