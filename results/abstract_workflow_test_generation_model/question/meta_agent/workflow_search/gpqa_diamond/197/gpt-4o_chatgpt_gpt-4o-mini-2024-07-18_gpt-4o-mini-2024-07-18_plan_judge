Question: Example(question='We have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate, where the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M and the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16. What will be the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species in the solution? ', choice1='16.9%', choice2='42.3%', choice3='25.6%', choice4='38.1%', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_8_197
proposed answer: After reviewing the calculations and the stability constants for the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes, it is clear that the concentration of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex [Co(SCN)2]2- is significant. The total concentration of cobalt species has been consistently calculated to be 42.3%. By dividing the concentration of the blue complex by the total concentration of cobalt species and multiplying by 100, we confirm that the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex among all cobalt-containing species is indeed 42.3%. This aligns with the previous calculations and is supported by the stability constants provided. Therefore, the final decision on the percentage calculation is that it is 42.3%.

proposed answer: After reviewing the calculations and the stability constants provided, it is clear that the concentration of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex can be accurately derived using the stability constant β2 = 40. The total concentration of cobalt species is 10^-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. By applying the appropriate equations and performing the calculations, the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex relative to the total cobalt concentration is found to be 16.9%. This aligns with the results from previous analyses and confirms that option A is indeed the correct choice.
