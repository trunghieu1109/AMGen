proposed answer: After analyzing the spectral data provided, it is clear that the compound in question is most likely 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 corresponds to the molecular weight of 4-chlorobenzoic acid, and the peak at m/z = 158 indicates the presence of chlorine, which is consistent with this structure. The IR spectrum shows a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1, indicative of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group, and a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1, which corresponds to the carbonyl (C=O) stretch of the carboxylic acid. The 1H NMR data supports this identification as well, with a singlet at 11.0 ppm for the carboxylic acid proton and doublets at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm for the aromatic protons, which align with the expected substitution pattern for 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Other options do not match the molecular weight or the spectral characteristics as closely as 4-chlorobenzoic acid does. Therefore, the most reasonable match is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.

proposed answer: After analyzing the spectral data provided, it is clear that the proposed structure of 4-chlorobenzoic acid aligns perfectly with the mass spectrometry, IR, and NMR results. The molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 corresponds to the molecular weight of 4-chlorobenzoic acid, while the peak at m/z = 158 indicates the presence of chlorine, which is consistent with the structure. The IR spectrum shows a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1, indicative of an -OH group typical of carboxylic acids, and a strong peak at 1720 cm^-1 confirming the carbonyl group. The 1H NMR data reveals a singlet at 11.0 ppm for the acidic proton and two doublets at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm, suggesting a para-substituted aromatic ring, which is characteristic of 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Therefore, based on all the spectral evidence, 4-chlorobenzoic acid is the most reasonable structural suggestion among the given choices.
