Question: Example(question='In the lab, a chemist discovers an unnamed bottle with a white solid inside. He gathers the following spectral information in order to identify the liquid. Make a reasonable structural suggestion for the unidentified drug using the information provided.\nMass: molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 (100%)\na peak at m/z = 158 (32%)\nIR : broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1, strong sharp peak at 1720 cm-1\n1H NMR: 11.0 ppm (s, 1H), 8.02 ppm (d, 2H), 7.72 (d, 2H)', choice1='4-chlorobenzoic acid', choice2='2-chlorobenzoic acid', choice3='3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde\n', choice4='Phenyl chloroformate', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: Based on the provided spectral data, the molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 suggests a molecular weight of 156 g/mol, which is consistent with 4-chlorobenzoic acid (C7H5ClO2). The presence of a broad IR peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1 indicates the presence of an -OH group, which is characteristic of carboxylic acids. The strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 further supports the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O), typical for carboxylic acids. The 1H NMR data shows a singlet at 11.0 ppm, which corresponds to the -COOH proton, and the two doublets at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm correspond to the aromatic protons in a para-substituted benzene ring, which is consistent with 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Therefore, considering all the spectral evidence, 4-chlorobenzoic acid is the best structural match for the unidentified drug.
