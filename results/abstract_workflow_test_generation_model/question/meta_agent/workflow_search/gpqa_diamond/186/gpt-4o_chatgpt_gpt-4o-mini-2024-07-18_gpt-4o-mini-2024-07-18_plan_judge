Question: Example(question='How many of the stars listed below would be detectable using the ESPRESSO spectrograph, when it is coupled with one of the 8m VLT telescopes at the Paranal Observatory? A star is considered detectable if a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure is achieved.\n\nFor more details about the ESPRESSO spectrograph, please refer to the following link:\nhttps://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/instruments/espresso/overview.html\n\na) Canopus\nb) Polaris\nc) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 10 pc distance from us.\nd) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 200 pc distance from us.\ne) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 5 pc distance from us.\nf) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 50 pc distance from us.', choice1='4', choice2='3', choice3='2', choice4='5', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: To determine the number of detectable stars using the ESPRESSO spectrograph, we need to evaluate the apparent magnitudes of the stars based on their absolute magnitudes and distances. Canopus and Polaris are both bright stars with low apparent magnitudes, making them detectable. The star located at 5 pc has an absolute magnitude of 15, which results in a sufficiently low apparent magnitude to also be detectable. However, the stars located at 10 pc, 50 pc, and 200 pc have higher apparent magnitudes that exceed the threshold for detection, thus they are not detectable. Therefore, the total number of detectable stars is 3: Canopus, Polaris, and the star at 5 pc distance. This conclusion is consistent across multiple analyses, confirming that the correct answer is 3 detectable stars.
