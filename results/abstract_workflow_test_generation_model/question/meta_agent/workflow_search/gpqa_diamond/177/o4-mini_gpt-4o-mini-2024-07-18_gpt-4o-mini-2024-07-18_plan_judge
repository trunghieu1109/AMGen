proposed answer: The mass dimension of the coupling constant \kappa has been determined to be -1. In quantum field theory, for a theory to be renormalizable, all coupling constants must have nonnegative mass dimensions. Since \kappa has a negative mass dimension, it indicates that the theory is not renormalizable. Therefore, the correct choice that reflects both the mass dimension of \kappa and the renormalizability status of the theory is option C, which states that the mass dimension \left[\kappa\right]_{M}=-1 and that the theory is not renormalizable.
