Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Final Decision Agent yP98', content='To determine the renormalizability of the theory, we analyze the mass dimension of the coupling constant \\kappa in the interaction term \\mathcal{L}_{int}=\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}. The fermionic fields \\bar{\\psi} and \\psi$ each have a mass dimension of \\frac{3}{2}$, and the field strength tensor $F^{\\mu\\nu}$ has a mass dimension of 2. Therefore, the total mass dimension of the interaction term is \\kappa + 3 + 3 + 2 = \\kappa + 6.
