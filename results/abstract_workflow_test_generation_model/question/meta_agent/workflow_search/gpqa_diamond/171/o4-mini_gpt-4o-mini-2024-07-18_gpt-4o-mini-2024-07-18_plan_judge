Question: Example(question='Two stars are being studied. It has been observed that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2. In fact, the energy difference between the considered energy levels was determined to be approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J. Assuming that the stellar photospheres are in LTE, which of these equations for the effective temperatures of the stars (T_1 and T_2) is correct?', choice1='ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]\n', choice2='ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]\n', choice3='ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n', choice4='ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: The derived expression for ln(2) from the Boltzmann distribution and the given conditions shows that the correct relationship involves the difference in temperatures T1 and T2, normalized by the product of T1 and T2. Specifically, the form ln(2) = [ (T1 - T2) / (T1*T2)] matches the form of choice 4. This indicates that the effective temperatures of the two stars are related through their difference divided by the product of their temperatures, which is consistent with the principles of statistical mechanics.
