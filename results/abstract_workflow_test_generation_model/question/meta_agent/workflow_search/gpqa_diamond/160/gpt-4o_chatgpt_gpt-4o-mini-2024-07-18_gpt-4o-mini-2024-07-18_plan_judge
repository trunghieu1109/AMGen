Question: Example(question='While designing a high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating at an accelerating voltage of 1000 kV, Mike connected vacuum pumps to create an ultra-high vacuum state (< 10^-9 Torr) in the sample compartment, aiming to minimize the presence of gas molecules for improved electron microscopy. However, as expected, some gas particles remained inside the compartment, as detected by the mass spectrometer. Mike accurately determined the mean free path of these gas molecules in the vacuum state (< 10^-9 Torr) to be λ1, based on factors such as sample compartment volume, pressure, and temperature. However, upon initiating the electron beam, he made an intriguing observation concerning the mean free path based on electron scattering with the gas molecules. He found that the mean free path was no longer equal to λ1; rather, it was λ2, even though the sample compartment temperature remained the same.\n\nWhat can we conclude about λ2 based on the aforementioned scenario?', choice1="λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation", choice2='λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1', choice3='λ2 < λ1', choice4='λ2 >= 1.22*λ1', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: The introduction of the electron beam into the ultra-high vacuum environment leads to increased interactions between the electrons and the gas molecules. This results in more frequent scattering events, which effectively reduces the mean free path of the gas molecules. Since the temperature remains constant, the primary factor influencing the mean free path is the presence of the electron beam, which causes additional collisions. Therefore, we can conclude that λ2, the mean free path under the influence of the electron beam, is less than λ1, the mean free path in the absence of the beam. This conclusion is supported by the observations made by Mike and the understanding of gas behavior in the presence of an electron beam. Thus, the most plausible conclusion is that λ2 < λ1.

proposed answer: In the scenario described, the introduction of the electron beam increases the frequency of interactions between the electrons and the gas molecules. This leads to a greater number of scattering events, resulting in a reduced mean free path for the gas molecules when the electron beam is present. Therefore, since λ1 represents the mean free path without the influence of the electron beam and λ2 represents the mean free path with the electron beam, we can conclude that λ2 must be less than λ1. This aligns with the choice that states λ2 < λ1, which is choice C.
