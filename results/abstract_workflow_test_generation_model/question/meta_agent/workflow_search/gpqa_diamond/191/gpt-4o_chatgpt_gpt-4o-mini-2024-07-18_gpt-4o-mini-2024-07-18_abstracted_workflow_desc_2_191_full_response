Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Final Decision Agent uTJn', content='The electric field at point P outside the spherical conductor can be determined using the principle that the electric field due to a charge inside a conductor behaves as if the charge were concentrated at the center of the conductor. Since point P is located outside the conductor (where L > R), the electric field can be calculated using the formula for the electric field due to a point charge, which is E = (1 / (4 * π * ε₀)) * (q / L^2). This expression indicates that the electric field is inversely proportional to the square of the distance L from the center of the conductor.

According to Gauss's law and the properties of conductors, the electric field outside the spherical conductor behaves as if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the conductor. Since the point P is located outside the conductor (at distance L), the electric field at this point is determined solely by the total charge on the outer surface, which is +q.

According to electrostatic principles, the electric field inside a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium is zero. Therefore, the electric field outside the conductor behaves as if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the conductor. For a point outside the conductor at distance L, the electric field due to the charge +q is given by the formula for the electric field of a point charge, E = k * q / r^2.
