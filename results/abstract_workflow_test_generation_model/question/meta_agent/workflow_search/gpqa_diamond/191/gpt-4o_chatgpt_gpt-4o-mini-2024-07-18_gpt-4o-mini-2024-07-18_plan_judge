Question: Example(question='Imagine an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ having a small spherical cavity inside. The centre of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the centre of the spherical conductor. The radius of the cavity is $r$, and $r<R$. Now consider a small amount of positive charge $+q$ is somehow placed somewhere inside the cavity. What is the magnitude of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at a point P (outside the spherical conductor) of distance $L$ from the centre of the spherical conductor? Note, the distance of the point P from the centre of the cavity is $l$. Here, l, L > R. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\\theta$\n', choice1='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n', choice2='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n', choice3='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\n', choice4='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: The electric field at point P outside the spherical conductor can be determined using the principle that the electric field due to a charge inside a conductor behaves as if the charge were concentrated at the center of the conductor. Since point P is located outside the conductor (where L > R), the electric field can be calculated using the formula for the electric field due to a point charge, which is E = (1 / (4 * π * ε₀)) * (q / L^2). This expression indicates that the electric field is inversely proportional to the square of the distance L from the center of the conductor. The angle θ does not affect this calculation because the electric field is radial. Therefore, the correct answer is D, which corresponds to the expression E = (1 / (4 * π * ε₀)) * (q / L^2).
