proposed answer: After reviewing the calculations and the provided choices, it is clear that the calculated relative entropy measure del_b for the non-Gaussian state is approximately 1.38. This value is significant as it quantifies the non-Gaussianity of the state. Among the provided choices, 1.38 is explicitly listed as choice C. Therefore, I conclude that choice C is the correct answer as it directly matches the calculated result for the non-Gaussianity of the Schrödinger cat state.

proposed answer: After evaluating the calculations for the relative entropy measure del_b using the specified parameters phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5, the computed value is 1.38. This value indicates a significant amount of non-Gaussianity in the Schrödinger cat state, which is consistent with theoretical expectations. Among the provided choices, 1.38 is the only value that matches the calculated result, making it the correct answer. The other options do not reflect the expected level of non-Gaussianity for the given parameters, confirming that choice C is the most reasonable and accurate answer.
