Question: Example(question='There has been an outbreak of an viral infectious disease in your city. You have been asked to design a molecular diagnostic kit for quick detection of this retrovirus. How would you go about designing this kit?', choice1='First you identify the virus by performing DNA sequencing. You then develop a PCR kit for  quick and accurate diagnosis', choice2='First you identify the IgG antibodies for the infection. You then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG antibodies for quick \n and accurate diagnosis.', choice3='First you identify the virus using the information about the symptoms, provided by the affected patients. You then design a nested PCR kit based on the information for quick diagnosis.', choice4='First you identify the virus by performing cDNA sequencing.  You then develop a real time PCR kit for quick and accurate diagnosis.', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: The decision to deploy the validated real-time PCR kit is based on its ability to provide rapid and accurate diagnosis of the viral infection. This is crucial in outbreak situations where timely identification of infected individuals can significantly impact public health measures and treatment protocols. The real-time PCR technology allows for quick turnaround times, enabling healthcare professionals to make informed decisions regarding patient management and containment strategies. Furthermore, the validation of the kit ensures reliability and accuracy, minimizing the risk of misdiagnosis. Overall, deploying this kit will enhance the response to the outbreak, facilitate effective monitoring, and ultimately help in controlling the spread of the virus.
