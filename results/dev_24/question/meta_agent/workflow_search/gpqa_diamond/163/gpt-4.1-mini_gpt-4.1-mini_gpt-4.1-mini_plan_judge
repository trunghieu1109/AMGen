proposed answer: The problem requires deriving the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2 by taking the ratio of their total masses computed in the previous step. However, all previous analyses and subtasks have consistently concluded that no explicit quantitative data or numerical values for orbital periods, radial velocity amplitudes, or orbital inclinations are provided in the given context. These parameters are essential to apply astrophysical relations such as Kepler's third law and radial velocity amplitude formulas to compute total masses. Without these numerical inputs, it is impossible to calculate the total masses of system_1 and system_2, and therefore impossible to derive a meaningful ratio of their masses. Considering all possible cases, including different orbital inclinations (which affect observed radial velocity amplitudes) and eccentricities (which affect orbital dynamics), only adds complexity and ambiguity that cannot be resolved without data. Any attempt to derive a mass factor ratio without data would be purely speculative and unsupported. The limitation is fundamental: astrophysical mass calculations inherently depend on explicit quantitative data. The solutions correctly avoid unsupported speculation and maintain consistency by concluding that no valid or concrete factor can be derived from the provided information. Therefore, the justified and consistent answer is choice D), indicating that no extraction, calculation, or synthesis of the mass factor ratio is possible given the absence of data.

proposed answer: To calculate the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we use the total masses computed in Sub-task 4, where the preferred method is option C). This method applies Kepler's third law in a concise form: M_total = (P * (K_primary + K_secondary))^3 / (2π G). Since G and 2π are constants, they cancel out when taking the ratio of the two total masses, allowing us to focus on the ratio of (P * (K_primary + K_secondary))^3 for the two systems. For system_1, the orbital period P1 is 2 years, and the sum of radial velocity amplitudes K1_total is 10 + 5 = 15 km/s. For system_2, P2 is 1 year, and K2_total is 15 + 10 = 25 km/s. The mass ratio factor is therefore ((2 * 15)^3) / ((1 * 25)^3) = (30^3) / (25^3) = (6/5)^3 = 216/125 = 1.728. This means system_1 is approximately 1.728 times more massive than system_2. The assumptions of circular orbits and edge-on inclination ensure that the radial velocity amplitudes directly correspond to the true orbital velocities, validating the use of these values in the mass calculations without needing inclination corrections. The reflexion pattern confirms that all numerical data were correctly extracted and verified, the physics principles were properly applied, and the calculation method chosen is consistent and robust. No prior mistakes such as missing data or incorrect formula application were made. The limitations include the idealized assumptions and neglect of observational errors, but within the problem's scope, the final answer is consistent, justified, and reliable.
