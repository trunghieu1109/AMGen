Question: Example(question='In a specific region of the sky, astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?', choice1='~ r^2', choice2='~ r^4', choice3='~ r^3', choice4='~ r^5', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Test New Architecture_192
proposed answer: Starting from the given relation N(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5, where N(plx) is the number of stars per unit parallax interval and plx is the parallax, we want to find the number of stars per unit distance interval, N(r), where r = 1/plx. Rewriting N(plx) in terms of r gives N(plx) ∝ r^5. However, since N(plx) is per unit parallax interval, to convert to per unit distance interval, we apply the change of variables formula: N(r) = N(plx) * |d(plx)/d(r)|. Given plx = 1/r, the derivative d(plx)/d(r) = -1/r^2, and its absolute value is 1/r^2. Substituting, we get N(r) ∝ r^5 * (1/r^2) = r^3. This cubic dependence on r is physically meaningful because the number of stars in a spherical shell at distance r scales with the volume of that shell, proportional to r^2 * dr, and thus the number per unit distance interval scales as r^3. Considering limits, as r approaches zero, N(r) approaches zero, consistent with the small volume near the observer and fewer stars. As r approaches infinity, N(r) grows without bound, reflecting the increasing volume and number of stars at larger distances. Other options (~ r^2, ~ r^4, ~ r^5) do not correctly account for the change of variables and physical volume scaling. Therefore, the correct simplified dependence of the number of stars per unit distance interval on r is N(r) ∝ r^3, corresponding to option C).
