proposed answer: The predicted order of increasing para-isomer yield is NO2 < COOH < COOC2H5 < Cl < C2H5 < CH3. This order is derived from a comprehensive analysis of electronic effects and steric factors influencing electrophilic bromination of substituted benzenes. Electron-withdrawing groups like NO2, COOH, and COOC2H5 deactivate the ring and direct substitution meta, resulting in very low para-isomer yields. Among these, NO2 is the strongest deactivator and thus has the lowest para yield, followed by COOH and then COOC2H5. Chlorine, although overall deactivating, is an ortho/para director due to resonance donation, leading to moderate para yield. Methyl and ethyl groups are electron-donating and strongly ortho/para directing, resulting in the highest para yields, with methyl slightly higher than ethyl due to smaller steric hindrance. This ranking is consistent with classical aromatic substitution theory, resonance and induction effects, and steric considerations. Limitations include potential influences of solvent, temperature, and reaction conditions, which can affect regioselectivity and yields, as well as possible variations in steric effects depending on the environment. Despite these, the predicted order aligns well with experimental data and theoretical expectations. Comparing this order to the multiple-choice options, only option A) matches this exact sequence, making it the correct choice. This selection is justified as it fully integrates electronic and steric factors and is supported by both theory and experiment, providing the most accurate and reliable ranking of para-isomer yields for the given substituents.

proposed answer: The final validated order from Sub-task 4 and confirmed in Sub-task 5 is NO2 ≈ COOH < COOC2H5 < Cl < CH3 < C2H5 by increasing weight fraction of para-isomer yield. This order is based on well-established aromatic substitution principles: strong electron-withdrawing groups like NO2 and COOH are meta directors and strongly deactivate the ring, resulting in the lowest para yields. The ester group COOC2H5 is also meta directing but less strongly deactivating, so it has a slightly higher para yield. Chlorine, being ortho/para directing but deactivating overall, comes next. Methyl (CH3) and ethyl (C2H5) groups are electron-donating and activating, with ethyl being slightly more activating and heavier, thus having the highest para yield. This ranking aligns with experimental data and chemical intuition. Among the multiple-choice options, only option A) matches this order exactly. Therefore, option A) is the correct choice.
