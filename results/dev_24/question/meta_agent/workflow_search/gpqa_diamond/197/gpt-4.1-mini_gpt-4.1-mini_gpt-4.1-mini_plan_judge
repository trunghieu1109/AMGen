Question: Example(question='We have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate, where the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M and the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16. What will be the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species in the solution? ', choice1='16.9%', choice2='42.3%', choice3='25.6%', choice4='38.1%', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: To calculate the concentration of the dithiocyanato complex Co(SCN)2, we first need the free Co(II) concentration, [Co2+], which can be obtained from the mass balance equation derived in Sub-task 2: [Co2+] = Co_total / (1 + Σ_{n=1}^4 β_n * [SCN-]^n). Once [Co2+] is known, the concentration of Co(SCN)2 is given by [Co(SCN)2] = β_2 * [Co2+] * [SCN-]^2, where β_2 is the cumulative stability constant for the dithiocyanato complex. To find the percentage of Co(SCN)2 relative to total cobalt, we compute ( [Co(SCN)2] / Co_total ) * 100%. However, the free SCN- concentration, [SCN-], is not directly known and must be determined from the SCN- mass balance equation: SCN_total = [SCN-] + [Co2+] * Σ_{n=1}^4 n * β_n * [SCN-]^n. This is a nonlinear equation in [SCN-] and generally requires numerical methods to solve. Considering all cases: at low SCN- concentration, free Co(II) dominates and Co(SCN)2 concentration is negligible; at intermediate SCN-, mono- and bis-complexes form and Co(SCN)2 concentration increases; at high SCN-, higher order complexes dominate, potentially reducing the relative percentage of Co(SCN)2. Therefore, the calculation involves first numerically solving for [SCN-], then computing [Co2+], then [Co(SCN)2], and finally its percentage relative to total cobalt. This stepwise approach ensures accurate determination of the dithiocyanato complex concentration under varying conditions.
