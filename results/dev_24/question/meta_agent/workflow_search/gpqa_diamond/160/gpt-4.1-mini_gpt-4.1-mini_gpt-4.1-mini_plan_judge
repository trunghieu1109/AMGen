proposed answer: The relationship between λ2 and λ1 is fundamentally based on the physical principle that the presence of an electron beam increases the collision frequency of gas molecules, thereby reducing the effective mean free path. The factor 1.22 is an empirically and theoretically justified adjustment that accounts for this increased scattering. Starting from the initial mean free path λ1, the effective mean free path λ2 is reduced by this factor, leading to the equation λ2 = λ1 / 1.22. This means λ2 is strictly less than λ1, reflecting the increased collision rate due to electron-gas molecule interactions. Considering all possible cases: in high vacuum conditions, the gas density is low, so the difference between λ1 and λ2 is minimal but still present; in lower vacuum (higher pressure), the difference becomes more significant. Temperature and accelerating voltage influence collision dynamics but do not negate the factor 1.22's applicability. The relationship is a strict equality describing the quantitative relationship between λ2 and λ1, not merely an inequality. Limitations include assumptions of constant environmental conditions, uniform gas composition, and linearity, which may not hold in extreme or highly variable experimental setups. However, for typical laboratory conditions, this relationship is robust and practical. Therefore, the correct and most consistent description is λ2 = λ1 / 1.22, which implies λ2 < λ1.

proposed answer: The mean free path λ is inversely proportional to the scattering cross section σ, i.e., λ = 1/(nσ), where n is the number density of scatterers. Given that the molecular scattering cross section σ_m is approximately 1.22 times larger than the electron scattering cross section σ_e (σ_m = 1.22 × σ_e), it follows that λ1 = 1/(nσ_m) and λ2 = 1/(nσ_e). Substituting σ_m, we get λ1 = 1/(n × 1.22 × σ_e) = λ2 / 1.22, which implies λ2 = 1.22 × λ1. This means the electron mean free path λ2 is greater than the molecular mean free path λ1 by a factor of about 1.22. The multiple-choice options must reflect this inequality λ2 > λ1. Selecting an answer that contradicts this (e.g., λ2 < λ1) would be logically inconsistent and physically incorrect. It is crucial to verify that the chosen answer aligns with the derived relationship to avoid errors. Considering all possible cases, including variations in pressure, temperature, and electron energy, the fundamental inverse proportionality between mean free path and scattering cross section remains valid, reinforcing the conclusion λ2 > λ1. Although electron energy can influence σ_e and thus λ2, the factor 1.22 is a typical value under standard conditions, and deviations do not invalidate the inequality direction. Therefore, the correct choice is A). This final verification step ensures consistency between the derived quantitative relationship and the selected answer, preventing logical inconsistencies and ensuring accurate physical interpretation.
