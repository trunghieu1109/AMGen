proposed answer: The problem involves a neutral, isolated spherical conductor with an internal cavity containing a charge +q. Electrostatic principles require that the electric field inside the conductor's material is zero, which leads to induced charges on the cavity surface (-q) and on the outer surface (+q) to maintain overall neutrality. The observation point P is outside the conductor, so the electric field there is influenced only by the induced charges on the outer surface, as the conductor shields the interior charge from the outside. Key parameters are l (distance from +q to cavity boundary), L (distance from conductor's center to P), s (displacement vector of the charge from conductor's center), and θ (angle between s and vector from conductor's center to P). When the cavity and charge are concentric (s=0), the induced charge on the outer surface behaves like a point charge +q at the center, and the electric field at P follows Coulomb's law, inversely proportional to L squared, directed radially outward. For off-center cases (s ≠ 0), the induced charge distribution becomes more complex, describable by multipole expansions or image charges, introducing angular dependence on θ and corrections beyond the monopole term. However, at large distances, the monopole term dominates, equivalent to a point charge +q at the center. Distances l and L influence induced charge distribution and multipole contributions but not the leading monopole field. The conductor's shielding ensures zero field inside its material and that the external field depends solely on induced charges on the outer surface. Grounded conductors differ, but here the isolated neutral conductor is considered. Options neglecting induced charges, shielding, or angular dependencies are less accurate or incomplete. Therefore, the correct electric field expression at P is option C), which accounts for the monopole term and multipole corrections, consistent with electrostatics, charge neutrality, and shielding effects.

proposed answer: The problem involves a neutral, isolated spherical conductor with an internal cavity containing a point charge q. According to electrostatics principles, the conductor rearranges its free charges to shield the internal charge, ensuring the electric field inside the conductor's material is zero. The induced charges on the conductor's outer surface sum to +q, effectively making the conductor behave externally as if a point charge +q is located at its center O. This is a direct consequence of the uniqueness theorem, which states that the potential outside a conductor is uniquely determined by the total enclosed charge and boundary conditions, independent of the internal charge distribution details. The vectors L (from conductor center O to cavity center O') and l (from cavity center O' to charge q) describe internal geometry but do not affect the external field. The observation point P is at vector s from O, with magnitude s = |OP|. The electric field magnitude at P outside the conductor is given by Coulomb's law for a point charge +q at O: E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q / s²). This formula holds for all cases: concentric cavity (L=0), off-center cavity (L≠0), charge at cavity center (l=0), charge off-center (l>0), and any observation point outside the conductor. The numeric sanity check confirms the field decreases as 1/s², consistent with Coulomb's law. Therefore, integrating all prior analyses and fundamental electrostatics, the correct formula for the magnitude of the electric field at point P is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q / s²), where s is the distance from the conductor center to P. This formula respects the shielding principle, the uniqueness theorem, and verified distance variable s, ensuring consistency with all possible cases.
