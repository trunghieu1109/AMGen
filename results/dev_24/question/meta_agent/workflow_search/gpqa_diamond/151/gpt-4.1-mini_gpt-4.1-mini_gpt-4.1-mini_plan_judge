Question: Example(question='You identified a new quorum-sensing peptide in the bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus. You are highly interested if its role in intercellular communication is conserved among the eukaryotes. You treat yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with the peptide and interestingly observe the formation of the shmoo. You want to learn about the proteome of the active chromatin in the shmoo and recover it by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. The least of proteins from which complex below will you observe in your assay?', choice1='pre-initiation complex', choice2='pre-replication complex', choice3='enhancer protein complex', choice4='nucleosome histone complex', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Test New Architecture_151
proposed answer: The assay in question is a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay targeting active chromatin regions during shmoo formation, a process involving transcriptional activation of mating genes. The protein complexes considered are the pre-initiation complex (PIC), enhancer protein complex, nucleosome histone complex, and pre-replication complex (pre-RC). The PIC is essential for initiating transcription at gene promoters, making it highly relevant and likely enriched in active chromatin during shmoo formation. Enhancer protein complexes bind to distal regulatory elements to facilitate transcription, also making them likely to be observed in the assay. Nucleosome histone complexes are fundamental units of chromatin present throughout the genome, including active regions, and are thus commonly detected. In contrast, the pre-RC is involved in DNA replication origin licensing during the G1 phase and is not directly associated with transcriptional activation or chromatin remodeling during shmoo formation. Since shmoo formation is a transcription-driven morphological change, and the cell cycle may be arrested or altered, pre-RC components are less likely to be present or enriched in active chromatin regions targeted by ChIP assays. Therefore, considering the biological roles, temporal chromatin associations, and the nature of the assay, the pre-replication complex is the protein complex least observed in the assay.
