proposed answer: The Hamiltonian operator is given by H = epsilon * (sigma · n), where sigma are the Pauli matrices and n is a unit vector. From the algebraic properties of Pauli matrices, specifically (sigma · n)^2 = I, the eigenvalues of (sigma · n) are ±1. Multiplying by epsilon scales these eigenvalues to ±epsilon. Physically, the spin operator S is related to sigma by S = (hbar/2) * sigma, so the Hamiltonian can be expressed as H = (2 * epsilon / hbar) * (S · n). If epsilon already includes the factor hbar/2 (i.e., epsilon = (hbar/2) * omega), then the eigenvalues are ±epsilon. If epsilon does not include hbar/2, the eigenvalues would be ±(hbar/2) * omega, but since the problem defines the Hamiltonian as H = epsilon * (sigma · n) without further factors, epsilon is treated as the full scalar coefficient. Therefore, the eigenvalues are ±epsilon. All agents agree on this conclusion, and the multiple-choice option D) corresponds to these eigenvalues. This conclusion holds regardless of the specific values of epsilon or the direction of n, as long as n is a unit vector. Hence, the correct eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator are ±epsilon, matching option D).

proposed answer: The Hamiltonian is given by H = epsilon (sigma · n), where (sigma · n) has eigenvalues ±1. Since epsilon is defined to have units of energy and already includes the factor ħ/2 (as epsilon corresponds physically to (ħ/2) γ |B|), the eigenvalues of H are ±epsilon. We first parse the multiple-choice options explicitly: A: ±epsilon, B: ±epsilon ħ/2, C: ±1, D: ±ħ/2. Comparing the derived eigenvalues ±epsilon with the options, option A matches exactly. Option B incorrectly multiplies epsilon by ħ/2 again, which is redundant and dimensionally inconsistent. Options C and D do not include epsilon and thus do not represent the physical energy eigenvalues of H. Therefore, the correct choice is A. This reasoning holds universally for any unit vector n and any physical context where the Hamiltonian has the form H = epsilon (sigma · n), ensuring dimensional consistency and physical meaning.
