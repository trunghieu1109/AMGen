Question: Example(question='α-β unsaturated carbonyls have a much more electrophilic carbon double bond. These double bonds act as a good Lewis acid and react with nucleophiles to produce enolate ions. In this case, when a nucleophile attacks the β position, it produces a resonance-stabilized intermediate. When a nucleophile attacking the β-carbon is enolate, such reaction is known as the Michael reaction.\nWhat are the reactants and major final products of the following Michael addition reactions?\ndimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) -->(A)\n1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H3O+) --> (B)\nC + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H2O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice1='A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice2='A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice3='A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice4='A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: All analyses from previous subtasks and agents consistently conclude that the major products of the Michael addition reactions A, B, and C are the 1,4-addition adducts in their keto tautomeric forms. This is supported by fundamental organic chemistry principles: under basic conditions, the enolate ion formed from the nucleophile attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound, favoring 1,4-addition due to resonance stabilization and electronic factors. The resulting enolate intermediate is protonated to yield the Michael adduct, which tautomerizes to the more stable keto form. Side reactions such as 1,2-addition or polymerization are minimized under the reaction conditions. The stereochemical outcomes may vary but do not affect the major product identity. Comparing the derived products with the multiple-choice options shows that only option D correctly represents the reactants and the major final products for reactions A, B, and C, consistent with the mechanistic pathway and experimental conditions. Other options depict incorrect regioselectivity, tautomeric forms, or stereochemistry inconsistent with the established mechanism. Therefore, considering all possible cases and detailed mechanistic reasoning, option D is the correct and most accurate choice.
