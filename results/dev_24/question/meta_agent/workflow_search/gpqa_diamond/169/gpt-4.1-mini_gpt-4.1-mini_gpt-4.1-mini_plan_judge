Question: Example(question='An electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Find the expectation value of its spin along y-direction, S_y.\nNote: \\sigma_y (in latex format) is: \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & -i \\\\\ni & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}', choice1='-25*hbar/2\n\n', choice2='-12*hbar/25\n\n', choice3='12*hbar/25', choice4='25*hbar/2\n', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Test New Architecture_169
proposed answer: The expectation value <S_y> was calculated by first normalizing the spin state vector (3i, 4) to (3i/5, 4/5). The spin operator S_y for a spin-1/2 particle is given by (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrix σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Applying S_y to the normalized vector results in (-2iħ/5, -3ħ/10). The conjugate transpose of the normalized vector is (-3i/5, 4/5). The expectation value <S_y> is the inner product of the conjugate transpose of the normalized vector with the transformed vector: (-3i/5)*(-2iħ/5) + (4/5)*(-3ħ/10). Calculating each term: (-3i/5)*(-2iħ/5) = (6i^2 ħ)/25 = -6ħ/25 since i^2 = -1, and (4/5)*(-3ħ/10) = -6ħ/25. Summing these gives -12ħ/25, which is a real number, consistent with the physical requirement that expectation values of observables be real. Alternative answers suggesting zero were due to sign or conjugation errors. Multiple agents independently verified this calculation and agreed on the result. Therefore, the correct and physically consistent expectation value is -12ħ/25, corresponding to option B).
