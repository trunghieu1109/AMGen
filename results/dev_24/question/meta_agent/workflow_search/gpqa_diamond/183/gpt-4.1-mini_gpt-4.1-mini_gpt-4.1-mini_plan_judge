proposed answer: The optimal synthetic sequence to obtain 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene is to first introduce the ethoxy group, followed by the tert-butyl group, and finally the nitro group (sequence D). This conclusion is supported by a comprehensive analysis of directing effects, reactivity, and practical synthetic considerations, as well as consensus among multiple expert agents. Step-by-step justification: 1) Ethoxy group introduction first: The ethoxy substituent is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. Introducing it first activates the benzene ring toward electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) and directs subsequent substitutions to the ortho and para positions relative to itself. This ensures that the next substituent, tert-butyl, will be introduced regioselectively at the ortho position (position 2). 2) Friedel-Crafts alkylation second: With the ethoxy group in place, tert-butylation via Friedel-Crafts alkylation proceeds regioselectively at the ortho position. Although Friedel-Crafts alkylation can suffer from side reactions such as polyalkylation and carbocation rearrangements, careful control of reaction conditions (stoichiometry, temperature, catalyst choice) can minimize these issues. The bulky tert-butyl group also introduces steric hindrance, which helps prevent multiple alkylations. 3) Nitration last: The nitro group is strongly deactivating and meta-directing. Introducing it last avoids deactivation of the ring before alkylation and etherification steps, which would otherwise reduce yields or prevent these reactions. Given the existing substituents, nitration preferentially occurs at position 3 (meta to ethoxy), consistent with the target substitution pattern. Although nitration conditions are harsh and can cause side reactions or over-nitration, performing nitration last minimizes complications and allows for better control. Alternative sequences, such as nitration first or tert-butyl first, present significant challenges: nitration first deactivates the ring, hindering subsequent Friedel-Crafts alkylation or etherification; tert-butyl first lacks the directing influence of ethoxy, leading to poor regioselectivity and potential polyalkylation; nitration before tert-butyl or ethoxy similarly reduces yields and complicates regioselectivity. The critiques highlight potential problems such as polyalkylation during Friedel-Crafts alkylation and harsh conditions during nitration, but these are manageable with optimized reaction conditions and purification techniques. Overall, sequence D balances reactivity, regioselectivity, and practical synthetic feasibility, leading to the highest yield and purity of the desired product. This sequence is the most chemically logical, practical, and efficient route to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene.

proposed answer: The synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene requires a sequence of reactions that are mechanistically feasible, regioselective, synthetically practical, and yield-efficient. Among the four proposed sequences (A, B, C, D), only sequence B meets all these criteria. 

Step 1: Mechanistic Feasibility
- Friedel-Crafts alkylation to introduce the tert-butyl group is a well-established reaction that proceeds with high yield and regioselectivity. It introduces an activating, ortho/para-directing substituent at position 2.
- Nitration is a classical electrophilic aromatic substitution that introduces a nitro group meta to the tert-butyl substituent, at position 3, consistent with directing effects.
- Direct electrophilic aromatic substitution to install an ethoxy group is impossible because ethers are not electrophilic substituents. Therefore, sequences A and D, which propose direct ethoxylation, are invalid.
- The ethoxy group must be introduced via a phenol intermediate, which is obtained by reducing the nitro group to an amine, diazotizing, and hydrolyzing to phenol, followed by Williamson ether synthesis to install the ethoxy group.

Step 2: Regioselectivity
- The tert-butyl group directs nitration to the meta position, ensuring the nitro group is installed at position 3.
- The nitro group is then converted to phenol at position 1, which is subsequently etherified to the ethoxy group.

Step 3: Synthetic Practicality and Yield
- Introducing the tert-butyl group first activates the ring for nitration, improving yield and regioselectivity.
- Introducing nitro first (sequence C) deactivates the ring, making Friedel-Crafts alkylation difficult and low-yielding.
- The multi-step conversion of nitro to phenol is yield-limiting but manageable with careful control.
- Williamson ether synthesis is generally high-yielding and scalable.
- Potential side reactions such as polyalkylation, over-nitration, incomplete reduction, and diazonium salt decomposition are controllable with optimized conditions.

Step 4: Avoidance of Flawed Assumptions
- Sequences A and D assume direct ethoxylation via electrophilic aromatic substitution, which is chemically impossible.
- Sequence C underestimates the deactivating effect of the nitro group on Friedel-Crafts alkylation.

Step 5: Consensus and Literature Support
- Multiple agents independently conclude that sequence B is the only viable and practical route.

In conclusion, sequence B is the optimal synthetic route because it respects mechanistic principles, ensures correct regioselectivity, is synthetically practical, and maximizes overall yield while minimizing side reactions. It avoids impossible steps and flawed assumptions, making it the robust and well-justified choice for synthesizing 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.
