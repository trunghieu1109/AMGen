proposed answer: The correct equation relating T_1 and T_2 that matches the derived Boltzmann relation and the observed excitation ratio is ln(2) = - (ΔE / k) * (1/T_1 - 1/T_2). This conclusion is supported by multiple lines of reasoning and consensus among various agents. First, dimensional consistency is confirmed: ΔE has units of energy, k (Boltzmann constant) has units of energy per temperature, so ΔE/k has units of temperature. The term (1/T_1 - 1/T_2) has units of inverse temperature, making their product dimensionless, which is necessary for the argument of the logarithm function. Second, the sign convention is physically meaningful. Since ΔE > 0 and temperatures T_1, T_2 > 0, if T_1 > T_2, then (1/T_1 - 1/T_2) < 0, so the negative sign in front makes the right side positive, consistent with ln(2) > 0. This matches the physical expectation that a higher temperature corresponds to a higher excited state population, hence a population ratio greater than one. If T_1 = T_2, the right side is zero, so ln(2) = 0, indicating equal populations, which is physically correct. If ΔE = 0, the right side is zero regardless of temperature difference, meaning no energy difference leads to equal populations, which is also physically reasonable. Alternative forms either invert the sign or swap temperature terms, leading to incorrect or less intuitive physical interpretations. Therefore, considering all possible cases and the physical meaning, the equation ln(2) = - (ΔE / k) * (1/T_1 - 1/T_2) is the only correct and consistent choice that aligns with the Boltzmann distribution and observed excitation ratios.

proposed answer: The problem requires selecting the correct equation relating the ratio of excited iron atom populations in two stars at temperatures T1 and T2 under LTE conditions, based on the Boltzmann distribution. The derived formula is n2/n1 = exp[(ΔE/k)(1/T1 - 1/T2)]. This formula correctly incorporates the excitation energy difference ΔE, the Boltzmann constant k, and the difference in inverse temperatures (1/T1 - 1/T2). Step 1: Sign Convention - The exponent must be positive when T2 > T1, reflecting that the star with higher temperature has a higher excited state population. The formula's sign convention matches this physical intuition. Any candidate reversing this sign or missing ΔE/k is incorrect. Step 2: Dimensional Consistency - ΔE has units of energy (Joules), k has units J/K, so ΔE/k has units Kelvin. The term (1/T1 - 1/T2) has units 1/Kelvin, making the product dimensionless, which is necessary for the exponential function. Candidates missing ΔE or k or having incorrect temperature dependencies (e.g., squared terms) violate dimensional consistency. Step 3: Physical Plausibility - The ratio depends exponentially on the difference in inverse temperatures scaled by ΔE/k, consistent with physical principles governing excitation states. Candidates lacking this term or with incorrect dependencies are physically implausible. Step 4: Evaluation of Options - Options A and B lack ΔE or k or have incorrect temperature dependencies, so they are eliminated. Option C has ambiguous notation and sign inconsistencies, making it unreliable. Option D matches the derived formula exactly, including all necessary terms with correct sign and order, and is dimensionally consistent and physically plausible. Step 5: Degeneracy and Partition Functions - These are stated to be equal or negligible, so their omission does not affect correctness. Conclusion: Only option D satisfies all criteria: correct sign convention, dimensional consistency, physical plausibility, and alignment with the Boltzmann relation. Other options are rejected due to missing or incorrect terms, sign errors, or dimensional inconsistencies. Therefore, option D is the correct and final answer.
