Question: Example(question='Imagine an operator $\\vec{P}$ of a system have components $P_x, P_y$ and $P_z$. The matrix form of the  operator $P_x$ has components in the first row as $(0, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,\\hbar/\\sqrt{2},0)$.  The matrix form of the  operator $P_y$ has components in the first row as $(0, -i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0, -i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2},0)$. Similarly, matrix form of the  operator $P_z$ has components in the first row as $(\\hbar, 0, 0)$, that in the second row as $(0, 0, 0)$ and that in the third row as $(0,0, -\\hbar)$. The basis vectors here are the eigenvectors of $P_z$. The system is found in the eigenstate of $P_x$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$. To be more specific, the explicit form of the state of the system is given by the column vector having elements $(-1/2, 1/\\sqrt{2}, -1/2)$. What is the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z $ of $P_z$', choice1='\\hbar\n', choice2='\\hbar/2', choice3='\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}\n', choice4='\\sqrt{2}\\hbar', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: The uncertainty in P_z, ΔP_z, is derived as ΔP_z = (1/2) * sqrt(1 - (|a|^2 - |b|^2)^2) for a normalized state vector ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩ with |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1. This formula correctly captures the quantum uncertainty of the spin component along the z-axis for any normalized spin-1/2 state. The term (|a|^2 - |b|^2) ranges between -1 and 1, ensuring the expression under the square root is non-negative. The uncertainty is zero when the state is an eigenstate of P_z (|a|^2 = 1 or |b|^2 = 1) and reaches its maximum value of 1/2 when |a|^2 = |b|^2 = 1/2 (equal superposition). This behavior aligns with the physical interpretation of spin measurements in quantum mechanics. All debate agents agree on this formula and its implications, and option C) matches this derived expression and its physical meaning. Other options do not correctly represent the dependence of uncertainty on the state coefficients or the range of possible values. Therefore, the final answer is C).
