Question: Example(question="If uncertainty in space of electron's location, which is travelling with speed v= 2* 10^8 m/s along x-direction is Δx=0.1 nm . Based on the infromation estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of electron.", choice1='~10^(-19) J', choice2='~10^(-18) J', choice3='~10^(-16) J', choice4='~10^(-17) J', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Test New Architecture_172
proposed answer: The uncertainty in kinetic energy ΔE is derived from the uncertainty in momentum Δp using the relation ΔE ≈ (p/m)Δp, which simplifies to ΔE ≈ vΔp since p = mv. Given the electron's velocity v = 2 × 10^8 m/s and mass m = 9.11 × 10^-31 kg, the momentum p = mv = 1.822 × 10^-22 kg·m/s. The uncertainty in momentum Δp is approximately 5.27 × 10^-25 kg·m/s, obtained from the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Multiplying these values yields ΔE ≈ v × Δp = (2 × 10^8 m/s) × (5.27 × 10^-25 kg·m/s) = 1.054 × 10^-16 J. This calculation is consistent across multiple independent agents and methods, confirming its reliability. Although the electron's velocity is relativistic (about two-thirds the speed of light), relativistic corrections to this uncertainty estimate are minimal and do not significantly affect the result. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle sets a lower bound on Δp, so the corresponding ΔE is also a minimum uncertainty. Comparing this value to the provided multiple-choice options, option C) corresponds closely to 1.05 × 10^-16 J, making it the best and most justified choice. All agents agree on this conclusion, and no other options come close to this value. Therefore, the final answer is option C).
