Question: Example(question="You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control’s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control’s resistance; 0% ‒ all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?\n", choice1='G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3', choice2='G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1', choice3='G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1', choice4='G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: Based on the analysis of the resistance levels of the single and double mutants, it is clear that G2 is a transcription factor. The g2 single mutant shows 0% resistance, indicating G2's crucial role in the resistance pathway. The double mutants g1g2 and g2g3 also exhibit 0% resistance, which suggests that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. This means that the presence of G2 is necessary for resistance, and its absence results in complete loss of resistance, supporting its role as a transcription factor. Regarding the interaction between G1 and G3, the g1 single mutant shows 75% resistance, while the g3 single mutant shows 50% resistance. The g1g3 double mutant shows only 10% resistance, indicating that G1 and G3 are not completely redundant but both contribute to resistance. G1 has a stronger independent effect than G3, as seen by the higher resistance level of the g1 mutant compared to g3. The low resistance of the g1g3 double mutant suggests that both genes are important for full resistance, but they do not fully compensate for each other, indicating a lack of redundancy. There is no clear evidence of pleiotropy, as we are only observing resistance. The interaction between G1 and G3 does not provide strong evidence of classical epistasis, but G1 has a stronger contribution to resistance than G3. Therefore, the final decision is that G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 interact in contributing to resistance with G1 having a stronger effect, and G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.

Answer:G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 interact in contributing to resistance with G1 having a stronger effect, and G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.
Extracted answer: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 interact in contributing to resistance with G1 having a stronger effect, and G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.
