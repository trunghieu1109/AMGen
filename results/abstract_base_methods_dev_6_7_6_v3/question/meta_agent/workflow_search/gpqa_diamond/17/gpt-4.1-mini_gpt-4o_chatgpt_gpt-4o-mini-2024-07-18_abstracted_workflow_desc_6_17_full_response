For Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex, which means that the iron abundance relative to hydrogen is the same as the solar value. The solar iron abundance is given as 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5, so nFe/nH for Star_1 is 10^(7.5 - 12) = 10^(-4.5). For Star_2, [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex, meaning the magnesium abundance relative to hydrogen is also the same as the solar value. The solar magnesium abundance is 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7, so nMg/nH for Star_2 is 10^(7 - 12) = 10^(-5).

For Star_1, we have [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex. This means that the silicon abundance relative to iron is 0.3 dex higher than the solar ratio. The solar silicon abundance is 12 + log10(nSi/nH) = 7.51, and the solar iron abundance is 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5. Thus, the solar [Si/Fe] = 7.51 - 7.5 = 0.01 dex. For Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex, so log10(nSi/nFe)_1 = 0.3 + 0.01 = 0.31 dex. Since nFe/nH for Star_1 is 10^(-4.5), we have log10(nSi/nH)_1 = log10(nFe/nH)_1 + log10(nSi/nFe)_1 = -4.5 + 0.31 = -4.19. Therefore, nSi/nH for Star_1 is 10^(-4.19). For Star_2, we have [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex. This means that the magnesium abundance relative to silicon is 0.3 dex higher than the solar ratio. The solar magnesium abundance is 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7, and the solar silicon abundance is 12 + log10(nSi/nH) = 7.51, so the solar [Mg/Si] = 7 - 7.51 = -0.51 dex. For Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex, so log10(nMg/nSi)_2 = 0.3 - 0.51 = -0.21 dex. Since nMg/nH for Star_2 is 10^(-5), we have log10(nSi/nH)_2 = log10(nMg/nH)_2 - log10(nMg/nSi)_2 = -5 + 0.21 = -4.79.
