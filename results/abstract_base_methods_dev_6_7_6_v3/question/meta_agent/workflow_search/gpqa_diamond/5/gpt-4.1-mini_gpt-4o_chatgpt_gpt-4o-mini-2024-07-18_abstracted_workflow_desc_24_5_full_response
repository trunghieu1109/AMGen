The first term, 1/2 kr^2, is a radial potential that resembles a two-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator. The second term, 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ), introduces an angular dependence, which can be rewritten using the identity cos^2(θ) = (1 + cos(2θ))/2. This suggests that the potential can be separated into a radial part and an angular part, allowing for separation of variables in polar coordinates.

The potential given is V(r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ). Substituting these relations, we have r^2 = x^2 + y^2 and cos^2(θ) = (x^2/r^2).

The radial coordinate r is given by r = sqrt(x^2 + y^2). Thus, the term 1/2 kr^2 becomes 1/2 k(x^2 + y^2). For the term 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ), we note that cos^2(θ) = x^2/r^2, so 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ) = 3/2 kx^2.
