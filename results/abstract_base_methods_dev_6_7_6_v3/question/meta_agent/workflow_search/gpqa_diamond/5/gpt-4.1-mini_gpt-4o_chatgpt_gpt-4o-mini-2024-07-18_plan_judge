Question: Example(question='A quantum mechanical particle of mass m moves in two dimensions in the following potential, as a function of (r,θ): V (r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ)\nFind the energy spectrum.', choice1='E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)', choice2='E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))', choice3='E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))', choice4='E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: The derived energy spectrum expression is E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ℏsqrt(k/m). We need to compare this with the given multiple-choice options. Choice 1 is 'E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)', which matches exactly with the derived expression. The other choices do not match the derived expression. Therefore, the correct choice is choice 1.
