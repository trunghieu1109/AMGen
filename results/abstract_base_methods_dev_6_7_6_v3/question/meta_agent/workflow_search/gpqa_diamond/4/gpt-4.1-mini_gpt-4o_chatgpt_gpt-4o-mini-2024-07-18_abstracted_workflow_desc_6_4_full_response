Simplifying, we get \\cos^2 \\theta - 1 = 0, which is always true. Therefore, we solve the system: (\\cos \\theta - 1)\\psi_1 + \\sin \\theta \\psi_2 = 0 and \\sin \\theta \\psi_1 + (-\\cos \\theta - 1)\\psi_2 = 0. Solving these, we find \\psi_1 = \\cos(\\theta/2) and \\psi_2 = \\sin(\\theta/2). The eigenvector is |\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}. This vector is already normalized since \\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2) = 1. Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is (\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2)). This solution is specific to the eigenvalue +\\hbar/2 and assumes the direction vector is in the x-z plane, which simplifies the problem. The solution does not address the case for the eigenvalue -\\hbar/2, which would correspond to the other eigenvector of the operator.; answer: (\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent jrmW, round 0, comparing eigenvector with options, thinking: The derived normalized eigenvector from Sub-task 4 is (\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2)).
