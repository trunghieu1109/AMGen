proposed answer: From Sub-task 5, we calculated the kinetic energy of the mu(+) to be approximately 4.12 MeV and the kinetic energy of the neutrino to be approximately 29.8 MeV. These values were obtained by considering energy and momentum conservation in the decay process. The total energy of the system is conserved and is equal to the rest mass energy of the stationary Pi(+), which is 139.6 MeV. The rest mass energy of the mu(+) is 105.7 MeV, so its kinetic energy is the difference between its total energy and its rest mass energy. The neutrino, being massless, has its total energy equal to its kinetic energy. By solving the conservation equations, we found the kinetic energies to be 4.12 MeV for the mu(+) and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino. These calculated values match exactly with choice 4 in the original question, which lists the kinetic energies as 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. Therefore, the correct choice is D).
