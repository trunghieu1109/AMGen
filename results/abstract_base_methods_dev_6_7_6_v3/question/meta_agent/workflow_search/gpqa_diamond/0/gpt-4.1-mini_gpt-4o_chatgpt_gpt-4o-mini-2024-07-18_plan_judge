Question: Example(question='Two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10^-9 sec and 10^-8 sec, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which one of the following options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?\n', choice1='10^-9 eV', choice2='10^-11 eV', choice3='10^-8 eV\n', choice4='10^-4 eV', correct_index=4)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_2_0
proposed answer: The minimum energy difference required to clearly resolve the two energy levels is approximately 7.24 x 10^-7 eV, as determined using the energy-time uncertainty principle. To resolve the levels, the energy difference must be greater than this value. Evaluating the given options: 10^-9 eV, 10^-11 eV, 10^-8 eV, and 10^-4 eV, only 10^-4 eV is greater than 7.24 x 10^-7 eV. Therefore, 10^-4 eV is the only option that satisfies the condition for clear resolution of the energy levels. All debate agents agree on this conclusion, and the reasoning is consistent across their analyses.

Answer:10^-4 eV
Extracted answer: 10^-4 eV
Correct answer: 4

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_2_0
proposed answer: The minimum energy difference required to clearly resolve the two energy levels is larger than 6.58 Ã— 10^-7 eV. Among the given options, option D (10^-4 eV) is the only one that is larger than this minimum energy difference, ensuring clear resolution. Options A (10^-9 eV), B (10^-11 eV), and C (10^-8 eV) are all smaller than the required minimum and thus do not satisfy the condition for clear resolution. Therefore, option D is the correct choice.
