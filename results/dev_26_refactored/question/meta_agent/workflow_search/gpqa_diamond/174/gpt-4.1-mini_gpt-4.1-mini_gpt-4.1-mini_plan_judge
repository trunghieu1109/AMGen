proposed answer: The problem involves an oscillating spheroidal charge distribution with its symmetry axis along the z-axis, radiating electromagnetic waves at wavelength λ. The angular dependence of the radiated power per unit solid angle in the far-field for such a configuration is characteristic of dipole radiation, which follows a sin^2(θ) pattern. This means the power is zero along the axis (θ=0° or 180°) and maximum perpendicular to it (θ=90°). Given this, the fraction of the maximum power A at θ=30° is sin^2(30°) = (1/2)^2 = 1/4. Regarding wavelength dependence, classical dipole radiation power scales as the fourth power of frequency ω, or equivalently as λ^{-4} since ω = 2πc/λ. Combining these, the radiated power per unit solid angle f(λ, θ) can be expressed as proportional to sin^2(θ) × λ^{-4}. Among the given options, only choice 3 matches both the fraction 1/4 and the λ^{-4} dependence. Other options either have incorrect fractions or incorrect wavelength scaling exponents. Therefore, the correct answer is C). This conclusion is consistent with classical electromagnetic theory and the known radiation pattern of dipole-like oscillations in spheroidal charge distributions.

proposed answer: The problem involves an oscillating spheroidal charge distribution symmetric about the z-axis. Due to this symmetry, the net dipole moment cancels out because any dipole component perpendicular to the z-axis averages out by rotational symmetry, and the dipole component along the z-axis cancels due to symmetric oscillation of charges. Therefore, the leading multipole moment responsible for radiation is the quadrupole moment. Quadrupole radiation has a characteristic angular dependence and wavelength scaling different from dipole radiation. Specifically, the radiated power per unit solid angle for quadrupole radiation scales as λ^{-6}, reflecting the higher order spatial derivatives involved in the radiation process. The angular dependence of quadrupole radiation typically follows a sin^2(2θ) pattern, which has maxima at θ=45° and zeros at θ=0° and 90°. Evaluating sin^2(2θ) at θ=30° gives sin^2(60°) = (√3/2)^2 = 3/4. This means that the power radiated at θ=30° is 3/4 of the maximum power A. Among the given options, only choice 2 ('3/4, λ^{-6}') matches both the angular fraction at θ=30° and the correct wavelength dependence for quadrupole radiation. Other choices either have incorrect angular fractions or incorrect wavelength exponents inconsistent with the physics of quadrupole radiation. This conclusion aligns with multipole radiation theory and the symmetry properties of the spheroidal oscillating charge distribution and avoids oversimplification by not assuming dipole radiation. Hence, the correct fraction and wavelength dependence combination is 3/4 and λ^{-6}, corresponding to choice B).
