proposed answer: The system consists of three spins S1, S2, and S3, each of which can be +1 or -1, resulting in 2^3 = 8 total configurations. The energy is given by E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). We analyze the possible energies by considering the pairwise products of spins. When all three spins are aligned (all +1 or all -1), each pair product is +1, so the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = 3, and the energy E = -3J. There are exactly 2 such configurations: (1,1,1) and (-1,-1,-1). For the other 6 configurations, two spins are aligned and one is opposite, resulting in two pair products being -1 and one being +1, summing to -1. Hence, energy E = J for these 6 configurations. Therefore, the energy levels are -3J with degeneracy 2 and J with degeneracy 6. The partition function Z is the sum over all states of e^{-βE}, which can be grouped by energy levels as Z = 2 * e^{-β(-3J)} + 6 * e^{-β(J)} = 2 * e^{3Jβ} + 6 * e^{-Jβ}. Comparing this with the given choices, this matches exactly choice A. The other choices have incorrect exponents or degeneracies. This calculation accounts for all configurations and their energies correctly, and the degeneracies are consistent with the spin configurations. Hence, the most consistent and correct partition function expression is choice A.
