proposed answer: The metric given is ds^2 = (32 / (4 - x^2 - y^2)) (dx^2 + dy^2), defined on the disk x^2 + y^2 < 4. To find the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2, we convert to polar coordinates (r, θ), where the metric becomes ds^2 = (32 / (4 - r^2)) (dr^2 + r^2 dθ^2). The area element dA is the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor times dr dθ, which evaluates to dA = (32 r) / (4 - r^2) dr dθ. The total area A is then the integral over r from 0 to 2 and θ from 0 to 2π: A = ∫₀^{2π} ∫₀^{2} (32 r / (4 - r^2)) dr dθ = 2π ∫₀^{2} (32 r / (4 - r^2)) dr. Substituting u = 4 - r^2, du = -2r dr, the integral becomes 16 ∫₀^{4} (1/u) du, which diverges to infinity because of the singularity at u=0 (r=2). This shows the area under the given metric of the pseudosphere of radius 2 is infinite. The other options either represent zero or expressions depending on x and y, which cannot represent a scalar area. Zero area contradicts the positive definite metric on the disk. Therefore, the only mathematically consistent and correct choice is that the area is infinite, i.e., choice A).
