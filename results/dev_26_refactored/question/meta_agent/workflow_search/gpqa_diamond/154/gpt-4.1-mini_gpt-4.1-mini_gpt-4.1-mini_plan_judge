Question: Example(question='Imagine an operator $\\vec{P}$ of a system have components $P_x, P_y$ and $P_z$. The matrix form of the  operator $P_x$ has components in the first row as $(0, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,\\hbar/\\sqrt{2},0)$.  The matrix form of the  operator $P_y$ has components in the first row as $(0, -i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0, -i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2},0)$. Similarly, matrix form of the  operator $P_z$ has components in the first row as $(\\hbar, 0, 0)$, that in the second row as $(0, 0, 0)$ and that in the third row as $(0,0, -\\hbar)$. The basis vectors here are the eigenvectors of $P_z$. The system is found in the eigenstate of $P_x$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$. To be more specific, the explicit form of the state of the system is given by the column vector having elements $(-1/2, 1/\\sqrt{2}, -1/2)$. What is the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z $ of $P_z$', choice1='\\hbar\n', choice2='\\hbar/2', choice3='\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}\n', choice4='\\sqrt{2}\\hbar', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: The uncertainty ΔP_z is defined as the square root of the variance of the operator P_z in the given state |ψ⟩. The variance is given by ⟨P_z^2⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩^2. From Sub-task 2, the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ was calculated as 0. This is because the state vector components squared are (1/4, 1/2, 1/4) corresponding to eigenvalues (ħ, 0, -ħ), and the weighted sum cancels out. From Sub-task 3, the expectation value ⟨P_z^2⟩ was calculated as ħ^2/2, since the squared eigenvalues are (ħ^2, 0, ħ^2) and the weighted sum is (1/4 + 0 + 1/4)ħ^2 = ħ^2/2. Therefore, the variance is ħ^2/2 - 0 = ħ^2/2. Taking the square root gives ΔP_z = ħ/√2. Among the given choices, this corresponds to choice C). This result is consistent with the fact that the state is an eigenstate of P_x but not of P_z, so there is a nonzero uncertainty in P_z. The calculations assume the state vector is normalized, which is confirmed by the sum of squares of components being 1. Hence, the correct uncertainty value is ħ/√2, choice C).
