proposed answer: Retroviruses are RNA viruses that replicate through a DNA intermediate formed by reverse transcription of their RNA genome into complementary DNA (cDNA). Therefore, direct DNA sequencing (choice A) is inappropriate because it targets DNA without first converting viral RNA into cDNA, which is necessary to capture the viral genome accurately. Symptom-based identification (choice C) is indirect and nonspecific, as symptoms can overlap with other infections, making it unreliable for designing a precise molecular diagnostic kit. Antibody detection via ELISA targeting IgG antibodies (choice B) reflects the host immune response, which typically develops days to weeks after infection. This delay makes ELISA less suitable for early or rapid diagnosis during an outbreak, as it may miss acute infections. Among PCR methods, nested PCR (choice C) increases sensitivity but is more complex, labor-intensive, and time-consuming, which is a disadvantage when rapid diagnosis is needed. Real-time PCR (choice D) offers rapid, sensitive, and quantitative detection of viral cDNA, enabling early and accurate diagnosis. The process involves first performing cDNA sequencing to identify the viral genome accurately, which allows designing specific primers for the real-time PCR assay. This approach aligns with the biology of retroviruses, ensures high specificity by targeting viral genetic material, and provides quick turnaround times essential for outbreak management. It also avoids the limitations of antibody-based detection and symptom-based identification. Therefore, the most appropriate diagnostic approach is to first perform cDNA sequencing followed by development of a real-time PCR kit targeting viral cDNA for quick and accurate detection of the retrovirus.
