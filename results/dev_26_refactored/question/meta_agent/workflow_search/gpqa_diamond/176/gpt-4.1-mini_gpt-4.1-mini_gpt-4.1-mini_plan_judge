proposed answer: The problem states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2 and both stars have the same peak wavelength of emission. According to Wien's displacement law, the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to temperature, so equal peak wavelengths imply equal surface temperatures (T1 = T2). The luminosity of a star radiating as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR^2σT^4. Since the temperatures are equal, the luminosity ratio depends solely on the ratio of the surface areas, which is proportional to the square of the radius ratio. Given R1 = 1.5 * R2, the luminosity ratio L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. The mass ratio does not directly affect the luminosity calculation here. The radial velocities would cause Doppler shifts, but since the peak wavelengths are stated to be the same, this implies that these Doppler shifts have been corrected or the wavelengths are intrinsic to the stars. Therefore, radial velocity does not affect the intrinsic luminosity calculation. Considering all these factors and possible cases, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of approximately 2.25. Among the given choices (~2.23, ~2.25, ~2.32, ~2.35), the one closest to this value is choice A) ~2.25. This conclusion is consistent across multiple analyses and aligns with fundamental physical laws governing black body radiation and stellar luminosity.

proposed answer: The problem involves two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, with Star_1 having a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2 and the same factor increase in mass. Both stars have the same observed peak wavelength, but Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, causing a Doppler shift in its observed spectrum. Since the observed peak wavelengths are equal, the intrinsic peak wavelength of Star_2 must be corrected for this Doppler effect. Applying the relativistic Doppler formula, the intrinsic peak wavelength of Star_2 is shorter than the observed wavelength, indicating Star_2 is intrinsically hotter than Star_1. According to Wien's displacement law, temperature is inversely proportional to peak wavelength, so T2 > T1. The luminosity of a star radiating as a black body is given by L = 4πR^2σT^4, so the luminosity ratio L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4. With R1/R2 = 1.5, the naive luminosity ratio ignoring temperature differences is 1.5^2 = 2.25. However, since T2 > T1, the factor (T1/T2)^4 is less than 1, reducing the luminosity ratio slightly below 2.25. Detailed calculations accounting for the Doppler correction and temperature differences yield a luminosity ratio approximately 2.23. Comparing this result to the provided choices (~2.25, ~2.35, ~2.32, ~2.23), the closest and most physically consistent match is choice D) ~2.23. This choice reflects a careful and complete consideration of radius differences, Doppler effects on temperature, and the Stefan-Boltzmann law, making it the best answer. Other choices are either too high or do not account for the temperature correction due to Doppler shift. Therefore, the best justified and physically accurate answer is D).
