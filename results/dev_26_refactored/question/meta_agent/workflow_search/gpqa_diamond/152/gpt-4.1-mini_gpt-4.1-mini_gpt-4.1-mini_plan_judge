Question: Example(question='α-β unsaturated carbonyls have a much more electrophilic carbon double bond. These double bonds act as a good Lewis acid and react with nucleophiles to produce enolate ions. In this case, when a nucleophile attacks the β position, it produces a resonance-stabilized intermediate. When a nucleophile attacking the β-carbon is enolate, such reaction is known as the Michael reaction.\nWhat are the reactants and major final products of the following Michael addition reactions?\ndimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) -->(A)\n1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H3O+) --> (B)\nC + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H2O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice1='A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice2='A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice3='A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice4='A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: The Michael addition reactions involve nucleophilic attack at the β-position of α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds, producing resonance-stabilized intermediates and final products with specific substitution patterns and tautomeric forms. For reaction (A), dimethyl malonate is deprotonated by NaOEt to form an enolate nucleophile, which attacks methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The nucleophile attacks the β-carbon, placing the p-tolyl substituent at carbon 2 relative to the malonate-derived carbons, consistent with the product trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. This is supported by the regioselectivity of Michael additions and the numbering of the product. For reaction (B), 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine acts as an enamine nucleophile attacking (E)-but-2-enenitrile. Upon acidic workup (MeOH, H3O+), the intermediate tautomerizes predominantly to the keto (oxo) form rather than the enol (hydroxy) form due to keto-enol tautomerism favoring the ketone. Thus, the product is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile. For reaction (C), compound C reacts with but-3-en-2-one under basic aqueous conditions to yield 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. The identity of compound C must be 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione, the enol tautomer of cyclohexane-1,3-dione, which is more reactive and consistent with the product structure. Comparing all given choices, only choice1 correctly assigns the substitution patterns, tautomeric forms, and product identities consistent with the reaction mechanisms, conditions, and known chemical behavior. Other choices either misplace substituents (e.g., at carbon 3 instead of 2), assign incorrect tautomeric forms (hydroxy instead of oxo in product B), or misidentify compound C's tautomeric form. Therefore, choice1 is the most accurate and justified answer based on detailed mechanistic reasoning, tautomerism, substitution patterns, and nomenclature correctness.

proposed answer: The problem involves three Michael addition reactions with specific reactants and conditions. For reaction (A), dimethyl malonate acts as a nucleophile attacking the β-carbon of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate under NaOEt/EtOH conditions, producing a trimethyl tricarboxylate. The correct regiochemistry places the p-tolyl substituent at the 2-position of the propane backbone, yielding trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. This is consistent with the Michael addition mechanism where the nucleophile attacks the β-carbon, and the numbering reflects the correct substitution pattern. For reaction (B), 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine reacts with (E)-but-2-enenitrile under MeOH/H3O+ conditions. The enamine nucleophile attacks the β-position, and subsequent acidic workup favors the keto form, leading to 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile. The keto tautomer is more stable under acidic conditions, so the oxo form is the correct assignment. For reaction (C), compound C reacts with but-3-en-2-one under KOH/H2O conditions to produce 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. The starting compound C must be the enol form 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione to explain the product formation and tautomeric equilibrium. This is consistent with the reaction conditions and the product structure. Cross-checking all choices, only choice 1 correctly assigns the substitution patterns, tautomeric forms (keto vs hydroxy), and nomenclature consistent with the reaction mechanisms and conditions. Other choices misplace substituents, incorrectly assign tautomers, or misidentify compound C. Therefore, choice A is the only consistent and chemically accurate set of product identities for (A), (B), and (C).
