Question: Example(question='In the lab, a chemist discovers an unnamed bottle with a white solid inside. He gathers the following spectral information in order to identify the liquid. Make a reasonable structural suggestion for the unidentified drug using the information provided.\nMass: molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 (100%)\na peak at m/z = 158 (32%)\nIR : broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1, strong sharp peak at 1720 cm-1\n1H NMR: 11.0 ppm (s, 1H), 8.02 ppm (d, 2H), 7.72 (d, 2H)', choice1='4-chlorobenzoic acid', choice2='2-chlorobenzoic acid', choice3='3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde\n', choice4='Phenyl chloroformate', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: The molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 with a corresponding isotopic peak at m/z = 158 (about one-third intensity) clearly indicates the presence of one chlorine atom due to the natural isotopic distribution of 35Cl and 37Cl. The IR spectrum shows a broad peak spanning 3500-2700 cm^-1, characteristic of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid, and a sharp, strong peak at 1720 cm^-1, indicative of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch typical of a carboxylic acid group. The 1H NMR spectrum shows a singlet at 11.0 ppm integrating for one proton, consistent with the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid. The aromatic region shows two doublets at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm, each integrating to two protons, which strongly supports a para-substituted benzene ring with symmetrical substitution. Among the given options, 4-chlorobenzoic acid fits all these spectral criteria best: it contains one chlorine atom, a carboxylic acid functional group, and a para-substituted aromatic ring giving the observed NMR splitting pattern. 2-chlorobenzoic acid would show a more complex splitting pattern due to ortho substitution, 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde would show aldehyde proton signals near 10 ppm and lack the broad acidic O-H stretch, and phenyl chloroformate would lack the carboxylic acid proton and broad O-H stretch in IR. Therefore, the most reasonable structural suggestion for the unidentified compound, considering all spectral data and chemical reasoning, is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.
