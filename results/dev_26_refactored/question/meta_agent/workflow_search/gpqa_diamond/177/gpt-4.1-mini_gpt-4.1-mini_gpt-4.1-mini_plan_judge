proposed answer: In four-dimensional spacetime, the mass dimension of the Lagrangian density must be 4. The interaction term given is \( \mathcal{L}_{int} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu} \). The fermion field \( \psi \) has mass dimension 3/2, so the bilinear \( \bar{\psi} \psi \) has dimension 3 (since 3/2 + 3/2 = 3). The tensor \( \sigma_{\mu\nu} \), constructed from gamma matrices, is dimensionless (mass dimension 0). The field strength tensor \( F^{\mu\nu} \) has mass dimension 2. Adding these, the operator \( \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu} \) has dimension 3 + 2 = 5. Since the total Lagrangian density must have dimension 4, the coupling constant \( \kappa \) must have mass dimension 4 - 5 = -1. According to standard quantum field theory criteria, couplings with negative mass dimension correspond to nonrenormalizable interactions because they introduce operators of higher dimension that cannot be renormalized with a finite number of counterterms. Therefore, the theory with this interaction is nonrenormalizable. The only consistent choice among the options is that \( \kappa \) has mass dimension -1 and the theory is not renormalizable, which corresponds to option C). Other options either have incorrect mass dimension or incorrect renormalizability status. Hence, the correct answer is C).
