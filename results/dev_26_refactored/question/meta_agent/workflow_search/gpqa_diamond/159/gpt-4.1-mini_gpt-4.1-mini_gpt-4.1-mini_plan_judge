Question: Example(question='Consider an aperture, which shapes like a N-sided polygon. All the apothems are of the same length a. When a monochromatic light (of wavelength \\lambda), travelling along z-axis, falls vertically on this aperture, it creates a series of intensity maxima and minima in the far field region.

proposed answer: The problem involves diffraction from an aperture shaped as an N-sided polygon with apothem length a. As N approaches infinity, the polygon approaches a circular aperture of radius a. The far-field diffraction pattern for a circular aperture is described by the Airy pattern, where the intensity minima correspond to zeros of the Bessel function J1. The angular positions θ_n of the minima satisfy the relation (2π a / λ) sin θ_n = x_n, where x_n are the zeros of J1. Using the small-angle approximation sin θ ≈ θ, this becomes θ_n = x_n λ / (2π a). The first two zeros of J1 are approximately x_1 = 3.8317 and x_2 = 7.0156. Therefore, the angular positions of the first two minima are θ_1 = 3.8317 λ / (2π a) and θ_2 = 7.0156 λ / (2π a). The angular distance between these minima is Δθ = θ_2 - θ_1 = (7.0156 - 3.8317) λ / (2π a) ≈ 3.1839 λ / (2π a) ≈ 0.506 λ / a. Among the given options, 0.506 λ / a corresponds exactly to choice 4. Other options correspond to different known diffraction parameters: 1.220 λ / a is the classical Rayleigh criterion angular radius for the first minimum of a circular aperture, 0.610 λ / a is half of that, and 0.500 λ / a is close but less precise. Since the question specifically asks for the angular distance between the first two minima, not just the first minimum's position, the correct answer is choice 4. This conclusion is consistent with the geometry of the aperture, the limiting behavior as N → ∞, and the known diffraction theory for circular apertures.
