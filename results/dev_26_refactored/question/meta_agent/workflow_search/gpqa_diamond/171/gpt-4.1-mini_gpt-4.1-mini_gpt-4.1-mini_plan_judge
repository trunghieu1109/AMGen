Question: Example(question='Two stars are being studied. It has been observed that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2. In fact, the energy difference between the considered energy levels was determined to be approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J. Assuming that the stellar photospheres are in LTE, which of these equations for the effective temperatures of the stars (T_1 and T_2) is correct?', choice1='ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]\n', choice2='ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]\n', choice3='ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n', choice4='ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: The problem states that the ratio of excited iron atoms in star_1 to star_2 is 2, and the energy difference between the levels is ΔE = 1.38 × 10^(-23) J. Under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the population of atoms in an excited state follows the Boltzmann distribution: n_i ∝ exp(-E_i/(kT)), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature. The ratio of populations in the excited state between the two stars is:

n_1 / n_2 = 2 = exp(-ΔE/(kT_1)) / exp(-ΔE/(kT_2)) = exp[ΔE/k * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)].

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides gives:

ln(2) = (ΔE/k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1).

Rearranging the right side:

ln(2) = (ΔE/k) * (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2).

Since ΔE/k is a constant, the key temperature dependence is:

ln(2) ∝ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2).

Among the given options:
- Choice 1: ln(2) = T_2 / T_1, which does not match the derived form.
- Choice 2: ln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)^2, which has an incorrect denominator power.
- Choice 3: ln(2) = (T_1 + T_2) / (T_1 * T_2), which uses sum instead of difference.
- Choice 4: ln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2), which exactly matches the derived expression.

Therefore, choice 4 correctly represents the relationship between the effective temperatures T_1 and T_2 consistent with the Boltzmann excitation ratio under LTE conditions. This conclusion holds generally for any two temperatures T_1 and T_2 where the excitation ratio is known, assuming LTE and Boltzmann statistics apply.
