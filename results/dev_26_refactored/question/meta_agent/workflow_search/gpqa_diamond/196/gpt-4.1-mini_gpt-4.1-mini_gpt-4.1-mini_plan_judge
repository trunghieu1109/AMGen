proposed answer: The IR spectrum of compound X shows a broad O-H stretch (3400–2500 cm⁻¹) and a strong C=O stretch at 1720 cm⁻¹, which are characteristic of a carboxylic acid functional group. The aromatic C=C stretches at 1610 and 1450 cm⁻¹ confirm the presence of an aromatic ring. The 1H NMR data show a broad singlet at 10.5 ppm (1H), typical of a carboxylic acid proton, and two doublets at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm each integrating to 2H, indicating a para-substituted benzene ring. The aliphatic signals at 2.9 ppm (multiplet, 1H), 1.7 ppm (multiplet, 2H), 1.4 ppm (doublet, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (triplet, 3H) correspond well to a sec-butyl group. This confirms that compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI is a known reductive decarboxylation that removes the carboxyl group from benzoic acids, converting them into the corresponding alkylbenzenes. Therefore, the expected final product is para-sec-butylbenzene (1-sec-butylbenzene). Among the given choices, choice B is the starting acid, so it cannot be the product. Choices C and D have substituents inconsistent with the spectral data (ethyl or isobutyl groups and methyl substituents not supported by the aromatic proton integration). Choice A is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which includes a methyl substituent on the benzene ring that is not supported by the NMR data (the aromatic protons integrate to 4H, consistent with para substitution but no methyl group). However, since para-sec-butylbenzene is not listed among the options, choice A is the closest available answer reflecting the sec-butyl substituent on the aromatic ring after decarboxylation, despite the extra methyl group. This discrepancy likely arises from limitations in the provided answer choices. Hence, choice A is the best fit for the final product after the reaction of compound X with red phosphorus and HI.
