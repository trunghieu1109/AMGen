proposed answer: We analyze the problem of a charge +q placed inside a cavity within an uncharged spherical conductor. The cavity is displaced from the conductor's center by a vector s, and the point P lies outside the conductor at distance L from the conductor's center. The distance from P to the cavity center is l, and the angle between vectors l and s is θ. Since the conductor is uncharged and conductive, it rearranges induced charges on its inner and outer surfaces to maintain zero net charge and constant potential on its surface. This shielding effect means the external field cannot be simply the Coulomb field of +q at distance l or any shifted distance like (l ± s cos θ). The induced charges on the conductor's surface cancel the monopole moment of +q outside the conductor, so the net external monopole moment is zero. Therefore, the external field at P arises from induced multipole moments (dipole, quadrupole, etc.) which decay faster than 1/L^2. The options A), B), and C) attempt to express the field as a Coulomb field with modified distances involving l, s, and θ, but these do not correctly account for the conductor's shielding and induced charges. Option D) expresses the field as q/(4πε₀ L^2), referencing the distance from the conductor center to P, which is the natural coordinate for the external field. Although the net external monopole moment is zero, so the actual field is not simply q/L^2, this option is the closest physically meaningful expression among the given choices. Hence, considering all physical constraints and the problem's geometry, the best choice is D).
