Question: Example(question='The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1), and the operators of two observables P and Q of the system are represented by two square matrices. The matrix corresponding to operator P has the elements in first row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0), elements in the second row as (1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}) and that in third row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0). The matrix operator for Q is represented by the square matrix having elements in the first row as (1, 0, 0), second row as (0, 0, 0) and third row as (0, 0, -1).

proposed answer: The post-measurement state after measuring P with eigenvalue 0 is the normalized eigenvector |ψ_post⟩ = (1/√2, 0, -1/√2) as found in Sub-task 4. The eigenspace of Q corresponding to eigenvalue -1 is spanned by the vector |q_-1⟩ = (0, 0, 1) as found in Sub-task 3. To find the probability of measuring Q = -1 on the post-measurement state, we project |ψ_post⟩ onto |q_-1⟩ and compute the squared norm of this projection. The projection amplitude is the inner product ⟨q_-1|ψ_post⟩ = (0, 0, 1) · (1/√2, 0, -1/√2) = -1/√2. The probability is the squared magnitude of this amplitude: |-1/√2|^2 = (1/√2)^2 = 1/2. This means there is a 50% chance to measure Q = -1 immediately after measuring P = 0. This calculation assumes the postulates of quantum mechanics: the state collapses to the eigenvector of P with eigenvalue 0 after the first measurement, and the probability of the second measurement outcome is given by the squared amplitude of the projection onto the eigenspace of Q corresponding to the measured eigenvalue. All vectors are normalized, and the operators are Hermitian, so the calculation is straightforward and unambiguous. Therefore, the probability is 1/2, corresponding to choice A).

proposed answer: To find the joint probability of sequential measurements where first P=0 is measured and then Q=-1 is measured, we must multiply the probability of measuring P=0 on the initial state by the conditional probability of measuring Q=-1 given that the system is in the post-measurement state after measuring P=0. From Sub-task 4, the probability of measuring P=0 on the initial normalized state is 1/3. This was calculated by projecting the normalized initial state vector onto the eigenspace of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0 and squaring the modulus of the projection amplitude. From Sub-task 5, the conditional probability of measuring Q=-1 on the post-measurement state (which is the normalized eigenvector of P with eigenvalue 0) is 1/2. This was found by projecting the post-measurement state onto the eigenspace of Q corresponding to eigenvalue -1 and squaring the modulus of the projection amplitude. Therefore, the joint probability is (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6. This approach correctly applies the quantum measurement postulates, accounting for the collapse of the state after the first measurement and the conditional nature of the second measurement. It avoids the mistake of treating the conditional probability as the joint probability. Hence, the final answer is 1/6, which corresponds to choice B).
