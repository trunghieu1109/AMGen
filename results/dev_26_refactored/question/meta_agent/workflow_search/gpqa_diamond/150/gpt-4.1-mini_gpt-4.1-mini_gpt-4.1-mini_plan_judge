Question: Example(question='The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1). An observable of the system is represented by the matrix operator P having elements in the first row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0),  in the second row as (1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}) and in the third row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0). Calculate the probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 at time t.', choice1='1/3\n', choice2='2/3\n', choice3='\\sqrt{2/3}\n', choice4='1', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: The problem requires calculating the probability of measuring the eigenvalue 0 for the observable P given the system state vector |ψ> = (-1, 2, 1). First, we normalize the state vector. The norm is sqrt((-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(1 + 4 + 1) = sqrt(6). Thus, the normalized state vector is (-1/√6, 2/√6, 1/√6). Next, the projection operator P_0 onto the eigenspace corresponding to eigenvalue 0 is given as [[1/2, 0, -1/2], [0, 0, 0], [-1/2, 0, 1/2]]. Multiplying P_0 by the normalized state vector yields the projected state vector: (-1/√6, 0, 1/√6). The probability of measuring eigenvalue 0 is the squared norm of this projected vector, calculated as (-1/√6)^2 + 0^2 + (1/√6)^2 = 1/6 + 0 + 1/6 = 1/3. This result is consistent with the quantum mechanical postulate that the probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue is the squared magnitude of the projection of the normalized state vector onto the eigenspace corresponding to that eigenvalue. All other options (2/3, sqrt(2/3), 1) do not match this rigorous calculation. Therefore, the probability of measuring eigenvalue 0 is 1/3, corresponding to choice A).
