Question: Example(question='You are studying a nuclear decay which converts two heavy nucleons of flavor A to another flavor B, while simultaneously emitting two much lighter particles E and V. In short, 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V. It is known that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous, with some endpoint value Q.\n\nA variant of this decay emits one exotic, massless particle M instead of the 2V. In this case, how does the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles compare to that of the original decay?', choice1='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint increases.', choice2='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases.', choice3='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.', choice4='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint decreases.', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: The original decay 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V produces a continuous energy spectrum for the E particles with an endpoint Q because the energy is shared among multiple particles (2E and 2V). This multi-particle final state allows a continuous range of energy distributions due to kinematic constraints and energy conservation. When the two V particles are replaced by a single massless particle M, the final state becomes 2A -> 2B + 2E + M. Since M is massless, it carries no rest mass energy, unlike the two V particles which have nonzero rest mass. This means less energy is locked in rest mass and more is available as kinetic energy for the decay products. By conservation of energy, the maximum possible energy (endpoint) of the E particles increases. The spectrum remains continuous because there are still multiple particles (2E and M) sharing energy, allowing a continuous distribution of energies. The spectrum does not become discrete because discreteness typically arises in two-body decays or decays to fixed energy states, which is not the case here. The shape of the spectrum will adjust due to the changed mass and number of emitted particles, but the key features—continuity and increased endpoint—persist. Alternative options suggesting discreteness or endpoint decrease contradict conservation of energy and multi-particle kinematics. Therefore, the correct description is that the spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape and the endpoint increases.
