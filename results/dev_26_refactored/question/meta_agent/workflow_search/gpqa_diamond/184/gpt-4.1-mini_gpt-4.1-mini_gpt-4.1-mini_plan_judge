proposed answer: The Hamiltonian operator is given by H = ε (σ · n), where σ = (σ_x, σ_y, σ_z) are the Pauli spin matrices and n is a unit vector. The Pauli matrices each have eigenvalues ±1. Since n is a unit vector, the operator σ · n is Hermitian with eigenvalues ±1. This is because σ · n represents the spin operator projected along the direction n, and the eigenvalues correspond to spin up and spin down states along that direction. Multiplying by ε scales these eigenvalues by ε, so the eigenvalues of H are ±ε. The factor ħ/2 does not appear here because the Hamiltonian is expressed directly in terms of σ, not the spin operator S = (ħ/2)σ. If the Hamiltonian were expressed in terms of S, the eigenvalues would be ±(ε ħ/2), but since it is in terms of σ, the eigenvalues are ±ε. The options involving ±ε ħ/2 or ±ħ/2 correspond to the spin operator S, not σ, and are therefore not correct in this context. The eigenvalues ±1 alone are dimensionless and do not incorporate the energy scale ε, so they are also incorrect. Therefore, the correct eigenvalues are +ε and -ε, corresponding to choice A). This conclusion is consistent with the mathematical properties of Pauli matrices, the definition of the Hamiltonian, and the physical interpretation of spin operators in quantum mechanics.
