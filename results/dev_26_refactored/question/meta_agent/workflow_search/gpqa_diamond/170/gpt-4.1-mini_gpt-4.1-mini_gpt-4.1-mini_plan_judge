proposed answer: The problem requires ranking six benzene derivatives substituted with different groups according to the increasing weight fraction of the para-bromo isomer formed during electrophilic bromination. The substituents are: 1) CH3 (methyl), 2) COOC2H5 (ethyl benzoate), 3) Cl (chlorobenzene), 4) NO2 (nitrobenzene), 5) C2H5 (ethyl), and 6) COOH (carboxylic acid). The key factors influencing the para-isomer yield are the electronic effects (activating or deactivating) and directing effects (ortho/para or meta) of these substituents, along with steric hindrance at the ortho positions that can favor para substitution.

Step 1: Identify the nature of each substituent:
- Alkyl groups (CH3 and C2H5) are activating and ortho/para directing, increasing electron density and favoring para substitution. Ethyl is bulkier than methyl, which sterically hinders ortho substitution more and thus increases the para-isomer fraction relative to methyl.
- Halogen (Cl) is deactivating by induction but ortho/para directing by resonance. It lowers overall reactivity but directs substitution to ortho and para positions. Steric hindrance favors para substitution to some extent.
- Electron-withdrawing groups like NO2, COOH, and COOC2H5 are deactivating and meta directing, reducing para substitution significantly. Among these, NO2 is the strongest deactivator and meta director, expected to give the lowest para yield. COOH is a stronger acid and generally more deactivating than the ester COOC2H5, but the ester is also meta directing and deactivating.

Step 2: Predict relative para-isomer yields:
- Lowest para yield: NO2 (4), due to strong meta directing and strong deactivation.
- Next: COOC2H5 (2) and COOH (6), both meta directing and deactivating, with COOH typically more strongly deactivating than the ester. However, some subtle differences may exist, but generally both are low.
- Moderate para yield: Cl (3), deactivating but ortho/para directing.
- Highest para yield: CH3 (1) and C2H5 (5), activating and ortho/para directing, with ethyl (5) likely giving higher para fraction due to greater steric hindrance at ortho positions.

Step 3: Evaluate the given choices.
Choice 2: '4<2<6<3<1<5' corresponds to NO2 < ester < acid < Cl < methyl < ethyl.
This order aligns well with the expected electronic and steric considerations.

Step 4: Consider alternative choices.
- Other choices either misplace the meta directors or the relative order of acid and ester or incorrectly rank halogen or alkyl groups.

Step 5: Conclusion.
The best-supported ranking, considering electronic effects, directing effects, and steric hindrance, is choice 2 (B). This is consistent with both electronic activation/deactivation and steric effects influencing para-isomer yield.

Therefore, the answer is B).

proposed answer: The problem requires ranking six monosubstituted benzene derivatives (1: CH3, 2: COOC2H5, 3: Cl, 4: NO2, 5: C2H5, 6: COOH) in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-bromo isomer formed upon electrophilic bromination. The key factors influencing this ranking are the electronic effects of substituents (activating or deactivating), their directing effects (ortho/para or meta), steric hindrance affecting ortho vs para substitution, and the molecular weights affecting the weight fraction calculation.

Step 1: Electronic and Directing Effects
- NO2 (4) is strongly electron-withdrawing and meta-directing, leading to minimal para substitution.
- COOH (6) and COOC2H5 (2) are also electron-withdrawing and meta-directing but less strongly than NO2.
- Cl (3) is deactivating but ortho/para directing due to resonance.
- CH3 (1) and C2H5 (5) are activating and ortho/para directing.

Step 2: Steric Effects and Para/Ortho Ratios
- Alkyl groups (CH3, C2H5) increase electron density and sterically hinder ortho positions, favoring para substitution.
- Cl is smaller, so ortho substitution competes more, but resonance still favors para.
- Meta-directing groups have low para substitution.

Step 3: Molecular Weight Influence
- Heavier substituents increase weight fraction for the same mole fraction.
- COOC2H5 is heavier than COOH and NO2, but its para substitution is still low due to meta-directing nature.

Step 4: Empirical and Theoretical Integration
- Para fraction order (lowest to highest) by substituent effect and sterics: NO2 < COOH < COOC2H5 < CH3 < C2H5 < Cl.
- This order matches choice D: '4<6<2<1<5<3'.

Step 5: Justification of Choice
- Choice D correctly reflects the combined influence of electronic effects, steric hindrance, directing effects, and molecular weight on the para-isomer weight fraction.
- Other choices do not align with the comprehensive analysis and empirical data.

Therefore, choice D is the most consistent and justified answer.
