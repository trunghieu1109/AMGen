proposed answer: To determine the correct formula for the maximum speed v_max of a relativistic harmonic oscillator, we start from the principle of conservation of total energy, including relativistic effects. The total energy E at maximum displacement A (where velocity v=0) is the sum of rest mass energy and potential energy: E = mc^2 + (1/2)kA^2. At the equilibrium position (x=0), the potential energy is zero, so the total energy is purely kinetic plus rest mass energy: E = gamma * m * c^2, where gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2). Equating these energies gives gamma = 1 + (kA^2)/(2mc^2). Solving for v_max, we get v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1 / (1 + (kA^2)/(2mc^2))^2). This expression respects the relativistic speed limit (v_max < c) and reduces to the classical maximum speed sqrt(kA^2/m) when relativistic effects are negligible (kA^2 << 2mc^2). Examining the given choices: Choice A has a plus sign inside the square root leading to values greater than c, violating relativistic constraints. Choice C incorrectly omits c^2 in the denominator and also has a plus sign leading to unphysical speeds and incorrect units. Choice D is the classical non-relativistic maximum speed, which does not account for relativistic effects. Only Choice B matches the derived expression, is physically valid, and correctly incorporates relativistic energy conservation. Therefore, Choice B is the correct formula for v_max in this relativistic harmonic oscillator problem.
