proposed answer: The problem involves estimating the minimum uncertainty in the kinetic energy (ΔE) of an electron traveling at speed v = 2 × 10^8 m/s along the x-direction, given the uncertainty in its position Δx = 0.1 nm. Using the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, Δx Δp ≥ ħ/2, we calculate the uncertainty in momentum Δp. With ħ ≈ 1.055 × 10^(-34) J·s and Δx = 0.1 × 10^(-9) m, Δp ≥ ħ/(2 Δx) ≈ 5.275 × 10^(-25) kg·m/s. The electron's momentum p = mv = 9.11 × 10^(-31) kg × 2 × 10^8 m/s = 1.822 × 10^(-22) kg·m/s. The kinetic energy E = p^2/(2m), and the uncertainty in kinetic energy ΔE can be approximated by the linear approximation ΔE ≈ (dE/dp) Δp = (p/m) Δp. Substituting values, (p/m) = 1.822 × 10^(-22) / 9.11 × 10^(-31) ≈ 2 × 10^8 m/s, so ΔE ≈ 2 × 10^8 × 5.275 × 10^(-25) = 1.055 × 10^(-16) J. This value is closest to choice C) ~10^(-16) J. Although the electron's speed is relativistic (~2/3 speed of light), the non-relativistic approximation is sufficient for an order-of-magnitude estimate. Other choices differ by orders of magnitude and are inconsistent with the physics and calculations. Therefore, the best and most justified choice for the minimum uncertainty in energy ΔE is C).
