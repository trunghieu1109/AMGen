proposed answer: The Mott-Gurney equation describes the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) in a semiconductor device under specific assumptions. These assumptions are: (1) the device is trap-free, meaning no traps capture carriers and affect the current; (2) the device is single-carrier, meaning only one type of charge carrier (electron or hole) dominates conduction; (3) the contacts are Ohmic, allowing easy injection of carriers without barriers; (4) diffusion current is negligible compared to drift current, so transport is dominated by drift; and (5) there is no carrier injection barrier. Evaluating each choice: Choice A states the device is trap-free, single-carrier, with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current. This aligns perfectly with the assumptions of the Mott-Gurney equation. Choice B states the device is trap-free, single-carrier, with an Ohmic contact but negligible drift current. Negligible drift current contradicts the assumption that drift dominates transport; thus, this is invalid. Choice C states the device is two-carrier with Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current. The Mott-Gurney equation assumes single-carrier transport; two-carrier transport violates this assumption, so this is invalid. Choice D states the device is single-carrier with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current. Schottky contacts introduce injection barriers, violating the no carrier injection barrier assumption; thus, this is invalid. Therefore, only choice A correctly states the conditions under which the Mott-Gurney equation is valid.
