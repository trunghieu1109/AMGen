Iteration: Test New Architecture_169
proposed answer: The spin state is given as |psi> = (3i, 4). First, normalize the state: norm = sqrt(|3i|^2 + |4|^2) = sqrt(9 + 16) = 5. So the normalized state is |psi> = (3i/5, 4/5). The spin operator along y-direction is S_y = (ħ/2) * sigma_y, where sigma_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Applying S_y to |psi> gives S_y|psi> = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]] * [3i/5, 4/5]^T = (ħ/2) * [-4i/5, -3/5]^T. The conjugate transpose <psi| is [(-3i/5)*, (4/5)*] = [-3i/5, 4/5], since the conjugate of 3i/5 is -3i/5. The expectation value is <psi|S_y|psi> = (ħ/2) * [(-3i/5)(-4i/5) + (4/5)(-3/5)] = (ħ/2) * [(12 i^2)/25 - 12/25] = (ħ/2) * [-12/25 - 12/25] = (ħ/2) * (-24/25) = -12 ħ/25. This matches choice B). Other choices have incorrect magnitudes or signs. The calculation carefully considers normalization, complex conjugation, matrix multiplication, and inner product, consistent with quantum mechanics. Therefore, the correct answer is B).
