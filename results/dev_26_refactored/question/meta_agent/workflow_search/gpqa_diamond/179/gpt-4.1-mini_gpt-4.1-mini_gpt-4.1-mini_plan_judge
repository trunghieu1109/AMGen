proposed answer: The system consists of 13 identical charges, each with charge q = 2e = 3.204 × 10^-19 C. One charge is fixed at the center point P, and the other 12 charges are constrained to lie on the surface of a sphere of radius r = 2 m centered at P. The total electrostatic potential energy U_total of the system is the sum of two contributions: (1) the interaction energy between the central charge and each of the 12 charges on the sphere, and (2) the mutual interaction energy among the 12 charges on the sphere. 

1. Interaction energy between the central charge and the 12 charges: Each pair contributes U_center_pair = k * q^2 / r, where k = 8.988 × 10^9 N·m^2/C^2. Since there are 12 such pairs, U_center_total = 12 * k * q^2 / r.

2. Mutual interaction energy among the 12 charges on the sphere: The minimal energy configuration for 12 identical charges on a sphere is known to be the vertices of an icosahedron, which minimizes the sum of inverse distances between pairs of charges. There are C(12, 2) = 66 unique pairs. The sum S = Σ (1 / r_ij) over all pairs is known from the Thomson problem literature. Since the sphere radius is 2 m, distances scale accordingly, and the sum S scales inversely with radius.

The total electrostatic potential energy is given by:
U_total = k * q^2 * (12 / r + S)

Using known values from literature and the physical constants, the minimal total electrostatic potential energy is approximately 2.822 × 10^-26 Joules. This value matches choice A) and is physically reasonable given the scale of charges and distances. Other choices differ by orders of magnitude and are not consistent with the physics of the problem.

Therefore, the correct answer is choice A).
