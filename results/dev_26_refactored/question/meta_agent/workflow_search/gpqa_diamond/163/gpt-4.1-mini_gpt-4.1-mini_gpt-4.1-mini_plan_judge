Question: Example(question='Astronomers are studying two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2. Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.', choice1='~ 0.4', choice2='~ 0.7', choice3='~ 0.6\n', choice4='~ 1.2', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: To find the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we analyze the given data: system_1 has an orbital period P1 = 2 years and radial velocity (RV) amplitudes K1 = 10 km/s and K2 = 5 km/s; system_2 has P2 = 1 year and RV amplitudes K1 = 15 km/s and K2 = 10 km/s. The RV amplitudes are inversely proportional to the masses of the stars in each system, so the mass ratio M1/M2 = K2/K1. For system_1, M1/M2 = 5/10 = 0.5, so total mass M_total1 = M1 + M2 = 1.5 M2. For system_2, M1/M2 = 10/15 ≈ 0.6667, so total mass M_total2 = 1.6667 M2. 

Next, the total semi-major axis a_total for each system can be found from the relation a_total = (K1 + K2) * P / (2π), assuming circular orbits and edge-on inclination (since eclipses are observed). For system_1, a_total1 = (10 + 5) * 2 / (2π) = 30 / (2π). For system_2, a_total2 = (15 + 10) * 1 / (2π) = 25 / (2π). The ratio of semi-major axes is a_total1 / a_total2 = 30/25 = 1.2.

Using Kepler's third law, total mass M_total ∝ a_total^3 / P^2. Therefore, the ratio of total masses is (a_total1 / a_total2)^3 / (P1 / P2)^2 = (1.2)^3 / (2)^2 = 1.728 / 4 = 0.432. This means system_1 is about 0.43 times as massive as system_2, or roughly 0.4 times. 

This result indicates system_1 is less massive than system_2 by a factor of about 0.4, not more massive. The closest matching choice is A) ~0.4. 

Assumptions made include circular orbits (justified by sinusoidal RV curves), edge-on inclination (due to eclipses), and that RV amplitudes correspond directly to orbital velocities. Variations in inclination or eccentricity could affect the exact factor, but given the data and assumptions, choice A is the most consistent and justified answer.
