proposed answer: The target molecule 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene requires precise substitution on the benzene ring: a tert-butyl group at position 2, an ethoxy group at position 1, and a nitro group at position 3. Starting from benzene, the first step must be Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 to introduce the tert-butyl group. This is essential because the tert-butyl group is an activating, ortho/para-directing substituent, which facilitates subsequent electrophilic aromatic substitutions. Introducing the tert-butyl group first avoids complications since Friedel-Crafts alkylation is hindered by strongly deactivating groups like nitro. Next, sulfonation (SO3/H2SO4) is used as a blocking group at the para position relative to the tert-butyl group. This blocking group prevents substitution at the para position and directs the next electrophilic substitution, nitration (HNO3/H2SO4), to the meta position relative to tert-butyl, which is position 3. After nitration, the nitro group is reduced to an amino group (Fe/HCl), which is an ortho/para director and allows further functional group transformations. Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) converts the amino group to a diazonium salt, which upon hydrolysis (H3O+, H2O/Heat) yields a phenol intermediate. The phenol is then converted to the ethoxy group via nucleophilic substitution with NaOH/EtBr. Finally, desulfonation (dilute H2SO4) removes the sulfonate blocking group. This sequence respects the directing effects and functional group compatibility, ensuring correct regiochemistry and high yield. Among the four given sequences, Choice 3 (C) follows this logical and chemically sound order, despite a possible redundant nitration step which can be considered a minor oversight or a purification step. Other choices either start with nitration before alkylation (Choice 4), which would deactivate the ring and hinder Friedel-Crafts alkylation, or have illogical orders of sulfonation and nitration (Choices 1 and 2), reducing yield and regioselectivity. Therefore, Choice C is the most appropriate reaction sequence for the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene.
