Question: Example(question='In an inactive state, a transcription factor subunit awaits an activation signal from the membrane phosphorylation cascade. Upon phosphorylation on the Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, shuttles into the nucleus, and serves in gene transcription. A missense mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. You observe that a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Which of the following molecular phenotypes is most likely observed in the presence of mutation Y?', choice1='loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype', choice2='protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype', choice3='protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele', choice4='change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: The transcription factor subunit is inactive until phosphorylation on serine residues in the transactivation domain triggers its activation. Activation leads to dimerization, nuclear translocation, and gene transcription. Mutation X is a recessive loss-of-function mutation in the transactivation domain, meaning that one wild-type allele is sufficient for normal function. Mutation Y is a heterozygous dominant-negative mutation in the dimerization domain, which implies that the mutant protein interferes with the function of the wild-type protein even when the wild-type allele is present. Dominant-negative mutations in dimerization domains typically allow the mutant protein to still dimerize with the wild-type protein but form nonfunctional or deleterious complexes. This interference results in loss of function despite the presence of the wild-type protein. Considering the molecular phenotype options: (A) loss of protein dimerization would prevent interaction with the wild-type protein and thus would not produce a dominant-negative effect; (C) protein degradation affecting the wild-type allele is less typical for dominant-negative mutations in dimerization domains; (D) gain-of-function phenotype contradicts the description of mutation Y as a loss-of-function dominant-negative mutation. Therefore, the most consistent molecular phenotype is (B) protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype, where mutant and wild-type proteins form defective complexes that aggregate and impair transcription factor function. This explanation accounts for the molecular mechanism of activation, the nature of the mutations, and the typical behavior of dominant-negative mutations in dimerization domains.
