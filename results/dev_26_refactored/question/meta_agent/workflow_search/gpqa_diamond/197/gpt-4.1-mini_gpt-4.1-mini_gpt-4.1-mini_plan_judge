proposed answer: We are given the total cobalt concentration c(Co) = 10^-2 M and thiocyanate concentration [SCN-] = 0.1 M. The cumulative stability constants for the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16, corresponding to Co(SCN)+, Co(SCN)2, Co(SCN)3-, and Co(SCN)4^{2-} respectively. The problem asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, which is Co(SCN)2, relative to total cobalt. 

Step 1: Let the free Co(II) concentration be x.

Step 2: Express the concentrations of the complexes in terms of x and the given constants:
- [Co(SCN)+] = β1 * x * [SCN-] = 9 * x * 0.1 = 0.9x
- [Co(SCN)2] = β2 * x * [SCN-]^2 = 40 * x * (0.1)^2 = 40 * x * 0.01 = 0.4x
- [Co(SCN)3-] = β3 * x * [SCN-]^3 = 63 * x * (0.1)^3 = 63 * x * 0.001 = 0.063x
- [Co(SCN)4^{2-}] = β4 * x * [SCN-]^4 = 16 * x * (0.1)^4 = 16 * x * 0.0001 = 0.0016x

Step 3: The total cobalt concentration is the sum of free Co(II) and all complexed forms:
Total Co = x + 0.9x + 0.4x + 0.063x + 0.0016x = x * (1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016) = x * 2.3646

Step 4: Solve for x:
x = 0.01 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.00423 M

Step 5: Calculate the concentration of the dithiocyanato complex:
[Co(SCN)2] = 0.4 * x = 0.4 * 0.00423 = 0.00169 M

Step 6: Calculate the percentage of Co(SCN)2 relative to total cobalt:
(0.00169 / 0.01) * 100% = 16.9%

This matches choice A) 16.9%. The assumptions made include that the β values are cumulative stability constants, the free SCN- concentration remains effectively constant at 0.1 M due to its excess, and that the system is at equilibrium with no other species significantly affecting the cobalt speciation. All these assumptions are reasonable given the problem statement. Therefore, the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is approximately 16.9%.
