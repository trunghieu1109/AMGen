Iteration: Test New Architecture_190
proposed answer: The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one, which has a ketone at position 1, a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) at position 3, and an isopropenyl substituent at position 5. Step 1: Treatment with sodium hydride (NaH) deprotonates the hydroxyl group of the hydroxymethyl substituent, forming an alkoxide. This alkoxide then reacts with benzyl bromide (BnBr) to form a benzyl ether at position 3, yielding product 1. The ketone and isopropenyl group remain unchanged. Step 2: Reaction with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) in catalytic HCl converts the ketone at position 1 into a tosyl hydrazone, producing product 2. The benzyl ether and isopropenyl substituent remain intact. Step 3: Treatment of product 2 with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature initiates the Shapiro reaction, which deprotonates the tosyl hydrazone and eliminates the tosyl group, forming a vinyllithium intermediate at position 1. Quenching with aqueous ammonium chloride protonates this intermediate, resulting in an alkene at position 1 (product 3). The benzyl ether and isopropyl substituent remain unchanged. Step 4: Catalytic hydrogenation with Pd/C under hydrogen atmosphere reduces the alkene at position 1 back to a saturated cyclohexane ring and simultaneously cleaves the benzyl ether protecting group via hydrogenolysis, regenerating the free hydroxyl group at position 3. The isopropyl substituent remains unchanged. Therefore, product 4 is a cyclohexane ring substituted at position 3 with a free hydroxymethyl group and at position 5 with an isopropyl group. Among the given options, only option A) '(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol' correctly describes this structure. Other options represent intermediates or structures inconsistent with the reaction sequence: B) is the tosyl hydrazone intermediate, C) is the benzyl-protected ether intermediate, and D) contains a butyl substituent not introduced in the sequence. This conclusion is consistent with the known reactivity of the reagents and the transformations described, including alkylation, hydrazone formation, Shapiro reaction, and catalytic hydrogenation with hydrogenolysis of benzyl ethers.
