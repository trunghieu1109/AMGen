Question: Let $p$ be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $n^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$. Find the least positive integer $m$ such that $m^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$.
proposed answer: The problem requires finding the smallest positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2, where p is the least prime for which there exists a positive integer n such that n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2. From the sub-task 1, we determined that p = 3. Therefore, we need to find the smallest m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 9. This means m^4 ≡ -1 ≡ 8 (mod 9). Testing small values of m, we find that m = 2 works because 2^4 + 1 = 17, and 17 ≡ 0 (mod 9). Thus, m = 2 is the correct answer.
