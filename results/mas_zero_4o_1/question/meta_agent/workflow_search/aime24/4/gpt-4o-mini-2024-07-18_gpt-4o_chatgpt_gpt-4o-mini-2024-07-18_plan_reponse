        "response": "The problem requires finding the smallest positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2, where p is the least prime for which there exists a positive integer n such that n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2. From the sub-task 1, we determined that p = 3. Therefore, we need to find the smallest m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 9. This means m^4 \u2261 -1 \u2261 8 (mod 9). Testing small values of m, we find that m = 2 works because 2^4 + 1 = 17, and 17 \u2261 0 (mod 9). Thus, m = 2 is the correct answer.\n\nAnswer:2",
