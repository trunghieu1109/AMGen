    <pre>Related original question:

There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\times5$ grid such that: 

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 1: Determine the maximum number of rows and columns that can be filled with chips of a single color without violating the conditions. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent GKBh:
To satisfy the conditions, we need to fill rows and columns with chips of a single color such that any additional chip would violate the conditions. This means we can fill a certain number of rows and columns with one color, and the remaining rows and columns with the other color. Since we have 25 chips of each color, the maximum number of rows and columns that can be filled with chips of a single color is 5, because filling more would require more than 25 chips of that color.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent GKBh:
5

### Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1, calculate the total number of chips that can be placed without violating the conditions. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent ZzsA:
Based on the solution to Sub-task 1, we can fill 5 rows with one color and 5 columns with the other color. This means placing 5 chips in each of the 5 rows of one color, using 25 chips, and similarly placing 5 chips in each of the 5 columns of the other color, also using 25 chips. Thus, we use all 25 chips of each color, totaling 50 chips.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent ZzsA:
50

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 3: Based on the outputs of sub-task 1 and 2, verify that the placement is optimal and any additional chip would violate the conditions.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry (for example, 300
[TOO_HARD]
Suggestion:...) and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>The placement described in the previous sub-tasks is optimal because it uses all 25 chips of each color, filling 5 rows with one color and 5 columns with the other color. This configuration ensures that each row and each column is filled with chips of a single color, and any additional chip would require placing it in a row or column that already has chips of both colors, violating the conditions. Therefore, the placement is optimal and any additional chip would indeed violate the conditions.

Answer:The placement is optimal and any additional chip would violate the conditions.</pre>
