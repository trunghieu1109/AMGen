Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\\times5$ grid such that: \n\neach cell contains at most one chip\nall chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour\nany additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.",

        "n": "MAS-ZERO Workflow 29",
        "response": "The placement described in the previous sub-tasks is optimal because it uses all 25 chips of each color, filling 5 rows with one color and 5 columns with the other color. This configuration ensures that each row and each column is filled with chips of a single color, and any additional chip would require placing it in a row or column that already has chips of both colors, violating the conditions. Therefore, the placement is optimal and any additional chip would indeed violate the conditions.\n\nAnswer:The placement is optimal and any additional chip would violate the conditions.",
