Question: Let $\triangle ABC$ have circumcenter $O$ and incenter $I$ with $\overline{IA}\perp\overline{OI}$, circumradius $13$, and inradius $6$. Find $AB\cdot AC$.
proposed answer: The condition \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \) implies that the triangle is right-angled at \( A \). This is a known geometric property. Given the circumradius \( R = 13 \), the hypotenuse \( BC = 26 \) because in a right triangle, the circumradius is half the hypotenuse. The inradius \( r = 6 \) gives the area \( A = rs = 6s \). The semi-perimeter \( s = 13 \) was found earlier. The area \( A = 78 \) can also be expressed as \( \frac{1}{2} \times AB \times AC \). Since \( BC = 26 \), we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find \( AB \cdot AC \).
