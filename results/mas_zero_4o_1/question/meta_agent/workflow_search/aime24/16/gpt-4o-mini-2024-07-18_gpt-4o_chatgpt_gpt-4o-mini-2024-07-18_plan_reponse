        "response": "The condition \\( \\overline{IA} \\perp \\overline{OI} \\) implies that the triangle is right-angled at \\( A \\). This is a known geometric property. Given the circumradius \\( R = 13 \\), the hypotenuse \\( BC = 26 \\) because in a right triangle, the circumradius is half the hypotenuse. The inradius \\( r = 6 \\) gives the area \\( A = rs = 6s \\). The semi-perimeter \\( s = 13 \\) was found earlier. The area \\( A = 78 \\) can also be expressed as \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times AB \\times AC \\). Since \\( BC = 26 \\), we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find \\( AB \\cdot AC \\).\n\nAnswer:240",
