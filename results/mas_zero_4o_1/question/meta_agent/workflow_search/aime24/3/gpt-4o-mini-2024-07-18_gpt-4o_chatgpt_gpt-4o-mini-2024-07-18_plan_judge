Question: Define $f(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{4}|$. Find the number of intersections of the graphs of \[y=4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \quad\text{ and }\quad x=4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))).\]
proposed answer: Both functions y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))) have a range of [0, 1]. To find the intersection points, we need to find points (x, y) such that y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))) are equal. This implies solving the equations 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) = y and 4 g(f(cos(3πy))) = x for x = y. Since both functions have the same range, we need to consider when g(f(sin(2πx))) = g(f(cos(3πy))). The periodic nature of the trigonometric functions and the piecewise linear nature of g(f(x)) suggests that there will be multiple intersections. We need to determine how many such intersections occur within the given range.
