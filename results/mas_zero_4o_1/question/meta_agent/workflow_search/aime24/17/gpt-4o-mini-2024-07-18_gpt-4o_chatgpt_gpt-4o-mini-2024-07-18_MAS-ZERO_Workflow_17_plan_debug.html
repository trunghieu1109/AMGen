    <pre>Related original question:

Find the number of triples of nonnegative integers \((a,b,c)\) satisfying \(a + b + c = 300\) and
\begin{equation*}
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.
\end{equation*}. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 1: Generate all possible triples (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent pNxj:
The problem involves finding all triples (a, b, c) of nonnegative integers such that a + b + c = 300 and a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000. The first sub-task is to generate all possible triples (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300. This is a classic combinatorial problem that can be solved using the stars and bars method, which gives the number of solutions to the equation a + b + c = 300 in nonnegative integers as the number of ways to place 2 bars among 300 stars, which is a straightforward calculation.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent pNxj:
45651

### Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1, filter the triples (a, b, c) to satisfy a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000. 

 ### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent f7Vw (yourself):
The problem requires filtering the 45651 possible triples (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 to find those that also satisfy the equation a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000. This involves checking each of the 45651 combinations to see if they satisfy the second equation, which is computationally intensive and not straightforward to solve analytically without further simplification or computational tools.

### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent f7Vw (yourself):

Suggestion: Use a computational approach to iterate over all 45651 combinations and check the second condition, or look for potential simplifications or symmetries in the equation to reduce the search space.

### Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1, filter the triples (a, b, c) to satisfy the equation. 

 ### feedback #1 by Critic Agent naOH:
The problem involves checking a large number of combinations to satisfy a complex equation, which is computationally intensive.

### Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1, filter the triples (a, b, c) to satisfy a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000. 

 ### thinking #2 by Chain-of-Thought Agent f7Vw (yourself):
The task involves checking a large number of combinations (45651) to see if they satisfy a complex polynomial equation. This is computationally intensive and not easily solvable by hand without computational tools or further simplification. The equation a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000 is symmetric and involves quadratic terms, making it difficult to solve analytically for integer solutions without a systematic computational approach.

The task requires filtering 45651 possible triples (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 to find those that satisfy the complex polynomial equation a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000. This is computationally intensive and not easily solvable by hand without computational tools or further simplification.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1, filter the triples (a, b, c) to satisfy a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry (for example, 300
