Question: Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.
[asy] size(10cm); usepackage("tikz");label("egin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(2,0)--(2,3)--(5,3)--(5,8)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}",origin); label("\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(0,3)--(3,3)--(3,5)--(8,5)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}",E); [/asy]
proposed answer: The problem involves counting paths on an 8x8 grid that change direction exactly four times. The sub-task 2 answer provided is 2800, which represents the number of valid paths for each configuration of direction changes. Since sub-task 3 asks to aggregate these results, and the answer to sub-task 2 already provides the total number of such paths, the answer to sub-task 3 is the same as the answer to sub-task 2.

Answer:2800
Extracted answer: 2800
Correct answer: 294
