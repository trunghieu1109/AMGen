The sub-task 2 answer provided is 2800, which represents the number of valid paths for each configuration of direction changes. Since sub-task 3 asks to aggregate these results, and the answer to sub-task 2 already provides the total number of such paths, the answer to sub-task 3 is the same as the answer to sub-task 2.\n\nAnswer:2800",
