    <pre>Related original question:

Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.
[asy] size(10cm); usepackage(&#34;tikz&#34;);label(&#34;egin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(2,0)--(2,3)--(5,3)--(5,8)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}&#34;,origin); label(&#34;\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(0,3)--(3,3)--(3,5)--(8,5)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}&#34;,E); [/asy].

### Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1, calculate the number of valid paths for each configuration of direction changes. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent manC:
Each configuration of direction changes corresponds to a partition of the 8 R&#39;s and 8 U&#39;s into segments. For each configuration, we need to determine the number of ways to assign a specific number of R&#39;s and U&#39;s to each segment such that the total is 8 R&#39;s and 8 U&#39;s. For example, in the configuration (R, U, R, U, R), we could have segments of lengths (a, b, c, d, e) for R&#39;s and (f, g, h, i) for U&#39;s, where a + c + e = 8 and b + d = 8, f + h = 8, and g + i = 8. The number of ways to assign the lengths is given by the multinomial coefficient. We calculate this for each configuration and sum the results.

### Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 2, aggregate the results to find the total number of paths that change direction exactly four times. 

 ### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent KFrt (yourself):
The problem involves counting paths on an 8x8 grid that change direction exactly four times. The sub-task 2 answer provided is 2800, which represents the number of valid paths for each configuration of direction changes. Since sub-task 3 asks to aggregate these results, and the answer to sub-task 2 already provides the total number of such paths, the answer to sub-task 3 is the same as the answer to sub-task 2.
