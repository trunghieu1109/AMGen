Question: Alice chooses a set $A$ of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets $B$ of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of $B$ belongs to $A$. Bob's list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A.
proposed answer: From sub-task 2, we determined that the elements of set A are 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 5, and 4. To find the sum of the elements of A, we simply add these numbers together: 11 + 10 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 5 + 4 = 54.

Answer:54
