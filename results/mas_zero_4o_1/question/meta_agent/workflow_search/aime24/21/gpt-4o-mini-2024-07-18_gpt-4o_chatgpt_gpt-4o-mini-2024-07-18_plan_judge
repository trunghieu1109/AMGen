Question: Find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon ($12$-gon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The diagram below shows three of those rectangles.
[asy] unitsize(0.6 inch); for(int i=0; i<360; i+=30) { dot(dir(i), 4+black); draw(dir(i)--dir(i+30)); } draw(dir(120)--dir(330)); filldraw(dir(210)--dir(240)--dir(30)--dir(60)--cycle, mediumgray, linewidth(1.5)); draw((0,0.366)--(0.366,0), linewidth(1.5)); [/asy]
proposed answer: The debate results indicate that there are 90 possible pairs of parallel lines that can form rectangles inside the regular dodecagon. Each combination of two pairs of parallel lines forms a rectangle due to the symmetry and structure of the dodecagon. Therefore, the number of rectangles is equal to the number of such valid pairs, which is 90.

Answer:90
Extracted answer: 90
Correct answer: 315
