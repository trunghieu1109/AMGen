        "response": "The debate results indicate that there are 90 possible pairs of parallel lines that can form rectangles inside the regular dodecagon. Each combination of two pairs of parallel lines forms a rectangle due to the symmetry and structure of the dodecagon. Therefore, the number of rectangles is equal to the number of such valid pairs, which is 90.\n\nAnswer:90",
