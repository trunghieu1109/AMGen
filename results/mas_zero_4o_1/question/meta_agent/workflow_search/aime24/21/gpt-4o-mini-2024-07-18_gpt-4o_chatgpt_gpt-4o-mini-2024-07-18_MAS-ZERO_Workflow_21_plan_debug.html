    <pre>Related original question:

Find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon ($12$-gon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The diagram below shows three of those rectangles.
[asy] unitsize(0.6 inch); for(int i=0; i&lt;360; i+=30) { dot(dir(i), 4+black); draw(dir(i)--dir(i+30)); } draw(dir(120)--dir(330)); filldraw(dir(210)--dir(240)--dir(30)--dir(60)--cycle, mediumgray, linewidth(1.5)); draw((0,0.366)--(0.366,0), linewidth(1.5)); [/asy].

### Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 2, count the number of rectangles formed by ensuring the selected pairs form a closed rectangle shape. 

 ### thinking by Debate Agent 0QWC:
The task is to count the number of rectangles that can be formed by selecting two pairs of parallel lines in a regular dodecagon. The previous sub-tasks determined that there are 90 possible pairs of parallel lines. Each combination of two pairs of parallel lines forms a rectangle due to the symmetry and structure of the dodecagon. Thus, the number of rectangles is equal to the number of such valid pairs.

### thinking by Debate Agent 6Sof:
The task is to count the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon by selecting two pairs of parallel lines. According to the previous sub-task, there are 90 possible pairs of parallel lines that can form rectangles. Given the symmetry and structure of the dodecagon, each pair of parallel lines can form a rectangle with another pair, ensuring a closed rectangle shape is possible. Thus, the number of rectangles is directly given by the number of pair combinations, which is 90.

### answer by Debate Agent 0QWC:
90

### answer by Debate Agent 6Sof:
90

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 3: Based on the debate results, provide the final count of rectangles.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry (for example, 300
[TOO_HARD]
Suggestion:...) and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
