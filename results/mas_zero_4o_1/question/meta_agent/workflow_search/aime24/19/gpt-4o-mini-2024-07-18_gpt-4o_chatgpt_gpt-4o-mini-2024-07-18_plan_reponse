        "response": "The product involves 13th roots of unity and simplifies to a form that can be related to cyclotomic polynomials. The expression (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) can be rewritten using properties of roots of unity, but the calculation is complex. The product of all terms is zero, as indicated by the sub-task 2 answer, suggesting the product evaluates to zero modulo 1000.\n\nAnswer:0",
