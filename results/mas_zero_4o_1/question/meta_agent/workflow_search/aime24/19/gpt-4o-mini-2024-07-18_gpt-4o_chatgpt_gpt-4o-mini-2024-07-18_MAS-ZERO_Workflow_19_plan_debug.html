    <pre>Related original question:

Let $\omega\neq 1$ be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\]
is divided by 1000.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1, compute the product of all terms. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent JE21:
We have a product involving 13th roots of unity. The expression simplifies to (1 - omega^k)^2 + 1. The product is over all k from 0 to 12, which are all distinct roots of unity except omega^0 = 1. The simplification can be used to calculate the product, but it involves complex numbers and requires careful handling of root properties. The product of all 13th roots of unity (excluding 1) is related to the cyclotomic polynomial, which is a more advanced topic.

Suggestion: Consider using properties of cyclotomic polynomials and symmetry of roots of unity to simplify the product.

### Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 2, find the remainder when the product is divided by 1000. 

 ### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent j9Mp (yourself):
The product involves 13th roots of unity and simplifies to a form that can be related to cyclotomic polynomials. The product of all 13th roots of unity (excluding 1) is related to the cyclotomic polynomial \( \Phi_{13}(x) \). The expression \( (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) \) can be rewritten using properties of roots of unity, but the calculation is complex. The product of all terms is zero, as indicated by the sub-task 2 answer, suggesting the product evaluates to zero modulo 1000.
