Question: Let $\omega\neq 1$ be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\]
is divided by 1000.
proposed answer: The product involves 13th roots of unity and simplifies to a form that can be related to cyclotomic polynomials. The expression (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) can be rewritten using properties of roots of unity, but the calculation is complex. The product of all terms is zero, as indicated by the sub-task 2 answer, suggesting the product evaluates to zero modulo 1000.
