Question: Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). Then \(OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\).
proposed answer: The unique point C on line AB that does not belong to any segment PQ of unit length in the first quadrant, except for AB itself, has been determined as C(1/2) = (1/4, sqrt(3)/4). The distance OC is calculated using the Euclidean distance formula from the origin O(0,0) to C(1/4, sqrt(3)/4), which is sqrt((1/4)^2 + (sqrt(3)/4)^2). Simplifying this, we obtain sqrt(1/16 + 3/16) = sqrt(4/16) = 1/2. Therefore, OC^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4. The fraction 1/4 is already in its simplest form with relatively prime integers p = 1 and q = 4. Thus, p + q = 1 + 4 = 5.
