Question: A list of positive integers has the following properties:
$\bullet$ The sum of the items in the list is $30$.
$\bullet$ The unique mode of the list is $9$.
$\bullet$ The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.
Find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.
proposed answer: The task is to find a list of positive integers that sum to 30, with 9 as the unique mode, and a median that is not in the list. The list must have an even number of elements for the median to be an integer not in the list. The list [9, 9, 5, 5, 1, 1] satisfies these conditions: the sum is 30, the mode is 9, and the median is 3, which is not in the list. The sum of the squares of the elements in this list is calculated as 9^2 + 9^2 + 5^2 + 5^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 81 + 81 + 25 + 25 + 1 + 1 = 214. The previous attempts and feedback confirm that this list and calculation are correct.
