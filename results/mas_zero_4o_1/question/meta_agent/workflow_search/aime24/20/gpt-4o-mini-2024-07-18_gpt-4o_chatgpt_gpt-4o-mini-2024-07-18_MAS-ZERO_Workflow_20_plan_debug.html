    <pre>Related original question:

Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers..

### Sub-task 2: Based on the properties from sub-task 1, calculate the range of possible b-beautiful integers for a given base b. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent 3QNY:
To determine the range of possible b-beautiful integers for a given base b, we consider that a b-beautiful integer n is expressed as n = ab + c, where a and c are digits in base b. This means 1 &lt;= a &lt; b and 0 &lt;= c &lt; b, and a + c = sqrt(n) must be a perfect square. The smallest two-digit number in base b is b, and the largest is b^2 - 1. Therefore, n must be a perfect square between b and b^2 - 1. We need to find all such n for which there exist digits a and c such that a + c is also a perfect square.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent 3QNY:
The range of possible b-beautiful integers for a given base b is between b and b^2 - 1, where n = ab + c is a perfect square and a + c is also a perfect square.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 2, count the number of b-beautiful integers for each base b and identify the smallest base b for which there are more than ten such integers.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry (for example, 300
[TOO_HARD]
Suggestion:...) and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>To find the smallest base b for which there are more than ten b-beautiful integers, we need to count the number of integers n = ab + c that are perfect squares and have a + c as a perfect square, for each base b. The range of n is from b to b^2 - 1. We need to check each n in this range to see if it satisfies the conditions. This involves iterating over possible values of a and c, checking if n is a perfect square, and if a + c is a perfect square. We continue this process for increasing values of b until we find a base with more than ten such integers.
