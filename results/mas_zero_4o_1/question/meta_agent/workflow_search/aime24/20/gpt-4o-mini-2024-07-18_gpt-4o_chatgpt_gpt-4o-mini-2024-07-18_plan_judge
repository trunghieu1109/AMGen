Question: Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.
proposed answer: To find the smallest base b for which there are more than ten b-beautiful integers, we need to count the number of integers n = ab + c that are perfect squares and have a + c as a perfect square, for each base b. The range of n is from b to b^2 - 1. We need to check each n in this range to see if it satisfies the conditions. This involves iterating over possible values of a and c, checking if n is a perfect square, and if a + c is a perfect square. We continue this process for increasing values of b until we find a base with more than ten such integers.
