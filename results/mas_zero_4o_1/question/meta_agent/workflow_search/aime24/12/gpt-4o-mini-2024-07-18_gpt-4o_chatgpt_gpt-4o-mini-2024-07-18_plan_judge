Question: Find the largest possible real part of \[(75+117i)z+\frac{96+144i}{z}\]where $z$ is a complex number with $|z|=4$.
proposed answer: The real part of the expression is given by 324 cos(θ). The cosine function achieves its maximum value of 1 when θ = 0 or any integer multiple of 2π. Therefore, the value of θ that maximizes the real part is 0.
