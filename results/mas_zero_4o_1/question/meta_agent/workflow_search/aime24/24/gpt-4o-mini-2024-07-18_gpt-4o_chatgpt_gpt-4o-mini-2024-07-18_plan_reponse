        "response": "To verify the solution for |log2(x^4y^3z^2)|, we need to ensure the calculations and logic are correct. We have the system of equations: log2(x/yz) = 1/2, log2(y/xz) = 1/3, and log2(z/xy) = 1/4. From these, we can express x, y, and z in terms of each other and powers of 2. Solving these equations, we find x = yz * 2^(1/2), y = xz * 2^(1/3), and z = xy * 2^(1/4). We need to find |log2(x^4y^3z^2)|. Substituting the expressions for x, y, and z into x^4y^3z^2, we simplify to find that x^4y^3z^2 = 2^(1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4). Calculating the sum of these exponents: 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 = 6/12 + 4/12 + 3/12 = 13/12. Therefore, x^4y^3z^2 = 2^(13/12), and the absolute value of the logarithm base 2 of this is |13/12| = 13/12. Thus, m = 13 and n = 12, so m + n = 25. The solution is verified to be correct.\n\nAnswer:25",
