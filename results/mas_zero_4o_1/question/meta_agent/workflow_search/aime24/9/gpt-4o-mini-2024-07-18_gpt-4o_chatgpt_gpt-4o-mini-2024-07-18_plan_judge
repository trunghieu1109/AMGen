Question: Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.
proposed answer: To find the probability of winning the grand prize given that Jen won a prize, we need to calculate the number of ways to win a prize and the number of ways to win the grand prize. The grand prize is won if all 4 of Jen's numbers match the 4 drawn numbers, which is 1 way. To win a prize, at least 2 of Jen's numbers must match the drawn numbers. We need to calculate the number of ways to have exactly 2, 3, or 4 matches. The total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is C(10, 4). The number of ways to have exactly 2 matches is C(4, 2) * C(6, 2), for 3 matches is C(4, 3) * C(6, 1), and for 4 matches is C(4, 4). Adding these gives the total number of ways to win a prize. The probability of winning the grand prize given a prize is the number of ways to win the grand prize divided by the number of ways to win a prize. This probability is m/n, where m and n are relatively prime. The answer m+n is 5.
