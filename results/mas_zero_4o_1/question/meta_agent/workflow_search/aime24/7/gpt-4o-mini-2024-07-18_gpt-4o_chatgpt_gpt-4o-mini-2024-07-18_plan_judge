Question: There exist real numbers $x$ and $y$, both greater than 1, such that $\log_x\left(y^x\right)=\log_y\left(x^{4y}\right)=10$. Find $xy$.
proposed answer: From sub-task 2, we have determined that x = 100 and y = 10. To find the product xy, we simply multiply these two values together. Therefore, xy = 100 * 10.
