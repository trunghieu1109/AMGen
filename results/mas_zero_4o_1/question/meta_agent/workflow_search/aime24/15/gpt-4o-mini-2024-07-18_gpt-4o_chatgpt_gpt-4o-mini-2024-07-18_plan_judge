Question: Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.
proposed answer: The problem states that each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, so the task is to find how many residents own all three of the other items: a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, and a garden spade. We are given that 234 residents own exactly three of these items. Since owning all three of these items implies owning all four (because everyone owns a bag of candy hearts), the number of residents owning all four items is 234. The feedback confirms that this reasoning is correct.
