Question: Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.
proposed answer: From the previous sub-task, we have determined that N is 7770. When 7770 is divided by 1000, the quotient Q is 7 and the remainder R is 770. Thus, Q + R = 7 + 770.
