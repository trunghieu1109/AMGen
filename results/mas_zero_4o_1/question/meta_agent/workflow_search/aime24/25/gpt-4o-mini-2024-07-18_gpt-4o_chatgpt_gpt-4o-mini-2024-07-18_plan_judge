Question: Let ABCDEF be a convex equilateral hexagon in which all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle whose sides are extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. Find the side length of the hexagon.
proposed answer: The problem involves finding the side length of a special equilateral hexagon based on the side lengths of a triangle formed by extensions of its sides. The key insight is that the side length of the hexagon is related to the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the triangle's side lengths. The triangle has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. The GCD of these numbers is 20, which suggests that the side length of the hexagon is 20. The previous sub-task 2 answer of 60 was incorrect, as confirmed by the critic agent's feedback.

Answer:20
Extracted answer: 20
Correct answer: 080
