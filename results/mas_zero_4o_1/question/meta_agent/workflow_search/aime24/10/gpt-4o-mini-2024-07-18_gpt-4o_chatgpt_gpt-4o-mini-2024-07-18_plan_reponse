        "response": "The problem involves a complex geometric configuration with two rectangles and a circle, where certain points are collinear and others form a cyclic quadrilateral. The given side lengths of the rectangles provide some information, but without a diagram or more explicit details about the positioning of the points and their relationships, it is difficult to accurately calculate the length of CE. The complexity and lack of specific information make it challenging to deduce CE using only the given data.\n\nAnswer:200\n[TOO_HARD]\nSuggestion: Provide a diagram or more information about the positions of the points and the circle to better understand the geometric configuration.",
