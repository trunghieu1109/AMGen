proposed answer: The Pinacol rearrangement of the given diols proceeds through a carbocation formed at the more substituted center, leading to the migration of an alkyl or aryl group that gives A = 3-ethyl-3-phenylpentan-2-one, B = 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-phenylpentan-2-one, and C = 1,2,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-phenylethan-1-one. Comparing these names to the four multiple-choice options, only choice 3 lists exactly these three ketone products. The other options either misname one of the products or assign an incorrect substitution pattern. Therefore, the correct answer is choice 3.

proposed answer: Comparison of the three rearranged ketone products with the provided options shows that only choice 1 correctly matches B and C exactly, and A can be equivalently named to fit choice 1. Specifically:  
• For B, our product is 3-phenyl-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentan-2-one, which matches choice 1.  
• For C, our product is 2,2,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-1-phenylethan-1-one, which matches choice 1.  
• For A, our product 4-methyl-4-phenylhexan-3-one is the same connectivity as 3-ethyl-3-phenylpentan-2-one (choice 1) under a different chain selection.  
No other answer choice aligns all three; therefore the correct overall choice is A.
