Question: Example(question='5-fluorocyclopenta-1,3-diene is reacted with maleic anhydride. What is the major product?', choice1='(3aR,4R,7S,7aS,8r)-8-fluoro-3a,4,7,7a-tetrahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione', choice2='(3aR,4R,7S,7aS,8s)-8-fluoro-3a,4,7,7a-tetrahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione', choice3='(3aR,4S,7R,7aS,8s)-8-fluoro-3a,4,7,7a-tetrahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione', choice4='(3aR,4S,7R,7aS,8r)-8-fluoro-3a,4,7,7a-tetrahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_5_145
proposed answer: The Diels–Alder reaction between 5-fluorocyclopenta-1,3-diene and maleic anhydride follows the endo rule, positioning the electron-withdrawing anhydride syn to the diene and placing the fluorine substituent on the exo face. This delivers the cycloadduct with stereochemical descriptors (3aR,4R,7S,7aS,8r). Comparing each choice: only choice A) exactly matches these R/S assignments and the fluorine configuration. Choices B–D either invert the 8-position (8s) or other stereocenters. Therefore, the major product is choice A).
