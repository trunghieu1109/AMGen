        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The question asks for clear definitions of each symbol and the physical context of a moving point charge producing electromagnetic potentials observed at a field point at a later time. To answer correctly, I must identify the charge q, its trajectory s(t), the observation point r, the retarded time t_r (where the fields were actually \u201cemitted\u201d), the vector d from the charge\u2019s retarded position to the observation point, the charge\u2019s velocity v at t_r, and the fundamental constants c, \u03b5_0, and \u03bc_0. Each of these enters the Li\u00e9nard\u2013Wiechert potential expressions. Therefore, I'll explain each symbol in turn and why it appears in the problem.; answer - We have a point charge q moving along a known path s(t) in an inertial frame whose origin is O. At lab time t we measure the fields at the field point r (vector from O to the detector). Because changes in the charge\u2019s motion propagate at the finite speed c, the potentials at (r,t) depend on the charge\u2019s state at an earlier (\u201cretarded\u201d) time t_r defined implicitly by |r \u2013 s(t_r)| = c\u2009[t \u2013 t_r]. Denote d = r \u2013 s(t_r), the vector from the charge\u2019s retarded position to the observation point. The charge\u2019s velocity at emission is v = s\u0307(t_r). The fundamental constants are c, the speed of light in vacuum; \u03b5_0, the vacuum permittivity; and \u03bc_0, the vacuum permeability (with \u03bc_0\u2009\u03b5_0\u2009c^2 = 1). These quantities enter the Li\u00e9nard\u2013Wiechert scalar and vector potentials describing the fields of the moving charge.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - To derive the potentials of a moving point charge we start from the Lorenz-gauge retarded potentials in electrodynamics: \n\nV(r,t)=1/(4\u03c0\u03b5\u2080)\u222b\u03c1(r\u2032,t_r)/|r\u2013r\u2032| d\u00b3r\u2032 ,\nA(r,t)=\u03bc\u2080/(4\u03c0)\u222bJ(r\u2032,t_r)/|r\u2013r\u2032| d\u00b3r\u2032 ,\n\nwith t_r defined by the retardation condition |r\u2013r\u2032|=c(t\u2013t_r).
