Question: Example(question='Imagine a point charge q is moving with a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$, where t is time, with respect to the origin. Let $\\vec{r}$ be the field point, where the field is observed, with respect to the origin of the same reference frame, and  $\\vec{d}$ be the vector from the point where the electromagnetic field was generated at some earlier time $tr$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$. The velocity of the moving charge q at the field generating instant $tr$ is $\\vec{v}$. What are the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (\\vec{A}) at time t, satisfying $t > tr$, and position $\\vec{r}$? In obtaining the expressions, use the notation of $c->$ light speed in vacuum, $\\epsilono ->$ permitivity of free space and $\\mu_o$ is the permeability.', choice1='V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)\n', choice2='V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}', choice3='V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)\n', choice4='V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}\n', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: The Liénard–Wiechert potentials for a moving point charge in the Lorenz gauge are
V(r,t) = q c / [4πε₀ (c|d| – d·v)]
and
A(r,t) = μ₀ q c v / [4π (c|d| – d·v)]
where d = r – s(t_r) and v = v(t_r). Choice 2 exactly matches these expressions (identifying |d| as d). Choices 1 and 3 use the static Coulomb form and wrong velocity dependence, and choice 4 has the wrong sign in the denominator. Therefore the correct answer is B).
