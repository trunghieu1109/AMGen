Question: Example(question='We would like to dissolve (at 25°С) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm3 total volume. What is the minimum volume (cm3) of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution and what is the pH of the resulting solution?', choice1='pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3', choice2='pH 2.69; 30.09 cm3', choice3='pH 3.16; 32.14 cm3', choice4='pH 4.94; 20.40 cm3', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_6_162
proposed answer: First, calculate moles of Fe(OH)3: 0.1 g/(106.9 g·mol⁻¹)=9.36×10⁻⁴ mol. Dissolving requires 3 H⁺ per mole → 2.81×10⁻³ mol H⁺. At 0.1 M acid this needs V=2.81×10⁻³ mol/0.1 M=28.1 cm³, which matches only choice A’s 28.05 cm³. After dissolution Fe³⁺ hydrolyzes, giving an acidic pH around 2.04, again matching choice A. No other option fits both volume and pH, so A) is correct.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_6_162
proposed answer: The calculated acid volume from subtask_4 was 28.1 cm³, which aligns almost exactly with choice A’s 28.05 cm³. The predicted pH (~1.55) does not exactly match any option, but choice A’s pH of 2.04 is the closest available and is plausible when accounting for Fe³⁺ hydrolysis and ionic strength. No other choice comes close in both volume and pH, so A is the best match.
