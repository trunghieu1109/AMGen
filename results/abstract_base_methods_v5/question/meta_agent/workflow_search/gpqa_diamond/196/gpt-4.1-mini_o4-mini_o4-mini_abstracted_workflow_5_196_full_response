The broad singlet at 10.5 ppm (1H) corresponds to the carboxylic acid proton identified in the IR. The two doublets at 8.0 ppm (2H, J≈8 Hz) and 7.2 ppm (2H, J≈8 Hz) arise from the four aromatic protons of a para‐disubstituted benzene ring. The signal at 2.9 ppm is a multiplet integrating to 1H, indicating the methine (CH) proton of a sec‐butyl group attached to the ring. The multiplet at 1.7 ppm (2H) fits the methylene (CH2) of that sec‐butyl chain. The doublet at 1.4 ppm (3H, J≈6 Hz) is the methyl group coupled to the CH methine. Finally, the triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H, J≈7 Hz) is the terminal methyl of the ethyl fragment within the sec‐butyl substituent.; answer: 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H) – COOH proton; 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) & 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) – para‐disubstituted aromatic protons; 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) – methine H of sec‐butyl; 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) – CH2 of sec‐butyl; 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) – methyl on sec‐butyl methine; 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) – terminal methyl of the ethyl fragment\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent 5k2q, integrating IR and NMR data, thinking: The IR spectrum shows a broad O–H stretch (3400–2500 cm⁻¹) and a C=O stretch (1720 cm⁻¹), consistent with a carboxylic acid, as well as aromatic C=C stretches (1610, 1450 cm⁻¹). The ¹H NMR data support a para‐disubstituted benzene (two doublets at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm, each 2 H) and a sec-butyl side chain (multiplet at 2.9 ppm for the CH attached to the ring, multiplet at 1.7 ppm for CH₂, a doublet at 1.4 ppm for the methyl on the chiral center, and a triplet at 0.9 ppm for the terminal methyl). The broad singlet at 10.5 ppm is the acid proton. Integrating these data gives a para‐sec-butylbenzoic acid structure.; answer: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n<SEPERATOR>\nCritic agent U33Y, providing feedback, thinking: The assignment of a para-sec-butylbenzoic acid structure from the IR and ¹H NMR data is reasonable, but it rests on functional-group and proton-pattern correlations rather than proven connectivity. IR bands at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ and 1720 cm⁻¹ establish a carboxylic acid, and the aromatic C=C stretches plus two 2H doublets in the NMR support a para‐disubstituted ring. The multiplet and methyl patterns match a sec-butyl chain. However, IR cannot distinguish between positional isomers or confirm substitution patterns beyond functional groups, and ¹H NMR alone cannot unambiguously prove the exact carbon skeleton or rule out other isomers. Overlapping signals, lack of ¹³C or 2D NMR, absence of mass spectrometry, and no stereochemical information on the chiral center mean the proposed structure remains a strong hypothesis, not a definitive proof.; answer: IR and ¹H NMR integration is inherently limited because it identifies functional groups and proton environments but cannot confirm full connectivity, distinguish all isomers or stereochemistry, or replace more definitive techniques (e.g., 13C/2D NMR or MS).\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent 5k2q, refining integration, thinking: The IR spectrum shows a broad, intense absorption from 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ characteristic of a carboxylic acid O–H stretch and a strong C=O stretch at 1720 cm⁻¹, confirming a carboxylic acid functional group.

The carboxylic acid of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid is first protonated and reduced by single-electron transfer from iodide to give an acyloxyl radical. That rapidly expels CO₂ to yield a benzylic radical which then abstracts hydrogen from HI (or P–H species). In effect the –COOH is converted into a –CH₃ substituent.
