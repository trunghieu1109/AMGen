Question: Example(question='Compound X, which has the following IR and NMR data, reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Identify the final product.\nIR: 3400â€“2500 cm-1, 1720 cm-1, 1610 cm-1, 1450 cm-1\n1H NMR: 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H), 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H), 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).', choice1='1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene', choice2='4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid', choice3='2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid', choice4='1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_5_196
proposed answer: Red phosphorus and HI reduce and decarboxylate the para-substituted benzoic acid, removing the COOH and replacing it with hydrogen. The NMR data (methine at 2.9 ppm, methylene at 1.7 ppm, methyl doublet at 1.4 ppm, methyl triplet at 0.9 ppm) correspond to a sec-butyl group, and the aromatic pattern matches a para-methyl substituent. Among the choices, only 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene (option A) fits this product.
