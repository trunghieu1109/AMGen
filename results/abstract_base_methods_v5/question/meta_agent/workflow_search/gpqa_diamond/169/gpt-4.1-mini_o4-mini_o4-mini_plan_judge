Question: Example(question='An electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Find the expectation value of its spin along y-direction, S_y.\nNote: \\sigma_y (in latex format) is: \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & -i \\\\\ni & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}', choice1='-25*hbar/2\n\n', choice2='-12*hbar/25\n\n', choice3='12*hbar/25', choice4='25*hbar/2\n', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_54_169
proposed answer: From subtask 4 the expectation value of S_y was calculated to be -12ħ/25. Comparing this result with the given options: A) -25ħ/2, B) -12ħ/25, C) 12ħ/25, D) 25ħ/2, only option B exactly matches -12ħ/25. Therefore the correct choice is B).

Answer:B)
Extracted answer: B)
Correct answer: 2
