            "Astronomers are studying a system of five exoplanets with circular orbits, discovered through the TTV method. The planets (designated as Planet_1 through Planet_5), which are in orbital resonance, have orbital periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Assuming these planets possess the same albedo, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2?",

        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The orbital period ratios are given in order for Planet_1 through Planet_5 as 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5. By indexing these ratios: Planet_1 corresponds to 1, Planet_2 to 2, Planet_3 to 2.5, Planet_4 to 3.5, and Planet_5 to 5. Therefore, the extracted orbital period ratios are Planet_2 = 2 and Planet_4 = 3.5.; answer - Planet_2 = 2, Planet_4 = 3.5\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - Kepler's third law relates the orbital period P and semi-major axis a of a planet orbiting a star of given mass by P^2 \u221d a^3. This comes from equating gravitational and centripetal forces (or from Newton's form of Kepler's third law), giving a^3 = GM\u2605/(4\u03c0^2)\u00b7P^2. Hence, for planets around the same star, a \u221d P^{2/3}. This relationship allows us to compute orbital radii directly from periods.; answer - According to Kepler\u2019s third law for circular orbits: P^2 \u221d a^3, so the orbital radius a scales as a \u221d P^{2/3}.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - We know from subtask 1 that P2 = 2 and P4 = 3.5. From subtask 2, Kepler\u2019s third law gives a \u221d P^(2/3). Therefore the ratio of orbital radii is a4/a2 = (P4/P2)^(2/3) = (3.5/2)^(2/3). Compute 3.5/2 = 1.75, then (1.75)^(2/3) = exp[(2/3)\u00b7ln(1.75)] \u2248 exp[0.3731] \u2248 1.45. Thus the orbital radius of Planet_4 is about 1.45 times that of Planet_2.; answer - The ratio a4/a2 = (3.5/2)^(2/3) \u2248 1.45\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - For a planet in a circular orbit with the same albedo, the equilibrium temperature Teq follows from balancing absorbed and emitted radiation: Teq = [L\u22c5(1\u2013A)/(16\u03c0\u03c3a^2)]^(1/4). Since L, A, and \u03c3 are constants here, Teq \u221d a^(\u20131/2). Thus the equilibrium temperature scales as the inverse square root of the orbital radius.; answer - Teq \u221d 1/\u221ar\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - We have from subtask 3 that the orbital radius ratio a4/a2 \u2248 1.45. From subtask 4, the equilibrium temperature scales as Teq \u221d a^(\u20131/2). Therefore, the temperature ratio T4/T2 = (a4/a2)^(\u20131/2) = 1/\u221a(1.45). Computing \u221a1.45 \u2248 1.204 gives T4/T2 \u2248 1/1.204 \u2248 0.83.; answer - ~0.83\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 6 output: thinking - From the orbital period ratio we find T4/T2 \u221d (P2/P4)^{1/3} \u2248 (2/3.5)^{1/3} \u2248 (0.571)^{1/3} \u2248 0.83. Among the given options (~0.75, ~0.83, ~0.69, ~0.57), 0.83 corresponds exactly to choice2, which is option B.; answer - B)"
