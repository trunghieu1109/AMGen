Question: Example(question='Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are\nconstrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system\ncorrect to three decimals?', choice1='2.822 x 10^-26', choice2='5.645 x 10^-26', choice3='7.056 x 10^-27', choice4='122.330', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_179
proposed answer: The calculated minimum energy is 2.939×10⁻²⁶ J. Comparing to the options: A) 2.822×10⁻²⁶ J is very close (difference ~0.117×10⁻²⁶ J), B) is nearly double, C) is an order of magnitude smaller, and D) is nonsensical in this context. Therefore the closest match is option A).

Answer:A)
Extracted answer: A)
