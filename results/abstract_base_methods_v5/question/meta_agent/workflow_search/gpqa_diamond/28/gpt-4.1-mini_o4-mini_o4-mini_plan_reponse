            "You have an interesting drought-resistant cultivar of barley, which, unfortunately, contains an anti-nutritional compound. This compound makes it impossible to use this cultivar for food purposes. After an extensive investigation, you discover the gene responsible for the synthesis of this compound. This gene consists of five exons and four introns. You decide to use old-school approaches and produce a collection of mutants using EMS chemical mutagen. You sequence a target gene in all mutant lines and discover some changes at the beginning of its sequence in the first exon area. Which of the following mutations will most probably let you eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the cultivar?\n\nIntact gene:\n5\u2019-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nMutant 1:\n5\u2019-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026TGA-3\u2019\nMutant 2:\n5\u2019-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026TGA-3\u2019\nMutant 3:\n5\u2019-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\nMutant 4:\n5\u2019-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019<b>",

        "response": "Mutant 2 changes the third codon from CTA (Leu) to TAA, introducing an immediate stop codon. This truncates the protein after only two amino acids (Met-Phe), preventing formation of any functional enzyme domains and almost certainly triggering nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. By contrast, Mutants 1, 3, and 4 only introduce single amino acid substitutions or small in-frame alterations near the N-terminus, which are unlikely to completely abolish protein folding or catalytic activity. Therefore, Mutant 2 is the most reliable knockout of enzyme function and will eliminate synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nAnswer:A)",
        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - I need to parse the intact gene sequence \u201c5\u2019-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\u201d to identify the start codon, the open reading frame, and where the first exon likely ends (i.e. the splice donor site). The first three nucleotides ATG are the canonical start codon. From there the frame proceeds in triplets: ATG (Met), TTT (Phe), CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GGA (Gly), etc. We look for the conserved 5\u2019 splice\u2010donor consensus \u201cGT\u201d that would demarcate the exon\u2013intron boundary. In the provided stretch just before the ellipsis we see \u201c\u2026TAT TGT CGT\u201d. But upstream at positions 34\u201335 we can spot a GT dinucleotide immediately after the last full codon, suggesting that the first intron begins there. Thus, the first exon runs from nt 1 through nt 36 (inclusive of the last full codon), the intron likely starts at nt 37\u201338 (GT). The entire coding frame is in the +1 frame starting at the ATG and continues without interruption through this boundary in exon 1.; answer - The first exon begins at the ATG start codon (nucleotides 1\u20133) and establishes the open reading frame. In\u2010frame codons from nt 1 onward are read as ATG-TTT-CTC-GCT-GGT-ACT-TCT-GTG-GGA-\u2026 up through the codon ending at nt 34\u201336. A canonical \u201cGT\u201d splice\u2010donor dinucleotide appears immediately downstream (nt 37\u201338), marking the end of exon 1. Thus, exon 1 spans nt 1\u201336 in the +1 reading frame starting at ATG.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - We align each mutant to the intact first\u2010exon sequence (nt1\u201336) and number bases from the ATG start (nt1\u20133).

From the N-terminal translations: Mutant 2 introduces a TAA stop at codon 3, truncating the protein to just two residues (MF). Such an early truncation will not only abolish the catalytic domain but also trigger nonsense\u2010mediated decay, preventing any substantial peptide from being made. The other mutants (1, 3, 4) only carry single amino acid substitutions in the very N-terminus, which are unlikely to disrupt overall folding or catalytic activity completely. While we aren\u2019t evaluating potential regulatory motif changes, splice site creation, or reinitiation mechanisms here, the presence of the premature stop in Mutant 2 is sufficient to eliminate enzyme function and thus block synthesis of the anti\u2010nutritional compound.; answer - Mutant 2\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - Mutant 2 changes the third codon from CTA (Leu) to TAA, introducing an immediate stop codon. This truncates the protein after only two amino acids (Met-Phe), preventing formation of any functional enzyme domains and almost certainly triggering nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. By contrast, Mutants 1, 3, and 4 only introduce single amino acid substitutions or small in-frame alterations near the N-terminus, which are unlikely to completely abolish protein folding or catalytic activity.
