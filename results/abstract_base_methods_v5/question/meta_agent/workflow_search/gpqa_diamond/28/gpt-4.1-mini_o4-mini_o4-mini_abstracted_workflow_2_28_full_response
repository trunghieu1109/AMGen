However, it focuses solely on the codon-level changes in the very N-terminus and assumes any missense change is benign. It doesn’t consider effects on mRNA stability (for example, nonsense-mediated decay triggered by early stops), potential creation or destruction of regulatory motifs (splice sites, RNA secondary structures), or impacts on protein folding domains beyond the first few residues. It also ignores possible leaky scanning or reinitiation that might produce a partially functional protein.; answer: Limitations include: 1) Neglect of mRNA processing and stability consequences (e.g., nonsense-mediated decay). 2) Overlooking creation/destruction of splice or regulatory elements within exons. 3) Ignoring downstream structural domains that even conservative N-terminal substitutions could disrupt. 4) No functional assays to confirm predicted effects or account for alternative translation initiation.\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent BDsY, refining mutation impact evaluation, thinking: We need to assess each mutation for its likely impact on enzyme function, focusing on premature stop codons, frameshifts, or critical amino acid changes.
