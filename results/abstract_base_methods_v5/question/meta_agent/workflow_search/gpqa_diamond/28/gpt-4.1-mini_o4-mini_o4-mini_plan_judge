Question: Example(question='You have an interesting drought-resistant cultivar of barley, which, unfortunately, contains an anti-nutritional compound. This compound makes it impossible to use this cultivar for food purposes. After an extensive investigation, you discover the gene responsible for the synthesis of this compound. This gene consists of five exons and four introns. You decide to use old-school approaches and produce a collection of mutants using EMS chemical mutagen. You sequence a target gene in all mutant lines and discover some changes at the beginning of its sequence in the first exon area. Which of the following mutations will most probably let you eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the cultivar?\n\nIntact gene:\n5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’\n\nMutant 1:\n5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’\nMutant 2:\n5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’\nMutant 3:\n5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’\nMutant 4:\n5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’<b>', choice1='Mutant 2', choice2='Mutant 4', choice3='Mutant 1', choice4='Mutant 3', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: Mutant 2 changes the third codon from CTA (Leu) to TAA, introducing an immediate stop codon. This truncates the protein after only two amino acids (Met-Phe), preventing formation of any functional enzyme domains and almost certainly triggering nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. By contrast, Mutants 1, 3, and 4 only introduce single amino acid substitutions or small in-frame alterations near the N-terminus, which are unlikely to completely abolish protein folding or catalytic activity. Therefore, Mutant 2 is the most reliable knockout of enzyme function and will eliminate synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.
