Then use moles = Molarity × Volume (L): moles = 0.05 mol/L × 0.02000 L = 0.00100 mol.; answer - 0.00100 mol\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - To find the new concentration after dilution, use C₂ = n / V₂. We have n = 0.00100 mol (from Sub-task 1) and V₂ = 40.00 cm³ = 0.04000 L. Thus C₂ = 0.00100 mol / 0.04000 L = 0.0250 M.; answer - 0.0250 M\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - From Sub-task 2, the diluted acetic acid concentration is 0.0250 M in a total volume of 0.04000 L, giving n_acid = 0.0250 mol/L × 0.04000 L = 0.00100 mol. At the equivalence point, NaOH neutralizes CH₃COOH in a 1:1 molar ratio (CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O). Therefore, the moles of NaOH required equal the moles of acetic acid present, assuming ideal behavior and complete reaction.; answer - 0.00100 mol NaOH\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - From Sub-task 3 we found that the equivalence point requires 0.00100 mol NaOH. At 0.10 M NaOH this corresponds to 0.00100 mol / 0.10 M = 0.0100 L = 10.0 mL. Twenty‐five percent titration is 25% of the equivalence volume: 0.25×10.0 mL = 2.50 mL. The moles of NaOH added at this point are 0.10 M × 0.00250 L = 0.00025 mol. This amount of OH– reacts 1:1 with CH₃COOH, so moles CH₃COOH remaining = initial 0.00100 mol – 0.00025 mol = 0.00075 mol, and moles CH₃COO– produced = 0.00025 mol.; answer - Volume of NaOH added = 2.50 mL; moles CH₃COOH remaining = 0.00075 mol; moles CH₃COO– present = 0.00025 mol.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - At 25% titration, 0.00075 mol acetic acid (HA) and 0.00025 mol acetate (A–) are present in total volume 42.50 mL. Thus [A–]/[HA] = (0.00025/0.04250)/(0.00075/0.04250) = 1/3. Using pH = pKa + log([A–]/[HA]) with pKa = –log(1.85×10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.732 gives pH = 4.732 + log(1/3) = 4.732 – 0.477 = 4.255, which rounds to 4.26.; answer - 4.26\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 6 output: thinking - At the equivalence point, all 0.00100 mol of CH₃COOH has been converted to CH₃COO⁻. The total volume is 40.00 mL acid\u2009+\u200910.00 mL NaOH = 50.00 mL, so [CH₃COO⁻] = 0.00100 mol/0.05000 L = 0.0200 M. The base‐ionization constant of acetate is Kb = Kw/Ka = 1.00×10⁻¹⁴/1.85×10⁻⁵ ≈ 5.41×10⁻¹⁰. For the hydrolysis CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻, we set x = [OH⁻], giving Kb ≈ x²/[CH₃COO⁻], so x ≈ √(Kb·0.0200) ≈ √(5.41×10⁻¹⁰·0.0200) ≈ 3.29×10⁻⁶ M. Thus pOH = –log(3.29×10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48 and pH = 14.00 – 5.48 = 8.52. This treatment assumes ideal behavior and that x ≪ [CH₃COO⁻], which is valid here.; answer - 8.52\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 7 output: thinking - We found the pH at 25% titration to be 4.26 and at equivalence to be 8.52.

However, this approach assumes ideal dilution (volumes are strictly additive), complete reaction with no side reactions, constant activity coefficients (neglecting ionic strength effects), and that temperature and nonideal solution behavior don’t shift concentration or dissociation. In reality, volume change on mixing, activity corrections, and slight temperature variations can introduce small errors.; answer: 0.00100 mol NaOH\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent X3nm, refining moles of NaOH calculation, thinking: From Sub-task 2, the diluted acetic acid concentration is 0.0250 M in a total volume of 0.04000 L, giving n_acid = 0.0250 mol/L × 0.04000 L = 0.00100 mol.

With Ka = 1.85×10–5, pKa = –log\u2009(1.85×10–5) = 4.732. So pH = 4.732 + log(0.005882/0.01765) = 4.732 + log(0.3333) = 4.732 – 0.477 = 4.255 ≈ 4.26.; answer: 4.26\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent 4Fyt, round 0, calculating pH at 25% titration, thinking: At 25% titration, moles CH₃COOH remaining = 0.00075 mol and moles CH₃COO⁻ = 0.00025 mol in total volume 42.5 mL. Using Henderson–Hasselbalch: pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA]). pKa = -log(1.85×10⁻⁵) = 4.732. Ratio = 0.00025/0.00075 = 1/3, so log(1/3) = -0.4771.

The total volume is 40.00 mL acid solution + 10.00 mL NaOH = 50.00 mL = 0.05000 L, so [CH₃COO⁻] = 0.00100 mol / 0.05000 L = 0.0200 M.

Treating the hydrolysis CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻ with initial c = 0.0200 M and x = [OH⁻], Kb ≈ x²/c ⇒ x ≈ √(Kb·c) = √(5.41×10⁻¹⁰·0.0200) = 3.29×10⁻⁶ M = [OH⁻].

However, it relies on key approximations and ideal assumptions.; answer: Calculated pH at equivalence: 8.52. Limitations: assumes ideal behavior (activities≈concentrations), neglects ionic strength effects and activity coefficients, uses the x≪c approximation in the hydrolysis equilibrium, ignores water autoionization when [OH–] is low, and fixes Kw at 1.00×10–14 (no temperature or ionic strength dependence).\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent L6F0, refining pH at equivalence point, thinking: At the equivalence point, all 0.00100 mol of CH₃COOH has been converted to CH₃COO⁻.
