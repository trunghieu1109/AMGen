Question: Example(question='We dilute 20.00 cm3 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm3 water, then titrate the resulting solution with 0.1M NaOH (25 Â°C). What will be the value of pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point? The Ka of acetic acid is 1.85x10^-5.', choice1='4.57; 6.92  ', choice2='4.26; 8.52', choice3='4.73; 7.00', choice4='3.17; 6.73  ', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_6_82
proposed answer: We found the pH at 25% titration to be 4.26 and at equivalence to be 8.52. Comparing these to the provided options: only choice B) 4.26; 8.52 matches both values exactly, so B is correct.

Answer:B
Extracted answer: B
Correct answer: 2
