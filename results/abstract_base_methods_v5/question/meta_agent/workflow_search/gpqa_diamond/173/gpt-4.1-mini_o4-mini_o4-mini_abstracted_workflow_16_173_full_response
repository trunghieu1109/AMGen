After fission there are only two fragments, so by conservation of momentum their vector momenta must sum to zero: p₁ + p₂ = 0. Hence each fragment carries equal‐magnitude and opposite‐directed momentum. In relativistic form p = γm\u2009v, so γ₁m₁v₁ = γ₂m₂v₂. This relation directly links their velocities (and momenta) through their masses and Lorentz factors.; answer - p₁ + p₂ = 0 ⇒ |p₁| = |p₂|.

Solving yields E1≈199.005\u2009GeV so T1_rel=E1−198≈1.005\u2009GeV.; answer - T1_rel ≈ 1.005\u2009GeV\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - From subtask 3 we have p₁= p₂. Let m₁=2m₂. In the classical limit T= p²/(2m). So T₁= p²/(2m₁), T₂= p²/(2m₂)= p²/(2(m₁/2))=2p²/(2m₁)=2T₁. Thus T₁+T₂=3T₁ equals the total energy release Q. The mass defect is ΔM=0.01M, so Q=ΔM·c²=0.01×300\u2009GeV=3\u2009GeV.

Let m₁=2m₂. In the classical limit T= p²/(2m). So T₁= p²/(2m₁), T₂= p²/(2m₂)= p²/(2(m₁/2))=2p²/(2m₁)=2T₁. Thus T₁+T₂=3T₁ equals the total energy release Q.
