            "An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. A spontaneous fission occurs in which it splits into two fragments (and nothing else), such that one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other (in terms of their rest-masses). The sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. \n\nKinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?\n\n(Ignore the electrons.)",

        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The user requests definitions of the given physical quantities and parameters from the problem statement. I will identify each symbol and its meaning directly from the text: initial mass M, its rest-mass energy, the fragment mass ratio, and the total fragment mass after fission.; answer - Initial nucleus rest mass M: the rest mass of the original nucleus before fission.\nRest-mass energy E\u2080 = M c\u00b2 = 300 GeV: the energy equivalent of the nucleus\u2019s rest mass.\nFragment mass ratio: one fragment\u2019s rest mass is twice that of the other (m_heavy = 2 m_light).\nTotal rest mass of fragments after fission: m_heavy + m_light = 0.99 M (i.e., the sum of the two fragment rest masses is 99% of the original mass).\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - We have m_heavy = 2 m_light, and m_heavy + m_light = 0.99 M. Substituting gives 2 m_light + m_light = 3 m_light = 0.99 M, so m_light = 0.99 M / 3 = 0.33 M. Then m_heavy = 2 \u00d7 0.33 M = 0.66 M.; answer - The lighter fragment has rest mass m_light = 0.99 M / 3 \u2243 0.33 M, and the heavier fragment has rest mass m_heavy = 2 m_light \u2243 0.66 M.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - Initially the nucleus is at rest so total momentum before fission is zero. After fission there are only two fragments, so by conservation of momentum their vector momenta must sum to zero: p\u2081 + p\u2082 = 0. Hence each fragment carries equal\u2010magnitude and opposite\u2010directed momentum. In relativistic form p = \u03b3m\u2009v, so \u03b3\u2081m\u2081v\u2081 = \u03b3\u2082m\u2082v\u2082. This relation directly links their velocities (and momenta) through their masses and Lorentz factors.; answer - p\u2081 + p\u2082 = 0 \u21d2 |p\u2081| = |p\u2082|. In relativistic form: \u03b3\u2081m\u2081v\u2081 = \u03b3\u2082m\u2082v\u2082.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - We know M\u2009c^2=300\u2009GeV splits into m1=2m2 with m1+m2=0.99M\u2192m1=0.66M\u2192198\u2009GeV, m2=0.33M\u219299\u2009GeV. The Q\u2010value (total KE) is 300\u2212(198+99)=3\u2009GeV. By momentum conservation p1=\u2212p2 and relativistic energies E1=\u221a(p\u00b2+198\u00b2), E2=\u221a(p\u00b2+99\u00b2) (in GeV units) satisfy E1+E2=300. Solving yields E1\u2248199.005\u2009GeV so T1_rel=E1\u2212198\u22481.005\u2009GeV.; answer - T1_rel \u2248 1.005\u2009GeV\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - From subtask 3 we have p\u2081= p\u2082. Let m\u2081=2m\u2082. In the classical limit T= p\u00b2/(2m). So T\u2081= p\u00b2/(2m\u2081), T\u2082= p\u00b2/(2m\u2082)= p\u00b2/(2(m\u2081/2))=2p\u00b2/(2m\u2081)=2T\u2081. Thus T\u2081+T\u2082=3T\u2081 equals the total energy release Q. The mass defect is \u0394M=0.01M, so Q=\u0394M\u00b7c\u00b2=0.01\u00d7300\u2009GeV=3\u2009GeV. Hence T\u2081_classical=Q/3=1\u2009GeV.; answer - T1_classical = 1 GeV\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 6 output: thinking - From Sub-task 4 we found T1_rel \u22481.005\u2009GeV and from Sub-task 5 T1_classical =1.000\u2009GeV. The difference is \u0394T1=T1_rel\u2013T1_classical=1.005\u2009GeV\u20131.000\u2009GeV=0.005\u2009GeV, which equals 5\u2009MeV.; answer - 5 MeV\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 7 output: thinking - From the relativistic calculation in Sub-task 6, the difference \u0394T1 = T1_rel \u2013 T1_classical = 0.005 GeV = 5 MeV. Comparing to the options\u2014A) 10 MeV, B) 5 MeV, C) 2 MeV, D) 20 MeV\u2014the computed value matches choice B).; answer - B)"
