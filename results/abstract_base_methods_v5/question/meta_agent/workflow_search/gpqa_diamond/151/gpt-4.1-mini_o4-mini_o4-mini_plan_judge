Question: Example(question='You identified a new quorum-sensing peptide in the bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus. You are highly interested if its role in intercellular communication is conserved among the eukaryotes. You treat yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with the peptide and interestingly observe the formation of the shmoo. You want to learn about the proteome of the active chromatin in the shmoo and recover it by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. The least of proteins from which complex below will you observe in your assay?', choice1='pre-initiation complex', choice2='pre-replication complex', choice3='enhancer protein complex', choice4='nucleosome histone complex', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_5_151
proposed answer: In a ChIPâ€“MS experiment targeting active chromatin (e.g. RNAPII or H3K4me3) from shmoo-induced yeast, one enriches factors directly involved in transcription initiation and the nucleosomes bearing active histone marks. The pre-initiation complex (PIC) assembles at active promoters alongside RNAPII and thus is co-purified, and the nucleosome histone complex with active marks is the very bait of the IP. In contrast, the pre-replication complex functions at origins to license DNA replication in G1/S and has no role in transcription at active promoters; it will not be recruited to or cross-link with active chromatin and therefore will be essentially absent from the MS data. Although yeast lacks a metazoan-style enhancer protein complex, the canonical absence of any replication factors in a transcription-focused ChIP makes the pre-replication complex the least detectable.
