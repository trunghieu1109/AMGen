        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The operator Ay is defined as Ay = c\u00b7S, where c = h/(4\u03c0) and S is the 2\u00d72 matrix with first row (0, \u2212i) and second row (i, 0). To obtain Ay explicitly, multiply each entry of S by c. This yields Ay = (h/4\u03c0)\u00b7[[0, \u2212i],[i, 0]].; answer - Ay = (h/4\u03c0) [[0, \u2212i], [i, 0]]\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - We need to write the eigenvalue equation Ay\u03c6=a\u03c6 by substituting the explicit 2\u00d72 matrix for Ay from subtask 1. Ay=(h/4\u03c0)[[0,\u2212i],[i,0]], \u03c6=(\u03c6\u2081,\u03c6\u2082)\u1d40, so multiplication gives a system of two linear equations equal to a\u03c6\u2081 and a\u03c6\u2082. This fully expresses the eigenvalue problem in matrix form.; answer - (h/4\u03c0) [[0, \u2212i],[i, 0]] [\u03c6\u2081, \u03c6\u2082]\u1d40 = a [\u03c6\u2081, \u03c6\u2082]\u1d40\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - To find the eigenvalues a of Ay = (h/4\u03c0)\u00b7S, we solve det(Ay \u2013 aI)=0. Write Ay\u2013aI = (h/4\u03c0)[[0, \u2013i],[i, 0]] \u2013 a[[1,0],[0,1]]. Factor out (h/4\u03c0): (h/4\u03c0)(S \u2013 (4\u03c0a/h)I). The determinant vanishes when det(S \u2013 \u03bbI)=0 with \u03bb = 4\u03c0a/h. The 2\u00d72 matrix S = [[0,\u2013i],[i,0]] has characteristic equation \u03bb\u00b2\u20131=0, giving \u03bb = \u00b11. Thus 4\u03c0a/h = \u00b11 \u21d2 a = \u00b1(h/4\u03c0).; answer - a = +h/(4\u03c0), \u2013h/(4\u03c0)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - To find eigenvectors \u03c6 for each eigenvalue a of Ay=(h/4\u03c0)S, we solve (Ay\u2013aI)\u03c6=0. Equivalently solve (S\u2013(4\u03c0a/h)I)\u03c6=0. For a=+h/4\u03c0, 4\u03c0a/h=+1 so S\u2013I=[[0,\u2013i],[i,0]]\u2013[[1,0],[0,1]]=[[-1,\u2013i],[i,\u20131]]. The equations are \u2013x\u2013i\u2009y=0 \u21d2 x=\u2013i\u2009y and i\u2009x\u2013y=0 \u21d2 y=i\u2009x. Combining gives y=i\u2009x, so choose x=1 \u21d2 y=i. Thus \u03c6\u208a\u221d(1,i)^T, normalized \u03c6\u208a=(1/\u221a2)[1,i]^T. For a=\u2013h/4\u03c0, 4\u03c0a/h=\u20131 so S+I=[[1,\u2013i],[i,1]]. The equations x\u2013i\u2009y=0 \u21d2 x=i\u2009y and i\u2009x+y=0 \u21d2 y=\u2013i\u2009x; combining gives x=i\u2009y, choose y=1 \u21d2 x=i.

From subtask 3 we found a=\u00b1h/(4\u03c0). Since \u210f=h/(2\u03c0), h/(4\u03c0)=\u210f/2. Hence the eigenvalues are \u00b1\u210f/2, purely real (zero imaginary part), exactly as expected for a spin-\u00bd component.; answer - The eigenvalues are purely real: +h/(4\u03c0) and \u2013h/(4\u03c0) (i.e. \u00b1\u0127/2), with zero imaginary part.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 6 output: thinking - For spin-\u00bd, the total spin operator A\u00b2 commutes with every component: [A\u00b2,Ay]=0, so any eigenstate of Ay is also an eigenstate of A\u00b2 (with eigenvalue \u0127\u00b2\u00b73/4). But Ay does not commute with Az: [Ay,Az]=i\u0127Ax\u22600, so they cannot share eigenfunctions.
