Question: Example(question='A eukaryotic cell evolved a mechanism to turn macromolecular building blocks into energy. The process occurs in mitochondria, which are cellular energy factories. In the series of redox reactions, the energy from food is stored between the phosphate groups and used as a universal cellular currency. The energy-laden molecules are shuttled out of the mitochondrion to serve in all cellular processes. You discovered a new anti-diabetes drug and want to investigate whether it has an effect on the mitochondria. You set up a range of experiments with your HEK293 cell line. Which of the experiments listed below will not help you discover the mitochondrial role of your drug:', choice1='Transformation of cells with recombinant luciferase and luminometer reading after 5 μM of luciferin addition to the supernatant', choice2='Confocal fluorescence microscopy after Mito-RTP staining of the cells', choice3='Differential centrifugation extraction of mitochondria followed by the Glucose Uptake Colorimetric Assay Kit ', choice4="Flow cytometry after labeling with 2.5 μM 5,5',6,6'-Tetrachloro-1,1',3, 3'-tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine iodide", correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_43
proposed answer: Choice 3 involves isolating mitochondria and then using a glucose uptake assay, which measures plasma membrane transporter activity in intact cells rather than any intrinsic mitochondrial process. Since glucose uptake occurs at the cell surface and not within purified mitochondria, this experiment cannot assess mitochondrial bioenergetics or the drug’s effect on mitochondrial function, making it irrelevant to discovering the mitochondrial role of the compound.
