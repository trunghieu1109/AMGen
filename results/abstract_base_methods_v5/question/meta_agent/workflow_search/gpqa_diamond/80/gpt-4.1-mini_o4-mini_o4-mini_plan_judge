proposed answer: All four sequences fail to include both the necessary Grignard‐formation step (Mg/ether) and the CO‐insertion to yield the ketone. Steps 3–5 in each choice are unrelated (oxidations, reductions, or eliminations) and cannot install the carbonyl via CO insertion into a cyclopentyl organometallic. Therefore, none of A–D can produce [1,1′-bi(cyclopentylidene)]-2-one from 1,5-dichloropentane.

proposed answer: After evaluating each choice’s feasibility for Wurtz cyclization, radical chlorination, elimination, oxidation, and aldol dimerization, Choice A offers the most coherent route. Although PCC oxidation (CrO₃/pyridine) cannot oxidize an alkene directly, this can be remedied by a mild acid-catalyzed hydration prior to PCC, yielding cyclopentanone. The other sequences either omit necessary steps (B), over-oxidize or cleave rings (C), or employ incorrect reagents (D). Thus, Choice A is the best match to the synthetic requirements.
