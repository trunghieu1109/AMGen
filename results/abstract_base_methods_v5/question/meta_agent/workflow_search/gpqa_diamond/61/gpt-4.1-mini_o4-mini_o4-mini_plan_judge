proposed answer: The target 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde requires: (1) deprotonation of the terminal alkyne and C–C bond formation with a cyclohexyl electrophile, (2) partial (Z-selective) hydrogenation of the alkyne to the alkene, and (3) reductive ozonolysis to install the adjacent hydroxyl and aldehyde. Choice 1 uniquely employs NaNH₂/alkyl halide for step 1, H₂/Pd–CaCO₃ for Z-selective hydrogenation, and O₃/(CH₃)₂S for reductive cleavage, exactly matching the required transformations. The other sequences either use the wrong electrophile, give incorrect alkene geometry, over-reduce, or lead to the wrong oxidation state. Thus the correct sequence is Choice 1, i.e. A).
