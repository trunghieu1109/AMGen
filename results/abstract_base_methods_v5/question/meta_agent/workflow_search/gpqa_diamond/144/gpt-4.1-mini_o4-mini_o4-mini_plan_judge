Question: Example(question='How many stereoisomers are there for the compound 6-chloro-9-ethyl-2-methylundeca-3,7-dien-5-ol?', choice1='8', choice2='16', choice3='32', choice4='4', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_23_144
proposed answer: We calculated 2^4 stereocenters × 2^2 stereogenic double bonds = 16 × 4 = 64 stereoisomers. The provided options (8, 16, 32, 4) do not include 64, so none of the choices is correct.

Answer:None of the above
Extracted answer: None of the above
Correct answer: 2

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_23_144
proposed answer: The total stereoisomer count was determined as 2^2 (for two chiral centers) × 2^2 (for two C=C double bonds) = 16, with no meso forms or symmetry reductions in this open-chain molecule. This exactly matches choice “16” in the multiple-choice list. According to the instructions, we must output only the corresponding letter for a matching choice, which is B).

Answer:B)
Extracted answer: B)
Correct answer: 2
