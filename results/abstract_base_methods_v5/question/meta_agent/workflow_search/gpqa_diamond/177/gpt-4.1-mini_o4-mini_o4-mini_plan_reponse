From Sub-task 2 we found that the operator \u03c8\u0304\u03c3_{\u03bc\u03bd}\u03c8\u2009F^{\u03bc\u03bd} has mass dimension 5. Denoting the mass dimension of the coupling \u03ba by [\u03ba], we require\n\n  [\u03ba] + 5 = 4\n\nwhich implies\n\n  [\u03ba] = 4 \u2212 5 = \u22121.\n\nThis counting assumes canonical field normalization, flat 4D spacetime, and is at tree level (quantum corrections could modify dimensions via anomalous contributions).; answer - The mass dimension of \u03ba is \u22121.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - In four-dimensional spacetime the interaction term \u03c8\u0304\u03c3_{\u03bc\u03bd}\u03c8\u2009F^{\u03bc\u03bd} has classical mass dimension 5 (since \u03c8 has dimension 3/2, F^{\u03bc\u03bd} has dimension 2, and \u03c3_{\u03bc\u03bd} is dimensionless). To maintain a Lagrangian density of dimension 4, the coupling \u03ba must carry mass dimension [\u03ba]=4\u22125=\u22121. According to the standard power-counting criterion, any coupling with negative mass dimension corresponds to a non-renormalizable interaction: loop diagrams will generate divergences that cannot be absorbed into a finite number of counterterms, but instead require an infinite tower of higher-dimensional operators. Therefore the theory is non-renormalizable.; answer - The theory is not renormalizable.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - In four dimensions the Dirac field \u03c8 has mass dimension 3/2 and the field strength F^{\u03bc\u03bd} has dimension 2, so the operator \u03c8\u0304\u03c3_{\u03bc\u03bd}\u03c8\u2009F^{\u03bc\u03bd} has total dimension 3/2+3/2+2=5.
