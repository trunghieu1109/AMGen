Question: Example(question='A student performed an acid-catalyzed reaction of 3-methylpyrrolidine with compound A, the final product of the reaction is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. Select the suitable reagent (A) and catalyst (B) for the reaction.\n3-methylpyrrolidine + A (B, Heat, solvent) ---> 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine', choice1='A = vinylcyclohexane, B = TsOH', choice2='A = cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, B = TsOH', choice3='A = vinylcyclohexane, B = Acetic acid', choice4='A = cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, B = Acetic acid', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_49_100
proposed answer: The formation of 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine proceeds via condensation of the secondary amine with an aldehyde to give an exocyclic enamine. Vinylcyclohexane cannot form the necessary iminium intermediate, so A must be cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Efficient enamine formation and dehydration require a strong Br√∏nsted acid catalyst; p-toluenesulfonic acid (TsOH) is strong enough to activate the aldehyde and drive the reaction under heating and water-removal conditions, whereas acetic acid is too weak. Among the given options, A = cyclohexanecarbaldehyde and B = TsOH corresponds to choice2, which is option B).
