Question: Example(question='X is a meson resonance. What is the mean decay distance? Knowing that the production energy is $E_{X}=8GeV$, the mass $m_{X}=1.2GeV$, and the width $\\Gamma_{X}=320MeV$.', choice1='5.0223 * 10^-16 m', choice2='4.0655 * 10^-16 m', choice3='4.0655 * 10^-15 m', choice4='5.0223 * 10^-15 m', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_4_143
proposed answer: From the calculation in subtask 3, the mean decay distance L ≃ 4.07×10⁻¹⁵ m. Comparing this to the provided choices: A) 5.0223×10⁻¹⁶ m, B) 4.0655×10⁻¹⁶ m, C) 4.0655×10⁻¹⁵ m, and D) 5.0223×10⁻¹⁵ m, choice C) (4.0655×10⁻¹⁵ m) is essentially identical to our result. Therefore, the closest match is C).
