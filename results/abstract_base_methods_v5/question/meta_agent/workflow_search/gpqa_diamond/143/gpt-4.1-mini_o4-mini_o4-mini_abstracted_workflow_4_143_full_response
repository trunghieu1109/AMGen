Its main limitations are:\n1. Lifetime approximation: τ=ℏ/Γ assumes a pure Breit–Wigner shape and neglects the resonance’s mass distribution and off-shell effects.\n2. Fixed boost: it uses a single γ from the central energy; real events have a distribution of momenta and boosts.\n3. No medium or material effects: it ignores possible interactions of X with surrounding particles before decay.\n4. Neglects quantum uncertainties: the calculation treats τ and β as exact averages, whereas each decay is stochastic.\n5. Neglect of transverse momentum: it assumes motion purely along the beam axis, so the actual path length in the detector may differ.; answer: Mean decay distance ≃4.07×10⁻¹⁵ m, noting the above approximations and uncertainties.\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent FWt5, refining mean decay distance, thinking: To compute the mean decay distance L in the lab frame, we use L = γ · β · c · τ.
