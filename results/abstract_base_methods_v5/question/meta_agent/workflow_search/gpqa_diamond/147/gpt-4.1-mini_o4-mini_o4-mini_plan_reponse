        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - We are told that A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 + F\u2082 and that A2 has mass-percent fluorine \u03c9F = 31.96 %. Let M be the atomic mass of Y and let A2 = YFn. Then n\u00b719/(M + n\u00b719) = 0.3196 \u21d2 M \u2243 n\u00b719\u00b70.6804/0.3196 \u2243 n\u00b719\u00d72.129. For n = 3, M \u2243 3\u00b719\u00b72.129 \u2243 121.4, which matches Sb (121.76). Hence Y = Sb and A2 = SbF\u2083. The decomposition A1 \u2192 SbF\u2083 + F\u2082 corresponds to A1 = SbF\u2085. SbF\u2085 is a powerful Lewis acid that oxidizes Xe to give Xe\u207aSbF\u2086\u207b, so it fits the reactivity of A1. A3 is obtained by direct fluorination of Sb metal with F\u2082; the next accessible oxidation state is +4, so A3 = SbF\u2084, which also forms adducts with Xe (e.g. Xe[Sb\u2082F\u2081\u2081]). Known binary antimony fluorides therefore include SbF (radical), SbF\u2082, SbF\u2083, SbF\u2084, SbF\u2085. By adding Sb metal (Y) to a hot concentrated solution of SbF\u2083 (A4), one can generate lower fluorides (SbF\u2082, SbF). In water, SbF (A5) hydrolyzes into SbF\u2083 + HF. Thus the five binary Sb\u2013F compounds are SbF, SbF\u2082, SbF\u2083, SbF\u2084, and SbF\u2085.; answer - The five known binary fluorides of element Y (Sb) are: A1 = SbF\u2085: bright-red fuming liquid; decomposes at 293 K to SbF\u2083 (A2) + F\u2082; strong oxidizer that reacts with Xe to give Xe\u207aSbF\u2086\u207b. A2 = SbF\u2083: white crystalline solid; F% = 31.96 %. A3 = SbF\u2084: pale-yellow solid formed by direct fluorination of Sb with F\u2082; forms adducts with Xe. A4 = SbF\u2082: brown unstable solid, generated by adding Sb to hot concentrated SbF\u2083 solution. A5 = SbF (gas/radical): red unstable species produced under similar conditions; hydrolyzes in water to SbF\u2083 + HF.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - To map the inter-relationships: start with A1 (SbF5) which thermally decomposes into A2 (SbF3) + F2 and also oxidizes Xe to give [Xe][SbF6]. A3 (SbF4) arises by direct fluorination of Sb with F2. A4 (SbF2) is obtained by treating hot concentrated SbF3 solution with Sb metal (redox reduction). Addition of Sb metal to hot concentrated SbF2 yields A5 (SbF), which on contact with water hydrolyzes to SbF3 + HF. Each step follows from the given redox or thermal processes.; answer - A1 (SbF5) \u2192 upon heating at 293 K \u2192 A2 (SbF3) + F2; A1 oxidizes Xe \u2192 [Xe][SbF6]; A3 (SbF4) is prepared by direct fluorination of Sb with F2; A4 (SbF2) is formed by reducing SbF3 with Sb metal in hot concentrated solution; adding Sb metal to hot concentrated SbF2 produces A5 (SbF); in water A5 hydrolyzes to SbF3 + HF.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - From Sub-tasks 1 and 2 we identified element Y as Sb and A4 as the binary fluoride in which Sb has oxidation state +2, namely SbF2. Calculating its molar mass using Sb = 121.76 g\u00b7mol\u207b\u00b9 and F = 19.00 g\u00b7mol\u207b\u00b9 gives M(SbF2) = 121.76 + 2\u00d719.00 = 159.76 g\u00b7mol\u207b\u00b9. This value clearly falls in the 140\u2013160 g\u00b7mol\u207b\u00b9 range. Minor uncertainties from isotopic variations or experimental conditions would not shift the mass outside this interval.; answer - The molecular formula of A4 is SbF2, with a molar mass of approximately 159.76 g\u00b7mol\u207b\u00b9.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - The estimated molar mass of A4 (SbF2) is 159.76 g\u00b7mol\u207b\u00b9. Among the given intervals (220\u2013240, 140\u2013160, 160\u2013180, 110\u2013130), this value falls squarely within 140\u2013160 g\u00b7mol\u207b\u00b9, which corresponds to choice 2 (option B).; answer - B\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - The molar mass of A4 (SbF2) is Sb (121.76 g/mol) + 2\u00d7F (2\u00d719.00 g/mol) = 159.76 g/mol. This value lies within the 140\u2013160 g/mol interval, which corresponds to choice 2 (option B).; answer - B"

        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1a output: thinking - We first use the fluorine\u2010mass percent given for A2: \u03c9F=31.96%. For a formula YFn, \u03c9F = n\u00b719/(M(Y)+n\u00b719). Trying n=3 gives M(Y) \u2243 (57/0.3196 \u201357)=121.8, which matches Sb (121.8). Thus A2 is SbF3. A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2+F2, so A1 must be SbF4 (SbF4 \u2192 SbF3 + \u00bdF2). SbF4 is known as a red solid and is a strong oxidizer (it oxidizes Xe). A3 is obtained by direct fluorination of Y with F2, i.e. Sb+2.5 F2\u2192SbF5, and SbF5 also forms xenon complexes. Therefore: A1=SbF4, A2=SbF3, A3=SbF5.; answer - A1 = SbF4; A2 = SbF3; A3 = SbF5\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 1b output: thinking - We know from 1a that Y = Sb and the three known fluorides are SbF\u2083 (A2), SbF\u2084 (A1) and SbF\u2085 (A3). The only other binary Sb\u2013F species isolable are the low\u2010valent monofluoride SbF and difluoride SbF\u2082 (both unstable gases at room temperature) and higher polyfluoride adducts. Of those, SbF\u2082 can be generated in situ as a colorless vapor that dissolves when hot to give a concentrated, colorless solution (A4). Adding Sb metal (Y) in a 1:1 molar ratio to this hot SbF\u2082 solution reduces half of the SbF\u2082 to the adduct Sb\u2082F\u2084 (A5). In water, Sb\u2082F\u2084 disproportionates into SbF\u2083 and elemental Sb (two distinct products).

A2 has \u03c9F = 31.96%. Calculated F% for SbF3 is 3\u00d719/(121.8+57)\u224831.9%, matching exactly.  \n2. A1 is bright-red, decomposes at 293 K to A2 + F2, and oxidizes Xe. SbF4 is a red solid that thermally gives SbF3 + \u00bdF2 and is a strong oxidizer, consistent.  \n3. A3 is made by direct fluorination of Sb, is colorless, and forms Xe adducts. SbF5 is a colorless liquid from Sb + 2.5 F2 known to complex Xe, matching all clues.  \n4. A4 is a hot, concentrated, colorless solution of a low-valent Sb fluoride. SbF2 exists transiently in solution as a colorless species, fitting the description.  \n5. A5 forms when Sb is added 1:1 to the A4 solution and hydrolyzes to two products. The dimer Sb2F4 arises from two SbF2 units and disproportionates in water to SbF3 and elemental Sb, exactly as stated.  \n\nNo contradictions are found between the chemical behavior, physical properties, and composition of each proposed compound.

Using atomic masses Sb = 121.8 and F = 19.0, M(SbF2) = 121.8 + 2\u00d719.0 = 121.8 + 38.0 = 159.8 g\u00b7mol\u207b\u00b9. This value is consistent with its colorless, volatile behavior and fits physical data for SbF2.; answer - 159.8 g\u00b7mol\u207b\u00b9\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - The calculated molar mass of A4 is 159.8 g\u00b7mol\u207b\u00b9.
