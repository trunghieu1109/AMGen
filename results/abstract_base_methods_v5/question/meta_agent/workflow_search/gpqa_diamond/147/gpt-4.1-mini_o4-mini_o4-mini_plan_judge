Question: Example(question='Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known. The bright-red substance A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 (ɷF=31,96%) and fluorine. A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. A3 can also interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y with fluorine. By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained. In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances. Indicate the range in which the molecular weight of the substance A4 falls.', choice1='220-240', choice2='140-160', choice3='160-180', choice4='110-130', correct_index=4)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_6_147
proposed answer: The molar mass of A4 (SbF2) is Sb (121.76 g/mol) + 2×F (2×19.00 g/mol) = 159.76 g/mol. This value lies within the 140–160 g/mol interval, which corresponds to choice 2 (option B).

Answer:B

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_6_147
proposed answer: The calculated molar mass of A4 is 159.8 g·mol⁻¹. Comparing against the options:
A) 220–240 is far too high;
B) 140–160 includes 159.8 within its bounds;
C) 160–180 starts at 160, so 159.8 is just below and does not qualify;
D) 110–130 is well below. Only range B completely contains the value 159.8. Therefore the correct choice is B.
