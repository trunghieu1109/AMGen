For a formula YFn, ωF = n·19/(M(Y)+n·19). Trying n=3 gives M(Y) ≃ (57/0.3196 –57)=121.8, which matches Sb (121.8). Thus A2 is SbF3. A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2+F2, so A1 must be SbF4 (SbF4 → SbF3 + ½F2). SbF4 is known as a red solid and is a strong oxidizer (it oxidizes Xe). A3 is obtained by direct fluorination of Y with F2, i.e. Sb+2.5 F2→SbF5, and SbF5 also forms xenon complexes.

The only other binary Sb–F species isolable are the low‐valent monofluoride SbF and difluoride SbF₂ (both unstable gases at room temperature) and higher polyfluoride adducts. Of those, SbF₂ can be generated in situ as a colorless vapor that dissolves when hot to give a concentrated, colorless solution (A4). Adding Sb metal (Y) in a 1:1 molar ratio to this hot SbF₂ solution reduces half of the SbF₂ to the adduct Sb₂F₄ (A5). In water, Sb₂F₄ disproportionates into SbF₃ and elemental Sb (two distinct products). Hence: A4 = SbF₂; A5 = Sb₂F₄.; answer - A4 = SbF2; A5 = Sb2F4\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - Sub-task 2 requires checking each proposed assignment against the given clues and known antimony fluoride chemistry:\n\n1. A2 has ωF = 31.96%. Calculated F% for SbF3 is 3×19/(121.8+57)≈31.9%, matching exactly.  \n2. A1 is bright-red, decomposes at 293 K to A2 + F2, and oxidizes Xe.

SbF5 is a colorless liquid from Sb + 2.5 F2 known to complex Xe, matching all clues.  \n4. A4 is a hot, concentrated, colorless solution of a low-valent Sb fluoride. SbF2 exists transiently in solution as a colorless species, fitting the description.  \n5. A5 forms when Sb is added 1:1 to the A4 solution and hydrolyzes to two products.

A1 is the bright‐red platinum fluoride that decomposes at 293 K into a lower fluoride plus F₂: PtF₆ → PtF₅ + ½ F₂. The calculated fluorine mass fraction in PtF₅ (≈32 %) matches the given 31.96 % for A₂, so A₂ = PtF₅. A₃ is described as the fluoride obtained by direct fluorination of the metal Y (platinum) and also reacts with xenon – that is PtF₄, which can oxidize xenon under harsher conditions.; answer: A1 = PtF6, A2 = PtF5, A3 = PtF4\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent n9Pk, assigning A1-A3, thinking: We have an element Y that forms exactly five binary fluorides: YF2, YF3, YF4, YF5 and YF6.  Only platinum fits: PtF2–PtF6 are all known.  Among these, only PtF6 is a powerful enough oxidizer to oxidize Xe under ambient conditions (Sommefeld’s classic Xe+PtF6 → [Xe][PtF6]).  PtF6 is an intense red–brown volatile (“bright-red”) and over warm-up even at ~293\u2009K can lose F2 to give PtF5.  Computing the F‐content of PtF5: 5×19\u2009=95\u2009g\u2009mol–1 of F in 195\u2009g\u2009mol–1 Pt\u2009+\u200995\u2009g\u2009mol–1 F\u2009≈\u200932\u2009% F, close to the 31.96\u2009% given.  Finally, the lower fluoride PtF4 is also known to form Xe adducts under forcing conditions (A3 “also interacts” with xenon) and is straightforwardly prepared by direct fluorination of Pt metal under moderate conditions.

Hence: A4 = SbF₂; A5 = Sb₂F₄.; answer: A4 = SbF2; A5 = Sb2F4\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent uGpQ, assigning A4-A5, thinking: From Sub-task 1a we know Y = Sb and the known fluorides are SbF, SbF2, SbF3, SbF4, SbF5. A1–A3 are SbF4, SbF3, SbF5, leaving A4 and A5 as the lower fluorides SbF2 and SbF. The clue “1:1 molar ratio of Y to A4 gives A5” matches the comproportionation/disproportionation: Sb (0) + SbF2 → 2\u2009SbF. Thus A4 = SbF2 and A5 = SbF. The further note that A5 hydrolyzes in water into two products (Sb and SbF3 or Sb2O3 and HF depending on conditions) is consistent with the known instability of antimony(I) fluoride.; answer: A4 = SbF2; A5 = SbF\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent xOJd, assigning A4-A5, thinking: From sub‐task 1a we have A1=SbF4, A2=SbF3, A3=SbF5. Five binary fluorides of Sb are SbF, SbF2, SbF3, SbF4, SbF5. The two remaining (A4, A5) must be SbF and SbF2.\n\nClue: “By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.” The only reaction Sb + SbFn → products with 1∶1 gives Sb + SbF2 → 2\u2009SbF. That identifies A4=SbF2, A5=SbF.\n\nClue: “In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.” SbF hydrolyzes/disproportionates in water to give elemental antimony (Sb^0) and HF (or SbF3) – two products.

The only limitation is that SbF2 exists primarily as a transient radical in solution rather than an isolable stable compound, and Sb2F4 is poorly characterized and may oligomerize.; answer: The proposed assignments are correct and self-consistent with known antimony fluoride chemistry.\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent IOU7, refining compound assignments, thinking: Sub-task 2 requires checking each proposed assignment against the given clues and known antimony fluoride chemistry:\n\n1.
