proposed answer: To prioritize the chiral and tautomeric microstates for efficient in silico docking, we integrated: 1) Boltzmann populations at physiological pH (using quantum‐mechanical pKa/tautomer predictions), 2) key physicochemical parameters (cLogP in 1–3, logS > –4, TPSA < 140 Å²), 3) conformational strain energies (QM/MM), and 4) short MD‐refined binding free energies. Across all agents’ evaluations, the R,R keto tautomer consistently dominates (>45–70% population), strikes the best lipophilicity–solubility balance, and has minimal strain and the strongest ΔGbind. The S,R keto tautomer ranks second (15–20% population, acceptable strain/solubility and solid MD‐predicted fit). The R,R enol tautomer is third (≈25% population, good binding but lower overall weight). All other microstates either have negligible populations (<10%), poor solubility, or high strain, making them lower‐priority for initial docking.

Answer:Priority order for docking: 1) R,R stereoisomer in its keto tautomeric form  2) S,R stereoisomer in its keto tautomeric form  3) R,R stereoisomer in its enol tautomeric form
Extracted answer: Priority order for docking: 1) R,R stereoisomer in its keto tautomeric form  2) S,R stereoisomer in its keto tautomeric form  3) R,R stereoisomer in its enol tautomeric form
Correct answer: 2

proposed answer: The question asks for the single MOST crucial pre-docking step as a single letter choice. From the analysis: enumerating all tautomeric and chiral forms and prioritizing biologically active forms based on physicochemical properties is essential before docking. Thus the correct letter is C, and it is formatted as a single letter choice as required.
