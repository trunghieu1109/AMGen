Question: Example(question='toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid, forming product 1.\n\n1 is treated with MnO2 and H2SO4, forming product 2.\n\n2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide, forming product 3.\n\nwhat is the molecular symmetry group of 3?', choice1='cs', choice2='c2h', choice3='c3', choice4='d2h', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_36_30
proposed answer: Product 3 is the para-nitrobenzoate anion, which has one C₂ rotation axis through the para-substituted carbon atoms and a single mirror plane perpendicular to that axis (the plane bisecting the aromatic ring). There is no inversion center, no three-fold axis, and no multiple C₂ axes. These symmetry elements (E, C₂, and σ_h) define the C₂h point group. Among the provided options (cs, c2h, c3, d2h), C₂h is the only match.
