        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The classic Mott\u2013Gurney law is derived by combining Poisson\u2019s equation with the drift current equation under space\u2010charge\u2010limited conditions. In that derivation one assumes: (1) only one type of mobile charge carrier is present (single\u2010carrier) so that injected charges dominate the internal field; (2) the material is trap\u2010free, so no charges are immobilized in deep levels; (3) contacts inject carriers without any barrier (ideal ohmic contacts), ensuring carrier density at the contact exceeds that in the bulk; (4) drift current vastly exceeds diffusion current, so the diffusion term can be neglected; (5) mobility is field\u2010 and carrier\u2010density\u2010independent (constant \u00b5); (6) no recombination or generation in the bulk. Under these assumptions, the J\u221dV\u00b2/L\u00b3 law emerges.; answer - Trap\u2010free single\u2010carrier device with ideal ohmic contacts, negligible diffusion current, and drift\u2010only, space\u2010charge\u2010limited transport.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - The Mott\u2013Gurney law is derived under very specific assumptions about the material and contacts. To ensure the law\u2019s validity, we must clarify each condition: that carriers are not trapped, only one carrier type dominates, contacts inject carriers without barriers, and current is driven by drift rather than diffusion. By defining each term explicitly, we link the physical requirements back to the assumptions used in the J\u221dV\u00b2/L\u00b3 derivation.; answer - Trap-free device: A semiconductor or insulator with negligible deep energy levels that can immobilize injected carriers, ensuring all charge contributes to current rather than being held in traps. Single-carrier device: A structure in which only one type of mobile charge (either electrons or holes) is injected and transported, so space charge is controlled by that one carrier type. Ohmic contact: A metal\u2013semiconductor interface designed to inject carriers freely into the semiconductor without an energy barrier, yielding linear I\u2013V behavior at low fields. Schottky contact: A metal\u2013semiconductor junction that forms a rectifying barrier for carriers, impeding one carrier type and preventing ideal space-charge injection. Carrier injection barrier: The energy barrier at the contact that carriers must overcome to enter the semiconductor; a nonzero barrier reduces injected carrier density and invalidates SCLC assumptions. Drift current: The component of current arising from carriers moving under the influence of an electric field; in SCLC, drift must dominate over diffusion. Diffusion current: The component of current due to carrier motion from high to low concentration regions; for the Mott\u2013Gurney law to hold, this term must be negligible compared to drift.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - The Mott\u2013Gurney law derivation assumes: (1) a trap-free medium so no carriers are immobilized in traps, (2) only one type of mobile charge dominates (single-carrier), (3) ideal Ohmic contacts with no injection barrier so carriers are injected freely, and (4) drift current dominates with diffusion negligible. Choice 1 explicitly lists a trap-free single-carrier device, no injection barrier (Ohmic contact), and negligible diffusion current, matching all key assumptions.
