In that derivation one assumes: (1) only one type of mobile charge carrier is present (single‐carrier) so that injected charges dominate the internal field; (2) the material is trap‐free, so no charges are immobilized in deep levels; (3) contacts inject carriers without any barrier (ideal ohmic contacts), ensuring carrier density at the contact exceeds that in the bulk; (4) drift current vastly exceeds diffusion current, so the diffusion term can be neglected; (5) mobility is field‐ and carrier‐density‐independent (constant µ); (6) no recombination or generation in the bulk.

I define each concept by referring back to those assumptions: trap‐free means no deep localized states to immobilize carriers; single‐carrier means only one sign of mobile charge dominates; Ohmic versus Schottky contacts describe whether injection is barrier‐free; carrier injection barrier is the energy offset at the interface; drift versus diffusion current distinguish field‐driven from concentration‐gradient‐driven transport. These definitions clarify exactly when the Mott–Gurney equation holds.; answer: Trap-free device: A semiconductor with negligible deep trap states or localized energy levels, so injected carriers remain mobile and are not captured. Single-carrier device: A device in which only one type of charge carrier (either electrons or holes) contributes significantly to current; the opposite carrier is absent or immobile. Ohmic contact: An electrode–semiconductor interface with negligible energy barrier, providing linear I–V behavior and efficient carrier injection under applied bias. Schottky contact: An interface with a significant metal–semiconductor energy barrier, yielding rectifying behavior and limiting carrier injection. Carrier injection barrier: The energy offset at the contact interface that carriers must overcome to enter the semiconductor; low or zero barrier (Ohmic) is assumed for Mott–Gurney. Drift current: Charge transport driven by the electric field; in SCLC, drift dominates and diffusion is neglected. Diffusion current: Transport driven by spatial gradients in carrier concentration; assumed negligible under strong space‐charge limited conditions.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent 67KB, clarifying key terms, thinking: Based on the Sub‐task 1 analysis, the Mott–Gurney equation assumes no traps, only one mobile carrier, ideal (barrier‐free) contacts, and drift‐dominated transport. Each term below corresponds to one of those assumptions and clarifies exactly why it matters for the V²/L³ law to hold.; answer: Trap‐free device: A material with no deep or distributed localized energy states that can capture carriers. In a trap‐free solid, every injected carrier remains mobile, so the space charge builds up as predicted by J∝V² without loss to trapping. Single‐carrier device: A device in which only one type of carrier (either electrons or holes) is injected and transported. This excludes recombination/generation and simplifies Poisson’s equation to a single‐charge‐type form. Ohmic contact: An electrode–semiconductor interface that injects (or collects) the selected carrier type with negligible energy barrier, yielding a linear I–V relation at low bias. It ensures the injected carrier density at the boundary is high enough to sustain space‐charge‐limited drift. Schottky contact: A metal–semiconductor junction that forms an energy barrier for majority (or minority) carrier injection. Such a barrier would limit injection current and invalidate the assumption of barrier‐free contact. Carrier injection barrier: The energy offset at a contact that carriers must overcome to enter the semiconductor. A nonzero barrier reduces injection efficiency and distorts the simple V² law. Drift current: The component of electrical current driven by the electric field (J_drift=q·µ·n·E). The Mott–Gurney law presumes drift dominates over diffusion. Diffusion current: The component due to concentration gradients (J_diff=–q·D·dn/dx). Negligible diffusion ensures the current is purely field‐driven, allowing the analytic V²/L³ solution.\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent bXDL, evaluating choices, thinking: The Mott–Gurney law requires (1) a trap-free semiconductor, (2) only one type of mobile carrier, (3) ideal Ohmic contacts (no injection barrier), and (4) drift-dominated current (diffusion negligible).\n\nChoice 1 states exactly a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier (i.e. Ohmic contact) and negligible diffusion current.
