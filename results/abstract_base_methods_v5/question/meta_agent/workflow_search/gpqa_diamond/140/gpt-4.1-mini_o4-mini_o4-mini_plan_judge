Question: Example(question='1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. How many possible organic products are there in this reaction?', choice1='4', choice2='3', choice3='1', choice4='2', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_33_140
proposed answer: Under NaNH2/condensed NH3, 1-bromobenzene-2-D undergoes benzyne formation by deprotonation at either C6–H or C2–D, giving two benzyne isomers. Each benzyne can be attacked by NH2– at either of its two carbons, followed by protonation or deuteration, yielding four distinct aniline products (2-deuteroaniline, 6-deuteroaniline, aniline, and 2-aniline). Therefore, there are 4 unique organic products, corresponding to choice A).

Answer:A)
Extracted answer: A)
Correct answer: 2

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_33_140
proposed answer: Subtask 4c established three distinct organic products—two major deuterated anilines (with D at different ring positions after amination) plus one minor unlabeled aniline recovered without deuterium exchange. The multiple‐choice options are A)4, B)3, C)1, D)2. Since the total count is three, the correct matching choice is B.

Answer:B
Extracted answer: B
Correct answer: 2
