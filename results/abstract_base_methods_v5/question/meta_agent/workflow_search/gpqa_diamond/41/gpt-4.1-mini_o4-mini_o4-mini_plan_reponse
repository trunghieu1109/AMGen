            "Astronomers are studying a system of three exoplanets (Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3) with circular orbits discovered through the TTV method. They have found that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 2.3. They have also found that the ratio of the masses between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.15, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 1.35. By what factor is the orbital period of Planet3 larger than that of Planet1, if the albedo for all three planets is equal to 0.3 (similar to that of Earth)?",

        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The equilibrium temperature of a planet with albedo A at distance a from its star is given by\nT_eq = [L(1\u2013A)/(16\u03c0\u03c3a^2)]^(1/4) \u221d a^(\u20131/2)  (for fixed L and A).  Thus T1/T2 = (a2/a1)^(1/2) \u21d2 a2/a1 = (T1/T2)^2, and similarly T2/T3 = (a3/a2)^(1/2) \u21d2 a3/a2 = (T2/T3)^2.\n\nPlugging in the ratios:\nT1/T2 = 1.4 \u21d2 a2/a1 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96\nT2/T3 = 2.3 \u21d2 a3/a2 = (2.3)^2 = 5.29; answer - a2/a1 \u2248 1.96,  a3/a2 \u2248 5.29\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - From Sub-task 1 we found a2/a1 \u2248 1.96 and a3/a2 \u2248 5.29. The overall ratio a3/a1 is the product of these two intermediate ratios: a3/a1 = (a2/a1)\u00d7(a3/a2) = 1.96 \u00d7 5.29 \u2248 10.37.; answer - a3/a1 \u2248 10.37\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - Kepler\u2019s third law states that for planets orbiting the same star, P\u00b2 \u221d a\u00b3. Taking the ratio for Planet3 and Planet1 gives (P3/P1)\u00b2 = (a3/a1)\u00b3. From Sub-task 2 we have a3/a1 \u2248 10.37, so P3/P1 = (10.37)^(3/2). Compute the square root first: \u221a10.37 \u2248 3.22, then multiply by 10.37: 10.37 \u00d7 3.22 \u2248 33.4. Thus the orbital period of Planet3 is about 33.4 times that of Planet1. This calculation assumes circular orbits, negligible planet masses compared to the star, and ignores gravitational perturbations and eccentricities.; answer - ~ 33.4\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - Applying Kepler\u2019s third law, P3/P1 = (a3/a1)^(3/2). From previous sub-tasks we have a3/a1 \u224810.37, so P3/P1 \u2248(10.37)^(3/2) \u224833.4.
