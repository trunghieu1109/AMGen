In the lab frame the particle’s lifetime is dilated to γ\u2009τ0. The time it takes to traverse the radius R at speed v≈c is t_lab=R/(βc), with β≈1 for ultra-relativistic particles.

In the lab frame, time dilation extends the lifetime to τ=γτ0, and the particle takes t=L/(βc) to reach the detector wall at distance L=R, with β=v/c. Thus the probability of surviving to the wall is P=exp(−t/τ)=exp[−(R/(βc))/(γτ0)] = exp(−R/(βcγτ0)). For ultra‐relativistic speeds β≈1 this simplifies to P(γ)=exp(−R/(cγτ0)).; answer: P(γ)=exp\\bigl(−R/(βcγτ0)\\), which for β→1 becomes P(γ)=exp(−R/(cγτ0)).\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent 2npQ, formulating relationship, thinking: We want the survival probability P that a particle produced at the center travels distance R without decaying. In its rest frame the mean lifetime is τ₀, but in the lab frame time is dilated by γ so the lifetime is γ\u2009τ₀. The time to reach radius R at speed v=βc is t_lab=R/(βc). The decays follow an exponential law in lab time: P=exp(−t_lab/(γ\u2009τ₀)). Substituting t_lab gives P(γ)=exp(−R/(β\u2009c\u2009γ\u2009τ₀)). For ultra-relativistic speeds β≈1 this simplifies to P(γ)≈exp(−R/(c\u2009τ₀\u2009γ)). This relation connects γ, τ₀ and the fraction reaching the walls.; answer: P(γ)=exp(−t_lab/(γτ₀))=exp(−R/(βcγτ₀))≈exp(−R/(cτ₀γ)) for β≈1\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent sUmx, calculating decay length, thinking: We know survival probability P=exp(-R/L) where L=γcτ0 is the decay length. Given γ≈20 and R=30 m, and observed P=1/3, we solve L = -R/ln(P). Substituting gives L = -30 m / ln(1/3) ≃ 30 m / 1.0986 ≃ 27.3 m. This refines the mean travel distance before decay based on critic feedback retaining β≈1 and exponential decay law.; answer: Approximately 27.3 meters\n<SEPERATOR>\nCritic agent 82Xg, feedback: The simple extraction of L = -R/ln(P) ≃ 27.3 m assumes (1) purely exponential decay with no spatial or temporal variations in γ or β, (2) β≈1 exactly, ignoring sub-percent retardation at γ≈20, (3) a single rest-frame lifetime τ₀ with no distribution, (4) no angular or energy spread of the emitted particles, and (5) a perfectly spherical detector with uniform acceptance. In reality, fluctuations in Lorentz factor, energy dependence of τ₀, non-ideal geometry, detector inefficiencies, and potential magnetic or material effects can all shift the effective decay length away from the 27.3 m estimate.; correct: Approximately 27.3 meters\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent sUmx, refining decay length, thinking: We use the exponential survival law P=exp(−R/L) with L=γcτ₀ the mean decay length. Given the observed fraction P=1/3 reaching R=30 m, we invert to find L=−R/ln(P). Numerically, L=−30 m/ln(1/3)≈30 m/1.0986≈27.3 m.

From Sub‐task 3 we found for the original γ₀≈20 that L₀ = –30\u2009m/ln(1/3) ≈27.3\u2009m. Now we want P_new = 2/3 at the same radius R = 30\u2009m, so L_new = –R/ln(P_new) = –30\u2009m/ln(2/3) ≈ 74.0\u2009m. Since L scales linearly with γ, the required Lorentz factor is γ_new = γ₀\u2009(L_new/L₀) ≈ 20\u2009×\u2009(74.0\u2009m / 27.3\u2009m) ≈ 54.2. Thus a Lorentz factor of about 54 is needed to have two‐thirds of the particles reach the detector walls.; answer: Approximately 54\n<SEPERATOR>\nCritic agent laRz, feedback: The derivation correctly starts from the exponential survival probability P(R)=exp(–R/L), uses the initial γ₀=20 to find L₀=–30\u2009m/ln(1/3)≈27.3\u2009m, then inverts P=2/3 to get L_new=–30\u2009m/ln(2/3)≈74.0\u2009m and scales γ linearly (γ_new=γ₀·L_new/L₀≈20·74.0/27.3≈54.2). However, it assumes: (1) a single, fixed Lorentz factor for all particles, ignoring any energy spread; (2) purely radial, straight‐line motion with no angular or transverse momentum spread; (3) no energy loss or interactions before decay; (4) an ideal spherical detector with infinitely thin walls and perfect detection efficiency; (5) negligible statistical fluctuations and systematic uncertainties in cτ₀. In practice, variations in particle energy, geometry effects, detector material, and lifetime uncertainties will shift the required γ, so ≈54 is an idealized estimate.; correct: Approximately 54\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent oFm2, refining required Lorentz factor, thinking: We use the exponential survival law P(R)=exp(–R/L) with mean decay length L=γ\u2009c\u2009τ₀.
