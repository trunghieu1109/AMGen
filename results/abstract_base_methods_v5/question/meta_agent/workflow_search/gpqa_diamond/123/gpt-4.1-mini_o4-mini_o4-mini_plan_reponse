        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The problem statement specifies that particles are produced at the center of a spherical detector. It then gives four key numerical details:\n1. Detector radius: \u201cThe radius of the detector is 30 meters.\u201d\n2. Initial Lorentz factor: \u201cultra-relativistic velocities highly centered around Lorentz factor of ~20.\u201d\n3. Initial fraction reaching walls: \u201cOn average, one third of these fast-decaying particles reaches the detector inner walls.\u201d\n4. Target fraction: \u201cWhat Lorentz factor is needed in order to have about two thirds of these particles reaching the detector inner walls?\u201d\n\nI have therefore identified and extracted all given parameters as requested.; answer - Detector radius = 30 m; initial Lorentz factor \u2243 20; initial fraction reaching walls = 1/3; target fraction reaching walls = 2/3.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - We need to relate the survival probability P of an unstable particle to its proper lifetime \u03c40, its Lorentz factor \u03b3, and the distance R it must travel to reach the detector wall. In the lab frame the particle\u2019s lifetime is dilated to \u03b3\u2009\u03c40. The time it takes to traverse the radius R at speed v\u2248c is t_lab=R/(\u03b2c), with \u03b2\u22481 for ultra-relativistic particles. The fraction that survives is given by the exponential decay law N/N0 = exp(\u2212t_lab/(\u03b3\u2009\u03c40)). Substituting t_lab yields\n\nP(R)=exp(\u2212R/(\u03b2\u2009\u03b3\u2009c\u2009\u03c40)) \u2243 exp(\u2212R/(\u03b3\u2009c\u2009\u03c40)).\n\nWe can invert this to find the required \u03b3 for a given target P:\n\n\u03b3=\u2212R/(\u03b2\u2009c\u2009\u03c40\u2009ln\u2009P) \u2243 \u2212R/(c\u2009\u03c40\u2009ln\u2009P).\n\nThis formula shows how increasing \u03b3 (time dilation) raises the survival fraction from 1/3 to 2/3.; answer - The survival probability for a particle to reach radius R is\nP(R)=exp(\u2212R/(\u03b2\u2009\u03b3\u2009c\u2009\u03c40))\u2243exp(\u2212R/(\u03b3\u2009c\u2009\u03c40)),\nwhich inverted gives the required Lorentz factor\n\u03b3=\u2212R/(\u03b2\u2009c\u2009\u03c40\u2009ln\u2009P)\u2243\u2212R/(c\u2009\u03c40\u2009ln\u2009P).\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - We use the exponential survival law P=exp(\u2212R/L) with L=\u03b3c\u03c4\u2080 the mean decay length. Given the observed fraction P=1/3 reaching R=30 m, we invert to find L=\u2212R/ln(P). Numerically, L=\u221230 m/ln(1/3)\u224830 m/1.0986\u224827.3 m. This refinement holds under assumptions of purely exponential decay, \u03b2\u22481, constant \u03c4\u2080, no energy or angular spread, and ideal detector geometry. Real-world effects\u2014\u03b3 fluctuations, slight \u03b2<1 corrections, \u03c4\u2080 distributions, and detector inhomogeneities\u2014could shift this estimate, but 27.3 m is the effective decay length based on the provided data.; answer - Approximately 27.3 meters\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - We use the exponential survival law P(R)=exp(\u2013R/L) with mean decay length L=\u03b3\u2009c\u2009\u03c4\u2080. From the original case (\u03b3\u2080\u224820) and P\u2080=1/3 at R=30\u2009m, we find L\u2080=\u201330\u2009m/ln(1/3)\u224827.3\u2009m. For the new target survival fraction P_new=2/3 at the same radius, invert P_new=exp(\u2013R/L_new) to get L_new=\u201330\u2009m/ln(2/3)\u224874.0\u2009m. Since L scales linearly with \u03b3 (\u03b2\u22481), the required Lorentz factor is \u03b3_new=\u03b3\u2080\u00b7(L_new/L\u2080)\u224820\u00b7(74.0/27.3)\u224854.2. Refining with critic feedback, we note this neglects energy spread, slight \u03b2<1 corrections, interactions before decay, and real detector inhomogeneities, so \u224854 is an idealized estimate.; answer - Approximately a Lorentz factor of 54 is required to have two\u2010thirds of the particles reach the 30 m detector walls.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - From the decay\u2010length formula L=\u03b3\u03b2c\u03c4 and the requirement that 2/3 of the particles survive to 30 m, we solved for \u03b3 and found \u03b3\u224854.2.
