At C2 is a formyl (–CHO) aldehyde group; at C5 is a vinyl (–CH=CH2) substituent; and at C1 (by carboxy naming) is a carboxylic acid (–COOH) at C1 if counted from the acid. Thus the structure contains: one cyclohexene ring, one aldehyde, one carboxylic acid, one exocyclic vinyl double bond, plus the ring’s internal C=C bond.

The carboxylic acid at C1 can either decarboxylate (losing CO2, leaving H) or be fully reduced to a methyl.

The only product consistent with full reduction plus decarboxylation has formula C9H18 (2-methyl-5-ethylcyclohexane). Calculating IHD: (2C + 2 – H)/2 = (2×9 + 2 − 18)/2 = (18 + 2 − 18)/2 = 2/2 = 1.

Aldehydes (–CHO) are deoxygenated to give methyl groups. Carboxylic acids (–COOH) undergo reductive decarboxylation: the COOH is expelled as CO₂ and the carbon is lost, leaving a hydrogen in its place. Both isolated C=C bonds—internal (cyclohexene) and exocyclic (vinyl)—are hydrogenated to saturated C–C bonds. No significant rearrangements or polymerizations occur under these conditions.; answer: Aldehyde at C2 → methyl (–CHO → –CH₃); carboxylic acid at C1 → decarboxylation (–COOH lost as CO₂, replaced by H); vinyl at C5 → ethyl (–CH=CH₂ → –CH₂–CH₃); internal cyclohexene → saturated cyclohexane ring\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent iOCa, evaluating functional group behavior, thinking: Red phosphorus with excess HI (the HI/P reduction) is a strongly reducing, HI-generating system that can both hydrogenate C=C bonds and reduce/cleave C–O bonds. It is well known to convert aldehydes to hydrocarbons, decarboxylate carboxylic acids to remove CO2 and leave an H in their place, and hydrogenate both internal and exocyclic double bonds. Thus each functional group will be fully reduced or lost under these conditions.; answer: Under red P/excess HI: 1) Aldehyde (–CHO) is reduced in two steps (to alcohol, then to alkane) giving a –CH3. 2) Carboxylic acid (–COOH) undergoes decarboxylation (losing CO2) and subsequent reduction, replacing COOH with H. 3) Vinyl substituent (–CH=CH2) is hydrogenated to –CH2–CH3 (ethyl). 4) Ring alkene (internal C=C) is hydrogenated to a saturated C–C single bond.
