Question: Example(question='What is the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product obtained when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess of HI?', choice1='1', choice2='3', choice3='0', choice4='5', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_42_182
proposed answer: From the previous calculation the product has IHD=(2×8+2−12)/2=3. The choices are 1 (A), 3 (B), 0 (C), and 5 (D). Since our computed index of hydrogen deficiency exactly matches 3, the correct choice is B.

Answer:B
Extracted answer: B
Correct answer: 1

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_42_182
proposed answer: The product obtained after Clemmensen reduction and decarboxylation is C₉H₁₈. Its index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) is calculated as (2·C + 2 – H)/2 = (2·9 + 2 – 18)/2 = (20 – 18)/2 = 1. The provided multiple‐choice options are A) 1, B) 3, C) 0, D) 5. Since the computed IHD of 1 matches option A, the correct choice is A.

Answer:A
Extracted answer: A
Correct answer: 1
