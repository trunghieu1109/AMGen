Question: Example(question='You have prepared an unknown organic compound. The following 1H NMR data was obtained:\n1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.0 (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz), 5.5 (1H, dq), 2.1 (3H, s), 1.6 (3H, d)\nIdentify the unknown compound as either Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, or Trans-butenyl acetate.', choice1='Trans-propenyl acetate', choice2='Cis-propenyl acetate', choice3='Cis-butenyl acetate', choice4='Trans-butenyl acetate', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_5_54
proposed answer: The NMR data show a doublet at δ7.00 ppm with J = 16.0 Hz and a doublet of quartets at δ5.50 ppm coupling 16.0 Hz to the other vinyl proton and ~7 Hz to an adjacent methyl. A 16 Hz vicinal coupling is characteristic of a trans‐alkene. The absence of signals around 4–4.5 ppm rules out a butenyl fragment. The singlet at δ2.10 ppm is the acetate methyl, and the doublet at δ1.60 ppm (J ≈ 7 Hz) is the allylic methyl. This pattern corresponds to trans-propenyl acetate, choice A.
