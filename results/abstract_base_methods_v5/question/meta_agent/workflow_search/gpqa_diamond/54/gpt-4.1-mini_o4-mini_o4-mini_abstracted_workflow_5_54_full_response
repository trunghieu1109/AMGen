Number of signals: Propenyl acetate (CH3COO–CH=CH–CH3) has only one vinyl CH and one vinyl CH3 plus the acetyl CH3, giving four distinct signals. Butenyl acetate (CH3COO–CH2–CH=CH–CH3) would show extra CH2 signals, increasing the number of resonances.\n2. Vinyl coupling constants: Trans-alkene vicinal J values are large (14–18 Hz), whereas cis-alkene J values are smaller (6–12 Hz).\n3. Splitting patterns: In propenyl acetate, the vinyl CH appears as a doublet (Jtrans ≈16 Hz) from coupling to the other vinyl H or CH3, and the vinyl CH at δ5.5 appears as a doublet of quartets (dq) from coupling to both the trans CH (J≈16 Hz) and the CH3 methyl (J≈7 Hz). The vinyl CH3 appears as a doublet (J≈7 Hz), and the acetyl CH3 as a singlet.\n4. Butenyl acetate would show additional multiplets for the CH2 group, which are absent.\nTherefore, the pattern of only four signals and a large J=16 Hz indicates a trans-propenyl acetate.; answer: Trans-propenyl acetate\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent XYqr, identifying characteristic NMR patterns, thinking: To distinguish propenyl vs. butenyl acetate and cis vs. trans by 1H NMR, I compare number of vinyl protons, their integrations, and J‐values. A propenyl acetate has only two alkene protons (one CH and one CH), whereas a butenyl acetate would show three alkene protons (–CH=CH–CH=). The large coupling constant (J≈16 Hz) between the two vinyl protons at δ7.00 and δ5.50 indicates a trans relationship. A cis‐alkene shows J≈6–12 Hz. Also, the dq at δ5.50 (1H) arises from coupling to the trans vinyl CH and to the methyl at δ1.60. Butenyl acetate would display additional vinyl signals and different splitting. Thus the observed pattern (two vinyl protons, J=16 Hz, no extra alkene signals) is diagnostic of trans‐propenyl acetate.; answer: Characteristic NMR features: \n• Propenyl acetate shows only two vinyl protons (integrations 1H each) vs. butenyl acetate’s three.  \n• A trans-alkene gives a large vicinal coupling J≈16 Hz (observed at δ7.00 d, J=16 Hz), whereas a cis-alkene JJ≈6–12 Hz.  \n• The δ5.50 dq (1H) arises from coupling to the trans partner (J≈16 Hz) and to its methyl group (observed δ1.60 d).  \nTherefore, the combination of only two vinyl protons and a large J≈16 Hz is diagnostic of trans-propenyl acetate.\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent zTGo, correlating NMR signals to proton environments, thinking: We need to assign each of the four 1H NMR signals (δ7.00 d J=16.0 Hz; δ5.50 dq; δ2.10 s; δ1.60 d) to specific proton environments in the four candidate isomers and see which pattern matches only one. From Sub-task 2 we know: a trans-propenyl acetate (CH3–CH=CH–OAc) gives two vinylic H’s with a large trans J≈16\u2009Hz, one of those H’s (the one adjacent to CH3) also couples to that CH3 (J≈6–8 Hz) producing a dq, plus an acetate Me singlet (~2.1 ppm) and an allylic Me doublet (J≈6–8 Hz). No CH2 signals appear. The observed pattern matches only trans-propenyl acetate.; answer: Signal assignments for trans-propenyl acetate (CH3–CH=CH–OAc):\n• δ 7.00 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz): vinylic H adjacent to the OAc group (H_a), showing a large trans coupling to H_b.\n• δ 5.50 ppm (1H, dq, J_trans = 16.0 Hz, J_vic ≈ 6–8 Hz): vinylic H adjacent to the CH3 (H_b), coupling trans to H_a and to the allylic methyl.\n• δ 2.10 ppm (3H, s): acetate methyl (OAc–CH3).\n• δ 1.60 ppm (3H, d, J ≈ 6–8 Hz): allylic methyl (CH3–CH=), coupling to H_b.\nOnly trans-propenyl acetate displays this exact set of large trans J, dq pattern, methyl doublet, and no CH2 signals.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCritic agent WkO6, providing feedback, thinking: The NMR signal assignments rely on established correlations: the large trans coupling (J≈16 Hz) and chemical shifts place one vinylic H at δ7.00 ppm (d, J=16 Hz, adjacent to OAc) and the other at δ5.50 ppm (dq, J_trans=16 Hz, J_vic≈6–8 Hz, adjacent to CH₃). The singlet at δ2.10 ppm matches the acetate methyl, and the doublet at δ1.60 ppm (J≈6–8 Hz) corresponds to the allylic methyl. This pattern uniquely fits trans-propenyl acetate. However, these correlations have limitations: chemical shifts can overlap among different functional groups; coupling constants may change with solvent or temperature; long-range or second-order couplings can complicate multiplet analysis; integration can be skewed by baseline or relaxation effects; and conformational exchange or impurities can obscure signals. Ultimately, full structural confirmation often requires complementary data (e.g., 2D NMR, IR, MS).; answer: The correlations and observed coupling constants uniquely identify trans-propenyl acetate, though overlaps, solvent effects, and complex coupling patterns can limit confidence without further spectroscopic data.\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent zTGo, refining correlation, thinking: We need to assign each of the four observed 1H NMR signals to specific proton environments in each candidate and see which pattern uniquely fits.

Butenyl acetates would show additional –OCH2– signals (~4–4.5 ppm) and more complex splitting from two CH2 protons, which are absent here. The singlet at δ2.10 ppm confirms the acetate methyl.

These data unambiguously point to trans-propenyl acetate.; answer: A)\n<SEPERATOR>\nFinal Decision agent on best matching compound, thinking: The NMR data show two vinylic protons with a large vicinal coupling constant of 16.0 Hz, which is diagnostic of a trans‐alkene (cis alkenes give ~8–12 Hz). The δ7.00 ppm doublet (J = 16.0 Hz) and the δ5.50 ppm doublet of quartets (J = 16.0 Hz to the other vinyl proton and ≈7 Hz to an adjacent methyl) match a CH=CH–CH₃ fragment (propenyl). The singlet at δ2.10 ppm corresponds to the acetate methyl, and the doublet at δ1.60 ppm (J ≈ 7 Hz) is the allylic methyl. No methylene signals near 4–4.5 ppm are observed, ruling out any butenyl acetate. Thus the only candidate consistent with a trans‐alkene, a propenyl side chain, and the observed multiplicities is trans‐propenyl acetate.; answer: A)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT agent 51mL, selecting final multiple-choice answer, thinking: The NMR data show a doublet at δ7.00 ppm with J = 16.0 Hz and a doublet of quartets at δ5.50 ppm coupling 16.0 Hz to the other vinyl proton and ~7 Hz to an adjacent methyl. A 16 Hz vicinal coupling is characteristic of a trans‐alkene. The absence of signals around 4–4.5 ppm rules out a butenyl fragment. The singlet at δ2.10 ppm is the acetate methyl, and the doublet at δ1.60 ppm (J ≈ 7 Hz) is the allylic methyl. This pattern corresponds to trans-propenyl acetate, choice A.; answer: A)', iteration_idx=-1)]
