Vicinal C=C coupling constants:  \n   \u2022 trans-alkenes give large J \u2248 15\u201318 Hz  \n   \u2022 cis-alkenes give moderate J \u2248 8\u201312 Hz  \n\n2. Propenyl vs. butenyl acetate fragmentation:  \n   \u2022 Propenyl acetate (CH3\u2013CH=CH\u2013OAc) shows exactly two sp2 H\u2019s and one methyl on the double bond (splitting the vinylic H into a doublet of quartets), plus the acetate methyl (singlet).  \n   \u2022 Butenyl acetate (e.g. CH3\u2013CH2\u2013CH=CH\u2013OAc) has an additional CH2 group: you would see a CH2 quartet or multiplet (4.0\u20134.5 ppm for \u2013OCH2\u2013) and two different alkene proton patterns.  \n\n3. Multiplicity patterns:  \n   \u2022 A propenyl H adjacent to CH3 appears as a dq (coupling to trans\u2010vinyl H, J\u224816 Hz, and to CH3, J\u22486\u20138 Hz).  \n   \u2022 The CH3 on the double bond appears as a doublet (J\u22486\u20138 Hz).  \n\nThus the diagnostic features are:  \n\u2013 A large J\u224816 Hz between the two vinylic protons signals a trans configuration.  \n\u2013 The dq/vinyl doublet pattern and absence of CH2 signals distinguish propenyl from butenyl acetate.; answer - Diagnostic NMR patterns distinguishing propenyl vs. butenyl acetate and cis vs. trans:  \n1) Vicinal C=C J\u2010values: trans \u224815\u201318 Hz, cis \u22488\u201312 Hz.  \n2) Propenyl acetate shows only two sp2 protons (one appears as a dq from coupling to the other vinyl H and to a methyl, the other as a large\u2010J doublet) plus an acetate Me singlet; butenyl acetate adds an \u2013OCH2\u2013 signal (~4\u20134.5 ppm) and extra alkene proton patterns.  \n3) The methyl on the double bond in propenyl appears as a doublet (J\u22486\u20138 Hz) from coupling to its adjacent vinylic H.  \n\nTogether these features let you tell propenyl vs. butenyl and cis vs. trans apart.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - We need to assign each of the four observed 1H NMR signals to specific proton environments in each candidate and see which pattern uniquely fits. From Sub-task 2 we know that:\n1) trans-alkene vicinal J\u224815\u201318 Hz vs. cis\u22488\u201312 Hz.  \n2) Propenyl acetate has two sp2 H\u2019s: one adjacent to OAc (d, large J), one adjacent to CH\u2083 (dq: trans J + methyl J), plus an acetate Me singlet and an allylic Me doublet.  Butenyl acetates add an \u2013OCH\u2082\u2013 signal (~4\u20134.5 ppm) and extra CH\u2082 splitting patterns.  \n\nObservations:  \n\u2022 A doublet at \u03b47.00 ppm, J=16.0 Hz.  \n\u2022 A dq at \u03b45.50 ppm, J=16.0 Hz & J\u22486\u20138 Hz.  \n\u2022 A singlet at \u03b42.10 ppm (3H).  \n\u2022 A doublet at \u03b41.60 ppm, J\u22486\u20138 Hz (3H).  \n\nIf cis-propenyl acetate: vinylic J\u224810 Hz, not 16 Hz.  \nIf butenyl acetate: an \u2013OCH\u2082\u2013 signal would appear and more than two alkene H\u2019s.  \n\nOnly trans-propenyl acetate matches all four signals without extra CH\u2082 patterns and with a large trans J.; answer - \u03b4 7.00 ppm (1H, d, J=16.0 Hz): vinylic proton adjacent to the OAc in trans-propenyl acetate; \u03b4 5.50 ppm (1H, dq, J_trans=16.0 Hz, J_vic\u22487 Hz): vinylic proton adjacent to the CH\u2083; \u03b4 2.10 ppm (3H, s): acetate methyl; \u03b4 1.60 ppm (3H, d, J\u22487 Hz): allylic methyl. This exact set of shifts, multiplicities, integrations, and coupling constants is only consistent with trans-propenyl acetate.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - The decisive evidence is the large vicinal coupling constant of 16.0 Hz between the two vinylic protons. Trans\u2010alkenes typically show J\u224815\u201318 Hz, whereas cis\u2010alkenes are only \u22488\u201312 Hz. The proton at \u03b47.00 ppm is a doublet (J=16.0 Hz) and the proton at \u03b45.50 ppm is a doublet of quartets (J_trans=16.0 Hz to the other vinylic proton and J\u22487 Hz to an adjacent methyl). This pattern matches CH=CH\u2013CH\u2083 (propenyl) rather than a butenyl chain, which would require extra CH\u2082 signals around 4\u20134.5 ppm. The singlet at \u03b42.10 ppm is the acetate methyl, and the doublet at \u03b41.60 ppm (J\u22487 Hz) is the allylic methyl. No OCH\u2082 signals are observed, ruling out butenyl acetate. Thus the compound is trans-propenyl acetate.; answer - Trans-propenyl acetate\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - The NMR data show two vinylic protons with a large vicinal coupling constant of 16.0 Hz, which is diagnostic of a trans\u2010alkene (cis alkenes give ~8\u201312 Hz). The \u03b47.00 ppm doublet (J = 16.0 Hz) and the \u03b45.50 ppm doublet of quartets (J = 16.0 Hz to the other vinyl proton and \u22487 Hz to an adjacent methyl) match a CH=CH\u2013CH\u2083 fragment (propenyl). The singlet at \u03b42.10 ppm corresponds to the acetate methyl, and the doublet at \u03b41.60 ppm (J \u2248 7 Hz) is the allylic methyl. No methylene signals near 4\u20134.5 ppm are observed, ruling out any butenyl acetate. Thus the only candidate consistent with a trans\u2010alkene, a propenyl side chain, and the observed multiplicities is trans\u2010propenyl acetate.; answer - A)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 6 output: thinking - The NMR data show a doublet at \u03b47.00 ppm with J = 16.0 Hz and a doublet of quartets at \u03b45.50 ppm coupling 16.0 Hz to the other vinyl proton and ~7 Hz to an adjacent methyl. A 16 Hz vicinal coupling is characteristic of a trans\u2010alkene. The absence of signals around 4\u20134.5 ppm rules out a butenyl fragment. The singlet at \u03b42.10 ppm is the acetate methyl, and the doublet at \u03b41.60 ppm (J \u2248 7 Hz) is the allylic methyl.
