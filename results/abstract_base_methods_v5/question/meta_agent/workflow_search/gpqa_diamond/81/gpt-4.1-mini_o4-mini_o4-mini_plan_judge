proposed answer: The Diels–Alder between cyclopentadiene and the ester‐substituted alkene in product 2 proceeds under endo control, placing both CO2Me groups syn to the newly formed bicyclo[2.2.1] bridge. This stereochemical outcome corresponds to the full set of absolute configurations (1R,4S,4aS,4bR,5R,8S,8aS,8bR,10R,11R). Among the four given choices, only choice 1 lists exactly these ten R/S descriptors and its SMILES uses [C@@H]/[C@H] annotations at each center consistent with the endo orientation of both esters relative to the bridge. The other options each invert one or more chiral centers (e.g., 5S in choice 2 or different 4a/4b configurations in 3 and 4), so they cannot match the predicted major isomer.

proposed answer: In the final Diels–Alder step between cyclopentadiene and the bicyclo[4.2.1]octadiene diester, the reaction proceeds under endo control. This orients the newly formed norbornene bridge syn to the existing oxygen bridge and cis to both ester substituents. That stereochemical outcome dictates the absolute configurations at all ten stereocenters as (1R,4S,4aS,4bR,5R,8S,8aS,8bR,10R,11R). Among the four provided choices, only choice A bears these exact stereochemical descriptors and its SMILES notation aligns with all ten centers in the required R/S sequence and relative cis relationships. None of the other options match every center or violate the endo selectivity. Therefore, choice A) is the uniquely correct major isomer.
