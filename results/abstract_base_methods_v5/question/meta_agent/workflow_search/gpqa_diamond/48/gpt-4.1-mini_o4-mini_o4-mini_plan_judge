proposed answer: We predicted from mechanistic analysis that:

1. Reaction A (1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol, H+/heat) undergoes an acid-catalyzed iminium/Prins cyclization to give a 6-membered oxacycle, namely 6-methyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-amine. Only choices 3 and 4 list this product for A; choices 1 and 2 propose an enol ether amine which is inconsistent with the cyclization mechanism.

2. Reaction B ((3R,4S)-3,4-dimethylhexa-1,5-diyne, heat) proceeds via a thermal [2+2] cycloaddition of the terminal alkynes to form a cyclobutane bearing two exocyclic ethenyl groups with (1Z,2E) stereochemistry. Again, only choices 3 and 4 match this (1Z,2E)-1,2-diethylidenecyclobutane; choices 1 and 2 give the wrong ring size or stereochemistry.

3. Reaction C (2-((vinyloxy)methyl)but-1-ene, heat) follows a [3,3]-Claisen rearrangement to yield the aldehyde 4-methylenehexanal. This aldehyde appears only in choices 1 and 3, while choices 2 and 4 report the corresponding alcohol.

Thus, choice 3 is the only option that matches all three predicted products (A = 6-methyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-amine; B = (1Z,2E)-1,2-diethylidenecyclobutane; C = 4-methylenehexanal) with correct structures, stereochemistry, and functional groups.

proposed answer: Analyzing each transformation: 

Reaction A (acid-catalyzed aza-Claisen/Prins) must form a six-membered dihydropyran ring bearing an amine at C-2; only “6-methyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-amine” matches that, which appears in choices 3 and 4.

Reaction B (thermal enyne Cope leading to [2+2] cycloaddition) gives a cyclobutane bearing one Z and one E alkene: (1Z,2E)-1,2-diethylidenecyclobutane; again only in choices 3 and 4.

Reaction C (thermal Claisen rearrangement of the vinyloxy alkene followed by tautomerization) yields a γ,δ-unsaturated aldehyde, 4-methylenehexanal; this appears only in choice 3.

Thus choice C is the only option satisfying ring size, stereochemistry, and correct aldehyde product.
