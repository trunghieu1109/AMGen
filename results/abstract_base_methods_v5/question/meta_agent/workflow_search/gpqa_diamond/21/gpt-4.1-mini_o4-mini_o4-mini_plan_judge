Question: Example(question='A student regrets that he fell asleep during a lecture in electrochemistry, facing the following incomplete statement in a test:\nThermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, oxygen reacts …… in acidic solutions.\nWhich combination of weaker/stronger and faster/slower is correct?', choice1='weaker – faster', choice2='stronger – slower', choice3='weaker - slower', choice4='stronger – faster', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_21
proposed answer: In acidic solution the standard reduction potential for O₂/H₂O is +1.229 V, whereas in basic solution the O₂/H₂O (pH 14) potential drops to +0.401 V. A lower potential means O₂ is a weaker thermodynamic oxidant in basic media. Kinetically, the four‐electron reduction of O₂ in acid involves high overpotentials and multiple proton‐coupled electron‐transfer steps, making the reaction slow. Thus the correct pairing is “weaker – slower,” which corresponds to choice C.

Answer:C
Extracted answer: C
Correct answer: 3
