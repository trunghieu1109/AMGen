        "response": "The dye emits light at 2.3393 eV, which corresponds to a wavelength of \u03bb=1240 eV\u00b7nm/2.3393 eV\u2248530 nm\u2014in the green region of the spectrum. Organic dyes absorb the complementary color to their emission; the complement of green is red (around 650 nm). Among the given options (A) Blue, (B) Yellow, (C) Red, (D) Violet, the correct absorbed color is \u201cRed,\u201d corresponding to choice C).\n\nAnswer:C)",
        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - To convert photon energy in eV to wavelength in nm, use the relation E(eV)=hc/\u03bb, where hc\u22481240 eV\u00b7nm. Rearranging gives \u03bb=1240/E. Substituting E=2.3393 eV yields \u03bb\u22481240/2.3393\u2248530 nm.; answer - Approximately 530 nm\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - The emission wavelength calculated from the energy 2.3393 eV is about 530 nm. In the visible spectrum, wavelengths from roughly 495 to 570 nm correspond to green light. Therefore, an emission at ~530 nm falls squarely within the green region of visible light.; answer - Green\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - Since the dye emits green light at ~530 nm, its strongest absorption will lie near the complementary hue on the visible spectrum color wheel, which is red. The exact complementary wavelength to 530 nm is around 650 nm. In reality, organic dyes show broad absorption bands influenced by solvent, vibronic structure, and environmental effects, so they absorb across a range of red wavelengths rather than at a single sharp line. However, as an approximation, one can identify ~650 nm (red) as the principal absorbed wavelength.; answer - ~650 nm (red light)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - The dye emits light at 2.3393 eV, which corresponds to a wavelength of \u03bb=1240 eV\u00b7nm/2.3393 eV\u2248530 nm\u2014in the green region of the spectrum.
