Question: Example(question='A textile dye containing an extensively conjugated pi-electrons emits light with energy of 2.3393 eV. What color of light is absorbed by the organic compound?', choice1='Blue', choice2='Yellow', choice3='Red', choice4='Violet', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_47_29
proposed answer: The dye emits light at 2.3393 eV, which corresponds to a wavelength of λ=1240 eV·nm/2.3393 eV≈530 nm—in the green region of the spectrum. Organic dyes absorb the complementary color to their emission; the complement of green is red (around 650 nm). Among the given options (A) Blue, (B) Yellow, (C) Red, (D) Violet, the correct absorbed color is “Red,” corresponding to choice C).

Answer:C)
Extracted answer: C)
Correct answer: 3
