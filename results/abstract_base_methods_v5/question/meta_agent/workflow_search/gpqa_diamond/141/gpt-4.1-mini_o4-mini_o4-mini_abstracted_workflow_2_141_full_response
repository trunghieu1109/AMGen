The Pauli matrices {σx, σy, σz} together with the identity I form a basis for all 2×2 Hermitian matrices. Therefore ρ can be expanded as a linear combination ρ = a I + b σx + c σy + d σz. Imposing Tr(ρ)=1 fixes a=1/2, and requiring Hermiticity and positivity means the vector of coefficients r=(2b,2c,2d) must lie inside the unit ball. Moreover, the coefficients b,c,d are given by b=Tr(ρ σx)/2, c=Tr(ρ σy)/2, d=Tr(ρ σz)/2, so that r_i=Tr(ρ σ_i). This yields the standard form ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, with r the Bloch vector.; answer: The Bloch‐sphere representation of a single‐qubit density matrix ρ is\r\n\r\n   ρ = (I + r·σ)/2,\r\n\r\nwhere I is the 2×2 identity, σ = (σx, σy, σz) are the Pauli matrices, and r = (rx, ry, rz) is the Bloch vector with components ri = Tr(ρ\u2009σi). The state is physical if and only if |r| ≤ 1.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent 3MDN, recall Bloch sphere representation, thinking: A general single-qubit density matrix can always be written in terms of the identity and the Pauli matrices. We introduce a real three‐dimensional vector r=(r_x,r_y,r_z) (the Bloch vector) and the Pauli operators σ=(σ_x,σ_y,σ_z). By matching the matrix elements one finds the decomposition\r\n\r\nρ = ½(I + r_xσ_x + r_yσ_y + r_zσ_z).\r\n\r\nThis works because the Pauli matrices together with the identity form a complete basis for 2×2 Hermitian matrices, and the coefficients in that basis are real and constrained so that ρ remains positive semidefinite with unit trace.; answer: ρ = ½(I + r·σ) = ½[I + r_xσ_x + r_yσ_y + r_zσ_z]\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT agent mCf1, calculate Bloch vector r, thinking: We have ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|) = (1/2)I. In the Bloch representation ρ = (1/2)(I + r·σ), the vector r has components r_i = Tr(ρ σ_i). Since ρ is proportional to the identity, Tr(ρ σ_x) = Tr(ρ σ_y) = Tr(ρ σ_z) = 0.
