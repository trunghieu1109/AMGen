        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The density matrix is given directly as \u03c1 = \u00bd(|0><0| + |1><1|). In the computational basis {|0>,|1>}, |0><0| corresponds to the matrix [[1,0],[0,0]] and |1><1| to [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them and multiplying by \u00bd yields [[\u00bd,0],[0,\u00bd]], which is diagonal with equal probabilities on |0> and |1>. This indicates a statistical mixture (not a pure state), specifically the maximally mixed state in the qubit Bloch sphere center.; answer - \u03c1 = \u00bd(|0><0| + |1><1|) = [[\u00bd, 0], [0, \u00bd]], a maximally mixed state in the computational basis.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - The Bloch sphere representation expresses any single-qubit density matrix as a convex combination of the identity and the Pauli matrices.  One writes \u03c1 in terms of the Bloch vector r=(r_x,r_y,r_z) and the Pauli vector \u03c3=(\u03c3_x,\u03c3_y,\u03c3_z).  To find the formula, note that the Pauli matrices form a basis for traceless Hermitian operators and that \u03c1 must have unit trace.  Matching trace and expansion coefficients gives the relation \u03c1=(1/2)(I + r\u00b7\u03c3).  The components of r are then found by taking the trace of \u03c1 with each Pauli matrix: r_i=Tr(\u03c1 \u03c3_i).; answer - The Bloch sphere representation is \u03c1 = (1/2)(I + r\u00b7\u03c3), with r_i = Tr(\u03c1 \u03c3_i) for i = x,y,z.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - We have \u03c1 = (1/2)(|0\u27e9\u27e80| + |1\u27e9\u27e81|) = (1/2)I. In the Bloch representation \u03c1 = (1/2)(I + r\u00b7\u03c3), the vector r has components r_i = Tr(\u03c1 \u03c3_i). Since \u03c1 is proportional to the identity, Tr(\u03c1 \u03c3_x) = Tr(\u03c1 \u03c3_y) = Tr(\u03c1 \u03c3_z) = 0. Thus all three components vanish, giving r = (0,0,0).; answer - r = (0,0,0)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - The given density matrix \u03c1 = \u00bd(|0\u27e9\u27e80| + |1\u27e9\u27e81|) equals \u00bdI. In the Bloch representation \u03c1 = \u00bd(I + r\u00b7\u03c3), the components r_i = Tr(\u03c1 \u03c3_i) all vanish because Tr(I \u03c3_i)=0. Hence r = (0,0,0), placing the state at the center of the Bloch sphere. Among the choices, only option A) lists r=(0,0,0). A potential limitation is that this relies on familiarity with Pauli matrices and the Bloch sphere formalism, but no other ambiguities are present.; answer - A)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - The density matrix \u03c1 = \u00bd(|0\u27e9\u27e80| + |1\u27e9\u27e81|) equals the maximally mixed state \u00bdI. In the Bloch sphere representation \u03c1 = \u00bd(I + r\u00b7\u03c3), each Bloch component r_i = Tr(\u03c1 \u03c3_i) = \u00bdTr(I \u03c3_i) = 0 since Tr(I \u03c3_i) = 0. Therefore the Bloch vector is r = (0,0,0), corresponding to the center of the Bloch sphere. Among the given options, only A) matches this result.; answer - A)"
