Setting this equal to 2 and taking the natural log gives ln(2)=(ΔE/k)(1/T_2–1/T_1). Combining the terms 1/T_2–1/T_1=(T_1–T_2)/(T_1\u2009T_2) yields ln(2)=(ΔE/k)(T_1–T_2)/(T_1\u2009T_2), which exactly matches option D.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent quOJ:\nUnder LTE, the ratio of excited populations is given by the Boltzmann factors: N*_1/N*_2 = exp[–ΔE/(kT_1)]/exp[–ΔE/(kT_2)] = exp[(ΔE/k)(1/T_2 – 1/T_1)]. Setting this equal to 2 gives ln(2) = (ΔE/k)(1/T_2 – 1/T_1). Combining 1/T_2 – 1/T_1 = (T_1 – T_2)/(T_1 T_2) yields ln(2) = (ΔE/k)·(T_1 – T_2)/(T_1 T_2).

Since the statistical weights g_j/g_i cancel when comparing the same transition in two stars, the ratio of excited‐state populations in star 1 to star 2 is simply the ratio of their Boltzmann factors. Taking the quotient of the two exponentials gives exp[–ΔE/(kT1) + ΔE/(kT2)], which can be rearranged to exp[(ΔE/k)(1/T2 – 1/T1)].

However, this result rests on several idealizations: it assumes strict LTE (so level populations follow the Boltzmann distribution exactly), identical partition functions and chemical compositions in both stars, negligible non‐LTE effects (e.g. radiative overpopulation or underpopulation of levels), and ignores processes like stimulated emission, collisional de‐excitation differences, and continuous opacity variations.
