Question: Example(question='Two stars are being studied. It has been observed that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2. In fact, the energy difference between the considered energy levels was determined to be approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J. Assuming that the stellar photospheres are in LTE, which of these equations for the effective temperatures of the stars (T_1 and T_2) is correct?', choice1='ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]\n', choice2='ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]\n', choice3='ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n', choice4='ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: Under LTE, the excited‐state population ratio follows the Boltzmann relation: N*_1/N*_2 = exp[–ΔE/(kT_1)]/exp[–ΔE/(kT_2)] = exp[(ΔE/k)(1/T_2 – 1/T_1)]. Setting this equal to 2 gives ln(2) = (ΔE/k)(1/T_2 – 1/T_1). The difference of reciprocals simplifies to (T_1 – T_2)/(T_1 T_2), yielding ln(2) = (ΔE/k)·(T_1 – T_2)/(T_1 T_2). Among the choices, only option D has the form ln(2) = (T_1 – T_2)/(T_1 T_2) (implicitly multiplied by ΔE/k). Hence, choice D is correct.
