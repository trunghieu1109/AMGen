Using ω=√(K/m) gives ω_x=√(4k/m)=2√(k/m), ω_y=√(k/m). This is mathematically consistent under the small-oscillation approximation around the origin and assuming x and y decouple completely. However, the original V(r,θ) contains angular dependence (the cos²θ term) that can introduce cross-terms if one does not align the axes with the principal directions. By expanding in Cartesian coordinates directly, we implicitly assumed the principal axes coincide with x and y and ignored higher-order anharmonic corrections. Thus the result holds only for small displacements around r=0, where the potential is well approximated by a separable quadratic form. Beyond that regime, mode coupling and anharmonicity will modify the frequencies.; answer: ω_x=2√(k/m), ω_y=√(k/m); valid only under small-oscillation (harmonic) and separability assumptions, neglecting angular coupling and anharmonic effects.\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent UPIX, refining frequencies, thinking: From Sub-task 2 we found the potential expanded about the origin as V(x,y)=½K_x x²+½K_y y² with K_x=4k and K_y=k.
