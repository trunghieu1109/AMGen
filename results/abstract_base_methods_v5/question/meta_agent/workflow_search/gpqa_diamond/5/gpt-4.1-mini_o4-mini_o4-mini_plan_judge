Question: Example(question='A quantum mechanical particle of mass m moves in two dimensions in the following potential, as a function of (r,θ): V (r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ)\nFind the energy spectrum.', choice1='E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)', choice2='E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))', choice3='E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))', choice4='E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: From the derived expression in Sub-task 4, we have E_{n_x,n_y} = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ħ√(k/m). Comparing this term by term with the provided options: only choice A has coefficients 2 for n_x, 1 for n_y, and the zero-point energy 3/2 multiplying ħ√(k/m). All other choices differ in these coefficients or the constant term. Therefore, the correct spectrum formula is choice A.
