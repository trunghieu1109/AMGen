In contrast, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione (the keto form of phloroglucinol) readily tautomerizes to its aromatic enol form.

In contrast, dimethyl fumarate has a trans-alkene with identical substituents on each carbon (H and CO₂Me) and overall molecular symmetry, so it lacks a chiral center or element of chirality and cannot exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent Q8y5:\nmethyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\n### Sub-task 3: Integrate the results from Sub-task 1 and Sub-task 2 to identify the correct choice among the given options (choice1 to choice4) that matches the compound not showing tautomerism (A) and the compound showing optical isomerism (B). \n\n ### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent METp (yourself):\nFrom Sub-task 1, benzoquinone does not undergo tautomerism because enolization would break its aromaticity, whereas cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione readily tautomerizes to an aromatic enol form. From Sub-task 2, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (methyl lactate) has a stereogenic center at the α-carbon and thus shows optical isomerism, while dimethyl fumarate is achiral due to molecular symmetry.

It ignores how solvent, temperature or pH can promote minor tautomeric forms even for benzoquinone under forcing conditions; it overlooks possible enantiomeric impurities or racemization pathways for methyl lactate; it treats tautomerism as an all-or-nothing phenomenon without considering equilibrium mixtures or kinetic barriers; and it does not address other stereochemical complexities (e.g. conformational isomers or epimerization) that could influence optical activity or tautomer ratios.\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 3: Integrate the results from Sub-task 1 and Sub-task 2 to identify the correct choice among the given options (choice1 to choice4) that matches the compound not showing tautomerism (A) and the compound showing optical isomerism (B).\n\n Return your answer in the "answer" entry and justify detailedly why you think so in the "thinking" entry.

Hence, benzoquinone does not exhibit tautomerism.; answer: benzoquinone\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent nqck, analyzing optical isomerism, thinking: Optical isomerism arises when a molecule has at least one stereogenic (chiral) center—usually a carbon atom bonded to four different substituents—leading to non-superimposable mirror images. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (methyl lactate) has the structure HO–CH(CH3)–COOCH3. The central carbon (the one bearing the –OH, –H, –CH3, and –COOCH3 substituents) is bonded to four distinct groups, making it a stereogenic center. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate can exist as two enantiomers and exhibits optical activity. Dimethyl fumarate, on the other hand, is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid with a trans-configured C=C double bond and two identical ester substituents; it lacks any carbon bonded to four different groups and thus has no chiral center. Consequently, dimethyl fumarate cannot show optical isomerism.; answer: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent aOiW, analyzing optical isomerism, thinking: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (the methyl ester of lactic acid) has the formula CH3–CHOH–COOCH3. The central carbon (–CHOH–) is bonded to four different substituents: a methyl group (CH3), a hydroxyl group (OH), a hydrogen (H), and an ester group (COOCH3). This makes it a stereogenic (chiral) center, so it can exist as enantiomers and therefore shows optical isomerism. In contrast, dimethyl fumarate is a trans-alkene diester (E-configuration) with no chiral centers or other elements of asymmetry; it is planar and lacks stereogenic carbons, so it does not exhibit optical isomerism.; answer: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent Q8y5, analyzing optical isomerism, thinking: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (methyl lactate) has a stereogenic center at the α-carbon, which is bonded to –OH, –H, –CH₃, and –COOCH₃, making it chiral and capable of optical isomerism.
