Question: Example(question='Compounds that have the same molecular formula but are different in their structural arrangement are known as isomers. Isomers have two types, constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but differ in their structures. In stereoisomers, molecules are connected in the same way, but their arrangements in space are different.\nAmong the given compounds (benzoquinone & cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione) the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) and among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate which one will show optical isomerism (B).', choice1='A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate', choice2='A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate', choice3='A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate', choice4='A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_48_20
proposed answer: From Sub-task 1, benzoquinone does not undergo tautomerism because any enolization would disrupt its aromatic stability, whereas cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione readily tautomerizes to aromatic enol forms. From Sub-task 2, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral α-carbon (–OH, –H, –CH₃, –COOCH₃) and thus shows optical isomerism, while dimethyl fumarate is a symmetric trans-alkene lacking chirality. Matching A = benzoquinone and B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate corresponds exactly to choice 3 in the provided options.
