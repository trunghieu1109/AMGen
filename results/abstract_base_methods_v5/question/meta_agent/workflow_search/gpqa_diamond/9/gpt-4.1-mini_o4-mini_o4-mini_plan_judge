Question: Example(question='Among the following exoplanets, which one has the highest density?\n\na) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet.\nb) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm^3.\nc) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth.\nd) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth.', choice1='a', choice2='c', choice3='b', choice4='d', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_8_9
proposed answer: We compare densities for each option using Earth-like composition. Option (a) is 1 M⊕ and 1 R⊕, so ρ≈5.5 g/cm³. Option (b) is 2 M⊕ with given ρ≈5.5 g/cm³. For option (c), at 5 M⊕ self-compression increases density: ρ∝M^0.19, so ρ≈5.5×5^0.19≈7.4 g/cm³. Option (d) at 0.5 M⊕ yields ρ≈5.5×0.5^0.19≈4.8 g/cm³. Thus the 5 M⊕ Earth-composition planet (option c) has the highest density due to self-compression.

proposed answer: The original question is multiple-choice, so per instructions the answer must be only the letter. Option C is confirmed as the densest planet due to self-compression in a 5 M⊕ Earth-like composition.
