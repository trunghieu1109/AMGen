Question: Example(question='The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1), and the operators of two observables P and Q of the system are represented by two square matrices. The matrix corresponding to operator P has the elements in first row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0), elements in the second row as (1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}) and that in third row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0). The matrix operator for Q is represented by the square matrix having elements in the first row as (1, 0, 0), second row as (0, 0, 0) and third row as (0, 0, -1). Now, if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P, what is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements?', choice1='1/2', choice2='1/6', choice3='1/3', choice4='2/3', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_36_175
proposed answer: From subtask 9 we obtained the joint probability of measuring P=0 followed by Q=-1 as (1/3)Ã—(1/2)=1/6. Comparing this value with the provided options: A) 1/2, B) 1/6, C) 1/3, D) 2/3, the exact match is 1/6, which corresponds to choice B.

Answer:B
Extracted answer: B
Correct answer: 2
