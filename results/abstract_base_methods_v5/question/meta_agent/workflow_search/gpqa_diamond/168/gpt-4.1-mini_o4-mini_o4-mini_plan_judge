proposed answer: In the original four‐body decay (2A→2B+2E+2V), the two light neutrinos V and the two electrons E share the available energy continuously, giving a continuous electron spectrum up to endpoint Q. Replacing the two neutrinos with a single massless particle M makes it a three‐body final state, but M’s energy can still vary from zero to Q, so energy–momentum conservation still allows a continuous distribution of energy between the two electrons and M. The maximum electron energy still occurs when M carries zero energy, so the endpoint remains Q. Thus the spectrum remains continuous with a modified shape but with an unchanged endpoint, which is not among options A–D.

proposed answer: The original decay 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V with two massive neutrinos is effectively a three-body decay for the electrons (E), giving a continuous electron energy spectrum up to endpoint Q. Replacing the two neutrinos (each carrying rest-mass energy) with a single massless particle M leaves it a three-body decay. With no neutrino rest-mass to absorb energy, the electrons can receive additional kinetic energy, so the spectrum remains continuous and the endpoint increases by approximately the removed neutrino rest-mass energy. Comparing to the options:
A) discrete, endpoint increases – wrong continuity
B) continuous, endpoint decreases – wrong endpoint shift
C) continuous, endpoint increases – matches both features
D) discrete, endpoint decreases – wrong on both counts
Only option C) exactly matches “continuous spectrum” and “endpoint increases.”
