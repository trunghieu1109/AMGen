Energy and momentum conservation in a three\u2010body final state\u2014two E\u2019s plus two V\u2019s\u2014means the electrons do not take a fixed fraction of the decay energy; instead the available Q\u2010value is shared continuously among all four particles. Because the neutrinos can carry off varying amounts of energy, the sum energy of the two electrons varies continuously from zero up to the maximum available energy Q (the endpoint) when the neutrinos carry negligible energy. Thus the spectrum is continuous and terminates at the endpoint Q, which represents the total kinetic energy released when the leptons take all the available decay energy.; answer - In 2A\u21922B+2E+2V, E are electrons and V are neutrinos. The decay releases a fixed total energy Q, but in a four-body final state (two electrons plus two neutrinos) that energy can be distributed in infinitely many ways, so the sum energy of the two electrons forms a continuous spectrum. The endpoint Q is the maximal sum electron energy, attained when the neutrinos carry off essentially zero energy.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - We are asked to characterize the exotic massless particle M and see how replacing the two neutrinos V with one M alters the kinematics and the energy spectrum of the two E particles. In the original decay 2A\u21922B+2E+2V we have a four-body final state, so the sum energy of the two E\u2019s is distributed continuously between 0 and Q because the two (nearly) massless V\u2019s share the remaining energy arbitrarily. In the variant decay 2A\u21922B+2E+M, M is introduced as a single, truly massless neutral particle that carries away lepton\u2010number change equivalent to the two neutrinos. Kinematically this is now a three\u2010body final state (E, E, M) instead of four. A three\u2010body phase space still produces a continuous distribution for the sum of the two E energies, but the available phase\u2010space volume is reduced compared to the four\u2010body case, so the shape of the spectrum is modified (there are different weighting factors in the Dalitz plot). However, since M is massless, its minimum energy is zero, so the maximum total electron energy still corresponds to M carrying zero energy\u2014hence the endpoint remains Q.; answer - The exotic particle M is a single, truly massless neutral particle that replaces the two neutrinos. The decay becomes a three-body final state (two E\u2019s plus M) instead of four. This reduces the dimensionality of the phase space, altering the shape of the continuous sum-energy spectrum of the E\u2019s, but because M is massless (can have zero energy), the spectral endpoint remains at the same value Q.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - Replacing two neutrinos (V) with a single massless particle (M) reduces the final\u2010state from four bodies to three, but since M is massless and the decay matrix element is assumed energy\u2013independent, energy\u2013momentum conservation still allows a continuous sharing of the total decay energy among the two E\u2019s and M. With M able to carry arbitrarily small energy, the maximum sum energy of the two E\u2019s still occurs when M takes zero, so the endpoint remains the same Q. The only change is a different phase\u2010space weighting, which modifies the spectral shape but does not produce discrete lines.; answer - The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint remains at Q.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - In the original four\u2010body decay (2A\u21922B+2E+2V), the two light neutrinos V and the two electrons E share the available energy continuously, giving a continuous electron spectrum up to endpoint Q.

        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - We need to explain the roles of each particle in the decay 2A \u2192 2B + 2E + 2V, emphasize that the neutrinos V are very light yet have nonzero mass, and show why the electron (E) energy spectrum is continuous up to an endpoint Q. A detailed justification will step through conservation of energy and momentum in a three-body final state, the small but nonzero neutrino mass, and how varying energy shares between E and V produce a continuous spectrum. The endpoint Q occurs when the neutrinos carry away minimal kinetic energy, so the electrons take all available energy.; answer - In the decay 2A \u2192 2B + 2E + 2V, each A\u2009\u2192\u2009B transition releases a fixed total energy Q that must be shared among the emitted particles. The heavy daughter nuclei B carry negligible kinetic energy compared to the light leptons. Each E is a charged lepton (electron or positron) of rest mass m_E, and each V is a neutrino of extremely small but nonzero mass m_V. Because there are three light particles in each single decay (two E\u2019s and two V\u2019s shared between the two simultaneous transformations), energy and momentum conservation allow a continuous range of energy partitions among the leptons. As the neutrinos\u2019 masses are tiny but nonzero, they can carry away varying kinetic energies from nearly zero up to almost Q, leaving the electrons with any energy between some minimum and a maximum endpoint Q. The continuous spectrum arises from this three-body (or effectively four-body combined) kinematics, and Q marks the maximum total energy the electrons can possess when the neutrinos take the least possible energy.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - In the variant decay 2A \u2192 2B + 2E + M, the exotic particle M is strictly massless (m_M = 0). That means its minimum possible energy is zero, unlike the two neutrinos V in the original process which each carry at least their nonzero rest energy m_Vc^2. The decay now has three light bodies (the two E\u2019s plus the single M) instead of four, but it remains a three-body kinematic problem for each A\u2192B+E+M transition. Three-body decays always yield continuous energy spectra because energy and momentum conservation allow the final particles to share the available Q in a continuum of ways. With M exactly massless, the lowest energy M can carry away is zero, so the electrons can now carry off the full decay energy Q plus the tiny amount that neutrinos before needed to supply to their rest mass. In other words, the endpoint of the total E-energy spectrum shifts to a slightly higher value (by 2\u2009m_Vc^2) relative to the original case. The overall shape of the distribution also changes subtly due to different phase-space factors, but it remains continuous.; answer - The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - Replacing the two light but massive neutrinos V with a single strictly massless particle M reduces the number of emitted light particles but keeps the decay a three-body kinematic situation (2A \u2192 2B + 2E + M). Three-body decays inherently permit a continuous sharing of energy among the final particles because energy and momentum can be partitioned in infinitely many ways. With M exactly massless, it can carry arbitrarily small energy, so the electrons E can receive up to the full available Q plus the energy previously tied up in the neutrino rest masses. Therefore, the electron energy spectrum remains continuous, though its detailed shape shifts due to the altered phase\u2010space factors, and its high\u2010energy endpoint increases (by approximately the sum of the removed neutrino rest energies).; answer - The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4a output: thinking - In all structured debates we found that replacing two light, but massive, neutrinos with a single exactly massless particle M does not change the three\u2010body nature of the decay. Three\u2010body kinematics always yield a continuous energy distribution for one of the outgoing particles (here, the E particles) because energy and momentum conservation allow a continuum of possible energy partitions. Moreover, in the original decay a portion of the total decay energy Q is \u2018\u2018locked up\u2019\u2019 as neutrino rest\u2010mass energy (2 m_Vc^2). By substituting a massless M, we remove that rest\u2010mass sink, effectively making an extra \u22482 m_Vc^2 available as kinetic energy for the electrons. Consequently, the maximum electron energy is raised by the sum of the removed neutrino masses. Therefore the correct physical conclusion is that the spectrum remains continuous and the endpoint increases.; answer - The spectrum remains continuous and the endpoint increases.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4b output: thinking - The original decay 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V with two massive neutrinos is effectively a three-body decay for the electrons (E), giving a continuous electron energy spectrum up to endpoint Q.
