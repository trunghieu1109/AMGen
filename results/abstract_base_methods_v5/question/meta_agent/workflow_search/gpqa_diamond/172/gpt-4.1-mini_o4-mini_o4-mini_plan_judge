Question: Example(question="If uncertainty in space of electron's location, which is travelling with speed v= 2* 10^8 m/s along x-direction is Δx=0.1 nm . Based on the infromation estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of electron.", choice1='~10^(-19) J', choice2='~10^(-18) J', choice3='~10^(-16) J', choice4='~10^(-17) J', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_4_172
proposed answer: From Sub-task 5 we found ΔE ≃1×10^(-16) J. Comparing with the given options: A) ~10^(-19) J and B) ~10^(-18) J are orders of magnitude too small, D) ~10^(-17) J is still an order smaller, while C) ~10^(-16) J matches our result. Therefore the closest choice is C).
