Non-relativistically, E = p²/(2m) so dE/dp = p/m = v. From earlier sub-tasks, the momentum uncertainty Δp ≃ 5.27×10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s and the electron’s speed v = 2.0×10⁸ m/s. Thus ΔE ≃ v·Δp ≃ (2.0×10⁸ m/s)(5.27×10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s) ≃ 1.05×10⁻¹⁶ J. Relativistic corrections change p slightly but leave dE/dp ≃ v, so the result remains on the order of 10⁻¹⁶ J.

From Sub‐task 1 we have Δx = 1×10⁻¹⁰ m. Plugging in the reduced Planck’s constant ħ ≃ 1.055×10⁻³⁴ J·s gives Δp ≥ ħ/(2Δx) = (1.055×10⁻³⁴)/(2×1×10⁻¹⁰) ≃ 5.27×10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s. This shows how a very small position uncertainty leads to a finite lower bound on momentum uncertainty.; answer: Δx·Δp ≥ ħ/2; therefore Δp ≥ ħ/(2Δx) = (1.055×10⁻³⁴ J·s)/(2×1×10⁻¹⁰ m) ≃ 5.27×10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent mjNt, recall uncertainty principle, thinking: The Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that the product of the uncertainties in position and momentum cannot be smaller than ħ/2.

However, this estimate has several limitations: 1) It uses the minimal bound (ħ/2), but real wavefunctions often yield larger uncertainties. 2) It assumes nonrelativistic momentum (p=mv), yet at v=2×10⁸\u2009m/s relativistic corrections (p=γmv) become significant. 3) It ignores the specific shape and dispersion of the electron’s wavepacket and any external potentials. 4) It doesn’t account for energy–momentum relations that link Δp to ΔE in a relativistic context.; answer: Δp ≈5.27×10⁻²⁵\u2009kg·m/s, valid as a minimal nonrelativistic estimate; true uncertainty may be larger and relativistic effects are neglected.\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent yVRR, refining minimum uncertainty in momentum, thinking: We apply the Heisenberg uncertainty principle in its form Δx·Δp ≥ ħ/2.
