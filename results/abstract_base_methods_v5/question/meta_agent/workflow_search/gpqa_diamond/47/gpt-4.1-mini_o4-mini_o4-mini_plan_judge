Question: Example(question='cyclohexanone was treated with bromine, forming product 1.\n1 was heated with sodium hydroxide, forming product 2.\n2 was treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine, forming 3.\n3 was treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride, forming product 4.\n\nhow many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are there on product 4?', choice1='8', choice2='6', choice3='7', choice4='10', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_16_47
proposed answer: Product 4 is cyclopentane-1-carboxaldehyde, and by symmetry its aldehyde H, the C1–H, the two α-CH2 sets (C2/C5), and the two β-CH2 sets (C3/C4) form 4 chemically distinct proton environments. Since none of the choices (8, 6, 7, 10) matches 4, there is no correct option provided. The closest listed total is 10, which corresponds to the total number of H but not the number of distinct types.
