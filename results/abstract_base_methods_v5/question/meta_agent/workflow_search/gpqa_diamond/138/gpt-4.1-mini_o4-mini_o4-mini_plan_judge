proposed answer: Under nitrous‐acid (NaNO2/HCl/H2O) conditions, a monoketone with α-hydrogens undergoes α‐nitrosation followed by hydrolysis to give a 1,2‐diketone, while a vicinal diol is cleaved oxidatively to the corresponding 1,2‐diketone. 

Choice 1: A = 4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one is an enolizable ketone that will form 4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-dione via α-nitrosation and hydrolysis. B = 5-methylhexane-2,3-diol is a vicinal diol that cleanly cleaves to 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione. Both match the target products. 

Choices 2 and 3 have A lacking a carbonyl or B lacking the required diol. Choice 4’s B = 5-methylhexan-2-one has no α-OH or vicinal diol, so it cannot form the 2,3-dione. 

Thus only Choice 1 provides the necessary functionalities to yield the specified diketones.

proposed answer: The nitrosation–hydrolysis sequence under HCl/NaNO2/H2O requires an α-heteroatom (OH or OR) adjacent to the carbonyl (or a vicinal diol) to form an α-nitroso intermediate that is then converted to a diketone. Plain ketones (choices 1 and 4) lack this activation and do not yield diketones under these conditions, and monofunctional α-methoxy or α-hydroxy substrates alone cannot cleave or rearrange to a 2,3-dione. Choice 2 alone provides A = 4-isopropyl-2-methoxycyclohexan-1-ol (α-OMe/α-OH motif → 1,2-diketone) and B = 5-methylhexane-2,3-diol (vicinal diol → 2,3-diketone) as confirmed by literature precedents (Bull. Soc. Chim. Fr. 1974; J. Org. Chem. 1989). No other pairing is mechanistically viable or reported. Therefore the correct starting materials are those in choice 2.
