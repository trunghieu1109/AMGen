Question: Example(question='A synchrocyclotron is a special type of cyclotron. A proton is injected at \\$t=0\\$ with negligible kinetic energy, i.e. \\$T\\simeq0\\$ undergoes two accelerations in the accelerator to reach the kinetic energy \\$T{1}=950MeV\\$. The alternating voltage applied in the accelerator is given by\nU\\left(t\\right)=U{0}\\cos\\left[2\\pi\\nu\\left(\\alpha\\right)t+\\Phi_{0}\\right].\n\nHow many revolutions does the proton make in the synchrocyclotron?\nData : \\$\\Phi{0}=\\frac{\\pi}{4},U{0}=190kV\\$. ', choice1='1864', choice2='2500', choice3='3536', choice4='5300', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_15_136
proposed answer: All independent calculations yielded approximately N â‰ƒ 3519 revolutions. Among the given options (1864, 2500, 3536, 5300), 3536 differs from 3519 by only 17, which is far smaller than its difference with any other choice. Thus the closest match is 3536, corresponding to choice C).
