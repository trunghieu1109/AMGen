        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - In classical electromagnetism, Maxwell\u2019s equations include two that directly involve the magnetic field B: Gauss\u2019s law for magnetism and the Amp\u00e8re\u2013Maxwell law. Gauss\u2019s law for magnetism (\u2207\u00b7B = 0) states there are no magnetic monopoles, so the net magnetic flux out of any closed surface is zero. The Amp\u00e8re\u2013Maxwell law (\u2207\u00d7B = \u03bc\u2080 J + \u03bc\u2080 \u03b5\u2080 \u2202E/\u2202t) describes how magnetic fields circulate around currents J and changing electric fields \u2202E/\u2202t. These are the standard divergence and curl equations for B in Maxwell\u2019s set.; answer - The relevant Maxwell\u2019s equations are: (1) \u2207\u00b7B = 0, and (2) \u2207\u00d7B = \u03bc\u2080 J + \u03bc\u2080 \u03b5\u2080 \u2202E/\u2202t.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - We need to explain the physical content of the two Maxwell equations involving B that were identified in Sub-task 1: Gauss\u2019s law for magnetism (\u2207\u00b7B=0) and the Amp\u00e8re\u2013Maxwell law (\u2207\u00d7B=\u03bc\u2080J+\u03bc\u2080\u03b5\u2080\u2202E/\u2202t). For each, we elaborate on what the mathematical form tells us physically. In particular we emphasize that \u2207\u00b7B=0 encodes the empirical fact that no magnetic monopoles have ever been observed, so magnetic field lines cannot begin or end but only form closed loops. For \u2207\u00d7B, we note that steady currents J produce circulating magnetic fields (Amp\u00e8re\u2019s law) and that Maxwell\u2019s addition of the displacement current term \u03bc\u2080\u03b5\u2080\u2202E/\u2202t makes the law consistent with charge conservation and allows electromagnetic waves. This detailed justification supports the structure of classical electromagnetism and highlights the special role of the monopole absence.; answer - Gauss\u2019s law for magnetism (\u2207\u00b7B = 0) means there are no magnetic monopoles in classical electromagnetism: magnetic field lines never start or end on isolated charges but always form closed loops. This reflects the empirical fact that we have never observed an isolated north or south pole. The Amp\u00e8re\u2013Maxwell law (\u2207\u00d7B = \u03bc\u2080J + \u03bc\u2080\u03b5\u2080\u2202E/\u2202t) states that magnetic fields circulate around electric currents J and around time-varying electric fields \u2202E/\u2202t. The first term (\u03bc\u2080J) is Amp\u00e8re\u2019s original law showing that moving charges generate magnetic fields, while Maxwell\u2019s addition of the displacement current term (\u03bc\u2080\u03b5\u2080\u2202E/\u2202t) ensures consistency with charge conservation and predicts that changing electric fields also act like currents, allowing self-sustaining electromagnetic waves.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - Starting from the classical Maxwell equations, only those directly involving the magnetic field\u2019s divergence and the curl of the electric field will pick up magnetic\u2010charge terms. In classical electromagnetism Gauss\u2019s law for magnetism \u2207\u00b7B=0 encodes \u201cno monopoles,\u201d and Faraday\u2019s law \u2207\u00d7E=\u2013\u2202B/\u2202t contains no explicit source term for magnetic currents. Introducing isolated magnetic charge density \u03c1_m and current J_m requires: 1) Gauss\u2019s law for magnetism becomes \u2207\u00b7B=\u03c1_m, allowing magnetic flux to begin/end on monopoles, and 2) Faraday\u2019s law acquires a magnetic current term \u2207\u00d7E=\u2013\u2202B/\u2202t\u2013J_m, by duality with the Amp\u00e8re\u2013Maxwell addition for electric displacement. The other two Maxwell equations remain unchanged (Gauss\u2019s law for E and the Amp\u00e8re\u2013Maxwell law). Magnetic charge conservation \u2202\u03c1_m/\u2202t+\u2207\u00b7J_m=0 then follows automatically from taking the divergence of the modified Faraday\u2019s law.; answer - The Maxwell equations that change are Gauss\u2019s law for magnetism, modified to \u2207\u00b7B=\u03c1_m, and Faraday\u2019s law, modified to \u2207\u00d7E=\u2013\u2202B/\u2202t\u2013J_m.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - In the presence of magnetic monopoles, Gauss\u2019s law for magnetism (\u2207\u00b7B=0) is modified to include a magnetic charge density term (\u2207\u00b7B=\u03c1\u2098), and Faraday\u2019s law (\u2207\u00d7E=\u2013\u2202B/\u2202t) acquires a magnetic current term (\u2207\u00d7E=\u2013\u2202B/\u2202t\u2013J\u2098).
