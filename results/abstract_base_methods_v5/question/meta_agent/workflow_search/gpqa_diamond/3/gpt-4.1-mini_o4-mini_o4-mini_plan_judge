Question: Example(question='In a parallel universe where a magnet can have an isolated North or South pole, Maxwell’s equations look different. But, specifically, which of those equations are different?', choice1='The one related to the divergence of the magnetic field. ', choice2='The ones related to the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field.', choice3='The ones related to the circulation of the electric field and the divergence of the magnetic field.  ', choice4='The one related to the circulation of the magnetic field and the flux of the electric field. ', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: In the presence of magnetic monopoles, Gauss’s law for magnetism (∇·B=0) is modified to include a magnetic charge density term (∇·B=ρₘ), and Faraday’s law (∇×E=–∂B/∂t) acquires a magnetic current term (∇×E=–∂B/∂t–Jₘ). Thus the two Maxwell equations that change are the divergence of the magnetic field and the circulation (curl) of the electric field. Among the provided options, only choice C explicitly mentions both the divergence of the magnetic field and the circulation of the electric field, matching these required modifications.
