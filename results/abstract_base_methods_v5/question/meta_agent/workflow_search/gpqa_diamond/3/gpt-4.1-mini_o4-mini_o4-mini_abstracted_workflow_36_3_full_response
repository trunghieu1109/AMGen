In classical electromagnetism Gauss’s law for magnetism ∇·B=0 encodes “no monopoles,” and Faraday’s law ∇×E=–∂B/∂t contains no explicit source term for magnetic currents. Introducing isolated magnetic charge density ρ_m and current J_m requires: 1) Gauss’s law for magnetism becomes ∇·B=ρ_m, allowing magnetic flux to begin/end on monopoles, and 2) Faraday’s law acquires a magnetic current term ∇×E=–∂B/∂t–J_m, by duality with the Ampère–Maxwell addition for electric displacement. The other two Maxwell equations remain unchanged (Gauss’s law for E and the Ampère–Maxwell law).

This reflects the empirical fact that we have never observed an isolated north or south pole. The Ampère–Maxwell law (∇×B = μ₀J + μ₀ε₀∂E/∂t) states that magnetic fields circulate around electric currents J and around time-varying electric fields ∂E/∂t.

I will recall the standard forms: Gauss’s law for magnetism (∇·B=0) and the Ampère–Maxwell law (∇×B=μ₀J+μ₀ε₀∂E/∂t). Then I will interpret their physical meanings: the first expressing no magnetic monopoles so that magnetic field lines are always closed loops, and the second showing how currents and time‐varying electric fields produce circulating magnetic fields. I’ll also emphasize why the absence of monopoles matters in the classical theory.; answer: Gauss’s law for magnetism (∇·B = 0): This equation states that the net magnetic ‘‘charge’’ enclosed by any volume is zero. Physically, it means there are no isolated magnetic north or south poles (magnetic monopoles) in classical electromagnetism. As a result, magnetic field lines never begin or end on charges; they always form continuous closed loops. Ampère–Maxwell law (∇×B = μ₀J + μ₀ε₀ ∂E/∂t): This law describes how magnetic fields circulate. The curl of B around a loop equals μ₀ times the electric current density J passing through that loop plus μ₀ε₀ times the rate of change of the electric field through the loop. Physically, it unifies magnetostatics (currents produce magnetic fields) with electrodynamics (a changing electric field also produces a magnetic field). The absence of magnetic monopoles (from ∇·B=0) ensures that all magnetic effects are tied to moving electric charges and to changing electric fields, preserving the symmetry and self–consistency of classical Maxwell’s equations.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent OdsU, explain physical meaning of Maxwell's magnetic field equations, thinking: The question asks for the physical interpretation of the two Maxwell equations involving B (from Sub-task 1: ∇·B=0 and ∇×B=μ₀J+μ₀ε₀∂E/∂t) and, in particular, why the absence of magnetic monopoles matters. I need to explain what each equation means physically: Gauss’s law for magnetism and the Ampère–Maxwell law, and highlight that ∇·B=0 implies no isolated magnetic charges exist in classical electromagnetism. This will address the significance of magnetic monopoles’ absence.; answer: Gauss’s law for magnetism (∇·B = 0) means that magnetic field lines always form closed loops and there are no 'magnetic charges' that act as sources or sinks of B—this is precisely the statement that magnetic monopoles do not exist in classical electromagnetism. As a result, the net magnetic flux through any closed surface is zero. Ampère–Maxwell law (∇×B = μ₀J + μ₀ε₀∂E/∂t) describes how magnetic fields circulate around electric currents J and around changing electric fields (the displacement current term μ₀ε₀∂E/∂t). Physically, currents and time-varying electric fields generate 'curl' or circulation of B. Together, these equations show that, classically, moving electric charges and varying electric fields are the only sources of magnetic effects, and there are no isolated magnetic poles.\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent WX0U, analyze modifications due to magnetic monopoles, thinking: In classical Maxwell theory we have four equations: \n1) Gauss’s law for electricity: ∇·E = ρ_e/ε₀\n2) Gauss’s law for magnetism: ∇·B = 0\n3) Faraday’s law: ∇×E = –∂B/∂t\n4) Ampère–Maxwell law: ∇×B = μ₀J_e + μ₀ε₀∂E/∂t\n\nSub-tasks 1 and 2 identified that the magnetic-field equations are (2) and (4), and explained that ∇·B=0 encodes “no monopoles” and that ∇×B relates currents (and changing E) to magnetic circulation. \n\nIn a universe with isolated magnetic charges (monopoles) ρ_m and currents J_m, we must allow magnetic charge sources in the divergence equation, and by duality a magnetic current term appears in the curl of E.  Ampère–Maxwell remains with electric quantities only, since electric charges still drive ∇×B.  Therefore only Gauss’s law for magnetism and Faraday’s law change.; answer: The Maxwell equations that change are Gauss’s law for magnetism and Faraday’s law:  \n  • ∇·B = ρ_m  (instead of zero)  \n  • ∇×E = –∂B/∂t – J_m  \nAll other equations remain as in the classical case.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCritic agent jO5I, providing feedback, thinking: The analysis correctly pinpoints that introducing magnetic charge ρₘ and current Jₘ forces two modifications: Gauss’s law for magnetism becomes ∇·B=ρₘ instead of zero, and Faraday’s law acquires a monopole‐current term, ∇×E=–∂B/∂t–Jₘ. However, it is limited in several ways:\n1. It treats the monopole fields purely classically and omits the Dirac quantization condition linking electric and magnetic charges.\n2. It does not discuss how to introduce monopoles in a gauge‐potential framework (e.g. Dirac strings or Wu–Yang potentials) to maintain consistency with the vector potential A.\n3. It neglects the requirement of local charge conservation for magnetic charge (∂ρₘ/∂t+∇·Jₘ=0) and its interplay with relativistic covariance.\n4. It overlooks experimental constraints—no monopoles have been observed—and thus does not address how such terms could be measured or bounded.\n5. It assumes perfect electric–magnetic duality but does not explore implications for the remaining Maxwell equations or for electromagnetic energy–momentum tensors.; answer: Only Gauss’s law for magnetism and Faraday’s law change when magnetic monopoles are included:  ∇·B=ρₘ  and  ∇×E=–∂B/∂t–Jₘ.
