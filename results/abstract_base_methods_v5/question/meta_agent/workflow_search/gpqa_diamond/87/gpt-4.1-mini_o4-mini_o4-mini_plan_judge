Question: Example(question='You tag the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with a GFP and deliver them to mice via oral gavage. By in vivo imaging, you observe that some of the fluorescence was destroyed by the stomach acid, and some were entangled in the intestinal mucus before they reached the secondary lymphoid organs. You identify the fluorescent Peyer patches and isolate the proliferating cell population. You sequence their variable heavy chain gene and observe high variability. Which process is taking place?', choice1='somatic hypermutation', choice2='complement activation', choice3='class switching recombination', choice4='VDJ recombination', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_24_87
proposed answer: The high sequence variability in the V_H genes of proliferating B cells isolated from Peyerâ€™s patches reflects antigen-driven diversification occurring in germinal centers of secondary lymphoid tissues. This process is mediated by activation-induced cytidine deaminase introducing point mutations into the V-region to increase antibody affinity after antigen exposure. V(D)J recombination happens only during early B-cell development, class switch recombination alters constant regions without affecting V regions, and complement activation does not change antibody gene sequences. Therefore, the observed variability is due to somatic hypermutation.
