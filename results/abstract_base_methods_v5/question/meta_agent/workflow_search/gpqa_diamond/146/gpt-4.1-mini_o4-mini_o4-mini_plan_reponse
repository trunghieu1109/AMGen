        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - We need to list all parameters given in the annihilation p\u2009+\u2009p\u0304\u21922A\u207a\u2009+\u20092A\u207b. The only particle mass specified is m_A, with m_A\u2009c\u00b2=300\u2009MeV. The proton mass is known from standard data, m_p\u2009c\u00b2\u2248938\u2009MeV. The initial conditions state the proton is at rest and the antiproton is \u201cslowly\u201d moving, implying its kinetic energy is negligible compared to rest energy and the total initial momentum is approximately zero. Thus the total initial energy is roughly the sum of the two rest energies, 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009938\u2009MeV.; answer - Known quantities:\n- Rest mass energy of A: m_A\u2009c\u00b2 = 300\u2009MeV\n- Rest mass energy of proton: m_p\u2009c\u00b2 \u2248 938\u2009MeV\nInitial conditions:\n- Proton at rest (zero momentum)\n- Antiproton moving slowly (negligible kinetic energy)\n\nTherefore:\n- Initial total energy \u2248 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009938\u2009MeV = 1876\u2009MeV\n- Initial total momentum \u2248 0\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - From Sub-task 1 we have the proton and antiproton each with rest mass energy m_p c^2 \u2248 938 MeV. The proton is at rest and the antiproton is moving very slowly, so its kinetic energy and momentum are negligible compared to its rest energy. Therefore the total initial energy is the sum of their rest energies: E_initial \u2248 938 MeV + 938 MeV = 1876 MeV. Since the proton\u2019s momentum is zero and the antiproton\u2019s momentum is negligible, the total initial momentum is approximately zero.; answer - The total initial energy is approximately 1876 MeV and the total initial momentum is approximately zero.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - From Sub-task 2, the proton at rest and a slowly moving antiproton each contribute their rest energy (~938\u2009MeV) to give a total initial energy of 2\u00d7938\u2009MeV = 1876\u2009MeV. The total initial momentum is approximately zero, so in the center-of-mass frame all of this energy is available to create the four A particles. Therefore, by conservation of energy and momentum (neglecting small kinetic contributions, radiative losses, and higher-order corrections), the total energy available for 2A+ + 2A\u2013 is 1876\u2009MeV.; answer - 1876 MeV\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - From sub-task 3 the total energy available is 1876 MeV. Each of the four A particles has rest mass energy of 300 MeV, giving 4\u00d7300 MeV = 1200 MeV total rest mass energy. Subtracting this from the total energy yields the kinetic energy: 1876 MeV \u2212 1200 MeV = 676 MeV.; answer - The kinetic energy available is 676 MeV.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - From Sub-task 4 the total kinetic energy is 676 MeV. Dividing equally among four A particles gives K_per = 676/4 = 169 MeV. Each A has rest energy m c\u00b2 = 300 MeV, so its total energy is E = 300 + 169 = 469 MeV. The Lorentz factor is \u03b3 = E/(m c\u00b2) = 469/300 \u2243 1.563. Then \u03b2 = v/c = \u221a(1 \u2212 1/\u03b3\u00b2) = \u221a(1 \u2212 1/1.563\u00b2) \u2243 \u221a(1 \u2212 0.4093) \u2243 0.768, hence v \u2243 0.77 c.; answer - 0.77c\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 6 output: thinking - From the energy\u2010momentum conservation calculation (Sub\u2010task 5), each A particle has speed v\u22480.768\u2009c. Rounding to two significant digits gives 0.77\u2009c, which exactly matches choice C in the list (0.96\u2009c, 0.91\u2009c, 0.77\u2009c, 0.86\u2009c). Therefore the correct answer is C.; answer - C"
