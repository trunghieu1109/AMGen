Question: Example(question='Consider this annihilation process\n\n$p+\\bar{p}\\rightarrow2A^{+}+2A^{-}$\n\nThe antiproton is slowly moving and $m_{A}c^{2}=300MeV$.\n\nWhat is the velocity of particle A?', choice1='0.96c', choice2='0.91c', choice3='0.77c', choice4='0.86c', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_146
proposed answer: From the energy‐momentum conservation calculation (Sub‐task 5), each A particle has speed v≈0.768 c. Rounding to two significant digits gives 0.77 c, which exactly matches choice C in the list (0.96 c, 0.91 c, 0.77 c, 0.86 c). Therefore the correct answer is C.

Answer:C
Extracted answer: C
