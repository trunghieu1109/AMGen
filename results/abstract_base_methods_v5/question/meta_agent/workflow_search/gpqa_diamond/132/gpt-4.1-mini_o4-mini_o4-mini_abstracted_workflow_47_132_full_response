The fraction of phosphate present as PO43– is given by α3 = (Ka1·Ka2·Ka3) / D ≃ 9.6×10^–6 (where D = [H+]^3 + Ka1[H+]^2 + Ka1·Ka2[H+] + Ka1·Ka2·Ka3). Multiplying these gives [PO43–] = α3·Ct = 9.6×10^–6 × 0.0649 M ≃ 6.24×10^–7 M. This calculation assumes ideal behavior (activity coefficients ≈1), neglects ionic‐strength effects on dissociation constants, ignores volume changes on dissolution, and omits other equilibria (e.g., metal complexation), so the real free [PO43–] may differ slightly.; answer: 6.24×10⁻⁷ M\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent Bg7i, round 0, selecting correct multiple-choice answer, thinking: From sub-task 6 we found [PO4^3–] ≃ 6.24×10^–7 M.
