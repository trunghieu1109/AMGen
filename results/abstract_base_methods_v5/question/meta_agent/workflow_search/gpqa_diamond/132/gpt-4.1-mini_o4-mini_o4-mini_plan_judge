Question: Example(question='We have a solution which has the volume of 200.00 cm3 and contains 1.00 g KH2PO4 (Mw = 136.09 g/mol) and 1.00 g Na2HPO4●2H2O (Mw = 177.99 g/mol) (T = 25 °C). What is the concentration of orthophosphate ions in this solution? The Ka1, Ka2 and Ka3 values for H3PO4 are 7.5x10^-3, 6.2x10^-8 and 1.8x10^-12, respectively.', choice1='5.48x10^-7 M ', choice2='6.24x10^-7 M', choice3='2.81x10^-7 M', choice4='3.97x10^-7 M ', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_47_132
proposed answer: From the previous calculation (sub‐task 6) the orthophosphate concentration was found to be 6.24×10^–7 M. Comparing this value to the provided options: A) 5.48×10^–7 M, B) 6.24×10^–7 M, C) 2.81×10^–7 M, D) 3.97×10^–7 M, only option B exactly matches the calculated result.

Answer:B)
Extracted answer: B)
