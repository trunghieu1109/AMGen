Question: Example(question="In gametogenesis, the germline undergoes two cycles of meiosis to give rise to haploid gametes. The goal of meiosis, unlike mitosis, is to separate not only the replicated sister chromatids but also the homologous chromosome pairs to form haploid cells. Fertilized gametes enter embryogenesis and ultimately develop into an organism. Meiosis is not always perfectly executed, and most such cases result in embryonic lethality. Viable events can already be detected in the karyotype of embryonic cells from the amniotic fluid. One such event results in Klinefelter's syndrome in boys. Which molecular mechanism is responsible for less prominent phenotypic consequences of Klinefelter's syndrome compared to better known Down's syndrome?", choice1='progression of the polymerase alpha in the morula/blastocyst', choice2='attachment of spindle to kinetochores in the metaphase I', choice3='chromatin methylation by histone methyltransferases in the post-zygote', choice4='chiasmata resolution by separase in diakinesis', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_56_96
proposed answer: The milder phenotype in Klinefelter’s syndrome (47,XXY) compared to Down’s syndrome (trisomy 21) is due to the ability of cells to inactivate one of the extra X chromosomes post‐zygotically. This process is driven by XIST RNA coating and recruitment of Polycomb repressive complexes (including PRC2/EZH2) and DNA methyltransferases, which deposit repressive histone marks (H3K27me3) and DNA methylation across the X chromosome, forming a condensed, largely transcriptionally silent Barr body. This epigenetic silencing buffers the gene dosage from the additional X, whereas chromosome 21 lacks a global inactivation mechanism, leading to widespread gene overexpression and more severe phenotypes. None of the other choices (DNA polymerase α progression, spindle–kinetochore attachment, separase‐mediated chiasmata resolution) explain the post‐zygotic dosage compensation unique to sex chromosomes.
