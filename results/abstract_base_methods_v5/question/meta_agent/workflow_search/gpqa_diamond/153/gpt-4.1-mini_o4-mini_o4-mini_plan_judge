Question: Example(question='In the lab, a chemist discovers an unnamed bottle with a white solid inside. He gathers the following spectral information in order to identify the liquid. Make a reasonable structural suggestion for the unidentified drug using the information provided.\nMass: molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 (100%)\na peak at m/z = 158 (32%)\nIR : broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1, strong sharp peak at 1720 cm-1\n1H NMR: 11.0 ppm (s, 1H), 8.02 ppm (d, 2H), 7.72 (d, 2H)', choice1='4-chlorobenzoic acid', choice2='2-chlorobenzoic acid', choice3='3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde\n', choice4='Phenyl chloroformate', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_5_153
proposed answer: The molecular ion at m/z 156 with an M+2 peak at 158 in a ~3:1 ratio indicates one Cl atom (C7H5ClO2). The IR shows a broad 3500–2700 cm⁻¹ band (hydrogen‐bonded O–H) and a sharp C=O stretch at 1720 cm⁻¹, consistent with a carboxylic acid. The ¹H NMR exhibits a singlet at 11.0 ppm (1H, COOH) and two doublets at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm (each 2H, J≈8 Hz), an AA′BB′ pattern diagnostic of a para-disubstituted benzene. Among the choices, only 4-chlorobenzoic acid fits the required formula, functional groups, and symmetric aromatic substitution.
