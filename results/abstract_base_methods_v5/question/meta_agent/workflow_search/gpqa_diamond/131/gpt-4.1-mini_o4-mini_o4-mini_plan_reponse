        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - First, calculate the degree of unsaturation (DU) for C10H14: DU = (2C + 2 \u2013 H)/2 = (20 + 2 \u2013 14)/2 = 4. A DU of 4 corresponds exactly to a benzene ring (one ring + three double bonds). That leaves no room for additional rings or pi bonds. The remaining atoms (beyond C6H6 of benzene) must be in alkyl substituents totaling C4H8 if we consider direct addition, but since each substituent replaces a hydrogen on benzene the accounting is C6H6 \u2013 x H + substituents = C10H14. Thus for four methyl substituents (x=4), we have C6H2 + C4H12 = C10H14 (tetramethylbenzenes), and for two ethyl substituents (x=2), C6H4 + C4H10 = C10H14 (diethylbenzene).; answer - Degree of unsaturation = 4, indicating one aromatic ring.

Their methyl shifts at 2.30 & 2.29 ppm (\u0394\u03b4=0.01 ppm) merge into 12H, plus separate singlets at 2.24 ppm (6H) and 2.22 ppm (6H), giving three singlets in a 12:6:6 (2:1:1) ratio at ~2.2 ppm. This exactly matches the experimental spectrum.; answer - D)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 7 output: thinking - In re\u2010evaluating the assumptions from Sub\u2010tasks 5 and 6, the key is whether the \u0394\u03b4 \u22640.02\u2009ppm overlap rule is applied realistically. The methyl resonances of 1,2,4,5\u2010 and 1,2,3,4\u2010tetramethylbenzene at 2.29 and 2.30\u2009ppm will coalesce into a single 12\u2009H singlet under high\u2010resolution conditions, while the pairs at 2.24 and 2.22\u2009ppm remain distinct 6\u2009H singlets (\u0394\u03b4=0.02\u2009ppm) \u2014 exactly matching the observed 2:1:1 integration at ~2.2\u2009ppm. The aromatic signals (each 2\u2009H singlet at ~6.7\u2009ppm in a 1:1 ratio) are uniquely accounted for by these two isomers. Although slight variations in solvent or temperature could shift peak separation, under typical experimental conditions the observed pattern is self\u2010consistent only with these two compounds. Thus no other pair fits both signal count and integration constraints as well.; answer - D\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 8 output: thinking - Based on the self\u2010consistent NMR analysis, only the combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene yields exactly three singlets around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 integration (two nearly coalesced 12 H signals at ~2.29\u20132.30 ppm and two distinct 6 H signals at ~2.24 and ~2.22 ppm) plus two aromatic singlets at ~6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. No other pair fits both the chemical shift separations and integration pattern under realistic \u0394\u03b4 \u22640.02 ppm overlap assumptions. Therefore, the correct choice is D.; answer - D"
