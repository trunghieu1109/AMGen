Question: Example(question='The 1H NMR spectrum of a solution containing a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14 exhibits two signals (two singlets) at around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. There are also three signals at around 2.2 ppm (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio. Which two compounds are present in the mixture from the following options: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, and 1,4-diethylbenzene.', choice1='1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene', choice2='1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene', choice3='1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene', choice4='1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene', correct_index=4)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_131
proposed answer: The experimental 1H NMR shows exactly two aromatic singlets at ~6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio, each integrating to 2 H, and three aliphatic singlets at ~2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio (total 24 H for the 1:1 mixture). Only the pair 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (choice B) meets these criteria: each isomer has a plane of symmetry giving one aromatic singlet (2 H) at ~6.7 ppm, and each has three distinct methyl environments (one set of equivalent methyls giving 6 H per isomer, and two unique methyls giving 3 H each). In a 1:1 mixture, these merge to three singlets in a 2:1:1 integration. No other pair matches the observed pattern.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_131
proposed answer: Based on the self‐consistent NMR analysis, only the combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene yields exactly three singlets around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 integration (two nearly coalesced 12 H signals at ~2.29–2.30 ppm and two distinct 6 H signals at ~2.24 and ~2.22 ppm) plus two aromatic singlets at ~6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. No other pair fits both the chemical shift separations and integration pattern under realistic Δδ ≤0.02 ppm overlap assumptions. Therefore, the correct choice is D.
