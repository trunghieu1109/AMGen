The main assumptions are: (1) treating the particle speed as exactly c (valid for ultrarelativistic X^0); (2) neglecting any spread in energy or angular deflections in the chamber; (3) assuming uniform detection efficiency out to L. In practice, chamber resolution (∼10^−5\u2009m) and track curvature could limit the observable fraction.
