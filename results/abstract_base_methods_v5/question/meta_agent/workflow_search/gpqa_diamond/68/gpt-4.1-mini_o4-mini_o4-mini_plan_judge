Question: Example(question='In the CERN Bubble Chamber a decay occurs, $X^{0}\\rightarrow Y^{+}Z^{-}$ in \\tau_{0}=8\\times10^{-16}s, i.e. the proper lifetime of X^{0}. What minimum resolution is needed to observe at least 30% of the decays? Knowing that the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27GeV, and the mass of X^{0} is 3.41GeV.', choice1='2.08*1e-1 m', choice2='2.08*1e-9 m', choice3='2.08*1e-6 m', choice4='2.08*1e-3 m', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_4_68
proposed answer: From Sub-task 3 we found the minimum decay length L_min≈6.8×10^−7 m. Comparing to the provided options: 2.08×10^−1 m, 2.08×10^−9 m, 2.08×10^−6 m, and 2.08×10^−3 m, only 2.08×10^−6 m (choice C) is of the same order of magnitude and exceeds L_min, thus providing the required resolution to observe at least 30% of decays. The other options are off by one or more orders of magnitude.
