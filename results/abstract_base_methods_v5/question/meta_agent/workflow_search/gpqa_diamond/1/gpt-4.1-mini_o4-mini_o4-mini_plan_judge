Question: Example(question='trans-cinnamaldehyde was treated with methylmagnesium bromide, forming product 1.\n\n1 was treated with pyridinium chlorochromate, forming product 2.\n\n3 was treated with (dimethyl(oxo)-l6-sulfaneylidene)methane in DMSO at elevated temperature, forming product 3.\n\nhow many carbon atoms are there in product 3?', choice1='10', choice2='12', choice3='11', choice4='14', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_1
proposed answer: Product 3 has a cyclopropane ring formed from the α,β‐unsaturated ketone by addition of one methylene from the ylide. The structure is 2-acetyl-3-phenylcyclopropane. Count: phenyl ring = 6 C, cyclopropane ring = 3 C (one from the ylide, two from the former C=C), acetyl substituent = 2 C (one carbonyl + one methyl). Total = 6 + 3 + 2 = 11 C atoms. This matches choice3.
