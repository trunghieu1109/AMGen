Catalytic hydrogenation reactivity on Pd/C correlates with heat of hydrogenation: less stable (di-substituted) alkenes react faster than more stable (tri-substituted) ones. Thus with one equivalent H2, the exocyclic isopropenyl double bond is selectively hydrogenated to an isopropyl group, while the ring C=C remains untouched. The stereocenter at C4 retains the original R configuration. The resulting product is (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexene, commonly called p-menth-1-ene.; answer - (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexene (p-menth-1-ene)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - 3-Chloroperbenzoic acid (mCPBA) is a peracid that epoxidizes alkenes by concerted electrophilic addition across the double bond.

Under basic conditions, methoxide attacks the less substituted carbon of the epoxide (C2) in a concerted SN2\u2010like step, inverting configuration at that center. However, on a cyclohexane ring the epoxide can adopt different chair conformations: one in which the C2\u2013O bond is axial and another where it\u2019s equatorial. Nucleophilic attack requires an antiperiplanar approach to the C2\u2013O bond. The preferred chair places the epoxy oxygen equatorial to minimize sterics, so the C2 carbon is attacked from the axial side, giving an equatorial methoxy substituent at C2. Meanwhile, the alkoxide formed at C1 is protonated by the solvent, placing the hydroxyl trans to the methoxy. Though minor attack at C1 cannot be fully excluded, the strong preference for less substituted\u2010carbon attack and antiperiplanar geometry leads predominantly to the trans-1-hydroxy-2-methoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexane. Stereoelectronic alignment, chair conformational energy, and regiochemical preference thus converge on this product, albeit as a mixture of ring\u2010flipped conformers.; answer - 1-hydroxy-2-methoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexane\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - Esterification of product 3 (trans-1-hydroxy-2-methoxy-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexane) with propanoic acid/DCC/DMAP converts the C1\u2013OH to a propionate ester without altering any stereocenter.

Upon hydrogenation of the exocyclic C4\u2013C7 \u03c0 bond with 1 equiv H\u2082 over Pd/C, that double bond is reduced to an isopropyl substituent, converting C4 from sp\u00b2 to sp\u00b3 and creating a new stereocenter.

Although an axial\u2010face attack route would also invert C2 (to R), it suffers severe 1,3\u2010diaxial strain and represents only a minor, high\u2010energy pathway.
