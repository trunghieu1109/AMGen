            "A supernova occurred in our Galaxy. Part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta part and the Galaxy are inertial frames of reference. From the reference frame of the ejecta, the center of the Galaxy is moving at 60 000 km/s (sixty thousand kilometers per second) towards it.\nWhat distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?\n\n(Note: Gravity can be ignored, and rotation and revolution of the Galaxy can be ignored.)",

        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The problem describes a supernova ejecta moving directly towards the Galactic center and asks for distances measured in different frames. To solve sub-task 1, I need to identify all given numerical values and the named reference frames. The statement explicitly gives: \u201cFrom the reference frame of the ejecta, the center of the Galaxy is moving at 60 000 km/s towards it.\u201d That is the relative velocity between the ejecta frame and the Galaxy center. It also states \u201cwhen 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame,\u201d which is the proper time interval measured in the ejecta frame. The two inertial frames involved are: the ejecta\u2019s rest frame and the Galaxy\u2019s rest frame (center of the Galaxy). No other physical quantities are provided (gravity, rotation, revolution are ignored).; answer - Given physical quantities and reference frames:\n\u2022 Relative velocity (ejecta frame): v = 60 000 km/s (Galactic center moving towards ejecta)\n\u2022 Time interval (ejecta frame): \u0394t\u2080 = 50 s\n\u2022 Reference frames: (1) Ejecta rest frame, (2) Galaxy (center) rest frame\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - The problem statement explicitly names two inertial reference frames: (1) the ejecta rest frame, in which the ejecta is at rest and the Galactic center moves; and (2) the Galaxy (center) rest frame, in which the Galactic center is at rest and the ejecta moves. It states: \u201cFrom the reference frame of the ejecta, the center of the Galaxy is moving at 60 000 km/s towards it,\u201d which fixes both the magnitude (60 000 km/s) and direction (toward the ejecta) of the relative velocity. No other frames or velocities are introduced, and all motion is assumed inertial and linear.; answer - Two inertial frames are involved: the ejecta rest frame and the Galaxy (center) rest frame. In the ejecta frame, the Galactic center moves at 60 000 km/s directly toward the ejecta; equivalently, in the Galaxy frame, the ejecta moves at 60 000 km/s toward the Galactic center.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - We use the Lorentz factor formula \u03b3 = 1/\u221a(1 \u2013 \u03b2\u00b2), where \u03b2 = v/c. Here v = 60,000 km/s and we approximate c = 300,000 km/s, giving \u03b2 = 0.2. Substituting, \u03b3 = 1/\u221a(1 \u2013 0.2\u00b2) = 1/\u221a(0.96) \u2248 1.02062. This calculation assumes inertial frames, constant velocity, uses c \u2248 300,000 km/s, and neglects gravitational effects and spacetime curvature, so it is an ideal special\u2010relativistic approximation.; answer - \u03b3 \u2248 1.0206\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - To convert the proper time interval \u03c4=50 s in the ejecta frame to the Galaxy frame time t, we apply the special-relativistic time dilation formula t=\u03b3\u22c5\u03c4. From Sub-task 3, \u03b3=1/\u221a(1\u2212\u03b2\u00b2) with \u03b2=v/c\u224860 000 km/s\u00f7300 000 km/s=0.2, giving \u03b3\u22481.02062. Multiplying \u03c4 by \u03b3 yields t\u22481.02062\u00d750 s\u224851.03 s. This result assumes both frames are inertial, moves at constant velocity, and neglects gravitational fields, acceleration, and clock-synchronization conventions.; answer - 51.03 s\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - To find the distance in the Galaxy frame, we first compute the time dilation factor \u03b3 = 1/\u221a[1 \u2212 (v\u00b2/c\u00b2)] with v = 60 000 km/s. At v = 0.2c, \u03b3 \u2248 1.02062. The proper time in the ejecta frame is \u03c4 = 50 s, so the dilated time in the Galaxy frame is t = \u03b3\u00b7\u03c4 \u2248 1.02062 \u00d7 50 s \u2248 51.031 s. Multiplying by the speed gives d = v\u00b7t = 60 000 km/s \u00d7 51.031 s \u2248 3 061 860 km, which rounds to 3 060 000 km. This corresponds to choice C.; answer - C)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 6 output: thinking - We calculated the time dilation factor \u03b3 = 1/\u221a(1 \u2212 (v\u00b2/c\u00b2)) for v = 60 000 km/s \u2248 0.2c, yielding \u03b3 \u2248 1.02062. The proper time \u03c4 = 50 s in the ejecta frame corresponds to t = \u03b3\u00b7\u03c4 \u2248 51.031 s in the Galaxy frame.
