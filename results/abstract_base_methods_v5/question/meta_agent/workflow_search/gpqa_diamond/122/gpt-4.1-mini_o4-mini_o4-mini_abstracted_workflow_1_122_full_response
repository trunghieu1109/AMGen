To solve sub-task 1, I need to identify all given numerical values and the named reference frames. The statement explicitly gives: “From the reference frame of the ejecta, the center of the Galaxy is moving at 60 000 km/s towards it.” That is the relative velocity between the ejecta frame and the Galaxy center. It also states “when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame,” which is the proper time interval measured in the ejecta frame.

Both the ejecta’s rest frame and the Galaxy‐center’s rest frame are defined as inertial (gravity and rotation ignored). By the principle of relativity, if in the ejecta frame the Galaxy center moves toward the ejecta at 60 000 km/s, then in the Galaxy frame the ejecta moves toward the center at the same speed. I will summarize these points.; answer: Inertial frames: (1) Ejecta rest frame, (2) Galaxy‐center rest frame. In the ejecta frame, the Galaxy center moves toward the ejecta at 60 000 km/s. Equivalently, in the Galaxy frame, the ejecta moves toward the Galactic center at 60 000 km/s along their line of motion.\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent FQ8b, calculating Lorentz factor gamma, thinking: We use the Lorentz factor definition γ=1/√(1−β²), where β=v/c. Here v=60,000\u2009km/s and c≈300,000\u2009km/s, so β=60,000/300,000=0.2.

However, this result assumes exactly c = 300 000 km/s (when a more precise value is 299 792 km/s), constant relative velocity, and strictly inertial frames. It neglects any gravitational fields, accelerations, or curvature of spacetime, so it is only an approximation valid under ideal special‐relativistic conditions.; answer: γ ≈ 1.02062; valid only for constant relative speeds in inertial frames, ignoring gravity and acceleration.\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent FQ8b, refining Lorentz factor calculation, thinking: We use the Lorentz factor formula γ = 1/√(1 – β²), where β = v/c.
