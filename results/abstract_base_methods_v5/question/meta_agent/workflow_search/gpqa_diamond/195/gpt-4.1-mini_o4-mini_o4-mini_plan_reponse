        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The original problem describes a one\u2010dimensional oscillator of mass m attached to a Hooke\u2019s\u2010law spring (F=\u2013kx) with maximum displacement A.  It explicitly invokes relativity (speed of light c) so kinetic energy must use the relativistic expression (involving the Lorentz factor \u03b3).  Energy is conserved (potential energy \u00bdk x\u00b2 at the turning point plus rest energy mc\u00b2 converts to kinetic energy at equilibrium).  No damping or external forces are mentioned, so motion is conservative.  The maximum speed occurs as the mass passes through x=0 where all spring potential has converted to kinetic energy and rest energy.; answer - Relevant physical quantities and assumptions:\n1. Mass (m) of the oscillator.\n2. Spring constant (k) defining Hooke\u2019s law F=\u2013kx.\n3. Maximum amplitude (A), the turning\u2010point displacement.\n4. Speed of light (c), indicating a relativistic regime.\n5. One\u2010dimensional motion, with restoring force F=\u2013kx valid at all velocities.\n6. Energy conservation: rest energy mc\u00b2 + spring potential energy (\u00bdkA\u00b2) converts to relativistic kinetic energy at x=0.\n7. No damping or external forces; purely conservative system.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - In the non\u2010relativistic limit, energy conservation gives \u00bdkA\u00b2 = \u00bdmv_max\u00b2. Solving for v_max yields v_max = A\u221a(k/m). This matches the well\u2010known classical result for a harmonic oscillator\u2019s maximum speed.; answer - v_max = A\u221a(k/m)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - In the relativistic regime the kinetic energy and momentum differ from their classical forms. Instead of T=\u00bdmv\u00b2 and p=mv, one must use T=(\u03b3\u20131)mc\u00b2 and p=\u03b3mv, where \u03b3=1/\u221a(1\u2013v\u00b2/c\u00b2). By energy conservation the total energy at the turning point (rest energy mc\u00b2 plus spring potential \u00bdkA\u00b2) equals the total energy at x=0 (\u03b3mc\u00b2), giving \u03b3=1+\u00bdkA\u00b2/(mc\u00b2). Solving \u03b3=1/\u221a(1\u2013v\u00b2/c\u00b2) for v then yields v_max=c\u221a(1\u20131/\u03b3\u00b2). This result differs from the classical v_max=A\u221a(k/m) by incorporating the Lorentz factor, ensuring that added energy increases the mass\u2013energy rather than v\u00b2 and that v_max approaches c asymptotically.; answer - Relativistic kinetic energy T=(\u03b3\u20131)mc\u00b2 and momentum p=\u03b3mv modify the energy relation to mc\u00b2+\u00bdkA\u00b2=\u03b3mc\u00b2 \u2192 \u03b3=1+\u00bdkA\u00b2/(mc\u00b2), leading to v_max=c\u221a(1\u20131/\u03b3\u00b2), in contrast to the classical v_max=A\u221a(k/m).\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - We want the total energy at the turning point (maximum amplitude A). In the relativistic regime the instantaneous total energy is E=\u03b3mc\u00b2+U(x)\u2013mc\u00b2 if one isolates kinetic, but more simply by energy conservation we equate the total invariant energy E_total to the sum of rest-mass energy and spring potential at the moment when v=0. At x=A the relativistic kinetic energy T=(\u03b3\u20131)mc\u00b2 vanishes (\u03b3=1), so all energy is stored in rest mass plus potential. Hence\nE_total=mc\u00b2+\u00bdkA\u00b2.; answer - E_total = mc\u00b2 + \u00bd k A\u00b2\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - By energy conservation, at maximum amplitude x=A the mass is momentarily at rest so its total energy is E = mc^2 + \u00bd k A^2. At x=0 this energy is converted into kinetic plus rest energy: \u03b3 m c^2 = mc^2 + \u00bd k A^2, so \u03b3 = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2). The relativistic relation \u03b3 = 1/\u221a(1\u2212v^2/c^2) implies v_max = c\u221a(1 \u2212 1/\u03b3^2) = c\u221a[1 \u2212 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2))^2], which matches choice 2.; answer - B)"
