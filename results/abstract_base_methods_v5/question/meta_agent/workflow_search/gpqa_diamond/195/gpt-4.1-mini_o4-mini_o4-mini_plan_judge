Question: Example(question=" Consider a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass $m$ and maximum amplitude $A$ obeying Hook's law ($F=-kx$). What is the maximum speed  $v_max$ of the mass? The speed of light is $c$.", choice1='$v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})}}$', choice2='$v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$', choice3='$v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2m})^2}}$', choice4='$v_{max}=\\sqrt{\\frac{kA^2}{m}}$', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: By energy conservation, at maximum amplitude x=A the mass is momentarily at rest so its total energy is E = mc^2 + ½ k A^2. At x=0 this energy is converted into kinetic plus rest energy: γ m c^2 = mc^2 + ½ k A^2, so γ = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2). The relativistic relation γ = 1/√(1−v^2/c^2) implies v_max = c√(1 − 1/γ^2) = c√[1 − 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2))^2], which matches choice 2.
