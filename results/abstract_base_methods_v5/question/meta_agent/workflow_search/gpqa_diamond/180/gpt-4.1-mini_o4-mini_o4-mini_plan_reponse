        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - To address this sub\u2010task, I recall that the Sun\u2019s neutrinos come from several fusion chains: the pp chain (which itself splits into pp-I, pp-II, pp-III sub\u2010branches, plus the minor pep and hep channels) and the CNO cycles. Each yields neutrinos in characteristic energy windows. The pp-III branch is defined by the decay of 8B into 8Be*\u2009+\u2009e+\u2009+\u2009\u03bde; it produces the highest\u2010energy solar neutrinos (a continuous spectrum up to \u224315\u2009MeV, with a mean around 7\u20138\u2009MeV). To be complete, I list all main branches with their typical energy ranges and note that pp-III \u2261 the 8B decay neutrinos.; answer - The main solar neutrino production branches are:\n\n1) pp-I chain:\n   \u2013 pp reaction: p + p \u2192 d + e+ + \u03bde. Continuous \u03bd spectrum from 0 up to 0.420\u2009MeV (average ~0.26\u2009MeV).\n   \u2013 pep reaction: p + e\u2013 + p \u2192 d + \u03bde. Monoenergetic line at 1.44\u2009MeV (very small flux compared to pp).\n\n2) pp-II chain:\n   \u2013 7Be electron capture: 7Be + e\u2013 \u2192 7Li + \u03bde. Two lines at 0.384\u2009MeV (\u224810%) and 0.861\u2009MeV (\u224890%).\n\n3) pp-III chain (the focus here):\n   \u2013 8B \u03b2+ decay: 8B \u2192 8Be* + e+ + \u03bde. Continuous spectrum from 0 up to \u224315\u2009MeV (mean ~7\u20138\u2009MeV). These are the highest\u2010energy solar neutrinos.\n\n4) hep branch (rare):\n   \u2013 3He + p \u2192 4He + e+ + \u03bde. Continuous up to ~18.8\u2009MeV, but extremely low flux.\n\n5) CNO cycle branches (subdominant in the Sun):\n   \u2013 13N \u03b2+ decay: \u03bde up to ~1.2\u2009MeV;\n   \u2013 15O \u03b2+ decay: \u03bde up to ~1.7\u2009MeV;\n   \u2013 17F \u03b2+ decay: \u03bde up to ~1.7\u2009MeV.\n\nThus the pp-III branch refers specifically to 8B decay neutrinos, with a continuous energy spectrum spanning ~0\u201315\u2009MeV, distinguishing them from the lower\u2010energy lines and continuous spectra of the other pp and CNO reactions.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - The two energy windows lie above the pp continuum endpoint (420 keV), so no pp-I \u03bd\u2019s contribute. They lie below the pep line at 1.44 MeV, so no pep. They also lie below the CNO endpoints (\u223c1.2\u20131.7 MeV), so no significant CNO neutrinos. The only branches that can populate 700\u2013900 keV are the pp-II 7Be line at 861 keV and the continuous tail of the pp-III 8B spectrum (which extends from 0 up to \u223c15 MeV). \n\n\u2022 Band 1 (700\u2013800 keV): entirely in the 8B continuum. No 7Be line falls here, so only pp-III neutrinos contribute.  \n\u2022 Band 2 (800\u2013900 keV): straddles the 7Be line at 861 keV (pp-II), which dominates, plus a small contribution from the 8B tail (pp-III).  \n\nThus both bands receive pp-III flux, but only band 2 also has the strong 7Be line.; answer - Band 1 (700\u2013800 keV): only pp-III (8B) neutrinos.  Band 2 (800\u2013900 keV): dominated by the 7Be line (pp-II) at 861 keV, with a small pp-III (8B) tail.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - Neutrinos produced after pp\u2010III branches stopped 8.5\u2009min ago haven\u2019t yet reached Earth. Band 1 (700\u2013800 keV) is essentially pure pp\u2010III flux, so its current arrival rate falls to zero. Band 2 (800\u2013900 keV) is overwhelmingly from the 7Be line (pp\u2010II) and is unaffected by the pp\u2010III cutoff (only a negligible 8B tail is removed). Thus the instantaneous flux in band 1 is zero while band 2 remains at its normal value, giving a flux ratio of zero. In reality tiny contributions from pep or detector/Earth\u2010crossing effects mean it\u2019s not exactly zero, but for this idealized scenario the ratio is zero.; answer - flux\u2081/flux\u2082 = 0\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - Neutrinos in the 700\u2013800 keV band are almost exclusively from the low\u2010energy tail of the pp-III (8B) continuum. The total 8B flux is \u22435\u00d710^6 cm\u207b\u00b2 s\u207b\u00b9 and only O(1%) of that lies between 700 and 800 keV, i.e. \u22435\u00d710^4 cm\u207b\u00b2 s\u207b\u00b9 under normal operation. If the pp-III branch shuts off 8.5 min ago, none of those neutrinos have yet reached Earth, so the instantaneous 700\u2013800 keV flux drops to zero. In contrast, the 800\u2013900 keV band is dominated by the 7Be line at 861 keV from the pp-II branch (flux \u22434.85\u00d710^9 cm\u207b\u00b2 s\u207b\u00b9, \u223c90% of which falls in 800\u2013900 keV), giving \u22434.36\u00d710^9 cm\u207b\u00b2 s\u207b\u00b9. That component is unaffected by the pp-III cutoff. Thus the fluxes are: Flux(700\u2013800 keV)=0; Flux(800\u2013900 keV)\u22484.4\u00d710^9 cm\u207b\u00b2 s\u207b\u00b9.; answer - Flux(700\u2013800 keV) \u2243 0 cm\u207b\u00b2 s\u207b\u00b9; Flux(800\u2013900 keV) \u2243 4.4\u00d710^9 cm\u207b\u00b2 s\u207b\u00b9\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - After the pp-III branch (8B neutrinos) stops, there are no neutrinos in the 700\u2013800 keV band at Earth (their source is gone), whereas the 800\u2013900 keV band is still populated by the unaffected 7Be line (~4.4\u00d710^9 cm^\u20132 s^\u20131). Thus Flux(700\u2013800 keV)=0, Flux(800\u2013900 keV)>0, giving a ratio of 0.; answer - 0\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 6 output: thinking - The pp-III branch produces neutrinos in the 700\u2013800 keV band. If it stops, that band\u2019s flux goes to zero, while the 800\u2013900 keV band still has the 862 keV 7Be line. The true ratio is 0, which isn\u2019t listed among A) 0.1, B) 10, C) 1, D) 0.01. The smallest nonzero choice (0.01) is the closest to zero, so the correct answer is D.; answer - D"
