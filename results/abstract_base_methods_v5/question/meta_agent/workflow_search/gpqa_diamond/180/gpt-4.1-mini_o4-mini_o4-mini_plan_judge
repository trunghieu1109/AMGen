Question: Example(question='Very large number of neutrinos produced by the Sun reach the Earth (very large flux of neutrinos, defined as the number of neutrinos per cm^2, per second).\n\nLet us assume that, hypothetically, the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the core of the Sun about 8 and a half minutes ago, while all other reactions remained as they were.\n\nWhat would be the approximate ratio of the flux between two bands of neutrino energies of 700-800 KeV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). \n\nFlux (band 1) / flux (band 2) is:\n\n(Note: we are talking about stopping the pp-III branch, not pp-II, pp-I or any other. It’s not a typo or something like that.)\n(Note 2: solar neutrino flavor changes happen, but do not play a role here.)', choice1='0.1 (10^-1).', choice2='10.', choice3='1.', choice4='0.01 (10^-2).', correct_index=4)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_180
proposed answer: The pp-III branch produces neutrinos in the 700–800 keV band. If it stops, that band’s flux goes to zero, while the 800–900 keV band still has the 862 keV 7Be line. The true ratio is 0, which isn’t listed among A) 0.1, B) 10, C) 1, D) 0.01. The smallest nonzero choice (0.01) is the closest to zero, so the correct answer is D.
