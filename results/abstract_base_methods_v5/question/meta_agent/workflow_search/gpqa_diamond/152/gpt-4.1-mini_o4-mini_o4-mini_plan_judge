Question: Example(question='α-β unsaturated carbonyls have a much more electrophilic carbon double bond. These double bonds act as a good Lewis acid and react with nucleophiles to produce enolate ions. In this case, when a nucleophile attacks the β position, it produces a resonance-stabilized intermediate. When a nucleophile attacking the β-carbon is enolate, such reaction is known as the Michael reaction.\nWhat are the reactants and major final products of the following Michael addition reactions?\ndimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) -->(A)\n1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H3O+) --> (B)\nC + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H2O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice1='A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice2='A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice3='A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice4='A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: The predicted products are: 
A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate (from dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate),
B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile (from 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile),
C must be cyclohexane-1,3-dione (to give 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione under KOH/H2O).  Only choice4 matches all three: A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione.  Therefore, the correct selection is choice4.

proposed answer: I re-examined each of the three Michael additions and compared them to the four provided answer choices. For reaction (A), the actual Michael adduct is a trimethyl 1,2,3-tricarboxylate bearing a benzyl (p-tolylmethyl) substituent at C2, whereas all choices list either 1,1,2- or 1,1,3-tricarboxylates and an aryl, not benzyl, substituent. For reaction (B), the correct product is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, which appears only in choices 1 and 4—but both of those choices already fail for A. For reaction (C), the donor is cyclohexane-1,3-dione (not its enol), giving the 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione product, which none of the choices lists. Thus no single choice matches all three transformations correctly.
