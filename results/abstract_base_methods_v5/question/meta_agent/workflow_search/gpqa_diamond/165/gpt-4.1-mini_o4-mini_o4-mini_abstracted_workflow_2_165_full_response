At tree level it is massless, but one–loop Coleman–Weinberg corrections from all fields that couple to φ/h lift its mass.  The general one–loop mass–squared is given by the supertrace of fourth powers of field–dependent masses, divided by 8π²f², with f²=(x²+v²).  Bosonic loops (scalars and gauge bosons) give positive contributions ∝+M_b⁴, while fermionic loops give negative ones ∝−M_f⁴.  In our model the relevant states are the SM–like Higgs h₁, the W and Z, the extra scalars H±, H⁰, A⁰ and the singlet fermions N_i (and, if included, the top quark).

However, any explicit breaking of that symmetry—for instance via gauge interactions, Yukawa couplings to fermions, or scalar quartic couplings—induces a nonzero mass at the one‐loop level.  Computing the Coleman–Weinberg effective potential and expanding to second order in the pseudo‐Goldstone field yields a mass squared given by the second derivative of the one‐loop potential at the vacuum.  Each particle that couples to the symmetry‐breaking fields contributes a term proportional to its fourth power of mass, weighted by the sign (+ for bosons, – for fermions) and by coupling‐dependent coefficients.  Since the symmetry is jointly broken by the singlet VEV x and the Higgs VEV v, the overall coefficient normalizes to 1/(8π²(x²+v²)).  This reproduces the generic form seen in subtask 1 but now understood as coming from the sum over loop contributions of scalars, gauge bosons, and singlet fermions.; answer: M_{H2}^2 ≃ 1/[8π^2(x^2+v^2)]·{∑_bosons\u2009α_b\u2009M_b^4 − ∑_fermions\u2009α_f\u2009M_f^4}\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent aUJf, deriving pseudo-Goldstone boson mass formula, thinking: We need the one-loop Coleman–Weinberg generated mass for the would‐be Goldstone boson in the two‐VEV scalar sector, normalised by the total radius √(x²+v²).

Bosonic degrees of freedom (h1,H±,H0,A0,W,Z) enter with positive M^4 contributions, fermions (top and N_i) with negative ones, and the overall factor 1/[8π^2(x^2+v^2)] normalises the curvature along the pseudo-Goldstone direction. Limitations include: (1) It is strictly a one-loop result—higher-loop, RG-improved or resummed corrections can be numerically important for large couplings. (2) Gauge dependence of the effective potential may shift the mass unless computed in a gauge-invariant scheme. (3) Momentum dependence (wavefunction renormalisation) is ignored.
