Since the initial π+ is at rest, its total energy is just its rest‐mass energy and its total momentum is zero.

The total energy of the decay products must equal the rest energy of the parent π+.; answer: Conservation of energy: m_π c^2 = E_μ + E_ν; Conservation of momentum: 0 = p_μ + p_ν (hence |p_μ| = |p_ν| and p_μ = -p_ν).\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent ZGwC, round 0, conservation laws, thinking: In the decay π⁺ → μ⁺ + ν, we apply the fundamental conservation laws. Since the π⁺ is initially at rest, its total energy is purely its rest energy and its momentum is zero.

By writing M c² = E_μ + p c and E_μ = √(p²c² + m²c⁴), then squaring and solving, one obtains K_μ = E_μ – m c² = (M – m)²c²/(2M). However, the key limitations are:\n1. Neutrino mass neglected: If the neutrino has a small but nonzero mass, the formula will slightly overestimate K_μ.  \n2. No recoil corrections beyond first order: Higher-order radiative or weak-interaction effects (e.g., internal bremsstrahlung) are omitted.  \n3. Pion at exact rest: In practice, a thermal or beam pion may have small momentum, shifting the muon KE distribution.  \n4.
