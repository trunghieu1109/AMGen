The aperture is described as an N-sided polygon with identical apothems, so it must be a regular N-gon. The apothem a is the perpendicular distance from the center of this polygon to each side, defining the inscribed circle radius.

The apothem a is the radius of the inscribed circle.

The apothem of the polygon is by definition the radius of its inscribed circle. In the limit N→∞, all vertices lie on that inscribed circle and the polygon fills in to become the circle.
