Question: Example(question='Consider an aperture, which shapes like a N-sided polygon. All the apothems are of the same length a. When a monochromatic light (of wavelength \\lambda), travelling along z-axis, falls vertically on this aperture, it creates a series of intensity maxima and minima in the far field region. What is the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large ? Assume that the related angles are small so that tan theta = theta approximation can be taken.', choice1='1.220 \\lambda /a ', choice2='0.610 \\lambda / a', choice3='0.500 \\lambda / a', choice4='0.506 \\lambda / a', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: For a regular N-sided polygon as N→∞, the aperture becomes a circle of apothem a = radius. The Fraunhofer diffraction pattern is given by (2J1(ka θ)/(ka θ))² with k=2π/λ. Zeros occur at ka θ₁=3.8317 and ka θ₂=7.0156, so θ₁=3.8317/(2πa)λ≈0.61 λ/a and θ₂=7.0156/(2πa)λ≈1.12 λ/a. The angular separation is Δθ=θ₂−θ₁≈(1.12−0.61)λ/a=0.51λ/a, which matches option D (0.506 λ/a) most closely.
