            "Consider an aperture, which shapes like a N-sided polygon. All the apothems are of the same length a. When a monochromatic light (of wavelength \\lambda), travelling along z-axis, falls vertically on this aperture, it creates a series of intensity maxima and minima in the far field region. What is the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large ? Assume that the related angles are small so that tan theta = theta approximation can be taken.",

        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The question asks to identify the shape of the aperture, the meaning of the apothem length a, the wavelength \u03bb, and the direction of propagation. The aperture is described as an N-sided polygon with identical apothems, so it must be a regular N-gon. The apothem a is the perpendicular distance from the center of this polygon to each side, defining the inscribed circle radius. The light is monochromatic of wavelength \u03bb and travels along the z-axis, meaning it is incident normally on the aperture. Each of these details comes directly from the problem statement describing the geometry and illumination conditions.; answer - The aperture is a regular N-sided polygon with apothem length a (the distance from the center to each side), illuminated by monochromatic light of wavelength \u03bb traveling along the z-axis (normal incidence).\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - As N grows without bound, the regular N-sided polygon more and more closely approximates a circle. The apothem of the polygon is the radius of its inscribed circle, and in the limit N\u2192\u221e the inscribed circle becomes the actual boundary of the shape. Hence the aperture becomes a perfect circular opening whose radius is exactly the apothem a.; answer - When N\u2192\u221e, the polygonal aperture becomes a circular aperture of radius a.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - For a circular aperture of radius a, illuminated by monochromatic light of wavelength \u03bb, the far-field (Fraunhofer) diffraction pattern is described by the Airy pattern. The complex amplitude is proportional to J1(k a \u03b8)/(k a \u03b8), where J1 is the first-order Bessel function and k=2\u03c0/\u03bb. Intensity minima occur where J1(k a \u03b8)=0. Let \u03b1n be the nth zero of J1. Then k a \u03b8n=\u03b1n \u21d2 \u03b8n=\u03b1n\u03bb/(2\u03c0a).
