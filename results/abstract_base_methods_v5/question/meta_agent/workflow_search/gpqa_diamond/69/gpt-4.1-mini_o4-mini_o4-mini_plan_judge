Question: Example(question='reaction of solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C.\nWhen C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E.\nC reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid while G is a weak acid.\nD reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.\n\nwhat is the molecular symmetry group of E?', choice1='C2', choice2='C2v', choice3='D4h', choice4='D∞h', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_36_69
proposed answer: The molecule E has one principal C2 axis and two mutually perpendicular mirror planes (one coincident with the molecular plane and one perpendicular to it), but it lacks any higher-order rotational axes (ruling out D4h and D∞h) and has no center of inversion. These symmetry elements exactly match the C2v point group. Therefore, among the choices (A) C2, (B) C2v, (C) D4h, and (D) D∞h, the correct match is C2v.
