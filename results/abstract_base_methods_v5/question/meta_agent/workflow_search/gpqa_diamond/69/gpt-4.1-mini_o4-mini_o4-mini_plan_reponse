        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - We\u2019re looking for a sequence in which a solid A picks up exactly 8 molecules of a gaseous ligand B to give a bright red carbonyl, then that carbonyl reacts with water to regenerate the metal plus two acids (one stronger, one weaker), and also reacts with Cl\u2082 to give an \u201cextremely hazardous\u201d product E; finally B and D combine 1:1 to give a commonly used solvent H.\n\n\u2022 B must be CO (a gas ligand), since many metals form carbonyls and CO + Cl\u2082 \u2192 COCl\u2082 (phosgene). Phosgene is extremely hazardous and was once used as a solvent/intermediate.\n\n\u2022 A must be a metal that forms a stable, bright red carbonyl with 8 CO ligands: that is dicobalt octacarbonyl Co\u2082(CO)\u2088 (C). It is known to be a red crystalline solid made from Co(0) + 8\u2009CO.\n\n\u2022 C + H\u2082O hydrolyzes to Co metal (A) plus formic acid (HCOOH, a relatively stronger acid of the two) and carbonic acid (H\u2082CO\u2083, weaker). \n\n\u2022 C + Cl\u2082 (2 equiv) under mild conditions releases phosgene (COCl\u2082, E), regenerates CoCl\u2082, etc. The phosgene is \u201cextremely hazardous.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Finally B (CO) + D (Cl\u2082) in a 1:1 ratio directly yields H = phosgene, which historically was used industrially as a solvent/intermediate.\n\nThus the assignments are:; answer - A = cobalt metal (Co\u2070);\nB = carbon monoxide (CO, gas);\nC = dicobalt octacarbonyl, Co\u2082(CO)\u2088 (bright red solid);\nD = chlorine gas (Cl\u2082);\nE = phosgene, COCl\u2082 (extremely hazardous);\nF = formic acid (HCOOH, stronger acid of the two);\nG = carbonic acid (H\u2082CO\u2083, weaker acid);\nH = phosgene, COCl\u2082 (1:1 CO + Cl\u2082), used as a solvent/intermediate.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - Based on the species assignments from Sub-task 1 (A = Co metal, B = CO, C = Co\u2082(CO)\u2088, D = Cl\u2082, E = COCl\u2082, F = HCOOH, G = H\u2082CO\u2083), we can write each transformation: 1) A\u2192C is the well-known carbonylation of cobalt metal by 8 equivalents of CO; 2) C\u2192E is the chlorinolysis of Co\u2082(CO)\u2088 by 2 equiv Cl\u2082 liberating phosgene and forming CoCl\u2082; 3) C\u2192A+F+G is the hydrolysis of the cobalt carbonyl, which strips CO ligands to give back metallic Co plus formic acid (strong acid) and carbonic acid (weak acid). Stoichiometric ratios follow directly from the number of CO and Cl\u2082 ligands involved.; answer - 1) A \u2192 C (carbonylation): Co (s) + 8 CO (g) \u2192 Co\u2082(CO)\u2088 (bright red solid)  \n2) C \u2192 E (chlorinolysis): Co\u2082(CO)\u2088 + 2 Cl\u2082 \u2192 2 COCl\u2082 (E, phosgene) + 2 CoCl\u2082  \n3) C \u2192 A + F + G (hydrolysis): Co\u2082(CO)\u2088 + 2 H\u2082O \u2192 2 Co (s, A) + 2 HCOOH (F, strong acid) + H\u2082CO\u2083 (G, weak acid)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - From Sub-task 1 we identified B as carbon monoxide (CO) and D as chlorine gas (Cl\u2082), and H as phosgene (COCl\u2082). The reaction of CO with Cl\u2082 is well\u2010known to proceed in a 1:1 molar ratio under controlled conditions to give phosgene: CO + Cl\u2082 \u2192 COCl\u2082. Phosgene has historically been employed as a versatile solvent and intermediate in organic synthesis due to its ability to introduce carbonyl and acid chloride functionalities. Thus, based on the characterization of B and D, the formation of H follows a simple 1:1 stoichiometry and H\u2019s role as a solvent arises from its chemical reactivity and physical properties.; answer - The reaction of D (Cl\u2082) with B (CO) proceeds in a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio to yield H (phosgene, COCl\u2082), which is used industrially as a solvent and intermediate in organic synthesis.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - Based on Sub-task 2, the chlorinolysis of Co2(CO)8 by Cl2 liberates phosgene (COCl2) as the extremely hazardous product E. Sub-task 3 confirms that CO and Cl2 combine in a 1:1 ratio to form COCl2. Phosgene is a well\u2010known toxic gas with formula COCl2. Its central carbon is sp2 hybridized, bearing one C=O double bond and two C\u2013Cl single bonds. This gives a trigonal planar geometry with approximately 120\u00b0 bond angles. The hazardous nature of E matches phosgene\u2019s historical use as a chemical warfare agent and its high toxicity. Although side reactions or coordination complexes could occur under some conditions, the clean stoichiometry and known reactivity support COCl2 as the major product.; answer - Phosgene, COCl2, with a trigonal planar structure Cl\u2013C(=O)\u2013Cl.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - Product E is phosgene, COCl\u2082, which is planar with an sp\u00b2\u2010hybridized C atom bonded to one O and two identical Cl atoms. Its symmetry elements are: (1) the identity E; (2) a C\u2082 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane that swaps the two Cl atoms and leaves O unchanged; (3) a vertical mirror plane \u03c3\u1d65 coincident with the molecular plane (containing C, O, and both Cl atoms); and (4) a second vertical mirror plane \u03c3\u1d65\u2032 perpendicular to the molecular plane that bisects the Cl\u2013C\u2013Cl angle, reflecting one Cl into the other. There is no horizontal mirror plane, no inversion center, and no higher-order rotation axis. These symmetry operations define the C\u2082\u1d65 point group.; answer - C2v\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 6 output: thinking - The molecule E has one principal C2 axis and two mutually perpendicular mirror planes (one coincident with the molecular plane and one perpendicular to it), but it lacks any higher-order rotational axes (ruling out D4h and D\u221eh) and has no center of inversion. These symmetry elements exactly match the C2v point group. Therefore, among the choices (A) C2, (B) C2v, (C) D4h, and (D) D\u221eh, the correct match is C2v.; answer - B)"
