            "We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.\nSo far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? ",

        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The sub-task asks for a clear restatement of the problem context. The original scenario involves a single radioactive atom whose probability of decaying within 100 minutes is known to be 32%. We then observe that after 50 minutes no decay has occurred, and the question is what the probability of decay in the following 150 minutes is. To restate accurately, we must mention the known decay probability over 100 minutes, the elapsed 50-minute observation without decay, and the new time interval of interest (150 minutes).; answer - We have a single atom whose probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, and after observing it for 50 minutes without decay, we want to find the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - Radioactive decay is well modeled by an exponential distribution, which has the memoryless property P(T>t+s | T>t)=P(T>s). Here we know P(decay \u2264100\u2009min)=0.32 \u21d2 \u03bb=\u2212ln(0.68)/100. Because of memorylessness, the probability of decay in the next 150\u2009min given no decay in the first 50\u2009min is the same as P(decay \u2264150\u2009min) = 1\u2212e^{\u2212\u03bb\u00b7150}. Thus we can treat it directly as a conditional probability given survival to 50\u2009min.; answer - The appropriate model is exponential decay (memoryless), so yes\u2014the decay probability in the next 150\u2009minutes given no decay in the first 50\u2009minutes is treated as a conditional probability using the memoryless property.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - We know for exponential decay P(decay\u2264t)=1\u2212e^{\u2212\u03bbt}. Given P(decay\u2264100)=0.32 \u21d2 e^{\u2212\u03bb\u00b7100}=0.68 \u21d2 \u2212\u03bb\u00b7100=ln(0.68) \u21d2 \u03bb=\u2212ln(0.68)/100. Numerically ln(0.68)\u2248\u22120.38566, so \u03bb\u22480.0038566 per minute.; answer - \u03bb = \u2212ln(0.68) / 100 \u2248 0.00386 per minute\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - We have an exponential decay process with rate \u03bb\u22480.0038566\u2009min\u207b\u00b9. By the memoryless property, the probability of decay over the next \u0394t=150\u2009min given survival so far is P=1\u2212e^{\u2212\u03bb\u00b7\u0394t}. Plugging in \u03bb\u22480.0038566 and \u0394t=150 gives 1\u2212e^{\u22120.0038566\u00d7150}\u22481\u2212e^{\u22120.57849}\u22481\u22120.5607\u22480.4393, or about 43.93%. Rounding to two significant figures yields \u224844%.; answer - Approximately 44%\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - The exponential (memoryless) decay gives \u03bb = -ln(1\u20130.32)/100, so P(decay in next 150 min) = 1\u2013e^{\u2013\u03bb\u00b7150} \u2248 43.93%, which rounds to 44%.
