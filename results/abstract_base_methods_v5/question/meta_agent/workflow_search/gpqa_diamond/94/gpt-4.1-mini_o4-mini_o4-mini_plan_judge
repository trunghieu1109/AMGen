Question: Example(question='3,3,6-trimethylhepta-1,5-dien-4-one is treated with 1 equivalent of meta-chloroperbenzoic acid. Two different products are formed, in approximately a 1:1 ratio.\n\nIn a separate vessel, Methyllithium is treated with copper(I)iodide. an excess of the resulting solution is slowly added to the product mixture of the first reaction. Name one product that will be formed by this reaction:', choice1='4,4,5,7,7-pentamethyloctane-3,5-diol', choice2='2,3,4,5,5-pentamethylhept-6-ene-2,4-diol', choice3='5-hydroxy-3,3,6,6-tetramethylhept-1-en-4-one', choice4='6-hydroxy-2,2,5,5-tetramethyloctan-4-one', correct_index=4)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_37_94
proposed answer: The Gilman reagent (Me2CuLi) opens each epoxide by SN2 at the less‐substituted carbon to give two heptan‐4‐ones bearing one OH and one new Me: 2-hydroxy-1,3,3,6-tetramethylheptan-4-one and 6-hydroxy-3,3,5,6-tetramethylheptan-4-one. Choice A is a diol on an octane (no ketone), B is an unsaturated diol (no ketone), C is an enone with wrong double‐bond position and methyl pattern, and D is an octanone with incorrect methyl locations. None of the given structures matches the predicted mono-hydroxy tetramethylheptan-4-ones.

proposed answer: Based on the mechanistic prediction from Sub-task 4 and critical comparison in Sub-task 5, only choice C retains the original ketone at C4, one alkene at C1–C2, and bears a single new hydroxy and methyl at the epoxide-opened positions (C5–C6). Choices A and B are diols with no ketone, and D is fully saturated with no alkene, so they are inconsistent. Therefore the correct product is choice C.

Answer:5-hydroxy-3,3,6,6-tetramethylhept-1-en-4-one
