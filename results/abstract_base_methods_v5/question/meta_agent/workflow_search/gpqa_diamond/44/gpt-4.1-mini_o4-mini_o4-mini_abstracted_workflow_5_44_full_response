To form the first excited state, we must promote one fermion from the highest occupied single‐particle level (n=2) to the next available level (n=3), without violating the Pauli exclusion principle. Since each (n,spin) can be singly occupied, we remove one fermion from (n=2,↓) and place it in (n=3,↑) (the choice of spin for n=3 does not affect the energy). The occupied states become (n=1,↑), (n=1,↓), (n=2,↑), (n=3,↑). The single‐particle energies are 1²E, 1²E, 2²E=4E, 3²E=9E. Summing yields 1E+1E+4E+9E=15E.

Thus the second excited state is (n=1, one spin), (n=2 both spins), (n=3, one spin).; answer: Configuration: (n=1,↑), (n=2,↑), (n=2,↓), (n=3,↑); total energy = 18E\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent xHpk, round 0, identifying second excited state, thinking: To find the second excited state, we list all allowed 4‐particle configurations (each n level can hold at most two spin‐½ fermions) and compute their total energies (in units of E = π²ħ²/2mL²):\n\nGround state: n = 1,1,2,2 ⇒ 1+1+4+4 = 10E\n1st excited: n = 1,1,2,3 ⇒ 1+1+4+9 = 15E\n\nNext we seek the configuration with the next smallest sum:\n- n = 1,2,2,3 ⇒ 1+4+4+9 = 18E\n- n = 1,1,3,3 ⇒ 1+1+9+9 = 20E\n- n = 1,1,2,4 ⇒ 1+1+4+16 = 22E\n\nThe smallest above 15E is 18E, from n = 1,2,2,3. This respects Pauli exclusion (two fermions in n=2 with opposite spins; one in n=1; one in n=3).; answer: Configuration: one fermion in n=1 (either spin), two in n=2 (↑ and ↓), one in n=3 (either spin); total energy = 18E\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent 74bH, round 0, identifying second excited state, thinking: To find the second excited state we look for the next‐lowest total energy configuration after the first excited (15E).  Each level n can hold up to two fermions (one per spin), with single‐particle energy n^2E.  The ground gives 10E, first excited 15E.  The next possible 4‐state combinations and their sums are:  [1,1,2,4]→22E, [1,1,3,3]→20E, [1,2,2,3]→1E+4E+4E+9E=18E.  No other legal set lies between 15E and 18E, so the second excited must be the 1,2,2,3 occupancy.  One convenient spin assignment is (n=1,↑), (n=2,↑),(n=2,↓),(n=3,↑), giving total energy 1E+4E+4E+9E=18E.; answer: Configuration: (n=1,↑), (n=2,↑), (n=2,↓), (n=3,↑); total energy = 18E\n<SEPERATOR>\nFinal Decision agent on second excited state, thinking: To find the second excited state, we list all allowed 4-particle configurations above the first excited energy (15E) that respect the Pauli exclusion principle (max two fermions per n with opposite spins). The candidates and their total energies are:\n• n = (1,2,2,3): 1²E + 2²E + 2²E + 3²E = 1E + 4E + 4E + 9E = 18E\n• n = (1,1,3,3): 1E + 1E + 9E + 9E = 20E\n• n = (1,1,2,4): 1E + 1E + 4E + 16E = 22E\nThe smallest total energy above 15E is 18E, achieved by occupying levels n=1 (one spin), n=2 (both spins), and n=3 (one spin). No other allowed configuration yields a lower energy in this range, so this is the second excited state.; answer: Configuration: (n=1, ↑), (n=2, ↑), (n=2, ↓), (n=3, ↑); total energy = 18E\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT agent 0smp, comparing energies and selecting correct answer, thinking: From Sub-tasks 4, 5, and 6 we found: ground-state energy = 10E, first excited = 15E, second excited = 18E.
