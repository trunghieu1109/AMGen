        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The question asks to identify the system and its constraints, and to define the single-particle energy levels in terms of the given unit E=(\u03c0\u00b2\u0127\u00b2)/(2mL\u00b2). Four identical spin-\u00bd particles in a 1D infinite square well must obey the well\u2019s boundary conditions, leading to quantized levels \u03c8_n(x)\u221dsin(n\u03c0x/L) and energies E_n=(n\u00b2\u03c0\u00b2\u0127\u00b2)/(2mL\u00b2). The spin-\u00bd nature gives twofold degeneracy for each spatial level but does not alter the form of E_n. Thus the single-particle energies are E_n=n\u00b2E.; answer - System: Four identical spin-1/2 particles (fermions) confined in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. Single-particle energy levels: E_n = n^2 E, with n = 1, 2, 3, \u2026 and E = (\u03c0^2 \u0127^2)/(2mL^2). Each level has a twofold spin degeneracy due to the spin-1/2.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - The infinite potential well has standing-wave solutions with quantum numbers n=1,2,3,\u2026. From Sub-task 1 the single-particle energies are E_n=(n^2\u03c0^2\u0127^2)/(2mL^2)=n^2E. Therefore the allowed n are the positive integers and the corresponding energies follow the n^2 scaling.; answer - Allowed quantum numbers: n=1,2,3,\u2026. Corresponding energies: E_1=1^2E=E, E_2=2^2E=4E, E_3=3^2E=9E, E_4=4^2E=16E, \u2026 in general E_n=n^2E.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - For spin-\u00bd fermions in a 1D infinite well, each spatial eigenstate can accommodate at most two particles (one spin-up and one spin-down) due to the Pauli exclusion principle. To minimize total energy, we fill the lowest available spatial levels. With four particles, we place two in the n=1 level (\u2191 and \u2193) and the remaining two in the n=2 level (\u2191 and \u2193). This filling assumes noninteracting particles at zero temperature, neglecting particle\u2013particle interactions, spin\u2013orbit coupling, external fields, and higher\u2010order correlations.; answer - The four spin-\u00bd fermions occupy the n=1 spatial level with both spin \u2191 and \u2193, and the n=2 spatial level with both spin \u2191 and \u2193.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - To determine the ground\u2010state configuration for four spin\u2010\u00bd fermions in a 1D infinite well, we list single\u2010particle levels labeled by (n, spin), where n=1,2,3,\u2026 and spin=\u2191,\u2193. The energy of each level is E_n = n\u00b2E. By the Pauli principle, each (n, spin) can hold at most one fermion. To minimize total energy, we fill the lowest available levels. Level n=1 (energy E) can hold two fermions (\u2191 and \u2193), and level n=2 (energy 4E) can also hold two. Placing the four particles in n=1\u2191, n=1\u2193, n=2\u2191, n=2\u2193 yields the lowest possible total energy. Any occupation of n\u22653 would increase energy. The total energy is 2\u00b7E\u2081 + 2\u00b7E\u2082 = 2\u00b7(1\u00b2E) + 2\u00b7(2\u00b2E) = 2E + 8E = 10E.; answer - Ground-state configuration: (n=1,\u2191), (n=1,\u2193), (n=2,\u2191), (n=2,\u2193); total energy = 10E.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - The ground state fills the lowest two levels (n=1 and n=2) with both spin states, giving total energy 2\u00b71\u00b2E + 2\u00b72\u00b2E = 10E. To form the first excited state, we must promote one fermion from the highest occupied single\u2010particle level (n=2) to the next available level (n=3), without violating the Pauli exclusion principle. Since each (n,spin) can be singly occupied, we remove one fermion from (n=2,\u2193) and place it in (n=3,\u2191) (the choice of spin for n=3 does not affect the energy). The occupied states become (n=1,\u2191), (n=1,\u2193), (n=2,\u2191), (n=3,\u2191). The single\u2010particle energies are 1\u00b2E, 1\u00b2E, 2\u00b2E=4E, 3\u00b2E=9E. Summing yields 1E+1E+4E+9E=15E. Hence this is the lowest excited configuration and energy.; answer - Configuration: (n=1,\u2191), (n=1,\u2193), (n=2,\u2191), (n=3,\u2191); total energy = 15E\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 6 output: thinking - To find the second excited state, we list all allowed 4-particle configurations above the first excited energy (15E) that respect the Pauli exclusion principle (max two fermions per n with opposite spins). The candidates and their total energies are:\n\u2022 n = (1,2,2,3): 1\u00b2E + 2\u00b2E + 2\u00b2E + 3\u00b2E = 1E + 4E + 4E + 9E = 18E\n\u2022 n = (1,1,3,3): 1E + 1E + 9E + 9E = 20E\n\u2022 n = (1,1,2,4): 1E + 1E + 4E + 16E = 22E\nThe smallest total energy above 15E is 18E, achieved by occupying levels n=1 (one spin), n=2 (both spins), and n=3 (one spin). No other allowed configuration yields a lower energy in this range, so this is the second excited state.; answer - Configuration: (n=1, \u2191), (n=2, \u2191), (n=2, \u2193), (n=3, \u2191); total energy = 18E\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 7 output: thinking - From Sub-tasks 4, 5, and 6 we found: ground-state energy = 10E, first excited = 15E, second excited = 18E. Comparing with the choices, only choice2 matches (10E, 15E, 18E).; answer - B)"
