Question: Example(question='Four identical spin-1/2 particles are placed in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. Calculate the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system in terms of energy  E.\n(Here E= pi^2 \\hbar^2 /2mL^2 )', choice1='4E, 10E, 50E', choice2='10E, 15E, 18E\n', choice3='4E, 10E, 15E', choice4='30E, 39E, 50E', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_5_44
proposed answer: From Sub-tasks 4, 5, and 6 we found: ground-state energy = 10E, first excited = 15E, second excited = 18E. Comparing with the choices, only choice2 matches (10E, 15E, 18E).
