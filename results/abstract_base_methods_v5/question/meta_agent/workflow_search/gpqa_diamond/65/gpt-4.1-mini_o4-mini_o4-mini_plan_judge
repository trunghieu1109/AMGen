Question: Example(question='Which of the following symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT?\n\n1. Lorentz Symmetry\n2. Poincare symmetry\n3. CP symmetry\n4. CPT symmetry', choice1='1,3,4', choice2='3,4', choice3='1,2', choice4='1,2,4', correct_index=4)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_49_65
proposed answer: SMEFT operators are constructed to be local, unitary, and Lorentz invariant, which enforces Lorentz symmetry (1), full Poincaré symmetry (2), and by the CPT theorem also CPT symmetry (4). CP symmetry (3) is not required and can be violated by higher‐dimensional operators. Among the provided options, only choice4 (‘1,2,4’) matches exactly the mandatory symmetries without including CP. Therefore the correct multiple‐choice answer is D).
