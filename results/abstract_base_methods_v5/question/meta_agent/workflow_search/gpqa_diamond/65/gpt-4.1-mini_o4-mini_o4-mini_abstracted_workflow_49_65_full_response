This enforces Poincaré invariance (which includes Lorentz transformations and spacetime translations) and, by the CPT theorem, invariance under CPT. CP symmetry is not guaranteed or required in general, since the SM already violates CP.

Such a framework guarantees invariance under the full Poincaré group (translations + Lorentz transformations) and, by the CPT theorem, invariance under CPT. CP is not a required symmetry (the SM itself violates CP in the weak sector), so SMEFT operators need not all be CP symmetric.

Lorentz Symmetry: By construction, SMEFT is a relativistic quantum field theory. All operators must transform as representations of the Lorentz group to ensure invariance under rotations and boosts in Minkowski spacetime. Violating Lorentz symmetry would break special relativity, so this is mandatory.\n\n2. Poincaré Symmetry: This extends Lorentz invariance to include spacetime translations, guaranteeing conservation of energy–momentum and angular momentum. SMEFT operators must be Poincaré invariant to maintain a consistent local relativistic field theory, so this too is mandatory.\n\n3. CP Symmetry: The Standard Model already exhibits CP violation (e.g. via the CKM matrix). Higher-dimensional operators in SMEFT may be CP-even or CP-odd depending on the physics one wishes to capture. CP invariance is not a universal requirement of SMEFT, so it is not mandatory.\n\n4. CPT Symmetry: The CPT theorem states that any local, unitary, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory must be invariant under the combined C, P, and T transformations. Since SMEFT respects locality, unitarity, and Lorentz invariance, CPT invariance is automatically guaranteed. Thus all operators must respect CPT.\n\nHence, the only symmetries that every SMEFT operator must respect are Lorentz symmetry, Poincaré symmetry, and CPT symmetry; CP symmetry need not be respected in general.; answer: 1,2,4\n<SEPERATOR>\nCritic agent 8CBi, providing feedback, thinking: The analysis correctly highlights that SMEFT operators must be Poincaré‐invariant (hence Lorentz‐invariant) and CPT‐invariant, and that CP need not hold universally. However, it has several limitations: it treats Lorentz and Poincaré symmetry as independent requirements even though Poincaré invariance automatically includes Lorentz invariance; it ignores the crucial role of gauge symmetries (SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1)) that all SMEFT operators must also respect; it assumes without stating that the theory is local and unitary (the CPT theorem’s prerequisites) and does not consider potential nonlocal or higher‐derivative effects that could evade CPT; and it omits discussion of anomaly cancellation and flavor symmetries that further constrain operator choices.; answer: 1,2,4\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent DetU, refining mandatory symmetries analysis, thinking: We examine each symmetry in turn using the theoretical basis of SMEFT:\n\n1.
