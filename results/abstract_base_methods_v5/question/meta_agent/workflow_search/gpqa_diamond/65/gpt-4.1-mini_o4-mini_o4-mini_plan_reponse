        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The user requests clear definitions of each symmetry and their relevance in the context of SMEFT. To satisfy this, I will define Lorentz, Poincar\u00e9, CP, and CPT symmetries, explain their physical meaning, and then comment on why SMEFT operators must respect them (or not). This approach addresses the sub-task fully by clarifying each symmetry before relating it back to operator construction in SMEFT.; answer - Definitions and relevance of listed symmetries in SMEFT:\n\n1. Lorentz Symmetry:\n   \u2022 Definition: Invariance of the laws of physics under continuous rotations and boosts in Minkowski spacetime. It is described mathematically by the Lorentz group SO(1,3).\n   \u2022 Relevance in SMEFT: All field operators must transform according to representations of the Lorentz group (scalars, spinors, vectors, etc.). This ensures that the effective Lagrangian respects special relativity.\n\n2. Poincar\u00e9 Symmetry:\n   \u2022 Definition: The full group of spacetime symmetries combining Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts) with translations in time and space. Mathematically, this is the inhomogeneous Lorentz group.\n   \u2022 Relevance in SMEFT: Poincar\u00e9 invariance guarantees conservation of energy\u2013momentum and angular momentum. SMEFT operators must be built to be invariant under both translations and Lorentz transformations, ensuring a consistent relativistic field theory.\n\n3. CP Symmetry:\n   \u2022 Definition: Combined operation of charge conjugation (C), which swaps particles with antiparticles, and parity (P), which inverts spatial coordinates (mirror reflection).\n   \u2022 Relevance in SMEFT: The Standard Model already violates CP in the weak sector via the CKM phase. In SMEFT, one may include higher-dimensional operators that either conserve or violate CP. CP is not a mandatory symmetry of the effective operators but is often imposed if one limits to CP-even extensions.\n\n4. CPT Symmetry:\n   \u2022 Definition: Combined operation of charge conjugation (C), parity inversion (P), and time reversal (T). The CPT theorem states that any local, Lorentz-invariant, unitary quantum field theory must be invariant under CPT.\n   \u2022 Relevance in SMEFT: CPT invariance is guaranteed by the foundational assumptions of SMEFT (locality, unitarity, Lorentz invariance). Thus all SMEFT operators must respect CPT symmetry automatically as long as the theory remains local and unitary.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - Based on Sub-task 1 definitions, SMEFT operators must respect all local Lorentz invariance and translations, i.e. full Poincar\u00e9 symmetry, as these guarantee relativistic invariance and energy\u2013momentum conservation. They must also respect CPT symmetry by the CPT theorem in any local, unitary, Lorentz-invariant QFT. CP symmetry is not mandatory since the SM already includes CP violation and the effective operators may consciously break CP. Therefore the required symmetries are 1 (Lorentz), 2 (Poincar\u00e9), and 4 (CPT), corresponding to choice 4.; answer - D)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - We examine each symmetry in turn using the theoretical basis of SMEFT:\n\n1. Lorentz Symmetry: SMEFT is built as a relativistic quantum field theory in Minkowski spacetime. Every operator must transform in a representation of the Lorentz group (spinors, vectors, scalars) to ensure invariance under rotations and boosts. Violating Lorentz symmetry would break special relativity\u2014hence it is absolutely mandatory.\n\n2. Poincar\u00e9 Symmetry: This is the full spacetime symmetry combining Lorentz transformations with translations. Invariance under translations guarantees energy\u2013momentum conservation, while Lorentz invariance guarantees consistent relativistic kinematics. A local, relativistic field theory like SMEFT must respect Poincar\u00e9 invariance by construction, so this is also mandatory (and in practice automatically enforces Lorentz invariance).\n\n3. CP Symmetry: The Standard Model already violates CP in the weak sector via the CKM matrix, and SMEFT can include higher-dimensional operators that either preserve or break CP. There is no fundamental requirement that all effective operators be CP-even, so CP symmetry is not mandatory for SMEFT.\n\n4. CPT Symmetry: The CPT theorem states that any local, unitary, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory must be invariant under the combined charge, parity, and time-reversal transformation. SMEFT satisfies the premises of the CPT theorem (locality, unitarity, Lorentz invariance), so its operators must necessarily respect CPT.\n\nTherefore, the only symmetries from the list that are strictly required for all SMEFT operators are 1 (Lorentz), 2 (Poincar\u00e9), and 4 (CPT).; answer - 1,2,4\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - SMEFT operators are constructed to be local, unitary, and Lorentz invariant, which enforces Lorentz symmetry (1), full Poincar\u00e9 symmetry (2), and by the CPT theorem also CPT symmetry (4).
