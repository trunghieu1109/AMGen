proposed answer: The final product is diethyl pentane-1,5-diyl bis(cyanoacetate), which is centrosymmetric.  Each ethyl ester end and each half of the pentamethylene bridge are equivalent.  We count distinct proton environments:
1) The two equivalent ethyl CH3 groups (–OCH2–CH3).
2) The two equivalent ethyl O–CH2 groups.
3) The two equivalent methine CH(CN) protons adjacent to both CN and COOEt.
4) The two equivalent CH2 groups α to those methines (positions 1 and 5 on the bridge).
5) The two equivalent CH2 groups β to the methines (positions 2 and 4).
6) The central CH2 (position 3) of the pentamethylene linker.
No other unique hydrogens exist under achiral conditions. Thus there are six chemically distinct 1H NMR signals.
