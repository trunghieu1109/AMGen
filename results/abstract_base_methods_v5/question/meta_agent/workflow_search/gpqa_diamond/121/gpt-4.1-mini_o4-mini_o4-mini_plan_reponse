Acetic anhydride converts the acid to an acyl species that enolizes, reacts with Br2 at the \u03b1 position, and then is hydrolyzed back to the acid. Starting from acetic acid (CH3COOH), this yields \u03b1\u2010bromated acetic acid, i.e. bromoacetic acid.; answer - Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - Product 1 is bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH). Heating a carboxylic acid with ethanol and catalytic H2SO4 drives a Fischer esterification: the \u2013COOH is converted to \u2013COOEt. Thus bromoacetic acid becomes ethyl bromoacetate.; answer - Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - Product 2 is ethyl bromoacetate (Br\u2013CH2\u2013COOEt). Treatment with NaCN leads to an SN2 reaction: the cyanide ion attacks the electrophilic CH2 bearing bromine, displacing Br\u2013. The ester group (\u2013COOEt) is not affected under these conditions, so the product is ethyl cyanoacetate.; answer - Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC\u2013CH2\u2013COOCH2CH3)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - Product 3 is ethyl cyanoacetate (NC\u2013CH2\u2013COOEt). Treatment with NaH deprotonates the active methylene (between CN and CO2Et) to give a carbanion. With excess NaH, you can form the dianion or at least two equivalents of the carbanion, which can attack both electrophilic ends of 1,5-dibromopentane. Each carbanion executes an SN2 displacement on one bromide, linking two ethyl cyanoacetate units through a pentamethylene chain. The result is a symmetrical molecule in which two NC\u2013CH\u2013COOEt fragments are joined via a \u2013(CH2)5\u2013 spacer. Thus, the final product 4 is diethyl pentane-1,5-diylbis(cyanoacetate) with the structure EtOOC\u2013CH(CN)\u2013(CH2)5\u2013CH(CN)\u2013COOEt.; answer - Diethyl pentane-1,5-diylbis(cyanoacetate), i.e. EtOOC\u2013CH(CN)\u2013(CH2)5\u2013CH(CN)\u2013COOEt.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - The final product is diethyl pentane-1,5-diyl bis(cyanoacetate), which is centrosymmetric.

        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The reaction described\u2014acetic acid treated with Br2, pyridine, and acetic anhydride under heating\u2014is a variant of the Hell\u2013Volhard\u2013Zelinsky \u03b1-bromination. First, acetic acid is converted by acetic anhydride into a mixed anhydride (acetic acid\u2013acetic anhydride equilibrium), which can enolize at the \u03b1-position. Bromine then selectively brominates the \u03b1-carbon to give the mixed anhydride of bromoacetic acid (bromoacetyl acetate). No stereocenters are created (the \u03b1-carbon of acetic acid is prochiral, but after bromination it bears two hydrogens originally, so the product center is not stereogenic). Thus product 1 is the mixed anhydride CH3CO\u2013O\u2013COCH2Br (bromoacetyl acetate), featuring an anhydride functional group and a primary alkyl bromide.; answer - CH3CO\u2013O\u2013COCH2Br (bromoacetyl acetate), the mixed anhydride of acetic acid and bromoacetic acid, containing an anhydride linkage and an \u03b1-bromo substituent.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - Product 1 is the mixed anhydride CH3CO\u2013O\u2013COCH2Br. Under acidic ethanolysis, the anhydride selectively reacts with ethanol to form the corresponding ester at the bromoacetyl site, since the more electrophilic carbonyl (adjacent to the bromine) is attacked preferentially. This yields ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOEt) along with acetic acid as a by-product. No stereochemistry is introduced since the carbon bearing bromine is not chiral.; answer - ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOEt)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - Product 2 is ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOEt). Treating this with NaCN will undergo an SN2 displacement of the bromide by cyanide. The bromomethylene group (\u2013CH2Br) is replaced by \u2013CH2CN, giving ethyl cyanoacetate. There is no new stereocenter, and the reaction proceeds cleanly under typical SN2 conditions.; answer - Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOEt)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - Product 3 is ethyl cyanoacetate (NC\u2013CH2\u2013COOEt). Deprotonation with NaH generates the \u03b1-carbanion, which attacks both ends of 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 fashion, linking two cyanoacetate units by a pentamethylene bridge. The resulting molecule has two new stereocenters at the former CH2 positions (now CH\u2013), each bearing \u2013CN, \u2013COOEt, and the bridging \u2013(CH2)5\u2013 substituent. Because the two halves are identical and connected by an odd-numbered chain, there are two types of stereoisomers: the achiral meso form (R,S), possessing an internal mirror plane, and the enantiomeric pair (R,R)/(S,S), which together form a racemate. Under intermolecular alkylation conditions, both meso and racemic products are formed.; answer - Diethyl 2,2\u2032-(pentane-1,5-diyl)bis(cyanoacetate), NC\u2013CH(COOEt)\u2013(CH2)5\u2013CH(COOEt)\u2013CN, with two new stereocenters. It exists as the achiral meso (R,S) isomer and the enantiomeric (R,R)/(S,S) racemate.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4b output: thinking - To assign stereochemistry at each CH(CN) stereocenter, we apply the Cahn\u2013Ingold\u2013Prelog rules. At each stereocenter the four substituents are \u2013CN (highest priority, 1), \u2013COOEt (via the carbonyl carbon, priority 2), the pentamethylene bridge carbon (priority 3), and hydrogen (priority 4). In the connected diester, one stereocenter viewed along the C\u2013H bond gives the three substituents in the order 1\u21922\u21923 rotating clockwise, corresponding to R configuration, while the other stereocenter gives a counter\u2010clockwise sequence, S. This combination (R,S) places each substituent in equivalent but mirrored positions, and the molecule as a whole possesses an internal mirror plane bisecting the pentamethylene chain\u2014hence it is the achiral meso form. By contrast, alkylation can also give the enantiomeric pair (R,R) and (S,S); these lack an internal mirror plane and exist as a racemic mixture.; answer - The meso isomer is (2R,2\u2032S) (equivalently (2S,2\u2032R)), achiral due to an internal mirror plane. The alternative products are the enantiomeric pair (2R,2\u2032R) and (2S,2\u2032S), which together constitute a racemic mixture.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - In product 4 (the meso cycloheptane diester\u2013dinitrile), there is an internal mirror plane, but the two stereocenters make the two protons on each of the chain methylenes \u03b1 (C1/C5) and \u03b2 (C2/C4) diastereotopic (they are not interchanged by any symmetry element within a given CH2). The central CH2 (C3) lies in the symmetry plane, so its two protons are enantiotopic (and thus equivalent). The two ethyl ester groups are related by the mirror and give one CH3 and one CH2 environment. Finally, the two stereocenter CH\u2013H are enantiotopic under the mirror and give one signal. Counting signals: 1 CH3, 1 O\u2013CH2, 1 CH (\u03b1), 1 CH2 at C3, 2 distinct H on C1/C5 (diastereotopic), 2 distinct H on C2/C4 (diastereotopic) \u2192 8 signals total.; answer - D) 8\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 6 output: thinking - In product 4 (a meso cycloheptane diester\u2013dinitrile with a mirror plane), the proton environments are: 1) the two ethyl CH3 groups give one signal; 2) the two ethyl O\u2013CH2 groups give one signal; 3) the two stereocenter CH\u2013H protons are enantiotopic under the mirror and give one signal; 4) the central CH2 (C3) protons are enantiotopic and give one signal; 5) the two CH2 at positions C1/C5 are each diastereotopic, but C1 and C5 pairs are related by the mirror, giving two distinct signals; 6) the two CH2 at positions C2/C4 likewise give two signals. Total distinct 1H NMR signals = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 8.; answer - 8\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 7 output: thinking - The NMR analysis yielded 8 chemically distinct proton signals for product 4.
