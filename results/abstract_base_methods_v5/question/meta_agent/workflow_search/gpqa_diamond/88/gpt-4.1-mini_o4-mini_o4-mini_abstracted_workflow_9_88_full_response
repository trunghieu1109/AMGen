This proton couples to two sets of two nonequivalent cage protons with two distinct 3J values.

That α‐proton couples to two nonequivalent sets of two cage methylene protons: one set on the bridgehead carbon next to the OH and one on the bridgehead next to the ketone. Each set has a distinct three‐bond coupling constant, so the α‐proton is split into a triplet by one set and each line of that triplet is further split into a triplet by the other set. Hence the pattern is a triplet of triplets.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent Cy1n:\nThe most deshielded non‐exchangeable proton in product 3 is the α‐CH adjacent to both the hydroxyl and the ketone, which resonates most downfield (~4.1–4.4\u2009ppm). This proton couples to two distinct sets of two adjacent cage hydrogens with two different 3J values. Each set of two equivalent protons splits the α‐CH into a triplet, and the two nonequivalent triplets give an overall triplet of triplets.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent Kl5g:\nThe most deshielded non-exchangeable proton in product 3 is the α-CH adjacent to both the newly formed keto and hydroxy groups. This proton couples to two distinct sets of two equivalent cage protons on either side, each with its own 3J coupling constant. As a result, its signal is split first into a triplet by one set of two protons and then each line of that triplet is further split into a triplet by the other set.

Heating this enone with excess Al(O-iPr)₃ under Meerwein–Ponndorf–Verley conditions (isopropanol/Al(O-iPr)₃) will chemoselectively reduce the C=O to the allylic alcohol without touching the C=C. Al(O-iPr)₃ serves as both Lewis acid to activate the carbonyl and hydride source via transfer from isopropoxide ligands. Thus, product 2 is the corresponding allylic alcohol (exo-methylene adamantan-2-ol). Spectrally, the strong C=O stretch at 1720 cm⁻¹ disappears and is replaced by a broad O–H stretch around 3300 cm⁻¹; the exocyclic =CH₂ protons remain as a singlet near δ 4.79 (2H); a new multiplet/ddd appears around δ 4.1 for the CH–OH; a broad signal around δ 2.4 is the OH; and the remaining cage protons appear between δ 1.8–2.3.; answer - Product 2 is the allylic alcohol derived from MPV reduction of the enone (exo-methylene adamantan-2-ol); its IR shows loss of the C=O band and appearance of an O–H stretch at ~3300 cm⁻¹, and its ¹H NMR features δ 4.79 (2H, s, exo-CH₂), δ 4.1 (1H, ddd, CH–OH), δ 2.4 (1H, br s, OH) and δ 1.8–2.3 (m, cage protons).\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - Ozonolysis of the exo-methylene in product 2 cleaves the C=C bond, giving formaldehyde (from the CH₂ fragment) and converting the exo-methylene carbon of the cage into a keto carbon. The allylic OH on the adjacent carbon is untouched. The result is therefore an α-hydroxy ketone on the adamantane framework (often drawn as 2-oxo-3-hydroxyadamantane). IR will show a strong C=O stretch ~1720 cm⁻¹ plus a broad O–H stretch ~3300 cm⁻¹. In the ¹H NMR the non-exchangeable protons on the OH-bearing carbon (the α-CH) are the most deshielded (δ ~4.1–4.4 ppm) and appear as a triplet of triplets, due to coupling to two sets of two nonequivalent cage protons (two different ³J values).

It features a C=O (IR ~1720 cm⁻¹), a free OH (~3300 cm⁻¹), and in the ¹H NMR the α-CH–OH resonates at δ ~4.2 ppm as a triplet of triplets (coupling to two sets of two cage protons).\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - The most downfield non-exchangeable proton in product 3 is the α-CH adjacent to both the hydroxyl and the ketone, appearing around δ 4.1–4.4 ppm.

In other words, product 2 is the internal enone isomer of the exo‐methylene adamantanone.  Spectroscopically, the IR still shows a strong C=O band (shifted slightly to ca. 1685 cm⁻¹) and now also a C=C stretch around 1640 cm⁻¹.  In the ¹H NMR the exomethylene singlet at 4.79 ppm is gone and replaced by two vinylic signals: one at ≈6.3 ppm (d, J≈10 Hz, 1H, Hα) and one at ≈5.9 ppm (d, J≈10 Hz, 1H, Hβ).  The β‐methine (adjacent to both C=O and C=C) appears as a multiplet near 3.0–3.2 ppm, and the remaining adamantane cage protons resonate as multiplets between ca. 2.4 and 1.8 ppm.; answer: Product 2 is the endocyclic α,β-unsaturated ketone (internal enone) resulting from Al(OiPr)₃-catalyzed migration of the exocyclic C=C into the cage.  IR: C=O at ~1685 cm⁻¹, C=C at ~1640 cm⁻¹.  ¹H NMR: δ 6.3 (d, J≈10 Hz, 1H, Hα), δ 5.9 (d, J≈10 Hz, 1H, Hβ), δ 3.0–3.2 (m, 1H, β-methine), remaining cage protons at δ 2.4–1.8.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent cYgt, determining product 2, thinking: Product 1 is an exocyclic α,β-unsaturated ketone on the adamantane cage (an exo-methylene adamantanone). Aluminum isopropoxide is known to catalyze double-bond isomerization in α,β-unsaturated ketones (akin to Oppenauer/Merz reactions in reverse) by coordinating to the carbonyl and facilitating migration of the C=C from an exocyclic position into conjugation inside the ring. Under heat, the exocyclic =CH₂ group in 1 shifts to give an endocyclic α,β-unsaturated ketone (product 2) with the double bond now within the cage system.  Spectrally, the exo-methylene signals at δ 4.79 disappear, and two new vinylic proton signals appear downfield (δ ~5.8–6.2\u2005ppm, each a doublet or doublet of doublets with J≈10–12\u2005Hz for the cis-coupling), while the IR C=O stretch shifts slightly lower to ~1665–1680\u2005cm⁻¹ with an additional C=C band at ~1635\u2005cm⁻¹. The remaining cage methine/methylene protons shift modestly (δ 2.3–2.6\u2005ppm) but retain their multiplet pattern.; answer: Product 2 is the endocyclic α,β-unsaturated adamantanone (double bond migrated inside the cage). Key spectral changes: IR ν(C=O) at ~1665–1680 cm⁻¹ with a C=C band at ~1635 cm⁻¹; ¹H NMR loss of exo-methylene signals, appearance of two vinylic protons at δ ~5.8–6.2 ppm (each a doublet or doublet of doublets, J ≈10–12 Hz), and shifted cage proton multiplets at δ ~2.3–2.6 ppm.\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent 7EBV, identifying product 3, thinking: Ozonolysis of the exo-methylene in 2 cleaves the C=C to give a ketone at C2 (and formaldehyde from the terminal CH2), while the original allylic OH remains on C2, which now bears the new C=O. The resulting fragment has no H at C2, so the most downfield proton is one on the tertiary cage carbon (C1 or C3) alpha to the ketone. That H is vicinal to the four hydrogens on the two adjacent secondary carbons, which are split into two magnetically distinct sets with two different 3J values. Coupling first to two equivalent H at J1 gives a triplet, then to the other two at J2 gives another triplet, resulting in a triplet of triplets.; answer: B)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCritic agent TR8Z, providing feedback, thinking: The proposed structure for product 3—a bicyclic γ-hydroxyketone resulting from ozonolysis of the exo-methylene—matches the IR (carbonyl at 1720 cm⁻¹) and the most downfield 1H NMR signal. However, this assignment rests largely on analogy rather than direct evidence. Key limitations are: 1) No 13C or HSQC data to confirm the new ketone carbon. 2) The hydroxyl proton may exchange or overlap, obscuring its position. 3) Stereochemical outcome at the ring juncture is not established. 4) Possible over-oxidation to di- or tri-carbonyl species cannot be ruled out without mass spectrometry. 5) Coupling constants alone may be ambiguous in a rigid adamantane system.; answer: While the γ-hydroxyketone structure is reasonable, its confirmation requires complementary data (13C NMR, COSY/HSQC correlations, HRMS) to rule out alternative ozonolysis products or stereoisomers.\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent 7EBV, refining product 3 identification, thinking: Ozonolysis of the exo-methylene in product 2 cleaves the C=C bond, giving formaldehyde (from the CH₂ fragment) and converting the exo-methylene carbon of the cage into a keto carbon.
