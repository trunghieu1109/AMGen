Question: Example(question='1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated to 240C with an excess of KOH, creating a light yellow solid product 1, With 1H nmr spectrum: 4.79(2H), 2.41-2.23(10H), 1.94(2H) and a characteristic absorbance in the IR spectrum at 1720cm-1.\n\nThis product was then heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide, forming product 2.\n\nozone was bubbled through a solution of 2 at -78C, followed by addition of dimethylsulfide, forming product 3.\n\nin the 1H nmr spectrum of 3, what is the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom (excluding those that will exchange with deuterated solvent)?', choice1='doublet of triplets', choice2='triplet of triplets', choice3='pentet', choice4='triplet', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: The most downfield non-exchangeable proton in product 3 is the α-CH adjacent to both the hydroxyl and the ketone, appearing around δ 4.1–4.4 ppm. This proton is coupled to two distinct sets of two equivalent cage methylene protons (one set next to the OH, one set next to the carbonyl), each with a different three-bond coupling constant. One set splits the α-CH into a triplet, and the second set further splits each line of that triplet into another triplet, resulting in an overall triplet of triplets.
