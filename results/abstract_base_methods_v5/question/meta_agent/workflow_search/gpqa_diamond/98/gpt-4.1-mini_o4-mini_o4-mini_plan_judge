Question: Example(question='You have prepared an unknown compound. To identify the product, you have used the following characterisation techniques: FTIR and 1H NMR. The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers. A strong absorption peak is also observed at 1700 wavenumbers. Several peaks were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum, none of which are correspond to vinyl-hydrogens. One of the signals in the 1H NMR is a doublet of triplets of quartets whilst a different signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Identify the compound as either, CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH, CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH, CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH, or CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH', choice1='CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH', choice2='CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH', choice3='CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH', choice4='CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: The broad 3000 cm⁻¹ O–H and strong 1700 cm⁻¹ C=O absorptions confirm a terminal carboxylic acid. The ¹H NMR multiplets (a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets) require two adjacent methine protons, each coupling to three distinct sets of neighbors: one methyl group and one ethyl group plus the adjacent methine. Among the four candidates, only CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (choice B) has two adjacent stereocenters each bearing one methyl and one ethyl substituent and terminates in COOH. The other structures either lack the correct methyl/ethyl substitution pattern or place the acid on a CH₂, which would yield different splitting patterns.

proposed answer: The FTIR shows a broad 3000 cm⁻¹ O–H stretch and a strong 1700 cm⁻¹ C=O stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid. The ¹H NMR displays two highly complex multiplets—a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets—implying two inequivalent methine protons (each coupling to a methyl, a CH₂, and one another). Only CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH has two adjacent methines bearing methyl substituents and a CH₂ directly next to the COOH, giving the observed high‐order splitting. Structures with ethyl substituents would introduce extra CH₂ signals and simpler splitting patterns. Hence, the correct choice is A).
