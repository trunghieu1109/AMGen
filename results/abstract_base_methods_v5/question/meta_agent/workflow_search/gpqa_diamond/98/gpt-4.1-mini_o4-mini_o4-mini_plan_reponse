The dtt arises from the adjacent CH that couples to a CH3 (doublet), to the same CH2 (triplet) and to the other methine proton (triplet).

Typical vicinal anti couplings (12\u201313 Hz) occur between two methine protons; vicinal gauche couplings to CH2 groups give J\u22486\u20137 Hz; smaller long-range or dihedral couplings to methyl groups or more remote CH2\u2019s are ~3\u20134 Hz. Thus the dtq must be a methine proton (H_A) coupled strongly (12 Hz) to the other methine (H_B), moderately (6 Hz) to one CH2 (the ethyl side chain), and weakly (3 Hz) to a methyl on that same carbon.

The \u00b9H NMR reveals two adjacent methine protons: each exhibits a large anti\u2010vicinal coupling (~12\u201313 Hz) to the other methine, a medium vicinal coupling (~6\u20137 Hz) to a CH\u2082 group, and a smaller long\u2010range coupling (~3\u20134 Hz) to a methyl group, giving dtq and dtt patterns. This pattern requires each methine carbon to bear one CH\u2083 and one CH\u2082 substituent. Among the plausible isomers from subtask 2c, only the 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid skeleton (CH\u2083\u2013C(H)(CH\u2083)\u2013C(H)(CH\u2083)\u2013CH\u2082\u2013COOH) satisfies these couplings without introducing extra CH\u2082\u2013CH\u2083 couplings or inequivalent environments. While other alkylated pentanoic acids could in principle mimic parts of the pattern, the precise J-values and symmetry of two identical methyl\u2010bearing methines strongly favor CH\u2083C(H)(CH\u2083)C(H)(CH\u2083)CH\u2082COOH. Uncertainties remain due to potential overlapping multiplets, small J\u2010value variations, and COOH exchange broadening; 2D NMR or MS would help confirm the assignment.; answer - CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - Cross\u2010validation shows that only CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH fits the observed NMR splitting patterns (one dtq and one dtt from two adjacent methines each coupling strongly to each other, moderately to a CH2\u2013COOH, and weakly to a methyl) and the FTIR data (broad O\u2013H, strong C=O). The other candidates either place the COOH at the wrong position, introduce ethyl substituents (which would give extra CH2 and CH3 signals and different coupling constants), or lack the necessary small ~3\u2009Hz coupling to a methyl.

The two high\u2010order proton signals (dtq and dtt) demand two vicinal methines each with a large mutual J (~10\u201315 Hz), a medium J (~5\u20138 Hz) to a CH2\u2013COOH, and a small J (~1\u20133 Hz) to a methyl\u2014features only met by CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH. All other candidates either introduce extra ethyl-CH2/CH3 resonances or fail to generate both observed multiplet complexities. Potential ambiguities (e.g. overlapping small couplings, solvent effects) are unlikely to hide additional methyl or CH2 signals entirely. Thus, even allowing for minor J-value uncertainty, the data uniquely support choice C.
