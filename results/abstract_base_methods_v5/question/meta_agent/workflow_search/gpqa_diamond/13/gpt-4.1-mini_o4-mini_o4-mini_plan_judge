Question: Example(question='ChIP-seq on a PFA-fixed sample with an antibody to the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells followed by next-generation sequencing and standard quality control, alignment and peak-calling steps produced ChIP peaks that disappeared when PFA+DSG fixation was used. Where are we most likely to find such disappearing peaks?', choice1='At active promoters and enhancers', choice2='At repeats', choice3='In the introns of large genes', choice4='At random locations in the genome', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_13
proposed answer: The addition of DSG introduces amine-to-amine crosslinks that reinforce multiprotein complexes. IKAROS sites relying on indirect interactions with cofactors—common at active promoters and enhancers—become masked and fail to be efficiently sonicated and immunoprecipitated after PFA+DSG fixation. In contrast, direct, strong DNA contacts remain detectable. Repeats, introns of large genes, and random genomic loci lack these cofactor-mediated assemblies and are not selectively lost. Therefore, disappearing peaks upon switching to PFA+DSG are found at active promoters and enhancers.
