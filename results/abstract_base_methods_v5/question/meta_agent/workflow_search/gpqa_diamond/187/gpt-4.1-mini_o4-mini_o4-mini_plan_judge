Question: Example(question='Consider a rhombohedral crystal, with the interatomic distance of 10 Angstrom and the angles $\\quad\\alpha=\\beta=\\gamma=30^{0}$. What is the interplanar distance of the (111) plane of the crystal?\n', choice1='9.54 Angstrom', choice2='8.95 Angstrom', choice3='9.08 Angstrom', choice4='10.05 Angstrom', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_37_187
proposed answer: The computed interplanar distance is approximately 9.54 Å, which matches choice1 (9.54 Å) exactly. The other options (8.95 Å, 9.08 Å, 10.05 Å) differ by 0.59 Å, 0.46 Å, and 0.51 Å respectively, so choice1 is the closest.
