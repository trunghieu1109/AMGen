Question: Example(question='A spin-half particle is in a linear superposition 0.5|\\uparrow\\rangle+sqrt(3)/2|\\downarrow\\rangle of its spin-up and spin-down states. If |\\uparrow\\rangle and |\\downarrow\\rangle are the eigenstates of \\sigma{z} , then what is the expectation value up to one decimal place, of the operator 10\\sigma{z}+5\\sigma_{x} ? Here, symbols have their usual meanings', choice1='0.85', choice2='1.65', choice3='-1.4', choice4='-0.7', correct_index=4)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_2
proposed answer: From Sub-task 3 we found ⟨ψ|(10σ_z+5σ_x)|ψ⟩ = −5 + 2.5√3 ≈ −0.67. Rounding to one decimal place gives −0.7, which corresponds to choice D.
