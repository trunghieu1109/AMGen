Question: Example(question='Which of the following (effective) particles is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry?', choice1='Magnon', choice2='Skyrmion', choice3='Pion', choice4='Phonon', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_188
proposed answer: The only particle among the choices not arising as a Goldstone boson from spontaneously broken continuous symmetry is the skyrmion, which is a topological soliton rather than a symmetry-breaking mode. In the original list A) Magnon, B) Skyrmion, C) Pion, D) Phonon, the skyrmion corresponds to choice B).

Answer:B)
Extracted answer: B)
Correct answer: 2
