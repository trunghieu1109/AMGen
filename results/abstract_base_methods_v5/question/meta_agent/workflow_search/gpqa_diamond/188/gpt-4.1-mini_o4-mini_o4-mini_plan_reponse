        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The user asks for a clear definition of spontaneously-broken symmetry in the context of effective particles and what it means for a particle to be associated with such a symmetry. I will explain that spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs when the underlying laws are symmetric but the ground state is not, leading to emergent low-energy excitations (Goldstone modes) which we interpret as effective particles. I will clarify the criteria for association: the particle must emerge as a gapless mode tied to a broken continuous symmetry generator.; answer - Spontaneously-broken symmetry occurs when the fundamental equations (Hamiltonian or Lagrangian) are invariant under some continuous transformation, but the system\u2019s ground state (vacuum or ordered phase) chooses a configuration that does not share that full symmetry. In this situation, the symmetry is hidden or \u201cbroken\u201d by the choice of ground state rather than by the laws themselves. A particle is said to be associated with such a symmetry if it appears as a low-energy excitation (often gapless) directly tied to one of the broken continuous symmetry generators; these excitations are called Goldstone modes. In short, an effective particle is associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry if it emerges as a gapless collective mode resulting from the mismatch between the symmetry of the laws and that of the chosen ground state.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - I need to give concise descriptions of the four effective particles\u2014magnon, skyrmion, pion, phonon\u2014stating their physical context, their origin in terms of symmetries (broken or otherwise), and how they arise as collective modes or excitations in their respective systems. I will tie each back to the definition of spontaneously broken continuous symmetry (Goldstone modes) when applicable, and highlight that skyrmions are topological solitons rather than Goldstone bosons.; answer - Magnon: A spin-wave excitation in a ferromagnet or antiferromagnet. It arises when the continuous spin-rotation symmetry of the magnetic Hamiltonian is spontaneously broken by the ordered ground state; magnons are the gapless Goldstone modes corresponding to small collective twists of the spin order.\n\nSkyrmion: A topologically protected, localized spin texture (soliton) in a magnetic material. It does not emerge as a Goldstone boson of any broken continuous symmetry but instead is a stable particle-like excitation due to the topology of the order parameter field (nontrivial mapping of the spin configuration onto a sphere).\n\nPion: A pseudoscalar meson in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Pions arise as (approximate) Goldstone bosons of the spontaneously broken chiral symmetry SU(2)_L\u00d7SU(2)_R\u2192SU(2)_{isospin} in the QCD vacuum, acquiring a small mass because the symmetry is only approximate (explicitly broken by quark masses).\n\nPhonon: A quantized lattice vibration in a crystalline solid. It appears because the continuous translational symmetry of free space is spontaneously broken by the discrete periodic arrangement of atoms; acoustic phonons are the gapless Goldstone modes corresponding to long-wavelength distortions of the crystal lattice.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - Magnons arise as gapless spin\u2010wave excitations (Goldstone modes) because a ferromagnet\u2019s continuous spin\u2010rotation symmetry is spontaneously broken by its ordered ground state. Pions are (approximate) Goldstone bosons of the spontaneously broken chiral SU(2)_L\u00d7SU(2)_R symmetry in QCD, gaining a small mass only through explicit quark\u2010mass terms. Phonons, specifically acoustic phonons, appear as Goldstone modes from the spontaneous breaking of continuous translational symmetry when atoms form a discrete lattice. By contrast, skyrmions are topologically protected solitons stabilized by nontrivial field\u2010configuration topology, not by a broken continuous symmetry generator. Therefore, the particles associated with spontaneously broken symmetries are magnons, pions, and phonons.; answer - Magnon, Pion, Phonon\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - From Sub-task 3 we see that magnons, pions, and phonons all arise as Goldstone modes due to spontaneous breaking of continuous symmetries (spin\u2010rotation for magnons, chiral SU(2)_L\u00d7SU(2)_R for pions, and translational invariance for phonons). Skyrmions, however, are stable topological solitons whose existence relies on nontrivial field topology rather than the breaking of a continuous symmetry generator. Thus the one not associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking is the skyrmion.; answer - Skyrmion\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - The only particle among the choices not arising as a Goldstone boson from spontaneously broken continuous symmetry is the skyrmion, which is a topological soliton rather than a symmetry-breaking mode. In the original list A) Magnon, B) Skyrmion, C) Pion, D) Phonon, the skyrmion corresponds to choice B).; answer - B)"
