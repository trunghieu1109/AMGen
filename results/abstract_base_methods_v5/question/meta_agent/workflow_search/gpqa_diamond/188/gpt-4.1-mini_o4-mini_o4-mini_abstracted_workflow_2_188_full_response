I will explain that spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs when the underlying laws are symmetric but the ground state is not, leading to emergent low-energy excitations (Goldstone modes) which we interpret as effective particles. I will clarify the criteria for association: the particle must emerge as a gapless mode tied to a broken continuous symmetry generator.; answer - Spontaneously-broken symmetry occurs when the fundamental equations (Hamiltonian or Lagrangian) are invariant under some continuous transformation, but the system’s ground state (vacuum or ordered phase) chooses a configuration that does not share that full symmetry. In this situation, the symmetry is hidden or “broken” by the choice of ground state rather than by the laws themselves. A particle is said to be associated with such a symmetry if it appears as a low-energy excitation (often gapless) directly tied to one of the broken continuous symmetry generators; these excitations are called Goldstone modes.

It appears because the continuous translational symmetry of free space is spontaneously broken by the discrete periodic arrangement of atoms; acoustic phonons are the gapless Goldstone modes corresponding to long-wavelength distortions of the crystal lattice.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent cp3o, describing effective particles, thinking: To address Sub-task 2, I will go through each effective particle—magnon, skyrmion, pion, phonon—and describe (1) the physical system in which it appears, (2) the symmetry context, and (3) how the excitation or object emerges. I will tie each description back to the idea of spontaneous symmetry breaking and Goldstone modes where applicable, making clear the origin of each effective particle.; answer: Magnon: In a ferromagnet or antiferromagnet, the spins of electrons align in an ordered ground state, breaking the continuous spin‐rotation symmetry of the underlying Hamiltonian. Small transverse oscillations of the local spin orientation propagate as collective, gapless spin waves. Each quantum of this spin wave is called a magnon, the Goldstone boson associated with the broken continuous SU(2) spin‐rotation symmetry.\n\nSkyrmion: In certain chiral magnets or in quantum Hall ferromagnets, the order parameter (local spin or pseudospin orientation) can wrap nontrivially around a sphere in real space, forming a topologically stable spin texture. A skyrmion is not a gapless Goldstone mode but rather a localized, particle‐like soliton whose stability is protected by a topological charge. It arises from the competition of exchange, Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya, and other interactions in a broken-symmetry magnetic background.\n\nPion: In quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the approximate chiral symmetry SU(2)_L × SU(2)_R of the light‐quark sector is spontaneously broken down to the vector subgroup SU(2)_V in the vacuum. The three Goldstone bosons of this breaking acquire a small mass from explicit symmetry breaking by the quark masses and are identified as the pions (π⁺, π⁰, π⁻). They are pseudoscalar mesons whose low-energy interactions reflect their origin as (pseudo-)Goldstone modes of chiral symmetry breaking.\n\nPhonon: In a crystalline solid, the continuous translational symmetry of free space is spontaneously broken when atoms settle into a periodic lattice. The low-energy, long-wavelength vibrations of the lattice—collective displacements of atoms around their equilibrium positions—propagate as acoustic waves. Quanta of these lattice vibrations are phonons, the Goldstone modes associated with the broken continuous translational symmetry.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent XFJ8, describing effective particles, thinking: To answer sub-task 2, I need to identify for each listed effective particle the broken symmetry (if any), the physical system in which it appears, and how it emerges. I will briefly explain the context (magnetic order, crystal lattice, QCD vacuum, etc.), state which continuous symmetry is broken (spin rotations, translations, chiral rotations), and indicate whether the excitation is a Goldstone mode or a topological soliton. This provides a clear mapping from the definition of spontaneously broken symmetry to each particle’s origin.; answer: Magnon: In a ferromagnet or antiferromagnet, the ground state breaks continuous spin‐rotation symmetry (SU(2)→U(1)). Small collective tilts of the ordered spins propagate as quantized spin waves. These gapless excitations are Goldstone modes of the broken spin‐rotation symmetry.  \n\nSkyrmion: In certain chiral magnets or quantum Hall ferromagnets, one finds topologically nontrivial, localized spin textures—solitons—characterized by an integer winding number. Skyrmions are not Goldstone modes of a broken continuous symmetry but rather stable excitations protected by topology (homotopy of the order‐parameter field).  \n\nPion: In quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the approximate chiral symmetry SU(2)_L×SU(2)_R of light quarks is spontaneously broken to isospin SU(2)_V in the vacuum. The resulting nearly massless pseudoscalar mesons (π^+, π^0, π^–) are pseudo-Goldstone bosons of this broken chiral symmetry (their small mass arises from explicit breaking by nonzero quark masses).  \n\nPhonon: In a crystal, continuous spatial translation symmetry is broken down to the discrete lattice translations. The low-energy collective vibrations of atoms around their equilibrium positions are quantized as phonons. These gapless sound modes are Goldstone bosons associated with the broken continuous translational invariance.\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent JdjN, determining particles associated with spontaneously-broken symmetries, thinking: Magnons arise as gapless spin‐wave (Goldstone) modes due to the spontaneous breaking of continuous spin‐rotation symmetry in magnetic order. Pions are the (approximate) Goldstone bosons of the spontaneously broken chiral SU(2)_L×SU(2)_R symmetry in QCD. Phonons are acoustic Goldstone modes from the spontaneous breaking of continuous translational symmetry in a crystal lattice. Skyrmions, by contrast, are topological solitons stabilized by nontrivial field configurations, not by a broken continuous symmetry generator. Therefore, the effective particles associated with spontaneously broken symmetries are magnons, pions, and phonons.; answer: Magnon, Pion, Phonon\n<SEPERATOR>\nCritic agent kz61, providing feedback, thinking: The identification correctly recognizes magnons, pions, and phonons as (approximate) Goldstone modes arising from spontaneous breaking of spin‐rotation, chiral, and translational symmetries, respectively, and singles out skyrmions as non‐Goldstone topological solitons. However, this classification has limitations: pions are only pseudo‐Goldstone bosons due to explicit chiral symmetry breaking by quark masses; real magnets exhibit anisotropies that gap the magnon spectrum; phonons in crystals emerge from discrete rather than truly continuous translational symmetry and acquire Umklapp processes at finite momentum; and emergent symmetries in condensed matter can behave differently from fundamental ones.; answer: Magnons, pions, and phonons are associated with spontaneously-broken symmetries (though pions are pseudo-Goldstone bosons), while skyrmions are topological solitons, not Goldstone modes.\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent JdjN, refining identification, thinking: Magnons arise as gapless spin‐wave excitations (Goldstone modes) because a ferromagnet’s continuous spin‐rotation symmetry is spontaneously broken by its ordered ground state. Pions are (approximate) Goldstone bosons of the spontaneously broken chiral SU(2)_L×SU(2)_R symmetry in QCD, gaining a small mass only through explicit quark‐mass terms. Phonons, specifically acoustic phonons, appear as Goldstone modes from the spontaneous breaking of continuous translational symmetry when atoms form a discrete lattice.
