proposed answer: The Hamiltonian H = ε σ·n has eigenvalues given by ε times the eigenvalues of σ·n. Since σ·n has eigenvalues +1 and −1, H has eigenvalues +ε and −ε. Among the provided choices, choice1 is '+ε, −ε', which exactly matches our derived values. The other options either include unnecessary factors of ℏ or give incorrect numerical values. Therefore, the correct choice is A).
