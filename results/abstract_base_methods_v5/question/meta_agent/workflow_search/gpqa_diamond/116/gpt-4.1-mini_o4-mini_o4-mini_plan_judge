Question: Example(question="Compounds that have the same molecular formula but are different in their structural arrangement are known as isomers. Isomers have two types, constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but differ in their structures. In stereoisomers, molecules are connected in the same way, but their arrangements in space are different.\nWhich of the following organic moieties show optical isomerism?\n\n1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate\n2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n3. benzophenone\n4. dimethyl fumarate", choice1='2 and 3', choice2='1 and 2', choice3='3 and 4', choice4='1, 2 and 4', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_49_116
proposed answer: Optical isomerism requires either a stereogenic center or restricted rotation (axial chirality). Compound 1 (dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate) is axially chiral due to ortho-substituted biphenyl that restricts rotation and yields non-superimposable atropisomers. Compound 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) has a stereogenic carbon bearing four different substituents (–OH, –H, –CH3, –COOCH3). Compounds 3 (benzophenone) and 4 (dimethyl fumarate) lack stereocenters or axial chirality and are achiral. Thus only 1 and 2 show optical isomerism, which corresponds to choice B).
