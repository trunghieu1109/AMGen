            "Compounds that have the same molecular formula but are different in their structural arrangement are known as isomers. Isomers have two types, constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but differ in their structures. In stereoisomers, molecules are connected in the same way, but their arrangements in space are different.\nWhich of the following organic moieties show optical isomerism?\n\n1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate\n2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n3. benzophenone\n4. dimethyl fumarate",

        "response": "Optical isomerism requires either a stereogenic center or restricted rotation (axial chirality). Compound 1 (dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate) is axially chiral due to ortho-substituted biphenyl that restricts rotation and yields non-superimposable atropisomers. Compound 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) has a stereogenic carbon bearing four different substituents (\u2013OH, \u2013H, \u2013CH3, \u2013COOCH3). Compounds 3 (benzophenone) and 4 (dimethyl fumarate) lack stereocenters or axial chirality and are achiral. Thus only 1 and 2 show optical isomerism, which corresponds to choice B).\n\nAnswer:B)",
        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - Optical isomerism arises when a molecule and its mirror image are non-superimposable, giving rise to enantiomers that rotate plane-polarized light in opposite directions. The key structural requirement is at least one stereogenic (chiral) center\u2014commonly a carbon atom bonded to four different substituents\u2014so that there is no internal mirror plane. Other forms of chirality (axial, planar, helical) also qualify when the overall three-dimensional arrangement lacks an inversion center or reflection symmetry. Without such asymmetry (e.g. a carbon with two identical substituents), a molecule cannot exist as two optically active enantiomers.; answer - Optical isomerism is the phenomenon whereby molecules that are non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers) rotate plane-polarized light in opposite directions. The necessary structural feature is at least one stereogenic (chiral) center\u2014typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups\u2014resulting in no internal plane of symmetry and thus in two distinct enantiomeric forms.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - Optical isomerism requires a molecule to be non-superimposable on its mirror image, which arises either from (a) a stereogenic (chiral) center\u2014a carbon bearing four different substituents\u2014or (b) a geometrically restricted arrangement lacking an internal mirror plane (e.g. atropisomerism in hindered biphenyls).\n\n1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate: Substituents at both 2,2' and 6,6' positions lock the biphenyl rings in a twisted conformation, creating axial chirality. This gives two enantiomeric atropisomers.\n\n2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (methyl lactate): The central carbon is bonded to \u2013OH, \u2013H, \u2013CH3, and \u2013COOCH3\u2014four different groups\u2014making it a stereogenic center and giving rise to enantiomers.\n\n3. Benzophenone (diphenyl ketone): The carbonyl carbon is sp2 and there are no stereogenic centers or restricted axes of chirality; it is achiral.\n\n4. Dimethyl fumarate (trans-but-2-enedioate dimethyl ester): An E-alkene with two identical ester substituents on each double-bond carbon. It is planar and lacks chirality.\n\nTherefore, only compounds 1 and 2 exhibit optical isomerism.; answer - B)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - Optical isomerism requires a molecule to be non-superimposable on its mirror image, which arises from either a stereogenic (chiral) center or from axial chirality due to restricted rotation. 1. Dimethyl 6,6\u2032-dinitro-[1,1\u2032-biphenyl]-2,2\u2032-dicarboxylate is axially chiral because the bulky ortho-substituents prevent free rotation about the biphenyl bond, giving two atropisomers. 2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a carbon bonded to \u2013OH, \u2013H, \u2013CH\u2083, and \u2013COOCH\u2083, a classic stereocenter, so it exists as enantiomers. 3. Benzophenone is achiral (no stereocenter or restricted axis). 4. Dimethyl fumarate, an E-alkene with identical substituents on each carbon, has a mirror plane and is achiral. Therefore only compounds 1 and 2 show optical isomerism.; answer - B)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - Optical isomerism requires either a stereogenic center or restricted rotation (axial chirality). Compound 1 (dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate) is axially chiral due to ortho-substituted biphenyl that restricts rotation and yields non-superimposable atropisomers.
