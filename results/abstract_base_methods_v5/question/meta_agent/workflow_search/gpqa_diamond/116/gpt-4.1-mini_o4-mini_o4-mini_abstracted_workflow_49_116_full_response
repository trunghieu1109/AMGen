That can be a chiral center (a carbon attached to four different groups) or another form of asymmetry (e.g. axial chirality).\n\n1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate: The two ortho nitro groups at the 6,6' positions hinder rotation around the biphenyl bond, creating a chiral axis (axial chirality).

Compound 3 (benzophenone) contains no sp3 carbon with four different substituents and no other form of chirality.

Benzophenone has no stereogenic centers (the carbonyl carbon is sp²) and no axis of chirality, so it is achiral. \n4. Dimethyl fumarate is an E-alkene with two identical ester groups on each carbon, yielding a plane of symmetry and no chirality. \n\nTherefore, only compounds 1 and 2 exhibit optical isomerism.; answer: B)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCritic agent sKNp, providing feedback, thinking: The assignment correctly singles out dimethyl 6,6′-dinitro-[1,1′-biphenyl]-2,2′-dicarboxylate (1) and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (2) as optically active. Compound 1 owes its chirality to a sufficiently large barrier to rotation around the biphenyl bond caused by ortho substituents (axial chirality), while compound 2 contains a classical stereogenic center (the carbon bearing –H, –OH, –CH₃, and –COOCH₃). Benzophenone (3) is achiral (no stereocenter or restricted axis), and dimethyl fumarate (4) has a plane of symmetry (identical substituents on each alkene carbon). Limitations: this analysis assumes that the rotational barrier in 1 is high enough to isolate enantiomers at room temperature (too low a barrier leads to rapid racemization and no observable optical activity). It also overlooks potential meso forms in molecules with multiple stereocenters and ignores dynamic processes (conformational changes) that can interconvert enantiomers. Finally, it presumes that substituents are arranged so as to break all symmetry elements; slight structural variations may destroy or create chirality.; answer: Only compounds 1 and 2 exhibit optical isomerism.\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent XXGQ, refining determination of optical isomerism, thinking: Optical isomerism requires a molecule to be non-superimposable on its mirror image, which arises from either a stereogenic (chiral) center or from axial chirality due to restricted rotation. 1.
