Question: Example(question='A chemical reaction for the synthesis of a product containing H+ ion was proceeding at room temperature and pH 1.  Accidentally an unknown substance was fallen into the running reaction making the rate of the reaction slower for the product formation and the container got hot due to an exothermic reaction. The pH value of the solution changed to 4 after this accidental addition. What can be the possible reason for changing the rate of reaction? ', choice1='The increased pressure of the solution', choice2='The increased volume of the solution ', choice3='The increased temperature of the solution', choice4='The increased pH of the solution', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: The accidental addition neutralized H+ and raised the pH from 1 to 4, reducing the proton concentration from 0.1 M to 1×10⁻⁴ M—a 10³-fold decrease. For an acid‐catalyzed reaction first‐order in [H+], the rate is directly proportional to [H+], so this drastic drop in [H+] alone would slow the reaction by roughly three orders of magnitude. Other factors—small dilution, unchanged pressure, and the exothermic temperature rise—either have negligible effects or would accelerate the reaction, not slow it. Therefore, the increased pH is the only plausible cause for the observed rate decrease.
