Question: Example(question='Which of the following molecules is formed when 5-butylnona-2,6-diene is heated?', choice1='4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene', choice2='5-ethylundeca-2,6-diene', choice3='5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene', choice4='5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_49_126
proposed answer: Heating 5-butylnona-2,6-diene triggers a Cope [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement of its 1,5-diene system. In this pericyclic reaction the π bonds at C2–C3 and C6–C7, together with the σ bond of the butyl side chain, reorganize through a six-membered transition state. Two carbons of the original butyl chain become incorporated into the main skeleton (extending it from nine to ten carbons), while the remaining two carbons form methyl and ethyl substituents at C3 and C4, respectively. The new conjugated diene appears at positions 1–2 and 5–6. Of the given options, only 4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene matches this framework perfectly, so the correct choice is A).
