In this process the two π-bonds (at C2–C3 and C6–C7) and the intervening four-carbon segment (C4–C5–C6) reorganize through a six-membered transition state. The net result is a new 10-carbon main chain with double bonds at C1–C2 and C5–C6 and a split of the original butyl substituent into an ethyl group at C4 and a methyl at C3. Among the given options only 4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene matches this structure.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent WboY:\nThe Cope rearrangement of a 1,5-diene such as 5-butylnona-2,6-diene proceeds through a six-membered cyclic transition state, in which one C–C bond of the butyl substituent is incorporated into the main chain and the remaining fragment becomes a substituent. As a result, the main chain grows from nine to ten carbons, and the two π-bonds relocate to the 1 and 5 positions. The former n-butyl at C5 splits into an ethyl group at C4 and a methyl group at C3. Among the four choices, only 4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene has a ten-carbon backbone with double bonds at C1–C2 and C5–C6 and the correct ethyl/methyl substituents. Hence the correct answer is A).\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent fJ0C:\nHeating 5-butylnona-2,6-diene triggers a Cope [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement of its 1,5-diene system. In this pericyclic shift, the two π-bonds (at C2–C3 and C6–C7) and the σ-bond to the butyl substituent reorganize through a six-membered transition state. The net outcome is incorporation of two carbons of the former n-butyl side chain into the main skeleton (extending it to ten carbons) while the remaining two carbons become methyl and ethyl substituents. The new diene framework appears at positions 1–2 and 5–6 on the ten-carbon chain, with an ethyl at C4 and a methyl at C3. Of the choices given, only 4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene matches that structure.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent L73a:\nThe Cope rearrangement of the 1,5-diene (C2–C7) in 5-butylnona-2,6-diene shifts the π bonds from C2–C3 and C6–C7 to new positions at C1–C2 and C5–C6 on a rearranged ten-carbon main chain. The original n-butyl substituent migrates into two alkyl branches on that new chain, specifically an ethyl at C4 and a methyl at C3.

Upon heating, such systems favor intramolecular ene reactions: one alkene (the “ene”) donates an allylic hydrogen from the γ-position of the butyl side chain to the other alkene (the “enophile”) while simultaneously forming a new C–C bond. This concerted process proceeds through a six-membered cyclic transition state, cleaving the butyl chain into ethyl and methyl fragments attached to the former diene backbone.
