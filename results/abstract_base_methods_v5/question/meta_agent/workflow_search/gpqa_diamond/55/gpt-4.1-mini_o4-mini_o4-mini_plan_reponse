        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The two\u2010step dipole transition must obey \u0394l=\u00b11 and \u0394m=0,\u00b11 selection rules. Starting from the initial state |3,0,0\u27e9 (l=0,m=0), the only allowed intermediate states have l=1 and m differing by 0 or \u00b11. Thus the possible intermediate states are |2,1,\u22121\u27e9, |2,1,0\u27e9 and |2,1,1\u27e9. From each of these, a second dipole transition (\u0394l=\u22121, \u0394m=\u2213m) can bring the atom to the final |1,0,0\u27e9 state. Therefore the initial and final states are |3,0,0\u27e9\u2192|2,1,m\u27e9\u2192|1,0,0\u27e9 with m= \u22121,0,1.; answer - Initial state: |3,0,0\u27e9; possible intermediate states: |2,1,\u22121\u27e9, |2,1,0\u27e9, |2,1,1\u27e9; final state: |1,0,0\u27e9.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - In electric dipole (E1) transitions the interaction Hamiltonian is proportional to the dipole operator, which transforms as a spherical tensor of rank 1.  By evaluating the angular part of the matrix element  \u27e8n'\u2009l'\u2009m'|r_q|n\u2009l\u2009m\u27e9 and using the Wigner\u2013Eckart theorem one finds the standard selection rules:\n\n1. \u0394l = l'\u2013l = \u00b11 (parity must change)\n2. \u0394m = m'\u2013m = 0, \u00b11 (the three spherical components q = 0,\u00b11)\n3. There is no strict selection rule on \u0394n beyond energy conservation (n\u2032\u2260n in a non\u2010trivial transition).; answer - \u0394n: unrestricted (subject to energy conservation), \u0394l = \u00b11, \u0394m = 0, \u00b11\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - Starting from the initial state |3,0,0\u27e9 (l=0, m=0), each electric dipole (E1) step must satisfy \u0394l=\u00b11 and \u0394m=0,\u00b11.\n\nFirst step: |3,0,0\u27e9 \u2192 |2,1,m\u27e9 requires l: 0\u21921 (\u0394l=+1) and m: 0\u2192m (\u0394m=m). Allowed m values are \u22121, 0, +1.\n\nSecond step: |2,1,m\u27e9 \u2192 |1,0,0\u27e9 requires l: 1\u21920 (\u0394l=\u22121) and m: m\u21920 (\u0394m=\u2212m). For m=\u22121,0,+1 this gives \u0394m=+1,0,\u22121 respectively, all of which lie in {\u22121,0,+1}.\n\nThus all three intermediate states satisfy the selection rules in both steps.; answer - The allowed intermediate states are |2,1,\u22121\u27e9, |2,1,0\u27e9, and |2,1,1\u27e9.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - We start with the fact that the total two\u2010step dipole rate via each intermediate |2,1,m\u27e9 is proportional to the product of the squared angular factors of each E1 step.  For the first step, 3s (l=0,m=0) \u2192 2p (l=1,m) proceeds with angular matrix element \u27e82,1,m|r_q|3,0,0\u27e9 \u221d C(0,0;1,q|1,m) which vanishes unless q=m, and in that nonzero case has magnitude 1 (so |\u2026|\u00b2=1).  For the second step, 2p (l=1,m) \u2192 1s (l=0,m=0) proceeds with \u27e81,0,0|r_{q'}|2,1,m\u27e9 \u221d C(1,m;1,q'|0,0) nonzero only if q'=-m, and each of these Clebsch\u2013Gordan coefficients has squared magnitude 1/3.  Since the radial integrals are independent of m and cancel in the branching\u2010ratio, each of the three m=\u22121,0,+1 channels carries the same weight \u221d1\u00d7(1/3)=1/3.  Normalizing so that the three branches sum to unity, we conclude each route has probability 1/3.; answer - The allowed two\u2010step dipole\u2010transition routes and their normalized probabilities are\n\n$$\nP\\bigl(|3,0,0\\rangle\\to|2,1,m\\rangle\\to|1,0,0\\rangle\\bigr)\n=\\frac{1}{3},\n\\quad m=-1,0,+1.\n$$\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - From the dipole\u2010selection rules (\u0394l=\u00b11, \u0394m=0,\u00b11) the only two\u2010step paths from |3,0,0\u27e9 to |1,0,0\u27e9 go via the three degenerate |2,1,m\u27e9 levels with m=\u22121,0,+1.
