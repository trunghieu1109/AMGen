Question: Example(question='The |3,0,0\\rangle state in the standard notation |n,l,m\\rangle of the H -atom in the non-relativistic theory decays to the state |1,0,0\\rangle via two dipole transition. The transition route and the corresponding probability are (use latex),', choice1='|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle\nand \\frac{1}{4}', choice2='|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle and \\frac{1}{3}', choice3='|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle and \\frac{1}{4}', choice4='\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle  and \\frac{2}{3}', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: From the dipole‐selection rules (Δl=±1, Δm=0,±1) the only two‐step paths from |3,0,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ go via the three degenerate |2,1,m⟩ levels with m=−1,0,+1. By symmetry each branch carries equal probability, which (when normalized) is 1/3. Among the four provided options only choice 2 (|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/3) matches this result. The other options quote incorrect probabilities (1/4 or 2/3).
