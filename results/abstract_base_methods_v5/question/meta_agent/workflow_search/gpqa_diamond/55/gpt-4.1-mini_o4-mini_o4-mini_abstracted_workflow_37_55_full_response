By coupling the electron’s orbital angular momentum to a rank-1 operator, we get the well-known angular momentum selection rules: Δl = ±1 (because l can only change by one unit when absorbing or emitting a photon of spin 1) and Δm = 0, ±1 (the photon carries m = 0, ±1 projection). There is no strict selection rule on n beyond energy conservation; in principle any radial overlap integral can be nonzero, so Δn can be any integer (n≠n′) though transitions with large Δn are weaker.; answer: Δl = ±1; Δm = 0, ±1; Δn = any (n→n′ unconstrained)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent S0u7, determining dipole selection rules, thinking: Electric dipole transitions are driven by the electric dipole operator "+r", which transforms as a rank-1 spherical tensor.  From angular-momentum algebra (Wigner–Eckart theorem and Clebsch–Gordan coefficients), the matrix elements ⟨n′,l′,m′|r_q|n,l,m⟩ are nonzero only when the angular‐momentum quantum numbers satisfy the triangle conditions for coupling l with 1 to l′, and when m′=m+q with q=0,±1.  There is no strict quantum‐mechanical prohibition on the principal quantum number apart from n′≠n if no transition occurs; radial integrals can be nonzero for any Δn.
