Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_85
proposed answer: Reduction of A with LiBH4 under Felkin–Anh control gives the (R)-configured tetrahydropyranone, so A must be the (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. Reduction of B with BH3 proceeds with retention to yield the (S)-configured product, so B must be the (S)-enantiomer. Only choice 4 (D) assigns A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid and B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

proposed answer: Reduction with LiBH4 occurs under nonchelating Felkin–Anh control, delivering the (R)-configured alcohol at C-4, while BH3 likewise gives the (S)-configured alcohol. Thus the starting acid for reaction A must be the R-acid and for reaction B the S-acid. Among the given choices, only choice 4 (D) assigns A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid and B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, matching our assignments exactly.
