Question: Example(question='You have prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound containing 8 carbon atoms in total. Peaks in the FTIR spectrum of this compound indicate the presence of a carbonyl group as well as an aromatic-halogen bond. Identify the correct 1H NMR data for this compound. ', choice1='1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)', choice2='1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)', choice3='1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)', choice4='1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)', correct_index=4)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_86
proposed answer: The compound is a di-substituted benzene with a carbonyl (acetyl) and a halogen, totaling C8. A para-haloacetophenone gives an AA′BB′ aromatic pattern: two doublets (2H each) around δ7.6–7.8 and a methyl singlet (~3H) for COCH3 around δ2–2.7. Among the options only choice 4 has 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d) and 2.3 (3H, s), matching the expected pattern. Thus the correct NMR data is choice D.
