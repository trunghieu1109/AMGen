        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The question specifies a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring (C6) with 8 carbons total. The two extra carbons must come from the carbonyl substituent (halogen contributes no C), so the carbonyl must be an acetyl group (COCH3). Thus the core is C6H4\u2013COCH3 with one halogen substituent. This gives three possible isomeric substitution patterns on benzene: ortho, meta and para positions of the halogen relative to the acetyl.; answer - Possible substitution patterns: ortho-acetyl halobenzene, meta-acetyl halobenzene, or para-acetyl halobenzene.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - The FTIR spectrum shows a strong absorption band around 1700 cm\u207b\u00b9, which is characteristic of a C=O stretch in a ketone (specifically the acetyl group indicated by our C6H4\u2013COCH3 framework). Additionally, there are distinct bands in the 600\u2013800 cm\u207b\u00b9 region, consistent with an aromatic C\u2013Hal (carbon\u2013halogen) stretching vibration. These combined features confirm the presence of both a carbonyl substituent and an aromatic-halogen bond in the molecule.; answer - The FTIR data confirm a ketone carbonyl group (strong C=O stretch near 1700 cm\u207b\u00b9) and an aromatic\u2013halogen bond (C\u2013Hal stretch in the 600\u2013800 cm\u207b\u00b9 region).\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - We know the molecule is C6H4\u2013COCH3 with one halogen substituent (8 carbons). FTIR confirms a ketone C=O (\u22481700 cm\u207b\u00b9) and an aromatic C\u2013Hal stretch (600\u2013800 cm\u207b\u00b9). Without further NMR splitting pattern or coupling constants, we cannot pinpoint which ring positions. Thus, the substituents could occupy the 2- and 1-positions (ortho), 3- and 1-positions (meta), or 4- and 1-positions (para) on the benzene ring.; answer - The three plausible structures are ortho-halogen acetophenone (2-haloacetophenone), meta-halogen acetophenone (3-haloacetophenone), and para-halogen acetophenone (4-haloacetophenone).\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - We have halo\u2010acetophenone isomers featuring an aromatic ring (C6H4) bearing an acetyl (COCH3) and a halogen. In all cases the acetyl methyl protons appear as a sharp singlet (~2.5\u20132.7 ppm, 3H) since they are isolated from other protons. The aromatic region (4H) will split according to the substitution pattern. \n\n1) Para-isomer (4-haloacetophenone): an AA\u2032BB\u2032 system gives two doublets (2H each) with J\u22488\u20139 Hz. One set (ortho to CO) is more deshielded around \u03b47.9\u20138.0 ppm (2H, d, J\u22488.8 Hz), the other (ortho to halogen) around \u03b47.2\u20137.4 ppm (2H, d, J\u22488.8 Hz).\n\n2) Meta-isomer (3-haloacetophenone): four mutually coupled protons give a more complex pattern: typically \u03b47.85 ppm (1H, d, J\u22481.6 Hz), \u03b47.72 ppm (1H, dd, J\u22487.8,1.6 Hz), \u03b47.53 ppm (1H, t, J\u22487.8 Hz), \u03b47.18 ppm (1H, d, J\u22487.8 Hz).\n\n3) Ortho-isomer (2-haloacetophenone): each of the four aromatic protons is magnetically non\u2010equivalent, giving four separate multiplets between \u03b47.0 and 8.0 ppm (each 1H, m).\n\nThus the universal feature is the 3H singlet at ~2.6 ppm for COCH3, and the aromatic multiplet pattern depends on the isomer as described.; answer - Predicted 1H NMR for halo-acetophenones (C6H4X\u2013COCH3):\n\nPara-isomer (4-haloacetophenone):\n\u2022 \u03b47.95 ppm (2H, d, J\u22488.8 Hz, aromatic H ortho to CO)\n\u2022 \u03b47.30 ppm (2H, d, J\u22488.8 Hz, aromatic H ortho to X)\n\u2022 \u03b42.60 ppm (3H, s, COCH3)\n\nMeta-isomer (3-haloacetophenone):\n\u2022 \u03b47.85 ppm (1H, d, J\u22481.6 Hz)\n\u2022 \u03b47.72 ppm (1H, dd, J\u22487.8,1.6 Hz)\n\u2022 \u03b47.53 ppm (1H, t, J\u22487.8 Hz)\n\u2022 \u03b47.18 ppm (1H, d, J\u22487.8 Hz)\n\u2022 \u03b42.60 ppm (3H, s, COCH3)\n\nOrtho-isomer (2-haloacetophenone):\n\u2022 \u03b47.0\u20138.0 ppm (4H, complex multiplets, each 1H, aromatic)\n\u2022 \u03b42.60 ppm (3H, s, COCH3)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - The compound is a di-substituted benzene with a carbonyl (acetyl) and a halogen, totaling C8. A para-haloacetophenone gives an AA\u2032BB\u2032 aromatic pattern: two doublets (2H each) around \u03b47.6\u20137.8 and a methyl singlet (~3H) for COCH3 around \u03b42\u20132.7.
