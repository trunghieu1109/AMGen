I should define the transition, state the wavelength value, and describe how clouds of neutral hydrogen absorb at that wavelength and produce observable features when redshifted.; answer - The rest‐frame wavelength of the Lyman-α line is approximately 1216 Å, corresponding to the electronic transition of neutral hydrogen from the n=2 to n=1 energy level. This is the strongest UV resonance line of H I, so clouds of neutral hydrogen along the line of sight to a background quasar will absorb virtually all photons exactly at this wavelength in their own rest frame. As these clouds lie at different cosmological redshifts, their individual 1216 Å absorption features are shifted to longer wavelengths in the observed quasar spectrum, producing the characteristic “Lyman-α forest.” This forest of absorption lines allows astronomers to map the distribution and properties of intergalactic neutral hydrogen over a range of redshifts.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - To find the minimum redshift z at which the 1216 Å Lyman-α line is shifted into the ground-based optical window (3500 Å to 9000 Å), we use the blue cutoff at 3500 Å.

In practice, most optical spectrographs and observatories only work efficiently above ∼3600–4000\u2009Å, so a more realistic minimum redshift is closer to 2.0. ; answer: Minimum z≈1.9 (practically ≳2, once real‐world atmospheric and instrument limits are accounted for)\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent 9yzf, refining redshift calculation, thinking: To find the minimum redshift z at which the 1216 Å Lyman-α line is shifted into the ground-based optical window (3500 Å to 9000 Å), we use the blue cutoff at 3500 Å.
