Question: Example(question='Large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorb the light from background quasars at Lyman alpha wavelength ~1216 Angstrom. Estimate the lower limit on the redshift of this objects such that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes? ', choice1='1.9\n\n', choice2='2.4', choice3='3', choice4='1.2\n\n', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_21_129
proposed answer: The Lyman-α rest wavelength is 1216 Å. Ground-based optical telescopes typically have a blue cutoff around 3500 Å. To be redshifted into the observable optical band we require z = (λ_obs/λ_rest) – 1 ≥ (3500 Å/1216 Å) – 1 ≈ 1.88, which rounds to ≈1.9. Among the provided choices (1.2, 1.9, 2.4, 3), only 1.9 meets this lower limit. Therefore the correct answer is A).
