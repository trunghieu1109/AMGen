        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - Ground\u2010based optical telescopes are limited by atmospheric transmission and detector sensitivity. Atmospheric ozone cuts off the UV below ~300\u2009nm, water vapor and thermal emission limit the infrared above ~1\u2009\u03bcm, and CCDs are typically sensitive from about 350\u2009nm up to ~900\u2009nm. Thus the practical optical window on the ground spans roughly 350\u2009nm\u2013900\u2009nm (3500\u2009\u00c5\u20139000\u2009\u00c5).; answer - ~350\u2009nm to ~900\u2009nm (3500\u2009\u00c5 to 9000\u2009\u00c5)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - The user\u2019s sub-task is to explain the rest\u2010frame wavelength of Lyman alpha and why it matters for neutral hydrogen absorption in quasar spectra. I should define the transition, state the wavelength value, and describe how clouds of neutral hydrogen absorb at that wavelength and produce observable features when redshifted.; answer - The rest\u2010frame wavelength of the Lyman-\u03b1 line is approximately 1216 \u00c5, corresponding to the electronic transition of neutral hydrogen from the n=2 to n=1 energy level. This is the strongest UV resonance line of H I, so clouds of neutral hydrogen along the line of sight to a background quasar will absorb virtually all photons exactly at this wavelength in their own rest frame. As these clouds lie at different cosmological redshifts, their individual 1216 \u00c5 absorption features are shifted to longer wavelengths in the observed quasar spectrum, producing the characteristic \u201cLyman-\u03b1 forest.\u201d This forest of absorption lines allows astronomers to map the distribution and properties of intergalactic neutral hydrogen over a range of redshifts.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - To find the minimum redshift z at which the 1216 \u00c5 Lyman-\u03b1 line is shifted into the ground-based optical window (3500 \u00c5 to 9000 \u00c5), we use the blue cutoff at 3500 \u00c5. The redshift is given by z = (\u03bb_obs/\u03bb_rest) \u2212 1 = (3500 \u00c5 / 1216 \u00c5) \u2212 1 \u2248 2.878 \u2212 1 \u2248 1.878. Rounding yields z \u2248 1.9. This simple estimate assumes a sharp atmospheric/instrument cutoff at 3500 \u00c5. In reality, atmospheric transmission and detector sensitivity cut on more gradually around 3600\u20134000 \u00c5, pushing the practical minimum redshift closer to z \u2248 2.0. However, using the nominal 3500 \u00c5 limit gives z \u2248 1.9 as the lower bound for detecting redshifted Lyman-\u03b1 in the optical.; answer - z \u2248 1.9\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - The Lyman-\u03b1 rest wavelength is 1216\u2009\u00c5. Ground-based optical telescopes typically have a blue cutoff around 3500\u2009\u00c5.
