Ethyl (\u2013C2H5) has more hyperconjugative donation than methyl (\u2013CH3), so ethylbenzene gives the highest para\u2010bromo yield, followed by toluene. Chlorobenzene, though an ortho/para director by resonance, is overall deactivated by the \u2013I effect, so its para\u2010fraction is lower. Meta directors (\u2013COOC2H5, \u2013COOH, \u2013NO2) withdraw electron density and direct to the meta position; under the one\u2010isomer assumption they produce essentially no para product. This ranking ignores minor para formation by meta directors under forcing conditions and the much slower rates with deactivated rings.; answer - Ortho/para directors give para\u2010bromo yields in the order: ethylbenzene (5) > toluene (1) > chlorobenzene (3), while meta directors (2, 6, 4) give essentially zero para\u2010bromo product.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - The para-isomer weight fraction correlates with the substituent\u2019s ability to activate the ring at the para position (EDG strength) versus deactivate it (EWG strength), plus steric hindrance suppressing ortho substitution. Among the ortho/para directors, ethyl (\u2013C2H5) donates most strongly via hyperconjugation, so ethylbenzene gives the highest para yield. Methyl (\u2013CH3) is next. Chlorine, though an ortho/para director by resonance, is overall deactivating by \u2013I, so chlorobenzene gives a moderate para yield. The meta directors withdraw by \u2013I/\u2013R and give essentially no para product: the nitro group (\u2013NO2) is the strongest deactivator (lowest para yield), carboxyl (\u2013COOH) is next, then the ester (\u2013COOC2H5). Thus the increasing order of para-bromo yields is: 4 (NO2) < 6 (COOH) < 2 (COOC2H5) < 3 (Cl) < 1 (CH3) < 5 (C2H5).; answer - 4<6<2<3<1<5\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - The para-isomer yield in electrophilic bromination depends on two main factors: (1) the substituent\u2019s electronic directing effect (activation vs. deactivation and whether it directs to ortho/para or meta) and (2) steric hindrance at the ortho positions (which diverts more substitution to the para position). \n\n1) \u2013NO\u2082 (substance 4) is a very strong deactivator and a meta\u2010director, so it gives essentially no para product.  \n2) \u2013COOH (substance 6) also deactivates and meta\u2010directs, but less strongly than nitro, so its para yield is very low but slightly above that of nitro.  \n3) \u2013COOC\u2082H\u2085 (substance 2) is a meta\u2010director by both \u2013I and \u2013R effects, weaker than \u2013COOH, so its para yield is a bit higher.  \n4) \u2013Cl (substance 3) withdraws by induction (deactivating) but donates by resonance (ortho/para director), giving a moderate para yield above all meta directors.  \n5) \u2013CH\u2083 (substance 1) is a weak electron\u2010donating group by hyperconjugation, activating the ring and directing ortho/para, so its para yield exceeds that of Cl.  \n6) \u2013C\u2082H\u2085 (substance 5) is a slightly stronger hyperconjugative EDG than methyl, thus giving the highest para selectivity.  \n\nArranging these from lowest to highest weight fraction of the para\u2010bromo derivative gives:\n4 < 6 < 2 < 3 < 1 < 5; answer - 4<6<2<3<1<5\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 6 output: thinking - We determined the correct order of increasing para-isomer yield is 4<6<2<3<1<5.
