Iteration: abstracted_workflow_1_170
proposed answer: We determined the correct order of increasing para-isomer yield is 4<6<2<3<1<5. Checking each provided sequence: A (3<5<1<6<2<4) is completely different, B (4<2<6<3<1<5) swaps 2 and 6, C (6<2<4<5<1<3) is wrong, and D (4<6<2<1<5<3) misplaces 3. None of the four matches 4<6<2<3<1<5 exactly.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_1_170
proposed answer: We derived the target order 4<2<6<5<1<3 and compared each choice by counting pairwise order disagreements (“inversions”). Choice 2 (4<2<6<3<1<5) matches the first three (meta‐directors) but reverses all three relations among 5, 1, 3, yielding 3 inversions. Choice 4 (4<6<2<1<5<3) misorders 2 vs. 6 (one inversion) and also flips 5 vs. 1 (one inversion), for a total of 2 inversions. All other choices have more disagreements. Thus the closest match is choice 4.
