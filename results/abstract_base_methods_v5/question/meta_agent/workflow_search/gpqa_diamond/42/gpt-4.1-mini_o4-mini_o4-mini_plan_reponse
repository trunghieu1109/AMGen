        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The molecule is a benzene ring substituted with six groups. First, the carboxylic acid, the carbaldehyde (formyl) and the cyano group are said to be all meta to one another, so each of these three is separated by one carbon (i.e. each pair is at positions 1,3 or 1,5 relative). Next, relative to the carboxylic acid: both the hydroxyl and the dimethylamino groups lie ortho (adjacent) to the acid, and the methoxy group lies para (opposite) to the acid. Finally, the methoxy and the hydroxyl groups are additionally both ortho to the nitrile; this is consistent because the nitrile is meta to the acid, shifting the ring so that the methoxy and hydroxyl end up adjacent to the cyano. These relationships match the description of all relative positions.; answer - Substituents: carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde (formyl), cyano, hydroxyl, dimethylamino, methoxy. The carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde and cyano groups are mutually meta to one another. Ortho to the carboxylic acid are the hydroxyl and dimethylamino groups. Para to the carboxylic acid is the methoxy group. Additionally, both the methoxy and the hydroxyl groups are ortho to the cyano group.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - To construct the numbering framework, I start by assigning the highest\u2010priority group (carboxylic acid) as position 1. The carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde (formyl), and cyano groups are mutually meta, so the other two must occupy positions 3 and 5 relative to C1. Next, ortho to the acid (positions 2 and 6) lie the hydroxyl and dimethylamino groups, and para to the acid (position 4) is the methoxy. Finally, the nitrile at position 5 must have its ortho positions (4 and 6) occupied by methoxy and hydroxyl, respectively. This uniquely assigns: 1\u2013COOH, 2\u2013dimethylamino, 3\u2013formyl, 4\u2013methoxy, 5\u2013cyano, 6\u2013hydroxy.; answer - Substituents numbered as follows: 1-carboxylic acid; 2-dimethylamino; 3-formyl; 4-methoxy; 5-cyano; 6-hydroxy.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - According to IUPAC, the carboxylic acid is the principal group and must be C-1. Both possible numbering directions give the same set of locants {1,2,3,4,5,6}, so we apply the \u2018first point of difference\u2019 rule: the substituent that comes first alphabetically (ignoring multipliers) must have the lowest possible number. The substituents in alphabetical order are cyano (C), dimethylamino (D), formyl (F), hydroxy (H), methoxy (M). Thus we choose the numbering in which cyano is at C-3 rather than C-5. This yields: C1=\u2013COOH; C2=\u2013OH; C3=\u2013CN; C4=\u2013OCH\u2083; C5=\u2013CHO; C6=\u2013N(CH\u2083)\u2082, which preserves all ortho/meta/para relationships correctly and satisfies IUPAC tie-breaking.; answer - 1-carboxylic acid; 2-hydroxy; 3-cyano; 4-methoxy; 5-formyl; 6-dimethylamino\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - We must number the benzene ring with the carboxylic acid as C-1 (principal group). To decide the direction (positions 2\u20136), we apply IUPAC\u2019s first point-of-difference rule: alphabetically the substituents are \u2018cyano\u2019 before \u2018dimethylamino\u2019, \u2018formyl\u2019, \u2018hydroxy\u2019, \u2018methoxy\u2019. Placing cyano at C-3 rather than C-5 yields the lowest set of locants. The remaining substituents then fall naturally: C-2 and C-6 are ortho to the COOH and receive hydroxy and dimethylamino; C-4 is para to the COOH and receives methoxy; the leftover C-5 is the formyl. We verify all positional constraints: (1) OH and NMe\u2082 are ortho to COOH; (2) OMe is para to COOH; (3) CN, COOH, and CHO at 3,1,5 are mutually meta; (4) OH (C-2) and OMe (C-4) are both ortho to CN (C-3).; answer - C-1: \u2013COOH; C-2: \u2013OH; C-3: \u2013CN; C-4: \u2013OCH\u2083; C-5: \u2013CHO; C-6: \u2013N(CH\u2083)\u2082. This numbering satisfies all ortho/meta/para relationships and places methoxy and hydroxy ortho to the nitrile.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - We have numbered the ring with carboxylic acid as C-1. The substituents are at C-2 (hydroxy), C-3 (cyano), C-4 (methoxy), C-5 (formyl), C-6 (dimethylamino). According to IUPAC, substituents are listed alphabetically by root name (ignoring di-, tri- prefixes): cyano (C), dimethylamino (D), formyl (F), hydroxy (H), methoxy (M). We assign locants accordingly: 3-cyano, 6-(dimethylamino), 5-formyl, 2-hydroxy, 4-methoxy. The parent is benzoic acid. Hence the full name is \u201c3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.\u201d; answer - 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 6 output: thinking - The derived IUPAC name is \u201c3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid,\u201d which exactly matches choice 2. In the multiple-choice list, choice 2 corresponds to option B. Therefore, the correct answer is B).; answer - B)"
