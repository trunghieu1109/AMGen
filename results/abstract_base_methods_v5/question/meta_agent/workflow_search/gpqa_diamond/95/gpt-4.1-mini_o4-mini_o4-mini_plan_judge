Question: Example(question='The angular size of the event horizon of a supermassive black hole in the centre of a galaxy at a distance of d=10^10 parsecs is measured to be θ=10^-17 degrees. Find the order of magnitude of the entropy of the blackhole.', choice1='10^59 J/K', choice2='10^65 J/K', choice3='10^62 J/K', choice4='10^66 J/K', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_8_95
proposed answer: From sub-task 5 we found S≃1.2×10^62 J/K. Comparing to the options: A)10^59, B)10^65, C)10^62, D)10^66, the closest order of magnitude is 10^62 J/K.
