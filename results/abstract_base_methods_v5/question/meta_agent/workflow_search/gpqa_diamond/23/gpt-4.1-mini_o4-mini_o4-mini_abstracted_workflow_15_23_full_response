Platinum‐catalyzed disproportionation of an unsaturated C₆ mixture X to give benzene (C₆H₆) and cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) is a known reaction. Benzene and cyclohexane do not decolorize Br₂. Thus X must be an equimolar mixture of two C₆ hydrocarbons that both decolorize Br₂, have no conjugation, and on Pt‐catalyzed heating rearrange/disproportionate to benzene and cyclohexane. The simplest candidates are cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀, one isolated C=C) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈, two isolated C=C). Both are liquids, both decolorize bromine water, and neither contains conjugated double bonds. Under Pt heating they disproportionate to benzene + cyclohexane.

Because the H2 generated by the diene is exactly consumed, the net products are an equimolar mixture of benzene and cyclohexane.

The given H mass fraction of Z is 14.28%, which matches the ratio H/(12C+H) = 12/84 ≈ 0.1428. This corresponds to a formula C6H12. Among mixture Y’s components only cyclohexane (C6H12) fits this formula, is saturated (does not react further with H2), and is a widely used solvent. While other isomers of C6H12 (e.g., methylcyclopentane, hexane) have the same H‐fraction, they do not arise from Pt‐catalyzed hydrogenation of benzene under the given conditions.

Both products are formed in equimolar amounts, neither decolorizes bromine water, and under severe hydrogenation conditions both components afford only cyclohexane (Z).

Platinum‐catalyzed disproportionation of an unsaturated C₆ mixture X to give benzene (C₆H₆) and cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) is a known reaction. Benzene and cyclohexane do not decolorize Br₂.

Under heated platinum catalysis, these unsaturated hydrocarbons undergo a disproportionation (hydrogen transfer) reaction: one molecule gets dehydrogenated to form benzene (C6H6), while the other picks up hydrogen to give cyclohexane (C6H12). Both products are saturated or aromatic and thus do not decolorize bromine water. The equimolar nature of X is preserved in the molar stoichiometry of benzene and cyclohexane in Y.; answer: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of benzene (C6H6) and cyclohexane (C6H12).\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent o2C2, analyze reaction to form mixture Y, thinking: From Sub-task 1 we have X = equimolar cyclohexene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene. Under Pt at high temperature these unsaturated rings disproportionate: hydrogen is transferred from one molecule to another, yielding an aromatic ring and a fully saturated ring. The only plausible products are benzene (aromatic, C6H6) and cyclohexane (saturated, C6H12). Both fail to decolorize bromine water, matching the description of mixture Y.; answer: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of benzene (C6H6) and cyclohexane (C6H12).\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent iJa5, analyze reaction to form mixture Y, thinking: Cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) disproportionate over Pt: the diene is dehydrogenated to benzene (C6H6), releasing H2, which hydrogenates cyclohexene to cyclohexane (C6H12).

Let the formula of Z be CxHy. The molar mass is 12x + y. The mass fraction of H is y/(12x + y) ≈ 0.1428. For x=6, y=12: molar mass = 6×12 + 12 = 84; H fraction = 12/84 = 0.142857, i.e. 14.2857%. This matches the given value. Among components of mixture Y (benzene C6H6 and cyclohexane C6H12), only cyclohexane (C6H12) has this hydrogen fraction and is saturated (does not react further with hydrogen). Cyclohexane is a widely used solvent. Therefore Z must be cyclohexane, C6H12.; answer: Z is cyclohexane, C6H12.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCritic agent YQja, feedback on hydrocarbon Z, thinking: The identification of Z as cyclohexane (C6H12) is well supported by the given hydrogen mass fraction (12/84 ≈ 14.28%) and its inertness toward further hydrogenation. Cyclohexane is indeed a common solvent and matches the data from mixtures X and Y. However, the assignment assumes that Z must be a simple saturated C6 hydrocarbon and does not account for branched C6H12 isomers (e.g., methylcyclopentane or hexane) which share the same formula and H‐fraction. It also presumes that no other saturated C6 species are present in mixture Y. Spectroscopic or structural data (IR, NMR) would be needed to rule out these alternatives and confirm the cyclohexane ring structure.; answer: Z is cyclohexane, C6H12.\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent 6F79, refining hydrocarbon Z, thinking: We know Z is the hydrogenation product of both mixtures X (cyclohexene + 1,4‐cyclohexadiene) and Y (benzene + cyclohexane). The given H mass fraction of Z is 14.28%, which matches the ratio H/(12C+H) = 12/84 ≈ 0.1428. This corresponds to a formula C6H12.

Mixture Y, when hydrogenated under severe Pt conditions, gives only Z. This means Y must already contain cyclohexane and another component that under these conditions is also fully hydrogenated to cyclohexane. The only unsaturated C6 hydrocarbon that hydrogenates to cyclohexane is benzene (C6H6). Moreover, benzene + cyclohexane in equimolar amounts does not decolorize bromine water and fits the disproportionation balance from mixture X: C6H10 + C6H8 → C6H6 + C6H12. Therefore, the two liquids in mixture Y are benzene (C6H6) and cyclohexane (C6H12).; answer: Benzene (C6H6) and cyclohexane (C6H12)\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent SqQM, round 0, deduce molecular formulas of mixture Y, thinking: We know from Sub-task 3 that Z is cyclohexane (C6H12). Mixture Y is formed by the disproportionation of the two unsaturated cyclohexane derivatives in X (cyclohexene C6H10 and 1,4-cyclohexadiene C6H8) under Pt and heat. Disproportionation between these yields one molecule that is more saturated (cyclohexane) and one that is more unsaturated (benzene). Both benzene (C6H6) and cyclohexane (C6H12) do not decolorize bromine water (benzene’s conjugation resists addition, cyclohexane is saturated). Since Z (cyclohexane) is one component of Y, the other must be benzene (C6H6).

Mixture Y forms by Pt-catalyzed disproportionation of cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8): one molecule of each yields one molecule of benzene (C6H6) and one of cyclohexane (C6H12). Cyclohexane is the Z constituent, and benzene is the other product that doesn’t decolorize bromine water.

Thus a C6H10 molecule must hydrogenate to C6H12, and a C6H8 molecule must dehydrogenate to C6H6. Both starting compounds must decolorize bromine water (i.e., contain C=C bonds) but have no conjugated systems: cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) fit perfectly.

Let A and B be the two liquids in X. Under heat and Pt, A → C6H6 + H2, so A must be C6H8. B + H2 → C6H12, so B must be C6H10. Both C6H8 (1,4-cyclohexadiene) and C6H10 (cyclohexene) contain isolated double bonds (no conjugation), decolorize bromine water, and upon full hydrogenation yield cyclohexane.
