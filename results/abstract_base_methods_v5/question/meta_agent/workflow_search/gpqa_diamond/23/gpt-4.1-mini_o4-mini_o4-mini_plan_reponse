            "If an equimolar mixture X of two liquids, which decolorizes bromine water, is treated with platinum when heated, then an equimolar mixture Y of two other liquids is formed as a result of disproportionation, which does not decolorize bromine water. Hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y in the presence of platinum under rather severe conditions gives only one substance, a certain hydrocarbon Z (mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%), which is a constituent of mixture Y and widely used as a solvent. Substance Z does not react further with hydrogen. There are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of the compounds of mixture X.\nIndicate the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X.",

        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - We know that the final hydrogenation product Z has formula C\u2086H\u2081\u2082 (cyclohexane) because its hydrogen mass fraction is 14.28%. Platinum\u2010catalyzed disproportionation of an unsaturated C\u2086 mixture X to give benzene (C\u2086H\u2086) and cyclohexane (C\u2086H\u2081\u2082) is a known reaction. Benzene and cyclohexane do not decolorize Br\u2082. Thus X must be an equimolar mixture of two C\u2086 hydrocarbons that both decolorize Br\u2082, have no conjugation, and on Pt\u2010catalyzed heating rearrange/disproportionate to benzene and cyclohexane. The simplest candidates are cyclohexene (C\u2086H\u2081\u2080, one isolated C=C) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C\u2086H\u2088, two isolated C=C). Both are liquids, both decolorize bromine water, and neither contains conjugated double bonds. Under Pt heating they disproportionate to benzene + cyclohexane. Hydrogenation of that mixture yields only cyclohexane = Z.; answer - Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - Cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) disproportionate over Pt: the diene is dehydrogenated to benzene (C6H6), releasing H2, which hydrogenates cyclohexene to cyclohexane (C6H12). Because the H2 generated by the diene is exactly consumed, the net products are an equimolar mixture of benzene and cyclohexane. Neither benzene nor cyclohexane decolorizes bromine water.; answer - Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of benzene (C6H6) and cyclohexane (C6H12).\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - We know Z is the hydrogenation product of both mixtures X (cyclohexene + 1,4\u2010cyclohexadiene) and Y (benzene + cyclohexane). The given H mass fraction of Z is 14.28%, which matches the ratio H/(12C+H) = 12/84 \u2248 0.1428. This corresponds to a formula C6H12. Among mixture Y\u2019s components only cyclohexane (C6H12) fits this formula, is saturated (does not react further with H2), and is a widely used solvent. While other isomers of C6H12 (e.g., methylcyclopentane, hexane) have the same H\u2010fraction, they do not arise from Pt\u2010catalyzed hydrogenation of benzene under the given conditions. Therefore Z must be cyclohexane (C6H12).; answer - Cyclohexane, C6H12.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - Mixture Y arises from Pt-catalyzed disproportionation of cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8): the diene is dehydrogenated to benzene (C6H6) while cyclohexene is hydrogenated to cyclohexane (C6H12). Both products are formed in equimolar amounts, neither decolorizes bromine water, and under severe hydrogenation conditions both components afford only cyclohexane (Z). Therefore, the two liquids in mixture Y are benzene and cyclohexane.; answer - Benzene (C6H6) and cyclohexane (C6H12)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - Mixture Y is known to consist of benzene (C6H6) and cyclohexane (C6H12), formed by a Pt\u2010catalyzed disproportionation of the two components in X. In such a reaction, one component must dehydrogenate to give C6H6 (losing H2) and the other must hydrogenate to give C6H12 (gaining H2). Thus the dehydrogenating precursor must have formula C6H8 (since C6H8 \u2192 C6H6 + H2) and the hydrogenating precursor must have formula C6H10 (since C6H10 + H2 \u2192 C6H12). Both C6H8 and C6H10 contain isolated (non\u2010conjugated) double bonds and decolorize bromine water, matching the problem\u2019s criteria for mixture X.; answer - C6H10 and C6H8\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 6 output: thinking - From Sub-task 5, the two liquids of mixture X are C6H10 and C6H8. The number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of C6H10 is 10, and in one molecule of C6H8 is 8. Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids is 10 + 8 = 18.; answer - 18"
