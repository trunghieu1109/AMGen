Question: Example(question='Your overhear two chemists talking to each other as they leave a synthetic organic chemistry lab. One asks the other "So, how did it go?" The second chemist replies, "Not well - my compounds are on top of each other."\n\nWhat is the second chemist most likely referring to?', choice1='The compounds they are working with are bonding to each other through non-covalent/van der Waals interactions.', choice2='The compounds they are working with have similar polarities.', choice3='The compounds they are working with have similar optical rotations.', choice4='The compounds they are working with have similar boiling points.', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: In synthetic organic chemistry labs, when chemists say “my compounds are on top of each other,” they’re almost always referring to chromatographic separation issues (e.g., TLC or column chromatography). Separation in those techniques depends primarily on differences in compound polarity relative to the stationary and mobile phases. If two compounds have very similar polarities, they interact equally with the phases and thus travel the same distance on a TLC plate (identical Rf values) or co-elute in column/HPLC, producing overlapping spots or peaks. Other factors listed—noncovalent van der Waals interactions, optical rotation, or boiling point—do not directly dictate retention behavior in chromatography under typical lab conditions. Therefore, the most likely cause of overlapping chromatographic signals is that the compounds have similar polarities.
