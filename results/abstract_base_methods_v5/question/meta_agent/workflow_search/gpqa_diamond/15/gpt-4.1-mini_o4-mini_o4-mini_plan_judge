Question: Example(question='How many of the following compounds will exhibit optical activity?\n\n(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene\n(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol\n1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one', choice1='3', choice2='4', choice3='2', choice4='5', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_15
proposed answer: We previously determined that four of the seven listed compounds are optically active (compounds 2, 4, 5, and 7). Matching the count “4” to the given choices (A) 3, (B) 4, (C) 2, (D) 5 corresponds to choice B.

Answer:B)

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_15
proposed answer: We determined in sub-task 6 that five of the listed compounds are optically active: compound 2 ((3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione), compound 4 ((2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid), compound 5 ((R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol), compound 6 ((1S,3S,5S)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol), and compound 7 (1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one). Compounds 1 and 3 are achiral. The total count is 5, which corresponds to choice D.

Answer:D
Extracted answer: D
