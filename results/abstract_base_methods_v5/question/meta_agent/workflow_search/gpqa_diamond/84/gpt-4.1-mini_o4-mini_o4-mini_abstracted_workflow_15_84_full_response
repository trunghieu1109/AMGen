Here λ₀ = 6300\u2009Å is the rest wavelength of the [OI] line, Δλ is the measured shift for each planet, and c ≃ 3.0×10⁸\u2009m/s. We assume Δλ≪λ₀ so relativistic corrections are negligible.

We must express M_star and M_planet in the same mass units. Given: M_star = 1.5\u2009M_⊙ = 1.5×(1.989×10^30\u2009kg) = 2.9835×10^30\u2009kg.

This stems from blindly applying v_planet = v_star\u2009(M_star/M_planet) without checking the Newtonian regime or including the planets’ orbital radii. In reality the planets’ circular speeds are set by v=√(GM_star/a), where a follows from the orbital period (via Kepler’s third law). Moreover, the formula v_p = v_star\u2009(M_star/M_planet) assumes both bodies orbit their common center of mass in a pure two‐body Newtonian system, neglecting relativistic corrections, stellar wind contamination of the [OI] line, and projection effects if sin\u2009i<1. These approximations break down when the mass ratio is so large that the result exceeds non‐relativistic limits, rendering the numerical outcome invalid.; answer: Rather than v_planet = v_star\u2009(M_star/M_planet), one should use v_planet = 2πa/P (or equivalently √(GM_star/a)), where a and P are derived from the transit-determined period via Kepler’s law. This yields orbital speeds on the order of 10^2–10^3\u2009km/s, well within the Newtonian regime.\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent rJ5E, refining planet orbital velocities, thinking: To find each planet’s orbital velocity given the star’s reflex velocity, we use conservation of momentum in the two‐body system: M_star·v_star = M_planet·v_planet.

Such tiny orbits inside the star show that the v_planet values derived in Sub-task 3a are unphysical when used in r=GM/v^2. The momentum‐only approach breaks down here; realistic semi‐major axes must be derived via Kepler’s laws with orbital periods.; answer: Planet1 semi-major axis r1≈1.9×10^4\u2009m (≈1.3×10^−7\u2009AU); Planet2 semi-major axis r2≈5.5×10^3\u2009m (≈3.7×10^−8\u2009AU). These values are physically implausible (far too small), indicating the derived orbital velocities in Sub-task 3a lead to nonsensical radii for transit-detected planets.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCritic agent llbh, providing feedback on orbital radii, thinking: The computed semi-major axes (r1≈1.9×10^4 m and r2≈5.5×10^3 m, corresponding to ∼10^−7–10^−8 AU) are orders of magnitude smaller than even the star’s own radius (~0.005 AU). Such tiny orbital distances lie well inside the stellar photosphere and are obviously unphysical for transit-detected planets. This discrepancy arises because the ‘orbital velocities’ used (on the order of 10^5 km/s) are mistaken by factors of 10^6–10^7—radial-velocity signals are in m/s, not a significant fraction of c. A correct determination of semi-major axes must use Kepler’s third law with measured periods, yielding distances of ∼0.01–0.1 AU, consistent with observed transits.; answer: The derived orbital radii are physically implausible and inconsistent with transit detection.\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent rJ5E, refining orbital radii, thinking: We apply r = G M_star / v_planet^2 with G = 6.674×10^-11 m^3/kg/s^2 and M_star = 1.5 M_sun = 2.9835×10^30 kg. Using the orbital velocities from Sub-task 3a (v_p1 ≈ 1.02×10^5 km/s = 1.02×10^8 m/s; v_p2 ≈ 1.90×10^5 km/s = 1.90×10^8 m/s) gives r1 ≈ (6.674×10^-11×2.9835×10^30)/(1.02×10^8)^2 ≈ 1.9×10^4 m and r2 ≈ (6.674×10^-11×2.9835×10^30)/(1.90×10^8)^2 ≈ 5.5×10^3 m. Converting to AU (1 AU = 1.496×10^11 m) yields r1 ≈ 1.3×10^-7 AU and r2 ≈ 3.7×10^-8 AU. These distances are orders of magnitude smaller than the star’s radius (~0.0056 AU), which is physically impossible for transiting planets. This inconsistency highlights that the v_planet values are incorrect; realistic semi-major axes should be on the order of 0.01–0.1 AU as derived from Kepler’s third law with actual orbital periods.; answer: Planet1 semi-major axis r1 ≈ 1.9×10^4 m (≈1.3×10^-7 AU); Planet2 semi-major axis r2 ≈ 5.5×10^3 m (≈3.7×10^-8 AU). These values are physically implausible—far smaller than the stellar radius—indicating the orbital velocities used are unphysical and that realistic orbital radii for transit-detected planets lie around 0.01–0.1 AU.\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent TpLI, calculating equilibrium temperatures and validating results, thinking: We use the equilibrium temperature formula T_eq = T_eff × sqrt(R_star/(2r)), with T_eff = 6300 K and R_star = 1.2 R_⊙. From Subtask 3b, r1 ≈ 1.9×10^4 m and r2 ≈ 5.5×10^3 m. Plugging in:\n\nT_eq1 = 6300 × sqrt((1.2 R_⊙)/(2×1.9×10^4 m)) ≃ 6300 × 147.8 ≃ 9.3×10^5 K\nT_eq2 = 6300 × sqrt((1.2 R_⊙)/(2×5.5×10^3 m)) ≃ 6300 × 274.7 ≃ 1.7×10^6 K\n\nThese values are unphysically high—far exceeding stellar surface temperatures—confirming our orbital radii from Subtask 3b are not realistic. However, the ratio of the two temperatures is T_eq1/T_eq2 ≃ sqrt(r2/r1) ≃ 0.53, consistent with the transit detection scale when corrected orbital distances are used.; answer: T_eq1 ≃ 9.3×10^5 K; T_eq2 ≃ 1.7×10^6 K (implying T_eq1/T_eq2 ≃ 0.53)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCritic agent yOxf, providing feedback on temperature calculations, thinking: The reported T_eq values (~9.3×10^5 K and ~1.7×10^6 K) are unphysically high for planets—indeed they exceed the star’s own effective temperature. This clearly signals a unit or arithmetic error in the orbital distances used. Planetary equilibrium temperatures around a 6300 K star should lie in the hundreds to a few thousand kelvin, not millions.; answer: The equilibrium temperature formula is correct in form, but the input orbital radii must be revised (e.g. using realistic values in meters or AU). Once the distances are corrected, T_eq will be of order 10^2–10^3 K and the ratio T_eq1/T_eq2 will follow sqrt(r2/r1) with physically plausible values.\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent TpLI, refining equilibrium temperatures, thinking: We apply the equilibrium temperature formula T_eq = T_eff × sqrt(R_star/(2r)), using T_eff = 6300 K and R_star = 1.2 R_⊙ (8.35×10^8 m). From Subtask 3b, r1 = 1.9×10^4 m and r2 = 5.5×10^3 m. Plugging in gives T_eq1 = 6300 × sqrt(8.35×10^8/(2×1.9×10^4)) ≃ 9.3×10^5 K and T_eq2 = 6300 × sqrt(8.35×10^8/(2×5.5×10^3)) ≃ 1.7×10^6 K. These temperatures far exceed the star’s own 6300 K, which is physically impossible for planetary equilibrium temperatures, indicating the orbital radii used are incorrect (units mis-handled).
