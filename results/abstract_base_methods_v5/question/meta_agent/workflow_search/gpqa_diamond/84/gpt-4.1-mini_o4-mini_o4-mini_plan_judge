Question: Example(question='Two planets have been detected orbiting a star using both the transit and radial velocity (RV) methods. The star has a mass of 1.5 times that of the Sun, a radius 1.2 times that of the Sun, and an effective temperature (Teff) of 6300 K. Planet1 has a mass equivalent to 7 Earth masses and a radius 1.7 times that of Earth, while Planet2 has a mass equivalent to 5 Earth masses and a radius 1.3 times that of Earth. Interestingly, both planets are in circular orbits. Planet1 induces a periodic shift of up to 0.03 Å in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å, while the gravitational impact of Planet2 on the same line results in a periodic Doppler shift of up to 0.04 Å. Assuming that both planets possess the same albedo, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2?', choice1='~ 1.05', choice2='~ 0.98', choice3='~ 0.53', choice4='~ 1.30', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_15_84
proposed answer: We previously calculated the equilibrium temperature ratio T_eq1/T_eq2 ≈ 0.76. To choose among the given options (~1.05, ~0.98, ~0.53, ~1.30), we compare the absolute differences: |0.76–1.05|=0.29, |0.76–0.98|=0.22, |0.76–0.53|=0.23, |0.76–1.30|=0.54. The smallest deviation is 0.22 for ~0.98, making choice B) the closest match to our computed ratio.

proposed answer: From our earlier calculations, the equilibrium temperature ratio T_eq1/T_eq2 ≃ 0.547. Comparing this to the given options: A) ~1.05 (difference ≃0.503), B) ~0.98 (difference ≃0.433), C) ~0.53 (difference ≃0.017), and D) ~1.30 (difference ≃0.753). Option C) at ~0.53 is by far the closest to 0.547, deviating by only about 0.02. Therefore, the best match is C).
