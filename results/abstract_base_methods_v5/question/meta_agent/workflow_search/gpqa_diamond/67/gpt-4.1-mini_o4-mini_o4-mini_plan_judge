Question: Example(question='There is a spin 1/2 particle with magnetic moment mu (= gamma*Sz), aligned with a magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction. Suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction; both fields have the same magnitude, B. The average of the z-component of the particle’s moment starts oscillating. What is its oscillation frequency?', choice1='gamma*B/2', choice2='gamma*B', choice3='gamma*B/sqrt(2)', choice4='sqrt(2)*gamma*B', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_7_67
proposed answer: Under the new Hamiltonian H=–γB S_y the initial |+z⟩ state precesses about the y-axis. From Sub-task 4 we found ⟨μ_z⟩(t)=(γħ/2)cos(γB t), so the oscillation has the form cos(ωt) with ω=γB. Comparing with the options A) γB/2, B) γB, C) γB/√2, D) √2γB, only B) matches ω=γB.

Answer:B)
Extracted answer: B)
