Initially there is a static field B along +Z which is suddenly turned off, and an equally strong field of magnitude B is instantly applied along the +Y axis. This means the Hamiltonian switches from H = -γ\u2009B\u2009S_z to H = -γ\u2009B\u2009S_y, reorienting the spin’s precession axis from Z to Y.; answer: The original +Z field is turned off and replaced by a magnetic field of the same magnitude B directed along the +Y axis.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent 6Xr3, describing magnetic field change, thinking: The original magnetic field pointing along +Z is suddenly switched off and immediately replaced by a new magnetic field of the same magnitude B pointing along the +Y axis. This constitutes a sudden quench that reorients the quantization axis from Z to Y without changing the field strength.; answer: The magnetic field is instantaneously turned off along +Z and turned on along +Y with the same magnitude B.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent iumA, describing magnetic field change, thinking: The problem states that initially there is a magnetic field of magnitude B pointing along +Z which is then turned off “suddenly” and replaced by another field of the same magnitude but pointing along +Y. This means the Hamiltonian changes instantaneously from H=−γB\u2009S_z to H′=−γB\u2009S_y. The magnitude remains B, but the direction rotates by 90° from the z–axis into the y–axis.; answer: The magnetic field is abruptly switched off along +Z and replaced by a field of the same magnitude B pointing along +Y.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT agent B549, formulating Hamiltonian after field switch, thinking: The Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment μ=γS in a magnetic field B is H=−μ·B=−γ\u2009S·B. After the switch the field is along +Y with magnitude B, so H=−γ\u2009B\u2009S_y.

The time‐evolution operator is U(t)=exp(−iHt/ħ)=exp[i(γB/2)σ_y t]. This is a rotation about the y–axis by angle θ=γBt. The initial state |ψ(0)⟩ was spin‐up along +z. Under a y‐rotation by θ the expectation of S_z transforms as ⟨S_z⟩(t)=⟨ψ(0)|U†(t)S_z U(t)|ψ(0)⟩=(ħ/2)cosθ=(ħ/2)cos(γBt). Since the magnetic moment operator is μ_z=γS_z, its expectation is ⟨μ_z⟩(t)=γ\u2009⟨S_z⟩=(γħ/2)cos(γBt). Thus it oscillates at angular frequency ω=γB.; answer: ⟨μ_z⟩(t) = (γħ/2) cos(γ B t), oscillating at ω = γB.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCritic agent YjOE, providing feedback, thinking: The time‐evolution was derived by treating the field switch as instantaneous and using U(t)=exp[i(γB/2)σ_y t] to rotate the initial |+z⟩ state about y. This yields ⟨μ_z⟩(t)=(γħ/2)cos(γBt) and frequency ω=γB. However, this derivation assumes a perfectly sudden field change (no finite ramp time), an isolated spin‐½ (no decoherence, relaxation or coupling to other degrees of freedom), a purely static new field, and no higher‐order corrections (e.g. from non‐ideal pulses or additional Hamiltonian terms). In realistic setups finite switching times, environmental interactions, and pulse imperfections will modify the simple cosine oscillation.; answer: The oscillation frequency is ω=γB, but the result is limited by the sudden‐approximation, neglect of decoherence/relaxation, and assumes an ideal isolated spin-½ with a perfectly static field and instantaneous switch.\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent R8Ns, refining time evolution, thinking: Starting from the post‐switch Hamiltonian H=−γB\u2009S_y=−(γħB/2)σ_y, the time‐evolution operator is U(t)=exp(−iHt/ħ)=exp[i(γB/2)σ_y t].
