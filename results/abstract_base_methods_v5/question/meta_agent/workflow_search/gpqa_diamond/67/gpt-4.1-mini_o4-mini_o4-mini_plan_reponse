Suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction; both fields have the same magnitude, B.

        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The problem statement specifies a spin-1/2 particle whose magnetic moment operator is \u03bc=\u03b3S_z, placed in a static magnetic field B pointing along +Z. Alignment means the particle is in the S_z=+\u0127/2 eigenstate. Thus the system is a two-level (spin-\u00bd) system with initial state |+z\u27e9 in a B\u00b7\u1e91 field of magnitude B.; answer - A spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment \u03bc=\u03b3S_z in a magnetic field B\u0125z, initially in the S_z=+\u0127/2 (spin-up along +Z) state.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - The sub-task requests a description of how the magnetic field changes, given the initial setup from Sub-task 1. Initially there is a static field B along +Z which is suddenly turned off, and an equally strong field of magnitude B is instantly applied along the +Y axis. This means the Hamiltonian switches from H = -\u03b3\u2009B\u2009S_z to H = -\u03b3\u2009B\u2009S_y, reorienting the spin\u2019s precession axis from Z to Y.; answer - The original +Z field is turned off and replaced by a magnetic field of the same magnitude B directed along the +Y axis.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - The Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment \u03bc=\u03b3S in a magnetic field B is H=\u2212\u03bc\u00b7B=\u2212\u03b3\u2009S\u00b7B. After the switch the field is along +Y with magnitude B, so H=\u2212\u03b3\u2009B\u2009S_y. For a spin-\u00bd particle S_y=(\u0127/2)\u03c3_y, giving H=\u2212\u03b3\u2009B\u2009(\u0127/2)\u03c3_y=\u2212(\u03b3\u0127B/2)\u03c3_y.; answer - H = -\u03b3 B S_y = -\\frac{\u03b3\u0127B}{2} \u03c3_y\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - Starting from the post\u2010switch Hamiltonian H=\u2212\u03b3B\u2009S_y=\u2212(\u03b3\u0127B/2)\u03c3_y, the time\u2010evolution operator is U(t)=exp(\u2212iHt/\u0127)=exp[i(\u03b3B/2)\u03c3_y t]. Acting on the initial |+z\u3009 state this produces a rotation about y by angle \u03b8=\u03b3B\u2009t. Evaluating \u27e8S_z\u27e9(t)=\u27e8\u03c8(0)|U\u2020(t)S_zU(t)|\u03c8(0)\u27e9 gives (\u0127/2)cos(\u03b3B\u2009t), and since \u03bc_z=\u03b3S_z we obtain \u27e8\u03bc_z\u27e9(t)=(\u03b3\u0127/2)cos(\u03b3B\u2009t). This oscillates at angular frequency \u03c9=\u03b3B. The derivation assumes an instantaneous field switch, no decoherence or relaxation, no coupling to other fields or degrees of freedom, and an ideal two\u2010level system with no pulse imperfections or higher\u2010order Hamiltonian terms.; answer - \u27e8\u03bc_z\u27e9(t) = (\u03b3\u0127/2)\u2009cos(\u03b3B\u2009t), oscillating at angular frequency \u03c9 = \u03b3B.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - Under the new Hamiltonian H=\u2013\u03b3B S_y the initial |+z\u27e9 state precesses about the y-axis. From Sub-task 4 we found \u27e8\u03bc_z\u27e9(t)=(\u03b3\u0127/2)cos(\u03b3B\u2009t), so the oscillation has the form cos(\u03c9t) with \u03c9=\u03b3B.
