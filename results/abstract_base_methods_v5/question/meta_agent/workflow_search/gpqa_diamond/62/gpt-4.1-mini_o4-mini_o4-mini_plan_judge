proposed answer: The computed photon momentum for the J=0→1 transition was found to be p ≃ 3.1×10⁻³¹ N·s, while the provided choices range from 1.4×10⁻²⁸ to 2.3×10⁻²⁷ N·s—each value is about three to four orders of magnitude larger than the calculated result. Because none of the given options comes close to 3.1×10⁻³¹ N·s, the correct choice is that none of the above matches the computed value.

Answer:None of the above
Extracted answer: None of the above
Correct answer: 4
