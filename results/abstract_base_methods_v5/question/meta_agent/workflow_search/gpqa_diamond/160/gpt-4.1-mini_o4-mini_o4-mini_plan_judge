Question: Example(question='While designing a high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating at an accelerating voltage of 1000 kV, Mike connected vacuum pumps to create an ultra-high vacuum state (< 10^-9 Torr) in the sample compartment, aiming to minimize the presence of gas molecules for improved electron microscopy. However, as expected, some gas particles remained inside the compartment, as detected by the mass spectrometer. Mike accurately determined the mean free path of these gas molecules in the vacuum state (< 10^-9 Torr) to be λ1, based on factors such as sample compartment volume, pressure, and temperature. However, upon initiating the electron beam, he made an intriguing observation concerning the mean free path based on electron scattering with the gas molecules. He found that the mean free path was no longer equal to λ1; rather, it was λ2, even though the sample compartment temperature remained the same.\n\nWhat can we conclude about λ2 based on the aforementioned scenario?', choice1="λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation", choice2='λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1', choice3='λ2 < λ1', choice4='λ2 >= 1.22*λ1', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: The molecular mean free path λ1 is set by gas–gas collisions with cross section σ. High‐energy (1 MeV) electrons scatter off gas molecules with an effective cross section σe that is smaller than σ by up to ~20%. Since mean free path λ∝1/σ, we have λ2=λ1·(σ/σe). With σ/σe≈1.0–1.22, electrons travel farther than molecules but not more than ~22% farther. Hence λ1<λ2<1.22 λ1.

proposed answer: The electron–gas scattering cross section at 1000 kV in UHV (<10⁻⁹ Torr) is orders of magnitude smaller than the gas–gas molecular scattering cross section. Numerical estimates gave λ1≈8×10⁴ m for gas–gas scattering and λ2≈3×10¹⁰ m for electron–gas scattering, yielding λ2/λ1≈3.8×10⁵≫1.22. Even allowing large uncertainties (±50% cross sections, different gas species, relativistic corrections) cannot reduce this ratio below 1.22. Therefore, λ2≥1.22·λ1.
