        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - To determine \u03bb1, we use basic kinetic\u2010theory of gases: the mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions, which depends on the number density of gas molecules (set by pressure via the ideal\u2010gas law), their collision cross\u2010section (related to molecular diameter), and the thermal speed (set by temperature). In an ultra\u2010high vacuum (<10\u207b\u2079 Torr) the number density n is extremely low (n\u2248P/kBT), so molecules travel very far before colliding. Explicitly, \u03bb1=kBT/(\u221a2\u00b7\u03c0\u00b7d\u00b2\u00b7P), showing \u03bb1 \u221d T and \u03bb1 \u221d1/P (and inverse to d\u00b2). The sample\u2010chamber volume enters indirectly in determining the total molecule count at a given pressure but doesn\u2019t change the per\u2010molecule mean free path, which depends only on local P, T, and molecular size.; answer - The mean free path \u03bb1 in the ultra\u2010high vacuum sample compartment is the average distance a gas molecule travels between collisions and is given by \u03bb1 = kBT/(\u221a2\u00b7\u03c0\u00b7d\u00b2\u00b7P), where kB is Boltzmann\u2019s constant, T the absolute temperature, P the pressure, and d the effective molecular diameter. Thus, \u03bb1 increases linearly with temperature and inversely with pressure (and d\u00b2), meaning that at <10\u207b\u2079 Torr and room temperature the mean free path is extremely large (often kilometers).\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - When the electron beam is switched on, electrons scatter off the residual gas molecules with a different collision cross\u2010section \u03c3_e than the molecular cross\u2010section \u03c3 that set \u03bb1. At 1\u2009MeV energies \u03c3_e is smaller than \u03c3, so electrons travel farther between collisions than gas molecules do between molecule\u2013molecule encounters. This raises the measured \u2018\u2018mean free path\u2019\u2019 from \u03bb1 (gas\u2013gas) to \u03bb2 (electron\u2013gas). However, \u03c3_e is only modestly smaller, so \u03bb2 only increases by up to ~20%. Thus we expect \u03bb1\u2009<\u2009\u03bb2\u2009<\u20091.22\u2009\u03bb1.; answer - \u03bb1 < \u03bb2 < 1.22*\u03bb1\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - From Sub-task 1, \u03bb1 is set by gas\u2013gas collisions: \u03bb1 = kBT/(\u221a2\u00b7\u03c0\u00b7d\u00b2\u00b7P). In Sub-task 2, electrons scattering off gas molecules have a smaller effective collision cross-section \u03c3_e than the molecular collisions \u03c3, so they collide less frequently and travel farther on average. At 1\u2009MeV energies \u03c3_e is only modestly smaller, yielding at most about a 20% increase in mean free path. Thus under identical temperature and pressure conditions, the observed electron\u2013gas mean free path must exceed the gas\u2013gas value but remain below roughly 1.22 times it.; answer - \u03bb1 < \u03bb2 < 1.22*\u03bb1\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - The molecular mean free path \u03bb1 is set by gas\u2013gas collisions with cross section \u03c3.
