Question: Example(question='Identify the number of 13C-NMR signals produced by the final product, denoted as E, resulting from the series of reactions shown below.\nPropionaldehyde + EDT / BF3 ---> A\nA + BuLi ---> B\nB + Bromoethane ---> C\nC + HgCl2 / H2O / H+ ---> D\nD + PPh3 / 3-bromopentane / BuLi ---> E', choice1='3', choice2='11', choice3='8', choice4='6', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_36_36
proposed answer: The final product E is (C2H5)2C=C(C2H5)2, a symmetrical alkene. It has a plane (or C2) of symmetry that makes both sp2 carbons equivalent (1 signal), all four CH2 carbons equivalent (1 signal), and all four CH3 carbons equivalent (1 signal), for a total of 3 distinct 13C environments. Among the choices (3, 11, 8, 6), 3 corresponds to choice A).
