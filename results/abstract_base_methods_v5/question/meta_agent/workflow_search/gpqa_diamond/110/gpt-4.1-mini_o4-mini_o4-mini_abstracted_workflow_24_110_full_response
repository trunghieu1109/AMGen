In the second reaction, deprotonated 1-nitropropane (the nitronate) adds to (E)-but-2-enenitrile to give the more substituted 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile, which is both sterically and electronically favored.

This enolate then performs a 1,4-conjugate (Michael) addition onto the activated α,β-unsaturated ester (ethyl acrylate). The conjugate addition yields a new carbon–carbon bond at the β-carbon of the acrylate, forming a stabilized enolate intermediate. Protonation of that enolate gives the Michael adduct. Thus, the key intermediates are the cyclohexanone enolate and the post-addition Michael enolate.; answer - The mechanism is a Michael (1,4-conjugate) addition. The intermediate species are: 1) the cyclohexanone enolate formed by deprotonation with t-BuOK, and 2) the Michael adduct enolate resulting from addition of that enolate to ethyl acrylate.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - Under the strongly basic conditions (t-BuOK), the less hindered α-position (the C6–H) of 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one is deprotonated to give the kinetic enolate at C6. That enolate undergoes Michael addition to ethyl acrylate at the β-carbon, forming a new C–C bond at the original C6. Protonation then gives the ketone back at the original C1.

This nitronate then performs a 1,4-conjugate (Michael) addition to the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile, forming a new C–C bond. The resulting adduct is an enolate/nitronate intermediate, which upon protonation (by water) yields the nitroalkane product. No aldol or Henry (nitro-aldol) pathways are involved; the α,β-unsaturated nitrile undergoes classic Michael addition chemistry with the nitronate nucleophile.; answer - The mechanism is a Michael (conjugate) addition: 1-nitropropane is deprotonated to a nitronate anion, which attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile to form an enolate/nitronate intermediate, followed by protonation to give the nitro-substituted nitrile product.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - The base deprotonates 1-nitropropane to its nitronate, which undergoes exclusive 1,4-conjugate addition to the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile. Attack at the α-carbon (1,2-addition) is disfavored because nitriles are poor Michael acceptors at that position and the resulting anion would be unstable. Steric hindrance around the β-carbon is minimal, and electronic factors dictate exclusive Michael addition. Protonation of the α-carbanion yields a single regiochemical outcome: the nitropropyl group attaches at the β-site to give the nitroalkyl nitrile. This step creates one new stereocenter at C-4 of the nitrile chain, so the product is formed as a racemic mixture of two enantiomers.

At C-3 this substituent can occupy either an equatorial or axial orientation. Steric hindrance from the existing 2-ethyl and 6-methyl groups strongly disfavors the axial approach of the propanoate chain. Therefore the equatorial Michael adduct, which places the ethyl and methyl substituents in more favorable orientations and minimizes 1,3-diaxial interactions, is the predominant product. A small amount of the axial isomer forms under kinetic control but is much less stable.; answer: Major product: ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate (equatorial addition). Minor product: ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate (axial addition).\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent ajPS, determining products of first reaction, thinking: In the Michael addition of the bulky 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one enolate to ethyl acrylate, attack occurs at the less hindered β-carbon of the acrylate. On the cyclohexanone ring, substituents at C-2 and C-6 already lock the conformation, and the new propanoate chain prefers to occupy an equatorial position on the product to minimize 1,3-diaxial interactions. Thus the thermodynamically favored adduct is the one in which the new ethyl-propanoate substituent is equatorial (and the existing methyls remain equatorial), giving ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate as the major product.; answer: ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT agent WOXE, analyzing second reaction mechanism, thinking: The base (KOH) deprotonates 1-nitropropane to give the nitronate anion, which is resonance‐stabilized. This nitronate then performs a 1,4-conjugate (Michael) addition to the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile, forming a new C–C bond. The resulting adduct is an enolate/nitronate intermediate, which upon protonation (by water) yields the nitroalkane product. No aldol or Henry (nitro-aldol) pathways are involved; the α,β-unsaturated nitrile undergoes classic Michael addition chemistry with the nitronate nucleophile.; answer: The mechanism is a Michael (conjugate) addition: 1-nitropropane is deprotonated to a nitronate anion, which attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile to form an enolate/nitronate intermediate, followed by protonation to give the nitro-substituted nitrile product.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent rgD6, determining products of second reaction, thinking: The base deprotonates 1-nitropropane to its nitronate, which undergoes exclusive 1,4-conjugate addition to the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile.

Attack at the more substituted β-carbon (bearing the CH3) generates the more stable, more substituted adduct. Protonation then yields the nitroalkyl nitrile with the nitro group at C-4 and a methyl at C-3 of the six-carbon chain. Steric hindrance disfavors attack at the less substituted end, and attack from either face of the planar alkene gives a racemic mixture. Thus the only significant product is the 1,4-addition adduct, 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile.; answer: 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (major product, racemic)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent FlJ3, determining products of second reaction, thinking: The nitronate anion derived from 1-nitropropane attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile in a Michael addition. Deprotonation at the α-position of the nitropropane gives the resonance-stabilized nitronate, which adds preferentially to the less hindered β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile. Attachment of the CH–NO₂–CH₂CH₃ fragment to the β-carbon of the nitrile extends the chain to six carbons and places the nitro group at C-4 and the original methyl substituent (from the alkene) at C-3. Steric hindrance disfavors any α-addition or attack leading to shorter chains.
