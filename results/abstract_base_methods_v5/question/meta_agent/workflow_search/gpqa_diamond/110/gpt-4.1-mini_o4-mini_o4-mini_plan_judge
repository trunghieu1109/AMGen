proposed answer: For reaction A, t-BuOK is a bulky base that deprotonates the less hindered axial C6 position of 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one to give the kinetic enolate. Michael addition of this enolate to ethyl acrylate places all bulky substituents equatorial in the cyclohexane ring, minimizing 1,3-diaxial strain and leading to ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate. Only choice 2 describes this regiochemistry and stereochemistry for A. For reaction B, KOH deprotonates 1-nitropropane to the nitronate, which undergoes 1,4-addition to (E)-but-2-enenitrile. The more substituted product, 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile, is both sterically favored and electronically stabilized. Again, only choice 2 lists this structure for B. Therefore, the correct overall choice is B).
