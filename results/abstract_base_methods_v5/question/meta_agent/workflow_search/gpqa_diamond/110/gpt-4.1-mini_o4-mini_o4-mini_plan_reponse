        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - Under strong base (t-BuOK), 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one is deprotonated to give its kinetically favored enolate. This enolate then performs a 1,4-conjugate (Michael) addition onto the activated \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ester (ethyl acrylate). The conjugate addition yields a new carbon\u2013carbon bond at the \u03b2-carbon of the acrylate, forming a stabilized enolate intermediate. Protonation of that enolate gives the Michael adduct. Thus, the key intermediates are the cyclohexanone enolate and the post-addition Michael enolate.; answer - The mechanism is a Michael (1,4-conjugate) addition. The intermediate species are: 1) the cyclohexanone enolate formed by deprotonation with t-BuOK, and 2) the Michael adduct enolate resulting from addition of that enolate to ethyl acrylate.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - Under the strongly basic conditions (t-BuOK), the less hindered \u03b1-position (the C6\u2013H) of 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one is deprotonated to give the kinetic enolate at C6. That enolate undergoes Michael addition to ethyl acrylate at the \u03b2-carbon, forming a new C\u2013C bond at the original C6. Protonation then gives the ketone back at the original C1. Because both the incoming propanoate chain and the existing methyl at C6 are best accommodated in equatorial positions on the chair, the major product has those substituents equatorial, minimizing 1,3-diaxial interactions.; answer - The major product is ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, formed by Michael addition at the less hindered C6 enolate, with the propanoate substituent and the C6 methyl both occupying equatorial positions to give the most stable diastereomer.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - The base (KOH) deprotonates 1-nitropropane to give the nitronate anion, which is resonance\u2010stabilized. This nitronate then performs a 1,4-conjugate (Michael) addition to the \u03b2-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile, forming a new C\u2013C bond. The resulting adduct is an enolate/nitronate intermediate, which upon protonation (by water) yields the nitroalkane product. No aldol or Henry (nitro-aldol) pathways are involved; the \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated nitrile undergoes classic Michael addition chemistry with the nitronate nucleophile.; answer - The mechanism is a Michael (conjugate) addition: 1-nitropropane is deprotonated to a nitronate anion, which attacks the \u03b2-carbon of the \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated nitrile to form an enolate/nitronate intermediate, followed by protonation to give the nitro-substituted nitrile product.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - The base deprotonates 1-nitropropane to its nitronate, which undergoes exclusive 1,4-conjugate addition to the \u03b2-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile. Attack at the \u03b1-carbon (1,2-addition) is disfavored because nitriles are poor Michael acceptors at that position and the resulting anion would be unstable. Steric hindrance around the \u03b2-carbon is minimal, and electronic factors dictate exclusive Michael addition. Protonation of the \u03b1-carbanion yields a single regiochemical outcome: the nitropropyl group attaches at the \u03b2-site to give the nitroalkyl nitrile. This step creates one new stereocenter at C-4 of the nitrile chain, so the product is formed as a racemic mixture of two enantiomers. No other regio- or stereoisomers are competitive.; answer - The sole major product is racemic 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - The first reaction under t-BuOK generates the kinetic enolate at C6 of 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, which then undergoes a Michael addition to ethyl acrylate to give ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate. This product places all substituents equatorial, minimizing 1,3-diaxial interactions. The second reaction deprotonates 1-nitropropane to the nitronate, which adds in a 1,4-fashion to (E)-but-2-enenitrile, yielding racemic 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile. Only choice 2 lists both of these exact structures, so the correct answer is B).; answer - B)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 6 output: thinking - For reaction A, t-BuOK is a bulky base that deprotonates the less hindered axial C6 position of 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one to give the kinetic enolate. Michael addition of this enolate to ethyl acrylate places all bulky substituents equatorial in the cyclohexane ring, minimizing 1,3-diaxial strain and leading to ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate. Only choice 2 describes this regiochemistry and stereochemistry for A. For reaction B, KOH deprotonates 1-nitropropane to the nitronate, which undergoes 1,4-addition to (E)-but-2-enenitrile. The more substituted product, 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile, is both sterically favored and electronically stabilized. Again, only choice 2 lists this structure for B.
