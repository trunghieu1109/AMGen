Question: Example(question='While solving higher dimensional heat equations subject to suitable initial and boundary conditions through higher order finite difference approximations and parallel splitting, the matrix exponential function is approximated by a fractional approximation. The key factor of converting sequential algorithm into parallel algorithm is', choice1='Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions', choice2='Stability analysis', choice3='Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation', choice4='Complex roots of fractional approximation', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_56_83
proposed answer: The parallelization of the matrix exponential approximation relies on decomposing it into a sum of independent resolvent terms via a linear partial-fraction (rational) approximation. Each term (I – α_k A)^–1 can be computed independently on separate processors without interdependency, enabling parallel splitting. The other options (nonlocal boundary conditions, stability analysis, complex roots) do not inherently create independent parallel tasks.
