        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The problem involves solving d-dimensional heat equations by discretizing space with higher-order finite differences, leading to a large stiff ODE system dU/dt = A U. The solution formally uses the matrix exponential exp(tA), but direct computation is too costly. By employing a fractional (rational) approximation\u2014specifically a partial fraction expansion\u2014exp(tA)\u2248\u2211_{k} w_k (I\u2212\u03b1_k A)^{-1}, each term becomes a resolvent that can be computed independently. This fractional form underpins the parallel splitting strategy: each (I\u2212\u03b1_k A)^{-1} is inverted on a separate processor, enabling concurrent work. Hence, understanding the role of the matrix exponential and its fractional approximation is crucial because it transforms a sequential time\u2010stepping procedure into a parallel algorithm.; answer - In solving higher-dimensional heat equations, we spatially discretize via higher-order finite differences to obtain dU/dt = A U, use the matrix exponential exp(tA) for time evolution, and approximate exp(tA) by a fractional (partial fraction) expansion exp(tA)\u2248\u2211 w_k (I\u2212\u03b1_k A)^{-1}. This fractional approximation yields independent resolvent terms that can be computed in parallel, enabling the conversion from a sequential to a parallel algorithm.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - The matrix exponential exp(tA) gives the exact time\u2010evolution operator for the semi\u2010discrete heat equation dU/dt = A U, but directly computing exp(tA) is prohibitively expensive in high dimensions. By using a fractional (rational) approximation\u2014specifically a partial fraction expansion\u2014one writes exp(tA) \u2248 \u2211\u2096 w\u2096 (I \u2212 \u03b1\u2096 A)\u207b\u00b9. Each term (I \u2212 \u03b1\u2096 A)\u207b\u00b9 can be formed and solved independently. This decouples the large monolithic matrix exponential into several smaller, independent resolvent solves, which can be distributed across processors. Hence the fractional approximation is the key enabler for parallel splitting and efficient parallel PDE solvers.; answer - The fractional approximation of the matrix exponential exp(tA) is a partial\u2010fraction (rational) expansion exp(tA)\u2248\u2211\u2096 w\u2096 (I\u2212\u03b1\u2096 A)\u207b\u00b9, where each resolvent (I\u2212\u03b1\u2096 A)\u207b\u00b9 is an independent linear solve. By distributing these solves across processors, the sequential computation of the exponential is converted into parallel tasks, dramatically improving computational efficiency for high\u2010dimensional PDEs.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - The essence of converting a sequential heat\u2010equation solver into a parallel one lies in decomposing the costly matrix exponential exp(tA) into independent subtasks. A rational (fractional) approximation via partial fractions, exp(tA)\u2248\u2211\u2096w\u2096(I\u2212\u03b1\u2096A)\u207b\u00b9, precisely achieves this: each resolvent (I\u2212\u03b1\u2096A)\u207b\u00b9 can be formed and solved independently on different processors. \n\nChoice1 (nonlocal boundary conditions) is unrelated to the algebraic splitting of the time\u2010stepping operator. Choice2 (stability analysis) is crucial for scheme design but does not by itself enable parallel decomposition. Choice4 (complex roots) may complicate implementation (requiring handling of complex\u2010conjugate pairs) but is not the enabling factor\u2014complex roots do not generate parallelism but merely affect implementation details. Only Choice3 directly yields independent linear solves that can be dispatched in parallel, making it the key enabler.; answer - C)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - The key enabler for parallelization is the decomposition of the matrix exponential into independent resolvent solves via a partial\u2010fraction (rational) approximation. By expressing exp(tA) \u2248 \u2211_k w_k (I \u2013 \u03b1_k A)^\u20131, each term (I \u2013 \u03b1_k A)^\u20131 can be formed and inverted separately on different processors, enabling true parallel work. Nonlocal boundary conditions don\u2019t generate parallel subtasks; stability analysis ensures scheme soundness but doesn\u2019t by itself split tasks; complex roots affect implementation details but don\u2019t create independent parallel work. Only the linear partial\u2010fraction structure directly yields independent linear solves, making it the essential factor.; answer - C)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - The parallelization of the matrix exponential approximation relies on decomposing it into a sum of independent resolvent terms via a linear partial-fraction (rational) approximation.
