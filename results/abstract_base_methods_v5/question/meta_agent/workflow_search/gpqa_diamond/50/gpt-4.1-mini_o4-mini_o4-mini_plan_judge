Question: Example(question='If a charge q is placed d distance away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius R. Calculate the net potential energy of this system.', choice1='U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)', choice2='U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)', choice3='U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)', choice4='U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: Using the method of images, the image charge for a point charge q at distance d from a grounded conducting sphere of radius R is q' = -qR/d located at b = R^2/d. The interaction energy is U_int = k q q'/(d - b) = -k q^2 R/(d^2 - R^2). For a grounded conductor the total electrostatic energy is half the interaction energy: U = (1/2) U_int = - (1/2) k q^2 R/(d^2 - R^2). Comparing this to the options: only choice A matches exactly; B lacks the 1/2 and has the wrong numerator; C has the wrong denominator and numerator; D has R^2 instead of R in the numerator. Therefore, the correct formula is choice A.
