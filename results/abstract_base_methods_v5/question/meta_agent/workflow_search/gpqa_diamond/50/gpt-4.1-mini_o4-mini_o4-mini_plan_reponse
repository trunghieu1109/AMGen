        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - We have a point charge q placed at distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius R. The sphere is held at zero potential, so the boundary condition is V=0 on the spherical surface. To enforce this, we use the method of image charges: place an image charge q' inside the sphere at a distance b from the center such that the potential on the surface cancels. By solving Laplace\u2019s equation with these charges, we find q' = -q R/d located at b = R^2/d. The resulting field outside the sphere is the superposition of the real and image charges, satisfying V=0 on the conductor. This principle allows computation of forces and energies by considering only point charges in unbounded space.; answer - Use the method of image charges: replace the grounded conducting sphere by an image charge q' = \u00e2\u0080\u0093q R/d located at a distance b = R^2/d from the center along the line toward the real charge. This construction enforces the zero\u2010potential boundary condition on the sphere\u2019s surface.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - To enforce the zero-potential boundary condition on the surface of the grounded sphere (V=0 at r=R), we replace the effect of the conductor by a single image charge inside the sphere. The potential at any point outside is the sum of potentials from the real charge q at distance d and the image charge q\u2032 at distance b from the center. On the surface (r=R), requiring k\u00b7q/(d\u2212R) + k\u00b7q\u2032/(R\u2212b) = 0 for all angular positions leads to the well-known solution: q\u2032 must be proportional to q and located so that the equipotential at the sphere\u2019s surface cancels. Solving yields q\u2032=\u2212q\u00b7R/d and b=R\u00b2/d. This choice makes the net potential zero on r=R and reproduces the correct external field.; answer - q\u2032 = \u2212q\u00b7R/d, located at b = R\u00b2/d from the center (along the line toward the real charge).\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - We use the method of images: the real charge q at distance d from the center induces on the grounded conducting sphere an image charge q\u2032=\u2212qR/d located at b=R\u00b2/d. The interaction energy between q and q\u2032 at separation d\u2212b=(d\u00b2\u2212R\u00b2)/d is U_int=kqq\u2032/(d\u2212b)=k\u00b7q\u00b7(\u2212qR/d)/[(d\u00b2\u2212R\u00b2)/d]=\u2212kq\u00b2R/(d\u00b2\u2212R\u00b2). For a grounded conductor the physical electrostatic energy is half the interaction energy: U=\u00bdU_int=\u2212\u00bdkq\u00b2R/(d\u00b2\u2212R\u00b2).; answer - U = -\\tfrac{1}{2} k q^2 R/(d^2 - R^2)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - Using the method of images, the induced image charge for a grounded conducting sphere of radius R due to a point charge q at distance d is q\u2032 = \u2212qR/d, located at b = R\u00b2/d from the center. The separation between real and image charges is d \u2212 b = (d\u00b2 \u2212 R\u00b2)/d. The interaction energy is U_int = k q q\u2032/(d \u2212 b) = \u2212k q\u00b2 R/(d\u00b2 \u2212 R\u00b2).
