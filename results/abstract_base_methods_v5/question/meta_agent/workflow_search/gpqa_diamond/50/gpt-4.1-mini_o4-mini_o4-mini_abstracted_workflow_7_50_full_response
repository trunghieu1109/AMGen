The sphere is held at zero potential, so the boundary condition is V=0 on the spherical surface. To enforce this, we use the method of image charges: place an image charge q' inside the sphere at a distance b from the center such that the potential on the surface cancels. By solving Laplace’s equation with these charges, we find q' = -q R/d located at b = R^2/d.

Limitations include:\n1) It assumes an ideal conductor with no finite thickness or material response time. Real conductors of finite size or nonzero resistivity introduce corrections.\n2) Only the first (monopole) image is used. Higher‐order multipole interactions are ignored but become relevant if the sphere is non‐uniform or if the charge comes very close to the surface.\n3) The formula diverges as d→R, reflecting the infinite work needed to bring a point charge into contact with a conducting surface. In practice, charge distributions spread out, avoiding this singularity.\n4) Quantum effects, surface roughness, and charge discreteness on the conductor are neglected.\n\nThese caveats mean the result is an excellent approximation for a point charge held at a distance moderately larger than R from a large, smooth, grounded metallic sphere, but it breaks down near touch-down or for real materials.; answer: −½\u2009k\u2009q²\u2009R/(d²−R²)\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent Z1b7, refining potential energy calculation, thinking: We use the method of images: the real charge q at distance d from the center induces on the grounded conducting sphere an image charge q′=−qR/d located at b=R²/d.
