The conductor’s interior region (metal) must be an equipotential, so the induced charges arrange to cancel any internal field in the metal. By the uniqueness theorem, the induced +q on the outer spherical surface must be distributed uniformly despite the off-center cavity charge, because the outer boundary is spherical and held at constant potential.

Because the conductor is an isolated, perfectly spherical equipotential, the uniqueness theorem guarantees that no external multipoles can arise: the outer surface charge must distribute uniformly. This uniform shell of +q produces exactly the same field outside the sphere as a point charge +q placed at its centre.

Geometric relationship: the point P lies outside the conductor, and the vectors from conductor center to cavity center (s) and from cavity center to P (l) enclose an angle θ.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent tTVD, analyze electrostatic conditions, thinking: Inside the uncharged conductor, the point charge +q in the cavity induces a charge distribution: –q on the inner cavity surface and +q on the outer surface, so that the total conductor charge remains zero. The conductor’s interior region (metal) must be an equipotential, so the induced charges arrange to cancel any internal field in the metal. By the uniqueness theorem, the induced +q on the outer spherical surface must be distributed uniformly despite the off-center cavity charge, because the outer boundary is spherical and held at constant potential. Therefore, outside the conductor the field is exactly that of a point charge +q located at the conductor’s center.; answer: Induced charge: –q on inner cavity surface, +q uniformly on outer surface. External field: E=(1/4πε₀)·q/L² radially outward from the conductor’s center.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent nVuk, analyze electrostatic conditions, thinking: Inside the conductor’s metal the electric field must be zero. Placing +q in the cavity induces a surface charge distribution of –q on the inner cavity wall so that the field in the metal cancels, while the overall conductor is neutral so +q appears on the outer spherical surface. Because the outer surface is spherical, its induced +q is distributed uniformly, producing an external field identical to that of a point charge +q located at the conductor’s center.; answer: A charge +q in the cavity induces –q on the cavity surface and +q on the outer surface. The external field is the same as that of a point charge +q at the conductor’s center: E(L) = (1/(4πε₀))·q/L² directed radially outward.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent xYuK, analyze electrostatic conditions, thinking: When a positive charge +q is placed inside an off-center cavity of an otherwise neutral conductor, the conductor must maintain zero field in its bulk. That requires an induced charge of –q to appear on the inner cavity surface, arranged non-uniformly so as to exactly cancel the cavity field within the conductor material. By overall neutrality, a charge +q then appears on the outer surface of the conductor. In electrostatic equilibrium that outer +q distributes uniformly (since the conductor is spherical) and produces exactly the same external field as if a point charge +q were concentrated at the conductor’s center. Gauss’s law applied just outside the conductor shows the external field depends only on the total enclosed charge (+q) and falls off as 1/L^2 regardless of the cavity’s off-center displacement.; answer: In electrostatic equilibrium, the inner cavity surface carries an induced charge –q (non-uniformly distributed to cancel the field in the conductor), and the outer surface carries +q uniformly. The external field at distance L>R is identical to that of a point charge +q at the sphere’s center: E = (1/4πε₀)·q/L² radially outward.\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent q56s, determine effective charge distribution, thinking: The charge +q inside the off‐centre cavity induces –q on the inner cavity wall and +q on the outer spherical surface. Because the conductor is an equipotential and the outer boundary is a perfect sphere, by the uniqueness theorem the +q induced on the outer surface must distribute uniformly, regardless of the cavity’s offset. This uniform coating is electrostatically equivalent to a point charge +q at the conductor’s centre when observed from any external point. All internal details are completely shielded, so the external field depends only on that net +q at the sphere’s centre.; answer: The effective external charge distribution is a uniform +q on the outer surface, equivalent to a point charge +q at the sphere’s centre, yielding E= (1/4πε₀)·q/L² radial outward.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCritic agent mHno, providing feedback, thinking: The conclusion that the +q induced on the outer surface of the conductor spreads uniformly and acts like a point charge at the sphere’s centre relies critically on: 1) the conductor being a perfect, isolated sphere in electrostatic equilibrium; 2) absence of any external fields or nearby conductors; and 3) a fully enclosed cavity with no apertures or connections. Under these ideal conditions the uniqueness theorem guarantees that all higher multipole moments vanish outside and the field is exactly E=(1/4πε₀)\u2009q/L². However, if the conductor is non-spherical, connected to ground or other conductors, subject to external fields, or in a non-static situation, the outer charge distribution need not be uniform and external multipoles can appear—so the “point-charge‐at‐centre” picture breaks down.; answer: The uniform +q on the outer spherical surface is equivalent to a point charge +q at the centre only for an isolated, perfectly conducting spherical shell in electrostatic equilibrium with no external influences; otherwise higher multipole components generally alter the external field.\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent q56s, refining effective charge distribution, thinking: The point charge +q in the off-centre cavity induces –q on the inner cavity wall and +q on the outer spherical surface so the conductor remains neutral. Because the conductor is an isolated, perfectly spherical equipotential, the uniqueness theorem guarantees that no external multipoles can arise: the outer surface charge must distribute uniformly. This uniform shell of +q produces exactly the same field outside the sphere as a point charge +q placed at its centre.

The vector from the cavity center to P is simply \\(\\vec{l}\\) with magnitude \\(l\\).  The vector from the conductor center to P is the sum of the conductor→cavity vector \\(\\vec{s}\\) and the cavity→P vector \\(\\vec{l}\\).
