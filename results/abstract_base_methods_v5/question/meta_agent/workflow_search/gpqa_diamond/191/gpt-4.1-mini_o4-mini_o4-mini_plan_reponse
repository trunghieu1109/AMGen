            "Imagine an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ having a small spherical cavity inside. The centre of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the centre of the spherical conductor. The radius of the cavity is $r$, and $r<R$. Now consider a small amount of positive charge $+q$ is somehow placed somewhere inside the cavity. What is the magnitude of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at a point P (outside the spherical conductor) of distance $L$ from the centre of the spherical conductor? Note, the distance of the point P from the centre of the cavity is $l$. Here, l, L > R. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\\theta$\n",

        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The prompt requests definitions of all parameters and their geometric relationships. To fulfill this, I list each parameter (R, r, s, q, L, l, \u03b8), specify what they represent, and describe how the vectors and distances relate. This ensures clarity on the physical setup and prepares for subsequent electric field analysis.; answer - R: radius of the outer spherical conductor (uncharged).  r: radius of the small spherical cavity inside the conductor, with r < R.  s: magnitude of the displacement vector from the center of the conductor to the center of the cavity.  +q: the small positive charge placed at some point within the cavity.  L: distance from the center of the spherical conductor to the observation point P (outside the conductor), with L > R.  l: distance from the center of the cavity to the point P; note that l > R as well.  \u03b8: angle between the vector s (from conductor center to cavity center) and the vector l (from cavity center to point P).  Geometric relationship: the point P lies outside the conductor, and the vectors from conductor center to cavity center (s) and from cavity center to P (l) enclose an angle \u03b8.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - Inside the uncharged conductor, the point charge +q in the cavity induces a charge distribution: \u2013q on the inner cavity surface and +q on the outer surface, so that the total conductor charge remains zero. The conductor\u2019s interior region (metal) must be an equipotential, so the induced charges arrange to cancel any internal field in the metal. By the uniqueness theorem, the induced +q on the outer spherical surface must be distributed uniformly despite the off-center cavity charge, because the outer boundary is spherical and held at constant potential. Therefore, outside the conductor the field is exactly that of a point charge +q located at the conductor\u2019s center.; answer - Induced charge: \u2013q on inner cavity surface, +q uniformly on outer surface. External field: E=(1/4\u03c0\u03b5\u2080)\u00b7q/L\u00b2 radially outward from the conductor\u2019s center.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - The point charge +q in the off-centre cavity induces \u2013q on the inner cavity wall and +q on the outer spherical surface so the conductor remains neutral. Because the conductor is an isolated, perfectly spherical equipotential, the uniqueness theorem guarantees that no external multipoles can arise: the outer surface charge must distribute uniformly. This uniform shell of +q produces exactly the same field outside the sphere as a point charge +q placed at its centre. Any deviation from sphericity, grounding, external fields, or non-static conditions would spoil this result.; answer - The effective charge distribution outside the conductor is a uniform +q spread over the outer spherical surface, which is electrostatically equivalent to a point charge +q at the sphere\u2019s centre, yielding an external field E=(1/4\u03c0\u03b5\u2080)\u00b7q/L\u00b2 radially outward.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - We need to express the two position vectors and then link their magnitudes through the law of cosines.  The vector from the cavity center to P is simply \\(\\vec{l}\\) with magnitude \\(l\\).  The vector from the conductor center to P is the sum of the conductor\u2192cavity vector \\(\\vec{s}\\) and the cavity\u2192P vector \\(\\vec{l}\\).  Its magnitude gives the distance \\(L\\) from the conductor center to P.  By the law of cosines, \\(L^2 = s^2 + l^2 + 2sl\\cos\\theta\\).  This \\(L\\) is the relevant distance for the external field because the induced charges on the conductor\u2019s surface redistribute so that the field outside is as if the total charge \\(+q\\) were concentrated at the conductor center.; answer - Position vector of P relative to the cavity center: \\(\\vec{r}_{P/cav}=\\vec{l}\\).  Position vector of P relative to the conductor center: \\(\\vec{r}_{P/cond}=\\vec{s}+\\vec{l}\\).  The magnitudes satisfy\n\nL=|\\vec{r}_{P/cond}|=\\sqrt{l^2 + s^2 + 2\\,l\\,s\\cos\\theta}.\n\nThis distance \\(L\\) is the effective separation entering the external electric field at P: \n\nE=\\frac{1}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0}\\frac{q}{L^2}.  \n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - From the uniqueness theorem and results of Sub-tasks 3 and 4, the field outside the grounded spherical conductor is identical to that of a point charge +q located at the conductor\u2019s centre. Sub-task 4 showed the distance from the centre of the conductor to point P is L=\u221a(l\u00b2+s\u00b2+2ls\u2009cos\u03b8). By Coulomb\u2019s law, the magnitude of the electric field at P is\nE=\n(1/4\u03c0\u03b5\u2080)\u00b7q/L\u00b2.\nThis exactly matches choice 4 (option D).; answer - D\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 6 output: thinking - From Sub-task 5, we found that the field outside the grounded spherical conductor is equivalent to that of a point charge +q located at the conductor\u2019s centre, and the distance from that centre to point P is L.
