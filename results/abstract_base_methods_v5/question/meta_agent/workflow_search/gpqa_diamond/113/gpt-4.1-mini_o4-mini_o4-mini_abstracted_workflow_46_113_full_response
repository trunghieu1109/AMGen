In contrast, HCl (strong acid, fully dissociated) can protonate the nitrile nitrogen, increasing the electrophilicity of the C≡N carbon and facilitating water addition.

H3O+ (strong acid) effectively protonates the carbonyl, generates HCN from CN– and promotes nucleophilic addition to form the cyanohydrin. NaHSO3 (bisulfite) instead forms a stable bisulfite adduct with the carbonyl, sequestering it and preventing cyanide addition; it does not generate HCN or catalyze cyanohydrin formation. Thus the only suitable reagent A from the given options is H3O+.; answer: A = H3O+\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent ptlD, analyzing first reaction, thinking: To form a cyanohydrin from a ketone and NaCN, the carbonyl must be activated toward nucleophilic attack. Protonic acid (H3O+) is the classic catalyst: it protonates the carbonyl oxygen, increasing the electrophilicity of the carbon, allowing CN− to add and then deprotonation gives the cyanohydrin. In contrast, NaHSO3 is a bisulfite reagent that reacts with carbonyls to give stable bisulfite adducts, sequestering the carbonyl and preventing CN− attack. Thus NaHSO3 cannot serve as a catalyst for cyanohydrin formation and must be rejected. No other reagent in the provided options can activate the ketone appropriately. Therefore the only plausible reagent A is H3O+.; answer: A = H3O+\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent nEPY, analyzing first reaction, thinking: In cyanohydrin formation from a ketone and NaCN, an acid catalyst is required to protonate the carbonyl (increasing its electrophilicity) and to generate HCN in situ from CN–.

HCl (a strong mineral acid) effectively protonates the nitrile nitrogen, facilitates water attack, and drives the reaction to the carboxylic acid via an amide intermediate. In contrast, acetic acid (pKa≈4.8) is too weak to significantly protonate the nitrile or promote hydrolysis under reasonable conditions. Therefore, among the given options, only HCl is a suitable reagent B for converting the cyanohydrin into the corresponding carboxylic acid.; answer: B = HCl\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent b2S2, analyzing second reaction, thinking: Nitrile hydrolysis under acidic conditions requires a strong acid to protonate the –C≡N, activate it toward nucleophilic attack by water, and drive the reaction through the imidate/amide to the carboxylic acid. Acetic acid (pKa ≈4.8) is too weak to fully protonate the nitrile and does not promote efficient hydrolysis. In contrast, HCl provides a strongly acidic medium (pH < 1 when concentrated) that protonates the nitrile, allows water addition to form the imidic acid intermediate, which tautomerizes to the amide and then further hydrolyzes to the carboxylic acid. Thus among the given options, only B = HCl is chemically suitable for nitrile hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid.; answer: B = HCl\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent IKVf, analyzing second reaction, thinking: Nitrile hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid ordinarily requires strongly acidic or basic conditions with heating; simply using a weak acid like CH3COOH (pKa ≈ 4.8) will not sufficiently protonate the nitrile or activate water toward attack. In contrast, HCl (strong acid, fully dissociated) can protonate the nitrile nitrogen, increasing the electrophilicity of the C≡N carbon and facilitating water addition.

Sub-task 2 showed that nitrile hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid requires a strong acid (HCl) under heat, whereas CH3COOH is too weak. Thus A=H3O+ and B=HCl. Below are the balanced, stepwise mechanisms and key intermediates, plus notes on possible side reactions under each condition.; answer: 1) Cyanohydrin formation (A = H3O+):\n   a) Protonation:  butan-2-one + H3O+ → protonated ketone intermediate (R2C=OH+)\n   b) Nucleophilic attack:  R2C=OH+ + CN– → protonated cyanohydrin intermediate (R2C(OH)(CN)+)\n   c) Deprotonation:  R2C(OH)(CN)+ + H2O → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile + H3O+\n   Conditions: aqueous, mildly acidic (pH~4), 0–25 °C to minimize dehydration.

Side reactions: extended heating in strong acid can cause polymerization or cleavage of sensitive substituents, but controlled reflux limits byproducts.\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent EwSr, evaluating reagent candidates, thinking: To form the cyanohydrin (step 1) you need an acid catalyst to protonate the carbonyl and generate HCN in situ. H3O+ (or any strong Brønsted acid) is ideal: it activates the ketone, drives CN– addition, operates under mild conditions (pH\u2009≈\u20091–3, 0–25 °C) and is fully compatible with NaCN. NaHSO3, by contrast, preferentially forms a bisulfite adduct with the carbonyl, sequestering it and preventing CN– attack (and cannot regenerate free carbonyl under the same conditions). Thus A=H3O+ is uniquely suitable.\n\nFor nitrile hydrolysis (step 2), full conversion to acid requires strong acid under heat to protonate the nitrile, promote water addition, and drive successive tautomerizations. HCl (aq) at reflux is standard: it protonates C≡N, accelerates each hydrolysis step, and after a few hours gives the carboxylic acid in good yield. Acetic acid is too weak to activate the nitrile or sustain the necessary equilibria; reaction stalls at amide or imidate intermediates even under forcing conditions. Moreover, HCl is compatible with the 2-hydroxy substituent and benzylphenyl moiety, whereas harsh basic hydrolysis risks deprotonation or side‐chain cleavage. Thus B=HCl is the only practical choice.\n\nIn summary, strong Brønsted acids (H3O+ for cyanohydrin formation, HCl for nitrile hydrolysis) are chemically feasible under controlled conditions, avoid unwanted adduct formation (bisulfite) or incomplete conversion (weak acid), and minimize side reactions.; answer: A = H3O+, B = HCl\n<SEPERATOR>\nCritic agent gktJ, providing feedback, thinking: The evaluation is well-reasoned and correctly concludes that A should be H3O+ (to activate the ketone and generate HCN in situ for cyanohydrin formation) and B should be HCl (to protonate and fully hydrolyze the nitrile to the carboxylic acid). Minor limitations include not explicitly discussing the safe handling of HCN/NaCN or mentioning that alternative strong acids (e.g., H2SO4) could also catalyze these steps, but these points do not alter the validity of the chosen reagents.; answer: A = H3O+, B = HCl\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent EwSr, refining evaluation, thinking: For A: Cyanohydrin formation requires protonation of the ketone to increase electrophilicity and in situ generation of HCN from CN–.

For reagent B (nitrile hydrolysis) a strong acid such as HCl under reflux is needed to protonate the nitrile, activate it toward water addition, and drive the reaction to completion; weak acids like acetic acid cannot fully hydrolyze the nitrile to the carboxylic acid.

No other combination aligns with the necessary chemical reasoning.; answer: D)\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent cOAN, validating final reagent selection, thinking: To validate the choice A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl, we re-examine each reaction step against established protocols:\n\n1. Cyanohydrin formation (butan-2-one → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile):\n   • Reaction requires generation of HCN in situ. A strong acid (H₃O⁺) protonates the carbonyl oxygen, increasing electrophilicity at the carbonyl carbon. This promotes nucleophilic attack by CN⁻ (from NaCN).   \n   • NaHSO₃ would instead form bisulfite adducts with the carbonyl, preventing CN⁻ addition. Weaker acids (e.g., CH₃COOH) cannot efficiently generate HCN.  \n   • Thus, A = H₃O⁺ is mechanistically essential.  \n\n2. Nitrile hydrolysis (2-hydroxybutanenitrile → 2-hydroxybutanoic acid):\n   • Direct acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids requires strong acids under reflux (e.g., HCl).  \n   • A weak acid like CH₃COOH cannot protonate the nitrile sufficiently to drive stepwise hydration and subsequent C–N bond cleavage.  \n   • NaHSO₃ is irrelevant to hydrolysis.  \n\nConclusion: Only the combination A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl (choice D) aligns with well-documented procedures for cyanohydrin formation and nitrile hydrolysis.

In practice, one must use concentrated mineral acid and reflux conditions, and be aware that the nitrile hydrolysis proceeds through an amide intermediate and can require prolonged heating and excess water. However, no alternative reagent combination meets both steps efficiently, so the selection stands.; answer: A = H3O+, B = HCl\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent cOAN, refining validation, thinking: Step 1: Cyanohydrin formation from butan-2-one and NaCN requires in situ generation of HCN.
