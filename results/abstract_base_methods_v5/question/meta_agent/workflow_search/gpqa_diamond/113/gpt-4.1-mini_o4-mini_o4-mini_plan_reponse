        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - In cyanohydrin formation from a ketone and NaCN, an acid catalyst is required to protonate the carbonyl (increasing its electrophilicity) and to generate HCN in situ from CN\u2013. Reagent A must therefore be an acid (H3O+), not a nucleophilic additive. NaHSO3 is a bisulfite reagent that instead adds to carbonyls to form sulfonate adducts and does not promote cyanohydrin formation\u2014it actually sequesters the carbonyl and prevents CN\u2013 addition. Thus among the options, only A = H3O+ is chemically suitable; A = NaHSO3 is explicitly unsuitable.; answer - A = H3O+\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - Nitrile hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid ordinarily requires strongly acidic or basic conditions with heating; simply using a weak acid like CH3COOH (pKa \u2248 4.8) will not sufficiently protonate the nitrile or activate water toward attack. In contrast, HCl (strong acid, fully dissociated) can protonate the nitrile nitrogen, increasing the electrophilicity of the C\u2261N carbon and facilitating water addition. Subsequent proton transfers and loss of NH4+ under heating lead to full conversion to the carboxylic acid. Therefore CH3COOH is too mild to effect nitrile hydrolysis, while HCl is appropriate.; answer - B = HCl\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - Sub-task 1 established that only a protic acid (H3O+) can protonate the ketone and generate HCN in situ for cyanohydrin formation; NaHSO3 traps the carbonyl and is unsuitable. Sub-task 2 showed that nitrile hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid requires a strong acid (HCl) under heat, whereas CH3COOH is too weak. Thus A=H3O+ and B=HCl. Below are the balanced, stepwise mechanisms and key intermediates, plus notes on possible side reactions under each condition.; answer - 1) Cyanohydrin formation (A = H3O+):\n   a) Protonation:  butan-2-one + H3O+ \u2192 protonated ketone intermediate (R2C=OH+)\n   b) Nucleophilic attack:  R2C=OH+ + CN\u2013 \u2192 protonated cyanohydrin intermediate (R2C(OH)(CN)+)\n   c) Deprotonation:  R2C(OH)(CN)+ + H2O \u2192 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile + H3O+\n   Conditions: aqueous, mildly acidic (pH~4), 0\u201325 \u00b0C to minimize dehydration.  Side reactions: strong acid or heat can dehydrate the cyanohydrin to give alkenes or oligomers.\n\n2) Nitrile hydrolysis to acid (B = HCl):\n   a) Nitrile protonation:  R\u2013C\u2261N + HCl \u2192 R\u2013C\u2261N\u2013H+  (increased C-electrophilicity)\n   b) Water addition:  R\u2013C\u2261N\u2013H+ + H2O \u2192 protonated imidate (R\u2013C(OH)=NH+)\n   c) Tautomerization to amide:  R\u2013C(OH)=NH+ \u2192 R\u2013CONH2 + H+\n   d) Amide protonation & attack:  R\u2013CONH2 + H+ \u2192 R\u2013C(OH)=NH2+; + H2O \u2192 tetrahedral carboxy-ammonium intermediate\n   e) Collapse & NH4+ departure:  intermediate \u2192 R\u2013COOH + NH4+\n   Conditions: aqueous HCl (conc. 1\u20136 M), reflux for several hours.  Side reactions: extended heating in strong acid can cause polymerization or cleavage of sensitive substituents, but controlled reflux limits byproducts.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - For A: Cyanohydrin formation requires protonation of the ketone to increase electrophilicity and in situ generation of HCN from CN\u2013. H3O+ (strong Br\u00f8nsted acid) cleanly protonates the carbonyl and provides HCN under mild conditions (0\u201325 \u00b0C, pH\u20091\u20133), giving high yield of the cyanohydrin. NaHSO3 instead forms a stable bisulfite adduct with the carbonyl, sequestering it and preventing CN\u2013 attack, and cannot regenerate free ketone under the same conditions. Thus only H3O+ is suitable for A. For B: Full hydrolysis of a nitrile to the carboxylic acid demands strong acid to protonate the nitrile nitrogen, activate the C\u2261N bond toward water addition, and drive successive tautomerizations and NH4+ departure under reflux. A weak acid like CH3COOH cannot sufficiently protonate the nitrile or shift equilibria, so the reaction stalls at amide or imidate intermediates. Aqueous HCl (1\u20136 M, reflux) is standard, compatible with the 2-hydroxy substituent and benzylphenyl moiety, and minimizes side reactions when controlled. Therefore B must be HCl.; answer - A = H3O+, B = HCl\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - For cyanohydrin formation (A), a strong acid is needed to protonate the ketone and generate HCN in situ; NaHSO3 would form a bisulfite adduct and block CN\u2013 attack. For nitrile hydrolysis (B), a strong acid like HCl under reflux is required to protonate the nitrile and drive hydrolysis to the carboxylic acid; weak acids like CH3COOH are insufficient. Among the given options, only choice 4 (A = H3O+, B = HCl) meets both mechanistic requirements. No other combination aligns with the necessary chemical reasoning.; answer - D)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 6 output: thinking - Step 1: Cyanohydrin formation from butan-2-one and NaCN requires in situ generation of HCN. A strong acid like H\u2083O\u207a protonates the carbonyl oxygen, greatly increasing the electrophilicity of the carbonyl carbon and facilitating nucleophilic attack by CN\u207b. Weaker acids (e.g., CH\u2083COOH) cannot efficiently generate HCN, and NaHSO\u2083 would instead form a bisulfite adduct, preventing cyanide addition.\n\nStep 2: Hydrolysis of the 2-hydroxybutanenitrile to the corresponding carboxylic acid proceeds via acid-catalyzed hydration of the nitrile to an amide intermediate then to the acid. This transformation requires a strong, mineral acid (e.g., HCl) under reflux conditions and excess water. Weak acids (CH\u2083COOH) or non-acidic salts like NaHSO\u2083 lack the proton-donating power to drive the reaction to completion.\n\nNo other reagent pair among the options fulfills both mechanistic requirements. Thus, the choice A = H\u2083O\u207a and B = HCl (choice D) is confirmed as the only viable combination.; answer - D)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 7 output: thinking - Cyanohydrin formation from butan-2-one and NaCN requires a strong acid to protonate the carbonyl and generate HCN in situ; H\u2083O\u207a is ideal, whereas weaker acids (CH\u2083COOH) or NaHSO\u2083 would either be insufficiently acidic or form bisulfite adducts.
