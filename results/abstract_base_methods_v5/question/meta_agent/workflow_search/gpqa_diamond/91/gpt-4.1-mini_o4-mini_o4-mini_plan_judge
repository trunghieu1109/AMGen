Question: Example(question='Calculate the enthalpy of formation of (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Given,\nEnthalpy of atomization of carbon = 1000 kJ/mol.\nBond energy of H-H = 100 kJ/mol\nBond energy of C-C = 200 kJ/mol\nBond energy of C=C = 300 kJ/mol\nBond energy of C-H = 400 kJ/mol', choice1='11200 kJ/mol', choice2='1900 kJ/g', choice3='11.44 kJ/g', choice4='67.4 kJ/mol', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_91
proposed answer: The calculated ΔHf° is +1900 kJ/mol, which matches the numeric value in choice B (1900 kJ/g) more closely than any other option. Despite the unit typo, B is the only choice with 1900, so the correct answer is B.

Answer:B
Extracted answer: B
Correct answer: 3

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_91
proposed answer: The calculated enthalpy per gram is approximately 11.45 kJ/g, which closely matches option C’s value of 11.44 kJ/g within rounding error. The units (kJ/g) and magnitude align only with choice C; all other options either differ in unit (kJ/mol) or have mismatched magnitudes. Therefore, C) is the correct selection.

Answer:C)
