Question: Example(question="You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control’s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control’s resistance; 0% ‒ all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?\n", choice1='G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3', choice2='G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1', choice3='G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1', choice4='G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: Based on the mutant phenotypes, G2 null mutants (g2) completely lose resistance and mask both g1 and g3 in double mutants (g1g2 and g2g3), indicating G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3 and thus acts upstream—consistent with a transcription factor role. The g1g3 double mutant shows a much stronger phenotype (10% resistance) than either single mutant (75% and 50%), a hallmark of genetic redundancy rather than pleiotropy. Although none of the provided options perfectly captures G2’s epistasis, choice A is the only one that correctly identifies G2 as a transcription factor and G1/G3 redundancy. Therefore, A) is the best available answer.
