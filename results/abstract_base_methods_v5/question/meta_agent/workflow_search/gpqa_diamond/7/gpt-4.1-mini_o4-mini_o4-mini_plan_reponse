            "You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function \u2013 G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control\u2019s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control\u2019s resistance; 0% \u2012 all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?\n",

        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - In the single\u2010mutant data, g2 plants lose all resistance (0% of wild\u2010type), indicating that G2 is absolutely required for anthracnose resistance. g3 plants retain only half their resistance (50% of wild\u2010type), so G3 makes a significant but not sole contribution. g1 plants retain 75% of wild\u2010type resistance, showing that G1 contributes only modestly. Thus, among the three, G2 has the strongest individual effect, G3 an intermediate effect, and G1 a minor effect.; answer - G2 is essential for resistance (loss of all resistance in g2), G3 contributes moderately (50% resistance in g3), and G1 contributes weakly (75% resistance in g1).\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - First, compare g1g2 (0% resistance) with g2 (0%) and g1 (75%): the double mutant matches g2, so G2 masks the effect of G1\u2014G2 is epistatic to G1. Next, g2g3 (0%) also matches g2 (0%) rather than g3 (50%), so G2 is epistatic to G3. Finally, g1g3 shows only 10% resistance, much lower than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%), indicating that G1 and G3 act in partially redundant or synergistic parallel pathways: loss of both leads to a stronger defect than either alone.; answer - g1g2 = 0% matches g2 \u2192 G2 is epistatic to G1; g2g3 = 0% matches g2 \u2192 G2 is epistatic to G3; g1g3 = 10% much worse than either single \u2192 G1 and G3 act redundantly/synergistically\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - From the single\u2010mutant data, g2 shows a complete loss of resistance (%0), whereas g1 and g3 retain partial resistance. In both g1g2 and g2g3 double mutants, the phenotype matches g2, indicating G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. Epistasis places G2 upstream in the pathway controlling resistance. An upstream regulator with such dominant blocking behavior is consistent with a transcription factor role. No other gene shows this level of epistasis over multiple partners. Hence, G2 most likely encodes the transcription factor acting upstream. However, this assignment is indirect: epistasis reveals pathway order but does not prove DNA\u2010binding activity. Additional assays (e.g., domain analysis, reporter gene activation, ChIP) are needed to confirm that G2 is truly a transcription factor rather than another kind of regulatory protein.; answer - G2 likely functions as the transcription factor acting upstream of G1 and G3.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - To determine epistasis, compare each double mutant to its single mutants. g1g2 shows 0% resistance, same as g2 (0%) rather than g1 (75%), so G2 masks G1. g2g3 shows 0%, same as g2 (0%) rather than g3 (50%), so G2 masks G3. Therefore G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.; answer - G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - The g1g3 double mutant exhibits only 10% resistance, which is far lower than either single mutant (g1 at 75%, g3 at 50%). This synthetic enhancement\u2014where the combined loss of both genes causes a much stronger defect than loss of each alone\u2014is a hallmark of genetic redundancy. If G1 and G3 were pleiotropic (each affecting multiple distinct traits), losing both would not specifically exacerbate this single trait in an additive or synergistic way. Instead, the severe drop in resistance upon double knockout indicates G1 and G3 act in overlapping or parallel pathways to confer anthracnose resistance, each partially compensating for the other.; answer - G1 and G3 show gene redundancy\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 6 output: thinking - Based on the mutant phenotypes, G2 null mutants (g2) completely lose resistance and mask both g1 and g3 in double mutants (g1g2 and g2g3), indicating G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3 and thus acts upstream\u2014consistent with a transcription factor role. The g1g3 double mutant shows a much stronger phenotype (10% resistance) than either single mutant (75% and 50%), a hallmark of genetic redundancy rather than pleiotropy.
