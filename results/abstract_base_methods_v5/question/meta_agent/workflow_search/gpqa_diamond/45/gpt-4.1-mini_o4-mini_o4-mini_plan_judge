Question: Example(question='Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. How many possible products are there (excluding ethene)?', choice1='4', choice2='6', choice3='8', choice4='2', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_9_45
proposed answer: The self‐metathesis of racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene yields ethene (excluded) and one disubstituted internal alkene (4-methylpent-2-ene). That alkene exists as two geometric isomers (E and Z), giving exactly 2 distinct products. Among the given choices (A)4, (B)6, (C)8, (D)2, the count “2” corresponds to choice D.

Answer:D)
Extracted answer: D)
Correct answer: 2

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_9_45
proposed answer: The detailed stereochemical analysis shows 8 distinct metathesis products excluding ethene. Mapping to the provided choices (A:4, B:6, C:8, D:2) gives C as the correct option.

Answer:C
Extracted answer: C
Correct answer: 2
