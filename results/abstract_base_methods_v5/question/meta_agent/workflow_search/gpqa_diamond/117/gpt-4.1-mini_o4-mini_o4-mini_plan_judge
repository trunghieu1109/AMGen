Question: Example(question='What is the major outcome of the reaction between 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol and bromine?', choice1='2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone', choice2='(1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol', choice3='(1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol', choice4='4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_5_117
proposed answer: The enol form of 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol rapidly tautomerizes to the corresponding ketone under bromination conditions. Bromine then selectively performs α-bromination at the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl (C2), yielding 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. Options B and C would require electrophilic addition of Br₂ across the C=C bond to give vicinal dibromides of an alcohol, which is disfavored when keto-enol equilibrium strongly favors the ketone. Option D proposes bromination at the quaternary C4, which is not accessible via α-bromination. Only choice A matches the mechanistic outcome exactly.
