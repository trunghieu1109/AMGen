Question: Example(question='"Oh, I know you," the ribonucleoprotein particle says to the nascent chain as they meet. "Pause there for a minute. Let me show you in; you really need some sugar."\n"It seems somewhat rough. I guess this is goodbye; I need to be on my way", the chain replies. Where did they meet, and where is the chain heading?', choice1='membrane to the nucleus', choice2='ribosome to the proteasome', choice3='Golgi to the mitochondrion', choice4='cytosol to the extracellular space', correct_index=4)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_26
proposed answer: The ribonucleoprotein particle in the dialogue is the signal recognition particle (SRP), which binds the nascent peptide’s signal sequence as it emerges from the ribosome in the cytosol and pauses translation. The SRP–ribosome–nascent chain complex then docks at the rough ER membrane (facing the cytosol), where translation resumes and the polypeptide is translocated into the ER lumen. From there it travels through the secretory pathway (ER → Golgi → secretory vesicles) and is ultimately secreted into the extracellular space. Among the options, only “cytosol to the extracellular space” matches this meeting location and final destination.
