Under acidic aqueous workup the epoxide ring opens by anti addition of water to give the trans vicinal diol.  Because the two epoxide enantiomers each open to one enantiomer of the trans diol, the net product is a racemic mixture of the trans diol.  The diol carbons (C4 and C5) are each bonded to OH and an n‐propyl group, making them stereocenters.  There are thus two stereoisomers: (4R,5S) and (4S,5R), which are enantiomers.; answer - Two stereoisomeric products: (4R,5S)-4,5-octanediol and its enantiomer (4S,5R)-4,5-octanediol (racemic trans diol).\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - We start with (Z)-oct-4-ene, a cis internal alkene. Epoxidation with mCPBA proceeds by concerted syn addition, so the two propyl substituents end up cis on the epoxide ring. For a symmetric cis alkene like (Z)-oct-4-ene, this cis‐epoxide is chiral and is formed as a racemic pair of enantiomers. Upon aqueous acid treatment, the epoxide ring is protonated and opened by water in an anti fashion, giving a trans-1,2-diol at C4–C5. Each enantiomer of the epoxide leads to the corresponding enantiomer of the trans-diol, and no new stereocenters or meso forms are generated because the attack is regioselective at one carbon of the symmetric epoxide. Thus the net result is a racemic mixture of only two stereoisomers: the (4R,5S) and (4S,5R) octane-4,5-diol.; answer - Two stereoisomers: the enantiomeric pair of trans-4,5-octanediol, namely (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - Epoxidation of (E)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA yields a racemic trans-epoxide that opens under acid to the trans diol pair (4R,5S) and (4S,5R). Epoxidation of (Z)-oct-4-ene yields a racemic cis-epoxide that opens to the cis diol pair (4R,5R) and (4S,5S). The trans and cis diols are diastereomers and cannot interconvert, and each diastereomeric pair consists of two enantiomers. Hence combining the two reaction mixtures gives four distinct stereoisomers in total.; answer - 4 unique stereoisomers\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - In the combined mixture there are four stereoisomers: two enantiomers of the trans diol (4R,5S and 4S,5R) and two enantiomers of the cis diol (4R,5R and 4S,5S). On a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column, enantiomeric pairs are not resolved and coelute as single peaks, whereas diastereomers are resolved.

Epoxidation with mCPBA proceeds by concerted syn addition, so the two propyl substituents end up cis on the epoxide ring. For a symmetric cis alkene like (Z)-oct-4-ene, this cis‐epoxide is chiral and is formed as a racemic pair of enantiomers.

No new stereoisomeric diols arise, so combining the two reaction mixtures still yields only these two enantiomers.; answer: 2 unique stereoisomers\n<SEPERATOR>\nCritic agent VYX7, providing feedback, thinking: The original conclusion that only two stereoisomers are formed rests on the mistaken assumption that both (E)- and (Z)-alkenes lead to the same diastereomeric diol. In reality, mCPBA epoxidation is stereospecific: the (E)-alkene gives an anti-epoxide that ring-opens to the trans-diol (4R,5S) and (4S,5R), whereas the (Z)-alkene gives a syn-epoxide that ring-opens to the cis-diol (4R,5R) and (4S,5S). Thus the mixture actually contains four stereoisomers (two pairs of enantiomers). By ignoring the diastereomeric syn vs. anti opening, the original analysis undercounts the total stereoisomeric diversity.; answer: It fails to account for the syn ring-opening of the (Z)-epoxide, which produces a distinct cis-diol, so there are four stereoisomers, not two.\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent Xftj, refining unique stereoisomer identification, thinking: Epoxidation of (E)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA yields a racemic trans-epoxide that opens under acid to the trans diol pair (4R,5S) and (4S,5R). Epoxidation of (Z)-oct-4-ene yields a racemic cis-epoxide that opens to the cis diol pair (4R,5R) and (4S,5S). The trans and cis diols are diastereomers and cannot interconvert, and each diastereomeric pair consists of two enantiomers.

On a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column, enantiomeric pairs are not resolved and coelute as single peaks, whereas diastereomers are resolved.
