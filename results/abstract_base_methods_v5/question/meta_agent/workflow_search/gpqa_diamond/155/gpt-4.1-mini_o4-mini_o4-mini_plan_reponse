            "A chemist performs two reactions:\n\nReaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. \n\nReaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.\n\nBoth reactions go to 100% completion. The chemist combines the products of both reactions, and then runs the product mixture on both a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column and a chiral HPLC column.\n\nAssuming that the chromatographic resolution is as high as theoretically possible in both cases, what does the chemist observe in each of these chromatograms?",

        "response": "Epoxidation of (E)-oct-4-ene gives the anti (trans) diol as a racemate (two enantiomers), while (Z)-oct-4-ene gives the syn (cis) diol which is a meso compound. Combined, there are three stereoisomers: one meso and two enantiomers. On a standard (achiral) HPLC enantiomers coelute, so you see two peaks (one for the meso diol, one for the racemate). On a chiral HPLC the enantiomers are resolved but the meso remains a single peak, giving three total peaks. Thus the correct choice is C).\n\nAnswer:C)",
        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - Epoxidation of an E\u2010alkene with mCPBA is concerted syn addition but is not enantioselective, so both enantiomeric epoxides form.  Under acidic aqueous workup the epoxide ring opens by anti addition of water to give the trans vicinal diol.  Because the two epoxide enantiomers each open to one enantiomer of the trans diol, the net product is a racemic mixture of the trans diol.  The diol carbons (C4 and C5) are each bonded to OH and an n\u2010propyl group, making them stereocenters.  There are thus two stereoisomers: (4R,5S) and (4S,5R), which are enantiomers.; answer - Two stereoisomeric products: (4R,5S)-4,5-octanediol and its enantiomer (4S,5R)-4,5-octanediol (racemic trans diol).\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - We start with (Z)-oct-4-ene, a cis internal alkene. Epoxidation with mCPBA proceeds by concerted syn addition, so the two propyl substituents end up cis on the epoxide ring. For a symmetric cis alkene like (Z)-oct-4-ene, this cis\u2010epoxide is chiral and is formed as a racemic pair of enantiomers. Upon aqueous acid treatment, the epoxide ring is protonated and opened by water in an anti fashion, giving a trans-1,2-diol at C4\u2013C5. Each enantiomer of the epoxide leads to the corresponding enantiomer of the trans-diol, and no new stereocenters or meso forms are generated because the attack is regioselective at one carbon of the symmetric epoxide. Thus the net result is a racemic mixture of only two stereoisomers: the (4R,5S) and (4S,5R) octane-4,5-diol.; answer - Two stereoisomers: the enantiomeric pair of trans-4,5-octanediol, namely (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - Epoxidation of (E)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA yields a racemic trans-epoxide that opens under acid to the trans diol pair (4R,5S) and (4S,5R). Epoxidation of (Z)-oct-4-ene yields a racemic cis-epoxide that opens to the cis diol pair (4R,5R) and (4S,5S). The trans and cis diols are diastereomers and cannot interconvert, and each diastereomeric pair consists of two enantiomers. Hence combining the two reaction mixtures gives four distinct stereoisomers in total.; answer - 4 unique stereoisomers\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - In the combined mixture there are four stereoisomers: two enantiomers of the trans diol (4R,5S and 4S,5R) and two enantiomers of the cis diol (4R,5R and 4S,5S). On a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column, enantiomeric pairs are not resolved and coelute as single peaks, whereas diastereomers are resolved. Thus the trans diol enantiomers give one peak and the cis diol enantiomers give another peak, for a total of two peaks under ideal resolution.; answer - 2 peaks\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - The combined mixture contains four stereoisomers: two trans diastereomers (4R,5S and 4S,5R) and two cis diastereomers (4R,5R and 4S,5S), each as an enantiomeric pair. A chiral HPLC column under ideal resolution will separate both diastereomers and each pair of enantiomers, giving one distinct peak per stereoisomer. Thus all four stereoisomers are resolved into four separate peaks.; answer - 4 peaks\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 6 output: thinking - Epoxidation of (E)-oct-4-ene gives the anti (trans) diol as a racemate (two enantiomers), while (Z)-oct-4-ene gives the syn (cis) diol which is a meso compound. Combined, there are three stereoisomers: one meso and two enantiomers. On a standard (achiral) HPLC enantiomers coelute, so you see two peaks (one for the meso diol, one for the racemate). On a chiral HPLC the enantiomers are resolved but the meso remains a single peak, giving three total peaks. Thus the correct choice is C).; answer - C)"
