Question: Example(question='A chemist performs two reactions:\n\nReaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. \n\nReaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.\n\nBoth reactions go to 100% completion. The chemist combines the products of both reactions, and then runs the product mixture on both a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column and a chiral HPLC column.\n\nAssuming that the chromatographic resolution is as high as theoretically possible in both cases, what does the chemist observe in each of these chromatograms?', choice1='4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', choice2='3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice3='2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice4='2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: Epoxidation of (E)-oct-4-ene gives the anti (trans) diol as a racemate (two enantiomers), while (Z)-oct-4-ene gives the syn (cis) diol which is a meso compound. Combined, there are three stereoisomers: one meso and two enantiomers. On a standard (achiral) HPLC enantiomers coelute, so you see two peaks (one for the meso diol, one for the racemate). On a chiral HPLC the enantiomers are resolved but the meso remains a single peak, giving three total peaks. Thus the correct choice is C).
