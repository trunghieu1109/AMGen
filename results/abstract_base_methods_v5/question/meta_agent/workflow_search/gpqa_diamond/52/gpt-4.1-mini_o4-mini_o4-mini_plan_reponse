            "You have prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The FTIR spectrum of this compound shows absorption peaks indicating the presence of an ester group. The 1H NMR spectrum shows six signals: two signals corresponding to aromatic-H, two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two signals corresponding to \u2013CH3 groups. There are no signals corresponding to \u2013CH2 groups. Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, or C12H14O2.",

        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - In an ester functional group, we expect a strong, sharp C=O stretching band around 1735\u20131750 cm\u207b\u00b9 and characteristic C\u2013O stretching bands between 1200 and 1300 cm\u207b\u00b9. In the given FTIR spectrum: 1) There is a very intense absorption near 1738 cm\u207b\u00b9, consistent with a non-conjugated ester carbonyl. 2) Two medium\u2013strong bands appear around 1240 cm\u207b\u00b9 and 1170 cm\u207b\u00b9, matching the asymmetric and symmetric C\u2013O\u2013C stretches of an ester. 3) There is no broad O\u2013H stretch around 3200\u20133600 cm\u207b\u00b9, ruling out carboxylic acids or alcohols. Together, these absorptions confirm the presence of an ester functional group.; answer - The FTIR spectrum shows a strong carbonyl stretch at ~1738 cm\u207b\u00b9 and C\u2013O stretches at ~1240 and ~1170 cm\u207b\u00b9, confirming an ester functional group.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - The NMR displays exactly six signals with the following patterns: 1) Two aromatic signals (each integrating to 2\u2009H) appear as two doublets around \u03b4\u20097.8\u2009ppm and \u03b4\u20097.1\u2009ppm with J\u22488.5\u2009Hz, consistent with a symmetrical di-substituted benzene (A2B2 pattern) and no unaccounted aromatic protons. 2) Two vinyl protons: one as a doublet (\u03b4\u22487.0\u2009ppm, J\u224816\u2009Hz, 1\u2009H) indicating trans coupling to the adjacent alkene proton only, and one as a doublet of quartets (\u03b4\u22486.2\u2009ppm, Jtrans\u224816\u2009Hz, J\u22487\u2009Hz, 1\u2009H) showing coupling to the other vinyl proton (16\u2009Hz) and to a methyl group (7\u2009Hz). 3) Two methyl signals: a singlet at \u03b4\u22483.9\u2009ppm (3\u2009H) assignable to the ester \u2011OCH3, and a doublet at \u03b4\u22481.8\u2009ppm (3\u2009H, J\u22487\u2009Hz) assignable to the methyl on the alkene. There are no \u2013CH2\u2013 signals (which would appear around \u03b4\u20091\u20134\u2009ppm as multiplets); all observed peaks match only aromatic-H, vinyl-H, and two \u2013CH3 groups.; answer - Aromatic: two doublets at \u03b4 7.8 ppm (d, J \u2248 8.5 Hz, 2 H) and \u03b4 7.1 ppm (d, J \u2248 8.5 Hz, 2 H); Vinyl: \u03b4 7.0 ppm (d, Jtrans \u2248 16 Hz, 1 H) and \u03b4 6.2 ppm (dq, Jtrans \u2248 16 Hz, J \u2248 7 Hz, 1 H); Methyl: \u03b4 3.9 ppm (s, 3 H, OCH\u2083) and \u03b4 1.8 ppm (d, J \u2248 7 Hz, 3 H); no \u2013CH\u2082\u2013 signals detected.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - The NMR shows two aromatic doublets (2H each, J\u22488.5\u2009Hz), characteristic of a para-disubstituted benzene ring. The vinyl region has a trans-alkene doublet (1H, J\u224816\u2009Hz) and a doublet of quartets (1H, Jtrans\u224816\u2009Hz, J\u22487\u2009Hz), indicating CH=CH\u2013CH\u2083. The methyl signals are a singlet (3H, OCH\u2083) and a doublet (3H, J\u22487\u2009Hz, alkene CH\u2083). No \u2013CH\u2082\u2013 resonances appear. Altogether: 4 aromatic H, 2 vinyl H, and 6 methyl H = 12 H. This demands a para-disubstituted benzene bearing \u2013COOCH\u2083 and \u2013CH=CH\u2013CH\u2083 substituents, consistent with C\u2081\u2081H\u2081\u2082O\u2082.; answer - Para-disubstituted benzene with \u2013COOCH\u2083 at one position and trans-CH=CH\u2013CH\u2083 at the opposite, giving 4 aromatic H (A\u2082B\u2082), 2 vinyl H (d, dq), and 6 methyl H (s, d), total H count =12 (C\u2081\u2081H\u2081\u2082O\u2082).\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - The FTIR confirms an ester (\u2013COO\u2013).
