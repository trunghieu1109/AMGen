Question: Example(question='You have prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The FTIR spectrum of this compound shows absorption peaks indicating the presence of an ester group. The 1H NMR spectrum shows six signals: two signals corresponding to aromatic-H, two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups. There are no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups. Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, or C12H14O2.', choice1='C12H14O2', choice2='C12H12O2', choice3='C11H14O2', choice4='C11H12O2', correct_index=4)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_11_52
proposed answer: The FTIR confirms an ester (–COO–). The 1H NMR shows 12 protons total: 4 aromatic H (para‐disubstituted benzene pattern), 2 vinyl H (one trans‐alkene doublet, one doublet of quartets for CH=CH–CH3), and 6 methyl H (one OCH3 singlet, one alkene CH3 doublet). No –CH2– signals are present, ruling out extra methylene units. Counting carbons: 6 in the benzene ring, 1 in OCH3, 3 in the CH=CH–CH3 side chain, and 1 carbonyl carbon totals 11 C. With 12 H and 2 O, the formula is C11H12O2, matching option D.
