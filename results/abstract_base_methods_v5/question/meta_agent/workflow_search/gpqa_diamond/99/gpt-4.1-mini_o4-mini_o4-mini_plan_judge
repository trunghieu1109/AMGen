Question: Example(question='Compound A (C3H6) undergoes bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride to form compound B. When compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH, it forms compound C. Passing compound C through a red-hot iron tube produces compound D. Compound D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form compound E. Compound E, in the presence of iron scrap and hydrochloric acid, forms compound F. Compound F reacts with nitrous acid to form G. When G reacts with sodium hydroxide, it forms H. Identify the incorrect statement about the products obtained in this reaction sequence.', choice1='D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.', choice2='F is used for the synthesis of dyes.', choice3='H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.', choice4='C is a flammable gas.', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_56_99
proposed answer: Sub-task 8 confirms D (mesitylene) gives two singlets. Sub-task 9 confirms F (2-amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene) is used in dye synthesis. Sub-task 11 confirms C (propyne) is a flammable gas. Sub-task 10 shows H (2,4,6-trimethylphenol) gives a purple/violet color with FeCl3, not yellow. Therefore the statement that H gives a yellow color is incorrect.

Answer:C)
Extracted answer: C)
