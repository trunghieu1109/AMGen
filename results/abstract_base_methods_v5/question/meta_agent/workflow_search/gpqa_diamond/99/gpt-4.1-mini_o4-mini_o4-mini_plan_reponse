        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - C3H6 must react with Br2 in CCl4 via electrophilic addition, so it\u2019s an alkene, not a cycloalkane. The only C3H6 alkene is propene (CH3\u2013CH=CH2). Bromine adds across the double bond to give the vicinal dibromide. Thus A is propene, and B is 1,2-dibromopropane (CH3\u2013CHBr\u2013CH2Br).; answer - Compound A is propene (an alkene) and Compound B is 1,2-dibromopropane.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - Compound B is 1,2-dibromopropane (CH3\u2013CHBr\u2013CH2Br). When treated with alcoholic KOH and heat, it undergoes two successive dehydrohalogenations: each KOH removes HBr from adjacent carbons to form a carbon\u2013carbon triple bond. Thus the vicinal dibromide yields a terminal alkyne. The product is CH3\u2013C\u2261CH (propyne, also called methylacetylene). Propyne is a low\u2013boiling, colorless, flammable gas.; answer - Compound C is propyne (methylacetylene), CH3\u2013C\u2261CH, which is a flammable gas.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - Passing a terminal alkyne like propyne (CH\u2083\u2013C\u2261CH) through a red-hot iron tube promotes high-temperature cyclotrimerization. Three propyne molecules can combine to give a C\u2089 aromatic ring\u2014ideally 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene) due to its maximized symmetry. In pure mesitylene all three methyl groups are chemically equivalent and all three ring hydrogens are equivalent. Consequently, its \u00b9H NMR spectrum exhibits exactly two singlets: one integrating to 9\u2009H around \u03b4 \u22482.3\u2009ppm (the methyls) and one integrating to 3\u2009H around \u03b4 \u22486.8\u2009ppm (the aromatic H). However, note that bare iron tubing often yields mixtures of trimethylbenzene isomers and other side products, so isolation of pure mesitylene with clean singlets generally requires more controlled catalysis and conditions.; answer - Compound D is mesitylene (1,3,5-trimethylbenzene), characterized by two singlets in its \u00b9H NMR spectrum (9\u2009H for the methyl groups at \u22482.3\u2009ppm and 3\u2009H for aromatic protons at \u22486.8\u2009ppm).\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - Starting from Compound D identified as mesitylene (1,3,5\u2010trimethylbenzene), treatment with a mixture of two strong acids refers to the classical nitrating mixture (conc. HNO\u2083 + conc. H\u2082SO\u2084). The activated aromatic ring of mesitylene undergoes electrophilic substitution at one of the three equivalent positions (2,4,6), yielding the mononitro derivative. Because all three ring positions are equivalent, only one isomer forms: 2\u2010nitro\u20101,3,5\u2010trimethylbenzene (nitromesitylene). Its properties include: a yellow oily liquid (m.p. \u2248 \u20138 \u00b0C, b.p. \u2248 260 \u00b0C), characteristic IR bands at ~1520 and 1345 cm\u207b\u00b9 (NO\u2082 stretch), and \u00b9H NMR with three distinct methyl singlets around \u03b4 2.3\u20132.5 ppm and two equivalent aromatic protons as a singlet near \u03b4 6.8 ppm.; answer - Compound E is 2\u2010nitro\u20101,3,5\u2010trimethylbenzene (nitromesitylene), a yellow oily aromatic nitro compound formed by nitration of mesitylene with conc. HNO\u2083/H\u2082SO\u2084.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - Compound E, identified as 2-nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (nitromesitylene), undergoes classical reduction of its nitro group when treated with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid, yielding the corresponding aromatic amine, 2-amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesidine). Aromatic primary amines like mesidine are highly valuable in dye chemistry: the \u2013NH\u2082 functionality can be diazotized to form diazonium salts, which then couple with phenolic or amine components to produce a wide variety of azo dyes and pigments. This reactivity underpins its widespread industrial use as a key intermediate in azo dye synthesis and related colorant manufacturing.; answer - Compound F is 2-amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesidine), used primarily as an intermediate in the synthesis of azo dyes and pigments.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 6 output: thinking - Compound F is 2-amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesidine). Treatment of a primary aromatic amine with nitrous acid at 0\u20135 \u00b0C converts \u2013NH\u2082 into a diazonium group (\u2013N\u2082\u207aCl\u207b). Thus G must be the diazonium salt 2-diazo-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene chloride. This diazonium salt is a pale yellow, water\u2010soluble, unstable solid at temperatures above 5 \u00b0C, readily evolving N\u2082 and undergoing substitution reactions. On treatment with NaOH it hydrolyzes to give the corresponding phenol (mesitol), which matches the next step forming H.; answer - G is the diazonium salt: 2-diazo-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene chloride (mesidine diazonium chloride), a pale yellow, water-soluble, thermally unstable diazonium compound that decomposes to evolve N\u2082 and, on warming or reaction with NaOH, yields the corresponding phenol.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 7 output: thinking - Compound G is the diazonium salt of 2-amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene. Upon warming with NaOH, the diazonium group is replaced by \u2013OH, yielding 2,4,6-trimethylphenol (mesitol). As a phenol, its OH group deprotonates to form a phenolate anion, which reacts with Fe3+ to give a purple/violet complex, a diagnostic test for phenols.; answer - Compound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol (mesitol). It gives a purple/violet coloration with ferric chloride due to formation of the phenolate\u2013Fe\u00b3\u207a complex.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 8 output: thinking - Mesitylene (1,3,5\u2010trimethylbenzene) is highly symmetric: its three methyl substituents are chemically equivalent and its three remaining aromatic protons are also equivalent. In a \u00b9H NMR spectrum this yields exactly two signals: a singlet integrating to 9\u2009H (the methyl groups, \u03b4 \u22482.3\u2009ppm) and a singlet integrating to 3\u2009H (the aromatic protons, \u03b4 \u22486.8\u2009ppm). There are no coupling partners for either set of protons, so both appear as singlets.; answer - Yes, Compound D gives two singlets in its \u00b9H NMR spectrum.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 9 output: thinking - Compound F was identified as 2-amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesidine). Aromatic primary amines like mesidine undergo diazotization (\u2013NH\u2082 \u2192 diazonium salt) and subsequent coupling with phenols or other aromatics to form azo linkages (\u2013N=N\u2013), which are the chromophores in many dyes. This reaction sequence is the basis for the industrial manufacture of azo dyes and pigments. Therefore, based on its structure and well-established reactivity, mesidine is indeed used as a key intermediate in dye synthesis.; answer - The claim is correct: Compound F is used for the synthesis of dyes as an intermediate in azo dye production.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 10 output: thinking - Compound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol (mesitol), a phenolic compound. Phenols react with ferric chloride to form a colored complex, typically purple/violet, due to coordination of the phenolate oxygen with Fe3+. A yellow color is characteristic of phenolic acids like salicylic acid, not simple alkyl-substituted phenols. Therefore, mesitol does not give a yellow coloration with FeCl3.; answer - The statement is incorrect \u2013 Compound H (mesitol) gives a purple/violet color with ferric chloride, not yellow.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 11 output: thinking - Compound C has been identified as propyne (methylacetylene), CH3\u2013C\u2261CH. Propyne has a boiling point of about 8 \u00b0C and is a gas at room temperature. Like other alkynes, it is highly flammable and burns with a sooty flame. Therefore, based on its physical data and known chemical properties, Compound C is indeed a flammable gas.; answer - Yes, Compound C is a flammable gas.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 12 output: thinking - Sub-task 8 confirms D (mesitylene) gives two singlets. Sub-task 9 confirms F (2-amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene) is used in dye synthesis. Sub-task 11 confirms C (propyne) is a flammable gas. Sub-task 10 shows H (2,4,6-trimethylphenol) gives a purple/violet color with FeCl3, not yellow. Therefore the statement that H gives a yellow color is incorrect.; answer - C)"
