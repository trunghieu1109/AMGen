        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - Parallax is defined as the apparent angular shift of a star when observed from two positions of Earth six months apart (baseline ~1 AU). By definition, if a star has a parallax of 1 arcsecond, it lies at a distance of 1 parsec. In general, the formula linking parallax (plx, in arcseconds) and distance (r, in parsecs) is r = 1/plx, or equivalently plx = 1/r. This inverse relationship arises because as distance doubles, the observed angular shift halves.; answer - plx = 1/r\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - We know plx = 1/r, so 1/plx^5 = 1/(1/r)^5 = r^5. Thus the star count that varies as 1/plx^5 will vary as r^5 when expressed in terms of distance.; answer - ~ r^5\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - We know the observed star count variation is dN/d(plx) \u221d 1/plx^5. Since plx=1/r, we have d(plx)/dr=\u22121/r^2, so |d(plx)/dr|=1/r^2. The chain rule gives dN/dr = (dN/d(plx))\u00b7|d(plx)/dr| \u221d (1/plx^5)\u00b7(1/r^2). Substituting plx=1/r yields 1/plx^5=r^5, so dN/dr \u221d r^5\u00b7(1/r^2)=r^3. Thus the number of stars per unit distance scales as r^3, assuming a uniform distribution, complete sampling, and Euclidean geometry.; answer - ~ r^3\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - We have dN/d(plx)\u221d1/plx^5 and parallax plx=1/r. Using the chain rule, dN/dr = (dN/d(plx))\u00b7|d(plx)/dr|. Since |d(plx)/dr| = 1/r^2 and 1/plx^5 = r^5, we get dN/dr \u221d r^5\u00b7(1/r^2) = r^3. Among the given options (~r^2, ~r^4, ~r^3, ~r^5), this matches ~r^3.; answer - C)"
