Question: Example(question='In a specific region of the sky, astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?', choice1='~ r^2', choice2='~ r^4', choice3='~ r^3', choice4='~ r^5', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_192
proposed answer: We have dN/d(plx)∝1/plx^5 and parallax plx=1/r. Using the chain rule, dN/dr = (dN/d(plx))·|d(plx)/dr|. Since |d(plx)/dr| = 1/r^2 and 1/plx^5 = r^5, we get dN/dr ∝ r^5·(1/r^2) = r^3. Among the given options (~r^2, ~r^4, ~r^3, ~r^5), this matches ~r^3.
