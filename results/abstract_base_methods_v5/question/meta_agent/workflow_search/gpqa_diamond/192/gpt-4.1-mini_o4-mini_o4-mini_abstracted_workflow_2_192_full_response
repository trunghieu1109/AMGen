By definition, if a star has a parallax of 1 arcsecond, it lies at a distance of 1 parsec. In general, the formula linking parallax (plx, in arcseconds) and distance (r, in parsecs) is r = 1/plx, or equivalently plx = 1/r.

Substituting plx=1/r yields 1/plx^5=r^5, so dN/dr ∝ r^5·(1/r^2)=r^3.

We want the number of stars per unit distance, dN/dr.  Since plx=1/r, we have d(plx)/dr=−1/r^2, so |d(plx)/dr|=1/r^2.  Thus dN/dr = (dN/d(plx))·|d(plx)/dr| ∝ (1/(plx^5))·(1/r^2).  Substituting plx=1/r gives 1/(plx^5)=r^5, so dN/dr ∝ r^5·(1/r^2)=r^3.

This assumes a uniform, infinite distribution of stars in Euclidean space and a complete, unbiased sample. It ignores real-world effects like interstellar extinction, survey magnitude limits (Malmquist bias), clustering, binarity, and evolution in stellar density with distance. These factors can significantly alter the observed relation.; answer: ~ r³\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent xfv6, refining star count change with distance r, thinking: We know the observed star count variation is dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5.
