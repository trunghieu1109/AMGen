If astronaut A moves at speed v_A = 0.6c and astronaut B moves at v_B = 0.5c in the same direction (positive x), then the speed of A as seen by B is\n\nv_rel = (v_A - v_B) / (1 - v_A v_B / c^2).\n\nSubstituting v_A = 0.6c and v_B = 0.5c gives\n\nv_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / [1 - (0.6)(0.5)]\n      = 0.1c / (1 - 0.30)\n      = 0.1c / 0.70\n      ≈ 0.142857c\n\nRounding to two significant figures yields approximately 0.14c.; answer: v_rel = 0.14c\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent zhms, calculate relative velocity, thinking: To find the relative velocity of the two astronauts (one moving at u=0.6c and the other at v=0.5c in the same direction), we use the relativistic velocity addition (or subtraction) formula:\n\nv_rel = (u - v) / (1 - (u·v)/c²).\n\nSubstitute u=0.6c and v=0.5c:\n\nv_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6·0.5))\n       = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.30)\n       = 0.1c / 0.70\n       ≈ 0.142857c\n\nSo the relative speed is approximately 0.143c.; answer: v_rel = 0.143c\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent n5mo, calculate relative velocity, thinking: We use the relativistic velocity addition formula for one velocity relative to another: v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - v1*v2/c^2).

From Sub-task 3 we have γ₁ = 1.25 for the 2m astronaut and γ₂ ≈ 1.1547 for the 3m astronaut. Thus: E₁ = γ₁·(2m)·c^2 = 1.25·2m·c^2 = 2.5 m c^2, and E₂ = γ₂·(3m)·c^2 ≈ 1.1547·3m·c^2 ≈ 3.4641 m c^2. Summing gives E_total = E₁ + E₂ ≈ 2.5 m c^2 + 3.4641 m c^2 = 5.9641 m c^2, which we round to 5.96 m c^2.; answer: E_total ≈ 5.96 m c^2\n<SEPERATOR>\nCritic agent KGD8, providing feedback, thinking: The calculation correctly sums each astronaut’s relativistic energy in the lab frame to get E_total ≈ 5.96 m c². However, it has important limitations: 1) Frame dependence – the sum of energies changes if you switch to another inertial frame. 2) Neglect of interactions or binding energies – any potential energy between the astronauts is ignored. 3) No account of the system’s invariant (rest) mass – a proper relativistic treatment of the two-body system would combine total energy and total momentum via M_sys c² = √[(E₁+E₂)² – (p₁+p₂)² c²], yielding the system’s rest energy rather than just the lab-frame energy sum.; answer: E_total = 5.96 m c² in the lab frame, but for a complete relativistic description one should compute the invariant mass and include any interaction energies.\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent EkNP, refining total energy, thinking: To compute the total relativistic energy in the lab frame, we sum each astronaut’s energy E=γ\u2009m\u2009c².
