Question: Example(question='Two astronauts of masses 2m and 3m travel at relativistic speeds of 0.6 c and 0.5 c, respectively, in the positive x-direction. Here, c is the speed of light. What will be the relative speed and the total energy of the system?', choice1='v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2', choice2='v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2', choice3='v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2', choice4='v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_72
proposed answer: Using the relativistic velocity addition formula, v_rel = (0.6c−0.5c)/(1−0.6·0.5) ≈0.14c. Summing energies: E₁=γ₁·2m c² =1.25·2m c²=2.5m c², E₂=γ₂·3m c² ≈1.1547·3m c²≈3.464m c², so E_total≈5.964m c²≈5.96m c². Only choice A) matches both v_rel=0.14c and E=5.96mc².
