Question: Example(question='Compound A shows two signals in the proton NMR, a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. It undergoes monobromination to form compound B. B reacts with alcoholic KOH to form C, which has two geometrical isomers. The cis-isomer of C reacts with (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol to produce compound D. Identify compound D.', choice1='(1S,4R,5S,6S)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol', choice2='(1S,4R)-4,6,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol', choice3='(1S,4R,5S,6R)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol', choice4='(1S,4S)-4,6,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_5_115
proposed answer: The Diels–Alder reaction between the cis-isomer of C (cis-2-butene derivative) and (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol proceeds via the endo approach, placing the OH at C1 and all three methyl groups (at C4, C5, C6) syn to each other on the newly formed cyclohexene ring. Numbering the ring so that C1 bears the OH, C2–C3 is the double bond, and methyl substituents are at C4, C5, and C6, the stereochemical descriptors become C1 S, C4 R, C5 S, and C6 S. This matches exactly the configuration in choice1, (1S,4R,5S,6S)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol, making option A) the correct answer.
