Question: Example(question='Two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10^-9 sec and 10^-8 sec, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which one of the following options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?\n', choice1='10^-9 eV', choice2='10^-11 eV', choice3='10^-8 eV\n', choice4='10^-4 eV', correct_index=4)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_8_0
proposed answer: The energy uncertainty for the shorter‐lived state (τ≈10⁻⁹ s) is ΔE≈ħ/τ≈6.6×10⁻⁷ eV. To resolve two levels the separation must exceed this broadening. Among the options, only 10⁻⁴ eV (choice D) is significantly larger than 6.6×10⁻⁷ eV, so the levels can be clearly distinguished.
