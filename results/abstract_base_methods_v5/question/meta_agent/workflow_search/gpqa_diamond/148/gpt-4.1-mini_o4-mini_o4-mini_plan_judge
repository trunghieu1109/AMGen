Question: Example(question='You are analyzing a small peptidic compound that has been chemically synthesized. The 1H NMR spectrum of the crude compound appears consistent with the expected molecule, with the exception of two peaks that both correspond to the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar chemical shifts and roughly equal integrals (together they integrate to 1H - the expected integral); based on the coupling pattern, you can rule out spin-spin coupling as an explanation for the duplicate peaks. LC-MS analysis of the crude compound at elevated temperature shows two clearly defined peaks of equal intensities. Both peaks have the same mass spectrum, which is consistent with the expected molecule. What is the most likely explanation for these observations?', choice1='The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers', choice2='The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers', choice3="'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction", choice4='The compound is contaminated with a precursor', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: The duplicated α-proton signal (two peaks integrating to a single proton with identical coupling patterns) cannot arise from spin–spin artifacts or double coupling, and contamination would alter the mass. Enantiomers in an achiral NMR solvent and on a standard reversed-phase LC column are indistinguishable, so they would not give two separate NMR signals or two LC peaks. Instead, epimerization at the α-carbon produces a 1:1 mixture of diastereoisomers that have the same mass spectrum but different magnetic environments and retention times, matching all observations.
