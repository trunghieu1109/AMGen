The normalization factor is \u221a7. Dividing each coefficient by \u221a7 gives the normalized state.; answer - The normalized coefficients are (1+i)/\u221a7 for |up\u27e9 and (2\u2212i)/\u221a7 for |down\u27e9.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - The operator A is defined on the two\u2010dimensional spin space spanned by |up\u27e9 and |down\u27e9. Its matrix elements A_{ij} are given by \u0127/2 if i\u2260j, and zero otherwise. Labeling the basis states in order as (|up\u27e9, |down\u27e9), the diagonal elements A_{up,up} and A_{down,down} are zero, while the off\u2010diagonal elements A_{up,down} and A_{down,up} are both \u0127/2. Therefore, in this basis the 2\u00d72 matrix representation of A is\n\n[ [0,   \u0127/2],\n  [\u0127/2, 0  ] ].; answer - A = [[0, \u0127/2], [\u0127/2, 0]]\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - We start with A = [[0, \u0127/2], [\u0127/2, 0]]. To find eigenvalues \u03bb, solve det(A \u2013 \u03bbI) = (\u2013\u03bb)(\u2013\u03bb) \u2013 (\u0127/2)^2 = \u03bb^2 \u2013 (\u0127/2)^2 = 0, giving \u03bb = \u00b1\u0127/2.

A normalized solution is v\u207a = (1/\u221a2)[1, 1]\u1d40, i.e. (|up\u27e9 + |down\u27e9)/\u221a2.

From subtask 4 we have c+ = 3/\u221a14 and c\u2013 = (\u20131+2i)/\u221a14. Using the Born rule: P(+) = |c+|^2 = (3/\u221a14)^2 = 9/14 \u2248 0.643, and P(\u2013) = |c\u2013|^2 = |\u20131+2i|^2/14 = (1^2+2^2)/14 = 5/14 \u2248 0.357.

This gives \u27e8A\u27e9 = (\u0127/2)(a* b + b* a) = \u0127\u00b7Re(a* b). Here a* b = ((1\u2212i)(2\u2212i))/7 = (1\u22123i)/7, so Re(a* b) = 1/7. Therefore \u27e8A\u27e9 = \u0127/7.; answer - \u0127/7\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 7 output: thinking - We computed the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates v+ and v\u2013 of operator A to be P(v+)=9/14\u22480.643 and P(v\u2013)=5/14\u22480.357, and the average value \u27e8A\u27e9=\u0127/7.
