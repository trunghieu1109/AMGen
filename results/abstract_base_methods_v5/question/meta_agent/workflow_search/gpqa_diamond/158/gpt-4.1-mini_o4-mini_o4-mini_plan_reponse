            "Observations of a quasar across the electromagnetic spectrum are being carried out. Focusing on the near infrared and optical spectrum, there is a peak at wavelength of about 790 nm, and at shorter wavelengths < 790 nm the flux drops significantly.\n\nIf we lived in a universe defined by Lambda-CDM model such that the current Hubble constant is 70 km s^-1 Mpc^-1, matter density parameter is 0.3, dark energy density parameter is 0.7, and universe is flat,\nwhat can be assumed about the value of the comoving distance (for scale factor a=1) of this quasar from the Earth?",

Here \u03bb_obs = 790 nm and \u03bb_emit (Lyman-\u03b1) = 121.6 nm. Thus z = (790/121.6) \u2013 1 \u2248 6.497 \u2013 1 \u2248 5.497, which we round to z \u2248 5.5.; answer - z \u2248 5.5\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - The problem statement explicitly defines the cosmological model parameters for this Lambda-CDM universe. It states that the current Hubble constant is H0 = 70 km s^-1 Mpc^-1, the matter density parameter is \u03a9m = 0.3, and the dark energy density parameter is \u03a9\u039b = 0.7. Because it also specifies a flat universe, by definition \u03a9k = 1 \u2013 \u03a9m \u2013 \u03a9\u039b = 0. This set of parameters is internally consistent and matches the standard flat Lambda-CDM model widely used in cosmology.; answer - H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc, \u03a9m = 0.3, \u03a9\u039b = 0.7, flat universe (\u03a9k = 0)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - To compute the comoving distance D_C we use D_C=(c/H\u2080)\u222b\u2080\u1dbb dz\u2032/[\u03a9\u2098(1+z\u2032)\u00b3+\u03a9_\u039b]^\u00bd. With c/H\u2080\u2248(3\u00d710\u2075 km/s)/(70 km/s/Mpc)=4286 Mpc and z\u22485.5, we evaluate the integral by Simpson\u2019s rule (or a published cosmology calculator) to get a dimensionless value \u22431.87.
