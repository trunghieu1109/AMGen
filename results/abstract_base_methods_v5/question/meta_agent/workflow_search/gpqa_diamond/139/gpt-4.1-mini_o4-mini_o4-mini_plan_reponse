            "Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements, reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons, and a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K. The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. Calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.",

        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - We have a reagent X that contains a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements: this points to a deuterated analog of a common hydride reagent. Its reaction with liquid Y produces a gas W whose molecule has equal neutrons and protons\u2014i.e. D2 gas (two deuterons, each with one proton and one neutron). A precipitate G forms (Al(OD)3), which upon heating releases B, heavy water (D2O), whose melting point is \u2248276.97 K (\u22483.82 \u00b0C, close to 277 K). The close analog of X is LiAlH4, a classic reducing agent in organic chemistry; X itself must therefore be its deuterated counterpart, lithium aluminum deuteride, LiAlD4.; answer - Lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD4)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - From Sub-task 1 we identified Substance X as lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD4). When LiAlD4 reacts with liquid water, the deuteride anions (D\u2013) are protonated by water to release deuterium gas. Each deuterium nucleus (D) contains one proton and one neutron, so the D2 molecule has equal numbers of protons and neutrons. Therefore, gas W is D2 (deuterium gas).; answer - D2\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - Substance X has been identified as LiAlD\u2084. When LiAlD\u2084 reacts with a deuteron source, it liberates D\u2082 gas and forms an aluminum deuteroxide precipitate. The gas B released upon heating G is D\u2082O, whose melting point matches the clue. This requires that the original liquid Y provide deuterons, so Y must be D\u2082O. The solid precipitate G is the aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)\u2083, which on heating yields D\u2082O.; answer - Liquid Y is heavy water (D\u2082O) and precipitate G is aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)\u2083).\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - The melting point given (~277 K) closely matches that of heavy water (D\u2082O) at 276.97 K. Since precipitate G (aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)\u2083) releases B upon heating and we previously identified G as Al(OD)\u2083 formed from LiAlD\u2084 and D\u2082O, the only plausible volatile product is D\u2082O. Thus B must be heavy water, D\u2082O.; answer - B is D\u2082O (heavy water).\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - Substance X was identified as LiAlD4 in Sub-task 1. LiAlD4 donates deuteride (D\u2013) nucleophiles to carbonyls. When it reacts with a keto acid (R\u2013CO\u2013COOH), the deuteride attacks the ketone carbon, reducing C=O to C\u2013OD and yielding a deuterated hydroxy acid. The product retains the carboxyl O and gains the hydroxyl O, totaling two oxygen atoms. For example, with pyruvic acid (CH3\u2013CO\u2013COOH), LiAlD4 produces CH3\u2013CHD\u2013OH\u2013COOH (2-deuterio-2-hydroxypropanoic acid). This matches a product with two oxygens and confirms that X delivers deuteride, consistent with LiAlD4.; answer - The reaction yields a deuterated \u03b1-hydroxy acid (e.g. 2-deuterio-2-hydroxypropanoic acid), containing two oxygen atoms, confirming Substance X is LiAlD4.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 6 output: thinking - Substance X has been identified as lithium aluminum deuteride, LiAlD\u2084, which contains three elements/isotopes: lithium (Li, atomic mass ~7 u, atomic number 3), aluminum (Al, atomic mass ~27 u, atomic number 13), and deuterium (\u00b2H, atomic mass ~2 u, atomic number 1). Among these, deuterium (an isotope of hydrogen) has the lowest atomic number and mass, making it the lightest. Aluminum has the highest atomic number and mass of the three, making it the heaviest. This aligns with both the isotopic composition (heavy hydrogen isotope) and the analog reagent\u2019s known composition in organic chemistry.; answer - Lightest element: Deuterium (\u00b2H); Heaviest element: Aluminum (Al)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 7 output: thinking - Substance X is LiAlD\u2084. The lightest element is deuterium (\u00b2H) with atomic mass 2 u, and there are four deuterium atoms, so total mass = 4 \u00d7 2 = 8 u. The heaviest element is aluminum (Al) with atomic mass \u224827 u, present as one atom, so total mass = 27 u.; answer - Lightest (deuterium): 8 u; Heaviest (aluminum): 27 u\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 8 output: thinking - Sub-task 7 established that Substance X is LiAlD\u2084, containing four deuterium atoms (\u00b2H, each 2 u) and one aluminum atom (Al, 27 u). The cumulative mass of the lightest element (deuterium) is 4 \u00d7 2 = 8 u, and of the heaviest element (aluminum) is 27 u. Summing these gives 8 + 27 = 35 u. Among the provided choices\u201429, 25, 35, 31\u2014the correct answer is 35, which corresponds to choice C).; answer - C)"
