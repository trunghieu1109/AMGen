Question: Example(question='Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements, reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons, and a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K. The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. Calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.', choice1='29', choice2='25', choice3='35', choice4='31', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_139
proposed answer: Sub-task 7 established that Substance X is LiAlD₄, containing four deuterium atoms (²H, each 2 u) and one aluminum atom (Al, 27 u). The cumulative mass of the lightest element (deuterium) is 4 × 2 = 8 u, and of the heaviest element (aluminum) is 27 u. Summing these gives 8 + 27 = 35 u. Among the provided choices—29, 25, 35, 31—the correct answer is 35, which corresponds to choice C).
