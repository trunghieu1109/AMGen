Its reaction with liquid Y produces a gas W whose molecule has equal neutrons and protons—i.e. D2 gas (two deuterons, each with one proton and one neutron). A precipitate G forms (Al(OD)3), which upon heating releases B, heavy water (D2O), whose melting point is ≈276.97 K (≈3.82 °C, close to 277 K). The close analog of X is LiAlH4, a classic reducing agent in organic chemistry; X itself must therefore be its deuterated counterpart, lithium aluminum deuteride, LiAlD4.; answer - Lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD4)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - From Sub-task 1 we identified Substance X as lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD4). When LiAlD4 reacts with liquid water, the deuteride anions (D–) are protonated by water to release deuterium gas. Each deuterium nucleus (D) contains one proton and one neutron, so the D2 molecule has equal numbers of protons and neutrons. Therefore, gas W is D2 (deuterium gas).; answer - D2\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - Substance X has been identified as LiAlD₄. When LiAlD₄ reacts with a deuteron source, it liberates D₂ gas and forms an aluminum deuteroxide precipitate. The gas B released upon heating G is D₂O, whose melting point matches the clue. This requires that the original liquid Y provide deuterons, so Y must be D₂O. The solid precipitate G is the aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, which on heating yields D₂O.; answer - Liquid Y is heavy water (D₂O) and precipitate G is aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃).\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - The melting point given (~277 K) closely matches that of heavy water (D₂O) at 276.97 K. Since precipitate G (aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃) releases B upon heating and we previously identified G as Al(OD)₃ formed from LiAlD₄ and D₂O, the only plausible volatile product is D₂O. Thus B must be heavy water, D₂O.; answer - B is D₂O (heavy water).\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - Substance X was identified as LiAlD4 in Sub-task 1. LiAlD4 donates deuteride (D–) nucleophiles to carbonyls. When it reacts with a keto acid (R–CO–COOH), the deuteride attacks the ketone carbon, reducing C=O to C–OD and yielding a deuterated hydroxy acid. The product retains the carboxyl O and gains the hydroxyl O, totaling two oxygen atoms. For example, with pyruvic acid (CH3–CO–COOH), LiAlD4 produces CH3–CHD–OH–COOH (2-deuterio-2-hydroxypropanoic acid). This matches a product with two oxygens and confirms that X delivers deuteride, consistent with LiAlD4.; answer - The reaction yields a deuterated α-hydroxy acid (e.g. 2-deuterio-2-hydroxypropanoic acid), containing two oxygen atoms, confirming Substance X is LiAlD4.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 6 output: thinking - Substance X has been identified as lithium aluminum deuteride, LiAlD₄, which contains three elements/isotopes: lithium (Li, atomic mass ~7 u, atomic number 3), aluminum (Al, atomic mass ~27 u, atomic number 13), and deuterium (²H, atomic mass ~2 u, atomic number 1). Among these, deuterium (an isotope of hydrogen) has the lowest atomic number and mass, making it the lightest. Aluminum has the highest atomic number and mass of the three, making it the heaviest.

When LiAlD4 reacts with a proton source it liberates D2 gas and forms an aluminum deuteroxide precipitate corresponding to Al(OD)3. The gas B released upon heating G is D2O, confirming that the original liquid Y provided deuterons rather than protons. Therefore liquid Y must be heavy water D2O, and the precipitate G is aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)3.; answer: Liquid Y is heavy water (D2O) and precipitate G is aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)3).\n<SEPERATOR>\nCritic agent bk8V, feedback: The identification of liquid Y as heavy water (D₂O) and precipitate G as aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃) is consistent with the release of D₂ gas and subsequent liberation of D₂O upon heating. However, this conclusion rests on several assumptions: it presumes complete exchange of deuterides without any H/D scrambling, ignores the possibility of mixed hydroxide species if proton contamination is present, and assumes that Al(OD)₃ precipitates quantitatively rather than forming soluble complexes. Impurities in D₂O or in the LiAlD₄ reagent, as well as variations in temperature and pH, could lead to mixed Al–OH/OD products or partial conversion to Al₂O₃, altering both the gas evolved and the solid formed.; correct: Liquid Y is heavy water (D₂O) and precipitate G is aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, noting that isotopic purity and reaction conditions must be strictly controlled to avoid mixed hydroxide species and side reactions.\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent TNjO, refining identification, thinking: Substance X has been identified as LiAlD₄.
