Starting with 0.02 M complex and zero free ions, let x equal the concentration of complex that dissociates.  Then [Ca2+] and [EDTA4–] each increase by x, and [CaEDTA2–] decreases by x.; answer: Let x = [Ca2+]ₑq = [EDTA4–]ₑq.  Then [Ca2+] = x, [EDTA4–] = x, and [CaEDTA2–] = 0.02 – x.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent bcwm, defining variables and equilibrium concentrations, thinking: To set up the equilibrium concentrations we note that the only source of free Ca2+ and free EDTA4– is the partial dissociation of the 0.02 M CaEDTA2–. We thus let x be the amount of complex that dissociates. By stoichiometry each mole of dissociated complex produces 1 mol of Ca2+ and 1 mol of EDTA4–. Hence at equilibrium [Ca2+]=x, [EDTA4–]=x, and [CaEDTA2–]=0.02−x. These expressions directly follow from mass balance and the 1:1 dissociation stoichiometry.; answer: Let x=[Ca2+]eq.

The given stability constant (treated here as K = [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]/[CaEDTA²⁻]) yields the equilibrium expression K = x·x/(0.02 – x) = x²/(0.02 – x).

However, this formulation assumes ideal behavior (activities ≈ concentrations), neglects ionic strength and activity coefficients, and presumes EDTA is fully deprotonated (valid only at sufficiently high pH). It also ignores other potential metal–EDTA complexes and relies on the approximation x ≪ 0.02, which may not strictly hold for very large K values.; answer: K = [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]/[CaEDTA²⁻] ⇒ x²/(0.02 – x) = 5×10¹⁰\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent ubDG, refining equilibrium expression, thinking: For the dissociation reaction CaEDTA²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻, the formation (stability) constant is defined as K = [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]/[CaEDTA²⁻].

Since Kf = 5×10^10, we have Kd = 2×10^−11. From sub‐task 3 (correcting for the inverse), the equation is\n  x^2/(0.02 – x) = 2×10^−11.\nBecause Kd is so small, x ≪ 0.02, so 0.02 – x ≈ 0.02. Thus:\n  x^2 ≈ 0.02 × 2×10^−11 = 4×10^−13\n  x ≈ √(4×10^−13) = 6.3×10^−7 M\nHence the free [Ca2+] is 6.3×10^−7 M.; answer: 6.3×10^−7 M\n<SEPERATOR>\nCritic agent 0Zie, providing feedback, thinking: The algebraic solution x^2/(0.02–x)=2×10^–11 with the approximation 0.02–x≈0.02 is mathematically sound for Kd≪c, but it has several limitations:\n1) The approximation x≪0.02 M must hold; if [Ca2+] were higher, the neglected term could introduce error.\n2) It assumes ideal behavior (activity coefficients=1); real ionic strength effects can alter Kf/Kd.\n3) It ignores EDTA protonation equilibria at non‐ideal pH, which lowers effective binding.\n4) It neglects competing metal ions or side reactions that can reduce free Ca2+.\nThus the result is valid only under ideal dilute, single‐metal, fully deprotonated EDTA conditions.; answer: 6.3×10^−7 M\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent DlHj, refining solution, thinking: Starting from the dissociation equilibrium: CaEDTA²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻, the dissociation constant Kd = 1/Kf = 1/(5×10¹⁰) = 2×10⁻¹¹.
