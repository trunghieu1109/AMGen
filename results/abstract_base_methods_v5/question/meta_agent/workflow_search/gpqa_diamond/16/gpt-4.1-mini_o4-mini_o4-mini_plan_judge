Question: Example(question='What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex (we assume that the pH is ideal, T = 25 °C). KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10.', choice1='1.0x10^-2 M ', choice2='5.0x10^-3 M', choice3='6.3x10^-7 M', choice4='2.0x10^-2 M ', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_29_16
proposed answer: From the equilibrium constant KCa-EDTA = [CaEDTA]/([Ca2+][EDTA]) = 5×10^10 and the total Ca-EDTA concentration of 0.02 M, we derived free [Ca2+] = [EDTA]·[Ca2+]/[CaEDTA] ≈ 6.3×10^-7 M. Comparing this result to the given options: A) 1.0×10^-2 M, B) 5.0×10^-3 M, C) 6.3×10^-7 M, D) 2.0×10^-2 M, only choice C exactly matches the calculated value.
