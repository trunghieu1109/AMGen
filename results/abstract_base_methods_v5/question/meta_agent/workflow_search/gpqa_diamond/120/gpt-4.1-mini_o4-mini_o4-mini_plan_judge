Question: Example(question='When saturated epoxides are reacted with organocuprates, the alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring. In the disubstituted epoxides, inversion of configuration occurs at a carbon to which Nu is added. Identify the product when (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo [4.1.0] heptane is reacted with Me2CuLi:', choice1='(1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol', choice2='(1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol ', choice3='(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol ', choice4='(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol ', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_38_120
proposed answer: The organocuprate opens the epoxide at the less hindered carbon (original C6) with inversion of configuration (S to R). The other stereocenters remain as in the starting material (all R). After ring opening and renumbering (hydroxyl at C1, new Me at C2), all four centers are R. This matches option C: (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.
