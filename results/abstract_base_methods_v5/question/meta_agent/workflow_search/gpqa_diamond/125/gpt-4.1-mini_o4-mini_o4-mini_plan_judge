Question: Example(question='An organic chemist performs two reactions.\nReaction I:\n(S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup.\nReaction II:\nPentane-2,4-dione is treated with excess NaBH4 followed by an acidic workup.\nThe progress of the reactions is monitored using TLC. After the reactions are 100% completed, the products from both reactions are combined, and run on both a normal-phase HPLC column and an HPLC column packed with the chiral stationary phase.\nHow many peaks does the chemist observe in the chromatograms?', choice1='3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC', choice2='5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC', choice3='4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC', choice4='3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_56_125
proposed answer: From Reaction I we get two diastereomers (2 peaks on normal HPLC) and two enantiomers resolve into two separate peaks on chiral HPLC. From Reaction II we get a meso diol plus an enantiomeric pair. On normal HPLC the meso and the enantiomeric pair (coeluting) give 2 peaks; on chiral HPLC the meso gives one peak and each enantiomer resolves, yielding 3 peaks. Total normal-phase peaks: 2 + 2 = 4. Total chiral-phase peaks: 2 + 3 = 5. Therefore the correct choice is 5 peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC, corresponding to choice B).
