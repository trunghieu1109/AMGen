Question: Example(question='A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory? Take the speed of light in vacuum c=1.', choice1='(1+n*v)/(n-v)\n\n\n', choice2='(1-n*v)/(n+v)\n\n', choice3='(1+n*v)/(n+v)\n\n', choice4='1', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: We derived the lab‐frame speed of light in the moving glass by using the relativistic velocity addition formula. In the glass rest frame, light travels at u′=1/n. The glass moves at velocity v relative to the lab frame in the same direction. The lab‐frame speed u is given by u=(v+u′)/(1+v u′)= (v+1/n)/(1+v/n). Multiplying numerator and denominator by n yields u=(1+n v)/(n+v). Comparing with the provided choices:
A) (1+n v)/(n−v) has a minus in the denominator—wrong sign.
B) (1−n v)/(n+v) has a minus in the numerator—wrong.
C) (1+n v)/(n+v) exactly matches our result.
D) 1 is only true if v=0 or n=1, not generally. 
Therefore the correct choice is C).
