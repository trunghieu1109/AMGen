        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The sub-task asks to list and define each physical quantity and condition given in the problem statement. We have a block of glass moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as an incident light beam, with refractive index n, and we use natural units where the vacuum light speed c=1. The observer is in the laboratory frame. Thus, we identify: (1) n: refractive index of the glass, dimensionless, ratio of c to phase velocity inside glass. (2) v: speed of the glass relative to the laboratory frame, directed along the beam toward the observer, with |v|<c=1. (3) Direction: the glass moves in the same direction as the light beam, i.e., along the beam\u2019s propagation direction toward the observer. (4) c=1: the speed of light in vacuum set to unity for convenience.; answer - n: refractive index of the glass (dimensionless), defined as the ratio of the vacuum light speed to the phase velocity inside the medium; v: velocity of the glass relative to the laboratory frame, directed along the beam\u2019s propagation toward the observer (with |v|<c=1); direction: the glass moves in the same direction as the light beam, i.e., toward the observer; c=1: the speed of light in vacuum, set to unity in natural units.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - In the glass\u2019s rest frame, the phase velocity of light is reduced by the refractive index n. By definition, n = c/v_medium. With c=1 in our units, the speed of light in the medium is v_medium = c/n = 1/n.; answer - 1/n\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - In the glass\u2019s rest frame the light travels at speed u\u2032=1/n. To find its speed u in the laboratory frame where the glass moves at speed v in the same direction, we use the relativistic velocity\u2010addition formula: u=(u\u2032+v)/(1+u\u2032v). Substituting u\u2032=1/n gives u=(v+1/n)/(1+v/n)=(n v+1)/(n+v). This matches choice 3.; answer - (1+n*v)/(n+v)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - Starting from the lab\u2010frame result u=(v+1/n)/(1+v/n), multiply numerator and denominator by n to get u=(n v+1)/(n+v). This matches exactly option 3, written as (1+n*v)/(n+v). Hence the simplified form corresponds to choice C) in the given list.; answer - C)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - We derived the lab\u2010frame speed of light in the moving glass by using the relativistic velocity addition formula. In the glass rest frame, light travels at u\u2032=1/n. The glass moves at velocity v relative to the lab frame in the same direction. The lab\u2010frame speed u is given by u=(v+u\u2032)/(1+v\u2009u\u2032)= (v+1/n)/(1+v/n). Multiplying numerator and denominator by n yields u=(1+n\u2009v)/(n+v).
