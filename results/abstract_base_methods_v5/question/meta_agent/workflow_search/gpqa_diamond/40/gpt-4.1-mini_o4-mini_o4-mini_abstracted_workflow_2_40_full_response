We have a block of glass moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as an incident light beam, with refractive index n, and we use natural units where the vacuum light speed c=1.

To find its speed u in the laboratory frame where the glass moves at speed v in the same direction, we use the relativistic velocity‐addition formula: u=(u′+v)/(1+u′v).

However, it assumes that the refractive index n is the same in both frames (i.e.\nnon‐dispersive, frequency‐independent medium) and neglects any Doppler‐induced changes in n or anisotropy that arise when the glass moves. It also presumes v<c and motion strictly along the beam axis. In realistic dispersive media or at high speeds, the frequency shift seen in the moving glass would alter n, so the simple form no longer holds.; answer: The result holds only for a non‐dispersive, homogeneous medium with fixed n in its rest frame, moving parallel to the beam at subluminal speed; it breaks down if dispersion or Doppler‐shift effects change n.\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent KTG7, refining simplification, thinking: Starting from the lab‐frame result u=(v+1/n)/(1+v/n), multiply numerator and denominator by n to get u=(n v+1)/(n+v).
