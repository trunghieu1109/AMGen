Question: Example(question='Which of the following issues are the most common sources of difficult-to-spot erroneous results generated in genomics data analysis:\n\n- Mutually incompatible data formats\n- The "chr" / "no chr" confusion\n- Reference assembly mismatch\n- Incorrect ID conversion', choice1='3 and 4', choice2='2 and 3', choice3='All of the above', choice4='2, 3 and 4', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_167
proposed answer: Based on the evaluation of common error sources in genomics data analysis, the “chr”/“no chr” confusion (issue 2) and reference assembly mismatch (issue 3) are the most frequent and impactful problems leading to subtle, hard-to-detect errors. Among the provided options, choice 2 (“2 and 3”) corresponds exactly to these two issues, which maps to the multiple‐choice answer B.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_167
proposed answer: We need to identify which of the four listed issues—1) incompatible data formats, 2) “chr”/“no chr” confusion, 3) reference assembly mismatch, and 4) incorrect ID conversion—are the most common, difficult-to-spot error sources in genomics analyses. Consensus and widespread experience show that all four can independently derail analyses and are routinely encountered. Although one could rank them, no subset option captures all three highest-ranked without omitting a key source. The only choice that ensures coverage of every major pitfall is “All of the above.”
