Question: Example(question='Consider a quantum mechanical system containing a particle of mass $m$ moving in an istropic three dimensional potential of the form $V(r) = 1/2 m \\omega^2 r^2$ corresponding to the acted force obeying Hooke’s law. Here, $\\omega$ is the angular frequency of oscillation and $r$ is the radial distance of the particle from the origin in spherical polar coordinate. What is the value of energy of the third excited state, and how many linearly independent eigenfunctions are possible for the same energy eigenvalue?', choice1='(9/2) \\hbar \\omega , 10', choice2='(9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 3', choice3='11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 10', choice4='11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 3', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: For a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator the energy levels are E_N=(N+3/2)ħω with degeneracy g(N)=(N+1)(N+2)/2. The third excited state corresponds to N=3, giving E=(3+3/2)ħω=(9/2)ħω and g(3)=(4×5)/2=10. Among the given options only choice1 (A) matches both (9/2)ħω and 10.
