        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The given potential V(r)=\u00bdm\u03c9\u00b2r\u00b2 is the hallmark of a harmonic oscillator with isotropic (spherically symmetric) restoring force in three dimensions. \u201c\u03c9\u201d is the angular frequency setting the strength (curvature) of the potential and determining the spacing of energy levels. \u201cr\u201d is the radial coordinate in spherical coordinates, i.e. the distance of the particle from the origin.; answer - The system is the three-dimensional isotropic quantum harmonic oscillator: a single particle of mass m in a spherically symmetric potential V(r)=\u00bdm\u03c9\u00b2r\u00b2, where \u03c9 is the angular frequency of oscillation and r is the radial distance from the origin.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - In the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy eigenvalues arise from quantizing each Cartesian degree of freedom or equivalently solving in spherical coordinates with radial quantum number n_r=0,1,2,\u2026 and angular momentum quantum number l=0,1,2,\u2026. The total number of oscillator quanta is N = 2n_r + l. Each quantum contributes \u210f\u03c9 and there is a zero\u2010point energy of 3/2 \u210f\u03c9 (one half quantum for each of the three dimensions). Thus the general energy eigenvalue is E_{n_r,l} = (N + 3/2)\u210f\u03c9 = (2n_r + l + 3/2)\u210f\u03c9.; answer - E_{n_r,l} = (2n_r + l + 3/2)\u210f\u03c9  (equivalently E_N = (N + 3/2)\u210f\u03c9 with N = 2n_r + l)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - In the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator the energy levels are given by E_N = (N + 3/2)\u0127\u03c9 with N = 2n_r + l. The ground state is N=0 (0th excited), the 1st excited is N=1, 2nd excited N=2, and the 3rd excited corresponds to N=3. Substituting N=3 into E_N yields E = (3 + 3/2)\u0127\u03c9 = (9/2)\u0127\u03c9. This result assumes an ideal infinite quadratic potential, neglecting anharmonicities, external fields, spin interactions, and relativistic effects which could shift or lift the degeneracy of these levels.; answer - Quantum number N = 3; Energy E = (9/2) \u0127\u03c9\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - In a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator the energy levels are labeled by the total quantum number N=n_x+n_y+n_z (or equivalently N=2n_r+l). The degeneracy g(N) counts all distinct (n_x,n_y,n_z) triplets summing to N, which is given by the combinatorial formula g(N)=(N+1)(N+2)/2. For the third excited state N=3, this yields g(3)=(3+1)(3+2)/2=4\u00d75/2=10. Equivalently, one can classify states by radial (n_r) and orbital (l) quantum numbers with 2n_r+l=3: the l=3 multiplet contributes 2l+1=7 states and the l=1 multiplet contributes 3 states, for a total of 10. Thus, under ideal isotropic conditions the third excited state is tenfold degenerate.; answer - 10\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - For a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator the energy levels are E_N=(N+3/2)\u0127\u03c9 with degeneracy g(N)=(N+1)(N+2)/2. The third excited state corresponds to N=3, giving E=(3+3/2)\u0127\u03c9=(9/2)\u0127\u03c9 and g(3)=(4\u00d75)/2=10.
