For wavelengths \u03bb much larger than the size of the spheroid, the lowest nonvanishing term is the electric dipole aligned along z. In the radiation zone the angular distribution of a z-directed dipole is proportional to sin^2\u03b8, where \u03b8 is the angle from the z-axis, and the total radiated power scales as \u03c9^4 (Larmor formula), i.e. \u221d\u03bb^(\u20134).

The maximum occurs at \u03b8=90\u00b0 (sin^2\u03b8=1).; answer - For Sub-task 1: The spheroidal oscillation reduces to a z-oriented electric dipole in the far field. Its radiation pattern is f(\u03bb,\u03b8)\u221d(sin^2\u03b8)/\u03bb^4, showing the \u03bb^(\u20134) dependence from the Larmor formula and the sin^2\u03b8 angular dependence for a dipole about the z-axis.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - From sub-task 1 we identified that for \u03bb much larger than the spheroid size, the far\u2010field is dominated by the electric dipole oscillating along z. The classical Larmor formula gives the total radiated power scaling as \u03c9^4, hence \u221d\u03bb^(\u20134). The angular distribution of a z\u2010directed dipole is proportional to sin^2\u03b8, vanishing on the axis and peaking at \u03b8=90\u00b0. Combining these, the radiated power per unit solid angle must factor into a \u03b8\u2010dependent part sin^2\u03b8 and a \u03bb\u2010dependent part \u03bb^(\u20134). Any constant prefactor is set by the dipole moment amplitude, but the functional dependence is uniquely f(\u03bb,\u03b8) \u221d sin^2\u03b8/\u03bb^4.; answer - f(\u03bb,\u03b8) \u221d sin^2\u03b8 / \u03bb^4\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - From Sub-task 2 we have the angular pattern f(\u03bb,\u03b8)\u221dsin\u00b2\u03b8/\u03bb\u2074 with its maximum at \u03b8=90\u00b0 where sin\u00b290\u00b0=1. The fraction of the maximum at a general \u03b8 is f(\u03bb,\u03b8)/f(\u03bb,90\u00b0)=sin\u00b2\u03b8.

This arises because an oscillating electric dipole radiates power proportional to \u03c9\u2074 (Larmor formula), and since \u03c9 = 2\u03c0c/\u03bb, the power scales as (2\u03c0c/\u03bb)\u2074 \u221d \u03bb\u207b\u2074. Thus the exponent of \u03bb in f(\u03bb,\u03b8) is -4. This conclusion relies on the dipole approximation (particle size \u226a \u03bb), far-field limit, linear medium, and neglect of higher multipoles; if \u03bb becomes comparable to the spheroid dimensions or if dispersion/nonlinear effects occur, additional \u03bb-dependencies would appear.; answer - -4\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - From the angular dependence we have f(\u03bb,\u03b8)/A \u223c sin\u00b2\u03b8, so at \u03b8=30\u00b0 sin\u00b230\u00b0 = (1/2)\u00b2 = 1/4.
