General theory of multipole radiation gives that the power radiated by an electric multipole of order l scales as ω^(2l+2) (i.e. ∝λ^(−2l−2)) and the angular distribution is given by the square of the corresponding spherical harmonic Y_lm. For l=1 (electric dipole) the pattern ∝|Y_10|^2∝sin^2θ and power ∝ω^4→λ^(−4). For l=2 (electric quadrupole) the pattern ∝|Y_20|^2∝(3\u2009cos^2θ−1)^2 (a four-lobed structure) and power ∝ω^6→λ^(−6).

Electric dipole radiation (l=1) has a characteristic angular dependence E∝p̈×n∝sinθ, so the power per solid angle ∝|E|^2∝sin^2θ.  Its total radiated power scales as ω^4|p|^2 (where ω=2πc/λ), so P_dipole∝ω^4∝λ⁻⁴.  \n2.

The question asks for the fraction of the maximum power (A) at θ=30°. For dipole the maximum occurs at θ=90° where sin^2θ=1, so the fraction at 30° is sin^2(30°)/1=(½)^2=1/4. For quadrupole the maximum of sin^2θ\u2009cos^2θ is 1/4 (at θ=45°), so the normalized fraction is [sin^2(30°)\u2009cos^2(30°)]/(1/4)=(¼·¾)/(¼)=3/4.; answer: Dipole: 1/4; Quadrupole: 3/4\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent 9yXu, calculating angular power fraction at 30 degrees, thinking: We use the angular patterns from Sub‐task 1b: Dipole ∝sin^2θ, Quadrupole ∝sin^2θ·cos^2θ.
