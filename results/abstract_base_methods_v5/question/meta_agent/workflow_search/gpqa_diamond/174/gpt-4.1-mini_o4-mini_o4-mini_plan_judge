Question: Example(question='Consider an oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis). Because it oscillates, it would radiate at a wavelength \\lambda. In the radiation zone, the radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of \\lambda and the angle \\theta (with z-axis), along which the power is measured. If the maximum power thus radiated is A, the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle \\theta = 30^0 and a possible form of f are, respectively,', choice1='1/2, \\lambda^(-4)', choice2='3/4, \\lambda^(-6)', choice3='1/4, \\lambda^(-4)', choice4='1/4, \\lambda^(-3)', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: From the angular dependence we have f(λ,θ)/A ∼ sin²θ, so at θ=30° sin²30° = (1/2)² = 1/4. From the wavelength dependence we found f ∝ 1/λ⁴. Combining these gives f(λ,θ) = A·sin²θ/λ⁴, and at θ=30° the fraction of A is 1/4. This exactly matches choice 3 (“1/4, λ⁻⁴”), which corresponds to option C).

proposed answer: For a small spheroidal oscillation acting as an electric dipole, the radiation pattern in the far field is I(θ) ∝ sin²θ and the total radiated power scales as ω⁴ ∝ λ⁻⁴. The peak radiation occurs at θ = 90°, where sin²θ = 1. At θ = 30°, sin²30° = (1/2)² = 1/4, so the fraction of the maximum power is 1/4. The wavelength dependence of the power is λ⁻⁴. Among the provided options, choice 3 corresponds exactly to 1/4 and λ⁻⁴, which is labeled as C).
