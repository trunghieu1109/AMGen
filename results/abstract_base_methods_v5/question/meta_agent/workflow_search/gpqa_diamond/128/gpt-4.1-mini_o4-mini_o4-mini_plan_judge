proposed answer: The IR carbonyl stretch shifting from ~1750 cm⁻¹ (typical of a strained cyclopentanone) down to ~1715 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a less-strained six-membered ketone (cyclohexanone). Mechanistically, diazotization of the 4-amino-4-hydroxycyclopentane (C) yields an α-diazonium intermediate (D) that loses N₂ to form a tertiary carbocation. A subsequent 1,2-alkyl migration (Wagner–Meerwein or semipinacol rearrangement) expands the five-membered ring to six-membered, and tautomerization restores the ketone. The two methyl groups originally at C-1 and C-2 of the cyclopentane end up at C-3 and C-4 of the cyclohexanone. All three independent lines of reasoning (mechanism, rearrangement pattern, IR shift) converge on 3,4-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one as compound E.

proposed answer: All intermediate structures align with the given data and known mechanisms:  
1. A’s strong 1750 cm⁻¹ carbonyl stretch and Wittig product identify it unambiguously as 3,4-dimethylcyclopentan-1-one.  
2. HCN addition yields the racemic cyanohydrin 1-hydroxy-1-cyano-3,4-dimethylcyclopentane (B) with no changes to ring size or substitution.  
3. H₂/Pd selectively reduces the –C≡N to –CH₂NH₂, giving the racemic aminoalcohol 1-(aminomethyl)-1-hydroxy-3,4-dimethylcyclopentane (C).  
4. HNO₂ converts the primary amine into the unstable diazonium salt 1-(diazomethyl)-1-hydroxy-3,4-dimethylcyclopentane (D) without loss of N₂.  
5. Extrusion of N₂ triggers a semipinacol-type rearrangement: a neighboring C–C bond migrates to the carbocation center, expanding the five-membered ring to a six-membered ring. The resulting ketone’s IR shift from ~1750 to ~1715 cm⁻¹ matches cyclohexanone derivatives.  
6. Among the four choices, only 3,4-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one (choice D) fits both the mechanistic ring expansion and the observed carbonyl stretch.  
Thus, all assignments are consistent and compound E must be 3,4-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.
