Question: Example(question='Identify the possible product when (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene undergoes Cope rearrangement.', choice1='4,4a,7,7a-tetrahydro-1H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine', choice2='4,4a,5,7a-tetrahydro-3H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine', choice3='4,6,7,7a-tetrahydro-3H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine', choice4='4,4a,5,6-tetrahydro-1H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_185
proposed answer: The Cope rearrangement of (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene proceeds via a suprafacial [3,3]-sigmatropic shift that forges new C–C and C–N bonds while retaining the bridgehead stereochemistry (1S,4R). In the norbornene-derived system, the N-vinyl terminus reacts with the C5–C6 π bond to produce a fused cyclopentane–pyridine skeleton. Analysis of the newly formed bicyclic product shows saturation at positions 4, 4a, 5, and 7a, with the remaining unsaturation localized in the pyridine ring as a 3H tautomer. Among the provided choices, only 4,4a,5,7a-tetrahydro-3H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine matches both the regiochemistry and the degree of saturation predicted for the Cope rearrangement product. Therefore, the correct choice is B).

proposed answer: The Cope rearrangement of (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene proceeds via a concerted [3,3]-sigmatropic shift that opens the bicyclic framework and forms a fused cyclopentane–dihydropyridine. Mechanistic and stability considerations rule out all but the fully conjugated 1H-dihydropyridine tautomer with unsaturations positioned to maximize conjugation with the ring nitrogen and avoid bridgehead double bonds:

1. Regioselectivity: Only the pathway leading to double bonds at C4a–C5 and C7–C7a preserves a continuous π-system and avoids Bredt’s-rule violations. Alternatives place double bonds at bridgeheads or disrupt conjugation.
2. Tautomer preference: The 1H-dihydropyridine is strongly favored over 3H tautomers by conjugation and minimized ring strain. 3H forms require nonconjugated double bonds and higher energy.
3. Literature precedent: Known Cope rearrangements of 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1] systems consistently give the 1H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine product with unsaturation at 4,4a and 7,7a.

All four independent analyses converge uniquely on option A as the only mechanistically plausible and thermodynamically favored product.
