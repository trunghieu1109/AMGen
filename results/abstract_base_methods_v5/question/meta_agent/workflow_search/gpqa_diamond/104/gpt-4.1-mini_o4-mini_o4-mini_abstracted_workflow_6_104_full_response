The total emitted flux is proportional to T^4, so: Teff^4 = 0.8×6000^4 + 0.2×5000^4 = 0.8×1.296×10^15 + 0.2×6.25×10^14 = 1.0368×10^15 + 1.25×10^14 = 1.1618×10^15.

From sub-task 2, the spotted hemisphere emits 0.896 F_unspotted per unit area. Since both hemispheres have the same projected area, F_max=1.000 (in units of the unspotted hemisphere flux) and F_min=0.896. Thus the peak‐to‐peak fractional variation is (F_max–F_min)/F_max=1–0.896=0.104, i.e. a 10.4% brightness swing.; answer - ≈0.104 (about 10.4% fractional brightness variation)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - The observed photometric modulation from the spotted hemisphere has an amplitude of about 0.104 (i.e., a 10.4% flux drop).

By Stefan–Boltzmann, flux F∝T^4. So the ratio F_sp/F_un=(5835/6000)^4. Numerically, 5835/6000≈0.9725, its square ≈0.9458, and the fourth power ≈0.894. Thus the spotted hemisphere emits only ≈89.4% of the flux of the unspotted hemisphere. Equivalently, the brightness difference ∆F/F_un=1–0.894≈0.106, i.e. a 10.6% decrease.; answer: The spotted hemisphere’s brightness is about 0.894 times that of the unspotted hemisphere, corresponding to a ≈10.6% flux reduction.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent uMXP, calculating brightness difference, thinking: We use the Stefan–Boltzmann law: F=σT^4. The unspotted hemisphere radiates at 6000\u2009K, so F_un∝6000^4. The spotted hemisphere has an effective temperature Teff≈5835\u2009K from subtask 1, so F_sp∝5835^4. Taking the ratio: (5835/6000)^4≈0.9725^4. Numerically 0.9725^2≈0.9458, and (0.9458)^2≈0.8945. Thus the spotted hemisphere emits ≈89.45% of the flux of the unspotted hemisphere, i.e. a flux deficit of ≈10.55%. Because both hemispheres have the same area, this directly gives the brightness difference.; answer: The spotted hemisphere is ∼89.5% as bright as the unspotted one, corresponding to a ∼10.5% drop in flux.\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent qUnW, calculating brightness variation amplitude, thinking: We found in subtask 2 that the cooler (spotted) hemisphere emits only about 89.6% of the flux of the unspotted side, i.e. a 10.4% drop per unit area. As the star rotates, we alternately see either the unspotted hemisphere (maximum flux, F_max) or the spotted hemisphere (minimum flux, F_min). Since the visible hemisphere always subtends the same projected area, the fractional amplitude of the brightness variation is simply ΔF/F_max = (F_max – F_min)/F_max = 1 – 0.896 ≃ 0.104. In other words, the star’s total measured brightness will swing by about 10.4% between the two extremes.; answer: ≈0.104 (about a 10.4% fractional brightness variation)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCritic agent WWOz, providing feedback, thinking: The calculation properly uses the blackbody flux scaling (∝T^4) to show that spots at 5000\u2009K emit (5000/6000)^4≈0.482 of the unspotted intensity. With a 20% spot filling, the spotted hemisphere’s flux is 0.2×0.482+0.8×1≈0.896 of an unspotted hemisphere, so the brightness swing is (1−0.896)≈0.104. This is both correct and complete (one could simply note the T^4 dependency explicitly).; answer: The calculation is correct.\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent qUnW, refining brightness variation amplitude, thinking: We want the fractional amplitude of the light curve as the star rotates between showing the unspotted hemisphere (flux F_max) and the spotted hemisphere (flux F_min). From sub-task 2, the spotted hemisphere emits 0.896 F_unspotted per unit area. Since both hemispheres have the same projected area, F_max=1.000 (in units of the unspotted hemisphere flux) and F_min=0.896. Thus the peak‐to‐peak fractional variation is (F_max–F_min)/F_max=1–0.896=0.104, i.e. a 10.4% brightness swing.; answer: ≈0.104 (about 10.4% fractional brightness variation)\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent fQl7, round 0, calculating radius ratio Rpl/Rstar, thinking: The observed photometric modulation from the spotted hemisphere has an amplitude of about 0.104 (i.e. a 10.4% drop when the spotted side is in view). If such a dip were instead caused by a transiting exoplanet across an unspotted star, the transit depth δ would equal the square of the radius ratio: δ=(R_pl/R_star)^2. Setting δ=0.104 gives R_pl/R_star=√0.104≈0.322.

For an unspotted star, a transiting planet produces a dip δ=(Rpl/Rstar)^2 equal to the fractional loss of light. Setting δ=0.104 gives Rpl/Rstar=√0.104≈0.322.

For a transit of an unspotted star, the depth δ≈(Rpl/Rstar)² must equal this amplitude.
