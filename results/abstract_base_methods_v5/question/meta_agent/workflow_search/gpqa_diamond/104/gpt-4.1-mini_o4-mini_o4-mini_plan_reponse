            "Astronomers are currently observing a star with a radius equal to that of the Sun. One  hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The star has an effective temperature (Teff) of 6000K, and the spots exhibit a temperature difference of 1000K. As only one hemisphere is spotty, photometric time-series observations will reveal periodic variations in brightness due to rotational modulation. Interestingly, this situation can closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet. To produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!), what should be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the radius of the host star (i.e. Rpl/Rstar)?",

        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - We compute the effective temperature of the spotted hemisphere by combining the contributions of the unspotted photosphere at 6000\u2009K and the cooler spots at 5000\u2009K, weighted by their surface filling factors (0.8 and 0.2, respectively). The total emitted flux is proportional to T^4, so: Teff^4 = 0.8\u00d76000^4 + 0.2\u00d75000^4 = 0.8\u00d71.296\u00d710^15 + 0.2\u00d76.25\u00d710^14 = 1.0368\u00d710^15 + 1.25\u00d710^14 = 1.1618\u00d710^15. Taking the fourth root gives Teff \u2248 (1.1618\u00d710^15)^(1/4) \u2248 5835\u2009K.; answer - \u22485835\u2009K\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - To find the flux difference between the spotted and unspotted hemispheres, we use the Stefan\u2013Boltzmann law: F=\u03c3T\u2074. From sub\u2013task 1, the spotted hemisphere has Teff\u22485835 K, the unspotted side is 6000 K. Thus per unit area:\n \u2022 F_un=\u03c3\u00b76000\u2074=\u03c3\u00b71.296\u00d710\u00b9\u2075\n \u2022 F_sp=\u03c3\u00b75835\u2074\u2248\u03c3\u00b71.1618\u00d710\u00b9\u2075\n\nThe ratio is F_sp/F_un=1.1618/1.296\u22480.896, so the spotted hemisphere emits ~89.6% of the unspotted flux. The relative brightness difference is \u0394F/F_un=1\u20130.896\u22480.104, i.e. about a 10.4% decrease in flux on the spotted side.; answer - The spotted hemisphere emits ~89.6% of the flux of the unspotted hemisphere, corresponding to a brightness reduction of \u224810.4%.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - We want the fractional amplitude of the light curve as the star rotates between showing the unspotted hemisphere (flux F_max) and the spotted hemisphere (flux F_min). From sub-task 2, the spotted hemisphere emits 0.896 F_unspotted per unit area. Since both hemispheres have the same projected area, F_max=1.000 (in units of the unspotted hemisphere flux) and F_min=0.896. Thus the peak\u2010to\u2010peak fractional variation is (F_max\u2013F_min)/F_max=1\u20130.896=0.104, i.e. a 10.4% brightness swing.; answer - \u22480.104 (about 10.4% fractional brightness variation)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - The observed photometric modulation from the spotted hemisphere has an amplitude of about 0.104 (i.e., a 10.4% flux drop). For an unspotted star, a transiting planet yields a depth \u03b4=(R_pl/R_star)^2. Setting \u03b4=0.104 gives R_pl/R_star=\u221a0.104\u22480.322. This matches choice B (~0.32).; answer - B)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - From sub-task 4 we found the equivalent transit depth \u03b4 = 0.104, implying R_pl/R_star = \u221a0.104 \u2248 0.322. Comparing this to the provided choices (~0.07, ~0.32, ~0.11, ~0.39), the value 0.322 is essentially identical to ~0.32. Therefore the closest match is choice B.; answer - B)"
