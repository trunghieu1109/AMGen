They assume: 1) Activities equal concentrations (no ionic strength or activity‐coefficient corrections). 2) Only the four defined complexes form (no hydrolysis, precipitation, or alternative ligand binding). 3) Free [Co²⁺] and [SCN⁻] can be treated as independent variables (ignoring mass‐balance coupling and ligand depletion at high complexation). 4) Equilibrium is fully established (no kinetic or time‐dependent effects). 5) The cumulative constants βn are valid under the given temperature and ionic conditions (no temperature or medium changes). Under real conditions, deviations from ideality, side reactions, and activity‐coefficient effects can lead to errors if these simplifications are not corrected for.; answer: These limitations arise because the βn definitions come from equilibrium thermodynamics assuming ideal dilute solutions and no competing reactions. In practice: • Ionic strength alters activity coefficients, so [SCN⁻]active ≠ [SCN⁻]analytic. • SCN⁻ can undergo protonation or oxidation, and Co²⁺ can hydrolyze, reducing free ligand or metal. • When complexation is strong and ligand is not in large excess, the free‐ligand approximation breaks down, requiring simultaneous solution of mass‐balance equations rather than direct insertion of total concentrations. • Kinetic inertness or slow exchange may prevent attainment of true equilibrium, invalidating equilibrium‐based formulas. • The reported βn values apply only at specific temperatures and solvent compositions; changes to these conditions will shift equilibria and render the simple expressions inaccurate without recalibration.\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent mhmP, refining complex concentrations, thinking: By definition, the overall (cumulative) stability constant βn for the formation of Co(SCN)n from free Co2+ and n SCN– is given by βn = [Co(SCN)n^(2–n)]/([Co2+][SCN–]^n).
