Question: Example(question='In an experiment, compound X (C11H12O) was subjected to a reaction with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in nonpolar solvent at a temperature of 403 K for a duration of 1 day. The theoretical 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectra of the resulting product reveal the following signal patterns.\n1H NMR: δ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s), 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).\n13C NMR: δ 21.3 (1C, s), 28.4 (1C, s), 126.9 (2C, s), 127.1 (1C, s), 129.1 (2C, s), 130.3 (1C, s), 141.5 (1C, s), 144.1 (1C, s), 197.7 (1C, s).\nIdentify Compound X.', choice1='2-styrylepoxide', choice2='2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane', choice3='2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane', choice4='2-methyl-3-styryloxirane', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_78
proposed answer: The NMR data reveal two methyl singlets, trans-alkene doublets (J ≈ 16 Hz), a para-disubstituted aromatic pattern, and a carbonyl at δ 197.7 ppm, indicative of an α,β-unsaturated ketone formed by semipinacol rearrangement of a p-methylstyryl epoxide. Only the 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane starting material (choice B) possesses the para-methylbenzene styryl epoxide required to give these signals.

Answer:B)
