Question: Example(question='You have prepared an unknown compound. To identify the product, you have used the following characterisation techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers. Two other strong absorption peaks are observed at 1700 and 1650 wavenumbers. Several peaks were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum including peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens. The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45. Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O2.', choice1='C6H10O2', choice2='C6H12O', choice3='C6H10O', choice4='C6H12O2', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_36_112
proposed answer: The combined data points to an α,β‐unsaturated carboxylic acid. The m/z 45 fragment (COOH⁺) confirms a carboxyl group (2 O atoms). FTIR shows a broad O–H stretch near 3000 cm⁻¹ and a strong C=O stretch at 1700 cm⁻¹ plus a C=C stretch at 1650 cm⁻¹. ¹H NMR reveals vinyl protons (5.2–6.5 ppm) and a COOH proton (11–12 ppm), requiring both a double bond and a COOH on a six‐carbon backbone. This gives three degrees of unsaturation (one C=O, one C=C, one extra), matching C₆H₁₀O₂. Other formulas either lack sufficient oxygens or the required unsaturation. Therefore the correct formula is C₆H₁₀O₂.
