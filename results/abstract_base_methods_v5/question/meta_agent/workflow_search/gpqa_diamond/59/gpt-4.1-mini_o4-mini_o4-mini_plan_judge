Question: Example(question='An intelligent civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud has engineered an extraordinary spacecraft capable of traveling at a substantial fraction of the speed of light. The average lifetime of these aliens is roughly 150 solar years.  Now, having Earth as their destination in mind, they are determined to travel with this spacecraft at a constant speed of 0.99999987*c, where c is the speed of light. Approximately, how long will it take for their 22 years old astronaut (from the point of view of the astronaut) to reach the Earth using this incredibly fast spacecraft?', choice1='72 years', choice2='The astronaut will die before reaching to the Earth.\n', choice3='77 years', choice4='81 years', correct_index=4)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_39_59
proposed answer: The astronaut’s proper travel time is t_proper = t_lab/γ. The lab-frame travel distance is roughly 163,000 light-years at v=0.99999987 c, so t_lab ≈ 163,000 yr. The Lorentz factor γ ≈ 1/√(1 – β²) ≈ 1960. Thus t_proper ≈ 163,000 yr / 1960 ≈ 83.2 yr. Since 83.2 yr is well below the average alien lifetime of 150 yr, the astronaut survives the journey. Among the provided options (72 yr, die, 77 yr, 81 yr), 81 yr (choice D) is the closest to the calculated 83.2 yr.
