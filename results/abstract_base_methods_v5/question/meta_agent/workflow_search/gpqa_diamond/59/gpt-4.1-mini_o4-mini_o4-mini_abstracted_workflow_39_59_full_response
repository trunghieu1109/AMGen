This is well below the average lifetime of 150\u2009yr, so the astronaut survives. Among the choices (72, “die,” 77, 81), 81\u2009yr is closest to the calculated 83.16\u2009yr.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent IApM:\nWe found the astronaut’s proper travel time t_proper ≃ 163,000\u2009ly/0.99999987\u2009c ÷ γ (1960) ≃ 83.2\u2009yr, which is under the 150\u2009yr average lifetime. Thus the astronaut survives.

This is well below the aliens’ average lifetime of 150\u2009years, so the astronaut will survive the journey. Next, we compare 83.2\u2009years to the given choices: 72, 77, 81, or “die before reaching.” The closest value to 83.2 is 81\u2009years, corresponding to choice D.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent mOqD:\nThe proper time is t_proper = t_lab/γ ≈ (163,000 years)/(1960) ≈ 83.2 years.

Astronomical measurements place its distance at roughly 160 000 light-years from Earth (often cited between 160 000 and 163 000 ly depending on method).

First compute β²≈(0.99999987)²≈0.99999974, so 1−β²≈2.6×10⁻⁷. Then √(1−β²)≈√(2.6×10⁻⁷)≈5.1×10⁻⁴, giving γ≈1/(5.1×10⁻⁴)≈1.96×10³.

These approximations mean the 83 yr proper time is only a first‐order ideal result, not a full mission profile.; answer: ≈83 years (ignoring acceleration/deceleration, cosmic expansion, gravity, and other practical constraints)\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent A2Mz, refining proper travel time, thinking: First, compute the travel time in the Earth (lab) frame.
