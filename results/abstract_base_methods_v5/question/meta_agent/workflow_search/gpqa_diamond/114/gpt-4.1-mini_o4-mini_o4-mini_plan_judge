Question: Example(question='An electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is also moving along the horizontal axis, but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After colliding, both annihilate producing 2 photons.\n\nThe energies of both photons were measured and they have the same value. The directions were also measured. One of the photons was moving in the upper-right direction, while another in the lower-right direction.\n\nWhat is the angle between the directions of the photons?', choice1='96', choice2='74', choice3='138', choice4='172', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: We start with the electron (γ₁=4) moving right and the positron (γ₂=2) moving left. Their momenta are p₁=m c√15 to the right and p₂=m c√3 to the left, giving total momentum pₜₒₜ=m c(√15−√3). The total energy is Eₜₒₜ=(γ₁+γ₂)m c²=6m c², so each photon carries E_γ=3m c² and momentum p_γ=3m c. If the photons are emitted at angles ±θ to the x-axis, conservation of x-momentum requires 2p_γ cosθ=pₜₒₜ ⇒6m c cosθ=m c(√15−√3) ⇒cosθ=(√15−√3)/6≈0.3568 ⇒θ≈69.07°. The opening angle between the photons is Δφ=2θ≈138.14°, which matches option C.
