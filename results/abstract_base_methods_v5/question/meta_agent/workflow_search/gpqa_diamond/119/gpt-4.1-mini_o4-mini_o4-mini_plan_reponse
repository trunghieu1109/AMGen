        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - Stellar parallax is the apparent annual shift of a star\u2019s position due to Earth\u2019s orbital motion. By definition, one parsec (pc) is the distance at which a star would have a parallax of one arcsecond when observed from opposite sides of Earth\u2019s orbit (a baseline of 2\u2009AU). Using the small-angle approximation, the distance d (in parsecs) and the parallax p (in arcseconds) are inversely related: d = 1/p. Hence if p decreases by a factor, d increases by the reciprocal factor.; answer - d = 1 / plx\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - The volume of a sphere of radius d is V = (4/3)\u03c0d^3. Since stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number of stars within distance d is proportional to this volume, so N \u221d d^3. Substituting the parallax relation d = 1/plx gives V \u221d (1/plx)^3 = plx^(\u20133). Thus the volume\u2014and hence the total number of stars out to parallax p\u2014grows as the cube of the distance (or falls off as p^3).; answer - Volume increases as the cube of the distance: V \u221d d^3 (or V \u221d 1/plx^3).\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - We assume a uniform spatial distribution of stars so that the number within a sphere of radius d grows with its volume: N(d)=k\u00b7V= k\u00b7(4/3)\u03c0d^3\u221dd^3. Parallax and distance are inversely related (in parsecs and arcseconds) by d=1/plx. Substituting into N(d) gives N(plx)=k\u00b7(1/plx)^3\u221dplx^(\u20133). Therefore the number of stars per unit range of parallax scales as plx^(\u20133).; answer - N(d)\u221dd^3, hence N(plx)\u221dplx^(\u20133)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - From Sub-task 3 we have the cumulative number of stars N as a function of parallax plx scaling as N(plx) \u221d plx^(\u20133). To find the number per unit parallax interval, we differentiate N with respect to plx: dN/dplx = d[C\u00b7plx^(\u20133)]/dplx = \u20133C\u00b7plx^(\u20134).
