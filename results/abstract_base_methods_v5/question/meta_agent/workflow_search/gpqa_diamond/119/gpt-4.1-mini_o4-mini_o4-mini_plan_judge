Question: Example(question='Let us assume stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. In this scenario, how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx?', choice1='~ 1/plx^3', choice2='~ 1/plx^2', choice3='~ 1/plx^1', choice4='~ 1/plx^4', correct_index=4)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_15_119
proposed answer: From Sub-task 3 we have the cumulative number of stars N as a function of parallax plx scaling as N(plx) ∝ plx^(–3). To find the number per unit parallax interval, we differentiate N with respect to plx: dN/dplx = d[C·plx^(–3)]/dplx = –3C·plx^(–4). Taking the magnitude for the density yields a dependence ∝ 1/plx^4. This matches choice 4.
