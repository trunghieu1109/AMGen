Question: Example(question='In an inactive state, a transcription factor subunit awaits an activation signal from the membrane phosphorylation cascade. Upon phosphorylation on the Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, shuttles into the nucleus, and serves in gene transcription. A missense mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. You observe that a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Which of the following molecular phenotypes is most likely observed in the presence of mutation Y?', choice1='loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype', choice2='protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype', choice3='protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele', choice4='change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_24_157
proposed answer: A dominant-negative mutation in the dimerization domain must retain the ability to bind wild-type subunits but render the resulting complexes inactive, effectively “poisoning” the normal protein’s function. Choice 1 is wrong because loss of dimerization fails to sequester wild-type; choice 3 is incorrect since degradation doesn’t explain inhibition of the remaining allele via complex formation; choice 4 is a gain-of-function, opposite to the observed loss of transcriptional activity. Choice 2 (“protein aggregation and loss-of-function”) best approximates the dominant-negative mechanism by describing mutant–wild-type complexes that are nonfunctional (often insoluble or misfolded) and thereby abolish overall transcription factor activity.
