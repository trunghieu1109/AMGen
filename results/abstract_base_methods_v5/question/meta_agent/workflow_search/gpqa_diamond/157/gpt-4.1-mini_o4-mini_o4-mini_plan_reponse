            "In an inactive state, a transcription factor subunit awaits an activation signal from the membrane phosphorylation cascade. Upon phosphorylation on the Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, shuttles into the nucleus, and serves in gene transcription. A missense mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. You observe that a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Which of the following molecular phenotypes is most likely observed in the presence of mutation Y?",

        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The transcription factor has two key functional regions: the transactivation domain and the dimerization domain. The transactivation domain contains serine residues that, upon phosphorylation by the membrane-linked kinase cascade, undergo a conformational change allowing the factor to become competent for dimerization. Phosphorylation here is essential for activation, nuclear import, and recruitment of the basal transcription machinery once bound to DNA. The dimerization domain mediates pairing of two monomers\u2014only dimers can expose nuclear localization signals and bind target DNA sequences with high affinity. Thus, phosphorylation in the transactivation domain triggers dimerization via the dimerization domain, leading to nuclear translocation and gene transcription.; answer - The transactivation domain is phosphorylated on Ser residues to enable activation, and the dimerization domain mediates subunit pairing required for nuclear import and DNA-binding during gene transcription.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - The transactivation domain normally contains Ser residues phosphorylated by the signaling cascade, which is required for the conformational change that exposes the dimerization interface and nuclear localization signal. A missense mutation in this domain (mutation X) that is recessive and loss-of-function likely alters a critical Ser or its surrounding motif, preventing phosphorylation. Without this phosphorylation, the transcription factor cannot undergo the conformational change needed for dimerization, nuclear import, or recruitment of transcriptional coactivators. Because one wild-type allele still produces a functional phosphorylatable domain, heterozygotes remain phenotypically normal (haplosufficient), but homozygotes lose all transcriptional activity.; answer - Mutation X disrupts phosphorylation in the transactivation domain, abolishing activation: the transcription factor cannot dimerize or translocate to the nucleus, and fails to initiate gene transcription (loss of function in homozygotes; no effect in heterozygotes).\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - Mutation Y lies in the dimerization domain, so the mutant monomer still partners with the wild-type monomer but yields a dimer that cannot adopt the active conformation, translocate to the nucleus, or bind DNA. In a heterozygote this means the mutant subunit \u2018poisons\u2019 the wild-type by forming nonfunctional mixed dimers, sequestering the wild-type protein and preventing assembly of functional homodimers. This dominant-negative mechanism produces a loss-of-function phenotype despite one normal allele.; answer - Mutation Y produces a mutant monomer that dimerizes with the wild-type monomer to form nonfunctional heterodimers, thereby sequestering the wild-type protein and preventing functional dimer formation (dominant-negative).\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - Dominant-negative mutations in dimerization domains typically act by allowing the mutant subunit to still bind its wild-type partner but producing a nonfunctional heterodimer (\u201cpoisoning\u201d the complex). This differs from: 1) loss-of-dimerization mutations, which can\u2019t bind at all and usually behave like simple haploinsufficiency; 2) aggregation mutants, which misfold and form insoluble inclusions; 3) degradation mutants, which are rapidly degraded and reduce overall protein levels; and 4) conformational/gain-of-function mutants, which acquire new activity rather than simply inactivating the wild-type. In a heterozygote, only the dominant-negative mechanism explains the strong loss-of-function despite normal total protein levels.; answer - Dominant-negative mutations in a dimerization domain preserve binding to the wild-type subunit but yield inactive heterodimers that sequester the wild-type protein, unlike loss-of-dimerization (no binding), aggregation (inclusion formation), degradation (low protein levels), or conformational gain-of-function mutations.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - A dominant-negative mutation in the dimerization domain must retain the ability to bind wild-type subunits but render the resulting complexes inactive, effectively \u201cpoisoning\u201d the normal protein\u2019s function.
