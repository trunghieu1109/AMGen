Here r^2 F_r = r^2·(1/r^2)=1, so its radial derivative ∂_r(1)=0.

By the divergence theorem, ∫_V ∇·f\u2009dV = ∮_S f·dS over the sphere of radius R. Here f = (1/r^2)e_r, dS = r^2sinθ\u2009dθ\u2009dφ\u2009e_r, so f·dS = sinθ\u2009dθ\u2009dφ. Integrating θ from 0 to π and φ from 0 to 2π gives 4π. Thus the volume integral of the divergence is 4π.; answer: 4π\n<SEPERATOR>\nCritic agent HpDv, feedback: The evaluation is both correct and complete. Since f(r)=e_r/r^2 has zero divergence everywhere except at the origin, the volume integral of ∇·f over the sphere reduces via the divergence theorem to the surface integral ∮ f·dS. On a sphere of radius R, f·dS = (1/R^2)(R^2 sinθ dθ dφ) = sinθ dθ dφ, which integrates to 4π. The singularity at the origin is properly accounted for by this surface flux.; correct: 4 π\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent WMm1, refining volume integral, thinking: First, from Sub-task 2 we have ∇·f=0 everywhere except at the origin, where the 1/r^2 singularity resides. By the divergence theorem, the volume integral of the divergence over the sphere equals the surface flux of f through the sphere at radius R: ∫_V ∇·f dV = ∮_S f·dS. On the sphere f=(1/R^2)e_r and dS=R^2 sinθ dθ dφ e_r, so the integrand is sinθ dθ dφ. Integrating θ from 0 to π and φ from 0 to 2π gives 4π.

On the sphere of radius R, f = (1/r^2) e_r and dS = r^2 sinθ dθ dφ e_r, so f·dS = (1/R^2)·R^2 sinθ dθ dφ = sinθ dθ dφ. Integrate θ from 0 to π and φ from 0 to 2π: ∫_0^{2π}∫_0^π sinθ dθ dφ = 2π·2 = 4π.

By the Divergence Theorem, this equals the flux of f through the boundary surface S: ∫_V ∇·f dV = ∮_S f·dS. Here f(r)= (1/r^2) e_r, and on the sphere r=R the outward normal is e_r and dS = R^2 sinθ dθ dφ. Thus f·dS = (1/R^2)e_r·(e_r R^2 sinθ dθ dφ)= sinθ dθ dφ. Integrate over θ from 0 to π and φ from 0 to 2π: ∮ f·dS = ∫_0^{2π}∫_0^π sinθ dθ dφ = (2π)(2)=4π.

Here f = (1/r²) e_r and the sphere surface at radius R has dS = e_r R² sinθ dθ dφ. Thus on S: f·dS = (1/R²)(R² sinθ dθ dφ) = sinθ dθ dφ. Integrating over θ from 0 to π and φ from 0 to 2π gives ∫₀^{2π}∫₀^π sinθ dθ dφ = (2)(2π) = 4π.

The discrepancy arises because ∇·f has a hidden singularity at the origin, namely ∇·(r̂/r²)=4π\u2009δ³(r). Including this δ‐function gives ∫_V ∇·f\u2009dV=4π, in exact agreement with the surface‐flux result.; answer: When the singularity at the origin is properly included (∇·f=4π\u2009δ³(r)), both the volume integral of the divergence and the surface‐flux integral equal 4π.\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent rhgF, round 0, compare integrals, thinking: The field f(r)=1/r^2 e_r has zero divergence everywhere except at the origin, where the 1/r^2 singularity contributes a point source. Direct volume integration of ∇·f ignoring the origin gives zero, but the divergence theorem equates the volume integral to the surface flux through the sphere at r=R, yielding 4π. The only way these results can be consistent is if ∇·f contains a 4π δ^3(r) term. In that case, integrating ∇·f over the sphere picks up exactly 4π from the delta function at the origin, matching the surface flux. Thus there is no inconsistency once the singularity is treated as a delta function source.; answer: Both integrals agree: they each equal 4π, consistent with ∇·f=4π δ^3(r).\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent JkQ2, round 0, compare integrals, thinking: The volume integral of ∇·f over the sphere was computed via the divergence theorem and found to equal the surface flux, 4π. Although ∇·f=0 everywhere away from the origin, the 1/r² singularity at r=0 contributes a point source (a Dirac delta) whose integrated strength is 4π. Thus the direct volume integral (accounting for the delta at the origin) and the surface‐flux evaluation both yield 4π with no inconsistency. This matches Gauss’s law: ∫V ∇·f\u2009dV = ∮S f·dS = 4π.; answer: Both integrals agree at 4π, showing the origin singularity contributes a delta‐function source of strength 4π and ensuring consistency via Gauss’s theorem.\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent QmN7, round 0, compare integrals, thinking: The field f(r)=e_r/r^2 has zero divergence everywhere except at the origin, where the 1/r^2 singularity contributes a δ-function term. When we compute the volume integral ∫_V∇·f\u2009dV directly (excluding the origin) we get zero, but that ignores the singular point. By the divergence theorem, ∫_V∇·f\u2009dV=∮_S\u2009f·dS, and evaluating the surface flux on a sphere of radius R gives 4π. This nonzero result exactly captures the contribution of the singularity at the origin, equivalent to integrating a 4π\u2009δ^3(r) source term. Thus the apparent inconsistency is resolved by recognizing the δ-function at the origin, and both methods agree once the singularity is properly handled.; answer: Both the volume integral (with the δ-function at the origin included) and the surface flux integral give 4π; they agree and correctly account for the singularity.\n<SEPERATOR>\nFinal Decision agent on integral comparison, thinking: The naive volume integral of ∇·f over the sphere (ignoring r=0) gives zero because ∇·(r̂/r²)=0 for r>0.
