Question: Example(question='A vector field f(r) falls off radially as 1/r^2 from the origin, i.e. the magnitude of the field is f(r) = 1/r^2. The field has non-zero component only along  the radial direction in spherical coordinates. Evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of the field, ∇.f inside the volume of a sphere of radius R centred at the origin. Here, ∇ and f both are implied as vectors. Which answer below is the most appropriate one for the answer of the integral?', choice1='1', choice2='4 π', choice3='0', choice4='4/3 π R ', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_15_135
proposed answer: From Sub-task 5 we found the volume integral of ∇·f (including the δ-function at the origin) equals the surface flux 4π. Among the given choices (A) 1, (B) 4π, (C) 0, (D) 4/3 π R, the correct value is 4π, which corresponds to choice B).
