            "You want to study the role of the GADD45G protein in a mouse model. You are highly interested in whether the IL-2-induced protein has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. You decide to create a transgenic mouse model with the inducible overexpression of the coding sequence for the GADD45G gene. You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus. For that purpose, you will modify the gene's coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein. You genetically engineer the plasmid and, aided by Lipofectamine\u00ae, transfect it into the Chinese hamster ovary cells. You select the antibiotic-resistant cell colonies to test the expression level of your construct. Once you begin, you observe that you are unable to overexpress your protein as you expected. In the series of tests you undertake to identify the cause, you realize that the sequence of the plus strand of your construct reads:\n\n\n5'ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'\n\nYou annoyingly notice the reason.",

        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The provided sequence begins with an ATG start codon at nucleotides 1\u20133, indicating the start of the open reading frame. Immediately following this, the next nine codons (nucleotides 4\u201331) encode the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) epitope: TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCT translates to YPYDVPDYA. The HA tag is thus fused directly to the N-terminus of the recombinant protein, occupying amino acids 2 through 10 of the polypeptide (with the initial Met as residue 1). The reading frame continues uninterrupted through the rest of the coding region until the terminal TGA stop codon at the 3\u2032 end of the sequence. This confirms that the HA tag is correctly positioned at the N-terminus within the full-length coding sequence.; answer - The coding sequence runs from the initial ATG at nucleotide positions 1\u20133 through the terminal TGA stop codon at the 3\u2032 end of the construct. The influenza hemagglutinin (HA) epitope (YPYDVPDYA) is encoded immediately downstream of the start Met, spanning nucleotides 4\u201331 (amino acids 2\u201310) at the N-terminus of the recombinant protein.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - To verify the reading frame, I translated the sequence codon by codon starting at the ATG. The first 11 codons encode the HA\u2010tag (YPYDVPDYA) plus an additional lysine (K) from the AAA codon. However, the next codon is TGA, which is a stop codon. This means translation terminates immediately after the HA tag, preventing any downstream GADD45G sequence from being expressed. The presence of this premature TGA explains the lack of full\u2010length protein.; answer - MYPYDVPDYAK*\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - Translation of the first nine codons after the start Met yields Y\u2013P\u2013Y\u2013D\u2013V\u2013P\u2013D\u2013Y\u2013A, which exactly matches the canonical HA epitope sequence YPYDVPDYA with no amino acid substitutions. The only sequence deviation is an extra Lys (K) encoded immediately after the HA tag (from the AAA codon), followed by a TGA stop codon that truncates the protein. There are therefore no missense mutations within the nine\u2013amino\u2013acid HA determinant itself.; answer - No missense mutations in the HA tag: residues 2\u201310 translate to the canonical YPYDVPDYA sequence exactly; however, an extra Lysine follows the epitope and a premature stop codon truncates the protein.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - The nucleotide sequence begins with ATG (M) and the HA tag codons, translating to MYPYDVPDYAK. Immediately following this, the next codon is TGA, a stop codon, so the ribosome terminates translation right after the HA tag. This prevents any downstream GADD45G protein sequence from being synthesized, explaining why no full-length protein is detected.; answer - The translated protein contains a premature stop codon (TGA) immediately after the HA tag (MYPYDVPDYAK*), causing early termination of translation and preventing overexpression of the full-length protein.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - Sub-task 1 established that the HA epitope (YPYDVPDYA) is fused immediately to the N-terminus of GADD45G with no intervening residues. This means the HA tag and GADD45G\u2019s native N-terminus are in direct contact. Such rigid fusions often misfold or expose unnatural peptide junctions that are recognized by cellular quality control factors and targeted by proteases. A short flexible linker (e.g., Gly-Ser repeats) would spatially separate the tag from the protein, allowing each domain to fold independently and hiding potential protease cleavage sites. Without this linker, the tag\u2013protein junction is vulnerable, leading to rapid proteolytic degradation of the nascent chain and low steady-state levels of the recombinant protein.; answer - Yes, the absence of a flexible linker between the HA tag and GADD45G likely leads to proteolytic degradation of the fusion protein.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 6 output: thinking - In eukaryotes (including mouse), UAA is a standard stop codon recognized by eukaryotic release factors (eRF1/eRF3) rather than any tRNA. No tRNA with an anticodon complementary to UAA exists in any system, because stop codons are not read by tRNAs. Translation termination at UAA is therefore normal and does not require a matching tRNA. Thus suggesting that \u201ctranslation terminates early because no tRNA exists for UAA\u201d misunderstands how stop codons work. The ribosome halts at UAA due to release factor binding, not because a tRNA is missing. The premature stop codon after the HA tag (TGA\u2009=\u2009UGA in mRNA, another stop) is sufficient to explain early termination.; answer - It is not biologically plausible that translation stops at UAA due to a missing tRNA; instead stop codons are recognized by release factors, so the early termination is simply because a stop codon was introduced right after the HA tag.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 7 output: thinking - Sequence analysis of the engineered construct shows that immediately after the influenza HA antigenic determinant (YPYDVPDYA) and an extra lysine, the next codon is TGA, which is an in-frame stop codon. This premature stop causes the ribosome to terminate translation right after the tag, preventing synthesis of any downstream GADD45G sequence. There are no missense mutations in the HA sequence, linker absence alone wouldn\u2019t cause total loss of protein, and translation termination at stop codons is mediated by release factors rather than missing tRNAs. Thus, the failure to overexpress the protein is due to early termination of translation caused by the introduced stop codon.; answer - B)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 8 output: thinking - Analysis of the engineered construct sequence reveals that immediately after the influenza HA tag (YPYDVPDYA) plus an extra lysine residue, the next codon is TGA, which is an in\u2010frame stop codon. This premature stop codon causes the ribosome to terminate translation right after the tag, preventing any downstream GADD45G sequence from being synthesized. None of the other options explain complete loss of expression as convincingly as early termination by a stop codon.; answer - B)"
