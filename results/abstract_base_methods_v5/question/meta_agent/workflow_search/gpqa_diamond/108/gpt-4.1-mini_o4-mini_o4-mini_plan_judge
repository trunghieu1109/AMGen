Question: Example(question='Consider a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state which emit a particle X of intrinsic parity -1. Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2).\n\nSuppose the final NN state has T(NN) = 0. Which of the following partial waves is not permitted, where the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X? Make use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity.\n\nNote that the term symbol (e.g. 1S0) is in general defined (2S+1)L(J), where S is the total spin, L the total orbital angular momentum written in spectroscopic notation, and J the total angular momentum.', choice1='1S0 -> 3P0 + s', choice2='1S0 -> 7D1 + p', choice3='1S0 -> 3D3 + f', choice4='1S0 -> 3S1 + p', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: We combine the constraints from Pauli statistics, total angular momentum conservation, and parity conservation for each candidate transition from the initial 1S0 NN state (J=0, positive parity) emitting a particle X of intrinsic parity –1:

1) Pauli statistics (T(NN)=0) require S+L+1 ≡ 0 mod 2.  Evaluate S and L for each final NN partial wave:
   • 3P0: S=1, L=1 ⇒ 1+1+1=3≡1 ⇒ T=1 ⇒ conflicts with T=0 ⇒ forbidden.
   • 7D1: S=3, L=2 ⇒ 3+2+1=6≡0 ⇒ T=0 ⇒ allowed.
   • 3D3: S=1, L=2 ⇒ 1+2+1=4≡0 ⇒ T=0 ⇒ allowed.
   • 3S1: S=1, L=0 ⇒ 1+0+1=2≡0 ⇒ T=0 ⇒ allowed.

2) Total angular momentum conservation (initial J=0): In all four cases the NN final J can couple with the emitted particle’s orbital ℓ to yield total J=0, so no further restriction.

3) Parity conservation (initial +1): Final parity = (−1)^{L+ℓ+1} must be +1 ⇒ L+ℓ must be odd. For 3P0+s, L=1, ℓ=0 ⇒ sum=1 (odd) so parity is satisfied. Likewise parity is satisfied for the other three transitions.

Thus the only forbidden channel is the 1S0→3P0+s transition due to violation of the Pauli‐statistics constraint.
