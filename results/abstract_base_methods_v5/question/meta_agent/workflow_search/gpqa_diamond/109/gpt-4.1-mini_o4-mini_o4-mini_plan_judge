Question: Example(question="Which of the following stars can be detected with both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at the Keck Observatory? Please refer to the links below for more information about the observatories. It should be noted that with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed, while with HIRES, stars brighter than 16 V mag can be observed. For the sake of simplicity, let's disregard the pointing limits of the telescopes (such as maximum and minimum elevations) as well as the altitudes of the telescopes.\n\nLinks:\nParanal Observatory: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranal_Observatory\nW.

proposed answer: We computed the apparent V magnitudes and checked against the instrument limits (ESPRESSO V<17 mag; HIRES V<16 mag) and the shared declination range (–70.2° to +65.4°). Only Star5 (m≈15.0, Dec=+60°) satisfies both sets of constraints. None of the given choices lists only Star5: A) Star1 & Star4, B) Star4 & Star5, C) Star2 & Star3, D) Star3 & Star5. Therefore, none of the provided multiple-choice answers is correct.

Answer:None of the above
Extracted answer: None of the above
Correct answer: 4

proposed answer: The final list of stars observable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES is Star3 and Star5. Comparing this to the provided options:
A) Star1 and Star4  → does not match
B) Star4 and Star5  → does not match
C) Star2 and Star3  → does not match
D) Star3 and Star5  → matches exactly
Therefore the correct choice is D).

Answer:D)
Extracted answer: D)
