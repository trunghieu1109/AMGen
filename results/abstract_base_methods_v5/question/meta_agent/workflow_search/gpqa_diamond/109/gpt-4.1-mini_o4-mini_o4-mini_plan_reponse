Star1 and Star4 are at 10 pc so their distance modulus is zero; Star5 at 5 pc has m=M+5log(0.5)=M\u22121.505. Stars 3 and 4 have extinction: A_V3=3.1\u00d70.6=1.86, A_V4=3.1\u00d70.4=1.24.

No extinction given, so A_V=0. Thus m_V = 15.5 + 0 + 0 = 15.5.\n\nStar4: M_V=15.5, d=10\u2009pc gives DM = 0. E(B\u2013V)=0.4 \u2192 A_V = 3.1\u00d70.4 = 1.24.

Hence m_V = 16.5 \u2212 1.505 + 0 \u2248 14.995 \u2248 15.0.; answer - Star1: m_V = 15.5; Star4: m_V = 16.74; Star5: m_V \u2248 15.0\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - From Sub-task 2 we have the apparent V magnitudes: Star1 = 15.5, Star2 = 16.5, Star3 = 17.36, Star4 = 16.74, Star5 = 15.0. ESPRESSO detects stars with V < 17, so it can observe Star1, Star2, Star4, and Star5. HIRES detects stars with V < 16, so it can observe only Star1 and Star5. This ignores pointing constraints, atmospheric conditions, exact throughput, and assumes A_V=3.1\u00b7E(B\u2013V).; answer - ESPRESSO: Star1, Star2, Star4, Star5; HIRES: Star1, Star5\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - I checked the Wikipedia pages for Paranal and Keck Observatories to find their latitudes: Paranal is at \u201324.6\u00b0\u2009(lat), Keck is at +19.8\u00b0. An observatory at latitude \u03c6 can in principle see objects down to declination \u03b4_min=\u2013(90\u00b0\u2013|\u03c6|) and up to \u03b4_max=+ (90\u00b0\u2013|\u03c6|) (ignoring pointing limits). For Paranal (\u03c6=\u201324.6\u00b0) this gives \u03b4_min=\u2013(90\u00b0\u201324.6\u00b0)=\u201365.4\u00b0, \u03b4_max=+90\u00b0 (since southern sites can see the South Celestial Pole) but more precisely +65.4\u00b0 is the northern limit. For Keck (\u03c6=+19.8\u00b0), \u03b4_min=\u2013(90\u00b0\u201319.8\u00b0)=\u201370.2\u00b0, \u03b4_max=+70.2\u00b0. The overlapping declination range observable from both is \u03b4=\u201365.4\u00b0 to +65.4\u00b0 (or strictly \u201370.2\u00b0 to +65.4\u00b0 if using precise limits).; answer - Paranal Observatory (\u201324.6\u00b0\u2009lat): declination coverage ~\u201390\u00b0 to +65.4\u00b0; Keck Observatory (+19.8\u00b0\u2009lat): declination coverage ~\u201370.2\u00b0 to +90\u00b0; overlap ~\u201370.2\u00b0 to +65.4\u00b0.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - First, we identify which stars meet the magnitude limits of both instruments: ESPRESSO requires V<17\u2009mag and HIRES requires V<16\u2009mag. From the provided data the only candidates are Star1 (V=15.5) and Star5 (V=15.0). Next, we determine the overlapping declination range visible to both observatories: Paranal (latitude \u201324.6\u00b0) can reach roughly \u201390\u00b0 to +65.4\u00b0 declination, and Keck (latitude +19.8\u00b0) can reach roughly \u201370.2\u00b0 to +90\u00b0. The shared visibility window is therefore \u201370.2\u00b0 \u2264 Dec \u2264 +65.4\u00b0. Star1 has Dec=\u201375\u00b0, which is south of \u201370.2\u00b0 and thus not visible at Keck; Star5 has Dec=+60\u00b0, which lies within the common range. Consequently, only Star5 satisfies both the magnitude and declination criteria for observation by ESPRESSO and HIRES.; answer - Star5\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 6 output: thinking - We computed the apparent V magnitudes and checked against the instrument limits (ESPRESSO V<17\u2009mag; HIRES V<16\u2009mag) and the shared declination range (\u201370.2\u00b0 to +65.4\u00b0).
