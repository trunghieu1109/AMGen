            "Programmed ribosomal frameshifting creates two polyproteins near to 5` end of the genome by moving back by 1 nucleotide with the help of slippery nucleotides, and pseudoknot. The SARS-CoV-2 programmed ribosomal frameshifting mostly has the same conformation as the SARS-CoV programmed ribosomal frameshifting.",
            "SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14-ExoN operates as heterodimers in a mismatch repair mechanism. The N-terminal ExoN domain of nsp14 could bind to nsp10 making an active exonuclease complex that prevents the breakdown of dsRNA. ",
            "SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a has the ability to trigger caspase-8 activation/cleavage, without affecting the expression levels of Bcl-2. Caspase-8 activation is recognized as a characteristic feature of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway via death receptors, while Bcl-2 plays a crucial role in initiating the mitochondrial pathway. This suggests that the mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a induces apoptosis is via the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.\n",
            "The rate of frameshifting in vitro is linearly correlated with the number of conformations that a pseudoknot can adopt. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Programmed -1 Frameshift Signals show two conformations when under tension, similar to other pseudoknots that induce comparable frameshifting rates. ",

        "sub_tasks_text": "Subtask_1 output: thinking - Programmed \u20131 ribosomal frameshifting in coronaviruses occurs when the translating ribosome encounters a heptanucleotide \u201cslippery\u201d sequence (for SARS-CoV-2, typically U UUA AAC) and a downstream RNA pseudoknot. The ribosome stalls at the pseudoknot, allowing the P- and A-site tRNAs to slip back one nucleotide and re-pair in the \u20131 frame, enabling translation of two overlapping polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab). Structural studies (cryo-EM and force spectroscopy) show that the SARS-CoV-2 pseudoknot adopts two major conformations under tension, and its frameshift efficiency correlates with its conformational heterogeneity. Comparative analyses indicate that the SARS-CoV-2 frameshift signal and pseudoknot fold are highly similar to those of SARS-CoV, with only minor sequence and loop differences that do not significantly alter the overall three-stemmed pseudoknot architecture or frameshifting rates.; answer - SARS-CoV-2 uses a \u20131 programmed ribosomal frameshifting mechanism involving a slippery U UUA AAC sequence and a three-stemmed pseudoknot that stalls the ribosome and promotes tRNA slippage. The SARS-CoV-2 pseudoknot adopts two conformations under tension, and this behavior and its frameshifting efficiency are essentially the same as those observed for SARS-CoV.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSubtask_2 output: thinking - To address the subtask, I reviewed structural and biochemical studies of SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural proteins 10 and 14. It is well established that nsp14 houses an N-terminal DEDD\u2010family ExoN domain and a C-terminal N7\u2010methyltransferase domain, while nsp10 acts as a critical cofactor. Crystallography and enzymology show that nsp10 and nsp14 form a stable heterodimer through extensive hydrophobic and polar contacts: nsp10\u2019s zinc\u2010finger region docks against the ExoN active site cleft of nsp14, stabilizing key catalytic residues and coordinating two metal ions required for 3\u2032\u21925\u2032 exonuclease activity. This complex selectively excises mismatched nucleotides during RNA synthesis, constituting a virus\u2010encoded proofreading mechanism that greatly enhances replication fidelity. By removing misincorporated bases and preventing accumulation of aberrant dsRNA structures, the nsp10/nsp14\u2010ExoN complex not only reduces deleterious mutations but also limits the formation of dsRNA intermediates that would otherwise trigger host innate immune sensors. Consequently, heterodimer formation and direct protein\u2013protein interactions between nsp10 and the ExoN domain of nsp14 are essential for maintaining genome integrity and evading host defenses.; answer - The SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14-ExoN complex functions as a heterodimeric proofreading nuclease. In this assembly, nsp14\u2019s N-terminal ExoN domain forms extensive contacts with nsp10, which stabilizes the active site and coordinates the metal cofactors needed for 3\u2032\u21925\u2032 exonuclease activity. During viral RNA replication, the complex excises mismatched nucleotides from the nascent strand, constituting a mismatch repair mechanism that enhances replication fidelity. By removing aberrant RNA sequences and preventing the accumulation of double\u2010stranded RNA during synthesis, the nsp10/nsp14\u2013ExoN interaction both preserves genome integrity and limits triggers of host innate immunity.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSubtask_3 output: thinking - Studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a expression leads to activation and cleavage of caspase-8, a hallmark of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway triggered by death receptors. ORF3a upregulates or interacts with death receptors (such as TRAIL-R), recruits adaptor proteins (FADD), and activates caspase-8 without altering the expression of Bcl-2, which is the key regulator of the intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway. The unchanged Bcl-2 levels indicate that ORF3a-induced apoptosis is driven through the extrinsic pathway rather than the mitochondrial pathway.; answer - SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a induces apoptosis via the extrinsic death receptor pathway by activating caspase-8, with no change in Bcl-2 levels, indicating that the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway is not directly involved.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSubtask_4 output: thinking - Single-molecule force\u2013ramp experiments on coronavirus \u22121 PRF pseudoknots show that their mechanical heterogeneity (number of distinct folded conformers under tension) directly influences frameshifting efficiency. In both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, the PRF pseudoknot does not unfold via a single pathway but instead adopts two major conformations when subjected to ribosome\u2010like forces (~10\u201315 pN). Each conformation presents a different mechanical barrier to the translating ribosome, causing pauses of distinct lifetimes that promote \u22121 slippage. Quantitative analysis across viral and engineered pseudoknots reveals a roughly linear relationship between the count of populated conformers and in vitro frameshifting rates: more conformers \u2192 higher frameshifting. SARS-CoV-2\u2019s pseudoknot exhibits the same two\u2010state behavior and falls on the same linear fit as SARS-CoV, explaining why their measured \u22121 PRF efficiencies (~20\u201330%) are so similar.; answer - The rate of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 \u22121 ribosomal frameshifting scales linearly with the number of mechanically distinct pseudoknot conformations adopted under tension; both viruses\u2019 pseudoknots show two force-induced conformations, and this two-state heterogeneity correlates with their comparable frameshifting efficiencies (~20\u201330%).\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - We assess each statement: 1) Correct: SARS-CoV-2 uses a \u20131 PRF at a slippery U UUA AAC site plus a three-stemmed pseudoknot, and its folding and frameshifting efficiency closely match SARS-CoV. 2) Incorrect: The nsp10/nsp14 ExoN complex provides 3'\u21925' exonuclease proofreading by excising mismatched nucleotides\u2014i.e. it cleaves dsRNA to remove errors\u2014rather than \u201cpreventing breakdown of dsRNA.\u201d 3) Correct: ORF3a induces apoptosis via caspase-8 activation of the extrinsic pathway without altering Bcl-2. 4) Correct: Single-molecule studies show SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 pseudoknots adopt two conformers under tension, and frameshifting rates correlate linearly with mechanical heterogeneity. Thus statement 2 is the sole inaccurate one.; answer - B)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 6 output: thinking - Statement B incorrectly describes the nsp10/nsp14 ExoN complex. In reality, the SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14 heterodimer functions as a 3\u2032\u21925\u2032 exonuclease that proofreads the viral RNA by excising misincorporated nucleotides, thereby improving replication fidelity\u2014not by \u2018preventing the breakdown of dsRNA.\u2019 Statements A, C, and D accurately reflect current knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 frameshifting signals and ORF3a\u2019s apoptotic mechanism. Therefore, the incorrect statement is choice B.; answer - B"
