Thus statement 2 (choice B) is the only incorrect one.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent wyV9:\nStatement 2 mischaracterizes the nsp10/nsp14 ExoN complex: rather than preventing dsRNA breakdown, it provides 3′→5′ exonuclease proofreading by excising mismatches. Statements 1, 3, and 4 accurately describe SARS-CoV-2 frameshifting and ORF3a–induced apoptosis, and pseudoknot conformations correlate with frameshift rates. Thus the incorrect statement is choice B.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent 1DsB:\nWe reviewed each statement: 1) The –1 programmed ribosomal frameshift signal in SARS-CoV-2 indeed uses a slippery sequence and pseudoknot nearly identical in conformation to SARS-CoV’s. 2) While nsp10/nsp14 forms a heterodimeric 3′→5′ exonuclease that proofreads RNA by excising mismatches, it does not function to "prevent the breakdown of dsRNA" as stated. Instead, its ExoN activity removes erroneous nucleotides, enhancing fidelity. 3) ORF3a selectively activates caspase-8 and triggers the extrinsic apoptotic pathway without altering Bcl-2 levels, which is correct. 4) Single-molecule force spectroscopy shows that both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 pseudoknots adopt two conformations under tension, and frameshifting efficiency correlates with this mechanical heterogeneity.

The ribosome stalls at the pseudoknot, allowing the P- and A-site tRNAs to slip back one nucleotide and re-pair in the –1 frame, enabling translation of two overlapping polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab). Structural studies (cryo-EM and force spectroscopy) show that the SARS-CoV-2 pseudoknot adopts two major conformations under tension, and its frameshift efficiency correlates with its conformational heterogeneity. Comparative analyses indicate that the SARS-CoV-2 frameshift signal and pseudoknot fold are highly similar to those of SARS-CoV, with only minor sequence and loop differences that do not significantly alter the overall three-stemmed pseudoknot architecture or frameshifting rates.; answer - SARS-CoV-2 uses a –1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting mechanism involving a slippery U UUA AAC sequence and a three-stemmed pseudoknot that stalls the ribosome and promotes tRNA slippage. The SARS-CoV-2 pseudoknot adopts two conformations under tension, and this behavior and its frameshifting efficiency are essentially the same as those observed for SARS-CoV.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSubtask_2 output: thinking - To address the subtask, I reviewed structural and biochemical studies of SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural proteins 10 and 14. It is well established that nsp14 houses an N-terminal DEDD‐family ExoN domain and a C-terminal N7‐methyltransferase domain, while nsp10 acts as a critical cofactor. Crystallography and enzymology show that nsp10 and nsp14 form a stable heterodimer through extensive hydrophobic and polar contacts: nsp10’s zinc‐finger region docks against the ExoN active site cleft of nsp14, stabilizing key catalytic residues and coordinating two metal ions required for 3′→5′ exonuclease activity. This complex selectively excises mismatched nucleotides during RNA synthesis, constituting a virus‐encoded proofreading mechanism that greatly enhances replication fidelity. By removing misincorporated bases and preventing accumulation of aberrant dsRNA structures, the nsp10/nsp14‐ExoN complex not only reduces deleterious mutations but also limits the formation of dsRNA intermediates that would otherwise trigger host innate immune sensors. Consequently, heterodimer formation and direct protein–protein interactions between nsp10 and the ExoN domain of nsp14 are essential for maintaining genome integrity and evading host defenses.; answer - The SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14-ExoN complex functions as a heterodimeric proofreading nuclease. In this assembly, nsp14’s N-terminal ExoN domain forms extensive contacts with nsp10, which stabilizes the active site and coordinates the metal cofactors needed for 3′→5′ exonuclease activity. During viral RNA replication, the complex excises mismatched nucleotides from the nascent strand, constituting a mismatch repair mechanism that enhances replication fidelity. By removing aberrant RNA sequences and preventing the accumulation of double‐stranded RNA during synthesis, the nsp10/nsp14–ExoN interaction both preserves genome integrity and limits triggers of host innate immunity.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSubtask_3 output: thinking - Studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a expression leads to activation and cleavage of caspase-8, a hallmark of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway triggered by death receptors. ORF3a upregulates or interacts with death receptors (such as TRAIL-R), recruits adaptor proteins (FADD), and activates caspase-8 without altering the expression of Bcl-2, which is the key regulator of the intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway. The unchanged Bcl-2 levels indicate that ORF3a-induced apoptosis is driven through the extrinsic pathway rather than the mitochondrial pathway.; answer - SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a induces apoptosis via the extrinsic death receptor pathway by activating caspase-8, with no change in Bcl-2 levels, indicating that the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway is not directly involved.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSubtask_4 output: thinking - Single-molecule force–ramp experiments on coronavirus −1 PRF pseudoknots show that their mechanical heterogeneity (number of distinct folded conformers under tension) directly influences frameshifting efficiency. In both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, the PRF pseudoknot does not unfold via a single pathway but instead adopts two major conformations when subjected to ribosome‐like forces (~10–15 pN). Each conformation presents a different mechanical barrier to the translating ribosome, causing pauses of distinct lifetimes that promote −1 slippage. Quantitative analysis across viral and engineered pseudoknots reveals a roughly linear relationship between the count of populated conformers and in vitro frameshifting rates: more conformers → higher frameshifting. SARS-CoV-2’s pseudoknot exhibits the same two‐state behavior and falls on the same linear fit as SARS-CoV, explaining why their measured −1 PRF efficiencies (~20–30%) are so similar.; answer - The rate of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 −1 ribosomal frameshifting scales linearly with the number of mechanically distinct pseudoknot conformations adopted under tension; both viruses’ pseudoknots show two force-induced conformations, and this two-state heterogeneity correlates with their comparable frameshifting efficiencies (~20–30%).\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - We assess each statement: 1) Correct: SARS-CoV-2 uses a –1 PRF at a slippery U UUA AAC site plus a three-stemmed pseudoknot, and its folding and frameshifting efficiency closely match SARS-CoV. 2) Incorrect: The nsp10/nsp14 ExoN complex provides 3'→5' exonuclease proofreading by excising mismatched nucleotides—i.e. it cleaves dsRNA to remove errors—rather than “preventing breakdown of dsRNA.” 3) Correct: ORF3a induces apoptosis via caspase-8 activation of the extrinsic pathway without altering Bcl-2. 4) Correct: Single-molecule studies show SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 pseudoknots adopt two conformers under tension, and frameshifting rates correlate linearly with mechanical heterogeneity.

Structural studies show the SARS-CoV-2 pseudoknot adopts two major conformations under tension, matching SARS-CoV’s pseudoknot architecture and frameshifting efficiency. Thus Statement 1 is correct.\n\n2) The SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14-ExoN complex indeed forms a heterodimer for 3′→5′ exonuclease activity, excising misincorporated nucleotides during replication. However, the statement’s claim that ExoN “prevents the breakdown of dsRNA” is inaccurate: ExoN promotes proofreading and prevents accumulation of aberrant dsRNA, but does not stabilize dsRNA or prevent its breakdown. Thus Statement 2 is incorrect.\n\n3) SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a triggers caspase-8 activation without altering Bcl-2 levels, consistent with extrinsic (death receptor) apoptosis and minimal involvement of the intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway. Thus Statement 3 is correct.\n\n4) Single-molecule force spectroscopy shows that the frameshifting rate correlates linearly with the number of mechanically distinct pseudoknot conformers under tension. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 pseudoknots exhibit two conformations and similar frameshifting efficiencies, supporting the statement.

Cryo-EM and force spectroscopy confirm that the SARS-CoV-2 pseudoknot adopts two main conformations under tension, almost identical to SARS-CoV. This statement is correct.\n\n2) SARS-CoV-2 nsp10 and nsp14 indeed form a heterodimeric 3′→5′ ExoN proofreading complex: nsp10’s zinc‐finger docks against nsp14’s N-terminal ExoN active site, stabilizing catalytic residues and coordinating metal ions to excise mismatches. However, the phrase “prevents the breakdown of dsRNA” is misleading—ExoN actually cleaves mispaired nucleotides to ensure fidelity rather than protecting dsRNA from degradation. The key function is mismatch repair, not shielding dsRNA from breakdown. Thus this statement contains an inaccuracy.\n\n3) ORF3a triggers caspase-8 activation and cleavage, hallmark of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway via death receptors, without altering Bcl-2 levels (intrinsic pathway regulator). This accurately describes ORF3a-mediated apoptosis via the extrinsic route, so it is correct.\n\n4) Single-molecule force spectroscopy shows that the −1 PRF pseudoknots of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 adopt two mechanically distinct conformers under ribosome-like tension, and their frameshifting rates correlate linearly with the number of conformations.
