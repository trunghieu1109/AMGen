        "response": "The IR spectrum shows two N\u2013H stretch bands at 3420 and 3325 cm\u207b\u00b9, indicating a primary \u2013NH\u2082, and a strong C=O stretch at 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9 characteristic of an ester rather than an amide. The \u00b9H NMR features an ethyl ester fragment (1.20 ppm, t, 3H; 4.5 ppm, q, 2H), a broad 2H singlet at 4.0 ppm for \u2013NH\u2082, and two aromatic doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm (2H each, J\u22488 Hz) consistent with a para-disubstituted benzene ring. The molecular formula C\u2089H\u2081\u2081NO\u2082 matches an ethyl benzoate core with an amino substituent at the para position. Among the four choices, only ethyl 4-aminobenzoate has both an ethyl ester and a primary amine on a para-disubstituted aromatic ring, fitting all the spectral data perfectly.\n\nAnswer:D",
        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The medium\u2013strong bands at 3420 cm\u207b\u00b9 and 3325 cm\u207b\u00b9 are characteristic of N\u2013H stretching in a primary amine (two distinct N\u2013H stretches). The strong band at 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9 is in the region for a C=O stretch of an ester (amide C=O typically appears lower, around 1650 cm\u207b\u00b9). Thus, the IR data indicate a primary amine and an ester carbonyl.; answer - The IR bands at 3420 cm\u207b\u00b9 and 3325 cm\u207b\u00b9 indicate a primary amine (two N\u2013H stretches), and the strong band at 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9 indicates an ester carbonyl.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - First, note the IR indicates a primary amine (two N\u2013H stretches) and an ester carbonyl. So in the 1H NMR we expect signals for an ethyl ester (\u2013OCH2CH3), an \u2013NH2, and a para\u2010disubstituted aromatic ring. Now interpret each signal: 1.20 ppm (t, 3H) is a methyl triplet, coupling to two CH2 H\u2019s \u2013 the CH3 in an ethyl group. 4.5 ppm (q, 2H) is the corresponding CH2 quartet coupling to CH3, so the \u2013OCH2\u2013 of the ethyl ester. 4.0 ppm (b.s., 2H) integrates to two and is broad, matching an \u2013NH2. The aromatic region shows two doublets, each 2H: 7.0 ppm (d, J\u22488 Hz) and 8.0 ppm (d, J\u22488 Hz), consistent with a para\u2010disubstituted benzene with two sets of equivalent protons.; answer - 1.20 ppm (t, 3H): CH3 of ethyl ester; 4.5 ppm (q, 2H): OCH2 of ethyl ester; 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): NH2 protons of the primary amine; 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): aromatic protons of a para\u2010disubstituted benzene ring.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - The IR bands at 3420 cm\u207b\u00b9 and 3325 cm\u207b\u00b9 indicate two N\u2013H stretches of a primary amine (\u2013NH\u2082). The strong band at 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9 is characteristic of an ester C=O. The \u00b9H NMR shows an ethyl ester fragment (1.20 ppm, triplet, 3H for CH\u2083; 4.5 ppm, quartet, 2H for OCH\u2082), a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm integrating to 2H for the NH\u2082 protons, and two aromatic doublets at 7.0 ppm and 8.0 ppm (2H each, J\u22488 Hz) consistent with a para-disubstituted benzene. Combining these data leads to a para-substituted benzene ring bearing an NH\u2082 group and an ethyl ester. This structure is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.; answer - Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - The IR spectrum shows two N\u2013H stretch bands at 3420 and 3325 cm\u207b\u00b9, indicating a primary \u2013NH\u2082, and a strong C=O stretch at 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9 characteristic of an ester rather than an amide.
