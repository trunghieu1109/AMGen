proposed answer: The IR spectrum shows two N–H stretch bands at 3420 and 3325 cm⁻¹, indicating a primary –NH₂, and a strong C=O stretch at 1720 cm⁻¹ characteristic of an ester rather than an amide. The ¹H NMR features an ethyl ester fragment (1.20 ppm, t, 3H; 4.5 ppm, q, 2H), a broad 2H singlet at 4.0 ppm for –NH₂, and two aromatic doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm (2H each, J≈8 Hz) consistent with a para-disubstituted benzene ring. The molecular formula C₉H₁₁NO₂ matches an ethyl benzoate core with an amino substituent at the para position. Among the four choices, only ethyl 4-aminobenzoate has both an ethyl ester and a primary amine on a para-disubstituted aromatic ring, fitting all the spectral data perfectly.
