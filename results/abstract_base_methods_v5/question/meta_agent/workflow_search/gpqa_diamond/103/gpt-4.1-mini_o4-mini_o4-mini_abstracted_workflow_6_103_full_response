I recall the Doppler formula Δλ/λ₀ = v_r/c, which lets us convert a measured wavelength shift into a radial‐velocity amplitude. For circular orbits, that velocity amplitude K is directly linked to the orbital period P, semimajor axis a, and planet/star masses by the standard RV amplitude equation. Thus the core relationship is that the observed wavelength shift is proportional to the radial‐velocity amplitude, which itself depends on the planet’s orbital speed and period.; answer - In the radial‐velocity method Δλ/λ₀ = v_r/c, so the measured wavelength shift Δλ is directly proportional to the star’s line‐of‐sight velocity v_r. For circular orbits v_r varies sinusoidally with amplitude K, and K is related to the planet’s orbital parameters by K = (2πG/P)^(1/3) · (m_p\u2009sin\u2009i)/(m_*^(2/3)). Thus a larger Δλ means a larger K, which in turn depends on the planet’s mass, the star’s mass, and the orbital period.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - The classical Doppler relation for light in the non‐relativistic limit states that the fractional change in wavelength Δλ/λ₀ equals the radial velocity v_r divided by the speed of light c. In the RV method v_r oscillates sinusoidally with amplitude K, so replacing v_r by K directly yields Δλ/λ₀ = K/c. Solving for K gives K = c·Δλ/λ₀. This formula assumes |v_r|≪c (so relativistic corrections are negligible), that the spectral line is unblended and narrow, and that instrumental resolution and stellar activity do not significantly distort the measured Δλ.; answer - Δλ/λ₀ = K/c   (equivalently,   K = c·Δλ/λ₀)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - The radial velocity amplitude K is given by K = c·Δλ/λ₀. Since the rest wavelength λ₀ and the speed of light c are the same for both measurements, their ratio simplifies to K₂/K₁ = (c·Δλ₂/λ₀)/(c·Δλ₁/λ₀) = Δλ₂/Δλ₁.

Thus a larger Δλ means a larger K, which in turn depends on the planet’s mass, the star’s mass, and the orbital period.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent 5f3w, relating RV amplitude and wavelength shift, thinking: The radial‐velocity (RV) method measures the Doppler shift of stellar spectral lines induced by an orbiting planet. For small velocities (v ≪ c), the shift Δλ of a line of rest wavelength λ₀ is related to the line‐of‐sight (radial) velocity v_r by the nonrelativistic Doppler formula: Δλ/λ₀ ≃ v_r/c. Hence the amplitude of the observed wavelength shift directly gives the star’s orbital reflex velocity: v_r = c·(Δλ/λ₀). That reflex velocity in a circular orbit is v_r = (2πa_star)/P, where a_star is the star’s orbital radius around the system barycenter and P is the orbital period. Combining these shows that the measured wavelength shift encodes the star’s orbital speed and, through Kepler’s laws (a³∝P²), the planet’s orbital period and semi‐major axis.; answer: The observed wavelength shift Δλ is directly proportional to the star’s radial velocity v_r via v_r ≃ c·(Δλ/λ₀). In a circular orbit v_r = (2πa_star)/P, and by Kepler’s third law (for a given stellar mass), a³∝P². Thus the Doppler shift amplitude gives the star’s orbital speed, which together with Kepler’s law yields the planet’s orbital period and distance.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent XXEF, relating RV amplitude and wavelength shift, thinking: The RV method relies on the Doppler effect: a star’s motion toward or away from us shifts its spectral lines by Δλ relative to the rest wavelength λ0. By definition, Δλ/λ0 = v_r / c, where v_r is the star’s radial velocity amplitude and c is the speed of light. Rearranging gives v_r = (c\u2009Δλ)/λ0. For a planet in a circular orbit (and an orbital plane inclined by angle i), the maximum line-of-sight velocity is v_r = (2πa/P)\u2009sin\u2009i, where a is the orbital radius and P the period. Substituting into the Doppler formula yields Δλ = (λ0/c)(2πa/P)\u2009sin\u2009i. Thus the observed wavelength shift is directly proportional to the star’s orbital speed induced by the planet.; answer: The Doppler‐shift relation Δλ/λ₀ = v_r/c links wavelength shift to orbital speed: v_r = (c\u2009Δλ)/λ₀. For circular orbits, v_r = (2πa/P)\u2009sin\u2009i, so Δλ = (λ₀/c)(2πa/P)\u2009sin\u2009i.\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent ZJrM, expressing formula for wavelength shift and RV amplitude, thinking: We know from the Doppler effect that the fractional wavelength shift Δλ/λ₀ equals the line‐of‐sight velocity v_r divided by the speed of light c. In the context of the RV method the velocity amplitude is K, so replacing v_r with K gives Δλ/λ₀ = K/c. Rearranging yields K = (c · Δλ)/λ₀. This directly links the observed shift to the induced stellar RV amplitude.; answer: Δλ/λ₀ = K / c   (equivalently,   K = c · Δλ / λ₀)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCritic agent hrQb, providing feedback, thinking: The agent correctly stated the Doppler relation Δλ/λ₀ = K/c (or K = c·Δλ/λ₀), but failed to mention its assumptions and practical limitations.; answer: The Doppler formula Δλ/λ₀ = K/c (⇒ K = c·Δλ/λ₀) is a first‐order (non‐relativistic) approximation valid only when the star’s radial velocity K is much smaller than c and the motion is strictly along the line of sight. It assumes a fixed rest wavelength λ₀ and neglects higher‐order relativistic terms, gravitational redshift, convective blueshift, stellar activity or pulsation–induced line shifts, line blending, and instrumental calibration drifts. For high‐precision measurements or velocities approaching a significant fraction of c, one must use the full relativistic Doppler formula and carefully account for astrophysical and instrumental systematics.\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent ZJrM, refining formula expression, thinking: The classical Doppler relation for light in the non‐relativistic limit states that the fractional change in wavelength Δλ/λ₀ equals the radial velocity v_r divided by the speed of light c. In the RV method v_r oscillates sinusoidally with amplitude K, so replacing v_r by K directly yields Δλ/λ₀ = K/c. Solving for K gives K = c·Δλ/λ₀. This formula assumes |v_r|≪c (so relativistic corrections are negligible), that the spectral line is unblended and narrow, and that instrumental resolution and stellar activity do not significantly distort the measured Δλ.; answer: Δλ/λ₀ = K/c   (equivalently,   K = c·Δλ/λ₀)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT agent VWA1, calculating ratio of RV amplitudes, thinking: The radial velocity amplitude K is given by K = c·Δλ/λ₀. Since the rest wavelength λ₀ and the speed of light c are the same for both measurements, their ratio simplifies to K₂/K₁ = (c·Δλ₂/λ₀)/(c·Δλ₁/λ₀) = Δλ₂/Δλ₁.

With both stars and planets having the same masses and inclinations, K ∝ P^(–1/3) ⇒ P ∝ K^(–3). Therefore the period ratio is P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3 = (1/(K2/K1))^3.
