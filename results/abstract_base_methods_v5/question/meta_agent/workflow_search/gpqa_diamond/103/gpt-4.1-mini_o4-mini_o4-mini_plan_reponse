            "Astronomers are searching for exoplanets around two stars with exactly the same masses. Using the RV method, they detected one planet around each star, both with masses similar to that of Neptune. The stars themselves have masses similar to that of our Sun. Both planets were found to be in circular orbits.\n\nPlanet #1 was detected from the up to 5 miliangstrom periodic shift of a spectral line at a given wavelength. The periodic wavelength shift of the same spectral line in the spectrum of the host of planet #2 was 7 miliangstrom.\n\nThe question is: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?",

        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The problem statement specifies two stars \u201cwith exactly the same masses\u201d and then clarifies they are \u201csimilar to that of our Sun,\u201d so each star has mass \u22481 M\u2299. It then says each detected planet has a mass \u201csimilar to that of Neptune,\u201d so each planet\u2019s mass \u22481 M_Neptune. The radial\u2010velocity method detected periodic wavelength shifts of a given spectral line: for planet #1 the shift amplitude is 5 milli\u00e5ngstr\u00f6m, and for planet #2 it is 7 milli\u00e5ngstr\u00f6m. Finally, both planets are described as being in circular orbits. These are all the explicit physical parameters given.; answer - Star masses: \u22481 M\u2609 each; Planet masses: \u22481 M_Neptune each; Wavelength shifts: 5 m\u00c5 (planet #1), 7 m\u00c5 (planet #2); Orbits: circular for both\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - The question asks how wavelength shifts in the stellar spectral lines (measured by \u0394\u03bb in the RV method) relate to the star\u2019s line\u2010of\u2010sight velocity (radial velocity) and hence to the planet\u2019s orbital parameters. I recall the Doppler formula \u0394\u03bb/\u03bb\u2080 = v_r/c, which lets us convert a measured wavelength shift into a radial\u2010velocity amplitude. For circular orbits, that velocity amplitude K is directly linked to the orbital period P, semimajor axis a, and planet/star masses by the standard RV amplitude equation. Thus the core relationship is that the observed wavelength shift is proportional to the radial\u2010velocity amplitude, which itself depends on the planet\u2019s orbital speed and period.; answer - In the radial\u2010velocity method \u0394\u03bb/\u03bb\u2080 = v_r/c, so the measured wavelength shift \u0394\u03bb is directly proportional to the star\u2019s line\u2010of\u2010sight velocity v_r. For circular orbits v_r varies sinusoidally with amplitude K, and K is related to the planet\u2019s orbital parameters by K = (2\u03c0G/P)^(1/3) \u00b7 (m_p\u2009sin\u2009i)/(m_*^(2/3)). Thus a larger \u0394\u03bb means a larger K, which in turn depends on the planet\u2019s mass, the star\u2019s mass, and the orbital period.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - The classical Doppler relation for light in the non\u2010relativistic limit states that the fractional change in wavelength \u0394\u03bb/\u03bb\u2080 equals the radial velocity v_r divided by the speed of light c. In the RV method v_r oscillates sinusoidally with amplitude K, so replacing v_r by K directly yields \u0394\u03bb/\u03bb\u2080 = K/c. Solving for K gives K = c\u00b7\u0394\u03bb/\u03bb\u2080. This formula assumes |v_r|\u226ac (so relativistic corrections are negligible), that the spectral line is unblended and narrow, and that instrumental resolution and stellar activity do not significantly distort the measured \u0394\u03bb.; answer - \u0394\u03bb/\u03bb\u2080 = K/c   (equivalently,   K = c\u00b7\u0394\u03bb/\u03bb\u2080)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - The radial velocity amplitude K is given by K = c\u00b7\u0394\u03bb/\u03bb\u2080. Since the rest wavelength \u03bb\u2080 and the speed of light c are the same for both measurements, their ratio simplifies to K\u2082/K\u2081 = (c\u00b7\u0394\u03bb\u2082/\u03bb\u2080)/(c\u00b7\u0394\u03bb\u2081/\u03bb\u2080) = \u0394\u03bb\u2082/\u0394\u03bb\u2081. Substituting \u0394\u03bb\u2082 = 7\u2009m\u00c5 and \u0394\u03bb\u2081 = 5\u2009m\u00c5 gives K\u2082/K\u2081 = 7/5 = 1.4.; answer - 1.4\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - For circular orbits and equal stellar and planetary masses, the RV semi-amplitude K scales as K \u221d P^(\u22121/3). Therefore K\u2082/K\u2081 = (P\u2082/P\u2081)^(\u22121/3), so P\u2082/P\u2081 = (K\u2082/K\u2081)^(\u22123). The measured RV shift ratio is 7\u2009m\u00c5/5\u2009m\u00c5 = 1.4, hence P\u2082/P\u2081 = (1.4)^(\u22123) \u2248 0.36, which matches choice A).; answer - A)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 6 output: thinking - The RV semi\u2010amplitude K scales as K \u221d P^(\u22121/3). Thus K2/K1 = (P2/P1)^(\u22121/3), so P2/P1 = (K2/K1)^(\u22123). Given K2/K1 = 7\u2009m\u00c5 / 5\u2009m\u00c5 = 1.4, we get P2/P1 = (1.4)^(\u22123) = 1 / (1.4^3) \u2248 1 / 2.744 = 0.364, or about 0.36.; answer - \u22480.36\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 7 output: thinking - We derived in Sub-task 6 that P2/P1 = (K2/K1)^(\u22123) = (1.4)^(\u22123) \u2248 0.36.
