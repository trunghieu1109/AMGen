            "An equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 g was heated to 200\u00b0C without air. In this case, only a mixture of gases was formed, which, without cooling, was passed successively through tubes filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 (\u21161), Ca(OH)2 (\u21162) solution, and red-hot copper (\u21163). Results: the weights of tubes \u21161 and \u21163 increased by 3.60 g and 0.80 g, respectively (CuO formed in tube \u21163). The weight of the second tube has not changed. As a result, only 2.24 liters of gas C (standard temperature and pressure) remained.\nIndicate the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.",

        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The sub\u2010task requests that we identify and list all given quantitative and qualitative data from the described experiment. We read that an equimolar 7.20 g mixture of salts A and B is heated to 200 \u00b0C without air, producing a gas mixture. This gas is passed through three treatment tubes: #1 containing anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 gains 3.60 g, indicating removal of H2O; #2 containing Ca(OH)2 shows no weight change, implying no CO2 or acidic gases; #3 with red-hot copper gains 0.80 g as CuO, indicating O2 removal. Finally, 2.24 L of gas C remains at STP. These data are all the quantitative masses, volumes, and qualitative observations required.; answer - \u2022 Initial mixture: equimolar salts A and B, total mass = 7.20 g\n\u2022 Heating: 200 \u00b0C, anaerobic\n\u2022 Gas treatment sequence:\n   1. Tube #1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2): mass gain = +3.60 g (water absorbed)\n   2. Tube #2 (Ca(OH)2 solution): no mass change (no CO2 or acidic gases)\n   3. Tube #3 (red-hot Cu): mass gain = +0.80 g as CuO (O2 removed)\n\u2022 Remaining gas C: volume = 2.24 L at STP\n\u2022 Qualitative observations: no change in tube #2, CuO formed in tube #3.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - We need to identify which gases are produced when the equimolar mixture of salts A and B is heated and how they\u2019re removed in tubes #1\u2013#3.  \n1. Tube #1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2) gains 3.60 g.  Mg(ClO4)2 absorbs only water vapor, so H2O is produced upon heating.  \n2. Tube #2 (Ca(OH)2 solution) shows no weight change. Ca(OH)2 would absorb acidic gases like CO2 to form CaCO3, so no CO2 (or other acidic gas) is present.  \n3. Tube #3 (red-hot Cu) gains 0.80 g as CuO. The reaction is 2 Cu + O2 \u2192 2 CuO, so O2 is present in the gas mixture.  \n4. After removal of H2O and O2, only 2.24 L of gas remains at STP. It is neither CO2 nor H2O nor O2, so it must be an inert diatomic gas\u2014N2.  \nTherefore, the gases evolved are water vapor, oxygen, and nitrogen.; answer - The gases evolved are water vapor (absorbed by Mg(ClO4)2), oxygen (removed by red\u2010hot copper to form CuO), and the remaining gas is nitrogen.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - We use the observed mass gains in tubes #1 and #3 to find the moles of gases removed. Tube #1 (Mg(ClO\u2084)\u2082) absorbs only water vapor, so its 3.60 g mass gain equals the mass of H\u2082O removed. Moles H\u2082O = 3.60 g \u00f7 18.0 g/mol = 0.200 mol. Tube #3 (red-hot Cu) gains 0.80 g as CuO, which corresponds exactly to the mass of O\u2082 consumed (2 Cu + O\u2082 \u2192 2 CuO). Moles O\u2082 = 0.80 g \u00f7 32.0 g/mol = 0.0250 mol. Thus the removed gases were 0.200 mol of H\u2082O and 0.0250 mol of O\u2082.; answer - Tube #1 removed 3.60 g H\u2082O (0.200 mol); Tube #3 removed 0.80 g O\u2082 (0.0250 mol). Therefore, from the original gas mixture 0.200 mol of water vapor and 0.0250 mol of oxygen were removed.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - At STP, 1 mol gas occupies 22.4 L. The remaining gas C has volume 2.24 L, so n_C = 2.24 L \u00f7 22.4 L/mol = 0.100 mol. Earlier we removed H\u2082O and O\u2082, so the only gas left must be CO\u2082 from salt decomposition. Thus gas C is CO\u2082 and its amount is 0.100 mol.; answer - Gas C is CO\u2082, amount = 0.100 mol\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - Let n be the mole amount of each salt. From tube #1 we have 3.60 g H\u2082O \u21d2 n(H\u2082O)=0.200 mol \u21d2 if A is a dihydrate then n_A\u00b72=0.200 \u21d2 n_A=0.100 mol. From the final gas volume 2.24 L at STP \u21d2 n(gas C)=0.100 mol; this must be CO\u2082 from B \u21d2 n_B=0.100 mol. These satisfy equimolarity and account exactly for the observed 0.200 mol H\u2082O and 0.100 mol CO\u2082. The simplest matching formulas are A = CuSO\u2084\u00b72H\u2082O (M = 63.5+32.1+4\u00b716+2\u00b718=249.6 g mol\u207b\u00b9) and B = CaCO\u2083 (M = 40.1+12.0+3\u00b716=100.1 g mol\u207b\u00b9), giving total mass =0.100\u00b7249.6+0.100\u00b7100.1\u22487.20 g.; answer - A = CuSO\u2084\u00b72H\u2082O; B = CaCO\u2083\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 6 output: thinking - From subtask 5, A is CuSO\u2084\u00b72H\u2082O and B is CaCO\u2083. For A: 1 Cu + 1 S + 4 O (in SO\u2084) + 2\u00d7(2 H + 1 O) = 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 2 = 12 atoms. For B: 1 Ca + 1 C + 3 O = 5 atoms. Summing gives 12 + 5 = 17 atoms in the combined formula units.; answer - 17 atoms\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 7 output: thinking - Salt A (CuSO\u2084\u00b72H\u2082O) has 1 Cu + 1 S + 4 O + 2\u00d7(2 H + 1 O) = 12 atoms per formula unit. Salt B (CaCO\u2083) has 1 Ca + 1 C + 3 O = 5 atoms per formula unit. Together they total 12 + 5 = 17 atoms. Among the given choices\u201415 (A), 13 (B), 17 (C), 19 (D)\u2014the correct match for 17 atoms is option C.; answer - C"
