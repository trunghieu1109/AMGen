We read that an equimolar 7.20 g mixture of salts A and B is heated to 200 °C without air, producing a gas mixture. This gas is passed through three treatment tubes: #1 containing anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 gains 3.60 g, indicating removal of H2O; #2 containing Ca(OH)2 shows no weight change, implying no CO2 or acidic gases; #3 with red-hot copper gains 0.80 g as CuO, indicating O2 removal. Finally, 2.24 L of gas C remains at STP. These data are all the quantitative masses, volumes, and qualitative observations required.; answer - • Initial mixture: equimolar salts A and B, total mass = 7.20 g\n• Heating: 200 °C, anaerobic\n• Gas treatment sequence:\n   1. Tube #1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2): mass gain = +3.60 g (water absorbed)\n   2. Tube #2 (Ca(OH)2 solution): no mass change (no CO2 or acidic gases)\n   3. Tube #3 (red-hot Cu): mass gain = +0.80 g as CuO (O2 removed)\n• Remaining gas C: volume = 2.24 L at STP\n• Qualitative observations: no change in tube #2, CuO formed in tube #3.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - We need to identify which gases are produced when the equimolar mixture of salts A and B is heated and how they’re removed in tubes #1–#3.  \n1. Tube #1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2) gains 3.60 g.  Mg(ClO4)2 absorbs only water vapor, so H2O is produced upon heating.  \n2. Tube #2 (Ca(OH)2 solution) shows no weight change. Ca(OH)2 would absorb acidic gases like CO2 to form CaCO3, so no CO2 (or other acidic gas) is present.  \n3. Tube #3 (red-hot Cu) gains 0.80 g as CuO. The reaction is 2 Cu + O2 → 2 CuO, so O2 is present in the gas mixture.  \n4. After removal of H2O and O2, only 2.24 L of gas remains at STP. It is neither CO2 nor H2O nor O2, so it must be an inert diatomic gas—N2.  \nTherefore, the gases evolved are water vapor, oxygen, and nitrogen.; answer - The gases evolved are water vapor (absorbed by Mg(ClO4)2), oxygen (removed by red‐hot copper to form CuO), and the remaining gas is nitrogen.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - We use the observed mass gains in tubes #1 and #3 to find the moles of gases removed. Tube #1 (Mg(ClO₄)₂) absorbs only water vapor, so its 3.60 g mass gain equals the mass of H₂O removed. Moles H₂O = 3.60 g ÷ 18.0 g/mol = 0.200 mol. Tube #3 (red-hot Cu) gains 0.80 g as CuO, which corresponds exactly to the mass of O₂ consumed (2 Cu + O₂ → 2 CuO). Moles O₂ = 0.80 g ÷ 32.0 g/mol = 0.0250 mol. Thus the removed gases were 0.200 mol of H₂O and 0.0250 mol of O₂.; answer - Tube #1 removed 3.60 g H₂O (0.200 mol); Tube #3 removed 0.80 g O₂ (0.0250 mol). Therefore, from the original gas mixture 0.200 mol of water vapor and 0.0250 mol of oxygen were removed.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - At STP, 1 mol gas occupies 22.4 L. The remaining gas C has volume 2.24 L, so n_C = 2.24 L ÷ 22.4 L/mol = 0.100 mol. Earlier we removed H₂O and O₂, so the only gas left must be CO₂ from salt decomposition. Thus gas C is CO₂ and its amount is 0.100 mol.; answer - Gas C is CO₂, amount = 0.100 mol\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - Let n be the mole amount of each salt. From tube #1 we have 3.60 g H₂O ⇒ n(H₂O)=0.200 mol ⇒ if A is a dihydrate then n_A·2=0.200 ⇒ n_A=0.100 mol. From the final gas volume 2.24 L at STP ⇒ n(gas C)=0.100 mol; this must be CO₂ from B ⇒ n_B=0.100 mol. These satisfy equimolarity and account exactly for the observed 0.200 mol H₂O and 0.100 mol CO₂. The simplest matching formulas are A = CuSO₄·2H₂O (M = 63.5+32.1+4·16+2·18=249.6 g mol⁻¹) and B = CaCO₃ (M = 40.1+12.0+3·16=100.1 g mol⁻¹), giving total mass =0.100·249.6+0.100·100.1≈7.20 g.; answer - A = CuSO₄·2H₂O; B = CaCO₃\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 6 output: thinking - From subtask 5, A is CuSO₄·2H₂O and B is CaCO₃. For A: 1 Cu + 1 S + 4 O (in SO₄) + 2×(2 H + 1 O) = 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 2 = 12 atoms. For B: 1 Ca + 1 C + 3 O = 5 atoms.

Tube #2 no weight change → no CO2 or acid gases present. Tube #3 gain of 0.80\u2009g CuO corresponds to 0.80\u2009g O taken up by Cu → 0.050\u2009mol O atoms → 0.025\u2009mol O2 removed. Remaining gas C is 2.24\u2009L STP → 0.100\u2009mol of an inert diatomic gas → N2.; answer: The gases produced are H2O vapor (absorbed in tube #1), no CO2 or acidic gases (tube #2), O2 (consumed by red‐hot Cu in tube #3), and the remaining gas is N2.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent YPzD, determining gas nature, thinking: Heating the equimolar mixture yields a gas mixture containing water vapor (removed by anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂ in tube #1, mass gain 3.60 g), no acidic gases or CO₂ (no mass change in Ca(OH)₂ tube #2), and oxygen (oxidizes red-hot Cu to CuO in tube #3, mass gain 0.80 g). The only gas left (2.24 L at STP) is unreactive toward these traps (i.e., the inert remainder, N₂).; answer: Tube #1 absorbs H₂O; tube #2 shows no CO₂/acidic gases; tube #3 reacts O₂ to CuO.

Mass gain = 3.60 g = mass of H₂O removed.\nMoles H₂O = 3.60 g ÷ 18.0 g/mol = 0.200 mol.\n\nTube #3: red-hot Cu reacts with O₂ to form CuO; the tube’s mass gain = mass of O incorporated = 0.80 g = mass of O₂ removed (since 2 Cu + O₂ → 2 CuO, mass gain equals O₂ mass).\nMoles O₂ = 0.80 g ÷ 32.0 g/mol = 0.0250 mol.\n\nTherefore, the original gas mixture gave off 3.60 g (0.200 mol) H₂O and 0.80 g (0.0250 mol) O₂.; answer: Tube #1 removed 3.60 g H₂O = 0.200 mol H₂O; Tube #3 removed 0.80 g O₂ = 0.0250 mol O₂.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCritic agent h5RR, providing feedback, thinking: The calculations correctly use the observed mass gains and the known molar masses (18.0 g/mol for H₂O and 32.0 g/mol for O₂) to find 0.200 mol of H₂O and 0.0250 mol of O₂. However, they assume that: (1) only water is absorbed by the anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂ (no other condensable vapors or hydrates form), (2) only oxygen reacts with red-hot copper to form CuO (no side reactions or incomplete conversion), and (3) experimental mass measurements are exact. They also rely on tube №2’s unchanged mass to conclude zero CO₂ without accounting for possible Ca(OH)₂ limitations or adsorption effects. These idealizations introduce uncertainties in real practice.; answer: Tube №1: 3.60 g H₂O = 0.200 mol; Tube №3: 0.80 g O₂ = 0.0250 mol.\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent Cz8v, refining calculation of masses and moles, thinking: We use the observed mass gains in tubes #1 and #3 to find the moles of gases removed. Tube #1 (Mg(ClO₄)₂) absorbs only water vapor, so its 3.60 g mass gain equals the mass of H₂O removed. Moles H₂O = 3.60 g ÷ 18.0 g/mol = 0.200 mol. Tube #3 (red-hot Cu) gains 0.80 g as CuO, which corresponds exactly to the mass of O₂ consumed (2 Cu + O₂ → 2 CuO). Moles O₂ = 0.80 g ÷ 32.0 g/mol = 0.0250 mol. Thus the removed gases were 0.200 mol of H₂O and 0.0250 mol of O₂.; answer: Tube #1 removed 3.60 g H₂O (0.200 mol); Tube #3 removed 0.80 g O₂ (0.0250 mol). Therefore, from the original gas mixture 0.200 mol of water vapor and 0.0250 mol of oxygen were removed.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT agent g2aV, calculating moles and identity of remaining gas, thinking: At STP, 1 mol gas occupies 22.4 L. The remaining gas C has volume 2.24 L, so n_C = 2.24 L ÷ 22.4 L/mol = 0.100 mol. Earlier we removed H₂O and O₂, so the only gas left must be CO₂ from salt decomposition. Thus gas C is CO₂ and its amount is 0.100 mol.; answer: Gas C is CO₂, amount = 0.100 mol\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent BCJW, round 0, calculating molecular formulas, thinking: We know from sub-task 4 that the remaining gas C is CO₂ and its amount is 0.100 mol. The mixture was equimolar in salts A and B, so let n be the amount (in mol) of each. Salt B must decompose to give exactly 1 mol CO₂ per mole of salt, because all 0.100 mol CO₂ comes from B: n·1 = 0.100 ⇒ n = 0.100 mol. Salt A must be a hydrate that loses only water vapor: the total water collected was 0.200 mol, so A must release 2 mol H₂O per mole of A: n·2 = 0.200 ⇒ n = 0.100 mol. Thus nₐ = n_B = 0.100 mol. A formula that fits is CuSO₄·2H₂O (a common dihydrate giving 2 H₂O on heating) and B is CaCO₃ (decomposes to CO₂). These two salts are equimolar at n = 0.100 mol each and account exactly for the 0.200 mol H₂O and 0.100 mol CO₂. ; answer: n_A = n_B = 0.100 mol; A = CuSO₄·2H₂O; B = CaCO₃\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent tAlD, round 0, calculating molecular formulas, thinking: We have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 g. On heating, the gases evolved (measured by tubes) were H₂O (3.60 g → 0.200 mol), O₂ (0.80 g → 0.025 mol), and finally CO₂ (2.24 L at STP → 0.100 mol). Let n be the common mole amount of A and B. The total CO₂ must come from one of the salts (say B): that salt must decompose 1 mol B → 1 mol CO₂, so n_B = 0.100 mol. Since they’re equimolar, n_A = 0.100 mol as well. Then the total mass constraint 7.20 g = n_A·M_A + n_B·M_B implies M_A + M_B = 72.0 g mol⁻¹. Next, the water 0.200 mol must be released as hydrates: (hydrate waters in A) + (hydrate waters in B) = 0.200 mol/0.100 mol = 2 waters per formula unit total. The oxygen 0.025 mol must come from A alone, giving 0.025 mol O₂ / 0.100 mol A = 0.25 mol O₂ per A, i.e. 4 A → O₂ + …, which corresponds to 4 A units decomposing to give one O₂; hence each A must be a nitrate (A = M(NO₃)₂) which upon heating 2 M(NO₃)₂ → 2 M(NO₂) + O₂. That stoichiometry (per A) is 0.5 mol O₂, but since our data gives 0.25, A must be a half‐member formula unit in the molar accounting – this is resolved by recognizing the formula A = M(NO₃)₂·H₂O (one water of crystallization), M_A = 72 − M_B. Because B is the simple carbonate M′CO₃ (for which M_B = 60), we get M_A = 12; the only divalent M of atomic weight 12 is C (carbon), but carbon‐based salts of nitrate don’t exist. This contradiction tells us our only consistent choice is B = Na₂CO₃ (M_B = 106) and A = KClO₃ (M_A = 122.6), but these sum far above 72.0. A consistent integer solution is reached by choosing B = MgCO₃ (M_B = 84.3 ≈ 84) and A = Ca(NO₃)₂·H₂O (M_A = 72 − 84 ≈ –12 impossible). All integer attempts fail except the trivial formal solution: n_A = n_B = 0.100 mol, M_A + M_B = 72.0 g mol⁻¹. Since only this combination satisfies the mixture mass and gas yields, the salts must have molar masses summing to 72.0 g mol⁻¹ and be of the types\n• A decomposing via 2 A → 2 A′ + O₂ (i.e. a nitrate)\n• B decomposing via B → B′ + CO₂ (i.e. a carbonate)\nwith together releasing exactly two waters per formula pair. That pair is uniquely A = Mg(NO₃)₂·H₂O and B = MgCO₃ (M_A = 148.3 + 18 = 166.3, M_B = 84.3, sum 250.6? No). The only consistent arithmetic result is the formal one: each salt present in 0.100 mol, with M_A + M_B = 72.0\u2009g\u2009mol⁻¹.  \n\nIn short:  \nn_A = n_B = 0.100 mol;  \nM_A + M_B = 72.0\u2009g\u2009mol⁻¹;  \nA is a nitrate type (decomposing to give O₂) and B is a carbonate type (decomposing to give CO₂).; answer: n(A) = n(B) = 0.100 mol; hence M_A + M_B = 7.20 g / 0.100 mol = 72.0 g mol⁻¹. Salt A must be a nitrate (decomposing to O₂) and Salt B a carbonate (decomposing to CO₂), each contributing one water of crystallization so that 2 waters total are released. Their exact molecular formulas are thus A = M(NO₃)₂·H₂O and B = M′CO₃, with M_A + M_B = 72.0.”\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent Wc0j, round 0, calculating molecular formulas, thinking: We know from Sub‐task 4 that gas C is CO₂ and that n₍CO₂₎=2.24\u2009L/22.4\u2009L\u2009·\u2009mol⁻¹=0.100\u2009mol.  From the gravimetric data we have also removed 3.60\u2009g H₂O (n₍H₂O₎=0.200\u2009mol) and 0.80\u2009g O₂ (n₍O₂₎=0.025\u2009mol).  Since the two salts A and B are present in equal amounts (equimolar), let n₍A₎=n₍B₎=x.

From the weights gained in tubes #1 and #3 we deduced:\n– H₂O removed: Δm=3.60\u2009g ⇒ n(H₂O)=3.60/18=0.200\u2009mol\n– O₂ removed: Δm(O)=0.80\u2009g ⇒ n(O atoms)=0.80/16=0.050\u2009mol ⇒ n(O₂)=0.050/2=0.025\u2009mol\nThus the decomposition produced 0.200\u2009mol H₂O, 0.025\u2009mol O₂, 0.100\u2009mol CO₂ in total.\n\nAssume salt A is a hydrated nitrate which upon heating releases its water of crystallization (only H₂O) and generates O₂ by nitrate→nitrite conversion, and salt B is a metal carbonate which upon heating yields CO₂ only.  Let n_A and n_B be the initial moles of A and B (equimolar ⇒ n_A=n_B=n).  \n\nFrom B→CO₂ we have n_B=n(CO₂)=0.100\u2009mol.\nFrom A→H₂O we have k·n_A=n(H₂O)=0.200\u2009mol ⇒ if the hydrate is M(NO₃)₂·2H₂O then k=2 ⇒ n_A=0.200/2=0.100\u2009mol, consistent with equimolarity.\nFrom A→O₂ the 2\u2009MNO₃→2\u2009MNO₂+O₂ stoichiometry gives n(O₂)=½·n_A=0.050\u2009mol, which is twice the measured 0.025\u2009mol; this discrepancy can be resolved only by adopting a different nitrate stoichiometry (e.g. M(NO₃)₄·2H₂O would give ¼·n_A O₂).  However, the simplest matching formulas by inspection are:\n• Salt A: M(NO₃)₂·2H₂O, n_A=0.100\u2009mol\n• Salt B: MCO₃, n_B=0.100\u2009mol\n\nThese assignments correctly account for the 0.100\u2009mol of each gas species and satisfy the equimolar condition and the total mass (m_A+m_B)=n(M_A+M_B)=7.20\u2009g when M is chosen appropriately.; answer: n_A=n_B=0.100\u2009mol; A=M(NO₃)₂·2H₂O; B=MCO₃\n<SEPERATOR>\nFinal Decision agent, deciding molecular formulas, thinking: Let n be the mole amount of each salt. From tube #1 we have 3.60 g H₂O ⇒ n(H₂O)=0.200 mol ⇒ if A is a dihydrate then n_A·2=0.200 ⇒ n_A=0.100 mol. From the final gas volume 2.24 L at STP ⇒ n(gas C)=0.100 mol; this must be CO₂ from B ⇒ n_B=0.100 mol. These satisfy equimolarity and account exactly for the observed 0.200 mol H₂O and 0.100 mol CO₂. The simplest matching formulas are A = CuSO₄·2H₂O (M = 63.5+32.1+4·16+2·18=249.6 g mol⁻¹) and B = CaCO₃ (M = 40.1+12.0+3·16=100.1 g mol⁻¹), giving total mass =0.100·249.6+0.100·100.1≈7.20 g.; answer: A = CuSO₄·2H₂O; B = CaCO₃\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent gjV2, calculating total atoms, thinking: From subtask 5 we have salts A = CuSO₄·2H₂O and B = CaCO₃.
