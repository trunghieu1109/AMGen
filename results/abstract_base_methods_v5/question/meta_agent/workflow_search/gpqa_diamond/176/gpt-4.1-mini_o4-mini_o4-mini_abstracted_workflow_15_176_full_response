Use debate agents to discuss the impact of relativistic effects and finalize the answer. \n\n ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent yeZx:\nWe have two luminosity ratios: without Doppler boosting L1/L2≈2.23 and with relativistic Doppler boosting L1_obs/L2_obs≈2.25. The difference arises because the receding Star_2’s emission is de‐boosted by a factor δ^4≈0.9907, raising the observed ratio from 2.23 to 2.25. Among the four choices (~2.23, ~2.25, ~2.32, ~2.35), the boosted result of 2.25 is the physically consistent value after accounting for relativistic effects. Therefore, the best match is option A) ~2.25.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent k9gt:\nThe no-boost calculation gave L1/L2≈2.23, while including relativistic Doppler boosting (δ^4 correction for Star_2’s v=700\u2009km/s) yields L1/L2≈2.25. The relativistic correction is small but more physically accurate, so the best match among the options (~2.23, ~2.25, ~2.32, ~2.35) is ~2.25.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent hOmP:\nWe computed the intrinsic luminosity ratio ignoring Doppler effects as L1/L2≈(R1/R2)^2·(T1/T2)^4=2.25×0.9907≈2.23. Including relativistic Doppler boosting for Star_2 (v=700\u2009km/s, β≈0.00233) gives δ2^4≈0.9907, so the observed ratio becomes 2.23/0.9907≈2.25. The Doppler‐corrected value is physically more accurate, differing by only ~0.9% but reflecting the correct bolometric boosting. Among the choices (~2.23, ~2.25, ~2.32, ~2.35), ~2.25 (choice A) best matches the refined result.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent rsnf:\nAgent Alpha notes that without Doppler boosting (Sub-task 4) we get L1/L2≈2.23. Agent Beta points out that including relativistic Doppler boosting for Star_2’s 700 km/s recession increases the observed ratio to L1/L2≈2.25 (Sub-task 5). The difference between 2.23 and 2.25 stems from the δ^4 correction factor (~0.9907) for the receding star. Since we want the physically consistent (boosted) result, the closest provided option is ~2.25.\n\n### answer #1 by Debate Agent yeZx:\nA)\n\n### answer #1 by Debate Agent k9gt:\nA)\n\n### answer #1 by Debate Agent hOmP:\nA)\n\n### answer #1 by Debate Agent rsnf:\nA)\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Make final decision on the luminosity ratio multiple-choice answer.\n\n Return your answer in the "answer" entry and justify detailedly why you think so in the "thinking" entry.

Such a small shift is expected for these velocities and is well within the linear approximation’s validity. All steps respect astrophysical principles.

Thus δ2^4=((1–β)/(1+β))^2≈(0.997667/1.002333)^2≈0.9907. Star_1 has δ1=1 (v=0). Hence the observed luminosity ratio becomes L1_obs/L2_obs=(L1_int/L2_int)/(δ2^4)≈2.23/0.9907≈2.25.; answer - L1/L2 ≈ 2.25\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 6 output: thinking - All debate agents consistently show that the intrinsic luminosity ratio without Doppler effects is about 2.23, and applying the relativistic Doppler boosting correction for the receding Star_2 (v=700 km/s) increases the observed ratio to approximately 2.25.

With v2 = 700\u2009km/s ≃ 0.00233\u2009c, the shift is ≃0.233%, so λ_emit2 ≃0.9977\u2009λ_obs. Wien’s law (λT = b) then gives T2 = b/λ_emit2 ≃1.00233\u2009×\u2009(b/λ_obs) = 1.00233\u2009T1. A slight blueshift raising T2 by ≃0.23% is fully consistent: small radial velocities produce proportionally small temperature changes.

The ~0.233% shift leads via Wien’s law to T2≈1.00233\u2009T1, which is negligible and physically consistent. All steps obey astrophysical principles. For completeness one should note that gravitational redshift, instrument calibration errors, and line‐profile asymmetries are not addressed here but would only introduce similarly small corrections at this level of precision.; answer: The Doppler correction and resulting temperatures are physically consistent and complete within the non‐relativistic approximation; the tiny (~0.23%) shift is correctly handled and yields a reliable temperature estimate.\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent pg7v, refining verification, thinking: We check that for v=700 km/s (v/c≈0.00233) the non-relativistic Doppler formula λ_emit=λ_obs/(1+v/c) applies (since v≪c).
