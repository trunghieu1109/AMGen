Question: Example(question='Observations of structures located at a distance of about 2.1 gigaparsecs (2.1 Gpc) are being carried out. The detected absorption line energy equivalent is about 3.9 micro electron volts (3.9 * 10^-6 eV).\n\nWhat is most likely to be observed with this absorption line in the Milky Way?', choice1='Cold molecular interstellar medium.', choice2='Cold atomic interstellar medium.', choice3='Warm atomic interstellar medium.', choice4='Warm molecular interstellar medium.', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_35
proposed answer: The observed absorption energy (3.9×10⁻⁶ eV) corresponds to a radio frequency of order 1 GHz (λ≈30 cm), which closely matches the H I 21 cm hyperfine line (E≈5.9×10⁻⁶ eV, ν=1.420 GHz). This line arises in cold neutral atomic hydrogen clouds in the Milky Way. Molecular transitions (e.g., CO) and warm ISM tracers occur at much higher energies, so the absorption is best explained by the cold atomic interstellar medium phase.
