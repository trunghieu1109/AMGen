For orbital motion, μ = -(e/2m_e)L, so μ_z = -(eħ/2m_e)m. Thus ⟨H⟩ = -μ_z B = (eħ/2m_e) m B = μ_B m B, where μ_B = eħ/(2m_e) ≃ 9.274×10⁻²⁴ J/T.

The ratio ⟨H⟩/ΔE≈(9.27×10⁻²⁴)/(4.09×10⁻¹⁹)≈2.3×10⁻⁵, so the paramagnetic term is about 10⁵ times smaller than the transition energy. Equivalently, in electron-volts ⟨H⟩≈5.8×10⁻⁵\u2009eV versus ΔE≈2.55\u2009eV, again a ~4×10⁴ factor difference.

However, this comparison assumes only the linear paramagnetic term (Zeeman effect), neglects diamagnetic contributions, spin and fine‐structure splitting, higher‐order field effects, and holds only for weak fields (B∼1 T) and low |m|.
