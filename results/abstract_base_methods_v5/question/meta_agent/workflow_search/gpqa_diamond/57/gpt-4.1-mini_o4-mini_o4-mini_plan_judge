Question: Example(question='Which of the following physical theories never requires regularization at high energies?', choice1='Superstring Theory', choice2='Quantum Electrodynamics', choice3='Quantum Chromodynamics', choice4='Classical Electrodynamics', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_44_57
proposed answer: Among the options, only Superstring Theory is perturbatively ultraviolet finite at all loop orders due to the finite string length scale and modular invariance, so it never produces the UV divergences that would require an external regulator. In contrast, Quantum Electrodynamics and Quantum Chromodynamics are renormalizable quantum field theories but rely on regularization schemes (e.g., dimensional regularization) to tame their high‐energy divergences, and Classical Electrodynamics, although free of quantum loops, isn’t a UV‐complete quantum framework and handles point‐charge self‐energy divergences only heuristically. Therefore, the correct choice is Superstring Theory.
