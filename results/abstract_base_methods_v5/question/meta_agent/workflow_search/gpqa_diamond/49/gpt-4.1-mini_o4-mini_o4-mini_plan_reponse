            "Your colleague has devised a new quantum field theory on four-dimensional spacetime, and is exploring the regularization of certain higher-order loop diagrams in that theory. On their desk you spy a scribbled note: a Feynman diagram, and next to it, the words \"size estimate\" followed by a string of physical constants, numbers, and ratios between what appear to be energy scales. The symbols read: alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2.\n\nThe diagram, unfortunately, has been rendered unreadable by a spilled coffee. How many loops did it contain?",

        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The estimate \u03b1^3\u00b7g^2\u00b7\u221a2\u00b78\u00b71/(4\u03c0)^6\u00b7(Q/M)^2 arises by multiplying the vertex couplings, symmetry factors, loop integrals, and kinematic suppression. We see three factors of the gauge coupling \u03b1 (\u03b1^3) and two of another interaction g (g^2), which tells us there are five total vertices. The power of (4\u03c0)\u22126 in the denominator indicates three loop integrals, since each loop in 4D contributes a factor \u222bd^4k/(2\u03c0)^4\u21921/(4\u03c0)^2, so (1/(4\u03c0)^2)^3=1/(4\u03c0)^6. The numerical \u221a2 and 8 come from field\u2010normalization and combinatorial symmetry factors in the Feynman rules. Finally, (Q/M)^2 is the dimensionless ratio of the external momentum scale Q to a heavy\u2010mass scale M, showing the diagram\u2019s suppression by two powers of Q/M.; answer - \u03b1^3: three gauge\u2010interaction vertices; g^2: two vertices of a second interaction (e.g. Yukawa or scalar coupling); \u221a2: field normalization or Clebsch\u2013Gordan factor; 8: combinatorial/symmetry factor of the diagram; 1/(4\u03c0)^6: three loop integrals in four dimensions (each contributes 1/(4\u03c0)^2); (Q/M)^2: kinematic suppression by two powers of the external momentum Q over the heavy mass scale M.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - In standard QFT perturbation theory each interaction vertex brings in one factor of its coupling constant.  Thus an amplitude proportional to \u03b1^n comes from n gauge\u2010interaction vertices; similarly a factor g^m comes from m of the second\u2010type vertices.  The number of loops L is not fixed by coupling powers alone but by the diagram topology via L = I \u2212 V + 1 (I = internal lines, V = total vertices).  Equivalently, since each loop integral \u222bd^4k/(2\u03c0)^4 contributes a factor 1/(4\u03c0)^2, an overall factor (1/(4\u03c0)^2)^L identifies L loops.  Hence powers of \u03b1 and g count vertices of each type, while loop order is determined separately from the exponent of the 1/(4\u03c0) factor or from the Euler relation relating I, V, and L.; answer - Each power of \u03b1 equals one gauge\u2010interaction vertex and each power of g equals one Yukawa/scalar vertex; loop order L is determined by topology via L=(exponent of (4\u03c0) denominator)/2 or by L=I\u2212V+1, not directly by coupling powers.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - In four-dimensional spacetime each independent momentum loop integral contributes a factor \u222bd^4k/(2\u03c0)^4 \u22431/(4\u03c0)^2. The given overall factor is (1/(4\u03c0))^6, which can be rewritten as (1/(4\u03c0)^2)^3. Matching these shows there must be three such loop integrals, since raising (1/(4\u03c0)^2) to the third power produces (1/(4\u03c0))^6.; answer - 3 loops\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - In four-dimensional QFT each independent loop integral brings in a factor \u222bd^4k/(2\u03c0)^4\u22431/(4\u03c0)^2. The size estimate has an overall factor (1/(4\u03c0))^6, which can be rewritten as (1/(4\u03c0)^2)^3, directly indicating three independent loop integrals. The powers of \u03b1 and g count vertices but do not affect the loop count.
