The number of loops L is not fixed by coupling powers alone but by the diagram topology via L = I − V + 1 (I = internal lines, V = total vertices).

Hence an overall factor α^3 signals three gauge‐interaction vertices, and g^2 signals two vertices of the second interaction. The loop count is determined by the topology (L=I−V+1) and shows up in the factor (1/(4π)^2)^L but does not introduce extra coupling powers beyond those fixed by the number of vertices.; answer: Each coupling constant exponent equals the number of its interaction vertices: α^3⇒3 α–vertices, g^2⇒2 g–vertices. Loops are counted separately via L=I−V+1 and give (1/(4π)^2)^L, but don’t add coupling powers directly.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent 3wxO, analyze coupling constants and loops, thinking: In perturbation theory each interaction vertex contributes one power of its coupling constant. Thus a diagram with V_α gauge vertices carries α^{V_α}, and one with V_g scalar or Yukawa vertices carries g^{V_g}. The overall loop order L is determined by the topology via L=I−V+1 (I = internal lines, V=total vertices), but in practice one identifies L by the power of the 1/(4π)^{2L} factors coming from loop integrals. Hence the powers of α and g directly count the number of their respective vertices, and the 1/(4π)^{2L} factor counts the number of loops.; answer: In standard QFT perturbation theory: every vertex of type-α contributes one factor α, and every vertex of type-g contributes one factor g. Therefore a contribution scaling like α^3 g^2 must come from exactly three α-type vertices and two g-type vertices. The loop count L is then fixed by the diagram’s topology and shows up as a factor (1/(4π)^{2})^L, so the coupling‐power count directly equals the number of vertices.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent iA7i, analyze (1/(4pi))^6 factor for loops, thinking: In four-dimensional QFT each loop momentum integral typically yields a factor of 1/(4π)^2.

The overall factor (1/(4π))^6 can be rewritten as (1/(4π)^2)^3, which directly indicates three independent loop integrals. The coupling constants α^3 and g^2 tell us there are three gauge vertices and two scalar/Yukawa vertices, but the number of loops comes solely from the power of the 1/(4π) factors. Hence the diagram contains three loops.; answer: 3 loops\n<SEPERATOR>\nCritic agent NG5Y, feedback: The estimation correctly observes that in four-dimensional QFT each independent loop integral symbolically brings in a factor of order (4π)⁻², so an overall (4π)⁻⁶ points to three loops. However, this counting is only a heuristic: it assumes Euclidean normalization for each momentum integral, ignores scheme- and gauge-dependent factors, omits potential symmetry or combinatorial prefactors, and treats all couplings uniformly even though α³ and g² could arise from different vertex types. Subdivergences or overlapping loops can alter the naive power of (4π) in ways that don’t map one-to-one onto the loop count.
