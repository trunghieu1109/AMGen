Question: Example(question='Your colleague has devised a new quantum field theory on four-dimensional spacetime, and is exploring the regularization of certain higher-order loop diagrams in that theory. On their desk you spy a scribbled note: a Feynman diagram, and next to it, the words "size estimate" followed by a string of physical constants, numbers, and ratios between what appear to be energy scales. The symbols read: alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2.\n\nThe diagram, unfortunately, has been rendered unreadable by a spilled coffee. How many loops did it contain?', choice1='3', choice2='1', choice3='2', choice4='6', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_49
proposed answer: In four-dimensional spacetime each loop integration contributes a factor ≃1/(4π)^2 in a perturbative size estimate. The scribbled note shows (1/(4π))^6 = (1/(4π)^2)^3, which directly implies there are three independent loop integrals. Among the given choices, only option A (3 loops) reproduces (1/(4π)^6). 1 loop would give (1/(4π)^2), 2 loops (1/(4π)^4), and 6 loops (1/(4π)^12). Hence the correct answer is A).
