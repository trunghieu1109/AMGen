The only possibilities are (m1=0, m2=–1) and (m1=–1, m2=0). The Clebsch–Gordan coefficients for j1=j2=1 coupling to J=2 give C(1,0;1,–1|2,–1)=1/√2 and C(1,–1;1,0|2,–1)=1/√2.

For m1 = –1 and m2 = –1, the sum is –2, which does not match –1.

However, this check alone has limitations: it only applies the simple projection‐sum selection rule and tells you when a coefficient is zero, not the actual nonzero values for other (m1,m2) pairs. It doesn’t provide magnitudes or phases of the surviving coefficients, nor does it substitute for a full CG table or analytic formula needed when coupling higher angular momenta or different l1,l2. Also, it assumes standard phase and normalization conventions and ignores any spin coupling or other interactions that might alter the physical basis.; answer: 0\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent INoC, refining Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, thinking: The Clebsch–Gordan coefficient ⟨1, m₁; 1, m₂ | 2, −1⟩ is nonzero only when m₁ + m₂ = −1.
