Question: Example(question='Consider two electrons are in p orbital angular momentum state. Ignoring there spin angular momentum, the coupled angular momentum state of the 2-electron system is represented by $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1,1, 2, -1>. Here, $l_1, l_2$ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of particles 1 and 2 respectively. And, $l, m$ are the total angular momentum quantum number and the corresponding Z component of the 2-electron system respectively. If measurement is made of the orbital angular momentum components $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, what is the joint probability of getting the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$?\n', choice1='1', choice2='1/2', choice3='0', choice4='2/3', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: The joint probability of measuring L₁z=−ħ and L₂z=−ħ in the coupled state |l₁=1, l₂=1; l=2, m=−1⟩ is given by |⟨1, m₁=−1; 1, m₂=−1 | 2, m=−1⟩|². Since m₁ + m₂ = −2 ≠ m = −1, the relevant Clebsch–Gordan coefficient is zero, yielding zero probability. Among the given options (1, 1/2, 0, 2/3), this corresponds to choice C).
