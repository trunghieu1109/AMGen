Question: Example(question='Enamine reactions include nucleophilic substitutions, electrophilic additions, and the condensation of secondary amines with carbonyl compounds to generate enamines. Enamine reactions are useful techniques for creating complex compounds with specified functional groups and stereochemistry.\nMention the product of the following reaction (B) and select the correct sequence of the reagents according to the reaction steps (A).\n(E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium + A ---> B', choice1='(i) LDA (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+, B = pentan-2-one + N,N-dimethylethanamine', choice2='(i) LDA (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+, B = heptan-4-one', choice3='(i) LDA, DME (ii) CH3CH2I (iii) H3O+ B = pentan-2-one + N,N-dimethylethanamine', choice4='A = (i) LDA, DME (ii) CH3CH2I (iii) H3O+ B = heptan-4-one', correct_index=4)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_9_37
proposed answer: The enamine first undergoes deprotonation by LDA in DME (step i), then SN2 alkylation with CH3CH2I (step ii), and finally acidic hydrolysis with H3O+ (step iii) to yield heptan-4-one. Only choice4 correctly lists these three steps separately and gives B = heptan-4-one. Therefore the correct answer is D.

Answer:D
Extracted answer: D
