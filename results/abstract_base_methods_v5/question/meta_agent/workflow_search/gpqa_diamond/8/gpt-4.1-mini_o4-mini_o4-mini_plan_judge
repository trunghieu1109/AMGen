proposed answer: From Sub-task 3, only the two large trifuran‐hexaone derivatives (choices 3 and 4) were found to possess a principal C₃ rotational axis. Sub-task 4 then showed that each of these planar molecules also has a horizontal mirror plane (σₕ) through the central ring, mapping their three identical arms above the plane onto the three below. Neither quinuclidine nor triisopropyl borate has both C₃ and σₕ elements. Therefore, only choice 3 (benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone) and choice 4 (triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone) satisfy the C₃h point group symmetry.

proposed answer: Based on the symmetry analyses in Sub-tasks 4 and 5, only triisopropyl borate possesses exactly the four operations of C3h (E, C3, C3², and a single σh) with no additional C2 axes, σv planes, inversion center, or improper axes. Quinuclidine lacks any C3 axis (C1 symmetry), and both polycyclic hexaones exhibit extra C2 axes, σv planes, and S3 operations characteristic of D3h. Therefore, the sole molecule with exactly C3h symmetry is triisopropyl borate.
