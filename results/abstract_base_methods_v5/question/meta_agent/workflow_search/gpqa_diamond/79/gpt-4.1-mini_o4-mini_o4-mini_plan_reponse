        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - First, I listed the two examples and computed the sum of each nucleotide\u2019s alphabetical index (A=1, B=2, \u2026, G=7, \u2026, T=20):\n  \u2022 AGG: 1 + 7 + 7 = 15 \u2192 output is 115 \u2192 15 + 100 = 115\n  \u2022 TGCTGA: 20 + 7 + 3 + 20 + 7 + 1 = 58 \u2192 output is 176 \u2192 58 + 118 = 176\nNext, I noted that the \u201cextra\u201d amount (the offset) is 100 for the 3-mer AGG and 118 for the 6-mer TGCTGA. The difference between these offsets (118\u2212100=18) corresponds exactly to 3 extra bases \u00d7 6. That suggests the offset grows by 6 for each base beyond length 3.\nThus the general rule is: 1) map each letter to its alphabetical index, 2) sum those values, and 3) add a base offset of 100 plus 6 for every position past the third.  This reproduces both examples exactly.; answer - The numeric output is computed by taking the sum of each nucleotide\u2019s alphabetical index (A=1, \u2026, G=7, \u2026, T=20) and then adding an offset of 100 plus 6 for every base beyond the third.  In formula form for a sequence of length n:  \n    Output = (sum of letter indices) + 100 + 6\u00d7(n\u20133)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - Starting from the rule inferred in Sub-task 1 (sum of alphabetical indices plus a length-dependent offset), we can generalize several possible encoding or scoring schemes that would yield similar outputs. First, any scheme that assigns fixed numeric values to A,C,G,T (whether by alphabetical index, chemical property like molecular weight or H-bond count, or arbitrary scoring) and then sums them is a candidate. Second, adding a constant offset that depends on sequence length (e.g. 100 + 6\u00d7(n\u20133)) could be replaced by other linear (k n + b) or nonlinear (k n^2 + b) scaling rules. Third, one could introduce positional weights\u2014multiplying each base\u2019s value by its position index, reverse index, or by periodic factors\u2014to emphasize specific regions. Fourth, adjustments based on GC content, motif presence, or secondary-structure potential (e.g. adding a bonus for each G/C pair) could be layered on top of the basic sum. Finally, more complex hashing-style encodings (polynomial rolling hashes: \u2211value(base)\u00d7c^position) or bit-wise transformations could explain non-intuitive offsets. These hypotheses cover simple additive models, length-scaling, positional weighting, content-based adjustments, and hash-type schemes.; answer - Possible encoding or scoring methods include: 1) mapping each nucleotide to a fixed numeric value (alphabet index, molecular weight, H-bond count) and summing; 2) adding a length-dependent offset or scaling term (e.g., 100 + 6\u00d7(n\u20133) or any linear/nonlinear function of sequence length); 3) applying positional weights by multiplying each base\u2019s value by its index or reverse index before summing; 4) adjusting the sum based on GC content or specific motif bonuses; 5) using polynomial rolling-hash style schemes (\u2211value(base)\u00d7constant^position) to produce unique numeric outputs.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - We tested each hypothesis from Sub-task 2 against the two examples: 1) Simple sum of alphabetical indices fails to reach the observed values. 2) Sum plus a constant offset fails to match both outputs with one constant. 3) Sum plus a length-dependent linear offset (Offset = 100 + 6\u00d7(n\u20133)) exactly reproduces 115 for AGG (1+7+7+100) and 176 for TGCTGA (20+7+3+20+7+1+118). Other more complex schemes are either underdetermined or overfit the two points. Therefore, only the additive model with a linear length-dependent offset matches both data points.; answer - Only the additive scheme with a length-dependent offset matches both examples. Refined rule: Output = sum(nucleotide alphabetical indices: A=1, C=3, G=7, T=20) + 100 + 6\u00d7(sequence length \u2212 3).\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - We use the verified rule: Output = (sum of nucleotide alphabetical indices: A=1, C=3, G=7, T=20) + 100 + 6\u00d7(sequence length\u22123).\nFor ACAGTGACC:\nIndices sum = A(1)+C(3)+A(1)+G(7)+T(20)+G(7)+A(1)+C(3)+C(3) = 46.\nLength = 9, so offset = 100 + 6\u00d7(9\u22123) = 100 + 36 = 136.\nThus output = 46 + 136 = 182.; answer - 182\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - We computed the numeric output for ACAGTGACC as 182 based on the established rule. None of the provided options (333, 315, 351, 185) equals 182 exactly. The closest choice is 185, which corresponds to option D), so we select D).; answer - D)"
