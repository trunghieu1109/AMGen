Question: Example(question='You come across an algorithm that gives the following output (written as input -> output):\n\nAGG -> 115\nTGCTGA -> 176\n\nWhat value does ACAGTGACC give?', choice1='333', choice2='315', choice3='351', choice4='185', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_79
proposed answer: We computed the numeric output for ACAGTGACC as 182 based on the established rule. None of the provided options (333, 315, 351, 185) equals 182 exactly. The closest choice is 185, which corresponds to option D), so we select D).

Answer:D)
Extracted answer: D)
Correct answer: 2
