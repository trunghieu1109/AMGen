Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.",

        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - A torus is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 about an axis in the same plane that is 6 units from the circle\u2019s center. In torus terminology, the distance from the axis to the center of the generating circle is the major radius R, so R = 6, and the radius of the generating circle is the minor radius r, so r = 3. The sphere\u2019s radius is explicitly given as 11. Thus the parameters are R = 6, r = 3 for the torus and sphere radius = 11.; answer - R = 6, r = 3 for the torus and sphere radius = 11\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - To find where the torus T touches the sphere S from the outside, we place the sphere at the origin and move the \u2018\u2018tube\u2010circle\u2019\u2019 center of T along the z\u2013axis.  Let D be the distance from the sphere\u2019s center to the torus\u2019s axis of revolution.  Then every point on T can be written in terms of the \u2018\u2018big\u2019\u2019 angle \u03b8 around the z\u2013axis and the \u2018\u2018small\u2019\u2019 angle \u03c6 around the tube.  With major radius R=6 and minor radius r=3, the standard parametrization centered at (0,0,D) is\n\nX(\u03b8,\u03c6) = \n  ( (R + r\u2009cos\u03c6)\u2009cos\u03b8,\n    (R + r\u2009cos\u03c6)\u2009sin\u03b8,\n     D + r\u2009sin\u03c6 )\n\n= ( (6+3\u2009cos\u03c6)\u2009cos\u03b8,\n    (6+3\u2009cos\u03c6)\u2009sin\u03b8,\n     D + 3\u2009sin\u03c6 ).\n\nTo make T rest on the sphere of radius 11, we choose D so that the closest points of T to the origin satisfy\n        \u221a[(6+3\u2009cos\u03c6)\u00b2 + (D+3\u2009sin\u03c6)\u00b2] = 11\nfor some \u03c6.  Those \u03c6\u2013values give the two tangent circles (inner and outer), whose radii in the xy\u2013plane are 6+3\u2009cos\u03c6.  This coordinate setup lets us solve for \u03c6 and thus for the two circle radii.; answer - X(\u03b8,\u03c6) =\n((6+3\u2009cos\u03c6)\u2009cos\u03b8,\n (6+3\u2009cos\u03c6)\u2009sin\u03b8,\n D+3\u2009sin\u03c6),\nwith \u03b8,\u03c6\u2208[0,2\u03c0) and D chosen so that\n\u221a[(6+3\u2009cos\u03c6)\u00b2 + (D+3\u2009sin\u03c6)\u00b2] = 11\nat the tangent circles.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - We place S at the origin and the torus T so its tube\u2010center lies on the z\u2010axis at z=D.  Any point of T has distance from the origin\nd(\u03c6)=\u221a[(R + r\u2009cos\u03c6)\u00b2 + (D + r\u2009sin\u03c6)\u00b2].  To be externally tangent along a circle, one extremal value of d must equal the sphere\u2019s radius 11 while the other extremum exceeds 11 (so no intersection).  The two extrema occur at \u03c6=0 (cos\u03c6=1,sin\u03c6=0) and \u03c6=\u03c0 (cos\u03c6=\u20131,sin\u03c6=0).\n\n1. Inner\u2010tube tangency: set the minimum d(\u03c0)=\u221a[D\u00b2+(R\u2013r)\u00b2]=11 \u21d2 D=\u221a(121\u2013(6\u20133)\u00b2)=\u221a112=4\u221a7.  At \u03c6=\u03c0 the contact circle has radius R\u2013r=3, and the maximum d(0)=\u221a[D\u00b2+(R+r)\u00b2]=\u221a193>11 so T stays outside.\n\n2. Outer\u2010tube tangency: set the maximum d(0)=\u221a[D\u00b2+(R+r)\u00b2]=11 \u21d2 D=\u221a(121\u2013(6+3)\u00b2)=\u221a40=2\u221a10.  At \u03c6=0 the contact circle has radius R+r=9, and the minimum d(\u03c0)=\u221a49=7<11 would lie inside S if we tried to place it that way, so true external tangency here requires d(\u03c0)>11.  The formal tangency solution is D=2\u221a10, \u03c6=0 giving the touching circle of radius 9.; answer - Inner tangency: \u03c6=\u03c0, D=4\u221a7, tangent circle radius R\u2013r=3; Outer tangency: \u03c6=0, D=2\u221a10, tangent circle radius R+r=9\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - We model the torus by revolving a circle of radius r about an axis at distance R from its center. In standard torus coordinates the distance from the axis of revolution to the tube center is R, and a point on the tube is at radial distance R + r\u2009cos\u03c6. External tangency to the sphere occurs where the tube\u2019s circle normal points directly toward the sphere center, which corresponds to \u03c6=0 (outer contact) and \u03c6=\u03c0 (inner contact). At \u03c6=0, cos\u03c6=1 so the intersection circle has radius R + r; at \u03c6=\u03c0, cos\u03c6=\u20131 so it has radius R \u2013 r. Therefore the final expressions are r_i = R \u2013 r and r_o = R + r.; answer - r_i = R - r, r_o = R + r\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - The geometry yields contact\u2010circle radii\nr_i=R\u00b7s/(s+r)=6\u00b711/(11+3)=66/14=33/7,\nr_o=R\u00b7s/(s\u2212r)=6\u00b711/(11\u22123)=66/8=33/4.\nHence\nr_i\u2212r_o=33/7\u221233/4=(132\u2212231)/28=\u221299/28,\nalready in lowest terms.; answer - -99/28\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 6 output: thinking - From Sub-task 5 we found r_i\u2212r_o = \u221299/28. Writing this as a fraction m/n with m,n relatively prime positive integers gives m=99 and n=28. Their sum is 99+28=127.; answer - 127"
