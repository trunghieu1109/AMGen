Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

The standard parametrization of a torus of major radius R and minor radius r in ℝ³ is\n\n  T(u,v) = ((R + r\u2009cos\u2009v)\u2009cos\u2009u,\n            (R + r\u2009cos\u2009v)\u2009sin\u2009u,\n             r\u2009sin\u2009v),\n\nwith 0 ≤ u < 2π and 0 ≤ v < 2π.  Here u parametrizes the circular centerline of radius R in the xy-plane, and v runs around the generating circle of radius r in a plane perpendicular to that centerline.  Since R=6 and r=3, plugging these in gives a concrete form.  Having the torus in this form lets us compute the distance from any point T(u,v) to the center of the sphere (which we may place at the origin) and impose the tangency condition |T(u,v)|=11.; answer: T(u,v) = ((6 + 3\u2009cos\u2009v)\u2009cos\u2009u,\n           (6 + 3\u2009cos\u2009v)\u2009sin\u2009u,\n            3\u2009sin\u2009v),\nfor 0 ≤ u < 2π, 0 ≤ v < 2π.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent NBZW, expressing torus parametrically, thinking: To analyze tangency with the sphere x²+y²+z²=11², it’s simplest to place the sphere’s center at the origin and align the torus’s symmetry axis with the z-axis.  In torus notation the major radius R=6 (distance from axis to center of generating circle) and the minor radius r=3 (radius of generating circle).  A point on the (unshifted) torus is given by two angles u (around the axis) and v (around the generating circle).  To model the torus “resting” on the sphere, we then translate it along z by an unknown d so that it just touches the sphere.  Plugging this parametric form into x²+y²+z²=121 lets us solve for the contact positions and hence the radii of the tangent circles.; answer: A convenient parametrization of T (before vertical shift) is for 0≤u,v<2π:  \n x(u,v) = (6 + 3\u2009cos\u2009v)\u2009cos\u2009u\n y(u,v) = (6 + 3\u2009cos\u2009v)\u2009sin\u2009u\n z(u,v) = 3\u2009sin\u2009v\n\nTo allow the torus to rest on the sphere, translate it upward by d along the z-axis.  The translated torus is  \n x(u,v) = (6 + 3\u2009cos\u2009v)\u2009cos\u2009u\n y(u,v) = (6 + 3\u2009cos\u2009v)\u2009sin\u2009u\n z(u,v) = d + 3\u2009sin\u2009v\n\nWe then impose the sphere’s equation x²+y²+z²=11² and choose d so the surface is tangent.  This parametrization lets us solve for the angles u,v at tangency and thus compute the radii of the contact circles r_i and r_o.\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent 2AIp, determining tangent positions, thinking: We place the sphere of radius 11 at the origin and the torus tube–circle center on the z–axis at distance D.  Any torus point is at distance sqrt((R+ r cosφ)² + (D+ r sinφ)²) from the origin.  External tangency occurs when that distance attains exactly 11 at an extremum in φ.  The minimum distance occurs when φ=π (cosφ=–1) and equals sqrt(D² + (R–r)²), so setting sqrt(D² + (6–3)²)=11 gives D²+9=121 ⇒ D=√112=4√7 for the “inner” tangent circle of radius R–r=3.  The maximum distance occurs when φ=0 (cosφ=1) and equals sqrt(D² + (R+r)²), so sqrt(D² + (6+3)²)=11 ⇒ D²+81=121 ⇒ D=√40=2√10 for the “outer” tangent circle of radius R+r=9.; answer: The two resting positions are: (1) Inner tangency: D=4√7, tangent at φ=π, giving a circle of radius R–r=3. (2) Outer tangency: D=2√10, tangent at φ=0, giving a circle of radius R+r=9.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCritic agent WSau, feedback: The two positions D = √112 and D = √40 indeed solve the two extremal‐distance equations at φ = π (inner tangency) and φ = 0 (outer tangency). However, to ensure the torus merely touches the sphere and does not intersect it elsewhere, one must also require that the other extremal distance lies strictly beyond the sphere’s radius.; correct: For inner tangency (contact at φ = π):\n  D² + (R − r)² = 11²  and  D² + (R + r)² > 11².\nWith R = 6, r = 3 this is 112 + 9 = 121 and 112 + 81 = 193 > 121.\nFor outer tangency (contact at φ = 0):\n  D² + (R + r)² = 11²  and  D² + (R − r)² > 11².\nThis gives 40 + 81 = 121 and 40 + 9 = 49 < 121 (so the second inequality holds strictly in the opposite sense to prevent intersection).\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent 2AIp, refining tangent positions, thinking: We place S at the origin and the torus T so its tube‐center lies on the z‐axis at z=D.  Any point of T has distance from the origin\nd(φ)=√[(R + r\u2009cosφ)² + (D + r\u2009sinφ)²].  To be externally tangent along a circle, one extremal value of d must equal the sphere’s radius 11 while the other extremum exceeds 11 (so no intersection).

External tangency to the sphere occurs where the tube’s circle normal points directly toward the sphere center, which corresponds to φ=0 (outer contact) and φ=π (inner contact).

When the torus rests on the sphere, the surfaces are tangent along a ring at minor‐circle angle φ satisfying (R + r cos φ)/cos φ = ±s.  The “inner” contact uses the minus sign: cos φ = –R/(s + r), giving contact‐circle radius r_i = R + r cos φ = R\u2009s/(s + r).  The “outer” contact uses the plus sign: cos φ = R/(s – r), giving r_o = R\u2009s/(s – r).  Hence r_i – r_o = R\u2009s(1/(s + r) – 1/(s – r)) = –2\u2009R\u2009s\u2009r/(s^2 – r^2).
