Question: Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.
[asy] size(10cm); usepackage("tikz");label("egin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(2,0)--(2,3)--(5,3)--(5,8)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}",origin); label("\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(0,3)--(3,3)--(3,5)--(8,5)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}",E); [/asy]

proposed answer: A path with exactly 4 direction changes has 5 alternating segments of rights (R) and ups (U).  If it starts with R there are 3 R‐segments summing to 8 rights and 2 U‐segments summing to 8 ups.  The number of positive compositions is C(8−1,3−1)·C(8−1,2−1)=C(7,2)·C(7,1)=21·7=147.  Similarly, starting with U also gives 147.  By sub‐task 7 each segment assignment yields exactly one path, so the total is 147+147=294.
