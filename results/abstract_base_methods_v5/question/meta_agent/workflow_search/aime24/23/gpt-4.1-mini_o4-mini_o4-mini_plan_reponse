A natural choice is to let the top row cells from left to right be a, b, and c, and the bottom row cells from left to right be d, e, and f. Reading each row left to right forms a three-digit number: the top row yields 100a + 10b + c, and the bottom row yields 100d + 10e + f.; answer - Let the top\u2010row digits be a, b, c (left to right) and the bottom\u2010row digits be d, e, f.

        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - We need to name each of the six cells so that we can write down the two horizontal numbers in terms of these variables. Since the example shows that leading zeros are dropped (e.g. 0\u20090\u20098 becomes the one\u2010digit number 8), we define the top row digits as a, b, c and the bottom row digits as d, e, f. Reading each row left to right gives a three\u2010digit expression (100a+10b+c for the top row and 100d+10e+f for the bottom), but we interpret any leading zeros by dropping them: so if a=0 the top row number becomes the two\u2010digit number 10b+c, and if also b=0 it becomes the one\u2010digit number c (and similarly for the bottom row). This exactly matches the example and captures the allowance for horizontal numbers of varying digit lengths.; answer - Let the six cells be labeled a,b,c in the top row and d,e,f in the bottom row.  The two horizontal numbers are then\nTop row number = 100a + 10b + c (interpreted by dropping any leading zeros),\nBottom row number = 100d + 10e + f (ditto).\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - We defined the top row number as 100a+10b+c (dropping leading zeros) and the bottom row as 100d+10e+f (ditto). The problem states that these two horizontal numbers must sum to 999, just as in the example 8+991=999. Therefore, regardless of any leading zeros, the algebraic sum of the full three-digit expressions equals 999.; answer - (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - To form the vertical numbers, we read down each column. In column 1 the top digit is a and the bottom is d, so the two-digit expression is 10a+d. If a=0 we drop that leading zero, leaving the one-digit number d, as in the example. The same logic applies to the other columns: for column 2 we get 10b+e (dropping b if zero) and for column 3 we get 10c+f (dropping c if zero).; answer - First vertical number (column 1): 10a + d (interpreted by dropping the leading a if a=0). Second vertical number (column 2): 10b + e (dropping b if b=0). Third vertical number (column 3): 10c + f (dropping c if c=0).\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - In subtask 3 we defined the three vertical numbers by reading each column top to bottom as 10a+d, 10b+e, and 10c+f (with any leading zero digit dropping the tens place). The problem statement requires that the sum of these three vertical numbers equals 99. Therefore, summing the three expressions directly yields the desired equation. This algebraic form naturally accounts for dropped leading zeros since if a, b, or c is zero, the corresponding term 10\u00b70+x reduces to x, matching the single\u2010digit interpretation.; answer - (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - We verify the horizontal model: (100a+10b+c)+(100d+10e+f)=999. This captures any 3\u2010digit number (including leading zeros) since 008 is treated as 100\u00b70+10\u00b70+8=8. The sum 008+991=999 matches the example, and the algebraic form enforces the total 999. For the vertical model: (10a+d)+(10b+e)+(10c+f)=99. Each column number is 10\u00b7(top digit)+(bottom digit), automatically reducing to a single digit when the top is zero, matching 9+9+81=99. Summing gives 10(a+b+c)+(d+e+f)=99, exactly the needed constraint. There is no mismatch of digit lengths or place values, and leading zeros are harmless in the algebraic form. Thus both equations fully and correctly represent the problem requirements, and no adjustments are necessary.; answer - The equations (100a+10b+c)+(100d+10e+f)=999 and (10a+d)+(10b+e)+(10c+f)=99 correctly model all horizontal and vertical sum constraints with proper place values, including allowance for leading zeros.

Define carry variables:\n   c0 = 0 (initial carry into units place),\n   c1 = carry from units to tens,\n   c2 = carry from tens to hundreds,\n   c3 = carry from hundreds to thousands (must be 0 since 999 is three\u2010digit).\n\n2. Units\u2010place addition:\n   c0 + c + f = 9 + 10\u00b7c1\n   \u21d2 c + f = 9 + 10\u00b7c1,   c1 \u2208 {0,1}\n   Since c,f \u22649, c+f \u226418 \u21d2 the only way to reach 19 is c1=1 with c+f=19 (impossible).\n   Therefore c1=0 and c+f=9.\n\n3. Tens\u2010place addition:\n   b + e + c1 = 9 + 10\u00b7c2\n   \u21d2 b + e = 9 + 10\u00b7c2,   c2 \u2208 {0,1}\n   Since b,e \u22649, b+e \u226418 \u21d2 to reach 19 requires c2=1 and b+e=19 (impossible).\n   Therefore c2=0 and b+e=9.\n\n4. Hundreds\u2010place addition:\n   a + d + c2 = 9 + 10\u00b7c3\n   \u21d2 a + d = 9 + 10\u00b7c3,   but c3 must be 0 (no overflow beyond hundreds).\n   Therefore c3=0 and a+d=9.\n\nConclusion: All carries c1, c2, c3 are zero, and the digit\u2010pair sums are exactly 9 in each place: c+f=9, b+e=9, a+d=9. This matches the example and fully captures carry behavior.; answer - Define carries c0=0, c1,c2,c3. Units: c0+c+f=9+10c1 \u21d2 c+f=9+10c1, c1\u2208{0,1}. Tens: b+e+c1=9+10c2 \u21d2 b+e=9+10c2, c2\u2208{0,1}. Hundreds: a+d+c2=9+10c3 \u21d2 a+d=9+10c3, c3=0.  Digit bounds force c1=c2=c3=0, yielding c+f=9, b+e=9, a+d=9.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 6b output: thinking - From subtask_6a we have carries c1=c2=c3=0 and the digit\u2010pair sums a+d=9, b+e=9, c+f=9. From subtask_4 the vertical sum gives (10a+d)+(10b+e)+(10c+f)=99, i.e. 10(a+b+c)+(d+e+f)=99. But note (a+d)+(b+e)+(c+f)=9+9+9=27 so (a+b+c)+(d+e+f)=27. Call S1=a+b+c and S2=d+e+f; then S1+S2=27 and 10S1+S2=99. Subtracting yields 9S1=72, so S1=8 and S2=19. Thus a+b+c=8 and d+e+f=19. These new constraints are consistent with and complete the carry analysis and match the example (0+0+8=8, 9+9+1=19).; answer - The carries remain c1=c2=c3=0, with a+d=9, b+e=9, c+f=9, and the vertical sum forces a+b+c=8 and d+e+f=19.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 7 output: thinking - The key is that any multi-digit number cannot start with 0. We have two horizontal numbers (3\u2010digit top: abc and 3\u2010digit bottom: def) and three vertical 2\u2010digit numbers (ad, be, cf). For each of these the first digit must be 1\u20139. Thus:\n\n1. Top row horizontal (abc) \u21d2 a\u22600.\n2. Bottom row horizontal (def) \u21d2 d\u22600.\n3. First vertical (ad) \u21d2 a\u22600 (already covered).\n4. Second vertical (be) \u21d2 b\u22600.\n5. Third vertical (cf) \u21d2 c\u22600.\n\nNo further leading\u2010zero constraints apply to e or f (they are always in unit\u2019s place). Hence the refined formatting constraints are: a,b,c,d\u2208{1,\u2026,9}, e,f\u2208{0,\u2026,9}.; answer - Enforce that any digit in the leading position of a multi-digit number is nonzero. Concretely:\n\u2022 a\u22600 (for 3-digit number abc and 2-digit ad)\n\u2022 d\u22600 (for 3-digit number def)\n\u2022 b\u22600 (for 2-digit be)\n\u2022 c\u22600 (for 2-digit cf)\nThus a,b,c,d\u2208{1,\u2026,9}, e,f\u2208{0,\u2026,9}.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 8 output: thinking - We have a 2\u00d73 grid with digits a,b,c in the top row and d,e,f in the bottom row.  The horizontal\u2010sum equation abc+def=999 yields 100(a+d)+10(b+e)+(c+f)=999, so\n  a+d=9,\n  b+e=9,\n  c+f=9.\nThe vertical\u2010sum equation ad+be+cf=99 gives 10(a+b+c)+(d+e+f)=99.  But d+e+f=(a+d)+(b+e)+(c+f)\u2212(a+b+c)=27\u2212(a+b+c), so\n  10(a+b+c)+27\u2212(a+b+c)=99 \u21d2 9(a+b+c)=72 \u21d2 a+b+c=8.\nHence a,b,c are positive integers summing to 8, each \u22651 (no leading zeros), and d=9\u2212a>0, e=9\u2212b, f=9\u2212c.  The positive solutions of a+b+c=8 are C(7,2)=21 triples.  Explicitly, for each (a,b,c) we compute (d,e,f)=(9\u2212a,9\u2212b,9\u2212c).  This yields exactly 21 assignments.; answer - There are 21 solutions, listed as sextuples (a,b,c; d,e,f):\n(1,1,6;8,8,3), (1,2,5;8,7,4), (1,3,4;8,6,5), (1,4,3;8,5,6), (1,5,2;8,4,7), (1,6,1;8,3,8),\n(2,1,5;7,8,4), (2,2,4;7,7,5), (2,3,3;7,6,6), (2,4,2;7,5,7), (2,5,1;7,4,8),\n(3,1,4;6,8,5), (3,2,3;6,7,6), (3,3,2;6,6,7), (3,4,1;6,5,8),\n(4,1,3;5,8,6), (4,2,2;5,7,7), (4,3,1;5,6,8),\n(5,1,2;4,8,7), (5,2,1;4,7,8),\n(6,1,1;3,8,8).\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 9 output: thinking - The enumeration from subtask_8 only included triples (a,b,c) summing to 8 with a,b,c\u22651, which automatically ensures that the three\u2010digit numbers read left to right never have leading zeros. Likewise d,e,f=9\u2212(a,b,c) are also \u22651 through \u22648, so none of the six\u2010digit assignments place a zero in a leading position of any of the five numbers being summed. Since the problem\u2019s example does allow leading zeros but our enumeration already enforced nonzero leads where required, all 21 listed solutions remain valid.
