Question: Find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid so that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is $999$, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is $99$. The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$.
\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\ \hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\ \hline \end{array}\]

proposed answer: From subtask 7, each nonnegative triple (a,b,c) with a+b+c=8 and 0≤a,b,c≤8 yields a valid grid, and there are C(8+3−1,2)=C(10,2)=45 such triples. Hence there are 45 valid assignments.

proposed answer: In sub-task 9 we verified that none of the 21 triples (a,b,c) with a+b+c=8 (and corresponding d,e,f=9–a,9–b,9–c) violate any leading‐zero constraints. The horizontal sums (two 3-digit numbers adding to 999) and the vertical sums (three 2-digit numbers adding to 99) remain satisfied for each of these assignments. Since no solutions were excluded, the total number of valid digit assignments remains 21.
