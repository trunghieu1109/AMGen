Question: Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.

proposed answer: From the known result that positions where n≡0 mod 5 are losing for the first player (Alice), Bob wins exactly for those n. We count positive multiples of 5 up to 2024: k·5≤2024 ⇒ k≤404.8 ⇒ k=1,…,404, giving 404 values.

Answer:404

proposed answer: In the subtraction game where each player may remove 1 or 4 tokens and the player to take the last token wins, the P-positions (positions losing for the player about to move) are exactly those n with n≡0 or 2 (mod 5). Since Alice moves first, any initial P-position guarantees a win for Bob. To count how many n≤2024 satisfy n≡0 or 2 mod 5:
• There are ⌊2024/5⌋=404 full blocks of five, each contributing one n≡0 mod 5 and one n≡2 mod 5.  
• In the remaining numbers 2021,2022,2023,2024 (remainders 1,2,3,4), only 2022≡2 mod 5 adds one more P-position.  
Thus #n≡0 mod 5 = 404, #n≡2 mod 5 = 404+1 = 405, giving a total of 404+405 = 809. No alternative interpretation changes this result.
