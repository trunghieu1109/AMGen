        "problem": "Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.",

        "response": "First, from Sub-task 6 we determined that at speed s+0.5=3.0 km/h, Aya\u2019s walking time for 9 km is 9/3=3 hours. Converting 3 hours to minutes gives 3\u00d760=180 minutes. Adding the coffee-shop stop t=24 minutes yields a total of 180+24=204 minutes.\n\nAnswer:204",
        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The total time consists of walking time plus coffee shop time. At speed s km/h, walking 9 km takes 9/s hours. The coffee stop time t is in minutes, which is t/60 hours. Their sum equals the given total of 4 hours. Thus the equation is 9/s + t/60 = 4.; answer - 9/s + t/60 = 4\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - The total time consists of the walking time plus the coffee\u2010shop stop time. At speed (s+2) km/h, the 9 km walk takes 9/(s+2) hours. The coffee stop lasts t minutes, i.e. t/60 hours. The given total time is 2 hours 24 minutes = 2 + 24/60 = 2.4 hours. Thus: 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4.; answer - 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - To solve the system in one unit, we convert every time term to minutes because t is already in minutes and this avoids mixing hours and minutes. 1 hour = 60 minutes, so: 4 h = 4\u00d760 = 240 min; 2 h 24 min = 2\u00d760 + 24 = 144 min. The walking time at speed s is 9/s hours, which is (9/s)\u00d760 = 540/s minutes; at speed (s+2) is 9/(s+2) hours = 540/(s+2) minutes. Substituting gives two linear equations in t and s entirely in minutes.; answer - Converting everything to minutes:\n\u2022 4 h = 240 min, 2 h 24 min = 144 min\n\u2022 Walking times: (9/s) h = 540/s min, (9/(s+2)) h = 540/(s+2) min\nThus the system becomes:\n540/s + t = 240\n540/(s+2) + t = 144\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - To express the total time consist\u00adently in hours, we note that walking time = distance/speed and the coffee-shop time t minutes = t/60 hours.  \n\n1. At speed s: walking time = 9/s hours, coffee stop = t/60 hours, total = 4 hours.  \n2. At speed s+2: walking time = 9/(s+2) hours, coffee stop = t/60 hours, total = 2 hours 24 minutes = 2.4 hours.  \n\nHence the two equations follow directly by summing these components.; answer - 9/s + t/60 = 4   and   9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - We are given two equations: 9/s + t/60 = 4 and 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4. Subtracting the second from the first eliminates t/60 and yields 9/s - 9/(s+2) = 1.6, which simplifies to 18/[s(s+2)] = 1.6. Solving gives s(s+2) = 11.25, so s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0. The quadratic formula yields s = (\u22122 \u00b1 7)/2; taking the positive root gives s = 2.5 km/h. Substituting back into 9/s + t/60 = 4 gives t/60 = 4 - 3.6 = 0.4, so t = 24 minutes. Thus the final values are s = 2.5 km/h and t = 24 minutes.; answer - s = 2.5 km/h and t = 24 minutes\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 6 output: thinking - From subtask 5 we have s = 2.5 km/h and t = 24 minutes. At speed s + 0.5 = 3.0 km/h, the walking time for 9 km is 9 / 3 = 3 hours, which is 180 minutes. Adding the 24-minute coffee break gives 180 + 24 = 204 minutes total.; answer - 204 minutes\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 7 output: thinking - First, from Sub-task 6 we determined that at speed s+0.5=3.0 km/h, Aya\u2019s walking time for 9 km is 9/3=3 hours. Converting 3 hours to minutes gives 3\u00d760=180 minutes. Adding the coffee-shop stop t=24 minutes yields a total of 180+24=204 minutes.; answer - 204"
