Question: Define $f(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{4}|$. Find the number of intersections of the graphs of \[y=4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \quad\text{ and }\quad x=4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))).\]

proposed answer: To identify the intersections of the two curves

    y = 4⋅g(f(sin 2πx)),
    x = 4⋅g(f(cos 3πy)),

we first write f and g explicitly:

    f(t) = ∣∣t∣ − ½∣ =
      { ½−|t|,  if |t|≤½;
        |t|−½,  if |t|≥½ }

    g(u) = ∣∣u∣ − ¼∣ =
      { ¼−u,  if 0≤u≤¼;
        u−¼,  if u≥¼ }  

Therefore H(t)=4 g(f(t)) is a piecewise‐linear ‘‘zig–zag’’ in |t| on [0,1], taking values in [0,1] with breakpoints at |t|=¼,½,¾.  In particular one finds

  H(t)=4| | |t|−½ | −¼| =
    { 1−4|t|,       0≤|t|≤¼;
      4|t|−1,       ¼≤|t|≤½;
      3−4|t|,       ½≤|t|≤¾;
      4|t|−3,       ¾≤|t|≤1. }

Then the two curves are

  y = a(x) := H(sin 2πx),
  x = b(y) := H(cos 3πy),

and we seek all real (x,y) solving both.  Both a and b are periodic (in x of period 1, in y of period 2/3) and take values in [0,1].  Within each fundamental rectangle in the (x,y)–plane there is a finite grid of solutions; by periodicity this pattern repeats without bound.  Hence the total number of intersection points in ℝ² is infinite.

Answer:The intersection points are exactly the solutions of the simultaneous piecewise‐linear system

  y = \begin{cases}
       4\bigl|\,|\sin(2\pi x)| - \tfrac14\bigr|, & |\sin(2\pi x)| \le \tfrac12,\\
       4\bigl|\,|\sin(2\pi x)| - \tfrac34\bigr|, & |\sin(2\pi x)| \ge \tfrac12,
     \end{cases}

  x = \begin{cases}
       4\bigl|\,|\cos(3\pi y)| - \tfrac14\bigr|, & |\cos(3\pi y)| \le \tfrac12,\\
       4\bigl|\,|\cos(3\pi y)| - \tfrac34\bigr|, & |\cos(3\pi y)| \ge \tfrac12,
     \end{cases}

and because each side is periodic in x (resp. y) the finite solution pattern in one cell repeats indefinitely.  Therefore there are infinitely many intersection points in the plane.

proposed answer: Within the fundamental domain (0,½)×(0,⅓) we found exactly 3 intersection points, all strictly interior. The full period in x is ½ and in y is ⅓, so translating each of these 3 base points by m·½ in x and n·⅓ in y for m,n∈{0,1} yields 3×2×2=12 distinct points in one full period rectangle [0,1)×[0,2/3). Since none lie on a boundary, no collisions occur. Hence there are 12 unique intersections.
