        "problem": "Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\\{1,2,3,\\cdots,9,10\\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.",

        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - To choose 4 distinct numbers from a set of 10, we use combinations without regard to order. The number is \u201c10 choose 4\u201d, which equals 10!/(4!\u00b76!) = (10\u00d79\u00d78\u00d77)/(4\u00d73\u00d72\u00d71) = 210.; answer - 210\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - To determine the total number of ways the lottery can choose 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1, 2, \u2026, 10}, we recognize that order does not matter (drawing {1,3,5,7} is the same outcome as {7,5,3,1}). Therefore, we use the binomial coefficient for combinations: C(n, k) = n!\u2044(k! (n\u2013k)!). Here, n = 10 and k = 4, so:\n\nC(10, 4) = 10! / (4! \u00b7 6!)\n         = (10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 7) / (4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1)\n         = 5040 / 24\n         = 210\n\nThus, there are 210 possible ways to draw 4 distinct numbers from 10.; answer - 210\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - We consider a fixed random draw of 4 winning numbers from S. Jen\u2019s pick must contain exactly k of these winning numbers and the remaining 4\u2212k numbers must come from the 6 non-winning numbers.  \nNumber of ways = C(4, k) \u00d7 C(6, 4\u2212k).  \nFor k=2: C(4,2)\u00d7C(6,2)=6\u00d715=90.  \nFor k=3: C(4,3)\u00d7C(6,1)=4\u00d76=24.  \nFor k=4: C(4,4)\u00d7C(6,0)=1\u00d71=1.; answer - For k=2: 90 ways; for k=3: 24 ways; for k=4: 1 way.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - We know the counts for exactly k matches are: for k=2: 90 ways, for k=3: 24 ways, and for k=4: 1 way. The total number of winning outcomes (at least 2 matches) is the sum: 90 + 24 + 1 = 115.; answer - 115\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - To find P(grand prize | prize), we count outcomes where Jen matches all 4 drawn numbers (there is exactly 1 such outcome) and outcomes where she matches at least 2 numbers (90 outcomes for 2 matches + 24 for 3 matches + 1 for 4 matches = 115). Thus\nP(all 4 | \u22652) = 1/115.; answer - 1/115\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 6 output: thinking - To find the conditional probability P(grand prize | prize), we first count the number of ways Jen can match at least 2 of the 4 drawn numbers.  \n\nTotal prize\u2010winning outcomes (\u22652 matches):  \n- Exactly 2 matches: C(4,2) ways to pick which 2 of Jen\u2019s numbers match \u00d7 C(6,2) ways to pick the other 2 nonmatching drawn numbers = 6 \u00d7 15 = 90  \n- Exactly 3 matches: C(4,3) \u00d7 C(6,1) = 4 \u00d7 6 = 24  \n- Exactly 4 matches (grand prize): C(4,4) \u00d7 C(6,0) = 1 \u00d7 1 = 1  \n\nTotal = 90 + 24 + 1 = 115  \n\nFavorable outcomes for the grand prize = 1  \n\nThus P(grand prize | prize) = 1/115.  \nThis fraction is already in lowest terms (gcd(1,115)=1).; answer - 1/115\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 7 output: thinking - We know from sub-task 6 the conditional probability of the grand prize given a prize is 1/115, so m=1 and n=115. The question asks for m+n, which is 1+115=116.; answer - 116"
