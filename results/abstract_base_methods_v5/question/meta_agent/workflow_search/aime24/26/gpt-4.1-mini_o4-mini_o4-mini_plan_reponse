These sets B are exactly those with max(B)\u2208A. The sub\u2010task simply requires formalizing these definitions.; answer - Let A be a subset of the positive integers chosen by Alice.

From Sub\u2010task 3 we know this total is \u2211_{a\u2208A}2^{a\u22121}. So we must solve \u2211_{a\u2208A}2^{a\u22121}=2024.  Write 2024 in binary: 2024=2^{10}+2^{9}+2^{8}+2^{7}+2^{6}+2^{5}+2^{3}.

We know from the original problem that Alice picks a subset A of positive integers.

Observe that 2^{a\u22121} are powers of two, and any sum of distinct powers of two corresponds uniquely to the binary expansion of the sum. Write 2024 in binary: 2024_{10} = 11111101000_{2}. The 1\u2019s appear in positions (from 2^0 on the right) k = 3,5,6,7,8,9,10. That means 2024 = 2^3 + 2^5 + 2^6 + 2^7 + 2^8 + 2^9 + 2^{10}.

Since binary representations of integers are unique, no other choice of exponents (hence no other set A) can yield the same sum. For minimality, observe that each a in A contributes a nonzero term 2^{a\u22121}. Omitting any a would remove that term and strictly reduce the sum below 2024. Likewise, adding any extra a would introduce an extra power of two and increase the sum above 2024.
