Question: Alice chooses a set $A$ of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets $B$ of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of $B$ belongs to $A$. Bob's list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A.

proposed answer: From Sub‐task 5 we determined A={4,6,7,8,9,10,11}. To find the sum, add its elements: 4+6=10; 10+7=17; 17+8=25; 25+9=34; 34+10=44; 44+11=55. Therefore, the sum of the elements of A is 55.

proposed answer: I will restate the counting argument, show how the binary expansion pins down A, compute its sum, and explain uniqueness and minimality to ensure no steps are missed.

Answer:Final Integrated Summary:

1. Counting Formula:
   For any finite nonempty set B of positive integers with maximum element m, we must include m and decide independently for each of 1,2,…,m−1 whether to include it.  That yields 2^{m−1} possible sets B with max(B)=m.  Hence the total number of such sets B (over all m in A) is
      Σ_{a∈A} 2^{a−1} = 2024.

2. Binary Expansion Mapping:
   Write 2024 in base-2: 2024_{10} = 11111101000₂.  The 1‐bits occur at positions k = 3,5,6,7,8,9,10 (where the least significant bit is position 0).  Each term in the sum is 2^{a−1}, so we set a−1 = k, giving a = k+1.  Thus
      A = {4,6,7,8,9,10,11}.

3. Sum of Elements:
   Summing the elements of A: 4+6+7+8+9+10+11 = 55.

4. Uniqueness and Minimality:
   • Uniqueness follows from the uniqueness of the binary expansion of 2024: no other collection of distinct powers of two can sum to the same total.
   • Minimality holds because omitting any a removes its corresponding 2^{a−1} term and drops the sum below 2024, while adding any extra a would add a new power of two and raise the sum above 2024.

Therefore, the only solution is A={4,6,7,8,9,10,11}, and the sum of its elements is 55.
