I will introduce variables for cell contents and row/column colours, then state each condition formally and explain why this captures the original requirements.; answer - We label the 5 rows by i\u2208{1,\u2026,5} and the 5 columns by j\u2208{1,\u2026,5}.  Introduce three sets of variables:\n \u2022 x_{i,j}\u2208{0,W,B} records the content of cell (i,j): 0=empty, W=white chip, B=black chip.\n \u2022 r_i\u2208{\u229d,W,B} records the assigned colour of row i, where \u229d means \u201cno chip in row i.\u201d\n \u2022 c_j\u2208{\u229d,W,B} records the assigned colour of column j, with the same \u229d meaning.\n\nThen the four constraints become:\n\n(a) \u201cAt most one chip per cell\u201d is built in by x_{i,j}\u2208{0,W,B}.\n\n(b) \u201cAll chips in row i have the same colour\u201d\n    \u21d4 For each i, if x_{i,j}=c\u2208{W,B} for some j then r_i=c, and conversely if r_i=c then every x_{i,k}\u22600 must equal c.\n\n(c) \u201cAll chips in column j have the same colour\u201d\n    \u21d4 Analogously, for each j if x_{i,j}=c\u2208{W,B} then c_j=c, and if c_j=c then every x_{k,j}\u22600 equals c.\n\n(d) \u201cMaximality: no further chip can be added without breaking (b) or (c)\u201d\n    \u21d4 For every empty cell (i,j) with x_{i,j}=0, attempting to place either W or B must violate (b) or (c).  Equivalently,\n        \u2022 row i and column j must both already be coloured (r_i\u2260\u229d and c_j\u2260\u229d), and\n        \u2022 those two colours must differ (r_i\u2260c_j).\n\nHence the final formal system is:\n  1. x_{i,j}\u2208{0,W,B} for all i,j.\n  2. r_i,c_j\u2208{\u229d,W,B}.  If x_{i,j}=c\u2208{W,B} then r_i=c_j=c, and if r_i=c\u2208{W,B} then for all k with x_{i,k}\u22600 we have x_{i,k}=c (similarly for c_j).\n  3. \u2200(i,j): if x_{i,j}=0 then r_i\u2260\u229d, c_j\u2260\u229d, and r_i\u2260c_j.\n\nThis fully encodes (a)\u2013(d) in a compact algebraic form, matching the original problem statement.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - We need to express the requirement \u201call chips in row i have the same color\u201d and \u201call chips in column j have the same color\u201d by introducing row\u2010color and column\u2010color variables and then showing how a full placement is determined by them.  From Sub\u2010task 1 we already have r_i,c_j\u2208{\u229d,W,B}.  The uniformity then forces: whenever r_i=c_j\u2260\u229d, cell (i,j) is occupied by that color; whenever r_i\u2260c_j or one is \u229d, cell (i,j) remains empty.  Thus every valid chip arrangement corresponds exactly to a choice of (r_1,\u2026,r_5) and (c_1,\u2026,c_5).; answer - Introduce variables r_i,c_j\u2208{\u229d,W,B} for i,j=1\u20265.  Then impose:  \n\u2022 If r_i=c_j=W, place a white chip in cell (i,j).  \n\u2022 If r_i=c_j=B, place a black chip in cell (i,j).  \n\u2022 Otherwise leave (i,j) empty.  \nThis algebraic model captures the color\u2010uniformity constraints on rows and columns: each row i has color r_i and each column j has color c_j, and every filled cell (i,j) matches both its row and its column color.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - We model each row i and column j by colour variables r_i,c_j\u2208{\u229d,W,B}.  From sub-tasks 1 and 2 we know that a filled cell (i,j) exists exactly when r_i=c_j\u2208{W,B}, and empty otherwise.  The maximality condition requires that no empty cell can accept a chip of either colour without violating row\u2010 or column\u2010uniformity.  Consider any empty cell (i,j): it is empty because either r_i\u2260c_j or one of r_i,c_j is \u229d.  To forbid adding a W at (i,j), either r_i\u2260W or c_j\u2260W; similarly to forbid B we need r_i\u2260B or c_j\u2260B.  Together this forces r_i and c_j to both be assigned (no \u229d\u2019s) and to differ (r_i\u2260c_j), for every pair (i,j).  In particular, for fixed i varying j we see r_i must differ from every c_j, so all c_j must be equal to a single colour opposite r_i; and since this holds for every row the r_i are all the same.  Thus there are exactly two global assignments satisfying maximality: all five rows share one colour and all five columns share the other.; answer - The only maximal configurations are:\n1) r_1=\u2026=r_5 = White and c_1=\u2026=c_5 = Black;\n2) r_1=\u2026=r_5 = Black and c_1=\u2026=c_5 = White.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - Maximality requires that no empty cell allows placing a chip without violating uniformity. This means every row and every column must be assigned a colour and any row\u2013column pair must have opposite colours to block both white and black placements. The only global assignments satisfying this are all rows white with all columns black, or all rows black with all columns white. No other pattern prevents filling an empty cell.; answer - 1) All five rows = White, all five columns = Black; 2) All five rows = Black, all five columns = White.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - From Sub-task 4 we have exactly two maximal colour\u2010assignments: all rows white with all columns black, and all rows black with all columns white. In either case, each cell lies at the intersection of a row and column of opposite colours, so no chip can be placed without violating the row\u2010and\u2010column colour rule. Hence the only admissible placement for each configuration is the empty grid, which uses 0 chips and respects the 25\u2010chip limit. Therefore there is exactly one way per configuration, giving a total of 2 ways.; answer - 2\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 6 output: thinking - Sub-task 5 determined there are exactly 2 maximal configurations (all rows white/columns black and vice versa), each admitting exactly one admissible placement (the empty grid). Summing their counts gives 1+1=2.; answer - 2"

        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - We need to restate all four constraints (a\u2013d) precisely and then capture \u201cmaximality\u201d in a formal, testable condition. The key observation is that a placement is maximal exactly when no empty cell can legally accept a chip of either color without violating the row\u2010 or column\u2010monochromatic rule. To formalize this, we introduce row\u2010color variables R_i and column\u2010color variables C_j (each taking values in {white, black, undefined}). We define when a placement is valid, and then show that maximal means: for every empty cell (i,j), R_i and C_j must both be defined and opposite colors (so no legal chip can fit). This yields a crisp necessary and sufficient condition. In the reasoning above, we derived the exact logical statement and showed that in a full grid it is vacuously satisfied.; answer - Let the grid be indexed by rows i=1\u20265 and columns j=1\u20265. Define:  \u2022 P(i,j)\u2208{empty,white,black}  is the chip in cell (i,j).  \u2022 R_i\u2208{undefined,white,black}  is the color of row i, namely: if any P(i,j)\u2260empty then all such P(i,j) have the same color c and R_i=c; otherwise R_i=undefined.  \u2022 C_j similarly for column j.  Then the four constraints are:  (a) \u2200i,j: at most one chip in cell \u21d2 P(i,j)\u2260 both colors.  (b) Row\u2010monochromatic: \u2200i,j,k: if P(i,j) and P(i,k) are both nonempty then P(i,j)=P(i,k). Equivalently R_i is well\u2010defined.  (c) Column\u2010monochromatic: \u2200j,i,k: if P(i,j) and P(k,j) are nonempty then P(i,j)=P(k,j). Equivalently C_j is well\u2010defined.  (d) Maximality: no additional chip can be placed without breaking (b) or (c). Equivalently, for every empty cell (i,j) there is no color c\u2208{white,black} satisfying\n      (R_i is undefined or R_i=c)\n   and (C_j is undefined or C_j=c).\nIn fact one checks that this holds exactly when for every empty (i,j), both R_i and C_j are defined and R_i\u2260C_j.  In particular, if the grid is full (no empty cells), the condition is vacuously satisfied and the placement is maximal by definition.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - We need to express the row\u2010 and column\u2010monochromatic conditions purely in terms of assignments of a \u201crow color\u201d R_i\u2208{white,black,undefined} to each row i=1\u20265 and \u201ccolumn color\u201d C_j\u2208{white,black,undefined} to each column j=1\u20265.  Once these 10 variables are fixed, any placement that respects (b) and (c) must only put a white chip at (i,j) if R_i=C_j=white, a black chip if R_i=C_j=black, and leave (i,j) empty otherwise.  Thus all valid (b),(c)\u2010placements are in bijection with triples (R,C,S) where R=(R_1\u2026R_5), C=(C_1\u2026C_5) and S\u2286{(i,j):R_i=C_j\u2208{white,black}} is the chosen subset of \u201cmatching\u201d cells.  This model captures all uniform\u2010color row/column assignments (including uncolored rows/columns) and exactly encodes the allowed placements.; answer - A complete combinatorial model for the row/column color\u2010uniformity constraints is:\n\n\u2022 Variables:\n  \u2013 For each row i=1\u20265, assign R_i\u2208{white, black, undefined}.\n  \u2013 For each column j=1\u20265, assign C_j\u2208{white, black, undefined}.\n\n\u2022 Legal placements (satisfying (b) and (c)) then correspond bijectively to choosing any subset S of the set M = { (i,j) : R_i = C_j \u2208 {white,black} } and placing at each (i,j)\u2208S a chip of color R_i=C_j.  All other cells are empty.\n\nThis model captures exactly all ways to assign uniform colors (or leave uncolored) to rows and columns consistent with the monochromatic\u2010row/column conditions.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - Maximality forces each row\u2010color R_i and each column\u2010color C_j to be defined (white or black). An undefined row or column would leave an empty cell that could accept a chip of its color, violating maximality. Once all R_i,C_j\u2208{white,black}, the only legal placements are on cells where R_i=C_j. Filling exactly those cells yields no further legal moves, since every empty cell has R_i\u2260C_j and so cannot accept a chip. There are 2^5 choices for the row\u2010color vector and 2^5 for the column\u2010color vector, totaling 2^{10}=1024 maximal assignments. Two of these (all rows white with all columns white, and all rows black with all columns black) produce fully filled grids; the other 1022 assignments produce partial grids.; answer - All maximal configurations arise by choosing a color (white or black) for each of the five rows and each of the five columns (2^{10}=1024 choices) and then placing chips exactly in those cells whose row\u2010color and column\u2010color agree. This yields:\n\n(a) 1022 partial grids: any assignment except the two monochromatic ones produces empty cells. If k rows are white (5\u2212k black) and \u2113 columns are white (5\u2212\u2113 black), the occupied cells form a k\u00d7\u2113 white block and a (5\u2212k)\u00d7(5\u2212\u2113) black block, and all other cells (where R_i\u2260C_j) are empty and cannot receive a chip.\n\n(b) 2 fully filled grids: all rows and columns white (full white grid), and all rows and columns black (full black grid), for which maximality is vacuously satisfied.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - To finalize Subtask 4, we must confirm that no other arrangement can be maximal beyond those identified in Subtask 3.  The key maximality criterion is that no empty cell may accommodate a chip without breaking the \u201cuniform\u2010color per row/column\u201d rule.  If any row or column were left uncoloured, one could add a chip there consistent with that column/row\u2019s colour, contradicting maximality.  Conversely, once each of the 5 rows and 5 columns is assigned a colour, placing chips exactly in the cells where the row\u2010 and column\u2010colours agree indeed blocks every further placement: every empty cell has mismatched colours and so cannot host a chip.  This yields exactly 2^{10} configurations (2 choices per each of 10 lines).  Two of these (all rows and columns white or all black) fill the grid; the remaining 1022 produce the partial \u201cwhite block \u00d7 black block\u201d patterns.  No other structure survives these consistency and maximality checks.; answer - All maximal configurations are obtained by independently choosing each of the 5 rows and each of the 5 columns to be white or black (2^{10}=1024 choices), then placing chips exactly in those cells whose row\u2010color equals their column\u2010color.  Of these 1024, two fill the entire grid (all\u2010white or all\u2010black) and the other 1022 are maximal partial configurations.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5a output: thinking - To be maximal, no further chip can be added without violating the \u2018\u2018uniform\u2010colour in each row and column\u2019\u2019 rule.  If any row or column were left uncoloured, we could add a chip in that line matching all opposite\u2010line colours, contradicting maximality.  Conversely, once each of the 5 rows and each of the 5 columns is independently assigned white or black, placing chips in exactly those cells where the row\u2010colour equals the column\u2010colour satisfies uniformity and leaves every empty cell with mismatched row/column colours, so no more chips can be added.  There are 2^10=1024 ways to colour the 5 rows and 5 columns, yielding 1024 maximal configurations in total, of which two (all rows and all columns white, or all black) produce fully filled grids and the other 1022 produce partial fillings.; answer - All maximal configurations are obtained by independently choosing a colour (white or black) for each of the 5 rows and each of the 5 columns (2^{10}=1024 choices), and then placing chips exactly in those cells whose row\u2010colour equals their column\u2010colour.  This yields 1024 maximal configurations in total: two fully filled grids and 1022 maximal partial grids.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5b output: thinking - From Sub-task 5a, each maximal configuration corresponds uniquely to choosing a color (white or black) for each of the 5 rows and 5 columns, giving 2^{10}=1024 assignments. For each assignment, the only valid placement is to put a chip in each cell where the row color equals the column color; chips are indistinguishable and the maximum of 25 per color is never exceeded, and no additional chip can be added without violating uniformity. Hence there are exactly 1024 maximal configurations.; answer - 1024\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 6 output: thinking - Each maximal configuration from Sub-task 5b yields exactly one valid placement (chips on positions where row color equals column color), and there are 2^{10}=1024 such configurations. Summing over all maximal configurations therefore gives 1024 total valid placements.; answer - 1024\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 7 output: thinking - To validate maximality and completeness, note each of the 2^{5+5}=1024 configurations is obtained by independently assigning a colour (white or black) to each of the 5 rows and 5 columns. In each configuration, we place a chip exactly in those cells where the row and column colours agree. Any empty cell has a differing row\u2010column colour pair; adding a chip there would introduce a row or column containing both colours, violating the uniformity condition. Hence no further chip can be added, proving each configuration is maximal. Conversely, any maximal placement must induce a consistent row and column colouring, so every maximal placement is counted. Thus all 1024 configurations are both valid and exhaustive.; answer - All 1024 candidate configurations have been validated as maximal and complete: no further chip can be added without violating the colour-uniformity conditions."
