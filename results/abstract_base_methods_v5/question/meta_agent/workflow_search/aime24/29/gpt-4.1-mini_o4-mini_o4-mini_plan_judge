Question: There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\times5$ grid such that: 

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_10_29
proposed answer: Sub-task 5 determined there are exactly 2 maximal configurations (all rows white/columns black and vice versa), each admitting exactly one admissible placement (the empty grid). Summing their counts gives 1+1=2.

proposed answer: To validate maximality and completeness, note each of the 2^{5+5}=1024 configurations is obtained by independently assigning a colour (white or black) to each of the 5 rows and 5 columns. In each configuration, we place a chip exactly in those cells where the row and column colours agree. Any empty cell has a differing row‚Äêcolumn colour pair; adding a chip there would introduce a row or column containing both colours, violating the uniformity condition. Hence no further chip can be added, proving each configuration is maximal. Conversely, any maximal placement must induce a consistent row and column colouring, so every maximal placement is counted. Thus all 1024 configurations are both valid and exhaustive.

Answer:All 1024 candidate configurations have been validated as maximal and complete: no further chip can be added without violating the colour-uniformity conditions.
