Question: Eight circles of radius $34$ are sequentially tangent, and two of the circles are tangent to $AB$ and $BC$ of triangle $ABC$, respectively. $2024$ circles of radius $1$ can be arranged in the same manner. The inradius of triangle $ABC$ can be expressed as $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: Sub‐task 5 determined that the given information yields only one equation in sin(B/2) and sin(C/2), so the inradius r cannot be fixed to any single rational value m/n. Without a unique m and n, their sum m+n is not defined. Therefore the answer to Sub‐task 6 is “Undefined.”

proposed answer: From Subtask 7 we found the inradius r = 852/25 in lowest terms, so m = 852 and n = 25. Adding these gives m + n = 852 + 25 = 877. I have verified the fraction is fully reduced (gcd(852,25)=1) and the arithmetic sums correctly, so the final answer is 877.
