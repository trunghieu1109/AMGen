Question: Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.

proposed answer: Let N1,N2,N3,N4 be the numbers of residents owning exactly 1,2,3,4 items respectively. We are given:
• N2=437, N3=234
• Total residents: N1+N2+N3+N4=900 ⇒ N1+437+234+N4=900 ⇒ N1+N4=229
• Total item‐ownership count: |A|+|B|+|C|+|D|=195+367+562+900=2024.  This also equals N1·1+N2·2+N3·3+N4·4 ⇒ N1+874+702+4N4=2024 ⇒ N1+4N4=448
Subtracting the first equation (N1+N4=229) from the second (N1+4N4=448) gives 3N4=219, so N4=73.

proposed answer: In this early critic step we confirm that the counts “exactly two” (437) and “exactly three” (234) unambiguously refer to the full set of four items (ring, clubs, spade, candy hearts). We examined the only plausible alternative—that “exactly k” applied to just the first three items—and found it contradicted the given numbers. No hidden assumptions remain: we have clearly stated the interpretation, checked language norms, and validated consistency with the totals. Thus our interpretation stands with no unwarranted assumptions.

Answer:The interpretation that exactly 2 and exactly 3 counts refer to the full set of four items is valid and requires no additional assumptions.
