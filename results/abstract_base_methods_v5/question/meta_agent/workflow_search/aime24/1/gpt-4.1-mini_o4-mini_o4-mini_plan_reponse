        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - To fix the triangle in the plane we may place B at the origin and C on the x\u2013axis a distance BC=9 away, so let B=(0,0) and C=(9,0).  We then seek A=(x,y) satisfying AB=5 and AC=10:  x\u00b2+y\u00b2=25 and (x\u22129)\u00b2+y\u00b2=100.  Subtracting the first from the second gives (x\u22129)\u00b2\u2212x\u00b2=75 \u21d2\u221218x+81=75 \u21d2x=1/3.  Then y\u00b2=25\u2212(1/3)\u00b2=224/9, so y=\u00b1(4\u221a14)/3.  Choosing the positive sign yields A=(1/3,4\u221a14/3).; answer - One convenient choice is B=(0,0), C=(9,0), and A=(1/3,4\u221a14/3).\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - We know A=(1/3,4\u221a14/3), B=(0,0), C=(9,0). The circumcenter O is the intersection of the perpendicular bisector of BC (the vertical line x=9/2) and the perpendicular bisector of AB. The midpoint of AB is M_AB=(1/6,2\u221a14/3), AB has slope 4\u221a14 so its perpendicular slope is \u20131/(4\u221a14).  The bisector through M_AB is y\u2013(2\u221a14/3)=\u20131/(4\u221a14)(x\u20131/6).  Setting x=9/2 gives y=(2\u221a14)/3\u2013(13)/(12\u221a14)=33/(4\u221a14)=33\u221a14/56.  Hence O=(9/2,33\u221a14/56).  The radius R=|OB|=75/(4\u221a14), so R\u00b2=5625/224.  Thus the circumcircle is (x\u20139/2)\u00b2+(y\u201333\u221a14/56)\u00b2=5625/224.; answer - The circumcircle \u03c9 through A, B, C has equation (x\u20139/2)\u00b2 + (y\u201333\u221a14/56)\u00b2 = 5625/224.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - The circle has center O=(9/2,33\u221a14/56).

By power of a point at D, DA\u00b7DP=DB\u00b2 gives DP=2025/286 and hence AP=DA\u2013DP=100/13, so P divides AD in ratio 88:81.  Applying the section formula between A=(1/3,4\u221a14/3) and D=(9/2,\u221227\u221a14/11) with weights 88:81 yields P=(423/169,\u2212108\u221a14/169).  iShS\u2019s huge fractions are spurious algebraic artifacts from mismanaging common denominators.
