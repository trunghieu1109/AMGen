proposed answer: We seek the smallest prime p for which some n satisfies p^2 | n^4+1. It is known such primes must satisfy p ≡ 1 mod 8, the smallest being p = 17. Next we solve n^4 ≡ –1 mod 17^2 = 289. First mod 17 the equation n^4 ≡ –1 has exactly four simple roots n ≡ ±2, ±8 mod 17. By Hensel’s lemma each lifts uniquely to mod 289. Carrying out the lift via n1 = n0 – f(n0)·[f′(n0)]⁻¹ mod 289 for n0 = 2, 15 (≡ –2), 8, 9 (≡ –8), one finds the four solutions mod 289 are n ≡ 155, 134, 110, 179. Checking 110^4 + 1 ≡ 0 mod 289 shows m = 110 is the least positive integer among them. Hence the least prime is 17 and the least positive m is 110.

Answer:p = 17, m = 110
Extracted answer: p = 17, m = 110
Correct answer: 110

proposed answer: We need to check that m=110 satisfies m^4+1≡0 mod p^2 with p=17 (so p^2=289). Compute:
110 mod 289 = 110.
110^2 = 12100 ≡ 12100−289·41=12100−11849=251 mod 289.
Then 110^4 ≡ 251^2 = 63001 ≡ 63001−289·218=63001−63002=−1 mod 289.
Thus 110^4+1 ≡ (−1)+1=0 mod 289, confirming divisibility by 17^2.

Answer:Yes, 110^4+1 is divisible by 17^2 (289).
Extracted answer: Yes, 110^4+1 is divisible by 17^2 (289).
Correct answer: 110
