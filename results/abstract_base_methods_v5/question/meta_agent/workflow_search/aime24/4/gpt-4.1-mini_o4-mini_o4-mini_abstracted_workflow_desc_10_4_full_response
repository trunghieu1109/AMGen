First reduce mod p: n^4≡−1 (mod p) ⇒ n^8≡1 (mod p) so the order of n divides 8.  Since −1≢1 mod p, the order is exactly 8, so 8|p−1 ⇒ p≡1 (mod 8).  Equivalently, −1 must be a fourth‐power residue mod p, which forces p≡1 mod 8.  Next, Hensel's lemma applies: f(x)=x^4+1 has f′(n)=4n^3 not divisible by p (since p∤n), so any simple root mod p lifts uniquely to mod p^2.  Thus no further constraint on n beyond n^4≡−1 mod p; once p≡1 mod 8 and n solves n^4≡−1 mod p, it automatically lifts to a solution mod p^2.  Hence the necessary and sufficient congruence condition for p is p≡1 (mod 8), and for n is that n^4≡−1 (mod p).; answer - The necessary condition is p≡1 (mod 8), and n must satisfy n^4≡−1 (mod p), which then by Hensel’s lemma lifts to n^4≡−1 (mod p^2).\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - We know from Sub‐task 2 that any prime p for which n^4+1 ≡ 0 (mod p^2) can even have a solution mod p only if p ≡ 1 (mod 8).

In the multiplicative group F_p^× of order p–1, this requires 4\u2009|\u2009(p–1)/2 ⇒ p–1≡0 mod\u20098 ⇒ p≡1 mod\u20098.  Equivalently, (–1)^((p–1)/4)≡1 mod\u2009p.  Hence a solution n0 mod\u2009p to n0^4≡–1 mod\u2009p exists only if p≡1 mod\u20098.  \n\nNext, to lift n0 to mod\u2009p^2 we use Hensel’s lemma on f(x)=x^4+1.  We need f(n0)≡0 mod\u2009p (true by choice) and f′(n0)=4n0^3≠0 mod\u2009p (i.e. p∤n0).  Then there is a unique lift n mod\u2009p^2 with n≡n0 mod\u2009p and n^4+1≡0 mod\u2009p^2.

If n^4≡−1 mod\u2009p then −1 must lie in the subgroup of fourth powers in F_p^×, which is cyclic of order p−1.  In a cyclic group the map x→x^4 has image of size (p−1)/gcd(4,p−1), so −1 lies in that image exactly when p−1 is divisible by 8, i.e. p≡1 mod\u20098.  Moreover n cannot be divisible by p, so f′(n)=4n^3≢0 mod\u2009p and by Hensel’s lemma any solution mod\u2009p lifts uniquely to mod\u2009p^2.
