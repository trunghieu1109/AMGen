Setting x = ω^k, we have 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} = x^2 - 2x + 2. Alternatively, x^2 - 2x + 2 = (x - 1)^2 + 1.

Thus ∏_{k=0}^{12}P(ω^k)=∏_{k}(ω^k−(1+i))·∏_{k}(ω^k−(1−i)). But for any complex a, ∏_{k=0}^{12}(a−ω^k)=a^{13}−1, so ∏_{k}(ω^k−a)=(-1)^{13}(a^{13}−1)=−(a^{13}−1).

However, it stops short of simplifying those complex powers and doesn’t leverage the explicit values (1±i)¹³=64(1±i). Thus it leaves the problem in a complex‐number form rather than reducing to an integer or finding the remainder mod 1000. It also implicitly assumes 1±i≠ωᵏ (true here) without stating it and doesn’t exploit cyclotomic polynomial factorizations to simplify further.; answer: When simplified, (1+i)¹³=64(1+i) and (1−i)¹³=64(1−i), so the product becomes (63+64i)(63−64i)=63²+64²=8065.
