Question: Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?

proposed answer: From Sub-task 6 we have the probability 155/256. Since gcd(155,256)=1, this fraction is already in lowest terms with m=155 and n=256. Therefore m+n = 155+256 = 411.

proposed answer: The fraction from Sub-task 8 is 113/256. Since 113 is prime and 256=2^8, they are relatively prime, so the fraction is already in lowest terms. Thus m=113 and n=256, and m+n=113+256=369.
