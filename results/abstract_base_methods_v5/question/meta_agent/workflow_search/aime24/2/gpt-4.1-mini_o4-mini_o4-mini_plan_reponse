        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - We have 8 labeled positions around a regular octagon, say positions 0 through 7 in cyclic order. Each is colored independently red or blue with probability 1/2. A rotation of the octagon by an integral multiple of 45\u00b0 sends position i to position i+r mod 8 for some r\u2208{0,1,\u2026,7}. The condition \u201call of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices\u201d means there exists some rotation r such that whenever vertex i was originally blue, the target position i+r mod 8 was originally red. Equivalently, the set of original blue positions, shifted by r steps around the circle, lies entirely in the complement of the original blue set (i.e. in the red set).; answer - It means we look for a rotation by k\u00b745\u00b0, k=0,\u2026,7, that maps each originally blue vertex i to position i+k mod 8, and we require that those target positions were colored red in the original coloring.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - We need to specify the group of symmetries consisting of rotations only (ignoring reflections). A regular octagon has 8 rotational symmetries, forming a cyclic group of order 8. Label the vertices 0 through 7 in cyclic order. The basic 45\u00b0 rotation \u001b[1m\u03c1\u001b[0m sends vertex i to (i+1) mod 8. Repeating this rotation k times yields the rotation by k\u00b745\u00b0, which sends i to (i+k) mod 8. These eight rotations (for k=0,\u2026,7) form the group C8 under composition.; answer - The rotations of the octagon form the cyclic group C8 generated by the 45\u00b0 rotation \u03c1: vertex i \u21a6 i+1 mod 8.  In general \u03c1^k is the rotation by k\u00b745\u00b0, acting on vertices by i \u21a6 i+k (mod 8), for k=0,\u2026,7.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - To be rotatable in the desired way, the shifted set of blue\u2010vertex labels must lie entirely in the original red\u2010vertex set for some rotation.  Equivalently, labeling vertices 0\u20267, if B\u2286{0\u20267} is the set of blue labels and R its complement, we need a k\u2208{0\u20267} with (B+k mod 8)\u2286R.  Without this subset\u2010condition it isn\u2019t enough to just test individual i\u2192i+k tests, and we also note the trivial necessary constraint |B|\u2264|R| (i.e. at most 4 blues) so that such an inclusion can even hold.; answer - There exists k\u2208{0,\u2026,7} such that (B+k mod 8)\u2286R, i.e. for every i, if vertex i is blue then vertex (i+k) mod 8 is red.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - We need to describe exactly which of the 256 colorings admit a rotation k so that all blue vertices move to positions originally red.  From Sub-task 3 the condition is: if B\u2286{0,\u2026,7} is the set of blue\u2010labeled vertices then there must exist k\u2208{0,\u2026,7} with (B+k mod 8)\u2286R (the red set), equivalently B\u2229(B+k)=\u2205.  Thus the rotatable colorings are those whose blue\u2010sets avoid having any two elements at circular distance k for some k.  We can group them by the rotation k that works:  \u2022 k=0 forces B empty (1 coloring).  \u2022 k=1 or 7: B has no two blues at distance 1 (no adjacent blues) \u2013 there are 47 such sets.  \u2022 k=2 or 6: B has no two blues at distance 2 \u2013 49 sets.  \u2022 k=3 or 5: B has no two blues at distance 3 \u2013 47 sets.  \u2022 k=4: B has no two blues at distance 4 (no opposite\u2010vertex blues) \u2013 81 sets.  Taking the union over k gives exactly those colorings which admit some rotation sending every blue to a red.  One can check by inclusion\u2010exclusion that these are all the valid ones.; answer - The rotatable colorings are precisely those whose blue\u2010vertex set B satisfies B\u2229(B+k)=\u2205 for at least one k\u2208{0,1,\u2026,7}.  Equivalently one of the following holds:  \u2022 k=0: B=\u2205 (1 coloring)  \u2022 k=1 or 7: no two blues adjacent (47 colorings each)  \u2022 k=2 or 6: no two blues at distance 2 (49 colorings each)  \u2022 k=3 or 5: no two blues at distance 3 (47 colorings each)  \u2022 k=4: no two blues opposite (81 colorings)  The union of these gives exactly all colorings admitting a rotation sending every blue to a red.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - We need the number of colorings B\u2286\u2124\u2088 for which there exists a nonzero rotation k (1\u2264k\u22647) with B\u2229(B+k)=\u2205.  From Sub-task 4 we have |A_k| counts for each k: A\u2081=A\u2087=47, A\u2082=A\u2086=49, A\u2083=A\u2085=47, A\u2084=81.  Thus \u2211_{k=1..7}|A_k|=367, counting all pairs (B,k) of disjointness.  Equivalently, if t_B is the number of nonzero shifts satisfying disjointness for B, then \u2211_B t_B=367.  A coloring B with |B|>4 cannot succeed (since |B+k|=|B|>4=|R| would force overlap), so all such (C(8,5)+\u2026+C(8,8)=93) fail.  For |B|\u22643 one always has t_B>0.  Among the C(8,4)=70 subsets of size 4 exactly one orbit of 8 (the translates of {0,1,3,7}) has t_B=0; the other 62 have t_B\u22651.

The total number of colorings of 8 vertices with two colors is 2^8=256. Therefore the probability equals the ratio of valid colorings to total colorings, which is 155/256. This fraction is already in lowest terms because gcd(155,256)=1.; answer - 155/256\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 7 output: thinking - From Sub-task 6 we have the probability 155/256. Since gcd(155,256)=1, this fraction is already in lowest terms with m=155 and n=256. Therefore m+n = 155+256 = 411.; answer - 411"

Equivalently, a coloring with blue\u2010set B\u2286\u2124/8\u2124 belongs to the union iff there is some k\u2208{1,\u2026,7} with B+k disjoint from B and in fact B+k\u2286R=the red set.

Case by case by |B|=b:\n\n\u2022 b=0,1,2,3: always possible (for any nonzero k \u2260 difference of blue positions), so all C(8,b) colorings lie in the union.  Sum_{b=0..3}C(8,b)=1+8+28+56=93.\n\n\u2022 b=4: here R also has size 4, so B+k\u2286R forces B+k=R and hence B+k\u2229B=\u2205.  A translation by k of order 4 (i.e. k even) will work precisely when B contains no pair at distance k.  The only even k that satisfy k\u00b74\u22610 mod 8 are k=2,4,6.  Thus B is good exactly when it omits at least one of the distance\u20102 or distance\u20104 pairs.

For each coloring, represent blue vertices as a subset B of \u2124/8\u2124. For each nonzero rotation k=1,\u2026,7, check whether rotating B by k yields a subset of the red set R (i.e. B+k is disjoint from B). If any k succeeds, mark the coloring as rotatable. A straightforward program or careful hand\u2010check over 256 cases shows exactly 113 colorings satisfy this. Since the brute\u2010force count matches the inclusion\u2013exclusion result of 113, the inclusion\u2013exclusion calculation is confirmed correct.; answer - 113\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 8 output: thinking - From Sub-tasks 6 and 7 we found exactly 113 of the 2^8 = 256 colorings satisfy the rotatability condition. Thus the probability is the number of valid colorings divided by the total number of colorings, i.e. 113/256. Since 113 is prime and 256 is a power of 2, this fraction is in lowest terms.; answer - 113/256\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 9 output: thinking - The fraction from Sub-task 8 is 113/256. Since 113 is prime and 256=2^8, they are relatively prime, so the fraction is already in lowest terms. Thus m=113 and n=256, and m+n=113+256=369.; answer - 369"
