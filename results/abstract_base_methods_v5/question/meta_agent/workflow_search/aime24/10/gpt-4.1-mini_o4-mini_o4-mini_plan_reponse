We want D,E,C,F in that left-to-right order.  Since EF=184 is itself a side of rectangle EFGH and DC=AB=107 is a side of rectangle ABCD, it is easiest to put E at the origin.  Then F must lie at x=184.  Point C and D lie between E and F with DC=107, so if we call CE=c (unknown positive) then C=(c,0) and D=(c\u2212107,0).
