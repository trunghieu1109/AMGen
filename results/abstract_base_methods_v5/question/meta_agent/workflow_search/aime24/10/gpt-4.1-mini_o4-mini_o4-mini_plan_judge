Question: Rectangles $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are drawn such that $D,E,C,F$ are collinear. Also, $A,D,H,G$ all lie on a circle. If $BC=16$,$AB=107$,$FG=17$, and $EF=184$, what is the length of $CE$?

proposed answer: We must decide between the two proposed solutions CE=85 and CE=291. The second (“291”) arises from taking DE=x with E between D and C and ends up with a negative root, which is extraneous to the geometric configuration (E must lie to the right of C). The first (“85”) comes from correctly setting DE=107+CE so that E is beyond C, applying Ptolemy’s theorem to the cyclic quadrilateral ADHG, and solving yields the unique positive integer CE=85. The alternative root does not satisfy the original cyclic‐quadrilateral conditions. Therefore, CE=85.

proposed answer: We have two candidate solutions for CE (c): approximately 104.97 from Orientation 2 (FG downward) per cmK7, and exactly 125 per rLev. To decide which is valid, we must also enforce the collinearity ordering D–E–C–F along the shared line: with our coordinate choice E=(0,0), C=(c,0), D=(c−107,0), we need D to lie to the left of E, so c−107<0 ⇒ c<107. The value c=125 violates this (125>107), so D would lie to the right of E, contradicting the required D–E–C–F order. Meanwhile c≈104.97<107 satisfies all length‐positivity, Ptolemy’s equality in the downward case, and the correct point ordering. Hence the only geometrically feasible solution is CE≈104.97.
