Question: Find the largest possible real part of \[(75+117i)z+\frac{96+144i}{z}\]where $z$ is a complex number with $|z|=4$.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_1_12
proposed answer: We know from Sub-task 5 that the real part expression can be written as A cosθ + B sinθ with A=324 and B=–432. The maximum of such a linear combination is the Euclidean norm √(A²+B²). Calculating:
A² = 324² = 104976
B² = (–432)² = 186624
Sum = 104976 + 186624 = 291600
Maximum = √291600 = 540
Thus the maximum real part is 540.
