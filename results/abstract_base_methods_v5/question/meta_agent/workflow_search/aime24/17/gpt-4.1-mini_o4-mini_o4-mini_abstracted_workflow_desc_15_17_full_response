Set c=k.  Then a+b=300−k and the second becomes (100−k)ab+100k(300−k)=2,000,000.  For k≠100 this forces ab=(200−k)·100 and the quadratic t²−(300−k)t+100(200−k)=0 has discriminant=(100−k)², yielding a=100 or a=200−k (and b=300−k−a).  Hence for each k≠100 the only solutions are (a,b,c)=(100,200−k,k) or (200−k,100,k).  When k=100 the coefficient (100−k) vanishes and the equation reduces to 100·100·200=2,000,000, so any a,b with a+b=200 and c=100 work; these are exactly (a,b,c)=(100,k,200−k) with k∈[0,200].  Thus every solution has one coordinate equal to 100 and the other two summing to 200.; answer: All integer solutions are exactly the permutations of (100, k, 200−k) for k=0,1,…,200 (i.e. one variable is 100 and the other two add to 200).\n<SEPERATOR>\nCritic agent flTw, feedback: The parameterization correctly shows that one variable must be 100 and the other two sum to 200, but it has a few caveats:  \n1. You must enforce nonnegativity, so k (the 3rd variable) runs only from 0 to 200.  \n2. When k≠100 you get exactly two ordered solutions (100,200−k,k) and (200−k,100,k), but at k=100 the equation degenerates and yields all 201 pairs (a,b) with a+b=200.  \n3. Permutation duplicates should be handled—counting ordered triples gives 400 from k≠100 plus 201 at k=100 for 601 total.  \n4. The derivation assumes integer k and avoids division by zero by treating k=100 separately.; correctness: All nonnegative integer solutions are exactly the permutations of (100, r, 200−r) for integer r from 0 to 200.\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent 4mZ2, refined analysis, thinking: Starting from the two equations a+b+c=300 and 100(ab+bc+ca)−abc=2,000,000, we set c=k.
