Question: Find the number of triples of nonnegative integers \((a,b,c)\) satisfying \(a + b + c = 300\) and
\begin{equation*}
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.
\end{equation*}

proposed answer: From Sub-task 3 every solution is a permutation of (100, k, 200−k). To avoid double‐counting note that k and 200−k give the same multiset, so restrict k=0…100. For k=0…99 we have three distinct values (100,k,200−k), hence 6 permutations each, totaling 100×6=600. For k=100 the triple is (100,100,100), giving just 1 permutation. In all there are 600+1=601 ordered triples.
