        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - We need to translate the description \u201crectangular box with surface area 54 and volume 23\u201d into equations in l, w, h. A rectangular box has surface area S=2(lw+lh+wh) and volume V=lwh. Setting these equal to the given values yields the two equations directly.; answer - The constraints are:\n\n2(lw + lh + wh) = 54\nlwh = 23\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - The smallest sphere that can contain a rectangular box must have its diameter equal to the box\u2019s space diagonal. The space diagonal d of a box with side lengths l, w, h is d=\u221a(l\u00b2+w\u00b2+h\u00b2). Since the sphere\u2019s radius r is half its diameter, we have r=d/2. Squaring both sides gives r\u00b2=(d\u00b2)/4. Substituting d\u00b2=l\u00b2+w\u00b2+h\u00b2 yields r\u00b2=(l\u00b2+w\u00b2+h\u00b2)/4.; answer - r\u00b2 = (l\u00b2 + w\u00b2 + h\u00b2)/4\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - We have 2(lw+lh+wh)=54 \u21d2 lw+lh+wh=27, and lwh=23. Note that (l+w+h)\u00b2=l\u00b2+w\u00b2+h\u00b2+2(lw+lh+wh) \u21d2 l\u00b2+w\u00b2+h\u00b2=(l+w+h)\u00b2\u221254. To maximize l\u00b2+w\u00b2+h\u00b2 we maximize S=l+w+h under fixed lw+lh+wh and lwh. By symmetry the extremum occurs when two variables are equal, say l=w=x and h=y. Then x\u00b2+2xy=27 and x\u00b2y=23. Solving gives x=2, y=23/4, so S=2x+y=4+5.75=9.75. Hence max\u2009(l\u00b2+w\u00b2+h\u00b2)=(9.75)\u00b2\u221254=95.0625\u221254=41.0625=657/16.; answer - l\u00b2+w\u00b2+h\u00b2=(l+w+h)\u00b2\u221254, and its maximum value is 657/16\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - We want to maximize L = l^2 + w^2 + h^2 given lw + lh + wh = 27 and lwh = 23. From Sub\u2010task 3 we have the identity l^2 + w^2 + h^2 = (l + w + h)^2 \u2013 2(lw + lh + wh) = S^2 \u2013 54, where S = l + w + h. Thus maximizing l^2 + w^2 + h^2 is equivalent to maximizing S under the given constraints. By symmetry, at an extremum two of the variables are equal, say l = w = x and h = y. The constraints become x^2 + 2xy = 27 and x^2 y = 23. Solving yields x = 2 and y = 23/4, giving S = 2x + y = 4 + 5.75 = 9.75. Therefore the maximum value is S^2 \u2013 54 = (9.75)^2 \u2013 54 = 95.0625 \u2013 54 = 41.0625 = 657/16.; answer - 657/16\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - From subtask 4 we have max(l\u00b2+w\u00b2+h\u00b2)=657/16. Subtask 2 gives r\u00b2=(l\u00b2+w\u00b2+h\u00b2)/4. Hence r\u00b2=(657/16)/4=657/64, which is in lowest terms.; answer - 657/64\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 6 output: thinking - From subtask 5 we have r\u00b2 = 657/64 in lowest terms. Thus p = 657 and q = 64. Their sum is 657 + 64 = 721.; answer - 721"
