From Sub-task 3 any point C on AB is C(t)=((1−t)/2, (√3 t)/2), 0<t<1.  We want C(t) to lie on AB but on no other segment in F, i.e. the only way to write C(t)=R(s,u) is with the parameters that describe AB itself, namely u=½ and s=t.  Equivalently, the system\n  (1−s)·u = (1−t)/2,\n  s·√(1−u²) = (√3 t)/2,\nwith 0≤s,u≤1 must admit (s,u)=(t,½) as its unique solution.  In particular, there must be no solution with u≠½.  This is exactly the condition that C(t) lies on AB but on no other segment of F.; answer - The condition is that for the C on AB given by C(t)=((1−t)/2, (√3 t)/2) the only solution (s,u)∈[0,1]² of the system\n  (1−s)·u = (1−t)/2,\n  s·√(1−u²) = (√3 t)/2\nis (s,u)=(t,½).

For C to lie on another unit segment PQ in F besides AB, there must be parameters (s,u) satisfying (1−s)u=(1−t)/2 and s√(1−u²)=(√3 t)/2 with u≠½. Eliminating s gives f(u)=(2u−1+t)²(1−u²)−3u²t²=0. We know u=½ is always a root (the AB case). To exclude any other root u∈(0,1), u=½ must be a double root, so f′(½)=0. Computing f′(u) yields f′(½)=3t−4t². Setting this zero (and t≠0) gives t=3/4.

Thus the equation relating P=(x,0) and Q=(0,y) is x²+y²=1, giving y=√(1−x²).  A general point R on segment PQ can be written as a convex combination R=λP+μQ with λ+μ=1, λ,μ≥0.  Writing μ=s and λ=1−s (0≤s≤1) yields R(s,t)=((1−s)t, s√(1−t²)).  Letting s and t vary over [0,1] sweeps out the entire family of segments.; answer: The unit‐length constraint is x²+y²=1 for P=(x,0) and Q=(0,y), so y=√(1−x²).

The unit‐length constraint is then √[ (t−0)² + (0−√(1−t²))² ] = 1, which simplifies to t² + (√(1−t²))² = t²+(1−t²)=1, as required.  To describe every point on such a segment we introduce a second parameter λ∈[0,1] and write any point R on PQ as the convex combination R=(1−λ)P + λQ = (t(1−λ), λ√(1−t²)).  Varying t over [0,1] and λ over [0,1] thus gives the full locus of points on all segments in ℱ.; answer: The endpoints satisfy P=(t,0), Q=(0,√(1−t²)) with the unit‐length condition t² + (√(1−t²))² = 1.  Every point R on the segment PQ is R = (1−λ)P + λQ = (t(1−λ), λ√(1−t²)) for λ∈[0,1].
