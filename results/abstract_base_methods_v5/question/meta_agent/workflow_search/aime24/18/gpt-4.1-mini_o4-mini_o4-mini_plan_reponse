        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - We need a single-parameter description of all unit\u2010length segments with one endpoint P on the x-axis and the other Q on the y-axis in the first quadrant.  Write P=(x,0) and Q=(0,y).  The length condition |PQ|=1 gives \u221a(x\u00b2+y\u00b2)=1 \u21d2 y=\u221a(1\u2212x\u00b2).  Thus letting t vary over [0,1] (first\u2010quadrant x-coordinates) parametrizes the family.  Equivalently, one can use the angle \u03b1 with P=(cos\u03b1,0), Q=(0,sin\u03b1).; answer - One convenient parametrization is: for t\u2208[0,1],\nP=(t,0),\nQ=(0,\u221a(1\u2212t\u00b2)).\nThen |PQ|=\u221a(t\u00b2+(\u221a(1\u2212t\u00b2))\u00b2)=1, and P lies on the x-axis, Q lies on the y-axis in the first quadrant.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - From Sub-task 1 we set P=(t,0) and Q=(0,\u221a(1\u2212t\u00b2)) for 0\u2264t\u22641 so that |PQ|=\u221a(t\u00b2+(\u221a(1\u2212t\u00b2))\u00b2)=1.  Thus the equation relating P=(x,0) and Q=(0,y) is x\u00b2+y\u00b2=1, giving y=\u221a(1\u2212x\u00b2).  A general point R on segment PQ can be written as a convex combination R=\u03bbP+\u03bcQ with \u03bb+\u03bc=1, \u03bb,\u03bc\u22650.  Writing \u03bc=s and \u03bb=1\u2212s (0\u2264s\u22641) yields R(s,t)=((1\u2212s)t, s\u221a(1\u2212t\u00b2)).  Letting s and t vary over [0,1] sweeps out the entire family of segments.; answer - The unit\u2010length constraint is x\u00b2+y\u00b2=1 for P=(x,0) and Q=(0,y), so y=\u221a(1\u2212x\u00b2).  Moreover every point on the segment PQ is R(s,t)=((1\u2212s)t, s\u221a(1\u2212t\u00b2)), with parameters t\u2208[0,1], s\u2208[0,1], which describes the locus of all points on the family of segments.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - To parametrize the segment AB, we use a parameter t\u2208(0,1) so that t=0 gives A and t=1 gives B. A has coordinates (1/2,0), B has (0,\u221a3/2). By linear interpolation, any point C on AB is C=(1\u2212t)A + tB = ((1\u2212t)/2, (t\u00b7\u221a3)/2). This excludes A and B when t is strictly between 0 and 1.; answer - Let t\u2208(0,1). Then C=((1\u2212t)/2, (\u221a3\u00b7t)/2).\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - From Sub-task 2 we have that any point on a length-1 segment P Q with P=(u,0), Q=(0,\u221a(1\u2212u\u00b2)) can be written R(s,u)=((1\u2212s)u, s\u221a(1\u2212u\u00b2)), with 0\u2264s\u22641, 0\u2264u\u22641. From Sub-task 3 any point C on AB is C(t)=((1\u2212t)/2, (\u221a3 t)/2), 0<t<1.  We want C(t) to lie on AB but on no other segment in F, i.e. the only way to write C(t)=R(s,u) is with the parameters that describe AB itself, namely u=\u00bd and s=t.  Equivalently, the system\n  (1\u2212s)\u00b7u = (1\u2212t)/2,\n  s\u00b7\u221a(1\u2212u\u00b2) = (\u221a3 t)/2,\nwith 0\u2264s,u\u22641 must admit (s,u)=(t,\u00bd) as its unique solution.  In particular, there must be no solution with u\u2260\u00bd.  This is exactly the condition that C(t) lies on AB but on no other segment of F.; answer - The condition is that for the C on AB given by C(t)=((1\u2212t)/2, (\u221a3 t)/2) the only solution (s,u)\u2208[0,1]\u00b2 of the system\n  (1\u2212s)\u00b7u = (1\u2212t)/2,\n  s\u00b7\u221a(1\u2212u\u00b2) = (\u221a3 t)/2\nis (s,u)=(t,\u00bd).  Equivalently, there is no solution with u\u2260\u00bd, so C(t) lies on AB and on no other segment of the family F.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - We parameterize C on AB by t with C(t)=((1\u2212t)/2,(\u221a3 t)/2). For C to lie on another unit segment PQ in F besides AB, there must be parameters (s,u) satisfying (1\u2212s)u=(1\u2212t)/2 and s\u221a(1\u2212u\u00b2)=(\u221a3 t)/2 with u\u2260\u00bd. Eliminating s gives f(u)=(2u\u22121+t)\u00b2(1\u2212u\u00b2)\u22123u\u00b2t\u00b2=0. We know u=\u00bd is always a root (the AB case). To exclude any other root u\u2208(0,1), u=\u00bd must be a double root, so f\u2032(\u00bd)=0. Computing f\u2032(u) yields f\u2032(\u00bd)=3t\u22124t\u00b2. Setting this zero (and t\u22600) gives t=3/4. Thus the unique such point is C(3/4)=((1\u22123/4)/2,(\u221a3\u00b73/4)/2)=(1/8,3\u221a3/8).; answer - The unique point C is (1/8, 3\u221a3/8).\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 6 output: thinking - The point C from Sub-task 5 is (1/8,3\u221a3/8). Then OC^2 = (1/8)^2 + (3\u221a3/8)^2 = 1/64 + 9\u00b73/64 = 1/64 + 27/64 = 28/64 = 7/16. Thus in lowest terms OC^2 = 7/16.; answer - 7/16\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 7 output: thinking - From the prior sub\u2010task we determined that OC\u00b2 = 7/16 in lowest terms, so p = 7 and q = 16. Therefore the sum p + q = 7 + 16 = 23.; answer - 23"
