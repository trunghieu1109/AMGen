Question: A list of positive integers has the following properties:
$\bullet$ The sum of the items in the list is $30$.
$\bullet$ The unique mode of the list is $9$.
$\bullet$ The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.
Find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_10_22
proposed answer: Sub-task 5 concluded that there is no valid list satisfying all three conditions (sum 30, unique mode 9, integer median not in the list). Since no list exists, there are no items to square and sum, so the sum of the squares is undefined.

Answer:No valid list exists, so no sum of squares can be computed.
Extracted answer: No valid list exists, so no sum of squares can be computed.
Correct answer: 236

proposed answer: We have determined that the only valid list is [5, 7, 9, 9]. To find the sum of the squares of its entries, we compute 5^2 + 7^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 = 25 + 49 + 81 + 81 = 236.
