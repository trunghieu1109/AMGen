Question: Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations:
\[\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}\]\[\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}\]\[\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}\]
Then the value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: We found earlier that log₂(x) = −7/24, log₂(y) = −3/8, and log₂(z) = −5/12. Hence
log₂(x⁴y³z²) = 4·(−7/24) + 3·(−3/8) + 2·(−5/12)
= −28/24 − 9/8 − 10/12 = −28/24 − 27/24 − 20/24 = −75/24 = −25/8.
Taking the absolute value gives |−25/8| = 25/8, so m = 25 and n = 8. Therefore m + n = 25 + 8 = 33.

proposed answer: From the previous sub-task we determined that |log₂(x⁴y³z²)| = 25/8, giving m=25 and n=8. Therefore the sum m + n is 25 + 8 = 33.
