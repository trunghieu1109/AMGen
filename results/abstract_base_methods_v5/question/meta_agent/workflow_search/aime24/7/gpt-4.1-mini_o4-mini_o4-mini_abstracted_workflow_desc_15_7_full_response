However, it stops short of addressing several important limitations:\n1. No explicit solution for x is provided. The equation (x+10) ln x = x ln 25 is transcendental and requires numerical methods (or Lambert W) for x>1; there is no elementary closed‐form.  \n2. Uniqueness and existence of the root x>1 are assumed but not proved; one must verify the monotonicity of f(x)=(x+10) ln x−x ln 25 on (1,∞) and confirm a single positive solution.  \n3. Domain constraints (x>1, y>1) and the positivity of logs are not rechecked after deriving xy=25.  \n4. Potential extraneous solutions from multiplying or dividing by ln x or ln y are not examined.\n\nIn summary, the derivation is algebraically sound up to the implicit step, but it does not complete the solution or ensure its validity in the required domain.; answer: The reduction to (x+10)·ln x = x·ln 25 with xy=25 is correct, but solving for x>1 (and hence y) requires further numerical or Lambert W analysis, along with domain and uniqueness verification.\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent ynQi, refining algebraic solution, thinking: Starting from the two equations from Sub‐task 2:\n  (1)  ln(y)/ln(x) = 10/x\n  (2)  ln(x)/ln(y) = 10/(4y)\n\nMultiply (1)·(2):\n  [ln(y)/ln(x)]·[ln(x)/ln(y)] = (10/x)·(10/(4y))  ⇒ 1 = 100/(4xy)  ⇒ xy = 25.\n\nThus y = 25/x.
