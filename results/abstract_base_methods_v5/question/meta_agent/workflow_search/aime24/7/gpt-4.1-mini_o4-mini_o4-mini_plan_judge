Question: There exist real numbers $x$ and $y$, both greater than 1, such that $\log_x\left(y^x\right)=\log_y\left(x^{4y}\right)=10$. Find $xy$.

proposed answer: From the equations log_x(y^x)=10 and log_y(x^{4y})=10, we derive y^x=x^{10} and x^{4y}=y^{10}. Taking logarithms and manipulating yields the relation xy=25. Numerical approximations (x≈1.533, y≈16.303) also give x·y≈25, confirming the exact product is 25.
