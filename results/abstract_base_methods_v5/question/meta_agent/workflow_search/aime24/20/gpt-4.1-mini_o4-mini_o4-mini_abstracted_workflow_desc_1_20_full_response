Setting s=d1+d0 and t=b−1=210=2·3·5·7, the congruence s(s−1)≡0 mod 210 is equivalent to s≡0 or 1 mod each of 2, 3, 5, 7, giving 2^4=16 residue classes modulo 210. We look for s in the interval [⌈√211⌉,210]=[15,210]. Among the 16 classes, the class s≡1 mod 210 has its only representative ≤210 equal to s=1, which lies below 15, and its next representative is 211>210, so it contributes 0 valid s. Each of the remaining 15 classes contributes exactly one s in [15,210]. Therefore there are exactly 15 valid s, hence 15 b-beautiful numbers.

We note three requirements: (1) n must be a perfect square, say n=k²; (2) when written in base b, n has exactly two digits, so b≤n<b², and the leading digit is nonzero; (3) the sum of those two base-b digits equals k. By restating each part, we capture the exact constraints.; answer - A positive integer n is called b-eautiful if the following three conditions hold: 1. n is a perfect square, n=k² for some integer k≥1. 2. When n is written in base b, it has exactly two digits, say n = a·b + c, with 1≤a≤b−1 and 0≤c≤b−1. 3. The sum of those two base-b digits equals the square root: a + c = k.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - To express a two‐digit base-b number we set n=d1⋅b+d0 with 1≤d1<b, 0≤d0<b.  The b-eautiful requirement is that n=k² for some k and that the sum of its digits equals that k.  Thus k=d1+d0 and k²=n.  Substituting gives (d1+d0)²=d1⋅b+d0, which both enforces that n is a perfect square and encodes the digit‐sum condition.; answer - For a two‐digit base-b number write n = d1⋅b + d0 with 1 ≤ d1 < b and 0 ≤ d0 < b.  The b-eautiful condition is d1 + d0 = √n, which is equivalent to (d1 + d0)² = d1⋅b + d0, ensuring n is a perfect square and its digit‐sum equals its square root.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - To characterize all b-eautiful numbers we must encode (1) that n is a perfect square whose root equals the digit sum, (2) that n really has exactly two base-b digits so its leading digit is nonzero, and (3) that the digits we use match the base-b expansion. Writing n = d1·b + d0 with 1 ≤ d1 < b and 0 ≤ d0 < b already forces a two-digit form, but we must further insist that b ≤ n ≤ b² – 1 so no three-digit or one-digit solutions slip in. The b-eautiful condition √n = d1 + d0 becomes n = (d1 + d0)². Equating the two expressions for n and including the digit bounds yields the complete Diophantine system we need to solve. ; answer - For fixed base b ≥ 2, the b-eautiful numbers are exactly those n obtained from integer pairs (d1,d0) satisfying: 1 ≤ d1 < b, 0 ≤ d0 < b, n = d1·b + d0, n = (d1 + d0)², and b ≤ n ≤ b² – 1.

Scanning over all digit pairs (d1,d0) costs O(b^2) checks, while scanning over possible digit sums s=1…2(b–1) costs only O(b) checks plus constant-time digit extraction. Since b can grow arbitrarily large, the digit-sum approach is more efficient and just as simple to implement. It directly generates each candidate n=s^2, tests the two-digit condition b ≤ n < b^2, recovers d1=⌊n/b⌋ and d0=n mod b, and verifies d1+d0=s. This method is guaranteed to find every b-eautiful number with exactly two base-b digits and minimal work.; answer - Use the digit-sum enumeration method:\n1. For s from 1 to 2(b–1):\n2.

There are b−1 choices for the leading digit (1≤d1<b) and b choices for the trailing digit (0≤d0<b), so the double loop does O(b^2) work, which is fine for any fixed b. For each pair we compute n=d1·b+d0 and check whether (d1+d0)^2=n.

A two‐digit base‐b number with digits d1,d0 satisfies d1*b+d0=(d1+d0)^2. Equivalently, letting s=d1+d0 and t=b−1, one finds s(s−1) divisible by t, so s≡0 or 1 mod each prime power dividing t. Thus the count of such s between ⌈√b⌉ and b−1 equals the number of residue‐classes modulo t satisfying s≡0 or1 for each prime dividing t. There are 2^ω(t) such classes, for ω(t) the number of distinct prime factors of t. Over the interval of length ≈t this gives about 2^ω(t) solutions. To exceed 10, we need 2^ω(t)≥16, so ω(t)≥4. The smallest t with four distinct primes is 2·3·5·7=210, giving b=211. For b<211, t=b−1<210 has at most three primes, so at most 8 solutions. At b=211, t=210, so there are exactly 16 classes modulo 210, one of which is s=1 below the interval, leaving 15 solutions s between 15 and 210, i.e. more than 10.

As b grows, we track the count and once it crosses 10 we record that b. We reflexively check that for b−1 the count≤10, and for b it exceeds 10. This validates minimality. The procedure terminates because counts grow unboundedly with b. Thus the smallest base b with more than ten b-eautiful numbers is found by this simple loop.; answer: function find_smallest_beautiful_base():\n    b ← 2\n    loop:\n        c ← count_b_beautiful(b)       # from Subtask 5a\n        if c > 10 then                 # check if we have more than ten\n            return b                   # found the minimal base\n        b ← b + 1                      # try the next base\n\n# Usage:\n# let result = find_smallest_beautiful_base()\n# print(result)  # prints the least b≥2 with more than ten b-eautiful integers\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent of7I, iterating bases and finding smallest base with >10 b-eautiful numbers, thinking: We want the smallest base b≥2 for which the number of two‐digit b‐beautiful numbers exceeds 10.  Recall a two‐digit base‐b number has digits d1∈[1,b−1], d0∈[0,b−1], value n=d1⋅b+d0, and we require (d1+d0)^2=n.  Equivalently,\n    (d1+d0)^2−(d1⋅b+d0)=0\n  ⇒ s^2−s = d1(b−1), with s=d1+d0.  Hence b−1 must divide s(s−1), and d1=(s^2−s)/(b−1) must lie in [1,b−1], and d0=s−d1 in [0,b−1].\n\nBy a standard CRT argument, for each prime power p^e∥(b−1), s(s−1)≡0 mod p^e iff s≡0 or1 mod p^e.  If b−1 has k distinct prime factors, there are 2^k residue‐classes mod (b−1) satisfying the divisibility.  In the range 1≤s≤2(b−1), exactly one s from each class gives a valid two‐digit solution (the one with s< b).  The two “trivial” residue‐classes s≡1 mod(b−1) and the “duplicate” large‐s solutions fail to produce valid digits, so the total count of b‐beautiful numbers is 2^k minus 1.\n\nWe need 2^k−1>10 ⇒2^k>11 ⇒k≥4.  The smallest integer >1 with 4 distinct prime factors is 2·3·5·7=210, so b−1=210 ⇒b=211.  Checking b=211 gives exactly 2^4−1=15 two‐digit solutions, which exceeds 10, and no smaller b can have 4 distinct primes in b−1.  Thus the least base is b=211.; answer: The least integer base b is 211.\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent 40B2, performing final integrity check, thinking: To confirm b=211 indeed yields more than ten beautiful numbers, note that a two-digit number n in base b satisfies n=d1·b+d0=s^2 with s=d1+d0 and √b≤s≤b−1. For b=211, t=b−1=210=2·3·5·7. The condition s(s−1)≡0 mod 210 is equivalent to s≡0 or 1 mod each of 2,3,5,7, giving 2^4=16 residue classes mod 210. We seek s in the interval [ceil(√211),210]=[15,210]. Exactly one class (s≡1 mod 210) has its only representative in [0,210] equal to s=1, which lies below 15 and its next representative 211 exceeds 210, so that class contributes no valid s. Each of the remaining 15 classes contributes exactly one s in [15,210]. Thus there are 15 valid s, hence 15 b-beautiful numbers for b=211, which exceeds 10. This confirms correctness and completeness of the result.; answer: b = 211\n<SEPERATOR>\nCritic agent ngBT, feedback round 0, thinking: The integrity check is correct.  Solving s(s−1)≡0 mod 210 gives 16 residue classes mod 210.  Of these only r=0 and r=1 lie below 15, so the 14 other classes each contribute one s∈[15,209], and the r=0 class also contributes s=210.  That yields 15 valid s (and hence 15 b-eautiful numbers), which indeed exceeds 10.; answer: yes\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent 40B2, refining final integrity check, thinking: To confirm that b=211 yields more than ten b-eautiful numbers, we note that for a two-digit base-b number n=d1·b+d0 to be beautiful we need n=(d1+d0)^2 and √b≤d1+d0≤b−1. Setting s=d1+d0 and t=b−1=210=2·3·5·7, the congruence s(s−1)≡0 mod 210 is equivalent to s≡0 or 1 mod each of 2, 3, 5, 7, giving 2^4=16 residue classes modulo 210. We look for s in the interval [⌈√211⌉,210]=[15,210]. Among the 16 classes, the class s≡1 mod 210 has its only representative ≤210 equal to s=1, which lies below 15, and its next representative is 211>210, so it contributes 0 valid s. Each of the remaining 15 classes contributes exactly one s in [15,210]. Therefore there are exactly 15 valid s, hence 15 b-beautiful numbers. Since 15>10, this confirms the integrity of the result.; answer: The integrity check confirms that in base 211 there are 15 b-eautiful numbers, which indeed exceeds 10, so b=211 is correct.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT agent 1Nmr, returning final integer base b answer, thinking: To find b-eautiful numbers, we set n=d1·b+d0=s^2 where s=d1+d0.  Then d1·(b−1)=s(s−1), so b−1 must divide s(s−1).  Valid s must also satisfy √b≤s≤b−1 and yield 1≤d1≤b−1.  Hence the number of b-eautiful n equals the count of s in [⌈√b⌉,b−1] with s(s−1)≡0 mod(b−1).  We seek the smallest b≥2 with more than 10 such s.  Testing shows that for b=211, b−1=210=2·3·5·7, so s≡0 or 1 mod each prime divisor gives 16 residue classes mod210.  Only s=1 is too small, leaving 15 valid s in [15,210], hence 15 b-beautiful numbers.  No smaller b yields over 10 solutions, so b=211 is the least.; answer: 211', iteration_idx=-1)]
