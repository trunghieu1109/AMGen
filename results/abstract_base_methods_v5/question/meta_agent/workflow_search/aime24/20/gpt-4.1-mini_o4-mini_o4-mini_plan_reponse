        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - First, I restate the problem in my own words: \u201cb-eautiful\u201d refers to a number n whose base-b representation has exactly two digits and those two digits add up to \u221an. In base b any two-digit number can be written n = a\u00b7b + c where 1 \u2264 a \u2264 b\u20131 and 0 \u2264 c \u2264 b\u20131. The condition \u201cthese two digits sum to \u221an\u201d forces \u221an = a + c, so n must be a perfect square and its square\u2010root must equal the sum of its base-b digits. Thus the definition is n = (a + c)\u00b2 and simultaneously n = a\u00b7b + c with a,c in the digit ranges. This captures precisely the two requirements: \u2022 n has two digits in base b, \u2022 the two digits sum to \u221an.; answer - A positive integer n is b-eautiful if when written in base b it has exactly two digits, say n = a\u00b7b + c with 1 \u2264 a \u2264 b\u20131 and 0 \u2264 c \u2264 b\u20131, and those digits satisfy a + c = \u221an (so n is a perfect square whose square root equals the sum of its base-b digits).\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - We know from Sub-task 1 that any two-digit base-b number can be written n = a\u00b7b + c with 1 \u2264 a \u2264 b\u20131 and 0 \u2264 c \u2264 b\u20131. The b-eautiful condition requires \u221an = a + c, forcing n to be a perfect square. Substituting n = (a + c)\u00b2 into the positional form gives a\u00b7b + c = (a + c)\u00b2. This is the needed relation connecting the base b, the digits a, c, and the integer n under the b-eautiful definition.; answer - For digits a,c with 1 \u2264 a \u2264 b\u20131 and 0 \u2264 c \u2264 b\u20131, a two-digit base-b number is n = a\u00b7b + c.

From Sub\u2010task 2 we have the key equation n = d1\u00b7b + d0 = (d1 + d0)^2, which forces \u221an = d1 + d0. Finally, insisting that n truly lies between b and b^2\u22121 (so that it is exactly two digits in base b) gives b \u2264 (d1 + d0)^2 \u2264 b^2\u22121.

The brute\u2010force double loop over d\u2081\u2208[1,b\u22121], d\u2080\u2208[0,b\u22121] works but is O(b\u00b2).  Introducing S=d\u2081+d\u2080 collapses the search to O(b) steps: since n=S\u00b2 must lie between b and b\u00b2\u22121, S runs from \u2308\u221ab\u2309 to b\u22121.

This one\u2010parameter method enumerates exactly all two\u2010digit b\u2010beautiful numbers, is easy to implement, and avoids redundant checks.; answer - Use the one\u2010parameter (S) method:  For S from ceil(\u221ab) to b\u22121 compute d\u2081 = S(S\u22121)/(b\u22121).

By restating each part, we capture the exact constraints.; answer - A positive integer n is called b-eautiful if the following three conditions hold: 1. n is a perfect square, n=k\u00b2 for some integer k\u22651. 2. When n is written in base b, it has exactly two digits, say n = a\u00b7b + c, with 1\u2264a\u2264b\u22121 and 0\u2264c\u2264b\u22121. 3.

The b-eautiful requirement is that n=k\u00b2 for some k and that the sum of its digits equals that k.  Thus k=d1+d0 and k\u00b2=n.  Substituting gives (d1+d0)\u00b2=d1\u22c5b+d0, which both enforces that n is a perfect square and encodes the digit\u2010sum condition.; answer - For a two\u2010digit base-b number write n = d1\u22c5b + d0 with 1 \u2264 d1 < b and 0 \u2264 d0 < b.  The b-eautiful condition is d1 + d0 = \u221an, which is equivalent to (d1 + d0)\u00b2 = d1\u22c5b + d0, ensuring n is a perfect square and its digit\u2010sum equals its square root.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - To characterize all b-eautiful numbers we must encode (1) that n is a perfect square whose root equals the digit sum, (2) that n really has exactly two base-b digits so its leading digit is nonzero, and (3) that the digits we use match the base-b expansion. Writing n = d1\u00b7b + d0 with 1 \u2264 d1 < b and 0 \u2264 d0 < b already forces a two-digit form, but we must further insist that b \u2264 n \u2264 b\u00b2 \u2013 1 so no three-digit or one-digit solutions slip in. The b-eautiful condition \u221an = d1 + d0 becomes n = (d1 + d0)\u00b2. Equating the two expressions for n and including the digit bounds yields the complete Diophantine system we need to solve. ; answer - For fixed base b \u2265 2, the b-eautiful numbers are exactly those n obtained from integer pairs (d1,d0) satisfying: 1 \u2264 d1 < b, 0 \u2264 d0 < b, n = d1\u00b7b + d0, n = (d1 + d0)\u00b2, and b \u2264 n \u2264 b\u00b2 \u2013 1.

Scanning over all digit pairs (d1,d0) costs O(b^2) checks, while scanning over possible digit sums s=1\u20262(b\u20131) costs only O(b) checks plus constant-time digit extraction. Since b can grow arbitrarily large, the digit-sum approach is more efficient and just as simple to implement. It directly generates each candidate n=s^2, tests the two-digit condition b \u2264 n < b^2, recovers d1=\u230an/b\u230b and d0=n mod b, and verifies d1+d0=s.

A two\u2010digit base\u2010b number with digits d1,d0 satisfies d1*b+d0=(d1+d0)^2. Equivalently, letting s=d1+d0 and t=b\u22121, one finds s(s\u22121) divisible by t, so s\u22610 or 1 mod each prime power dividing t. Thus the count of such s between \u2308\u221ab\u2309 and b\u22121 equals the number of residue\u2010classes modulo t satisfying s\u22610 or1 for each prime dividing t.

To exceed 10, we need 2^\u03c9(t)\u226516, so \u03c9(t)\u22654. The smallest t with four distinct primes is 2\u00b73\u00b75\u00b77=210, giving b=211. For b<211, t=b\u22121<210 has at most three primes, so at most 8 solutions. At b=211, t=210, so there are exactly 16 classes modulo 210, one of which is s=1 below the interval, leaving 15 solutions s between 15 and 210, i.e. more than 10. Hence the least such base is 211.; answer - 211\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 6 output: thinking - To confirm that b=211 yields more than ten b-eautiful numbers, we note that for a two-digit base-b number n=d1\u00b7b+d0 to be beautiful we need n=(d1+d0)^2 and \u221ab\u2264d1+d0\u2264b\u22121. Setting s=d1+d0 and t=b\u22121=210=2\u00b73\u00b75\u00b77, the congruence s(s\u22121)\u22610 mod 210 is equivalent to s\u22610 or 1 mod each of 2, 3, 5, 7, giving 2^4=16 residue classes modulo 210. We look for s in the interval [\u2308\u221a211\u2309,210]=[15,210]. Among the 16 classes, the class s\u22611 mod 210 has its only representative \u2264210 equal to s=1, which lies below 15, and its next representative is 211>210, so it contributes 0 valid s. Each of the remaining 15 classes contributes exactly one s in [15,210]. Therefore there are exactly 15 valid s, hence 15 b-beautiful numbers. Since 15>10, this confirms the integrity of the result.; answer - The integrity check confirms that in base 211 there are 15 b-eautiful numbers, which indeed exceeds 10, so b=211 is correct.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 7 output: thinking - To find b-eautiful numbers, we set n=d1\u00b7b+d0=s^2 where s=d1+d0.  Then d1\u00b7(b\u22121)=s(s\u22121), so b\u22121 must divide s(s\u22121).  Valid s must also satisfy \u221ab\u2264s\u2264b\u22121 and yield 1\u2264d1\u2264b\u22121.

Testing shows that for b=211, b\u22121=210=2\u00b73\u00b75\u00b77, so s\u22610 or 1 mod each prime divisor gives 16 residue classes mod210.  Only s=1 is too small, leaving 15 valid s in [15,210], hence 15 b-beautiful numbers.  No smaller b yields over 10 solutions, so b=211 is the least.; answer - 211"
