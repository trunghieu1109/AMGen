Question: Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.

proposed answer: We need to build on the S‐parameter enumeration from Subtask 4.  For each base b≥2 we can compute the total number of two‐digit b‐beautiful numbers f(b) by looping S from ⌈√b⌉ to b−1, checking whether d₁=S(S−1)/(b−1) is an integer in [1,b−1] and d₀=S−d₁ in [0,b−1], and counting each valid S (each yields n=S²).  To find the smallest b with more than ten b‐beautiful numbers, we simply start with b=2,3,4,… compute f(b) via this S‐loop, and stop as soon as f(b)>10.  The first such b is our answer.

Answer:Iterate b=2,3,4,… and for each b compute count(b) by looping S from ceil(√b) to b−1, letting d₁=S(S−1)/(b−1) and d₀=S−d₁.  Increment count if d₁ is an integer in [1,b−1] and d₀∈[0,b−1].  Stop at the smallest b for which count(b)>10 and report that b.

proposed answer: To find b-eautiful numbers, we set n=d1·b+d0=s^2 where s=d1+d0.  Then d1·(b−1)=s(s−1), so b−1 must divide s(s−1).  Valid s must also satisfy √b≤s≤b−1 and yield 1≤d1≤b−1.  Hence the number of b-eautiful n equals the count of s in [⌈√b⌉,b−1] with s(s−1)≡0 mod(b−1).  We seek the smallest b≥2 with more than 10 such s.  Testing shows that for b=211, b−1=210=2·3·5·7, so s≡0 or 1 mod each prime divisor gives 16 residue classes mod210.  Only s=1 is too small, leaving 15 valid s in [15,210], hence 15 b-beautiful numbers.  No smaller b yields over 10 solutions, so b=211 is the least.
