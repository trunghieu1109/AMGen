Question: Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime.

Since each face is given by Aᵢx + Bᵢy + Cᵢz + Dᵢ = 0, the perpendicular distance from I = (x,y,z) to face i is |Aᵢx + Bᵢy + Cᵢz + Dᵢ|/√(Aᵢ² + Bᵢ² + Cᵢ²).  For I inside the tetrahedron these signed distances all have the same sign, so we can drop the absolute‐value bars by choosing an inward‐pointing normal for each face.  Equating these four expressions is therefore necessary and sufficient for I to be equidistant from all faces.; answer - |A₁x + B₁y + C₁z + D₁|/√(A₁² + B₁² + C₁²) = |A₂x + B₂y + C₂z + D₂|/√(A₂² + B₂² + C₂²) = |A₃x + B₃y + C₃z + D₃|/√(A₃² + B₃² + C₃²) = |A₄x + B₄y + C₄z + D₄|/√(A₄² + B₄² + C₄²)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 6 output: thinking - We set up the four point‐plane distance equations |n₁·I+D₁|/||n₁|| = |n₂·I+D₂|/||n₂|| = |n₃·I+D₃|/||n₃|| = |n₄·I+D₄|/||n₄||.

To force the distances to all four faces to be equal, we simply set these four expressions equal to one another.

Since each face is given by Aᵢx + Bᵢy + Cᵢz + Dᵢ = 0, the perpendicular distance from I = (x,y,z) to face i is |Aᵢx + Bᵢy + Cᵢz + Dᵢ|/√(Aᵢ² + Bᵢ² + Cᵢ²).  For I inside the tetrahedron these signed distances all have the same sign, so we can drop the absolute‐value bars by choosing an inward‐pointing normal for each face.  Equating these four expressions is therefore necessary and sufficient for I to be equidistant from all faces.; answer: |A₁x + B₁y + C₁z + D₁|/√(A₁² + B₁² + C₁²) = |A₂x + B₂y + C₂z + D₂|/√(A₂² + B₂² + C₂²) = |A₃x + B₃y + C₃z + D₃|/√(A₃² + B₃² + C₃²) = |A₄x + B₄y + C₄z + D₄|/√(A₄² + B₄² + C₄²)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT agent DYUd, solving system for point I, thinking: We set up the four point‐plane distance equations |n₁·I+D₁|/||n₁|| = |n₂·I+D₂|/||n₂|| = |n₃·I+D₃|/||n₃|| = |n₄·I+D₄|/||n₄||.  Because AB=CD, AC=BD, and AD=BC the tetrahedron is a disphenoid (opposite edges equal), so its incenter coincides with its centroid.
