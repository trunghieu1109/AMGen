Question: Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_2_14
proposed answer: From sub-task 6 we found that BD² approaches 480 from above but never reaches it, so the minimum possible upper bound on BD² is 480. The greatest integer strictly less than 480 is 479.

proposed answer: We verify that for any rhombus ABCD on the hyperbola x^2/20 – y^2/24 = 1 with diagonals through the origin, one may parametrize a vertex by (√20 cosh t, √24 sinh t). Then the opposite vertex is (–√20 cosh t, –√24 sinh t), so BD^2 = [2 √(20 cosh^2 t + 24 sinh^2 t)]^2 = 4(20 cosh^2 t + 24 sinh^2 t) = 80 cosh^2 t + 96 sinh^2 t = 80 + 176 sinh^2 t. Since sinh^2 t > 0 for all t ≠ 0, BD^2 > 80 always, and as t→0 it approaches 80 without ever reaching it. Hence the infimum (greatest real strictly less than every BD^2) is 80, confirming the numeric answer.
