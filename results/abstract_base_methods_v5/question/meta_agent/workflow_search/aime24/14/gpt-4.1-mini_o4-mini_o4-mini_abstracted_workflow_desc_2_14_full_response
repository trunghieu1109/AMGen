In Subtask 4 we found BD²=4(20\u2009cosh²β+24\u2009sinh²β) by taking B at parameter +β and D at –β.  \n\nWe must now state for what β this formula really describes a nondegenerate rhombus ABCD whose diagonals meet at the origin.\n\n1.  β≠0:  At β=0 both B and D coalesce at (√20,0) so the “rhombus” collapses to a line.  Thus we require β≠0.\n\n2.  By symmetry we may take β>0 (β<0 gives the same segments in reverse order).  So the natural domain of the parameter is β>0.\n\n3.  As β→0+, coshβ→1 and sinhβ→0, so BD²→4·20=80; the rhombus degenerates to a segment of length 2√20.  For any genuine rhombus one needs β>0 strictly, hence BD²>80.\n\n4.  As β→∞, coshβ and sinhβ both →∞ and BD²→∞.  Thus the range of BD² over nondegenerate rhombi is (80, ∞).\n\nGeometric implications: small β corresponds to points B,D very close to the vertex (√20,0) so the rhombus is very “flat” with a small vertical diagonal; large β pushes B,D far out so the rhombus is very “tall” and long.  No finite upper bound arises; the only universal lower bound for BD² is 80 (but this value is approached asymptotically and is not attained by any true rhombus).; answer - The one parameter β must satisfy β>0 (β≠0 or the rhombus is degenerate).  Under that condition BD²=4(20\u2009cosh²β+24\u2009sinh²β) ranges over (80,∞).  Geometrically, β→0+ gives a “flat” rhombus approaching a segment of length 2√20 (BD²→80), while β→∞ gives an arbitrarily large rhombus (BD²→∞).\n<SEPERATOR>\nSubtask 5b output: thinking - We have BD²(β)=4(20 cosh²β+24 sinh²β). Differentiating with respect to β: d(BD²)/dβ=4(40 coshβ sinhβ+48 sinhβ coshβ)=4·88 coshβ sinhβ=352 coshβ sinhβ. For β>0, coshβ>0 and sinhβ>0, hence d(BD²)/dβ>0 everywhere on (0,∞).

Thus there is no finite maximum, but the greatest real number strictly less than every value of BD² is the infimum, which is 80.; answer - 80\n<SEPERATOR>\nSubtask 6 output: thinking - We found in Subtask 5d that BD²(β)=4(20 cosh²β+24 sinh²β) is strictly increasing for β>0, with limit BD²→80 as β→0+ and BD²→∞ as β→∞. Thus the infimum of BD² over all rhombi is 80, and no smaller value can serve as a lower bound for every BD². To verify feasibility: for any β>0 the parametrized points lie on the hyperbola and form a genuine rhombus with diagonals through the origin, so BD²>80 always holds. As β→0 the rhombus becomes degenerate, making BD² arbitrarily close to 80 from above but never reaching it. Therefore 80 is indeed the greatest real number strictly less than every possible value of BD² under the given conditions.; answer - 80 is consistent and feasible as the minimal upper bound (infimum) of BD² for all such rhombi.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSubtask 7 output: thinking - The original question asks for the greatest real number that is strictly less than BD² for every rhombus ABCD inscribed in the hyperbola with diagonals through the origin.

Thus the infimum of BD² over all such rhombi is 80, and no larger number can serve as a strict lower bound.

Hence the diagonal BD=2B so\n   BD^2 = |2B|^2 = 4(20\u2009cosh^2β + 24\u2009sinh^2β).\nOne can leave it in this form or rewrite using sinh^2β = (cosh2β−1)/2, cosh^2β = (cosh2β+1)/2:\n   BD^2 = 4[20·(cosh2β+1)/2 + 24·(cosh2β−1)/2]\n          = 4(22\u2009cosh2β − 2)\n          = 88\u2009cosh2β − 8.; answer: BD^2 = 4(20\u2009cosh^2β + 24\u2009sinh^2β) = 88\u2009cosh(2β) − 8\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent fecX, express BD^2 in parameters, thinking: From Subtask 3 we have the parametrization A=(√20\u2009coshα,√24\u2009sinhα), B=(√20\u2009coshβ,√24\u2009sinhβ). The diagonal BD runs from B to D=–B, so BD=2B. Hence\n\nBD²=4( (√20\u2009coshβ)² + (√24\u2009sinhβ)² )\n      =4(20\u2009cosh²β +24\u2009sinh²β ).\n\nNo further relation between α and β enters BD², so this is the desired expression.; answer: BD²(β) = 4\\bigl(20\\cosh^2\\beta + 24\\sinh^2\\beta\\)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT agent XaiP, analyze parameter domain and constraints, thinking: The problem uses the standard one‐parameter (β) parametrization of the right‐branch hyperbola x=√20\u2009coshβ, y=√24\u2009sinhβ.  In Subtask 4 we found BD²=4(20\u2009cosh²β+24\u2009sinh²β) by taking B at parameter +β and D at –β.  \n\nWe must now state for what β this formula really describes a nondegenerate rhombus ABCD whose diagonals meet at the origin.\n\n1.  β≠0:  At β=0 both B and D coalesce at (√20,0) so the “rhombus” collapses to a line.  Thus we require β≠0.\n\n2.  By symmetry we may take β>0 (β<0 gives the same segments in reverse order).  So the natural domain of the parameter is β>0.\n\n3.  As β→0+, coshβ→1 and sinhβ→0, so BD²→4·20=80; the rhombus degenerates to a segment of length 2√20.  For any genuine rhombus one needs β>0 strictly, hence BD²>80.\n\n4.  As β→∞, coshβ and sinhβ both →∞ and BD²→∞.  Thus the range of BD² over nondegenerate rhombi is (80, ∞).\n\nGeometric implications: small β corresponds to points B,D very close to the vertex (√20,0) so the rhombus is very “flat” with a small vertical diagonal; large β pushes B,D far out so the rhombus is very “tall” and long.  No finite upper bound arises; the only universal lower bound for BD² is 80 (but this value is approached asymptotically and is not attained by any true rhombus).; answer: The one parameter β must satisfy β>0 (β≠0 or the rhombus is degenerate).  Under that condition BD²=4(20\u2009cosh²β+24\u2009sinh²β) ranges over (80,∞).  Geometrically, β→0+ gives a “flat” rhombus approaching a segment of length 2√20 (BD²→80), while β→∞ gives an arbitrarily large rhombus (BD²→∞).\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT agent sbgt, analyze monotonicity of BD^2, thinking: We have BD²(β)=4(20 cosh²β+24 sinh²β). Differentiating with respect to β: d(BD²)/dβ=4(40 coshβ sinhβ+48 sinhβ coshβ)=4·88 coshβ sinhβ=352 coshβ sinhβ. For β>0, coshβ>0 and sinhβ>0, hence d(BD²)/dβ>0 everywhere on (0,∞). Therefore BD²(β) is strictly increasing for all β>0.; answer: BD² is a strictly increasing function of β on its domain β>0.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT agent KLC0, evaluate limits of BD^2 at domain boundaries, thinking: We examine the expression BD²=4(20\u2009cosh²β+24\u2009sinh²β) on β>0. As β→0+, coshβ→1 and sinhβ→0, so BD²→4(20·1+24·0)=80. As β→∞, both coshβ and sinhβ grow without bound (≈e^β/2), so BD²→∞. These limits at the endpoints of the domain are the only candidate extremal values.; answer: As β→0+, BD²→80; as β→∞, BD²→∞\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent G3Ot, reconcile monotonicity and limits, thinking: From 5b we have BD²(β) is strictly increasing for β>0. From 5c its limits are BD²→80 as β→0+ and BD²→∞ as β→∞. Hence BD² ranges over (80,∞). There is no finite maximum but the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all β>0—the infimum of BD²—is 80.; answer: 80\n<SEPERATOR>\nCritic agent aFO8, feedback: The reconciliation is correct. Since BD²(β) is strictly increasing on β>0 with limit 80 as β→0+ and unbounded above as β→∞, BD² ranges over (80,∞). Therefore the largest real number that is still less than every BD² value is the infimum, which is 80.; correct: 80\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent G3Ot, refining reconciliation, thinking: From Subtask 5b we know BD²(β)=4(20\u2009cosh²β+24\u2009sinh²β) is strictly increasing for β>0. Subtask 5c shows that as β→0+ BD²→4(20·1+24·0)=80, and as β→∞ BD²→∞. A strictly increasing function on (0,∞) with these limits ranges over (80,∞). Thus there is no finite maximum, but the greatest real number strictly less than every value of BD² is the infimum, which is 80.; answer: 80\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT agent xYUc, verify bound feasibility, thinking: We found in Subtask 5d that BD²(β)=4(20 cosh²β+24 sinh²β) is strictly increasing for β>0, with limit BD²→80 as β→0+ and BD²→∞ as β→∞. Thus the infimum of BD² over all rhombi is 80, and no smaller value can serve as a lower bound for every BD². To verify feasibility: for any β>0 the parametrized points lie on the hyperbola and form a genuine rhombus with diagonals through the origin, so BD²>80 always holds. As β→0 the rhombus becomes degenerate, making BD² arbitrarily close to 80 from above but never reaching it. Therefore 80 is indeed the greatest real number strictly less than every possible value of BD² under the given conditions.; answer: 80 is consistent and feasible as the minimal upper bound (infimum) of BD² for all such rhombi.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent zg2K, interpret and compute greatest real number less than BD^2, thinking: We need the greatest real number L such that for every rhombus ABCD inscribed on the hyperbola x^2/20 – y^2/24 = 1 with diagonals through the origin, BD^2 > L. From the parametrization of opposing vertices by (±√20 coshβ, ±√24 sinhβ), we get BD^2 = 4(20 cosh^2β + 24 sinh^2β) = 80 + 176 sinh^2β, which is strictly increasing in β for β>0 and tends to 80 from above as β → 0+. Thus BD^2 takes all values >80, never reaching 80. Therefore the supremum of all real numbers strictly less than every BD^2 is 80 (the infimum of BD^2). Hence 80 is the greatest real number less than BD^2 for all such rhombi.; answer: 80\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent yCIj, interpret and compute greatest real number less than BD^2, thinking: We want the largest real number M such that for every rhombus ABCD inscribed in the hyperbola x^2/20 - y^2/24 = 1 with diagonals intersecting at the origin, we have M < BD^2. From the parametrization, BD^2 = 4(20 cosh^2 β + 24 sinh^2 β) is minimized in the limit β → 0^+, tending to 80 but never reaching it. For β > 0, BD^2 > 80 always, and as β grows BD^2 increases without bound. Thus the infimum of BD^2 is 80, meaning that 80 is the greatest real number that is strictly less than every possible value of BD^2. Hence the required greatest real number is 80.; answer: 80\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent VrSt, interpret and compute greatest real number less than BD^2, thinking: The original question asks for the greatest real number that is strictly less than BD² for every rhombus ABCD inscribed in the hyperbola with diagonals through the origin. From the parametrization, BD²=4(20\u2009cosh²β+24\u2009sinh²β), which decreases toward 80 as β→0+ but never reaches it, and increases without bound as β→∞. Thus the infimum of BD² over all such rhombi is 80, and no larger number can serve as a strict lower bound. Interpreting “greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi” as the greatest strict lower bound (infimum) yields 80.; answer: 80\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT agent sVJS, final verification of numeric answer, thinking: We verify that for any rhombus ABCD on the hyperbola x^2/20 – y^2/24 = 1 with diagonals through the origin, one may parametrize a vertex by (√20\u2009cosh t, √24\u2009sinh t). Then the opposite vertex is (–√20\u2009cosh t, –√24\u2009sinh t), so BD^2 = [2\u2009√(20\u2009cosh^2 t + 24\u2009sinh^2 t)]^2 = 4(20\u2009cosh^2 t + 24\u2009sinh^2 t) = 80\u2009cosh^2 t + 96\u2009sinh^2 t = 80 + 176\u2009sinh^2 t. Since sinh^2 t > 0 for all t ≠ 0, BD^2 > 80 always, and as t→0 it approaches 80 without ever reaching it. Hence the infimum (greatest real strictly less than every BD^2) is 80, confirming the numeric answer.; answer: 80', iteration_idx=-1)]
