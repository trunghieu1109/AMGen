Let N have digits d₁d₂d₃d₄ (thousands to units).

That leads to four congruences of the form N+(1−di)·10^{4−i}≡0 mod 7, which can be rewritten explicitly by plugging in i=1,2,3,4.; answer - Let N=1000d1+100d2+10d3+d4.

Let N have digits a,b,c,d so N=1000a+100b+10c+d with 1≤a≤9 and 0≤b,c,d≤9.  Replacing the first digit by 1 gives M₁=1000·1+100b+10c+d, which must satisfy M₁≡0 mod 7.  Similarly for positions 2,3,4.  To simplify, note 1000≡6, 100≡2, 10≡3 (mod 7).  Substituting these in each Mᵢ yields four linear congruences in a,b,c,d.; answer: Let N=1000a+100b+10c+d.

We translate each replacement into a congruence mod 7. For position 1, we replace d1 by 1 in the 1000’s place; for position 2, replace d2 by 1 in the 100’s place; and so on. Each gives a linear combination of d1,…,d4 plus a constant term of 1·10^(4−i) ≡0 mod 7.; answer: Let N=d1·1000+d2·100+d3·10+d4. The four divisibility‐by‐7 conditions are: 1) (1·1000 + d2·100 + d3·10 + d4) ≡ 0 mod 7. 2) (d1·1000 + 1·100 + d3·10 + d4) ≡ 0 mod 7. 3) (d1·1000 + d2·100 + 1·10 + d4) ≡ 0 mod 7. 4) (d1·1000 + d2·100 + d3·10 + 1) ≡ 0 mod 7.\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent jimh, analyze modular equations, thinking: We start with the four linear congruences (mod 7) from Sub‐task 2 and reduce them by substituting the coefficients mod 7: 1000≡6, 100≡2, 10≡3.  This yields\n1) 2d2+3d3+d4≡1\n2) 6d1+3d3+d4≡5\n3) 6d1+2d2+d4≡4\n4) 6d1+2d2+3d3≡6\n(all mod 7).  Subtracting (3) from (4) gives d4≡3d3+5.  Subtracting (2)–(3) gives 3d3−2d2≡1, so d2≡3d1+5 after also using d3≡2d1−1 from comparing (1) & (4).  Finally d4≡6d1+2.  Thus all digits are determined mod 7 by d1.  Since each residue class in 0–6 can only lift to at most two decimal digits in 0–9, for each d1∈1…9 there are at most 2 choices for each of d2,d3,d4.

Its main limitations are:\n1) It treats the “at most two lifts” bound as tight for every residue, but in fact some residues only lift once (e.g. 0 mod 7 → {0,7}, others → {7} only when out of range), so the actual search space is smaller than 72.\n2) It ignores that d1 cannot be 0, so there are only 9 choices for d1, not 10.\n3) It only gives necessary congruence conditions; one still must test each candidate to ensure that replacing each digit by 1 yields a multiple of 7 (the congruences ensure divisibility in only one position at a time).; answer: A more precise reduction is: for each digit d1 ∈ {1,…,9}, compute the unique sets\n  S2={digits 0–9 with residue ≡3d1+5 mod 7},\n  S3={digits 0–9 with residue ≡2d1−1 mod 7},\n  S4={digits 0–9 with residue ≡6d1+2 mod 7}.\nEach Si has size 1 or 2, so the total candidates are ∑_{d1=1}^9|S2|·|S3|·|S4|, which is less than 72.
