        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - We need to restate explicitly the key constraint on the four\u2010digit number N in the original problem.  Let N have digits d\u2081d\u2082d\u2083d\u2084 (thousands to units).  The requirement is: for each index i from 1 to 4, if we form a new number by replacing the i-th digit d\u1d62 with 1 (and leaving the other digits the same), the resulting four-digit number must be divisible by 7.  This gives four separate divisibility\u2010by\u20107 conditions, one for each digit position.  We also note that N must itself be a four-digit integer (1000\u2264N\u22649999).; answer - The constraint is: for each digit position of the four-digit number N, if that digit is replaced by 1 (and all other digits remain unchanged), the new number must be divisible by 7.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - We need to let N have digits d1,d2,d3,d4 so that N=1000d1+100d2+10d3+d4, and then for each position i, replacing di by 1 yields a number divisible by 7.  That leads to four congruences of the form N+(1\u2212di)\u00b710^{4\u2212i}\u22610 mod 7, which can be rewritten explicitly by plugging in i=1,2,3,4.; answer - Let N=1000d1+100d2+10d3+d4.  The four conditions are:\n1) Replace d1: 1000\u00b71 +100d2+10d3+d4 \u22610 mod 7\n2) Replace d2: 1000d1+100\u00b71 +10d3+d4 \u22610 mod 7\n3) Replace d3: 1000d1+100d2+10\u00b71 +d4 \u22610 mod 7\n4) Replace d4: 1000d1+100d2+10d3+1 \u22610 mod 7\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - We have the four congruences from Sub\u2010task 2: replacing each digit by 1 must give a multiple of 7. Reducing coefficients mod 7 (1000\u22616,100\u22612,10\u22613) and comparing yields three independent congruences:  \n\nd2\u22613d1+5 (mod 7),  \nd3\u22612d1\u22121 (mod 7),  \nd4\u22616d1+2 (mod 7).  \n\nSince N is four\u2010digit, d1\u2208{1,\u2026,9}. Each residue class r\u2208{0,\u2026,6} lifts to at most two decimal digits in {0,\u2026,9} (r and r+7 if r\u22642), so each of d2,d3,d4 has at most 2 possible values for each choice of d1.  Thus the total candidates \u22649\u00b72\u00b72\u00b72=72.  A careful count of actual lifts shows only 30 four\u2010digit numbers fit these congruences and must be checked for the full \u201creplace any digit by 1\u201d divisibility property.; answer - We derive the digit constraints\nd2\u22613d1+5 (mod 7), d3\u22612d1\u22121 (mod 7), d4\u22616d1+2 (mod 7), with d1\u2208{1,\u2026,9}.  Each congruence lifts to at most two decimal digits, reducing the search to just 30 four\u2010digit candidates to test.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - We use the three congruences from Sub\u2010task 2: for N=d1d2d3d4, reducing mod 7 yields\nd2\u22613d1+5, d3\u22612d1\u22121, d4\u22616d1+2 (mod 7).  For each d1\u22081\u20269, lift each residue to digits \u22649 by optionally adding 7.  This yields up to 8 candidates per d1, but only 30 total across d1.  Finally we impose the fourth condition (replacement of d1\u21921): 6+2d2+3d3+d4\u22610 (mod 7).  Checking all 30 shows only two numbers satisfy all four replacements at once: 5624 and 5694.; answer - 5624, 5694\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - From the candidate set {5624, 5694} that satisfy the property of all single-digit-to-1 replacements being divisible by 7, 5694 is larger than 5624. Therefore, the greatest four-digit number N with the required property is 5694.; answer - 5694\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 6 output: thinking - We have identified N=5694. Dividing N by 1000, we perform integer division: 5694 \u00f7 1000 = 5 remainder 694, because 5\u00d71000=5000 and 5694\u22125000=694. Thus the quotient Q is 5 and the remainder R is 694.; answer - Q=5 and R=694\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 7 output: thinking - From Sub-task 6, we found Q=5 and R=694. The problem asks for Q+R. Compute 5 + 694 = 699.; answer - 699"
