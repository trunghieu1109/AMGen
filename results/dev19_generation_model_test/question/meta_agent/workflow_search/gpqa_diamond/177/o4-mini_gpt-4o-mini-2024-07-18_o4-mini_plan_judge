proposed answer: To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant \kappa in the interaction Lagrangian \mathcal{L}_{int}=\kappa\bar{\psi}\sigma_{\mu\nu}\psi F^{\mu\nu}, we perform dimensional analysis. The mass dimensions of the components are: \bar{\psi} (3/2), \psi (3/2), F^{\mu\nu} (2), and \sigma_{\mu\nu} is dimensionless. Therefore, the total mass dimension of the product \bar{\psi}\sigma_{\mu\nu}\psi F^{\mu\nu} is \frac{3}{2} + 0 + \frac{3}{2} + 2 = 5. For the Lagrangian to have a total mass dimension of 4, \kappa must have a mass dimension of [\kappa]_{M} = 4 - 5 = -1. In quantum field theory, a coupling constant with a negative mass dimension indicates that the theory is not renormalizable, as it suggests that the coupling grows with energy, leading to uncontrollable divergences. Therefore, the correct choice is that the mass dimension of \kappa is -1 and the theory is not renormalizable, which corresponds to choice C.
