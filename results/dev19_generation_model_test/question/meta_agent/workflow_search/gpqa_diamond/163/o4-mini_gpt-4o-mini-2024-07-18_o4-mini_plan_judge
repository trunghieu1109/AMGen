Question: Example(question='Astronomers are studying two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2. Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.', choice1='~ 0.4', choice2='~ 0.7', choice3='~ 0.6\n', choice4='~ 1.2', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: To determine the mass ratio of the two binary star systems, we utilize the derived formula M_total,1 / M_total,2 = ((K1a + K1b)^3 * P1) / ((K2a + K2b)^3 * P2). We have the following values: P1 = 2 years, P2 = 1 year, K1a + K1b = 15 km/s, and K2a + K2b = 25 km/s. First, we compute the numerator: (K1a + K1b)^3 * P1 = 15^3 * 2. Calculating 15^3 gives us 3375, and multiplying by 2 results in 6750. Next, we compute the denominator: (K2a + K2b)^3 * P2 = 25^3 * 1. Calculating 25^3 gives us 15625, and multiplying by 1 keeps it as 15625. Now we find the ratio: M_total,1 / M_total,2 = 6750 / 15625, which yields approximately 0.432. This indicates that system_1 is about 0.432 times the mass of system_2. When comparing this value to the provided options (~0.4, ~0.7, ~0.6, ~1.2), the closest match is ~0.4. Therefore, I conclude that system_1 is about 0.4 times the mass of system_2, which aligns with choice A.
