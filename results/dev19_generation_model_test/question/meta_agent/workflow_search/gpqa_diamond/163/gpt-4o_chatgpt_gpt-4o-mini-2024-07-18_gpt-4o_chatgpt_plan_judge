proposed answer: To determine the mass factor between system_1 and system_2, we analyze the provided data regarding their orbital periods and radial velocity amplitudes. System_1 has a longer orbital period of 2 years and lower radial velocity amplitudes (10 km/s and 5 km/s) compared to system_2, which has a period of 1 year and higher amplitudes (15 km/s and 10 km/s). According to Kepler's laws, a longer orbital period typically indicates a lower total mass for the binary system. The mass function for binary stars relates the total mass to the radial velocity amplitudes and the orbital period. Given that system_1's total mass is derived to be approximately 0.6 times that of system_2, we conclude that system_1 is not more massive but rather less massive than system_2 by this factor. Therefore, the answer is C, indicating that system_1 is about 0.6 times the mass of system_2.

proposed answer: To determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we need to analyze the relationship between the orbital periods and the radial velocity amplitudes of the stars in each system. The mass of a binary star system can be estimated using the mass function, which relates the total mass of the system to the orbital period and the radial velocity amplitudes. For system_1, the orbital period is 2 years, and the total radial velocity amplitude is 15 km/s (10 km/s + 5 km/s). For system_2, the orbital period is 1 year, and the total radial velocity amplitude is 25 km/s (15 km/s + 10 km/s). The mass function can be expressed as M_total ∝ P * (K₁ + K₂)³, where P is the orbital period and K₁ + K₂ is the sum of the radial velocity amplitudes. Therefore, we can express the masses as follows: M_total_system_1 ∝ 2 * (15)³ and M_total_system_2 ∝ 1 * (25)³. Calculating the ratio of these two expressions gives us the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2. After performing the calculations, we find that system_1 is approximately 0.6 times the mass of system_2, indicating that system_1 is less massive rather than more. Therefore, the correct choice that reflects this relationship is ~ 0.6, which corresponds to choice C. This conclusion is consistent with the analysis and confirms that system_1 is not more massive than system_2, but rather less so, by a factor of approximately 0.6.
