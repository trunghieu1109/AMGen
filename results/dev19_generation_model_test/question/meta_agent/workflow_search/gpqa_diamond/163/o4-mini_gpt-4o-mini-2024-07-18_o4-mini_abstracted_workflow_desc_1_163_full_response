For system_1, we have M_total,1 ∝ (K1a + K1b)^3 * P1, and for system_2, M_total,2 ∝ (K2a + K2b)^3 * P2. Therefore, the ratio of the total masses can be expressed as M_total,1 / M_total,2 = ((K1a + K1b)^3 * P1) / ((K2a + K2b)^3 * P2).

For two stars in a binary system, we can express the total mass in terms of the radial velocity amplitudes. We combine these relationships to find M_total for both systems. For system_1, we have: M_total,1 ∝ (K1a + K1b)^3 * P1 and for system_2: M_total,2 ∝ (K2a + K2b)^3 * P2.

According to Kepler's Third Law, the total mass of a binary system is related to the orbital period and the semi-major axis of the orbit. The total mass M_total is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis divided by the square of the period: M_total ∝ a^3 / P^2. For each system, we can express the total mass in terms of the observable quantities: M_total,1 ∝ (K1a + K1b)^3 * P1 and M_total,2 ∝ (K2a + K2b)^3 * P2. Thus, the ratio of the total masses can be expressed as M_total,1 / M_total,2 = [(K1a + K1b)^3 * P1] / [(K2a + K2b)^3 * P2]. This formula shows how the total masses of the two systems relate to their periods and the sum of their radial velocity amplitudes.

Therefore, we can express this as M_total ∝ a^3 / P^2. Additionally, the radial velocity amplitudes relate to the masses of the stars and the orbital parameters. For each system, the total mass can be estimated using the relation K ∝ (M_other)/(M_total)·(2πa/P)·sin i. We can combine the two relations to express the total mass in terms of the observed parameters. The total mass for each system can be approximated as M_total,1 ∝ P1 * (K1a + K1b)^3 and M_total,2 ∝ P2 * (K2a + K2b)^3, assuming sin i is constant for both systems. Thus, the ratio of the total masses can be expressed as M_total,1 / M_total,2 = (P1 * (K1a + K1b)^3) / (P2 * (K2a + K2b)^3).

The formula states that the mass ratio M_total,1 / M_total,2 can be expressed as ((K1a + K1b)^3 * P1) / ((K2a + K2b)^3 * P2). Given the values: P1 = 2 years, P2 = 1 year, K1a + K1b = 15 km/s, and K2a + K2b = 25 km/s, we can compute the mass ratio step-by-step. First, we calculate the numerator: (15)^3 * 2 = 3375 * 2 = 6750. Next, we calculate the denominator: (25)^3 * 1 = 15625. We then find the ratio: M_total,1 / M_total,2 = 6750 / 15625, which approximately equals 0.432. This value indicates that system_1 is about 0.432 times the mass of system_2. Among the provided options (~0.4, ~0.7, ~0.6, ~1.2), the closest match to 0.432 is ~0.4. Therefore, I conclude that system_1 is approximately 0.4 times as massive as system_2.; answer: A\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent yMH0, round 0, thinking: To determine the mass ratio of the two binary star systems, we can use the derived formula that relates the total mass of each system to their orbital periods and the sum of their radial velocity amplitudes. We have already calculated the mass ratio as M_total,1 / M_total,2 = ((K1a + K1b)^3 * P1) / ((K2a + K2b)^3 * P2). Substituting the values: P1 = 2 years, P2 = 1 year, K1a + K1b = 15 km/s, and K2a + K2b = 25 km/s gives us a numerator of 6750 and a denominator of 15625. When we divide these, we get approximately 0.432. This value needs to be compared with the provided choices. The closest choice to 0.432 is ~0.4, which corresponds to option A.

We substitute the values: P1 = 2 years, P2 = 1 year, K1a + K1b = 15 km/s, and K2a + K2b = 25 km/s. Calculating the numerator gives us (15^3 * 2) = 3375 * 2 = 6750. The denominator calculates as (25^3 * 1) = 15625. Thus, the ratio is 6750 / 15625, which approximates to 0.432. The closest option provided is ~0.4, aligning with the computed value.
