proposed answer: To determine the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of the electron, we apply the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which states that Δx·Δp ≥ ħ/2. Given the uncertainty in position Δx = 0.1 nm = 1 × 10^-10 m, we can calculate the uncertainty in momentum Δp. Using ħ (reduced Planck's constant) approximately equal to 1.055 × 10^-34 J·s, we find Δp = ħ/(2Δx) = (1.055 × 10^-34 J·s) / (2 × 1 × 10^-10 m) = 5.275 × 10^-25 kg·m/s. The speed of the electron is given as v = 2 × 10^8 m/s. The uncertainty in energy ΔE can be approximated using the relationship ΔE ≈ v·Δp. Substituting the values, we get ΔE ≈ (2 × 10^8 m/s) * (5.275 × 10^-25 kg·m/s) ≈ 1.055 × 10^-16 J. This result indicates that the uncertainty in energy is on the order of 10^-16 J. Comparing this with the provided options: ~10^(-19) J, ~10^(-18) J, ~10^(-16) J, and ~10^(-17) J, the closest match is ~10^(-16) J. Therefore, I conclude that the answer is C, as it aligns with our calculations and reflects the expected order of magnitude for the uncertainty in energy based on the uncertainties in position and momentum.
