proposed answer: To estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy (ΔE) of the electron, we start by applying the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states that Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2. Here, Δx is the uncertainty in position, which is given as 0.1 nm (or 0.1 * 10^(-9) m). The reduced Planck's constant ħ is approximately 1.055 x 10^(-34) J·s. We can rearrange the uncertainty principle to find Δp: Δp ≥ ħ/(2Δx). Substituting the values, we calculate Δp as follows: Δp ≥ (1.055 x 10^(-34) J·s) / (2 * 0.1 * 10^(-9) m) = 5.275 x 10^(-25) kg·m/s. Next, we relate Δp to ΔE. For a non-relativistic electron, the uncertainty in energy can be approximated using the formula ΔE = (v/m)Δp, where v is the speed of the electron (2 * 10^8 m/s) and m is the mass of the electron (approximately 9.11 x 10^(-31) kg). Substituting these values into the equation gives us ΔE = (2 * 10^8 m/s / 9.11 x 10^(-31) kg) * (5.275 x 10^(-25) kg·m/s). Calculating this yields ΔE ≈ 1.16 x 10^(-18) J. Comparing this value with the provided choices, the closest match is ~10^(-18) J, which corresponds to choice B. Therefore, the minimum uncertainty in the energy of the electron is best estimated as ~10^(-18) J.

proposed answer: To estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy (ΔE) of the electron, we start by applying the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states that Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2. Given Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 * 10^(-9) m and ħ ≈ 1.055 * 10^(-34) J·s, we can calculate the uncertainty in momentum (Δp). Rearranging the equation gives us Δp ≥ ħ/(2Δx). Substituting the values, we find Δp = (1.055 * 10^(-34) J·s) / (2 * 0.1 * 10^(-9) m) = 5.275 * 10^(-25) kg·m/s. Next, we relate Δp to ΔE using the formula ΔE = vΔp, where v is the speed of the electron (v = 2 * 10^8 m/s). Thus, ΔE = (2 * 10^8 m/s) * (5.275 * 10^(-25) kg·m/s) = 1.055 * 10^(-16) J. This value is closest to the choice ~10^(-16) J, which corresponds to option C. Therefore, the correct answer is C, as it aligns with the calculated uncertainty in energy based on the given parameters.
