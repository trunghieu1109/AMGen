Question: Example(question='Two stars are being studied. It has been observed that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2. In fact, the energy difference between the considered energy levels was determined to be approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J. Assuming that the stellar photospheres are in LTE, which of these equations for the effective temperatures of the stars (T_1 and T_2) is correct?', choice1='ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]\n', choice2='ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]\n', choice3='ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n', choice4='ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: To determine the correct equation relating the effective temperatures of the two stars based on the given population ratio of excited iron atoms, we start from the Boltzmann distribution. The population ratio N₁/N₂ is given as 2, which leads to the equation ln(2) = ΔE/(k) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁). Rearranging this gives us ln(2) = (T₁ - T₂)/(T₁*T₂) when we consider the relationship between the temperatures and the energy difference. This matches the form of the equation in choice 4. The other choices either do not correctly relate ln(2) to the temperature difference or involve incorrect algebraic manipulations. Therefore, the correct choice that matches our derived formula is choice D, ln(2) = [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁*T₂)]. This conclusion is supported by multiple analyses that consistently arrive at the same relationship derived from the Boltzmann distribution, confirming that choice D accurately reflects the relationship between the effective temperatures and the population ratio of the excited states of iron in the two stars.
