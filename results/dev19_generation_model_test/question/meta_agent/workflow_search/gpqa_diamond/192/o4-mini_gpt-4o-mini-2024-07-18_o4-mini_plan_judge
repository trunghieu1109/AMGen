Question: Example(question='In a specific region of the sky, astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?', choice1='~ r^2', choice2='~ r^4', choice3='~ r^3', choice4='~ r^5', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: To determine how the number of stars changes with distance, we start with the relationship given in the problem: the number density of stars is proportional to 1/plx^5. Since parallax (plx) is inversely related to distance (r), we can express plx as approximately 1/r. Substituting this into the density relation gives us density proportional to r^5. However, to find the number of stars per unit distance, we must consider the geometry of the situation. The volume element for counting stars in a spherical shell is proportional to r^2 dr. Therefore, the total number of stars N(r) in that shell is given by the product of the density and the volume element: N(r) ∝ (r^5) * (r^2 dr) = r^7 dr. When we differentiate this expression with respect to distance to find the number of stars per unit solid angle and per unit distance, we obtain dN/dr, which will yield a term proportional to r^6. However, the solid angle contributes a factor of r^2, leading us to conclude that the number of stars per unit solid angle and per unit distance dN/dΩ/dr is proportional to r^3. Thus, the derived relationship aligns with the choice of ~r^3, confirming that the number of stars in that region of the sky changes with distance in proportion to r^3.
