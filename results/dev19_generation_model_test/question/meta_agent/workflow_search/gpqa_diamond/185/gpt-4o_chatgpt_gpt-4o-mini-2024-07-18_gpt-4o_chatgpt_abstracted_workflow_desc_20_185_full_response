The Cope rearrangement is a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement, meaning that there will be a migration of sigma bonds involving the breaking and forming of bonds in a concerted manner. We will number the atoms in the bicyclic structure to clearly illustrate the movement of the sigma bonds. The process involves the migration of the double bond from the 2-position to the 4-position, resulting in the formation of a new ring structure. Each potential cyclopenta[c]pyridine isomer will be derived from different configurations of the sigma bond shifts during the rearrangement. The stereochemistry of the original compound will influence the final product, leading to different isomers depending on how the sigma bonds are rearranged. By carefully mapping out each step of the sigma bond shifts and considering the implications of stereochemistry, we can identify the possible products of the Cope rearrangement.

In this case, the starting structure can be visualized as two rings connected to a vinyl group. As we initiate the Cope rearrangement, we will show how the sigma bonds shift step by step to form each potential isomer of cyclopenta[c]pyridine. We will track the movement of the bonds and the resulting changes in the structure, paying close attention to the stereochemistry at each step, as it will affect the final product.
