proposed answer: To determine the correct expression for the mass of the pseudo-Goldstone boson H_2 through radiative corrections, we analyze the contributions from both bosonic and fermionic fields as outlined in the previous analysis. The bosonic contributions include the Higgs boson (h_1), the W and Z gauge bosons, the charged Higgs (H^{±}), the neutral Higgs (H^{0}), and the pseudoscalar Higgs (A^{0}). Each of these bosons contributes positively to the effective potential due to their interactions with the scalar fields involved in the symmetry breaking. The fermionic contributions arise from the singlet fermions N_{iR} and possibly the top quark (t), which contribute negatively due to their Yukawa interactions with the scalar fields. The overall prefactor of the expression is crucial and stems from the normalization of the effective potential, which is inversely proportional to the square of the vacuum expectation values (VEVs) of the scalar fields involved. Given that the combined VEVs are expressed as ⟨φ⟩² = x² + v², the prefactor should be 1/(x² + v²). Therefore, the complete expression for the mass squared of the pseudo-Goldstone boson H_2, incorporating both the bosonic and fermionic contributions with the correct signs, is assembled as follows: M_{h_2}^2 = (1/(8π²(x² + v²))) * (α_1M_{h_1}^4 + α_2M_W^4 + α_3M_Z^4 + α_4M_{H^{±}}^4 + α_5M_{H^{0}}^4 + α_6M_{A^{0}}^4 - α_7∑M_{N_i}^4). This expression accurately reflects the contributions from all relevant fields and their respective signs, ensuring a comprehensive assembly of the one-loop mass for H_2. Therefore, the most consistent assembled mass expression is choice A, which matches the derived expression exactly.
