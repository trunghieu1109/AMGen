Question: Example(question='Astronomers are interested in the luminosities of two stars. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2. The mass of Star_1 is also larger by the same factor (1.5 times).

Astronomers also calculated the radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_32_176
proposed answer: To determine the luminosity factor between Star_1 and Star_2, we apply the Stefan-Boltzmann Law, which states that the luminosity (L) of a black body is proportional to the square of its radius (R) and the fourth power of its temperature (T): L = 4πR^2σT^4. Since both stars have the same peak wavelength, they have the same temperature, allowing us to focus solely on their radii. Given that Star_1 has a radius that is 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2, we can denote the radius of Star_2 as R. Therefore, the radius of Star_1 is 1.5R. The luminosity of Star_1 can be expressed as L_1 = 4π(1.5R)^2σT^4 = 4π(2.25R^2)σT^4 = 2.25 * (4πR^2σT^4) = 2.25 * L_2. This calculation shows that the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of 2.25. Thus, the most consistent and correct solution for the luminosity factor is approximately 2.25, which corresponds to choice A).

proposed answer: To determine the luminosity ratio of Star_1 to Star_2, we apply the Stefan-Boltzmann Law, which states that luminosity (L) is proportional to the square of the radius (R) and the fourth power of the temperature (T). Since both stars have the same peak wavelength, they share the same temperature. Given that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2, we can express the luminosities as follows: L_1 = 4π(1.5R)^2σT^4 and L_2 = 4πR^2σT^4. Simplifying L_1 gives us L_1 = 4π(2.25R^2)σT^4 = 2.25L_2. This indicates that the luminosity of Star_1 is approximately 2.25 times greater than that of Star_2. Therefore, the correct answer choice that matches this computed factor is ~2.25, which corresponds to choice A. All analyses confirm that the factor is indeed 2.25, and thus the answer is A.
