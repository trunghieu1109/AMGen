proposed answer: To confirm the validity of the identified compound, 4-chlorobenzoic acid, we need to analyze the spectral data provided and ensure it aligns with the expected characteristics of this compound. Starting with mass spectrometry, the molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 confirms that the molecular weight of 4-chlorobenzoic acid is indeed 156 g/mol. The additional peak at m/z = 158 indicates the presence of a chlorine isotope, which is consistent with the presence of chlorine in the structure of 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Next, we examine the IR spectroscopy data. The broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1 suggests the presence of an O-H group, which is characteristic of carboxylic acids, and 4-chlorobenzoic acid contains such a group. The strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 corresponds to the carbonyl (C=O) stretch, which is also present in carboxylic acids, further supporting the identification of 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Moving to the 1H NMR data, the singlet at 11.0 ppm indicates a hydrogen atom associated with an O-H group, confirming the presence of the carboxylic acid functional group. The doublets at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm correspond to aromatic protons, which fit the expected chemical environment of protons on the aromatic ring of 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The splitting pattern indicates that these protons are in a para or ortho relationship, which is consistent with the structure of 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Therefore, all spectral data points—mass spectrometry, IR, and NMR—are consistent with the structure of 4-chlorobenzoic acid, confirming its validity as the identified compound. Thus, the final answer is A.
