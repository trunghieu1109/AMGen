Question: Example(question='In the lab, a chemist discovers an unnamed bottle with a white solid inside. He gathers the following spectral information in order to identify the liquid. Make a reasonable structural suggestion for the unidentified drug using the information provided.\nMass: molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 (100%)\na peak at m/z = 158 (32%)\nIR : broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1, strong sharp peak at 1720 cm-1\n1H NMR: 11.0 ppm (s, 1H), 8.02 ppm (d, 2H), 7.72 (d, 2H)', choice1='4-chlorobenzoic acid', choice2='2-chlorobenzoic acid', choice3='3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde\n', choice4='Phenyl chloroformate', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: The molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 indicates a molecular weight of 156 g/mol, which is consistent with the structures of the provided options. The presence of a secondary peak at m/z = 158 suggests the presence of chlorine, as chlorine has a characteristic isotopic pattern. The broad IR absorption from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ indicates an O–H stretch typical of carboxylic acids, while the sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ suggests a C=O stretch, further supporting the presence of a carboxylic acid or an aldehyde. The ¹H NMR data shows a singlet at 11.0 ppm, which corresponds to a hydrogen-bonded acidic proton from a –COOH group, confirming the presence of a carboxylic acid. The two doublets at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm, each integrating to 2H, indicate a symmetrical substitution pattern on an aromatic ring, specifically para-substitution. Among the provided options, 4-chlorobenzoic acid fits this description best, as it has a chlorine atom in the para position relative to the carboxylic acid group, which aligns with the observed NMR and IR data. The other options either do not match the molecular weight, do not have the correct functional groups, or do not exhibit the expected NMR patterns. Therefore, 4-chlorobenzoic acid is the most plausible candidate based on the spectral data and structural analysis.
