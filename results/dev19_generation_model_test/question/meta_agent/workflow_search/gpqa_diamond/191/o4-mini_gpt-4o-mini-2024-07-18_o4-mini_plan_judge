proposed answer: In this scenario, we have a neutral spherical conductor with a cavity containing a positive charge +q. According to Gauss's law, the electric field outside a conductor only depends on the net charge enclosed within a Gaussian surface that lies outside the conductor. Since the conductor is neutral and the charge +q induces a charge of -q on the inner surface of the cavity, the outer surface of the conductor must acquire a charge of +q to maintain overall neutrality. This means that when we consider a point outside the spherical conductor, the only charge that influences the electric field at that point is the total charge on the outer surface, which is +q. The electric field at any point outside the conductor, therefore, can be calculated as if all the charge +q were concentrated at the center of the sphere. Consequently, the electric field at a distance L from the center of the conductor is given by E = (1/(4πε₀))(q/L²). This conclusion holds true regardless of the position of the charge +q within the cavity, as the induced charges on the inner surface and the resulting charge on the outer surface are determined solely by the presence of +q, not its specific location. Thus, the electric field outside the conductor depends only on the net charge +q and the radial distance L from the center of the conductor, confirming the application of Gauss's law and the uniqueness theorem in electrostatics.

proposed answer: In this problem, we have a spherical conductor with a cavity containing a positive charge +q. The electric field at a point P outside the conductor depends on the charge +q and the geometry of the system. By Gauss's Law, the electric field outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution behaves as if all charge were concentrated at the center of the sphere. Since the conductor is uncharged and the charge +q induces a charge distribution on the inner surface of the cavity, this results in a net charge of +q on the outer surface of the conductor. The electric field at point P, which is located at a distance L from the center of the conductor, will thus depend solely on L and the charge +q. The distance from the cavity's center to point P is l, and the angle θ is given, but these parameters do not affect the electric field at point P due to the spherical symmetry. Therefore, the correct expression for the electric field E at point P is given by the formula that includes L in the denominator, which corresponds to choice D. This reasoning leads to the conclusion that the electric field is given by E = (1/(4πε₀))(q/L²), confirming that the electric field at point P is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the center of the conductor, which is L. Thus, the answer is D.
