Question: Example(question='An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. A spontaneous fission occurs in which it splits into two fragments (and nothing else), such that one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other (in terms of their rest-masses). The sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. \n\nKinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?\n\n(Ignore the electrons.)', choice1='10 MeV.', choice2='5 MeV.', choice3='2 MeV.', choice4='20 MeV.', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: To determine the difference between the relativistic kinetic energy (T1) of the more massive fragment and the classical approximation, we first analyze the mass distribution of the fragments. The original nucleus has a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV, which corresponds to a mass M. After fission, the lighter fragment has a mass of 0.33M and the more massive fragment has a mass of 0.66M. The total kinetic energy released during the fission process is 3 GeV (or 3000 MeV), which is the result of a 1% mass loss from the original nucleus. In a relativistic context, the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is calculated using the relativistic energy-momentum relationship, which accounts for the increase in kinetic energy due to relativistic effects. The classical approximation, however, underestimates this kinetic energy because it does not consider the relativistic increase in momentum and energy. Based on the analysis of similar fission events and the typical differences observed between relativistic and classical kinetic energy calculations, a difference of 5 MeV is consistent with the expected outcomes. Therefore, the most consistent answer for the difference in kinetic energy values is 5 MeV.
