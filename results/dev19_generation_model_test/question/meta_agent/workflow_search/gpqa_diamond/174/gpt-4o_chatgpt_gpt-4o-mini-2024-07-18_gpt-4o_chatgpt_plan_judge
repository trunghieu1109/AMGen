Question: Example(question='Consider an oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis). Because it oscillates, it would radiate at a wavelength \\lambda. In the radiation zone, the radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of \\lambda and the angle \\theta (with z-axis), along which the power is measured. If the maximum power thus radiated is A, the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle \\theta = 30^0 and a possible form of f are, respectively,', choice1='1/2, \\lambda^(-4)', choice2='3/4, \\lambda^(-6)', choice3='1/4, \\lambda^(-4)', choice4='1/4, \\lambda^(-3)', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: To determine the correct choice for the fraction of maximum power A radiated at an angle θ = 30°, we need to analyze the provided options carefully. Each option gives a specific fraction of A and a dependence on the wavelength λ. The angle θ = 30° is significant in the context of radiation patterns, suggesting that we should expect a notable fraction of power to be radiated at this angle. The choice '3/4, λ^(-6)' indicates a strong dependence on λ and suggests a high fraction of power radiated at a significant angle. This aligns with the physical understanding of radiation from oscillating charge distributions, where certain angles yield more pronounced radiation due to geometric and energetic factors involved. Other options either suggest lower fractions or different dependencies that are less likely for such a significant angle. Therefore, after careful consideration of the context and the physics of radiation, the most appropriate answer is 'B', which represents the fraction of A radiated at θ = 30°.
