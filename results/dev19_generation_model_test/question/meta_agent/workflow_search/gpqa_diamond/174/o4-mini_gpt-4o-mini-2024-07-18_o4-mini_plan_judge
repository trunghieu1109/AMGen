proposed answer: To determine the correct answer, we need to analyze the computed values for the fraction of the maximum power radiated at an angle of 30 degrees and the corresponding wavelength dependence. From previous calculations, we found that the fraction of power radiated at theta = 30 degrees is 1/4, derived from the ratio of sin²(30°) to the maximum value of sin²(theta), where sin²(30°) = 1/4 and the maximum value of sin²(theta) is 1. Additionally, we established that the wavelength dependence for a dipole radiation pattern is proportional to λ^(-4). Among the provided choices, the only one that matches both the fraction (1/4) and the wavelength dependence (λ^(-4)) is choice 3. Therefore, the correct answer is C.

proposed answer: In analyzing the problem, we have established that the fraction of the maximum power radiated at an angle of θ = 30° is 3/4, which corresponds to the angular distribution of a quadrupole radiation pattern. Additionally, the wavelength dependence for the quadrupole moment is known to scale as λ^(-6). Therefore, when we combine these two results, we find that the correct answer must reflect both the angular fraction of 3/4 and the wavelength dependence of λ^(-6). This matches with choice B, which states 3/4, λ^(-6). Other choices do not align with both components derived from the analysis. Thus, the final answer is B.
