proposed answer: The reaction of Compound X with red phosphorus and HI indicates a reduction process, specifically targeting the carboxylic acid functional group present in Compound X. The IR data shows a broad peak at 3400–2500 cm-1, which is characteristic of O-H stretching, and a C=O stretch at 1720 cm-1, confirming the presence of a carboxylic acid. The 1H NMR data supports this with a broad singlet at 10.5 ppm, indicative of an acidic proton from the carboxylic acid. Upon reaction with red phosphorus and HI, the carboxylic acid is expected to be reduced to an alkane, which means the carbonyl group and the hydroxyl group will be removed. The aromatic ring and the alkyl chain will remain intact, leading to a saturated hydrocarbon structure. Among the choices provided, '4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid' (choice B) is not a suitable final product as it still contains the carboxylic acid group, which would be eliminated during the reduction. The correct choice should be a hydrocarbon that reflects the remaining structure after the reduction. The other choices include hydrocarbons that do not contain carboxylic acid functionalities. The one that best matches the expected outcome of the reduction process is '1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene' (choice A), which retains the aromatic structure without the acidic group. Therefore, the correct answer is A.
