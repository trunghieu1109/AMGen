Question: Example(question='Imagine an operator $\\vec{P}$ of a system have components $P_x, P_y$ and $P_z$. The matrix form of the  operator $P_x$ has components in the first row as $(0, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,\\hbar/\\sqrt{2},0)$.  The matrix form of the  operator $P_y$ has components in the first row as $(0, -i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0, -i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2},0)$. Similarly, matrix form of the  operator $P_z$ has components in the first row as $(\\hbar, 0, 0)$, that in the second row as $(0, 0, 0)$ and that in the third row as $(0,0, -\\hbar)$. The basis vectors here are the eigenvectors of $P_z$. The system is found in the eigenstate of $P_x$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$. To be more specific, the explicit form of the state of the system is given by the column vector having elements $(-1/2, 1/\\sqrt{2}, -1/2)$. What is the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z $ of $P_z$', choice1='\\hbar\n', choice2='\\hbar/2', choice3='\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}\n', choice4='\\sqrt{2}\\hbar', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: To calculate the uncertainty ΔPz, we need to find ⟨Pz²⟩ and ⟨Pz⟩. We already determined that ⟨Pz⟩ = 0. Now we compute ⟨Pz²⟩. The operator Pz is given by the matrix Pz = ħ * diag(1, 0, -1). Therefore, Pz² = Pz * Pz = ħ² * diag(1, 0, 1). The expectation value ⟨Pz²⟩ is calculated as follows: ⟨Pz²⟩ = ⟨ψ|Pz²|ψ⟩. Applying Pz² to |ψ⟩ gives us Pz²|ψ⟩ = ħ² * diag(1, 0, 1) * (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2)ᵀ = ħ² * (-1/2, 0, -1/2)ᵀ = (-ħ²/2, 0, -ħ²/2)ᵀ. Now we compute the inner product ⟨ψ|Pz²|ψ⟩ = (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2) * (-ħ²/2, 0, -ħ²/2)ᵀ = (-1/2)(-ħ²/2) + (1/√2)(0) + (-1/2)(-ħ²/2) = (ħ²/4) + 0 + (ħ²/4) = (ħ²/2). Therefore, ⟨Pz²⟩ = ħ²/2. Now we can calculate the uncertainty: ΔPz = sqrt(⟨Pz²⟩ - ⟨Pz⟩²) = sqrt(ħ²/2 - 0) = sqrt(ħ²/2) = ħ/√2. This matches with choice C) which is ħ/√2.
