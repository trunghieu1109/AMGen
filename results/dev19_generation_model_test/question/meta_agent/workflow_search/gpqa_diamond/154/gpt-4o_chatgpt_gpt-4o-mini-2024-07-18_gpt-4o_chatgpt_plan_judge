Question: Example(question='Imagine an operator $\\vec{P}$ of a system have components $P_x, P_y$ and $P_z$. The matrix form of the  operator $P_x$ has components in the first row as $(0, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,\\hbar/\\sqrt{2},0)$.  The matrix form of the  operator $P_y$ has components in the first row as $(0, -i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0, -i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2},0)$. Similarly, matrix form of the  operator $P_z$ has components in the first row as $(\\hbar, 0, 0)$, that in the second row as $(0, 0, 0)$ and that in the third row as $(0,0, -\\hbar)$. The basis vectors here are the eigenvectors of $P_z$. The system is found in the eigenstate of $P_x$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$. To be more specific, the explicit form of the state of the system is given by the column vector having elements $(-1/2, 1/\\sqrt{2}, -1/2)$. What is the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z $ of $P_z$', choice1='\\hbar\n', choice2='\\hbar/2', choice3='\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}\n', choice4='\\sqrt{2}\\hbar', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: To determine the uncertainty \Delta P_z of the operator P_z when the system is in the eigenstate of P_x, we analyze the provided state vector \psi = \begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \ 1/\sqrt{2} \ -1/2 \end{pmatrix}. The eigenvalues of the operator P_z are known to be \hbar, 0, and -\hbar. We calculate the probabilities of measuring these eigenvalues by projecting the state vector onto the eigenstates of P_z. The calculations yield the probabilities: P(\hbar) = |(-1/2)|^2 = 1/4, P(0) = |(1/\sqrt{2})|^2 = 1/2, and P(-\hbar) = |(-1/2)|^2 = 1/4. Next, we compute the expectation value \langle P_z \rangle = \hbar(1/4) + 0(1/2) - \hbar(1/4) = 0. For \langle P_z^2 \rangle, we find \langle P_z^2 \rangle = \hbar^2(1/4) + 0 + \hbar^2(1/4) = \hbar^2/2. Finally, we calculate the uncertainty using the formula \Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2} = \sqrt{\hbar^2/2 - 0^2} = \sqrt{\hbar^2/2} = \hbar/\sqrt{2}. This matches with choice C) \hbar/\sqrt{2}, confirming that the calculations are consistent with quantum mechanics principles regarding the uncertainty of observables in a given state. Therefore, the most consistent and correct answer is C.
