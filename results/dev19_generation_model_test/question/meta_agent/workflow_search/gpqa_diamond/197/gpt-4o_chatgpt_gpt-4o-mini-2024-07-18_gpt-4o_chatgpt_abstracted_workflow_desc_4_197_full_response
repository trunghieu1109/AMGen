The cobalt(II) ions (Co^2+) can form several complexes with thiocyanate (SCN^-), and the stability constants (β1, β2, β3, β4) indicate the strength of these complexes. The first complex formed is [Co(SCN)]+, followed by [Co(SCN)2], [Co(SCN)3], and [Co(SCN)4]2-. The equilibrium expressions for these complexes can be written as follows: \n\n1.

The cobalt concentration is given as c(Co) = 10^-2 M, indicating a relatively low concentration of cobalt compared to the thiocyanate concentration of 0.1 M. This high concentration of SCN- suggests that it will be in excess, driving the formation of complexes.

We will set up a system of equations based on the stability constants and the initial concentrations, and solve these equations to find the equilibrium concentrations of each complex. The percentage of the dithiocyanato complex [Co(SCN)2] will then be calculated by dividing its concentration by the total cobalt concentration. This requires careful consideration of all species and their interactions, ensuring that we account for the total cobalt concentration and the distribution of cobalt among the different complexes. After performing the calculations, the resulting percentage will determine which of the provided choices is correct.; answer: A\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent M076, round 0, calculating concentrations, thinking: To calculate the concentration of each cobalt(II) thiocyanato complex, we start with the initial concentrations: Co^2+ = 10^-2 M and SCN^- = 0.1 M. The cobalt ions can form complexes with thiocyanate ions according to the provided stability constants. We need to set up equilibrium expressions for the formation of each complex: [Co(SCN)]+, [Co(SCN)2], [Co(SCN)3], and [Co(SCN)4]2-. The stability constants indicate that each subsequent complex is more stable than the previous one. We can express the concentrations of each complex in terms of the initial concentrations and the changes that occur as equilibrium is reached. The total concentration of cobalt must equal the sum of the free Co^2+ ions and all the complexes formed. By solving the system of equations derived from the equilibrium expressions, we can find the concentrations of each complex. Finally, to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex [Co(SCN)2], we will divide its concentration by the total concentration of cobalt species and multiply by 100. This thorough approach ensures all possible interactions and complex formations are accounted for, leading to an accurate calculation of the desired percentage.; answer: A', iteration_idx=-1)]
