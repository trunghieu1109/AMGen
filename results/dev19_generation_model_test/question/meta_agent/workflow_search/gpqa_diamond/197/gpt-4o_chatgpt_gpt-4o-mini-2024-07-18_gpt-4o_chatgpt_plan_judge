Question: Example(question='We have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate, where the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M and the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16. What will be the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species in the solution? ', choice1='16.9%', choice2='42.3%', choice3='25.6%', choice4='38.1%', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: To calculate the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes, we need to first establish the equilibrium concentrations of all cobalt thiocyanato complexes based on the provided stability constants and initial concentrations. The cobalt(II) ions (Co^2+) can form complexes with thiocyanate ions (SCN^-), leading to the formation of [Co(SCN)]+, [Co(SCN)2], [Co(SCN)3], and [Co(SCN)4]2-. The stability constants indicate the relative stability of these complexes, which will determine their concentrations at equilibrium. We will set up the equilibrium expressions based on the stability constants and the initial concentrations of cobalt and thiocyanate. After calculating the concentrations of each complex, we will find the concentration of the dithiocyanato complex and express it as a percentage of the total cobalt species in the solution. This requires careful numerical calculations to ensure accuracy in the final percentage. Given the previous answers and the calculations involved, the most consistent answer appears to be A) 16.9%.
