Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Final Decision Agent 1L2E', content='To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex (Co(SCN)₂) among all cobalt species, we start with the total cobalt concentration, [Co]total = 1.0 x 10^-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration, [SCN–] = 0.1 M. We denote the concentration of free Co(II) ions as x.

The formation of complexes occurs through stepwise reactions where Co²⁺ reacts with SCN⁻ to form various complexes based on the provided stability constants. The first reaction forms the monothiocyanato complex CoSCN⁺, followed by the formation of the dithiocyanato complex Co(SCN)₂, trithiocyanato complex Co(SCN)₃⁻, and finally the tetrathiocyanato complex Co(SCN)₄²⁻. The stability constants β₁, β₂, β₃, and β₄ indicate the favorability of these reactions.

The mass balance for cobalt can be expressed as: [Co]total = [Co²⁺] + [CoSCN⁺] + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃⁻] + [Co(SCN)₄²⁻]. This equation accounts for all cobalt species present in the solution. The mass balance for thiocyanate can also be considered, but since SCN⁻ is in large excess, the free concentration will not change significantly. Thus, we focus on the cobalt mass balance to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex among all cobalt species. The calculations will involve substituting the equilibrium expressions into the mass balance equation and solving for the concentrations of the complexes formed, particularly Co(SCN)₂, to find its percentage relative to the total cobalt concentration.; answer: A\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent DCUA, thinking: To formulate equilibrium expressions for each complex formed by Co(II) ions and thiocyanate, we start with the provided stability constants, which indicate the stepwise formation of complexes. For each step, we can write the equilibrium expressions based on the reactions. The first complex, CoSCN⁺, forms from Co²⁺ and SCN⁻ with stability constant β₁ = 9. The equilibrium expression is [CoSCN⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]. For the second complex, Co(SCN)₂, which forms from Co²⁺ and 2 SCN⁻ with stability constant β₂ = 40, the equilibrium expression is [Co(SCN)₂] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]². For the third complex, Co(SCN)₃⁻, which forms from Co²⁺ and 3 SCN⁻ with stability constant β₃ = 63, the equilibrium expression is [Co(SCN)₃⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³. Finally, for the fourth complex, Co(SCN)₄²⁻, which forms from Co²⁺ and 4 SCN⁻ with stability constant β₄ = 16, the equilibrium expression is [Co(SCN)₄²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴. To write the mass-balance equations, we consider the total concentration of cobalt and the initial concentration of thiocyanate. The mass balance on cobalt can be expressed as [Co]total = [Co²⁺] + [CoSCN⁺] + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃⁻] + [Co(SCN)₄²⁻]. The mass balance on thiocyanate can be expressed as [SCN⁻]initial = [SCN⁻]free + [CoSCN⁺] + 2[Co(SCN)₂] + 3[Co(SCN)₃⁻] + 4[Co(SCN)₄²⁻].

For each complex formation reaction, we can write the equilibrium expression in terms of the concentrations of the reactants and products. The reactions and their corresponding equilibrium constants (K) are as follows: 1. Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ CoSCN⁺, K1 = β₁ = 9, so [CoSCN⁺] = K1[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]; 2. Co²⁺ + 2 SCN⁻ ⇌ Co(SCN)₂, K2 = β₂ = 40, so [Co(SCN)₂] = K2[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²; 3. Co²⁺ + 3 SCN⁻ ⇌ Co(SCN)₃⁻, K3 = β₃ = 63, so [Co(SCN)₃⁻] = K3[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³; 4. Co²⁺ + 4 SCN⁻ ⇌ Co(SCN)₄²⁻, K4 = β₄ = 16, so [Co(SCN)₄²⁻] = K4[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴. Next, we need to write the mass-balance equations for cobalt and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is given by the sum of all cobalt species: [Co]total = [Co²⁺] + [CoSCN⁺] + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃⁻] + [Co(SCN)₄²⁻]. The mass balance for thiocyanate can also be considered, but since it is in large excess, it is often approximated that [SCN⁻]free remains approximately constant at 0.1 M. Thus, we can express the total cobalt concentration in terms of the equilibrium expressions derived above, allowing us to solve for the concentrations of each species at equilibrium. This systematic approach ensures that all possible species and their interactions are accounted for, leading to an accurate understanding of the cobalt-thiocyanato complex formation.; answer: A\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent KXgW, thinking: To solve the system of equilibrium and mass-balance equations for the cobalt-thiocyanato complexes, we start with the total cobalt concentration, which is given as [Co]total = 1.0 x 10^-2 M. We need to express the concentrations of each cobalt species in terms of the cobalt concentration and the thiocyanate concentration. The equilibrium expressions for the formation of the complexes are: [CoSCN⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻], [Co(SCN)₂] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]², [Co(SCN)₃⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³, and [Co(SCN)₄²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴. We also have the mass balance for cobalt, which states that [Co]total = [Co²⁺] + [CoSCN⁺] + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃⁻] + [Co(SCN)₄²⁻]. Given that [SCN⁻] is in large excess, we can assume its concentration remains approximately constant at 0.1 M, simplifying our calculations. We can substitute the equilibrium expressions into the cobalt mass balance equation to express everything in terms of [Co²⁺] and the known concentration of thiocyanate. After substituting and simplifying, we can solve for [Co(SCN)₂] and find its percentage relative to the total cobalt concentration. By following this systematic approach, we can accurately determine the concentration of the dithiocyanato complex and its percentage among all cobalt species in the solution.; answer: A\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent Dp4c, thinking: To solve the system of equilibrium and mass-balance equations, we start with the known total cobalt concentration [Co]total = 10^-2 M and the thiocyanate concentration [SCN-] = 0.1 M. We will use the stability constants provided to express the concentrations of each cobalt-thiocyanato complex formed. The equilibrium expressions for the complexes are: [CoSCN+] = β₁[Co²+][SCN-], [Co(SCN)₂] = β₂[Co²+][SCN-]², [Co(SCN)₃⁻] = β₃[Co²+][SCN-]³, and [Co(SCN)₄²⁻] = β₄[Co²+][SCN-]⁴. We can denote [Co²+] as x, then the concentrations of the complexes can be expressed in terms of x and the SCN- concentration. The mass balance for cobalt gives us the equation: [Co]total = x + β₁x[SCN-] + β₂x[SCN-]² + β₃x[SCN-]³ + β₄x[SCN-]⁴. Substituting the values for β and [SCN-] allows us to derive a polynomial equation in x. Once we solve for x, we can calculate the concentration of Co(SCN)₂ and subsequently determine its percentage among all cobalt species.

Given the stability constants, we can set up the following equations based on the reactions: 1) Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ CoSCN⁺ (β₁ = 9), 2) Co²⁺ + 2 SCN⁻ ⇌ Co(SCN)₂ (β₂ = 40), 3) Co²⁺ + 3 SCN⁻ ⇌ Co(SCN)₃⁻ (β₃ = 63), and 4) Co²⁺ + 4 SCN⁻ ⇌ Co(SCN)₄²⁻ (β₄ = 16). We can express the concentrations of each complex in terms of the total cobalt concentration [Co]total and the free thiocyanate concentration [SCN–]. The mass balance for cobalt can be written as: [Co]total = [Co²⁺] + [CoSCN⁺] + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃⁻] + [Co(SCN)₄²⁻]. Using the stability constants, we can substitute the expressions for each complex into this equation. The concentration of the dithiocyanato complex Co(SCN)₂ can be expressed as [Co(SCN)₂] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN–]². Given the initial conditions, we can solve for the concentrations iteratively, starting with the assumption of a certain concentration of Co²⁺ and calculating the resulting concentrations of each complex using the stability constants. This process will allow us to find the percentage of Co(SCN)₂ relative to the total cobalt concentration. The iterative calculations will account for the fact that as more complexes form, the free Co²⁺ concentration decreases, which in turn affects the formation of the other complexes. After calculating the concentrations, we can find the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex by dividing [Co(SCN)₂] by [Co]total and multiplying by 100%. This thorough approach ensures that we consider all relevant interactions and concentrations, leading to an accurate determination of the desired percentage.; answer: A\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent B44K, round 0, thinking: To calculate the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex Co(SCN)₂ among all cobalt species, we start by applying the stability constants provided for the formation of the cobalt-thiocyanate complexes.

The mass balance equation for cobalt can be set up as: [Co]total = x + β₁ * x * [SCN⁻] + β₂ * x * [SCN⁻]² + β₃ * x * [SCN⁻]³ + β₄ * x * [SCN⁻]⁴. Substituting the values for β and [SCN⁻] allows us to derive a polynomial equation in x. Solving for x gives us the concentration of free Co(II) ions, which we can then use to calculate the concentration of the dithiocyanato complex. Once we have the concentration of Co(SCN)₂, we can find its percentage of the total cobalt species using the formula: (concentration of Co(SCN)₂ / [Co]total) * 100. After performing these calculations systematically, we find that the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex is most consistent with choice A, which is 16.9%.
