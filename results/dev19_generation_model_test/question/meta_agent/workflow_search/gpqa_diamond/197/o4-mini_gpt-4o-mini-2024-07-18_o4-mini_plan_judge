Question: Example(question='We have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate, where the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M and the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16. What will be the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species in the solution?

proposed answer: To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex (Co(SCN)₂) among all cobalt species, we start with the total cobalt concentration, [Co]total = 1.0 x 10^-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration, [SCN–] = 0.1 M. We denote the concentration of free Co(II) ions as x. The formation of the complexes can be expressed using the stability constants: [CoSCN⁺] = β₁ * x * [SCN–], [Co(SCN)₂] = β₂ * x * [SCN–]², [Co(SCN)₃⁻] = β₃ * x * [SCN–]³, and [Co(SCN)₄²⁻] = β₄ * x * [SCN–]⁴. The mass balance for cobalt gives us the equation: [Co]total = x + β₁ * x * [SCN–] + β₂ * x * [SCN–]² + β₃ * x * [SCN–]³ + β₄ * x * [SCN–]⁴. Substituting the values for β and [SCN–] allows us to derive a polynomial equation in x. After solving for x, we can calculate the concentration of Co(SCN)₂ and find its percentage relative to the total cobalt concentration using the formula: (concentration of Co(SCN)₂ / [Co]total) * 100. Given the calculations performed and the stability constants, the percentage calculated aligns with the provided option A, which is 16.9%. This conclusion is reached by ensuring that all cobalt species and their interactions are accurately accounted for, leading to a reliable estimate of the cobalt species distribution in solution.
