Question: Example(question='We would like to dissolve (at 25°С) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm3 total volume. What is the minimum volume (cm3) of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution and what is the pH of the resulting solution?', choice1='pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3', choice2='pH 2.69; 30.09 cm3', choice3='pH 3.16; 32.14 cm3', choice4='pH 4.94; 20.40 cm3', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: To determine the pH and confirm the required volume of acid, we first calculated the moles of Fe(OH)3 from its mass. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is approximately 106.87 g/mol, leading to about 0.000935 moles of Fe(OH)3. Since the dissolution reaction requires 3 moles of H+ for each mole of Fe(OH)3, we need 0.002805 moles of H+. With a 0.1 M acid, the volume needed is 28.05 cm3. This matches the first choice, which states a pH of 2.04. However, we must consider the final volume of the solution after adding the acid. The total volume after adding 28.05 cm3 of acid to 100 cm3 will be 128.05 cm3. The concentration of H+ ions after dilution must be recalculated: [H+] = moles of H+ / total volume = 0.002805 moles / 0.12805 L = 0.0219 M. The pH is then calculated as pH = -log(0.0219) ≈ 1.66, which does not match the first choice. Therefore, we need to check the other options. The second choice states a pH of 2.69 and a volume of 30.09 cm3. Repeating the calculation for 30.09 cm3 of acid gives us a new total volume of 130.09 cm3 and a new [H+] concentration. This process must be repeated for each choice to find the correct pH and volume combination. Given the dilution effect, the first choice is likely incorrect, and we must find the correct pair that matches both the volume and pH accurately.
