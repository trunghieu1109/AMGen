Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_14_162
proposed answer: To determine the correct choice, we need to analyze the dissolution of Fe(OH)3 and the required volume of a strong acid to neutralize the hydroxide ions produced. Fe(OH)3 is sparingly soluble, and when dissolved, it produces OH- ions. The mass of Fe(OH)3 given is 0.1 g, which corresponds to approximately 0.002802 moles of OH- ions. To neutralize these OH- ions, we need an equivalent amount of H+ ions from the strong acid. A 0.1 M strong acid provides 0.1 moles of H+ per liter, so 28.05 cm3 of this acid provides approximately 0.002805 moles of H+. After neutralization, there will be a slight excess of H+ ions, leading to a very low concentration of excess H+ in the solution. The total volume after adding the acid is about 128.05 cm3. The resulting pH is influenced by both the excess H+ from the acid and the hydrolysis of Fe3+ ions. Given the choices, the pH of 2.04 aligns with the expected strong acidity of the solution, making it the most consistent answer. Therefore, the correct choice is A) 28.05 cm3 and pH 2.04.

proposed answer: To determine the correct choice, we need to analyze the calculated volume of acid and the resulting pH based on the dissolution of Fe(OH)3. From previous calculations, we found that to neutralize the OH- ions produced from 0.1 g of Fe(OH)3, approximately 28.05 cm³ of 0.1 M strong acid is required. This aligns with the first choice, which states 'pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³'. The pH of 2.04 is consistent with the expected acidity of the solution after the acid has neutralized the OH- ions and considering the hydrolysis of Fe³⁺ ions. The other choices present different volumes and pH values that do not match our calculations. Therefore, the correct answer is choice 1, as it accurately reflects both the volume of acid needed and the resulting pH of the solution. However, it is important to note that the pH value of 2.04 may not fully account for the hydrolysis of Fe³⁺ ions, which can affect the final pH. Despite this, based on the calculations provided, choice 1 remains the most consistent with the required volume of acid and the expected pH range for such a solution.
