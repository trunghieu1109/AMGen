proposed answer: In the original decay process 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V, we have four final state particles: two E particles and two V particles. The presence of these four particles allows for a broad and continuous distribution of energy among the outgoing E particles, as energy can be shared in many ways among the four particles. The endpoint Q represents the maximum total energy that can be carried by the two E particles when the other particles (2B and 2V) are accounted for. When we switch to the variant decay 2A -> 2B + 2E + M, we replace the two V particles with a single massless particle M, reducing the number of final state particles from four to three (2E and M). This change alters the phase space available for the decay products. The massless particle M does not contribute to the energy in the same way as the two V particles would have, which can lead to a decrease in the maximum energy that can be shared among the E particles. Since the two V particles had some mass, their removal and replacement with a massless particle likely reduces the total energy available to be distributed among the remaining particles. Therefore, the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles remains continuous, but the maximum energy (endpoint) decreases due to the change in the number of final state particles and their contributions to energy balance. Thus, the endpoint decreases relative to Q.

proposed answer: In the original decay process (2A → 2B + 2E + 2V), the presence of four final state particles allows for a continuous distribution of energy among the emitted particles due to the conservation of energy and momentum. When we replace the two V particles with a single massless particle M (in the variant decay 2A → 2B + 2E + M), we change the number of final state particles from four to three (two E and one M). This reduction in the number of final state particles affects the phase-space available for the decay products. However, since we still have two emitted E particles and one massless particle M, the system still allows for continuous energy distributions. The energy of the massless particle M does not contribute to the mass-energy balance in the same way as the V particles would, but it still carries momentum. The overall energy still needs to be conserved, and the fact that we have two emitted E particles means that the energy spectrum can remain continuous. The endpoint of this energy spectrum may shift due to the change in dynamics and conservation laws, but the continuity of the spectrum should be preserved. The removal of the two V particles and the introduction of the massless particle M allows for more energy to be allocated to the E particles, leading to an increase in the endpoint. Therefore, the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles remains continuous, with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases. Thus, the correct answer is C.
