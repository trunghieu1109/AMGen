proposed answer: To determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product formed from the reaction of 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid with red phosphorus and excess HI, we first need to analyze the structure of the starting material. The compound contains an aldehyde group (formyl), a vinyl group, and a carboxylic acid group. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI typically leads to the reduction of the aldehyde to a primary alcohol and the carboxylic acid to an alcohol as well. The vinyl group is likely to remain intact unless subjected to further reduction. The IHD is calculated based on the number of rings and multiple bonds in the molecule. The original compound has an IHD due to the presence of double bonds and possibly a ring. However, after the reductions, we expect the product to be a saturated alcohol, which typically has an IHD of 0 since it contains no rings or double bonds. Therefore, after considering the structural changes from the reaction, it is reasonable to conclude that the IHD of the product will be 0. This aligns with the available answer choices, where the most logical choice is C, indicating an IHD of 0.

proposed answer: The reaction of 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid with red phosphorus and excess HI leads to the reduction of the aldehyde and carboxylic acid functional groups. The aldehyde is reduced to a primary alcohol, and the carboxylic acid may undergo decarboxylation, resulting in the loss of a carbon dioxide molecule. The vinyl group and the cyclohexene ring remain stable under these conditions. The index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) is calculated based on the number of rings and multiple bonds in the product. Since the reaction conditions suggest a reduction and potential loss of unsaturation, the IHD of the product is expected to be lower than that of the starting material. After considering the transformations, the product may have an IHD of 0, indicating that it is fully saturated. Therefore, the correct answer reflecting the accurate IHD derived from the product structure is 0.
