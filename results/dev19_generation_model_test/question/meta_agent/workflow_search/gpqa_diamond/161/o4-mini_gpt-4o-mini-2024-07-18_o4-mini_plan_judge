proposed answer: To determine the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2 under the given metric, we analyze the metric expression ds^2 = (32/(4 - x^2 - y^2))(dx^2 + dy^2). This metric is defined in the region where x^2 + y^2 < 4, indicating that the boundary at x^2 + y^2 = 4 is a singularity. As we approach this boundary, the area element derived from the metric diverges, leading to an infinite area. When integrating the area element from r = 0 to r = 2 and θ from 0 to 2π, the singularity at the boundary causes the area to diverge to infinity. Therefore, the most consistent answer for the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2 is +∞, which corresponds to choice A. The other choices provided do not match this conclusion, as they suggest finite areas or different forms that do not apply to the singular nature of the metric at the boundary. Hence, the most appropriate answer is +∞, corresponding to choice A.
