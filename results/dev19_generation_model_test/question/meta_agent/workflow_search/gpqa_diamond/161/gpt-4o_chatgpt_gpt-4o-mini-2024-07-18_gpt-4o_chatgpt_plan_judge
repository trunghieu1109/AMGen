proposed answer: The metric given describes a pseudosphere, which is a surface of constant negative curvature. The area of a pseudosphere is known to be infinite due to its unbounded nature. The radius provided (r=2) corresponds to a boundary defined by the equation x^2 + y^2 = 4, which is a circle of radius 2. As we approach this boundary, the metric becomes singular, indicating that the area is unbounded. The choices provided include one that suggests infinite area (+∞), which aligns with the properties of a pseudosphere. The other choices suggest finite areas, which do not correspond to the nature of the surface described by the metric. Therefore, the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2 is indeed +∞, making the correct answer A).
