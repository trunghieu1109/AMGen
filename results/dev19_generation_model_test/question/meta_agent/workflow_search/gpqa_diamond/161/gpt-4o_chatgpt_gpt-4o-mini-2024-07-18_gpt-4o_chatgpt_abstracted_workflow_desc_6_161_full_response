The area of a pseudosphere is known to be infinite because it extends indefinitely in certain directions. Given the radius r=2, we can interpret this as defining a boundary in the x-y plane, specifically the circle described by x^2 + y^2 = 4.

The denominator 4 - x^2 - y^2 suggests a constraint that defines a boundary, specifically a circle of radius 2 in the x-y plane (since 4 = 2^2). This means that the metric becomes undefined (or singular) when x^2 + y^2 approaches 4, indicating a limit to the area that can be covered. The nature of the pseudosphere is that it has constant negative curvature, which typically leads to infinite area due to its hyperbolic nature. The area of a pseudosphere is generally considered to be infinite because as one approaches the boundary defined by the metric, the surface expands without bound. Thus, the relationship between the metric, the boundary constraint, and the nature of the pseudosphere leads to the conclusion that the area is indeed +∞, as this reflects the typical behavior of hyperbolic surfaces.
