proposed answer: To find the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator H = ε σ·n, we first analyze the operator σ·n, which is a linear combination of the Pauli matrices weighted by the components of the unit vector n. The Pauli matrices have the property that their eigenvalues are ±1. Since σ·n is a projection operator along the direction of n, its eigenvalues are also ±1. When we multiply these eigenvalues by the constant ε, which has the dimension of energy, we obtain the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian H. Therefore, the eigenvalues of H are ±ε. Among the provided choices, the first option, +ε and -ε, matches our derived eigenvalues. The other options introduce factors of ħ or do not correspond to the correct dimensional analysis. Thus, the correct answer is A.
