proposed answer: To find the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator H = ε σ·n, we start by recognizing that σ represents the Pauli spin matrices, which have eigenvalues of ±1. The Hamiltonian is a linear combination of these matrices scaled by the constant ε, which has the dimension of energy. The unit vector n defines the direction of the spin but does not change the eigenvalues themselves, as they are determined by the properties of the Pauli matrices. Therefore, when we scale the eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices (±1) by ε, we obtain the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator as ±ε. This matches with choice A, which states the eigenvalues are +ε and -ε. The other choices involve factors of ħ or different constants, which do not apply here. Thus, the correct answer is A.
