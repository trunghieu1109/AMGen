The term σ·n denotes the dot product of the Pauli matrices with the unit vector n, which can be expressed as σ·n = σ_x n_x + σ_y n_y + σ_z n_z. The Pauli matrices are 2x2 Hermitian matrices that represent the spin operators for a spin-1/2 particle. Since n is a unit vector, it satisfies the condition ||n|| = 1. The eigenvalues of the operator σ·n are known to be ±1, which indicates the possible outcomes of measuring the spin projection along the direction defined by n. Therefore, when we multiply these eigenvalues by the constant ε, we obtain the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian H, which are ±ε. This reasoning leads us to conclude that the eigenvalues of H are directly related to the eigenvalues of the operator σ·n, scaled by the factor ε. The other choices provided in the question introduce unnecessary factors or dimensions that do not align with the derived eigenvalues from the Hamiltonian, confirming that the correct eigenvalues are indeed ±ε.; answer: A\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent 8J1M, thinking: The Hamiltonian H is expressed as ε σ·n, where σ represents the Pauli matrices, which are 2x2 Hermitian matrices that describe spin-1/2 systems in quantum mechanics. The vector n is a unit vector, meaning it has a magnitude of 1, and it determines the direction of the spin projection. The term σ·n indicates the dot product between the vector of Pauli matrices and the unit vector n, which results in a linear combination of the Pauli matrices weighted by the components of n. This construction is essential in quantum mechanics as it allows for the description of spin interactions in a specified direction. The eigenvalues of the operator σ·n are ±1, which are dimensionless, and when multiplied by the constant ε (which has units of energy), the resulting eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian H become ±ε. This step-by-step reasoning confirms that the eigenvalues are directly related to the properties of the Pauli matrices and the nature of the Hamiltonian operator defined in the problem. Thus, the correct eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator are indeed ±ε, which corresponds to the first choice provided in the multiple-choice options.; answer: A\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent 3R01, thinking: To show that (σ·n)^2 = I, we start with the definition of the operator σ·n, which is given by σ·n = σ_x n_x + σ_y n_y + σ_z n_z. Here, σ_x, σ_y, and σ_z are the Pauli matrices and n_x, n_y, n_z are the components of the unit vector n. The Pauli matrices satisfy the relation σ_i σ_j = δ_{ij} I + i ε_{ijk} σ_k, where I is the identity matrix, δ_{ij} is the Kronecker delta, and ε_{ijk} is the Levi-Civita symbol. Since n is a unit vector, we have n·n = 1. Now, when we compute (σ·n)^2, we have:\n\n(σ·n)^2 = (σ_x n_x + σ_y n_y + σ_z n_z)(σ_x n_x + σ_y n_y + σ_z n_z).\n\nExpanding this product, we get:\n\n(σ·n)^2 = σ_x^2 n_x^2 + σ_y^2 n_y^2 + σ_z^2 n_z^2 + \text{cross terms}.\n\nUsing the property of Pauli matrices, we know that σ_i^2 = I for each i, thus:\n\n= n_x^2 I + n_y^2 I + n_z^2 I + \text{cross terms}.\n\nThe cross terms involve products like σ_x σ_y n_x n_y, which can be simplified using the Pauli matrix relations. After considering the cross terms, we find that they sum up to zero due to the antisymmetry of the Pauli matrices (the terms cancel out because of the properties of the Levi-Civita symbol). Thus, we are left with:\n\n= (n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2) I = I,\n\nsince n is a unit vector and n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1. Hence, we have shown that (σ·n)^2 = I.\n\nNext, to find the eigenvalues of σ·n, we note that since (σ·n)^2 = I, the eigenvalues of σ·n must satisfy λ^2 = 1, leading to λ = ±1. Therefore, the eigenvalues of σ·n are ±1. Finally, since the Hamiltonian is given by H = ε σ·n, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are obtained by multiplying the eigenvalues of σ·n by ε, resulting in eigenvalues of ±ε. The correct answer reflecting these eigenvalues is therefore the first choice: +ε, -ε.; answer: A\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent XTai, thinking: To show that (σ·n)^2 = I, we start with the expression σ·n = σ_x n_x + σ_y n_y + σ_z n_z, where σ_x, σ_y, and σ_z are the Pauli matrices and n_x, n_y, n_z are the components of the unit vector n. The Pauli matrices satisfy the relation σ_i σ_j = δ_{ij} I + i ε_{ijk} σ_k, where δ_{ij} is the Kronecker delta and ε_{ijk} is the Levi-Civita symbol. Since n is a unit vector, we have n·n = 1, which implies that the square of the operator σ·n can be calculated as follows: (σ·n)(σ·n) = (σ_x n_x + σ_y n_y + σ_z n_z)(σ_x n_x + σ_y n_y + σ_z n_z). Expanding this product and using the properties of the Pauli matrices, we find that the terms involving σ_i σ_j where i ≠ j yield zero due to the orthogonality of the Pauli matrices, while the diagonal terms yield n_x^2 I + n_y^2 I + n_z^2 I = (n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2) I = I, since n is a unit vector. Thus, we conclude that (σ·n)^2 = I. The eigenvalues of σ·n are found by solving the characteristic equation, leading to eigenvalues ±1. Therefore, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian H = ε(σ·n) are ±ε, confirming the correctness of the answer choice A.; answer: A\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent mJah, thinking: To show that (σ·n)^2 = I, we start with the definition of the dot product of the Pauli matrices and the unit vector n. The operator σ·n can be expressed as σ·n = σ_x n_x + σ_y n_y + σ_z n_z, where n_x, n_y, and n_z are the components of the unit vector n. The Pauli matrices satisfy the algebraic relation σ_i σ_j = δ_{ij}I + iε_{ijk}σ_k, where δ_{ij} is the Kronecker delta and ε_{ijk} is the Levi-Civita symbol. Since n is a unit vector, we have n·n = 1. Now, when we compute (σ·n)^2, we get: (σ·n)(σ·n) = (σ_x n_x + σ_y n_y + σ_z n_z)(σ_x n_x + σ_y n_y + σ_z n_z). Expanding this product yields terms that combine the Pauli matrices, which can be simplified using the algebraic relations. Specifically, we find that the terms involving σ_i σ_j contribute to the identity operator I due to the orthogonality of the Pauli matrices. The resulting expression simplifies to I, confirming that (σ·n)^2 = I. Consequently, since the eigenvalues of (σ·n) are ±1, when we multiply these eigenvalues by the constant ε in the Hamiltonian H = ε σ·n, we obtain the eigenvalues of H as ±ε. Thus, the eigenvalues of σ·n are indeed ±1, confirming that the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator are ±ε, which corresponds to the first choice in the multiple-choice options.; answer: A\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent KRXk, thinking: To find the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator H = ε σ·n, we first analyze the operator σ·n, which is a linear combination of the Pauli matrices weighted by the components of the unit vector n.
