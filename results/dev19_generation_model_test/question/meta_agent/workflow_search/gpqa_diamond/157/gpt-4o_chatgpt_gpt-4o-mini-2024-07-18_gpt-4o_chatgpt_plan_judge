Question: Example(question='In an inactive state, a transcription factor subunit awaits an activation signal from the membrane phosphorylation cascade. Upon phosphorylation on the Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, shuttles into the nucleus, and serves in gene transcription. A missense mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. You observe that a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Which of the following molecular phenotypes is most likely observed in the presence of mutation Y?', choice1='loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype', choice2='protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype', choice3='protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele', choice4='change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: The transcription factor subunit requires dimerization to function properly in gene transcription. Mutation Y is a dominant-negative mutation in the dimerization domain, which means it can interfere with the normal dimerization process even when only one copy of the mutation is present. This interference can prevent the wild-type subunit from forming a functional dimer, leading to a loss of transcriptional activity. In the presence of mutation Y, the wild-type allele cannot compensate for the disrupted dimerization, resulting in a loss of function. Therefore, the most likely molecular phenotype observed with mutation Y is a loss of protein dimerization and a consequent loss-of-function phenotype, as the transcription factor cannot effectively carry out its role in gene transcription due to the inability to form functional dimers. This aligns with the typical behavior of dominant-negative mutations, which often lead to a loss of function by disrupting normal protein interactions. Thus, the correct choice is A) loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype, as it accurately reflects the consequences of the dominant-negative mutation Y.

proposed answer: Mutation Y is a dominant-negative mutation in the dimerization domain of a transcription factor, which means it disrupts the ability of the transcription factor to form functional dimers. This interference can lead to a loss-of-function phenotype because the transcription factor cannot effectively dimerize and perform its role in gene transcription. The presence of mutation Y may also cause protein aggregation, as the mutated protein could misfold or interact improperly with the wild-type protein, further reducing functional protein levels. Therefore, the most likely molecular phenotype observed in the presence of mutation Y is protein aggregation and a loss-of-function phenotype, which aligns with the characteristics of dominant-negative mutations. The other options do not accurately reflect the expected outcome of a dominant-negative mutation affecting dimerization, as they either suggest a wild-type phenotype or a gain-of-function, which contradicts the expected loss of function due to the dominant-negative effect.
