proposed answer: To determine which particle is not associated with spontaneously broken symmetry, we analyze each option based on their definitions and roles in the context of symmetry breaking. 1. **Magnon**: Magnons arise from spin-wave excitations in a magnetic system where spin-rotational symmetry is broken, categorizing them as a true Goldstone mode. 2. **Skyrmion**: Skyrmions are stable topological solitons that exist in a context of broken symmetries but do not arise as Goldstone modes from spontaneous symmetry breaking. They represent topological defects rather than excitations, thus categorizing them as a topological soliton. 3. **Pion**: Pions are pseudo-Goldstone bosons that emerge from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics (QCD), thus they are associated with broken symmetry. 4. **Phonon**: Phonons correspond to lattice vibrations in a crystal and are associated with broken translational symmetry, making them also a true Goldstone mode. Given this analysis, the Skyrmion stands out as it is not a Goldstone mode and does not arise from spontaneous symmetry breaking in the same manner as the other particles. Therefore, the particle that is not associated with any spontaneously broken symmetry is the Skyrmion.
