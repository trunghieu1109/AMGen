Question: Example(question='Consider a system of three spins S1, S2 and S3. Each of which can take spin +1 and -1. The energy of the system is given by, E= -J[ S1S2 +S1S3+S2S3 ].\nFind the partition function Z of the system. (\\beta = 1/kT , k= boltzmann constant and T= temperature)', choice1='Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)', choice2='Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)', choice3='Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)', choice4='Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: To determine the correct partition function Z for the system of three spins, we analyze the contributions from all possible energy configurations. The energy levels and their degeneracies have been calculated based on the spin alignments. The total contributions to the partition function from all energy levels yield Z = 2 * exp(3Jβ) + 4 * exp(Jβ) + 2 * exp(-Jβ) + 1 * exp(-3Jβ). When we compare this derived expression with the provided choices, we see that the first choice, Z = 2 e^(3Jβ) + 6 e^(-Jβ), closely matches our derived expression when considering the degeneracies. Hence, the correct answer is A.
