The energy of the system is given by E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3], which indicates that the energy depends on the pairwise interactions between the spins. The term S1S2 contributes to the energy based on whether spins S1 and S2 are aligned (both +1 or both -1) or anti-aligned (one +1 and the other -1).

The partition function is calculated as Z = sum(e^(-βE)), where β = 1/(kT). Each configuration contributes to the partition function based on its energy, thus the role of beta is crucial as it weights the contributions of each energy state exponentially. The configurations with lower energy will have a higher contribution to Z due to the negative exponent in the exponential term. Therefore, the partition function will reflect the statistical weight of each configuration based on its energy, influenced by the interactions between spins and the temperature through beta.

The energy of the system, given by E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3], indicates that the energy is determined by the interactions between each pair of spins. The term S1S2 represents the interaction energy between spins S1 and S2, and similarly for the other pairs. Since each spin can be in one of two states, we can enumerate all possible configurations of the three spins, leading to a total of 2^3 = 8 configurations: (+1, +1, +1), (+1, +1, -1), (+1, -1, +1), (+1, -1, -1), (-1, +1, +1), (-1, +1, -1), (-1, -1, +1), and (-1, -1, -1). Each configuration will yield a different energy value based on the formula provided. The partition function Z is calculated by summing the contributions of all configurations, which are weighted by the factor e^(-βE), where β = 1/(kT). This means that configurations with lower energy will contribute more significantly to the partition function than those with higher energy, highlighting the importance of the interactions between spins in determining the statistical properties of the system. Therefore, the parameter β plays a crucial role in determining how the energy states contribute to the overall partition function, affecting the thermodynamic behavior of the system as temperature changes.
