Extract and Summarize Given Information:\n   - We have three spin variables S₁, S₂, S₃, each taking values +1 or –1.\n   - The energy (Hamiltonian) of the system is\n       E = –J [S₁S₂ + S₁S₃ + S₂S₃],\n     where J is an interaction constant.\n   - Temperature enters via β = 1/(kT), with k the Boltzmann constant and T the temperature.\n   - The goal (not to be restated per instructions) involves computing the partition function Z.\n\n2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:\n   - Each unordered pair of spins contributes a term –J\u2009Si\u2009Sj to the energy; there are three such pairs: (1,2), (1,3), (2,3).\n   - When two spins are aligned (Si = Sj), the product Si\u2009Sj = +1 yields an energy contribution –J; when anti‐aligned, Si\u2009Sj = –1 gives +J.\n   - The total energy depends on how many of the three pairs are aligned vs. anti‐aligned.\n   - The partition function sums exp(–βE) over all 2³ = 8 spin configurations, grouping terms by degeneracy of energy levels.\n\n3. Identify the Field of Study:\n   - This problem lies in statistical mechanics (physics) and mathematical physics.\n   - It involves concepts from thermodynamics (partition functions) and combinatorial enumeration of states.\n   - Similar formulations appear in studies of the Ising model, Boltzmann statistics, and spin systems.\n\n4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:\n   - The sign of J (ferromagnetic if J>0, antiferromagnetic if J<0) affects which configurations have lower energy; the problem does not explicitly state its sign but likely assumes J>0.\n   - There are no external fields or boundary conditions mentioned, so interactions are only pairwise among the three spins.\n   - One should confirm that all eight configurations are to be counted with equal weight in the sum for Z..These are just pieces of information related to the question.

The energy levels based on the alignment of the spins are: -3J (2 configurations), -J (4 configurations), J (2 configurations), and 3J (1 configuration). Each of these energy levels contributes to the partition function Z based on their degeneracies. The contributions are calculated as follows: \n1.
