proposed answer: In a system of three spins S1, S2, and S3, each spin can take values of +1 or -1, leading to 2^3 = 8 possible configurations. The energy of the system is given by E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I calculated the energy for each configuration: 1) (+1, +1, +1) gives E = -3J, 2) (+1, +1, -1) gives E = J, 3) (+1, -1, +1) gives E = J, 4) (+1, -1, -1) gives E = 3J, 5) (-1, +1, +1) gives E = J, 6) (-1, +1, -1) gives E = -J, 7) (-1, -1, +1) gives E = -3J, 8) (-1, -1, -1) gives E = -3J. The energies can be summarized: E = -3J (4 configurations), E = J (3 configurations), and E = 3J (2 configurations). The partition function Z is calculated as Z = sum(e^(-βE)) for all configurations. The contributions from each energy state are weighted by e^(-βE). After evaluating the contributions, the correct partition function that matches the expected form for this system is choice A, which is consistent with the statistical mechanics principles governing the system of three spins.
