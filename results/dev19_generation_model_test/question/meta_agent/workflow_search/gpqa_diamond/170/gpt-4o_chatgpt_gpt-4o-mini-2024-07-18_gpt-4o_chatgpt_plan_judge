proposed answer: To determine the order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer for the given substances, we analyze the directing effects of each substituent on the benzene ring during electrophilic aromatic substitution. Activating groups such as -CH3 (from toluene) and -C2H5 (from ethylbenzene) favor substitution at the ortho and para positions, leading to a higher yield of para-isomer. Conversely, deactivating groups such as -NO2 (from nitrobenzene) and -COOH (from benzoic acid) direct substitution to the meta position, resulting in a lower yield of para-isomer. Chlorobenzene (-Cl) is weakly deactivating and also directs substitution to the para position but less effectively than the activating groups. Ethyl benzoate (-COOC2H5) is moderately activating, leading to a moderate yield of the para product. Therefore, the expected order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is influenced by the strength of these directing effects. The logical order based on the analysis is 4 (NO2) < 6 (COOH) < 2 (COOC2H5) < 1 (CH3) < 5 (C2H5) < 3 (Cl), which corresponds to choice C. This indicates that the least yield of para isomer comes from nitrobenzene and benzoic acid, while the highest comes from toluene and ethylbenzene. Thus, the correct answer is C.

proposed answer: To determine the order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer for the given substances undergoing electrophilic substitution with bromine, we analyze the substituents on the benzene ring and their directing effects. The substituents can be classified as follows: 1) C6H5-CH3 (toluene) is a strong activator and directs bromination to ortho and para positions, favoring para due to steric hindrance. 2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (ethyl benzoate) is a weak deactivator that directs to ortho and para, with a preference for para but less effectively than alkyl groups. 3) C6H5-Cl (chlorobenzene) is a weak deactivator that also directs to ortho and para, with a slight preference for para. 4) C6H5-NO2 (nitrobenzene) is a strong deactivator that directs to meta, yielding no para isomer. 5) C6H5-C2H5 (ethylbenzene) behaves similarly to toluene, directing to ortho and para with a preference for para. 6) C6H5-COOH (benzoic acid) is a strong deactivator directing to meta, yielding no para isomer. Based on these analyses, the order of substances in terms of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield is 4 (NO2) < 6 (COOH) < 2 (COOC2H5) < 3 (Cl) < 1 (CH3) < 5 (C2H5). This corresponds to choice 4, which is 4<6<2<1<5<3.
