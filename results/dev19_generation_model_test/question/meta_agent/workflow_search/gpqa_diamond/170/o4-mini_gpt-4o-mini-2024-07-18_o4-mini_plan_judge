proposed answer: To determine the order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer for the given substrates, we analyze the electronic and steric effects of each substituent on the benzene ring. The substituents can be classified as either activating (which favor ortho/para substitution) or deactivating (which favor meta substitution). The steric hindrance also plays a role in determining the yield of the para-isomer. 

1) –CH3 (toluene) and 2) –C2H5 (ethylbenzene) are activating and ortho/para directing, leading to significant para yields. 
3) –Cl (chlorobenzene) is deactivating but ortho/para directing, which means it will have a lower yield than the alkyl groups but still favor para over meta. 
4) –NO2 (nitrobenzene) is a strong deactivator and meta directing, resulting in a low yield of para product. 
5) –COOH (benzoic acid) and 6) –COOC2H5 (ethyl benzoate) are also deactivating and meta directing, which further reduces the para yield. 

Considering these factors, the order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer is: 4 (NO2) < 6 (COOH) < 2 (COOC2H5) < 3 (Cl) < 1 (CH3) < 5 (C2H5). This matches choice 4: 4<6<2<1<5<3, which is supported by multiple analyses. Therefore, the final answer is D.
