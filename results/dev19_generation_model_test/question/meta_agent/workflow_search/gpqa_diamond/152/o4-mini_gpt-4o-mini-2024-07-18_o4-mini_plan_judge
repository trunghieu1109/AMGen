Question: Example(question='α-β unsaturated carbonyls have a much more electrophilic carbon double bond. These double bonds act as a good Lewis acid and react with nucleophiles to produce enolate ions. In this case, when a nucleophile attacks the β position, it produces a resonance-stabilized intermediate. When a nucleophile attacking the β-carbon is enolate, such reaction is known as the Michael reaction.\nWhat are the reactants and major final products of the following Michael addition reactions?\ndimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) -->(A)\n1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H3O+) --> (B)\nC + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H2O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice1='A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice2='A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice3='A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice4='A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: To determine the correct choice among the four provided options for the Michael addition reactions, we need to analyze the expected products based on the reactants and conditions specified. For Reaction A, dimethyl malonate reacts with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The expected product should be a tricarboxylate that retains the structure of the malonate while incorporating the p-tolyl group. Choices 1 and 4 both suggest a tricarboxylate structure, but choice 4 specifies '2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate,' which aligns correctly with the expected connectivity and functional groups. For Reaction B, the nucleophile is 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine reacting with (E)-but-2-enenitrile. The expected product should maintain the cyclohexyl and piperidine structure while incorporating a nitrile group. Choice 1 provides '3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile,' which is consistent with the expected product after the reaction, while choice 2 suggests a product that might not accurately reflect the expected outcome after hydrolysis. Lastly, for Reaction C, the product is indicated to be '2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione,' which aligns with the expected outcome of an enolate from a 1,3-dicarbonyl compound reacting with but-3-en-2-one. Choice 4 maintains the necessary functional groups and connectivity throughout for all three reactions. Therefore, the answer is D.
