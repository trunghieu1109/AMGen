Question: Example(question='The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1), and the operators of two observables P and Q of the system are represented by two square matrices. The matrix corresponding to operator P has the elements in first row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0), elements in the second row as (1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}) and that in third row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0). The matrix operator for Q is represented by the square matrix having elements in the first row as (1, 0, 0), second row as (0, 0, 0) and third row as (0, 0, -1). Now, if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P, what is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements?', choice1='1/2', choice2='1/6', choice3='1/3', choice4='2/3', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: To find the probability of measuring Q = -1 after measuring P and obtaining the outcome 0, we start with the normalized state vector ψ(t) = (-1, 2, 1)ᵀ. The norm of this vector is ||ψ(t)|| = sqrt(6), leading to the normalized state ψ_normalized = (-1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6)). After measuring P, we project this state onto the eigenspace corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 of operator P. The projection operator P_0 for this eigenspace has been derived, and applying it to the normalized state gives us the post-measurement state ψ_post. The next step is to compute the probability of measuring Q = -1, which corresponds to the eigenvector of Q associated with the eigenvalue -1, namely (0, 0, 1). We calculate the inner product ⟨Q = -1|ψ_post⟩, square its magnitude to find the probability. After performing these calculations, we find that the probability of measuring Q = -1 is 1/3. This result is consistent across multiple analyses, confirming that the most consistent probability value is indeed 1/3.
