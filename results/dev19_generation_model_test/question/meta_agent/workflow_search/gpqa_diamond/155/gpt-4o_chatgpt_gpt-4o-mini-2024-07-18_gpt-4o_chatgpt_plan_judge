proposed answer: In the reactions, (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene are treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid, leading to the formation of diols. The (E) and (Z) isomers will yield different products due to their stereochemistry, potentially resulting in different diastereomers or enantiomers. When analyzed using standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC, the separation is based on polarity, which means that the different diastereomers may not be fully resolved if they have similar polarities. However, the chiral HPLC will separate based on chirality, allowing for the resolution of enantiomers. Given that (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene can lead to different stereochemical outcomes, we can expect that the chiral HPLC will show more peaks than the achiral one. Therefore, the most likely outcome is that there will be 3 peaks in the standard HPLC (due to some overlap of diastereomers) and 4 peaks in the chiral HPLC (resolving all stereoisomers). This reasoning aligns with the observations made in the previous analyses, confirming that the correct answer is B.

proposed answer: In the reactions involving (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene, both compounds undergo epoxidation followed by acid hydrolysis, leading to the formation of diols. The (E)-isomer will yield one specific diol product, while the (Z)-isomer can yield two enantiomers due to its chiral nature. Therefore, we can expect the (E)-isomer to contribute one peak and the (Z)-isomer to contribute two peaks (one for each enantiomer), resulting in a total of three distinct diol products. In standard (achiral) HPLC, these three products can be detected as three peaks based on their polarities, since this method does not differentiate between enantiomers. However, in chiral HPLC, which can distinguish between enantiomers, we would observe one peak for the diol from the (E)-isomer and two peaks for the two enantiomers from the (Z)-isomer, leading to a total of four peaks. Thus, the expected outcome is 3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC, which aligns with choice B.
