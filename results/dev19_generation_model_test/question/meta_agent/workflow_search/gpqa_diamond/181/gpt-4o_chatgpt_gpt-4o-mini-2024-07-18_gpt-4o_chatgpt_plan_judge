proposed answer: To evaluate the validity of the Mott-Gurney equation, we need to consider the specific conditions under which it is applicable. The Mott-Gurney equation is valid in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime, which requires the following conditions: 1) The device must be trap-free, meaning there are no energy states that can capture charge carriers, allowing for a clear flow of current. 2) The device should be a single-carrier device, which means that only one type of charge carrier (either electrons or holes) is responsible for the current. 3) The device should have negligible diffusion current, indicating that the current is primarily driven by the electric field rather than by concentration gradients. 4) The type of contact is also important; an Ohmic contact is preferred as it allows for linear current-voltage characteristics, while a Schottky contact introduces a barrier that complicates the current flow. Now, let's analyze the provided choices: A) states that the equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current, which aligns perfectly with all the necessary conditions for the Mott-Gurney equation to be applicable. B) mentions an Ohmic contact but does not specify being trap-free or single-carrier, which are critical for the validity of the equation. Therefore, this choice lacks essential criteria. C) refers to a two-carrier device, which contradicts the requirement for a single-carrier device. D) mentions a Schottky contact, which is not compatible with the ideal conditions for the Mott-Gurney equation, as it introduces a barrier that complicates current flow. Therefore, the only choice that fully meets all the criteria is A.
