Question: Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_1_6
proposed answer: Step 1: Define variables and constraints.
Let the box dimensions be x, y, z > 0.
Constraints:
- Surface area: 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 => xy + yz + zx = 27.
- Volume: xyz = 23.

Step 2: Objective function to maximize:
- Maximize d^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2.
- The minimal sphere radius squared is r^2 = d^2 / 4.

Step 3: Use symmetric sums:
Let S1 = x + y + z,
S2 = xy + yz + zx = 27,
S3 = xyz = 23.

Step 4: Express d^2 in terms of S1 and S2:
We know (x + y + z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + zx),
so x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = S1^2 - 2S2 = S1^2 - 54.

Step 5: Maximize d^2 = S1^2 - 54, so equivalently maximize S1.

Step 6: Use Lagrange multipliers for the constraints:
We want to maximize S1 = x + y + z subject to:
- S2 = 27
- S3 = 23

Step 7: Use Lagrange multipliers with function:
L = x + y + z - λ(xy + yz + zx - 27) - μ(xyz - 23).

Step 8: Take partial derivatives:
∂L/∂x = 1 - λ(y + z) - μ(yz) = 0
∂L/∂y = 1 - λ(x + z) - μ(xz) = 0
∂L/∂z = 1 - λ(x + y) - μ(xy) = 0

Step 9: By symmetry, assume two variables equal, say y = z = t, and x = s.
Then:
- S2 = xy + yz + zx = s t + t^2 + s t = 2 s t + t^2 = 27
- S3 = s t^2 = 23

Step 10: From S3, s = 23 / t^2.
Plug into S2:
2 (23 / t^2) t + t^2 = 27
=> 2 * 23 / t + t^2 = 27
=> t^2 + 46 / t = 27
Multiply both sides by t:
t^3 + 46 = 27 t
=> t^3 - 27 t + 46 = 0

Step 11: Solve cubic equation t^3 - 27 t + 46 = 0 for positive t.
Try rational roots using factors of 46: ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46
Test t=2:
8 - 54 + 46 = 0, so t=2 is a root.

Step 12: Factor the cubic:
(t - 2)(t^2 + 2 t - 23) = 0
Solve quadratic t^2 + 2 t - 23 = 0:
t = [-2 ± sqrt(4 + 92)]/2 = [-2 ± sqrt(96)]/2 = [-2 ± 4 sqrt(6)]/2 = -1 ± 2 sqrt(6)

Step 13: Positive root from quadratic is t = -1 + 2 sqrt(6) ≈ -1 + 4.89898 = 3.89898 > 0

Step 14: So possible positive t values are 2 and approximately 3.899.

Step 15: Compute corresponding s = 23 / t^2:
- For t=2, s = 23 / 4 = 5.75
- For t ≈ 3.899, s ≈ 23 / (3.899)^2 ≈ 23 / 15.2 ≈ 1.513

Step 16: Compute S1 = s + 2 t:
- For t=2: S1 = 5.75 + 4 = 9.75
- For t ≈ 3.899: S1 ≈ 1.513 + 7.796 = 9.309

Step 17: Recall d^2 = S1^2 - 54.
Calculate d^2 for both:
- For t=2: d^2 = 9.75^2 - 54 = 95.0625 - 54 = 41.0625
- For t ≈ 3.899: d^2 ≈ 9.309^2 - 54 = 86.66 - 54 = 32.66

Step 18: The maximum d^2 is 41.0625 = 41 + 1/16 = 657/16.

Step 19: Therefore, r^2 = d^2 / 4 = (657/16) / 4 = 657 / 64.

Step 20: Check if fraction 657/64 is in lowest terms:
- 657 factors to 3 * 3 * 73
- 64 = 2^6
No common factors, so fraction is reduced.

Step 21: Compute p + q = 657 + 64 = 721.

Final answer: 721.
