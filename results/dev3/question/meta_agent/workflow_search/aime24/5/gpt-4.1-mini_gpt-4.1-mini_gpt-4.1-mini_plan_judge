Question: Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.

proposed answer: Step 1: Recall the formula for the inradius r of a tetrahedron: r = 3 * Volume / (sum of the areas of its four faces).

Step 2: From the previous sub-task, the volume V of tetrahedron ABCD is 4√77.

Step 3: The problem or previous analysis states that each face area is 6√21. Since there are 4 faces, the total surface area S = 4 * 6√21 = 24√21.

Step 4: Substitute into the inradius formula:
   r = (3 * 4√77) / (24√21) = (12√77) / (24√21) = (√77) / (2√21)

Step 5: Simplify the radical expression:
   r = (√77) / (2√21) = (√77 / √21) * (1/2) = √(77/21) * (1/2)

Step 6: Simplify the fraction inside the square root:
   77/21 = (7 * 11) / (7 * 3) = 11/3

Step 7: So r = (1/2) * √(11/3) = (1/2) * (√11 / √3) = (√11) / (2√3)

Step 8: Rationalize the denominator:
   r = (√11) / (2√3) * (√3 / √3) = (√33) / (2 * 3) = (√33) / 6

Step 9: Thus, r = (1 * √33) / 6, where m=1, n=33, p=6.

Step 10: Check if m and p are coprime: gcd(1,6) = 1, so yes.

Step 11: Check if n is square-free: 33 = 3 * 11, both primes, so yes.

Step 12: Finally, compute m + n + p = 1 + 33 + 6 = 40.

Conclusion: The inradius is (√33)/6, and the sum m + n + p = 40.

proposed answer: Step 1: Recall the simplified inradius expression from Sub-task 3: r = (6 * sqrt(6)) / 41. Step 2: Identify m, n, p from the expression r = (m * sqrt(n)) / p. Here, m = 6, n = 6, p = 41. Step 3: Verify that m and p are coprime. 6 and 41 share no common factors other than 1, so they are coprime. Step 4: Verify that n = 6 is square-free. 6 = 2 * 3, both primes, so 6 is square-free. Step 5: Compute the sum m + n + p = 6 + 6 + 41 = 53. Step 6: Confirm consistency with previous steps and problem conditions. The expression matches the problem's requirements, and the sum is correctly computed. Therefore, the final answer is 53.
