Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent aWhK', content="Step 1: Recall the simplified inradius expression from Sub-task 3: r = (6 * sqrt(6)) / 41. Step 2: Identify m, n, p from the expression r = (m * sqrt(n)) / p. Here, m = 6, n = 6, p = 41. Step 3: Verify that m and p are coprime. 6 and 41 share no common factors other than 1, so they are coprime. Step 4: Verify that n = 6 is square-free. 6 = 2 * 3, both primes, so 6 is square-free. Step 5: Compute the sum m + n + p = 6 + 6 + 41 = 53. Step 6: Confirm consistency with previous steps and problem conditions. The expression matches the problem's requirements, and the sum is correctly computed. Therefore, the final answer is 53.\n\nAnswer:53", prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.

The determinant det(M) is a positive integer ensuring the tetrahedron exists.\n\nStep 3: From Sub-task 2, the total surface area S is 4 times the area of one triangular face, each having sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), and sqrt(89). Using Heron's formula, the semi-perimeter s = (sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)) / 2, and the area of one face is A = sqrt(s * (s - sqrt(41)) * (s - sqrt(80)) * (s - sqrt(89))). Thus, S = 4A.\n\nStep 4: To find r = 3V / S, substitute V and S:\n  r = 3 * (sqrt(det(M)) / (288 * 6)) / (4 * A) = (3 * sqrt(det(M))) / (288 * 6 * 4 * A) = sqrt(det(M)) / (288 * 8 * A) = sqrt(det(M)) / (2304 * A).\n\nStep 5: Simplify the expression by evaluating A symbolically and det(M) explicitly.
