Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent JdOX', content='Step 1: Recall the formula for the inradius r of a tetrahedron: r = 3 * Volume / (sum of the areas of its four faces).\n\nStep 2: From the previous sub-task, the volume V of tetrahedron ABCD is 4√77.\n\nStep 3: The problem or previous analysis states that each face area is 6√21. Since there are 4 faces, the total surface area S = 4 * 6√21 = 24√21.\n\nStep 4: Substitute into the inradius formula:\n   r = (3 * 4√77) / (24√21) = (12√77) / (24√21) = (√77) / (2√21)\n\nStep 5: Simplify the radical expression:\n   r = (√77) / (2√21) = (√77 / √21) * (1/2) = √(77/21) * (1/2)\n\nStep 6: Simplify the fraction inside the square root:\n   77/21 = (7 * 11) / (7 * 3) = 11/3\n\nStep 7: So r = (1/2) * √(11/3) = (1/2) * (√11 / √3) = (√11) / (2√3)\n\nStep 8: Rationalize the denominator:\n   r = (√11) / (2√3) * (√3 / √3) = (√33) / (2 * 3) = (√33) / 6\n\nStep 9: Thus, r = (1 * √33) / 6, where m=1, n=33, p=6.\n\nStep 10: Check if m and p are coprime: gcd(1,6) = 1, so yes.\n\nStep 11: Check if n is square-free: 33 = 3 * 11, both primes, so yes.\n\nStep 12: Finally, compute m + n + p = 1 + 33 + 6 = 40.\n\nConclusion: The inradius is (√33)/6, and the sum m + n + p = 40.\n\nAnswer:40', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
