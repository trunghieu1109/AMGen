Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

Extract and Summarize Given Information:\n- Torus T is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis in the plane of the circle, at a distance 6 from the circle\'s center. This defines a standard torus with major radius R = 6 and minor radius r = 3.\n- Sphere S has radius 11.\n- The torus rests on the outside of the sphere and is externally tangent to it along a circle of radius r_i in one configuration.\n- Similarly, in another configuration (also with the torus resting on the outside), it is tangent along a circle of radius r_o.\n- The problem asks for the difference r_i - r_o expressed as a reduced fraction m/n, then to find m + n.\n\n2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:\n- The torus is defined by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis 6 units away, so the torus\' centerline circle has radius 6.\n- The sphere of radius 11 is fixed.\n- The torus resting on the outside of the sphere and being tangent along a circle implies the torus and sphere surfaces touch along a common circle.\n- The two tangent circles with radii r_i and r_o correspond to two distinct positions or orientations of the torus relative to the sphere.\n- The difference r_i - r_o involves understanding how the radius of the tangent circle changes between these two configurations.\n- The external tangency condition imposes geometric constraints linking the torus\' parameters, the sphere\'s radius, and the position of tangency.\n\n3.

Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:\n- The problem states "when T rests on the outside of S" twice, which may imply two distinct configurations but is somewhat ambiguous.\n- It is not explicitly stated how the torus is positioned relative to the sphere in each case (e.g., orientation, axis alignment).\n- The exact meaning of "externally tangent along a circle" could be clarified (likely the intersection of the two surfaces is a circle).\n- Assumptions may be needed about the axis of revolution of the torus relative to the sphere\'s center and the plane of the circle generating the torus.\n- It may be reasonable to assume the torus\' axis is aligned so that the torus can be positioned to be tangent externally to the sphere in two distinct ways, producing two tangent circles with radii r_i and r_o.\n- The problem likely expects using the known parameters to derive expressions for r_i and r_o and then compute their difference.. \n\nRelated sub-task questions and answers:\n\n### Sub-task 3: Compute the radii r_i and r_o of the tangent circles for the two configurations using the geometric constraints derived.

Since the sphere radius is 11 and torus minor radius is 3, the torus centerline circle must be at a distance from origin such that the minimal distance between surfaces equals zero.\n\nStep 21: The minimal distance between sphere center and torus centerline circle is |d|.\n\nStep 22: The minimal distance between sphere and torus surfaces is |d| - (11 + 3) = 0 => |d| = 14.\n\nStep 23: So set d = 14 or d = -14 for two configurations.\n\nStep 24: Compute A = d^2 + 148 = 196 + 148 = 344.\n\nStep 25: Compute coefficients:\n a = 4 d^2 + 144 = 4 * 196 + 144 = 784 + 144 = 928\n b = -4 d A = -4 * 14 * 344 = -4 * 4816 = -19264\n c = A^2 - 17424 = 344^2 - 17424 = 118336 - 17424 = 100912\n\nStep 26: Compute discriminant D:\n D = b^2 - 4 a c = (-19264)^2 - 4 * 928 * 100912\n = 371,088,896 - 374,580,736 = -3,491,840\n\nStep 27: Discriminant negative means no real solution for d=14.\n\nStep 28: Try d = 10 (guessing different d).

The torus T is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 (minor radius r = 3) around an axis in the plane of the circle that is 6 units away from the center of the circle. This means the major radius R = 6. So the torus is defined by major radius R = 6 and minor radius r = 3.\n\nStep 2: Define the sphere parameters. The sphere S has radius 11 and is placed at the origin of the coordinate system for convenience.\n\nStep 3: Establish coordinate system and orientation assumptions. Place the sphere S centered at the origin (0,0,0). Align the torus so that its axis of revolution is the z-axis. The circle generating the torus lies in the xy-plane, centered at (R,0,0) before revolution. This is a standard orientation for a torus.\n\nStep 4: Geometric representation of the torus. The torus can be represented by the set of points (x,y,z) satisfying (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - R)^2 + z^2 = r^2, where R=6 and r=3.\n\nStep 5: Geometric representation of the sphere. The sphere is all points (x,y,z) such that x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 11^2 = 121.\n\nStep 6: Meaning of external tangency along a circle. The torus and sphere are tangent externally along a circle means their surfaces touch along a common circle, i.e., the intersection of the two surfaces is a circle, and at every point on this circle, the two surfaces have the same tangent plane (they are tangent).\n\nStep 7: Ensuring the torus is outside the sphere in both configurations. Since the sphere is centered at the origin with radius 11, and the torus is generated around the z-axis with major radius 6 and minor radius 3, the torus lies roughly in a 'donut' shape around the z-axis. The torus can be positioned so that it is tangent externally to the sphere in two distinct ways, corresponding to two different distances along the z-axis (or possibly shifted along the axis), producing two tangent circles with radii r_i and r_o.\n\nStep 8: Summary. We have defined the torus with R=6, r=3, axis along z-axis, sphere centered at origin with radius 11. External tangency along a circle means the two surfaces touch along a circle with matching tangent planes. The torus is outside the sphere in both configurations, meaning no part of the torus penetrates the sphere's interior. This setup allows us to analyze the problem further.; answer - Torus T is defined with major radius R=6 and minor radius r=3, generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 around the z-axis at distance 6 from the axis. Sphere S has radius 11 and is centered at the origin. The torus is oriented so its axis of revolution is the z-axis, and the sphere is at the origin. External tangency along a circle means the torus and sphere surfaces touch along a common circle with matching tangent planes. The torus lies outside the sphere in both configurations, meaning the torus does not intersect the interior of the sphere. This geometric setup allows for two distinct external tangencies along circles of radii r_i and r_o.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - Step 1: Recall the torus and sphere definitions. The torus T has major radius R=6 and minor radius r=3, with axis along the z-axis. The sphere S has radius 11 and is centered at the origin.\n\nStep 2: The torus surface is defined by points (x,y,z) satisfying (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - R)^2 + z^2 = r^2.\n\nStep 3: The sphere surface is defined by x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 11^2 = 121.\n\nStep 4: The torus and sphere are externally tangent along a circle means their surfaces intersect in a circle where their tangent planes coincide.\n\nStep 5: The intersection of the two surfaces is given by the system:\n(sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6)^2 + z^2 = 9,\nx^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 121.\n\nStep 6: Let s = sqrt(x^2 + y^2). Then from the sphere, z^2 = 121 - s^2.\n\nStep 7: Substitute z^2 into the torus equation:\n(s - 6)^2 + (121 - s^2) = 9\n=> s^2 - 12s + 36 + 121 - s^2 = 9\n=> -12s + 157 = 9\n=> -12s = -148\n=> s = 148/12 = 37/3.\n\nStep 8: So the intersection circle lies in the cylindrical surface s = 37/3.\n\nStep 9: The radius of this circle in the xy-plane is s = 37/3.\n\nStep 10: The radius of the circle of intersection on the torus is the radius of the circle forming the torus cross-section at s = 37/3. Since the torus is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 centered at (6,0) in the xy-plane, the distance from the axis is s = sqrt(x^2 + y^2).\n\nStep 11: The radius of the circle of intersection on the torus is given by the minor radius r = 3, but the actual radius of the tangent circle on the torus surface is the radius of the circle formed by the intersection in 3D space.\n\nStep 12: The radius of the tangent circle on the torus is r_i = sqrt(r^2 - (s - R)^2) = sqrt(9 - (37/3 - 6)^2) = sqrt(9 - (37/3 - 18/3)^2) = sqrt(9 - (19/3)^2) = sqrt(9 - 361/9) = sqrt(81/9 - 361/9) = sqrt(-280/9), which is imaginary, so this is invalid.\n\nStep 13: This suggests the intersection at s = 37/3 is on the sphere but not on the torus surface. So the intersection is not a circle of tangency.\n\nStep 14: Instead, consider the torus positioned at a distance d along the z-axis from the sphere center, so the torus centerline circle is at z = d.\n\nStep 15: The torus surface equation becomes (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - R)^2 + (z - d)^2 = r^2.\n\nStep 16: The sphere is centered at origin, so sphere equation remains x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 121.\n\nStep 17: For the two surfaces to be tangent along a circle, their intersection must be a circle and the normals must coincide along this circle.\n\nStep 18: The intersection curve is given by points satisfying both equations. Let s = sqrt(x^2 + y^2).\n\nStep 19: From the sphere, z^2 = 121 - s^2.\n\nStep 20: Substitute into torus equation:\n(s - R)^2 + (z - d)^2 = r^2\n=> (s - 6)^2 + (z - d)^2 = 9.\n\nStep 21: Replace z^2 by 121 - s^2:\n(s - 6)^2 + (z - d)^2 = 9\n=> (s - 6)^2 + (z^2 - 2dz + d^2) = 9\n=> (s - 6)^2 + (121 - s^2) - 2dz + d^2 = 9\n\nStep 22: Rearranged:\n(s - 6)^2 - s^2 + 121 + d^2 - 2dz = 9\n\nStep 23: (s^2 - 12s + 36) - s^2 + 121 + d^2 - 2dz = 9\n\nStep 24: -12s + 36 + 121 + d^2 - 2dz = 9\n\nStep 25: -12s + d^2 - 2dz + 157 = 9\n\nStep 26: -12s - 2dz + d^2 + 148 = 0\n\nStep 27: For fixed s, z is determined by the sphere: z = ± sqrt(121 - s^2).\n\nStep 28: The above is a relation between s and z. For the intersection to be a circle, z must be constant along the circle, so set z = z_0.\n\nStep 29: Then from step 26:\n-12s - 2d z_0 + d^2 + 148 = 0\n\nStep 30: Solve for s:\ns = (-2d z_0 + d^2 + 148)/12.\n\nStep 31: From the sphere equation:\nz_0^2 = 121 - s^2.\n\nStep 32: Substitute s from step 30 into this:\nz_0^2 = 121 - [(-2d z_0 + d^2 + 148)/12]^2.\n\nStep 33: This is a quadratic in z_0. Solving it gives possible z_0 for which the intersection is a circle.\n\nStep 34: There are two solutions for z_0, corresponding to two positions of the torus along the z-axis where the torus and sphere are tangent along a circle.\n\nStep 35: For each solution z_0, compute s from step 30, then the radius of the circle of tangency on the torus is r_tangent = sqrt(r^2 - (s - R)^2).\n\nStep 36: The two radii r_i and r_o correspond to the two solutions.\n\nStep 37: The difference r_i - r_o is then computed.\n\nSummary: The two distinct configurations correspond to two values of d (torus centerline position along z-axis) where the torus and sphere are tangent along a circle. For each, the radius of the tangent circle on the torus is r_tangent = sqrt(r^2 - (s - R)^2), with s and z related by the sphere and tangency conditions. This analysis shows how the geometric constraints define the two tangent circles and their radii.; answer - The external tangency between the torus and the sphere occurs along circles defined by the intersection of their surfaces. By positioning the torus centerline circle at different heights d along the z-axis, two distinct tangency configurations arise. For each configuration, the radius s = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) of the intersection circle satisfies the relation derived from combining the torus and sphere equations. The radius of the tangent circle on the torus is r_tangent = sqrt(r^2 - (s - R)^2). Solving the system yields two values of s (and corresponding z), giving two tangent circle radii r_i and r_o. These correspond to the two distinct external tangencies of the torus on the sphere.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - Step 1: Recall parameters: Torus major radius R=6, minor radius r=3; Sphere radius = 11.\n\nStep 2: Set the torus centerline circle at height d along z-axis.

The torus T is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 (minor radius r = 3) around an axis in the plane of the circle that is 6 units away from the center of the circle. This means the major radius R = 6. So the torus is defined by major radius R = 6 and minor radius r = 3.\n\nStep 2: Define the sphere parameters. The sphere S has radius 11 and is placed at the origin of the coordinate system for convenience.\n\nStep 3: Establish coordinate system and orientation assumptions. Place the sphere S centered at the origin (0,0,0). Align the torus so that its axis of revolution is the z-axis. The circle generating the torus lies in the xy-plane, centered at (R,0,0) before revolution. This is a standard orientation for a torus.\n\nStep 4: Geometric representation of the torus. The torus can be represented by the set of points (x,y,z) satisfying (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - R)^2 + z^2 = r^2, where R=6 and r=3.\n\nStep 5: Geometric representation of the sphere. The sphere is all points (x,y,z) such that x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 11^2 = 121.\n\nStep 6: Meaning of external tangency along a circle. The torus and sphere are tangent externally along a circle means their surfaces touch along a common circle, i.e., the intersection of the two surfaces is a circle, and at every point on this circle, the two surfaces have the same tangent plane (they are tangent).\n\nStep 7: Ensuring the torus is outside the sphere in both configurations. Since the sphere is centered at the origin with radius 11, and the torus is generated around the z-axis with major radius 6 and minor radius 3, the torus lies roughly in a \'donut\' shape around the z-axis. The torus can be positioned so that it is tangent externally to the sphere in two distinct ways, corresponding to two different distances along the z-axis (or possibly shifted along the axis), producing two tangent circles with radii r_i and r_o.\n\nStep 8: Summary. We have defined the torus with R=6, r=3, axis along z-axis, sphere centered at origin with radius 11. External tangency along a circle means the two surfaces touch along a circle with matching tangent planes. The torus is outside the sphere in both configurations, meaning no part of the torus penetrates the sphere\'s interior. This setup allows us to analyze the problem further.; answer: Torus T is defined with major radius R=6 and minor radius r=3, generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 around the z-axis at distance 6 from the axis. Sphere S has radius 11 and is centered at the origin. The torus is oriented so its axis of revolution is the z-axis, and the sphere is at the origin. External tangency along a circle means the torus and sphere surfaces touch along a common circle with matching tangent planes. The torus lies outside the sphere in both configurations, meaning the torus does not intersect the interior of the sphere. This geometric setup allows for two distinct external tangencies along circles of radii r_i and r_o.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent MKqx, analyzing tangency conditions, thinking: Step 1: Recall the torus and sphere definitions. The torus T has major radius R=6 and minor radius r=3, with axis along the z-axis. The sphere S has radius 11 and is centered at the origin.\n\nStep 2: The torus surface is defined by points (x,y,z) satisfying (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - R)^2 + z^2 = r^2.\n\nStep 3: The sphere surface is defined by x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 11^2 = 121.\n\nStep 4: The torus and sphere are externally tangent along a circle means their surfaces intersect in a circle where their tangent planes coincide.\n\nStep 5: The intersection of the two surfaces is given by the system:\n(sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6)^2 + z^2 = 9,\nx^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 121.\n\nStep 6: Let s = sqrt(x^2 + y^2). Then from the sphere, z^2 = 121 - s^2.\n\nStep 7: Substitute z^2 into the torus equation:\n(s - 6)^2 + (121 - s^2) = 9\n=> s^2 - 12s + 36 + 121 - s^2 = 9\n=> -12s + 157 = 9\n=> -12s = -148\n=> s = 148/12 = 37/3.\n\nStep 8: So the intersection circle lies in the cylindrical surface s = 37/3.\n\nStep 9: The radius of this circle in the xy-plane is s = 37/3.\n\nStep 10: The radius of the circle of intersection on the torus is the radius of the circle forming the torus cross-section at s = 37/3. Since the torus is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 centered at (6,0) in the xy-plane, the distance from the axis is s = sqrt(x^2 + y^2).\n\nStep 11: The radius of the circle of intersection on the torus is given by the minor radius r = 3, but the actual radius of the tangent circle on the torus surface is the radius of the circle formed by the intersection in 3D space.\n\nStep 12: The radius of the tangent circle on the torus is r_i = sqrt(r^2 - (s - R)^2) = sqrt(9 - (37/3 - 6)^2) = sqrt(9 - (37/3 - 18/3)^2) = sqrt(9 - (19/3)^2) = sqrt(9 - 361/9) = sqrt(81/9 - 361/9) = sqrt(-280/9), which is imaginary, so this is invalid.\n\nStep 13: This suggests the intersection at s = 37/3 is on the sphere but not on the torus surface. So the intersection is not a circle of tangency.\n\nStep 14: Instead, consider the torus positioned at a distance d along the z-axis from the sphere center, so the torus centerline circle is at z = d.\n\nStep 15: The torus surface equation becomes (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - R)^2 + (z - d)^2 = r^2.\n\nStep 16: The sphere is centered at origin, so sphere equation remains x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 121.\n\nStep 17: For the two surfaces to be tangent along a circle, their intersection must be a circle and the normals must coincide along this circle.\n\nStep 18: The intersection curve is given by points satisfying both equations. Let s = sqrt(x^2 + y^2).\n\nStep 19: From the sphere, z^2 = 121 - s^2.\n\nStep 20: Substitute into torus equation:\n(s - R)^2 + (z - d)^2 = r^2\n=> (s - 6)^2 + (z - d)^2 = 9.\n\nStep 21: Replace z^2 by 121 - s^2:\n(s - 6)^2 + (z - d)^2 = 9\n=> (s - 6)^2 + (z^2 - 2dz + d^2) = 9\n=> (s - 6)^2 + (121 - s^2) - 2dz + d^2 = 9\n\nStep 22: Rearranged:\n(s - 6)^2 - s^2 + 121 + d^2 - 2dz = 9\n\nStep 23: (s^2 - 12s + 36) - s^2 + 121 + d^2 - 2dz = 9\n\nStep 24: -12s + 36 + 121 + d^2 - 2dz = 9\n\nStep 25: -12s + d^2 - 2dz + 157 = 9\n\nStep 26: -12s - 2dz + d^2 + 148 = 0\n\nStep 27: For fixed s, z is determined by the sphere: z = ± sqrt(121 - s^2).\n\nStep 28: The above is a relation between s and z. For the intersection to be a circle, z must be constant along the circle, so set z = z_0.\n\nStep 29: Then from step 26:\n-12s - 2d z_0 + d^2 + 148 = 0\n\nStep 30: Solve for s:\ns = (-2d z_0 + d^2 + 148)/12.\n\nStep 31: From the sphere equation:\nz_0^2 = 121 - s^2.\n\nStep 32: Substitute s from step 30 into this:\nz_0^2 = 121 - [(-2d z_0 + d^2 + 148)/12]^2.\n\nStep 33: This is a quadratic in z_0. Solving it gives possible z_0 for which the intersection is a circle.\n\nStep 34: There are two solutions for z_0, corresponding to two positions of the torus along the z-axis where the torus and sphere are tangent along a circle.\n\nStep 35: For each solution z_0, compute s from step 30, then the radius of the circle of tangency on the torus is r_tangent = sqrt(r^2 - (s - R)^2).\n\nStep 36: The two radii r_i and r_o correspond to the two solutions.\n\nStep 37: The difference r_i - r_o is then computed.\n\nSummary: The two distinct configurations correspond to two values of d (torus centerline position along z-axis) where the torus and sphere are tangent along a circle. For each, the radius of the tangent circle on the torus is r_tangent = sqrt(r^2 - (s - R)^2), with s and z related by the sphere and tangency conditions. This analysis shows how the geometric constraints define the two tangent circles and their radii.; answer: The external tangency between the torus and the sphere occurs along circles defined by the intersection of their surfaces. By positioning the torus centerline circle at different heights d along the z-axis, two distinct tangency configurations arise. For each configuration, the radius s = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) of the intersection circle satisfies the relation derived from combining the torus and sphere equations. The radius of the tangent circle on the torus is r_tangent = sqrt(r^2 - (s - R)^2). Solving the system yields two values of s (and corresponding z), giving two tangent circle radii r_i and r_o. These correspond to the two distinct external tangencies of the torus on the sphere.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent BAej, analyzing tangency conditions, thinking: Step 1: Recall the torus and sphere definitions. The torus has major radius R=6 and minor radius r=3, centered around the z-axis. The sphere is centered at the origin with radius 11.\n\nStep 2: The torus surface is defined by points (x,y,z) satisfying (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - R)^2 + z^2 = r^2.\n\nStep 3: External tangency along a circle means the torus and sphere surfaces intersect in a circle where their tangent planes coincide.\n\nStep 4: Consider the torus positioned so that its centerline circle is shifted along the z-axis by a distance d. The torus centerline circle lies in the plane z = d.\n\nStep 5: The intersection of the torus and sphere is a circle lying in the plane z = d. At tangency, the torus and sphere surfaces touch along this circle.\n\nStep 6: For the torus, cross-sections at fixed z are circles of radius sqrt(r^2 - (z - d)^2) around the circle of radius R in xy-plane.\n\nStep 7: The sphere at height z = d has cross-section circle of radius sqrt(121 - d^2).\n\nStep 8: The torus circle of radius sqrt(r^2 - (z - d)^2) is centered on the circle of radius R in xy-plane, so the radius of the intersection circle on the torus is r_c = sqrt(r^2 - (z - d)^2).\n\nStep 9: At tangency, the circle of intersection must be the same on both surfaces, so the distance from the origin to the torus centerline circle (which is R) plus or minus the minor radius cross-section must match the sphere radius at height d.\n\nStep 10: The two configurations correspond to the torus being tangent on the "inner" side (closer to the sphere center) and the "outer" side (farther from the sphere center), giving two distinct values of d.\n\nStep 11: Setting up equations for tangency, we find the two values of d where the torus is tangent to the sphere externally.\n\nStep 12: For each d, the radius of the tangent circle on the torus is r_c = sqrt(r^2 - (z - d)^2), which simplifies to the minor radius r because the tangency circle lies in the plane of the centerline circle.\n\nStep 13: More precisely, the radius of the tangent circle on the torus is the distance from the torus axis to the circle of tangency minus R, or equivalently, the radius of the circle of intersection between the two surfaces.\n\nStep 14: Using the Pythagorean relation and the known parameters, we derive expressions for r_i and r_o, corresponding to the inner and outer tangencies.\n\nStep 15: The difference r_i - r_o is then computed from these expressions.\n\nSummary: The two distinct configurations correspond to the torus shifted along the z-axis by distances d_i and d_o, producing tangent circles with radii r_i and r_o on the torus. These radii depend on the minor radius r and the relative position d to the sphere center. The geometric constraints come from equating the distance from the origin to the torus surface at tangency to the sphere radius, ensuring the surfaces touch along a circle with matching tangent planes.; answer: The conditions for external tangency between the torus and the sphere arise by positioning the torus so that its centerline circle lies in a plane z = d. The sphere\'s cross-section at height z = d is a circle of radius sqrt(121 - d^2). The torus cross-section at z = d is a circle of radius r (minor radius 3) centered on a circle of radius R = 6 in the xy-plane. External tangency along a circle occurs when these two circles intersect tangentially, which happens at two distinct values of d (denote as d_i and d_o). For each d, the radius of the tangent circle on the torus is r_c = sqrt(r^2 - (z - d)^2), but since the tangent circle lies in the plane z = d, this reduces to r_c = r = 3. However, the radius of the tangent circle on the torus surface, as projected in space, depends on the position d and relates to the distance from the torus axis to the tangent circle. The two distinct tangent circles correspond to the torus touching the sphere on its inner and outer edges, resulting in tangent circle radii r_i and r_o respectively. These radii can be expressed in terms of the torus parameters (R=6, r=3) and the sphere radius (11) by solving the geometric constraints for d and computing the corresponding tangent circle radii, thereby distinguishing the two configurations.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent L17I, analyzing tangency conditions, thinking: Step 1: Recall the torus and sphere definitions. The torus T has major radius R = 6 and minor radius r = 3, with axis along the z-axis. The sphere S has radius 11 and is centered at the origin.\n\nStep 2: The torus surface is defined by points (x,y,z) satisfying (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - R)^2 + z^2 = r^2.\n\nStep 3: Sphere surface is defined by x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 121.\n\nStep 4: External tangency along a circle means the two surfaces intersect along a circle, and at every point on this circle, their tangent planes coincide.\n\nStep 5: To find the tangency conditions, consider the distance from the sphere center to the torus centerline circle. The torus centerline is the circle of radius R=6 in the xy-plane around the z-axis.\n\nStep 6: Let the torus be shifted vertically by a distance h along the z-axis relative to the sphere center. Then the torus centerline circle lies in the plane z = h.\n\nStep 7: The sphere is centered at the origin, so the distance from the sphere center to the torus centerline plane is |h|.\n\nStep 8: The distance from the sphere center to any point on the torus centerline circle is sqrt(R^2 + h^2).\n\nStep 9: For the torus and sphere to be tangent externally along a circle, the distance from the sphere center to the torus centerline circle must be such that the sphere of radius 11 and the torus (with minor radius 3) touch along a circle.\n\nStep 10: The torus surface points are at distance r=3 from the torus centerline circle. Thus, the sphere radius 11 must equal the distance from the sphere center to the torus centerline circle plus or minus 3 to get tangency.\n\nStep 11: Therefore, the two tangent configurations correspond to:\n- The sphere radius equals distance from sphere center to torus centerline circle plus minor radius: 11 = sqrt(R^2 + h^2) + 3\n- The sphere radius equals distance from sphere center to torus centerline circle minus minor radius: 11 = sqrt(R^2 + h^2) - 3\n\nStep 12: Solve these for h:\n- For 11 = sqrt(6^2 + h^2) + 3 => sqrt(36 + h^2) = 8 => h^2 = 64 - 36 = 28 => h = sqrt(28) = 2*sqrt(7)\n- For 11 = sqrt(36 + h^2) - 3 => sqrt(36 + h^2) = 14 => h^2 = 196 - 36 = 160 => h = sqrt(160) = 4*sqrt(10)\n\nStep 13: Thus, the two distinct positions correspond to the torus centerline circle lying in planes z = +2*sqrt(7) and z = +4*sqrt(10) (or their negatives, but we consider positive for simplicity).\n\nStep 14: The radius of the tangent circle on the torus is the radius of the circle formed by the intersection of the torus with the sphere. This circle lies on the torus at a fixed distance from the axis.\n\nStep 15: The radius of the tangent circle on the torus is given by the distance from the z-axis to the circle of intersection, which equals the radius of the cross-sectional circle of the torus at height h.\n\nStep 16: The radius of the tangent circle on the torus is r_t = R ± sqrt(r^2 - (z - h)^2), but since the tangent circle lies in the plane of the torus centerline circle, z = h, so radius simplifies to R ± r.\n\nStep 17: However, to distinguish the two tangent circles, note that the radius of the tangent circle on the torus is given by the radius of the circle formed by the intersection of the torus and sphere, which corresponds to the circle of radius r_i or r_o.\n\nStep 18: The two radii are then:\n- r_i = R + sqrt(r^2 - (h_i)^2)\n- r_o = R - sqrt(r^2 - (h_o)^2)\n\nBut since h_i and h_o correspond to the two values found, and the minor radius r=3, and the torus is tangent along these circles, the tangent circle radius corresponds to the horizontal distance from the z-axis to the circle of intersection.\n\nStep 19: Alternatively, since the torus is symmetric, the tangent circle radius on the torus is given by the distance from the z-axis to the circle of tangency, which equals the major radius R plus or minus the vertical offset corresponding to the minor radius circle.\n\nStep 20: Therefore, the difference r_i - r_o corresponds to the difference in these two tangent circle radii, which can be computed from the above h values.\n\nSummary: The two distinct tangent configurations arise from the sphere radius being equal to the torus centerline circle distance plus or minus the minor radius. This yields two values of h, corresponding to two different planes of the torus centerline circle relative to the sphere. The radius of the tangent circle on the torus is related to these positions and can be expressed in terms of R, r, and h. The difference r_i - r_o can then be computed from these expressions.; answer: The two distinct external tangency configurations correspond to the sphere radius equaling the distance from the sphere center to the torus centerline circle plus or minus the torus minor radius: 11 = sqrt(6^2 + h^2) ± 3. Solving yields h = 2√7 and h = 4√10. The radius of the tangent circle on the torus in each case is the distance from the z-axis to the circle of intersection, which depends on R, r, and h.
