Question: Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.

proposed answer: Step 1: Recall the problem and the final count from Sub-task 4: The number of positive integers n ≤ 2024 for which Bob can guarantee a win is the count of losing positions for Alice, which are those n divisible by 3. The count was found to be 674. Step 2: Verify the pattern of losing positions for small values of n by direct analysis: - n=1: Alice can remove 1 token and win immediately, so n=1 is winning for Alice (dp[1] = True). - n=2: Alice removes 1 token, leaving 1 token for Bob, who then removes 1 and wins, so Alice loses if she starts at 2? Actually, Alice can remove 1 token, leaving 1 token for Bob, Bob removes 1 and wins, so Alice loses at n=2? Wait, check carefully: At n=2, Alice moves first. She can remove 1 token, leaving 1 token. Bob removes 1 token and wins. So Alice loses at n=2, meaning dp[2] = False? But this contradicts the previous pattern. Let's check again. Actually, the definition is that dp[n] = True if the player to move can force a win. At n=2, Alice moves first. She removes 1 token, leaving 1 token. Bob moves, removes 1 token, wins. So Alice loses at n=2, dp[2] = False. But this contradicts the previous conclusion that losing positions are multiples of 3. So maybe the pattern is not n mod 3 = 0. Step 3: Re-examine the dp values for small n: - dp[0] = False (no tokens, player to move loses) - dp[1]: can remove 1 token to dp[0] (losing), so dp[1] = True (winning) - dp[2]: can remove 1 token to dp[1] (winning), or 4 tokens (not possible), so all moves lead to winning positions, so dp[2] = False (losing) - dp[3]: can remove 1 token to dp[2] (losing), so dp[3] = True (winning) - dp[4]: can remove 1 token to dp[3] (winning), or 4 tokens to dp[0] (losing), so dp[4] = True (winning) - dp[5]: can remove 1 token to dp[4] (winning), or 4 tokens to dp[1] (winning), so dp[5] = False (losing) Step 4: From this, losing positions are at n=0,2,5,... which is not multiples of 3. Step 5: Check the pattern of losing positions: 0,2,5,... difference between 0 and 2 is 2, between 2 and 5 is 3, next? Let's compute dp[6]: can remove 1 token to dp[5] (losing), so dp[6] = True (winning). dp[7]: remove 1 to dp[6] (winning), remove 4 to dp[3] (winning), so dp[7] = False (losing). So losing positions are 0,2,5,7,... Step 6: The losing positions are not multiples of 3 but seem to follow a pattern. Step 7: Let's list losing positions up to 10: 0,2,5,7,10,... Step 8: The differences are 2,3,2,3,... alternating. Step 9: This suggests losing positions are numbers congruent to 0 or 2 mod 5? Check: 0 mod 5=0, 2 mod 5=2, 5 mod 5=0, 7 mod 5=2, 10 mod 5=0. So losing positions are n mod 5 in {0,2}. Step 10: Verify dp[1] (n=1): 1 mod 5=1, dp[1]=True (winning). dp[3]: 3 mod 5=3, dp[3]=True. dp[4]: 4 mod 5=4, dp[4]=True. dp[5]: 0 mod 5=0, dp[5]=False (losing). Step 11: So losing positions are those where n mod 5 = 0 or 2. Step 12: Count how many n ≤ 2024 satisfy n mod 5 = 0 or 2. Step 13: Number of multiples of 5 up to 2024 is floor(2024/5) = 404. Step 14: Number of n ≤ 2024 with n mod 5 = 2 is also 404 (since residues mod 5 are evenly distributed). Step 15: Total losing positions = 404 + 404 = 808. Step 16: Therefore, the number of positive integers n ≤ 2024 for which Bob can guarantee a win is 808. Step 17: This contradicts the previous answer of 674, indicating the previous conclusion was incorrect. Step 18: Final conclusion: The losing positions are those where n mod 5 = 0 or 2, and the count is 808. Step 19: This is consistent with the DP analysis and small value checks. Step 20: Hence, the final verified count is 808. Step 21: Summary: The initial assumption that losing positions are multiples of 3 was incorrect. Careful DP analysis and checking small values show losing positions correspond to n mod 5 in {0,2}. Counting these gives 808. This matches the definition of losing positions and the problem conditions. Therefore, the final answer is 808.
