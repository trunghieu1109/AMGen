Question: Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.

proposed answer: Step 1: Review the problem setup and constraints: The problem involves points A, B, C, D on the hyperbola x^2/20 - y^2/24 = 1 forming a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin. The diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other at the origin, so A = -C and B = -D. Step 2: Recall the derived expressions: From previous sub-tasks, BD^2 = (44/5)Y - 96, where Y = x_2^2, and X = x_1^2 is related to Y by 11XY = 720Y + 720X - 14400. Step 3: Domain constraints: For the rhombus to exist, X and Y must be at least 20 (due to the hyperbola equation and positivity of coordinates squared). The denominator 11Y - 720 = 0 at Y = 720/11 ≈ 65.4545, which is a critical boundary. Step 4: Behavior near the critical point: As Y approaches 65.4545 from above, X approaches infinity or becomes undefined at exactly 65.4545, so no rhombus exists at Y = 65.4545, but for Y > 65.4545, X is positive and valid. Step 5: Minimal BD^2 value: At Y approaching 65.4545 from above, BD^2 approaches (44/5)*65.4545 - 96 ≈ 480. For all valid rhombi, BD^2 > 480. Step 6: Supremum and maximum: BD^2 increases without bound as Y increases, so no finite maximum exists. The supremum is infinite, but the greatest real number less than BD^2 for all rhombi is 480. Step 7: Edge cases and degenerate configurations: At Y = 65.4545, the denominator zero causes undefined X, so no rhombus exists exactly at that point, avoiding degenerate cases. Step 8: Consistency check: The conditions for the rhombus (equal sides, perpendicular diagonals, points on hyperbola) are respected in the domain Y > 65.4545. Step 9: Robustness: The solution accounts for all constraints, domain restrictions, and geometric properties. Step 10: Conclusion: The final verified answer is 480, representing the greatest real number less than BD^2 for all such rhombi, consistent with all problem conditions and no contradictions found.
