proposed answer: Step 1: Recall the original product: \( \prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) \), where \( \omega \) is a primitive 13th root of unity. Step 2: From Sub-task 1, the term inside the product was simplified to \( (\omega^k - 1)^2 + 1 = \omega^{2k} - 2\omega^k + 2 \). Step 3: Define the polynomial \( f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2 \). The product is \( \prod_{k=0}^{12} f(\omega^k) \). Step 4: The 13th roots of unity are roots of \( g(x) = x^{13} - 1 \). Step 5: The product over all roots of \( g \) of \( f \) evaluated at those roots equals the resultant \( \text{Res}(f,g) \). Step 6: Using the resultant property, \( \text{Res}(f,g) = a_g^{\deg(f)} \prod_{f(r_i)=0} g(r_i) \), where \( r_i \) are roots of \( f \) and \( a_g = 1 \). Step 7: Roots of \( f(x) \) are \( r_1 = 1 + i \) and \( r_2 = 1 - i \). Step 8: Compute \( g(r_i) = r_i^{13} - 1 \). Step 9: Express \( r_1 = \sqrt{2}(\cos \frac{\pi}{4} + i \sin \frac{\pi}{4}) \), so \( r_1^{13} = (\sqrt{2})^{13} (\cos \frac{13\pi}{4} + i \sin \frac{13\pi}{4}) \). Step 10: Simplify \( (\sqrt{2})^{13} = 2^{6.5} = 64 \sqrt{2} \). Step 11: Angle \( \frac{13\pi}{4} = 3\pi + \frac{\pi}{4} \), so \( \cos(3\pi + \frac{\pi}{4}) = -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \), \( \sin(3\pi + \frac{\pi}{4}) = -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \). Step 12: Calculate \( r_1^{13} = 64 \sqrt{2} (-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}) = 64(-1 - i) = -64 - 64i \). Step 13: Similarly, \( r_2^{13} = -64 + 64i \). Step 14: Compute \( (r_1^{13} - 1)(r_2^{13} - 1) = (-65 - 64i)(-65 + 64i) = (-65)^2 + (64)^2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321 \). Step 15: The product is \( 8321 \). Step 16: Find remainder modulo 1000: \( 8321 \mod 1000 = 321 \). Step 17: Double-checking all steps shows no errors in algebra or modular arithmetic. Step 18: Therefore, the remainder when the original product is divided by 1000 is \( \boxed{321} \).
