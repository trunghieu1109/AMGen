Question: Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.

proposed answer: Step 1: Understand the problem setup. We want to count lattice paths from (0,0) to (8,8) on an 8x8 grid, moving only right or up, with exactly four direction changes. Each path has 16 steps: 8 right and 8 up.

Step 2: Define direction changes. A direction change occurs when the path switches from moving horizontally to vertically or vice versa. Exactly four direction changes mean the path consists of 5 monotone segments alternating between horizontal and vertical moves.

Step 3: Consider the two possible starting directions: horizontal first or vertical first.

Step 4: For horizontal start (H-V-H-V-H), the path has 3 horizontal segments and 2 vertical segments. Let the horizontal segment lengths be h_1, h_2, h_3 and vertical segment lengths be v_1, v_2, all positive integers. The constraints are h_1 + h_2 + h_3 = 8 and v_1 + v_2 = 8.

Step 5: For vertical start (V-H-V-H-V), the path has 3 vertical segments and 2 horizontal segments. Let vertical segment lengths be v_1, v_2, v_3 and horizontal segment lengths be h_1, h_2, all positive integers. The constraints are v_1 + v_2 + v_3 = 8 and h_1 + h_2 = 8.

Step 6: Count the number of positive compositions (ordered partitions) of 8 into k parts. The formula is C(8-1, k-1) = C(7, k-1).

Step 7: For horizontal start:
- Number of horizontal compositions into 3 parts: C(7,2) = 21
- Number of vertical compositions into 2 parts: C(7,1) = 7
- Total for horizontal start = 21 * 7 = 147

Step 8: For vertical start:
- Number of vertical compositions into 3 parts: C(7,2) = 21
- Number of horizontal compositions into 2 parts: C(7,1) = 7
- Total for vertical start = 21 * 7 = 147

Step 9: Total number of paths with exactly 4 direction changes = 147 + 147 = 294.

Step 10: Verify by logic and symmetry:
- The problem is symmetric with respect to starting direction, so equal counts for each start direction are expected.
- Each pair of compositions corresponds uniquely to one path because the lengths fix the path uniquely.
- The positive part condition ensures exactly 4 direction changes (no zero-length segments).

Step 11: Cross-check with smaller cases or known identities confirms the reasoning is consistent.

Conclusion: The total number of valid paths with exactly four direction changes is 294.
