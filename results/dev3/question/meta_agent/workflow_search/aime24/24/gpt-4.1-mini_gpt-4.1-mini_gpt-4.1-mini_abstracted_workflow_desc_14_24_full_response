Step 2: Transform the equations using log properties to linear equations in a, b, c: a - b - c = 1/2, -a + b - c = 1/3, -a - b + c = 1/4. Step 3: Solve the linear system by adding all equations to find a + b + c = -13/12, then use substitution to find a = -7/24, b = -3/8, c = -5/12. Step 4: Verify each original equation with these values, confirming all equalities hold exactly. Step 5: Compute |4a + 3b + 2c| = |4*(-7/24) + 3*(-3/8) + 2*(-5/12)| = | -7/6 - 9/8 - 5/6 |. Step 6: Find common denominator 24 and sum: (-28/24) + (-27/24) + (-20/24) = -75/24, absolute value 75/24. Step 7: Simplify 75/24 by dividing numerator and denominator by 3 to get 25/8.
