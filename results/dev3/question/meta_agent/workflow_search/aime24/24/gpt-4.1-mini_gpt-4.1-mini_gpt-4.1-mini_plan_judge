Question: Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations:
\[\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}\]\[\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}\]\[\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}\]
Then the value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: Step 1: Restate the problem in terms of logarithms: Given positive real numbers x, y, z satisfying the system log2(x/(yz))=1/2, log2(y/(xz))=1/3, and log2(z/(xy))=1/4, we defined a=log2(x), b=log2(y), c=log2(z). Step 2: Transform the equations using log properties to linear equations in a, b, c: a - b - c = 1/2, -a + b - c = 1/3, -a - b + c = 1/4. Step 3: Solve the linear system by adding all equations to find a + b + c = -13/12, then use substitution to find a = -7/24, b = -3/8, c = -5/12. Step 4: Verify each original equation with these values, confirming all equalities hold exactly. Step 5: Compute |4a + 3b + 2c| = |4*(-7/24) + 3*(-3/8) + 2*(-5/12)| = | -7/6 - 9/8 - 5/6 |. Step 6: Find common denominator 24 and sum: (-28/24) + (-27/24) + (-20/24) = -75/24, absolute value 75/24. Step 7: Simplify 75/24 by dividing numerator and denominator by 3 to get 25/8. Step 8: Confirm 25 and 8 are coprime, so fraction is in simplest form. Step 9: Calculate m + n = 25 + 8 = 33. Step 10: Double-check all arithmetic and substitutions; all steps are consistent and correct. Step 11: Conclude the final answer 33 is correct and consistent with the problem's requirements.
