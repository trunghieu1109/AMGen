Question: Let $p$ be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $n^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$. Find the least positive integer $m$ such that $m^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_1_4
proposed answer: Step 1: From Sub-task 1, the least prime p for which x^4 ≡ -1 (mod p) has solutions and potentially x^4 ≡ -1 (mod p^2) has solutions is p=13, but lifting to p^2=169 failed. Step 2: Next prime p=17 was found to have solutions x^4 ≡ -1 (mod 17) with x=2. Step 3: Using Hensel's lemma, since f'(2) ≠ 0 mod 17, the solution lifts uniquely to modulo 289. Step 4: The lifting formula gave a candidate solution n ≡ 138 mod 289, but verification showed 138^4 + 1 ≠ 0 mod 289. Step 5: Checking other candidates congruent to 2 mod 17, the smallest positive integer m satisfying m^4 + 1 ≡ 0 mod 289 was found to be m=155. Step 6: Verification confirmed 155^4 + 1 ≡ 0 mod 289. Step 7: Therefore, the least prime p is 17, and the minimal positive integer m such that p^2 divides m^4 + 1 is m=155. Step 8: This conclusion is consistent with modular arithmetic properties, Hensel's lemma, and explicit verification. Step 9: The failure at p=13 and success at p=17 confirms p=17 is the minimal prime with the required property. Step 10: The minimal m is found by checking all candidates congruent to the lifted solution modulo p, ensuring minimality and correctness. Step 11: Hence, the final answer is p=17 and m=155 with full justification and verification.
