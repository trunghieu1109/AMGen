Question: Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: Step 1: Recall the total number of 4-number subsets from S = {1, 2, ..., 10} is C(10,4) = 210. Step 2: Recall the counts of subsets with exactly 2, 3, and 4 matches with Jen's chosen set are 90, 24, and 1 respectively, summing to 115 subsets with at least 2 matches. Step 3: The grand prize event corresponds to exactly matching Jen's chosen 4 numbers, which is exactly 1 subset. Step 4: Calculate the probability of winning a prize (at least 2 matches) as P(prize) = 115/210. Step 5: Calculate the probability of winning the grand prize as P(grand prize) = 1/210. Step 6: The conditional probability P(grand prize | prize) = P(grand prize) / P(prize) = (1/210) / (115/210) = 1/115. Step 7: Check if 1/115 is in lowest terms. Since 1 and 115 share no common divisors other than 1, the fraction is already simplified. Step 8: Compute m + n where the fraction is m/n = 1/115, so m + n = 1 + 115 = 116. Step 9: Cross-check the combinatorial counts: C(4,2)*C(6,2) = 6*15=90, C(4,3)*C(6,1)=4*6=24, and exactly 4 matches = 1, total 115. These are consistent and mutually exclusive categories, so no double counting. Step 10: The calculations and simplifications are correct and consistent with the problem statement and combinatorial logic. Therefore, the conditional probability fraction and the final answer m + n = 116 are correct.
