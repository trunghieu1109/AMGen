Question: Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.

proposed answer: Step 1: Recall the fraction for AP obtained from the previous sub-task is AP = 14/11.
Step 2: Verify if the fraction 14/11 is in lowest terms by checking the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 14 and 11.
- 14 factors: 1, 2, 7, 14
- 11 is prime, factors: 1, 11
- The only common factor is 1, so the fraction is already in simplest form.
Step 3: Compute the sum of numerator and denominator: m + n = 14 + 11 = 25.
Step 4: Cross-check the reasoning and confirm that the fraction 14/11 is consistent with the problem's geometric constraints and previous calculations.
Step 5: Finalize the answer as 25, which is the sum of numerator and denominator of the fraction representing AP in lowest terms.

proposed answer: Step 1: Recall the fraction for AP obtained previously is AP = 12,100 / 1,573. Step 2: Verify if the fraction is in lowest terms by checking for common factors. The denominator 1,573 is prime, so it cannot share any factors with the numerator other than 1. Step 3: The numerator 12,100 factors into 2^2 * 5^2 * 11^2, which does not include 1,573 as a factor. Step 4: Therefore, the fraction 12,100 / 1,573 is in simplest form. Step 5: Compute the sum m + n = 12,100 + 1,573 = 13,673. Step 6: Cross-check the geometric reasoning: the power of a point theorem was applied correctly, and the arithmetic simplifications are accurate. Step 7: The fraction and sum are consistent with the problem's geometric constraints and given data. Step 8: Conclude that the final answer is 13,673.
