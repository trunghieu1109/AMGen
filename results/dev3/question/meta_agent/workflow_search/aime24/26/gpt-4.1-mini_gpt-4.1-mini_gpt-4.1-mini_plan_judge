Question: Alice chooses a set $A$ of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets $B$ of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of $B$ belongs to $A$. Bob's list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A.

proposed answer: Step 1: Recall the set A identified in Sub-task 2 is {4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11}. Step 2: Compute the sum of the elements of A: 4 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11. Step 3: Perform the addition step-by-step: 4 + 6 = 10, 10 + 7 = 17, 17 + 8 = 25, 25 + 9 = 34, 34 + 10 = 44, 44 + 11 = 55. Step 4: The sum of the elements of A is 55. Step 5: Verify that this sum answers the original problem's requirement: The problem asks for the sum of the elements of A given that the total number of sets B is 2024. Since the set A corresponds uniquely to the decomposition of 2024 into sums of 2^(a-1), the sum 55 is the correct answer. Step 6: Therefore, the sum of the elements of A is 55, which completes the problem.
