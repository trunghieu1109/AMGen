Question: Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.

proposed answer: Step 1: Recall the previously found number N = 5694, which is the greatest four-digit number such that changing any one digit to 1 yields a number divisible by 7. Step 2: From the division N รท 1000, we have Q = 5 (thousands digit) and R = 694 (last three digits). Step 3: Compute the sum Q + R = 5 + 694 = 699. Step 4: Verify that N = 1000 * Q + R = 1000 * 5 + 694 = 5694, confirming correctness. Step 5: Optionally verify original conditions: Changing any digit of 5694 to 1 produces numbers divisible by 7, consistent with the problem statement. Step 6: Conclude that the final answer to Q + R is 699.
