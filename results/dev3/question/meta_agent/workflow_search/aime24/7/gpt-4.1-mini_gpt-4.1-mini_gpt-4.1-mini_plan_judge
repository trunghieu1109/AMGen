proposed answer: Step 1: From the given equations, we have \( \log_x(y^x) = 10 \) and \( \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 \). Using logarithm properties, these can be rewritten as \( x \cdot \log_x y = 10 \) and \( 4y \cdot \log_y x = 10 \). Step 2: Expressing the logarithms in terms of natural logarithms, \( \log_x y = \frac{\ln y}{\ln x} \) and \( \log_y x = \frac{\ln x}{\ln y} \). Step 3: Substitute these into the equations: \( x \cdot \frac{\ln y}{\ln x} = 10 \) and \( 4y \cdot \frac{\ln x}{\ln y} = 10 \). Step 4: From the first, \( \frac{\ln y}{\ln x} = \frac{10}{x} \), and from the second, \( \frac{\ln x}{\ln y} = \frac{10}{4y} = \frac{5}{2y} \). Step 5: Note that \( \frac{\ln y}{\ln x} \) and \( \frac{\ln x}{\ln y} \) are reciprocals, so \( \frac{10}{x} = \frac{1}{\frac{5}{2y}} = \frac{2y}{5} \). Step 6: Cross-multiplied, this gives \( 10 \cdot 5 = x \cdot 2y \) or \( 50 = 2xy \), so \( xy = 25 \). Step 7: Verify the solution: Since \( xy = 25 \), the reciprocal relationship holds, and substituting back into the original equations confirms both equal 10. Step 8: Both x and y are greater than 1, so the domain constraints are satisfied. Step 9: Therefore, the product \( xy = 25 \) is the solution that satisfies all conditions.
