Question: Example(question='Consider an aperture, which shapes like a N-sided polygon. All the apothems are of the same length a. When a monochromatic light (of wavelength \\lambda), travelling along z-axis, falls vertically on this aperture, it creates a series of intensity maxima and minima in the far field region. What is the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large ? Assume that the related angles are small so that tan theta = theta approximation can be taken.', choice1='1.220 \\lambda /a ', choice2='0.610 \\lambda / a', choice3='0.500 \\lambda / a', choice4='0.506 \\lambda / a', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: The problem involves diffraction from an aperture shaped as an N-sided polygon with apothem length a. As N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle with radius a. The diffraction pattern for a circular aperture is described by the Airy pattern, where the angular positions of minima correspond to zeros of the Bessel function J1. The first minimum occurs at approximately θ1 ≈ 1.22 λ / D, where D = 2a is the diameter of the aperture. The second minimum occurs at approximately θ2 ≈ 2.233 λ / D. The angular distance between the first two minima is Δθ = θ2 - θ1 ≈ (2.233 - 1.22) λ / (2a) = 1.013 λ / (2a) ≈ 0.506 λ / a. Comparing this value with the given choices, 0.506 λ / a corresponds exactly to choice 4. Other choices either represent the first minimum or unrelated values. Therefore, the correct answer is D). This conclusion is consistent with the known theory of diffraction from a circular aperture and the small angle approximation used in the problem.
