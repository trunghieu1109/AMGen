Question: Example(question='Consider an aperture, which shapes like a N-sided polygon. All the apothems are of the same length a. When a monochromatic light (of wavelength \\lambda), travelling along z-axis, falls vertically on this aperture, it creates a series of intensity maxima and minima in the far field region. What is the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large ? Assume that the related angles are small so that tan theta = theta approximation can be taken.', choice1='1.220 \\lambda /a ', choice2='0.610 \\lambda / a', choice3='0.500 \\lambda / a', choice4='0.506 \\lambda / a', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: The problem asks for the angular distance between the first two minima in the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern of an aperture that is an N-sided polygon with apothem a, in the limit as N approaches infinity. As N becomes very large, the polygon approaches a circle with radius equal to the apothem a. The diffraction pattern for a circular aperture is well-known and described by the Airy pattern, where the intensity minima correspond to the zeros of the Bessel function J1. The first two positive zeros of J1 are approximately 3.8317 and 7.0156. Using the small-angle approximation (sinθ ≈ θ), the angular positions of these minima are θ_m = (x_m * λ) / (2π * a), where x_m are the zeros of J1. The angular distance between the first two minima is Δθ = θ2 - θ1 = ((7.0156 - 3.8317) * λ) / (2π * a) ≈ 3.1839 * λ / (2π * a) ≈ 0.506 * (λ / a). Among the given choices, 0.506 λ / a corresponds exactly to choice 4. This result is consistent with standard optics theory and the Airy disk diffraction pattern for a circular aperture. Considering all possible cases, the polygon approaching a circle justifies using the circular aperture diffraction model, and the small-angle approximation is valid for small diffraction angles. Therefore, the correct choice is D).
