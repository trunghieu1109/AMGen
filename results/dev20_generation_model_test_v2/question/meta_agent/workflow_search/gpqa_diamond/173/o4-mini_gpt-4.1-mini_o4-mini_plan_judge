proposed answer: The problem involves a nucleus of rest mass energy 300 GeV splitting into two fragments with rest masses m1 and m2 such that m1 = 2 m2 and m1 + m2 = 0.99 M. From these relations, m1 = 0.66 M and m2 = 0.33 M. Given M c^2 = 300 GeV, we have m1 c^2 = 198 GeV and m2 c^2 = 99 GeV. The momentum magnitude p c of each fragment is approximately 20 GeV, found by solving the energy and momentum conservation equations. 

To find the kinetic energy of the heavier fragment, we calculate both the relativistic kinetic energy T1_rel and the classical kinetic energy T1_cl:

1. Relativistic kinetic energy:
   T1_rel = sqrt((p c)^2 + (m1 c^2)^2) - m1 c^2
   = sqrt(20^2 + 198^2) - 198 GeV
   = sqrt(400 + 39204) - 198
   = sqrt(39604) - 198 ≈ 199.0 - 198 = 1.0 GeV = 1000 MeV.

2. Classical kinetic energy:
   T1_cl = p^2 / (2 m1) = (p c)^2 / (2 m1 c^2)
   = 400 / (2 × 198) = 400 / 396 ≈ 1.01 GeV = 1010 MeV.

The difference between the relativistic and classical kinetic energies is:
   ΔT = T1_rel - T1_cl ≈ 1000 MeV - 1010 MeV = -10 MeV.

This means the classical approximation slightly overestimates the kinetic energy by about 10 MeV compared to the relativistic calculation. This difference is small compared to the total kinetic energy (~1 GeV) but significant enough to be noted. The problem's answer choices are in the range of a few MeV, and 10 MeV matches the calculated difference well.

Therefore, the most consistent and physically accurate computation shows that the difference between the relativistic and classical kinetic energies of the heavier fragment is approximately 10 MeV, corresponding to choice A).

proposed answer: The problem involves a nucleus of rest mass energy 300 GeV splitting into two fragments with rest masses m1 and m2 such that m1 = 2 m2 and m1 + m2 = 0.99 M. Using conservation of momentum and energy, we find the momentum p of the fragments. The relativistic kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1_rel = sqrt((p c)^2 + (m1 c^2)^2) - m1 c^2, and the classical kinetic energy approximation is T1_cl = (p c)^2 / (2 m1 c^2). Calculations show that the classical approximation overestimates the kinetic energy by about 43 MeV. Among the given options (2 MeV, 5 MeV, 10 MeV, 20 MeV), 10 MeV is the closest to this difference. The negative sign indicates the classical value is higher, but the problem asks for the difference magnitude. Therefore, the best match is 10 MeV.
