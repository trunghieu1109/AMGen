proposed answer: The metric given is ds^2 = (32 / (4 - x^2 - y^2)) (dx^2 + dy^2), defined on the disk x^2 + y^2 < 4. The conformal factor Ω^2 = 32 / (4 - r^2) diverges as r approaches 2, the boundary of the disk. The area element dA = Ω^2 dx dy, when converted to polar coordinates, becomes dA = (32 / (4 - ρ^2)) ρ dρ dθ. The total area is the integral over 0 ≤ ρ < 2 and 0 ≤ θ < 2π of this area element. Evaluating the radial integral ∫_0^2 (32 ρ / (4 - ρ^2)) dρ shows a logarithmic divergence at ρ = 2, indicating the total area is infinite. The other answer choices involving finite expressions with x and y are dimensionally inconsistent and do not represent a scalar area. The choice 0 is inconsistent with the positive definite metric and positive area element. Therefore, the only physically and mathematically consistent answer is that the area is infinite, i.e., +∞. This conclusion is supported by the integral evaluation, the behavior of the conformal factor, and the geometric interpretation of the pseudosphere metric. Hence, the correct choice is A).
