proposed answer: The starting compound 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one undergoes a sequence of reactions. Step 1: Treatment with sodium hydride and benzyl bromide converts the hydroxymethyl group into a benzyl-protected ether, forming product 1. Step 2: Reaction with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide and catalytic HCl converts the ketone at position 1 into a tosylhydrazone (product 2). Step 3: Treatment with n-butyllithium at low temperature triggers the Shapiro reaction, converting the tosylhydrazone into an exocyclic alkene at position 1, while the benzyl protecting group remains intact (product 3). Step 4: Catalytic hydrogenation with Pd/C under hydrogen atmosphere reduces the exocyclic alkene to a saturated alkyl substituent and simultaneously cleaves the benzyl protecting group by hydrogenolysis, regenerating the free hydroxymethyl group at position 3. The isopropyl substituent at position 5 remains unchanged. Among the given choices, choice A, (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol, best fits the expected final product after hydrogenation and debenzylation. Although the name does not explicitly mention the substituent at position 1, it is consistent with the saturated alkyl substituent formed by hydrogenation of the exocyclic alkene. Choices B and C correspond to intermediates before hydrogenation, and choice D retains the benzyl protecting group, inconsistent with hydrogenolysis. Therefore, choice A is the most chemically consistent and correct structure for product 4.
