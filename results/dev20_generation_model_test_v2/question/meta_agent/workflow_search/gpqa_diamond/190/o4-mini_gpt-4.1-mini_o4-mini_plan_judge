proposed answer: The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one, which has a ketone at C-1, a hydroxymethyl group at C-3, and an isopropenyl substituent at C-5. Step 1 involves treatment with sodium hydride (NaH) and benzyl bromide, which deprotonates the hydroxyl group of the hydroxymethyl substituent and alkylates it to form a benzyl ether at C-3 (product 1). Step 2 converts the ketone at C-1 into a tosylhydrazone by reaction with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide and catalytic HCl (product 2). Step 3 treats product 2 with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, inducing the Shapiro reaction, which generates a vinyl anion intermediate that upon aqueous workup forms an alkene at C-1 (product 3). The benzyl ether remains intact at this stage. Step 4 involves hydrogenation over Pd/C under H2 atmosphere. This step has two key effects: (1) hydrogenation of the alkene at C-1 to a saturated alkane, and (2) hydrogenolytic cleavage of the benzyl ether at C-3, regenerating the free hydroxyl group. Additionally, the isopropenyl substituent at C-5, which contains a double bond, is also hydrogenated to an isopropyl group. No butyl substituent is introduced during the reaction sequence; n-BuLi acts as a base and does not alkylate the ring carbons. The hydrazone is removed during the Shapiro reaction and subsequent steps, so no hydrazide functionality remains. Therefore, the final product 4 is a cyclohexane ring bearing a free hydroxymethyl group at C-3, an isopropyl substituent at C-5, and a saturated carbon at C-1. Among the given choices: Choice A, '(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol', best matches this structure. Choice B is inconsistent because it retains the hydrazide functionality. Choice C retains the benzyl ether, which should be cleaved during hydrogenation. Choice D includes a butyl substituent and a benzyloxy group, which are not introduced or retained in the reaction sequence. Hence, choice A is the correct and most chemically consistent structure for product 4.
