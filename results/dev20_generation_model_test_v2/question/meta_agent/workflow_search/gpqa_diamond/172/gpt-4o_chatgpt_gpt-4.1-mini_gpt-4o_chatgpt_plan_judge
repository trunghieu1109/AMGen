proposed answer: The problem involves estimating the minimum uncertainty in the energy (ΔE) of an electron traveling at a high speed (v = 2 × 10^8 m/s) along the x-direction, given an uncertainty in position Δx = 0.1 nm. According to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ ≈ 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s. Using Δx = 0.1 nm = 1 × 10^-10 m, the minimum uncertainty in momentum Δp is approximately ħ/(2Δx) ≈ 5.27 × 10^-25 kg·m/s. Since the electron's speed is about two-thirds the speed of light (c ≈ 3 × 10^8 m/s), relativistic effects are significant and must be considered for accurate calculation. The relativistic energy-momentum relation is E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2, where m_0 is the electron rest mass (~9.11 × 10^-31 kg). The total energy E and momentum p can be calculated using relativistic formulas: p = γ m_0 v and E = γ m_0 c^2, where γ = 1/√(1 - v^2/c^2). The uncertainty in energy ΔE can be approximated by ΔE ≈ (pc^2 / E) Δp. Plugging in the values yields ΔE on the order of 10^-16 J. Non-relativistic approximations (ΔE ≈ v Δp) give a similar order of magnitude but are less accurate due to the high speed of the electron. Among the given choices (~10^-19 J, ~10^-18 J, ~10^-17 J, ~10^-16 J), the closest and most consistent value is ~10^-16 J (choice C). Other options differ by orders of magnitude and do not align with the physical and quantum mechanical calculations. Therefore, considering the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, relativistic corrections, and the given data, the minimum uncertainty in the electron's energy is best represented by choice C.
