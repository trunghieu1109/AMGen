proposed answer: To estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of the electron, we start from the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: Δx·Δp ≥ ħ/2. Given Δx = 0.1 nm = 1 × 10^-10 m and ħ ≈ 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s, the minimum uncertainty in momentum is Δp ≥ ħ/(2Δx) = 1.0545718 × 10^-34 / (2 × 10^-10) ≈ 5.27 × 10^-25 kg·m/s. The electron's speed is v = 2 × 10^8 m/s, which is about 0.67 times the speed of light, indicating relativistic speeds. However, the problem asks for an estimate and suggests using the approximation ΔE ≈ v·Δp to relate momentum uncertainty to energy uncertainty. Multiplying these values yields ΔE ≈ (2 × 10^8) × (5.27 × 10^-25) = 1.054 × 10^-16 J. This value is closest to the choice ~10^-16 J. Although a fully relativistic treatment would be more accurate, the problem context and instructions allow the use of this approximation. Other choices differ by orders of magnitude and are thus less consistent with the calculation. Therefore, the most consistent and justified answer for the minimum uncertainty in energy ΔE is choice C).
