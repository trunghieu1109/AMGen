The species present are Co2+, CoSCN+, Co(SCN)2, Co(SCN)3-, and Co(SCN)4^2-. The cumulative stability constants βn relate the concentration of each complex to the free Co2+ and free SCN- concentrations by: [Co(SCN)n^(2-n)] = βn * [Co2+] * [SCN-]^n for n=1 to 4. The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all species: c(Co) = [Co2+] + Σ [Co(SCN)n^(2-n)]. Substituting the expressions for complex concentrations, we get: c(Co) = [Co2+] * (1 + β1*[SCN-] + β2*[SCN-]^2 + β3*[SCN-]^3 + β4*[SCN-]^4). Solving for free Co2+ concentration: [Co2+] = c(Co) / (1 + β1*[SCN-] + β2*[SCN-]^2 + β3*[SCN-]^3 + β4*[SCN-]^4). The fraction of the dithiocyanato complex Co(SCN)2 is then: fraction = [Co(SCN)2] / c(Co) = (β2 * [Co2+] * [SCN-]^2) / c(Co) = β2 * [SCN-]^2 / (1 + β1*[SCN-] + β2*[SCN-]^2 + β3*[SCN-]^3 + β4*[SCN-]^4). This equation assumes that the given [SCN-] is the free concentration, that activity coefficients are unity (ideal solution), and that no other side reactions or species are present. It also assumes that the cumulative stability constants are accurate and that the system is at equilibrium. This approach accounts for all possible cobalt species formed with 0 to 4 SCN- ligands and correctly normalizes the fraction to total cobalt. Thus, the derived equations are: 1) c(Co) = [Co2+] * (1 + β1*[SCN-] + β2*[SCN-]^2 + β3*[SCN-]^3 + β4*[SCN-]^4), 2) [Co2+] = c(Co) / (1 + β1*[SCN-] + β2*[SCN-]^2 + β3*[SCN-]^3 + β4*[SCN-]^4), 3) fraction of Co(SCN)2 = β2 * [SCN-]^2 / (1 + β1*[SCN-] + β2*[SCN-]^2 + β3*[SCN-]^3 + β4*[SCN-]^4).

The cumulative constants βn define the equilibrium concentrations relative to free Co2+ and free SCN- by: [Co(SCN)n^(2-n)] = βn * [Co2+] * [SCN-]^n. The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all cobalt species: c(Co) = [Co2+] + Σ [Co(SCN)n^(2-n)] for n=1 to 4.

The cumulative stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The fraction of the dithiocyanato complex Co(SCN)2 among all cobalt species is given by the formula: fraction = (β2 * [SCN-]^2) / (1 + β1*[SCN-] + β2*[SCN-]^2 + β3*[SCN-]^3 + β4*[SCN-]^4). Substituting the values: numerator = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4; denominator = 1 + 9*0.1 + 40*0.01 + 63*0.001 + 16*0.0001 = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646. Therefore, fraction = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.1691 or 16.91%. This corresponds to approximately 16.9%. Hence, the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex Co(SCN)2 is about 16.9%. This calculation assumes that the given [SCN-] is the free concentration, activity coefficients are unity, and the system is at equilibrium with no other side reactions. The result matches choice A).; answer: A)\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent i0f4, initial choice comparison, thinking: The calculated percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex Co(SCN)2 is approximately 16.9%, based on the formula fraction = (β2 * [SCN-]^2) / (1 + β1*[SCN-] + β2*[SCN-]^2 + β3*[SCN-]^3 + β4*[SCN-]^4) and substituting the given values. This calculation assumes that the given [SCN-] is the free concentration, activity coefficients are unity, and the system is at equilibrium with no other side reactions. The result closely matches choice A) 16.9%. Other choices (42.3%, 25.6%, 38.1%) are significantly different and do not align with the calculated value. Potential sources of error such as ignoring activity coefficients or assuming total SCN- concentration as free SCN- could affect the result, but given the data and standard assumptions, choice A) is the best match.; answer: A)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCritic agent 6i5q, feedback: The choice A) 16.9% is correct based on the calculation of the fraction of the blue dithiocyanato complex Co(SCN)2 using the given cumulative stability constants and the provided concentrations. The fraction is calculated as (β2 * [SCN-]^2) / (1 + β1*[SCN-] + β2*[SCN-]^2 + β3*[SCN-]^3 + β4*[SCN-]^4). Substituting β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16 and [SCN-]=0.1 M, the fraction comes out close to 0.169 or 16.9%. This assumes that the given [SCN-] is the free concentration, activity coefficients are unity, and no side reactions or complex equilibria beyond those given are present. Potential errors could arise if the free SCN- concentration is significantly different from the total SCN- concentration due to complexation, or if activity coefficients deviate from unity, but with the data and assumptions provided, choice A is the best and most reasonable answer. Other choices are significantly different and do not match the calculated value. Therefore, the choice is justified and correct.; correct: True", iteration_idx=0)]
