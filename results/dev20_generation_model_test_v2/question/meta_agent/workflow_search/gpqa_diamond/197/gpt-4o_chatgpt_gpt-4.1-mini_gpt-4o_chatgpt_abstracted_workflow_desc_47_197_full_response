Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Final Decision Agent Eeoy', content='To find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex Co(SCN)2 among all cobalt species, we use the given total cobalt concentration c(Co) = 10^-2 M and thiocyanate concentration [SCN-] = 0.1 M. The stability constants β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16 correspond to complexes with 1, 2, 3, and 4 SCN- ligands respectively. The concentration of each complex is given by [Co(SCN)n] = βn * [Co2+] * [SCN-]^n, where [Co2+] is the free cobalt ion concentration. The total cobalt concentration is the sum of free Co2+ and all complexed forms: c(Co) = [Co2+] * (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4). Substituting the values: 1 + 9*0.1 + 40*0.01 + 63*0.001 + 16*0.0001 = 2.3646 approximately. Therefore, [Co2+] = 0.01 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.00423 M.

Substituting the given values, the denominator becomes 1 + 9*0.1 + 40*0.01 + 63*0.001 + 16*0.0001 = 2.3646 approximately. Therefore, [Co2+] = 0.01 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.00423 M. Next, the concentration of the dithiocyanato complex Co(SCN)2 is calculated as [Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co2+] * [SCN-]^2 = 40 * 0.00423 * 0.01 = 0.00169 M. The percentage of this complex relative to total cobalt is (0.00169 / 0.01) * 100% = 16.9%.

The dithiocyanato complex corresponds to the species with two SCN- ligands, with stability constant β2=40. To find the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, we consider the equilibrium expressions for all species: free Co(II), Co(SCN)+, Co(SCN)2, Co(SCN)3-, and Co(SCN)4^2-. The fraction of the dithiocyanato complex is given by the ratio of its concentration to the total cobalt concentration. Using the formula for the fraction of each species: fraction_n = (β_n * [SCN-]^n) / (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4), substituting [SCN-] = 0.1 M and the given β values, we calculate the denominator and numerator for n=2.

The equilibrium expressions relate the concentrations of each complex species to the free cobalt ion concentration [Co2+] and the free thiocyanate ion concentration [SCN-]. Specifically, the concentration of each complex is given by [Co(SCN)n^(2-n)+] = βn * [Co2+] * [SCN-]^n. The total cobalt concentration is the sum of free Co2+ and all complexed species: c(Co) = [Co2+] + Σ[Co(SCN)n^(2-n)+] = [Co2+] * (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4).

The stability constants (β) given correspond to cumulative formation constants for complexes with 1 to 4 SCN- ligands coordinated to cobalt.

The total cobalt concentration is 10^-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M, which is in large excess. The stability constants β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16 correspond to stepwise formation of Co(SCN)+, Co(SCN)2, Co(SCN)3-, and Co(SCN)4^2- complexes, respectively. Given these constants, the equilibrium distribution of cobalt species depends on both the concentration of SCN- and the stability constants. Because [SCN-] is high, higher complexes are favored, but the relatively low β4 suggests the tetrathiocyanato complex is less stable than the tri- and di-complexes. The dithiocyanato complex (Co(SCN)2) is formed with an overall stability constant β2=40, which indicates it is significantly stable. The equilibrium concentrations of each species can be calculated using the cumulative stability constants and the free SCN- concentration, assuming negligible changes in SCN- due to its large excess. The fraction of cobalt in the dithiocyanato complex is given by the concentration of Co(SCN)2 divided by the total cobalt concentration. This requires calculating the distribution coefficients using the expression: fraction = β2 * [SCN-]^2 / (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4). Substituting [SCN-] = 0.1 M and the given β values, we find the relative proportion of the dithiocyanato complex. Thus, the relationships show that complex formation is governed by the product of stability constants and ligand concentration powers, and the equilibrium distribution depends on these parameters.

The total cobalt concentration is fixed at 10^-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16 represent the cumulative formation constants for complexes with 1, 2, 3, and 4 SCN- ligands coordinated to Co(II), respectively. These constants indicate the relative stability of each complex species. Complex formation equilibria can be described as: Co^{2+} + n SCN^- ⇌ Co(SCN)_n^{2-n}, with cumulative constants β_n = [Co(SCN)_n^{2-n}]/([Co^{2+}][SCN^-]^n). The distribution of cobalt among the free ion and complexes depends on these constants and the ligand concentration. To analyze the relationships, one must consider the mass balance for cobalt and thiocyanate, the equilibrium expressions involving β values, and the competition among species for cobalt ions. The equilibrium concentrations of each species can be determined by solving the system of equations derived from these relationships. This analysis shows that the formation of the blue dithiocyanato complex (n=2) depends on the relative magnitude of β2 and the concentrations, as well as the presence of other complexes. The equilibrium favors species with higher stability constants and sufficient SCN- concentration.

The total cobalt concentration is 10^-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16 correspond to the cumulative formation constants for complexes with 1 to 4 SCN- ligands, respectively. These constants indicate how strongly each successive complex forms. The species in solution include free Co(II), Co(SCN)+, Co(SCN)2, Co(SCN)3-, and Co(SCN)4 2- (assuming charges to balance). The distribution of cobalt among these species depends on the equilibrium constants and the ligand concentration. To analyze the relationships, one must set up equilibrium expressions for each complex formation step, taking into account the mass balance of cobalt and thiocyanate. The fraction of cobalt in the dithiocyanato complex (Co(SCN)2) is determined by the ratio of its concentration to the total cobalt concentration. Because the ligand concentration is relatively high (0.1 M), multiple complex species can form, but the equilibrium constants suggest that the dithiocyanato complex has a significant but not dominant stability (β2=40). The cumulative constants show that the trithiocyanato complex (β3=63) is more stable than the dithiocyanato complex, but the difference is not large. The tetrathiocyanato complex has a lower stability constant (β4=16), indicating less formation. Therefore, the equilibrium distribution will have a mixture of species, and the dithiocyanato complex will likely represent a moderate fraction of the total cobalt species. The analysis requires calculating the concentration of each species using the given β values and ligand concentration, then determining the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex.

Specifically, the concentration of each complex is [Co(SCN)n^(2-n)+] = βn * [Co2+] * [SCN-]^n. Since the total cobalt concentration is the sum of free Co2+ and all complexes, c(Co) = [Co2+] + Σ[Co(SCN)n^(2-n)+] = [Co2+] * (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4). From this, the free cobalt ion concentration can be expressed as [Co2+] = c(Co) / (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4). The fraction of the dithiocyanato complex (n=2) is then fraction_2 = [Co(SCN)2] / c(Co) = (β2 * [SCN-]^2) / (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4).

The stability constants β1, β2, β3, and β4 correspond to the cumulative formation constants for complexes with 1, 2, 3, and 4 thiocyanate ligands, respectively. The equilibrium expressions relate the concentrations of each complex species to the free cobalt ion concentration, free thiocyanate ion concentration, and the stability constants. Let [Co^{2+}] be the concentration of free cobalt ions, and [SCN^-] = 0.1 M be the concentration of free thiocyanate ions (assuming it remains approximately equal to the initial concentration due to excess). The complexes are: Co(SCN)^+, Co(SCN)_2, Co(SCN)_3^-, and Co(SCN)_4^{2-}. The equilibrium expressions using the cumulative stability constants are set up as follows: [Co(SCN)^+] = β1 * [Co^{2+}] * [SCN^-], [Co(SCN)_2] = β2 * [Co^{2+}] * [SCN^-]^2, [Co(SCN)_3^-] = β3 * [Co^{2+}] * [SCN^-]^3, and [Co(SCN)_4^{2-}] = β4 * [Co^{2+}] * [SCN^-]^4. The total cobalt concentration is the sum of free cobalt and all complexed species: c(Co) = [Co^{2+}] + [Co(SCN)^+] + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3^-] + [Co(SCN)_4^{2-}]. Substituting the expressions for the complexes in terms of [Co^{2+}] and [SCN^-], we get: c(Co) = [Co^{2+}] * (1 + β1[SCN^-] + β2[SCN^-]^2 + β3[SCN^-]^3 + β4[SCN^-]^4). This equation allows us to solve for [Co^{2+}] and subsequently calculate the concentrations of each complex species.

The species formed are Co(II) complexes with 0 to 4 thiocyanate ligands: Co2+, Co(SCN)+, Co(SCN)2, Co(SCN)3-, and Co(SCN)4^2-. The total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M, and the free thiocyanate ion concentration is [SCN-] = 0.1 M. The cumulative stability constants are given as β1 = 9, β2 = 40, β3 = 63, and β4 = 16. These constants represent the equilibrium constants for the formation of complexes from free Co2+ and SCN- ions cumulatively: β1 = [Co(SCN)+]/([Co2+][SCN-]), β2 = [Co(SCN)2]/([Co2+][SCN-]^2), β3 = [Co(SCN)3-]/([Co2+][SCN-]^3), and β4 = [Co(SCN)4^2-]/([Co2+][SCN-]^4). The mass balance for cobalt is: c(Co) = [Co2+] + [Co(SCN)+] + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3-] + [Co(SCN)4^2-]. Using the stability constants, the concentrations of each complex can be expressed in terms of the free Co2+ concentration and [SCN-]: [Co(SCN)+] = β1[Co2+][SCN-], [Co(SCN)2] = β2[Co2+][SCN-]^2, [Co(SCN)3-] = β3[Co2+][SCN-]^3, and [Co(SCN)4^2-] = β4[Co2+][SCN-]^4. Substituting into the mass balance gives c(Co) = [Co2+](1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4).

The complexes formed are Co(SCN)+, Co(SCN)2, Co(SCN)3-, and Co(SCN)4^2-, with cumulative stability constants β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16 respectively. The total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is [SCN-] = 0.1 M. The free cobalt ion concentration [Co2+] can be expressed as: [Co2+] = c(Co) / (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4).
