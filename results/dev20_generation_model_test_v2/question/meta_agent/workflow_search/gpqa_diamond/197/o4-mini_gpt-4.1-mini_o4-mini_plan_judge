Question: Example(question='We have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate, where the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M and the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16. What will be the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species in the solution? ', choice1='16.9%', choice2='42.3%', choice3='25.6%', choice4='38.1%', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_29_197
proposed answer: The calculated percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex Co(SCN)2 is approximately 16.9%, based on the formula fraction = (β2 * [SCN-]^2) / (1 + β1*[SCN-] + β2*[SCN-]^2 + β3*[SCN-]^3 + β4*[SCN-]^4) and substituting the given values. This calculation assumes that the given [SCN-] is the free concentration, activity coefficients are unity, and the system is at equilibrium with no other side reactions. The result closely matches choice A) 16.9%. Other choices (42.3%, 25.6%, 38.1%) are significantly different and do not align with the calculated value. Potential sources of error such as ignoring activity coefficients or assuming total SCN- concentration as free SCN- could affect the result, but given the data and standard assumptions, choice A) is the best match.
