Question: Example(question='Two stars are being studied. It has been observed that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2. In fact, the energy difference between the considered energy levels was determined to be approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J. Assuming that the stellar photospheres are in LTE, which of these equations for the effective temperatures of the stars (T_1 and T_2) is correct?', choice1='ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]\n', choice2='ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]\n', choice3='ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n', choice4='ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: The problem involves comparing the populations of iron atoms in a specific excited energy level in two stars under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). According to the Boltzmann distribution, the population of atoms in an energy level E is proportional to exp(-E/(k_B * T)), where k_B is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature. Given that the population in star_1 is twice that in star_2 for the same energy level, the ratio of populations is N_1 / N_2 = 2. Expressing this ratio using the Boltzmann factors gives: N_1 / N_2 = exp(-ΔE/(k_B * T_1)) / exp(-ΔE/(k_B * T_2)) = exp[-ΔE/(k_B * T_1) + ΔE/(k_B * T_2)]. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides yields ln(2) = -ΔE/(k_B * T_1) + ΔE/(k_B * T_2) = (ΔE / k_B) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1). This expression relates the difference of inverse temperatures to ln(2) multiplied by the constant ΔE/k_B. The problem's given choices omit the explicit factor ΔE/k_B but focus on the algebraic form of the temperature relation. The difference of inverse temperatures (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) can be algebraically rewritten as (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2). Therefore, the correct relation matches the form ln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2), which corresponds to choice D. Other options either have incorrect algebraic forms, involve sums instead of differences, or have squared terms in the denominator, which do not align with the Boltzmann distribution derivation. Hence, choice D is the correct and physically consistent expression relating the effective temperatures of the two stars given the observed excitation ratio under LTE assumptions.
