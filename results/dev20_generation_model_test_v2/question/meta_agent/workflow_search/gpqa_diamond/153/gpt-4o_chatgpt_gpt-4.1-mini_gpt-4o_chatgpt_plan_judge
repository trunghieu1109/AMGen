proposed answer: The molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 with a secondary peak at m/z = 158 (32%) clearly indicates the presence of one chlorine atom due to the characteristic isotopic pattern of chlorine (35Cl and 37Cl). This confirms the molecular weight of the compound is 156. The IR spectrum shows a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1, which is typical of an O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid, and a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1, characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch in a carboxylic acid. This confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group. The 1H NMR spectrum shows a singlet at 11.0 ppm (1H), which is characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid. The two doublets at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm, each integrating to 2 protons, indicate a para-substituted benzene ring with two sets of equivalent aromatic protons. This splitting pattern is consistent with para substitution, where the chlorine and carboxylic acid groups are opposite each other on the benzene ring. Alternative structures such as 2-chlorobenzoic acid would show different splitting patterns due to ortho substitution, 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde would have an aldehyde proton and different IR features, and phenyl chloroformate would lack the broad O-H stretch and have a different molecular weight and NMR pattern. Therefore, integrating all spectral data and considering the molecular weight, isotopic pattern, IR, and NMR data, the most reasonable structural assignment is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.
