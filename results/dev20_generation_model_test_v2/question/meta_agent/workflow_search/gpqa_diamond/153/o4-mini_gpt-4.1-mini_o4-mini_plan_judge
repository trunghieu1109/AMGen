proposed answer: The molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 with a secondary peak at m/z = 158 (32% intensity) clearly indicates the presence of one chlorine atom due to the characteristic isotopic pattern of chlorine (35Cl and 37Cl isotopes in approximately a 3:1 ratio). The molecular weight of 156 corresponds well with the molecular formula C7H5ClO2, which fits chlorobenzoic acid derivatives. The IR spectrum shows a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1, characteristic of O-H stretching in carboxylic acids, and a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1, indicative of a carbonyl group (C=O) consistent with a carboxylic acid rather than an aldehyde or ester. The 1H NMR spectrum shows a singlet at 11.0 ppm (1H), which corresponds to the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid. The aromatic region shows two doublets at 8.02 ppm (2H) and 7.72 ppm (2H), which is characteristic of an AA'BB' system, indicating a para-substituted benzene ring with four aromatic protons. Among the choices, 4-chlorobenzoic acid fits all these data perfectly: it has one chlorine atom, a carboxylic acid group, and a para-substituted aromatic ring giving the AA'BB' pattern in NMR. 2-chlorobenzoic acid would show a more complex aromatic pattern due to ortho substitution, not the AA'BB' pattern observed. 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde would have an aldehyde proton around 9-10 ppm and different IR features, and phenyl chloroformate would not show a carboxylic acid proton at 11 ppm. Therefore, the most consistent and correct answer is 4-chlorobenzoic acid (choice A).
