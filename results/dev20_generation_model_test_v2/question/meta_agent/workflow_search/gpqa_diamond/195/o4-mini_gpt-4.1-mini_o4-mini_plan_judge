proposed answer: The problem involves a relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass m, spring constant k, amplitude A, and speed of light c. The potential energy at maximum displacement A is classical: U = (1/2) k A^2. At the equilibrium position (x=0), all this potential energy converts into kinetic energy. In relativistic mechanics, kinetic energy is given by E_k = (γ - 1) m c^2, where γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2). Equating potential and kinetic energies gives (1/2) k A^2 = (γ - 1) m c^2. Rearranging, γ = 1 + (k A^2) / (2 m c^2). Using the definition of γ, 1 / sqrt(1 - v_max^2 / c^2) = 1 + (k A^2) / (2 m c^2). Squaring both sides and solving for v_max^2 / c^2 yields v_max^2 / c^2 = 1 - 1 / (1 + (k A^2) / (2 m c^2))^2. Taking the square root, v_max = c sqrt{1 - 1 / (1 + (k A^2) / (2 m c^2))^2}. This expression matches choice 2 exactly. It respects the relativistic speed limit (v_max < c), reduces to the classical result v_max = sqrt(k A^2 / m) in the non-relativistic limit (c → ∞), and is dimensionally consistent. Other choices either do not reduce correctly to the classical limit, have incorrect signs, or ignore relativistic factors. Therefore, choice 2 is the correct relativistic expression for the maximum speed of the oscillator.
