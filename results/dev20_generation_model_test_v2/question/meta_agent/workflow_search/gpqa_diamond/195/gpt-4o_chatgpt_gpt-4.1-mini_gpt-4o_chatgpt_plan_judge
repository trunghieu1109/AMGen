proposed answer: The classical maximum speed vmax of a harmonic oscillator is given by vmax = A * sqrt(k/m), derived from equating the maximum potential energy (1/2)kA^2 to the kinetic energy (1/2)mv^2. However, in the relativistic regime, the kinetic energy is not (1/2)mv^2 but (gamma - 1)mc^2, where gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2). The potential energy stored in the spring at maximum amplitude is (1/2)kA^2. Equating this to the relativistic kinetic energy gives (1/2)kA^2 = (gamma - 1)mc^2. Solving for gamma yields gamma = 1 + (kA^2)/(2mc^2). Since gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2), rearranging gives v^2/c^2 = 1 - 1/gamma^2 = 1 - 1/(1 + (kA^2)/(2mc^2))^2. Taking the square root and multiplying by c gives vmax = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA^2)/(2mc^2))^2). This expression correctly reduces to the classical formula when relativistic effects are negligible (kA^2 << 2mc^2) and ensures vmax < c, respecting the relativistic speed limit. Among the given options, only choice B matches this expression exactly. Choice A has incorrect signs and structure, choice C has incorrect dimensionality and signs, and choice D is the classical non-relativistic formula without relativistic corrections. Therefore, choice B is the correct and consistent formula for vmax in the relativistic harmonic oscillator case.
