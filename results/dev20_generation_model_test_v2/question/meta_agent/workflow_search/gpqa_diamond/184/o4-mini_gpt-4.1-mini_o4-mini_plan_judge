proposed answer: The Hamiltonian operator is given as H = ε σ·n, where σ·n is the dot product of the Pauli spin matrices vector with a unit vector n. The Pauli matrices σ_x, σ_y, σ_z each have eigenvalues ±1. Since n is a unit vector, the operator σ·n also has eigenvalues ±1, because (σ·n)^2 = I. Multiplying by ε scales these eigenvalues to ±ε. The question arises whether factors of ħ or 1/2 should appear in the eigenvalues. In quantum mechanics, the spin operator is often defined as S = (ħ/2) σ, which has eigenvalues ±ħ/2. However, the Hamiltonian here is explicitly given as H = ε σ·n, without any factor of ħ or 1/2. Therefore, the eigenvalues of H are simply ±ε. This matches choice A). Other choices include factors of ħ or 1/2, which are not present in the given Hamiltonian definition. Hence, the correct and consistent eigenvalues are +ε and -ε, corresponding to choice A).
