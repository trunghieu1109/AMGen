proposed answer: The Hamiltonian operator is given by H = ε (σ · n), where σ = (σ_x, σ_y, σ_z) are the Pauli spin matrices and n is an arbitrary unit vector. The Pauli matrices each have eigenvalues ±1. Since n is a unit vector, the operator σ · n is a Hermitian operator with eigenvalues ±1. This is because (σ · n)^2 = I, the identity operator, which implies the eigenvalues of σ · n are ±1. Multiplying by the scalar ε scales these eigenvalues by ε, resulting in eigenvalues ±ε for the Hamiltonian H. The other options involving factors of ħ/2 correspond to spin operators themselves (like S = (ħ/2)σ), but here the Hamiltonian is defined directly in terms of the Pauli matrices and the energy scale ε, so ħ does not explicitly appear in the eigenvalues. The eigenvalues must have the dimension of energy, which is provided by ε. Therefore, the correct eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator are +ε and -ε, corresponding to choice A). This conclusion is consistent with the properties of Pauli matrices, the definition of the Hamiltonian, and the dimensional analysis of the problem.
