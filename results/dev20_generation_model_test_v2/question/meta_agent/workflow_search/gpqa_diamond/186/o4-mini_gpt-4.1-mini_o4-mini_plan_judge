proposed answer: To determine how many stars are detectable with the ESPRESSO spectrograph on an 8m VLT telescope at Paranal, we use the criterion that a star is detectable if it achieves a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel in a 1-hour exposure. The key factor is the apparent magnitude (m) of each star, which depends on its absolute magnitude (M_V=15 for the hypothetical stars) and its distance (d) via the distance modulus formula: m = M_V + 5*log10(d/10 pc).

Calculating apparent magnitudes for the hypothetical stars:
- At 5 pc: m = 15 + 5*log10(5/10) = 15 - 1.505 = 13.495
- At 10 pc: m = 15 + 5*log10(10/10) = 15 + 0 = 15
- At 50 pc: m = 15 + 5*log10(50/10) = 15 + 3.495 = 18.495
- At 200 pc: m = 15 + 5*log10(200/10) = 15 + 6.505 = 21.505

Canopus and Polaris are very bright stars with apparent magnitudes much brighter than 10, so their S/N will be well above 10.

From ESPRESSO instrument specifications and typical observing conditions, the limiting magnitude for S/N≥10 in 1 hour on an 8m telescope is approximately V=16 mag. Therefore:
- Stars with m ≤ 16 mag are detectable.
- Stars with m > 16 mag are not detectable.

Applying this:
- Canopus and Polaris are detectable.
- Star at 5 pc (m=13.495) is detectable.
- Star at 10 pc (m=15) is detectable.
- Stars at 50 pc (m=18.495) and 200 pc (m=21.505) are too faint to reach S/N≥10.

Hence, the detectable stars are: Canopus, Polaris, star at 5 pc, star at 10 pc, totaling 4 stars.

This conclusion aligns with the instrument's sensitivity and the given S/N threshold, considering typical noise sources and exposure time. Therefore, the correct multiple-choice answer is 4.

proposed answer: To determine the number of stars detectable with the ESPRESSO spectrograph on an 8m VLT telescope at Paranal Observatory, we use the criterion that a star is detectable if it achieves a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. The limiting apparent magnitude for ESPRESSO to reach S/N=10 in 1 hour is approximately V = 16.5 mag. We calculate the apparent magnitudes of the hypothetical stars with absolute magnitude M_V=15 mag at various distances using the distance modulus formula: m = M + 5 log10(d/10 pc). The calculations yield: 5 pc → 13.495 mag, 10 pc → 15 mag, 50 pc → 18.495 mag, 200 pc → 21.505 mag. Canopus and Polaris are very bright stars with apparent magnitudes approximately -0.72 and 1.98 respectively, well above the detection threshold. Comparing these magnitudes to the limiting magnitude, stars with m ≤ 16.5 mag are detectable. Thus, Canopus, Polaris, the star at 5 pc, and the star at 10 pc are detectable, totaling 4 stars. The stars at 50 pc and 200 pc are too faint to be detected under the given conditions. This conclusion assumes no significant interstellar extinction and typical observing conditions at Paranal. Therefore, the final answer is 4 detectable stars.

The limiting apparent magnitude for detection is approximately V = 15 mag. We calculate the apparent magnitudes of the stars with absolute magnitude M_V = 15 mag at various distances using the distance modulus formula: m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d/10 pc). For d=5 pc, m_V = 13.5 mag; for d=10 pc, m_V = 15 mag; for d=50 pc, m_V = 18.5 mag; for d=200 pc, m_V = 21.5 mag. Canopus and Polaris have apparent magnitudes of about -0.7 and 2.0 respectively, which are much brighter than the limit. Stars with apparent magnitudes brighter than or equal to 15 mag meet the S/N threshold, while fainter stars do not. Therefore, the detectable stars are Canopus, Polaris, the star at 5 pc, and the star at 10 pc, totaling 4 stars. The stars at 50 pc and 200 pc are too faint to be detected under these conditions. Hence, the correct choice is 4.

proposed answer: First, we consider the visibility of each star from the Paranal Observatory, located at latitude approximately -24°. Polaris, with a declination of +89.3°, is not visible from Paranal and is therefore excluded. Canopus, with declination around -52.7°, is visible. The stars at RA=0°, DEC=0° are also visible. Next, we calculate the apparent magnitudes of the stars with absolute magnitude M_V=15 mag at various distances using the distance modulus formula: m_V = M_V + 5*log10(d/10 pc). For d=5 pc, m_V = 13.495; for d=10 pc, m_V = 15; for d=50 pc, m_V = 18.495; for d=200 pc, m_V = 21.505. According to ESPRESSO's performance on an 8m VLT, the limiting magnitude for achieving S/N ≥ 10 in a 1-hour exposure is approximately m_V ~ 15 mag. Stars brighter than or equal to this limit are detectable; fainter stars are not. Therefore, the detectable stars are: Canopus (m_V = -0.7), star at 5 pc (m_V = 13.495), and star at 10 pc (m_V = 15). Stars at 50 pc and 200 pc are too faint to meet the S/N threshold. Polaris is excluded due to visibility constraints. Hence, the total number of detectable stars is 3, matching choice B).
