Question: Example(question='What is the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product obtained when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess of HI?', choice1='1', choice2='3', choice3='0', choice4='5', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_47_182
proposed answer: The original compound 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid has an initial index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of 5. This is calculated by counting: 1 for the cyclohexene ring (one ring), 1 for the double bond in the cyclohexene ring, 1 for the vinyl double bond, and 2 for the two carbonyl groups (formyl and carboxylic acid). When reacted with red phosphorus and excess HI, a strong reducing environment, all double bonds and carbonyl groups are reduced to single bonds or saturated groups. Specifically, the aldehyde (-CHO) reduces to a methyl group (-CH3), the vinyl double bond reduces to an ethyl group (-CH2CH3), the carboxylic acid reduces to a methyl group, and the cyclohexene double bond reduces to a cyclohexane ring. The ring itself remains intact, contributing 1 to the IHD. Since all other unsaturation (double bonds and carbonyl groups) are removed, the product's IHD is solely from the ring, which is 1. Other choices (0, 3, 5) do not fit because 0 would imply no rings or double bonds, which is not the case; 3 or 5 would imply remaining double bonds or multiple rings, which are reduced under these conditions. Therefore, the correct answer is A) 1.
