Question: Example(question='What is the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product obtained when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess of HI?', choice1='1', choice2='3', choice3='0', choice4='5', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: The initial compound 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid has an index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of 5. This is calculated by summing: 1 for the cyclohexane ring, 1 for the double bond in the ring (cyclohexene), 1 for the vinyl double bond, 1 for the aldehyde carbonyl, and 1 for the carboxylic acid carbonyl. When reacted with red phosphorus and excess HI, a strongly reducing and deoxygenating environment, the aldehyde and carboxylic acid groups are fully reduced to hydrocarbons, removing their carbonyl double bonds and thus reducing the IHD by 2. The vinyl double bond and the ring double bond are also reduced or saturated under these conditions, removing 2 more degrees of unsaturation. The ring itself remains intact, preserving 1 degree of unsaturation due to the ring structure. Alternative scenarios such as ring opening or incomplete reduction are less likely given the strongly reducing conditions and excess HI. Therefore, the final product is a saturated cyclohexane ring with alkyl substituents derived from the reduced functional groups, and no double bonds remain. Hence, the final IHD is 1, corresponding solely to the ring. This matches choice A).
