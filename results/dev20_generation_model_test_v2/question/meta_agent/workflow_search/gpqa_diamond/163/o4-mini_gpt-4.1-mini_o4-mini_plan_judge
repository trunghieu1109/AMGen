Question: Example(question='Astronomers are studying two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2. Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.', choice1='~ 0.4', choice2='~ 0.7', choice3='~ 0.6\n', choice4='~ 1.2', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: To find the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we use the relation derived from Kepler's third law and radial velocity amplitudes: M ∝ P * (K_a + K_b)^3. Given: P1 = 2 years, P2 = 1 year, K11 = 10 km/s, K12 = 5 km/s, K21 = 15 km/s, K22 = 10 km/s. Calculate the sum of radial velocity amplitudes for each system: system_1: 10 + 5 = 15 km/s, system_2: 15 + 10 = 25 km/s. Compute the ratio of masses: (P1 / P2) * ((K11 + K12) / (K21 + K22))^3 = 2 * (15/25)^3 = 2 * (0.6)^3 = 2 * 0.216 = 0.432. This value is approximately 0.4, which corresponds to choice A). This calculation assumes circular orbits, similar inclinations (close to 90° due to eclipses), and that the radial velocity amplitudes are measured correctly relative to the center of mass. Potential errors could arise if the orbits are eccentric or inclinations differ significantly, but given the problem's assumptions, these are negligible. Therefore, the closest approximation to the mass ratio is ~0.4, choice A).
