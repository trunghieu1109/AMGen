Question: Example(question='Astronomers are studying two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2. Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.', choice1='~ 0.4', choice2='~ 0.7', choice3='~ 0.6\n', choice4='~ 1.2', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: To determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we use Kepler's third law and the radial velocity (RV) amplitudes. The total mass M of a binary system is related to the orbital period P and the semi-major axis a by M ∝ a^3 / P^2. The semi-major axis a can be approximated by the sum of the RV amplitudes (K1 + K2) multiplied by the period P, assuming circular orbits and an inclination angle close to 90 degrees (justified by the eclipsing nature). Thus, a ∝ (K1 + K2) * P, and M ∝ ((K1 + K2) * P)^3 / P^2 = (K1 + K2)^3 * P. For system_1, K1 + K2 = 10 + 5 = 15 km/s and P = 2 years, so M1 ∝ 15^3 * 2 = 3375 * 2 = 6750 (arbitrary units). For system_2, K1 + K2 = 15 + 10 = 25 km/s and P = 1 year, so M2 ∝ 25^3 * 1 = 15625. The ratio M1 / M2 = 6750 / 15625 ≈ 0.43. This means system_1 is about 0.4 times as massive as system_2, i.e., less massive. The assumptions include circular orbits and similar inclination angles, which are reasonable given the eclipses. Variations in eccentricity or inclination could affect the exact value but not drastically. Among the given choices, ~0.4 (choice A) is the closest and most justified answer. Therefore, system_1 is less massive than system_2 by a factor of about 0.4, so the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2 is approximately 0.4.
