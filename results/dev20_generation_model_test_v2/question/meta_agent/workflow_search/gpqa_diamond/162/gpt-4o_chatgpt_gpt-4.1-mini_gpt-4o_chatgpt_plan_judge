proposed answer: To determine the minimum volume of 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required to dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)3, we start by calculating the moles of Fe(OH)3. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is approximately 106.87 g/mol, so the moles of Fe(OH)3 are 0.1 g / 106.87 g/mol ≈ 9.36 × 10^-4 mol. The dissolution reaction is Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe3+ + 3H2O, indicating that 3 moles of H+ are needed per mole of Fe(OH)3. Therefore, the moles of H+ required are 3 × 9.36 × 10^-4 mol = 2.81 × 10^-3 mol. Given the acid concentration is 0.1 M, the volume of acid needed is moles H+ / concentration = 2.81 × 10^-3 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.0281 L = 28.1 cm3. This volume is less than the total solution volume of 100 cm3, so it is feasible to prepare the solution with this volume of acid. The pH of the resulting solution depends on the leftover acid concentration after neutralizing Fe(OH)3. Since the acid is just enough to dissolve Fe(OH)3, the pH will be acidic but not extremely low, around 2.04. Among the given options, choice A) with pH 2.04 and 28.05 cm3 acid volume closely matches these calculations. Other options either have higher volumes or pH values inconsistent with the stoichiometric and equilibrium considerations. Therefore, choice A) is the correct answer.

proposed answer: To determine the correct choice, we need to combine the calculated minimum volume of 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required to dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm3 total volume and the pH of the resulting solution. The dissolution reaction is Fe(OH)3(s) + 3H+ → Fe3+ + 3H2O, indicating that 3 moles of H+ are needed per mole of Fe(OH)3. Calculating moles of Fe(OH)3: 0.1 g / 106.87 g/mol ≈ 9.36 × 10^-4 mol. Moles of H+ needed: 3 × 9.36 × 10^-4 mol = 2.81 × 10^-3 mol. Volume of 0.1 M acid needed: 2.81 × 10^-3 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.0281 L = 28.1 cm3. This volume is less than the total volume (100 cm3), so it is feasible. The pH after dissolution is expected to be slightly acidic, around 2.04, because the acid is just enough to dissolve Fe(OH)3, leaving minimal excess H+. Other options with higher pH or different volumes do not align with the stoichiometric and equilibrium calculations. Therefore, the correct choice is the one with approximately 28.05 cm3 acid volume and pH 2.04, which corresponds to option A). This conclusion is consistent with the stoichiometry of the reaction, acid-base chemistry, and the given constraints.
