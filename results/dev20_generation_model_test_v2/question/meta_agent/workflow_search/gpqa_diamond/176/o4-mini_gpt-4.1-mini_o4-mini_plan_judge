Question: Example(question='Astronomers are interested in the luminosities of two stars. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2. The mass of Star_1 is also larger by the same factor (1.5 times). Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same. Astronomers also calculated the radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:', choice1='~2.25', choice2='~2.35', choice3='~2.32', choice4='~2.23\n', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: The problem states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2, and both stars have the same observed peak wavelength, implying equal observed temperatures by Wien's law. The naive luminosity ratio calculation ignoring Doppler effects is L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4 = (1.5)^2 * 1 = 2.25. However, Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, causing a Doppler redshift in the observed wavelength. Correcting for this Doppler shift, the intrinsic emitted wavelength of Star_2 is slightly shorter than the observed wavelength, meaning the intrinsic temperature T2_emit is slightly higher than the observed temperature T2_obs. The Doppler correction factor v/c = 700/300000 ≈ 0.002333 leads to T2_emit ≈ 1.00234 * T2_obs. Since T1 = T2_obs, the ratio T1/T2_emit ≈ 1/1.00234 ≈ 0.9977. The corrected luminosity ratio is then L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * (0.9977)^4 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9908 ≈ 2.23. This slight reduction from 2.25 to 2.23 accounts for the Doppler shift effect on temperature. Among the given choices (~2.25, ~2.35, ~2.32, ~2.23), the value ~2.23 best matches the Doppler-corrected luminosity ratio. Therefore, the most consistent and physically accurate answer, considering all factors including Doppler correction, is choice D) ~2.23.
