proposed answer: The luminosity of a star radiating as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law: L = 4πR^2σT^4, where R is the radius and T is the surface temperature. Since both stars have the same peak wavelength of emission, by Wien's Displacement Law, their surface temperatures are equal. Therefore, the luminosity ratio depends solely on the ratio of their surface areas, which is proportional to the square of the ratio of their radii. Given Star_1's radius is 1.5 times that of Star_2, the luminosity ratio L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. The mass difference and radial velocities do not affect the luminosity calculation under the black body assumption. Among the given choices (~2.23, ~2.32, ~2.35, and ~2.25), 2.25 exactly matches the square of 1.5, making choice A the most accurate and consistent answer.

proposed answer: The problem involves comparing the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, where Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2 and the same observed peak wavelength. The observed peak wavelength being the same initially suggests the same temperature for both stars by Wien's Law. However, Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, which causes a Doppler shift in its observed wavelength. Since the observed wavelengths are the same, Star_2's intrinsic peak wavelength must be shorter than observed, implying it is intrinsically hotter than Star_1. Using the non-relativistic Doppler shift formula, the intrinsic wavelength of Star_2 is about 0.9977 times the observed wavelength, meaning Star_2 is hotter by approximately 0.23%. According to Wien's Law (λ_peak * T = constant), the temperature ratio T1/T2 is about 1/1.0023. Luminosity for black bodies is given by L = 4πR^2σT^4, so the luminosity ratio L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4. The radius ratio squared is (1.5)^2 = 2.25. The temperature ratio to the fourth power is approximately (1/1.0023)^4 ≈ 0.9908. Multiplying these gives L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9908 ≈ 2.23. Among the given options (~2.25, ~2.35, ~2.32, ~2.23), the closest and most accurate value is ~2.23 (choice D). This calculation carefully accounts for the Doppler correction, temperature difference, and radius difference, making it the most consistent and correct answer.
