proposed answer: The system has three spins S1, S2, and S3, each can be +1 or -1, so there are 2^3 = 8 total configurations. The energy is given by E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). We analyze the possible sums of the pairwise products: when all three spins are the same (either all +1 or all -1), each pair product is +1, so the sum is 3, and the energy is E = -3J. There are 2 such configurations: (+++), (---). When one spin differs from the other two, two pairs have product -1 and one pair has product +1, so the sum is -1, and the energy is E = +J. There are 6 such configurations, for example (++-), (+-+), (-++), (--+), (-+-), (+--). No other sums are possible. The partition function Z is the sum over all states of exp(-βE). For the two states with E = -3J, the contribution is 2 * exp(-β * (-3J)) = 2 * exp(3Jβ). For the six states with E = +J, the contribution is 6 * exp(-β * J) = 6 * exp(-Jβ). Summing these contributions gives Z = 2 e^{3Jβ} + 6 e^{-Jβ}. This matches choice A). Therefore, the correct expression for the partition function is choice A).
