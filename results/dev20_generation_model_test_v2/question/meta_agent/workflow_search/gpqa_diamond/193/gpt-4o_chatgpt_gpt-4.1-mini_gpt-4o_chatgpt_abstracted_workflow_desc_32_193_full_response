The energy is given by E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). To find the partition function Z = Σ e^{-βE}, we enumerate the energies for all configurations:\n\n1. All spins aligned (S1 = S2 = S3 = +1 or all -1):\n   - Each pair product S1S2, S1S3, S2S3 = +1.\n   - Sum = 3, so E = -J * 3 = -3J.\n   - Number of such configurations = 2.\n\n2.

We need to compute the partition function Z = Σ e^{-βE} over all configurations.\n\nStep 1: Enumerate energy values for all configurations.\n- Case 1: All spins aligned (S1 = S2 = S3 = +1 or all -1). Then each pair product S1S2, S1S3, S2S3 = +1, sum = 3.\n  Energy E = -J * 3 = -3J.

All spins aligned (S1 = S2 = S3 = +1 or all -1):\n   - Each pair product S1S2, S1S3, S2S3 = +1.\n   - Sum = 3, so E = -J * 3 = -3J.\n   - Number of such configurations = 2.\n\n2.
