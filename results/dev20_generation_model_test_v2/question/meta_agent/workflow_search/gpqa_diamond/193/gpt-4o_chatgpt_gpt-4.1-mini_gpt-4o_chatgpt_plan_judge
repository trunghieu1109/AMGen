proposed answer: The system consists of three spins S1, S2, and S3, each of which can be +1 or -1, resulting in 2^3 = 8 total configurations. The energy of the system is given by E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). We enumerate all possible configurations and calculate their energies:

1. When all spins are aligned (all +1 or all -1), each pair product S1S2, S1S3, and S2S3 equals +1, so the sum is 3. Therefore, E = -J * 3 = -3J. There are 2 such configurations.

2. For all other configurations, two spins are aligned and one is opposite, resulting in the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = -1. Thus, E = -J * (-1) = +J. There are 6 such configurations.

The partition function Z is the sum over all configurations of e^{-βE}:

Z = 2 * e^{-β(-3J)} + 6 * e^{-β(+J)} = 2 * e^{3Jβ} + 6 * e^{-Jβ}.

Comparing this expression with the given options, choice A matches exactly. Therefore, the most consistent and correct answer for the partition function is choice A.
