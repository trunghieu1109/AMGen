Question: Example(question='You are studying a nuclear decay which converts two heavy nucleons of flavor A to another flavor B, while simultaneously emitting two much lighter particles E and V. In short, 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V. It is known that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous, with some endpoint value Q.\n\nA variant of this decay emits one exotic, massless particle M instead of the 2V. In this case, how does the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles compare to that of the original decay?', choice1='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint increases.', choice2='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases.', choice3='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.', choice4='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint decreases.', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: The original decay process 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V involves four emitted particles sharing the total available energy, resulting in a continuous energy spectrum for the E particles with an endpoint Q. The continuous spectrum arises because the energy can be variably distributed among the emitted particles, constrained by conservation of energy and momentum. When the two V particles are replaced by a single massless particle M, the number of emitted particles decreases from four to three (2E + M). The massless nature of M means it can carry away energy and momentum without rest mass constraints, allowing it to take any amount of energy continuously. This preserves the continuous nature of the energy spectrum of the E particles. Additionally, since M is massless and only one such particle is emitted instead of two possibly massive V particles, the total energy available to the E particles increases, raising the endpoint of their energy spectrum. The shape of the spectrum changes due to altered kinematics and phase space, but the spectrum remains continuous. Therefore, the most consistent and correct answer is that the spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.
