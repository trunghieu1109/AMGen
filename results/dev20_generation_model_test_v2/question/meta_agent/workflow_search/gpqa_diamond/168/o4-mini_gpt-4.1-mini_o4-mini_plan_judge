Question: Example(question='You are studying a nuclear decay which converts two heavy nucleons of flavor A to another flavor B, while simultaneously emitting two much lighter particles E and V. In short, 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V. It is known that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous, with some endpoint value Q.\n\nA variant of this decay emits one exotic, massless particle M instead of the 2V. In this case, how does the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles compare to that of the original decay?', choice1='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint increases.', choice2='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases.', choice3='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.', choice4='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint decreases.', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: In the original decay 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V, the energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous due to the multi-body final state, where the two V particles provide multiple degrees of freedom for energy and momentum sharing. This allows the E particles to have a range of energies up to an endpoint Q, which corresponds to the maximum total energy the E particles can have when the other particles carry minimal kinetic energy. In the variant decay 2A → 2B + 2E + M, the two V particles are replaced by a single massless particle M. This reduces the number of recoil particles from two to one, decreasing the dimensionality of the recoil system's phase space. However, since there are still three particles (2E and 1 M) sharing energy and momentum, the energy spectrum of the E particles remains continuous. A discrete spectrum would only arise in a two-body decay where kinematics strictly fix energies, which is not the case here. The massless nature of M means it can carry momentum without rest mass energy, allowing the E particles to receive more energy than in the original decay where two V particles (which may have rest mass) share recoil energy. This results in an increase in the endpoint energy of the E particles' spectrum. The shape of the spectrum is also adjusted due to the altered phase space and kinematic constraints. Therefore, combining phase-space analysis with energy–momentum conservation, the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases compared to the original decay. This conclusion is consistent with nuclear decay kinematics, phase space considerations, and the physical implications of replacing two recoil particles by one massless recoil particle.
