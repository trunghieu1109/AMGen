proposed answer: The question asks which effective particle is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry. Magnons, pions, and phonons are all well-known examples of Nambuâ€“Goldstone bosons arising from spontaneously broken continuous symmetries: magnons from broken spin rotational symmetry in magnets, pions from approximate chiral symmetry breaking in QCD, and phonons from broken translational symmetry in crystals. Skyrmions, however, are topological solitons characterized by a nontrivial topological winding number. While they exist in phases where symmetry is broken, they are not themselves Goldstone bosons or direct excitations of a spontaneously-broken continuous symmetry. Their stability and existence depend on topological conservation laws rather than the presence of a continuous broken symmetry mode. Therefore, skyrmions are not directly associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry in the same way as magnons, pions, and phonons. Considering all these points and the consensus from multiple analyses, the effective particle not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry is the skyrmion.
