proposed answer: The chemist starts with two geometric isomers of oct-4-ene: (E)- and (Z)-oct-4-ene. Each is treated with mCPBA, which stereospecifically epoxidizes the double bond, preserving the stereochemistry of the starting alkene. The subsequent aqueous acid treatment opens the epoxide to form vicinal diols. For (E)-oct-4-ene, this yields one pair of enantiomeric diols (two stereoisomers), and for (Z)-oct-4-ene, a different pair of enantiomeric diols (another two stereoisomers). Thus, the combined product mixture contains four stereoisomers total, arranged as two pairs of enantiomers (which are diastereomers to each other). On a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column, enantiomers are not separated and co-elute, so each pair of enantiomers appears as a single peak, resulting in two peaks total. On a chiral HPLC column, enantiomers are separated, so all four stereoisomers are resolved, resulting in four peaks. This is the ideal theoretical outcome assuming perfect chromatographic resolution. The answer choice that best matches this theoretical outcome is 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC. The option with 3 peaks in standard HPLC is not theoretically justified because enantiomers co-elute on achiral columns, and only diastereomers separate. Therefore, the correct classification is 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC.

proposed answer: The reactions involve (E)- and (Z)-oct-4-ene treated with mCPBA and aqueous acid, leading to diol products. The stereochemistry of the products depends on the starting alkene geometry. (E)-oct-4-ene forms a trans-epoxide, which upon ring opening yields a meso diol (achiral). (Z)-oct-4-ene forms a cis-epoxide, which upon ring opening yields a pair of enantiomeric diols (R,R and S,S). Thus, the product mixture contains three stereoisomers: one meso diol and two enantiomers. On a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC, enantiomers co-elute because the column cannot distinguish them, but diastereomers separate. Therefore, the meso diol and the racemic pair appear as two peaks. On a chiral HPLC column, enantiomers are separated, so the racemic pair splits into two peaks, and the meso diol remains one peak, totaling three peaks. This analysis is consistent with stereochemical principles and chromatographic separation capabilities. Other scenarios, such as the formation of more stereoisomers or different stereochemical outcomes, are unlikely given the stereospecific nature of mCPBA epoxidation and the anti ring opening under acidic conditions. Hence, the expected chromatographic observations are 2 peaks on standard HPLC and 3 peaks on chiral HPLC.
