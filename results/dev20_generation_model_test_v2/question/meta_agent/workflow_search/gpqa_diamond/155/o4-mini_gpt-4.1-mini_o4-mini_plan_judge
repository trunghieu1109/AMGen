Question: Example(question='A chemist performs two reactions:\n\nReaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. \n\nReaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.\n\nBoth reactions go to 100% completion. The chemist combines the products of both reactions, and then runs the product mixture on both a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column and a chiral HPLC column.\n\nAssuming that the chromatographic resolution is as high as theoretically possible in both cases, what does the chemist observe in each of these chromatograms?', choice1='4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', choice2='3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice3='2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice4='2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: The chemist performs stereospecific epoxidation on (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene using mCPBA. The (E)-alkene yields a racemic pair of epoxides (two enantiomers), while the (Z)-alkene yields a meso epoxide, which is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry. When combined, the product mixture contains three stereoisomers: two enantiomers and one meso compound. On a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column, enantiomers coelute because the stationary phase cannot distinguish between mirror images, but diastereomers (meso vs racemic pair) separate into distinct peaks. Therefore, the achiral HPLC shows two peaks. On a chiral HPLC column, the chiral stationary phase resolves enantiomers into two separate peaks, and the meso compound appears as a single peak because it is achiral. Hence, the chiral HPLC shows three peaks. This reasoning is consistent with stereochemical principles and chromatographic behavior, assuming ideal resolution and no interconversion or degradation of stereoisomers. Other answer choices are inconsistent with these principles. Therefore, the correct answer is that the chemist observes 2 peaks on the standard (achiral) HPLC and 3 peaks on the chiral HPLC.
