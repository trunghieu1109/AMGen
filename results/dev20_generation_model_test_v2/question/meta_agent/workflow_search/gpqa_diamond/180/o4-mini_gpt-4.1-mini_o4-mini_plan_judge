Question: Example(question='Very large number of neutrinos produced by the Sun reach the Earth (very large flux of neutrinos, defined as the number of neutrinos per cm^2, per second).\n\nLet us assume that, hypothetically, the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the core of the Sun about 8 and a half minutes ago, while all other reactions remained as they were.\n\nWhat would be the approximate ratio of the flux between two bands of neutrino energies of 700-800 KeV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). \n\nFlux (band 1) / flux (band 2) is:\n\n(Note: we are talking about stopping the pp-III branch, not pp-II, pp-I or any other. Itâ€™s not a typo or something like that.)\n(Note 2: solar neutrino flavor changes happen, but do not play a role here.)', choice1='0.1 (10^-1).', choice2='10.', choice3='1.', choice4='0.01 (10^-2).', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: The pp-III branch produces 8B neutrinos, which have a continuous energy spectrum extending well beyond 900 keV, contributing to both energy bands 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). The 7Be neutrinos produce a monoenergetic line at 862 keV, which lies within band 2 but not in band 1. If the pp-III branch suddenly stops, the 8B neutrino flux disappears, removing the continuous spectrum contribution in both bands. Band 1, which relies almost entirely on 8B neutrinos, will see its flux drop to nearly zero. Band 2, however, will still have the 7Be line neutrinos at 862 keV, which remain unaffected. Therefore, after stopping pp-III, the flux in band 1 is nearly zero, while band 2 retains a significant flux. This makes the ratio Flux(band 1)/Flux(band 2) very small, close to zero. Among the given options, 0.01 (10^-2) is the smallest and best represents this near-zero ratio. Other options like 0.1 or 1 or 10 are too large to represent the near-zero ratio expected. Hence, the closest match is 0.01 (10^-2).
