proposed answer: The pp-III branch of the proton-proton chain in the Sun is primarily responsible for producing neutrinos in the higher energy range, particularly in the 800-900 keV band (band 2), mainly from the decay of boron-8. The 700-800 keV band (band 1) neutrinos are predominantly produced by other branches such as pp-I and pp-II, which remain unaffected in this hypothetical scenario where only the pp-III branch stops. Since the pp-III branch is halted, the neutrino flux in band 2 will significantly decrease, while the flux in band 1 remains roughly constant. This leads to a substantial increase in the ratio flux(band 1)/flux(band 2). Given the dominant contribution of the pp-III branch to band 2 and its negligible contribution to band 1, the ratio is expected to increase by about an order of magnitude, approximately 10. This conclusion is consistent across multiple analyses and aligns with the known energy distributions of solar neutrinos and the specific roles of the pp-III branch. Other possible contributions or changes are minimal and do not significantly affect this ratio. Therefore, the most justified and reasonable answer is that the flux ratio flux(band 1)/flux(band 2) is approximately 10.

proposed answer: The pp-III branch of the proton-proton chain in the Sun produces neutrinos primarily through the decay of 8B and electron capture on 7Be. The 8B neutrinos have energies well above 900 keV, so they do not contribute to the 700-800 keV or 800-900 keV bands. The 7Be neutrinos from the pp-III branch produce neutrinos at a discrete energy of about 860 keV, which lies within the 800-900 keV band (band 2). The 700-800 keV band (band 1) neutrinos mainly come from other branches (pp-I and pp-II) and are not significantly affected by the stopping of the pp-III branch. Therefore, stopping the pp-III branch would drastically reduce the neutrino flux in band 2, while the flux in band 1 remains nearly unchanged. This causes the ratio flux(band 1)/flux(band 2) to increase significantly, roughly by a factor of 10. Other options such as 0.1 or 0.01 would imply a decrease in the ratio, which contradicts the physics of the problem. A ratio of 1 would mean no change, which is inconsistent with the known significant contribution of the pp-III branch to band 2. The time delay of 8.5 minutes corresponds to the travel time of neutrinos from the Sun to Earth, so the effect of stopping the pp-III branch would be observed after this delay. Considering all these factors and the consistent agreement among multiple expert analyses, the most reasonable and physically justified answer is that the ratio flux(band 1)/flux(band 2) is approximately 10.
