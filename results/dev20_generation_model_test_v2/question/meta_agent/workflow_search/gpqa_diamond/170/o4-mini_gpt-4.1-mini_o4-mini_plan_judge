proposed answer: The para-bromo weight fraction depends primarily on the para selectivity (mole fraction of para isomer) and the molar mass of the para-bromo derivative relative to the total product mixture. Activating ortho/para directors like -CH3 (toluene) and -C2H5 (ethylbenzene) favor high para substitution, leading to higher para mole fractions. Deactivating meta directors like -NO2 (nitrobenzene), -COOH (benzoic acid), and -COOC2H5 (ethyl benzoate) favor meta substitution, resulting in low para mole fractions. Halogen substituents (-Cl) are deactivating but ortho/para directing, giving moderate para mole fractions. Since bromine adds the same mass to all compounds, the molar mass differences of substituents slightly influence the weight fraction but do not change the overall order significantly. Combining these factors, the increasing order of para-bromo weight fraction is: nitrobenzene (4) < ethyl benzoate (2) < benzoic acid (6) < chlorobenzene (3) < toluene (1) < ethylbenzene (5). This order matches choice 2 exactly, making it the most chemically consistent and justified answer.

proposed answer: The final ascending order of the substances by increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer, as reasoned in Sub-task 4 and confirmed by sensitivity analysis in Sub-task 5, is 4 < 2 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5. This order reflects the combined effects of substituent directing influence on para substitution and the molar masses of the para-bromo derivatives. Nitrobenzene (4) has the lowest para fraction due to strong meta-directing and deactivating effects, followed by ethyl benzoate (2) and benzoic acid (6), which are also meta directors but differ in molar mass. Chlorobenzene (3) is a deactivating ortho/para director with moderate para fraction, toluene (1) is an activating ortho/para director with higher para fraction, and ethylbenzene (5) has the highest para fraction due to strong activating effects. Among the provided choices, choice2 ('4<2<6<3<1<5') exactly matches this order. The sensitivity analysis confirms that small variations in mole fraction or molar mass do not change this ranking significantly, making choice2 the most robust and accurate selection. Therefore, the correct answer is B).
