proposed answer: The problem requires arranging benzene derivatives 1-6 in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed upon electrophilic bromination. The key factor is the directing effect of the substituent already on the benzene ring. Substituents can be activating or deactivating and direct substitution either ortho/para or meta. Activating groups (electron-donating) such as alkyl groups (CH3 in 1 and C2H5 in 5) direct substitution mainly to ortho and para positions, favoring higher para-isomer yields. Among these, the ethyl group (C2H5) is slightly more activating than methyl (CH3), so 5 > 1 in para yield. Halogen (Cl in 3) is deactivating but ortho/para directing due to resonance, so it gives moderate para yield, lower than alkyls but higher than meta-directing groups. Meta-directing groups are strongly or moderately deactivating: NO2 (4) is the strongest deactivator and meta director, so it has the lowest para-isomer yield. COOH (6) is also meta directing but less strongly deactivating than NO2, so its para yield is higher than NO2 but lower than ester. The ester group (COOC2H5 in 2) is also meta directing but less deactivating than COOH, so its para-isomer yield is higher than COOH but lower than Cl. Therefore, the increasing order of para-isomer yield is: 4 (NO2) < 6 (COOH) < 2 (COOC2H5) < 3 (Cl) < 1 (CH3) < 5 (C2H5). This order corresponds to choice D. Although some agents suggested choice B, it places ester before COOH, which contradicts the known stronger deactivating effect of COOH compared to ester. Choice D correctly places COOH before ester and aligns with the known directing effects and relative activating/deactivating strengths of the substituents. Hence, choice D is the most chemically accurate and consistent answer.
