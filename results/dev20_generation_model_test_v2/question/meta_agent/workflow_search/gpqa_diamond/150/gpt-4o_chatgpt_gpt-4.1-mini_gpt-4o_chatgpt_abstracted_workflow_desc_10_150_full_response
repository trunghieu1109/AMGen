The matrix P is given as a 3x3 matrix with elements: first row (0, 1/√2, 0), second row (1/√2, 0, 1/√2), and third row (0, 1/√2, 0). The state vector |ψ⟩ is a 3x1 column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). To perform the multiplication P|ψ⟩, each element of the resulting vector is computed by taking the dot product of each row of P with the vector |ψ⟩. \n\nStep 1: First element = 0*(-1) + (1/√2)*2 + 0*1 = 2/√2 = √2\nStep 2: Second element = (1/√2)*(-1) + 0*2 + (1/√2)*1 = (-1/√2) + 0 + (1/√2) = 0\nStep 3: Third element = 0*(-1) + (1/√2)*2 + 0*1 = 2/√2 = √2\n\nThus, the resulting vector after multiplication is [√2, 0, √2]^T.

Identify the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0: from previous analysis, eigenvalue 0 has eigenvector |v0> proportional to [1, 0, -1].\n\n2. Normalize the eigenvector |v0|: its norm is sqrt(1^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2). So normalized eigenvector |v0> = (1/sqrt(2))[1, 0, -1].\n\n3. Normalize the system state vector |ψ>: given |ψ> = [-1, 2, 1]. Its norm is sqrt((-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(1 + 4 + 1) = sqrt(6).\n\n4. Calculate the projection amplitude of |ψ> onto |v0>:\n   <v0|ψ> = (1/sqrt(2)) * [-1*1 + 2*0 + 1*(-1)] = (1/sqrt(2)) * (-1 + 0 -1) = (1/sqrt(2)) * (-2) = -2/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2)*sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2)*sqrt(2) = -2/sqrt(2) (recheck calculation)\n\n   More carefully:\n   <v0|ψ> = (1/sqrt(2)) * (-1 + 0 -1) = (1/sqrt(2)) * (-2) = -2/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2)*sqrt(2) is incorrect.
