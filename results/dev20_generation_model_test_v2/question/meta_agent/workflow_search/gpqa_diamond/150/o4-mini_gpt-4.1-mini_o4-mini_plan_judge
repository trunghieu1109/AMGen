Question: Example(question='The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1). An observable of the system is represented by the matrix operator P having elements in the first row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0),  in the second row as (1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}) and in the third row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0). Calculate the probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 at time t.', choice1='1/3\n', choice2='2/3\n', choice3='\\sqrt{2/3}\n', choice4='1', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: The probability p(0) that the measurement of the observable P yields the eigenvalue 0 is calculated by projecting the normalized state vector |ψ⟩ onto the eigenspace of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0. First, normalize the state vector |ψ⟩ = (-1, 2, 1)^T. Its norm is sqrt((-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(1 + 4 + 1) = sqrt(6). So, the normalized state vector is |ψ_normalized⟩ = (-1/√6, 2/√6, 1/√6)^T. Next, find the eigenvectors of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0 by solving P v = 0. The nullspace is spanned by (1, 0, -1)^T, which normalized is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2)^T. The projector Π₀ onto this eigenspace is Π₀ = |v_0⟩⟨v_0| = [[1/2, 0, -1/2], [0, 0, 0], [-1/2, 0, 1/2]]. Compute Π₀ |ψ_normalized⟩ = (-1/√6, 0, 1/√6)^T. Then, p(0) = ⟨ψ_normalized| Π₀ |ψ_normalized⟩ = (-1/√6)(-1/√6) + (2/√6)*0 + (1/√6)(1/√6) = 1/6 + 0 + 1/6 = 1/3. This matches exactly one of the provided choices, confirming the correctness of the calculation. Other choices do not match the computed probability, and the method accounts for normalization and correct projection, so the answer is A).
