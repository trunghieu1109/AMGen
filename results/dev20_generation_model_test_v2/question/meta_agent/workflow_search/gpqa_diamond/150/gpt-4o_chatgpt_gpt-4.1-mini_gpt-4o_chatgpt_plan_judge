Question: Example(question='The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1). An observable of the system is represented by the matrix operator P having elements in the first row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0),  in the second row as (1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}) and in the third row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0).

proposed answer: To find the probability that the measurement of the observable P yields the eigenvalue 0 when the system is in state |ψ⟩ = (-1, 2, 1), we follow the quantum mechanical procedure:

1. Normalize the state vector |ψ⟩:
   The norm ||ψ|| = sqrt((-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(1 + 4 + 1) = sqrt(6).
   So the normalized state vector is |ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6)(-1, 2, 1).

2. Identify the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0:
   From the eigenvalue problem, the eigenvector for λ=0 is proportional to (1, 0, -1).

3. Normalize this eigenvector:
   Norm = sqrt(1^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2).
   So the normalized eigenvector is |v_0⟩ = (1/√2)(1, 0, -1).

4. Calculate the projection amplitude of |ψ_norm⟩ onto |v_0⟩:
   ⟨v_0|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√2)(1, 0, -1) · (1/√6)(-1, 2, 1) = (1/√12)(-1 - 1) = -2/√12 = -1/√3.

5. The probability of measuring eigenvalue 0 is the square of the modulus of this amplitude:
   Probability = |⟨v_0|ψ_norm⟩|^2 = (1/√3)^2 = 1/3.

This calculation is consistent with the quantum mechanical postulate that the probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue is the squared magnitude of the projection of the normalized state vector onto the normalized eigenvector corresponding to that eigenvalue. All vectors are properly normalized, and the eigenvectors are orthogonal due to the Hermitian nature of the observable matrix P. Multiple independent analyses confirm this result. Therefore, the final probability is 1/3, corresponding to choice A).
