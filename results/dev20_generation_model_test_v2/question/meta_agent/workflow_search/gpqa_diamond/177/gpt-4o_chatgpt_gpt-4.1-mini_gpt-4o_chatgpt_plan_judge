proposed answer: The interaction Lagrangian is given by \( \mathcal{L}_{int} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu} \). In four-dimensional spacetime, the Lagrangian density must have mass dimension 4. The mass dimension of the Dirac spinor field \( \psi \) is 3/2, so its conjugate \( \bar{\psi} \) also has dimension 3/2. The sigma matrix \( \sigma_{\mu\nu} \), constructed from gamma matrices, is dimensionless. The field strength tensor \( F^{\mu\nu} \) has mass dimension 2. Adding these dimensions, the operator \( \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu} \) has total mass dimension \( 3/2 + 0 + 3/2 + 2 = 5 \). Since the Lagrangian density must have dimension 4, the coupling constant \( \kappa \) must have mass dimension \( 4 - 5 = -1 \). A coupling constant with negative mass dimension indicates a non-renormalizable interaction in four-dimensional quantum field theory because operators with dimension greater than four lead to divergences that cannot be absorbed by a finite number of counterterms. Therefore, the theory described by this Lagrangian is not renormalizable, and the mass dimension of \( \kappa \) is -1. Among the given options, only choice C) correctly states that \( [\kappa]_M = -1 \) and the theory is not renormalizable. This conclusion is consistent with standard quantum field theory principles and dimensional analysis, and no alternative interpretation of the field dimensions would change this result.
