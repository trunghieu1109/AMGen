proposed answer: In four-dimensional spacetime, the Lagrangian density must have mass dimension 4. The given interaction term is \( \mathcal{L}_{int} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu} \). The mass dimensions of the fields are: Dirac spinor \( \psi \) has dimension 3/2, so \( \bar{\psi} \) also has dimension 3/2; the matrix \( \sigma_{\mu\nu} \) is dimensionless; the gauge field strength tensor \( F^{\mu\nu} \) has dimension 2. Adding these, the operator \( \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu} \) has total mass dimension \( 3/2 + 3/2 + 2 = 5 \). To keep the Lagrangian density dimension 4, the coupling constant \( \kappa \) must have mass dimension \( 4 - 5 = -1 \). A coupling constant with negative mass dimension indicates a nonrenormalizable interaction by power counting in four dimensions. This is because such couplings lead to divergences that cannot be absorbed by a finite number of counterterms, making the theory nonrenormalizable in the traditional sense. This conclusion is consistent with standard quantum field theory principles and is supported by all expert analyses provided. Alternative choices with \( [\kappa]_M = 1 \) contradict the dimensional analysis and are therefore incorrect. Hence, the final and consistent conclusion is that the mass dimension of \( \kappa \) is -1 and the theory is not renormalizable.
