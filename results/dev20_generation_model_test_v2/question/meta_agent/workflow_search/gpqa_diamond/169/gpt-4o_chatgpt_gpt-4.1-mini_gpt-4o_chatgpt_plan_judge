proposed answer: The problem requires finding the expectation value of the spin operator S_y for an electron in the spin state |ψ⟩ = (3i, 4). The spin operator σ_y is given as a 2x2 matrix [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. The expectation value is calculated using the formula ⟨ψ|σ_y|ψ⟩, where |ψ⟩ must be normalized first. The norm squared of |ψ⟩ is |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = 9 + 16 = 25, so the normalized state is (3i/5, 4/5). Applying σ_y to the normalized state yields σ_y|ψ⟩ = (-4i/5, -3/5). The conjugate transpose ⟨ψ| is (-3i/5, 4/5). The inner product ⟨ψ|σ_y|ψ⟩ is (-3i/5)(-4i/5) + (4/5)(-3/5) = (12 i^2)/25 - 12/25 = -12/25 - 12/25 = -24/25. Since the spin operator corresponds to (ħ/2)σ_y, the expectation value is (-24/25)*(ħ/2) = -12 ħ / 25. This matches choice B) '-12*hbar/25'. All other choices either have incorrect magnitudes, signs, or ignore normalization. Multiple independent calculations and reasoning confirm this result. Therefore, the correct and consistent answer is B).
