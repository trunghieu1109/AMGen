Question: Example(question='An electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Find the expectation value of its spin along y-direction, S_y.\nNote: \\sigma_y (in latex format) is: \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & -i \\\\\ni & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}', choice1='-25*hbar/2\n\n', choice2='-12*hbar/25\n\n', choice3='12*hbar/25', choice4='25*hbar/2\n', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: The given spin state is |ψ⟩ = (3i, 4)ᵀ. To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, we use the operator S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y, where σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. First, normalize the state: the norm is sqrt(|3i|^2 + |4|^2) = sqrt(9 + 16) = 5, so the normalized state is (3i/5, 4/5). The conjugate transpose ⟨ψ| is (-3i/5, 4/5). Applying σ_y to |ψ⟩ gives σ_y|ψ⟩ = (-4i/5, -3/5). The inner product ⟨ψ|σ_y|ψ⟩ = (-3i/5)*(-4i/5) + (4/5)*(-3/5) = (12 i^2)/25 - 12/25 = -12/25 - 12/25 = -24/25. Multiplying by ħ/2 gives ⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2)(-24/25) = -12ħ/25. Comparing with the choices, this matches choice B) exactly. This calculation accounts for normalization, complex conjugation, and matrix multiplication correctly. No other choices match the computed value, and the result is physically consistent for a spin-1/2 system. Therefore, the final answer is B).
