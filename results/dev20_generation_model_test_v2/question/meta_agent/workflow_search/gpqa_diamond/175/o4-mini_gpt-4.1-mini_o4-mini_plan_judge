Question: Example(question='The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1), and the operators of two observables P and Q of the system are represented by two square matrices. The matrix corresponding to operator P has the elements in first row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0), elements in the second row as (1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}) and that in third row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0). The matrix operator for Q is represented by the square matrix having elements in the first row as (1, 0, 0), second row as (0, 0, 0) and third row as (0, 0, -1). Now, if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P, what is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements?', choice1='1/2', choice2='1/6', choice3='1/3', choice4='2/3', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: The problem involves sequential quantum measurements on a given initial state vector ψ = [-1, 2, 1]^T. First, we normalize ψ to ensure proper probability calculations. The norm squared of ψ is 1 + 4 + 1 = 6, so the normalized state is ψ_norm = [-1/√6, 2/√6, 1/√6]. Next, we consider the operator P and find its eigenspace corresponding to eigenvalue 0. Solving P|v⟩ = 0|v⟩ yields the eigenvector v = [-1, 0, 1]^T (or proportional to it). Normalizing v gives v_norm = [-1/√2, 0, 1/√2]. The projector onto this eigenspace is P_0 = |v_norm⟩⟨v_norm|. Applying P_0 to ψ_norm projects ψ onto the zero eigenspace of P, resulting in P_0ψ_norm = (⟨v_norm|ψ_norm⟩) v_norm. Calculating the inner product ⟨v_norm|ψ_norm⟩ = (-1/√2)(-1/√6) + 0 + (1/√2)(1/√6) = (1/√12) + (1/√12) = 2/√12 = 1/√3. Thus, P_0ψ_norm = (1/√3) * v_norm = (1/√3) * [-1/√2, 0, 1/√2] = [-1/√6, 0, 1/√6]. This is the collapsed state after measuring P=0. Next, measuring Q with eigenvalue -1 corresponds to projecting onto the third basis vector e3 = [0, 0, 1]^T. Applying this projector Q_{-1} to the collapsed state extracts the third component: 1/√6. The joint probability of measuring P=0 and then Q=-1 is the squared magnitude of this component, (1/√6)^2 = 1/6. This matches choice B). Alternative choices do not align with the detailed calculations and normalization steps. Therefore, the final answer is B).
