The naming and position of substituents suggest the product is trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate rather than the 2-substituted isomer, because the nucleophile attacks the β-carbon (the 3-position in the product). In the second reaction, 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine acts as a nucleophile attacking (E)-but-2-enenitrile under MeOH and acidic conditions, which likely leads to a Michael addition product with a hydroxy group on the cyclohexene ring, consistent with a 2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl substituent on butanenitrile.

Protonation in acidic medium favors the enol form, resulting in a 2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl substituent attached to the butanenitrile chain. The tautomeric equilibrium favors the enol form due to conjugation and hydrogen bonding possibilities. Regioselectivity is driven by nucleophilic attack at the β-carbon of the unsaturated nitrile.
