Question: Example(question='α-β unsaturated carbonyls have a much more electrophilic carbon double bond. These double bonds act as a good Lewis acid and react with nucleophiles to produce enolate ions. In this case, when a nucleophile attacks the β position, it produces a resonance-stabilized intermediate. When a nucleophile attacking the β-carbon is enolate, such reaction is known as the Michael reaction.\nWhat are the reactants and major final products of the following Michael addition reactions?\ndimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) -->(A)\n1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H3O+) --> (B)\nC + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H2O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice1='A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice2='A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice3='A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice4='A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: The Michael addition reactions involve nucleophilic attack at the β-carbon of α,β-unsaturated systems. For reaction A, dimethyl malonate forms an enolate that attacks methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate at the β-carbon, resulting in a trimethyl propane tricarboxylate with the p-tolyl substituent at the 3-position. This matches the product named trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate. For reaction B, 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine forms an enamine nucleophile that attacks (E)-but-2-enenitrile, and after acidic workup, the product is a hydroxy-substituted cyclohexene ring attached at the 3-position of butanenitrile, consistent with 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile. For reaction C, the nucleophile is cyclohexane-1,3-dione or its 2-hydroxy tautomer; the product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione, indicating the keto form predominates in the product. However, the nucleophile is likely the enol form (2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione) that undergoes Michael addition, which tautomerizes to the keto form in the final product. Among the choices, only choice 3 correctly assigns A as trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B as 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, and C as 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione. Other choices either misplace substituents or misassign keto/hydroxy tautomers, or do not align with the mechanistic pathways and product structures. Therefore, choice 3 best matches the mechanistic reasoning and product structures for all three reactions.

proposed answer: The Michael addition reactions described involve nucleophilic attack at the β-carbon of α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds, producing resonance-stabilized intermediates. For reaction A, dimethyl malonate acts as the nucleophile attacking methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate under basic conditions (NaOEt, EtOH). The product should be a trimethyl propane tricarboxylate with the p-tolyl substituent at the 3-position, consistent with Michael addition at the β-carbon. The ester groups remain intact, and the product is expected in the keto form. For reaction B, 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine reacts with (E)-but-2-enenitrile under acidic conditions (MeOH, H3O+). The piperidine forms an enamine intermediate that attacks the β-carbon of the unsaturated nitrile. Acidic workup favors the enol form of the cyclohexane ring, yielding 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile. For reaction C, the nucleophile is the enol form of cyclohexane-1,3-dione (2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione) attacking but-3-en-2-one under basic conditions (KOH, H2O). The product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione, the keto form, indicating tautomerization after Michael addition. Among the choices, only choice 3 correctly assigns the substitution pattern in A, the enol form in B, and the correct tautomeric form of C, aligning with the reaction conditions and expected outcomes. Other choices either misplace substituents or assign incorrect tautomeric forms. Therefore, choice 3 best fits the mechanistic and tautomeric considerations of the reactions described.
