proposed answer: The problem states that the number of stars per unit parallax interval varies as N(plx) ∝ 1/(plx^5). Given the inverse relationship between parallax and distance, plx = 1/r, substituting plx = 1/r into the expression gives N(plx) ∝ r^5. However, the question asks for the number of stars per unit distance interval, N(r). To convert from per unit parallax to per unit distance, we use the relation N(r) dr = N(plx) d(plx). Differentiating plx = 1/r with respect to r gives d(plx)/dr = -1/r^2, and taking the absolute value yields |d(plx)/dr| = 1/r^2. Therefore, N(r) = N(plx) * |d(plx)/dr| ∝ r^5 * (1/r^2) = r^3. This means the number of stars per unit distance interval scales as r^3. This result is consistent with the geometric intuition that in a fixed solid angle, the volume element scales as r^2 dr, so for a uniform density, the number of stars per unit distance would scale as r^2. The observed steeper dependence (r^3) suggests a non-uniform spatial distribution or observational bias. Considering all these points and the mathematical derivation, the best match among the given options is choice C).
