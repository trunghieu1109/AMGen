proposed answer: The problem states that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/(plx^5). Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance (r), i.e., plx = 1/r. Substituting this into the given relationship, the number of stars varies as 1/(1/r)^5 = 1/(r^-5) = r^5. This means the number of stars per unit range of distance increases as the fifth power of the distance. This is consistent with the physical interpretation that as we look further out, the number of stars increases rapidly with distance in this specific region of the sky. The other choices (~ r^2, ~ r^3, ~ r^4) do not match the given dependence on parallax. Therefore, the correct answer is D) ~ r^5.

proposed answer: The problem states that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/(plx^5). Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance r, i.e., plx = k/r for some constant k. Substituting plx = k/r into the given relation, the number of stars varies as 1/(k/r)^5 = r^5 / k^5, which simplifies to a proportionality ~ r^5. This suggests that the number of stars per unit range of parallax corresponds to r^5 when expressed in terms of distance. However, the problem asks for the number of stars per unit range of distance r, not per unit parallax. To convert from per unit parallax to per unit distance, we must consider the differential relationship between parallax and distance. Since plx = k/r, differentiating gives d(plx)/dr = -k/r^2. The number of stars per unit distance is related to the number per unit parallax by the chain rule: dN/dr = dN/d(plx) * |d(plx)/dr|. Given N(plx) ~ plx^{-5}, dN/d(plx) ~ -5 plx^{-6}. Substituting plx = k/r, dN/d(plx) ~ r^6. Multiplying by |d(plx)/dr| = k/r^2, the number of stars per unit distance varies as r^6 * (1/r^2) = r^4. Therefore, the number of stars per unit distance varies as r^4, corresponding to choice B). This detailed differential consideration is necessary because the problem specifies the number of stars per unit range of distance, not per unit parallax. Hence, the correct answer is B).
