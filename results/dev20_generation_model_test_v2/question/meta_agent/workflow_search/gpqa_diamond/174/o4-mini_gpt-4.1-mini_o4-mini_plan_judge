proposed answer: The problem involves an oscillating charge distribution shaped like a spheroid with symmetry along the z-axis, radiating electromagnetic waves at wavelength λ. The radiation pattern in the far field is dominated by electric dipole radiation, which has an angular dependence proportional to sin^2(θ). The maximum power A is radiated at θ = 90°, where sin^2(90°) = 1. At θ = 30°, sin^2(30°) = (1/2)^2 = 1/4, so the fraction of the maximum power radiated at 30° is 1/4. This fraction is purely angular and independent of wavelength. Regarding wavelength dependence, classical electrodynamics states that the power radiated by an electric dipole is proportional to ω^4, where ω is the angular frequency. Since ω = 2πc/λ, the power scales as λ^(-4). Higher multipole contributions like quadrupole radiation scale as λ^(-6), but these do not match the angular fraction observed. Therefore, the function f(λ, θ) is proportional to λ^(-4) and the fraction of maximum power at θ = 30° is 1/4. Among the given choices, choice 3 (1/4, λ^(-4)) exactly matches this analysis. Other choices either have incorrect angular fractions or incorrect wavelength exponents. Hence, the correct answer is choice 3 (C).

proposed answer: The problem involves an oscillating spheroidal charge distribution with symmetry along the z-axis, radiating electromagnetic waves at wavelength λ. The radiation pattern in the far field is expected to resemble that of a dipole oriented along the z-axis, since the spheroid symmetry suggests a dominant dipolar component. The classical dipole radiation pattern has angular dependence proportional to sin^2(θ), with maximum radiation at θ=90° (equator) and zero along the axis (θ=0° or 180°). The maximum power A corresponds to θ=90°. The fraction of this maximum power at θ=30° is sin^2(30°)/sin^2(90°) = (1/2)^2 / 1 = 1/4. This fraction is independent of wavelength λ because it is a ratio of angular factors only. The wavelength dependence of dipole radiation power scales as the fourth power of frequency, or equivalently λ^(-4). This matches the known classical result that radiated power ∝ ω^4 ∝ λ^(-4). Among the given options, only choice 3 has the fraction 1/4 and the wavelength dependence λ^(-4), which aligns perfectly with the dipole radiation characteristics from a spheroidal oscillating charge distribution. Other choices either have incorrect fractions or incorrect wavelength exponents, inconsistent with classical electrodynamics. Therefore, the correct answer is choice 3.
