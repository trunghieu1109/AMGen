proposed answer: The problem involves an oscillating spheroidal charge distribution symmetric about the z-axis, radiating electromagnetic waves at wavelength \lambda. The radiated power per unit solid angle depends on both \lambda and the angle \theta relative to the z-axis. Classical electromagnetic theory for such oscillating charge distributions, especially dipole-like radiation, shows that the angular dependence of the radiated power follows a sin^2(\theta) pattern. The maximum power A occurs at \theta = 90^\circ where sin^2(90^\circ) = 1. Evaluating the power fraction at \theta = 30^\circ gives sin^2(30^\circ) = (1/2)^2 = 1/4. Thus, the power fraction at 30 degrees relative to the maximum is 1/4. This matches choices 3 and 4. Regarding wavelength dependence, dipole radiation power scales as \lambda^{-4}, consistent with the known frequency dependence of radiated power (power ~ \omega^4, and \omega = 2\pi c / \lambda). Higher powers like \lambda^{-6} correspond to higher multipole radiation and are less likely here, while \lambda^{-3} is inconsistent with standard radiation laws. Therefore, the physically consistent form for f is proportional to \lambda^{-4} with the angular factor yielding a fraction 1/4 at 30 degrees. This corresponds to choice 3: '1/4, \lambda^{-4}'. This conclusion is supported by classical electromagnetic radiation theory, the angular dependence of dipole radiation patterns, and the known scaling of radiated power with wavelength. Hence, choice 3 (C) is the most consistent and correct answer.

proposed answer: The oscillating charge distribution is spheroidal with symmetry along the z-axis, which implies that the dipole moment is zero due to symmetry. Therefore, the leading multipole moment responsible for radiation is the quadrupole moment (l=2). The power radiated by a multipole moment of order l scales with wavelength as λ^{-(2l+2)}. For the quadrupole moment, this scaling is λ^{-6}. The angular distribution of the radiated power for a quadrupole oriented along the z-axis typically follows a sin^2(2θ) dependence. Evaluating this at θ=30° gives sin^2(60°) = (√3/2)^2 = 3/4. This means the power radiated at θ=30° is 3/4 of the maximum power A. Other options either have incorrect wavelength dependence (such as λ^{-4} or λ^{-3}) or incorrect angular fractions (such as 1/2 or 1/4). The dipole radiation pattern, which scales as λ^{-4} and has angular dependence sin^2θ, is ruled out due to the symmetry eliminating the dipole moment. Higher multipoles would have even stronger wavelength dependence and more complex angular patterns, which are not indicated here. Therefore, the fraction of the maximum radiated power at θ=30° is 3/4, corresponding to choice B).
