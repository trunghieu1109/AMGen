proposed answer: The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, which requires precise regiocontrol to place the tert-butyl group at position 2, the ethoxy group at position 1, and the nitro group at position 3 on the benzene ring. Starting from benzene, the tert-butyl group is strongly activating and ortho/para directing, so it should be introduced first via Friedel–Crafts alkylation (tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3). This step sets the directing influence for subsequent substitutions. Next, nitration (HNO3/H2SO4) introduces the nitro group; however, direct nitration after tert-butylation would favor ortho/para positions relative to tert-butyl, which may not give the desired substitution pattern. To control regioselectivity, a blocking group strategy is employed using sulfonation (SO3/H2SO4) as a temporary blocking group to direct nitration to the desired position. Reduction of the nitro group to an amine (Fe/HCl) allows for diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) and hydrolysis (H3O+, heat) to convert the amine to phenol. The phenol is then converted to the ethoxy group via Williamson ether synthesis (NaOH/EtBr). Finally, desulfonation (dilute H2SO4) removes the sulfonic acid blocking group. Among the options, only choice A) includes all these steps in a logical and effective order that respects directing effects, uses blocking groups for regioselectivity, and performs functional group interconversions necessary to install the ethoxy substituent at position 1. Other options either start with nitration or sulfonation in a way that complicates regioselectivity or have steps in an order that would reduce yield or cause substitution difficulties. Therefore, choice A) is the best sequence considering regiocontrol, step economy, and overall yield for synthesizing 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.

proposed answer: The target molecule 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene requires precise regiochemical control to place the ethoxy group at position 1, tert-butyl at position 2 (ortho to ethoxy), and nitro at position 3 (meta to ethoxy). Starting from benzene, the synthetic route must consider the directing effects of substituents and the order of functional group transformations to achieve high yield and correct substitution pattern. Friedel–Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 introduces a strongly activating, ortho/para directing tert-butyl group first. This step is crucial because it sets the stage for nitration to occur meta to tert-butyl, which aligns with the desired nitro position relative to ethoxy. Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4) follows, introducing the nitro group at the correct position. The nitro group is then reduced to an amino group (Fe/HCl), which is strongly activating and ortho/para directing, enabling diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) to form a diazonium salt. Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt (H3O+, H2O/heat) yields a phenol intermediate, which is converted to the ethoxy group via Williamson ether synthesis (NaOH/EtBr). Sulfonation (SO3/H2SO4) and desulfonation (dilute H2SO4) steps serve as reversible blocking groups to prevent undesired substitution and improve regioselectivity and yield. Evaluating the given sequences: Choice A) follows this logical order, installing tert-butyl first, then nitro, reduction, diazotization, hydrolysis, ether formation, and finally sulfonation/desulfonation. Although there is a repeated nitration step in Choice A), it is likely a typographical error or redundant, and the overall sequence is sound. Choices B), C), and D) either misorder key steps, introduce unnecessary repetitions, or start with poorly directed nitration, which would reduce yield and complicate regioselectivity. The sulfonation step is best placed after the key substitutions to act as a blocking group without interfering with initial electrophilic aromatic substitutions. Therefore, considering regiochemical fidelity, step economy, and yield potential, Choice A) is the optimal synthetic sequence for the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene.
