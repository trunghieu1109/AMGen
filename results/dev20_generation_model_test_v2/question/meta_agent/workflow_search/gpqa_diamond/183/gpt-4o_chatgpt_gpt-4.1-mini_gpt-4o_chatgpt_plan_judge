proposed answer: The target molecule 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene requires three substituents on the benzene ring: a tert-butyl group at position 2, an ethoxy group at position 1, and a nitro group at position 3. Starting from benzene, the synthetic route must carefully control the order of electrophilic aromatic substitutions and functional group transformations to achieve these substitutions with high yield and correct regioselectivity. The tert-butyl group is bulky and ortho/para directing and activating, so it should be introduced first via Friedel-Crafts alkylation (tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3). This step activates the ring and directs subsequent substitutions ortho and para to the tert-butyl group. Next, nitration (HNO3/H2SO4) introduces the nitro group meta to the tert-butyl group, which corresponds to position 3. The nitro group is strongly deactivating and meta directing, so it is introduced after the activating tert-butyl group. Then, reduction of the nitro group to an amino group (Fe/HCl) is necessary to enable diazotization. Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) followed by hydrolysis (H3O+, heat) converts the amino group into a phenol at position 3. The phenol is then converted into the ethoxy group via Williamson ether synthesis (NaOH/EtBr). Sulfonation (SO3/H2SO4) and desulfonation (dilute H2SO4) steps are used as blocking and deblocking groups to control regioselectivity and prevent substitution at undesired positions, improving yield and selectivity. The sequence in choice 1 aligns well with this logic: it starts with tert-butylation, followed by nitration, reduction, further nitration/diazotization/hydrolysis, ether formation, and includes sulfonation and desulfonation steps appropriately. Other choices misplace key steps such as sulfonation before tert-butylation or nitration before alkylation, or do not follow the necessary reduction-diazonium-hydrolysis-ether formation sequence properly. Therefore, choice A) is the best sequence for high-yield synthesis of the target compound, considering directing effects, reaction conditions, and necessary functional group transformations.

proposed answer: The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, starting from benzene. The synthesis requires the introduction of three substituents: tert-butyl, ethoxy, and nitro groups, at specific positions on the benzene ring. The tert-butyl group is a bulky, strongly activating ortho/para director, the nitro group is a strongly deactivating meta director, and the ethoxy group is introduced via Williamson ether synthesis from a phenol intermediate. The optimal synthetic strategy involves: 1) Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 to introduce the tert-butyl group first. This step is crucial because the tert-butyl group activates the ring and directs subsequent electrophilic substitution to the ortho and para positions relative to itself. 2) Nitration with HNO3/H2SO4 to introduce the nitro group meta to the tert-butyl substituent, which corresponds to position 3 on the ring, matching the target molecule. Introducing the nitro group first would deactivate the ring and hinder Friedel-Crafts alkylation, so this order is important. 3) Reduction of the nitro group to an amino group using Fe/HCl, enabling further functional group transformations. 4) Diazotization of the amino group with NaNO2/HCl to form a diazonium salt. 5) Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt with H3O+, H2O/heat to convert it into a phenol at position 1. 6) Williamson ether synthesis with NaOH/EtBr to convert the phenol into the ethoxy group. This sequence avoids sulfonation and desulfonation steps, which are unnecessary here and would complicate the synthesis and reduce yield. The directing effects of the tert-butyl group sufficiently control regioselectivity, making blocking groups unnecessary. This sequence ensures the correct substitution pattern, functional group compatibility, and high yield. Among the given options, choice A follows this logical and efficient sequence, introducing substituents in the correct order and avoiding unnecessary steps. Therefore, choice A is the best sequence for the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.
