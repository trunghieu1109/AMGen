Question: Example(question='While designing a high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating at an accelerating voltage of 1000 kV, Mike connected vacuum pumps to create an ultra-high vacuum state (< 10^-9 Torr) in the sample compartment, aiming to minimize the presence of gas molecules for improved electron microscopy. However, as expected, some gas particles remained inside the compartment, as detected by the mass spectrometer. Mike accurately determined the mean free path of these gas molecules in the vacuum state (< 10^-9 Torr) to be λ1, based on factors such as sample compartment volume, pressure, and temperature. However, upon initiating the electron beam, he made an intriguing observation concerning the mean free path based on electron scattering with the gas molecules. He found that the mean free path was no longer equal to λ1; rather, it was λ2, even though the sample compartment temperature remained the same.\n\nWhat can we conclude about λ2 based on the aforementioned scenario?', choice1="λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation", choice2='λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1', choice3='λ2 < λ1', choice4='λ2 >= 1.22*λ1', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: The mean free path λ1 is defined as the average distance a gas molecule travels before colliding with another gas molecule under ultra-high vacuum conditions (< 10^-9 Torr) at a constant temperature. This depends on the gas density, pressure, and temperature, all of which remain constant in the scenario. When the electron beam is initiated, the scattering events considered change from molecule-molecule collisions to electron-gas molecule collisions. Electrons, being much lighter and charged particles, interact electromagnetically with gas molecules, leading to a larger scattering cross-section compared to neutral gas molecules colliding with each other. This results in electrons scattering more frequently, effectively reducing their mean free path λ2 compared to λ1. Since the temperature and gas conditions remain constant, the only factor that changes is the scattering particle (electrons instead of gas molecules), which leads to λ2 < λ1. Options suggesting λ2 equals or exceeds λ1 contradict the physics of electron scattering under these conditions. Therefore, the most physically consistent conclusion is that λ2 is less than λ1.
