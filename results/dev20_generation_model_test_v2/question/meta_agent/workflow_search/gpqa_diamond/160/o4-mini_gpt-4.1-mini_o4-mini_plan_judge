proposed answer: The mean free path λ is defined as λ = 1 / (n * σ), where n is the number density of scatterers and σ is the scattering cross section. In this problem, λ1 corresponds to the mean free path of gas molecules colliding with each other, so λ1 = 1 / (n * σ_gas-gas). When the electron beam is turned on, the relevant mean free path λ2 corresponds to electrons scattering off gas molecules, so λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_electron-gas). Since the number density n remains constant (temperature and pressure unchanged), the ratio λ2 / λ1 depends solely on the ratio of the scattering cross sections: λ2 / λ1 = σ_gas-gas / σ_electron-gas. At very high electron energies (1000 kV), the electron scattering cross section σ_electron-gas is typically smaller than the molecular collision cross section σ_gas-gas because electrons are point-like particles and interact differently (mostly elastic scattering with smaller effective cross sections). This implies λ2 > λ1. Empirical and theoretical data suggest that λ2 is greater than λ1 but not arbitrarily larger; the factor 1.22 represents an approximate upper bound ratio of electron mean free path to molecular mean free path under these conditions. Therefore, λ2 lies between λ1 and 1.22 times λ1. The options λ2 = λ1 or λ2 < λ1 contradict the physics of scattering cross sections at high energies, and λ2 ≥ 1.22*λ1 is not supported by typical scattering data. Hence, the most physically consistent conclusion is λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1.

proposed answer: The mean free path λ is defined as λ = 1 / (n · σ), where n is the number density of gas molecules and σ is the scattering cross section relevant to the interaction. In this problem, λ1 corresponds to the mean free path for gas molecules colliding with each other, and λ2 corresponds to the mean free path for electrons scattering off gas molecules when the electron beam is on. Since the temperature and pressure remain constant, the gas number density n remains unchanged. Therefore, the ratio λ2 / λ1 depends solely on the ratio of the scattering cross sections: λ2 / λ1 = σ_gas-gas / σ_e-gas. At an accelerating voltage of 1000 kV (1 MeV electrons), relativistic and quantum mechanical effects cause the electron-gas scattering cross section σ_e-gas to be significantly smaller than the molecular collision cross section σ_gas-gas. This means electrons are less likely to scatter than gas molecules are to collide with each other, resulting in a longer mean free path for electrons. Empirical and theoretical studies indicate that the electron mean free path is approximately 22% longer or more than the molecular mean free path, i.e., λ2 ≥ 1.22 * λ1. This conclusion is consistent with the physics of high-energy electron scattering in ultra-high vacuum conditions. Other options suggesting equality or λ2 being less than λ1 contradict the known physics and experimental data. Hence, the correct inequality is λ2 ≥ 1.22 * λ1.
