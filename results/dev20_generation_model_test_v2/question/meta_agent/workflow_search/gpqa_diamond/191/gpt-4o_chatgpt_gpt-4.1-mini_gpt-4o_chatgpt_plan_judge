Question: Example(question='Imagine an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ having a small spherical cavity inside. The centre of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the centre of the spherical conductor. The radius of the cavity is $r$, and $r<R$.

What is the magnitude of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at a point P (outside the spherical conductor) of distance $L$ from the centre of the spherical conductor? Note, the distance of the point P from the centre of the cavity is $l$. Here, l, L > R.

proposed answer: When a positive charge +q is placed inside a cavity within an uncharged spherical conductor, the conductor rearranges its free charges to maintain electrostatic equilibrium. The key points are: 1) The electric field inside the conductor's material must be zero, so an induced charge of -q appears on the inner surface of the cavity to cancel the field from the charge +q inside the cavity. 2) To maintain the overall neutrality of the conductor, an equal positive charge +q appears on the outer surface of the conductor. 3) Due to the spherical symmetry of the outer surface, this induced positive charge +q distributes uniformly over the outer surface. 4) From outside the conductor, the electric field behaves as if the entire charge +q is concentrated at the center of the spherical conductor, regardless of the position of the charge inside the cavity. 5) The offset s of the cavity and the angle θ do not influence the external electric field because the conductor shields the external region from the internal charge distribution details. Therefore, the electric field at point P (distance L from the center of the conductor, with L > R) is given by Coulomb's law for a point charge +q located at the center of the spherical conductor, i.e., E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q / L²). Hence, the correct expression for the magnitude of the electric field at point P is the one involving L, the distance from the center of the conductor, and not l or any combination involving s or θ. This conclusion is consistent with the principle of electrostatic shielding and the uniqueness theorem in electrostatics, which states that the external field depends only on the total charge and its distribution on the outer surface, which is spherically symmetric and equivalent to a point charge at the center. Therefore, the correct choice is D).
