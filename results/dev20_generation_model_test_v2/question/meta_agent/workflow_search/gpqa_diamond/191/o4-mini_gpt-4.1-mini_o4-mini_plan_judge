proposed answer: The problem involves a neutral spherical conductor with a spherical cavity inside it, offset by a distance s from the conductor's center. A point charge +q is placed inside the cavity. The question asks for the magnitude of the electric field at a point P outside the conductor, at distance L from the conductor's center. Since the conductor is neutral and in electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field inside the conductor's material is zero. The presence of the charge +q inside the cavity induces surface charges on the cavity's inner surface and on the conductor's outer surface, which rearrange to maintain zero field inside the conductor and overall neutrality. By Gauss's law, any Gaussian surface outside the conductor encloses a net charge +q, as the induced charges sum to zero net charge. This implies that from outside the conductor, the system behaves as if a point charge +q is located at the conductor's center. The offset s of the cavity and the angle θ do not affect the external field, which depends only on the total charge +q and the distance L from the conductor's center. The distance l (from cavity center to P) and the angle θ are irrelevant to the external field because the conductor redistributes charges to produce an external field equivalent to that of a point charge at its center. Therefore, the electric field magnitude at point P is given by Coulomb's law for charge +q located at the conductor's center, E = (1/(4πε₀)) (q / L²). This corresponds to choice D. Hence, the correct answer is D.
