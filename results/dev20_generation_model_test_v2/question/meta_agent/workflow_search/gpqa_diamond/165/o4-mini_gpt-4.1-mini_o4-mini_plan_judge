proposed answer: The mass squared of the pseudo-Goldstone boson H_2 arises from one-loop radiative corrections involving all particles that couple to the scalar fields φ and h, which have vacuum expectation values x and v respectively. The effective potential contributions come from both bosons and fermions, with bosons contributing positively and fermions negatively due to their quantum statistics. The relevant bosonic contributors include the SM-like Higgs h_1, W and Z gauge bosons, charged scalar H^±, neutral scalar H^0, and pseudoscalar A^0. The fermionic contributors include the top quark t and heavy singlet neutrinos N_i. The top quark must be included because of its large Yukawa coupling to the Higgs sector, significantly affecting the effective potential and thus the mass of H_2. Heavy neutrinos also contribute negatively, summed over all species. The normalization factor 1/(8π²(x² + v²)) arises naturally from the kinetic term normalization of the pseudo-Goldstone boson, which is a mixture of φ and h fields. Among the four choices, only choice C includes all these contributions correctly with appropriate signs and normalization: positive contributions from h_1, W, Z, H^±, H^0, A^0; negative contributions from t and the sum over N_i; and the denominator (x² + v²). Choice A omits the top quark and includes A^0 with a positive sign but lacks the top quark contribution, which is essential. Choice B includes the top quark but omits A^0, which should be included as it contributes to the scalar sector loops. Choice D incorrectly places the factor (x² + v²) in the numerator instead of the denominator, which is inconsistent with the kinetic normalization and dimensional analysis. Therefore, choice C best matches the physically complete and consistent formula for the radiative mass squared of the pseudo-Goldstone boson H_2.
