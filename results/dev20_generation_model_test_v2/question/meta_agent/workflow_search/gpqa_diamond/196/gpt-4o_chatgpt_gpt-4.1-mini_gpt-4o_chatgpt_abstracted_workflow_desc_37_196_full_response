The peaks at 1610 cm-1 and 1450 cm-1 correspond to aromatic C=C stretching and C-H bending, confirming the presence of an aromatic ring. The 1H NMR data shows a broad singlet at 10.5 ppm (1H), consistent with the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid.

The aliphatic signals at 2.9 ppm (multiplet, 1H), 1.7 ppm (multiplet, 2H), 1.4 ppm (doublet, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (triplet, 3H) match the pattern of a sec-butyl group attached to the aromatic ring. This supports the structure of Compound X as 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI typically converts carboxylic acids to the corresponding methyl-substituted aromatic compounds by reducing the acid group. Thus, the carboxylic acid group is reduced to a methyl group while the sec-butyl substituent remains unchanged. Therefore, the final product after this reaction is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. The other options either do not fit the spectral data or do not correspond to the expected reaction outcome.

The aromatic C=C stretches at 1610 cm-1 and 1450 cm-1 confirm an aromatic ring. The 1H NMR data supports this: a broad singlet at 10.5 ppm corresponds to the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid, and two doublets at 8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm (each integrating to 2H) indicate a para-substituted benzene ring. The aliphatic signals (2.9 ppm multiplet for 1H, 1.7 ppm multiplet for 2H, 1.4 ppm doublet for 3H, and 0.9 ppm triplet for 3H) match a sec-butyl group attached to the ring. Thus, Compound X is consistent with 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. When reacted with red phosphorus and HI, carboxylic acids are typically reduced to methyl groups on the aromatic ring by conversion to an acyl iodide intermediate and subsequent reduction. This reaction removes the carboxylic acid group and replaces it with a methyl group, while the sec-butyl group remains intact. Therefore, the final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.

The aliphatic signals correspond well to a sec-butyl group. When 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid is treated with red phosphorus and HI, the reaction environment is strongly reducing. Red phosphorus and HI generate phosphorus triiodide (PI3) in situ, which converts carboxylic acids into alkyl iodides via acyl iodide intermediates. Under these conditions, the carboxylic acid group is reduced, typically to a methyl group or replaced by hydrogen, effectively removing the acid functionality.

This analysis aligns with the presence of a 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid structure.; answer: B)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent M1T9, interpreting reaction, thinking: The reaction of Compound X, identified as 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, with red phosphorus and HI typically leads to the reduction of the carboxylic acid group. Red phosphorus and HI together generate phosphorus triiodide (PI3) in situ, which converts carboxylic acids into alkyl iodides via an acyl iodide intermediate. However, under strongly reducing conditions, the carboxylic acid can be fully reduced to the corresponding alkane or alkyl-substituted benzene. Given that the initial compound is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, the carboxylic acid group at the para position is likely replaced by a hydrogen atom, resulting in a para-sec-butyl-substituted benzene ring without the acid functionality. This transformation aligns with the known reaction where aromatic carboxylic acids are reduced to the corresponding aromatic hydrocarbons when treated with red phosphorus and HI. Therefore, the final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene if the methyl group is retained or simply 1-(sec-butyl)benzene if the methyl is not present. Among the given choices, 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene corresponds to the product where the carboxylic acid is reduced to a methyl group or replaced by hydrogen, and the sec-butyl group remains attached. The other options either retain the acid functionality or have different substituents inconsistent with the reaction. Hence, the final product after the reaction with red phosphorus and HI is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.; answer: A)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent uU0Q, interpreting reaction, thinking: Compound X is identified as 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid based on the IR and NMR data indicating a carboxylic acid group and a para-substituted benzene ring with a sec-butyl group. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI is a known method for reducing carboxylic acids to alkyl halides. Specifically, red phosphorus and HI convert the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) into an alkyl iodide (-CH2I) by replacing the -OH group and reducing the carbonyl carbon to a methylene group attached to iodine. The aromatic ring and sec-butyl substituent generally remain unchanged under these conditions. Therefore, the final product is expected to be the corresponding benzyl iodide derivative of the sec-butylbenzene, where the carboxylic acid has been replaced by a -CH2I group. Among the given options, none explicitly mention an iodide product; however, the original compound is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option B). The question asks for the final product after reaction with red phosphorus and HI, which would be the reduction product. Since this is a common reaction converting benzoic acids to benzyl iodides, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzyl iodide, which is not listed. Given the options, none correctly represent the final product after the reaction. Therefore, the best interpretation is that the reaction reduces the acid to the corresponding sec-butylbenzyl iodide, and none of the provided options represent this product. However, since the question is to identify the final product and the only carboxylic acid compound is option B, the initial compound is B, and the reaction product is a benzyl iodide derivative of B. Hence, the transformation involves conversion of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid to 4-(sec-butyl)benzyl iodide via red phosphorus and HI. This is a well-established reaction pathway in organic chemistry.; answer: B)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent XYqr, interpreting reaction, thinking: The reaction of Compound X, which is identified as 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, with red phosphorus and HI typically leads to reduction or halogenation reactions. Red phosphorus and HI together form a strong reducing environment and are known to convert carboxylic acids into alkyl halides by first converting the acid to an acyl iodide intermediate, which then undergoes further reduction to the corresponding alkyl iodide. In this case, the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH3), effectively removing the carboxylic acid functionality and leaving the aromatic ring substituted with a sec-butyl group at the para position and a methyl group where the acid was originally located. However, since the acid is at the para position and the sec-butyl is also at the para position, the reduction will replace the carboxylic acid with a methyl group, resulting in 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. This matches choice A. Other choices either retain the acid group or have different alkyl substituents inconsistent with the spectral data and reaction outcome. Therefore, the final product after reaction with red phosphorus and HI is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.; answer: A)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent sg66, evaluating structural variants, thinking: The IR spectrum of Compound X shows a broad peak from 3400–2500 cm-1, which is characteristic of the O-H stretch in carboxylic acids. The strong peak at 1720 cm-1 corresponds to the C=O stretch of a carboxylic acid carbonyl group. The peaks at 1610 cm-1 and 1450 cm-1 suggest aromatic C=C stretches and C-H bending vibrations, indicating the presence of an aromatic ring. The 1H NMR spectrum shows a broad singlet at 10.5 ppm, consistent with the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid. The aromatic protons appear as two doublets at 8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm, each integrating to 2H, indicating a para-substituted benzene ring. The aliphatic region shows signals at 2.9 ppm (multiplet, 1H), 1.7 ppm (multiplet, 2H), 1.4 ppm (doublet, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (triplet, 3H), which are consistent with a sec-butyl group attached to the aromatic ring. Given these spectral features, the most consistent structure for Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, i.e., a para-substituted benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group. Considering the reaction with red phosphorus and HI, which is known to reduce carboxylic acids to methyl groups via formation of acyl iodide intermediates and subsequent reduction, the carboxylic acid group would be converted to a methyl substituent. The sec-butyl group remains unchanged due to its stability under these conditions. Therefore, the final product would be a para-substituted benzene with a sec-butyl group and a methyl group, corresponding to 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. Other options such as 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (the starting compound), 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid, or 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene do not fit the spectral data or the expected reaction outcome. Hence, based on the identified functional groups, spectral data, and reaction context, the structural variant of Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.; answer: B)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent 784J, evaluating structural variants, thinking: The IR spectrum of Compound X shows a broad peak between 3400–2500 cm-1 and a strong peak at 1720 cm-1, indicating the presence of a carboxylic acid group (O-H stretch and C=O stretch respectively). The peak at 1610 cm-1 suggests aromatic C=C stretching, and the 1450 cm-1 peak corresponds to C-H bending, typical in hydrocarbons. The 1H NMR spectrum supports this: a broad singlet at 10.5 ppm corresponds to the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid; aromatic protons appear as two doublets at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm (each integrating to 2H), consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring. The aliphatic region shows signals at 2.9 ppm (multiplet, 1H), 1.7 ppm (multiplet, 2H), 1.4 ppm (doublet, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (triplet, 3H), consistent with a sec-butyl group attached to the aromatic ring. Therefore, Compound X is most likely 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, with the carboxylic acid and sec-butyl substituents para to each other on the benzene ring. Considering the reaction with red phosphorus and HI, which generates phosphorus triiodide (PI3) in situ, the carboxylic acid group is converted to an alkyl iodide intermediate and then reduced, typically to a methyl group on the aromatic ring. This reaction removes the acidic functionality but leaves the sec-butyl substituent intact. Other structural variants, such as 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid, or 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene, do not fit all spectral data as well: the presence of a carboxylic acid proton and the specific aromatic proton splitting pattern indicate a para-substituted benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group, not an ethyl or isobutyl group or a methyl substituent instead of acid. Thus, based on the functional groups identified and the reaction context, the structural variant of Compound X before reaction is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.; answer: B)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent zTGo, evaluating structural variants, thinking: The IR data shows a broad peak from 3400–2500 cm-1, which is characteristic of an O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid group, and a sharp peak at 1720 cm-1, indicative of a C=O stretch in a carbonyl group, confirming the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group in Compound X. The 1610 cm-1 and 1450 cm-1 peaks suggest aromatic C=C and C-H bending vibrations, respectively, indicating an aromatic ring. The 1H NMR data shows a broad singlet at 10.5 ppm for 1H, consistent with the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid. The aromatic protons appear as two doublets (8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm, each integrating to 2H), consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring. The aliphatic region shows signals (2.9 ppm multiplet for 1H, 1.7 ppm multiplet for 2H, 1.4 ppm doublet for 3H, and 0.9 ppm triplet for 3H) consistent with a sec-butyl side chain. Therefore, Compound X is likely 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, having a para-substituted benzene ring with a sec-butyl group and a carboxylic acid group. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI is known to reduce carboxylic acids to methyl groups on aromatic rings by first converting the acid to an acyl iodide intermediate and then reducing it. This reaction typically removes the carboxylic acid group and replaces it with a methyl group, while the sec-butyl substituent remains unchanged. Other possibilities such as alkylation or retention of the acid group are less consistent with the reaction conditions and spectral data. Thus, the structural variant of Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which upon reaction yields 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. This evaluation considers the functional groups identified by IR and NMR, the nature of the aromatic substitution pattern, and the known chemistry of red phosphorus and HI with carboxylic acids.; answer: B)\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent 3yZ1, round 0, selecting final product, thinking: The IR spectrum of Compound X shows a broad peak between 3400–2500 cm-1 and a strong peak at 1720 cm-1, which are indicative of a carboxylic acid functional group (O-H stretch and C=O stretch respectively). The peaks at 1610 cm-1 and 1450 cm-1 correspond to aromatic C=C stretching and C-H bending, confirming the presence of an aromatic ring. The 1H NMR data shows a broad singlet at 10.5 ppm (1H), consistent with the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid. The aromatic protons appear as two doublets at 8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm, each integrating to 2H, indicating a para-substituted benzene ring. The aliphatic signals at 2.9 ppm (multiplet, 1H), 1.7 ppm (multiplet, 2H), 1.4 ppm (doublet, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (triplet, 3H) match the pattern of a sec-butyl group attached to the aromatic ring. This supports the structure of Compound X as 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI typically converts carboxylic acids to the corresponding methyl-substituted aromatic compounds by reducing the acid group. Thus, the carboxylic acid group is reduced to a methyl group while the sec-butyl substituent remains unchanged. Therefore, the final product after this reaction is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.

The aromatic C=C stretches at 1610 cm-1 and 1450 cm-1 confirm an aromatic ring.

Thus, Compound X is consistent with 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. When reacted with red phosphorus and HI, carboxylic acids are typically reduced to methyl groups on the aromatic ring by conversion to an acyl iodide intermediate and subsequent reduction. This reaction removes the carboxylic acid group and replaces it with a methyl group, while the sec-butyl group remains intact. Therefore, the final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.
