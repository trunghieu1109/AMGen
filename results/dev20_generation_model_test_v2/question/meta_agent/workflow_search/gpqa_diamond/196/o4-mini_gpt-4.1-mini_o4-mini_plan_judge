proposed answer: The IR spectrum of compound X shows a broad band from 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ and a sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which are characteristic of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). The bands at 1610 and 1450 cm⁻¹ indicate aromatic C=C stretches, confirming the presence of an aromatic ring. The 1H NMR data show a broad singlet at 10.5 ppm (acid proton), two doublets at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm (each integrating to 2H), consistent with a para-disubstituted benzene ring. The aliphatic signals at 2.9 ppm (multiplet, 1H), 1.7 ppm (multiplet, 2H), 1.4 ppm (doublet, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (triplet, 3H) correspond well to a sec-butyl group side chain. Among the given choices, only 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (choice B) matches this substitution pattern and functional groups. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI is known to reduce carboxylic acids to the corresponding hydrocarbons by replacing the -COOH group with hydrogen, effectively converting 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid into 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene (choice A). This is because the acid group is removed and replaced by a methyl group on the aromatic ring, while the sec-butyl substituent remains intact. The other choices either lack the acid group initially or do not fit the spectral data. Therefore, the final product after the reaction with red P/HI is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene (choice A). This conclusion is supported by multiple agents' analyses and is consistent with known chemical transformations and spectral data.
