proposed answer: The IR spectrum of Compound X shows a broad peak from 3400–2500 cm-1 and a strong peak at 1720 cm-1, which are characteristic of the O-H stretch and C=O stretch of a carboxylic acid group, respectively. The peaks at 1610 cm-1 and 1450 cm-1 indicate aromatic C=C stretching and C-H bending, confirming the presence of an aromatic ring. The 1H NMR spectrum shows a broad singlet at 10.5 ppm, consistent with the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid. The aromatic protons appear as two doublets at 8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm, each integrating to 2H, indicating a para-substituted benzene ring. The aliphatic signals at 2.9 ppm (multiplet, 1H), 1.7 ppm (multiplet, 2H), 1.4 ppm (doublet, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (triplet, 3H) correspond well to a sec-butyl group attached to the aromatic ring. This data strongly supports that Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI is known to reduce carboxylic acids to methyl groups on aromatic rings by first converting the acid to an acyl iodide intermediate and then reducing it. This reaction removes the carboxylic acid group and replaces it with a methyl group, while the sec-butyl substituent remains intact. Therefore, the final product after reaction is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. Other options either do not fit the spectral data or the expected reaction outcome. Hence, the most consistent and correct structural evaluation for Compound X before reaction is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, and the final product after reaction is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which corresponds to choice A).
