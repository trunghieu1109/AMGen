Question: Example(question='Imagine an operator $\\vec{P}$ of a system have components $P_x, P_y$ and $P_z$. The matrix form of the  operator $P_x$ has components in the first row as $(0, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,\\hbar/\\sqrt{2},0)$.  The matrix form of the  operator $P_y$ has components in the first row as $(0, -i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0, -i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2},0)$. Similarly, matrix form of the  operator $P_z$ has components in the first row as $(\\hbar, 0, 0)$, that in the second row as $(0, 0, 0)$ and that in the third row as $(0,0, -\\hbar)$. The basis vectors here are the eigenvectors of $P_z$. The system is found in the eigenstate of $P_x$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$. To be more specific, the explicit form of the state of the system is given by the column vector having elements $(-1/2, 1/\\sqrt{2}, -1/2)$. What is the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z $ of $P_z$', choice1='\\hbar\n', choice2='\\hbar/2', choice3='\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}\n', choice4='\\sqrt{2}\\hbar', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: The uncertainty ΔP_z is defined as the square root of the variance of the operator P_z in the given state |ψ⟩. The variance is given by ΔP_z^2 = ⟨P_z^2⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩^2. From the previous calculations, the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ was found to be zero, which means the mean value of P_z in this state is zero. The expectation value ⟨P_z^2⟩ was calculated as ℏ^2/2. Substituting these values into the variance formula gives ΔP_z^2 = ℏ^2/2 - 0 = ℏ^2/2. Taking the square root of the variance yields ΔP_z = ℏ/√2. This result is consistent with the physical interpretation that the state is a superposition of eigenstates of P_z with eigenvalues +ℏ, 0, and -ℏ, leading to a nonzero uncertainty in the measurement of P_z. Therefore, the uncertainty ΔP_z is ℏ/√2, which corresponds to choice C).
