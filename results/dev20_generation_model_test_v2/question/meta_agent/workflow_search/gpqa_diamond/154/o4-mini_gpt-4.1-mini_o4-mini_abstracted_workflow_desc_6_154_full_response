The state vector ψ is given as (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2)^T. To compute the expectation value <P_z>, we use the formula <P_z> = ψ† P_z ψ. Since P_z is diagonal, this simplifies to the sum over i of |ψ_i|^2 * eigenvalue_i. The components of ψ are ψ_1 = -1/2, ψ_2 = 1/√2, ψ_3 = -1/2. The probabilities are |ψ_1|^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4, |ψ_2|^2 = (1/√2)^2 = 1/2, |ψ_3|^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4. The eigenvalues are ħ, 0, and -ħ respectively. Therefore, <P_z> = (1/4)*ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ) = (1/4)ħ - (1/4)ħ = 0. This result indicates that the expectation value of P_z in the state ψ is zero. This is consistent with the fact that ψ is an eigenstate of P_x, not P_z, and hence is a superposition of P_z eigenstates with positive and negative eigenvalues symmetrically weighted.

The state vector ψ is given as (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2)^T, which is normalized. To compute the expectation value <P_z^2>, we use the fact that P_z^2 is also diagonal with eigenvalues ħ^2, 0, and ħ^2 (since (-ħ)^2 = ħ^2). The expectation value <P_z^2> is given by ψ† P_z^2 ψ = sum over i of |ψ_i|^2 * (eigenvalue_i)^2. The components of ψ are ψ_1 = -1/2, ψ_2 = 1/√2, ψ_3 = -1/2.

Squaring these eigenvalues gives ħ^2, 0, and ħ^2 respectively. The state vector ψ is given as (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2)^T, which is normalized. The expectation value <P_z^2> is the sum over i of |ψ_i|^2 times the square of the eigenvalue corresponding to that component. Specifically, <P_z^2> = |ψ_1|^2 * (ħ)^2 + |ψ_2|^2 * 0^2 + |ψ_3|^2 * (-ħ)^2. Calculating the probabilities: |ψ_1|^2 = (-1/2)^2 = 1/4, |ψ_2|^2 = (1/√2)^2 = 1/2, |ψ_3|^2 = (-1/2)^2 = 1/4. Plugging into the formula: <P_z^2> = (1/4)*ħ^2 + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*ħ^2 = (1/4 + 1/4)*ħ^2 = (1/2)*ħ^2. Therefore, the expectation value <P_z^2> = (1/2) ħ^2.

The uncertainty ΔP_z is calculated using the formula ΔP_z = sqrt(<P_z^2> - <P_z>^2). Given the state vector ψ = (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2)^T in the P_z eigenbasis, the expectation values are computed as follows: <P_z> = ħ*(|ψ_1|^2 - |ψ_3|^2) = ħ*(1/4 - 1/4) = 0, since the middle component corresponds to eigenvalue 0 and does not contribute. For <P_z^2>, since eigenvalues are ħ, 0, and -ħ, their squares are ħ^2, 0, and ħ^2 respectively, so <P_z^2> = ħ^2*(|ψ_1|^2 + |ψ_3|^2) = ħ^2*(1/4 + 1/4) = ħ^2/2. Therefore, ΔP_z = sqrt(ħ^2/2 - 0) = ħ/√2, which matches choice C. The calculations are consistent, and the state is normalized.
