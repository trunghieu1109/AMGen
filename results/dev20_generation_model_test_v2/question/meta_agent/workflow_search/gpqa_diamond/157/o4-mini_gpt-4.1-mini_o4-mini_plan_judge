Question: Example(question='In an inactive state, a transcription factor subunit awaits an activation signal from the membrane phosphorylation cascade. Upon phosphorylation on the Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, shuttles into the nucleus, and serves in gene transcription. A missense mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. You observe that a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Which of the following molecular phenotypes is most likely observed in the presence of mutation Y?', choice1='loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype', choice2='protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype', choice3='protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele', choice4='change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: A dominant-negative mutation in the dimerization domain of a transcription factor subunit means that the mutant protein can still bind to the wild-type protein but disrupts the formation of a functional dimer. This disruption leads to the formation of nonfunctional heterodimers, which sequester the wild-type protein and prevent it from performing its normal function. This results in a loss-of-function phenotype even though one wild-type allele is present. The mutation does not cause degradation of the wild-type protein, nor does it confer a gain-of-function phenotype. Also, a wild-type phenotype is inconsistent with a dominant-negative mutation because the mutant protein actively interferes with the function of the wild-type protein. The term 'protein aggregation' in this context can be interpreted broadly as the formation of nonfunctional complexes (heterodimers) that sequester the wild-type protein, rendering it inactive. Therefore, the molecular phenotype most consistent with a dominant-negative mutation in the dimerization domain is 'protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype.' This corresponds to choice B. Other options either contradict the dominant-negative effect or describe unrelated molecular outcomes.
