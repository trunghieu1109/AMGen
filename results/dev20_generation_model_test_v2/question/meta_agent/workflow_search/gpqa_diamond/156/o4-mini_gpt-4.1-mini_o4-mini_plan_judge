proposed answer: The pathogen is a retrovirus, which means its genome is RNA, not DNA. Therefore, any molecular diagnostic approach must start with reverse transcription of viral RNA into complementary DNA (cDNA) before sequencing or amplification. Direct DNA sequencing without reverse transcription is inappropriate and will not yield the viral genome sequence. Serological methods like ELISA targeting IgG antibodies detect the host immune response, which typically appears days to weeks after infection onset, making them unsuitable for early and rapid diagnosis during an outbreak. Symptom-based identification is indirect and nonspecific, leading to potential misdiagnosis and delayed detection. Among PCR methods, conventional PCR is slower and less sensitive, nested PCR increases sensitivity but adds complexity, time, and contamination risk, which is undesirable in outbreak scenarios requiring rapid results. Real-time PCR (qPCR) offers rapid, sensitive, and quantitative detection with reduced contamination risk due to its closed-tube system, making it ideal for quick and accurate diagnosis. Therefore, the optimal molecular diagnostic protocol involves: 1) Identifying the virus by performing cDNA sequencing after reverse transcription of viral RNA to obtain specific viral sequences; 2) Designing primers and probes based on these sequences; 3) Developing a real-time PCR assay targeting these sequences for rapid, sensitive, and specific detection. This approach ensures early detection during the acute phase of infection, high diagnostic accuracy, and suitability for outbreak management. Key design steps include: sample collection (blood/plasma), RNA extraction, reverse transcription to cDNA, sequencing to identify viral genome, primer/probe design for qPCR, assay optimization and validation, and kit assembly for field use. This method balances speed, sensitivity, specificity, and practicality, minimizing false negatives and contamination risks.
