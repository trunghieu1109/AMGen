Question: Example(question='Observations of a quasar across the electromagnetic spectrum are being carried out. Focusing on the near infrared and optical spectrum, there is a peak at wavelength of about 790 nm, and at shorter wavelengths < 790 nm the flux drops significantly.\n\nIf we lived in a universe defined by Lambda-CDM model such that the current Hubble constant is 70 km s^-1 Mpc^-1, matter density parameter is 0.3, dark energy density parameter is 0.7, and universe is flat,\nwhat can be assumed about the value of the comoving distance (for scale factor a=1) of this quasar from the Earth?', choice1='8 Gpc', choice2='9 Gpc', choice3='7 Gpc', choice4='6 Gpc', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: The observed sharp flux drop at wavelengths shorter than 790 nm is most consistently identified as the Lyman-alpha break at 121.6 nm in the rest frame of the quasar. Using the redshift formula z = (λ_obs / λ_rest) - 1, we calculate z ≈ (790 / 121.6) - 1 ≈ 5.5. This redshift is typical for high-redshift quasars and matches the spectral feature observed. Given the flat ΛCDM cosmology with H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc, Ω_m = 0.3, and Ω_Λ = 0.7, the comoving distance D_C is computed by integrating D_C = (c/H0) × ∫₀^z dz'/E(z'), where E(z) = sqrt(Ω_m(1+z)^3 + Ω_Λ). Using c = 299,792 km/s, c/H0 ≈ 4283 Mpc = 4.283 Gpc. Numerical integration of ∫₀^{5.5} dz'/E(z') yields approximately 1.85, so D_C ≈ 4.283 × 1.85 ≈ 7.9 Gpc, which rounds to 8 Gpc. Alternative interpretations, such as the flux drop being the Lyman limit at 91.2 nm, would imply a higher redshift (~7.7) and a larger comoving distance (~9 Gpc), but this is less consistent with the observed spectral shape. Lower redshift interpretations would yield smaller distances (6 or 7 Gpc) but cannot explain the sharp flux drop at 790 nm. Therefore, the most consistent and justified choice for the comoving distance of the quasar is 8 Gpc, corresponding to choice A).
