Question: Example(question='Observations of a quasar across the electromagnetic spectrum are being carried out. Focusing on the near infrared and optical spectrum, there is a peak at wavelength of about 790 nm, and at shorter wavelengths < 790 nm the flux drops significantly.\n\nIf we lived in a universe defined by Lambda-CDM model such that the current Hubble constant is 70 km s^-1 Mpc^-1, matter density parameter is 0.3, dark energy density parameter is 0.7, and universe is flat,\nwhat can be assumed about the value of the comoving distance (for scale factor a=1) of this quasar from the Earth?', choice1='8 Gpc', choice2='9 Gpc', choice3='7 Gpc', choice4='6 Gpc', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: The observed peak wavelength of the quasar is about 790 nm, and the flux drops significantly at wavelengths shorter than this. This suggests that the Lyman-alpha emission line (rest wavelength 121.6 nm) is redshifted to 790 nm. The redshift z can be estimated by z = (observed wavelength / rest wavelength) - 1 = (790 / 121.6) - 1 ≈ 5.5. Given the cosmological parameters (H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc, Ωm = 0.3, ΩΛ = 0.7, flat universe), the comoving distance Dc is calculated by integrating Dc = (c/H0) * ∫0^z dz' / E(z'), where E(z) = sqrt(Ωm(1+z)^3 + ΩΛ). Using numerical integration or cosmology calculators, the comoving distance for z ≈ 5.5 is found to be between 7 and 8 Gpc. The options given are 6, 7, 8, and 9 Gpc. Considering the typical cosmological distances at this redshift and the results from multiple methods, the comoving distance is closer to 8 Gpc. The value 9 Gpc is too large, and 6 or 7 Gpc are slightly underestimated. Therefore, the best choice is 8 Gpc (choice A). This conclusion is consistent with standard cosmological calculations and previous attempts, minimizing errors from approximations or numerical methods.
