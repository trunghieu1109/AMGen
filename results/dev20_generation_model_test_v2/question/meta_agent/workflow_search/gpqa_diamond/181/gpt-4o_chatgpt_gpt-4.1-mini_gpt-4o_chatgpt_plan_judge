proposed answer: The Mott-Gurney equation J = (9/8) * ε * μ * (V^2 / L^3) describes the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) in semiconductor devices. Its validity depends on several key assumptions: (1) The device must be trap-free, meaning no traps capture charge carriers and alter the current-voltage relationship. Traps would change the current behavior and invalidate the simple quadratic voltage dependence. (2) The conduction must be dominated by a single type of charge carrier (either electrons or holes), as the equation assumes single-carrier transport. Two-carrier devices introduce recombination and more complex transport phenomena not accounted for by this equation. (3) The contacts must be Ohmic, meaning they allow free injection of carriers without any injection barrier. This ensures that the current is limited by space charge effects rather than injection limitations. Schottky contacts introduce barriers that violate this assumption. (4) Diffusion current must be negligible compared to drift current, as the equation assumes drift-dominated transport. Evaluating the choices: Choice 1 states a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current, which perfectly matches all the assumptions. Choice 2 mentions negligible drift current, contradicting the drift-dominated assumption. Choice 3 involves two-carrier devices, violating the single-carrier assumption. Choice 4 involves Schottky contacts, which introduce injection barriers and violate the Ohmic contact assumption. Therefore, the only correct statement about the validity of the Mott-Gurney equation is Choice 1 (A).
