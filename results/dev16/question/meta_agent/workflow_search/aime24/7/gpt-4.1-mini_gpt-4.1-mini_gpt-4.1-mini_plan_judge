proposed answer: From Sub-task 4, we have the key relationships: y = 25 / x and the transcendental equation ((x + 10)/x) * ln(x) = ln(25), with x > 1 and y > 1. Since y = 25 / x, for y > 1, we require x < 25. Combined with x > 1, x lies in (1, 25). The function f(x) = ((x + 10)/x) * ln(x) is continuous and strictly increasing on (1, 25). Evaluating at the endpoints: f(1) = 0 < ln(25), and f(25) = (35/25) * ln(25) = 1.4 * ln(25) > ln(25). By the Intermediate Value Theorem, there exists a unique x in (1, 25) such that f(x) = ln(25). Correspondingly, y = 25 / x > 1. The product xy = x * (25 / x) = 25 is constant regardless of the exact values of x and y, as long as they satisfy the transcendental equation and domain constraints. To verify the solution satisfies the original logarithmic equations: From the first equation, log_x(y^x) = 10 implies y^x = x^{10}. Substituting y = 25 / x, (25 / x)^x = x^{10} which rearranges to 25^x = x^{x + 10}. Taking natural logs and simplifying leads to the transcendental equation found earlier. Similarly, the second equation log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 implies x^{4y} = y^{10}, which also holds true given the relationships. Both x and y are greater than 1, satisfying domain constraints. Therefore, the product xy = 25 is the consistent and correct answer that satisfies all conditions.
