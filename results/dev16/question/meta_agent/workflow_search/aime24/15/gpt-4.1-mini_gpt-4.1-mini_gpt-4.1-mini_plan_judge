Question: Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_10_15
proposed answer: We are given a total of 900 residents, each owning candy hearts, so the candy hearts set includes all 900 residents. The other three sets are diamond rings (195 owners), golf clubs (367 owners), and garden spades (562 owners). We also know that 437 residents own exactly two of these items, and 234 own exactly three of these items. We want to find the number of residents owning all four items (diamond rings, golf clubs, garden spades, and candy hearts), denoted as x.

Step 1: Define variables for the number of residents owning exactly two items as d, e, f and exactly three items as a, b, c, and the number owning all four items as x. Let y be the number owning only candy hearts.

Step 2: Write down the equations based on the problem:
- d + e + f = 437 (exactly two items)
- a + b + c = 234 (exactly three items)
- d + a + b + x = 195 (diamond rings owners)
- e + a + c + x = 367 (golf clubs owners)
- f + b + c + x = 562 (garden spades owners)
- d + e + f + a + b + c + x + y = 900 (total residents)

Step 3: Add the equations for diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades ownership:
(d + a + b + x) + (e + a + c + x) + (f + b + c + x) = 195 + 367 + 562 = 1124
This simplifies to (d + e + f) + 2(a + b + c) + 3x = 1124

Step 4: Substitute the known sums from step 2:
437 + 2*234 + 3x = 1124
437 + 468 + 3x = 1124
905 + 3x = 1124
3x = 219
x = 73

Step 5: Verify with the total residents equation:
Sum of all except y = 437 + 234 + 73 = 744
So, y = 900 - 744 = 156 (own only candy hearts).

All equations are consistent and satisfy the total population and ownership counts. Therefore, the number of residents owning all four items is 73.
