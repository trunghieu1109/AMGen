Question: Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?

proposed answer: The problem states that the probability can be expressed as a fraction m/n in simplest terms, where m and n are relatively prime positive integers. From the detailed analysis and the sub-task answers, the fraction is given as 17/64. To confirm this fraction is in simplest form, we check the greatest common divisor (gcd) of 17 and 64. Since 17 is a prime number and 64 is a power of 2 (2^6), their gcd is 1, confirming that 17/64 is already in lowest terms. Therefore, m = 17 and n = 64. The problem asks for m + n, which is 17 + 64 = 81. This is consistent across all sub-task answers and is the correct final sum.

proposed answer: The problem states that the probability can be expressed as a reduced fraction m/n, where m and n are relatively prime positive integers. The given simplified fraction for the probability is 3/16. To confirm that 3/16 is in lowest terms, we check the greatest common divisor (gcd) of 3 and 16. Since 3 is prime and 16 is a power of 2, their gcd is 1, confirming the fraction is already simplified. Both numerator and denominator are positive integers, so the fraction is valid. The problem asks for the sum m + n, which is 3 + 16 = 19. Therefore, the final answer is 19.
