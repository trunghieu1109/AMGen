Question: Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.

proposed answer: From the previous analysis, the losing positions for the first player (Alice) in the game where players can remove 1 or 4 tokens are those positions where the number of tokens n satisfies n mod 5 = 0 or n mod 5 = 2. This characterization comes from analyzing the game states and identifying a repeating pattern of losing positions modulo 5. To find how many such positions exist for n ≤ 2024, we count all positive integers up to 2024 that are congruent to 0 or 2 modulo 5. The count of numbers congruent to 0 mod 5 up to 2024 is 404, and the count of numbers congruent to 2 mod 5 up to 2024 is 405. Adding these gives 809. These 809 values of n correspond exactly to the initial positions where Bob, moving second, can guarantee a win regardless of Alice's moves. Thus, the final result is that there are 809 such positive integers n ≤ 2024.
