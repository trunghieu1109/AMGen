Question: Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_12_9
proposed answer: We have already determined that the simplified conditional probability fraction of winning the grand prize given that Jen won a prize is 1/115. Here, m = 1 and n = 115. The problem asks for the sum m + n. Since m = 1 and n = 115, their sum is 1 + 115 = 116. This is a straightforward addition once the fraction is simplified and confirmed to be in lowest terms.
