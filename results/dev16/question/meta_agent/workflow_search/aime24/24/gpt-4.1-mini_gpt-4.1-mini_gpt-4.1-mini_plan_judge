Question: Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations:
\[\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}\]\[\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}\]\[\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}\]
Then the value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: We are given the system of logarithmic equations and have previously found the values of a = log2(x), b = log2(y), and c = log2(z) as a = -7/24, b = -3/8, and c = -5/12. The expression to evaluate is |log2(x^4 y^3 z^2)| = |4a + 3b + 2c|. Calculating each term: 4a = 4 * (-7/24) = -7/6, 3b = 3 * (-3/8) = -9/8, and 2c = 2 * (-5/12) = -5/6. To add these fractions, convert them to a common denominator of 24: -7/6 = -28/24, -9/8 = -27/24, -5/6 = -20/24. Summing these gives (-28 - 27 - 20)/24 = -75/24. Simplify by dividing numerator and denominator by 3 to get -25/8. Taking the absolute value yields 25/8. Since 25 and 8 are coprime, the fraction is in simplest form with m=25 and n=8. Therefore, m + n = 25 + 8 = 33. This step-by-step calculation is consistent and mathematically sound, confirming the final answer.
