We need to compute log2(x^4 y^3 z^2), which by properties of logarithms is 4a + 3b + 2c. We substitute the values of a, b, and c into this expression and simplify step-by-step. First, calculate each term: 4a = 4 * (-7/24) = -28/24 = -7/6; 3b = 3 * (-3/8) = -9/8; 2c = 2 * (-5/12) = -10/12 = -5/6. Next, sum these: (-7/6) + (-9/8) + (-5/6). To add, find a common denominator, which is 24. Convert each fraction: -7/6 = -28/24, -9/8 = -27/24, -5/6 = -20/24. Summing: -28/24 - 27/24 - 20/24 = (-28 - 27 - 20)/24 = -75/24. Simplify -75/24 by dividing numerator and denominator by 3: -25/8. The absolute value is 25/8. Thus, |log2(x^4 y^3 z^2)| = 25/8. The fraction is in lowest terms with m=25 and n=8, so m+n=33.; answer: 33\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent wHTU, computing linear combination, thinking: We are given the values a = log2(x) = -7/24, b = log2(y) = -3/8, and c = log2(z) = -5/12 from the previous sub-task. The expression we want to compute is log2(x^4 y^3 z^2), which can be written using logarithm properties as 4*log2(x) + 3*log2(y) + 2*log2(z) = 4a + 3b + 2c. Substituting the values, we get 4*(-7/24) + 3*(-3/8) + 2*(-5/12). Calculating each term: 4*(-7/24) = -28/24 = -7/6, 3*(-3/8) = -9/8, and 2*(-5/12) = -10/12 = -5/6. Now summing these: -7/6 - 9/8 - 5/6. To add, find a common denominator, which is 24. Convert each fraction: -7/6 = -28/24, -9/8 = -27/24, -5/6 = -20/24. Sum: (-28 - 27 - 20)/24 = -75/24. Simplify -75/24 by dividing numerator and denominator by 3: -25/8. The absolute value is 25/8.

We need to compute log2(x^4 y^3 z^2), which by logarithm properties is 4*log2(x) + 3*log2(y) + 2*log2(z) = 4a + 3b + 2c. Substituting the values: 4*(-7/24) + 3*(-3/8) + 2*(-5/12). Calculate each term: 4*(-7/24) = -28/24 = -7/6, 3*(-3/8) = -9/8, 2*(-5/12) = -10/12 = -5/6. Now sum them: -7/6 + (-9/8) + (-5/6). Find common denominator, which is 24: -7/6 = -28/24, -9/8 = -27/24, -5/6 = -20/24. Sum: (-28 - 27 - 20)/24 = -75/24. Simplify fraction: both numerator and denominator divisible by 3, so -25/8. The absolute value is 25/8. The fraction is in lowest terms since 25 and 8 share no common factors other than 1.

The expression we need to evaluate is log2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = 4a + 3b + 2c. Calculating each term: 4a = 4 * (-7/24) = -28/24 = -7/6; 3b = 3 * (-3/8) = -9/8; 2c = 2 * (-5/12) = -10/12 = -5/6. To add these fractions, we find a common denominator, which is 24. Converting each term: -7/6 = -28/24, -9/8 = -27/24, -5/6 = -20/24. Summing these gives (-28 - 27 - 20)/24 = -75/24. Simplifying by dividing numerator and denominator by 3 yields -25/8. Taking the absolute value, we get 25/8. Since 25 and 8 are coprime, the fraction is in simplest form with m=25 and n=8.

To add these fractions, convert them to a common denominator of 24: -7/6 = -28/24, -9/8 = -27/24, -5/6 = -20/24. Summing these gives (-28 - 27 - 20)/24 = -75/24.
