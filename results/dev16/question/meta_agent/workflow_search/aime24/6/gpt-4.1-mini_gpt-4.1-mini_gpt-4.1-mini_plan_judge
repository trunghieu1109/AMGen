Question: Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.

proposed answer: We are given a set of rectangular boxes with edges x, y, z > 0, satisfying the constraints: surface area 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54, so xy + yz + zx = 27, and volume xyz = 23. We want to find the radius r of the smallest sphere that can contain each box. The smallest sphere containing a box must at least contain its space diagonal d = sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2), so r = d/2. To find the smallest such sphere that contains all boxes, we need to maximize d^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 under the given constraints. 

To simplify, assume symmetry by setting x = y = a and z = b. Then the volume constraint becomes a^2 b = 23, so b = 23 / a^2. The surface area constraint becomes xy + yz + zx = a^2 + 2ab = 27. Substitute b to get a^2 + 2a * (23 / a^2) = a^2 + 46 / a = 27. Multiply both sides by a to clear the denominator: a^3 - 27a + 46 = 0.

Testing rational roots, a = 2 satisfies the equation: 8 - 54 + 46 = 0. Then b = 23 / 4 = 5.75.

Calculate the squared diagonal: d^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 2a^2 + b^2 = 2*(2^2) + (23/4)^2 = 8 + 529/16 = (128/16) + (529/16) = 657/16.

Since r = d/2, r^2 = d^2 / 4 = (657/16) / 4 = 657 / 64. The fraction 657/64 is in lowest terms because 657 factors as 3*3*73 and 64 is 2^6, so no common factors.

Finally, p = 657 and q = 64, so p + q = 657 + 64 = 721.
