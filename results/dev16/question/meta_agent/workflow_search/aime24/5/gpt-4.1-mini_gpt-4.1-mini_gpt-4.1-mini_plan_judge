Question: Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.

proposed answer: The inradius r of a tetrahedron is given by the formula r = 3V / S, where V is the volume of the tetrahedron and S is the total surface area. From the previous sub-tasks, the volume V was found to be 12, and the total surface area S was found to be 110. Substituting these values into the formula gives r = 3 * 12 / 110 = 36 / 110 = 18 / 55. This fraction is already in lowest terms because 18 and 55 share no common prime factors (18 factors as 2 * 3^2, and 55 factors as 5 * 11). To express the inradius in the form (m√n)/p, we note that 18/55 can be written as (18√1)/55, where m = 18, n = 1, and p = 55. Here, n = 1 is square-free by definition, and m and p are coprime positive integers, satisfying all conditions. Therefore, the inradius can be expressed as (18√1)/55. The problem asks for the sum m + n + p, which is 18 + 1 + 55 = 74. Hence, the answer is 74.

proposed answer: The simplified inradius expression given is r = (5√21) / 84. We need to find m + n + p where r = (m√n)/p, with m, n, p positive integers, m and p coprime, and n square-free. From the expression, m = 5, n = 21, and p = 84. Checking the conditions: 21 is square-free since its prime factors are 3 and 7, both distinct primes. The gcd of 5 and 84 is 1, so m and p are coprime. All are positive integers. Therefore, the expression meets all the problem requirements. The sum m + n + p = 5 + 21 + 84 = 110. This is consistent with all previous symbolic computations and the problem's conditions. There is no contradiction or simplification possible that would change these values. Hence, the final answer is 110.
