Question: Let $\omega\neq 1$ be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\]
is divided by 1000.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_9_19
proposed answer: The product given is \( \prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) \), where \( \omega \) is a 13th root of unity. The problem states \( \omega \neq 1 \), but the product includes the term for \( k=0 \), which corresponds to \( \omega^0 = 1 \). This means the product is taken over all 13th roots of unity, including 1. The expression inside the product can be rewritten as \( f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2 \). Evaluating the product over all roots of \( x^{13} - 1 = 0 \) is equivalent to \( \prod_{\omega^{13} = 1} f(\omega) \). Using properties of roots of unity and polynomial resultants, the product simplifies to an integer value, which was found to be 8321. The task is to find the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000. Dividing 8321 by 1000 gives a quotient of 8 and a remainder of 321, since \( 8321 = 8 \times 1000 + 321 \). Therefore, the remainder is 321. This result is consistent with the problem constraints and previous computations. The key points verified are: (1) inclusion of all 13th roots of unity including 1, (2) correct polynomial substitution and simplification, (3) correct modular arithmetic to find the remainder. Potential errors could have arisen if the term at \( k=0 \) was excluded or if the polynomial was misinterpreted. However, the detailed analysis confirms the correctness of the approach and the final remainder. Hence, the remainder modulo 1000 is 321.
