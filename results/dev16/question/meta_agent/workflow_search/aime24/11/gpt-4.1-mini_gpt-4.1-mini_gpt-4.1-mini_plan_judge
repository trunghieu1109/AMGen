Question: Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.
[asy] size(10cm); usepackage("tikz");label("\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(2,0)--(2,3)--(5,3)--(5,8)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}",origin); label("\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(0,3)--(3,3)--(3,5)--(8,5)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}",E); [/asy]

proposed answer: The problem requires counting the number of lattice paths from (0,0) to (8,8) with exactly four direction changes. Each path consists of 16 steps: 8 right (horizontal) and 8 up (vertical). A direction change occurs when the path switches from horizontal to vertical or vice versa. Exactly four direction changes mean the path is composed of five monotone segments alternating between horizontal and vertical moves. The segments alternate directions strictly, and each segment must have positive length to ensure exactly four direction changes (no zero-length segments). There are two cases depending on the starting direction: 1) Starting horizontally: The segments are H-V-H-V-H, so there are 3 horizontal segments and 2 vertical segments. 2) Starting vertically: The segments are V-H-V-H-V, so there are 3 vertical segments and 2 horizontal segments. The number of compositions of 8 into k positive parts is C(7, k-1). For 3 parts, it is C(7,2) = 21; for 2 parts, it is C(7,1) = 7. For the starting horizontal case, the number of ways is 21 (horizontal) * 7 (vertical) = 147. For the starting vertical case, the number of ways is 21 (vertical) * 7 (horizontal) = 147. Summing both cases gives 147 + 147 = 294. This count correctly accounts for all paths with exactly four direction changes, considering both possible starting directions and ensuring positive segment lengths. Therefore, the total number of such paths is 294.
