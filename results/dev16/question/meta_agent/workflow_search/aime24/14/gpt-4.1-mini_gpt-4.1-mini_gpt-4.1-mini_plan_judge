Question: Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.

proposed answer: The problem requires finding the greatest real number less than BD^2 for all rhombi ABCD inscribed in the hyperbola \( \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \) with diagonals intersecting at the origin. The key geometric conditions are that ABCD is a rhombus (equal sides, diagonals bisect each other at right angles) and the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the midpoint of both diagonals. By parametrizing points on the hyperbola using hyperbolic functions, the vertices can be expressed in terms of parameters u and v. The perpendicularity of the diagonals leads to the constraint equation \( 11 \cosh(u+v) = \cosh(u-v) \). The squared length of diagonal BD is expressed as \( BD^2 = 176 \cosh^2 v - 96 \). Under the constraint, the maximum achievable value of \( BD^2 \) is found to be 196. Attempts to find larger values violate the constraint, so 196 is the supremum of \( BD^2 \) for such rhombi. Since the problem asks for the greatest real number less than \( BD^2 \) for all such rhombi, the answer is the greatest real number less than 196. The integer immediately less than 196 is 195, which is the greatest integer less than the supremum. This conclusion is consistent with the geometric and algebraic constraints and verified by boundary analysis. Therefore, the greatest real number less than \( BD^2 \) for all such rhombi is 195.

proposed answer: The problem involves a rhombus ABCD inscribed in the hyperbola \( \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \) with diagonals intersecting at the origin. Because the diagonals bisect each other at the origin, points B and D are symmetric about the origin, as are points A and C. Parametrizing the hyperbola using hyperbolic functions and applying the rhombus condition leads to the constraint \( \tanh u \tanh v = -\frac{5}{6} \). The squared length of diagonal BD can be expressed in terms of \( \cosh^2 u \) and \( \cosh^2 v \), and minimizing \( BD^2 \) under the constraint yields an infimum of 480. This value is approached asymptotically as one parameter approaches the boundary of its domain (i.e., \( |\tanh v| \to 1 \)) but is never exactly attained, making 480 the infimum, not a minimum. The supremum of \( BD^2 \) is unbounded since the hyperbola extends infinitely. Therefore, the greatest real number less than all possible values of \( BD^2 \) for such rhombi is 480. This conclusion follows from the hyperbola's geometry, the rhombus properties, and the parametrization constraints, which prevent any smaller value without violating the problem conditions.
