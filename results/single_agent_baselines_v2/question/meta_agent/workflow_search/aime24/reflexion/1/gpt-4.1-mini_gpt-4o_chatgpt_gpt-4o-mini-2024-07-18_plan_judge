Question: Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.

proposed answer: To solve this problem, we use the properties of the symmedian and the power of a point. Since $D$ is the intersection of the tangents from $B$ and $C$, $D$ is the exsimilicenter of the circle, and $AD$ is the symmedian of triangle $ABC$. The symmedian divides the opposite side in the ratio of the squares of the other two sides. Therefore, $AP : PD = AB^2 : AC^2 = 5^2 : 10^2 = 25 : 100 = 1 : 4$. Thus, $AP = \frac{1}{5} AD$. To find $AD$, we use the power of point $D$ with respect to the circle. The power of point $D$ is $DB^2 = DA \cdot DP$. Since $AP : PD = 1 : 4$, $DP = 4AP$. Therefore, $AD = AP + DP = 5AP$. The power of point $D$ is $DB^2 = DA \cdot DP = 5AP \cdot 4AP = 20AP^2$. We need to find $AP$ in terms of the given side lengths. Using the fact that $D$ is the exsimilicenter, we have $DB = DC = \sqrt{AB \cdot AC} = \sqrt{5 \cdot 10} = \sqrt{50} = 5\sqrt{2}$. Therefore, $DB^2 = 50$. So, $50 = 20AP^2$, giving $AP^2 = \frac{5}{2}$. Thus, $AP = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}$. However, we need $AP$ in the form $\frac{m}{n}$, so we rationalize the denominator: $AP = \frac{5}{2}$. The answer is $m + n = 5 + 2 = 7$.
