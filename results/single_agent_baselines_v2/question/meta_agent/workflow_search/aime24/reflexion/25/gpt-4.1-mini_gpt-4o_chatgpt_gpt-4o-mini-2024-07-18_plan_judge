Question: Let ABCDEF be a convex equilateral hexagon in which all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle whose sides are extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. Find the side length of the hexagon.
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The hexagon ABCDEF is equilateral and has opposite sides parallel, which means it is a symmetric hexagon. The triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. This triangle is similar to the triangle formed by the vectors representing the sides of the hexagon. The side lengths of the triangle are proportional to the side length of the hexagon. The triangle with sides 200, 240, and 300 is a scaled version of the triangle formed by the vectors of the hexagon. The greatest common divisor of 200, 240, and 300 is 40, which suggests that the side length of the hexagon is 40.
