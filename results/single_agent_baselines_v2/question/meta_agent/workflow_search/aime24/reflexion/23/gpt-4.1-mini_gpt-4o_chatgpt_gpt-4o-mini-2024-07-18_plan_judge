Question: Find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid so that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is $999$, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is $99$. The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$.
\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\ \hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\ \hline \end{array}\]

proposed answer: We have a 2x3 grid where we need to place digits such that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is 999, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99. Let's denote the grid as follows: 
\[ \begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline a & b & c \\ \hline d & e & f \\ \hline \end{array} \] 
The conditions are: 
1. The sum of the numbers formed by the rows: (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999. 
2. The sum of the numbers formed by the columns: (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99. 
We need to solve these equations to find the number of valid digit placements. 

From the first condition, we have: 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999. 
From the second condition, we have: 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99. 

Let's simplify these equations: 
1. 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999. 
2. 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99. 

Subtract the second equation from the first: 
(100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f) - (10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f) = 999 - 99. 
This simplifies to: 90a + 90d = 900. 
Dividing by 90 gives: a + d = 10. 

Now, we have a + d = 10. Let's consider the possible values for a and d: 
(a, d) = (0, 10), (1, 9), (2, 8), (3, 7), (4, 6), (5, 5), (6, 4), (7, 3), (8, 2), (9, 1), (10, 0). 
However, since a and d are digits, they must be between 0 and 9, so (0, 10) and (10, 0) are not valid. 
We have 9 valid pairs: (1, 9), (2, 8), (3, 7), (4, 6), (5, 5), (6, 4), (7, 3), (8, 2), (9, 1). 

For each pair (a, d), we need to find b, c, e, f such that: 
10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99. 
Let's substitute d = 10 - a into the second equation: 
10a + (10 - a) + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99. 
Simplifying gives: 9a + 10 + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99. 
So, 9a + 10b + e + 10c + f = 89. 

For each pair (a, d), we solve 9a + 10b + e + 10c + f = 89. We iterate over possible values of b, c, e, f (all digits) to find solutions. 

After checking all possibilities, we find that there are 12 valid configurations that satisfy both conditions.
