Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: To solve this problem, we need to understand the geometry of the torus and the sphere. The torus is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis that is 6 units away from the center of the circle. This means the torus has a major radius (distance from the center of the torus to the center of the tube) of 6 and a minor radius (radius of the tube) of 3. The sphere has a radius of 11. When the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 11 + 3 = 14. The center of the torus is 6 units from the axis of revolution, so the distance from the center of the sphere to the axis of revolution is 14 - 6 = 8. The radius of the circle of tangency, r_i, is the distance from the center of the torus to the point of tangency, which is 3. When the torus is internally tangent to the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 11 - 3 = 8. The distance from the center of the sphere to the axis of revolution is 8 + 6 = 14. The radius of the circle of tangency, r_o, is the distance from the center of the torus to the point of tangency, which is 3. The difference r_i - r_o is 3 - 3 = 0. However, this seems incorrect, so let's re-evaluate. When the torus is externally tangent, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 11 + 3 = 14, and the distance from the center of the sphere to the axis of revolution is 14 - 6 = 8. The radius of the circle of tangency, r_i, is 8 - 6 = 2. When the torus is internally tangent, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 11 - 3 = 8, and the distance from the center of the sphere to the axis of revolution is 8 + 6 = 14. The radius of the circle of tangency, r_o, is 14 - 6 = 8. The difference r_i - r_o is 2 - 8 = -6. The problem asks for the difference r_i - r_o in the form m/n, where m and n are relatively prime. The difference is -6, which can be written as -6/1. Therefore, m = -6 and n = 1, so m + n = -6 + 1 = -5. However, the problem asks for positive integers, so let's re-evaluate. The correct difference is 6, which can be written as 6/1. Therefore, m = 6 and n = 1, so m + n = 6 + 1 = 7.
