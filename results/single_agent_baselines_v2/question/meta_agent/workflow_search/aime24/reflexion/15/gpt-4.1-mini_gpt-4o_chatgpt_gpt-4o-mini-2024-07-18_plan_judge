Question: Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: We need to find the number of residents who own all four items: a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, a garden spade, and a bag of candy hearts. We know that each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, so we focus on the other three items. Let A, B, and C be the sets of residents who own a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, and a garden spade, respectively. We have |A| = 195, |B| = 367, |C| = 562. The number of residents who own exactly two of these items is 437, and the number who own exactly three of these items is 234. We need to find the number of residents who own all four items, including the bag of candy hearts. Let x be the number of residents who own all four items. Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, the number of residents who own at least one of the three items is given by: |A ∪ B ∪ C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ C|. We know that |A ∩ B ∩ C| = 234, and |A ∩ B| + |A ∩ C| + |B ∩ C| = 437 + 3 * 234. Therefore, |A ∪ B ∪ C| = 195 + 367 + 562 - (437 + 3 * 234) + 234. Simplifying, we get: |A ∪ B ∪ C| = 1124 - 437 - 702 + 234. |A ∪ B ∪ C| = 1124 - 1139 + 234. |A ∪ B ∪ C| = 219. Since there are 900 residents, and each owns a bag of candy hearts, the number of residents who own all four items is 900 - 219 = 681.
