Question: Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). Then \(OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\).\Pattern: reflexion
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent r8gB', content='To solve this problem, we need to find the coordinates of point C on segment AB such that C does not belong to any segment PQ from the family \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) other than \\(\\overline{AB}\\). The segment \\(\\overline{PQ}\\) has endpoints P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis, and it has a unit length. The line segment \\(\\overline{AB}\\) has endpoints A and B, with coordinates A = (1/2, 0) and B = (0, \\sqrt{3}/2). The equation of line AB can be found using the slope formula. The slope of AB is \\(-\\sqrt{3}\\), so the equation of line AB is \\(y = -\\sqrt{3}x + \\sqrt{3}/2\\). A point C on AB can be parameterized as \\(C = (x, -\\sqrt{3}x + \\sqrt{3}/2)\\). We need to find x such that C does not lie on any segment \\(\\overline{PQ}\\) other than \\(\\overline{AB}\\). For a segment \\(\\overline{PQ}\\) with P = (a, 0) and Q = (0, b), the distance condition is \\(a^2 + b^2 = 1\\). The line through P and Q has equation \\(y = -\\frac{b}{a}x + b\\). For C to lie on this line, \\(-\\sqrt{3}x + \\sqrt{3}/2 = -\\frac{b}{a}x + b\\). Solving for x gives \\(x = \\frac{a(\\sqrt{3}/2 - b)}{a\\sqrt{3} - b}\\). We need to find x such that this equation has no solution for any a and b satisfying \\(a^2 + b^2 = 1\\). By symmetry and the nature of the problem, the unique point C is the midpoint of AB, which is \\(C = (1/4, \\sqrt{3}/4)\\). We calculate \\(OC^2 = (1/4)^2 + (\\sqrt{3}/4)^2 = 1/16 + 3/16 = 1/4\\). Therefore, \\(OC^2 = \\frac{1}{4}\\), and p + q = 1 + 4 = 5.\n\nAnswer:5', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
