    <pre>To solve this problem, we need to find the coordinates of point C on segment AB such that C does not belong to any segment PQ from the family \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). The segment \(\overline{PQ}\) has endpoints P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis, and it has a unit length. The line segment \(\overline{AB}\) has endpoints A and B, with coordinates A = (1/2, 0) and B = (0, \sqrt{3}/2). The equation of line AB can be found using the slope formula. The slope of AB is \(-\sqrt{3}\), so the equation of line AB is \(y = -\sqrt{3}x + \sqrt{3}/2\). A point C on AB can be parameterized as \(C = (x, -\sqrt{3}x + \sqrt{3}/2)\). We need to find x such that C does not lie on any segment \(\overline{PQ}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). For a segment \(\overline{PQ}\) with P = (a, 0) and Q = (0, b), the distance condition is \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\). The line through P and Q has equation \(y = -\frac{b}{a}x + b\). For C to lie on this line, \(-\sqrt{3}x + \sqrt{3}/2 = -\frac{b}{a}x + b\). Solving for x gives \(x = \frac{a(\sqrt{3}/2 - b)}{a\sqrt{3} - b}\). We need to find x such that this equation has no solution for any a and b satisfying \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\). By symmetry and the nature of the problem, the unique point C is the midpoint of AB, which is \(C = (1/4, \sqrt{3}/4)\). We calculate \(OC^2 = (1/4)^2 + (\sqrt{3}/4)^2 = 1/16 + 3/16 = 1/4\). Therefore, \(OC^2 = \frac{1}{4}\), and p + q = 1 + 4 = 5.
