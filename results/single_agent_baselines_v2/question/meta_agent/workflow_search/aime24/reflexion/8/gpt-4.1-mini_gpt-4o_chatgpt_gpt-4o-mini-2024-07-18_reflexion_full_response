Question: Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.\Pattern: reflexion
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent pbyp', content='To solve this problem, we need to determine the winning and losing positions in the game. A position is a losing position if the player whose turn it is cannot force a win, assuming optimal play from the opponent. Conversely, a position is a winning position if the player can force a win. We start by identifying the base cases: if there is 1 token, Alice wins by taking it, so 1 is a winning position. If there are 2 tokens, Alice takes 1 and leaves 1 for Bob, who then wins, so 2 is a losing position. If there are 3 tokens, Alice takes 1 and leaves 2 for Bob, who is in a losing position, so 3 is a winning position. If there are 4 tokens, Alice can take all 4 and win, so 4 is a winning position. If there are 5 tokens, Alice can take 1 and leave 4 for Bob, who wins, or take 4 and leave 1 for Bob, who wins, so 5 is a losing position. We continue this process to find a pattern. We find that the losing positions are those where n is congruent to 2 mod 5. Therefore, the number of positive integers n less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob can guarantee a win is the number of integers n such that n ≡ 2 (mod 5) and 1 ≤ n ≤ 2024.\n\nAnswer:405', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
