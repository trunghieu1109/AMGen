    <pre>To solve this problem, we need to construct a list of positive integers that satisfies all the given conditions. Let&#39;s denote the list as \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) where \( a_1 \leq a_2 \leq \ldots \leq a_n \). The conditions are: 1) The sum of the items is 30. 2) The unique mode is 9, meaning 9 appears more frequently than any other number. 3) The median is a positive integer not in the list. 

First, let&#39;s consider the mode condition. Since 9 is the unique mode, it must appear more than any other number. Let&#39;s assume 9 appears \( k \) times, where \( k \geq 2 \) because it must appear more than any other number. 

Next, consider the median condition. If the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle element. If it has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle elements. The median must not be in the list. 

Let&#39;s try constructing the list. Suppose 9 appears 3 times (\( k = 3 \)). Then the list has the form \( a_1, a_2, 9, 9, 9, a_6, \ldots, a_n \). The sum of the list is 30, so \( a_1 + a_2 + 27 + a_6 + \ldots + a_n = 30 \), which simplifies to \( a_1 + a_2 + a_6 + \ldots + a_n = 3 \). 

Let&#39;s try a list with 7 elements: \( a_1, a_2, 9, 9, 9, a_6, a_7 \). The median is the 4th element, which is 9, but it must not be in the list. So, let&#39;s try 8 elements: \( a_1, a_2, 9, 9, 9, a_6, a_7, a_8 \). The median is the average of the 4th and 5th elements, which is 9, so this doesn&#39;t work. 

Let&#39;s try 9 elements: \( a_1, a_2, 9, 9, 9, a_6, a_7, a_8, a_9 \). The median is the 5th element, which is 9, so this doesn&#39;t work. 

Let&#39;s try 10 elements: \( a_1, a_2, 9, 9, 9, a_6, a_7, a_8, a_9, a_{10} \). The median is the average of the 5th and 6th elements, which is \( \frac{9 + a_6}{2} \). For the median to not be in the list, \( a_6 \) must be different from 9. 

Let&#39;s try \( a_1 = 1, a_2 = 1, a_6 = 10, a_7 = 10, a_8 = 10, a_9 = 10, a_{10} = 10 \). The list is \( 1, 1, 9, 9, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10 \). The sum is \( 1 + 1 + 27 + 50 = 79 \), which is too high. 

Let&#39;s try \( a_1 = 1, a_2 = 1, a_6 = 10, a_7 = 10, a_8 = 10, a_9 = 10 \). The list is \( 1, 1, 9, 9, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10 \). The sum is \( 1 + 1 + 27 + 40 = 69 \), which is too high. 

Let&#39;s try \( a_1 = 1, a_2 = 1, a_6 = 8, a_7 = 8, a_8 = 8 \). The list is \( 1, 1, 9, 9, 9, 8, 8, 8 \). The sum is \( 1 + 1 + 27 + 24 = 53 \), which is too high. 

Let&#39;s try \( a_1 = 1, a_2 = 1, a_6 = 7, a_7 = 7, a_8 = 7 \). The list is \( 1, 1, 9, 9, 9, 7, 7, 7 \). The sum is \( 1 + 1 + 27 + 21 = 50 \), which is too high. 

Let&#39;s try \( a_1 = 1, a_2 = 1, a_6 = 6, a_7 = 6, a_8 = 6 \). The list is \( 1, 1, 9, 9, 9, 6, 6, 6 \). The sum is \( 1 + 1 + 27 + 18 = 47 \), which is too high. 

Let&#39;s try \( a_1 = 1, a_2 = 1, a_6 = 5, a_7 = 5, a_8 = 5 \). The list is \( 1, 1, 9, 9, 9, 5, 5, 5 \). The sum is \( 1 + 1 + 27 + 15 = 44 \), which is too high. 

Let&#39;s try \( a_1 = 1, a_2 = 1, a_6 = 4, a_7 = 4, a_8 = 4 \). The list is \( 1, 1, 9, 9, 9, 4, 4, 4 \). The sum is \( 1 + 1 + 27 + 12 = 41 \), which is too high. 

Let&#39;s try \( a_1 = 1, a_2 = 1, a_6 = 3, a_7 = 3, a_8 = 3 \). The list is \( 1, 1, 9, 9, 9, 3, 3, 3 \). The sum is \( 1 + 1 + 27 + 9 = 38 \), which is too high. 

Let&#39;s try \( a_1 = 1, a_2 = 1, a_6 = 2, a_7 = 2, a_8 = 2 \). The list is \( 1, 1, 9, 9, 9, 2, 2, 2 \). The sum is \( 1 + 1 + 27 + 6 = 35 \), which is too high. 

Let&#39;s try \( a_1 = 1, a_2 = 1, a_6 = 1, a_7 = 1, a_8 = 1 \). The list is \( 1, 1, 9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 1 \). The sum is \( 1 + 1 + 27 + 3 = 32 \), which is too high. 

Let&#39;s try \( a_1 = 1, a_2 = 1, a_6 = 1, a_7 = 1 \). The list is \( 1, 1, 9, 9, 9, 1, 1 \). The sum is \( 1 + 1 + 27 + 2 = 31 \), which is too high. 

Let&#39;s try \( a_1 = 1, a_2 = 1, a_6 = 1 \). The list is \( 1, 1, 9, 9, 9, 1 \). The sum is \( 1 + 1 + 27 + 1 = 30 \), which is correct. The median is \( \frac{9 + 1}{2} = 5 \), which is not in the list. 

The list is \( 1, 1, 9, 9, 9, 1 \). The sum of the squares is \( 1^2 + 1^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 1 + 81 + 81 + 81 + 1 = 246 \).
