Question: Alice chooses a set $A$ of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets $B$ of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of $B$ belongs to $A$. Bob's list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A.

proposed answer: Let's analyze the problem step by step. Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers such that the maximum element of B is in A. We need to find the sum of the elements of A given that Bob's list has 2024 sets.

For each element a in A, the number of sets B where the maximum element is a is 2^(a-1). This is because we can choose any subset of {1, 2, ..., a-1} to be in B, and then include a as the maximum element.

Therefore, the total number of sets B is the sum of 2^(a-1) for all a in A. We are given that this total is 2024.

Let's express 2024 as a sum of powers of 2:
2024 = 2^10 + 2^9 + 2^5.

This suggests that A could be {11, 10, 6}, because:
- For a = 11, there are 2^(11-1) = 2^10 sets.
- For a = 10, there are 2^(10-1) = 2^9 sets.
- For a = 6, there are 2^(6-1) = 2^5 sets.

The sum of the elements of A is 11 + 10 + 6 = 27.
