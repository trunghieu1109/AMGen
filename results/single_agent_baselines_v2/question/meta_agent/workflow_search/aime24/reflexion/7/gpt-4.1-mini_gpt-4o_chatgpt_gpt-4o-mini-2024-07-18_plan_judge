proposed answer: We are given two logarithmic equations: \( \log_x(y^x) = 10 \) and \( \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 \). We need to find the product \( xy \).

First, let's solve the first equation: \( \log_x(y^x) = 10 \).
This means \( y^x = x^{10} \).
Taking the logarithm base 10 on both sides, we have:
\( x \log_{10}(y) = 10 \log_{10}(x) \).
Rearranging gives us:
\( \log_{10}(y) = \frac{10}{x} \log_{10}(x) \).

Now, let's solve the second equation: \( \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 \).
This means \( x^{4y} = y^{10} \).
Taking the logarithm base 10 on both sides, we have:
\( 4y \log_{10}(x) = 10 \log_{10}(y) \).
Rearranging gives us:
\( \log_{10}(x) = \frac{10}{4y} \log_{10}(y) \).

We now have two expressions:
1. \( \log_{10}(y) = \frac{10}{x} \log_{10}(x) \)
2. \( \log_{10}(x) = \frac{10}{4y} \log_{10}(y) \)

Substitute the second expression into the first:
\( \log_{10}(y) = \frac{10}{x} \left( \frac{10}{4y} \log_{10}(y) \right) \).
Simplifying gives:
\( \log_{10}(y) = \frac{100}{4xy} \log_{10}(y) \).

Assuming \( \log_{10}(y) \neq 0 \), we can divide both sides by \( \log_{10}(y) \):
\( 1 = \frac{100}{4xy} \).
This simplifies to:
\( 4xy = 100 \).
Thus, \( xy = 25 \).
