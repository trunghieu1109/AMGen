Question: Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.

proposed answer: We are given a hyperbola \( \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \) and points \( A, B, C, D \) on this hyperbola such that \( ABCD \) is a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin. The diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles. Let the diagonals be \( AC \) and \( BD \), intersecting at the origin. Since the diagonals bisect each other, the coordinates of \( A \) and \( C \) are \( (x_1, y_1) \) and \( (-x_1, -y_1) \), respectively, and the coordinates of \( B \) and \( D \) are \( (x_2, y_2) \) and \( (-x_2, -y_2) \), respectively. The condition for the points to lie on the hyperbola gives us two equations: \( \frac{x_1^2}{20} - \frac{y_1^2}{24} = 1 \) and \( \frac{x_2^2}{20} - \frac{y_2^2}{24} = 1 \). The diagonals are perpendicular, so \( x_1 x_2 + y_1 y_2 = 0 \). We need to find the greatest real number less than \( BD^2 = 4(x_2^2 + y_2^2) \). To maximize \( x_2^2 + y_2^2 \), we use the constraint \( \frac{x_2^2}{20} - \frac{y_2^2}{24} = 1 \) and the fact that \( x_1 x_2 + y_1 y_2 = 0 \). By symmetry and the properties of the hyperbola, the maximum occurs when \( x_2^2 = 20 \) and \( y_2^2 = 24 \), giving \( x_2^2 + y_2^2 = 44 \). Thus, \( BD^2 = 4 \times 44 = 176 \). The greatest real number less than \( BD^2 \) is 175.
