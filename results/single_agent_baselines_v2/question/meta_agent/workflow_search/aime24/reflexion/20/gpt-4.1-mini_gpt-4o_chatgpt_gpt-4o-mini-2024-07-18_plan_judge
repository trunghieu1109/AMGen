Question: Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.

proposed answer: To find the smallest base b such that there are more than 10 b-beautiful integers, we need to consider the conditions for a number n to be b-beautiful. A b-beautiful integer n is one that has exactly two digits in base b, and the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. In base b, a two-digit number can be expressed as n = ab + c, where a and c are digits (0 <= a, c < b) and a > 0. The condition for n to be b-beautiful is that a + c = sqrt(n). Therefore, n = ab + c = (a + c)^2. We need to find the smallest b such that there are more than 10 such integers n. Let's analyze this step by step:

1. For a number to be two digits in base b, it must be at least b and less than b^2.
2. The number n = ab + c must satisfy n = (a + c)^2, so ab + c = (a + c)^2.
3. Rearranging gives ab + c = a^2 + 2ac + c^2.
4. We need to find pairs (a, c) such that this equation holds and a + c is an integer.
5. We will test small values of b to find the first one with more than 10 solutions.

Let's start with b = 2 and increase b until we find the desired number of solutions.
