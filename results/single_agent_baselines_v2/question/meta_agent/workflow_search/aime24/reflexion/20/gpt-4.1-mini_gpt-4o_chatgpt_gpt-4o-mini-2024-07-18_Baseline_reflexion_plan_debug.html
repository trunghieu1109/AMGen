    <pre>Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.

### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent Jf2Q (yourself):
To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest base b such that there are more than 10 b-beautiful integers. A b-beautiful integer n is one that has exactly two digits in base b, and the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. In base b, a two-digit number can be expressed as n = ab + c, where a and c are digits (0 &lt;= a, c &lt; b) and a &gt; 0. The condition for n to be b-beautiful is that a + c = sqrt(n). Therefore, n = ab + c = (a + c)^2. We need to find the smallest b such that there are more than 10 such integers n. Let&#39;s analyze this step by step:

1. For a number to be two digits in base b, it must be at least b and less than b^2.
2. The number n = ab + c must satisfy n = (a + c)^2, so ab + c = (a + c)^2.
3. Rearranging gives ab + c = a^2 + 2ac + c^2.
4. We need to find pairs (a, c) such that this equation holds and a + c is an integer.
5. We will test small values of b to find the first one with more than 10 solutions.

Let&#39;s start with b = 2 and increase b until we find the desired number of solutions.

11

### feedback #1 by Critic Agent 5mMS:
The reasoning seems to be on the right track, but the final answer might not be correct. We need to verify the calculations for each base to ensure that there are indeed more than 10 b-beautiful integers for the given base.

Given previous attempts and feedback, carefully consider where you could go wrong in your latest attempt. Using insights from previous attempts, try to solve the task better.</pre>
