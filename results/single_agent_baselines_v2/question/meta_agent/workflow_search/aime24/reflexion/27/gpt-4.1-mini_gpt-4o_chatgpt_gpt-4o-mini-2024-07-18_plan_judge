Question: Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To find the greatest four-digit integer N such that changing any one of its digits to 1 results in a number divisible by 7, we start from the largest four-digit number, 9999, and check downwards. For each number, we change each digit to 1 and check divisibility by 7. Once we find such a number, we calculate Q and R, where Q is the quotient and R is the remainder when N is divided by 1000. Finally, we find Q + R.
