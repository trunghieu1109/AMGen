    <pre>We are given two equations involving nonnegative integers a, b, and c. The first equation is a + b + c = 300. The second equation is a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000. We need to find the number of triples (a, b, c) that satisfy both equations. 

First, let&#39;s analyze the second equation. It can be rewritten as a^2(b + c) + b^2(a + c) + c^2(a + b) = 6,000,000. Since a + b + c = 300, we have b + c = 300 - a, a + c = 300 - b, and a + b = 300 - c. Substituting these into the second equation gives:

a^2(300 - a) + b^2(300 - b) + c^2(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

This equation is symmetric in a, b, and c, so we can assume without loss of generality that a &lt;= b &lt;= c. 

Let&#39;s try some small values for a, b, and c to see if we can find any solutions. 

If a = 100, then b + c = 200. The equation becomes 100^2(200) + b^2(300 - b) + c^2(300 - c) = 6,000,000. Simplifying gives 2,000,000 + b^2(300 - b) + c^2(300 - c) = 6,000,000, so b^2(300 - b) + c^2(300 - c) = 4,000,000.

If b = 100, then c = 200. The equation becomes 100^2(200) + 100^2(200) + 200^2(100) = 6,000,000. Simplifying gives 2,000,000 + 2,000,000 + 4,000,000 = 8,000,000, which is not equal to 6,000,000.

If a = 150, then b + c = 150. The equation becomes 150^2(150) + b^2(300 - b) + c^2(300 - c) = 6,000,000. Simplifying gives 3,375,000 + b^2(300 - b) + c^2(300 - c) = 6,000,000, so b^2(300 - b) + c^2(300 - c) = 2,625,000.

If b = 75, then c = 75. The equation becomes 150^2(150) + 75^2(225) + 75^2(225) = 6,000,000. Simplifying gives 3,375,000 + 1,265,625 + 1,265,625 = 5,906,250, which is not equal to 6,000,000.

Let&#39;s try a = 100, b = 100, c = 100. The equation becomes 100^2(200) + 100^2(200) + 100^2(200) = 6,000,000. Simplifying gives 2,000,000 + 2,000,000 + 2,000,000 = 6,000,000, which is equal to 6,000,000.

Therefore, (a, b, c) = (100, 100, 100) is a solution. Since the equation is symmetric, any permutation of (100, 100, 100) is also a solution. There is only one unique triple (100, 100, 100) since all elements are the same.

Thus, there is only 1 triple of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfies both equations.
