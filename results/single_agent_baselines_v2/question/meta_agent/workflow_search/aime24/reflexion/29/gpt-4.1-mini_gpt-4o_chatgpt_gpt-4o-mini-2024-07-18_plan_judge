Question: There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\times5$ grid such that: 

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To solve this problem, we need to place chips in a 5x5 grid such that each row and each column contains chips of the same color, and any additional chip would violate this condition. This means that each row and each column must be either completely filled with white chips or completely filled with black chips. Since there are 5 rows and 5 columns, we can choose any number of rows to be filled with white chips, and the remaining rows will be filled with black chips. Similarly, we can choose any number of columns to be filled with white chips, and the remaining columns will be filled with black chips. The key is that the number of rows filled with white chips must equal the number of columns filled with white chips, because otherwise, we would not be able to fill the grid completely without violating the condition that all chips in the same row and column have the same color. Therefore, if we choose k rows to be filled with white chips, we must also choose k columns to be filled with white chips, and the remaining 5-k rows and 5-k columns will be filled with black chips. The number of ways to choose k rows out of 5 is \( \binom{5}{k} \), and the number of ways to choose k columns out of 5 is also \( \binom{5}{k} \). Thus, for each k, there are \( \binom{5}{k}^2 \) ways to fill the grid. We sum this over all possible values of k from 0 to 5. Therefore, the total number of ways is \( \sum_{k=0}^{5} \binom{5}{k}^2 \). This is a known combinatorial identity, and the sum is equal to \( \binom{10}{5} \).
