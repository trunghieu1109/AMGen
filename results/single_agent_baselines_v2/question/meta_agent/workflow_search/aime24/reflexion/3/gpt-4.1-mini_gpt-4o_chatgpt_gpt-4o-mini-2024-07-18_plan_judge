Question: Define $f(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{4}|$. Find the number of intersections of the graphs of \[y=4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \quad\text{ and }\quad x=4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))).\]
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To find the number of intersections, we need to solve the system of equations given by the functions. We have y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). First, analyze f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. This function is 0 when |x| = 1/2, and increases linearly away from these points. Similarly, g(x) = ||x| - 1/4| is 0 when |x| = 1/4, and increases linearly away from these points. The function y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) will have values based on the behavior of sin(2πx), which ranges from -1 to 1. The function x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) will have values based on the behavior of cos(3πy), which also ranges from -1 to 1. We need to find the values of x and y that satisfy both equations simultaneously. By analyzing the behavior of the functions and the periodicity of sine and cosine, we can determine the number of solutions. The key is to find when both expressions are equal, considering the periodicity and piecewise nature of the functions.
