    <pre>Let $\triangle ABC$ have circumcenter $O$ and incenter $I$ with $\overline{IA}\perp\overline{OI}$, circumradius $13$, and inradius $6$. Find $AB\cdot AC$.

### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent Soih (yourself):
We are given a triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with circumcenter \( O \) and incenter \( I \). The circumradius \( R = 13 \) and the inradius \( r = 6 \). We also know that \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \). We need to find \( AB \cdot AC \).

The condition \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \) implies that \( A \) is the excenter opposite \( A \) of the triangle formed by \( O, I, A \). This is a special configuration where the triangle is right-angled at \( A \).

In a right triangle, the circumradius \( R \) is half the hypotenuse. Since \( R = 13 \), the hypotenuse \( BC = 26 \).

The formula for the area \( K \) of a triangle in terms of its inradius \( r \) and semiperimeter \( s \) is \( K = rs \). The semiperimeter \( s = \frac{a + b + c}{2} \), where \( a, b, c \) are the side lengths.

For a right triangle, the area \( K \) is also \( \frac{1}{2} \times AB \times AC \). We have \( K = 6s \) and \( K = \frac{1}{2} \times AB \times AC \).

Since \( BC = 26 \), let \( AB = c \) and \( AC = b \). Then \( s = \frac{b + c + 26}{2} \).

Equating the two expressions for \( K \), we have:
\[ 6 \left( \frac{b + c + 26}{2} \right) = \frac{1}{2} bc \]
\[ 6(b + c + 26) = bc \]

We solve for \( bc \) using this equation.

### feedback #1 by Critic Agent CzJw:
The reasoning is mostly correct, but there is a mistake in the interpretation of the condition \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \). This condition implies that the triangle is not necessarily right-angled at \( A \). Instead, it is a special property of the triangle&#39;s configuration. The correct approach involves using the formula \( R^2 = OI^2 + 2Rr \) for the distance between the circumcenter and incenter, which leads to the correct calculation of \( AB \cdot AC \).

Given previous attempts and feedback, carefully consider where you could go wrong in your latest attempt. Using insights from previous attempts, try to solve the task better.</pre>
