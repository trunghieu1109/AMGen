This condition implies that the triangle is not necessarily right-angled at \\( A \\). Instead, it is a special property of the triangle's configuration. The correct approach involves using the formula \\( R^2 = OI^2 + 2Rr \\) for the distance between the circumcenter and incenter, which leads to the correct calculation of \\( AB \\cdot AC \\).\n\nGiven previous attempts and feedback, carefully consider where you could go wrong in your latest attempt.
