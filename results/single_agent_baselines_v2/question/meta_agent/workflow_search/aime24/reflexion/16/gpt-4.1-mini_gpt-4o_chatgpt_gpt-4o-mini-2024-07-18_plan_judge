Question: Let $\triangle ABC$ have circumcenter $O$ and incenter $I$ with $\overline{IA}\perp\overline{OI}$, circumradius $13$, and inradius $6$. Find $AB\cdot AC$.
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: We are given a triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with circumcenter \( O \) and incenter \( I \). The circumradius \( R = 13 \) and the inradius \( r = 6 \). We also know that \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \). We need to find \( AB \cdot AC \). The condition \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \) implies that \( A \) is the excenter opposite \( A \) of the triangle formed by \( O, I, A \). This is a special configuration where the triangle is right-angled at \( A \). In a right triangle, the circumradius \( R \) is half the hypotenuse. Since \( R = 13 \), the hypotenuse \( BC = 26 \). The formula for the area \( K \) of a triangle in terms of its inradius \( r \) and semiperimeter \( s \) is \( K = rs \). The semiperimeter \( s = \frac{a + b + c}{2} \), where \( a, b, c \) are the side lengths. For a right triangle, the area \( K \) is also \( \frac{1}{2} \times AB \times AC \). We have \( K = 6s \) and \( K = \frac{1}{2} \times AB \times AC \). Since \( BC = 26 \), let \( AB = c \) and \( AC = b \). Then \( s = \frac{b + c + 26}{2} \). Equating the two expressions for \( K \), we have: \[ 6 \left( \frac{b + c + 26}{2} \right) = \frac{1}{2} bc \] \[ 6(b + c + 26) = bc \] We solve for \( bc \) using this equation.
