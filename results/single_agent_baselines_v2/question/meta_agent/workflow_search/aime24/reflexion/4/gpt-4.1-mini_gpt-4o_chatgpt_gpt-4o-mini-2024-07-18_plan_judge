proposed answer: To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest prime number p such that there exists a positive integer n for which n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2. This means n^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod p^2). First, let's consider the condition n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p^2). For this to happen, -1 must be a fourth power residue modulo p^2. We start by checking small primes. For p = 2, n^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 4) implies n^4 ≡ -1 (mod 4), which is not possible since n^4 ≡ 0 or 1 (mod 4). For p = 3, n^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 9) implies n^4 ≡ -1 (mod 9). Testing small values of n, we find that n = 2 works because 2^4 = 16 and 16 + 1 = 17, which is not divisible by 9. For p = 5, n^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 25) implies n^4 ≡ -1 (mod 25). Testing small values of n, we find that n = 3 works because 3^4 = 81 and 81 + 1 = 82, which is divisible by 25. Therefore, p = 5 is the smallest prime for which there exists an n such that n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2. Now, we need to find the smallest positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 25. We already found that m = 3 works, as 3^4 + 1 = 82 is divisible by 25.
