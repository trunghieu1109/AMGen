    <pre>Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?

Please think step by step and then solve the task.</pre>

    <pre>To solve this problem, we need to consider the symmetries of the regular octagon and how the coloring can be invariant under these symmetries. A regular octagon has 8 rotational symmetries (0, 45, 90, 135, 180, 225, 270, and 315 degrees). We want the coloring to be such that there exists a rotation that maps all blue vertices to positions that were originally red. This means that the number of blue and red vertices must be equal, as each rotation is a permutation of the vertices. Therefore, we need to count the number of colorings with 4 blue and 4 red vertices that are invariant under some rotation. The total number of ways to color the octagon with 4 blue and 4 red vertices is \( \binom{8}{4} = 70 \). We apply Burnside&#39;s Lemma to count the number of colorings invariant under the group of rotations. For each rotation, we count the number of colorings that remain unchanged. For the identity rotation (0 degrees), all 70 colorings are unchanged. For 90, 180, and 270 degrees, no coloring with 4 blue and 4 red vertices can be invariant, as these rotations would require all vertices to be the same color. For 45, 135, 225, and 315 degrees, the octagon is divided into 8 cycles of length 1, so no coloring with 4 blue and 4 red vertices can be invariant. Therefore, only the identity rotation contributes, and the number of invariant colorings is 70. By Burnside&#39;s Lemma, the number of distinct colorings is \( \frac{70}{8} = 8.75 \), which is not an integer, indicating a mistake. Re-evaluating, we realize that the problem asks for the probability that such a rotation exists, not the number of distinct colorings. The probability is the number of favorable colorings divided by the total number of colorings. The total number of colorings is \( 2^8 = 256 \). The number of favorable colorings is 8 (one for each rotation of a single 4-blue, 4-red pattern). Thus, the probability is \( \frac{8}{256} = \frac{1}{32} \). Therefore, \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 32 \), so \( m+n = 33 \).
