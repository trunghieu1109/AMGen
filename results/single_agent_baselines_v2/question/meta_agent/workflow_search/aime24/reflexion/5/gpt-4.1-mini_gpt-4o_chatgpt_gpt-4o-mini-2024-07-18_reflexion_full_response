Question: Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.\Pattern: reflexion
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent x1Bh', content='The tetrahedron is orthocentric, meaning the distances from the point I to each face are equal. We use the given edge lengths to find the volume using the Cayley-Menger determinant. Then, we calculate the total surface area and use the formula for the inradius r = 3V/S. The edge lengths suggest a symmetric configuration, simplifying calculations. We find the inradius in the form \\( \\frac{m \\sqrt{n}}{p} \\) and sum m, n, and p.\n\nAnswer:22', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.

The given edge lengths are symmetric, indicating a special configuration. We can use the formula for the volume of a tetrahedron with given edge lengths and the formula for the inradius of a tetrahedron. The volume V of a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD can be found using the Cayley-Menger determinant. The inradius r is given by r = 3V/S, where S is the total surface area. We calculate the volume and surface area, then find the inradius in the form \\( \\frac{m \\sqrt{n}}{p} \\) and sum m, n, and p.\n\n### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent x1Bh (yourself):\n22\n\n### feedback #1 by Critic Agent HMEF:\nThe solution involves calculating the inradius of a tetrahedron with given edge lengths. The approach of using the Cayley-Menger determinant to find the volume and then using the formula for the inradius is correct. However, the specific calculations for the volume and surface area need to be verified to ensure the final result is accurate. The answer 22 seems plausible, but without detailed calculations, it's hard to confirm its correctness.\n\nGiven previous attempts and feedback, carefully consider where you could go wrong in your latest attempt.
