Question: Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The tetrahedron is orthocentric, meaning the distances from the point I to each face are equal. We use the given edge lengths to find the volume using the Cayley-Menger determinant. Then, we calculate the total surface area and use the formula for the inradius r = 3V/S. The edge lengths suggest a symmetric configuration, simplifying calculations. We find the inradius in the form \( \frac{m \sqrt{n}}{p} \) and sum m, n, and p.
