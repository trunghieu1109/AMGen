Question: Rectangles $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are drawn such that $D,E,C,F$ are collinear. Also, $A,D,H,G$ all lie on a circle. If $BC=16$,$AB=107$,$FG=17$, and $EF=184$, what is the length of $CE$?
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: We have two rectangles ABCD and EFGH. Points D, E, C, F are collinear, and A, D, H, G are concyclic. We need to find the length of CE. Since D, E, C, F are collinear, CE is part of the line segment DECF. The length of DECF is the sum of BC and FG, which is 16 + 17 = 33. However, this is not the correct approach. Instead, we should consider the positions of the points. Since D, E, C, F are collinear, and we have the lengths of the sides of the rectangles, we can find CE by considering the positions of the points. The length of CE is actually the difference between EF and BC, which is 184 - 16 = 168.
