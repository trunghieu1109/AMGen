Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent ckDN', content='Let z = re^{i\\theta} where r = |z| = 4. Then z = 4e^{i\\theta} and \\frac{1}{z} = \\frac{1}{4}e^{-i\\theta}. The expression becomes (75+117i)(4e^{i\\theta}) + (96+144i)(\\frac{1}{4}e^{-i\\theta}). Simplifying, we get 300e^{i\\theta} + 468ie^{i\\theta} + 24e^{-i\\theta} + 36ie^{-i\\theta}. The real part is 300\\cos\\theta + 24\\cos\\theta + 468\\sin\\theta + 36\\sin\\theta = 324\\cos\\theta + 504\\sin\\theta. To maximize this, we use the identity a\\cos\\theta + b\\sin\\theta = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\\cos(\\theta - \\phi) where \\tan\\phi = \\frac{b}{a}. Here, a = 324, b = 504, so \\sqrt{324^2 + 504^2} = 612. Therefore, the maximum value is 612.\n\nAnswer:612', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
