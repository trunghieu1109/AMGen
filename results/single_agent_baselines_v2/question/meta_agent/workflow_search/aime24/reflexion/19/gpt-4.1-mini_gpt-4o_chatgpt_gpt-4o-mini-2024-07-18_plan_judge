proposed answer: To solve this problem, we need to evaluate the product \( P = \prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k}) \) where \( \omega \) is a primitive 13th root of unity. We know that \( \omega^k \) for \( k = 0, 1, \ldots, 12 \) are the 13th roots of unity. The expression inside the product can be rewritten as \( 2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k} = (1 - \omega^k)^2 + 1 \). This simplifies to \( (1 - \omega^k)^2 + 1 = 1 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k} + 1 = 2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k} \). Now, we need to evaluate the product \( P = \prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) \). Notice that \( \omega^k \) are the roots of the polynomial \( x^{13} - 1 = 0 \). The polynomial \( x^{13} - 1 \) can be factored as \( (x - 1)(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1) \). The roots of \( x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1 = 0 \) are precisely \( \omega, \omega^2, \ldots, \omega^{12} \). Therefore, the product \( P \) can be seen as evaluating the polynomial \( f(x) = \prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2x + x^2) \) at the roots of unity. We can simplify \( 2 - 2x + x^2 \) as \( (x - 1)^2 + 1 \). Thus, \( f(x) = \prod_{k=0}^{12} ((x - 1)^2 + 1) \). Evaluating this at the roots of unity, we have \( f(\omega^k) = (\omega^k - 1)^2 + 1 \). The product \( P \) is then the product of these evaluations. Since the roots of unity are symmetric, the product simplifies to a constant value. We can use the fact that the product of all non-trivial 13th roots of unity is 1. Therefore, the product \( P \) is equivalent to evaluating the polynomial at 1, which is \( f(1) = \prod_{k=0}^{12} ((1 - 1)^2 + 1) = 1^{13} = 1 \). However, we need to consider the symmetry and the fact that the product of all roots of unity is 1. Therefore, the product \( P \) is actually 13. We need to find the remainder of 13 when divided by 1000, which is simply 13.
