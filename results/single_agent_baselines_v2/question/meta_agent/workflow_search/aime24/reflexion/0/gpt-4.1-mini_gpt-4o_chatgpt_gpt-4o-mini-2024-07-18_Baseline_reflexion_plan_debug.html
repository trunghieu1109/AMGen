    <pre>Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.

Please think step by step and then solve the task.</pre>

    <pre>Let&#39;s first determine Aya&#39;s walking speed and the time spent in the coffee shop. We know that when Aya walks at speed s km/h, the total time is 4 hours, including t minutes in the coffee shop. Therefore, the walking time is 4 hours - t minutes. Since she walks 9 km, we have the equation: 9/s = 4 - t/60. When she walks at speed s+2 km/h, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, including t minutes in the coffee shop. Therefore, the walking time is 2 hours and 24 minutes - t minutes. Converting 2 hours and 24 minutes to hours, we get 2 + 24/60 = 2.4 hours. So, 9/(s+2) = 2.4 - t/60. We have two equations: 9/s = 4 - t/60 and 9/(s+2) = 2.4 - t/60. Solving these equations simultaneously, we find s = 3 km/h and t = 60 minutes. Now, if Aya walks at speed s+1/2 = 3.5 km/h, the walking time is 9/3.5 hours. Converting this to minutes, we get (9/3.5) * 60 minutes. Adding the 60 minutes spent in the coffee shop, we find the total time in minutes.
