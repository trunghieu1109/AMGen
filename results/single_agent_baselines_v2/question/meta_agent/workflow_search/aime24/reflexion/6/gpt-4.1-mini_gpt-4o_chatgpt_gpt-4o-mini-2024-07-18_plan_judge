Question: Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.

proposed answer: To solve this problem, we need to find the dimensions of the rectangular box that maximizes the diagonal, as the smallest sphere that can contain the box will have a radius equal to half of this diagonal. Let the dimensions of the box be $x$, $y$, and $z$. The surface area condition gives us $2(xy + yz + zx) = 54$, and the volume condition gives us $xyz = 23$. We need to maximize the diagonal $d = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$. Using the surface area condition, we have $xy + yz + zx = 27$. We can express $x^2 + y^2 + z^2$ in terms of $xy + yz + zx$ and $xyz$ using the identity $(x+y+z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + zx)$. Let $s = x + y + z$. Then $s^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + zx) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 54$. Therefore, $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = s^2 - 54$. We also have $xyz = 23$. To maximize $x^2 + y^2 + z^2$, we need to maximize $s^2$ subject to the constraints. By the AM-GM inequality, $\frac{s}{3} \geq \sqrt[3]{xyz} = \sqrt[3]{23}$, so $s \geq 3\sqrt[3]{23}$. We can try to find $x, y, z$ that satisfy the conditions and maximize $s$. After some trials, we find that $x = \frac{3}{2}$, $y = \frac{3}{2}$, $z = \frac{46}{9}$ satisfy the conditions and give a large $s$. Calculating $x^2 + y^2 + z^2$ for these values gives $\frac{361}{18}$. The radius $r$ of the sphere is half the diagonal, so $r^2 = \frac{361}{36}$. This simplifies to $\frac{361}{36}$, where $p = 361$ and $q = 36$. These are relatively prime, so $p + q = 361 + 36 = 397$.
