Question: Find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon ($12$-gon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The diagram below shows three of those rectangles.
[asy] unitsize(0.6 inch); for(int i=0; i<360; i+=30) { dot(dir(i), 4+black); draw(dir(i)--dir(i+30)); } draw(dir(120)--dir(330)); filldraw(dir(210)--dir(240)--dir(30)--dir(60)--cycle, mediumgray, linewidth(1.5)); draw((0,0.366)--(0.366,0), linewidth(1.5)); [/asy]

proposed answer: To find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon, we need to consider the vertices of the dodecagon. A regular dodecagon has 12 vertices. A rectangle is defined by choosing two pairs of parallel sides. In a regular dodecagon, the sides and diagonals can be used to form these parallel sides. We can label the vertices of the dodecagon as 1, 2, ..., 12. A rectangle can be formed by choosing two pairs of opposite vertices. For a regular polygon with 12 sides, the opposite vertices are separated by 6 positions. Therefore, we can choose any vertex and its opposite vertex, and then choose another pair of opposite vertices that are perpendicular to the first pair. The number of ways to choose the first pair of opposite vertices is 6 (since there are 12 vertices and each pair is separated by 6 positions). For each choice of the first pair, there are 2 ways to choose the second pair of opposite vertices (since the second pair must be perpendicular to the first pair). Therefore, the total number of rectangles is 6 * 2 = 12.
