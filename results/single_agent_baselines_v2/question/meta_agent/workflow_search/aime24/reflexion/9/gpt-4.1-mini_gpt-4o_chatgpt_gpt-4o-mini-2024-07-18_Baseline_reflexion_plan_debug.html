    <pre>Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent ZUUm (yourself):
To solve this problem, we need to calculate two probabilities: the probability of winning a prize and the probability of winning the grand prize given that a prize is won. First, we calculate the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from the set S, which is \( \binom{10}{4} = 210 \). Next, we calculate the number of ways to win a prize, which means at least 2 of Jen&#39;s numbers are among the 4 chosen numbers. We use complementary counting: first calculate the number of ways to choose 4 numbers such that fewer than 2 of Jen&#39;s numbers are chosen, and subtract from the total. Finally, we calculate the number of ways to win the grand prize, which is when all 4 of Jen&#39;s numbers are chosen. The probability of winning the grand prize given that a prize is won is the ratio of these two probabilities.

### feedback #1 by Critic Agent gJEQ:
The solution approach is correct, but the final answer needs verification. Let&#39;s break it down: The total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is 210. To win a prize, at least 2 of Jen&#39;s numbers must be chosen. We calculate the number of ways to choose 2, 3, or 4 of Jen&#39;s numbers and the remaining from the rest. The number of ways to win the grand prize is when all 4 of Jen&#39;s numbers are chosen. The probability of winning the grand prize given a prize is the ratio of these probabilities. The final answer should be verified by recalculating these probabilities.
