Question: Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of winning a prize and the probability of winning the grand prize given that a prize is won. First, calculate the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from the set S, which is \( \binom{10}{4} = 210 \). Next, calculate the number of ways to win a prize, which means at least 2 of Jen's numbers are among the 4 chosen numbers. We use complementary counting: first calculate the number of ways to choose 4 numbers such that fewer than 2 of Jen's numbers are chosen, and subtract from the total. Finally, calculate the number of ways to win the grand prize, which is when all 4 of Jen's numbers are chosen. The probability of winning the grand prize given that a prize is won is the ratio of these two probabilities. Let's calculate these probabilities step by step.
