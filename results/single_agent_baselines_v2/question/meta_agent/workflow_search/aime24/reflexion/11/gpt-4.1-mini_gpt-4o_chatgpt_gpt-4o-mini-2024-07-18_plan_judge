Question: Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.

proposed answer: To solve this problem, we need to find paths on an 8x8 grid from the lower left corner to the upper right corner that change direction exactly four times. A path from (0,0) to (8,8) consists of 8 right (R) moves and 8 up (U) moves, totaling 16 moves. A change in direction occurs when a sequence of R's is followed by a sequence of U's or vice versa. To have exactly four changes in direction, the path must consist of five segments, alternating between R's and U's. The possible segment patterns are R-U-R-U-R or U-R-U-R-U. Each segment must have at least one move, and the total number of R's is 8 and the total number of U's is 8. We can use the stars and bars method to distribute the moves among the segments. For the R-U-R-U-R pattern, let the segments have lengths a, b, c, d, e, where a, c, e are R's and b, d are U's. We have a + c + e = 8 and b + d = 8, with a, b, c, d, e >= 1. Set a' = a-1, b' = b-1, c' = c-1, d' = d-1, e' = e-1, so a', b', c', d', e' >= 0. Then a' + c' + e' = 5 and b' + d' = 6. The number of solutions is C(7,2) * C(7,1). Similarly, for the U-R-U-R-U pattern, the number of solutions is the same. Therefore, the total number of paths is 2 * C(7,2) * C(7,1).
