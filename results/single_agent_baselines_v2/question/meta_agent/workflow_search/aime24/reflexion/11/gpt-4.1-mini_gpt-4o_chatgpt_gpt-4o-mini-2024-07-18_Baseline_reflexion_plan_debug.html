    <pre>To solve this problem, we need to find paths on an 8x8 grid from the lower left corner to the upper right corner that change direction exactly four times. A path from (0,0) to (8,8) consists of 8 right (R) moves and 8 up (U) moves, totaling 16 moves. A change in direction occurs when a sequence of R&#39;s is followed by a sequence of U&#39;s or vice versa. To have exactly four changes in direction, the path must consist of five segments, alternating between R&#39;s and U&#39;s. The possible segment patterns are R-U-R-U-R or U-R-U-R-U. Each segment must have at least one move, and the total number of R&#39;s is 8 and the total number of U&#39;s is 8. We can use the stars and bars method to distribute the moves among the segments. For the R-U-R-U-R pattern, let the segments have lengths a, b, c, d, e, where a, c, e are R&#39;s and b, d are U&#39;s. We have a + c + e = 8 and b + d = 8, with a, b, c, d, e &gt;= 1. Set a&#39; = a-1, b&#39; = b-1, c&#39; = c-1, d&#39; = d-1, e&#39; = e-1, so a&#39;, b&#39;, c&#39;, d&#39;, e&#39; &gt;= 0. Then a&#39; + c&#39; + e&#39; = 5 and b&#39; + d&#39; = 6. The number of solutions is C(7,2) * C(7,1). Similarly, for the U-R-U-R-U pattern, the number of solutions is the same. Therefore, the total number of paths is 2 * C(7,2) * C(7,1).
