    <pre>Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice&#39;s play.

Please think step by step and then solve the task.</pre>

    <pre>To solve this problem, we need to determine for which values of n Bob has a winning strategy. This is a combinatorial game theory problem, where we identify winning and losing positions. A losing position is one where any move leaves the opponent in a winning position, and a winning position is one where there is at least one move that leaves the opponent in a losing position. We start by analyzing small values of n to identify the pattern. For n = 1, Alice wins by taking 1 token. For n = 2, Alice wins by taking 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob, which is a losing position for him. For n = 3, Alice wins by taking 1 token, leaving 2 for Bob, which is a losing position. For n = 4, Alice can take all 4 tokens and win. For n = 5, Alice can take 4 tokens, leaving 1 for Bob, which is a losing position. By checking these small values, we see that n = 1 is a losing position for the first player, and n = 2, 3, 4, 5 are winning positions for the first player. Continuing this analysis, we find that positions n = 1, 6, 7, 11, 12, 13, 17, 18, 19, ... (numbers of the form 4k + 1) are losing positions. The pattern is such that n ≡ 1 (mod 4) are losing positions. To find how many such numbers are there up to 2024, we solve the congruence n ≡ 1 (mod 4) for n ≤ 2024. The sequence starts at n = 1 and proceeds as 1, 5, 9, ..., up to the largest number ≤ 2024. The general term is 1 + 4k, where k is a non-negative integer. Setting 1 + 4k ≤ 2024 gives k ≤ 506. Therefore, there are 507 such numbers.
