\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\]
is divided by 1000.

proposed answer: To solve this problem, we need to evaluate the product \( \prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k}) \) where \( \omega \) is a 13th root of unity. First, note that \( \omega^k \) are the distinct 13th roots of unity, and \( \omega^{13} = 1 \). The expression inside the product can be rewritten as \( 2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k} = (1 - \omega^k)^2 + (\omega^k)^2 \). Consider the polynomial \( P(x) = x^{13} - 1 \) which factors as \( (x-1)(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1) \). The roots of \( x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1 = 0 \) are precisely \( \omega, \omega^2, \ldots, \omega^{12} \). Using properties of roots of unity, we know that \( \prod_{k=0}^{12} (x - \omega^k) = x^{13} - 1 \). The expression \( 2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k} \) can be rewritten using the identity \( 2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k} = (1 - \omega^k)^2 + (\omega^k)^2 \), and we can use properties of cyclotomic polynomials to simplify this expression. The product of all terms \( 2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k} \) over one full cycle of roots of unity can be tackled using symmetry and properties of the roots. Finally, we compute the result modulo 1000.
