    <pre>To solve this problem, we need to consider paths from the lower left corner to the upper right corner of an 8x8 grid that change direction exactly four times. A path consists of 16 steps: 8 right (R) and 8 up (U). Changing direction means switching from R to U or U to R. With exactly four changes, the path can be divided into five segments, alternating between horizontal and vertical. Each segment must have a positive number of steps. We can represent this as choosing 4 positions to change direction out of the 15 possible positions (between the steps). We also need to ensure the path ends at (8,8), which means the total number of R and U steps must be 8 each. The problem reduces to finding the number of ways to distribute 8 R&#39;s and 8 U&#39;s into 5 segments, ensuring each segment has at least one step. Each segment alternates between R and U, starting with either R or U, and there are two cases: starting with R or starting with U. For each case, we can use the stars and bars method to calculate the number of distributions. The number of ways to distribute 8 R&#39;s into 3 segments (with each segment having at least one R) is the same as distributing 5 R&#39;s into 3 segments (since each must have at least 1), which is \( \binom{7}{2} \). Similarly, distributing 8 U&#39;s into 2 segments is \( \binom{7}{1} \). The total number of paths for each case is the product of these combinations. We then add the results for both starting cases to get the final answer.
