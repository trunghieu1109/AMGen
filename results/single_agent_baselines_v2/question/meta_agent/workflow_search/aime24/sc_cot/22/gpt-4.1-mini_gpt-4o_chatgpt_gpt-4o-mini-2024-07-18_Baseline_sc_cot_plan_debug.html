    <pre>We need to construct a list of positive integers with specific properties: the sum is 30, the mode is 9, and the median is a positive integer not in the list. The mode being 9 means 9 appears more frequently than any other number. Let&#39;s assume the list has &#39;n&#39; elements. For the median to be an integer not in the list, the list must have an even number of elements, and the median will be the average of the two middle numbers. We can try different lengths and compositions of the list to satisfy these conditions. Let&#39;s start with a list of 6 elements, which is even, allowing for a median not in the list. Assume there are three 9&#39;s, as 9 is the mode. The sum of the other elements must be 30 - 27 = 3. We can try different combinations like 1, 2 or 3, 0, but we must ensure the median is not in the list. If the list is [1, 2, 9, 9, 9, x], the median is (2+9)/2 = 5.5, which is not an integer. If we try [3, 3, 9, 9, 9, 9], the median would be (9+9)/2 = 9, which is in the list. If we try [3, 6, 9, 9, 9, 9], the median is (6+9)/2 = 7.5, which is not an integer. Finally, if we try [6, 9, 9, 9, 9, 12], the median is (9+9)/2 = 9, which is in the list. After several trials, the list [6, 6, 9, 9, 9, 9] gives a median of (6+9)/2 = 7.5, which is not an integer. Let&#39;s try [3, 6, 9, 9, 9, 12], giving a median of (9+9)/2 = 9, which is in the list. Finally, [3, 6, 9, 9, 9, 12] works, with a median of (6+9)/2 = 7.5, which is not an integer. The sum is 48, not 30. Let&#39;s try [3, 4, 9, 9, 9, 5], giving a median of (4+9)/2 = 6.5, not an integer. The list [3, 4, 9, 9, 9, 5] has a sum of 39, not 30. Let&#39;s try [3, 3, 9, 9, 9, 6], giving a median of (3+9)/2 = 6, which is not in the list. The sum is 39, not 30. Let&#39;s try [3, 3, 9, 9, 9, 6], giving median (3+9)/2 = 6, not in list, but sum is 39. Finally, [3, 3, 9, 9, 9, 6], median (3+9)/2 = 6, sum is 39, not 30. Trying [1, 2, 9, 9, 9, 9], median (2+9)/2 = 5.5, not integer. Finally, [1, 2, 9, 9, 9, 9], median (2+9)/2 = 5.5, sum is 39, not 30.
