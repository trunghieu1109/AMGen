Question: Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: To solve the problem, we need to calculate two probabilities: the probability of Jen winning a prize (at least 2 numbers match) and the probability of Jen winning the grand prize (all 4 numbers match) given that she won a prize.

First, calculate the total number of ways to choose any 4 numbers from the set S, which is \( \binom{10}{4} = 210 \).

Next, calculate the number of ways Jen can win a prize. She wins a prize if at least 2 of her numbers are among the 4 randomly chosen numbers. This can happen in several ways:
1. Exactly 2 of her numbers match: Choose 2 of her 4 numbers to match and 2 from the remaining 6 numbers in S to complete the 4 chosen numbers.
2. Exactly 3 of her numbers match: Choose 3 of her 4 numbers to match and 1 from the remaining 6 numbers in S.
3. All 4 of her numbers match: This is the grand prize.

Calculate each case:
- For exactly 2 matches: \( \binom{4}{2} \cdot \binom{6}{2} = 6 \cdot 15 = 90 \)
- For exactly 3 matches: \( \binom{4}{3} \cdot \binom{6}{1} = 4 \cdot 6 = 24 \)
- For exactly 4 matches: \( \binom{4}{4} = 1 \)

Total ways to win a prize: \( 90 + 24 + 1 = 115 \)

Now, the probability of winning any prize is \( \frac{115}{210} \).

The probability of winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is the probability of winning the grand prize (1 way) divided by the probability of winning any prize (115 ways): \( \frac{1}{115} \).

Thus, the probability of winning the grand prize given winning a prize is \( \frac{1}{115} \). The fraction is already in simplest form, so \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 115 \).

Finally, calculate \( m + n = 1 + 115 = 116 \).
