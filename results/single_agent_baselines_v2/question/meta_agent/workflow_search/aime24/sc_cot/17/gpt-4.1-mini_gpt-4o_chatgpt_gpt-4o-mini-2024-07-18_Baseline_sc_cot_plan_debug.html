    <pre>We are given two equations involving nonnegative integers (a, b, c). The first equation is a + b + c = 300, and the second is a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000. We need to find the number of triples (a, b, c) that satisfy both equations.

Let&#39;s examine the second equation. It can be rewritten as:

ab(a + b) + bc(b + c) + ca(c + a) = 6,000,000.

Substituting the first equation a + b + c = 300 into this, we get:

ab(300 - c) + bc(300 - a) + ca(300 - b) = 6,000,000.

Simplifying, we have:

300(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 6,000,000.

Therefore, ab + bc + ca = (6,000,000 + abc) / 300.

Let’s assume the simplest case where a, b, and c are approximately equal, because they add up to 300 and are supposed to give a specific sum for the second equation.

If a = b = c = 100, then:

ab + bc + ca = 3(100 * 100) = 30,000.

And abc = 100 * 100 * 100 = 1,000,000.

Substituting these into the equation:

300(30,000) - 1,000,000 = 9,000,000 - 1,000,000 = 8,000,000.

This does not equal 6,000,000, so a = b = c = 100 is not a solution.

Let&#39;s try a different approach by setting one variable to 0 to simplify calculations. Assume c = 0, then a + b = 300 and the equation becomes:

a^2b + b^2a = 6,000,000.

Factoring, we get ab(a + b) = 6,000,000, and since a + b = 300, we have ab * 300 = 6,000,000, so ab = 20,000.

Now we solve ab = 20,000 with a + b = 300. Substitute b = 300 - a into ab = 20,000:

a(300 - a) = 20,000.

300a - a^2 = 20,000.

a^2 - 300a + 20,000 = 0.

Using the quadratic formula, a = [300 ± sqrt(300^2 - 4 * 20,000)] / 2.

300^2 = 90,000 and 4 * 20,000 = 80,000, so:

sqrt(90,000 - 80,000) = sqrt(10,000) = 100.

Thus, a = (300 ± 100) / 2.

a = 200/2 = 100 or a = 400/2 = 200.

If a = 100, then b = 300 - 100 = 200.
If a = 200, then b = 300 - 200 = 100.

Both (a, b) pairs satisfy ab = 20,000.

For each pair, c = 0.

Thus, the solutions are (a, b, c) = (100, 200, 0) and (200, 100, 0).

Due to symmetry, these two solutions account for all permutations of a, b, and c being nonnegative integers.

Therefore, the number of triples (a, b, c) is 2.
