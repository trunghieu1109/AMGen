    <pre>Let&#39;s analyze the problem step by step. Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers such that the maximum element of B is in A. For a given integer a in A, the number of nonempty subsets B with max element a is 2^(a-1) because we can choose any subset of {1, 2, ..., a-1} to include in B along with a. Therefore, the total number of sets B is the sum of 2^(a-1) for all a in A. We are given that this total is 2024. We need to find the set A that satisfies this condition and then find the sum of the elements in A.

First, let&#39;s express 2024 as a sum of powers of 2. We have:
2024 = 2^10 - 2^3 = 1024 + 512 + 256 + 128 + 64 + 32 + 8 = 2^10 + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^3.

This implies that A should contain the elements corresponding to these powers plus one, i.e., A = {4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11}.

Now, let&#39;s find the sum of the elements of A:
4 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 = 55.

Therefore, the sum of the elements of A is 55.
