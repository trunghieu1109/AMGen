Question: Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?

proposed answer: We have a regular octagon with 8 vertices, and each vertex is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability, meaning each vertex has a 50% chance of being red and a 50% chance of being blue. We need to find the probability that the octagon can be rotated such that all blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices.

The total number of colorings is 2^8, since each of the 8 vertices can be either red or blue.

We are interested in colorings that are rotationally symmetric, i.e., can be rotated to match the original coloring in a way that all blue vertices are at positions that were originally red.

Consider the 8 possible rotations of the octagon: 0°, 45°, 90°, 135°, 180°, 225°, 270°, and 315°.

For a coloring to be rotationally symmetric, the number of red vertices must equal the number of blue vertices. Thus, we must have an equal number of red and blue vertices, i.e., 4 red and 4 blue.

We count the number of colorings with 4 red and 4 blue vertices: this is \( \binom{8}{4} = 70 \).

For each of these colorings, we need to check if there is a rotation that maps blue vertices to original red positions. Each coloring can be rotated in 8 different ways, but only one of these rotations (the identity rotation) will map blue vertices to original red positions.

Therefore, the probability that a given coloring is rotationally symmetric is \( \frac{1}{8} \).

The probability that a coloring has 4 red and 4 blue vertices is \( \frac{70}{256} \).

Thus, the probability that a coloring is both balanced and rotationally symmetric is \( \frac{70}{256} \times \frac{1}{8} = \frac{70}{2048} \).

Simplifying \( \frac{70}{2048} \), we get \( \frac{35}{1024} \).

Thus, the probability is \( \frac{35}{1024} \), and m + n = 35 + 1024 = 1059.
