Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: To solve this problem, we need to consider the geometry of the torus $T$ and the sphere $S$. The torus is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis 6 units away from its center. This gives the torus a 'tube radius' of 3 and a 'center radius' of 6. The sphere $S$ has a radius of 11. 

1. When the torus is internally tangent to the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 11 - 3 = 8. The radius of the circle of tangency $r_i$ is the difference between the center radius of the torus and this distance: $r_i = 6 - 8 = -2$. However, since $r_i$ is a radius, we consider its absolute value, so $r_i = 2$.

2. When the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 11 + 3 = 14. The radius of the circle of tangency $r_o$ is the difference between this distance and the center radius of the torus: $r_o = 14 - 6 = 8$.

3. The difference $r_i - r_o$ is $2 - 8 = -6$. We need to express this as a fraction $\frac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime. In this case, $\frac{-6}{1}$ is already in simplest form, so $m = -6$ and $n = 1$.

4. We are asked for $m + n$, which is $-6 + 1 = -5$. However, since the problem specifies positive integers, we should consider the absolute values, giving $m = 6$ and $n = 1$, so $m + n = 6 + 1 = 7$.
