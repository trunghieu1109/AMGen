proposed answer: The hexagon ABCDEF is equilateral and has all pairs of opposite sides parallel. This means it is a symmetric hexagon with equal side lengths. The triangle formed by the extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. Since the hexagon is equilateral, the extensions of these segments form a triangle that is similar to the hexagon, and the side lengths of the triangle are in the same proportion as the side length of the hexagon. Given that the sum of the angles in the hexagon is 720 degrees and the triangle formed by the extensions has angles that are supplements of the angles of the hexagon, the triangle is similar to the hexagon with a specific scale factor. The side length of the hexagon can be determined by recognizing that the triangle's side lengths are proportional to the hexagon's side lengths. Since the triangle has side lengths 200, 240, and 300, we can find the greatest common divisor of these side lengths, which is 40. Therefore, the side length of the hexagon is the greatest common divisor of these side lengths.
