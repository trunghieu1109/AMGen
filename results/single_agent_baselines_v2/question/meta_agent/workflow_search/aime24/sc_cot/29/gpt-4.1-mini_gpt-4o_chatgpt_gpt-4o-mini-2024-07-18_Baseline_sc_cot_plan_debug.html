    <pre>There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\times5$ grid such that: 

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.

Please think step by step and then solve the task.</pre>

    <pre>We need to place chips such that all chips in the same row and column have the same color, and we cannot add more chips without violating this condition. This suggests a configuration where each row and column is filled with exactly one color, either entirely white or entirely black. Since there are 5 rows and 5 columns, we can choose any subset of the 5 rows to be filled with white chips, and the remaining rows will be black. The same choice applies to columns. Any choice of rows and columns will uniquely determine the placement of chips, as each intersection of a white row and white column will have a white chip, and each intersection of a black row and black column will have a black chip. Thus, the problem reduces to choosing subsets of the 5 rows and 5 columns independently.
