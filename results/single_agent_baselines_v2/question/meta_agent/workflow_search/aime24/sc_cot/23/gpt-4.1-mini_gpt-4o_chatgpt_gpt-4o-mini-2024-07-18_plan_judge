Question: Find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid so that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is $999$, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is $99$. The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$.
\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\ \hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\ \hline \end{array}\]

proposed answer: We have a 2x3 grid where we can place digits. Let's denote the grid as follows:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline a & b & c \\ \hline d & e & f \\ \hline \end{array}
\]
The sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is 999, so we have:
\[100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999\]
The sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99, so we have:
\[10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99\]
Now, let's simplify these equations.
1. \(100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999\)
2. \(10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99\)
Subtract equation 2 from equation 1:
\[(100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f) - (10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f) = 999 - 99\]
Simplify:
\[90a + 99d + 9e - 9c = 900\]
Divide everything by 9:
\[10a + 11d + e - c = 100\]
Now we have two equations:
1. \(100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999\)
2. \(10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99\)
3. \(10a + 11d + e - c = 100\)
Let's solve these equations systematically. From equation 3, we have:
\[c = 10a + 11d + e - 100\]
Substitute this in equation 2:
\[10a + d + 10b + e + 10(10a + 11d + e - 100) + f = 99\]
Simplify:
\[10a + d + 10b + e + 100a + 110d + 10e - 1000 + f = 99\]
\[110a + 111d + 11e + f = 1099\]
Now, let's substitute back to check the possibilities for digits. We need to find integer solutions where all variables are digits (0-9). After testing different combinations, we find that:
\[a = 0, b = 0, c = 8, d = 9, e = 9, f = 1\]
This is the solution given in the problem, and through trial and error, we find that these are the only values that satisfy all the conditions. Therefore, the number of ways is 1.
