Question: Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 10Xf', content='We begin by recognizing that $D$ is the intersection of the tangents to the circle at $B$ and $C$. This means $D$ is the exsimilicenter of the circumcircle and the nine-point circle of triangle $ABC$. By the Power of a Point theorem, $AD \\cdot AP = AB^2 = 25$. We also know that $D$ is the Miquel point of the quadrilateral $ABPC$, meaning $AD$ is the symmedian of triangle $ABC$. Using the symmedian property, $\\frac{AP}{PD} = \\frac{c^2}{b^2} = \\frac{10^2}{9^2} = \\frac{100}{81}$. Let $AP = x$ and $PD = y$, then $\\frac{x}{y} = \\frac{100}{81}$ and $x + y = AD$. From the Power of a Point, $AD \\cdot x = 25$, so $x = \\frac{25}{AD}$. Substituting $x = \\frac{100}{181} AD$, we get $AD = \\frac{100}{181} AD + y$. Solving these equations gives $x = \\frac{2500}{181}$. Thus, $AP = \\frac{2500}{181}$, and $m+n = 2500 + 181 = 2681$.\n\nAnswer:2681', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
