Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent Hv4k', content='We are given a triangle \\( \\triangle ABC \\) with circumcenter \\( O \\) and incenter \\( I \\), and the condition that \\( \\overline{IA} \\perp \\overline{OI} \\). The circumradius \\( R \\) is 13, and the inradius \\( r \\) is 6. We need to find \\( AB \\cdot AC \\).\n\nThe condition \\( \\overline{IA} \\perp \\overline{OI} \\) suggests that \\( A \\) is one of the excenters of the triangle, specifically the excenter opposite the vertex \\( A \\). This implies that the triangle is right-angled at \\( A \\). In a right triangle, the circumradius \\( R \\) is half the hypotenuse, and the inradius \\( r \\) is given by \\( r = \\frac{a + b - c}{2} \\), where \\( c \\) is the hypotenuse.\n\nSince \\( R = 13 \\), the hypotenuse \\( c = 2R = 26 \\). The area \\( K \\) of the triangle can be expressed in terms of the inradius and semiperimeter \\( s \\) as \\( K = rs = 6s \\).\n\nThe semiperimeter \\( s \\) is \\( \\frac{a + b + c}{2} = \\frac{a + b + 26}{2} \\). The area \\( K \\) can also be expressed as \\( \\frac{1}{2}ab \\) since \\( \\triangle ABC \\) is right-angled at \\( A \\). Thus, \\( \\frac{1}{2}ab = 6s \\).\n\nUsing the identity \\( r = \\frac{a + b - c}{2} \\), we have \\( 6 = \\frac{a + b - 26}{2} \\), leading to \\( a + b = 38 \\).\n\nNow, \\( s = \\frac{38 + 26}{2} = 32 \\), so \\( ab = 12 \\cdot 32 = 384 \\).\n\nThus, \\( AB \\cdot AC = ab = 384 \\).\n\nAnswer:384', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
