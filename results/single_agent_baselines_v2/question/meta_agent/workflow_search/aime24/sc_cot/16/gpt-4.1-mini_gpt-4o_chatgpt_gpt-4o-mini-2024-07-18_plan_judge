proposed answer: We are given a triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with circumcenter \( O \) and incenter \( I \), and the condition that \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \). The circumradius \( R \) is 13, and the inradius \( r \) is 6. We need to find \( AB \cdot AC \).

The condition \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \) suggests that \( A \) is one of the excenters of the triangle, specifically the excenter opposite the vertex \( A \). This implies that the triangle is right-angled at \( A \). In a right triangle, the circumradius \( R \) is half the hypotenuse, and the inradius \( r \) is given by \( r = \frac{a + b - c}{2} \), where \( c \) is the hypotenuse.

Since \( R = 13 \), the hypotenuse \( c = 2R = 26 \). The area \( K \) of the triangle can be expressed in terms of the inradius and semiperimeter \( s \) as \( K = rs = 6s \).

The semiperimeter \( s \) is \( \frac{a + b + c}{2} = \frac{a + b + 26}{2} \). The area \( K \) can also be expressed as \( \frac{1}{2}ab \) since \( \triangle ABC \) is right-angled at \( A \). Thus, \( \frac{1}{2}ab = 6s \).

Using the identity \( r = \frac{a + b - c}{2} \), we have \( 6 = \frac{a + b - 26}{2} \), leading to \( a + b = 38 \).

Now, \( s = \frac{38 + 26}{2} = 32 \), so \( ab = 12 \cdot 32 = 384 \).

Thus, \( AB \cdot AC = ab = 384 \).
