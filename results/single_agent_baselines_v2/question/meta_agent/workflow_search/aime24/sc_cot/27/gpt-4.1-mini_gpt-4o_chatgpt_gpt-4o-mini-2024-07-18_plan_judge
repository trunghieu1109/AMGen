Question: Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To find the greatest four-digit integer N such that changing any one of its digits to 1 results in a number divisible by 7, we need to consider the divisibility by 7 for each possible digit change. We start with the largest four-digit number, 9999, and check if changing each digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. If not, we decrement N and check again, until we find the largest N that satisfies the condition. Once we find N, we can compute Q and R from N = 1000Q + R, where Q is the quotient and R is the remainder when N is divided by 1000. Finally, we compute Q + R.
