    <pre>To solve this problem, we need to analyze the functions involved and find where the graphs intersect. The functions f(x) and g(x) are defined in terms of absolute values. The function f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| is a V-shaped function centered at x = 0.5. The function g(x) = ||x| - 1/4| is similar but centered at x = 0.25. The function y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) involves the sine function which oscillates between -1 and 1, and the function x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) involves the cosine function which also oscillates between -1 and 1. We need to find the points (x, y) where these two functions are equal, which means finding x and y such that 4g(f(sin(2πx))) = x and 4g(f(cos(3πy))) = y. Since both sine and cosine oscillate between -1 and 1, we need to analyze the values of g(f(x)) for x in [-1, 1]. For x in [-1, 1], |x| is in [0, 1]. For |x| in [0, 1], f(x) = | |x| - 1/2 | takes values from 0 to 0.5. Then g(f(x)) = || |x| - 1/2 | - 1/4 | takes values from 0 to 0.25. Multiplying by 4, the range of 4g(f(x)) is [0, 1]. Therefore, the graphs intersect when x = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) = y, which means x = y. We need to count the number of such points. Since both sine and cosine cover the same range in their respective domains, the intersections occur at x = y for x in [0, 1]. The sine function sin(2πx) covers [0, 1] twice as x goes from 0 to 1, and the cosine function cos(3πy) covers [0, 1] three times as y goes from 0 to 1. Thus, we consider the intersections over one period of each function and count the number of solutions where x = y. The functions g(f(sin(2πx))) and g(f(cos(3πy))) are piecewise linear, and we need to find the number of x = y intersections in one period. Since both functions have a similar structure and range, and since x = y is a line through the origin, the number of intersections is determined by the number of times the piecewise linear segments cross the line x = y. Each piecewise linear segment will intersect the line x = y at most once, and given the symmetry and periodicity, the number of intersections is equal to the least common multiple of the number of periods of sine and cosine over [0, 1].
