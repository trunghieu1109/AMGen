    <pre>Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.

Please think step by step and then solve the task.</pre>

    <pre>We start by finding Aya&#39;s walking speed, s. We know that when she walks at speed s, the total time for her walk and coffee shop is 4 hours, and when she walks at speed s+2, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes. First, we convert all times to hours: 4 hours is 4 hours, and 2 hours and 24 minutes is 2 + 24/60 = 2.4 hours. Let&#39;s express the walking time in terms of s. The time to walk 9 km at speed s is 9/s hours. The time to walk 9 km at speed s+2 is 9/(s+2) hours. The total time at speed s is 9/s + t/60 = 4, and the total time at speed s+2 is 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4. We solve these two equations to find s and t. From the first equation, 9/s = 4 - t/60. From the second equation, 9/(s+2) = 2.4 - t/60. Subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate t: 9/s - 9/(s+2) = 4 - 2.4. Simplifying, we find 9/s - 9/(s+2) = 1.6. Solving this gives s = 3 km/h. Now, substituting s = 3 into 9/s = 4 - t/60, we find t = 60 minutes. Now, we need to find the time when Aya walks at s + 1/2 km/h. Her walking time is 9/(s + 1/2) = 9/(3 + 1/2) = 9/3.5 hours. Converting to minutes, 9/3.5 hours is (9/3.5) * 60 = 154.2857 minutes. Adding the 60 minutes spent in the coffee shop, the total time is 154.2857 + 60 = 214.2857 minutes. Rounding to the nearest whole number, the total time is 214 minutes.
