Question: Rectangles $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are drawn such that $D,E,C,F$ are collinear. Also, $A,D,H,G$ all lie on a circle. If $BC=16$,$AB=107$,$FG=17$, and $EF=184$, what is the length of $CE$?\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent y0RV', content='We need to find the length of segment CE where D, E, C, and F are collinear. Rectangles ABCD and EFGH are given, and some of their side lengths are provided. Since D, E, C, and F are collinear, and rectangles have opposite sides equal, we can use these properties to find the length of CE.\n\nFirst, note that in rectangle ABCD, opposite sides are equal, so AD = BC = 16 and AB = CD = 107.\n\nIn rectangle EFGH, opposite sides are equal, so EF = GH = 184 and FG = EH = 17.\n\nPoints D, E, C, and F being collinear implies that DE + EC + CF = DF.\n\nSince D, E, C, and F are collinear, and we know the lengths of BC and FG, we can find the length of CE by using the fact that the total length DF is equal to the sum of DE, EC, and CF.\n\nSince BC is parallel to FG and the rectangles are positioned such that D, E, C, and F are collinear, we can use the fact that DE = AB = 107 and CF = FG = 17.\n\nThus, the length of CE is given by the difference between CD + FG and AB:\nCE = CD + FG - AB.\n\nSince CD = 107 and FG = 17, we have:\nCE = 107 + 17 - 107 = 17.\n\nAnswer:17', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
