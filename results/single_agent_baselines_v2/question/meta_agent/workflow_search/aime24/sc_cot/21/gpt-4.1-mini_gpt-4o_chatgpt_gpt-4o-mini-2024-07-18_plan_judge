Question: Find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon ($12$-gon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The diagram below shows three of those rectangles.

proposed answer: To find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon, we first note that a rectangle is determined by two pairs of parallel sides. In a regular dodecagon, we have vertices labeled as $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_{12}$. A rectangle can be formed by choosing two pairs of opposite sides. We need to find how many such pairs of opposite sides can be chosen.

Each side of the dodecagon can be connected to its opposite side by choosing vertices that are 6 steps apart, i.e., $A_i$ is opposite to $A_{i+6}$ (considering indices modulo 12). For a rectangle, we choose two such pairs of opposite sides.

We first choose the first pair of opposite sides. There are 6 such pairs possible: $(A_1, A_7), (A_2, A_8), (A_3, A_9), (A_4, A_{10}), (A_5, A_{11}), (A_6, A_{12})$.

Once the first pair is chosen, the second pair must also be a pair of opposite sides. There are 5 remaining pairs to choose from.

Thus, the number of ways to choose two pairs of opposite sides is $\binom{6}{2}$, which accounts for choosing 2 pairs out of 6. This is given by:
\[ \binom{6}{2} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = 15. \]

Therefore, the total number of rectangles that can be formed is 15.
