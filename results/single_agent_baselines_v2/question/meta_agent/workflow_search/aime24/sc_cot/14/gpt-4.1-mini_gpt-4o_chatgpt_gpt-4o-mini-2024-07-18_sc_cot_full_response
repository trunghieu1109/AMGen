Question: Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 3LBq', content='To solve this problem, we start by considering the properties of a rhombus and the given hyperbola. A rhombus has equal sides, and its diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, we can consider the diagonals as the x-axis and y-axis, with the vertices of the rhombus on the hyperbola. The equation of the hyperbola is \\( \\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \\), which has its center at the origin. The diagonals of the rhombus are along the axes, so we can write the vertices as \\((a, 0), (-a, 0), (0, b), (0, -b)\\). These points must satisfy the hyperbola equation. For point \\((a, 0)\\), we have \\(\\frac{a^2}{20} = 1\\), giving \\(a^2 = 20\\). For point \\((0, b)\\), we have \\(-\\frac{b^2}{24} = 1\\), giving \\(b^2 = 24\\). The diagonals of the rhombus are of lengths \\(2a\\) and \\(2b\\), so the square of the diagonal \\(BD\\) is \\((2b)^2 = 4b^2\\). Substituting \\(b^2 = 24\\), we get \\(BD^2 = 4 \\times 24 = 96\\). However, we need the greatest real number less than \\(BD^2\\). Since \\(BD^2\\) is exactly 96, the greatest real number less than 96 is 95.\n\nAnswer:95', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
