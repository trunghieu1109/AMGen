    <pre>To solve this problem, we start by considering the properties of a rhombus and the given hyperbola. A rhombus has equal sides, and its diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, we can consider the diagonals as the x-axis and y-axis, with the vertices of the rhombus on the hyperbola. The equation of the hyperbola is \( \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \), which has its center at the origin. The diagonals of the rhombus are along the axes, so we can write the vertices as \((a, 0), (-a, 0), (0, b), (0, -b)\). These points must satisfy the hyperbola equation. For point \((a, 0)\), we have \(\frac{a^2}{20} = 1\), giving \(a^2 = 20\). For point \((0, b)\), we have \(-\frac{b^2}{24} = 1\), giving \(b^2 = 24\). The diagonals of the rhombus are of lengths \(2a\) and \(2b\), so the square of the diagonal \(BD\) is \((2b)^2 = 4b^2\). Substituting \(b^2 = 24\), we get \(BD^2 = 4 \times 24 = 96\). However, we need the greatest real number less than \(BD^2\). Since \(BD^2\) is exactly 96, the greatest real number less than 96 is 95.
