Question: Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.

proposed answer: We are given a tetrahedron $ABCD$ with specified edge lengths and need to find the distance from the incenter $I$ to each face. The distances to the faces are equal, so $I$ is the incenter. The inradius $r$ is given by $r = \frac{3V}{S}$, where $V$ is the volume of the tetrahedron and $S$ is the total surface area. First, we calculate the volume $V$ using the Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron. The determinant is set up with the squared edge lengths. After computing the determinant, we find $V = 24$. Next, we calculate the area of each face using Heron's formula. The areas are $S_1 = 9$, $S_2 = 36$, $S_3 = 36$, and $S_4 = 36$. The total surface area $S = 117$. Finally, the inradius $r = \frac{3 \times 24}{117} = \frac{72}{117} = \frac{24}{39} = \frac{8}{13}$. Therefore, the distance is $\frac{8}{13}$, and $m = 8$, $n = 1$, $p = 13$. Thus, $m+n+p = 8+1+13 = 22$.
