    <pre>We need to find the number of residents who own all four items: a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, a garden spade, and a bag of candy hearts. We know the total number of residents is 900, and each owns a bag of candy hearts. Therefore, we need to find the intersection of the three other items. We have 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. We also know 437 own exactly two of these three items, and 234 own all three. Let&#39;s denote the number of residents who own all three items as x. By the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we have that the number of residents who own at least one of the three items is: |D ∪ G ∪ S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D ∩ G| - |D ∩ S| - |G ∩ S| + |D ∩ G ∩ S|. We know |D| = 195, |G| = 367, |S| = 562, and the number of residents owning exactly two items is 437, so |D ∩ G| + |D ∩ S| + |G ∩ S| = 437 + 3*234, because the overlap of three items is counted three times in the two-item counts. Solving the inclusion-exclusion formula will give us the number of residents who own at least one of the three items, and subtracting from 900 gives us those who own all four items. Let&#39;s solve for x: |D ∪ G ∪ S| = 195 + 367 + 562 - 437 - 234 = 453. Therefore, the number of residents who own all four items is 900 - 453 = 447.
