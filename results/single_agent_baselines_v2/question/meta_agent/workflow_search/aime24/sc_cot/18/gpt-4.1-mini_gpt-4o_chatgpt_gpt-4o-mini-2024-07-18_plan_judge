Question: Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). Then \(OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\).

proposed answer: To solve the problem, we first need to determine the equation of line AB. The coordinates of A are (1/2, 0) and B are (0, sqrt(3)/2). The slope of line AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0) / (0 - 1/2) = -sqrt(3). The equation of line AB in point-slope form using point A is y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2). Simplifying, we get y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

Next, consider a segment PQ of unit length with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. Let P = (a, 0) and Q = (0, b). The length of PQ is given by sqrt(a^2 + b^2) = 1, so a^2 + b^2 = 1.

A point C on line AB has coordinates (x, -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2). We need to find x such that C does not belong to any segment PQ other than AB. For C to lie on a segment PQ, there must exist a point P = (a, 0) and Q = (0, b) such that (x, -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2) is a linear combination of P and Q with coefficients summing to 1.

This means there exist t, 1-t such that (x, -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2) = (ta, 0) + ((1-t)(0, b)). This gives the system of equations: x = ta and -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 = (1-t)b.

Substituting x = ta into the second equation gives -sqrt(3)ta + sqrt(3)/2 = (1-t)b. Also, we have a^2 + b^2 = 1.

For C to not lie on any segment PQ other than AB, the system must be inconsistent for all a, b such that a^2 + b^2 = 1. This occurs when the point C is the orthogonal projection of the origin onto line AB.

The orthogonal projection of the origin onto line AB is found by minimizing the distance squared from the origin to a point (x, -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2) on line AB. The distance squared is x^2 + (-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2)^2. Differentiating and setting to zero gives the x-coordinate of the projection as x = 1/4, which gives the point C as (1/4, sqrt(3)/4).

Finally, OC^2 = (1/4)^2 + (sqrt(3)/4)^2 = 1/16 + 3/16 = 4/16 = 1/4.

Thus, p/q = 1/4, where p = 1 and q = 4, and p + q = 5.
