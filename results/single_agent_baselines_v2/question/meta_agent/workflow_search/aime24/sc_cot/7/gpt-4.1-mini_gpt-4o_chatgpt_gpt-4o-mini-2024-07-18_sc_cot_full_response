Question: There exist real numbers $x$ and $y$, both greater than 1, such that $\log_x\left(y^x\right)=\log_y\left(x^{4y}\right)=10$. Find $xy$.\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent cAiF', content='We are given two equations involving logarithms and asked to find the product xy. The first equation is \\( \\log_x(y^x) = 10 \\). This can be rewritten using the properties of logarithms as \\( x^{10} = y^x \\). The second equation is \\( \\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 \\), which can be rewritten as \\( y^{10} = x^{4y} \\). We now have the system of equations: \\( y = x^{10/x} \\) and \\( x = y^{10/(4y)} \\). Substituting \\( y = x^{10/x} \\) into the second equation gives \\( x = (x^{10/x})^{10/(4x^{10/x})} \\). Solving these equations simultaneously, we find that \\( x = 100 \\) and \\( y = 10 \\), so \\( xy = 1000 \\).\n\nAnswer:1000', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
