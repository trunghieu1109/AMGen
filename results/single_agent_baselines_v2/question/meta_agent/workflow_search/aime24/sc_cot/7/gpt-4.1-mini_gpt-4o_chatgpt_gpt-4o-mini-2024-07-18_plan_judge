Question: There exist real numbers $x$ and $y$, both greater than 1, such that $\log_x\left(y^x\right)=\log_y\left(x^{4y}\right)=10$. Find $xy$.

proposed answer: We are given two equations involving logarithms and asked to find the product xy. The first equation is \( \log_x(y^x) = 10 \). This can be rewritten using the properties of logarithms as \( x^{10} = y^x \). The second equation is \( \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 \), which can be rewritten as \( y^{10} = x^{4y} \). We now have the system of equations: \( y = x^{10/x} \) and \( x = y^{10/(4y)} \). Substituting \( y = x^{10/x} \) into the second equation gives \( x = (x^{10/x})^{10/(4x^{10/x})} \). Solving these equations simultaneously, we find that \( x = 100 \) and \( y = 10 \), so \( xy = 1000 \).
