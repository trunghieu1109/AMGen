Question: Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent lNcX', content="To find the least integer b for which there are more than ten b-beautiful integers, let's analyze the properties of b-beautiful integers. A b-beautiful integer n has exactly two digits in base b, which can be expressed as n = ab + c, where 0 <= a < b, 0 <= c < b, and a + c = sqrt(n). Since n is a two-digit number in base b, we have b <= n < b^2. Also, since a + c = sqrt(n), n must be a perfect square. Therefore, we need to find perfect squares n such that b <= n < b^2 and the digits of n in base b sum to sqrt(n). We need to find the smallest b such that there are more than ten such integers n. We will check each b starting from 2 and count the number of b-beautiful integers until we find more than ten.\n\nAnswer:16", prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
