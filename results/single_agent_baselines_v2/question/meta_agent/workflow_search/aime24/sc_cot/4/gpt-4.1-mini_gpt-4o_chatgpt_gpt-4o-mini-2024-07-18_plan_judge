proposed answer: We are looking for the smallest prime number p such that there exists an integer n with n^4 + 1 divisible by p^2. First, we check small primes. For p = 2, n^4 + 1 is never divisible by 4 since n^4 is always even, making n^4 + 1 odd. For p = 3, n^4 + 1 = 0 (mod 9) has no solutions because n^4 mod 9 can be 0, 1, 4, 7, and none give n^4 + 1 = 0 mod 9. For p = 5, n^4 + 1 = 0 (mod 25) has solutions. n^4 = -1 (mod 25). Testing small n, n = 3 gives 81 + 1 = 82, which is not divisible by 25. n = 4 gives 256 + 1 = 257, not divisible by 25. n = 5 gives 625 + 1 = 626, divisible by 25. So, p = 5 is the smallest such prime, and the smallest m is 5.
