Question: Let $p$ be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $n^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$. Find the least positive integer $m$ such that $m^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$.\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 50V7', content='We are looking for the smallest prime number p such that there exists an integer n with n^4 + 1 divisible by p^2. First, we check small primes. For p = 2, n^4 + 1 is never divisible by 4 since n^4 is always even, making n^4 + 1 odd. For p = 3, n^4 + 1 = 0 (mod 9) has no solutions because n^4 mod 9 can be 0, 1, 4, 7, and none give n^4 + 1 = 0 mod 9. For p = 5, n^4 + 1 = 0 (mod 25) has solutions. n^4 = -1 (mod 25). Testing small n, n = 3 gives 81 + 1 = 82, which is not divisible by 25. n = 4 gives 256 + 1 = 257, not divisible by 25. n = 5 gives 625 + 1 = 626, divisible by 25. So, p = 5 is the smallest such prime, and the smallest m is 5.\n\nAnswer:5', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
