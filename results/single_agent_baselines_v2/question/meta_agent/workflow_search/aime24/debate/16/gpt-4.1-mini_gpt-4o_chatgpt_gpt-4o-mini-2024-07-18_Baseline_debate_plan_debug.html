    <pre>Let $\triangle ABC$ have circumcenter $O$ and incenter $I$ with $\overline{IA}\perp\overline{OI}$, circumradius $13$, and inradius $6$. Find $AB\cdot AC$.

### thinking by Debate Agent sCFZ:
We are given that the inradius r is 6, the circumradius R is 13, and IA is perpendicular to OI. In a triangle, the relationship between the inradius (r), circumradius (R), and the distance between the incenter (I) and the circumcenter (O) is given by Euler&#39;s relation: OI^2 = R^2 - 2Rr. Substituting the given values, we find OI^2 = 13^2 - 2 * 13 * 6 = 169 - 156 = 13, so OI = sqrt(13). The condition IA \perp OI implies AI^2 + OI^2 = AO^2. The length AI can be found using the formula AI^2 = r^2 + (s - a)^2, where s is the semiperimeter and a is the side opposite to vertex A. Since AO = R = 13, we have AI^2 + 13 = 13^2. Thus, AI^2 = 156. This means AI^2 = r^2 + (s - a)^2 = 36 + (s - a)^2 = 156, so (s - a)^2 = 120, giving s - a = sqrt(120) = 2sqrt(30). We need to find AB \cdot AC, which is given by the formula: AB \cdot AC = c^2 - (s - a)^2, where c is the side BC. Since we do not have c directly, we need to use other relations. From the semiperimeter s = (a + b + c)/2, and s - a = 2sqrt(30), it follows that a = s - 2sqrt(30). However, without loss of generality, we consider the relation: AB \cdot AC = c^2 - (s - a)^2 = (a + b + c)(c - a) = (2s - a)(c - a). Since s = a + b + c/2, we have 2s - a = b + c. Therefore, AB \cdot AC = (b + c)(c - a). We also know that AI^2 = r^2 + (s - a)^2, which is consistent with our earlier calculation. To find AB \cdot AC, we use the identity: AB \cdot AC = 4Rr \cdot sin(A), where sin(A) = 1 because IA \perp OI, thus angle A is 90 degrees. Therefore, AB \cdot AC = 4 * 13 * 6 = 312.

### thinking by Debate Agent nt9z:
Given that \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), this implies that \( A \) is the excenter opposite \( I \). We know the circumradius \( R = 13 \) and the inradius \( r = 6 \). We need to find \( AB \cdot AC \). We start by using the formula \( R^2 = OI^2 + r^2 \). Using this, we can calculate \( OI^2 = R^2 - r^2 = 13^2 - 6^2 = 169 - 36 = 133 \). Also, using the relation \( OI^2 = R^2 - 2Rr \cos A \), we can find \( \cos A \). However, since \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), \( \cos A = 0 \), and thus \( A \) is a right angle. In a right triangle, the product of the legs \( AB \cdot AC \) is equal to \( c^2 \), where \( c \) is the hypotenuse, which is also the diameter of the circumcircle. Since the circumradius is 13, the diameter is \( 2 \times 13 = 26 \). Therefore, \( AB \cdot AC = c^2 = 26^2 = 676 \).

The condition IA \perp OI implies that angle A is a right angle, making triangle ABC a right triangle with A as the right angle. In a right triangle, the product of the legs AB and AC is equal to the square of the hypotenuse BC. The hypotenuse BC is the diameter of the circumcircle, which is 2R = 26.
