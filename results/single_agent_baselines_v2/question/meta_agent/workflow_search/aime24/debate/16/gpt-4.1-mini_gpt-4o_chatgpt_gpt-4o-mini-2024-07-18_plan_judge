Question: Let $\triangle ABC$ have circumcenter $O$ and incenter $I$ with $\overline{IA}\perp\overline{OI}$, circumradius $13$, and inradius $6$. Find $AB\cdot AC$.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: We are given that the circumradius R is 13, the inradius r is 6, and IA is perpendicular to OI. The condition IA \perp OI implies that angle A is a right angle, making triangle ABC a right triangle with A as the right angle. In a right triangle, the product of the legs AB and AC is equal to the square of the hypotenuse BC. The hypotenuse BC is the diameter of the circumcircle, which is 2R = 26. Therefore, AB \cdot AC = BC^2 = 26^2 = 676.

Answer:676
