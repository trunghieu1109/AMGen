Find $AB\\cdot AC$.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent sCFZ:\nWe are given that the inradius r is 6, the circumradius R is 13, and IA is perpendicular to OI. In a triangle, the relationship between the inradius (r), circumradius (R), and the distance between the incenter (I) and the circumcenter (O) is given by Euler's relation: OI^2 = R^2 - 2Rr. Substituting the given values, we find OI^2 = 13^2 - 2 * 13 * 6 = 169 - 156 = 13, so OI = sqrt(13). The condition IA \\perp OI implies AI^2 + OI^2 = AO^2. The length AI can be found using the formula AI^2 = r^2 + (s - a)^2, where s is the semiperimeter and a is the side opposite to vertex A. Since AO = R = 13, we have AI^2 + 13 = 13^2. Thus, AI^2 = 156. This means AI^2 = r^2 + (s - a)^2 = 36 + (s - a)^2 = 156, so (s - a)^2 = 120, giving s - a = sqrt(120) = 2sqrt(30). We need to find AB \\cdot AC, which is given by the formula: AB \\cdot AC = c^2 - (s - a)^2, where c is the side BC. Since we do not have c directly, we need to use other relations. From the semiperimeter s = (a + b + c)/2, and s - a = 2sqrt(30), it follows that a = s - 2sqrt(30). However, without loss of generality, we consider the relation: AB \\cdot AC = c^2 - (s - a)^2 = (a + b + c)(c - a) = (2s - a)(c - a). Since s = a + b + c/2, we have 2s - a = b + c. Therefore, AB \\cdot AC = (b + c)(c - a). We also know that AI^2 = r^2 + (s - a)^2, which is consistent with our earlier calculation. To find AB \\cdot AC, we use the identity: AB \\cdot AC = 4Rr \\cdot sin(A), where sin(A) = 1 because IA \\perp OI, thus angle A is 90 degrees. Therefore, AB \\cdot AC = 4 * 13 * 6 = 312.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent nt9z:\nGiven that \\( \\overline{IA} \\perp \\overline{OI} \\), this implies that \\( A \\) is the excenter opposite \\( I \\). We know the circumradius \\( R = 13 \\) and the inradius \\( r = 6 \\). We need to find \\( AB \\cdot AC \\). We start by using the formula \\( R^2 = OI^2 + r^2 \\). Using this, we can calculate \\( OI^2 = R^2 - r^2 = 13^2 - 6^2 = 169 - 36 = 133 \\). Also, using the relation \\( OI^2 = R^2 - 2Rr \\cos A \\), we can find \\( \\cos A \\).

Since the circumradius is 13, the diameter is \\( 2 \\times 13 = 26 \\).
