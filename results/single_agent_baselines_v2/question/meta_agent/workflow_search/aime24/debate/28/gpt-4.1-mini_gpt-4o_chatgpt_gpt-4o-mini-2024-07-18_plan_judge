Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: To solve the problem, we need to consider the geometry of the torus and the sphere. The torus is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis that is 6 units away from the center of the circle. This means the torus has a major radius of 6 and a minor radius of 3. The sphere has a radius of 11. When the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, it can be in two configurations: resting on the inside or the outside of the sphere. In the inside configuration, the center of the torus is closer to the center of the sphere, while in the outside configuration, the center of the torus is further away. For the inside configuration, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 11 - 3 = 8. For the outside configuration, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 11 + 3 = 14. The radius of the tangent circle when the torus is inside (r_i) is the difference in distances from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus and the major radius of the torus: r_i = 8 - 6 = 2. The radius of the tangent circle when the torus is outside (r_o) is: r_o = 14 - 6 = 8. The difference r_i - r_o is 2 - 8 = -6. Since the problem asks for the difference in the form of a fraction m/n, where m and n are relatively prime positive integers, we consider the absolute value: |-6| = 6 = 6/1. Thus, m = 6 and n = 1, making m + n = 7.
