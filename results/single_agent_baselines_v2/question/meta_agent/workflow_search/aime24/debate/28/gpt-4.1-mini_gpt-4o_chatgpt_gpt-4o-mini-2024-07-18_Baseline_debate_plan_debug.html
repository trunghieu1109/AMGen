    <pre>Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

### thinking by Debate Agent StW8:
To solve this problem, we need to consider the geometry of the torus and the sphere. The torus is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis that is 6 units away from the center of the circle. This means the torus has a major radius (distance from the center of the torus to the center of the generating circle) of 6 and a minor radius (radius of the generating circle) of 3. The sphere has a radius of 11.

When the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, it can be in two configurations: resting on the inside or the outside of the sphere. In the inside configuration, the center of the torus is closer to the center of the sphere, while in the outside configuration, the center of the torus is further away.

For the inside configuration, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 11 - 3 = 8 (since the torus is internally tangent along the minor radius of the torus).
For the outside configuration, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 11 + 3 = 14 (since the torus is externally tangent along the minor radius of the torus).

The radius of the tangent circle when the torus is inside (r_i) is the difference in distances from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus and the major radius of the torus: r_i = 8 - 6 = 2.
The radius of the tangent circle when the torus is outside (r_o) is: r_o = 14 - 6 = 8.

The difference r_i - r_o is 2 - 8 = -6. Since the problem asks for the difference in the form of a fraction m/n, where m and n are relatively prime positive integers, we consider the absolute value: |-6| = 6 = 6/1.

Thus, m = 6 and n = 1, making m + n = 7.

To solve this problem, we need to understand the geometry of the torus and sphere when they are tangent to each other. The torus is defined by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis 6 units away, giving it a major radius (distance from the center of the torus to the center of the tube) of 6 and a minor radius (radius of the tube) of 3. The sphere has a radius of 11. When the torus is tangent to the sphere externally, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the tube of the torus is 11 + 3 = 14. When internally tangent, the distance is 11 - 3 = 8. The difference in these distances gives the difference in radii of the circles of tangency.
