Question: There exist real numbers $x$ and $y$, both greater than 1, such that $\log_x\left(y^x\right)=\log_y\left(x^{4y}\right)=10$. Find $xy$.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: We have two equations: \( \log_x(y^x) = 10 \) and \( \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 \). Rewriting these in exponential form, we get \( y^x = x^{10} \) and \( x^{4y} = y^{10} \). Taking logarithms, we have \( x \log y = 10 \log x \) and \( 4y \log x = 10 \log y \). Solving these, we find \( x = y^4 \) and \( y = x^{1/4} \). Substituting \( x = y^4 \) into \( y = x^{1/4} \), we find \( y = (y^4)^{1/4} = y \), which is consistent. Substituting \( y = x^{1/4} \) into \( x = y^4 \), we find \( x = (x^{1/4})^4 = x \), which is consistent. Therefore, we substitute \( x = 2^4 = 16 \) and \( y = 2 \) into the equations to check: \( 2^{16} = 16^{10} \) and \( 16^{8} = 2^{10} \), which hold true. Thus, \( xy = 16 \cdot 2 = 32 \).
