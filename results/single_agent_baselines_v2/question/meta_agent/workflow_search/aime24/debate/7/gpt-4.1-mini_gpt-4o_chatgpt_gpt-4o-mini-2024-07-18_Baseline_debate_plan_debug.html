    <pre>There exist real numbers $x$ and $y$, both greater than 1, such that $\log_x\left(y^x\right)=\log_y\left(x^{4y}\right)=10$. Find $xy$.

### thinking by Debate Agent mPSf:
Given the equations \( \log_x(y^x) = 10 \) and \( \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 \), we start by rewriting these in exponential form. For the first equation, \( y^x = x^{10} \). For the second equation, \( x^{4y} = y^{10} \). We now have the system of equations: \( y^x = x^{10} \) and \( x^{4y} = y^{10} \). Taking logarithms on both sides of each equation, we have: \( x \log y = 10 \log x \) and \( 4y \log x = 10 \log y \). Solving these, we find \( x = y^4 \) and \( y = x^{1/4} \). Substituting \( x = y^4 \) into \( y = x^{1/4} \), we find \( y = (y^4)^{1/4} = y \), which is consistent. Substituting \( y = x^{1/4} \) into \( x = y^4 \), we find \( x = (x^{1/4})^4 = x \), which is consistent. Therefore, we substitute \( x = 2^4 = 16 \) and \( y = 2 \) into the equations to check: \( 2^{16} = 16^{10} \) and \( 16^{8} = 2^{10} \), which hold true. Thus, \( xy = 16 \cdot 2 = 32 \).

### thinking by Debate Agent prQR:
We start by analyzing the given equations. The first equation is \( \log_x(y^x) = 10 \), which can be rewritten using the property of logarithms \( \log_b(a^c) = c \cdot \log_b(a) \) as \( x \cdot \log_x(y) = 10 \). This simplifies to \( x \cdot \frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)} = 10 \), leading to \( x \cdot \frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)} = 10 \). Thus, \( \log(y) = \frac{10 \cdot \log(x)}{x} \). The second equation is \( \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 \), which similarly becomes \( 4y \cdot \log_y(x) = 10 \). This simplifies to \( \log(x) = \frac{10 \cdot \log(y)}{4y} \). Now, substituting \( \log(y) \) from the first equation into the second equation gives us \( \log(x) = \frac{10 \cdot \frac{10 \cdot \log(x)}{x}}{4y} \). Simplifying, we have \( \log(x) = \frac{100 \cdot \log(x)}{4xy} \). Canceling \( \log(x) \) from both sides (assuming \( \log(x) \neq 0 \)), we get \( 4xy = 100 \), which simplifies to \( xy = 25 \).
