    <pre>Let ABCDEF be a convex equilateral hexagon in which all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle whose sides are extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. Find the side length of the hexagon.

### thinking by Debate Agent Tc3X:
We are given an equilateral hexagon ABCDEF where opposite sides are parallel, and we know the side lengths of the triangle formed by the extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF. Let&#39;s denote the side length of the hexagon as s. Since ABCDEF is equilateral, all sides are equal, and opposite sides are parallel, it can be divided into three parallelograms. The triangle formed by the extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. By the properties of the hexagon and the triangle, the side lengths of the triangle are proportional to the differences in the lengths of the hexagon&#39;s sides that are extended. These differences correspond to the hexagon&#39;s side length s. By the triangle inequality, the sum of any two sides of the triangle must be greater than the third, which is satisfied by 200 + 240 &gt; 300, 240 + 300 &gt; 200, and 300 + 200 &gt; 240. The side length of the hexagon can be found using the relationship between the triangle&#39;s sides and the hexagon&#39;s side length. The perimeter of the hexagon&#39;s extensions is twice the perimeter of the triangle, so 200 + 240 + 300 = 2 * 3s. Solving this gives s = 120.

### thinking by Debate Agent LAaF:
The problem describes a special type of hexagon known as a &#39;parallelohexagon&#39;, where opposite sides are parallel and equal in length. The key insight is that the hexagon can be decomposed into three rhombuses, each sharing a side with the hexagon. The triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF is known as the &#39;triangle of medians&#39; of the hexagon. This triangle&#39;s sides are proportional to the lengths of the diagonals of the hexagon. The given triangle has sides 200, 240, and 300, which can be scaled to the actual diagonal lengths of the hexagon. The semiperimeter of this triangle is (200 + 240 + 300) / 2 = 370. Using Heron&#39;s formula, the area of the triangle is the square root of [370 * (370 - 200) * (370 - 240) * (370 - 300)], which simplifies to 24000. The area of the triangle is also related to the product of its sides divided by 4 times the circumradius (R). Solving for R gives us R = (200 * 240 * 300) / (4 * 24000) = 150. The side length of the hexagon is proportional to the circumradius of this triangle. Since the triangle is the median triangle of the hexagon, the side length of the hexagon is twice the circumradius of the triangle of medians. Therefore, the side length of the hexagon is 2 * 150.

    <pre>The problem involves a special type of hexagon where opposite sides are parallel and equal, known as a &#39;parallelohexagon&#39;. The triangle formed by the extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF is related to the hexagon&#39;s geometry. The side lengths of this triangle are 200, 240, and 300. The key insight is that the side length of the hexagon is related to the circumradius of this triangle. The circumradius R of the triangle can be found using the formula R = (abc) / (4 * Area), where a, b, and c are the side lengths of the triangle. The area of the triangle can be calculated using Heron&#39;s formula. The semiperimeter is 370, and the area is 24000. Thus, R = (200 * 240 * 300) / (4 * 24000) = 150. Since the triangle is the median triangle of the hexagon, the side length of the hexagon is twice the circumradius of the triangle of medians. Therefore, the side length of the hexagon is 2 * 150 = 300.
