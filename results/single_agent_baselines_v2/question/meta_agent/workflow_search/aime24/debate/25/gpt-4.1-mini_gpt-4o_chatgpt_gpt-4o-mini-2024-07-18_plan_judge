Question: Let ABCDEF be a convex equilateral hexagon in which all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle whose sides are extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. Find the side length of the hexagon.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The problem involves a special type of hexagon where opposite sides are parallel and equal, known as a 'parallelohexagon'. The triangle formed by the extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF is related to the hexagon's geometry. The side lengths of this triangle are 200, 240, and 300. The key insight is that the side length of the hexagon is related to the circumradius of this triangle. The circumradius R of the triangle can be found using the formula R = (abc) / (4 * Area), where a, b, and c are the side lengths of the triangle. The area of the triangle can be calculated using Heron's formula. The semiperimeter is 370, and the area is 24000. Thus, R = (200 * 240 * 300) / (4 * 24000) = 150. Since the triangle is the median triangle of the hexagon, the side length of the hexagon is twice the circumradius of the triangle of medians. Therefore, the side length of the hexagon is 2 * 150 = 300.
