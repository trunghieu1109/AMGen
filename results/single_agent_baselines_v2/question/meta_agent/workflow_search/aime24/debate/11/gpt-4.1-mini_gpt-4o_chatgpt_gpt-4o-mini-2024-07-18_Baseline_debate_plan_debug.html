    <pre>Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.
[asy] size(10cm); usepackage(&#34;tikz&#34;);label(&#34;\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(2,0)--(2,3)--(5,3)--(5,8)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}&#34;,origin); label(&#34;\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(0,3)--(3,3)--(3,5)--(8,5)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}&#34;,E); [/asy]

### thinking by Debate Agent uR36:
To solve this problem, we need to find paths on an 8x8 grid from the lower left to the upper right corner that have exactly 4 direction changes. A path from (0,0) to (8,8) can be represented by a sequence of moves: right (R) and up (U). Each path consists of 8 R&#39;s and 8 U&#39;s, totaling 16 moves. A direction change occurs when a move changes from R to U or from U to R. To have exactly 4 direction changes, we can have sequences like RRR...UUU...RRR...UUU... (or the reverse). Let&#39;s consider a sequence where the changes occur after a certain number of moves. One possible distribution of moves that results in exactly 4 changes is: 2 R&#39;s, 4 U&#39;s, 4 R&#39;s, 6 U&#39;s. This sequence has exactly 4 changes: R to U, U to R, R to U, and U to R. The number of ways to distribute 2 R&#39;s, 4 U&#39;s, 4 R&#39;s, and 6 U&#39;s in a sequence of 16 moves can be calculated using combinations: (\frac{16!}{2!4!4!6!}).

To solve the problem, we need to find paths on an 8x8 grid that start at the lower left corner and end at the upper right corner, changing direction exactly four times. Each path consists of 8 right (R) moves and 8 up (U) moves, totaling 16 moves. Changing direction means switching from R to U or U to R, and exactly four changes imply that there are five segments of consecutive same-direction moves. We can represent these segments as (R, U, R, U, R) or (U, R, U, R, U) with the constraint that the sum of Rs must be 8 and the sum of Us must be 8. We can solve this using combinations. For example, if the path starts with R, we have segments R1, U1, R2, U2, R3 such that R1 + R2 + R3 = 8 and U1 + U2 = 8. We can use the stars and bars method to find the number of non-negative integer solutions to these equations.
