Question: Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.
[asy] size(10cm); usepackage("tikz");label("\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(2,0)--(2,3)--(5,3)--(5,8)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}",origin); label("\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(0,3)--(3,3)--(3,5)--(8,5)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}",E); [/asy]

proposed answer: To solve the problem, we need to find paths on an 8x8 grid from the lower left to the upper right corner that have exactly 4 direction changes. A path from (0,0) to (8,8) can be represented by a sequence of moves: right (R) and up (U). Each path consists of 8 R's and 8 U's, totaling 16 moves. A direction change occurs when a move changes from R to U or from U to R. To have exactly 4 direction changes, we can have sequences like RRR...UUU...RRR...UUU... (or the reverse). Let's consider a sequence where the changes occur after a certain number of moves. One possible distribution of moves that results in exactly 4 changes is: 2 R's, 4 U's, 4 R's, 6 U's. This sequence has exactly 4 changes: R to U, U to R, R to U, and U to R. The number of ways to distribute 2 R's, 4 U's, 4 R's, and 6 U's in a sequence of 16 moves can be calculated using combinations: (16!/(2!4!4!6!)).
