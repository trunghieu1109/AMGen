    <pre>Define $f(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{4}|$. Find the number of intersections of the graphs of \[y=4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \quad\text{ and }\quad x=4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))).\]

### thinking by Debate Agent tVXG:
To find the number of intersections of the graphs, we need to analyze the functions and their compositions. First, understand the functions f(x) and g(x). The function f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| is a piecewise function that depends on the value of |x| relative to 1/2. Similarly, g(x) = ||x| - 1/4| is another piecewise function. The compositions involve trigonometric functions sin(2πx) and cos(3πy), which oscillate between -1 and 1. For the function y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))), we analyze the behavior of sin(2πx) over one period [0,1], and similarly for x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). By symmetry and periodicity of the trigonometric functions and the piecewise nature of f and g, the intersections are determined by the conditions where the equations are satisfied simultaneously. We solve for intersections by setting the expressions equal and analyzing the periodic behavior.

### thinking by Debate Agent 0Xmt:
Let&#39;s first understand the functions f(x) and g(x). The function f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| takes the absolute value of x, subtracts 1/2, and then takes the absolute value again. Similarly, g(x) = ||x| - 1/4| follows the same pattern but subtracts 1/4 instead. We need to consider the composition of these functions with trigonometric functions and then determine where the graphs intersect.

For y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))), we analyze the behavior of the function. The sine function, sin(2πx), oscillates between -1 and 1. The absolute value of sin(2πx) will range from 0 to 1. Applying f(x), we get f(sin(2πx)) = ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2|, which will range from 0 to 1/2. Applying g(x) to this result, g(f(sin(2πx))) = ||f(sin(2πx))| - 1/4| will range from 0 to 1/4. Finally, multiplying by 4 gives a range from 0 to 1.

For x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))), we perform a similar analysis. The cosine function, cos(3πy), also oscillates between -1 and 1. Therefore, the absolute value of cos(3πy) will range from 0 to 1. Applying f(x), we get f(cos(3πy)) = ||cos(3πy)| - 1/2|, which also ranges from 0 to 1/2. Applying g(x), g(f(cos(3πy))) = ||f(cos(3πy))| - 1/4| will range from 0 to 1/4. Multiplying by 4 gives a range from 0 to 1.

The intersection points occur when the values of y in the first equation match the values of x in the second equation. Both equations vary between 0 and 1, and due to the periodic nature of sine and cosine, the intersections are periodic as well. We need to count how many distinct intersections occur over one period of the functions involved.

Both functions are periodic with respect to x and y, and the transformations applied do not affect the periodicity significantly. Therefore, we need to find the number of solutions to the equation 4g(f(sin(2πx))) = x for x in [0,1].

Since both functions oscillate between 0 and 1, we need to determine the number of times the transformed sine function equals the transformed cosine function over one period. The transformations applied preserve the periodic nature, so we count the number of solutions over one period.
