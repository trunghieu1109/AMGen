Question: Define $f(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{4}|$. Find the number of intersections of the graphs of \[y=4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \quad\text{ and }\quad x=4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))).\]
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To solve the problem, we need to analyze the functions and their compositions. The function f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| is a piecewise function that depends on the value of |x| relative to 1/2. Similarly, g(x) = ||x| - 1/4| is another piecewise function. The compositions involve trigonometric functions sin(2πx) and cos(3πy), which oscillate between -1 and 1. For the function y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))), we analyze the behavior of sin(2πx) over one period [0,1], and similarly for x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). By symmetry and periodicity of the trigonometric functions and the piecewise nature of f and g, the intersections are determined by the conditions where the equations are satisfied simultaneously. We solve for intersections by setting the expressions equal and analyzing the periodic behavior. The key is to find the number of solutions to the equation 4g(f(sin(2πx))) = x for x in [0,1]. Since both functions oscillate between 0 and 1, we need to determine the number of times the transformed sine function equals the transformed cosine function over one period. The transformations applied preserve the periodic nature, so we count the number of solutions over one period. After careful consideration, the number of intersections is 12.
