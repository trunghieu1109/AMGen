Question: Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.\Pattern: debate
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Final Decision Agent IZ4H', content="The tetrahedron described is an orthocentric tetrahedron because the opposite edges are equal: AB = CD, AC = BD, and BC = AD. In an orthocentric tetrahedron, the distances from the incenter (denoted as I) to each face are equal. The inradius (distance from I to each face) of an orthocentric tetrahedron can be calculated using the formula: r = \\frac{3V}{S}, where V is the volume of the tetrahedron and S is the total surface area. \n\nTo find the volume V, we use the Cayley-Menger determinant method. The determinant for the volume is given by the formula:\n\nV^2 = \\frac{1}{288} \\begin{vmatrix} 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 41 & 80 & 89 \\\\ 1 & 41 & 0 & 89 & 80 \\\\ 1 & 80 & 89 & 0 & 41 \\\\ 1 & 89 & 80 & 41 & 0 \\end{vmatrix}\n\nCalculating this determinant, we find that V^2 = 256, so V = 16.\n\nNext, we calculate the total surface area S of the tetrahedron.

In an orthocentric tetrahedron, the distances from the incenter (denoted as I) to each face are equal. The inradius (distance from I to each face) of an orthocentric tetrahedron can be calculated using the formula: r = \\frac{3V}{S}, where V is the volume of the tetrahedron and S is the total surface area. \n\nLet's start by calculating the volume V of the tetrahedron using the Cayley-Menger determinant method.

The given tetrahedron is isosceles with equal opposite edges. We can use the formula for the inradius of a tetrahedron: \\( r = \\frac{3V}{S} \\), where \\( V \\) is the volume of the tetrahedron and \\( S \\) is the total surface area. The volume can be calculated using the Cayley-Menger determinant for the given edge lengths. The surface area is the sum of the areas of the four triangular faces. After calculating \\( V \\) and \\( S \\), we substitute these into the inradius formula to find the inradius in the form \\( \\frac{m \\sqrt{n}}{p} \\) and compute \\( m+n+p \\).\n\n### answer by Debate Agent OK7q:\n46\n\n### answer by Debate Agent VPa5:\n32\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
