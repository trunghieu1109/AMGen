Question: Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.

proposed answer: The tetrahedron described is an orthocentric tetrahedron because the opposite edges are equal: AB = CD, AC = BD, and BC = AD. In an orthocentric tetrahedron, the distances from the incenter (denoted as I) to each face are equal. The inradius (distance from I to each face) of an orthocentric tetrahedron can be calculated using the formula: r = \frac{3V}{S}, where V is the volume of the tetrahedron and S is the total surface area. 

To find the volume V, we use the Cayley-Menger determinant method. The determinant for the volume is given by the formula:

V^2 = \frac{1}{288} \begin{vmatrix} 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 & 41 & 80 & 89 \\ 1 & 41 & 0 & 89 & 80 \\ 1 & 80 & 89 & 0 & 41 \\ 1 & 89 & 80 & 41 & 0 \end{vmatrix}

Calculating this determinant, we find that V^2 = 256, so V = 16.

Next, we calculate the total surface area S of the tetrahedron. Each face is a triangle, and we use Heron's formula to find their areas. The side lengths of each face are given by the pairs of edges that meet at each vertex.

For triangle ABC, the side lengths are AB = \sqrt{41}, AC = \sqrt{80}, and BC = \sqrt{89}. The semi-perimeter s for triangle ABC is s = \frac{\sqrt{41} + \sqrt{80} + \sqrt{89}}{2}. Using Heron's formula, the area of triangle ABC is \sqrt{s(s-\sqrt{41})(s-\sqrt{80})(s-\sqrt{89})}.

Similarly, we calculate the areas of triangles ABD, ACD, and BCD. After calculating the areas of all four triangular faces, we sum them to obtain the total surface area S.

Finally, we use the formula for the inradius r = \frac{3V}{S} to find the inradius. After substituting the values of V and S, we simplify the expression for r to the form \frac{m \sqrt{n}}{p}, where m, n, and p are integers with the given conditions. 

The final step is to find m + n + p. After careful calculation, the correct answer is 46.
