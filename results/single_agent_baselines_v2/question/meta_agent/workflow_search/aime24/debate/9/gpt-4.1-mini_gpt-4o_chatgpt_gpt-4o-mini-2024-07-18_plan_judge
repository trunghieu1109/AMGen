Question: Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: To find the probability of Jen winning the grand prize given that she has won a prize, we first calculate the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from the set S, which is \( \binom{10}{4} = 210 \). Next, we calculate the number of ways Jen can win a prize, which means she has at least 2 numbers matching the drawn numbers. We consider the cases: 2, 3, or 4 matches. For 4 matches (grand prize), there is exactly 1 way. For 3 matches, choose 3 of her numbers and 1 from the remaining 6 numbers, which is \( \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{6}{1} = 4 \times 6 = 24 \). For 2 matches, choose 2 of her numbers and 2 from the remaining 6 numbers, which is \( \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{6}{2} = 6 \times 15 = 90 \). Therefore, the total number of ways to win a prize is 1 (for 4 matches) + 24 (for 3 matches) + 90 (for 2 matches) = 115. The probability of winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is \( \frac{1}{115} \). Simplifying this fraction gives us \( \frac{1}{115} \), where m = 1 and n = 115. Therefore, m+n = 1+115 = 116.
