    <pre>Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

### thinking by Debate Agent x0pA:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of Jen winning the grand prize given that she has won a prize. First, determine the number of ways Jen can pick 4 distinct numbers from the set S, which is \( \binom{10}{4} \). Next, calculate the number of ways she can win a prize (at least 2 of her numbers are chosen). This involves cases where she has exactly 2, 3, or all 4 of her numbers in the drawn numbers. For the grand prize, all 4 of her numbers must match the drawn numbers. Finally, use conditional probability to find the probability of winning the grand prize given she has won a prize, and express it in simplest terms.

To solve the problem, we need to find the probability that Jen wins the grand prize given that she has won a prize. First, we calculate the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from the set S, which is \( \binom{10}{4} \). Next, we calculate the number of ways Jen can win a prize, which means she has at least 2 numbers matching. This can be done by considering cases: 2, 3, or 4 matches. For 4 matches, which is the grand prize, there is exactly 1 way. For 3 matches, choose 3 of her numbers and 1 from the remaining 6 numbers. For 2 matches, choose 2 of her numbers and 2 from the remaining 6. Finally, we calculate the probability of winning the grand prize given that she won a prize by dividing the number of successful grand prize outcomes by the total number of prize-winning outcomes. Simplifying this fraction gives us the answer in terms of m and n, and we find m+n.

    <pre>To find the probability of Jen winning the grand prize given that she has won a prize, we first calculate the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from the set S, which is \( \binom{10}{4} = 210 \). Next, we calculate the number of ways Jen can win a prize, which means she has at least 2 numbers matching the drawn numbers. We consider the cases: 2, 3, or 4 matches. For 4 matches (grand prize), there is exactly 1 way. For 3 matches, choose 3 of her numbers and 1 from the remaining 6 numbers, which is \( \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{6}{1} = 4 \times 6 = 24 \). For 2 matches, choose 2 of her numbers and 2 from the remaining 6 numbers, which is \( \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{6}{2} = 6 \times 15 = 90 \). Therefore, the total number of ways to win a prize is 1 (for 4 matches) + 24 (for 3 matches) + 90 (for 2 matches) = 115. The probability of winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is \( \frac{1}{115} \). Simplifying this fraction gives us \( \frac{1}{115} \), where m = 1 and n = 115. Therefore, m+n = 1+115 = 116.
