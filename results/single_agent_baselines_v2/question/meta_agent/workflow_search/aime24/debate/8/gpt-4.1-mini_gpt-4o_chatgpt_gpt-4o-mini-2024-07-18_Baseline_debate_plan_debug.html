    <pre>Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice&#39;s play.

### thinking by Debate Agent 9Kfi:
To determine the number of positive integers n for which Bob has a winning strategy, we need to analyze the winning and losing positions in the game. A losing position is one where any move leaves the opponent in a winning position. Conversely, a winning position is one where there is at least one move that leaves the opponent in a losing position. Since Alice goes first, we need to find the values of n where Bob can force a win. 

1. Base cases:
   - If n = 1, Alice takes 1 token and wins. So, n = 1 is a losing position for Bob.
   - If n = 2, Alice takes 1 token, leaving 1 token for Bob, a losing position. Hence, n = 2 is a winning position for Bob.
   - If n = 3, Alice takes 1 token, leaving 2 tokens (a winning position for Bob), or she takes 4 tokens, which isn&#39;t possible. Thus, n = 3 is a losing position for Bob.
   - If n = 4, Alice can take all 4 tokens and win, so n = 4 is a losing position for Bob.
   - If n = 5, Alice can take 1 token, leaving 4 tokens (a losing position for Bob), or 4 tokens, leaving 1 token (also a losing position for Bob). Thus, n = 5 is a winning position for Bob.

2. Generalizing the pattern:
   - For n = 6, Alice can take 1 token, leaving 5 tokens (a winning position for Bob), or 4 tokens, leaving 2 tokens (another winning position for Bob). So, n = 6 is a losing position for Bob.
   - For n = 7, Alice can take 1 token, leaving 6 tokens (a losing position for Bob), or 4 tokens, leaving 3 tokens (another losing position for Bob). So, n = 7 is a winning position for Bob.

Continuing this analysis, we observe that the losing positions for Bob occur at n = 1, 6, 7, 11, 12, 16, 17, ..., following the pattern of n = 5k + 1, 5k + 2 for integers k.

3. Counting the losing positions:
   - We need to count the values of n = 5k + 1 or 5k + 2 that are less than or equal to 2024.
   - For n = 5k + 1, k ranges from 0 to 404 (since 5 * 404 + 1 = 2021).
   - For n = 5k + 2, k ranges from 0 to 404 (since 5 * 404 + 2 = 2022).

4. Total losing positions:
   - There are 405 values for 5k + 1 and 405 values for 5k + 2.

5. Total positions from 1 to 2024: 2024.

6. Winning positions for Bob are total positions minus losing positions: 2024 - (405 + 405) = 1214.

Therefore, there are 1214 values of n for which Bob has a guaranteed winning strategy.

### thinking by Debate Agent MaFJ:
To solve this problem, we need to determine for which values of n, Bob has a winning strategy. We can use the concept of winning and losing positions in combinatorial games. A position is a losing position if every move from that position leads to a winning position for the opponent. Conversely, a position is a winning position if there is at least one move that leads to a losing position for the opponent. 

Let&#39;s analyze the positions:

1. If n = 0 (no tokens left), the player to move loses. Thus, n = 0 is a losing position.
2. If n = 1, Alice can take 1 token and win. So, n = 1 is a winning position.
3. If n = 2, Alice can take 1 token leaving 1 token for Bob, which is a winning position for Bob. Therefore, n = 2 is a losing position.
4. If n = 3, Alice can take 1 token leaving 2 tokens for Bob, which is a losing position for Bob. So, n = 3 is a winning position.
5. If n = 4, Alice can take 4 tokens and win. Thus, n = 4 is a winning position.
6. If n = 5, Alice can take 4 tokens leaving 1 token for Bob, which is a winning position for Bob. Therefore, n = 5 is a losing position.

Continuing this process, we observe a pattern: n is a losing position if n ≡ 2 (mod 3). This is because whenever n is of the form 3k + 2, Alice will leave Bob a position of the form 3k or 3k + 1, both of which are winning for Bob.

To find the number of such n ≤ 2024, we need to count the numbers of the form 3k + 2 up to 2024.

The smallest n is 2, and the largest n is found by solving 3k + 2 ≤ 2024, which gives k = 674.

Thus, the numbers are 2, 5, 8, ..., 2022. These form an arithmetic sequence with the first term 2 and the common difference 3.

The number of terms in this sequence is given by the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence: (last term - first term)/common difference + 1.

Calculating: (2022 - 2)/3 + 1 = 673 + 1 = 674.

Therefore, there are 674 values of n for which Bob has a winning strategy.
