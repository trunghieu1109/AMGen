Question: Find the number of triples of nonnegative integers \((a,b,c)\) satisfying \(a + b + c = 300\) and
\begin{equation*}
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.
\end{equation*}
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The problem involves finding the number of nonnegative integer triples (a, b, c) that satisfy two equations: a + b + c = 300 and a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000. The second equation can be rewritten as a^2(b+c) + b^2(a+c) + c^2(a+b) = 6,000,000. Using the first equation, we substitute b+c = 300-a, a+c = 300-b, and a+b = 300-c into the second equation, resulting in 300(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) - (a^3 + b^3 + c^3) = 6,000,000. Solving this system is complex, but we can try small values for a, b, and c to find a pattern or solution. Given the large number 6,000,000, it is likely that a, b, and c are relatively large numbers. By testing values and considering symmetry, we find that the number of solutions is small. After careful consideration, the correct number of solutions is 6.
