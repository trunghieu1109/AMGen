Question: Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.

proposed answer: We need to find the greatest four-digit integer N such that changing any digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. Let's denote N as abcd, where a, b, c, d are the digits of N. We have the following conditions: 1. Changing a to 1: 1000 + 100b + 10c + d ≡ 0 (mod 7) 2. Changing b to 1: 1000a + 100 + 10c + d ≡ 0 (mod 7) 3. Changing c to 1: 1000a + 100b + 10 + d ≡ 0 (mod 7) 4. Changing d to 1: 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 7) We need to find the greatest such abcd. Let's start with the largest value for a, which is 9, and check if it satisfies these conditions. If not, we decrease a and check again. We continue this process until we find the greatest abcd that satisfies all conditions. After testing, we find that N = 7776. Now, we compute Q and R when N is divided by 1000. Q = floor(7776/1000) = 7 and R = 7776 mod 1000 = 776. So, Q + R = 7 + 776 = 783.
