Question: Find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon ($12$-gon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The diagram below shows three of those rectangles.

proposed answer: To find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon, we need to consider the vertices and how they can be connected to form rectangles. A regular dodecagon has 12 vertices. A rectangle is formed by choosing two pairs of parallel sides, which in the context of a dodecagon means selecting two pairs of opposite vertices. A rectangle can be formed by selecting two pairs of opposite vertices, such that the sides of the rectangle are either sides or diagonals of the dodecagon. We need to count all such possible rectangles. We can approach this by considering the possible diagonals and sides that can form a rectangle. For a regular dodecagon, the vertices are labeled 1 through 12. A rectangle is determined by choosing two pairs of opposite vertices. For each pair of opposite vertices, there are 6 possible pairs (since there are 12 vertices, and opposite vertices are 6 apart). For each pair of opposite vertices, we can choose another pair of opposite vertices to form a rectangle. The number of ways to choose two pairs of opposite vertices is C(6, 2) = 15. Each choice of two pairs of opposite vertices forms a unique rectangle. Therefore, the total number of rectangles is 15.
