Question: Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To determine the smallest base b such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers, we need to analyze the conditions for a number n to be b-eautiful. A number n is b-eautiful if it can be expressed as a two-digit number in base b, and the sum of its digits equals the square root of n. If n is expressed as n = ab + c in base b, where a and c are the digits, then n = a*b + c, and a + c = sqrt(n). This implies n = (a + c)^2. Therefore, we have the equation a*b + c = (a + c)^2. We need to find the smallest b such that there are more than ten solutions for a and c satisfying these equations. We will check for b starting from 2 upwards. After checking, it turns out that for b = 11, there are more than ten solutions, making it the smallest base with this property.
