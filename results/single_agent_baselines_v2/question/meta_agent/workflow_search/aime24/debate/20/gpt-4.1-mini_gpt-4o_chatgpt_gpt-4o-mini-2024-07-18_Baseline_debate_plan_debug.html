    <pre>Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.

### thinking by Debate Agent Nlkg:
To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest base b such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. A b-eautiful integer n satisfies the condition that when expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits, and the sum of these digits equals the square root of n. If n is expressed as n = ab in base b, where a and b are the digits, then n = a*b + b, and a + b = sqrt(n). Since a and b are digits, 0 &lt;= a, b &lt; b. Therefore, n = a*b + b, and a + b = sqrt(n) implies n = (a + b)^2. Hence, a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = a*b + b. Simplifying, we get a^2 + b^2 + ab = b. We need to find the smallest b such that there are more than ten solutions for a and b satisfying these equations. Let&#39;s try with b = 2, 3, 4, etc., and count the number of solutions for each b.

### thinking by Debate Agent ZSZT:
To solve the problem, we need to determine when a number n is b-beautiful. A number n is b-beautiful if it can be expressed in base b as a two-digit number, whose digits sum to the square root of n. Let&#39;s express n as n = ab + c, where a and c are the digits of the number in base b, with 0 &lt;= c &lt; b and 1 &lt;= a &lt; b. The condition for n to be b-beautiful is a + c = sqrt(n). For n to be a perfect square, a + c must also be a perfect square. So, n = (a + c)^2. Therefore, n = ab + c = (a + c)^2. To find the least b where there are more than ten b-beautiful integers, we need to count the number of solutions for different values of b. For each b, we need to check if there are more than ten pairs (a, c) such that ab + c = (a + c)^2 is a perfect square. We will start checking from b = 2 upwards.

    <pre>To determine the smallest base b such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers, we need to analyze the conditions for a number n to be b-eautiful. A number n is b-eautiful if it can be expressed as a two-digit number in base b, and the sum of its digits equals the square root of n. If n is expressed as n = ab + c in base b, where a and c are the digits, then n = a*b + c, and a + c = sqrt(n). This implies n = (a + c)^2. Therefore, we have the equation a*b + c = (a + c)^2. We need to find the smallest b such that there are more than ten solutions for a and c satisfying these equations. We will check for b starting from 2 upwards. After checking, it turns out that for b = 11, there are more than ten solutions, making it the smallest base with this property.
