    <pre>Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). Then \(OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\).

### thinking by Debate Agent oX8g:
To find the unique point C on segment AB that does not belong to any segment from the family \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\), we first parameterize the segment \(\overline{AB}\). The coordinates of a point C on \(\overline{AB}\) can be expressed as \((x_C, y_C) = \left(\frac{1}{2}(1-t), \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t\right)\), where \(t\) is a parameter between 0 and 1. We need to ensure that C does not belong to any segment \(\overline{PQ}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). A segment \(\overline{PQ}\) with \(P = (x_P, 0)\) and \(Q = (0, y_Q)\) of unit length satisfies \(x_P^2 + y_Q^2 = 1\). If C lies on such a segment, then there exist \(x_P\) and \(y_Q\) such that \(x_C = x_P\) and \(y_C = y_Q\). Thus, we need \(\left(\frac{1}{2}(1-t)\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t\right)^2 = 1\). Solving this, \(\frac{1}{4}(1-t)^2 + \frac{3}{4}t^2 = 1\). Simplifying gives \(1 - t + t^2 = 1\), which simplifies to \(t(t-1) = 0\). Since \(t = 0\) or \(t = 1\) correspond to points A and B, we seek a solution where C is distinct from A and B. Thus, there is no such \(t\) that satisfies our condition, meaning C must lie on \(\overline{AB}\) itself. We find C by ensuring that the condition \(x_C = x_P\) and \(y_C = y_Q\) holds only for the endpoints A and B, which implies no other segments \(\overline{PQ}\) can pass through C. Calculating \(OC^2\), we have \(OC^2 = x_C^2 + y_C^2 = \left(\frac{1}{2}(1-t)\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t\right)^2\). Using the earlier equation, \(OC^2 = 1\) for any \(t\) and thus \(OC^2 = \frac{1}{4}(1-t)^2 + \frac{3}{4}t^2\). Solving this for \(t = \frac{1}{2}\), since it is the midpoint of \(\overline{AB}\), we find \(OC^2 = \frac{1}{4}(1-\frac{1}{2})^2 + \frac{3}{4}(\frac{1}{2})^2 = \frac{1}{4}(\frac{1}{2})^2 + \frac{3}{4}(\frac{1}{4}) = \frac{1}{16} + \frac{3}{16} = \frac{1}{4}\). Hence, \(OC^2 = \frac{1}{4}\), where \(p = 1\) and \(q = 4\), giving \(p+q = 5\).

### thinking by Debate Agent RPhF:
To solve the problem, we need to find a point C on segment AB such that C does not belong to any segment from the family \( \mathcal{F} \) except \( \overline{AB} \). Segments in \( \mathcal{F} \) have endpoints on the x-axis and y-axis, so if \( P = (x, 0) \) and \( Q = (0, y) \), then \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \). The line segment \( \overline{AB} \) can be parameterized as \( C(t) = \left( \frac{1}{2}(1-t), \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} t \right) \) for \( t \in [0, 1] \). We need to find \( t \) such that \( C(t) \) is not on any segment \( \overline{PQ} \) except \( \overline{AB} \). For \( C(t) \) to be on \( \overline{PQ} \), it must satisfy \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \). Substituting the parameterization into this equation, we solve for \( t \).
