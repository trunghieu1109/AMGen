Question: Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\).

The coordinates of a point C on \\(\\overline{AB}\\) can be expressed as \\((x_C, y_C) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}(1-t), \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}t\\right)\\), where \\(t\\) is a parameter between 0 and 1. We need to ensure that C does not belong to any segment \\(\\overline{PQ}\\) other than \\(\\overline{AB}\\). A segment \\(\\overline{PQ}\\) with \\(P = (x_P, 0)\\) and \\(Q = (0, y_Q)\\) of unit length satisfies \\(x_P^2 + y_Q^2 = 1\\). If C lies on such a segment, then there exist \\(x_P\\) and \\(y_Q\\) such that \\(x_C = x_P\\) and \\(y_C = y_Q\\). Thus, we need \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{2}(1-t)\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}t\\right)^2 = 1\\). Solving this, \\(\\frac{1}{4}(1-t)^2 + \\frac{3}{4}t^2 = 1\\). Simplifying gives \\(1 - t + t^2 = 1\\), which simplifies to \\(t(t-1) = 0\\). Since \\(t = 0\\) or \\(t = 1\\) correspond to points A and B, we seek a solution where C is distinct from A and B. Thus, there is no such \\(t\\) that satisfies our condition, meaning C must lie on \\(\\overline{AB}\\) itself. We find C by ensuring that the condition \\(x_C = x_P\\) and \\(y_C = y_Q\\) holds only for the endpoints A and B, which implies no other segments \\(\\overline{PQ}\\) can pass through C. Calculating \\(OC^2\\), we have \\(OC^2 = x_C^2 + y_C^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}(1-t)\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}t\\right)^2\\). Using the earlier equation, \\(OC^2 = 1\\) for any \\(t\\) and thus \\(OC^2 = \\frac{1}{4}(1-t)^2 + \\frac{3}{4}t^2\\). Solving this for \\(t = \\frac{1}{2}\\), since it is the midpoint of \\(\\overline{AB}\\), we find \\(OC^2 = \\frac{1}{4}(1-\\frac{1}{2})^2 + \\frac{3}{4}(\\frac{1}{2})^2 = \\frac{1}{4}(\\frac{1}{2})^2 + \\frac{3}{4}(\\frac{1}{4}) = \\frac{1}{16} + \\frac{3}{16} = \\frac{1}{4}\\). Hence, \\(OC^2 = \\frac{1}{4}\\), where \\(p = 1\\) and \\(q = 4\\), giving \\(p+q = 5\\).\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent RPhF:\nTo solve the problem, we need to find a point C on segment AB such that C does not belong to any segment from the family \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) except \\( \\overline{AB} \\). Segments in \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) have endpoints on the x-axis and y-axis, so if \\( P = (x, 0) \\) and \\( Q = (0, y) \\), then \\( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \\). The line segment \\( \\overline{AB} \\) can be parameterized as \\( C(t) = \\left( \\frac{1}{2}(1-t), \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} t \\right) \\) for \\( t \\in [0, 1] \\).
