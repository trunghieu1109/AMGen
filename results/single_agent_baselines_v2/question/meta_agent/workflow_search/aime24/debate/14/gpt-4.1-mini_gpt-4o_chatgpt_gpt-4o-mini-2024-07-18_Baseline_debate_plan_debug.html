    <pre>Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.

### thinking by Debate Agent 94pe:
To solve this problem, we start by understanding the given hyperbola \( \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \). The center of this hyperbola is at the origin, and the axes are along the x and y axes. The diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin, which means they are the axes of symmetry of the rhombus. The points \( A, B, C, \) and \( D \) lie on the hyperbola, and since \( ABCD \) is a rhombus, its diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. 

The equation of the hyperbola can be rewritten as \( \frac{x^2}{20} = 1 + \frac{y^2}{24} \), which gives us \( x^2 = 20 + \frac{20y^2}{24} \). Let&#39;s consider the diagonals \( AC \) and \( BD \), which are along the x and y axes respectively. 

For the diagonal along the x-axis, the points \( A \) and \( C \) have coordinates \( (x_1, 0) \) and \( (-x_1, 0) \). For the diagonal along the y-axis, the points \( B \) and \( D \) have coordinates \( (0, y_1) \) and \( (0, -y_1) \). 

Since these points are on the hyperbola, they satisfy the hyperbola&#39;s equation: 
1. For points \( A \) and \( C \): \( \frac{x_1^2}{20} = 1 \Rightarrow x_1^2 = 20 \).
2. For points \( B \) and \( D \): \( -\frac{y_1^2}{24} = -1 \Rightarrow y_1^2 = 24 \).

The diagonals of the rhombus are \( 2x_1 \) and \( 2y_1 \), so \( AC = 2\sqrt{20} \) and \( BD = 2\sqrt{24} \). The area of the rhombus is given by \( \frac{1}{2} \times AC \times BD = \frac{1}{2} \times 2\sqrt{20} \times 2\sqrt{24} = 2\sqrt{480} \).

The greatest real number that is less than \( BD^2 \) is the maximum value of \( 4y_1^2 \) given the constraint \( x_1^2 = 20 \). Since \( y_1^2 = 24 \) from the hyperbola equation, \( BD^2 = 4 \times 24 = 96 \).

Thus, the greatest real number less than \( BD^2 \) is 95.

### thinking by Debate Agent 8lRD:
To solve the problem, we start by understanding the properties of the hyperbola and the rhombus. The hyperbola given is centered at the origin with the equation \( \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \). The diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin, which means the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. Let the vertices of the rhombus be \( A(x_1, y_1) \), \( B(x_2, y_2) \), \( C(-x_1, -y_1) \), and \( D(-x_2, -y_2) \). The diagonals are \( AC \) and \( BD \), and they intersect at the origin. The length \( BD \) is given by \( \sqrt{(x_2 - (-x_2))^2 + (y_2 - (-y_2))^2} = 2\sqrt{x_2^2 + y_2^2} \). We need to maximize \( BD^2 = 4(x_2^2 + y_2^2) \) subject to the constraint that \( (x_2, y_2) \) lies on the hyperbola. Substituting into the hyperbola equation, \( \frac{x_2^2}{20} - \frac{y_2^2}{24} = 1 \), we multiply by 120 to get \( 6x_2^2 - 5y_2^2 = 120 \), or \( 6x_2^2 = 5y_2^2 + 120 \). Substituting \( x_2^2 = \frac{5y_2^2 + 120}{6} \) into \( BD^2 = 4(x_2^2 + y_2^2) \), we have \( BD^2 = 4\left( \frac{5y_2^2 + 120}{6} + y_2^2 \right) = \frac{4}{6}(5y_2^2 + 120) + 4y_2^2 = \frac{4}{6}(5y_2^2 + 120) + 4y_2^2 = \frac{20}{6}y_2^2 + 80 + 4y_2^2 = \frac{44}{6}y_2^2 + 80 \). To maximize \( BD^2 \), we need to maximize \( y_2^2 \) under the constraint \( 6x_2^2 - 5y_2^2 = 120 \). Solving for \( y_2^2 \), we find that the maximum \( y_2^2 \) occurs when the derivative of \( BD^2 \) with respect to \( y_2^2 \) is zero, or when \( x_2^2 = 0 \), which is not possible, so instead we maximize by finding the largest possible value for \( y_2^2 \) that keeps \( x_2^2 \) positive. Solving \( 6x_2^2 - 5y_2^2 = 120 \) gives \( y_2^2 = \frac{6x_2^2 - 120}{5} \), and substituting into the expression for \( BD^2 \), we find the maximum occurs when \( x_2^2 = 20 \) and \( y_2^2 = 24 \), giving \( BD^2 = \frac{44}{6} \times 24 + 80 = 176 \). The greatest integer less than 176 is 175.

The diagonals of the rhombus are along the x and y axes, so the vertices are \( (x_1, 0), (-x_1, 0), (0, y_1), (0, -y_1) \). The points must satisfy the hyperbola equation. For the x-axis points, \( x_1^2 = 20 \). For the y-axis points, \( y_1^2 = 24 \). The length of diagonal BD is \( 2y_1 \), so \( BD^2 = 4y_1^2 = 96 \). The greatest integer less than 96 is 95. Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD^2 for all such rhombi is 95.
