Question: Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To solve the problem, we need to find the maximum value of BD^2 for a rhombus inscribed in the hyperbola \( \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \) with diagonals intersecting at the origin. The diagonals of the rhombus are along the x and y axes, so the vertices are \( (x_1, 0), (-x_1, 0), (0, y_1), (0, -y_1) \). The points must satisfy the hyperbola equation. For the x-axis points, \( x_1^2 = 20 \). For the y-axis points, \( y_1^2 = 24 \). The length of diagonal BD is \( 2y_1 \), so \( BD^2 = 4y_1^2 = 96 \). The greatest integer less than 96 is 95. Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD^2 for all such rhombi is 95.
