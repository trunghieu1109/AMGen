Question: There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\times5$ grid such that: 

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To solve this problem, we need to fill the 5x5 grid such that each row and each column contains chips of only one color, and no additional chips can be added without violating the conditions. This means that if a row is filled with white chips, the columns that intersect with this row must be filled with black chips, and vice versa. We can choose k rows to be filled with white chips and the remaining 5-k rows will be filled with black chips. Similarly, k columns will need to be black and 5-k columns will need to be white. The number of ways to choose k rows to be filled with white chips out of 5 is given by the binomial coefficient C(5, k). Once k rows are chosen to be white, the remaining 5-k rows will be black, and similarly, k columns will need to be black and 5-k columns will need to be white. Therefore, the number of ways to fill the grid is determined by the number of ways to choose k rows for white chips, which is the same as choosing k columns for black chips, leading us to sum over all possible k from 0 to 5. The correct calculation is to sum C(5, k) for k = 0 to 5, which gives us 2^5 = 32.
