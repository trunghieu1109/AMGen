    <pre>Let $p$ be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $n^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$. Find the least positive integer $m$ such that $m^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$.

### thinking by Debate Agent GEoB:
To find the least prime number p such that there exists a positive integer n for which n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2, we start by considering the congruence n^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod p^2). This implies n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p^2). For n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p^2) to hold, n^4 + 1 must be a multiple of p^2. First, we check small primes. For p = 2, n^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 4) implies n^4 ≡ -1 (mod 4), which is impossible since n^4 is always 0 or 1 modulo 4. For p = 3, n^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 9) implies n^4 ≡ -1 (mod 9). Testing small values of n, we find that n = 2 satisfies 2^4 + 1 = 17, which is not divisible by 9, so n^4 ≡ -1 (mod 9) has no solution. For p = 5, n^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 25) implies n^4 ≡ -1 (mod 25). Testing small values of n, we find that n = 3 satisfies 3^4 + 1 = 82, which is not divisible by 25, so n^4 ≡ -1 (mod 25) has no solution. For p = 13, n^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 169) implies n^4 ≡ -1 (mod 169). Testing small values of n, we find that n = 5 satisfies 5^4 + 1 = 626, which is divisible by 169. Therefore, p = 13 is the least prime satisfying the condition. Now, we need to find the least positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 13^2. Since we found that n = 5 works, m = 5 is the least positive integer satisfying the condition.

To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest prime number p such that there exists a positive integer n with n^4 + 1 divisible by p^2. We start by considering the condition n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p^2). This implies that -1 is a fourth power residue modulo p^2. We first check small primes.

For p = 2, n^4 + 1 ≡ 1 (mod 4), so it&#39;s not divisible by 4.

For p = 3, n^4 + 1 ≡ 2 (mod 9) for any n, so it&#39;s not divisible by 9.

For p = 5, we check if n^4 ≡ -1 (mod 25). We find that 2^4 ≡ 16 ≡ -9 ≡ -1 (mod 25), so 2^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 25). Thus, p = 5 is the smallest prime satisfying this condition.

Now, we need to find the smallest m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 25. We already found that for m = 2, 2^4 + 1 = 17, which is not divisible by 25.

We try m = 3: 3^4 + 1 = 81 + 1 = 82, which is not divisible by 25.

We try m = 4: 4^4 + 1 = 256 + 1 = 257, which is not divisible by 25.

We try m = 5: 5^4 + 1 = 625 + 1 = 626, which is divisible by 25.

Thus, the smallest m is 5.
