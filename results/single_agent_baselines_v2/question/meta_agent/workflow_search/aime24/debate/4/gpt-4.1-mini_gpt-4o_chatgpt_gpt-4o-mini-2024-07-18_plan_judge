proposed answer: To find the least prime number p such that there exists a positive integer n for which n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2, we need to check small primes and see if n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p^2) has a solution. For p = 2, n^4 + 1 ≡ 1 (mod 4), so it's not divisible by 4. For p = 3, n^4 + 1 ≡ 2 (mod 9) for any n, so it's not divisible by 9. For p = 5, we check if n^4 ≡ -1 (mod 25). We find that 2^4 ≡ 16 ≡ -9 ≡ -1 (mod 25), so 2^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 25). Thus, p = 5 is the smallest prime satisfying this condition. Now, we need to find the smallest m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 25. We already found that for m = 2, 2^4 + 1 = 17, which is not divisible by 25. We try m = 3: 3^4 + 1 = 81 + 1 = 82, which is not divisible by 25. We try m = 4: 4^4 + 1 = 256 + 1 = 257, which is not divisible by 25. We try m = 5: 5^4 + 1 = 625 + 1 = 626, which is divisible by 25. Thus, the smallest m is 5.
