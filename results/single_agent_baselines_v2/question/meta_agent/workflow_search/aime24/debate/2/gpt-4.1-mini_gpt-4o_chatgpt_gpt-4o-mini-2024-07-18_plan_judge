Question: Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?

proposed answer: To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that a regular octagon, with vertices independently colored red or blue, can be rotated such that all blue vertices end up at positions originally occupied by red vertices. Each vertex is colored red or blue with equal probability, resulting in 2^8 = 256 total colorings. We apply Burnside's Lemma to count the number of colorings invariant under each rotation of the octagon. For the identity rotation, all 256 colorings are invariant. For rotations by 45, 135, 225, and 315 degrees, only monochromatic colorings (all red or all blue) are invariant, giving 2 invariant colorings each. For rotations by 90 and 270 degrees, the octagon is divided into 4 pairs of opposite vertices, and each pair must be the same color, resulting in 2^4 = 16 invariant colorings each. For the 180-degree rotation, the same logic applies, resulting in 16 invariant colorings. Applying Burnside's Lemma, the average number of invariant colorings is (256 + 2 + 16 + 2 + 16 + 2 + 16 + 2) / 8 = 39. The probability is the number of favorable colorings divided by the total number of colorings: 39/256. The fraction 39/256 is in simplest form, so m = 39 and n = 256, giving m + n = 295.
