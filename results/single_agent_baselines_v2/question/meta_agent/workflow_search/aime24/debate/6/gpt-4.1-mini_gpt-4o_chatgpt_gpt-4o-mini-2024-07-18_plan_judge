Question: Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.

proposed answer: We are given a set of rectangular boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23. Let the dimensions of a box be x, y, and z. The surface area is given by 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54, and the volume is given by xyz = 23. We need to find the smallest sphere that can contain each box. The radius of this sphere is half the diagonal of the box, which is given by sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2). We aim to minimize this diagonal. Using the surface area equation, xy + yz + zx = 27. Using the identity (x + y + z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + zx), we have x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x + y + z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx). Let x+y+z = s, then x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = s^2 - 54. To minimize x^2 + y^2 + z^2, we need to minimize s. Using the AM-GM inequality, s >= 3 * 23^(1/3) = 8.634. Thus, the smallest possible value of s is 8.634. Now, x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 8.634^2 - 54 = 20.5. The diagonal is sqrt(20.5), thus the radius is sqrt(20.5)/2. Therefore, r^2 = 20.5/4 = 5.125. Expressing 5.125 as a fraction, we have 41/8. Thus, p = 41 and q = 8, which are relatively prime. Therefore, p + q = 41 + 8 = 49.
