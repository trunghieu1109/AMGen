    <pre>Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.

### thinking by Debate Agent kE3h:
We are given a set of rectangular boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23. Let the dimensions of a box be x, y, and z. The surface area is given by 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54, and the volume is given by xyz = 23. We need to find the smallest sphere that can contain each box. The radius of this sphere is half the diagonal of the box, which is given by sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2). We aim to minimize this diagonal.\nUsing the surface area equation, xy + yz + zx = 27.\nUsing the AM-GM inequality: (xy + yz + zx) &gt;= 3(xyz)^(2/3).\nSubstituting the given values, 27 &gt;= 3 * 23^(2/3).\nCalculating 23^(2/3), we find it is approximately 6.634. Thus, 3 * 6.634 = 19.902, which is less than 27.\nThus, it is possible to find such dimensions x, y, z.\nNow, we try to minimize x^2 + y^2 + z^2.\nUsing the identity (x + y + z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + zx), we have x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x + y + z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx).\nLet x+y+z = s, then x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = s^2 - 54.\nTo minimize x^2 + y^2 + z^2, we need to minimize s.\nUsing the AM-GM inequality again, s &gt;= 3 * 23^(1/3) = 8.634.\nThus, the smallest possible value of s is 8.634.\nNow, x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 8.634^2 - 54 = 20.5.\nThe diagonal is sqrt(20.5), thus the radius is sqrt(20.5)/2.\nTherefore, r^2 = 20.5/4 = 5.125.\nExpressing 5.125 as a fraction, we have 41/8.\nThus, p = 41 and q = 8, which are relatively prime.\nTherefore, p + q = 41 + 8 = 49.

### thinking by Debate Agent HMzb:
Given the constraints for the boxes, we have two equations: surface area equation 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 and volume equation xyz = 23. We need to find the smallest sphere that can contain any such box. The diameter of the sphere must be at least the space diagonal of the box, which is \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}\). Thus, the radius \(r\) is half of this diagonal. To minimize \(r\), we need to minimize \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2\) under the given constraints. By substituting and manipulating the equations, we can express \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2\) in terms of \(xy + yz + zx\) and find its minimum value. This involves algebraic manipulation and potential use of inequalities or optimization techniques. Finally, we express \(r^2\) as a fraction and simplify it to find \(p + q\).

The surface area is given by 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54, and the volume is given by xyz = 23. We need to find the smallest sphere that can contain each box. The radius of this sphere is half the diagonal of the box, which is given by sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2). We aim to minimize this diagonal. Using the surface area equation, xy + yz + zx = 27. Using the identity (x + y + z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + zx), we have x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x + y + z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx). Let x+y+z = s, then x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = s^2 - 54. To minimize x^2 + y^2 + z^2, we need to minimize s. Using the AM-GM inequality, s &gt;= 3 * 23^(1/3) = 8.634. Thus, the smallest possible value of s is 8.634. Now, x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 8.634^2 - 54 = 20.5. The diagonal is sqrt(20.5), thus the radius is sqrt(20.5)/2. Therefore, r^2 = 20.5/4 = 5.125. Expressing 5.125 as a fraction, we have 41/8. Thus, p = 41 and q = 8, which are relatively prime. Therefore, p + q = 41 + 8 = 49.
