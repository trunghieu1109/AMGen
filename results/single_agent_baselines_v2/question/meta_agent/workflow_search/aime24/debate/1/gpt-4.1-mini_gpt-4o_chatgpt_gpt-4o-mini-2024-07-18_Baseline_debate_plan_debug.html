    <pre>Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.

### thinking by Debate Agent lkjm:
To solve this problem, we can use the power of a point theorem and properties of tangents and secants. Since D is the intersection of the tangents from B and C, D is the exsimilicenter of the circle and the triangle, meaning D lies on the polar of A with respect to the circle. Hence, AD is the polar of A. By the power of a point theorem, AD^2 = AB * AC. We need to find the length of AP, where P is the other intersection of AD with the circle. Since D is the intersection of tangents, AD is an external secant and intersects the circle at A and P. Using the power of a point theorem, AD^2 = AB * AC = AP * AD. Therefore, AP = AB * AC / AD. We calculate AD using the given side lengths and then find AP.

### thinking by Debate Agent 6Nas:
To solve this problem, we first recognize that the triangle $ABC$ is inscribed in the circle $\\omega\\$, and the tangents at points $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$. By the Power of a Point theorem, we know that $AD$ is the symmedian of triangle $ABC$. The symmedian is known to intersect the circumcircle again at the point $P$, which is the reflection of $A$ across the line $BC$. Thus, we can use the properties of the symmedian and the lengths given to find $AP$. We use the formula for the length of the symmedian given by $AP^2 = AB^2 + AC^2 - 2 \cdot \frac{AB^2 \cdot AC^2}{AB^2 + AC^2 - BC^2}$. Plugging in the values $AB = 5$, $BC = 9$, and $AC = 10$, we can calculate $AP$ and simplify it to find $m$ and $n$.

We calculate AD using the given side lengths and then find AP. The correct calculation gives AP = 33/2, so m = 33 and n = 2, thus m + n = 35.
