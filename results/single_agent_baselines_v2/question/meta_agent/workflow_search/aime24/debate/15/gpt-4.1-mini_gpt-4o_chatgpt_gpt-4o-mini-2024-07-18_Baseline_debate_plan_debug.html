    <pre>Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.

### thinking by Debate Agent Lja8:
To solve this problem, we need to find the number of residents who own all four items: a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, a garden spade, and a bag of candy hearts. We know that each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, so we focus on the other three items. Let&#39;s denote the number of people who own a diamond ring as |D| = 195, a set of golf clubs as |G| = 367, and a garden spade as |S| = 562. We are given that 437 residents own exactly two of these items and 234 own all three items. We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the number of people who own at least one of the three items (D, G, S):

|D ∪ G ∪ S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D ∩ G| - |G ∩ S| - |S ∩ D| + |D ∩ G ∩ S|.

We know that |D ∩ G ∩ S| = 234. Also, the number of residents owning exactly two items is given as 437, which implies:

|D ∩ G| + |G ∩ S| + |S ∩ D| - 3|D ∩ G ∩ S| = 437.

Substituting |D ∩ G ∩ S| = 234 into this equation, we get:

|D ∩ G| + |G ∩ S| + |S ∩ D| = 437 + 3 * 234 = 1139.

Now, substituting back into the inclusion-exclusion formula:

|D ∪ G ∪ S| = 195 + 367 + 562 - 1139 + 234 = 219.

Since there are 900 residents and each owns a bag of candy hearts, the number of residents owning all four items is:

900 - |D ∪ G ∪ S| = 900 - 219 = 681.

### thinking by Debate Agent KVjM:
To solve this problem, we need to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion and consider the given conditions. We are given the total number of residents and the number of residents owning specific items. We also know how many own exactly two or three items. We need to find those owning all four items, which includes a bag of candy hearts, diamond ring, golf clubs, and garden spade.

Let&#39;s define:
A = residents owning a diamond ring = 195
B = residents owning a set of golf clubs = 367
C = residents owning a garden spade = 562
D = residents owning a bag of candy hearts = 900 (all residents)

We are given:
|A ∩ B ∩ C| = 234 (residents owning exactly three of the diamond ring, golf clubs, and garden spade)
|A ∩ B ∩ C ∩ D| = x (residents owning all four items)

We know:
|A ∪ B ∪ C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ C|

Since |A ∩ B ∩ C| = 234, and |A ∪ B ∪ C| should equal 900 because everyone owns a bag of candy hearts, we need to find the overlaps:

|A ∩ B| + |A ∩ C| + |B ∩ C| - 2|A ∩ B ∩ C| = 437

Plugging in the known values:

|A ∩ B| + |A ∩ C| + |B ∩ C| = 437 + 2 * 234
= 437 + 468
= 905

Now, we know that:

|A| + |B| + |C| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ C| = 900

195 + 367 + 562 - 905 + 234 = 900

1124 - 905 + 234 = 900

453 = 900 - 234

So, |A ∩ B ∩ C ∩ D| = 234 - 453 = -219, which is not possible. Hence, there must be a mistake in the computation or assumptions.

Re-evaluating, it seems the inclusion-exclusion principle was not applied correctly for all intersections. Considering all residents own a bag of candy hearts, it implies that |A ∩ B ∩ C ∩ D| is actually the same as |A ∩ B ∩ C|.

Thus, the number of residents owning all four items, including candy hearts, is 234 residents.

    <pre>To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of residents who own all four items: a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, a garden spade, and a bag of candy hearts. Since every resident owns a bag of candy hearts, we focus on the other three items. We are given the number of residents who own exactly two of these items (437) and exactly three of these items (234). Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we can find the number of residents who own at least one of the three items (diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade). The formula is: |D ∪ G ∪ S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D ∩ G| - |G ∩ S| - |S ∩ D| + |D ∩ G ∩ S|. We know |D ∩ G ∩ S| = 234. The number of residents owning exactly two items is given as 437, which implies: |D ∩ G| + |G ∩ S| + |S ∩ D| - 3|D ∩ G ∩ S| = 437. Substituting |D ∩ G ∩ S| = 234 into this equation, we get: |D ∩ G| + |G ∩ S| + |S ∩ D| = 437 + 3 * 234 = 1139. Now, substituting back into the inclusion-exclusion formula: |D ∪ G ∪ S| = 195 + 367 + 562 - 1139 + 234 = 219. Since there are 900 residents and each owns a bag of candy hearts, the number of residents owning all four items is: 900 - |D ∪ G ∪ S| = 900 - 219 = 681. Therefore, the number of residents who own all four items is 681.
