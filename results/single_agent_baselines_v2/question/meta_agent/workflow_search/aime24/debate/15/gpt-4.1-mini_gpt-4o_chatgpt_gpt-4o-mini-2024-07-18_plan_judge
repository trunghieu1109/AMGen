Question: Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.

proposed answer: To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of residents who own all four items: a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, a garden spade, and a bag of candy hearts. Since every resident owns a bag of candy hearts, we focus on the other three items. We are given the number of residents who own exactly two of these items (437) and exactly three of these items (234). Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we can find the number of residents who own at least one of the three items (diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade). The formula is: |D ∪ G ∪ S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D ∩ G| - |G ∩ S| - |S ∩ D| + |D ∩ G ∩ S|. We know |D ∩ G ∩ S| = 234. The number of residents owning exactly two items is given as 437, which implies: |D ∩ G| + |G ∩ S| + |S ∩ D| - 3|D ∩ G ∩ S| = 437. Substituting |D ∩ G ∩ S| = 234 into this equation, we get: |D ∩ G| + |G ∩ S| + |S ∩ D| = 437 + 3 * 234 = 1139. Now, substituting back into the inclusion-exclusion formula: |D ∪ G ∪ S| = 195 + 367 + 562 - 1139 + 234 = 219. Since there are 900 residents and each owns a bag of candy hearts, the number of residents owning all four items is: 900 - |D ∪ G ∪ S| = 900 - 219 = 681. Therefore, the number of residents who own all four items is 681.
