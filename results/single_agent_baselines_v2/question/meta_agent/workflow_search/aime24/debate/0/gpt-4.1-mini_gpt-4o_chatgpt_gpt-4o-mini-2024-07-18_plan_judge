Question: Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To solve the problem, we need to find the values of s and t first. We have two scenarios: 1) Aya walks at s km/h and the total time is 4 hours, and 2) Aya walks at s+2 km/h and the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes (which is 2.4 hours). The equations are: 9/s + t/60 = 4 and 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4. Subtracting the second equation from the first gives 9/s - 9/(s+2) = 1.6. Solving this equation, we find s = 3. Substituting s = 3 into one of the original equations, we find t = 60 minutes. Now, we need to find the total time when Aya walks at s + 1/2 km/h. The walking time is 9/(s+1/2) = 9/(3+1/2) = 9/(7/2) = 18/7 hours. The total time including the coffee shop is 18/7 + 1 hour = 25/7 hours. Converting this to minutes, we multiply by 60 to get (25/7)*60 = 214.2857... minutes, which rounds to 214 minutes. Therefore, the correct answer is 214 minutes.
