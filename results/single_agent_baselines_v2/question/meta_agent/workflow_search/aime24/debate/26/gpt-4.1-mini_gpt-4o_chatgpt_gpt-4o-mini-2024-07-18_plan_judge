Question: Alice chooses a set $A$ of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets $B$ of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of $B$ belongs to $A$. Bob's list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To solve the problem, we need to find a set A of positive integers such that the sum of 2^(a_i - 1) for each a_i in A equals 2024. This is because for each a_i in A, there are 2^(a_i - 1) nonempty subsets of {1, 2, ..., a_i} with a_i as the maximum element. We need to express 2024 as a sum of powers of 2. The binary representation of 2024 is 11111101000, which corresponds to 2^10 + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5. Therefore, a possible set A is {11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6}, since 2^(11-1) = 2^10, 2^(10-1) = 2^9, and so on. The sum of the elements of A is 11 + 10 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 = 51.
