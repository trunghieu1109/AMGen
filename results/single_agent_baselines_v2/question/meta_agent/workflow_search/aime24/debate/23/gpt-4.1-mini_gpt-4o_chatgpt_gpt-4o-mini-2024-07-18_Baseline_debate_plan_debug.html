    <pre>Find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid so that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is $999$, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is $99$. The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$.
\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 8 \\ \hline 9 &amp; 9 &amp; 1 \\ \hline \end{array}\]

### thinking by Debate Agent WK8O:
We need to determine the number of ways to fill a 2x3 grid with digits such that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is 999, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99. The grid can be represented as: \[ \begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline a &amp; b &amp; c \\ \hline d &amp; e &amp; f \\ \hline \end{array} \] The conditions are: 1. (abc) + (def) = 999, where abc and def are the numbers formed by reading the rows left to right. 2. (ad) + (be) + (cf) = 99, where ad, be, and cf are the numbers formed by reading the columns top to bottom. Let&#39;s analyze these conditions: From the first condition, we have: 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999 From the second condition, we have: 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99 Now, let&#39;s solve these equations: First, simplify the second equation: 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99 implies: (10a + 10b + 10c) + (d + e + f) = 99. This can be rewritten as: 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99. Now consider the first equation: 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999. Let&#39;s express (d + e + f) in terms of (a + b + c): From the second equation, we have: (d + e + f) = 99 - 10(a + b + c). Substitute this into the first equation: 100a + 10b + c + 100(99 - 10(a + b + c)) + 10e + f = 999. Simplify: 100a + 10b + c + 9900 - 1000(a + b + c) + 10e + f = 999. Rearrange: 100a + 10b + c - 1000(a + b + c) + 10e + f = -8901. This equation is complex, so let&#39;s approach it differently. Consider that the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99. The maximum value for each column sum (ad, be, cf) is 18 since each digit is at most 9. Therefore, (ad) + (be) + (cf) = 99 imposes a strong constraint. We can try various combinations of a, b, c, d, e, f that satisfy both conditions, but let&#39;s focus on the example given: \[ \begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 8 \\ \hline 9 &amp; 9 &amp; 1 \\ \hline \end{array} \] Here, (abc) = 8 and (def) = 991, which satisfies the first condition: 8 + 991 = 999. For the second condition: (ad) = 9, (be) = 9, (cf) = 81, and 9 + 9 + 81 = 99. This example works, and we need to find similar arrangements. Now, let&#39;s consider the number of possible solutions. Since we have to satisfy both conditions simultaneously, and given the constraints, there are limited possibilities. After testing various combinations, we find that there are exactly two solutions: \[ \begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 8 \\ \hline 9 &amp; 9 &amp; 1 \\ \hline \end{array} \] and \[ \begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 8 \\ \hline 8 &amp; 9 &amp; 1 \\ \hline \end{array} \] Both satisfy the conditions: 1. (abc) + (def) = 999 2. (ad) + (be) + (cf) = 99.

To solve the problem, let&#39;s define the grid as follows: the top row has digits A, B, and C, and the bottom row has digits D, E, and F. The numbers formed by reading left to right are 100A + 10B + C and 100D + 10E + F. Their sum should be 999, so 100A + 10B + C + 100D + 10E + F = 999. The numbers formed by reading top to bottom are 10A + D, 10B + E, and 10C + F. Their sum should be 99, so 10A + D + 10B + E + 10C + F = 99. We now have two equations: 100A + 10B + C + 100D + 10E + F = 999 and 10A + D + 10B + E + 10C + F = 99. We can subtract the second equation from the first to simplify: (100A + 10B + C + 100D + 10E + F) - (10A + D + 10B + E + 10C + F) = 999 - 99, which simplifies to 90A + 90D = 900. This further simplifies to A + D = 10. Given this constraint, we can iterate over possible values for A and D. Since A and D are digits (0-9), the pairs (A, D) are (1, 9), (2, 8), (3, 7), (4, 6), (5, 5), (6, 4), (7, 3), (8, 2), and (9, 1). For each pair, we solve for B, C, E, F using the constraints: 10A + D + 10B + E + 10C + F = 99 and 100A + 10B + C + 100D + 10E + F = 999. By iterating over these pairs and solving for B, C, E, F, we find that the only valid configuration is (A, B, C, D, E, F) = (0, 0, 8, 9, 9, 1) which matches the given example. Therefore, there is only one way to arrange the digits.

From the second condition, we have: 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99. Subtracting the second equation from the first gives: 90a + 90d = 900, which simplifies to a + d = 10. Given this constraint, we can iterate over possible values for a and d. Since a and d are digits (0-9), the pairs (a, d) are (1, 9), (2, 8), (3, 7), (4, 6), (5, 5), (6, 4), (7, 3), (8, 2), and (9, 1). For each pair, we solve for b, c, e, f using the constraints: 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99 and 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999.
