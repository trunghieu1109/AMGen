Question: Find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid so that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is $999$, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is $99$. The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$.
\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\ \hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\ \hline \end{array}\]

proposed answer: To solve the problem, we need to fill a 2x3 grid with digits such that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is 999, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99. Let's denote the grid as follows: \[ \begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline a & b & c \\ \hline d & e & f \\ \hline \end{array} \] The conditions are: 1. (abc) + (def) = 999, where abc and def are the numbers formed by reading the rows left to right. 2. (ad) + (be) + (cf) = 99, where ad, be, and cf are the numbers formed by reading the columns top to bottom. From the first condition, we have: 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999. From the second condition, we have: 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99. Subtracting the second equation from the first gives: 90a + 90d = 900, which simplifies to a + d = 10. Given this constraint, we can iterate over possible values for a and d. Since a and d are digits (0-9), the pairs (a, d) are (1, 9), (2, 8), (3, 7), (4, 6), (5, 5), (6, 4), (7, 3), (8, 2), and (9, 1). For each pair, we solve for b, c, e, f using the constraints: 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99 and 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999. By iterating over these pairs and solving for b, c, e, f, we find that the only valid configuration is (a, b, c, d, e, f) = (0, 0, 8, 9, 9, 1) which matches the given example. Therefore, there is only one way to arrange the digits.
