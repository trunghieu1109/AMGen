    <pre>Let&#39;s denote the list of integers as \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) where \( a_1 \leq a_2 \leq \ldots \leq a_n \). The sum of the items is 30, so \( a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_n = 30 \). The unique mode is 9, meaning 9 appears more frequently than any other number. The median is not in the list, which means the list must have an even number of elements (since an odd number of elements would mean the median is one of the elements). Let&#39;s assume the list has 6 elements, which is a reasonable starting point given the constraints. This means the median is the average of the 3rd and 4th elements, and this average is not an integer in the list. Let&#39;s try to construct such a list.

To have 9 as the unique mode, it must appear at least twice, and more than any other number. Let&#39;s assume 9 appears 3 times. So we have \( a_4 = a_5 = a_6 = 9 \). The sum of these three 9s is 27, so the sum of the first three elements \( a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 3 \). The median, being the average of the 3rd and 4th element, is \( \frac{a_3 + a_4}{2} = \frac{a_3 + 9}{2} \), and this is not in the list.

Let&#39;s try \( a_1 = a_2 = 1 \) and \( a_3 = 1 \). Then \( a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 \). The list is \( 1, 1, 1, 9, 9, 9 \).

The median is \( \frac{1 + 9}{2} = 5 \), which is not in the list. Therefore, this list satisfies all conditions.

Now, let&#39;s calculate the sum of the squares: \( 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 81 + 81 + 81 = 246 \).
