Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent fZQG', content='We are given two logarithmic equations: \\( \\log_x(y^x) = 10 \\) and \\( \\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 \\). We need to find the product \\( xy \\).\n\nFirst, consider the equation \\( \\log_x(y^x) = 10 \\). This can be rewritten using the properties of logarithms as:\n\\[ \\log_x(y^x) = x \\log_x(y) = 10 \\]\n\\[ \\log_x(y) = \\frac{10}{x} \\]\n\nNext, consider the equation \\( \\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 \\). This can be rewritten as:\n\\[ \\log_y(x^{4y}) = 4y \\log_y(x) = 10 \\]\n\\[ \\log_y(x) = \\frac{10}{4y} = \\frac{5}{2y} \\]\n\nWe now have two expressions for the logarithms:\n1. \\( \\log_x(y) = \\frac{10}{x} \\)\n2. \\( \\log_y(x) = \\frac{5}{2y} \\)\n\nUsing the change of base formula, we know that \\( \\log_x(y) = \\frac{1}{\\log_y(x)} \\). Therefore, we equate:\n\\[ \\frac{10}{x} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{5}{2y}} = \\frac{2y}{5} \\]\n\nCross-multiplying gives:\n\\[ 10 \\cdot 5 = 2y \\cdot x \\]\n\\[ 50 = 2xy \\]\n\\[ xy = 25 \\]\n\nThus, the product \\( xy \\) is 25.\n\nAnswer:25', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
