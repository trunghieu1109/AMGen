Question: There exist real numbers $x$ and $y$, both greater than 1, such that $\log_x\left(y^x\right)=\log_y\left(x^{4y}\right)=10$. Find $xy$.
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: We are given two logarithmic equations: \( \log_x(y^x) = 10 \) and \( \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 \). We need to find the product \( xy \).

First, consider the equation \( \log_x(y^x) = 10 \). This can be rewritten using the properties of logarithms as:
\[ \log_x(y^x) = x \log_x(y) = 10 \]
\[ \log_x(y) = \frac{10}{x} \]

Next, consider the equation \( \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 \). This can be rewritten as:
\[ \log_y(x^{4y}) = 4y \log_y(x) = 10 \]
\[ \log_y(x) = \frac{10}{4y} = \frac{5}{2y} \]

We now have two expressions for the logarithms:
1. \( \log_x(y) = \frac{10}{x} \)
2. \( \log_y(x) = \frac{5}{2y} \)

Using the change of base formula, we know that \( \log_x(y) = \frac{1}{\log_y(x)} \). Therefore, we equate:
\[ \frac{10}{x} = \frac{1}{\frac{5}{2y}} = \frac{2y}{5} \]

Cross-multiplying gives:
\[ 10 \cdot 5 = 2y \cdot x \]
\[ 50 = 2xy \]
\[ xy = 25 \]

Thus, the product \( xy \) is 25.
