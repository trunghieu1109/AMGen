    <pre>Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice&#39;s play.

Please think step by step and then solve the task.</pre>

    <pre>To solve this problem, we need to determine the losing positions for Alice, which are the positions where Bob can guarantee a win. We start by analyzing small values of n. 

1. For n = 1, Alice takes 1 token and wins. So, n = 1 is a losing position for Bob.
2. For n = 2, Alice takes 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob. Bob loses. So, n = 2 is a losing position for Bob.
3. For n = 3, Alice takes 1 token, leaving 2 for Bob. Bob loses. So, n = 3 is a losing position for Bob.
4. For n = 4, Alice can take 4 tokens and win. So, n = 4 is a winning position for Alice.
5. For n = 5, Alice can take 4 tokens, leaving 1 for Bob. Bob loses. So, n = 5 is a losing position for Bob.

Continuing this analysis, we find that n = 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, ... are losing positions for Bob. These losing positions occur at n = 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, ...

A pattern emerges: the losing positions are those that are not congruent to 0 modulo 4. Specifically, they are of the form n = 4k + 1, 4k + 2, or 4k + 3. 

Therefore, the winning positions for Bob are those of the form n = 4k, where Alice cannot leave a losing position for Bob.

To find the number of such positions less than or equal to 2024, we calculate the number of integers n such that n = 4k and n &lt;= 2024. This is equivalent to finding the largest k such that 4k &lt;= 2024.

The largest such k is k = 506, since 4 * 506 = 2024.

Thus, there are 506 integers n such that Bob has a winning strategy.
