Question: Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.

proposed answer: We have a total of 900 residents, each owning a bag of candy hearts, and some owning diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades. Let's denote the sets as follows: D for diamond rings, G for golf clubs, and S for garden spades. We know the following: |D| = 195, |G| = 367, |S| = 562. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these items, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these items. We need to find the number of residents who own all four items, including the candy hearts. The total number of residents who own at least one of the three items (D, G, S) is given by the principle of inclusion-exclusion: |D ∪ G ∪ S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D ∩ G| - |G ∩ S| - |S ∩ D| + |D ∩ G ∩ S|. We know that 437 own exactly two items, so |D ∩ G| + |G ∩ S| + |S ∩ D| - 3|D ∩ G ∩ S| = 437. Also, we know 234 own exactly three items, so |D ∩ G ∩ S| = 234. Substituting |D ∩ G ∩ S| = 234 into the equation for those owning exactly two items gives us: |D ∩ G| + |G ∩ S| + |S ∩ D| = 437 + 3(234) = 1139. Now, we substitute these values into the inclusion-exclusion formula: |D ∪ G ∪ S| = 195 + 367 + 562 - 1139 + 234 = 219. Thus, 900 - 219 = 681 residents own only the candy hearts. Therefore, the number of residents who own all four items (including the candy hearts) is 234.
