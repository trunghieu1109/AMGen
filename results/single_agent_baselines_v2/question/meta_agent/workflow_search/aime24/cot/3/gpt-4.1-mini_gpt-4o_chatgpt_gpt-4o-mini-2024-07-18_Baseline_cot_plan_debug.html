    <pre>To find the number of intersections of the graphs of the given equations, we need to understand the behavior of the functions involved. First, consider the function f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. This function takes the absolute value of x, subtracts 1/2, and then takes the absolute value again. Similarly, g(x) = ||x| - 1/4| behaves in a similar manner but with 1/4 instead of 1/2. Next, consider the composition h(x) = 4g(f(x)). This function will take the output of f(x), apply g to it, and then multiply the result by 4. The task is to find the intersections of the curves y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). To do this, we need to find pairs (x, y) such that both equations are satisfied simultaneously. Since both sin(2πx) and cos(3πy) are periodic functions, we focus on the intervals [0, 1] for x and [0, 1] for y, considering the periodicity. The key is to determine how many solutions exist for 4g(f(sin(2πx))) = x and 4g(f(cos(3πy))) = y within these intervals. By analyzing the periodicity and symmetry of the functions, we can determine the number of such solutions.
