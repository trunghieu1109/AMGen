Question: Let ABCDEF be a convex equilateral hexagon in which all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle whose sides are extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. Find the side length of the hexagon.\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent ALYJ', content='The hexagon ABCDEF is equilateral and has opposite sides parallel, meaning it is a symmetric hexagon. The triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF means that these segments act like medians of the triangle with lengths 200, 240, and 300. The sides of the triangle are given by the formula for the medians: let the sides of the triangle be a, b, and c, and the medians be m_a, m_b, m_c. The formula for the median from side a is m_a = (1/2) * sqrt(2b^2 + 2c^2 - a^2). We can use the relation that the sum of the squares of the medians is 3/4 times the sum of the squares of the sides to find the side length of the hexagon. For an equilateral triangle, this simplifies to: m^2 = 3/4 * s^2, where m is the length of the median and s is the side of the triangle. Solving for s, we find that the side length of the hexagon is 140.\n\nAnswer:140', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
