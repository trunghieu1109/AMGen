    <pre>To solve the problem, we need to find the maximum possible value of the square of the diagonal BD for rhombus ABCD with diagonals intersecting at the origin on the given hyperbola. The equation of the hyperbola is \( \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \). The diagonals of the rhombus will be along the axes of symmetry of the hyperbola, so we can assume the points A, B, C, and D lie on the hyperbola such that the diagonals are along the x and y axes. Let A = (a, 0), B = (0, b), C = (-a, 0), and D = (0, -b). The condition that ABCD is a rhombus implies that the diagonals are equal, so \( 2a = 2b \), meaning \( a = b \). Substituting into the hyperbola equation for A, we have \( \frac{a^2}{20} - \frac{0^2}{24} = 1 \), leading to \( a^2 = 20 \). Similarly, for B, \( \frac{0^2}{20} - \frac{b^2}{24} = 1 \) gives \( b^2 = 24 \). Since a = b for the rhombus, \( a^2 = b^2 \), we must have \( a^2 = 20 \) and \( a^2 = 24 \), which is not possible. Therefore, we need to consider the general case where A and C are on one hyperbola branch and B and D are on the other. Let A = (x_1, y_1), C = (-x_1, -y_1), B = (x_2, y_2), D = (-x_2, -y_2). The condition for the rhombus is that \( AC = BD \). The maximum value of \( BD^2 \) occurs when the points are farthest apart along the axes. Since the hyperbola is symmetric, the maximum value occurs when the points are at the vertices of the hyperbola, where \( x_1 = \sqrt{20} \) and \( y_2 = \sqrt{24} \). The maximum \( BD^2 = 4y_2^2 = 4 \times 24 = 96 \). Therefore, the greatest real number less than \( BD^2 \) is 95.
