Question: Let $\triangle ABC$ have circumcenter $O$ and incenter $I$ with $\overline{IA}\perp\overline{OI}$, circumradius $13$, and inradius $6$. Find $AB\cdot AC$.
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: We are given a triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with circumcenter \( O \) and incenter \( I \). The circumradius \( R \) is 13 and the inradius \( r \) is 6. We also know that \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), which implies that \( A \) is the exsimilicenter of the circumcircle and incircle. This means \( \frac{AI}{IO} = \frac{r}{R} = \frac{6}{13} \). Let \( d \) be the distance \( OI \). Then \( AI = \frac{6}{13}d \) and \( IO = \frac{7}{13}d \). By Euler's formula for the distance between the circumcenter and incenter, we have \( OI^2 = R^2 - 2Rr = 13^2 - 2 \times 13 \times 6 = 169 - 156 = 13 \). Thus, \( OI = \sqrt{13} \). We are tasked with finding \( AB \cdot AC \). By the formula for the product of two sides of a triangle in terms of the inradius and circumradius, we have \( AB \cdot AC = c^2 + 4Rr \), where \( c = BC \). However, we can directly use the relation \( AB \cdot AC = c^2 + 4Rr \) since we have \( r \) and \( R \). For an exsimilicenter, the formula simplifies to \( AB \cdot AC = 4Rr \). Therefore, \( AB \cdot AC = 4 \times 13 \times 6 = 312 \).
