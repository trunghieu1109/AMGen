Question: Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent y2Ux', content='To solve the problem, I need to determine when a positive integer n is b-beautiful. A number n is b-beautiful if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base b, and these two digits sum to the square root of n. In base b, a two-digit number can be expressed as n = ab + c, where a and c are digits (0 <= a, c < b) and a != 0 (since it is a two-digit number). The condition for b-beautiful is a + c = sqrt(n). Therefore, we have n = (a + c)^2. This gives us (ab + c) = (a + c)^2. Expanding this gives ab + c = a^2 + 2ac + c^2. Rearranging, we get ab = a^2 + c^2 + ac. This equation must hold for more than 10 different pairs (a, c) for a given base b. To find the smallest such b, we need to check for each b starting from b = 2 and count the number of solutions (a, c) that satisfy the condition ab = a^2 + c^2 + ac.\n\nAnswer:14', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
