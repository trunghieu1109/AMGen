Question: Find the largest possible real part of \[(75+117i)z+\frac{96+144i}{z}\]where $z$ is a complex number with $|z|=4$.
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: Let z = re^{iθ} where r = 4, so z = 4e^{iθ}. Then \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1}{4}e^{-iθ}. We want to maximize the real part of (75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z}. Substitute z = 4e^{iθ} and \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1}{4}e^{-iθ} into the expression. We get (75+117i)(4e^{iθ}) + (96+144i)(\frac{1}{4}e^{-iθ}). Simplifying, this becomes 300e^{iθ} + 384i e^{iθ} + 24e^{-iθ} + 36i e^{-iθ}. Combine like terms: (300 + 384i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}. The real part is 300cos(θ) + 24cos(θ) = 324cos(θ). The maximum value of cos(θ) is 1, so the maximum real part is 324.
