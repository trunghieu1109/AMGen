Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent hIS8', content='Let z = re^{iθ} where r = 4, so z = 4e^{iθ}. Then \\frac{1}{z} = \\frac{1}{4}e^{-iθ}. We want to maximize the real part of (75+117i)z + \\frac{96+144i}{z}. Substitute z = 4e^{iθ} and \\frac{1}{z} = \\frac{1}{4}e^{-iθ} into the expression. We get (75+117i)(4e^{iθ}) + (96+144i)(\\frac{1}{4}e^{-iθ}). Simplifying, this becomes 300e^{iθ} + 384i e^{iθ} + 24e^{-iθ} + 36i e^{-iθ}. Combine like terms: (300 + 384i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}. The real part is 300cos(θ) + 24cos(θ) = 324cos(θ). The maximum value of cos(θ) is 1, so the maximum real part is 324.\n\nAnswer:324', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
