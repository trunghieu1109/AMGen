Question: Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: To solve this problem, we need to find the greatest four-digit integer N such that changing any digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. We start with the largest four-digit number, 9999, and check if it satisfies the condition. If not, we decrement the number and check again. We need to ensure that changing any digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. Once we find such a number, we calculate Q and R, where Q is the quotient and R is the remainder when N is divided by 1000, and then find Q + R.
