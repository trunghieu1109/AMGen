Question: Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent zLTE', content='To solve this problem, we need to find the greatest four-digit integer N such that changing any digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. We start with the largest four-digit number, 9999, and check if it satisfies the condition. If not, we decrement the number and check again. We need to ensure that changing any digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. Once we find such a number, we calculate Q and R, where Q is the quotient and R is the remainder when N is divided by 1000, and then find Q + R.\n\nAnswer:1007', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
