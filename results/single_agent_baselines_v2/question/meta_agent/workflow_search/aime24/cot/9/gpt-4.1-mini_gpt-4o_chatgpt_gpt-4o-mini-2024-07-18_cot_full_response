Question: Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent d7nx', content="To solve this problem, we need to calculate two probabilities: the probability of Jen winning a prize, and the probability of Jen winning the grand prize given that she won a prize. The sample space for the lottery is choosing 4 numbers from the set S = {1, 2, 3, ..., 10}, which has a total of \\( \\binom{10}{4} = 210 \\) possible combinations.\n\n1. Probability of winning a prize: Jen wins a prize if at least 2 of her numbers are among the 4 drawn numbers. We calculate this by considering the complementary probability of not winning a prize, which happens if at most 1 of her numbers is among the drawn numbers.\n\n- Case 1 (0 of Jen's numbers are drawn): Choose 4 numbers from the 6 numbers not chosen by Jen. There are \\( \\binom{6}{4} = 15 \\) ways.\n- Case 2 (1 of Jen's numbers is drawn): Choose 1 of Jen's 4 numbers, and 3 from the remaining 6. There are \\( \\binom{4}{1} \\binom{6}{3} = 4 \\times 20 = 80 \\) ways.\n\nThe total number of ways to not win a prize is 15 + 80 = 95.\nThe number of ways to win a prize is 210 - 95 = 115.\n\n2. Probability of winning the grand prize given that she won a prize: Jen wins the grand prize if all 4 of her numbers are drawn. There is exactly 1 way for this to happen, as she must have chosen exactly the 4 numbers drawn.\n\nThe probability of winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is the ratio of the number of ways to win the grand prize to the number of ways to win a prize: \\( \\frac{1}{115} \\).\n\nThus, the probability is \\( \\frac{1}{115} \\), where \\( m = 1 \\) and \\( n = 115 \\). Therefore, \\( m+n = 1 + 115 = 116 \\).\n\nAnswer:116", prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
