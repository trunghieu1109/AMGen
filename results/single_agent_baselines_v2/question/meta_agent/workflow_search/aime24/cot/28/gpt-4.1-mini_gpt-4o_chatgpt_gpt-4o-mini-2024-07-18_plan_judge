Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: The torus T is formed by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis that is 6 units away from the center of the circle. This means the torus has a major radius R = 6 and a minor radius r = 3. The sphere S has radius 11. When the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, the major radius of the torus plus the sphere's radius equals the distance from the torus' center to the tangent point. This gives us two scenarios: when the torus is resting inside the sphere and when it is resting outside the sphere.

1. When T is inside S and externally tangent: The distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 11 - 3 = 8. The radius of the tangent circle r_i is the distance from the center of the torus to the tangent point, which is 6 - 8 = -2, but since it is a radius, take the positive value: r_i = 2.

2. When T is outside S and externally tangent: The distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 11 + 3 = 14. The radius of the tangent circle r_o is the distance from the center of the torus to the tangent point, which is 14 - 6 = 8.

The difference r_i - r_o = 2 - 8 = -6.

The difference is written as a fraction: -6/1, where m = -6 and n = 1. But the problem asks for m and n to be positive, so we take the positive difference: 6/1, where m = 6 and n = 1.

Thus, m + n = 6 + 1 = 7.
