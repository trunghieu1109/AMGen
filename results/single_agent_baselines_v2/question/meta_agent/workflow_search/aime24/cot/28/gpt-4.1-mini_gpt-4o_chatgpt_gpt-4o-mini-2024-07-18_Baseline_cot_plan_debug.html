    <pre>Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

Please think step by step and then solve the task.</pre>

    <pre>The torus T is formed by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis that is 6 units away from the center of the circle. This means the torus has a major radius R = 6 and a minor radius r = 3. The sphere S has radius 11. When the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, the major radius of the torus plus the sphere&#39;s radius equals the distance from the torus&#39; center to the tangent point. This gives us two scenarios: when the torus is resting inside the sphere and when it is resting outside the sphere.

1. When T is inside S and externally tangent: The distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 11 - 3 = 8. The radius of the tangent circle r_i is the distance from the center of the torus to the tangent point, which is 6 - 8 = -2, but since it is a radius, take the positive value: r_i = 2.

2. When T is outside S and externally tangent: The distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 11 + 3 = 14. The radius of the tangent circle r_o is the distance from the center of the torus to the tangent point, which is 14 - 6 = 8.

The difference r_i - r_o = 2 - 8 = -6.

The difference is written as a fraction: -6/1, where m = -6 and n = 1. But the problem asks for m and n to be positive, so we take the positive difference: 6/1, where m = 6 and n = 1.

Thus, m + n = 6 + 1 = 7.
