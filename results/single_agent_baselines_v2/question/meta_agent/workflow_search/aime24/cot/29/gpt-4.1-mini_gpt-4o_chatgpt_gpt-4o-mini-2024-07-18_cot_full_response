Question: There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\times5$ grid such that: 

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 6wB0', content='We need to place chips in a 5x5 grid such that each row and each column contains chips of the same color, and any additional chip would violate this condition. This means that for each row and each column, we either place all white chips or all black chips. Since there are 5 rows and 5 columns, we have to decide the color for each row and each column independently. The number of ways to choose the color for each row is 2 (white or black), and the same for each column. Therefore, there are 2^5 ways to color the rows and 2^5 ways to color the columns. However, if the color chosen for a row and a column is different, the intersection cell would be empty, which is allowed. Since we cannot add any more chips without violating the conditions, it means we must fill the grid as much as possible without violating the rules. Thus, the number of ways to place the chips is the product of the number of ways to choose the colors for the rows and the columns.\n\nAnswer:1024', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
