    <pre>To solve this problem, we need to count the number of paths from the lower left corner to the upper right corner of an 8x8 grid that change direction exactly four times. A path from the lower left to the upper right of an 8x8 grid consists of 8 right (R) moves and 8 up (U) moves, totaling 16 moves. A change in direction occurs whenever the path switches from R to U or from U to R. We want exactly 4 such changes. Consider the path as a sequence of horizontal and vertical segments. To have exactly 4 changes in direction, the path can be partitioned into 5 segments, alternating between R and U. There are two cases to consider: 1) The path starts with a horizontal segment: The sequence is R-U-R-U-R. 2) The path starts with a vertical segment: The sequence is U-R-U-R-U. In both cases, the number of segments is 5, and the total length of the path is 16. The sum of the lengths of all R segments must be 8, and the sum of the lengths of all U segments must be 8. Let&#39;s consider the first case: R-U-R-U-R. Let the lengths of the segments be a, b, c, d, e respectively. We have the equations a + c + e = 8 (for R moves) and b + d = 8 (for U moves). The number of nonnegative integer solutions to a + c + e = 8 is \( \binom{8+2}{2} = \binom{10}{2} = 45 \). Similarly, the number of nonnegative integer solutions to b + d = 8 is \( \binom{8+1}{1} = \binom{9}{1} = 9 \). Therefore, the number of paths for the first case is 45 * 9 = 405. Similarly, for the second case U-R-U-R-U, let the lengths of the segments be a, b, c, d, e respectively. We have b + d = 8 (for R moves) and a + c + e = 8 (for U moves). The number of solutions is the same as the first case: 9 * 45 = 405. Adding both cases, the total number of paths is 405 + 405 = 810.
