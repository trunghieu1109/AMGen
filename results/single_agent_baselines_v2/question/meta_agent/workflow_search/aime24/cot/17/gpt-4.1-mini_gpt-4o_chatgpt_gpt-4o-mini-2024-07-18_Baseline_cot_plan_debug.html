    <pre>We are given the equations a + b + c = 300 and a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000. We need to find the number of nonnegative integer triples (a, b, c) that satisfy these conditions.

First, let&#39;s consider the equation a + b + c = 300. This equation represents a plane in 3D space, and we are looking for integer solutions. The solutions are nonnegative integers, so we are looking for lattice points in the plane.

Next, let&#39;s analyze the second equation a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000. This equation is symmetric in a, b, and c, and it can be rewritten as sum of symmetric polynomials.

Notice that if one of the variables is 0, say c = 0, then the equation reduces to a^2b + b^2a = 6,000,000 with a + b = 300. This is simpler to analyze.

Let&#39;s try setting c = 0. Then we have a + b = 300 and a^2b + b^2a = 6,000,000. We can express b = 300 - a, so the equation becomes a^2(300 - a) + (300 - a)^2a = 6,000,000.

Simplifying, we get:
a^2(300 - a) + (300 - a)^2a = a^2(300 - a) + a(300 - 2a + a^2) = 6,000,000,
which simplifies to 300a^2 - a^3 = 6,000,000.

This is a cubic equation in a, and we need to find integer solutions for a.

Let&#39;s solve 300a^2 - a^3 = 6,000,000 for integer a:
Rearrange to a^3 - 300a^2 + 6,000,000 = 0.

By trial and error or using a numerical method, we find that a = 200 is a solution.

If a = 200, then b = 300 - 200 = 100, and c = 0.

Now let&#39;s check if there are other solutions:

If we set a = 0, then:
b + c = 300 and b^2c + c^2b = 6,000,000.

This is similar to the previous case, and we can check if b = 200, c = 100 works.

If a = 100, b = 200, c = 0, it also works.

By symmetry, the solutions are permutations of (200, 100, 0).

Thus, the solutions are (200, 100, 0), (100, 200, 0), and (0, 200, 100).

Each of these solutions is unique because of the distinct values.

Therefore, there are 3 solutions in total.
