Question: Let $p$ be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $n^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$. Find the least positive integer $m$ such that $m^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$.

proposed answer: We need to find the smallest prime number \( p \) such that there exists a positive integer \( n \) where \( p^2 \mid n^4 + 1 \). This means \( n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{p^2} \). For a prime \( p \), if \( n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{p} \), then \( n^8 \equiv 1 \pmod{p} \), implying the order of \( n \) modulo \( p \) is 8. Therefore, 8 must divide \( p-1 \), meaning \( p \equiv 1 \pmod{8} \). The smallest prime satisfying this condition is \( p = 17 \). Now, we need to find the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( 17^2 \mid m^4 + 1 \). We test small values of \( m \) to find the smallest one satisfying this condition. Trying \( m = 1, 2, \ldots \) and checking divisibility, we find that \( m = 6 \) is the smallest integer for which \( 17^2 \mid m^4 + 1 \).
