Question: Find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon ($12$-gon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The diagram below shows three of those rectangles.

proposed answer: To find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon, we must consider that each rectangle is determined by choosing two horizontal and two vertical lines from the vertices and diagonals of the dodecagon. A regular dodecagon has 12 vertices. If we label these vertices as 0, 1, 2, ..., 11, we can choose two pairs of opposite sides or diagonals to form a rectangle. For a regular dodecagon, the vertices are evenly spaced on a circle, and we can think of diagonals as lines connecting vertices that are not adjacent. To form a rectangle, we need to choose two pairs of opposite vertices. The number of ways to choose 2 pairs of opposite vertices is the same as choosing 2 pairs of opposite sides of the dodecagon. There are 6 pairs of opposite sides in a dodecagon, and we choose 2 pairs to form a rectangle. The number of ways to choose 2 pairs from 6 is given by the combination formula \( \binom{6}{2} = 15 \). Therefore, there are 15 rectangles that can be formed.
