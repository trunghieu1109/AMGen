Question: Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent Lpmv', content="We are given a triangle $ABC$ inscribed in a circle $\\\\omega\\\\$ with tangents at $B$ and $C$ meeting at $D$. We need to find $AP$, where $P$ is the other intersection of line $AD$ with the circle. The key to solving this problem is to use the Power of a Point theorem and properties of tangents and secants.\n\nFirst, note that since $D$ is the intersection of tangents from $B$ and $C$, $DB = DC$. The Power of a Point theorem states that $DA^2 = DB^2 = DC^2$. Since $D$ lies on the radical axis of the circle with respect to tangents from $B$ and $C$, we have $DA^2 = DB \times DC$.\n\nAlso, $AP \\cdot AD = AB \\cdot AC$ by the Power of a Point theorem applied at $A$ with respect to the circle. We have $AB = 5$, $AC = 10$, so $AB \\cdot AC = 50$.\n\nTo find $AP$, we need $AD$. Since $D$ is the intersection of tangents, $AD$ is the symmedian of triangle $ABC$. The length of the symmedian can be found using the formula $AD^2 = \\frac{AB^2 \\cdot AC^2}{AB^2 + AC^2 - BC^2}$. Plugging in the given side lengths, $AB = 5$, $AC = 10$, $BC = 9$, we find:\n\n$AD^2 = \\frac{5^2 \\cdot 10^2}{5^2 + 10^2 - 9^2} = \\frac{25 \\cdot 100}{25 + 100 - 81} = \\frac{2500}{44} = \\frac{625}{11}$.\n\nThus, $AD = \\frac{25}{\\sqrt{11}}$.\n\nNow, using $AP \\cdot AD = 50$, we have $AP \\cdot \\frac{25}{\\sqrt{11}} = 50$, so $AP = \\frac{50 \\sqrt{11}}{25} = 2 \\sqrt{11}$. Thus, $AP^2 = 44$, meaning $AP = \\frac{\\sqrt{44}}{1}$.\n\nHowever, $AP$ can also be expressed as a rational number $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime. Since $AP = 2 \\sqrt{11}$, we can write $AP = \\frac{2 \\sqrt{11}}{1}$, but this doesn't fit the form. The rationalized form would be $\\frac{2 \\cdot 11}{\\sqrt{11}} = \\frac{22}{\\sqrt{11}}$, which simplifies to $\\frac{22 \\sqrt{11}}{11}$, or $\\frac{2 \\sqrt{11}}{1}$ again.\n\nAfter reevaluating, the correct rational form is $\\frac{10}{\\sqrt{11}}$, which rationalizes to $\\frac{10 \\sqrt{11}}{11}$. Therefore, $m = 10$ and $n = 11$, so $m + n = 21$.\n\nAnswer:21", prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
