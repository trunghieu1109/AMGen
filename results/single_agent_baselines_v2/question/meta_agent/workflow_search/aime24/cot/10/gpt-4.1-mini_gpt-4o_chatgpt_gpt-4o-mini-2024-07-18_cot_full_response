Question: Rectangles $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are drawn such that $D,E,C,F$ are collinear. Also, $A,D,H,G$ all lie on a circle. If $BC=16$,$AB=107$,$FG=17$, and $EF=184$, what is the length of $CE$?\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 3Q7i', content='We are given two rectangles ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear, and A, D, H, G are concyclic. We need to find the length of CE. Since D, E, C, F are collinear, CE is the segment between points C and E on the line. The rectangles are such that BC is parallel to AD, and FG is parallel to EH. Given the lengths BC = 16 and FG = 17, we can deduce that CE is the sum of these lengths, as D, E, C, F are collinear and BC and FG lie along the same line in the same direction.\n\nAnswer:33', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
