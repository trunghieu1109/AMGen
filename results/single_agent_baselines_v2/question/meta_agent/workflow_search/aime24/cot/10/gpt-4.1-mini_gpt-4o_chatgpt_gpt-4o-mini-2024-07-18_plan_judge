Question: Rectangles $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are drawn such that $D,E,C,F$ are collinear. Also, $A,D,H,G$ all lie on a circle. If $BC=16$,$AB=107$,$FG=17$, and $EF=184$, what is the length of $CE$?
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: We are given two rectangles ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear, and A, D, H, G are concyclic. We need to find the length of CE. Since D, E, C, F are collinear, CE is the segment between points C and E on the line. The rectangles are such that BC is parallel to AD, and FG is parallel to EH. Given the lengths BC = 16 and FG = 17, we can deduce that CE is the sum of these lengths, as D, E, C, F are collinear and BC and FG lie along the same line in the same direction.
