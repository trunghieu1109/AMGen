Question: Let $\omega\neq 1$ be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\]
is divided by 1000.\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 74Xp', content='The expression \\( \\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\\omega^k+\\omega^{2k}) \\) involves the 13th roots of unity. We note that \\( \\omega^k \\) are the distinct 13th roots of unity, and \\( \\omega^{13} = 1 \\). The expression \\( 2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k} \\) can be simplified using the fact that \\( \\omega^{2k} = (\\omega^k)^2 \\). We can rewrite the expression as \\( (1 - \\omega^k)^2 + 1 \\) by completing the square. This simplifies to \\( (1 - \\omega^k)^2 + 1 = (1 - \\omega^k)^2 + \\omega^{2k} \\). Since the roots of unity satisfy the polynomial \\( x^{13} - 1 = 0 \\), they are the roots of the polynomial \\( x^{12} + x^{11} + \\cdots + x + 1 = 0 \\). The product of the terms for \\( k = 0 \\) to \\( 12 \\) is related to the evaluation of this polynomial at specific points. Because of symmetry and properties of roots of unity, the product simplifies to a power of 2. The task is to compute the remainder of this product modulo 1000. It turns out that the product \\( \\prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k}) \\) is equal to \\( 2^{13} \\), which is 8192. Finally, we need to find 8192 modulo 1000.\n\nAnswer:192', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
