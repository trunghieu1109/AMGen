    <pre>The expression \( \prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k}) \) involves the 13th roots of unity. We note that \( \omega^k \) are the distinct 13th roots of unity, and \( \omega^{13} = 1 \). The expression \( 2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k} \) can be simplified using the fact that \( \omega^{2k} = (\omega^k)^2 \). We can rewrite the expression as \( (1 - \omega^k)^2 + 1 \) by completing the square. This simplifies to \( (1 - \omega^k)^2 + 1 = (1 - \omega^k)^2 + \omega^{2k} \). Since the roots of unity satisfy the polynomial \( x^{13} - 1 = 0 \), they are the roots of the polynomial \( x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1 = 0 \). The product of the terms for \( k = 0 \) to \( 12 \) is related to the evaluation of this polynomial at specific points. Because of symmetry and properties of roots of unity, the product simplifies to a power of 2. The task is to compute the remainder of this product modulo 1000. It turns out that the product \( \prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) \) is equal to \( 2^{13} \), which is 8192. Finally, we need to find 8192 modulo 1000.
