    <pre>We are given that 8 circles of radius 34 are sequentially tangent and 2 of them are tangent to sides AB and BC of triangle ABC. Similarly, 2024 circles of radius 1 can be arranged in the same manner. We need to find the inradius of triangle ABC.

First, consider the case with circles of radius 34. The diameter of each circle is 68, so the total length covered by the 8 circles is 8 * 68 = 544.

Now consider the case with circles of radius 1. The diameter of each circle is 2, so the total length covered by the 2024 circles is 2024 * 2 = 4048.

Since both arrangements fit in the same manner, the lengths must be proportional to the inradius of triangle ABC. The inradius r is the same for both configurations.

The ratio of the total lengths is 4048 / 544 = 7.4444, which simplifies to 2024/272.

The inradius of the triangle is proportional to the number of circles. Thus, the inradius can be expressed as the ratio of the number of circles times the radius of the circles divided by the total number of circles, which is:

r = (8 * 34) / (2024 * 1) = 272 / 2024 = 1/7.4444 = 34/272 = 1/8.

However, this seems incorrect, as the ratio should be simplified further. Let&#39;s try another approach.

The correct approach is to consider the number of circles and their arrangement.

The inradius is proportional to the number of circles times the radius of the circles, divided by the total number of circles. The number of circles is 8 and 2024, respectively.

Now, consider the inradius of the triangle. The inradius is proportional to the number of circles times the radius of the circles divided by the total number of circles:

r = (8 * 34) / (2024 * 1) = 272 / 2024 = 1/7.4444 = 1/8.

This simplifies to 1/8.

Therefore, the inradius of the triangle is 1/8.

The inradius of the triangle can be expressed as 1/8, where m = 1 and n = 8.

The sum of m and n is 1 + 8 = 9.
