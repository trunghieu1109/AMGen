    <pre>Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.

Please think step by step and then solve the task.</pre>

    <pre>Let&#39;s break down the problem step by step. We know that when Aya walks at a speed of s km/h, the total time is 4 hours, including t minutes at the coffee shop. This means the walking time is 4 hours minus t minutes. Since she walks 9 km, we have the equation 9/s = 4 - t/60.

Similarly, when she walks at s+2 km/h, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, including t minutes at the coffee shop. This means the walking time is 2 hours and 24 minutes minus t minutes. In hours, 2 hours and 24 minutes is 2 + 24/60 = 2.4 hours. So, 9/(s+2) = 2.4 - t/60.

We have two equations:
1. 9/s = 4 - t/60
2. 9/(s+2) = 2.4 - t/60

We can set the right sides equal to each other:
4 - t/60 = 2.4 - t/60

This simplifies to:
9/s = 9/(s+2) + 1.6

Let&#39;s solve for s:
9/s = 9/(s+2) + 1.6

Multiply through by s(s+2) to clear the fractions:
9(s+2) = 9s + 1.6s(s+2)

Expanding gives:
9s + 18 = 9s + 1.6s^2 + 3.2s

The 9s terms cancel out:
18 = 1.6s^2 + 3.2s

Divide through by 1.6:
s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0

Solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:
s = [-2 ± sqrt((2)^2 - 4*1*(-11.25))]/(2*1)
s = [-2 ± sqrt(4 + 45)]/2

s = [-2 ± sqrt(49)]/2

s = [-2 ± 7]/2

The two solutions are:
s = 2.5 or s = -4.5

Since speed cannot be negative, s = 2.5 km/h.

Now, if Aya walks at s + 0.5 km/h, that is 2.5 + 0.5 = 3 km/h.

The walking time for 9 km at 3 km/h is 9/3 = 3 hours.

Including the t minutes spent at the coffee shop, the total time is 3 hours + t minutes.

Since we know from the first scenario that 9/s = 4 - t/60, we can find t:
9/2.5 = 4 - t/60
3.6 = 4 - t/60
t/60 = 4 - 3.6
t/60 = 0.4
t = 0.4 * 60
t = 24 minutes

So if she walks at 3 km/h, the total time is 3 hours + 24 minutes = 3 hours and 24 minutes.

Convert this to minutes: 3 hours and 24 minutes is 3*60 + 24 = 204 minutes.
