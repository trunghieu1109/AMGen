    <pre>Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.

    <pre>We need to find the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box with a given surface area and volume. We start by considering a rectangular box with dimensions x, y, and z. The surface area is given by 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54, and the volume is x * y * z = 23. To fit the box inside a sphere, we must consider the box&#39;s largest diagonal, which is sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2). We aim to minimize this diagonal to find the smallest sphere. Using the surface area and volume constraints, we express one variable in terms of the others and substitute back into the expression for the diagonal. After simplification, we find the minimum value of x^2 + y^2 + z^2, which gives us the radius of the sphere. Finally, we express r^2 as a fraction and ensure it is in simplest form.
