    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Two stars are being studied. It has been observed that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2. In fact, the energy difference between the considered energy levels was determined to be approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J. Assuming that the stellar photospheres are in LTE, which of these equations for the effective temperatures of the stars (T_1 and T_2) is correct?&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]\n&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]\n&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent CSzE:
Under LTE, the fraction of atoms in the excited level is proportional to exp(–ΔE∕(kT)). The ratio of the excitation fractions for the two stars is

 f1∕f2 = exp[–ΔE∕(kT1)] ∕ exp[–ΔE∕(kT2)] = exp[ΔE∕k·(1∕T2–1∕T1)] = 2.

Taking the natural log gives ln2 = (ΔE∕k)·(1∕T2 – 1∕T1). Dividing both sides by ΔE∕k (or absorbing it into units) yields

 ln2 = (1∕T2 – 1∕T1) = (T1 – T2)∕(T1·T2),

which matches choice 4.

### thinking by Debate Agent bTcQ:
Under LTE, the excitation fraction ∝exp(−ΔE/(kT)). So f1/f2=exp[ΔE/k(1/T2−1/T1)]=2 ⇒ ln2=ΔE/k·(1/T2−1/T1)=ΔE/k·(T1−T2)/(T1T2). Omitting the constant factor ΔE/k (common to all choices), the matching form is ln2=(T1−T2)/(T1T2).

### thinking by Debate Agent KWrQ:
Under LTE, the population ratio of an excited level to the ground state is ∝exp(−ΔE/kT). For the same transitions in two stars, the ratio of excited‐state fractions is:

(N_exc1/N_exc2) = exp(−ΔE/kT1)/exp(−ΔE/kT2) = exp[ΔE/k·(1/T2 − 1/T1)].

Given this ratio is 2, take ln on both sides:
ln2 = (ΔE/k)·(1/T2 − 1/T1).

With ΔE=1.38×10^−23 J and k=1.38×10^−23 J/K, ΔE/k=1, so:
ln2 = (1/T2 − 1/T1) = (T1 − T2)/(T1·T2),
which matches choice 4.

### thinking by Debate Agent mGv8:
We compare the Boltzmann factors for the excited level in LTE: n_ex/n_tot ∝ exp(−ΔE/(kT)). The ratio of fractions between star1 and star2 is 2, so exp[−ΔE/(kT1)]/exp[−ΔE/(kT2)] = 2 ⇒ exp[(ΔE/k)(1/T2 − 1/T1)] = 2 ⇒ ln 2 = (ΔE/k)(1/T2 − 1/T1). Since 1/T2 − 1/T1 = (T1 − T2)/(T1 T2), the correct form (omitting constants) is ln 2 = (T1 − T2)/(T1 T2), which is choice D.

    <pre>Under LTE, the excited‐state populations follow Boltzmann factors: f∝exp(−ΔE/(kT)). The observed ratio f1/f2=2 gives 2=exp[ΔE/k(1/T2−1/T1)], so ln 2=(ΔE/k)(1/T2−1/T1). With ΔE/k=1, this becomes ln 2=(T1−T2)/(T1 T2), matching choice D.
