The distribution coefficient α2 = β2[L]2/(1+β1[L]+β2[L]2+β3[L]3+β4[L]4). Approximating free thiocyanate [L]≈0.1 M gives β1L=0.9, β2L2=0.4, β3L3≈0.063, β4L4≈0.0016, sum=2.3646. Hence α2=0.4/2.3646≈0.169 →16.9%.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent eJow:\nWe have Co2+ and SCN– with total Co 0.01 M and constant free [SCN–]=0.1 M. Complex formation follows cumulative stability constants βn=[Co(SCN)n]/([Co2+][SCN–]n). The fraction of the dithiocyanato complex Co(SCN)2 is α2=β2[SCN–]2/Σn=0→4 βn[SCN–]n, where β0=1. Calculate: β1[SCN–]=9·0.1=0.9; β2[SCN–]2=40·0.01=0.4; β3[SCN–]3=63·0.001=0.063; β4[SCN–]4=16·0.0001=0.0016. Sum D=1+0.9+0.4+0.063+0.0016=2.3646. Thus fraction=0.4/2.3646≈0.1692 or 16.92%.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent xVo6:\nWe need the fraction of Co(SCN)2 among all Co species. The fractions αn = βn[SCN]^n / (1 + Σ βk[SCN]^k). Given [SCN]=0.1 M and β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16, compute: β1[SCN]=0.9, β2[SCN]^2=0.4, β3[SCN]^3=0.063, β4[SCN]^4=0.0016. Denominator = 1 +0.9+0.4+0.063+0.0016 = 2.3646. Fraction of Co(SCN)2 = 0.4/2.3646 ≈ 0.1692 =16.92%.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent UD2w:\nWe have Co2+ plus SCN– forms complexes CoSCN+, Co(SCN)2, Co(SCN)3–, Co(SCN)4^2– with overall stability constants β1…β4. Given c(Co)total=1×10–2 M and [SCN–]=0.1 M, the mass balance is:\n[Co]total=[Co2+]·(1+β1[SCN]+β2[SCN]^2+β3[SCN]^3+β4[SCN]^4)\nCalculate coefficients at [SCN]=0.1:\nβ1[SCN]=9×0.1=0.9\nβ2[SCN]^2=40×0.01=0.4\nβ3[SCN]^3=63×0.001=0.063\nβ4[SCN]^4=16×0.0001=0.0016\nSum=1+0.9+0.4+0.063+0.0016=2.3646\nSo free [Co2+]=0.01/2.3646≈0.004228 M\nConcentration of dithiocyanato complex Co(SCN)2 = β2[Co2+][SCN]^2 =40×0.004228×0.01≈0.0016912 M\nPercentage =0.0016912/0.01×100%≈16.9%\n\n### answer by Debate Agent E6Fv:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent eJow:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent xVo6:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent UD2w:\nA)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
