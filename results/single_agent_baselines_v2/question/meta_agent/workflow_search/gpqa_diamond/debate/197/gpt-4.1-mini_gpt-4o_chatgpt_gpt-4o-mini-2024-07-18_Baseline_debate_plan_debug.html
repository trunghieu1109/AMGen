    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;We have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate, where the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M and the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16. What will be the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species in the solution? &#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;16.9%&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;42.3%&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;25.6%&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;38.1%&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent E6Fv:
To solve this, we need to calculate the concentration of the Co(SCN)2 complex and compare it to the total cobalt concentration. The stability constants (β) describe the equilibrium of complex formation. Using β2, we calculate the concentration of Co(SCN)2. First, we find the ratio of Co(SCN)2 concentration to the total cobalt concentration to determine its percentage. Given [Co] = 10^-2 M and [SCN-] = 0.1 M, the concentration of Co(SCN)2 is found using β2 = 40, where Co(SCN)2 = β2 * [Co][SCN-]^2. Then, the percentage is calculated as (Co(SCN)2 concentration / total Co concentration) * 100.

To find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, Co(SCN)2, we need to consider the stability constants for the formation of Co(SCN)+, Co(SCN)2, Co(SCN)3-, and Co(SCN)4-. The stability constants are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The total concentration of cobalt is c(Co) = 10^-2 M and [SCN-] = 0.1 M. The equilibrium concentrations of the complexes can be calculated using these stability constants and the known concentrations of cobalt and thiocyanate. The percentage of the dithiocyanato complex is given by the concentration of Co(SCN)2 divided by the total concentration of all cobalt species, multiplied by 100%. We sum up the concentrations of all cobalt species using the stability constants and calculate the percentage of Co(SCN)2.

### thinking by Debate Agent xVo6:
To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes (Co(SCN)2) among all cobalt-containing species, we need to calculate the concentration of each cobalt-thiocyanate complex using the given stability constants. The stability constants β1, β2, β3, and β4 correspond to the formation of Co(SCN)+, Co(SCN)2, Co(SCN)3-, and Co(SCN)4-2, respectively. Given the total cobalt concentration and thiocyanate concentration, we can set up equilibrium expressions for each complex and solve for their concentrations. The percentage of Co(SCN)2 is then calculated by dividing its concentration by the total cobalt concentration and multiplying by 100.

### thinking by Debate Agent UD2w:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the concentration of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, Co(SCN)2, and compare it to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species. The stability constants (β) are given for the formation of these complexes: 
1. Co + SCN- -&gt; Co(SCN) with β1 = 9 
2. Co + 2SCN- -&gt; Co(SCN)2 with β2 = 40 
3. Co + 3SCN- -&gt; Co(SCN)3 with β3 = 63 
4. Co + 4SCN- -&gt; Co(SCN)4 with β4 = 16 

The total concentration of cobalt is 0.01 M and [SCN-] = 0.1 M. We need to find the concentration of Co(SCN)2. 

The fraction of Co(SCN)2 can be calculated using the formula: 

fraction = [Co(SCN)2] / ([Co] + [CoSCN] + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3] + [Co(SCN)4]) 

Using the stability constants, we have: 

[Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co] * [SCN-]^2 

To find the concentration of each species, we use the equilibrium expressions and substitute into the fraction formula. After calculation, the percentage of Co(SCN)2 is found to be closest to 42.3%.
