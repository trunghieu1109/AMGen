Question: Example(question='We have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate, where the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M and the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16. What will be the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species in the solution? ', choice1='16.9%', choice2='42.3%', choice3='25.6%', choice4='38.1%', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, Co(SCN)2, among all cobalt-containing species, we need to calculate the concentration of each cobalt-thiocyanate complex using the given stability constants. The stability constants β1, β2, β3, and β4 correspond to the formation of Co(SCN)+, Co(SCN)2, Co(SCN)3-, and Co(SCN)4-2, respectively. Given the total cobalt concentration and thiocyanate concentration, we can set up equilibrium expressions for each complex and solve for their concentrations. The percentage of Co(SCN)2 is then calculated by dividing its concentration by the total cobalt concentration and multiplying by 100. After considering the stability constants and the concentrations, the percentage of Co(SCN)2 is closest to 38.1%.
