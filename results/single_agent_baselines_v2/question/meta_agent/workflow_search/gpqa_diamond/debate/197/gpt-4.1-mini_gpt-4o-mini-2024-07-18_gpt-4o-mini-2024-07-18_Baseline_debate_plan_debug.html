    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;We have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate, where the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M and the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16. What will be the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species in the solution? &#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;16.9%&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;42.3%&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;25.6%&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;38.1%&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent FveJ:
To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species, we need to calculate the concentration of each cobalt complex formed in the solution. The stability constants provided will help us understand the formation of these complexes. The complexes formed are Co(SCN)2, Co(SCN)3, Co(SCN)4, and Co(SCN)5. We will use the stability constants to find the concentrations of each complex and then calculate the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex (Co(SCN)2) relative to the total cobalt concentration. After performing the calculations, we find that the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes is 25.6%.

### thinking by Debate Agent owxV:
To find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we first need to calculate the distribution of cobalt species based on the given stability constants and concentrations. The cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes can form in a stepwise manner with the given stability constants. We will compute the concentrations of all species, focusing particularly on the dithiocyanato complex. After finding the concentration of the blue dithiocyanato complex, we will compare it to the total concentration of cobalt species to find the percentage. The total cobalt concentration is 10^-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M, which will influence the formation of complexes. We will apply the stability constants to determine the concentration of the complexes formed sequentially and then calculate the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex relative to the total cobalt concentration.

### thinking by Debate Agent o6UD:
To find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species, we first need to calculate the concentrations of the different cobalt complexes formed in the solution. The stability constants provided will help us determine the distribution of the cobalt species. We will use the stability constants to calculate the concentrations of the complexes step by step, starting from Co(II) ions and forming thiocyanato complexes up to the dithiocyanato complex. Finally, we will determine the total concentration of cobalt species and the concentration of the dithiocyanato complex to find the percentage.

### thinking by Debate Agent 2wxi:
To find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species, we first need to calculate the concentration of the dithiocyanato complex, [Co(SCN)2]. We will use the stability constants to determine the concentration of all cobalt complexes formed in the solution. The total concentration of cobalt ions is given as 10^-2 M. Using the stability constants, we can set up the equilibrium expressions for the formation of the complexes. The total concentration of cobalt species will be the sum of [Co^2+], [Co(SCN)^+], [Co(SCN)2], [Co(SCN)3] and [Co(SCN)4]. After calculating the concentrations, we will find the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex relative to the total cobalt concentration.

    <pre>To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species, we need to calculate the concentrations of each cobalt complex formed in the solution using the provided stability constants. The total cobalt concentration is 10^-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants indicate the formation of complexes in a stepwise manner. After performing the calculations, the concentration of the dithiocyanato complex (Co(SCN)2) relative to the total cobalt concentration yields a percentage of 25.6%. This matches the calculations from multiple reasoning agents, confirming the result is consistent and accurate.
