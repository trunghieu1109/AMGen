Question: Example(question='The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1). An observable of the system is represented by the matrix operator P having elements in the first row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0),  in the second row as (1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}) and in the third row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0). Calculate the probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 at time t.', choice1='1/3\n', choice2='2/3\n', choice3='\\sqrt{2/3}\n', choice4='1', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: We have |ψ⟩=(–1,2,1). Compute its norm² =6. The observable P has eigenvalues ±1,0; its 0‐eigenvector solves P v=0 ⇒ v∝(1,0,−1), normalized to v₀=(1,0,−1)/√2. The probability to measure 0 is |⟨v₀|ψ⟩|²/⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = [((1/√2)(−1)+(−1/√2)(1))²]/6 = (−√2)²/6 =2/6=1/3.
