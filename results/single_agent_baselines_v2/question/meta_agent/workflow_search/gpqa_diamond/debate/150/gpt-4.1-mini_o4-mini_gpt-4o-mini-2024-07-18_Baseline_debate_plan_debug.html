### thinking by Debate Agent j36X:
We have state |ψ⟩=(–1,2,1) (unnormalized) and measurement operator P with eigenvalues ±1,0. The probability of outcome λ is ⟨ψ|P_λ|ψ⟩/⟨ψ|ψ⟩ where P_0 projects onto the eigenspace of eigenvalue 0. Solve P v=0: we get v∝(1,0,−1), normalized u=(1,0,−1)/√2. Then P_0=uu^T. Compute ⟨ψ|P_0|ψ⟩ =|(u·ψ)|^2 = ( (1/√2)(–1)+(–1/√2)(1) )^2 = (–√2)^2=2. Norm ⟨ψ|ψ⟩=6, so probability=2/6=1/3.

### thinking by Debate Agent tpUs:
We have state |ψ⟩ with components (–1,2,1). The operator P given has matrix elements off‐diagonal =1/√2 and zeros on diagonal. This is the adjacency matrix of a 3‐site chain scaled by 1/√2, whose eigenvalues are +1,0,–1. The zero‐eigenvalue eigenvector is v ∝(1,0,–1). Normalize v: v=(1,0,–1)/√2. The probability to measure eigenvalue 0 is |⟨v|ψ⟩|^2/⟨ψ|ψ⟩. Compute ⟨v|ψ⟩=(1/√2)(-1) +0⋅2 +(-1/√2)⋅1 = -2/√2 = -√2. Square gives 2. Norm of ψ squared is (-1)^2+2^2+1^2=6. Hence probability =2/6=1/3.

### thinking by Debate Agent Acib:
We have a quantum state ψ = (−1,2,1)ᵀ which we first normalize: ||ψ|| = √6, so ψ_norm = (−1,2,1)/√6. The observable P has matrix
[0       1/√2    0;
 1/√2    0     1/√2;
 0       1/√2   0].
We find its eigenvalue 0 by solving P v = 0. This gives v2=0 and v1 + v3 = 0, so an eigenvector v = (1,0,−1), normalized to e₀ = (1,0,−1)/√2. The probability of measuring 0 is |⟨e₀|ψ_norm⟩|². Compute ⟨e₀|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√2)(1,0,−1)·(−1,2,1)/√6 = (1/√12)(−1 − 1) = −2/√12 = −1/√3. Squaring gives 1/3.

### thinking by Debate Agent eeAI:
First normalize the state |ψ⟩ = (−1,2,1)/√6. The observable P has eigenvalues 1, 0, −1. The 0‐eigenvector satisfies P v=0 ⇒ y=0, z=−x ⇒ v0∝(1,0,−1)/√2. The probability of measuring 0 is |⟨v0|ψ⟩|^2 = [ (1/√2,0,−1/√2)·(−1,2,1)/√6 ]^2 = (−1/√3)^2 = 1/3.
