Question: Example(question='Astronomers are studying two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2. Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.', choice1='~ 0.4', choice2='~ 0.7', choice3='~ 0.6\n', choice4='~ 1.2', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To determine the mass ratio of the two binary star systems, we can use the relationship between the mass of the stars and their radial velocity amplitudes in binary systems. The total mass of a binary star system can be derived from Kepler's laws and the radial velocity amplitudes of the stars. For system_1, the total mass M1 is proportional to the sum of the amplitudes of the radial velocities (10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s). For system_2, the total mass M2 is proportional to the sum of the amplitudes of the radial velocities (15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s). We can express the mass ratio M1/M2 = (15 km/s) / (25 km/s) = 0.6. Therefore, system_1 is approximately 0.6 times the mass of system_2, indicating that system_1 is less massive than system_2 by a factor of about 0.6.

Answer:The factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2 is approximately 0.6.
