Question: Example(question='Astronomers are studying two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2. Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.', choice1='~ 0.4', choice2='~ 0.7', choice3='~ 0.6\n', choice4='~ 1.2', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To determine the mass ratio between the two binary systems, we use the relationship between the radial velocity amplitudes and the periods of the systems. The mass function for a binary system is proportional to (K1 + K2)^3 / P, where K1 and K2 are the radial velocity amplitudes and P is the period. For system_1, the period is 2 years and the radial velocity amplitudes are 10 km/s and 5 km/s, giving a mass function proportional to (10 + 5)^3 / 2 = 3375 / 2 = 1687.5. For system_2, the period is 1 year and the radial velocity amplitudes are 15 km/s and 10 km/s, giving a mass function proportional to (15 + 10)^3 / 1 = 3375. The factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2 is the ratio of these two mass functions: 1687.5 / 3375 â‰ˆ 0.5. This suggests that system_1 is approximately 0.5 times as massive as system_2, which aligns closely with choice ~ 0.4.
