For an eclipsing binary, sin i ≈ 1. Total mass M_tot = (P (K1+K2)^3) / (2πG) up to constants that cancel in the ratio. So M1/M2 = (P1 (K1_1+K2_1)^3)/(P2 (K1_2+K2_2)^3). Plug in P1=2\u2009yr, K1+K2=15\u2009km/s; P2=1\u2009yr, K1+K2=25\u2009km/s. The ratio is (2*15^3)/(1*25^3)= (2*3375)/15625=6750/15625≈0.432≈0.4. Thus choice A).\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent TOTF:\nFor an eclipsing binary seen edge‐on (i≈90°), the total mass M ∝ P⋅(K1+K2)^3. Thus M1/M2 = [P1*(K1_1+K2_1)^3]/[P2*(K1_2+K2_2)^3] = 2*(15^3)/(25^3) = 2*3375/15625 = 6750/15625 ≈ 0.432 ≈ 0.4.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent 1hOh:\nFor a double‐lined eclipsing binary with circular orbits and inclination ≃90°, the total mass M∝P(K1+K2)^3. System_1: P1=2\u2009yr, K1+K2=10+5=15\u2009km/s → M1∝2×15^3=2×3375=6750. System_2: P2=1\u2009yr, K1+K2=15+10=25\u2009km/s → M2∝1×25^3=15625. The mass ratio M1/M2=6750/15625≈0.432. This corresponds to ~0.4.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent TwPR:\nWe want the total mass of each binary: M_total ∝ P (K1+K2)^3 for circular orbits and sin\u2009i≈1. For system_1: P1=2\u2009yr, K_sum1=10+5=15\u2009km/s → M1∝2×15^3=2×3375=6750. For system_2: P2=1\u2009yr, K_sum2=15+10=25\u2009km/s → M2∝1×25^3=15625. Ratio M1/M2=6750/15625≈0.432≈0.4.
