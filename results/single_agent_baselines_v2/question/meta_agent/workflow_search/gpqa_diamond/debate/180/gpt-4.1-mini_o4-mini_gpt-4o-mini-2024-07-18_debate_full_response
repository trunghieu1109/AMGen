Using typical solar fluxes (ϕ7Be≈4.8×10^9 cm−2 s−1; ϕ13N≈2.96×10^8, ϕ15O≈2.23×10^8) and integrating their β spectra over 700–800 and 800–900 keV gives band 1 ≈8.3×10^7 cm−2 s−1 and band 2 ≈4.85×10^9 cm−2 s−1. The ratio is ≈0.017 ≈10^−2.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent 3IcK:\nStopping the pp-III branch removes essentially all 8B neutrinos after the 8.5 min travel time. In the 700–800 keV band only small CNO neutrino continua contribute (~2×10^7 cm^–2 s^–1), while in the 800–900 keV band the dominant 7Be line remains (~5×10^9 cm^–2 s^–1) plus tiny CNO additions. Thus the new flux ratio ≃2×10^7/5×10^9≈4×10^–3, closest to 10^–2.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent NcUY:\nStopping the pp–III branch (⁸B neutrinos) removes the only source of neutrinos in the 700–800 keV band and also the continuous background in 800–900 keV.  The only remaining contributors around these energies are CNO neutrinos (total ∼4×10⁸ cm⁻² s⁻¹, roughly flat over ∼1 MeV) and the ⁷Be line at 861 keV (∼4.8×10⁹ cm⁻² s⁻¹).  Band 1 (700–800 keV) gets only CNO: ≈4×10⁷; Band 2 (800–900 keV) gets CNO plus the ⁷Be line: ≈4.8×10⁹.  Ratio ≈4×10⁷/4.8×10⁹≈8×10⁻³ ≈10⁻².\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent eOCo:\nNeutrino sources in these bands: 700–800 keV sees only continuous CNO (13N+15O) and halted B8 (pp-III) which is now zero; 800–900 keV sees the monoenergetic 862 keV Be7 line (pp-II) plus negligible CNO. After stopping pp-III 8.5 min ago (neutrino travel time), B8 flux drops to zero. CNO continuous in 100 keV bin ~ few×10^7/cm2/s, Be7 line ~5×10^9/cm2/s. Ratio F(700–800)/F(800–900) ≃3×10^7/5×10^9≈0.007≈0.01.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent q69j:\nD)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 3IcK:\nD)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent NcUY:\nD)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent eOCo:\nD\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
