Question: Example(question='Consider an oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis). Because it oscillates, it would radiate at a wavelength \\lambda. In the radiation zone, the radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of \\lambda and the angle \\theta (with z-axis), along which the power is measured. If the maximum power thus radiated is A, the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle \\theta = 30^0 and a possible form of f are, respectively,', choice1='1/2, \\lambda^(-4)', choice2='3/4, \\lambda^(-6)', choice3='1/4, \\lambda^(-4)', choice4='1/4, \\lambda^(-3)', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: An oscillating spheroidal charge distribution has no changing dipole moment; the leading radiation is quadrupole. Quadrupole power per solid angle ∝ω^6 (so ∝λ^−6) and angular pattern ∝sin^2θ cos^2θ, peaking at θ=45° (value 1/4). At θ=30°, sin^2(30°) cos^2(30°)=(1/2)^2·(√3/2)^2=3/16, so the fraction of the peak is (3/16)/(1/4)=3/4.
