    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Consider an oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis). Because it oscillates, it would radiate at a wavelength \\lambda. In the radiation zone, the radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of \\lambda and the angle \\theta (with z-axis), along which the power is measured. If the maximum power thus radiated is A, the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle \\theta = 30^0 and a possible form of f are, respectively,&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;1/2, \\lambda^(-4)&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;3/4, \\lambda^(-6)&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;1/4, \\lambda^(-4)&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;1/4, \\lambda^(-3)&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent FXLU:
The oscillating spheroidal charge distribution radiates like an electric dipole with P(θ)∝sin^2θ and frequency ω=2πc/λ so total power ∝ω^4∝λ^(−4). The maximum occurs at θ=90°, and at θ=30° we get sin^2(30°)=1/4. Thus P(30°)/P_max=1/4 and the wavelength dependence is λ^(−4), corresponding to choice3→C).

### thinking by Debate Agent qrA9:
The radiation from an oscillating spheroidal charge distribution is dominated by the electric quadrupole term, for which the angular distribution is f(θ)∝sin^2θ cos^2θ and the frequency dependence is ∝ω^6 (hence λ^−6). The maximum occurs at θ=45°, where sin^2θ cos^2θ=1/4. At θ=30° this factor is (1/2)^2·(√3/2)^2=3/16, so the fraction is (3/16)/(1/4)=3/4.

### thinking by Debate Agent S6HI:
An oscillating spheroidal charge distribution has no net dipole moment change but a time–varying quadrupole moment, so leading radiation is quadrupole. Quadrupole radiation power per unit solid angle ∝|k^3Q|^2∝λ⁻⁶ and the angular pattern ∝sin²θ cos²θ. The maximum occurs at θ=45° giving sin²θ cos²θ=¼. At θ=30°, sin²30° cos²30°=(½)²·(√3/2)²=3/16. The fraction is (3/16)/(1/4)=3/4. Hence the fraction is 3/4 and f∝λ⁻⁶, corresponding to choice 2.

### thinking by Debate Agent 9lWX:
The radiation pattern of an oscillating charge distribution behaving as an electric dipole oscillating along the z–axis is dP/dΩ ∝ sin^2θ and the total power scales as ω^4 ∝ λ^(–4). The maximum occurs at θ=90° (sin^2θ=1), so at θ=30° one has sin^2(30°)=(1/2)^2=1/4. Thus the fraction of the maximum is 1/4 and the wavelength dependence is λ^(–4), matching choice 3.

    <pre>An oscillating spheroidal charge distribution has no changing dipole moment; the leading radiation is quadrupole. Quadrupole power per solid angle ∝ω^6 (so ∝λ^−6) and angular pattern ∝sin^2θ cos^2θ, peaking at θ=45° (value 1/4). At θ=30°, sin^2(30°) cos^2(30°)=(1/2)^2·(√3/2)^2=3/16, so the fraction of the peak is (3/16)/(1/4)=3/4.
