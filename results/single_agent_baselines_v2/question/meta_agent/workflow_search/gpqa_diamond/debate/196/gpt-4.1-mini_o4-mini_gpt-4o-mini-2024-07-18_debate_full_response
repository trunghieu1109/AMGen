The 1H NMR has a COOH at 10.5 ppm, two aromatic doublets (8.0, 7.2 ppm, 2H each) indicating a para‐disubstituted ring, and aliphatic multiplets/doublets/triplets (2.9, 1.7, 1.4, 0.9 ppm) matching a sec‐butyl group. Thus X is 4‐(sec‐butyl)benzoic acid. HI/Red P reduces the Ar–COOH to Ar–H (decarboxylation), leaving sec‐butylbenzene.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent a1IU:\nIR shows broad 3400–2500 and strong 1720\u2009cm⁻¹ bands consistent with a carboxylic acid. The aromatic C–H stretches at 1610 and 1450\u2009cm⁻¹ plus the 1H NMR broad singlet at 10.5\u2009ppm (1\u2009H) confirm a COOH. Two doublets (8.0\u2009ppm, 2\u2009H; 7.2\u2009ppm, 2\u2009H) indicate a para-disubstituted ring. The aliphatic pattern (2.9\u2009m, 1\u2009H; 1.7\u2009m, 2\u2009H; 1.4\u2009d, 3\u2009H; 0.9\u2009t, 3\u2009H) matches a sec-butyl group. Thus X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, and decarboxylation with HI/red P gives sec-butylbenzene. Among the choices, X corresponds to 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent EQ5I:\nThe IR shows a broad 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ band and a 1720 cm⁻¹ C=O stretch, indicating a carboxylic acid. The 10.5 ppm 1H NMR broad singlet confirms COOH. The aromatic 8.0 (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) indicate a para-disubstituted benzene. The aliphatic pattern (2.9 m, 1H; 1.7 m, 2H; 1.4 d, 3H; 0.9 t, 3H) corresponds to a sec-butyl group. Thus Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (choice 2). Treatment with HI/red P reduces COOH to CH₃, converting the benzoic acid to an alkylbenzene: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene (choice 1).\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent 2vga:\nFirst, the IR shows a broad 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ band and a 1720 cm⁻¹ C=O stretch, indicating a carboxylic acid. The NMR has a 10.5 ppm broad singlet (1H, COOH), two aromatic doublets (8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm, each 2H) consistent with a para-disubstituted benzene. The aliphatic signals (2.9 ppm m, 1H; 1.7 ppm m, 2H; 1.4 ppm d, 3H; 0.9 ppm t, 3H) fit a sec-butyl group (CH–CH₃ doublet, CH₂ triplet, etc.). Thus X is 4-sec-butylbenzoic acid (choice 2).\n\nRed phosphorus and HI reduce benzoic acids to toluenes (decarboxylative reduction), giving a methyl group at the former acid position. Therefore 4-sec-butylbenzoic acid → 4-sec-butyl toluene, i.e. 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene (choice 1).\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 1ZiI:\nsec-butylbenzene\n\n### answer by Debate Agent a1IU:\nB)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent EQ5I:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 2vga:\nA)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
