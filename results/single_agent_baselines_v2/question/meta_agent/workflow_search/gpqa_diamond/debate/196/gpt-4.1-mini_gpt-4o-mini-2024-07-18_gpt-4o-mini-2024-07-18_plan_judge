proposed answer: To determine the final product after the reaction of compound X with red phosphorus and HI, we analyze the provided IR and NMR data. The IR spectrum shows a broad peak indicative of -OH (3400–2500 cm-1) and a carbonyl peak (1720 cm-1), suggesting the presence of a carboxylic acid. The NMR data indicates the presence of aromatic protons (around 8.0 and 7.2 ppm) and various aliphatic protons. The presence of a broad singlet at 10.5 ppm suggests a carboxylic acid proton. Given the choices, the compound that best matches the data is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, as it has the necessary carboxylic acid functional group and fits the aromatic and aliphatic proton pattern. Therefore, the final product is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which corresponds to choice B.
