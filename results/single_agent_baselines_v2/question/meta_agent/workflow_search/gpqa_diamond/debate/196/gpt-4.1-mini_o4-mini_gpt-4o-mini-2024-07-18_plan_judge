Question: Example(question='Compound X, which has the following IR and NMR data, reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Identify the final product.\nIR: 3400–2500 cm-1, 1720 cm-1, 1610 cm-1, 1450 cm-1\n1H NMR: 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H), 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H), 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).', choice1='1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene', choice2='4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid', choice3='2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid', choice4='1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The IR and 1H NMR data indicate a para-disubstituted benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (choice 2). Treatment with red phosphorus and HI is a strong reducing system that converts the –COOH group into –CH3, yielding p-sec-butyl-toluene, i.e. 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene (choice A).
