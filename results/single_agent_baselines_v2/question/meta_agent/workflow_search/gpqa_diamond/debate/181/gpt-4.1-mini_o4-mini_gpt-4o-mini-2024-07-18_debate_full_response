Choice 1 matches exactly: trap-free, single-carrier, no injection barrier (Ohmic), negligible diffusion. Choices 2–4 each violate one of these requirements (negligible drift, two carriers, Schottky barrier).\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent vYeA:\nThe Mott–Gurney law assumes a trap-free, single‐carrier device with ohmic injection (no carrier injection barrier) and negligible diffusion current so that drift‐dominated space‐charge limited current results. \nChoice 1 states: trap-free single‐carrier, no injection barrier (i.e. ohmic), negligible diffusion – this matches the required conditions. \nChoice 2 incorrectly says negligible drift current (drift must dominate). Choice 3 involves two carriers (invalid). Choice 4 involves a Schottky contact (injection barrier, invalid).\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent vBZF:\nThe Mott–Gurney law assumes a trap-free, single-carrier device with ideally Ohmic contacts (no injection barrier) so that space-charge–limited drift dominates and diffusion is negligible. This matches choice A.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent 91ht:\nThe Mott–Gurney law (J ∝ V^2) applies to trap-free, single-carrier space-charge-limited current, requiring that contacts be Ohmic (no injection barrier) so that injection is not limiting, and that diffusion currents are negligible compared to drift (space-charge) currents. Statements 2–4 each violate one of these conditions: 2) ’negligible drift’ is opposite of requirement; 3) two carriers introduces recombination/ ambipolar effects; 4) Schottky contact introduces injection barrier. Only choice 1 matches all conditions.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent DIHY:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent vYeA:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent vBZF:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 91ht:\nA)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
