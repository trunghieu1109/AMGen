    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Imagine an operator $\\vec{P}$ of a system have components $P_x, P_y$ and $P_z$. The matrix form of the  operator $P_x$ has components in the first row as $(0, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,\\hbar/\\sqrt{2},0)$.  The matrix form of the  operator $P_y$ has components in the first row as $(0, -i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0, -i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2},0)$. Similarly, matrix form of the  operator $P_z$ has components in the first row as $(\\hbar, 0, 0)$, that in the second row as $(0, 0, 0)$ and that in the third row as $(0,0, -\\hbar)$. The basis vectors here are the eigenvectors of $P_z$. The system is found in the eigenstate of $P_x$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$. To be more specific, the explicit form of the state of the system is given by the column vector having elements $(-1/2, 1/\\sqrt{2}, -1/2)$. What is the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z $ of $P_z$&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;\\hbar\n&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;\\hbar/2&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}\n&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;\\sqrt{2}\\hbar&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent cXsv:
The state in the P_z basis is ψ=(−1/2, 1/√2, −1/2), so |c₁|²=1/4, |c₂|²=1/2, |c₃|²=1/4. P_z eigenvalues are ħ,0,−ħ. Thus ⟨P_z⟩=(1/4−1/4)ħ=0, ⟨P_z²⟩=(1/4+1/4)ħ²=½ħ², so ΔP_z=√(½ħ²)=ħ/√2.

### thinking by Debate Agent Gp5k:
We have the system in the eigenbasis of P_z with eigenvalues +ħ, 0, –ħ and state amplitudes a_+ = –1/2, a_0 = 1/√2, a_- = –1/2.  Normalization check: |a_+|^2+|a_0|^2+|a_-|^2 = 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 =1.  Expectation ⟨P_z⟩ = (1/4·ħ + 1/2·0 + 1/4·(–ħ)) =0.  ⟨P_z^2⟩ = (1/4·ħ^2 + 1/2·0 + 1/4·ħ^2) = ħ^2/2.  Hence (ΔP_z)^2=ħ^2/2, so ΔP_z = ħ/√2.

### thinking by Debate Agent zrGJ:
We have the state |ψ⟩=(−1/2,1/√2,−1/2)ᵀ, normalized. Pz is diagonal with entries (ħ,0,−ħ). Compute ⟨Pz⟩=ħ(|ψ₁|²−|ψ₃|²)=ħ(1/4−1/4)=0. Next ⟨Pz²⟩=ħ²(|ψ₁|²+|ψ₃|²)=ħ²(1/4+1/4)=ħ²/2. Thus (ΔPz)²=⟨Pz²⟩−⟨Pz⟩²=ħ²/2, so ΔPz=ħ/√2.

### thinking by Debate Agent MGzN:
We have state |ψ⟩ in P_z basis with components c1=−1/2, c2=1/√2, c3=−1/2. Operator P_z=ħ·diag(1,0,−1). 
Compute ⟨P_z⟩=ħ(|c1|^2−|c3|^2)=ħ(1/4−1/4)=0. 
Compute ⟨P_z^2⟩=ħ^2(|c1|^2+|c3|^2)=ħ^2(1/4+1/4)=ħ^2/2. 
Thus (ΔP_z)^2=⟨P_z^2⟩−⟨P_z⟩^2=ħ^2/2, so ΔP_z=ħ/√2.

    <pre>The state in the P_z basis is (–1/2, 1/√2, –1/2) so the probabilities are 1/4, 1/2, 1/4 for eigenvalues +ħ, 0, –ħ. Thus ⟨P_z⟩=ħ(1/4–1/4)=0 and ⟨P_z^2⟩=ħ^2(1/4+1/4)=ħ^2/2. Therefore (ΔP_z)^2=ħ^2/2 and ΔP_z=ħ/√2, corresponding to choice C).
