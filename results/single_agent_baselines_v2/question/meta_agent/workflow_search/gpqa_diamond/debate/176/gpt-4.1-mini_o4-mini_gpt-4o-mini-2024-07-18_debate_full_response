Star_1 has radius R1=1.5 R2 and Star_2 has radial velocity v=700 km/s away from us. They appear to peak at the same observed wavelength λ_obs, so by Wien’s law λ_obs,1=b/T1 and λ_obs,2=b/T2×(1+v/c). Setting equal gives T2=T1(1+v/c). Thus T1/T2=1/(1+v/c)≈1/1.002333=0.99767. Luminosity ratio L1/L2=(R1/R2)^2(T1/T2)^4=(1.5)^2×(0.99767)^4≈2.25×0.9907≈2.228≈2.23.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent UBFY:\nTwo stars radiate as black bodies: L∝R^2T^4. Observed λmax are equal, but Star2’s λmax is Doppler‐shifted by v/c≈700\u2009km/s/3×10^5\u2009km/s≈2.33×10−3, so its rest λmax is smaller by that factor, hence T2=T1(1+v/c). Radius ratio R1/R2=1.5 gives naive L1/L2=(1.5)^2=2.25. Correcting for T2^4: L1/L2=2.25/(1.002333)^4≈2.25/1.00937≈2.23.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent R7k5:\nStar1 and Star2 have same observed peak wavelength but Star2 is receding at 700 km/s. The Doppler shift means Star2’s rest‐frame peak λ_rest2=λ_obs/(1+v/c), so T2=T_obs×(1+v/c). Thus T2/T1≈1.00233. Luminosity ratio L1/L2=(R1/R2)^2×(T1/T2)^4=(1.5)^2/(1.00233)^4≈2.25/1.0093≈2.23.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent 5N6p:\nThe observed peak wavelengths are the same so naïvely T1=T2_obs. But star2’s radial velocity z=v/c redshifts its emitted peak: λ_obs=λ_em/(1+v/c), so T2_actual=T_obs*(1+v/c). Thus T2=T1*(1+0.002333). L∝R^2T^4 gives L1/L2=(1.5^2)/(1.002333^4)=2.25×(1–4×0.002333)≈2.23.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 65eB:\nD)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent UBFY:\nD)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent R7k5:\nD)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 5N6p:\nD)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
