    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Astronomers are interested in the luminosities of two stars. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2. The mass of Star_1 is also larger by the same factor (1.5 times). Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same. Astronomers also calculated the radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;~2.25&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;~2.35&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;~2.32&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;~2.23\n&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent 65eB:
The luminosity of a star, assuming it radiates as a black body, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law: L = 4πR^2σT^4, where R is the radius and T is the temperature. Since the stars have the same peak wavelength, they have the same temperature (Wien&#39;s Law). Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Therefore, the luminosity of Star_1 compared to Star_2 is (1.5^2) times greater, because luminosity is proportional to the square of the radius when temperature is constant.

### thinking by Debate Agent UBFY:
Since both stars radiate as black bodies and have the same peak wavelength, they have the same temperature according to Wien&#39;s Law. The luminosity of a star can be calculated using the formula L = 4πR^2σT^4, where R is the radius, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature. Given that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2, the luminosity of Star_1 compared to Star_2 can be found by considering the ratio L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2. Substituting R1/R2 = 1.5, we have L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. Therefore, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of approximately 2.25.

### thinking by Debate Agent R7k5:
To solve this problem, we need to use the Stefan-Boltzmann Law which states that the luminosity (L) of a star is proportional to its surface area (A) and the fourth power of its temperature (T), i.e., L = σA(T^4), where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The surface area of a star is given by A = 4πR^2, where R is the radius. Since the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same, they have the same temperature due to Wien&#39;s Law. Therefore, the luminosity ratio L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2. Given that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2, the ratio of the luminosities would be (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

### thinking by Debate Agent 5N6p:
To solve this problem, we need to use the Stefan-Boltzmann Law, which states that the luminosity (L) of a star is proportional to its surface area and the fourth power of its temperature: L = 4πR^2σT^4, where R is the radius, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature. Given that the stars appear brightest at the same wavelength, they have the same temperature (Wien&#39;s Law). Therefore, the luminosity ratio depends only on the radii: L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2. Since R1 = 1.5 * R2, the luminosity ratio L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

This results in a luminosity ratio of 2.25. All agents agree on this reasoning and result.
