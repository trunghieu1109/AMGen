    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Astronomers are interested in the luminosities of two stars. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2. The mass of Star_1 is also larger by the same factor (1.5 times). Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same. Astronomers also calculated the radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;~2.25&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;~2.35&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;~2.32&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;~2.23\n&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent 65eB:
We have two stars radiating as black bodies. Star_1 has radius R1=1.5 R2 and Star_2 has radial velocity v=700 km/s away from us. They appear to peak at the same observed wavelength λ_obs, so by Wien’s law λ_obs,1=b/T1 and λ_obs,2=b/T2×(1+v/c). Setting equal gives T2=T1(1+v/c). Thus T1/T2=1/(1+v/c)≈1/1.002333=0.99767. Luminosity ratio L1/L2=(R1/R2)^2(T1/T2)^4=(1.5)^2×(0.99767)^4≈2.25×0.9907≈2.228≈2.23.

### thinking by Debate Agent UBFY:
Two stars radiate as black bodies: L∝R^2T^4. Observed λmax are equal, but Star2’s λmax is Doppler‐shifted by v/c≈700 km/s/3×10^5 km/s≈2.33×10−3, so its rest λmax is smaller by that factor, hence T2=T1(1+v/c). Radius ratio R1/R2=1.5 gives naive L1/L2=(1.5)^2=2.25. Correcting for T2^4: L1/L2=2.25/(1.002333)^4≈2.25/1.00937≈2.23.

### thinking by Debate Agent R7k5:
Star1 and Star2 have same observed peak wavelength but Star2 is receding at 700 km/s. The Doppler shift means Star2’s rest‐frame peak λ_rest2=λ_obs/(1+v/c), so T2=T_obs×(1+v/c). Thus T2/T1≈1.00233. Luminosity ratio L1/L2=(R1/R2)^2×(T1/T2)^4=(1.5)^2/(1.00233)^4≈2.25/1.0093≈2.23.

### thinking by Debate Agent 5N6p:
The observed peak wavelengths are the same so naïvely T1=T2_obs. But star2’s radial velocity z=v/c redshifts its emitted peak: λ_obs=λ_em/(1+v/c), so T2_actual=T_obs*(1+v/c). Thus T2=T1*(1+0.002333). L∝R^2T^4 gives L1/L2=(1.5^2)/(1.002333^4)=2.25×(1–4×0.002333)≈2.23.

    <pre>The observed peak wavelengths are equal, but Star 2’s recession at 700 km/s redshifts its emission by factor (1+v/c)≈1.00233, so its actual temperature is T2=T1·(1+v/c). With R1/R2=1.5 and L∝R²T⁴, the ratio is L1/L2=(1.5)²/(1.00233)⁴≈2.23.
