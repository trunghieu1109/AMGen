    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Astronomers are interested in the luminosities of two stars. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2. The mass of Star_1 is also larger by the same factor (1.5 times). Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same. Astronomers also calculated the radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;~2.25&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;~2.35&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;~2.32&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;~2.23\n&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent 65eB:
To determine the luminosity of the stars, we can use the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the luminosity (L) of a black body is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature (T) and the surface area (A) of the star. The surface area of a star is given by A = 4πR², where R is the radius of the star. Since Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, we have R1 = 1.5R2. The luminosity of Star_1 can be expressed as L1 = σ(4π(R1)²)(T1⁴) and for Star_2 as L2 = σ(4π(R2)²)(T2⁴). Given that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same, we can infer that their temperatures are also similar (T1 ≈ T2). Therefore, the luminosity ratio can be calculated as L1/L2 = (R1/R2)² = (1.5)² = 2.25. Thus, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of approximately 2.25.

To find the luminosity of the stars, we can use the Stefan-Boltzmann Law, which states that the luminosity (L) of a black body is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature (T) and the surface area (A). The surface area of a star is given by A = 4πR², where R is the radius of the star. The luminosity can be expressed as L = σA(T^4), where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since both stars have the same peak wavelength, we can assume they have similar temperatures. Therefore, we can compare their luminosities based on their radii. Given that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2, we find that L_1/L_2 = (R_1/R_2)² * (T_1/T_2)⁴. Since the temperatures are assumed to be similar, the ratio simplifies to (1.5)² = 2.25. Thus, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of approximately 2.25.

To find the luminosity of the stars, we can use the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the luminosity (L) of a black body is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature (T) and the surface area (A) of the star. The surface area is given by A = 4πR², where R is the radius of the star. Since the radii of Star_1 and Star_2 are in the ratio of 1.5:1, the surface areas will be in the ratio of (1.5)²:1² = 2.25:1. The mass of the stars also affects their temperature, as more massive stars tend to be hotter. Assuming both stars have similar compositions and the same spectral class (as indicated by their similar wavelengths), we can expect that the temperature of Star_1 will be higher than that of Star_2. However, without specific temperature data, we can estimate that the luminosity of Star_1 will be greater than that of Star_2 primarily due to its larger radius and mass. Therefore, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2 by a factor of approximately 2.25, based on the surface area ratio.

### thinking by Debate Agent 5N6p:
To calculate the luminosity of a star, we can use the Stefan-Boltzmann Law, which states that the luminosity (L) is proportional to the surface area (A) and the fourth power of the temperature (T): L = A * σ * T^4, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The surface area A of a star is given by A = 4 * π * R^2, where R is the radius of the star. Since Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, we can express the surface areas as: A1 = 4 * π * (1.5R2)^2 = 4 * π * 2.25R2^2 = 2.25 * A2. Assuming both stars have the same effective temperature (since their peak brightness wavelengths are the same), the luminosity ratio can be calculated as: L1/L2 = A1/A2 = 2.25. Therefore, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of ~2.25.
