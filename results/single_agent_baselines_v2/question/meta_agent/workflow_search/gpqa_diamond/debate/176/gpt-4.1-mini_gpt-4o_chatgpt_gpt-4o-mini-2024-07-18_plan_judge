Question: Example(question='Astronomers are interested in the luminosities of two stars. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2. The mass of Star_1 is also larger by the same factor (1.5 times). Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same. Astronomers also calculated the radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:', choice1='~2.25', choice2='~2.35', choice3='~2.32', choice4='~2.23\n', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The problem involves comparing the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, which radiate as black bodies. The luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law: L = 4πR^2σT^4, where R is the radius and T is the temperature. Since the stars have the same peak wavelength, they have the same temperature according to Wien's Law. The radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Therefore, the luminosity of Star_1 compared to Star_2 is (1.5^2) times greater, because luminosity is proportional to the square of the radius when temperature is constant. This results in a luminosity ratio of 2.25. All agents agree on this reasoning and result.
