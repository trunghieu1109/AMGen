Question: Example(question='You are studying a nuclear decay which converts two heavy nucleons of flavor A to another flavor B, while simultaneously emitting two much lighter particles E and V. In short, 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V. It is known that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous, with some endpoint value Q.\n\nA variant of this decay emits one exotic, massless particle M instead of the 2V. In this case, how does the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles compare to that of the original decay?', choice1='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint increases.', choice2='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases.', choice3='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.', choice4='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint decreases.', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: In the original decay, the energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous due to the presence of two neutrinos (2V), which can carry away varying amounts of energy. The endpoint value Q represents the maximum energy the E particles can have when the neutrinos carry away minimal energy. In the variant decay, where one massless particle M replaces the two neutrinos, the energy is distributed among fewer particles. Since M is massless, it can carry away any amount of energy, similar to neutrinos, keeping the spectrum continuous. The endpoint increases because the energy that would have been distributed between two neutrinos is now taken by one massless particle, allowing the E particles to potentially have more energy. Therefore, the spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.
