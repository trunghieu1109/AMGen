Question: Example(question='You are studying a nuclear decay which converts two heavy nucleons of flavor A to another flavor B, while simultaneously emitting two much lighter particles E and V. In short, 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V. It is known that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous, with some endpoint value Q.\n\nA variant of this decay emits one exotic, massless particle M instead of the 2V. In this case, how does the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles compare to that of the original decay?', choice1='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint increases.', choice2='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases.', choice3='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.', choice4='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint decreases.', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The decay with one massless boson M plus two electrons is a three-body final state (electrons + M), so the summed-electron energy spectrum remains continuous. Since the original two-neutrino modeâ€™s endpoint was Q (or slightly below if neutrinos have mass), the Majoron-emitting mode allows the electrons to take up to the full Q, raising the endpoint relative to the two-neutrino case. Thus the spectrum stays continuous with an adjusted shape and the endpoint increases.
