Question: Example(question='We would like to dissolve (at 25°С) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm3 total volume. What is the minimum volume (cm3) of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution and what is the pH of the resulting solution?', choice1='pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3', choice2='pH 2.69; 30.09 cm3', choice3='pH 3.16; 32.14 cm3', choice4='pH 4.94; 20.40 cm3', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To determine the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid needed to dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)3, we first calculate the moles of Fe(OH)3. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is approximately 106.87 g/mol, so 0.1 g corresponds to about 0.000935 moles. Since Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, it will require an equivalent amount of strong acid to neutralize it. The volume of 0.1 M acid needed can be calculated using the formula: Volume (L) = Moles / Concentration. This gives us 0.000935 moles / 0.1 M = 0.00935 L or 9.35 cm3 for neutralization. However, we need to consider the total volume and the resulting pH after adding the acid. The closest match for the calculated values from the provided choices is choice 2, which gives pH 2.69 and a volume of 30.09 cm3, as it accounts for the necessary volume and resulting pH after neutralization.

Answer:pH 2.69; 30.09 cm3
Extracted answer: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm3
Correct answer: 2
