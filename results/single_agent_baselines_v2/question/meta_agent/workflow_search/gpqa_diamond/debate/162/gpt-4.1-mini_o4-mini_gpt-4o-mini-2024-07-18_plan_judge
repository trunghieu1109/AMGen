Question: Example(question='We would like to dissolve (at 25°С) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm3 total volume. What is the minimum volume (cm3) of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution and what is the pH of the resulting solution?', choice1='pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3', choice2='pH 2.69; 30.09 cm3', choice3='pH 3.16; 32.14 cm3', choice4='pH 4.94; 20.40 cm3', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: We need moles of Fe(OH)₃: 0.1 g/106.85 g·mol⁻¹≈9.36×10⁻⁴ mol. Reaction requires 3 mol H⁺ per mol Fe(OH)₃, so 2.81×10⁻³ mol H⁺. At 0.1 M, volume = 2.81×10⁻³ mol/0.1 M = 0.0281 L = 28.05 cm³. After dissolution the acidity comes from Fe³⁺ hydrolysis: [Fe³⁺] = 9.36×10⁻³ M, Ka₁ ≈6.3×10⁻³ gives [H⁺]≈9.1×10⁻³?≈7.7×10⁻³ M, pH≈2.04. Thus choice A matches.
