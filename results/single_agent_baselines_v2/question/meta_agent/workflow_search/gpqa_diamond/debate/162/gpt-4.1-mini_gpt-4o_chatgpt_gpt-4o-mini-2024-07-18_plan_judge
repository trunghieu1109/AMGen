Question: Example(question='We would like to dissolve (at 25°С) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm3 total volume. What is the minimum volume (cm3) of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution and what is the pH of the resulting solution?', choice1='pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3', choice2='pH 2.69; 30.09 cm3', choice3='pH 3.16; 32.14 cm3', choice4='pH 4.94; 20.40 cm3', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: All agents calculated the moles of Fe(OH)3 and the moles of H+ required to dissolve it. They determined that 0.002808 moles of H+ are needed, which corresponds to 28.08 cm3 of 0.1 M acid. The total volume of the solution would be approximately 128.08 cm3, leading to a concentration of H+ of about 0.02192 M. The calculated pH was around 1.66, but the closest choice provided is pH 2.04 with 28.05 cm3 of acid. All agents agree that choice A is the closest match to the calculations.
