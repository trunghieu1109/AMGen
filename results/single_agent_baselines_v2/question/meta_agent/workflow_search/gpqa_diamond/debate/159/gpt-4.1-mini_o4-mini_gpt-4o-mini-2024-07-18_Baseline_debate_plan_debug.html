    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Consider an aperture, which shapes like a N-sided polygon. All the apothems are of the same length a. When a monochromatic light (of wavelength \\lambda), travelling along z-axis, falls vertically on this aperture, it creates a series of intensity maxima and minima in the far field region. What is the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large ? Assume that the related angles are small so that tan theta = theta approximation can be taken.&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;1.220 \\lambda /a &#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;0.610 \\lambda / a&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;0.500 \\lambda / a&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;0.506 \\lambda / a&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent 755K:
We have an N-sided polygon aperture with all apothems equal to a. As N→∞, this tends to a circular aperture of radius a. The far‐field diffraction pattern is the Airy pattern with intensity I(θ)∝[2J1(k a θ)/(k a θ)]². The minima occur at zeros of J1: x1≈3.8317, x2≈7.0156, where x=k a θ=2πaθ/λ. Thus θn=xnλ/(2πa). The angular separation between the first two minima is Δθ=(x2−x1)λ/(2πa)≈(7.0156−3.8317)λ/(2πa)≈3.1839/(2π)λ/a≈0.506λ/a. This matches choice 4.

### thinking by Debate Agent ERnq:
As N→∞ the aperture is a circle of radius a (diameter D=2a). The far-field pattern is the Airy disk. The first minimum occurs at θ1≈1.22λ/D and the second at θ2≈2.233λ/D. The angular separation is Δθ=θ2−θ1=(2.233−1.22)λ/D≈1.013λ/D. Substituting D=2a gives Δθ≈1.013λ/(2a)=0.506λ/a, matching choice D).

### thinking by Debate Agent ckaO:
For a regular N‐gon aperture with apothem a, as N→∞ the aperture becomes a circular opening of radius a. The far‐field diffraction pattern is the Airy pattern with intensity minima determined by the zeros of J1. The nth minimum is at k a θn = αn where α1≈3.8317, α2≈7.0156. Using k=2π/λ and small‐angle θ≈sinθ, θn=αnλ/(2πa). Thus θ1≈0.6099λ/a, θ2≈1.1163λ/a, so the spacing Δθ=θ2−θ1≈0.5064λ/a.

### thinking by Debate Agent iWQ8:
For N→∞ the polygon becomes a circular aperture of radius a (diameter D=2a). The Airy pattern minima occur at angles θj = xj·λ/D where x1≈1.22, x2≈2.23,... So θ1=1.22λ/(2a)=0.61λ/a, θ2=2.23λ/(2a)=1.115λ/a. The angular separation between the first two minima is θ2−θ1=(2.23−1.22)·λ/(2a)=1.01λ/(2a)=0.505λ/a ≈0.506λ/a, which corresponds to choice D).
