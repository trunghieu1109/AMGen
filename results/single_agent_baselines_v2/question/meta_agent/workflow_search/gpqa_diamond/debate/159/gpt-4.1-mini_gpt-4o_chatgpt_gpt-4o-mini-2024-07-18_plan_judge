Question: Example(question='Consider an aperture, which shapes like a N-sided polygon. All the apothems are of the same length a. When a monochromatic light (of wavelength \\lambda), travelling along z-axis, falls vertically on this aperture, it creates a series of intensity maxima and minima in the far field region. What is the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large ? Assume that the related angles are small so that tan theta = theta approximation can be taken.', choice1='1.220 \\lambda /a ', choice2='0.610 \\lambda / a', choice3='0.500 \\lambda / a', choice4='0.506 \\lambda / a', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: When N is infinitely large, the N-sided polygon becomes a circle. The problem then reduces to diffraction by a circular aperture. For a circular aperture, the first diffraction minimum occurs at an angle \( \theta \) given by the formula \( \theta = 1.22 \lambda / D \), where \( D \) is the diameter of the aperture. Since the apothem is \( a \), for a circle, the diameter \( D \) is twice the apothem, thus \( D = 2a \). Therefore, the angular distance between the first two minima is \( 1.22 \lambda / a \). This reasoning is consistent across the agents, and the correct choice is A).
