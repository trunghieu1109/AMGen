Question: Example(question='Consider an aperture, which shapes like a N-sided polygon. All the apothems are of the same length a. When a monochromatic light (of wavelength \\lambda), travelling along z-axis, falls vertically on this aperture, it creates a series of intensity maxima and minima in the far field region. What is the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large ? Assume that the related angles are small so that tan theta = theta approximation can be taken.', choice1='1.220 \\lambda /a ', choice2='0.610 \\lambda / a', choice3='0.500 \\lambda / a', choice4='0.506 \\lambda / a', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: As N→∞ the polygon becomes a circular aperture of radius a. The far-field diffraction is the Airy pattern with minima at zeros of J1: x1≈3.8317, x2≈7.0156. With k=2π/λ and θ≈xλ/(2πa), the separation Δθ=(x2−x1)λ/(2πa)≈0.506λ/a.
