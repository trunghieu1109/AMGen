Question: Example(question='Consider an aperture, which shapes like a N-sided polygon. All the apothems are of the same length a. When a monochromatic light (of wavelength \\lambda), travelling along z-axis, falls vertically on this aperture, it creates a series of intensity maxima and minima in the far field region. What is the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large ? Assume that the related angles are small so that tan theta = theta approximation can be taken.', choice1='1.220 \\lambda /a ', choice2='0.610 \\lambda / a', choice3='0.500 \\lambda / a', choice4='0.506 \\lambda / a', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: As N approaches infinity, the N-sided polygon approximates a circular aperture. The angular positions of the minima in the diffraction pattern for a circular aperture are given by the formula sin(theta) = m * (lambda / D), where m is the order of the minimum, lambda is the wavelength, and D is the diameter of the aperture. For small angles, we can use the approximation sin(theta) â‰ˆ theta. The diameter D can be expressed in terms of the apothem a. The angular distance between the first two minima (m=1 and m=2) can be calculated as the difference in their angular positions, which leads to the conclusion that the angular distance corresponds to 0.610 lambda / a. This matches with one of the provided choices, confirming the answer.
