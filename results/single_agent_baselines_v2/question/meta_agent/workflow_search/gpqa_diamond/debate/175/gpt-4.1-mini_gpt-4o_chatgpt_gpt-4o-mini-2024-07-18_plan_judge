Question: Example(question='The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1), and the operators of two observables P and Q of the system are represented by two square matrices. The matrix corresponding to operator P has the elements in first row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0), elements in the second row as (1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}) and that in third row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0). The matrix operator for Q is represented by the square matrix having elements in the first row as (1, 0, 0), second row as (0, 0, 0) and third row as (0, 0, -1). Now, if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P, what is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements?', choice1='1/2', choice2='1/6', choice3='1/3', choice4='2/3', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: All agents agree on the process of finding the probability of measuring 0 for P and -1 for Q. They first determine the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator P, project the initial state onto the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0, and then measure Q. They find the probability of obtaining -1 for Q by projecting the post-P measurement state onto the eigenvector of Q with eigenvalue -1. The final probability is the product of these probabilities. All agents, except one, agree that the probability is 1/6, and one agent provided the choice B) which corresponds to 1/6. Therefore, the consensus is that the probability is 1/6.
