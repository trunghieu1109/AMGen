Question: Example(question='The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1), and the operators of two observables P and Q of the system are represented by two square matrices. The matrix corresponding to operator P has the elements in first row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0), elements in the second row as (1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}) and that in third row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0). The matrix operator for Q is represented by the square matrix having elements in the first row as (1, 0, 0), second row as (0, 0, 0) and third row as (0, 0, -1). Now, if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P, what is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements?', choice1='1/2', choice2='1/6', choice3='1/3', choice4='2/3', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: Normalize |ψ> = (–1,2,1) → (–1,2,1)/√6. P=0 eigenvector |p0> = (1,0,–1)/√2. Compute ⟨p0|ψ> = (1/√2)(–1/√6–1/√6) = –2/√12 → probability 1/3. After collapse to |p0>, Q=–1 eigenvector = (0,0,1), overlap ⟨e3|p0> = –1/√2 → probability 1/2. Joint probability = (1/3)*(1/2) = 1/6, which is choice B).
