### thinking by Debate Agent 5cfs:
We need to rank the six benzene derivatives by the fraction of the para-bromo isomer formed in electrophilic bromination. Activating, ortho/para-directing groups (alkyl, halogen) give relatively high para-fractions; deactivating, meta-directing groups (–NO2, –COOH, –COOR) give low para-fractions. Among the meta directors, –NO2 is the strongest resonance withdrawer (giving the smallest para-yield), followed by –COOH, then –COOR. Among the ortho/para directors, steric hindrance at ortho makes the larger ethyl group give slightly more para-product than methyl, and chlorobenzene (despite deactivation) still favors para more than alkyls. Thus the increasing order of para-fraction is: nitrobenzene (4) &lt; benzoic acid (6) &lt; ethyl benzoate (2) &lt; toluene (1) &lt; ethylbenzene (5) &lt; chlorobenzene (3), which corresponds to choice 4, i.e. D.

### thinking by Debate Agent jowT:
In electrophilic bromination of monosubstituted benzenes the para‐isomer fraction depends on whether the substituent directs ortho/para or meta and on steric/electronic biases among o vs p. Strong meta directors (–NO₂, –COOH, –COOR) give essentially no para, with –NO₂ the strongest deactivator (least p), then –COOH, then the weaker –COOR (smallest but nonzero p). Ortho/para directors yield mixtures of o and p; steric hindrance at ortho raises the p fraction in the order CH₃ &lt; C₂H₅ &lt; Cl (Cl is an o/p director with stronger resonance donation favoring para). Thus the increasing order of para‐isomer yield is: 4 (–NO₂) &lt; 6 (–COOH) &lt; 2 (–COOR) &lt; 1 (–CH₃) &lt; 5 (–C₂H₅) &lt; 3 (–Cl), which corresponds to choice 4 (D).

### thinking by Debate Agent zqEy:
We need to rank substrates 1–6 by the fraction of the para-bromo product in electrophilic bromination. Meta directors (NO2, COOH, COOR) give only small para yields (nitro ∼4%, benzoic acid ∼16%, ethyl benzoate ∼28%). Alkyl directors give more para: toluene ∼30%, ethylbenzene ∼32%, and chlorobenzene ∼66%. Thus increasing para fraction: nitrobenzene (4) &lt; benzoic acid (6) &lt; ethyl benzoate (2) &lt; toluene (1) &lt; ethylbenzene (5) &lt; chlorobenzene (3), i.e. choice4.

### thinking by Debate Agent t3I8:
We need to rank substrates by the fraction of para-bromo product in their bromination mixtures. Electron-withdrawing meta directors (–NO2, –COOH, –COOR) give low para fractions, in order of increasing para: nitrobenzene &lt; benzoic acid &lt; ethyl benzoate. Ortho/para directors (–CH3, –C2H5, –Cl) give higher para fractions, in order: toluene &lt; ethylbenzene &lt; chlorobenzene. Thus overall: 4&lt;6&lt;2&lt;1&lt;5&lt;3.

    <pre>Electrophilic bromination para‐fraction correlates with substituent directing effects and steric/electronic biases. Strong meta‐directors give very low para yields in order NO₂&lt;COOH&lt;COOR. Ortho/para directors give higher para yields; steric hindrance raises p‐fraction in order CH₃&lt;C₂H₅&lt;Cl. Thus overall increasing para fraction: nitrobenzene(4)&lt;benzoic acid(6)&lt;ethyl benzoate(2)&lt;toluene(1)&lt;ethylbenzene(5)&lt;chlorobenzene(3), matching choice 4 (D).
