### thinking by Debate Agent 5cfs:
To determine the order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer for the given substances undergoing electrophilic substitution with bromine, we need to consider the directing effects of the substituents on the benzene ring. Electron-donating groups (EDGs) generally increase the yield of the para-isomer, while electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) decrease it. For example, methyl (C6H5-CH3) and ethyl (C6H5-C2H5) groups are EDGs and will favor para substitution more than ortho, while nitro (C6H5-NO2) and carboxylic acid (C6H5-COOH) are EWGs and will reduce the yield of para isomers. Chlorine (C6H5-Cl) is a halogen and can direct to both ortho and para positions but is less effective than strong EDGs. The order of the substances based on these considerations is likely to be: 4 (NO2) &lt; 6 (COOH) &lt; 2 (COOC2H5) &lt; 1 (CH3) &lt; 5 (C2H5) &lt; 3 (Cl). Thus, the correct choice that reflects this order is choice 4.

To determine the order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer for the given substances undergoing electrophilic substitution with bromine, we need to consider the directing effects of the substituents on the benzene ring. Electron-donating groups (EDGs) like -CH3 and -C2H5 direct electrophilic substitution to the ortho and para positions, while electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) like -NO2 and -COOH direct substitution to the meta position. The order of influence on para substitution is as follows: EDGs favor para substitution more than EWGs. Therefore, we analyze each substance: 

1) ะก6H5-CH3 (methyl group) is an EDG and favors para substitution. 
2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (ethoxy group) is also an EDG, favoring para substitution. 
3) C6H5-Cl (chlorine) is a weakly deactivating group but still directs to ortho and para. 
4) C6H5-NO2 (nitro group) is an EWG and directs to meta, yielding low para. 
5) C6H5-C2H5 (ethyl group) is an EDG, favoring para. 
6) C6H5-COOH (carboxylic acid) is an EWG, directing to meta, yielding low para. 

Thus, the order from least to most yield of para isomer based on the substituents: 4 (NO2) &lt; 6 (COOH) &lt; 2 (COOC2H5) &lt; 1 (CH3) &lt; 5 (C2H5) &lt; 3 (Cl). 

Therefore, the correct arrangement is 4&lt;6&lt;2&lt;1&lt;5&lt;3.

In electrophilic substitution reactions, the directing effects of substituents on the benzene ring play a crucial role in determining the yield of para- and ortho-isomers. Electron-donating groups (EDGs) enhance the reactivity of the ring and direct incoming electrophiles to the ortho and para positions, while electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) tend to deactivate the ring and direct electrophiles to the meta position. In this case, we need to analyze the substituents on each substance:

1) ะก6H5-CH3 (methyl group) - EDG, directs to ortho and para.
2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (ethoxycarbonyl group) - EWG, directs to meta.
3) C6H5-Cl (chlorine) - EWG, directs to ortho and para but with less reactivity.
4) C6H5-NO2 (nitro group) - strong EWG, directs to meta.
5) C6H5-C2H5 (ethyl group) - EDG, directs to ortho and para.
6) C6H5-COOH (carboxylic acid) - EWG, directs to meta.

Considering the effects, we can rank the substances based on the expected yield of the para-isomer:
- The strongest EDGs (methyl and ethyl) will give the highest yields of para-isomers, followed by weaker EDGs like chlorine, and then the EWGs which will produce meta products.

Thus, the order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer should reflect this understanding: 4 (NO2) &lt; 2 (COOC2H5) &lt; 6 (COOH) &lt; 3 (Cl) &lt; 1 (CH3) &lt; 5 (C2H5). This corresponds to choice 4.

To determine the order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer for the given substances, we need to consider the directing effects of the substituents on the benzene ring. Electron-donating groups (EDGs) tend to direct electrophilic substitutions to the ortho and para positions, while electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) direct substitutions to the meta position. Substituents such as -NO2 are strong EWGs and will result in lower yields of the para-isomer compared to EDGs like -CH3 and -C2H5. Therefore, substances will be ranked based on their substituents&#39; effects on the electrophilic substitution reaction. After analyzing the substituents, the correct order is found to be 4&lt;6&lt;2&lt;1&lt;5&lt;3, which corresponds to choice 4.
