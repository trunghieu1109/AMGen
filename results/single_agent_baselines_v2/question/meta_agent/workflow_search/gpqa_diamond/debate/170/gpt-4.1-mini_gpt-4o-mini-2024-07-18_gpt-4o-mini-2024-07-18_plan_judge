Question: Example(question='Substances 1-6 undergo an electrophilic substitution reaction with an excess of bromine (it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed):\n1) ะก6H5-CH3\n2) C6H5-COOC2H5\n3) C6H5-Cl\n4) C6H5-NO2\n5) C6H5-C2H5\n6) C6H5-COOH\nC6H5 - means benzene ring\nArrange the substances in order of increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer.', choice1='3<5<1<6<2<4', choice2='4<2<6<3<1<5', choice3='6<2<4<5<1<3', choice4='4<6<2<1<5<3', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To determine the order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer for the given substances undergoing electrophilic substitution with bromine, we analyze the substituents on the benzene ring. Electron-donating groups (EDGs) such as -CH3 and -C2H5 favor para substitution, while electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) like -NO2 and -COOH reduce the yield of para isomers. The order of influence is as follows: 4 (NO2) < 6 (COOH) < 2 (COOC2H5) < 1 (CH3) < 5 (C2H5) < 3 (Cl). Therefore, the correct arrangement is 4<6<2<1<5<3, which corresponds to choice 4.

Answer:4<6<2<1<5<3
Extracted answer: 4<6<2<1<5<3
Correct answer: 4
