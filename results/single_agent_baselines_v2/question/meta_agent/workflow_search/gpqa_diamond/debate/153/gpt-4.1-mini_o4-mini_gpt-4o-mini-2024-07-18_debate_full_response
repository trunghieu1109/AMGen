The IR broad 3500–2700 cm⁻¹ band plus a sharp 1720 cm⁻¹ peak is characteristic of a carboxylic acid. The 1H NMR shows an –OH at 11.0 ppm (s, 1H) and an AA′BB′ pattern (8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm, each 2H) consistent with a para‐disubstituted benzene. Thus, the structure is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent Vr9h:\n1) The M and M+2 peaks at m/z 156 and 158 in a ~3:1 ratio indicate one Cl atom (M = 156).\n2) The IR shows a broad 3500–2700 cm⁻¹ band (carboxylic O–H) and a sharp 1720 cm⁻¹ band (C=O).\n3) The ¹H NMR: 11.0 ppm (s, 1H) is the COOH proton; 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H) are two sets of aromatic protons, indicative of a para-substituted benzene.\n4) 4-Chlorobenzoic acid (para-Cl) fits C₇H₅ClO₂ (M = 156), shows two aromatic doublets and a carboxylic OH. Ortho or meta isomers give more complex patterns; phenyl chloroformate lacks an OH. Thus the compound is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent 2cpG:\nThe molecular ion at m/z 156 with an M+2 at 158 (~32%) indicates one chlorine atom (3:1 isotopic ratio). The IR shows a broad 3500–2700 cm–1 band and a sharp C=O at 1720 cm–1, consistent with a carboxylic acid. The 1H NMR has a 1H singlet at 11.0 ppm (CO2H) and two doublets (2H each) at 8.02 and 7.72 ppm, indicating a para-disubstituted benzene. Among the choices, only 4-chlorobenzoic acid fits this data.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent Kygp:\nThe molecular ion at m/z 156 with an M+2 peak at 158 (~32%) indicates one Cl atom. IR shows a broad 3500–2700 cm⁻¹ band (carboxylic O–H) and a sharp 1720 cm⁻¹ C=O (acid). The 1H NMR singlet at 11.0 ppm (1H) is an acid proton. Two aromatic doublets (2H each) at 8.02 and 7.72 ppm imply a para-disubstituted benzene. Thus the structure is p-chlorobenzoic acid (4-chlorobenzoic acid).\n\n### answer by Debate Agent DQVo:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent Vr9h:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 2cpG:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent Kygp:\nA)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
