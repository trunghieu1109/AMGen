By Heisenberg’s principle Δx·Δp ≥ ħ/2, so Δp ≥ ħ/(2Δx) ≈ (1.054×10^−34 J·s)/(2×10^−10 m) ≈5.27×10^−25 kg·m/s. The kinetic energy E=p^2/(2m) gives dE≈(p/m)dp, and since p/m=v, ΔE≈v·Δp ≈2×10^8 m/s×5.27×10^−25 kg·m/s ≈1.05×10^−16 J. Thus the minimum uncertainty in energy is on the order of 10^−16 J.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent Qv43:\nGiven Δx = 0.1 nm = 1×10^(-10) m. By the uncertainty principle, Δp ≥ ħ/(2Δx) ≈ (1.05×10^(-34) J·s)/(2×10^(-10) m) = 5.27×10^(-25) kg·m/s. The kinetic energy E = p^2/(2m), so ΔE ≈ (dE/dp)Δp = (p/m)Δp = v·Δp. Here v = 2×10^8 m/s, so ΔE ≈ 2×10^8 m/s × 5.27×10^(-25) kg·m/s ≈ 1.05×10^(-16) J, i.e. on the order of 10^(-16) J.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent uUaY:\nWe estimate Δp via Heisenberg: Δx Δp ≥ ħ/2. With Δx = 0.1 nm = 1×10⁻¹⁰ m, ħ = 1.055×10⁻³⁴ J·s, so Δp ≥ ħ/(2Δx) ≃ (1.055×10⁻³⁴)/(2×10⁻¹⁰) ≃ 5.27×10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s. The uncertainty in kinetic energy is ΔE ≃ vΔp (since dE = v dp for nonrelativistic motion), with v = 2×10⁸ m/s, giving ΔE ≃ 2×10⁸ × 5.27×10⁻²⁵ ≃ 1.05×10⁻¹⁶ J. Thus the closest choice is ~10⁻¹⁶ J.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent J7wM:\nWe have an electron moving at speed v=2×10^8\u2009m/s, with position uncertainty Δx=0.1\u2009nm=1×10^−10\u2009m. By Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle: Δx·Δp≥ħ/2, so Δp_min=ħ/(2Δx)=(1.054×10^−34\u2009J·s)/(2×1×10^−10\u2009m)=5.27×10^−25\u2009kg·m/s. The minimum energy uncertainty is ΔE≈v·Δp=(2×10^8\u2009m/s)×(5.27×10^−25\u2009kg·m/s)=1.054×10^−16\u2009J≈10^−16\u2009J.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 85KS:\nC)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent Qv43:\nC)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent uUaY:\nC)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent J7wM:\nC)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
