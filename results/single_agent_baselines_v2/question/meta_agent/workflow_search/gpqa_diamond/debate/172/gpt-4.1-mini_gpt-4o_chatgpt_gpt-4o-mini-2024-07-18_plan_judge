Question: Example(question="If uncertainty in space of electron's location, which is travelling with speed v= 2* 10^8 m/s along x-direction is Δx=0.1 nm . Based on the infromation estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of electron.", choice1='~10^(-19) J', choice2='~10^(-18) J', choice3='~10^(-16) J', choice4='~10^(-17) J', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To determine the minimum uncertainty in the energy of the electron, we use the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where Δx is the uncertainty in position and Δp is the uncertainty in momentum. Given Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 x 10^(-9) m, we calculate Δp as Δp ≥ ħ/(2Δx). The reduced Planck's constant is ħ ≈ 1.0545718 x 10^(-34) J·s. Substituting these values, Δp ≥ 1.0545718 x 10^(-34) J·s / (2 x 0.1 x 10^(-9) m) = 5.272859 x 10^(-25) kg·m/s. The uncertainty in energy ΔE is related to Δp by ΔE = Δp * v, where v = 2 x 10^8 m/s. Thus, ΔE = 5.272859 x 10^(-25) kg·m/s * 2 x 10^8 m/s = 1.0545718 x 10^(-16) J. This calculation suggests that the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of the electron is approximately ~10^(-16) J. Therefore, the correct choice is C).
