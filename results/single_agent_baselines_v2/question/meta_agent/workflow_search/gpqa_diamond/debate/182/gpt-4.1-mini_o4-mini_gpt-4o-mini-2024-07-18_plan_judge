Question: Example(question='What is the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product obtained when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess of HI?', choice1='1', choice2='3', choice3='0', choice4='5', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: Red P/HI (Clemmensen conditions) reduces the aldehyde (–CHO) and carboxylic acid (–COOH) to alkanes (removing their C=O unsaturations) but does not affect C=C bonds or ring closures. The starting cyclohexene retains its ring (IHD = 1) and its C3–C4 double bond (IHD = 1), and the vinyl substituent remains (IHD = 1). Total IHD = 3.
