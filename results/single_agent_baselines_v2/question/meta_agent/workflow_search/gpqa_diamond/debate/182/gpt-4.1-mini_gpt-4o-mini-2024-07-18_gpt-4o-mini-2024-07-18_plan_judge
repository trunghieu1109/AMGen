Question: Example(question='What is the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product obtained when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess of HI?', choice1='1', choice2='3', choice3='0', choice4='5', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product obtained from the reaction of 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid with red phosphorus and excess HI, we analyze the expected changes in the molecular structure. The reaction typically leads to the saturation of double bonds and the reduction of functional groups. The IHD can be calculated using the formula: IHD = (2C + 2 + N - H - X) / 2. After considering the structure and the effects of the reaction, it appears that the product will have an IHD of 1, indicating that it retains some unsaturation. Therefore, the correct answer is '1'.
