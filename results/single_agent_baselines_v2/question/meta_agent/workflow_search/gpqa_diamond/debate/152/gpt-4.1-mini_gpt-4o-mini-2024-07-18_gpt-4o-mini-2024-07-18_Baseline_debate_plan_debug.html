    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;α-β unsaturated carbonyls have a much more electrophilic carbon double bond. These double bonds act as a good Lewis acid and react with nucleophiles to produce enolate ions. In this case, when a nucleophile attacks the β position, it produces a resonance-stabilized intermediate. When a nucleophile attacking the β-carbon is enolate, such reaction is known as the Michael reaction.\nWhat are the reactants and major final products of the following Michael addition reactions?\ndimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --&gt;(A)\n1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H3O+) --&gt; (B)\nC + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H2O) ---&gt; 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent VApC:
To determine the correct reactants and major final products of the Michael addition reactions, I will analyze each choice in relation to the given reactions. The Michael reaction typically involves the addition of a nucleophile to an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound, leading to resonance-stabilized intermediates. I will compare the products listed in each choice with the expected outcomes based on the reactants provided in the question.

### thinking by Debate Agent 6iCN:
To determine the correct reactants and major final products of the Michael addition reactions, we need to analyze the provided choices against the typical outcomes of the reactions described. The Michael reaction typically involves the addition of a nucleophile to an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound, leading to resonance-stabilized intermediates and specific final products. Carefully examining each choice against the expected products helps identify the correct answers.

### thinking by Debate Agent DmaR:
To solve the question, I need to analyze the Michael addition reactions given and identify the correct reactants and major products for each reaction based on the provided choices. The Michael reaction involves nucleophilic addition to α-β unsaturated carbonyl compounds, forming resonance-stabilized intermediates. By carefully examining the reactants and the nature of the products in the choices, I can determine which choice accurately represents the expected outcomes of the reactions.

### thinking by Debate Agent MasV:
To determine the correct reactants and major final products for the Michael addition reactions given the choices, I will analyze each choice against the provided reactions. The Michael reaction involves nucleophilic attack at the β position of α-β unsaturated carbonyl compounds. The products must reflect the expected transformations based on the reactants specified. I will compare the reactants and products in each choice with the expected outcomes of the reactions to identify the correct answers.

A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione

### answer by Debate Agent 6iCN:
A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione

### answer by Debate Agent DmaR:
A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione

### answer by Debate Agent MasV:
A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione

Given all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer. Put your thinking process in the &#39;thinking&#39; field and the final answer in the &#39;answer&#39; field.</pre>
