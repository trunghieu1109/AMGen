In the first reaction, dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of sodium ethoxide and ethanol undergo a Michael addition. The nucleophile, dimethyl malonate, attacks the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated ester, forming a product through conjugate addition. In the second reaction, 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine reacts with (E)-but-2-enenitrile in methanol and acid, where the nucleophile attacks the beta-carbon of the unsaturated nitrile, leading to the formation of a new carbon-carbon bond. In the third reaction, a compound C reacts with but-3-en-2-one in the presence of KOH and water to form a 1,5-diketone. The choices provided suggest the structures of the reactants and products, and we need to choose the correct set based on the reactions described.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent 6iCN:\nTo determine the products of the Michael addition reactions, we first analyze each reaction separately. For reaction (A), dimethyl malonate undergoes a Michael addition with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt and EtOH, leading to the formation of a 1,5-dicarbonyl compound, which after deprotonation and subsequent steps, results in trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. For reaction (B), 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine reacts with (E)-but-2-enenitrile in MeOH and H3O+, resulting in 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile due to the addition of the enolate to the nitrile. Finally, for reaction (C), KOH and H2O facilitate the Michael addition of cyclohexane-1,3-dione to but-3-en-2-one, forming 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. From the given choices, choice 1 matches these results.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent DmaR:\nTo solve the problem, we need to analyze each Michael addition reaction and determine the major products. In reaction (A), dimethyl malonate, an active methylene compound, reacts with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt, leading to the formation of trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. In reaction (B), 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine reacts with (E)-but-2-enenitrile in the presence of MeOH and H3O+, resulting in 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile. In reaction (C), 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione reacts with but-3-en-2-one in the presence of KOH and H2O, resulting in 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. Comparing these results with the given choices, choice 1 matches the outcomes of the reactions.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent MasV:\nIn a Michael addition, nucleophiles attack the β-carbon of α-β unsaturated carbonyl compounds.
