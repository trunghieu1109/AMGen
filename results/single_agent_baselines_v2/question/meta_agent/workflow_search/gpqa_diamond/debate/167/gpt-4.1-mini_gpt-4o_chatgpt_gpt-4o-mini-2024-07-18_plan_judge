Question: Example(question='Which of the following issues are the most common sources of difficult-to-spot erroneous results generated in genomics data analysis:\n\n- Mutually incompatible data formats\n- The "chr" / "no chr" confusion\n- Reference assembly mismatch\n- Incorrect ID conversion', choice1='3 and 4', choice2='2 and 3', choice3='All of the above', choice4='2, 3 and 4', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: All agents have evaluated the common sources of difficult-to-spot erroneous results in genomics data analysis. They have considered mutually incompatible data formats, the 'chr' / 'no chr' confusion, reference assembly mismatch, and incorrect ID conversion as potential sources of errors. Each agent concluded that all these issues are indeed common and can independently or collectively lead to errors in genomics data analysis. Therefore, the most comprehensive and inclusive choice is the one that includes all the mentioned issues.
