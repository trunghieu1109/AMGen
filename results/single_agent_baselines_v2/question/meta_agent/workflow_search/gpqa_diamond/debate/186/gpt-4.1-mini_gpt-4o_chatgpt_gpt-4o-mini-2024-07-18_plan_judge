proposed answer: To determine the detectability of the stars using the ESPRESSO spectrograph, we need to calculate the apparent magnitudes of each star and compare them with the spectrograph's sensitivity. The ESPRESSO spectrograph, when coupled with an 8m VLT telescope, can detect stars with apparent magnitudes up to about 16.5 in a 1-hour exposure for a signal-to-noise ratio of at least 10. 

Let's calculate the apparent magnitudes for each star:

- Canopus: Apparent magnitude ~ -0.74, easily detectable.
- Polaris: Apparent magnitude ~ 1.98, detectable.
- Star at 10 pc: Apparent magnitude = 15 + 5(log10(10) - 1) = 15, detectable.
- Star at 200 pc: Apparent magnitude = 15 + 5(log10(200) - 1) = 20.51, not detectable.
- Star at 5 pc: Apparent magnitude = 15 + 5(log10(5) - 1) = 13.5, detectable.
- Star at 50 pc: Apparent magnitude = 15 + 5(log10(50) - 1) = 18.49, not detectable.

Thus, Canopus, Polaris, the star at 10 pc, and the star at 5 pc are detectable, totaling 4 detectable stars. Therefore, the correct choice is 4.
