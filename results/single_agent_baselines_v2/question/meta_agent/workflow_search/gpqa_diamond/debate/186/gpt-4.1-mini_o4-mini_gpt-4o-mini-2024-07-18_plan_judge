Question: Example(question='How many of the stars listed below would be detectable using the ESPRESSO spectrograph, when it is coupled with one of the 8m VLT telescopes at the Paranal Observatory? A star is considered detectable if a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure is achieved.\n\nFor more details about the ESPRESSO spectrograph, please refer to the following link:\nhttps://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/instruments/espresso/overview.html\n\na) Canopus\nb) Polaris\nc) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 10 pc distance from us.\nd) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 200 pc distance from us.\ne) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 5 pc distance from us.\nf) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 50 pc distance from us.', choice1='4', choice2='3', choice3='2', choice4='5', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To determine detectability, estimate each star’s apparent V magnitude and compare to ESPRESSO’s 1 hr S/N=10 limit of about V≈16–17 on an 8 m telescope. Canopus (V≈–0.7) and Polaris (V≈2.0) are easily detectable. For the M_V=15 stars: at 5 pc m≈13.5 (detectable), at 10 pc m=15.0 (detectable), at 50 pc m≈18.5 (too faint), at 200 pc m≈21.5 (too faint). That yields four detectable targets.
