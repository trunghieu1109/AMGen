A high-yield route uses sulfonation as a temporary blocking group to control regiochemistry of the key nitration, then desulfonation, conversion of nitro to phenol by reduction→diazotization→hydrolysis, Williamson ether synthesis to introduce ethoxy, and finally nitration to install the nitro in the correct position.  Only choice 3 lays out that block-nitrate, reduction, diazo, hydrolysis, desulfonation and etherification sequence.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent hvkM:\nWe need to install an ethoxy at C-1, a tert-butyl at C-2, and a nitro at C-3 of benzene.  A high-regioselectivity route uses a sulfonate blocking group to guide nitration.  In practice the sequence is: (i) Friedel–Crafts tert-butylation, (ii) sulfonation to block the future para-position, (iii) nitration to install NO2 ortho to t-Bu, (iv) reduction/diazotization/hydrolysis to convert that nitro into a phenol at C-2, (v) desulfonation, (vi) Williamson etherification to give the ethoxy at C-1, and finally (vii) nitration in the presence of the sulfonate block to place NO2 at C-3, then desulfonate.  Only choice 3 matches this logic.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent OaCI:\nWe want to install the nitro only at the very end, and any early‐introduced nitro must be removed before that final nitration. The highest‐yielding route is: (1) Friedel–Crafts tert-butylation on benzene, (2) an early nitration (then later reduction) which is removed by reduction, (3) diazotization/hydrolysis to give phenol, (4) Williamson ether to give ethoxy, (5) reduction of the early nitro if still present, and finally (6) the last nitration to install the nitro meta to the ethoxy and ortho to the tert-butyl. Among the choices only choice 2 ends with a final nitration (step ix) with removal of any earlier nitro by Fe/HCl in step viii, matching the ideal strategy.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent 2Eed:\nThe optimal route installs the ethoxy via diazonium hydrolysis and Williamson ether synthesis before Friedel–Crafts alkylation and final nitration, which only matches choice 4’s general outline of first nitration, reduction, diazotization → phenol → ether → t-butylation → nitration. Although the printed sequence has extra sulfonation/desulfonation protecting‐group steps, it is the only option beginning with nitration and ending with ether formation then t-butylation and nitration. Thus choice 4 is correct.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent Xlyw:\nC)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent hvkM:\nC\n\n### answer by Debate Agent OaCI:\nB)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 2Eed:\nD)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
