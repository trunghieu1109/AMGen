Question: Example(question='Consider a system of three spins S1, S2 and S3. Each of which can take spin +1 and -1.

proposed answer: To find the partition function Z, we need to consider all possible configurations of the spins S1, S2, and S3, each of which can be +1 or -1. There are 2^3 = 8 possible configurations. For each configuration, we calculate the energy E using the formula E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. Then, we calculate the Boltzmann factor e^(-E\beta) for each configuration, where \beta = 1/kT. The partition function Z is the sum of these Boltzmann factors over all configurations. By evaluating each configuration, we find that there are 2 configurations with energy -3J (all spins aligned), and 6 configurations with energy J (two spins aligned and one anti-aligned). Thus, Z = 2e^(3J\beta) + 6e^(-J\beta), which matches choice A.
