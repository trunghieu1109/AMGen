Question: Example(question='Consider a system of three spins S1, S2 and S3. Each of which can take spin +1 and -1. The energy of the system is given by, E= -J[ S1S2 +S1S3+S2S3 ].\nFind the partition function Z of the system. (\\beta = 1/kT , k= boltzmann constant and T= temperature)', choice1='Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)', choice2='Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)', choice3='Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)', choice4='Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: To find the partition function Z of the system of three spins, we consider all possible configurations of the spins S1, S2, and S3, each of which can take values +1 or -1. This results in 2^3 = 8 configurations. We calculate the energy for each configuration using the formula E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. After determining the energies for all configurations, we apply the Boltzmann factor e^(-beta * E) to each energy and sum these contributions to find the partition function Z. The calculations consistently lead to the expression Z = 2 e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ), which matches the first choice provided.
