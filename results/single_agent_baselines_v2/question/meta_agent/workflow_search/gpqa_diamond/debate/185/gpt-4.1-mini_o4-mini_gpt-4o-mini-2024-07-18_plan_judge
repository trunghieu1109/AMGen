Question: Example(question='Identify the possible product when (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene undergoes Cope rearrangement.', choice1='4,4a,7,7a-tetrahydro-1H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine', choice2='4,4a,5,7a-tetrahydro-3H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine', choice3='4,6,7,7a-tetrahydro-3H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine', choice4='4,4a,5,6-tetrahydro-1H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The aza-Cope ([3,3] sigmatropic) of N-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene opens the norbornene, forming a cyclopenta[c]pyridine framework with two new Ï€-bonds giving a dihydropyridine.  Mapping the new sp3 centers shows positions 4, 4a, 5 and 7a are saturated, corresponding to 4,4a,5,7a-tetrahydro-3H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine.
