Question: Example(question='You identified a new quorum-sensing peptide in the bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus. You are highly interested if its role in intercellular communication is conserved among the eukaryotes. You treat yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with the peptide and interestingly observe the formation of the shmoo. You want to learn about the proteome of the active chromatin in the shmoo and recover it by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. The least of proteins from which complex below will you observe in your assay?', choice1='pre-initiation complex', choice2='pre-replication complex', choice3='enhancer protein complex', choice4='nucleosome histone complex', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The question asks which protein complex will be least observed in an assay focused on the active chromatin of yeast during shmoo formation, which is related to mating and transcriptional activity. The pre-initiation complex and enhancer protein complex are involved in transcription, and the nucleosome histone complex is part of chromatin structure. The pre-replication complex is involved in DNA replication, not transcription, and is less likely to be associated with active chromatin during shmoo formation. Therefore, proteins from the pre-replication complex are least likely to be observed.
