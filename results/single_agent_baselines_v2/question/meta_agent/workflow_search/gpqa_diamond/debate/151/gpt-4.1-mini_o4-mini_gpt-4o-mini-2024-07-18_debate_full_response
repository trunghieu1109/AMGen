This will pull down nucleosome histone complexes, transcription pre-initiation complex members, and enhancer-binding proteins. The pre-replication complex, which assembles at replication origins and is not part of active transcriptional chromatin in G1-arrested shmoo cells, will be least represented.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent dzzT:\nActive chromatin in shmoo (induced by mating pheromone) will be enriched for transcription‐related factors (pre‐initiation complex, enhancer complexes) and nucleosomes with active histone marks. In contrast, pre‐replication complexes (loaded at origins for S‐phase) are not associated with active transcription sites and would be least recovered by ChIP–MS targeting active chromatin.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent tmsD:\nThe goal is to identify proteins associated with active (transcriptionally active) chromatin in shmooing yeast. Active chromatin will be occupied by transcription machinery (pre‐initiation complexes at promoters), enhancer complexes, and nucleosomes (histones). Pre‐replication complexes (ORC, Cdc6, Cdt1, MCM) load at origins prior to S phase, not typically associated with active transcription regions. Therefore, these will be least observed in a chromatin IP targeting transcriptionally active regions.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent 6XrI:\nThe user treated yeast with a peptide and is examining active chromatin in shmoo cells by ChIP-MS. Active chromatin will be enriched for transcription-related complexes (pre‐initiation complex at promoters, enhancer‐binding proteins/mediators at regulatory elements) and nucleosomes (histones) since histone modifications and nucleosome remodeling accompany active transcription. In contrast, pre‐replication complexes load at origins of replication during G1 to license DNA synthesis; they are not generally associated with actively transcribed chromatin regions in arrested shmoo cells. Therefore, pre‐replication complex proteins would be least recovered in an assay targeting active chromatin.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent fBw6:\nB)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent dzzT:\nB)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent tmsD:\nB)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 6XrI:\nB)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
