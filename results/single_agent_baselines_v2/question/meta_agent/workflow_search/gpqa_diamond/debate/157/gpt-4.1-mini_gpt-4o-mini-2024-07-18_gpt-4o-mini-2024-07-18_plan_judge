Question: Example(question='In an inactive state, a transcription factor subunit awaits an activation signal from the membrane phosphorylation cascade. Upon phosphorylation on the Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, shuttles into the nucleus, and serves in gene transcription. A missense mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. You observe that a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Which of the following molecular phenotypes is most likely observed in the presence of mutation Y?', choice1='loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype', choice2='protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype', choice3='protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele', choice4='change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: In this scenario, we have a transcription factor that requires dimerization for its function. The presence of a recessive loss-of-function mutation X in the transactivation domain suggests that this domain is crucial for the normal function of the transcription factor. The heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation, meaning it interferes with the function of the wild-type allele when both are present. This interference typically results in a loss of function due to the inability to form effective dimers. Therefore, the most likely molecular phenotype observed in the presence of mutation Y is that the wild-type allele's function is compromised due to the dominant-negative effect, leading to a loss-of-function phenotype. The option that best describes this outcome is 'protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele.'
