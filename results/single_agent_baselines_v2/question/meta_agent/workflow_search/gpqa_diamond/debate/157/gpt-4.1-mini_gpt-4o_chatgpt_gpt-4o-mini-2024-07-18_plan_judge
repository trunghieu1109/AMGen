Question: Example(question='In an inactive state, a transcription factor subunit awaits an activation signal from the membrane phosphorylation cascade. Upon phosphorylation on the Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, shuttles into the nucleus, and serves in gene transcription. A missense mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. You observe that a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Which of the following molecular phenotypes is most likely observed in the presence of mutation Y?', choice1='loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype', choice2='protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype', choice3='protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele', choice4='change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The question involves understanding the effects of a dominant-negative mutation in the dimerization domain of a transcription factor. A dominant-negative mutation typically results in a mutant protein that can interfere with the function of the wild-type protein, often by forming non-functional complexes. Since mutation Y is in the dimerization domain and acts dominantly, it likely affects the ability of the protein to dimerize properly. This could lead to the formation of non-functional dimers or aggregates, preventing the wild-type protein from functioning correctly. The most likely molecular phenotype observed would involve some form of interference with normal protein function, such as aggregation, leading to a loss-of-function phenotype. Therefore, the option 'protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype' best describes the expected outcome of a dominant-negative mutation in the dimerization domain.
