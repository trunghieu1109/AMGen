Question: Example(question='There has been an outbreak of an viral infectious disease in your city. You have been asked to design a molecular diagnostic kit for quick detection of this retrovirus. How would you go about designing this kit?', choice1='First you identify the virus by performing DNA sequencing. You then develop a PCR kit for  quick and accurate diagnosis', choice2='First you identify the IgG antibodies for the infection. You then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG antibodies for quick \n and accurate diagnosis.', choice3='First you identify the virus using the information about the symptoms, provided by the affected patients. You then design a nested PCR kit based on the information for quick diagnosis.', choice4='First you identify the virus by performing cDNA sequencing.  You then develop a real time PCR kit for quick and accurate diagnosis.', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To design a molecular diagnostic kit for a retrovirus, the most effective approach is to identify the viral RNA, convert it to complementary DNA (cDNA), and then use a real-time PCR method for amplification and detection. This method is specific to the virus and allows for quick and accurate diagnosis, making it suitable for outbreaks. The best choice is the one that mentions cDNA sequencing and real-time PCR, which is choice D.
