Question: Example(question='There has been an outbreak of an viral infectious disease in your city. You have been asked to design a molecular diagnostic kit for quick detection of this retrovirus. How would you go about designing this kit?', choice1='First you identify the virus by performing DNA sequencing. You then develop a PCR kit for  quick and accurate diagnosis', choice2='First you identify the IgG antibodies for the infection. You then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG antibodies for quick \n and accurate diagnosis.', choice3='First you identify the virus using the information about the symptoms, provided by the affected patients. You then design a nested PCR kit based on the information for quick diagnosis.', choice4='First you identify the virus by performing cDNA sequencing.  You then develop a real time PCR kit for quick and accurate diagnosis.', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: All agents agree that for a retrovirus, which has an RNA genome, the appropriate method to identify the virus is through cDNA sequencing. This is because retroviruses reverse transcribe their RNA into DNA, and sequencing the cDNA allows for accurate identification of the viral genetic material. Once the virus is identified, developing a real-time PCR kit is the most suitable approach for quick and accurate diagnosis due to its sensitivity and ability to quantify viral load. Option 4 aligns with this approach, making it the most appropriate choice.
