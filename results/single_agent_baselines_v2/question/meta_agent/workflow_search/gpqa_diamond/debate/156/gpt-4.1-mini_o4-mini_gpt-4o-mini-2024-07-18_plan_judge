Question: Example(question='There has been an outbreak of an viral infectious disease in your city. You have been asked to design a molecular diagnostic kit for quick detection of this retrovirus. How would you go about designing this kit?', choice1='First you identify the virus by performing DNA sequencing. You then develop a PCR kit for  quick and accurate diagnosis', choice2='First you identify the IgG antibodies for the infection. You then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG antibodies for quick \n and accurate diagnosis.', choice3='First you identify the virus using the information about the symptoms, provided by the affected patients. You then design a nested PCR kit based on the information for quick diagnosis.', choice4='First you identify the virus by performing cDNA sequencing.  You then develop a real time PCR kit for quick and accurate diagnosis.', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: Retroviruses have RNA genomes, so initial identification requires reverse transcription of viral RNA into cDNA and sequencing to obtain specific viral sequence information. Once the sequence is known, designing primers and probes for a quantitative real‐time PCR assay allows rapid, sensitive, and specific detection of the virus in patient samples. Choices 1 and 3 ignore the RNA nature of retroviruses or rely on less accurate symptom‐based inference; choice 2 targets host antibodies, which appear later and are not suitable for early molecular diagnosis. Therefore, the optimal approach is choice 4.
