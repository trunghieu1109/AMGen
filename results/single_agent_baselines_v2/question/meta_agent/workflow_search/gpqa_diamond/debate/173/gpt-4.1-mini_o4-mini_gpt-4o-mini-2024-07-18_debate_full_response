It splits into two fragments with m1=2 m2 and m1+m2=0.99 M ⇒ m1=198 GeV, m2=99 GeV. The Q‐value is (M–(m1+m2))c²=0.01·300 GeV=3 GeV, all going to kinetic energy. In the relativistic two‐body decay p = √[(M²−(m1+m2)²)(M²−(m1−m2)²)]/(2M) ≈ 19.98 GeV. Then T1,rel = √(m1²+p²) – m1 ≈1.005 GeV. The nonrelativistic T1,class = p²/(2m1) ≈1.0076 GeV. Their difference ≈2.5 MeV, i.e. about 2 MeV.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent 56D6:\nInitial nucleus: M=300 GeV. Fragments have rest masses M1=2/3·0.99M=198 GeV and M2=1/3·0.99M=99 GeV. Mass defect Q=M−(M1+M2)=3 GeV. Relativistic KE of fragment 1: E1=(M²+M1²−M2²)/(2M)=(300²+198²−99²)/(600)=199.005 GeV ⇒ T1_rel=E1−M1≈1.005 GeV. Classical KE partition: T1_cl=Q·M2/(M1+M2)=3·99/297=1.000 GeV. Difference ≈0.005 GeV=5 MeV.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent YWUl:\nInitial nucleus at rest has rest energy Mc^2=300 GeV. Masses after fission: m1=2m2 and m1+m2=0.99M ⇒ m1=0.66M, m2=0.33M. The Q-value is (M−m1−m2)c^2=0.01M c^2=3 GeV. Relativistic two-body decay gives T1_rel = [(M^2 + m1^2 − m2^2)/(2M) − m1]c^2 = (0.00335 M)c^2 =1.005 GeV. Non-relativistically T1_cl = Q·m2/(m1+m2)=3 GeV·0.33/0.99=1.000 GeV. Difference =5 MeV.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent IA6k:\nInitial mass M = 300 GeV/c^2, fragments have rest masses m1=2x, m2=x, with 3x=0.99M so x=0.33M. Thus m1=0.67M≈200 GeV/c^2, m2≈100 GeV/c^2. Energy released Q=(M-(m1+m2))c^2=0.01M c^2=3 GeV goes into kinetic energy. Non-relativistically, kinetic energy divides as T1_NR=Q·m2/(m1+m2)=3GeV·(0.33)/(0.99)=1GeV. The heavier fragment speed satisfies ½m1v^2=1GeV ⇒ v^2/c^2≈0.01. Exact relativistic KE T1_rel=(γ−1)m1c^2≈½m1v^2 +3/8 m1v^4/c^2=1GeV + (3/8)·200GeV·(0.01)^2 ≈1GeV +7.5MeV. Thus difference T1_rel−T1_NR≈7.5MeV, rounding gives ≈10MeV.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent aich:\nC)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 56D6:\nB)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent YWUl:\nB)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent IA6k:\nA)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
