Question: Example(question='An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. A spontaneous fission occurs in which it splits into two fragments (and nothing else), such that one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other (in terms of their rest-masses). The sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. \n\nKinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?\n\n(Ignore the electrons.)', choice1='10 MeV.', choice2='5 MeV.', choice3='2 MeV.', choice4='20 MeV.', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To determine the difference between the relativistic kinetic energy of the more massive fragment and the classical kinetic energy calculated using non-relativistic approximation, we first analyze the fission process. The initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus is 300 GeV, and after fission, the fragments have a combined rest mass of 99% of M. The masses of the fragments are found to be 0.33M and 0.66M. Using conservation of momentum and energy, we calculate the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) in both relativistic and classical contexts. After performing the necessary calculations, the difference between the two kinetic energy values is found to be 10 MeV. Therefore, the correct answer is 10 MeV.

Answer:10 MeV.
Extracted answer: 10 MeV.
Correct answer: 2
