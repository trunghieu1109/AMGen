Question: Example(question='An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. A spontaneous fission occurs in which it splits into two fragments (and nothing else), such that one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other (in terms of their rest-masses). The sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. \n\nKinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?\n\n(Ignore the electrons.)', choice1='10 MeV.', choice2='5 MeV.', choice3='2 MeV.', choice4='20 MeV.', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: Initial nucleus rest energy Mc²=300 GeV splits into fragments of masses m1=2m2, with m1+m2=0.99M ⇒ m1=198 GeV, m2=99 GeV. The Q-value is Q=(M−(m1+m2))c²=3 GeV. 

Classical (non-relativistic) approximation: conservation of momentum and KE ⇒ T1_class = Q·m2/(m1+m2)=3 GeV·(99/297)=1.000 GeV.

Relativistic kinematics: both fragments share momentum p given by two-body decay,
p = √[(M²−(m1+m2)²)(M²−(m1−m2)²)]/(2M) ≈19.975 GeV.
Then T1_rel = √(m1²+p²)−m1 ≈1.005 GeV.

Difference Δ = T1_rel − T1_class ≈0.005 GeV =5 MeV.
