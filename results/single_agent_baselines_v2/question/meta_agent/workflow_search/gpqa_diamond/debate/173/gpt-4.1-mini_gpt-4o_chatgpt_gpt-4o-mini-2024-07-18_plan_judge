Question: Example(question='An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. A spontaneous fission occurs in which it splits into two fragments (and nothing else), such that one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other (in terms of their rest-masses). The sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. \n\nKinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?\n\n(Ignore the electrons.)', choice1='10 MeV.', choice2='5 MeV.', choice3='2 MeV.', choice4='20 MeV.', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The problem involves calculating the kinetic energy difference for a fission event using both relativistic and classical approaches. The initial rest-mass energy is 300 GeV, and after fission, the rest-mass energy of the fragments is 297 GeV, leaving 3 GeV as kinetic energy. The mass ratio of the fragments is 2:1. The classical approximation distributes kinetic energy based on mass ratio, but relativistic effects can cause a small difference. Most agents calculated the difference to be 10 MeV, which aligns with typical small relativistic corrections. Therefore, the most consistent answer is 10 MeV.
