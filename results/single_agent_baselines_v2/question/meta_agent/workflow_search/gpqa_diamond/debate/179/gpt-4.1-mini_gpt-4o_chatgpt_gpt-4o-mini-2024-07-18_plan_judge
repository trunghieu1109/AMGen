Question: Example(question='Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are\nconstrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system\ncorrect to three decimals?', choice1='2.822 x 10^-26', choice2='5.645 x 10^-26', choice3='7.056 x 10^-27', choice4='122.330', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: All agents agree on the method to calculate the potential energy of the system, which involves using the formula U = k * q1 * q2 / r for each pair of charges. The charges are 2e each, and the distance is 2 m. The total energy is 12 times the energy of one pair since there are 12 such pairs. The calculations by agents cZcI and UN6v both result in the same numerical answer, 5.645 x 10^-26, which matches choice B). Therefore, the correct answer is B).
