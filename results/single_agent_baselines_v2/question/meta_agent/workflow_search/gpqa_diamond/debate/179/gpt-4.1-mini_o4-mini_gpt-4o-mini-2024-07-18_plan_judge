Question: Example(question='Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are\nconstrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system\ncorrect to three decimals?', choice1='2.822 x 10^-26', choice2='5.645 x 10^-26', choice3='7.056 x 10^-27', choice4='122.330', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: Total energy U = U_center–shell + U_shell–shell. Central–shell: 12 charges at distance R=2 m from central charge q=2e gives U_cs = 12·k·(2e)^2/R ≃5.54×10^–27 J. Shell–shell: 12 charges minimize energy at vertices of regular icosahedron; summing 30 edge, 30 second‐neighbor, 6 antipodal pairs gives U_ss ≃2.268×10^–26 J. Total U ≃2.822×10^–26 J, matching choice A).
