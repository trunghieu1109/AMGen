Question: Example(question='Imagine an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ having a small spherical cavity inside. The centre of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the centre of the spherical conductor. The radius of the cavity is $r$, and $r<R$. Now consider a small amount of positive charge $+q$ is somehow placed somewhere inside the cavity. What is the magnitude of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at a point P (outside the spherical conductor) of distance $L$ from the centre of the spherical conductor? Note, the distance of the point P from the centre of the cavity is $l$. Here, l, L > R. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\\theta$\n', choice1='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n', choice2='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n', choice3='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\n', choice4='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: When a charge +q is placed inside the cavity of a conductor, it induces a charge of -q on the inner surface of the cavity and a charge of +q on the outer surface of the conductor. Due to the spherical symmetry of the outer surface, the electric field at any point outside the conductor depends only on the total charge enclosed, which is +q, and not on the position of the charge inside the cavity. Therefore, the electric field at a point outside the conductor is determined by the charge +q as if it were at the center of the conductor. The distance from the center of the conductor to the point P is L, so the electric field is given by Coulomb's law for a point charge at that distance.
