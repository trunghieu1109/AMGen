    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Imagine an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ having a small spherical cavity inside. The centre of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the centre of the spherical conductor. The radius of the cavity is $r$, and $r&lt;R$. Now consider a small amount of positive charge $+q$ is somehow placed somewhere inside the cavity. What is the magnitude of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at a point P (outside the spherical conductor) of distance $L$ from the centre of the spherical conductor? Note, the distance of the point P from the centre of the cavity is $l$. Here, l, L &gt; R. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\\theta$\n&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\n&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent uh70:
A charge +q inside the cavity induces –q on the inner surface and +q on the outer surface. The conductor shields the cavity field, but outside the conductor the net field is as if all charge +q resides at the centre. By Gauss’s law, E at distance L is q/(4πε₀L²).

### thinking by Debate Agent z13v:
We have an uncharged conducting sphere with an off‐centre cavity containing a point charge +q. Charges induced on the inner cavity wall sum to –q and on the outer surface sum to +q. By Gauss’s law, the field outside a conductor depends only on the net enclosed charge on the outer surface, which is +q, as if concentrated at the centre of the conductor. Hence at distance L&gt;R, E = (1/4πε0) q/L^2.

### thinking by Debate Agent FuR4:
For a conductor with an off-center cavity containing charge +q, induced charges appear on cavity walls and outer surface so that field inside conductor material is zero. Outside the conductor, the net effect is as if the entire charge +q were concentrated at the conductor’s center, regardless of the cavity’s offset. Hence at a distance L from the conductor center, E = q/(4πε₀L²).

### thinking by Debate Agent 9Us2:
We have an uncharged conducting sphere with an off-center cavity containing charge +q. Any point outside a conductor sees the induced charges distributed so that the net external effect is as if the total enclosed charge resides at the conductor’s center. Here the conductor plus cavity system has net charge +q, so the external field is radial from the sphere’s center with magnitude E = (1/(4πε0))·q/L^2, independent of cavity geometry or the charge’s position inside. Thus the correct choice is 4 (D).
