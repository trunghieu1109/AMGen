    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Imagine an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ having a small spherical cavity inside. The centre of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the centre of the spherical conductor. The radius of the cavity is $r$, and $r&lt;R$. Now consider a small amount of positive charge $+q$ is somehow placed somewhere inside the cavity. What is the magnitude of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at a point P (outside the spherical conductor) of distance $L$ from the centre of the spherical conductor? Note, the distance of the point P from the centre of the cavity is $l$. Here, l, L &gt; R. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\\theta$\n&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\n&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent uh70:
When a charge +q is placed inside the cavity of a conductor, it induces a charge of -q on the inner surface of the cavity and a charge of +q on the outer surface of the conductor. Due to the spherical symmetry of the outer surface, the electric field at any point outside the conductor depends only on the total charge enclosed, which is +q, and not on the position of the charge inside the cavity. Therefore, the electric field at a point outside the conductor is determined by the charge +q as if it were at the center of the conductor. The distance from the center of the conductor to the point P is L, so the electric field is given by Coulomb&#39;s law for a point charge at that distance.

### thinking by Debate Agent z13v:
When a charge +q is placed inside the cavity of a conductor, it induces an equal and opposite charge on the inner surface of the cavity. The outer surface of the conductor will have a charge +q due to the conservation of charge. Since the outer surface is spherical and the charge is uniformly distributed, the electric field at any point outside the conductor depends only on the total charge on the conductor (which is +q) and the distance from the center of the conductor. The electric field due to a spherically symmetric charge distribution outside the sphere is as if all the charge is concentrated at the center. Therefore, the electric field at a point P outside the spherical conductor is determined by the total charge +q and the distance L from the center of the spherical conductor.

### thinking by Debate Agent FuR4:
When a charge +q is placed inside the cavity of a conductor, the charges on the conductor rearrange such that the electric field inside the conductor&#39;s material is zero. The conductor itself will have an induced charge of -q on the inner surface of the cavity and a charge +q on the outer surface. For a point outside the conductor, by Gauss&#39;s law, the electric field is as if all the charge +q is concentrated at the center of the conductor. Therefore, the electric field at a point outside the conductor depends only on the total charge +q and the distance from the center of the conductor.

### thinking by Debate Agent 9Us2:
When a charge is placed inside the cavity of a conductor, it induces an equal and opposite charge on the inner surface of the cavity. However, the outer surface of the conductor remains neutral due to the shielding effect. Thus, the induced charges on the inner surface do not affect the electric field outside the conductor. The electric field at a point outside the conductor only depends on the net charge enclosed by the entire conductor. Since the conductor as a whole is neutral, the field outside is only due to the charge inside the cavity, as if it were a point charge at the center of the conductor. Thus, the field at point P is equivalent to the field due to a point charge +q at the center of the conductor, and it depends on the distance L from the center of the conductor.
