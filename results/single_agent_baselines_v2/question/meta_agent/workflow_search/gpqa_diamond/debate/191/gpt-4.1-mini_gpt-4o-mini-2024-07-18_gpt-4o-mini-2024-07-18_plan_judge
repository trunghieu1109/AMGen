Question: Example(question='Imagine an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ having a small spherical cavity inside. The centre of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the centre of the spherical conductor. The radius of the cavity is $r$, and $r<R$. Now consider a small amount of positive charge $+q$ is somehow placed somewhere inside the cavity. What is the magnitude of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at a point P (outside the spherical conductor) of distance $L$ from the centre of the spherical conductor? Note, the distance of the point P from the centre of the cavity is $l$. Here, l, L > R. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\\theta$\n', choice1='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n', choice2='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n', choice3='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\n', choice4='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: In this scenario, we have a spherical conductor with a charge placed inside a cavity. According to Gauss's law, the electric field outside a conductor behaves as if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the conductor. Since the conductor is uncharged, the charge inside the cavity will induce an equal and opposite charge on the inner surface of the conductor, but the outer surface remains neutral. Therefore, when calculating the electric field at point P outside the conductor, we only need to consider the charge +q as if it were located at the center of the conductor. The distance from the center of the conductor to point P is L, so the electric field can be expressed as E = (1/(4πε₀))(q/L²). Thus, the correct answer is choice 4.
