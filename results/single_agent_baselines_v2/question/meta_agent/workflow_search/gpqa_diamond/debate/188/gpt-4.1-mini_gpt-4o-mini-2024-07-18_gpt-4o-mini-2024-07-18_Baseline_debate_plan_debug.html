### thinking by Debate Agent X7g2:
To determine which particle is not associated with spontaneously-broken symmetry, we need to analyze each option. Magnons are collective excitations in a magnetically ordered system and are related to broken symmetry. Skyrmions are topological solitons that arise in systems with spontaneous symmetry breaking. Pions are the lightest mesons and are associated with the breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics. Phonons, on the other hand, are quantized sound waves in a medium and do not specifically relate to spontaneously-broken symmetry. Therefore, the answer is Phonon.

### thinking by Debate Agent dSbA:
To determine which of the given particles is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry, we need to analyze each option. Magnons are associated with the spontaneous breaking of rotational symmetry in magnetic systems. Skyrmions are topological solitons that arise in the context of chiral spin systems, which also involve broken symmetries. Pions are associated with the breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics. Phonons, however, are quantized modes of vibrations in a lattice and do not directly arise from a spontaneously-broken symmetry. Therefore, phonons are the particle that is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry.

### thinking by Debate Agent 1y5S:
To determine which particle is not associated with spontaneously-broken symmetry, we need to analyze the nature of each particle listed. Magnons are excitations in a magnetically ordered state and are associated with broken symmetry. Skyrmions are topological solitons in field theories that also relate to spontaneous symmetry breaking. Pions are the Nambu-Goldstone bosons resulting from the breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics, thus also connected to spontaneous symmetry breaking. Phonons, however, are quantized modes of vibrations in a lattice and do not directly arise from a spontaneously broken symmetry. Therefore, the particle that does not fit the criteria is the phonon.

### thinking by Debate Agent Lkvz:
To determine which particle is not associated with spontaneously-broken symmetry, we need to consider the nature of each particle. Magnons are associated with the magnetic order and spontaneous symmetry breaking in magnetic systems. Skyrmions are topological solitons that also arise in systems with spontaneous symmetry breaking. Pions are the Goldstone bosons associated with the breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics. Phonons, however, are quantized modes of vibrations in a crystal lattice and do not arise from a spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism. Therefore, phonons are the particles that are not associated with spontaneously-broken symmetry.
