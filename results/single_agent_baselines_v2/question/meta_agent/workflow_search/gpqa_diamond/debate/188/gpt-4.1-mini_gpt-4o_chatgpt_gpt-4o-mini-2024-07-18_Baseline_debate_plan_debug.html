### thinking by Debate Agent ctX7:
To solve this question, we need to analyze each particle and its association with spontaneously-broken symmetries. A magnon is a quasiparticle associated with the collective excitation of electron spins in a crystal lattice, often linked to broken spin rotational symmetry. A skyrmion is a topological soliton that can occur in magnetic systems and is also related to broken symmetries but not necessarily spontaneously broken ones. A pion is a meson that arises as a Goldstone boson from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics. A phonon is a quantized mode of vibration occurring in a rigid crystal lattice, typically associated with lattice translational symmetry but not a spontaneously-broken symmetry. Therefore, the phonon is the particle that is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry.

### thinking by Debate Agent g2dS:
To determine which particle is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry, we need to consider the nature of each particle: 1) Magnon is a quasiparticle associated with the collective excitation of electron spins in a lattice, related to the broken symmetry of spin alignment. 2) Skyrmion is a topological soliton which can be associated with broken symmetries in certain contexts, but it is not typically described as arising from spontaneous symmetry breaking. 3) Pion is a pseudo-Goldstone boson resulting from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics. 4) Phonon is a quasiparticle representing lattice vibrations, associated with broken translational symmetry. Thus, Skyrmion is the least directly associated with spontaneously-broken symmetry.

### thinking by Debate Agent bA1y:
To solve this, we need to consider each particle&#39;s association with spontaneously-broken symmetries. A magnon is a quasiparticle associated with the collective excitation in a periodic lattice of spins and is related to spontaneously broken symmetry in magnetically ordered systems. A skyrmion is a topological soliton that can occur in ferromagnets, also related to broken symmetries. A pion is a meson that arises due to the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics. A phonon is a quantized mode of vibration occurring in a rigid crystal lattice, which is not directly related to spontaneously broken symmetry but rather to lattice vibrations. Therefore, the phonon is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry.

### thinking by Debate Agent 5SLk:
To determine which particle is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry, let&#39;s analyze each option: 
1. Magnon: Arises in systems with broken spin rotational symmetry, such as ferromagnets, thus it is associated with spontaneously-broken symmetry.
2. Skyrmion: These are topological solitons that can arise in field theories with broken symmetries, such as in certain condensed matter systems.
3. Pion: In the context of particle physics, pions are associated with the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics (QCD).
4. Phonon: These are quantized modes of vibrations in a crystal lattice and are not directly associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry.
Therefore, the particle not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry is the phonon.

    <pre>The question asks which particle is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry. Analyzing the options: Magnons are associated with broken spin rotational symmetry, Skyrmions are topological solitons that can be related to broken symmetries, Pions are Goldstone bosons from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry, and Phonons are quantized lattice vibrations not directly linked to spontaneously-broken symmetry. Most agents agree that Phonons are not associated with spontaneously-broken symmetry, while one agent suggests Skyrmions. However, the majority consensus and reasoning indicate that Phonons are the correct choice.
