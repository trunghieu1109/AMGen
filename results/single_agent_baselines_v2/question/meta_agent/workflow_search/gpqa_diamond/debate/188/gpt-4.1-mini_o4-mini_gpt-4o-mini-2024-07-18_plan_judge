Question: Example(question='Which of the following (effective) particles is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry?', choice1='Magnon', choice2='Skyrmion', choice3='Pion', choice4='Phonon', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: Magnons, pions, and phonons are Goldstone bosons arising from spontaneous breaking of spin-rotation, chiral, and translational symmetries, respectively, whereas skyrmions are topological solitons, not Goldstone modes of a broken symmetry.

Answer:B)
Extracted answer: B)
Correct answer: 2
