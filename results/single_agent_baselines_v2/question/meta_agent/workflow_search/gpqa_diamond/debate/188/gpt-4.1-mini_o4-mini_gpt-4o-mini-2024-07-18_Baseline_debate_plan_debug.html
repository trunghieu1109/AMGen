### thinking by Debate Agent ctX7:
The question asks which of the listed particles is not associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry. Magnons are Goldstone bosons from broken spin-rotation symmetry in magnets. Pions are Goldstone bosons from broken chiral symmetry in QCD. Phonons are Goldstone bosons from broken translational symmetry in crystals. Skyrmions, however, are topological solitons rather than Goldstone modes of a broken continuous symmetry. Therefore, the correct choice is Skyrmion.

### thinking by Debate Agent g2dS:
Magnons arise as Goldstone bosons of spontaneously broken spin-rotation symmetry in ferromagnets. Phonons are Goldstone bosons of broken translational symmetry in crystals. Pions are (pseudo-)Goldstone bosons of the spontaneously broken chiral symmetry in QCD. Skyrmions, however, are topological solitons and are not associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry.

### thinking by Debate Agent bA1y:
Magnons are Nambu–Goldstone bosons arising from spontaneous breaking of spin-rotational symmetry in magnets; phonons arise from spontaneous breaking of continuous translation symmetry in crystals; pions are (pseudo) Nambu–Goldstone bosons from spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in QCD. Skyrmions, however, are topological solitons rather than Goldstone modes of a spontaneously broken continuous symmetry.

### thinking by Debate Agent 5SLk:
We examine each effective particle and check if it is tied to a spontaneously broken symmetry:

1. Magnon: A magnon is the Goldstone boson arising from the spontaneous breaking of spin-rotation symmetry in a magnet.  
2. Pion: Pions are (pseudo-)Goldstone bosons from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in QCD.  
3. Phonon: Phonons are the Goldstone bosons from the spontaneous breaking of continuous translational symmetry in a crystal lattice.  
4. Skyrmion: A skyrmion is a topological soliton—an extended, stable spin texture—not a Goldstone mode arising from spontaneous symmetry breaking.

Thus the skyrmion is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry.
