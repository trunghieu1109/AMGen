Question: Example(question='Which of the following (effective) particles is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry?', choice1='Magnon', choice2='Skyrmion', choice3='Pion', choice4='Phonon', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To determine which particle is not associated with spontaneously-broken symmetry, we analyze each option. Magnons are related to broken symmetry in magnetic systems, Skyrmions arise in contexts of spontaneous symmetry breaking, and Pions are associated with the breaking of chiral symmetry. Phonons, however, are quantized sound waves in a medium and do not specifically relate to spontaneously-broken symmetry. Therefore, the answer is Phonon.
