In a flat ΛCDM cosmology with H₀=70 km/s/Mpc, Ωₘ=0.3, Ω_Λ=0.7, the comoving distance to z≈5.5 is about 8–9 Gpc. Among the choices, 8 Gpc is closest.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent fldN:\nThe drop at observed λ≈790\u2009nm corresponds to the Lyman-α break (121.6\u2009nm rest). 1+z≈790/121.6≈6.5 ⇒ z≈5.5. In a flat ΛCDM (H0=70, Ωm=0.3, ΩΛ=0.7), the comoving distance to z≈5.5 is ≈7.8\u2009Gpc, i.e. about 8\u2009Gpc.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent kLLR:\nThe observed sharp drop in flux at wavelengths shorter than 790 nm indicates the redshifted Lyman-α forest edge at 121.6 nm. Solving z = (λ_obs/λ_emit) – 1 = (790 nm / 121.6 nm) – 1 ≈ 5.5. The comoving distance for a flat ΛCDM universe with H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc, Ωm = 0.3, ΩΛ = 0.7 at z ≈ 5.5 is approximately 8 Gpc.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent Fr2v:\nFirst, the sharp drop at λ<790\u2009nm is the Lyman-α break (rest 121.6\u2009nm) redshifted: z ≃(790/121.6)–1 ≃5.5. In a flat ΛCDM universe with H0=70\u2009km/s/Mpc, Ωm=0.3, ΩΛ=0.7, the comoving distance to z≈5.5 is ≃7.7\u2009Gpc, i.e. about 8\u2009Gpc.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent Kdyo:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent fldN:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent kLLR:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent Fr2v:\nA)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
