proposed answer: The Lagrangian involves fermion fields \(\psi\), the electromagnetic field tensor \(F^{\mu\nu}\), and the coupling constant \(\kappa\). In natural units, the mass dimension of a fermion field \([\psi]_M\) is \(\frac{3}{2}\), the mass dimension of \(F^{\mu\nu}\) is 2, and \(\sigma_{\mu\nu}\) is dimensionless. The mass dimension of the Lagrangian density \([\mathcal{L}]_M\) is 4. Therefore, the mass dimension of \(\kappa\) can be calculated as follows: \([\kappa]_M + 2[\psi]_M + [F^{\mu\nu}]_M = 4\). Substituting the known values, we get \([\kappa]_M + 2(\frac{3}{2}) + 2 = 4\). Solving this gives \([\kappa]_M = -1\). Since the mass dimension of the coupling constant \(\kappa\) is negative, the theory is not renormalizable. All agents agree on this reasoning.
