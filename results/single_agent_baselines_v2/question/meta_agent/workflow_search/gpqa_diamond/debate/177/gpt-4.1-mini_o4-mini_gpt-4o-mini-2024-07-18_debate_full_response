The fermion field ψ has dimension 3/2, so ψ̄ψ contributes 3. F_{μν} has dimension 2. Thus L_int has dimension [κ] + 3 + 2 = [κ] + 5, which must equal 4. Hence [κ] = -1. A coupling with negative mass dimension is nonrenormalizable.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent xWMy:\nIn 4D the Lagrangian density has mass dimension 4. The fermion field ψ has dimension 3/2, σ_{μν} is dimensionless, and F^{μν} has dimension 2. Thus the operator ψ̄σψ\u2009F has dimension 3+2=5. To make the interaction term dimension 4, κ must have mass dimension 4−5=−1. A coupling with negative mass dimension signals a nonrenormalizable interaction.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent 2cCZ:\nWe have L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Dimension of ψ is 3/2, of F^{μν} is 2, σ_{μν} is dimensionless. Total from fields = 3/2 + 3/2 + 2 = 5. Lagrangian density must have dimension 4, so [κ] + 5 = 4 ⇒ [κ] = -1. A coupling of negative mass dimension indicates a nonrenormalizable interaction.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent hSub:\nIn four dimensions the interaction Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4. The fermion field ψ has dimension 3/2 and F^{μν} has dimension 2. Thus κ+3/2+3/2+2=4 ⇒ κ has dimension −1. A coupling with negative mass dimension leads to nonrenormalizability.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent bapV:\nC)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent xWMy:\nC)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 2cCZ:\nC)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent hSub:\nC)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
