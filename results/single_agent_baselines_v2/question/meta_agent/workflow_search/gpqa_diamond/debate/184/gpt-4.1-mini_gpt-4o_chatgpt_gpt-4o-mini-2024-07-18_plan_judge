proposed answer: The Hamiltonian operator is given as $H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma}.\vec{n}$, where $\vec{\sigma}$ are the Pauli matrices and $\vec{n}$ is a unit vector. The dot product $\vec{\sigma}.\vec{n}$ results in a matrix that has eigenvalues of +1 and -1, as it is a linear combination of the Pauli matrices. Therefore, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian $H$ are $\varepsilon$ times the eigenvalues of $\vec{\sigma}.\vec{n}$, which are $+\varepsilon$ and $-\varepsilon$. All agents agree on this reasoning.
