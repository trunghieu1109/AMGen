The operator σ·n has eigenvalues ±1 since σ·n is a Pauli matrix in some direction. Thus H’s eigenvalues are ε×(±1)=±ε. This matches choice1.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent 7Dc4:\nThe operator σ·n has eigenvalues ±1 because (σ·n)^2 = I and σ·n is Hermitian. Multiplying by ε gives energy eigenvalues ±ε.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent Mrcx:\nThe Hamiltonian is H = ε σ·n. Since σ·n has eigenvalues ±1 (being a Pauli matrix in some direction), the eigenvalues of H are ±ε.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent jHjk:\nThe operator σ·n has eigenvalues ±1 since σ·n is a Pauli matrix along n.
