proposed answer: The Hamiltonian operator is given as H = ε σ·n, where σ are the Pauli matrices and n is a unit vector. The eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian can be determined from the properties of the Pauli matrices, which have eigenvalues of ±1. Since the Hamiltonian scales these eigenvalues by ε, the eigenvalues of H will be ±ε. Therefore, the correct choice is the one that corresponds to these eigenvalues.
