### thinking by Debate Agent OfZu:
The Hamiltonian operator is given as H = ε σ·n, where σ are the Pauli matrices and n is a unit vector. The eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian can be determined from the properties of the Pauli matrices, which have eigenvalues of ±1. Since the Hamiltonian scales these eigenvalues by ε, the eigenvalues of H will be ±ε. Therefore, the correct choice is the one that corresponds to these eigenvalues.

### thinking by Debate Agent 7Dc4:
The Hamiltonian operator given is of the form H = εσ·n, where σ are the Pauli matrices and n is a unit vector. The eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian can be determined by recognizing that the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues of ±1. Therefore, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian will be ±ε, since the energy scale ε is a constant multiplied by the eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices.

### thinking by Debate Agent Mrcx:
The Hamiltonian operator given is of the form H = ε σ·n, where σ represents the Pauli matrices and n is a unit vector. The eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian can be derived from the properties of the Pauli matrices. The eigenvalues of the operator σ·n are ±1, and since we multiply by the constant ε, the eigenvalues of H are ±ε. Therefore, the correct choice that reflects the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator is +ε and -ε.

### thinking by Debate Agent jHjk:
The Hamiltonian operator given is of the form H = ε σ·n, where σ are the Pauli matrices and n is a unit vector. The eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian related to the Pauli matrices can be determined by recognizing that the eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices are ±1. Therefore, the eigenvalues of H would be obtained by multiplying the eigenvalues of σ (which are ±1) by the constant ε. This leads to the eigenvalues being ±ε.

### answer by Debate Agent OfZu:
+ \varepsilon, -\varepsilon

### answer by Debate Agent 7Dc4:
+ \varepsilon, -\varepsilon

### answer by Debate Agent Mrcx:
+ \varepsilon, -\varepsilon

### answer by Debate Agent jHjk:
+ \varepsilon, -\varepsilon
