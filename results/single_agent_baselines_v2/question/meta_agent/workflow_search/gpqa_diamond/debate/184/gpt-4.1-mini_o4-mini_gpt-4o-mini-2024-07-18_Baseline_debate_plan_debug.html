    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Consider a system with Hamiltonian operator $H = \\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n}$. Here, $\\vec{n}$ is an arbitrary unit vector, $\\varepsilon $ is a constant of dimension energy, and components of $\\vec{\\sigma}$ are the Pauli spin matrices. What are the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator?\n&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;+ \\varepsilon, -\\varepsilon\n&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;+\\varepsilon \\hbar/2, - \\varepsilon \\hbar/2&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;+1, -1&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;+\\hbar/2, -\\hbar/2&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent OfZu:
The Hamiltonian is H = ε σ·n. The operator σ·n has eigenvalues ±1 since σ·n is a Pauli matrix in some direction. Thus H’s eigenvalues are ε×(±1)=±ε. This matches choice1.

### thinking by Debate Agent 7Dc4:
The operator σ·n has eigenvalues ±1 because (σ·n)^2 = I and σ·n is Hermitian. Multiplying by ε gives energy eigenvalues ±ε.

### thinking by Debate Agent Mrcx:
The Hamiltonian is H = ε σ·n. Since σ·n has eigenvalues ±1 (being a Pauli matrix in some direction), the eigenvalues of H are ±ε.

### thinking by Debate Agent jHjk:
The operator σ·n has eigenvalues ±1 since σ·n is a Pauli matrix along n. Multiplying by ε gives eigenvalues ±ε.

### answer by Debate Agent OfZu:
A)
