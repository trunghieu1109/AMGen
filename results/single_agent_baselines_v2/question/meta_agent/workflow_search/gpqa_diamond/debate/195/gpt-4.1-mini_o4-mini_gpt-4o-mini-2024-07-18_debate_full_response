At x=0, all energy is kinetic plus rest, so γ_max m c^2 = E, giving γ_max = 1 + (kA^2)/(2m c^2). Then v_max follows from γ = 1/√(1−v^2/c^2), so v_max=c√[1−1/γ_max^2] = c√[1−1/(1+kA^2/(2mc^2))^2], which is choice 2.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent Hj0Z:\nWe use conservation of energy in relativity: total energy E = γmc² + ½kx². At turning point x = A, v = 0 ⇒ E = mc² + ½kA². At x = 0, potential = 0, speed = vmax ⇒ E = γmax mc². Equate: γmax = 1 + kA²/(2mc²). Then vmax = c√(1 - 1/γmax²) = c√[1 - 1/(1 + kA²/(2mc²))²], which matches choice 2.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent ieey:\nFor a relativistic oscillator, total energy at amplitude A: E = m c^2 + ½ kA^2. At x=0, potential=0 so γm c^2 = E ⇒ γ = 1 + kA^2/(2mc^2). Then vmax = c√(1 − 1/γ^2) = c√[1 − 1/(1 + kA^2/(2mc^2))^2], which matches choice 2.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent 7Iqo:\nWe use energy conservation: at turning point x=A, kinetic energy is zero and potential energy U=kA^2/2, so total energy E=mc^2+U. At x=0, potential is zero and kinetic gives E=γmc^2, so γ=1+U/(mc^2)=1+kA^2/(2mc^2). Then v_max follows from γ=1/√(1−v^2/c^2), giving v_max=c√[1−1/(1+kA^2/(2mc^2))^2].
