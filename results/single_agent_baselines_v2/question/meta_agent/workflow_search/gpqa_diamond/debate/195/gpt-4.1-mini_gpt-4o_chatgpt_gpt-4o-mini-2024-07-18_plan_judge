Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: All agents agree that the maximum speed of a relativistic harmonic oscillator can be found by equating the potential energy at maximum amplitude to the kinetic energy at maximum speed. The potential energy at maximum amplitude is (1/2)kA^2, and the kinetic energy in relativistic terms is given by (γ - 1)mc^2, where γ = 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2). Solving for v_max involves setting (γ - 1)mc^2 = (1/2)kA^2, which leads to γ = 1 + kA^2/(2mc^2). Solving for v_max gives v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + kA^2/(2mc^2))^2), which corresponds to choice 2.
