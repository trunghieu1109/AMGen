proposed answer: To determine the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2 given the metric, we analyze the metric which suggests a relationship between the coordinates and the area element. The area can be computed by integrating the area element derived from the metric over the appropriate domain. Since the metric has a factor that depends on (4 - x^2 - y^2), we need to evaluate the conditions under which this metric remains valid. Given that the radius is 2, we are looking at the region where x^2 + y^2 < 4. The area should be finite and can be computed using polar coordinates. The area element derived from the metric leads us to conclude that the area is not infinite or zero. The only choice that represents a valid area expression related to the coordinates is choice 2, which is 4Ï€(x^2 + y^2) evaluated over the correct limits. Therefore, the correct answer is B.
