proposed answer: The given metric is ds^2 = \frac{32}{(4-x^2-y^2)}(dx^2+dy^2), which suggests a conformally flat metric. To find the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2, we need to integrate the area element over the region defined by the metric. The area element is \frac{32}{(4-x^2-y^2)}dxdy. The region of integration is x^2 + y^2 \leq 4, which corresponds to the radius r=2. However, the metric becomes singular at x^2 + y^2 = 4, indicating that the area is infinite as we approach this boundary. Therefore, the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2 is infinite.
