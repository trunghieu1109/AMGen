Question: Example(question='In a specific region of the sky, astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?', choice1='~ r^2', choice2='~ r^4', choice3='~ r^3', choice4='~ r^5', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. Since parallax (plx) is inversely related to distance (r), we have plx = 1/r. Substituting this into the equation gives us the number of stars as proportional to (1/(1/r))^5 = r^5. Therefore, the number of stars changes with distance as ~ r^5.
