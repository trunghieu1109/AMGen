    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;In a specific region of the sky, astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;~ r^2&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;~ r^4&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;~ r^3&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;~ r^5&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent YQja:
The parallax (plx) is inversely related to the distance (r) of the stars, meaning that as distance increases, parallax decreases. Specifically, plx is proportional to 1/r. Given that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5, we can express this in terms of distance. Substituting plx with 1/r gives us the relationship: number of stars ~ (1/(1/r))^5 = r^5. Therefore, the number of stars varies with the distance raised to the fifth power.

### thinking by Debate Agent KR6G:
The relationship between parallax (plx) and distance (r) is given by the formula plx = 1/r, where plx is in arcseconds and r is in parsecs. If the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5, substituting plx gives us the variation in terms of distance. Thus, N ~ 1/(1/r)^5 = r^5. Therefore, the number of stars changes with distance as ~ r^5.

### thinking by Debate Agent ROmN:
The parallax (plx) is inversely related to the distance (r) of the stars, specifically, plx = 1/r. Therefore, if the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5, we can substitute plx with 1/r to find how the number of stars varies with distance. This gives us the relationship: Number of stars ~ 1/(1/r)^5 = r^5. Thus, the number of stars changes with distance as ~ r^5.

### thinking by Debate Agent 8gQM:
The relationship between the number of stars and parallax is given as 1/plx^5. Parallax (plx) is inversely related to distance (d), specifically plx = 1/d. Therefore, we can express the parallax in terms of distance: plx = 1/r, where r is the distance to the stars. Substituting this into the original equation gives us the number of stars as proportional to (1/(1/r)^5) = r^5. Hence, the number of stars increases with the distance raised to the power of 5.
