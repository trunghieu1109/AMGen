Question: Example(question='Astronomers are observing a planet with a radius of 1 Earth radius in a circular orbit, with a transit impact parameter of 0.2, around a star that has a radius 1.5 times that of the Sun. This planet has an orbital period of 3 days. What is the maximum orbital period of a second planet, with a radius of 2.5 times that of Earth, in the same system that will exhibit both transit and occultation events? Assume that the second planet also has a circular orbit and shares the same orbital plane as the previously mentioned transiting planet.', choice1='~ 7.5', choice2='~ 33.5', choice3='~ 37.5', choice4='~ 12.5', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: Transit constraint gives b1=0.2 = (a1 cos i)/R*, so cos i = 0.2 R*/a1. Occultation for planet 2 requires (a2/R*) cos i ≤ 1−Rp2/R*. Substituting cos i yields a2/a1 ≤ (1−Rp2/R*)/0.2 ≈ 4.92. Then P2/P1 = (a2/a1)^(3/2) ≈ 10.9, so P2 ≈ 3 days × 10.9 ≈ 32.7 days, closest to ~33.5 days.
