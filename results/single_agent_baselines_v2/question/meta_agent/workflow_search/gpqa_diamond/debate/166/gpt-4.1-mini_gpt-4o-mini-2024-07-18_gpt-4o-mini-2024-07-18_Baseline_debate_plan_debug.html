### thinking by Debate Agent Dt0q:
To calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) of the given Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure, we first need to define the density matrix for the state |psi&gt; and the reference Gaussian state tau. We then compute the relative entropy using the provided formula. Given the parameters phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5, we will substitute these values into the equations. After calculating the traces involved in the relative entropy formula, we can determine the value of nG. The options provided suggest that we should arrive at one of the specific values listed.

### thinking by Debate Agent LRYW:
To calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) using the relative entropy measure, we need to first define the density matrix rho for the given Schrödinger cat state. The normalization constant N is calculated using the provided formula with phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. Then, we compute the density matrix tau for a reference Gaussian state. Finally, we apply the relative entropy formula to find nG. After performing the calculations, we compare the results with the provided choices to determine the correct one.
