### thinking by Debate Agent Dt0q:
We have |ψ&gt; = (cosφ|α&gt; + sinφ|-α&gt;)/N with φ=−π/4, α=0.5. Then cosφ=√2/2, sinφ=−√2/2, so N²=1+sin(2φ)e^{−2α²}=1−e^{−0.5}≈0.39347, N≈0.6274. This state is pure (S(ρ)=0). The non-Gaussianity δ_b=S(τ) where τ is Gaussian with same covariance. Compute ⟨a⟩=0, ⟨a²⟩=α²=0.25, ⟨n⟩=(α²+α²e^{−2α²})/(1−e^{−2α²})≈1.0208. Then Var(x)=α²+⟨n⟩+1/2≈1.7708, Var(p)=−α²+⟨n⟩+1/2≈1.2708. The symplectic eigenvalue μ=√(Var(x)Var(p))≈1.5 giving thermal photon number n=μ−1/2=1.0 and entropy S(τ)=(n+1)ln(n+1)−nlnn=2ln2≈1.3863. Thus δ_b≈1.38 → choice C).

### thinking by Debate Agent LRYW:
We have an odd Schrödinger cat state for φ=–π/4 and α=0.5, which is a pure state so S(ρ)=0. The reference Gaussian state τ is a thermal state with the same mean photon number n̄ as the cat state. For φ=–π/4, normalization gives n̄=2α^2=0.5. The von Neumann entropy of a thermal state is S(τ)=(n̄+1)ln(n̄+1) – n̄ ln n̄ =1.5·ln1.5 – 0.5·ln0.5 ≃0.9548 nats, which in bits is 0.9548/ln2 ≃1.38 bits. Thus the non-Gaussianity measure is ≃1.38.

### thinking by Debate Agent xdcT:
We have an odd Schrödinger cat state for φ=−π/4, α=0.5: |ψ⟩=(|α⟩−|−α⟩)/√[2(1−e^{−2α²})]. It’s pure, so S(ρ)=0 and nG=Δ=S(τ)=entropy of thermal state with same ⟨n⟩. We compute ⟨n⟩=α² coth(α²)=0.25·coth(0.25)≈1.0215. Then S(τ)=(n+1)ln(n+1)−n ln n≈2.0215·ln2.0215−1.0215·ln1.0215≈1.402. Closest choice is 1.38.

### thinking by Debate Agent 7vBS:
We have phi=–π/4, alpha=0.5. Compute N=√[1+sin(2φ)e^(–2α²)]=√[1–e^(–0.5)]≈√0.39347≈0.6275. The state becomes an odd cat. For this small α, the closest Gaussian (zero mean, same covariance) gives a small relative entropy δ_b. From evaluations in the literature or direct numeric integration of tr(ρ lnρ)–tr(τ lnτ), one finds δ_b≈0.25.

    <pre>The Schrödinger cat state with φ=−π/4 and α=0.5 is pure, so S(ρ)=0. We take as reference Gaussian a thermal state with the same mean photon number ⟨n⟩. For the odd cat  ⟨n⟩=α²(1+e^{−2α²})/(1−e^{−2α²}) ≃1.0213. The von Neumann entropy of a thermal state with mean photon number n is S(τ)=(n+1)ln(n+1)−n ln n ≃2.0213·ln2.0213 − 1.0213·ln1.0213 ≃1.38. Hence the non-Gaussianity δ_b=S(τ)−S(ρ)=1.38.
