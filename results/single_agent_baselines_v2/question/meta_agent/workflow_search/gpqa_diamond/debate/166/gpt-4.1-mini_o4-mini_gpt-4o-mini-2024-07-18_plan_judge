Question: Example(question='Calculate the amount of non-Gaussianity(nG) in the Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy measure.

proposed answer: The Schrödinger cat state with φ=−π/4 and α=0.5 is pure, so S(ρ)=0. We take as reference Gaussian a thermal state with the same mean photon number ⟨n⟩. For the odd cat  ⟨n⟩=α²(1+e^{−2α²})/(1−e^{−2α²}) ≃1.0213. The von Neumann entropy of a thermal state with mean photon number n is S(τ)=(n+1)ln(n+1)−n ln n ≃2.0213·ln2.0213 − 1.0213·ln1.0213 ≃1.38. Hence the non-Gaussianity δ_b=S(τ)−S(ρ)=1.38.
