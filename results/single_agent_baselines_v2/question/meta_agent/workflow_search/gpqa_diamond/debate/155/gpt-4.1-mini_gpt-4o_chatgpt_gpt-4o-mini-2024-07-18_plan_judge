Question: Example(question='A chemist performs two reactions:\n\nReaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. \n\nReaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.\n\nBoth reactions go to 100% completion. The chemist combines the products of both reactions, and then runs the product mixture on both a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column and a chiral HPLC column.\n\nAssuming that the chromatographic resolution is as high as theoretically possible in both cases, what does the chemist observe in each of these chromatograms?', choice1='4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', choice2='3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice3='2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice4='2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: All agents agree that Reaction 1 with (E)-oct-4-ene results in a meso compound, which is achiral, and Reaction 2 with (Z)-oct-4-ene results in a pair of enantiomers. On a standard (achiral) HPLC, the meso compound and the racemic mixture of enantiomers will result in 2 peaks because the enantiomers are not separated. On a chiral HPLC, the meso compound will still show as one peak, but the enantiomers will be separated into two distinct peaks, resulting in a total of 3 peaks. Therefore, the correct observation is 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC.
