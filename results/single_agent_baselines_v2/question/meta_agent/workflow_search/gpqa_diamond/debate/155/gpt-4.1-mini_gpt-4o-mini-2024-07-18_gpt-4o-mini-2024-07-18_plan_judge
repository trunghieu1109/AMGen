Question: Example(question='A chemist performs two reactions:\n\nReaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. \n\nReaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.\n\nBoth reactions go to 100% completion. The chemist combines the products of both reactions, and then runs the product mixture on both a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column and a chiral HPLC column.\n\nAssuming that the chromatographic resolution is as high as theoretically possible in both cases, what does the chemist observe in each of these chromatograms?', choice1='4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', choice2='3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice3='2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice4='2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: In the reactions, (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene both yield diols that are diastereomers of each other. The standard HPLC will not resolve these diastereomers, leading to fewer peaks, while the chiral HPLC will separate them into distinct peaks. Therefore, in standard HPLC, we expect to see 2 peaks (one for each pair of diastereomers), and in chiral HPLC, we will see 4 peaks (resolving each diastereomer into its enantiomers). Thus, the chemist will observe 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC.
