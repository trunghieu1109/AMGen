    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;A chemist performs two reactions:\n\nReaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. \n\nReaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.\n\nBoth reactions go to 100% completion. The chemist combines the products of both reactions, and then runs the product mixture on both a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column and a chiral HPLC column.\n\nAssuming that the chromatographic resolution is as high as theoretically possible in both cases, what does the chemist observe in each of these chromatograms?&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent xMjR:
The epoxidation of an achiral E‐alkene with mCPBA gives a racemic pair of enantiomeric epoxides (two enantiomers). The Z‐alkene, being symmetric (identical propyl substituents), yields only the meso epoxide (which is achiral and unique). Combined, the mixture contains two enantiomers (a racemate) plus one meso diastereomer. On an achiral (standard) HPLC column, diastereomers separate but enantiomers coelute, giving two peaks (meso vs. racemate). On a chiral column, the racemate splits into its two enantiomers while the meso remains a single peak, for a total of three peaks.

### thinking by Debate Agent xKiP:
Epoxidation of the alkene followed by acid‐catalyzed opening gives overall anti dihydroxylation. Anti addition to a trans (E) alkene yields an enantiomeric pair (R,R and S,S) while anti addition to a cis (Z) alkene yields the meso diol (R,S). Combining both reactions gives three stereomers: R,R, S,S, and meso. On an achiral reverse‐phase column enantiomers coelute, so you see two peaks (one for the R,R/S,S pair and one for meso). On a chiral column enantiomers are resolved, so you see three peaks (R,R, S,S, and meso).

### thinking by Debate Agent vDzD:
Oct-4-ene has identical propyl substituents so E-alkene epoxidation gives the trans-epoxide as a racemic pair (2 enantiomers), while Z gives the cis-epoxide as a single meso diastereomer. On achiral HPLC the enantiomers coelute (1 peak) and the meso is separate (2 peaks total). On a chiral column the racemic pair resolves into 2 peaks plus one for the meso (3 peaks).

### thinking by Debate Agent RtOd:
The epoxidation of an achiral (E)-oct-4-ene with achiral mCPBA gives a meso epoxide (identical substituents on C4 and C5), while the epoxidation of (Z)-oct-4-ene gives the enantiomeric pair of the cis epoxide. Acidic opening of the meso epoxide yields the meso 4,5-diol, and opening of the racemic epoxide gives a racemic pair of 4,5-diols. Thus the final mixture has three stereoisomeric diols: one achiral (meso) and two enantiomers.

On a standard (achiral) HPLC column diastereomers separate but enantiomers do not, so you see two peaks (one for the meso diol, one for the racemate). On a chiral HPLC column, enantiomers also separate, giving three peaks (one for the meso diol, two for the enantiomers).
