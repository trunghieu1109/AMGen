Question: Example(question='An electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Find the expectation value of its spin along y-direction, S_y.\nNote: \\sigma_y (in latex format) is: \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & -i \\\\\ni & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}', choice1='-25*hbar/2\n\n', choice2='-12*hbar/25\n\n', choice3='12*hbar/25', choice4='25*hbar/2\n', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, we need to normalize the spin state (3i, 4) and then apply the Pauli matrix σ_y to this normalized state. The normalization factor is calculated as sqrt((3i)^2 + (4)^2) = sqrt(-9 + 16) = sqrt(7). The normalized state is (3i/sqrt(7), 4/sqrt(7)). We then compute the expectation value using the formula <S_y> = <ψ|σ_y|ψ>. After performing the calculations, we find that the expectation value is -12*hbar/25, which corresponds to choice 2.
