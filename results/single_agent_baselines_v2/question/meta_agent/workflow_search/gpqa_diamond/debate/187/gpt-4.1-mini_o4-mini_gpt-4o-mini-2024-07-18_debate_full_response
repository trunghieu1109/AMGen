The metric tensor G has diagonal entries a^2 and off‐diagonals a^2 cos α. The reciprocal metric G* = G^(–1) yields for Miller indices (hkl) the spacing formula\n1/d^2 = (1/(a^2 Δ)) [3(1–cos α)^2], where Δ = det[G/a^2] = 1 + 2 cos^3α – 3 cos^2α.\nPlug in cos 30°=√3/2≈0.8660: cos^2=0.75, cos^3≈0.6495 → Δ≈1+1.299–2.25=0.0490, (1–cos)^2≈0.01794, so 1/d^2=3*0.01794/(100*0.0490)=0.91097/100, d/a=√0.91097≈0.95446 → d≈10*0.95446=9.5446 Å.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent ABDn:\nWe have a rhombohedral cell with a=b=c=10 Å and interaxial angles α=β=γ=30°. The metric tensor G has diagonal entries a^2 and off-diagonals a^2 cosα. Its inverse G* yields the interplanar spacing via 1/d^2 = Σ_i Σ_j G*_{ij} h_i h_j. For (111) this simplifies to 1/d^2 = 3/[a^2(1+2 cosα)], so d = a√[(1+2 cosα)/3]. Plugging α=30° (cos30°=√3/2≈0.8660) gives d=10√[(1+2×0.8660)/3]=10√[2.7320/3]=10×0.9543≈9.543 Å.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent yOyK:\nWe have a rhombohedral lattice with a\u2009=\u200910\u2009Å and α=β=γ=30°. We want the d-spacing for (1\u20091\u20091). For a rhombohedral lattice the reciprocal‐lattice vector magnitude is |G_hkl|=a*√[h²+k²+l²+2\u2009cosα*\u2009(hk+kl+lh)], where a*=(sinα)/(a√(1–3\u2009cos²α+2\u2009cos³α)) and cosα* = –cosα/(1+cosα). Compute cosα=cos30°=√3/2≈0.8660, sinα=0.5. Then 1–3\u2009cos²α+2\u2009cos³α=1–3(0.75)+2(0.6495)=0.04904, sqrt=0.22152. Hence a*=(0.5)/(10·0.22152)=0.22561\u2009Å⁻¹. Next cosα* = –0.8660/1.8660=–0.46410. For (1\u20091\u20091): S=3+2·(hk+kl+lh)·cosα*=3+2·3·(–0.46410)=3–2.7846=0.2154. So |G|=0.22561·√0.2154=0.10472\u2009Å⁻¹, giving d=1/|G|≈9.548\u2009Å ~9.54\u2009Å.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent Z92x:\nWe need the interplanar spacing d_{111} for a rhombohedral lattice with a=10 Å and α=β=γ=30°. A robust way is to construct real-space basis vectors v1,v2,v3 consistent with these parameters, compute the reciprocal basis vectors b1,b2,b3 via b1=(2π)(v2×v3)/V, etc., form G=h b1+k b2+l b3 for (hkl)=(1,1,1), then d=2π/|G|. Carrying out these vector operations yields |G|≈0.6576 Å⁻¹ and therefore d≈6.2832/0.6576≈9.55 Å. This matches choice A).\n\n### answer by Debate Agent ezO7:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent ABDn:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent yOyK:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent Z92x:\nA)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
