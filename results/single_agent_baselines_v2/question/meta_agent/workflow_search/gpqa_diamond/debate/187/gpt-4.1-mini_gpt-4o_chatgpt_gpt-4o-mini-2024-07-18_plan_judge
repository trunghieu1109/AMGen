Question: Example(question='Consider a rhombohedral crystal, with the interatomic distance of 10 Angstrom and the angles $\\quad\\alpha=\\beta=\\gamma=30^{0}$. What is the interplanar distance of the (111) plane of the crystal?\n', choice1='9.54 Angstrom', choice2='8.95 Angstrom', choice3='9.08 Angstrom', choice4='10.05 Angstrom', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: All agents agree on the method to calculate the interplanar distance for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal using the formula: d_hkl = a / sqrt(h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + kl + hl)cos(alpha)). Given a = 10 Angstrom, h = k = l = 1, and alpha = 30 degrees, the cosine of 30 degrees is sqrt(3)/2. Substituting these values into the formula, we get d_111 = 10 / sqrt(3 + 3*sqrt(3)). After calculating, the result is approximately 9.08 Angstrom, which corresponds to choice C).
