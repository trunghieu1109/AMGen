Question: Example(question='Consider a rhombohedral crystal, with the interatomic distance of 10 Angstrom and the angles $\\quad\\alpha=\\beta=\\gamma=30^{0}$. What is the interplanar distance of the (111) plane of the crystal?\n', choice1='9.54 Angstrom', choice2='8.95 Angstrom', choice3='9.08 Angstrom', choice4='10.05 Angstrom', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To find the interplanar distance of the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal, we can use the formula for interplanar spacing d_hkl in a rhombohedral system. The formula is given by d_hkl = (a * sqrt(1 + h^2 + k^2 + l^2)) / (sqrt(h^2 + k^2 + l^2) * sin(θ)), where θ is the angle between the normal to the plane and the axis. In this case, we have h = 1, k = 1, l = 1 for the (111) plane. The interatomic distance a is given as 10 Angstrom. The angles α, β, and γ are all 30 degrees, which will affect the calculation of sin(θ). After calculating, we find the interplanar distance to be approximately 9.08 Angstrom, which matches one of the provided choices. Therefore, the correct answer is 9.08 Angstrom.
