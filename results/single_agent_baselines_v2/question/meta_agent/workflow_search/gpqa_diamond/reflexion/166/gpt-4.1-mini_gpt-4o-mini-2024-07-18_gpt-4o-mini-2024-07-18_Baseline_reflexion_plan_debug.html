### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent UPac (yourself):
To calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) of the given Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure, we need to evaluate the density matrices rho and tau, and then compute the relative entropy del_b. The parameters given are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. We will substitute these values into the equations provided and perform the necessary calculations to find the value of nG. After evaluating the options provided, we will select the correct answer based on the computed value.

### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent UPac (yourself):
1.38

### feedback #1 by Critic Agent M92R:
The calculation of non-Gaussianity (nG) using the relative entropy measure involves evaluating the density matrices and performing the necessary computations. The answer provided is 1.38, which should be verified against the calculations for accuracy.

Given previous attempts and feedback, carefully consider where you could go wrong in your latest attempt. Using insights from previous attempts, try to solve the task better.</pre>
