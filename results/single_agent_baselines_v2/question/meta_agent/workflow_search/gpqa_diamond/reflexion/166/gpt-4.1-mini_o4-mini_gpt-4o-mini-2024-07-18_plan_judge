Question: Example(question='Calculate the amount of non-Gaussianity(nG) in the Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy measure. The state is defined as,\n|psi> =( cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> )/ N;\nHere, alpha is the amplitude, phi is the phase and N is the normalisation constant.\nN = sqrt(1+ sin(2*phi)*exp(-2*alpha^2)).\nThe relative entropy measure is given as,\ndel_b = [trace(rho* ln(rho))-trace(tau* ln(tau))]\nwhere tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state and rho is the density matrix of the above non-Gaussian state.\nCalculate the nG for phi =-pi /4 and alpha= 0.5.', choice1='2.48', choice2='0', choice3='1.38', choice4='0.25', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The non-Gaussianity δ_B for a pure state |ψ⟩ equals the entropy S(τ) of the reference Gaussian τ with the same first and second moments. For the odd cat (φ=−π/4) at α=0.5 one finds ⟨a⟩=0 and ⟨n⟩=α²(1+e^{−2α²})/(1−e^{−2α²})≈1.021. The corresponding thermal (Gaussian) entropy is S=(n+1)ln(n+1)−n ln n≈1.40, matching choice C.
