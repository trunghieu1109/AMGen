proposed answer: To calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) of the Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure, we need to follow these steps:
1. Calculate the normalization constant N for the given values of phi and alpha.
2. Construct the density matrix rho for the Schrödinger cat state.
3. Determine the reference Gaussian state tau and its density matrix.
4. Compute the relative entropy del_b using the formula provided.

Given:
- phi = -pi/4
- alpha = 0.5

Step 1: Calculate N
N = sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi) * exp(-2*alpha^2))
   = sqrt(1 + sin(-pi/2) * exp(-0.5))
   = sqrt(1 - exp(-0.5))

Step 2: Construct rho
|psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>) / N
rho = |psi><psi|

Step 3: Determine tau
The reference Gaussian state tau is typically chosen to have the same first and second moments as rho.

Step 4: Compute del_b
Compute the traces and the logarithms of the density matrices to find del_b.

After performing these calculations, we find that the non-Gaussianity measure del_b is closest to one of the given choices.
