Question: Example(question='The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1), and the operators of two observables P and Q of the system are represented by two square matrices. The matrix corresponding to operator P has the elements in first row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0), elements in the second row as (1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}) and that in third row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0). The matrix operator for Q is represented by the square matrix having elements in the first row as (1, 0, 0), second row as (0, 0, 0) and third row as (0, 0, -1). Now, if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P, what is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements?', choice1='1/2', choice2='1/6', choice3='1/3', choice4='2/3', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: We have the initial (unnormalized) state ψ=(−1,2,1). First measure P: its eigenvalue 0 has eigenvector v0∝(1,0,−1). Projector P0=|v0⟩⟨v0| gives probability ⟨ψ|P0|ψ⟩/⟨ψ|ψ⟩=(2)/6=1/3. After collapse the new state is ψ1=(−1,0,1)/√2. Next measure Q: the eigenvalue −1 corresponds to basis vector (0,0,1), so Pr(Q=−1|ψ1)=|⟨3|ψ1⟩|^2=(1/√2)^2=1/2. The joint probability is (1/3)(1/2)=1/6.
