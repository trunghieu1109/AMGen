    <pre>First, we need to determine the rest masses of the two fragments. Let the rest mass of the lighter fragment be m, then the rest mass of the heavier fragment is 2m. The sum of their rest masses is 3m, which is 99% of the initial mass M. Therefore, 3m = 0.99M, so m = 0.33M. The rest mass of the heavier fragment is 2m = 0.66M. The initial rest-mass energy is 300 GeV, so M = 300 GeV/c^2. The rest-mass energy of the fragments is 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV. The energy released in the fission is 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV, which is the total kinetic energy of the fragments. Let E1 and E2 be the total energies of the heavier and lighter fragments, respectively. E1 + E2 = 300 GeV. The rest-mass energy of the heavier fragment is 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV, so E1 = 198 GeV + T1, where T1 is the kinetic energy of the heavier fragment. The rest-mass energy of the lighter fragment is 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV, so E2 = 99 GeV + T2, where T2 is the kinetic energy of the lighter fragment. E1 + E2 = 300 GeV implies 198 GeV + T1 + 99 GeV + T2 = 300 GeV, so T1 + T2 = 3 GeV. In the center of mass frame, the momentum of the two fragments must be equal and opposite. Using relativistic momentum, p1 = p2, where p1 = sqrt((E1/c)^2 - (m1c)^2) and p2 = sqrt((E2/c)^2 - (m2c)^2). Solving these equations gives the relativistic kinetic energy T1. In the classical approximation, the kinetic energy is distributed according to the mass ratio, so T1_classical = (2/3) * 3 GeV = 2 GeV. The difference between the relativistic T1 and the classical T1 is the answer.
