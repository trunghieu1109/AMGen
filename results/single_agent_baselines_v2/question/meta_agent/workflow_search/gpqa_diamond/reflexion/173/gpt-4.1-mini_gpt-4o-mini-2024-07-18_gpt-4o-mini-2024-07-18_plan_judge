Question: Example(question='An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. A spontaneous fission occurs in which it splits into two fragments (and nothing else), such that one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other (in terms of their rest-masses). The sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. \n\nKinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?\n\n(Ignore the electrons.)', choice1='10 MeV.', choice2='5 MeV.', choice3='2 MeV.', choice4='20 MeV.', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To solve the problem, we first need to understand the mass distribution after the fission. Let the mass of the lighter fragment be m and the mass of the heavier fragment be 2m. According to the problem, the total rest mass of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass M, which means: m + 2m = 0.99M, leading to 3m = 0.99M, thus m = 0.33M and 2m = 0.66M. The initial rest mass energy is 300 GeV, so the total energy is E = 300 GeV. After fission, the rest mass energy of the fragments is 0.99M, which is 297 GeV. The energy released in the fission is 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV. This energy will be converted into kinetic energy of the fragments. By conservation of momentum and energy, we can find the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1). In the classical approximation, we would calculate T1 using the formula for kinetic energy in a non-relativistic context, which would yield a different value. The difference between the relativistic and classical calculations gives us the answer. After performing the calculations, we find that the difference is 5 MeV.
