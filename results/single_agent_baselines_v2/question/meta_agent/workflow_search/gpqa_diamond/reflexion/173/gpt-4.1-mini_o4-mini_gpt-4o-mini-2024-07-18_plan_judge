Question: Example(question='An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. A spontaneous fission occurs in which it splits into two fragments (and nothing else), such that one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other (in terms of their rest-masses). The sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. \n\nKinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?\n\n(Ignore the electrons.)', choice1='10 MeV.', choice2='5 MeV.', choice3='2 MeV.', choice4='20 MeV.', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: Initial mass M corresponds to 300 GeV. Fragments have m1=2m2 and m1+m2=0.99M, so m1=0.66M and m2=0.33M. Mass defect ΔM=0.01M ⇒ Q=0.01·300 GeV=3 GeV total KE. Nonrelativistic T1_cl=Q·m2/(m1+m2)=3 GeV·(0.33/0.99)=1 GeV. Relativistic T1_rel=[M^2+m1^2−m2^2]/(2M)−m1 ≃199.005 GeV−198 GeV=1.005 GeV. Difference ≃5 MeV.
