Question: Example(question='In a specific region of the sky, astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?', choice1='~ r^2', choice2='~ r^4', choice3='~ r^3', choice4='~ r^5', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The observed distribution is N(plx)∝plx^(−5). Since plx=1/r, we have plx^(−5)=(1/r)^(−5)=r^5. The number per distance interval is N(r)=N(plx)·|dplx/dr|. But dplx/dr=d(1/r)/dr=−1/r^2, so |dplx/dr|=1/r^2. Thus N(r)∝r^5·(1/r^2)=r^3.
