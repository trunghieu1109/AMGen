Question: Example(question='Imagine an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ having a small spherical cavity inside. The centre of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the centre of the spherical conductor. The radius of the cavity is $r$, and $r<R$. Now consider a small amount of positive charge $+q$ is somehow placed somewhere inside the cavity. What is the magnitude of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at a point P (outside the spherical conductor) of distance $L$ from the centre of the spherical conductor? Note, the distance of the point P from the centre of the cavity is $l$. Here, l, L > R. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\\theta$\n', choice1='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n', choice2='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n', choice3='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\n', choice4='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: The problem involves a charge +q inside a cavity within a spherical conductor. By Gauss's law, the electric field inside a conductor is zero, and any charge inside the cavity induces an equal and opposite charge on the inner surface of the cavity. The outer surface of the conductor will have a charge distribution that ensures the electric field outside the conductor is as if the entire charge +q is at the center of the conductor. Therefore, the electric field at a point P outside the conductor is determined by the charge +q as if it were at the center of the conductor. The distance from the center of the conductor to point P is L, so the electric field at P is given by Coulomb's law for a point charge at the center of the conductor.
