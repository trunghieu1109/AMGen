Question: {'question': 'Imagine an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ having a small spherical cavity inside. The centre of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the centre of the spherical conductor. The radius of the cavity is $r$, and $r<R$.

Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent xdcT', content='We have an uncharged conducting sphere with a small off-center cavity containing a point charge +q. When +q is placed in the cavity, it induces –q on the inner cavity surface and +q on the outer surface. The charges on the outer surface distribute uniformly, making the field outside identical to that of a point charge +q at the center of the conductor, regardless of the cavity’s shape or the position of +q inside it. Therefore, at any point P outside (distance L from the conductor’s center), the electric field magnitude is E = (1/4πε0)·q / L^2.\n\nAnswer:D', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
