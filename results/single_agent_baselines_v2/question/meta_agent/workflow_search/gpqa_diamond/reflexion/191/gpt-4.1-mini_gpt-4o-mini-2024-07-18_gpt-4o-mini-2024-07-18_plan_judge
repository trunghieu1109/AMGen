Question: Example(question='Imagine an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ having a small spherical cavity inside. The centre of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the centre of the spherical conductor. The radius of the cavity is $r$, and $r<R$. Now consider a small amount of positive charge $+q$ is somehow placed somewhere inside the cavity. What is the magnitude of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at a point P (outside the spherical conductor) of distance $L$ from the centre of the spherical conductor? Note, the distance of the point P from the centre of the cavity is $l$. Here, l, L > R. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\\theta$\n', choice1='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n', choice2='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n', choice3='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\n', choice4='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: In this scenario, we have a spherical conductor with a cavity containing a charge +q. The electric field outside the conductor is influenced by the charge inside the cavity. According to Gauss's law, the electric field outside a spherical conductor is equivalent to that produced by a point charge located at the center of the conductor. Since the conductor is uncharged, the charge +q will induce a charge of -q on the inner surface of the conductor, and a charge of +q will appear on the outer surface of the conductor. Therefore, the electric field at a point P outside the conductor, at a distance L from the center, can be treated as if all the charge +q were concentrated at the center of the conductor. The distance L is greater than R, so we can use the formula for the electric field due to a point charge: E = k * q / r^2, where k = 1/(4πε₀) and r is the distance from the charge to the point where we are measuring the field. Since L is the distance from the center of the conductor to point P, the electric field at point P is given by E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q / L^2). This matches choice 4.

Answer:E = \dfrac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_o} \dfrac{q}{L^2}
Extracted answer: E = \dfrac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_o} \dfrac{q}{L^2}
Correct answer: 4
