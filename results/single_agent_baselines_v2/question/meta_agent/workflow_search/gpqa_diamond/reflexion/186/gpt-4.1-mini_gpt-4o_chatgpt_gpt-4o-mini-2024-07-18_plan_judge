proposed answer: To determine which stars are detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph, we need to consider the apparent magnitude of each star and whether it can achieve a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. 

1. Canopus is a very bright star with an apparent magnitude of about -0.74, so it is easily detectable.
2. Polaris has an apparent magnitude of about 1.98, which is also detectable.
3. The star with an absolute V magnitude of 15 mag at 10 pc has an apparent magnitude of 15 mag, which is likely detectable.
4. The star with an absolute V magnitude of 15 mag at 200 pc has an apparent magnitude of 20.5 mag, which is likely not detectable.
5. The star with an absolute V magnitude of 15 mag at 5 pc has an apparent magnitude of 14.25 mag, which is likely detectable.
6. The star with an absolute V magnitude of 15 mag at 50 pc has an apparent magnitude of 19.5 mag, which is likely not detectable.

Therefore, the detectable stars are Canopus, Polaris, the star at 10 pc, and the star at 5 pc, making a total of 4 detectable stars.
