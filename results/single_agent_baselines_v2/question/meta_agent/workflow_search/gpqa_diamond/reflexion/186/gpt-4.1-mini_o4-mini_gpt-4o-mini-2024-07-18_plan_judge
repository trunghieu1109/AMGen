Question: Example(question='How many of the stars listed below would be detectable using the ESPRESSO spectrograph, when it is coupled with one of the 8m VLT telescopes at the Paranal Observatory? A star is considered detectable if a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure is achieved.\n\nFor more details about the ESPRESSO spectrograph, please refer to the following link:\nhttps://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/instruments/espresso/overview.html\n\na) Canopus\nb) Polaris\nc) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 10 pc distance from us.\nd) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 200 pc distance from us.\ne) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 5 pc distance from us.\nf) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 50 pc distance from us.', choice1='4', choice2='3', choice3='2', choice4='5', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: First, determine the apparent V magnitudes of each star and compare to ESPRESSO’s S/N=10 in 1 h limit (approximately V≲16 on an 8 m telescope). 
1. Canopus: V≈–0.7 ⇒ detectable.
2. Polaris: V≈2.0 ⇒ detectable.
3. MV=15 at 10 pc: m=15+5·log10(10/10)=15 ⇒ detectable.
4. MV=15 at 200 pc: m=15+5·log10(20)≈21.5 ⇒ too faint.
5. MV=15 at 5 pc: m=15+5·log10(0.5)≈13.5 ⇒ detectable.
6. MV=15 at 50 pc: m=15+5·log10(5)≈18.5 ⇒ too faint.
Detectable stars: a, b, c, e → 4 total.
