Question: Example(question='How many of the stars listed below would be detectable using the ESPRESSO spectrograph, when it is coupled with one of the 8m VLT telescopes at the Paranal Observatory? A star is considered detectable if a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure is achieved.\n\nFor more details about the ESPRESSO spectrograph, please refer to the following link:\nhttps://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/instruments/espresso/overview.html\n\na) Canopus\nb) Polaris\nc) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 10 pc distance from us.\nd) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 200 pc distance from us.\ne) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 5 pc distance from us.\nf) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 50 pc distance from us.', choice1='4', choice2='3', choice3='2', choice4='5', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To determine how many stars are detectable using the ESPRESSO spectrograph, I will calculate the apparent magnitudes of each star based on their absolute magnitudes and distances. The formula for apparent magnitude is m = M + 5 * (log10(d) - 1). I will check the apparent magnitudes of Canopus and Polaris against the S/N criteria, and calculate the apparent magnitudes for the other stars based on their absolute magnitudes and distances. I will then see how many of these stars meet the criteria for detection with a S/N of at least 10.
