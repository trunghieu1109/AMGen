proposed answer: The metric given is ds^2 = \frac{32}{(4-x^2-y^2)}(dx^2 + dy^2), which is a conformal metric in the plane. The area element is dA = \frac{32}{(4-x^2-y^2)} dx dy. The region of integration is the disk x^2 + y^2 < 4. In polar coordinates, the area element becomes dA = \frac{32}{(4-r^2)} r dr d\theta. The limits of integration are 0 <= r < 2 and 0 <= \theta < 2\pi. The integral is \int_{0}^{2\pi} \int_{0}^{2} \frac{32r}{(4-r^2)} dr d\theta. Solving this integral gives a finite result, not infinity.
