    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;In an industrial research lab, a scientist performs ethylene polymerization with a homogeneous organometallic catalyst system, generating a polymer of high density. He intends to add a second catalyst system to introduce regular branches in the polymer backbone, also only using ethylene as the reactant. He consults a senior scientist, who gives the following statements. “Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US. One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators. Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step. Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.”\nWhich of these four statements is correct regarding the formation of a polymer with regular branches using only ethylene as the monomer and a dual catalyst system?&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.&#39;}

    <pre>To determine which statement is correct, we need to consider the context of ethylene polymerization with a dual catalyst system to introduce regular branches. The first statement suggests that such systems are already used industrially in the US, which is plausible given the advanced state of polymer technology. The second statement claims that aluminum-based activators do not work for the additional reaction step, which might be true if the specific reaction step requires a different type of activator. The third statement involves using a group VIa transition metal catalyst, which is not typical for ethylene polymerization; usually, group IV transition metals like titanium or zirconium are used. The fourth statement mentions noble metal catalysts, which are indeed expensive and not commonly used for this purpose. Therefore, the most likely correct statement is the first one, as combined systems for polymerization are indeed implemented industrially.
