    <pre>The Mott-Gurney equation describes the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) in a semiconductor device. It is derived under the assumption that the device is trap-free, meaning there are no traps that capture charge carriers. It also assumes that the device is a single-carrier device, meaning only one type of charge carrier (either electrons or holes) is present. Additionally, the equation assumes that there is no barrier to carrier injection, which implies that the contacts are Ohmic, allowing carriers to be injected freely into the device. The diffusion current is considered negligible compared to the drift current in the SCLC regime. Therefore, the correct statement about the validity of the Mott-Gurney equation is that it is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.
