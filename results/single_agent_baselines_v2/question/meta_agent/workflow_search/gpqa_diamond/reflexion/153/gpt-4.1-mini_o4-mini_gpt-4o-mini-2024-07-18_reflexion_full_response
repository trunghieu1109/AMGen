Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent dzzT', content='The molecular ion at m/z 156 with an M+2 peak ~32% matches one chlorine atom (Cl-35/Cl-37). IR shows a broad 3500–2700 cm⁻¹ band plus a 1720 cm⁻¹ C=O, consistent with a carboxylic acid. ¹H NMR: 11.0 ppm (s, 1H) is the COOH proton; two aromatic doublets (2H each) indicate a para-substituted benzene. Among the choices, only 4-chlorobenzoic acid fits all data.\n\nAnswer:A)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
