Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 9Uxz', content='We have a relativistic oscillator with potential energy U(x)=½k x². The total energy at maximum displacement x=A (v=0) is E=m c²+½kA². At x=0, U=0 and all energy is kinetic: E=γ m c², so γ m c²=m c²+½kA² ⇒ γ=1+α where α= kA²/(2m c²). Since γ=1/√(1−v²/c²), we get √(1−v²/c²)=1/(1+α) ⇒ v²/c²=1−1/(1+α)². Hence v_max=c√[1−1/(1 + kA²/(2m c²))²], which matches choice B.\n\nAnswer:B)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
