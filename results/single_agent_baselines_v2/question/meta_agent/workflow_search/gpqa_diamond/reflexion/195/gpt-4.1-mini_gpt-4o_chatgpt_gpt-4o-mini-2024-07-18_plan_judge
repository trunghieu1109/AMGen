proposed answer: To find the maximum speed of a relativistic harmonic oscillator, we need to consider the energy of the system. The total energy E of a relativistic particle is given by E = \gamma mc^2, where \gamma = 1/\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}. For a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy at maximum amplitude A is U = (1/2)kA^2. At maximum speed, all this potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. In the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is given by K = (\gamma - 1)mc^2. Setting the potential energy equal to the kinetic energy, we have (1/2)kA^2 = (\gamma - 1)mc^2. Solving for \gamma, we get \gamma = 1 + (kA^2)/(2mc^2). Substituting \gamma = 1/\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} and solving for v, we find v = c\sqrt{1 - 1/(1 + (kA^2)/(2mc^2))^2}. This matches choice 2.
