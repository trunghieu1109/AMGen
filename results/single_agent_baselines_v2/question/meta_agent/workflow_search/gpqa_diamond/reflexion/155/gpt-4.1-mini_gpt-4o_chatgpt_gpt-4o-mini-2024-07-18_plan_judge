Question: Example(question='A chemist performs two reactions:\n\nReaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. \n\nReaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.\n\nBoth reactions go to 100% completion. The chemist combines the products of both reactions, and then runs the product mixture on both a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column and a chiral HPLC column.\n\nAssuming that the chromatographic resolution is as high as theoretically possible in both cases, what does the chemist observe in each of these chromatograms?', choice1='4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', choice2='3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice3='2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice4='2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: First, consider the reactions. Reaction 1 involves (E)-oct-4-ene treated with mCPBA, which forms an epoxide, and then with aqueous acid, which opens the epoxide to form a diol. Reaction 2 involves (Z)-oct-4-ene treated similarly. The stereochemistry of the starting alkenes will affect the stereochemistry of the diols formed. (E)-oct-4-ene will form a trans-epoxide, which upon acid treatment will give a trans-diol. (Z)-oct-4-ene will form a cis-epoxide, which upon acid treatment will give a cis-diol. The trans-diol and cis-diol are diastereomers. On a standard HPLC, which does not separate enantiomers, the trans-diol and cis-diol will appear as two separate peaks. On a chiral HPLC, which can separate enantiomers, each diol will appear as two peaks corresponding to its enantiomers. Therefore, on a chiral HPLC, there will be four peaks: two for the enantiomers of the trans-diol and two for the enantiomers of the cis-diol.

Answer:2 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC
Extracted answer: 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC
Correct answer: 3
