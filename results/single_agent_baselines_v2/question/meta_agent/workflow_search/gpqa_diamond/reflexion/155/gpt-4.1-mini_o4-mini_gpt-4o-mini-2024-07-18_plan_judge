Question: Example(question='A chemist performs two reactions:\n\nReaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. \n\nReaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.\n\nBoth reactions go to 100% completion. The chemist combines the products of both reactions, and then runs the product mixture on both a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column and a chiral HPLC column.\n\nAssuming that the chromatographic resolution is as high as theoretically possible in both cases, what does the chemist observe in each of these chromatograms?', choice1='4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', choice2='3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice3='2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice4='2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: Epoxidation of (E)-4-octene with mCPBA gives a racemic trans-epoxide, which upon acid opening yields a racemic anti-diol (two enantiomers). Epoxidation of (Z)-4-octene gives a meso cis-epoxide, which upon acid opening yields a single meso anti-diol. Mixing products gives three stereoisomers: two enantiomers (R,R and S,S) and one meso. On an achiral column diastereomers separate but enantiomers coelute → 2 peaks. On a chiral column enantiomers also separate → 3 peaks.
