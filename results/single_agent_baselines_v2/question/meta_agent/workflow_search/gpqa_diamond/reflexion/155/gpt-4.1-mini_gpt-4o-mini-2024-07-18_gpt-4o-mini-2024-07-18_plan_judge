Question: Example(question='A chemist performs two reactions:\n\nReaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. \n\nReaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.\n\nBoth reactions go to 100% completion. The chemist combines the products of both reactions, and then runs the product mixture on both a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column and a chiral HPLC column.\n\nAssuming that the chromatographic resolution is as high as theoretically possible in both cases, what does the chemist observe in each of these chromatograms?', choice1='4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', choice2='3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice3='2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice4='2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: In Reaction 1, (E)-oct-4-ene reacts with mCPBA and then undergoes acid hydrolysis, producing a mixture of products that includes a ketone and an alcohol. In Reaction 2, (Z)-oct-4-ene undergoes the same process, leading to different products. The (E) and (Z) isomers will yield different stereoisomers, resulting in a total of 4 unique products when combined. In a standard HPLC, which cannot differentiate between enantiomers, we will see 2 peaks (one for each unique product). In contrast, a chiral HPLC can separate the enantiomers, leading to 4 peaks. Therefore, the chemist will observe 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC.
