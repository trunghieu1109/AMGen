Question: Example(question='We would like to dissolve (at 25°С) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm3 total volume. What is the minimum volume (cm3) of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution and what is the pH of the resulting solution?', choice1='pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3', choice2='pH 2.69; 30.09 cm3', choice3='pH 3.16; 32.14 cm3', choice4='pH 4.94; 20.40 cm3', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: First calculate moles of Fe(OH)3: M(Fe(OH)3)=55.85+3×17=106.85 g/mol => nFe(OH)3=0.1/106.85=9.36×10–4 mol. Dissolution needs stoichiometric H+: Fe(OH)3+3H+→Fe3++3H2O consumes nH+₁=3×9.36×10–4=2.808×10–3 mol. If any solid remains, [Fe3+][OH–]³=Ksp; to just dissolve completely we set [Fe3+]=nFe/Vtot=9.36×10–4/0.1=9.36×10–3 M and [OH–]=(Ksp/[Fe3+])¹ᐟ³; using a literature Ksp≈1×10–36 gives [OH–]≈4.9×10–12 M, so [H+]=Kw/[OH–]=2.04×10–3 M ⇒ pH≈2.69. That free H+ in 0.1 L is nH+₂=2.04×10–4 mol, so total H+ needed=2.808×10–3+2.04×10–4=3.012×10–3 mol, so volume of 0.1 M acid V=n/C=3.012×10–3/0.1=0.03012 L≈30.09 cm3. Only choice 2 is self-consistent.
