Question: Example(question='We would like to dissolve (at 25°С) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm3 total volume. What is the minimum volume (cm3) of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution and what is the pH of the resulting solution?', choice1='pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3', choice2='pH 2.69; 30.09 cm3', choice3='pH 3.16; 32.14 cm3', choice4='pH 4.94; 20.40 cm3', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: To dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)3, we first need to calculate the number of moles of Fe(OH)3. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is approximately 106.87 g/mol. Therefore, the number of moles of Fe(OH)3 is 0.1 g / 106.87 g/mol = 0.000935 moles. Since Fe(OH)3 is a triprotic acid, it will require 3 moles of H+ ions to fully dissolve. Thus, we need 0.000935 moles * 3 = 0.002805 moles of H+. To find the volume of 0.1 M monobasic strong acid needed to provide this amount of H+, we use the formula: Volume (L) = Moles / Concentration. Therefore, Volume = 0.002805 moles / 0.1 M = 0.02805 L, which is 28.05 cm3. Now, to find the pH of the resulting solution, we know that the concentration of H+ ions will be 0.1 M from the strong acid, and since we are adding a small amount of Fe(OH)3, the pH will be determined primarily by the strong acid. The pH can be calculated as pH = -log[H+]. Since we are adding 28.05 cm3 of 0.1 M acid, the concentration of H+ will remain approximately 0.1 M, leading to a pH of 2.00. However, we need to consider the dilution effect when the total volume is 100 cm3. The final concentration of H+ will be slightly less than 0.1 M, leading to a pH of around 2.04. Therefore, the answer is pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3.
