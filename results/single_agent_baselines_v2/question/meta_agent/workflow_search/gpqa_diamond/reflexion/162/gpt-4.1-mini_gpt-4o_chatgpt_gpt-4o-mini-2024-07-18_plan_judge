Question: Example(question='We would like to dissolve (at 25°С) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm3 total volume. What is the minimum volume (cm3) of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution and what is the pH of the resulting solution?', choice1='pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3', choice2='pH 2.69; 30.09 cm3', choice3='pH 3.16; 32.14 cm3', choice4='pH 4.94; 20.40 cm3', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)3, we need to calculate the moles of Fe(OH)3, which is 0.1 g / 106.87 g/mol = 9.36 x 10^-4 mol. This requires 3 times the moles of H+, which is 2.81 x 10^-3 mol. Using a 0.1 M acid, the volume needed is 2.81 x 10^-3 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 28.1 cm3. The resulting solution will have a pH determined by the excess H+ concentration. After neutralizing the Fe(OH)3, the remaining H+ concentration is (0.1 M * 28.1 cm3 - 2.81 x 10^-3 mol) / 100 cm3 = 0.0719 M, giving a pH of -log(0.0719) = 2.14. However, the closest choice is pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3.
