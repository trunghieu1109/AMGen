Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent qohW', content='The substrate is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Red P/HI reduces both the formyl (–CHO) and carboxyl (–COOH) groups to hydrogens (decarbonylation and decarboxylation), leaving the cyclohexene double bond (between C3–C4) and the vinyl substituent intact. The product is therefore a cyclohexene ring (one ring = 1 IHD, one C=C in the ring = 1 IHD) with a vinyl side chain (one more C=C = 1 IHD), for a total IHD = 3.\n\nAnswer:B)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
