Question: Example(question='What is the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product obtained when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess of HI?', choice1='1', choice2='3', choice3='0', choice4='5', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The substrate is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Red P/HI reduces both the formyl (–CHO) and carboxyl (–COOH) groups to hydrogens (decarbonylation and decarboxylation), leaving the cyclohexene double bond (between C3–C4) and the vinyl substituent intact. The product is therefore a cyclohexene ring (one ring = 1 IHD, one C=C in the ring = 1 IHD) with a vinyl side chain (one more C=C = 1 IHD), for a total IHD = 3.
