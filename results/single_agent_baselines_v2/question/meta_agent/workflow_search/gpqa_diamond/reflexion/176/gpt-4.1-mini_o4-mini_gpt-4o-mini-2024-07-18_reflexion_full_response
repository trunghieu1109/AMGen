Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent wmGl', content='We have two stars radiating as black bodies. Star_1 has radius R1=1.5\u2009R2 and Star_2 has R2. Their observed peak wavelengths λ_max,obs are equal, but Star_2 is receding at v=700\u2009km/s, so its rest‐frame peak wavelength λ_max,rest,2=λ_max,obs/(1+v/c). By Wien’s law, T∝1/λ_max, so T2/T1=1+v/c≈1.002333. Luminosity L=4πσR^2T^4. Thus L1/L2=(R1/R2)^2⋅(T1/T2)^4=(1.5)^2⋅(1/(1.002333))^4≈2.25⋅0.9907≈2.23.\n\nAnswer:D)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
