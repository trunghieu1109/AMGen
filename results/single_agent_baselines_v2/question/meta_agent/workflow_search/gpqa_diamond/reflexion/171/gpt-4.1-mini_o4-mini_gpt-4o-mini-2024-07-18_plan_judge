Question: Example(question='Two stars are being studied. It has been observed that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2. In fact, the energy difference between the considered energy levels was determined to be approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J. Assuming that the stellar photospheres are in LTE, which of these equations for the effective temperatures of the stars (T_1 and T_2) is correct?', choice1='ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]\n', choice2='ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]\n', choice3='ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n', choice4='ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: We apply the Boltzmann excitation ratio for two populations in LTE: N_excited/N_ground ∝ exp(−ΔE/(kT)). Given that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2, we have exp(−ΔE/(kT1)) / exp(−ΔE/(kT2)) = 2 ⇒ exp[ΔE/k (1/T2 − 1/T1)] = 2 ⇒ ΔE/k (1/T2 − 1/T1) = ln2 ⇒ ln2 = (ΔE/k)·(T1 − T2)/(T1 T2). Ignoring the constant ΔE/k common to both sides (as all answer choices lack it), the functional form is ln(2) = (T1 − T2)/(T1·T2), which matches choice D.
