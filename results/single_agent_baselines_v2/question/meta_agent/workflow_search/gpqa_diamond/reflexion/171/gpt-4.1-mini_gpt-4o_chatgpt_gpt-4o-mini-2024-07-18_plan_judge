Question: Example(question='Two stars are being studied. It has been observed that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2. In fact, the energy difference between the considered energy levels was determined to be approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J. Assuming that the stellar photospheres are in LTE, which of these equations for the effective temperatures of the stars (T_1 and T_2) is correct?', choice1='ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]\n', choice2='ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]\n', choice3='ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n', choice4='ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: The problem involves the relative excitation of iron atoms in the photospheres of two stars, which is related to their temperatures through the Boltzmann distribution. The ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state to the ground state is given by the Boltzmann factor, which depends on the temperature and the energy difference between the states. The problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2, which implies that the ratio of the Boltzmann factors for the two stars is 2. The Boltzmann factor is given by exp(-E/kT), where E is the energy difference, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature. Therefore, we have exp(-E/kT_1) / exp(-E/kT_2) = 2. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides gives ln(2) = (E/k)(1/T_2 - 1/T_1). This matches the form of choice 4, which is ln(2) = [(T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)], assuming a simplification or rearrangement of terms.
