Question: Example(question='Consider a rhombohedral crystal, with the interatomic distance of 10 Angstrom and the angles $\\quad\\alpha=\\beta=\\gamma=30^{0}$. What is the interplanar distance of the (111) plane of the crystal?\n', choice1='9.54 Angstrom', choice2='8.95 Angstrom', choice3='9.08 Angstrom', choice4='10.05 Angstrom', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal, we use the formula for the interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral lattice: d_hkl = a / sqrt(h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + kl + lh)cos(alpha) + 2cos^2(alpha) - 2cos(alpha)). Here, a is the interatomic distance, h, k, l are the Miller indices, and alpha is the angle between the axes. For the (111) plane, h = k = l = 1, a = 10 Angstrom, and alpha = 30 degrees. Plugging these values into the formula, we calculate the interplanar distance.

Answer:9.08 Angstrom
Extracted answer: 9.08 Angstrom
Correct answer: 1
