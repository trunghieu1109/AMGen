Question: Example(question='The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1). An observable of the system is represented by the matrix operator P having elements in the first row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0),  in the second row as (1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}) and in the third row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0). Calculate the probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 at time t.', choice1='1/3\n', choice2='2/3\n', choice3='\\sqrt{2/3}\n', choice4='1', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: We have state |φ⟩ = (-1,2,1)^T normalized to (-1,2,1)/√6. The observable P has eigenvalue 0 with eigenvector |ψ⟩ ∝ (1,0,-1), normalized to (1,0,-1)/√2. The probability to measure 0 is |⟨ψ|φ⟩|^2 = |(1/√2,0,-1/√2)·(-1/√6,2/√6,1/√6)|^2 = |(-1 - 1)/(√12)|^2 = (2/√12)^2 = 1/3.
