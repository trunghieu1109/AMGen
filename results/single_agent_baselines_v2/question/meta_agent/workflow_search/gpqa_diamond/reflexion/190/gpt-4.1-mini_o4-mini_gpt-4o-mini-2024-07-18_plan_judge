Question: Example(question='3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one is treated with sodium hydride, followed by benzyl bromide, forming product 1.\n\n1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide in the presence of a catalytic amount of HCl, forming product 2.\n\n2 is treated at low temperature with n-butyllithium, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride, forming product 3.\n\n3 is stirred with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere, forming product 4.\n\nWhat is the structure of product 4?', choice1='(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol', choice2="N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide", choice3='(((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene', choice4='3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: Step 1: NaH deprotonates the 3-CH2OH, benzyl bromide gives the benzyl ether.
Step 2: p-Toluenesulfonyl hydrazide converts the ketone to the tosyl hydrazone.
Step 3: n-BuLi (Shapiro) eliminates to give a C=C at the former carbonyl. Workup forms the alkene.
Step 4: H2/Pd reduces both the alkene from step 3 and the isopropenyl, and hydrogenolyzes the benzyl ether to liberate CH2OH. The final product is a fully saturated cyclohexane with an isopropyl substituent and a hydroxymethyl substituent.
This matches choice A.
