Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The first step involves deprotonation of the alcohol in 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one with sodium hydride, followed by alkylation with benzyl bromide, forming a benzyl ether. This gives product 1 as 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. The second step involves reaction with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide, which converts the ketone to a tosylhydrazone, forming product 2. The third step involves treatment with n-butyllithium, which can lead to the formation of a carbanion at the tosylhydrazone carbon, followed by elimination of nitrogen gas to form an alkene, and then quenching with ammonium chloride. This results in the reduction of the tosylhydrazone to an alkane, forming product 3 as 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexane. The final step is hydrogenation over Pd/C, which would reduce any remaining unsaturation, but in this case, the main effect is to remove the benzyl protecting group, resulting in the formation of the alcohol. Therefore, product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.
