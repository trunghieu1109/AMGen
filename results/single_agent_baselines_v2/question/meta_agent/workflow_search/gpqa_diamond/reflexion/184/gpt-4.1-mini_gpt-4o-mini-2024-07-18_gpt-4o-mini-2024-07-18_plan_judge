Question: Example(question='Consider a system with Hamiltonian operator $H = \\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n}$. Here, $\\vec{n}$ is an arbitrary unit vector, $\\varepsilon $ is a constant of dimension energy, and components of $\\vec{\\sigma}$ are the Pauli spin matrices. What are the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator?\n', choice1='+ \\varepsilon, -\\varepsilon\n', choice2='+\\varepsilon \\hbar/2, - \\varepsilon \\hbar/2', choice3='+1, -1', choice4='+\\hbar/2, -\\hbar/2', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The Hamiltonian operator given is of the form H = ε σ·n, where σ are the Pauli matrices and n is a unit vector. The eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian of this form can be determined by recognizing that the eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices are ±1. Therefore, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian will be ±ε, since the eigenvalues of σ·n will scale by ε. Thus, the correct choice is the one that reflects this result.
