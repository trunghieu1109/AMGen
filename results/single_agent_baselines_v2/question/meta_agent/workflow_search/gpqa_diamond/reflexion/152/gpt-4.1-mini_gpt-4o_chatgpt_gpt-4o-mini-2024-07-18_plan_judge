Question: Example(question='α-β unsaturated carbonyls have a much more electrophilic carbon double bond. These double bonds act as a good Lewis acid and react with nucleophiles to produce enolate ions. In this case, when a nucleophile attacks the β position, it produces a resonance-stabilized intermediate. When a nucleophile attacking the β-carbon is enolate, such reaction is known as the Michael reaction.\nWhat are the reactants and major final products of the following Michael addition reactions?\ndimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) -->(A)\n1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H3O+) --> (B)\nC + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H2O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice1='A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice2='A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice3='A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice4='A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To solve this problem, we need to analyze each Michael addition reaction and determine the products. For reaction (A), dimethyl malonate acts as the nucleophile and attacks the β-carbon of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The product is a Michael adduct with the malonate moiety attached to the β-carbon of the acrylate. The resulting product is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. For reaction (B), 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine acts as the nucleophile and attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile. The product is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile. For reaction (C), the nucleophile is cyclohexane-1,3-dione, which attacks the β-carbon of but-3-en-2-one, resulting in 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. Comparing these products with the given choices, choice 1 matches the products we determined.
