Question: Example(question='Astronomers are observing a planet with a radius of 1 Earth radius in a circular orbit, with a transit impact parameter of 0.2, around a star that has a radius 1.5 times that of the Sun. This planet has an orbital period of 3 days. What is the maximum orbital period of a second planet, with a radius of 2.5 times that of Earth, in the same system that will exhibit both transit and occultation events? Assume that the second planet also has a circular orbit and shares the same orbital plane as the previously mentioned transiting planet.', choice1='~ 7.5', choice2='~ 33.5', choice3='~ 37.5', choice4='~ 12.5', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: We need the maximum period such that the second planet still undergoes both primary transit and full secondary eclipse. The impact parameter b=(a/R⋆)cos i is the same scale for transit and eclipse. From the first planet we have b1=0.2=(a1/R⋆)cos i, so cos i=0.2 R⋆/a1. For the second planet b2=(a2/R⋆)cos i=0.2 (a2/a1). Full occultation requires b2≤1−Rp2/R⋆. Here Rp2/R⋆=2.5 R⊕/(1.5 R⊙)≈2.5/163.5≈0.0153, so b2≤0.9847 ⇒a2/a1≤0.9847/0.2≈4.9235. Then P∝a3/2 gives P2≤3 d×(4.9235)3/2≈3 d×10.922≈32.8 d, which matches choice ~33.5 d.
