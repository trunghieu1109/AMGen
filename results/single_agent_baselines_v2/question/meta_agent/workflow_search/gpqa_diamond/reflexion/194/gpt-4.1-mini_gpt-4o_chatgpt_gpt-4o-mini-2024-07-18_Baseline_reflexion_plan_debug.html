    <pre>To determine the maximum orbital period of the second planet that will exhibit both transit and occultation events, we need to consider the geometry of the system. The first planet has a transit impact parameter of 0.2, meaning it transits the star at a distance of 0.2 times the star&#39;s radius from the center. The second planet must also transit, so its impact parameter must be less than 1. For occultation, the planet must pass behind the star, which means its orbit must be such that it can be completely obscured by the star. The maximum impact parameter for occultation is 1.5 (the star&#39;s radius in units of the Sun&#39;s radius). The second planet is larger, with a radius of 2.5 Earth radii, so its impact parameter must be less than 1.5 for occultation. Since the second planet shares the same orbital plane, it will have the same inclination as the first planet. The maximum orbital period is determined by the condition that the second planet&#39;s orbit is still within the range that allows both transit and occultation. The orbital period scales with the semi-major axis, which is related to the impact parameter. The first planet&#39;s period is 3 days, and its impact parameter is 0.2. The second planet&#39;s maximum impact parameter for occultation is 1.5. The period scales as the square root of the semi-major axis cubed, so we can estimate the maximum period by considering the ratio of the impact parameters. The maximum period is approximately 3 days * (1.5/0.2)^(3/2). Calculating this gives approximately 33.5 days.
