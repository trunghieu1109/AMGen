Question: Example(question='An electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Find the expectation value of its spin along y-direction, S_y.\nNote: \\sigma_y (in latex format) is: \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & -i \\\\\ni & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}', choice1='-25*hbar/2\n\n', choice2='-12*hbar/25\n\n', choice3='12*hbar/25', choice4='25*hbar/2\n', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, we need to use the spin state of the electron and the spin operator for the y-direction, which is given by the matrix \sigma_y. The spin state is given as (3i, 4), which we can normalize and then use to calculate the expectation value using the formula <S_y> = <psi|S_y|psi>. We will compute this step by step.
