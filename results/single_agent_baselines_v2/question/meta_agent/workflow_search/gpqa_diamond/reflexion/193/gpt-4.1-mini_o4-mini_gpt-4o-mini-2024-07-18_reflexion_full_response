Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent bMbc', content='We enumerate all 2^3=8 spin configurations. For all spins parallel (2 states: +++ and ---), S1S2+S1S3+S2S3=3 so E=−3J and Boltzmann weight e^{3βJ}. For 2 up/1 down or vice versa (6 states), the sum of pair products=−1 so E=J and weight e^{−βJ}. Thus Z=2e^{3βJ}+6e^{−βJ}, corresponding to choice1 (A).\n\nAnswer:A)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
