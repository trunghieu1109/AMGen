Question: Example(question='Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are\nconstrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system\ncorrect to three decimals?', choice1='2.822 x 10^-26', choice2='5.645 x 10^-26', choice3='7.056 x 10^-27', choice4='122.330', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To find the minimum energy of the system, we need to calculate the potential energy between the charges. The potential energy U between two point charges q1 and q2 separated by a distance r is given by the formula U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant (approximately 8.99 x 10^9 N m²/C²). In this case, we have 12 charges of 2e each (where e is the elementary charge, approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 C) at a distance of 2 m from the fixed charge at point P. Each charge contributes U = k * (2e * 2e) / 2 m. Therefore, the total energy U_total = 12 * (k * (2e * 2e) / 2). After calculating this value, we will compare it with the provided choices to find the correct answer.
