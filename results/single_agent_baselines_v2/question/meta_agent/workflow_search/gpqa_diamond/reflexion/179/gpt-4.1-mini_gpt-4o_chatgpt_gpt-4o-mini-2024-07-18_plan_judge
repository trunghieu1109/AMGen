Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To find the minimum energy of the system, we need to calculate the electrostatic potential energy of the configuration. We have 12 charges each with charge 2e at a distance of 2 m from a point P, where the 13th charge, also 2e, is fixed. The potential energy U of a system of point charges is given by U = k * q1 * q2 / r for each pair of charges, where k is Coulomb's constant (8.9875 x 10^9 N m^2/C^2), q1 and q2 are the charges, and r is the distance between them. Here, each of the 12 charges interacts with the charge at P. The charge at P is 2e, and each of the 12 charges is also 2e, so for each pair, q1 = q2 = 2e. The distance r is 2 m. The potential energy for one pair is U_pair = k * (2e) * (2e) / 2. There are 12 such pairs, so the total potential energy is U_total = 12 * U_pair. Substituting the values, e = 1.602 x 10^-19 C, we get U_pair = (8.9875 x 10^9) * (2 * 1.602 x 10^-19)^2 / 2. Calculating this gives U_pair = 4.605 x 10^-28 J. Therefore, U_total = 12 * 4.605 x 10^-28 J = 5.526 x 10^-27 J. Rounding to three decimals, we get 5.526 x 10^-27 J.
