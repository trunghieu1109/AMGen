Question: Example(question='Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are\nconstrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system\ncorrect to three decimals?', choice1='2.822 x 10^-26', choice2='5.645 x 10^-26', choice3='7.056 x 10^-27', choice4='122.330', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: We have 13 charges q=2e, with one at center and 12 on a sphere of radius R=2 m. Total energy U=k∑_{i<j}q_iq_j/r_{ij}=kq^2[12·(1/R)+∑_{outer pairs}1/r_{ij}]. The 12 outer charges minimize repulsion by forming a regular icosahedron inscribed in the sphere. Center–outer contribution: 12·k·4e^2/R≈5.54×10⁻²⁷ J. Outer–outer: 66 pairs with distances a=2.1029 m (30 pairs), b=3.5777 m (30), c=4 m (6), giving ∑1/r≈24.133, so U_oo=4ke^2·24.133≈2.23×10⁻²⁶ J. Sum ≈2.78×10⁻²⁶ J, closest to choice A.
