Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent VvKM', content='Magnons are the Goldstone bosons of spontaneously broken spin-rotation symmetry in a magnet. Pions are (approximate) Goldstone bosons of spontaneously broken chiral symmetry in QCD. Phonons are Goldstone bosons from spontaneously broken continuous translational symmetry in a crystal lattice. Skyrmions, however, are topological soliton solutions and not Nambuâ€“Goldstone modes of a broken continuous symmetry.\n\nAnswer:B)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
