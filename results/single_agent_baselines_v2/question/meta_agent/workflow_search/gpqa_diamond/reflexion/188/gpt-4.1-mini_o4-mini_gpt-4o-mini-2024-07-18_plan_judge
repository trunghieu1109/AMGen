Question: Example(question='Which of the following (effective) particles is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry?', choice1='Magnon', choice2='Skyrmion', choice3='Pion', choice4='Phonon', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: Magnons are the Goldstone bosons of spontaneously broken spin-rotation symmetry in a magnet. Pions are (approximate) Goldstone bosons of spontaneously broken chiral symmetry in QCD. Phonons are Goldstone bosons from spontaneously broken continuous translational symmetry in a crystal lattice. Skyrmions, however, are topological soliton solutions and not Nambuâ€“Goldstone modes of a broken continuous symmetry.
