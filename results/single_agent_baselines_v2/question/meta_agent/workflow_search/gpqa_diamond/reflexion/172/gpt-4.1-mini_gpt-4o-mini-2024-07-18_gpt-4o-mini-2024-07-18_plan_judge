Question: Example(question="If uncertainty in space of electron's location, which is travelling with speed v= 2* 10^8 m/s along x-direction is Δx=0.1 nm . Based on the infromation estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of electron.", choice1='~10^(-19) J', choice2='~10^(-18) J', choice3='~10^(-16) J', choice4='~10^(-17) J', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To find the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of the electron, we will use the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2. We know that Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 x 10^(-9) m. The momentum p of the electron is given by p = mv, where m is the mass of the electron (approximately 9.11 x 10^(-31) kg) and v = 2 x 10^8 m/s. The uncertainty in momentum Δp can be calculated from Δx, and then we can relate Δp to ΔE using ΔE = Δp * v. First, we calculate Δp using Δp = ħ / (2Δx). Then we can find ΔE. Let's calculate it step by step.
