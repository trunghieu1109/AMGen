Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent CNF7', content='We use the Heisenberg uncertainty relation Δx·Δp ≥ ħ/2. Thus Δp ≥ ħ/(2Δx). With Δx = 0.1\u2009nm = 1×10⁻¹⁰\u2009m and ħ ≈1.054×10⁻³⁴\u2009J·s, we get Δp ≥ (1.054×10⁻³⁴)/(2×10⁻¹⁰) ≈5.27×10⁻²⁵\u2009kg·m/s. The uncertainty in kinetic energy ΔE ≈ v·Δp for nonrelativistic electron (p ≈ mv) so ΔE ≥ v·Δp = (2×10⁸\u2009m/s)×(5.27×10⁻²⁵\u2009kg·m/s) ≈1.05×10⁻¹⁶\u2009J. This corresponds to choice C).\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
