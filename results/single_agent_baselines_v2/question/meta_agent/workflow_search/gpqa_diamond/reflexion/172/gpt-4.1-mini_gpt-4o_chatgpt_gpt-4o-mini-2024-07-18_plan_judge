Question: Example(question="If uncertainty in space of electron's location, which is travelling with speed v= 2* 10^8 m/s along x-direction is Δx=0.1 nm . Based on the infromation estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of electron.", choice1='~10^(-19) J', choice2='~10^(-18) J', choice3='~10^(-16) J', choice4='~10^(-17) J', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To find the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of the electron, we can use the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The principle states that Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where Δx is the uncertainty in position, Δp is the uncertainty in momentum, and ħ is the reduced Planck's constant (ħ = h/2π ≈ 1.0545718 × 10^(-34) J·s). Given Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 × 10^(-9) m, we can find Δp. Once we have Δp, we can relate it to ΔE using the relation ΔE = Δp * v, where v is the velocity of the electron. The velocity v is given as 2 × 10^8 m/s. Let's calculate Δp first: Δp ≥ ħ/(2Δx) = 1.0545718 × 10^(-34) J·s / (2 × 0.1 × 10^(-9) m) = 5.272859 × 10^(-25) kg·m/s. Now, calculate ΔE: ΔE = Δp * v = 5.272859 × 10^(-25) kg·m/s * 2 × 10^8 m/s = 1.0545718 × 10^(-16) J. Therefore, the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE is approximately 10^(-16) J.
