Question: Example(question='In an inactive state, a transcription factor subunit awaits an activation signal from the membrane phosphorylation cascade. Upon phosphorylation on the Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, shuttles into the nucleus, and serves in gene transcription. A missense mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. You observe that a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Which of the following molecular phenotypes is most likely observed in the presence of mutation Y?', choice1='loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype', choice2='protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype', choice3='protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele', choice4='change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The question describes a scenario where a transcription factor has a missense mutation X that causes a recessive loss-of-function, and a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain that acts as a dominant-negative mutation. A dominant-negative mutation typically interferes with the function of the wild-type protein, often leading to a loss of function. Given the choices, we need to identify which molecular phenotype is most likely observed with mutation Y. The dominant-negative effect suggests that the presence of mutation Y would disrupt normal dimerization and function of the transcription factor, likely leading to a loss-of-function phenotype. Therefore, the most fitting choice is one that indicates a loss of function due to the presence of mutation Y.
