Question: {'question': 'While designing a high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating at an accelerating voltage of 1000 kV, Mike connected vacuum pumps to create an ultra-high vacuum state (< 10^-9 Torr) in the sample compartment, aiming to minimize the presence of gas molecules for improved electron microscopy.

Mike accurately determined the mean free path of these gas molecules in the vacuum state (< 10^-9 Torr) to be λ1, based on factors such as sample compartment volume, pressure, and temperature. However, upon initiating the electron beam, he made an intriguing observation concerning the mean free path based on electron scattering with the gas molecules. He found that the mean free path was no longer equal to λ1; rather, it was λ2, even though the sample compartment temperature remained the same.\n\nWhat can we conclude about λ2 based on the aforementioned scenario?', 'choice1': "λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation", 'choice2': 'λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1', 'choice3': 'λ2 < λ1', 'choice4': 'λ2 >= 1.22*λ1'}\Pattern: reflexion

Thus λ2>λ1, typically by more than a factor of 1.22 at 1000\u2009keV. Hence λ2 ≥ 1.22·λ1.\n\n### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent cXsv (yourself):\nD)\n\n### feedback #1 by Critic Agent Gp5k:\nThe key point is that electron–gas scattering cross-sections at 1000 kV are much smaller than gas–gas collision cross-sections, so electrons travel farther between collisions. Hence λ₂ must be strictly greater than λ₁, but there’s no justification in the problem for the specific factor 1.22. The answer should simply be λ₂ > λ₁ rather than λ₂ ≥ 1.22·λ₁.\n\nGiven previous attempts and feedback, carefully consider where you could go wrong in your latest attempt.
