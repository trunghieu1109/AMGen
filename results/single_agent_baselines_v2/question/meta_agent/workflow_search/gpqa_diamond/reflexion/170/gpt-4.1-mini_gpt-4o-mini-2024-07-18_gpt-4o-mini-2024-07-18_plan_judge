proposed answer: To determine the order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer for the given substances undergoing electrophilic substitution with bromine, we need to consider the directing effects of the substituents on the benzene ring. Electron-donating groups (EDGs) will favor the para position more than electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs). The order of influence is as follows: 1) C6H5-CH3 (alkyl group, EDG), 2) C6H5-C2H5 (alkyl group, EDG), 3) C6H5-COOH (carboxylic acid, EWG but can have some EDG character), 4) C6H5-COOC2H5 (ester, EWG), 5) C6H5-Cl (halogen, weakly EWG), 6) C6H5-NO2 (strong EWG). The para yield will be highest for the strongest EDGs and lowest for the strongest EWGs. Therefore, the order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer is likely to be influenced by these effects. After analyzing the choices, the correct order is found to be 4<6<2<1<5<3, which corresponds to the influence of the substituents on the para position yield.
