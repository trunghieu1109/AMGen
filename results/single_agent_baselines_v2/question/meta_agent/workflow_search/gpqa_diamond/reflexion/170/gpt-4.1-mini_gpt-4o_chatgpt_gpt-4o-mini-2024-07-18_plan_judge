Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To determine the order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer in electrophilic substitution reactions, we need to consider the directing effects of the substituents on the benzene ring. Activating groups like alkyl groups (e.g., CH3, C2H5) are ortho/para-directing, while deactivating groups like NO2, COOH, and COOC2H5 are meta-directing. Cl is ortho/para-directing but deactivating. The para-isomer yield is higher for ortho/para-directing groups. Therefore, the order from lowest to highest para-isomer yield is: 4 (NO2, meta-directing) < 6 (COOH, meta-directing) < 2 (COOC2H5, meta-directing) < 1 (CH3, ortho/para-directing) < 5 (C2H5, ortho/para-directing) < 3 (Cl, ortho/para-directing).
