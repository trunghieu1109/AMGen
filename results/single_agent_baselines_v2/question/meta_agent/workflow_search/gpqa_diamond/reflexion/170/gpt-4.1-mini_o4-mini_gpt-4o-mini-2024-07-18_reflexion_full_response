Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent Kdyo', content='Electrophilic bromination gives mixtures of ortho and para for o/p‐directors. Para‐fraction increases with steric hindrance and as activation strength decreases (less ortho preference). Among o/p‐directors: C2H5>CH3>Cl in para‐%, and meta‐directors give near zero para: NO2<COOEt<COOH. So ascending: 4<2<6<3<1<5, which is choice 2.\n\nAnswer:B)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
