Question: Example(question='Substances 1-6 undergo an electrophilic substitution reaction with an excess of bromine (it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed):\n1) С6H5-CH3\n2) C6H5-COOC2H5\n3) C6H5-Cl\n4) C6H5-NO2\n5) C6H5-C2H5\n6) C6H5-COOH\nC6H5 - means benzene ring\nArrange the substances in order of increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer.', choice1='3<5<1<6<2<4', choice2='4<2<6<3<1<5', choice3='6<2<4<5<1<3', choice4='4<6<2<1<5<3', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: Electrophilic bromination gives mixtures of ortho and para for o/p‐directors. Para‐fraction increases with steric hindrance and as activation strength decreases (less ortho preference). Among o/p‐directors: C2H5>CH3>Cl in para‐%, and meta‐directors give near zero para: NO2<COOEt<COOH. So ascending: 4<2<6<3<1<5, which is choice 2.
