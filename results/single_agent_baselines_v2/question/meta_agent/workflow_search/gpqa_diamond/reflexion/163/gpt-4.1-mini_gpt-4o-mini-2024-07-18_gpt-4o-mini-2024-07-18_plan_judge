Question: Example(question='Astronomers are studying two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2. Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.', choice1='~ 0.4', choice2='~ 0.7', choice3='~ 0.6\n', choice4='~ 1.2', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: To find the mass ratio of the two binary star systems, we can use the mass function derived from the radial velocity amplitudes and the orbital periods. The mass function relates the masses of the stars to their radial velocity amplitudes and the period of the orbit. For system_1, the total mass can be estimated using the radial velocity amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s, and a period of 2 years. For system_2, the total mass can be estimated using the amplitudes of 15 km/s and 10 km/s, and a period of 1 year. By calculating the total masses for both systems, we can determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2. Given that system_1 has lower radial velocity amplitudes and a longer period, it is expected to be less massive than system_2, leading to a factor greater than 1 indicating that system_1 is more massive than system_2.
