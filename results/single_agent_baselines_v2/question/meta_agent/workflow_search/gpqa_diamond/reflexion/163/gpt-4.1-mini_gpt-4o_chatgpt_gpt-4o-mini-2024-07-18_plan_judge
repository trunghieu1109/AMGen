Question: Example(question='Astronomers are studying two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2. Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.', choice1='~ 0.4', choice2='~ 0.7', choice3='~ 0.6\n', choice4='~ 1.2', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: To find the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we use Kepler's third law and the radial velocity amplitudes. The period of system_1 is 2 years, and the period of system_2 is 1 year. The radial velocity amplitudes for system_1 are 10 km/s and 5 km/s, and for system_2 are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. The total mass of a binary system can be related to the period and the radial velocity amplitudes. The mass ratio can be found using the formula: (M1 + M2) / (M3 + M4) = (P1 / P2)^(2/3) * (K1 + K2) / (K3 + K4), where P is the period and K is the sum of the radial velocity amplitudes. For system_1, K1 + K2 = 15 km/s, and for system_2, K3 + K4 = 25 km/s. Therefore, the mass ratio is (2/1)^(2/3) * (15/25). Calculating this gives us the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2.
