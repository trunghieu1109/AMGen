Question: Example(question='Which of the following issues are the most common sources of difficult-to-spot erroneous results generated in genomics data analysis:\n\n- Mutually incompatible data formats\n- The "chr" / "no chr" confusion\n- Reference assembly mismatch\n- Incorrect ID conversion', choice1='3 and 4', choice2='2 and 3', choice3='All of the above', choice4='2, 3 and 4', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To determine the most common sources of difficult-to-spot erroneous results in genomics data analysis, we need to evaluate each of the listed issues. All of them can lead to errors, but we need to identify which combination is most commonly problematic. The confusion between 'chr' and 'no chr' can lead to mismatches in genomic data, and reference assembly mismatches can cause significant errors in analysis. Incorrect ID conversion can also lead to misinterpretation of data. Therefore, it seems that all of these issues can contribute to errors, making 'All of the above' a strong candidate.
