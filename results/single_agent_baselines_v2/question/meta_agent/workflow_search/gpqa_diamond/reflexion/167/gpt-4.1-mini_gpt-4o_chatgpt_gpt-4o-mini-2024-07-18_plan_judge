Question: Example(question='Which of the following issues are the most common sources of difficult-to-spot erroneous results generated in genomics data analysis:\n\n- Mutually incompatible data formats\n- The "chr" / "no chr" confusion\n- Reference assembly mismatch\n- Incorrect ID conversion', choice1='3 and 4', choice2='2 and 3', choice3='All of the above', choice4='2, 3 and 4', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To determine the most common sources of difficult-to-spot erroneous results in genomics data analysis, we need to evaluate each option. Mutually incompatible data formats can lead to errors if data from different sources are not properly integrated. The 'chr' / 'no chr' confusion refers to inconsistencies in chromosome naming conventions, which can cause issues when aligning or comparing genomic data. Reference assembly mismatch occurs when different reference genomes are used, leading to discrepancies in data interpretation. Incorrect ID conversion can result in misidentification of genes or variants. All these issues are common in genomics data analysis and can lead to erroneous results. Therefore, the most comprehensive answer is that all of these issues are common sources of errors.
