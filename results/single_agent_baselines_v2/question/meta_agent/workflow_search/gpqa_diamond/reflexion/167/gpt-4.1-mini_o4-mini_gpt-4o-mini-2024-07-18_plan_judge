Question: Example(question='Which of the following issues are the most common sources of difficult-to-spot erroneous results generated in genomics data analysis:\n\n- Mutually incompatible data formats\n- The "chr" / "no chr" confusion\n- Reference assembly mismatch\n- Incorrect ID conversion', choice1='3 and 4', choice2='2 and 3', choice3='All of the above', choice4='2, 3 and 4', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: All four listed issues—data format incompatibilities, chr/no chr confusion, reference assembly mismatches, and incorrect ID conversions—are common, subtle sources of errors in genomics analyses. Therefore the answer is “All of the above.”
