Question: {'question': 'There has been an outbreak of an viral infectious disease in your city. You have been asked to design a molecular diagnostic kit for quick detection of this retrovirus. How would you go about designing this kit?', 'choice1': 'First you identify the virus by performing DNA sequencing. You then develop a PCR kit for  quick and accurate diagnosis', 'choice2': 'First you identify the IgG antibodies for the infection. You then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG antibodies for quick \n and accurate diagnosis.', 'choice3': 'First you identify the virus using the information about the symptoms, provided by the affected patients. You then design a nested PCR kit based on the information for quick diagnosis.', 'choice4': 'First you identify the virus by performing cDNA sequencing.  You then develop a real time PCR kit for quick and accurate diagnosis.'}\Pattern: reflexion
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent DmaR', content='To detect a retrovirus (an RNA virus) quickly and accurately, we need to first characterize its RNA genome by converting it to complementary DNA (cDNA) and sequencing that. Once we know the viral sequence, we can design specific primers and probes for a real-time (quantitative) PCR assay, which allows rapid, sensitive, and specific detection of the viral cDNA in patient samples. This approach is superior to antibody detection (which takes time for seroconversion) and nested PCR (more laborious and contamination-prone), and DNA sequencing alone is insufficient for an RNA virus.\n\nAnswer:D)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
