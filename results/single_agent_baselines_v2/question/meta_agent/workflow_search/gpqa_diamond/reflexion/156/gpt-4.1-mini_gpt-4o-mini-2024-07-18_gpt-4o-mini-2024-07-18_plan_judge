Question: Example(question='There has been an outbreak of an viral infectious disease in your city. You have been asked to design a molecular diagnostic kit for quick detection of this retrovirus. How would you go about designing this kit?', choice1='First you identify the virus by performing DNA sequencing. You then develop a PCR kit for  quick and accurate diagnosis', choice2='First you identify the IgG antibodies for the infection. You then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG antibodies for quick \n and accurate diagnosis.', choice3='First you identify the virus using the information about the symptoms, provided by the affected patients. You then design a nested PCR kit based on the information for quick diagnosis.', choice4='First you identify the virus by performing cDNA sequencing.  You then develop a real time PCR kit for quick and accurate diagnosis.', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To design a molecular diagnostic kit for a viral infectious disease, especially a retrovirus, the most effective approach is to identify the virus's genetic material. Retroviruses have RNA genomes, so the first step would be to convert the RNA to complementary DNA (cDNA) using reverse transcription. After that, a real-time PCR kit can be developed to amplify and detect the cDNA, allowing for quick and accurate diagnosis. This method is preferred over antibody detection or symptom-based identification, as it directly targets the virus's genetic material.
