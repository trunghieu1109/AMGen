Question: Example(question='There has been an outbreak of an viral infectious disease in your city. You have been asked to design a molecular diagnostic kit for quick detection of this retrovirus. How would you go about designing this kit?', choice1='First you identify the virus by performing DNA sequencing. You then develop a PCR kit for  quick and accurate diagnosis', choice2='First you identify the IgG antibodies for the infection. You then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG antibodies for quick \n and accurate diagnosis.', choice3='First you identify the virus using the information about the symptoms, provided by the affected patients. You then design a nested PCR kit based on the information for quick diagnosis.', choice4='First you identify the virus by performing cDNA sequencing.  You then develop a real time PCR kit for quick and accurate diagnosis.', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To design a molecular diagnostic kit for a retrovirus, the first step is to identify the virus. Retroviruses have RNA genomes, so sequencing the viral RNA is crucial. This is typically done by converting the RNA into complementary DNA (cDNA) using reverse transcription, followed by sequencing. Once the viral genome is identified, specific primers and probes can be designed for a PCR-based diagnostic test. Real-time PCR (qPCR) is a common method for detecting viral RNA because it is sensitive and allows for quantification. Therefore, the correct approach involves identifying the virus through cDNA sequencing and then developing a real-time PCR kit.
