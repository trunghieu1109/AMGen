Question: {'question': 'Consider an aperture, which shapes like a N-sided polygon. All the apothems are of the same length a. When a monochromatic light (of wavelength \\lambda), travelling along z-axis, falls vertically on this aperture, it creates a series of intensity maxima and minima in the far field region. What is the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large ?

Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent Kygp', content='As N→∞ the aperture is circular of radius a, giving the Airy diffraction pattern. Zeros occur when k a θ = x_n where x1≈3.832, x2≈7.016. Thus θ1 = x1λ/(2πa)=0.61λ/a, θ2=1.116λ/a, so the angular separation between the first two minima (on one side) is θ2–θ1≈0.506λ/a, corresponding to choice 4 → D).\n\nAnswer:D)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
