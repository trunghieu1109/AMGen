Question: Example(question='Consider an aperture, which shapes like a N-sided polygon. All the apothems are of the same length a. When a monochromatic light (of wavelength \\lambda), travelling along z-axis, falls vertically on this aperture, it creates a series of intensity maxima and minima in the far field region. What is the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large ? Assume that the related angles are small so that tan theta = theta approximation can be taken.', choice1='1.220 \\lambda /a ', choice2='0.610 \\lambda / a', choice3='0.500 \\lambda / a', choice4='0.506 \\lambda / a', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: As N→∞ the aperture is circular of radius a, giving the Airy diffraction pattern. Zeros occur when k a θ = x_n where x1≈3.832, x2≈7.016. Thus θ1 = x1λ/(2πa)=0.61λ/a, θ2=1.116λ/a, so the angular separation between the first two minima (on one side) is θ2–θ1≈0.506λ/a, corresponding to choice 4 → D).
