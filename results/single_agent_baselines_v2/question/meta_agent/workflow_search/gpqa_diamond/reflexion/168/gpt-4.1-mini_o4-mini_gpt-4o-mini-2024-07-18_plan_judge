Question: Example(question='You are studying a nuclear decay which converts two heavy nucleons of flavor A to another flavor B, while simultaneously emitting two much lighter particles E and V. In short, 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V. It is known that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous, with some endpoint value Q.\n\nA variant of this decay emits one exotic, massless particle M instead of the 2V. In this case, how does the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles compare to that of the original decay?', choice1='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint increases.', choice2='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases.', choice3='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.', choice4='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint decreases.', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The original 2νββ decay (2A→2B +2E +2V) is a four-body final state giving a continuous summed-electron energy spectrum with endpoint Q. Replacing two neutrinos with one massless M yields a three-body final state (2E + M), still continuous, and since M can take zero energy the maximum summed electron energy remains at Q. None of the offered choices states “continuous with unchanged endpoint,” but choice B is the only one preserving continuity of the spectrum.
