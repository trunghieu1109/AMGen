Question: Example(question='Very large number of neutrinos produced by the Sun reach the Earth (very large flux of neutrinos, defined as the number of neutrinos per cm^2, per second).\n\nLet us assume that, hypothetically, the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the core of the Sun about 8 and a half minutes ago, while all other reactions remained as they were.\n\nWhat would be the approximate ratio of the flux between two bands of neutrino energies of 700-800 KeV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). \n\nFlux (band 1) / flux (band 2) is:\n\n(Note: we are talking about stopping the pp-III branch, not pp-II, pp-I or any other. Itâ€™s not a typo or something like that.)\n(Note 2: solar neutrino flavor changes happen, but do not play a role here.)', choice1='0.1 (10^-1).', choice2='10.', choice3='1.', choice4='0.01 (10^-2).', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The pp-III branch of the proton-proton chain in the Sun produces high-energy neutrinos, particularly from the decay of Boron-8, which are typically above 1 MeV. The energy ranges given (700-800 keV and 800-900 keV) are not typical for pp-III neutrinos, which means that stopping the pp-III branch would not significantly affect these energy bands. Therefore, the flux ratio between these bands would remain largely unchanged, suggesting a ratio close to 1.
