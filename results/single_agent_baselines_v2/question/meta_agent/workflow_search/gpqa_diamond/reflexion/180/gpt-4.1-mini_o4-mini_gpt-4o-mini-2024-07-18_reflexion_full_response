Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent clEh', content='We want the ratio of solar neutrino flux in the 700–800 keV band versus the 800–900 keV band if the pp-III (⁸B) branch is turned off 8.5 min ago. After that time no 8B neutrinos reach Earth, so band 1 loses its only significant source (⁸B), while band 2 still has the ⁷Be line at 862 keV (flux ≃5×10⁹ cm⁻²s⁻¹). Other branches (CNO) contribute ≲10⁸ cm⁻²s⁻¹ spread over energies and are negligible. Thus band 1 flux ≃0 relative to band 2 ≃5×10⁹, giving a ratio ≪1; the nearest choice is 10⁻².\n\nAnswer:D) 0.01', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
