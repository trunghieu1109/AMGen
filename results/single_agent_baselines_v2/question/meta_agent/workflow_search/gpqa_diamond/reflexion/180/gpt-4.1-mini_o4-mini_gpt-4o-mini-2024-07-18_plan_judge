Question: Example(question='Very large number of neutrinos produced by the Sun reach the Earth (very large flux of neutrinos, defined as the number of neutrinos per cm^2, per second).\n\nLet us assume that, hypothetically, the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the core of the Sun about 8 and a half minutes ago, while all other reactions remained as they were.\n\nWhat would be the approximate ratio of the flux between two bands of neutrino energies of 700-800 KeV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). \n\nFlux (band 1) / flux (band 2) is:\n\n(Note: we are talking about stopping the pp-III branch, not pp-II, pp-I or any other. It’s not a typo or something like that.)\n(Note 2: solar neutrino flavor changes happen, but do not play a role here.)', choice1='0.1 (10^-1).', choice2='10.', choice3='1.', choice4='0.01 (10^-2).', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: We want the ratio of solar neutrino flux in the 700–800 keV band versus the 800–900 keV band if the pp-III (⁸B) branch is turned off 8.5 min ago. After that time no 8B neutrinos reach Earth, so band 1 loses its only significant source (⁸B), while band 2 still has the ⁷Be line at 862 keV (flux ≃5×10⁹ cm⁻²s⁻¹). Other branches (CNO) contribute ≲10⁸ cm⁻²s⁻¹ spread over energies and are negligible. Thus band 1 flux ≃0 relative to band 2 ≃5×10⁹, giving a ratio ≪1; the nearest choice is 10⁻².
