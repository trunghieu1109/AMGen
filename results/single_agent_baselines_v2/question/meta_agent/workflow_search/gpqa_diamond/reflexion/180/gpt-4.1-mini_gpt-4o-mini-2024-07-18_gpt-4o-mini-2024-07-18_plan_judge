Question: Example(question='Very large number of neutrinos produced by the Sun reach the Earth (very large flux of neutrinos, defined as the number of neutrinos per cm^2, per second).\n\nLet us assume that, hypothetically, the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the core of the Sun about 8 and a half minutes ago, while all other reactions remained as they were.\n\nWhat would be the approximate ratio of the flux between two bands of neutrino energies of 700-800 KeV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). \n\nFlux (band 1) / flux (band 2) is:\n\n(Note: we are talking about stopping the pp-III branch, not pp-II, pp-I or any other. Itâ€™s not a typo or something like that.)\n(Note 2: solar neutrino flavor changes happen, but do not play a role here.)', choice1='0.1 (10^-1).', choice2='10.', choice3='1.', choice4='0.01 (10^-2).', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To determine the ratio of the flux of neutrinos in the two energy bands (700-800 KeV and 800-900 KeV) after stopping the pp-III branch, we need to consider the characteristics of neutrino production in the Sun. The pp-III branch produces neutrinos primarily in the energy range of 0.1 to 0.5 MeV, which means that stopping this branch would primarily affect the lower energy neutrinos. The neutrinos in the 700-800 KeV and 800-900 KeV bands are likely produced by other processes, such as the pp-I and pp-II branches, which are less affected by the stopping of the pp-III branch. Therefore, the flux in the higher energy band (800-900 keV) would be relatively higher compared to the lower energy band (700-800 keV) since the pp-III branch does not contribute significantly to these energy ranges. Based on this reasoning, the ratio of flux (band 1) to flux (band 2) is expected to be low, likely around 0.1 (10^-1).
