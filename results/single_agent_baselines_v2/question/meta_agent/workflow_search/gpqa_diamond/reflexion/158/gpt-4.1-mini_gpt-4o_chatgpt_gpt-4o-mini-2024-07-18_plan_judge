Question: Example(question='Observations of a quasar across the electromagnetic spectrum are being carried out. Focusing on the near infrared and optical spectrum, there is a peak at wavelength of about 790 nm, and at shorter wavelengths < 790 nm the flux drops significantly.\n\nIf we lived in a universe defined by Lambda-CDM model such that the current Hubble constant is 70 km s^-1 Mpc^-1, matter density parameter is 0.3, dark energy density parameter is 0.7, and universe is flat,\nwhat can be assumed about the value of the comoving distance (for scale factor a=1) of this quasar from the Earth?', choice1='8 Gpc', choice2='9 Gpc', choice3='7 Gpc', choice4='6 Gpc', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The peak wavelength of 790 nm suggests a redshifted emission line. In a Lambda-CDM universe with the given parameters, we can estimate the redshift and then the comoving distance. The redshift z can be estimated from the observed wavelength and the rest wavelength. Assuming the rest wavelength is around 121.6 nm (Lyman-alpha), the redshift z is approximately 790/121.6 - 1. Using the cosmological parameters, we can calculate the comoving distance using the formula for comoving distance in a flat universe. The comoving distance is related to the redshift and the Hubble constant. Given the choices, we estimate the comoving distance to be around 8 Gpc.
