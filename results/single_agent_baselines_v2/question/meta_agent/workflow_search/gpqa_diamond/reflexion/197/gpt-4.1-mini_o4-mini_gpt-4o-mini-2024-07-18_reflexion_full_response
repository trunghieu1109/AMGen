Question: {'question': 'We have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate, where the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M and the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16. What will be the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species in the solution?

Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent FTju', content='We assume free [SCN–] ≈ 0.1 M since SCN– is in large excess over Co(II). The stepwise formation gives: β1[SCN] = 9·0.1 = 0.9; β2[SCN]2 = 40·(0.1)2 = 0.4; β3[SCN]3 = 63·(0.1)3 = 0.063; β4[SCN]4 = 16·(0.1)4 = 0.0016. The total distribution denominator is 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646. The fraction of Co(SCN)2 is (0.4)/(2.3646) ≈ 0.169 or 16.9%.\n\nAnswer:A)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
