Question: Example(question='We have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate, where the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M and the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16. What will be the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species in the solution? ', choice1='16.9%', choice2='42.3%', choice3='25.6%', choice4='38.1%', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes, we need to calculate the concentrations of all cobalt species in the solution using the provided stability constants. The cobalt(II) ions can form various complexes with thiocyanate ions, and we will focus on the dithiocyanato complex (which corresponds to β2). We will calculate the concentration of the dithiocyanato complex and the total concentration of cobalt species to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex among all cobalt species.
