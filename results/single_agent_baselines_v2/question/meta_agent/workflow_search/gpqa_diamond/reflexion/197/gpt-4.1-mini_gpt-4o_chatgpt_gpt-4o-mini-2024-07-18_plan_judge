Question: Example(question='We have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate, where the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M and the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16. What will be the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species in the solution? ', choice1='16.9%', choice2='42.3%', choice3='25.6%', choice4='38.1%', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes, we need to calculate the concentration of Co(SCN)2 in the solution and compare it to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species. The formation of cobalt thiocyanato complexes can be described by the following equilibria: Co + SCN- ⇌ Co(SCN), Co(SCN) + SCN- ⇌ Co(SCN)2, Co(SCN)2 + SCN- ⇌ Co(SCN)3, and Co(SCN)3 + SCN- ⇌ Co(SCN)4. The stability constants are given as β1 = 9, β2 = 40, β3 = 63, and β4 = 16. The concentration of each complex can be calculated using these constants and the initial concentrations of Co(II) and SCN-. The concentration of Co(SCN)2 is given by [Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co] * [SCN-]^2. The total concentration of cobalt species is the sum of all complexes: [Co] + [Co(SCN)] + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3] + [Co(SCN)4]. The percentage of Co(SCN)2 is then ([Co(SCN)2] / total concentration) * 100%.
