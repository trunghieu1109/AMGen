Question: Example(question='Consider a rhombohedral crystal, with the interatomic distance of 10 Angstrom and the angles $\\quad\\alpha=\\beta=\\gamma=30^{0}$. What is the interplanar distance of the (111) plane of the crystal?\n', choice1='9.54 Angstrom', choice2='8.95 Angstrom', choice3='9.08 Angstrom', choice4='10.05 Angstrom', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: We need the interplanar spacing d_{111} in a rhombohedral cell with a=10 Å and α=30°. The metric tensor G_ij = a_i·a_j has diagonal entries a^2=100 and off‐diagonals a^2 cosα=100·0.8660=86.60. Its eigenvalues are λ1=a^2+2a^2 cosα=273.2 (along [111]) and λ2=a^2−a^2 cosα=13.4 (degenerate). The inverse metric has eigenvalue 1/273.2 along [111]. For (hkl)=(1,1,1) the component along [111] is √3, so 1/d^2 = (√3)^2·(1/273.2)=3/273.2=0.010977 ⇒ d=1/√0.010977≈9.54 Å.
