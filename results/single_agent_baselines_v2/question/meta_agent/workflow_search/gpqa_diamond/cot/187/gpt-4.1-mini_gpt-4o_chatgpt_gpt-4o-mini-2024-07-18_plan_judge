Question: Example(question='Consider a rhombohedral crystal, with the interatomic distance of 10 Angstrom and the angles $\\quad\\alpha=\\beta=\\gamma=30^{0}$. What is the interplanar distance of the (111) plane of the crystal?\n', choice1='9.54 Angstrom', choice2='8.95 Angstrom', choice3='9.08 Angstrom', choice4='10.05 Angstrom', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: To find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal, we use the formula for the distance between (hkl) planes in a rhombohedral lattice. The formula is given by: 

$$ d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + kl + hl)\cos(\alpha)}} $$

where $a$ is the interatomic distance and $\alpha = \beta = \gamma$ is the angle between the axes. 

For the (111) plane, we have $h = k = l = 1$. The interatomic distance $a = 10$ Angstrom and $\alpha = 30^{\circ}$. 

We substitute these values into the formula:

$$ d_{111} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 2(1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 1) \cos(30^{\circ})}} $$

Calculate $\cos(30^{\circ}) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$.

Substitute this into the formula:

$$ d_{111} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{3 + 6 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}} $$

Calculate $6 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = 3\sqrt{3}$.

Then the formula becomes:

$$ d_{111} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{3 + 3\sqrt{3}}} $$

Calculate the numerical value of the denominator and then the interplanar distance.
