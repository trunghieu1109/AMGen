proposed answer: To determine the mass dimension of \(\kappa\), we need to consider the mass dimensions of the other terms in the interaction Lagrangian \(\mathcal{L}_{int}=\kappa\bar{\psi}\sigma_{\mu\nu}\psi F^{\mu\nu}\). The field \(\psi\) has mass dimension \([\psi]_M = \frac{3}{2}\). The field strength tensor \(F^{\mu\nu}\) has mass dimension \([F^{\mu\nu}]_M = 2\). The term \(\sigma_{\mu\nu}\) is a combination of gamma matrices and commutators, so it is dimensionless. Therefore, the mass dimension of \(\bar{\psi}\sigma_{\mu\nu}\psi\) is \([\bar{\psi}\sigma_{\mu\nu}\psi]_M = [\bar{\psi}]_M + [\psi]_M = \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} = 3\). The Lagrangian density \(\mathcal{L}\) must have mass dimension 4. Therefore, \([\kappa]_M + 3 + 2 = 4\), which gives \([\kappa]_M = -1\). A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimension. Since \([\kappa]_M = -1\), the theory is not renormalizable.
