Question: Example(question='In an industrial research lab, a scientist performs ethylene polymerization with a homogeneous organometallic catalyst system, generating a polymer of high density. He intends to add a second catalyst system to introduce regular branches in the polymer backbone, also only using ethylene as the reactant. He consults a senior scientist, who gives the following statements. “Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US. One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators. Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step. Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.”\nWhich of these four statements is correct regarding the formation of a polymer with regular branches using only ethylene as the monomer and a dual catalyst system?', choice1='Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.', choice2='Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.', choice3='One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.', choice4='Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The goal is to generate HDPE with regular short branches by in-situ generating α-olefin comonomers from ethylene using a second homogeneous catalyst. Industrial implementation of two homogeneous catalysts in one reactor (choice 1) does not exist. Group VIa metals (Cr/Mo/W) don’t catalyze the needed oligomerization step (choice 3 is false). Noble-metal catalysts (Pd, Pt) can do it but their price is prohibitive (choice 4 is true but too general). Crucially, the oligomerization catalysts require non-aluminum activators (e.g. perfluoroaryl borates); aluminum alkyls (MAO) deactivate them, so Al-based activators don’t work for that step. Hence choice 2 is correct.
