Question: Example(question='In an industrial research lab, a scientist performs ethylene polymerization with a homogeneous organometallic catalyst system, generating a polymer of high density. He intends to add a second catalyst system to introduce regular branches in the polymer backbone, also only using ethylene as the reactant. He consults a senior scientist, who gives the following statements. “Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US. One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators. Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step. Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.”\nWhich of these four statements is correct regarding the formation of a polymer with regular branches using only ethylene as the monomer and a dual catalyst system?', choice1='Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.', choice2='Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.', choice3='One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.', choice4='Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: To determine which statement is correct, we need to consider the context of ethylene polymerization and the use of dual catalyst systems to introduce branching. In industrial practice, systems like the Dow INSITE technology or the use of metallocene catalysts with different activators are known for producing branched polyethylene. Statement 1 suggests that dual catalyst systems are used industrially, which is true for producing different types of polyethylene. Statement 2 mentions aluminum-based activators not working for a specific step, which is incorrect as aluminum alkyls are commonly used as activators. Statement 3 refers to group VIa transition metals, which are not typically used for this purpose; group IVb metals like zirconium and titanium are more common. Statement 4 mentions noble metals being too expensive, which is generally true but not directly relevant to the branching process. Therefore, statement 1 is the most accurate regarding the industrial implementation of such systems.
