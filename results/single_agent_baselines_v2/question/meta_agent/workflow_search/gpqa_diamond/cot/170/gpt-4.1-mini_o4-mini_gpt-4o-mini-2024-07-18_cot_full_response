Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent cXsv', content='We compare the para‐isomer fraction (by weight) for each substituent. The strongest meta‐director (NO2) gives almost no para product, then benzoic acid (–COOH) gives a very small para fraction, then ethyl benzoate (–COOEt) a bit more, then the activating alkyls (toluene and ethylbenzene) give moderate para fractions (toluene < ethylbenzene because CH3 causes stronger ortho preference), and the deactivating but ortho/para‐directing Cl gives the highest para fraction. So the order from lowest to highest is 4<6<2<1<5<3, corresponding to choice D).\n\nAnswer:D)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
