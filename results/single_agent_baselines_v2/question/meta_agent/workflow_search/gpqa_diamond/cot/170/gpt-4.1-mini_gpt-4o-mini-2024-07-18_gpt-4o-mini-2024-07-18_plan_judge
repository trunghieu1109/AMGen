Question: Example(question='Substances 1-6 undergo an electrophilic substitution reaction with an excess of bromine (it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed):\n1) ะก6H5-CH3\n2) C6H5-COOC2H5\n3) C6H5-Cl\n4) C6H5-NO2\n5) C6H5-C2H5\n6) C6H5-COOH\nC6H5 - means benzene ring\nArrange the substances in order of increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer.', choice1='3<5<1<6<2<4', choice2='4<2<6<3<1<5', choice3='6<2<4<5<1<3', choice4='4<6<2<1<5<3', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: To determine the order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer for the given substances, we need to consider the directing effects of the substituents on the benzene ring. Electron-donating groups (EDGs) typically direct electrophilic substitutions to the ortho and para positions, while electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) direct substitutions to the meta position. The order will depend on how strongly each substituent directs electrophilic substitution to the para position. Based on the nature of the substituents in the list, I will analyze each one: 1) C6H5-CH3 (EDG, prefers para), 2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (EDG, prefers para), 3) C6H5-Cl (weakly EWG, prefers ortho/para), 4) C6H5-NO2 (strong EWG, prefers meta), 5) C6H5-C2H5 (EDG, prefers para), 6) C6H5-COOH (weakly EWG, prefers meta). Therefore, the substances can be arranged based on their ability to yield para-isomers, leading to the correct choice.
