Question: Example(question='Substances 1-6 undergo an electrophilic substitution reaction with an excess of bromine (it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed):\n1) С6H5-CH3\n2) C6H5-COOC2H5\n3) C6H5-Cl\n4) C6H5-NO2\n5) C6H5-C2H5\n6) C6H5-COOH\nC6H5 - means benzene ring\nArrange the substances in order of increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer.', choice1='3<5<1<6<2<4', choice2='4<2<6<3<1<5', choice3='6<2<4<5<1<3', choice4='4<6<2<1<5<3', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: We compare the para‐isomer fraction (by weight) for each substituent. The strongest meta‐director (NO2) gives almost no para product, then benzoic acid (–COOH) gives a very small para fraction, then ethyl benzoate (–COOEt) a bit more, then the activating alkyls (toluene and ethylbenzene) give moderate para fractions (toluene < ethylbenzene because CH3 causes stronger ortho preference), and the deactivating but ortho/para‐directing Cl gives the highest para fraction. So the order from lowest to highest is 4<6<2<1<5<3, corresponding to choice D).
