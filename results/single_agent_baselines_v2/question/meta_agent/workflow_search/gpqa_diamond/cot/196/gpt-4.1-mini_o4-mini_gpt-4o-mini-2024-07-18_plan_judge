Question: Example(question='Compound X, which has the following IR and NMR data, reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Identify the final product.\nIR: 3400–2500 cm-1, 1720 cm-1, 1610 cm-1, 1450 cm-1\n1H NMR: 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H), 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H), 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).', choice1='1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene', choice2='4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid', choice3='2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid', choice4='1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The IR shows a broad 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ and a 1720 cm⁻¹ band indicating a carboxylic acid. The aromatic 1610 and 1450 cm⁻¹ peaks together with the 1H NMR signals at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm (each 2H, d) tell us the ring is para-substituted. The side chain’s 1H NMR pattern (2.9 m for a CH, 1.7 m for CH2, 1.4 d for CH3 and 0.9 t for CH3) fits a sec-butyl group. Thus X is p-sec-butylbenzoic acid (choice 2). Treatment with HI/red P reduces –COOH to –CH3 on the ring, converting the acid into a methyl substituent and giving p-sec-butyl-methylbenzene (option A).
