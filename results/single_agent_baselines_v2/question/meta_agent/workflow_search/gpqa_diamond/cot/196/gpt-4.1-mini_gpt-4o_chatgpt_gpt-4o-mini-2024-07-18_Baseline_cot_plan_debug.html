    <pre>First, analyze the IR data: the broad peak at 3400–2500 cm-1 suggests an O-H stretch, typical of a carboxylic acid. The peak at 1720 cm-1 indicates a carbonyl group, consistent with a carboxylic acid. The peak at 1610 cm-1 suggests an aromatic C=C stretch. The 1H NMR data shows a broad singlet at 10.5 ppm, which is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton. The doublets at 8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm indicate an aromatic ring with two sets of equivalent protons, likely a para-substituted benzene. The multiplet at 2.9 ppm, multiplet at 1.7 ppm, doublet at 1.4 ppm, and triplet at 0.9 ppm suggest an alkyl chain. Given the IR and NMR data, compound X is likely a para-substituted benzoic acid. Reacting with red phosphorus and HI, a common reaction is the reduction of carboxylic acids to hydrocarbons, removing the carboxylic group. Therefore, the final product will be the aromatic compound with the alkyl chain intact. The choices indicate aromatic compounds with alkyl chains. &#39;4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid&#39; matches the description of the starting carboxylic acid, and after reduction, it becomes &#39;1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene&#39;.
