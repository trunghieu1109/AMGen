    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Astronomers are interested in the luminosities of two stars. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2. The mass of Star_1 is also larger by the same factor (1.5 times). Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same. Astronomers also calculated the radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;~2.25&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;~2.35&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;~2.32&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;~2.23\n&#39;}

    <pre>To determine the luminosity of the stars, we can use the Stefan-Boltzmann Law, which states that the luminosity (L) of a black body is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature (T) and the surface area (A) of the star. The surface area is given by A = 4 * pi * R^2, where R is the radius of the star. Since both stars have the same peak wavelength, we can assume they have the same temperature. Therefore, the luminosity ratio can be determined by the ratio of their surface areas. Given that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2, we can calculate the ratio of their luminosities as follows: L1 / L2 = (R1^2) / (R2^2) = (1.5R2)^2 / (R2^2) = 2.25. Thus, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of approximately 2.25.
