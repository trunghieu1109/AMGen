Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent zrGJ', content='We know Δx=0.1\u2009nm=1×10⁻¹⁰\u2009m. By Heisenberg, Δx·Δp≈h/(4π) so Δp≈6.63×10⁻³⁴/(4π·1×10⁻¹⁰)≈5.3×10⁻²⁵\u2009kg·m/s. The electron’s momentum p=mv=9.11×10⁻³¹·2×10⁸≈1.82×10⁻²²\u2009kg·m/s. For nonrelativistic energy E=p²/(2m), small uncertainties give ΔE≈p·Δp/m≈(1.82×10⁻²²·5.3×10⁻²⁵)/(9.11×10⁻³¹)≈1.05×10⁻¹⁶\u2009J.\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
