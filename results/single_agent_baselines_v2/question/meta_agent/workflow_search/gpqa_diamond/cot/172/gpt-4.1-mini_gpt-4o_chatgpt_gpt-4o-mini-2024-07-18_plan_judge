proposed answer: We are given the uncertainty in position Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 x 10^-9 m and the velocity v = 2 x 10^8 m/s. We need to find the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of the electron. We can use Heisenberg's uncertainty principle in terms of position and momentum: Δx Δp ≥ ħ/2, where Δp is the uncertainty in momentum and ħ is the reduced Planck's constant (ħ = h/2π ≈ 1.0545718 x 10^-34 J·s). From Δx Δp ≥ ħ/2, we find Δp ≥ ħ/(2Δx). Since momentum p = mv, the uncertainty in kinetic energy ΔE can be related to Δp. For a non-relativistic approximation, ΔE ≈ (Δp)^2/(2m), but since the speed is close to the speed of light, we should consider relativistic effects. However, for a rough estimate, we can assume ΔE ≈ Δp v. Thus, we calculate Δp = ħ/(2Δx) and then ΔE = Δp v. Substituting the given values, we find Δp = 1.0545718 x 10^-34 J·s / (2 x 0.1 x 10^-9 m) = 5.272859 x 10^-25 kg·m/s. Then, ΔE = Δp v = 5.272859 x 10^-25 kg·m/s x 2 x 10^8 m/s = 1.0545718 x 10^-16 J. This corresponds to choice C, which is ~10^(-16) J.
