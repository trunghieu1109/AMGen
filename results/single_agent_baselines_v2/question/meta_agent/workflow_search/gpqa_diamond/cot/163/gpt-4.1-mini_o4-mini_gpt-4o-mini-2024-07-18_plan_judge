Question: Example(question='Astronomers are studying two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2. Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.', choice1='~ 0.4', choice2='~ 0.7', choice3='~ 0.6\n', choice4='~ 1.2', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: We have two eclipsing binaries with orbital periods P1=2 yr and P2=1 yr, and RV semi‐amplitudes sums K1+K2=15 km/s and K′1+K′2=25 km/s. For a circular, edge‐on binary, total mass M∝P(K1+K2)^3. Thus M1/M2=(2 yr×15^3)/(1 yr×25^3)=2×3375/15625≈6750/15625≈0.432≈0.4.
