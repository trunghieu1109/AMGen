Question: Example(question='Astronomers are studying two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2. Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.', choice1='~ 0.4', choice2='~ 0.7', choice3='~ 0.6\n', choice4='~ 1.2', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: To find the ratio of the masses of the two binary systems, we can use Kepler's third law and the properties of binary star systems. For a binary system, the period P and the semi-major axis a are related by Kepler's third law: P^2 = (4π^2/G(M1 + M2)) * a^3, where M1 and M2 are the masses of the two stars. The radial velocity amplitudes give us information about the semi-major axis and the mass ratio. The ratio of the masses of the two systems can be found by comparing the total mass (M1 + M2) for both systems. Using the radial velocity amplitudes (K1 and K2), we can determine that the total mass is proportional to P(K1 + K2)^3. For system_1, P1 = 2 years, K1 = 10 km/s, K2 = 5 km/s. For system_2, P2 = 1 year, K1 = 15 km/s, K2 = 10 km/s. The ratio of the total masses is (P1(K1_1 + K2_1)^3) / (P2(K1_2 + K2_2)^3). Plugging in the values, we get (2 * (10 + 5)^3) / (1 * (15 + 10)^3) = (2 * 15^3) / (25^3) = (2 * 3375) / 15625 = 6750 / 15625 ≈ 0.432. Therefore, system_1 is approximately 0.4 times as massive as system_2.
