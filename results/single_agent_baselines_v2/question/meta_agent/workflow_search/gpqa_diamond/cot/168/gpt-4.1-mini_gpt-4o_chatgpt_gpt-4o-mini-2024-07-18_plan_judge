Question: Example(question='You are studying a nuclear decay which converts two heavy nucleons of flavor A to another flavor B, while simultaneously emitting two much lighter particles E and V. In short, 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V. It is known that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous, with some endpoint value Q.\n\nA variant of this decay emits one exotic, massless particle M instead of the 2V. In this case, how does the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles compare to that of the original decay?', choice1='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint increases.', choice2='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases.', choice3='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.', choice4='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint decreases.', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: In the original decay, 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V, the outgoing E particles have a continuous energy spectrum with an endpoint value Q because the neutrinos V can carry away varying amounts of energy and momentum. In the variant decay, 2A -> 2B + 2E + M, the massless particle M replaces the 2 neutrinos. Since M is massless, it can also carry away varying amounts of energy, similar to the neutrinos, so the spectrum of the E particles remains continuous. However, with fewer particles sharing the energy (since there is only 1 M instead of 2 V), the endpoint of the energy spectrum for the E particles will increase, as they can now take more energy compared to the original scenario. Therefore, the spectrum remains continuous, but the endpoint increases.
