Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent Kygp', content='In the original decay process 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V, the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous because the two lighter particles V can take on a range of energy values, allowing the energy of E particles to fill a continuous spectrum up to a maximum endpoint Q. When one exotic, massless particle M is emitted instead of the two V particles, this changes the conservation of energy dynamics. The massless particle M does not contribute mass, thus allowing the energy distribution of the E particles to still be continuous, but it may affect the maximum energy (the endpoint) due to the different energy dynamics. Since the massless particle does not carry mass, it could potentially allow for a higher energy distribution for the outgoing E particles. Therefore, the spectrum should remain continuous, and the endpoint could potentially increase due to the presence of the massless particle M, which does not consume energy in the same way as the massive particles V did. Thus, the correct choice is that the spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.\n\nAnswer:choice3', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
