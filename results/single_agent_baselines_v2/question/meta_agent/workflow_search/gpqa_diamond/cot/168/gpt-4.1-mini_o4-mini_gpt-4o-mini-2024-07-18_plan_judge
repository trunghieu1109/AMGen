Question: Example(question='You are studying a nuclear decay which converts two heavy nucleons of flavor A to another flavor B, while simultaneously emitting two much lighter particles E and V. In short, 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V. It is known that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous, with some endpoint value Q.\n\nA variant of this decay emits one exotic, massless particle M instead of the 2V. In this case, how does the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles compare to that of the original decay?', choice1='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint increases.', choice2='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases.', choice3='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.', choice4='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint decreases.', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The original double-beta decay (2A → 2B + 2E + 2V) is a four-body final state, so the summed electron energy is shared continuously up to the Q-value. Replacing the two (nearly massless) neutrinos V with a single massless exotic M gives a three-body final state (2 electrons + M). A three-body kinematic decay still produces a continuous spectrum for the summed electron energy, but with a different phase-space weighting (“harder” shape) and, since M is massless whereas neutrinos have a tiny mass, the maximum electron-sum energy endpoint is slightly larger (by the small neutrino-mass contribution) than before. Thus the spectrum remains continuous, its shape is adjusted, and the endpoint increases.
