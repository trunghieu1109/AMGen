Question: {'question': 'You are studying a nuclear decay which converts two heavy nucleons of flavor A to another flavor B, while simultaneously emitting two much lighter particles E and V.

Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent Kygp', content='In the original decay, 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V, the outgoing E particles have a continuous energy spectrum with an endpoint value Q because the neutrinos V can carry away varying amounts of energy and momentum. In the variant decay, 2A -> 2B + 2E + M, the massless particle M replaces the 2 neutrinos. Since M is massless, it can also carry away varying amounts of energy, similar to the neutrinos, so the spectrum of the E particles remains continuous. However, with fewer particles sharing the energy (since there is only 1 M instead of 2 V), the endpoint of the energy spectrum for the E particles will increase, as they can now take more energy compared to the original scenario. Therefore, the spectrum remains continuous, but the endpoint increases.\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
