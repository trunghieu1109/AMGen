Question: Example(question='Which of the following (effective) particles is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry?', choice1='Magnon', choice2='Skyrmion', choice3='Pion', choice4='Phonon', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: Magnons are Goldstone bosons from broken spin-rotation symmetry in magnets. Pions are (approximate) Goldstone bosons from broken chiral symmetry in QCD. Phonons are Goldstone bosons from broken continuous translational symmetry in crystals. Skyrmions, in contrast, are topological solitons rather than Goldstone modes of a spontaneously broken symmetry.

Answer:B)
Extracted answer: B)
Correct answer: 2
