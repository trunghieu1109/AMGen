Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent BWyY', content='Magnons are Goldstone bosons from broken spin-rotation symmetry in magnets. Pions are (approximate) Goldstone bosons from broken chiral symmetry in QCD. Phonons are Goldstone bosons from broken continuous translational symmetry in crystals. Skyrmions, in contrast, are topological solitons rather than Goldstone modes of a spontaneously broken symmetry.\n\nAnswer:B)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
