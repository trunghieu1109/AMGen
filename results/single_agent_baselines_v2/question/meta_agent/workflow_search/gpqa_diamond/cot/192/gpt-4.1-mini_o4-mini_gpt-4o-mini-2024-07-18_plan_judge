Question: Example(question='In a specific region of the sky, astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?', choice1='~ r^2', choice2='~ r^4', choice3='~ r^3', choice4='~ r^5', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: Given dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5 and plx ∝ 1/r, so plx = k/r ⇒ r ∝ 1/plx. Thus dN/d(plx) ∝ r^5. But we want dN/dr = (dN/d(plx))·|d(plx)/dr|. Since plx = k·r^(-1), d(plx)/dr ∝ r^(-2), so dN/dr ∝ r^5·r^(-2)=r^3.
