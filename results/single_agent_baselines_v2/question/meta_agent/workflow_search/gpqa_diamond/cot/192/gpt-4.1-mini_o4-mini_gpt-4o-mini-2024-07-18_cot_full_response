Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent kLLR', content='Given dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5 and plx ∝ 1/r, so plx = k/r ⇒ r ∝ 1/plx. Thus dN/d(plx) ∝ r^5. But we want dN/dr = (dN/d(plx))·|d(plx)/dr|. Since plx = k·r^(-1), d(plx)/dr ∝ r^(-2), so dN/dr ∝ r^5·r^(-2)=r^3.\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
