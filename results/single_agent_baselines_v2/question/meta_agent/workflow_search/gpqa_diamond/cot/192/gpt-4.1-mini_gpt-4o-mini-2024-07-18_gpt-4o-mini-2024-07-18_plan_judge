Question: Example(question='In a specific region of the sky, astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?', choice1='~ r^2', choice2='~ r^4', choice3='~ r^3', choice4='~ r^5', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. Parallax (plx) is inversely related to distance (d) as plx = 1/d. Therefore, we can rewrite the number of stars as being proportional to 1/(1/d)^5 = d^5. Since distance (d) is related to the range of distance (r), we can express the number of stars per unit range of distance as being proportional to r^5. Thus, the correct relationship is that the number of stars changes with distance as ~ r^5.
