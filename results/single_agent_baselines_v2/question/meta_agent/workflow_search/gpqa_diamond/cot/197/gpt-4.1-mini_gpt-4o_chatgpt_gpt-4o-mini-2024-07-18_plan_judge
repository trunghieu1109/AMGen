Question: Example(question='We have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate, where the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M and the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16. What will be the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species in the solution? ', choice1='16.9%', choice2='42.3%', choice3='25.6%', choice4='38.1%', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: To find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes, we need to consider the formation equilibria of cobalt(II) with thiocyanate. The relevant equilibria are: Co + SCN- ⇌ Co(SCN)+ with β1=9, Co + 2SCN- ⇌ Co(SCN)2 with β2=40, Co + 3SCN- ⇌ Co(SCN)3- with β3=63, and Co + 4SCN- ⇌ Co(SCN)42- with β4=16. The total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 0.01 M and [SCN-] = 0.1 M. We need to calculate the concentration of Co(SCN)2, which is [Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co] * [SCN-]^2. The total concentration of cobalt species is the sum of all cobalt species: [Co] + [Co(SCN)+] + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3-] + [Co(SCN)42-]. The percentage of Co(SCN)2 is then given by ([Co(SCN)2] / total cobalt concentration) * 100%. We calculate each species concentration using the stability constants and the given [SCN-], then find the percentage of Co(SCN)2.
