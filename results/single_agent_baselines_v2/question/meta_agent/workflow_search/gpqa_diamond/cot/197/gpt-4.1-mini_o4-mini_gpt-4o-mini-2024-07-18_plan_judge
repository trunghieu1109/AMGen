Question: Example(question='We have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate, where the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M and the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16. What will be the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species in the solution? ', choice1='16.9%', choice2='42.3%', choice3='25.6%', choice4='38.1%', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: We have Co2+ reacting with SCN- to form Co(SCN)n with cumulative stability constants β1–β4. The fraction of the dithiocyanato complex (n=2) is α2 = β2[SCN–]^2 / (1 + Σ βn[SCN–]^n). Substituting [SCN–] = 0.1 M gives: β1·0.1 = 0.9, β2·0.1^2 = 0.4, β3·0.1^3 = 0.063, β4·0.1^4 = 0.0016. Summing with 1 gives D = 2.3646. Then α2 = 0.4/2.3646 ≈ 0.169 (16.9%).
