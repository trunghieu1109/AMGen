Question: Example(question='We have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate, where the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M and the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16. What will be the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species in the solution? ', choice1='16.9%', choice2='42.3%', choice3='25.6%', choice4='38.1%', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: To find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species, we need to calculate the concentration of each cobalt complex formed in the solution based on the provided stability constants. The cobalt(II) can form several complexes with thiocyanate ions. The dithiocyanato complex corresponds to the second complex formation constant (β2). We will calculate the concentrations of all complexes and then find the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex relative to the total cobalt concentration.
