Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent ckaO', content='We have Co2+ reacting with SCN- to form Co(SCN)n with cumulative stability constants β1–β4. The fraction of the dithiocyanato complex (n=2) is α2 = β2[SCN–]^2 / (1 + Σ βn[SCN–]^n). Substituting [SCN–] = 0.1 M gives: β1·0.1 = 0.9, β2·0.1^2 = 0.4, β3·0.1^3 = 0.063, β4·0.1^4 = 0.0016. Summing with 1 gives D = 2.3646. Then α2 = 0.4/2.3646 ≈ 0.169 (16.9%).\n\nAnswer:A)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
