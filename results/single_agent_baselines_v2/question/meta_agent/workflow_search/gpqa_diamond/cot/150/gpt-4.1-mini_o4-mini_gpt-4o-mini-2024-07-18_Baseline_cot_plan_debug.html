    <pre>We have a 3×3 operator P with entries 0 on the diagonal and 1/√2 linking adjacent states: P = [[0,a,0],[a,0,a],[0,a,0]], a=1/√2. Its eigenvalues are found from det(P−λI) = −λ(λ^2−2a^2)=0 ⇒ λ=0,±1. The projector onto the zero‐eigenvalue subspace projects onto the normalized eigenvector (1,0,−1)/√2. The state |ψ⟩ = (−1,2,1) has norm^2 =6. Its overlap with the zero‐eigenvector is ⟨e0|ψ⟩ = (1/√2)(−1⋅1 +0⋅2 + (−1)⋅1) = −2/√2, so |⟨e0|ψ⟩|^2 =2. Thus the probability = 2/6 =1/3, corresponding to choice A).
