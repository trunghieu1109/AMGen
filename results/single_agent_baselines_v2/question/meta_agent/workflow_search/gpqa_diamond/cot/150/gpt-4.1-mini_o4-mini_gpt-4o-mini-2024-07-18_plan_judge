Question: Example(question='The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1). An observable of the system is represented by the matrix operator P having elements in the first row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0),  in the second row as (1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}) and in the third row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0). Calculate the probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 at time t.', choice1='1/3\n', choice2='2/3\n', choice3='\\sqrt{2/3}\n', choice4='1', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: We have a 3×3 operator P with entries 0 on the diagonal and 1/√2 linking adjacent states: P = [[0,a,0],[a,0,a],[0,a,0]], a=1/√2. Its eigenvalues are found from det(P−λI) = −λ(λ^2−2a^2)=0 ⇒ λ=0,±1. The projector onto the zero‐eigenvalue subspace projects onto the normalized eigenvector (1,0,−1)/√2. The state |ψ⟩ = (−1,2,1) has norm^2 =6. Its overlap with the zero‐eigenvector is ⟨e0|ψ⟩ = (1/√2)(−1⋅1 +0⋅2 + (−1)⋅1) = −2/√2, so |⟨e0|ψ⟩|^2 =2. Thus the probability = 2/6 =1/3, corresponding to choice A).
