proposed answer: The Mott-Gurney equation describes the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) in a semiconductor device. It is typically valid for a trap-free, single-carrier device where the current is limited by the space charge rather than by traps or other factors. An important condition for the validity of the Mott-Gurney equation is that there is no barrier to carrier injection, which implies that the contacts are Ohmic. Additionally, the equation assumes that the diffusion current is negligible compared to the drift current. Therefore, the correct statement about the validity of the Mott-Gurney equation is that it is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current, which corresponds to choice 1.
