Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent Vr9h', content='For φ=–π/4 the superposition becomes the odd cat state. The pure-state entropy term vanishes, so nG=–Tr[τ\u2009ln\u2009τ]=S(τ), the von\u2005Neumann entropy of the Gaussian state with the same covariance matrix. Numerically for α=0.5 this yields about 0.25.\n\nAnswer:D)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
