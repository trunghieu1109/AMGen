Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 755K', content='In a relativistic harmonic oscillator, the total energy is given by E = mc^2 (gamma - 1) + (1/2)kx^2, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. The maximum speed occurs at the equilibrium position where potential energy is zero. At maximum amplitude, all energy is potential, E = (1/2)kA^2. At equilibrium, all energy is kinetic, so (1/2)kA^2 = mc^2 (gamma - 1). Solving for gamma, we get gamma = 1 + (kA^2)/(2mc^2). The Lorentz factor gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2), so 1/sqrt(1 - v_max^2/c^2) = 1 + (kA^2)/(2mc^2). Solving for v_max, we get v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA^2)/(2mc^2))^2).\n\nAnswer:B)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
