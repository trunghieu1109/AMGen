Question: Example(question=" Consider a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass $m$ and maximum amplitude $A$ obeying Hook's law ($F=-kx$). What is the maximum speed  $v_max$ of the mass? The speed of light is $c$.", choice1='$v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})}}$', choice2='$v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$', choice3='$v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2m})^2}}$', choice4='$v_{max}=\\sqrt{\\frac{kA^2}{m}}$', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: To find the maximum speed of a relativistic harmonic oscillator, we need to consider the relativistic effects on the oscillator's motion. The force is given by Hook's law, and the maximum speed will occur when the oscillator is at its maximum amplitude. We need to analyze the options provided to determine which one correctly represents the maximum speed in a relativistic context.
