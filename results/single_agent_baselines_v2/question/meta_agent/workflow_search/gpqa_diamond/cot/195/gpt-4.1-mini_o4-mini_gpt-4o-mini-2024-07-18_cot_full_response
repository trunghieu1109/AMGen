Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 755K', content='The total energy at maximum amplitude A (where v=0) is E=m c^2+½kA^2. At x=0 the potential is zero, so all excess energy is kinetic: (γ−1)m c^2=½kA^2 ⇒ γ=1+ kA^2/(2m c^2). Then 1−v^2/c^2=1/γ^2=1/(1+kA^2/(2m c^2))^2. Thus v_max=c√[1−1/(1+kA^2/(2m c^2))^2], which matches choice 2.\n\nAnswer:B)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
