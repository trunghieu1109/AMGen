Question: Example(question='Consider an aperture, which shapes like a N-sided polygon. All the apothems are of the same length a. When a monochromatic light (of wavelength \\lambda), travelling along z-axis, falls vertically on this aperture, it creates a series of intensity maxima and minima in the far field region. What is the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large ? Assume that the related angles are small so that tan theta = theta approximation can be taken.', choice1='1.220 \\lambda /a ', choice2='0.610 \\lambda / a', choice3='0.500 \\lambda / a', choice4='0.506 \\lambda / a', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: As N→∞ the N-sided aperture becomes a circular aperture of radius a (the apothem equals the circle’s radius). The far-field diffraction pattern is the Airy pattern, with the first minimum at angle θ≈1.22λ/D where D is the aperture diameter. Here D=2a, so θ≈1.22λ/(2a)=0.610λ/a, corresponding to choice 2.
