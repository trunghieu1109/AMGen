Question: {'question': 'Consider an aperture, which shapes like a N-sided polygon. All the apothems are of the same length a. When a monochromatic light (of wavelength \\lambda), travelling along z-axis, falls vertically on this aperture, it creates a series of intensity maxima and minima in the far field region. What is the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large ?

Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent QXBy', content='As N→∞ the N-sided aperture becomes a circular aperture of radius a (the apothem equals the circle’s radius). The far-field diffraction pattern is the Airy pattern, with the first minimum at angle θ≈1.22λ/D where D is the aperture diameter. Here D=2a, so θ≈1.22λ/(2a)=0.610λ/a, corresponding to choice 2.\n\nAnswer:B)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
