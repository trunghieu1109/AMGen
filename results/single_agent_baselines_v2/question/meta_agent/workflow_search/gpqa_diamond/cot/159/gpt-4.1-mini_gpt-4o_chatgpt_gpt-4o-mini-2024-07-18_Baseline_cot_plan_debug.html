    <pre>When N is infinitely large, the N-sided polygon becomes a circle. The apothem of the polygon becomes the radius of the circle, which is a. For a circular aperture, the angular position of the first minimum in the far field diffraction pattern is given by the formula \( \theta = 1.22 \frac{\lambda}{D} \), where D is the diameter of the circle. Since the apothem a is the radius, the diameter D is 2a. Therefore, the angular position of the first minimum is \( \theta_1 = 1.22 \frac{\lambda}{2a} \). The second minimum for a circular aperture occurs at approximately \( \theta_2 = 2.23 \frac{\lambda}{D} = 2.23 \frac{\lambda}{2a} \). However, the problem asks for the angular distance between the first two minima, which is \( \theta_2 - \theta_1 \). For a circular aperture, the first two minima are not typically used to find the separation, as the first minimum is the primary point of interest. However, if the question refers to the first diffraction minimum, the usual interpretation is the first minimum from the central maximum, which is \( 1.22 \frac{\lambda}{2a} \). Therefore, the angular distance between the first two minima is simply the angular position of the first minimum, which is \( 1.22 \frac{\lambda}{2a} \). Since the question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima, and the typical interpretation in optics is to consider the first minimum from the central maximum, the answer is \( 1.22 \frac{\lambda}{a} \) because the effective diameter is considered as the diameter, not the apothem. Thus, the correct choice is the one that matches this interpretation.
