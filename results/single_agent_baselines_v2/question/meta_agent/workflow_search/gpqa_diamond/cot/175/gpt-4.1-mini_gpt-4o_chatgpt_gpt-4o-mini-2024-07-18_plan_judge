Question: Example(question='The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1), and the operators of two observables P and Q of the system are represented by two square matrices. The matrix corresponding to operator P has the elements in first row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0), elements in the second row as (1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}) and that in third row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0). The matrix operator for Q is represented by the square matrix having elements in the first row as (1, 0, 0), second row as (0, 0, 0) and third row as (0, 0, -1). Now, if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P, what is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements?', choice1='1/2', choice2='1/6', choice3='1/3', choice4='2/3', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: To find the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q, we first need to find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the operator matrices for P and Q. We then determine the probability of the initial state collapsing to the eigenstate corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 for P, and subsequently to the eigenstate corresponding to the eigenvalue -1 for Q. First, we calculate the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of P. The operator P is represented by the matrix: 
P = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1/\sqrt{2} & 0 \\ 1/\sqrt{2} & 0 & 1/\sqrt{2} \\ 0 & 1/\sqrt{2} & 0 \end{pmatrix}
We solve for the eigenvalues by finding the determinant of (P - \lambda I) = 0. Solving this, we find the eigenvalues are \lambda_1 = \sqrt{2}, \lambda_2 = 0, and \lambda_3 = -\sqrt{2}. The corresponding eigenvectors are v_1, v_2, and v_3. We are interested in the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue 0, which is v_2 = (1/2, 1/\sqrt{2}, 1/2). Next, we project the initial state vector |\psi> = (-1, 2, 1) onto v_2 to find the probability of measuring 0 for P. The probability is given by |<v_2|\psi>|^2. Calculating this, we find the probability is 1/3. After measuring P and collapsing the state to v_2, we measure Q. The operator Q is represented by the matrix:
Q = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix}
The eigenvalues of Q are 1, 0, and -1, with corresponding eigenvectors (1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), and (0, 0, 1). We are interested in the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue -1, which is (0, 0, 1). Projecting the state v_2 onto this eigenvector, we find the probability of measuring -1 for Q is 1/2. The total probability of measuring 0 for P and then -1 for Q is (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.
