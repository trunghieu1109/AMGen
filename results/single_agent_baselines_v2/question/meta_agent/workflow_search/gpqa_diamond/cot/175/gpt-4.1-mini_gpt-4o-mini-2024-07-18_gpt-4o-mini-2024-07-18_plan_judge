Question: Example(question='The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1), and the operators of two observables P and Q of the system are represented by two square matrices. The matrix corresponding to operator P has the elements in first row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0), elements in the second row as (1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}) and that in third row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0). The matrix operator for Q is represented by the square matrix having elements in the first row as (1, 0, 0), second row as (0, 0, 0) and third row as (0, 0, -1). Now, if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P, what is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements?', choice1='1/2', choice2='1/6', choice3='1/3', choice4='2/3', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: To find the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements, we need to analyze the eigenvalues and eigenstates of the operators P and Q. First, we will determine the eigenvalues and eigenstates of operator P. Then, we will use the resulting state after measuring P to find the probability of measuring -1 for Q. The matrix for P is given, and we can find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. After that, we will measure Q and find the probabilities based on the state after measuring P.
