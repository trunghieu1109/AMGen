Question: Example(question='The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1), and the operators of two observables P and Q of the system are represented by two square matrices. The matrix corresponding to operator P has the elements in first row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0), elements in the second row as (1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}) and that in third row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0). The matrix operator for Q is represented by the square matrix having elements in the first row as (1, 0, 0), second row as (0, 0, 0) and third row as (0, 0, -1). Now, if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P, what is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements?', choice1='1/2', choice2='1/6', choice3='1/3', choice4='2/3', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: First, normalize the initial state ψ = (−1,2,1)^T: |ψ⟩ = (−1,2,1)/√6. Operator P has eigenvalues ±1,0; the zero‐eigenvector is v₀ = (1,0,−1)/√2. 

Probability of measuring P=0 is |⟨v₀|ψ⟩|² = |[1,0,−1]/√2 · (−1,2,1)/√6|² = |(−1−1)/√12|² = (2/√12)² = 1/3. 

After obtaining P=0, the post‐measurement state is |v₀⟩. Measuring Q with eigenstates e₁=(1,0,0),e₂=(0,1,0),e₃=(0,0,1), the probability of Q=−1 is |⟨e₃|v₀⟩|² = |(0,0,1)·(1,0,−1)/√2|² = (1/√2)² = 1/2.

The joint probability = (1/3)·(1/2) = 1/6, which is choice 2 = B).
