Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent fBw6', content='The epoxidation of an alkene is stereospecific (syn addition) and preserves the relative cis/trans relationship of the substituents. Oct-4-ene gives a 2,3-epoxide: each epoxide carbon is attached to the other carbon, the oxygen, a propyl chain, and a hydrogen. Because both epoxide centers have identical substituents (O, carbon of the ring, propyl chain, H), the cis‐epoxide is a meso form (achiral) and the trans‐epoxide exists as an enantiomeric pair (racemate). \n\nReaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → trans-epoxide only → racemic mixture (2 enantiomers)\nReaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → cis-epoxide only → meso (1 achiral diastereomer)\n\nCombined mixture: 1 meso + 2 enantiomers = 3 stereoisomers.\n\nOn a standard (achiral) HPLC, enantiomers coelute, but diastereomers separate → 2 peaks (meso vs racemic pair). On a chiral HPLC, the meso remains single, but the racemate splits into its two enantiomers → 3 peaks.\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
