Question: Example(question='A chemist performs two reactions:\n\nReaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. \n\nReaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.\n\nBoth reactions go to 100% completion. The chemist combines the products of both reactions, and then runs the product mixture on both a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column and a chiral HPLC column.\n\nAssuming that the chromatographic resolution is as high as theoretically possible in both cases, what does the chemist observe in each of these chromatograms?', choice1='4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', choice2='3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice3='2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice4='2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: The epoxidation of an alkene is stereospecific (syn addition) and preserves the relative cis/trans relationship of the substituents. Oct-4-ene gives a 2,3-epoxide: each epoxide carbon is attached to the other carbon, the oxygen, a propyl chain, and a hydrogen. Because both epoxide centers have identical substituents (O, carbon of the ring, propyl chain, H), the cis‐epoxide is a meso form (achiral) and the trans‐epoxide exists as an enantiomeric pair (racemate). 

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → trans-epoxide only → racemic mixture (2 enantiomers)
Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → cis-epoxide only → meso (1 achiral diastereomer)

Combined mixture: 1 meso + 2 enantiomers = 3 stereoisomers.

On a standard (achiral) HPLC, enantiomers coelute, but diastereomers separate → 2 peaks (meso vs racemic pair). On a chiral HPLC, the meso remains single, but the racemate splits into its two enantiomers → 3 peaks.
