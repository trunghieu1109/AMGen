Question: Example(question='A chemist performs two reactions:\n\nReaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. \n\nReaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.\n\nBoth reactions go to 100% completion. The chemist combines the products of both reactions, and then runs the product mixture on both a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column and a chiral HPLC column.\n\nAssuming that the chromatographic resolution is as high as theoretically possible in both cases, what does the chemist observe in each of these chromatograms?', choice1='4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', choice2='3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice3='2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice4='2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: First, let's analyze the reactions. Reaction 1 involves (E)-oct-4-ene being converted to an epoxide using mCPBA, followed by ring opening with aqueous acid. The (E)-alkene will form a trans-epoxide, which upon ring opening, gives a trans-diol. Reaction 2 involves (Z)-oct-4-ene, which forms a cis-epoxide, and upon ring opening, gives a cis-diol. These diols are stereoisomers: the trans and cis diols are distinct compounds. On a standard achiral HPLC column, which separates based on polarity, the two diols (trans and cis) will appear as two separate peaks because they have different polarities. On a chiral HPLC column, which can separate enantiomers, the trans diol will be separated into two peaks (one for each enantiomer), and the cis diol will also be separated into two peaks (one for each enantiomer). Therefore, on a chiral column, we will see four peaks corresponding to the two enantiomers of the trans diol and the two enantiomers of the cis diol.

Answer:3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC
Extracted answer: 3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC
Correct answer: 3
