Question: Example(question='A chemist performs two reactions:\n\nReaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. \n\nReaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.\n\nBoth reactions go to 100% completion. The chemist combines the products of both reactions, and then runs the product mixture on both a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column and a chiral HPLC column.\n\nAssuming that the chromatographic resolution is as high as theoretically possible in both cases, what does the chemist observe in each of these chromatograms?', choice1='4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', choice2='3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice3='2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice4='2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: In Reaction 1, (E)-oct-4-ene reacts with mCPBA to form an epoxide, which upon acid treatment gives rise to a diol. In Reaction 2, (Z)-oct-4-ene reacts similarly to form a different diol due to the stereochemistry of the starting material. The (E) and (Z) forms will each produce distinct diols, leading to two different products from each reaction. Since the reactions go to completion, we have two unique diols from (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene, which means we will have a total of four products: two from each reaction. In a standard HPLC, which does not differentiate between enantiomers, we will see two peaks corresponding to the two different diols. However, in a chiral HPLC, we will see four peaks because the chiral column can differentiate between the enantiomers of the diols. Therefore, the chemist would observe 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC.
