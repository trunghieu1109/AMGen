Question: Example(question='What is the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product obtained when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess of HI?', choice1='1', choice2='3', choice3='0', choice4='5', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) is calculated based on the structure of the compound. The given compound is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. When this compound is reacted with red phosphorus and excess HI, it undergoes a reduction reaction. The formyl group (-CHO) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH3), and the vinyl group (CH=CH2) is also reduced to an ethyl group (-CH2-CH3). The double bond in the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a single bond. After the reduction, the structure should be that of a fully saturated cyclohexane with additional alkyl groups. A fully saturated cyclohexane has an IHD of 0. No double bonds or rings remain after the reduction. Therefore, the IHD of the product is 0.
