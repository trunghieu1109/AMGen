Question: Example(question='What is the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product obtained when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess of HI?', choice1='1', choice2='3', choice3='0', choice4='5', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: First, identify each functional group’s transformation under reductive HI/P:
- Aldehyde (–CHO) is reduced to –CH2
- Carboxylic acid (–COOH) is reduced to –CH2 (i.e. to a methyl substituent on the ring)

The original ring has:
- One ring → 1 degree of unsaturation
- One internal C=C (cyclohex‐3‐ene) → 1
- One aldehyde → 1 (but this is removed by reduction)
- One carboxyl → 1 (also removed by reduction)
- One vinyl substituent (–CH=CH2) → 1

After reduction only the ring and both C=C bonds remain unsaturated:
1 (ring) + 1 (ring C=C) + 1 (vinyl C=C) = 3

Answer:B)
Extracted answer: B)
Correct answer: 1
