Question: Example(question='Consider a system with Hamiltonian operator $H = \\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n}$. Here, $\\vec{n}$ is an arbitrary unit vector, $\\varepsilon $ is a constant of dimension energy, and components of $\\vec{\\sigma}$ are the Pauli spin matrices. What are the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator?\n', choice1='+ \\varepsilon, -\\varepsilon\n', choice2='+\\varepsilon \\hbar/2, - \\varepsilon \\hbar/2', choice3='+1, -1', choice4='+\\hbar/2, -\\hbar/2', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The Hamiltonian operator given is of the form H = ε σ·n, where σ is the vector of Pauli matrices and n is a unit vector. The eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian that is a linear combination of Pauli matrices can be determined from the structure of the operator. The eigenvalues are known to be ±ε, as the eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices are ±1, and scaling by ε gives the final eigenvalues.
