Question: Example(question='Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are\nconstrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system\ncorrect to three decimals?', choice1='2.822 x 10^-26', choice2='5.645 x 10^-26', choice3='7.056 x 10^-27', choice4='122.330', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: To find the minimum energy of the system, we need to calculate the potential energy between the 12 charges constrained at a distance of 2 m from point P and the fixed charge at P. The potential energy U between two point charges is given by the formula U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant (approximately 8.99 x 10^9 N m²/C²), q1 and q2 are the charges, and r is the distance between them. Here, each charge has a charge of 2e, where e is the elementary charge (approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 C). Therefore, 2e = 3.204 x 10^-19 C. For 12 charges, we will need to calculate the pairwise interaction energies and sum them up. The total energy will be the sum of the potential energies of all unique pairs formed by the 12 charges. Since they are all at the same distance from the fixed charge, we will also include their interaction with the fixed charge at point P. After performing the calculations, we will find the minimum energy of the system and compare it to the provided choices.
