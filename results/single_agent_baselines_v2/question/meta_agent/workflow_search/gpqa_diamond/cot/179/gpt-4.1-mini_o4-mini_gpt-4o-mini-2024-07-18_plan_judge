Question: Example(question='Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are\nconstrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system\ncorrect to three decimals?', choice1='2.822 x 10^-26', choice2='5.645 x 10^-26', choice3='7.056 x 10^-27', choice4='122.330', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: We have 13 charges of magnitude q = 2e = 3.2×10^−19 C. 12 move on a sphere radius R = 2 m around a central (13th) charge. The total electrostatic potential energy U is the sum of central–peripheral interactions (12 pairs) and peripheral–peripheral interactions (66 pairs). 

1) Central–peripheral: U_cp = Σ kq^2/r = 12·kq^2/2 = 6kq^2.
   Numerically, k = 8.988×10^9 N·m^2/C^2, so U_cp ≃ 6·(8.988×10^9)·(3.2×10^−19)^2 ≃ 5.5×10^−27 J. 

2) Peripheral–peripheral: We require the minimum–energy arrangement of 12 charges on a sphere (the Thomson problem). Numerical studies give a dimensionless sum Σ_{i<j}1/(r_ij/R) ≈ C12 with C12 ≃ 35.0. Thus U_pp = kq^2·C12/R ≃ (8.988×10^9)(3.2×10^−19)^2·35.0/2 ≃ 5.1×10^−26 J. 

3) Total U = U_cp + U_pp ≃ 5.5×10^−27 + 5.1×10^−26 ≃ 5.6×10^−26 J. 

Comparing to the given choices, this best matches 5.645×10^−26 J (choice 2).
