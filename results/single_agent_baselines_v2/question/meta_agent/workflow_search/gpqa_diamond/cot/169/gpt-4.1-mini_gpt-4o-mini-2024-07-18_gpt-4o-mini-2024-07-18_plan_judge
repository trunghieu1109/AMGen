Question: Example(question='An electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Find the expectation value of its spin along y-direction, S_y.\nNote: \\sigma_y (in latex format) is: \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & -i \\\\\ni & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}', choice1='-25*hbar/2\n\n', choice2='-12*hbar/25\n\n', choice3='12*hbar/25', choice4='25*hbar/2\n', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: To find the expectation value of spin along the y-direction, S_y, we need to use the given spin state (3i, 4) and the matrix representation of the sigma_y operator. We will first normalize the state vector, then apply the sigma_y matrix to find the resulting state, and finally compute the expectation value.

Answer:The expectation value of S_y for the given spin state is -12*hbar/25.
Extracted answer: The expectation value of S_y for the given spin state is -12*hbar/25.
Correct answer: 2
