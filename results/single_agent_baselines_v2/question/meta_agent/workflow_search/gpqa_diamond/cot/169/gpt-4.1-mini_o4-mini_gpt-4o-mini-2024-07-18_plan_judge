Question: Example(question='An electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Find the expectation value of its spin along y-direction, S_y.\nNote: \\sigma_y (in latex format) is: \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & -i \\\\\ni & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}', choice1='-25*hbar/2\n\n', choice2='-12*hbar/25\n\n', choice3='12*hbar/25', choice4='25*hbar/2\n', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: We have spinor psi = (3i,4). Normalize: norm^2 = |3i|^2+|4|^2 =9+16=25 so psi_norm = (3i/5,4/5). S_y expectation = (ħ/2) ⟨psi|σ_y|psi⟩. σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]]. Compute σ_y psi = [-i*(4/5), i*(3i/5)] = [-4i/5,3i^2/5] = [-4i/5,-3/5]. Then ⟨psi|σ_y|psi⟩ = (conj(3i/5),4/5)·(-4i/5,-3/5) = (-3i/5)(-4i/5)+(4/5)(-3/5) = (-12/25)+(-12/25) = -24/25. Thus ⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2)(-24/25) = -12ħ/25, which is choice B).
