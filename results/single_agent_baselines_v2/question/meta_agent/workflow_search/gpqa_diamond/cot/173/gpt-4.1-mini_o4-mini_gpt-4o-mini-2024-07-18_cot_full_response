Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent MGzN', content='We have a nucleus of rest energy M c^2=300 GeV at rest splitting into two fragments of rest masses m1=2m and m2=m with m1+m2=0.99M, so m=99 GeV, m1=198 GeV, m2=99 GeV, and total KE = (M−(m1+m2))c^2=3 GeV. Relativistically, by momentum conservation\n√(p²+m1²)+√(p²+m2²)=300 GeV\n⇒E2=√(p²+m2²)=100.995 GeV, E1=199.005 GeV\n⇒T1_rel=E1−m1=1.005 GeV=1005 MeV\nClassically, KE partitions as K·m2/(m1+m2)=3 GeV·(99/297)=1.000 GeV=1000 MeV\nDifference=5 MeV.\n\nAnswer:B)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
