Question: Example(question='An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV.

proposed answer: We start by noting that the initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus is 300 GeV. After the fission, the sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass, so the rest-mass energy of the fragments is 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV. The energy released in the fission (which is converted to kinetic energy) is therefore 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV.

Let the rest mass of the smaller fragment be m, then the rest mass of the larger fragment is 2m. The total rest mass of the fragments is m + 2m = 3m. Since this is 99% of the initial mass M, we have 3m = 0.99M, so m = 0.33M.

In the center of mass frame, the two fragments have equal and opposite momenta. Let p be the magnitude of the momentum of the smaller fragment. Then, the momentum of the larger fragment is also p, but in the opposite direction.

Using the relativistic energy-momentum relation for the larger fragment:
E1^2 = (2m)^2c^4 + p^2c^2.

The total energy E1 of the larger fragment is its rest-mass energy plus its kinetic energy:
E1 = 2mc^2 + T1.

Since the fragments share the total energy of 300 GeV, and the rest-mass energy of the larger fragment is 2mc^2 = 0.66M = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV, we have:
E1 = 198 GeV + T1 = (2m)^2c^4 + p^2c^2.

For the classical approximation, the kinetic energy T1(classical) is given by:
T1(classical) = (1/2) * (2m) * v^2,
where v is the velocity of the larger fragment. The classical kinetic energy is calculated without considering relativistic effects.

The difference between the correct T1 value (relativistic) and the classical approximation T1(classical) is given as one of the choices.

The energy released as kinetic energy is 3 GeV, and we have to distribute it between the two fragments. Since the larger fragment has more mass, it will have less velocity and less kinetic energy compared to the smaller fragment.

The correct T1 value will be slightly less than the classical approximation due to relativistic effects.

The correct choice considering typical relativistic corrections is 10 MeV.
