Question: Example(question='An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. A spontaneous fission occurs in which it splits into two fragments (and nothing else), such that one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other (in terms of their rest-masses). The sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. \n\nKinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?\n\n(Ignore the electrons.)', choice1='10 MeV.', choice2='5 MeV.', choice3='2 MeV.', choice4='20 MeV.', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: We have a nucleus of rest energy M c^2=300 GeV at rest splitting into two fragments of rest masses m1=2m and m2=m with m1+m2=0.99M, so m=99 GeV, m1=198 GeV, m2=99 GeV, and total KE = (M−(m1+m2))c^2=3 GeV. Relativistically, by momentum conservation
√(p²+m1²)+√(p²+m2²)=300 GeV
⇒E2=√(p²+m2²)=100.995 GeV, E1=199.005 GeV
⇒T1_rel=E1−m1=1.005 GeV=1005 MeV
Classically, KE partitions as K·m2/(m1+m2)=3 GeV·(99/297)=1.000 GeV=1000 MeV
Difference=5 MeV.
