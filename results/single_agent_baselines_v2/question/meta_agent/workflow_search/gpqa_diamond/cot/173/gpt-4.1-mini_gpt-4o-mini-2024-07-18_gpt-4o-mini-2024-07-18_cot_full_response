Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent MGzN', content='To solve the problem, we first need to understand the situation of the fission process. We have a nucleus with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV, which splits into two fragments. Let the rest masses of the two fragments be m1 and m2, where m2 = 2m1. According to the problem, the sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of M, so we have: m1 + m2 = 0.99M. Substituting m2, we get: m1 + 2m1 = 0.99M, which simplifies to 3m1 = 0.99M, giving m1 = 0.33M and m2 = 0.66M. We can then calculate the kinetic energy of the fragments using conservation of momentum and energy. The more massive fragment (m2) will have a certain kinetic energy T1. In the classical approximation, we would calculate the kinetic energy differently, leading to a discrepancy between the two methods. After performing the calculations, we find the difference between the relativistic and classical kinetic energy values to be 5 MeV.\n\nAnswer:5 MeV.', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
