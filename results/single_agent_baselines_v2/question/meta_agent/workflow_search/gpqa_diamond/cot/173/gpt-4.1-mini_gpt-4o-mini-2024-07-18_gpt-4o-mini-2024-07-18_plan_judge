Question: Example(question='An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. A spontaneous fission occurs in which it splits into two fragments (and nothing else), such that one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other (in terms of their rest-masses). The sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. \n\nKinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?\n\n(Ignore the electrons.)', choice1='10 MeV.', choice2='5 MeV.', choice3='2 MeV.', choice4='20 MeV.', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: To solve the problem, we first need to understand the situation of the fission process. We have a nucleus with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV, which splits into two fragments. Let the rest masses of the two fragments be m1 and m2, where m2 = 2m1. According to the problem, the sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of M, so we have: m1 + m2 = 0.99M. Substituting m2, we get: m1 + 2m1 = 0.99M, which simplifies to 3m1 = 0.99M, giving m1 = 0.33M and m2 = 0.66M. We can then calculate the kinetic energy of the fragments using conservation of momentum and energy. The more massive fragment (m2) will have a certain kinetic energy T1. In the classical approximation, we would calculate the kinetic energy differently, leading to a discrepancy between the two methods. After performing the calculations, we find the difference between the relativistic and classical kinetic energy values to be 5 MeV.
