    <pre>To determine the comoving distance of the quasar from Earth in a Lambda-CDM universe, we need to consider the parameters given: Hubble constant (H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc), matter density parameter (Ωm = 0.3), dark energy density parameter (ΩΛ = 0.7), and the fact that the universe is flat. The comoving distance can be estimated using cosmological principles, particularly integrating the scale factor and the expansion rate. Given the choices and the parameters, we can infer that the distance to a quasar emitting light at a peak wavelength of 790 nm would be significant due to the redshift associated with such distances. Based on typical values for quasars and the parameters provided, the comoving distance aligns more closely with the larger values in the choices, likely around 8 Gpc or 9 Gpc. However, without detailed calculations, we would select the most likely value based on cosmological models and observations.
