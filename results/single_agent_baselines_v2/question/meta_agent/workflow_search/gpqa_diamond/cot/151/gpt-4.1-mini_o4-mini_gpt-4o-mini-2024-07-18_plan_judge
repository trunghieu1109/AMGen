Question: Example(question='You identified a new quorum-sensing peptide in the bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus. You are highly interested if its role in intercellular communication is conserved among the eukaryotes. You treat yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with the peptide and interestingly observe the formation of the shmoo. You want to learn about the proteome of the active chromatin in the shmoo and recover it by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. The least of proteins from which complex below will you observe in your assay?', choice1='pre-initiation complex', choice2='pre-replication complex', choice3='enhancer protein complex', choice4='nucleosome histone complex', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: We are immunoprecipitating active chromatin (euchromatin) from pheromone‐arrested (shmoo) yeast to identify proteins associated with transcriptionally active regions. Active chromatin will contain histones (with active marks), transcription initiation machinery (pre‐initiation complex), and enhancer‐associated factors. The pre‐replication complex (ORC, Cdc6, Cdt1, MCM) is involved in DNA replication origin licensing, not transcription of active chromatin, and would thus be least represented in this IP.
