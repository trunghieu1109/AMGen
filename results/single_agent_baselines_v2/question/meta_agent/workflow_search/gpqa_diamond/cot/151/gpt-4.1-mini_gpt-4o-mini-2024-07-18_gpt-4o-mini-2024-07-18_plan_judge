Question: Example(question='You identified a new quorum-sensing peptide in the bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus. You are highly interested if its role in intercellular communication is conserved among the eukaryotes. You treat yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with the peptide and interestingly observe the formation of the shmoo. You want to learn about the proteome of the active chromatin in the shmoo and recover it by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. The least of proteins from which complex below will you observe in your assay?', choice1='pre-initiation complex', choice2='pre-replication complex', choice3='enhancer protein complex', choice4='nucleosome histone complex', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: In the context of studying the proteome of active chromatin in the shmoo of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the pre-initiation complex is involved in the transcription initiation process, which is likely to be present. The pre-replication complex is involved in DNA replication, which is not directly related to the shmoo formation. The enhancer protein complex is involved in enhancing transcription but may not be directly associated with the shmoo phenotype. The nucleosome histone complex is fundamental to chromatin structure and is expected to be present. Among these, the pre-replication complex is least likely to be observed in this assay focused on active chromatin and transcription-related processes.
