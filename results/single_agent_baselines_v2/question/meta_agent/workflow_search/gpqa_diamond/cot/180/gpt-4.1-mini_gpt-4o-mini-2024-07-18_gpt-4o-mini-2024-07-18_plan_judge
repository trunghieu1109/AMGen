Question: Example(question='Very large number of neutrinos produced by the Sun reach the Earth (very large flux of neutrinos, defined as the number of neutrinos per cm^2, per second).\n\nLet us assume that, hypothetically, the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the core of the Sun about 8 and a half minutes ago, while all other reactions remained as they were.\n\nWhat would be the approximate ratio of the flux between two bands of neutrino energies of 700-800 KeV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). \n\nFlux (band 1) / flux (band 2) is:\n\n(Note: we are talking about stopping the pp-III branch, not pp-II, pp-I or any other. Itâ€™s not a typo or something like that.)\n(Note 2: solar neutrino flavor changes happen, but do not play a role here.)', choice1='0.1 (10^-1).', choice2='10.', choice3='1.', choice4='0.01 (10^-2).', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The pp-III branch produces neutrinos primarily in the energy range of 700-800 KeV. If we stop this branch, the flux of neutrinos in the energy band 700-800 KeV (band 1) will decrease significantly compared to the flux in the 800-900 keV range (band 2), which is primarily produced by the pp-II and pp-I branches. Since the pp-III branch contributes most to the 700-800 keV band, we can expect the flux in band 1 to be much lower relative to band 2. Therefore, the ratio of the flux between these two bands will be much less than 1. Given the choices, 0.1 (10^-1) seems to be a reasonable estimate for the ratio of flux (band 1) / flux (band 2).
