Question: Example(question='Very large number of neutrinos produced by the Sun reach the Earth (very large flux of neutrinos, defined as the number of neutrinos per cm^2, per second).\n\nLet us assume that, hypothetically, the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the core of the Sun about 8 and a half minutes ago, while all other reactions remained as they were.\n\nWhat would be the approximate ratio of the flux between two bands of neutrino energies of 700-800 KeV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). \n\nFlux (band 1) / flux (band 2) is:\n\n(Note: we are talking about stopping the pp-III branch, not pp-II, pp-I or any other. Itâ€™s not a typo or something like that.)\n(Note 2: solar neutrino flavor changes happen, but do not play a role here.)', choice1='0.1 (10^-1).', choice2='10.', choice3='1.', choice4='0.01 (10^-2).', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The pp-III branch of the proton-proton chain in the Sun produces high-energy neutrinos, particularly those from the decay of Beryllium-7 and Boron-8. The neutrinos from the pp-III branch, especially from Boron-8 decay, are higher in energy compared to those from the pp-I and pp-II branches. If the pp-III branch suddenly stopped, the high-energy neutrino flux would significantly decrease. The energy range of 700-800 keV (band 1) is more consistent with neutrinos from reactions in the pp-I or pp-II branches, while 800-900 keV (band 2) is more likely to have contributions from the pp-III branch. Therefore, if the pp-III branch stopped, the flux in band 2 would decrease more compared to band 1, leading to a smaller ratio of flux in band 1 to band 2.
