Question: Example(question='Imagine an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ having a small spherical cavity inside. The centre of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the centre of the spherical conductor. The radius of the cavity is $r$, and $r<R$. Now consider a small amount of positive charge $+q$ is somehow placed somewhere inside the cavity. What is the magnitude of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at a point P (outside the spherical conductor) of distance $L$ from the centre of the spherical conductor? Note, the distance of the point P from the centre of the cavity is $l$. Here, l, L > R.

proposed answer: In this scenario, we have a charged cavity inside an uncharged spherical conductor. According to Gauss's law, the electric field outside a spherical conductor only depends on the total charge enclosed within the Gaussian surface. Since the spherical conductor is uncharged and the positive charge +q is placed inside the cavity, the charge on the conductor will redistribute to maintain electrostatic equilibrium, resulting in a surface charge on the inner surface of the conductor equal to -q, and a corresponding positive charge +q on the outer surface. Therefore, the electric field outside the conductor behaves as if there is a point charge +q located at the center of the spherical conductor. The distance from the center of the conductor to point P is L, which is greater than R. Thus, the electric field at point P can be calculated using the formula for the electric field due to a point charge, which is E = k * q / r^2, where r is the distance from the charge to the point where the field is being calculated. In this case, the distance is L, so the electric field is given by E = (1 / (4πε₀)) * (q / L^2). Hence, the correct choice is the one that corresponds to this formula.
