Question: Example(question='We would like to dissolve (at 25°С) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm3 total volume. What is the minimum volume (cm3) of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution and what is the pH of the resulting solution?', choice1='pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3', choice2='pH 2.69; 30.09 cm3', choice3='pH 3.16; 32.14 cm3', choice4='pH 4.94; 20.40 cm3', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: To dissolve Fe(OH)3, we need to consider its solubility product (Ksp) and the reaction with the strong acid. The dissolution reaction is: Fe(OH)3(s) + 3H+(aq) -> Fe3+(aq) + 3H2O(l). The Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is very low, so it requires an acidic environment to dissolve. Calculate moles of Fe(OH)3: (0.1 g) / (106.87 g/mol) = 0.000936 mol. For complete dissolution, 3 times this amount of H+ is needed: 0.000936 mol * 3 = 0.002808 mol. Use 0.1 M acid: 0.002808 mol / 0.1 M = 0.02808 L = 28.08 cm3. The total volume is 100 cm3, so the concentration of H+ is (0.002808 mol) / (0.1 L) = 0.02808 M. pH = -log(0.02808) = 1.55. However, the closest choice is pH 2.04 with volume 28.05 cm3, suggesting slight approximation adjustments.
