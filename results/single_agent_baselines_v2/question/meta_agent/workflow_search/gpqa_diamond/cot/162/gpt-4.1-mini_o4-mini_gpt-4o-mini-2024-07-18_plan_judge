Question: Example(question='We would like to dissolve (at 25°С) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm3 total volume. What is the minimum volume (cm3) of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution and what is the pH of the resulting solution?', choice1='pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3', choice2='pH 2.69; 30.09 cm3', choice3='pH 3.16; 32.14 cm3', choice4='pH 4.94; 20.40 cm3', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: First calculate moles of Fe(OH)3: M≈55.85+3×(16+1)=106.85 g/mol so n≈0.1 g/106.85 g/mol=9.36×10⁻⁴ mol. To dissolve, need 3 H+ per mole: n₀=3n=2.81×10⁻³ mol. After dissolution a small excess [H+] remains to set the solution pH. For trial pH=2.69, [H+]=10⁻²․⁶⁹=2.04×10⁻³ M so excess moles=2.04×10⁻³ M×0.100 L=2.04×10⁻⁴ mol. Total H+ moles=2.81×10⁻³+2.04×10⁻⁴=3.009×10⁻³ mol. At 0.1 M acid that is V=3.009×10⁻³ mol/0.1 M=3.009×10⁻² L=30.09 mL. This matches choice 2.
