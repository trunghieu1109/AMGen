Question: Example(question='We would like to dissolve (at 25°С) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm3 total volume. What is the minimum volume (cm3) of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution and what is the pH of the resulting solution?', choice1='pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3', choice2='pH 2.69; 30.09 cm3', choice3='pH 3.16; 32.14 cm3', choice4='pH 4.94; 20.40 cm3', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: To dissolve Fe(OH)3, we need to determine how much acid is required to neutralize the hydroxide ions produced by the Fe(OH)3. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is approximately 106.87 g/mol. Therefore, 0.1 g of Fe(OH)3 corresponds to about 0.000935 moles. Each mole of Fe(OH)3 produces 3 moles of OH- ions. Thus, we have 0.000935 moles of Fe(OH)3 producing 0.002805 moles of OH-. To neutralize these OH- ions, we need an equivalent amount of H+ ions from the strong acid. The required moles of H+ ions equals the moles of OH- ions, which is 0.002805 moles. Since we are using a 0.1 M strong acid, the volume of acid needed can be calculated using the formula: volume = moles / concentration. This gives us a volume of 28.05 cm3. Now, to find the pH of the solution, we consider the total volume after adding the acid, which will be 100 cm3 + 28.05 cm3 = 128.05 cm3. The concentration of H+ ions will be 0.002805 moles / 0.12805 L = 0.0219 M. The pH is then calculated as -log(0.0219), which gives approximately 1.66. However, we need to check the choices provided to find the closest match.

Answer:pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3
Extracted answer: pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3
Correct answer: 2
