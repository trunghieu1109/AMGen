Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent eeAI', content='The molecular ion at m/z 156 with an M+2 peak (~32%) indicates one chlorine. IR shows a broad 3500–2700 cm⁻¹ band (carboxylic O–H) and a sharp 1720 cm⁻¹ band (C=O). 1H NMR has a 11.0\u2009ppm singlet (COOH) and two aromatic doublets (2H each) indicating a para-disubstituted benzene. 4-Chlorobenzoic acid fits the formula C7H5ClO2 (MW 156) and gives the observed NMR splitting pattern.\n\nAnswer:A)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
