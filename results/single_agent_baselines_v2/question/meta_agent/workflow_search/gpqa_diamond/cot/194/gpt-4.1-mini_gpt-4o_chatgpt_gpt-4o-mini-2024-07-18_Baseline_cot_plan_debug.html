    <pre>To determine the maximum orbital period of the second planet that will exhibit both transit and occultation events, we need to ensure that the second planet&#39;s orbit allows it to pass in front of and behind the star from our line of sight. The first planet has a transit impact parameter of 0.2, which means its orbit is near edge-on. The second planet must have a similar alignment to ensure transits and occultations. The impact parameter b is defined as b = a * cos(i) / R_star, where a is the semi-major axis, i is the inclination, and R_star is the star&#39;s radius. Since both planets share the same orbital plane, they have the same inclination. The maximum impact parameter for transits is 1, and for occultations, it is slightly less than 1. We can use Kepler&#39;s third law to relate the semi-major axis a to the orbital period P: P^2 = (4 * pi^2 / G * M_star) * a^3. The first planet&#39;s period is 3 days, so for the second planet to have a period that allows both transits and occultations, its semi-major axis must be such that its impact parameter is within the allowable range. Since the first planet transits with b = 0.2, the second planet can have a slightly larger semi-major axis but must still transit. Using the relation between period and semi-major axis, we can determine the maximum period for the second planet. The second planet&#39;s period will be longer, but it must still allow for transits and occultations. After calculations, the maximum period that allows both phenomena is approximately 33.5 days.
