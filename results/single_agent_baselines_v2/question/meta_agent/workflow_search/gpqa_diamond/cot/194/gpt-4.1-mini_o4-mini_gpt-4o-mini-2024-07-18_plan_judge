Question: Example(question='Astronomers are observing a planet with a radius of 1 Earth radius in a circular orbit, with a transit impact parameter of 0.2, around a star that has a radius 1.5 times that of the Sun. This planet has an orbital period of 3 days. What is the maximum orbital period of a second planet, with a radius of 2.5 times that of Earth, in the same system that will exhibit both transit and occultation events? Assume that the second planet also has a circular orbit and shares the same orbital plane as the previously mentioned transiting planet.', choice1='~ 7.5', choice2='~ 33.5', choice3='~ 37.5', choice4='~ 12.5', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: To exhibit both transit and occultation, the second planet must have impact parameter b2≤1–k2, where k2=Rp2/R⋆. With Rp2=2.5R⊕ and R⋆=1.5R⊙≈1.5×109R⊕, k2≈2.5/(1.5×109)≈0.0153, so 1–k2≈0.9847. The planets share inclination, so b scales as b2=b1(a2/a1)=b1(P2/P1)2/3. We require b1(P2/P1)2/3≤1–k2 ⇒ P2_max=P1[(1–k2)/b1]3/2. With P1=3 d and b1=0.2, (1–k2)/b1≈4.9235, raised to 3/2≈10.93, so P2_max≈3×10.93≈32.8 d, i.e. choice ~33.5 days.
