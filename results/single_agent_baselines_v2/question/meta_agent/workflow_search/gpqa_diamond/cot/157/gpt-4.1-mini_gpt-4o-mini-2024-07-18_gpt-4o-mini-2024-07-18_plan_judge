Question: Example(question='In an inactive state, a transcription factor subunit awaits an activation signal from the membrane phosphorylation cascade. Upon phosphorylation on the Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, shuttles into the nucleus, and serves in gene transcription. A missense mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. You observe that a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Which of the following molecular phenotypes is most likely observed in the presence of mutation Y?', choice1='loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype', choice2='protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype', choice3='protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele', choice4='change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: In this scenario, we have two mutations affecting a transcription factor: a recessive loss-of-function mutation X in the transactivation domain and a heterozygous dominant-negative mutation Y in the dimerization domain. A dominant-negative mutation typically results in a situation where the mutated protein interferes with the function of the wild-type protein, often leading to a loss of function. Given that mutation Y is in the dimerization domain, it is likely to disrupt the ability of the transcription factor to form functional dimers with the wild-type subunit. This disruption can lead to a loss of function in the presence of the wild-type allele. Therefore, the most likely molecular phenotype observed in the presence of mutation Y would be protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele, as the presence of the dominant-negative mutation would prevent proper dimerization and function.
