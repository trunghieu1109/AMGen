Question: Example(question='In an inactive state, a transcription factor subunit awaits an activation signal from the membrane phosphorylation cascade. Upon phosphorylation on the Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, shuttles into the nucleus, and serves in gene transcription. A missense mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. You observe that a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Which of the following molecular phenotypes is most likely observed in the presence of mutation Y?', choice1='loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype', choice2='protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype', choice3='protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele', choice4='change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: Mutation Y is a heterozygous mutation in the dimerization domain that acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Dominant-negative mutations often result in a mutant protein that interferes with the function of the wild-type protein, often by forming non-functional complexes. Since the mutation is in the dimerization domain, it likely affects the ability of the protein to dimerize properly. The presence of the mutant protein might lead to improper dimerization, potentially causing a loss-of-function phenotype due to the formation of non-functional dimers. This suggests that the likely observed molecular phenotype would involve interference with normal dimerization, leading to a loss-of-function phenotype.

Answer:protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype
