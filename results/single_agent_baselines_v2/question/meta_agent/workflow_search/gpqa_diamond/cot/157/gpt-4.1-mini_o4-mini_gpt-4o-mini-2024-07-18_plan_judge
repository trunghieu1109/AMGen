Question: Example(question='In an inactive state, a transcription factor subunit awaits an activation signal from the membrane phosphorylation cascade. Upon phosphorylation on the Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, shuttles into the nucleus, and serves in gene transcription. A missense mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. You observe that a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Which of the following molecular phenotypes is most likely observed in the presence of mutation Y?', choice1='loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype', choice2='protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype', choice3='protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele', choice4='change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The dominant-negative mutation is in the dimerization domain. Such mutations allow the mutant protein to still bind (dimerize) with the wild-type subunit, but the resulting heterodimer is nonfunctional, effectively sequestering the wild-type protein and preventing transcription factor activity. This leads to formation of inactive aggregates or nonfunctional dimers and loss of function even in the presence of one wild-type allele. Therefore choice 2 fits best.
