Question: Example(question='How many of the stars listed below would be detectable using the ESPRESSO spectrograph, when it is coupled with one of the 8m VLT telescopes at the Paranal Observatory? A star is considered detectable if a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure is achieved.\n\nFor more details about the ESPRESSO spectrograph, please refer to the following link:\nhttps://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/instruments/espresso/overview.html\n\na) Canopus\nb) Polaris\nc) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 10 pc distance from us.\nd) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 200 pc distance from us.\ne) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 5 pc distance from us.\nf) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 50 pc distance from us.', choice1='4', choice2='3', choice3='2', choice4='5', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: Calculate apparent V magnitudes: a) Canopus V≈–0.7; b) Polaris V≈2.0; c) M_V=15 at 10 pc → V=15.0; d) at 200 pc → V≈21.5; e) at 5 pc → V≈13.5; f) at 50 pc → V≈18.5. ESPRESSO on an 8 m UT reaches S/N≈10 per binned pixel in 1 h up to roughly V≈16. Stars brighter than V≈16 (a, b, c, e) are detectable, giving 4 detections.
