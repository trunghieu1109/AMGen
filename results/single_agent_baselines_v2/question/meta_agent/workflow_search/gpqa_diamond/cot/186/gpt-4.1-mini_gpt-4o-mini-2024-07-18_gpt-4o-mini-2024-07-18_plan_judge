proposed answer: To determine how many of the listed stars are detectable using the ESPRESSO spectrograph, we need to consider the absolute magnitude and distance of each star to calculate their apparent magnitudes. A star is detectable if it has a sufficient brightness to achieve a signal-to-noise ratio of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. We can use the distance modulus formula to find the apparent magnitude: m = M + 5 * (log10(d) - 1), where m is the apparent magnitude, M is the absolute magnitude, and d is the distance in parsecs. Let's analyze each star:

1. **Canopus**: This star has an absolute magnitude of about -5.5 and is located at approximately 310 light-years (about 95 pc). Its apparent magnitude is around -5.5 + 5 * (log10(95) - 1) ≈ -5.5 + 5 * (1.978 - 1) ≈ -5.5 + 4.89 ≈ -0.61. This should be detectable.

2. **Polaris**: This star has an absolute magnitude of about -3.6 and is located about 433 light-years (about 132.5 pc) away. Its apparent magnitude is -3.6 + 5 * (log10(132.5) - 1) ≈ -3.6 + 5 * (2.121 - 1) ≈ -3.6 + 5.605 ≈ 2.005. This should also be detectable.

3. **Star at 10 pc**: Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag. Apparent magnitude is 15 + 5 * (log10(10) - 1) = 15 + 5 * (1 - 1) = 15. This is not detectable (too faint).

4. **Star at 200 pc**: Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag. Apparent magnitude is 15 + 5 * (log10(200) - 1) ≈ 15 + 5 * (2.301 - 1) ≈ 15 + 6.505 ≈ 21.505. This is not detectable (too faint).

5. **Star at 5 pc**: Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag. Apparent magnitude is 15 + 5 * (log10(5) - 1) ≈ 15 + 5 * (0.699 - 1) ≈ 15 - 1.505 ≈ 13.495. This is not detectable (too faint).

6. **Star at 50 pc**: Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag. Apparent magnitude is 15 + 5 * (log10(50) - 1) ≈ 15 + 5 * (1.699 - 1) ≈ 15 + 3.495 ≈ 18.495. This is not detectable (too faint).

In conclusion, only Canopus and Polaris are detectable, making a total of 2 detectable stars.
