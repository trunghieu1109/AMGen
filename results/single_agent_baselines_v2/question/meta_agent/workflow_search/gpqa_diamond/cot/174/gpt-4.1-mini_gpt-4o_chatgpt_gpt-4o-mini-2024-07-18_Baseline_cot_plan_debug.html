    <pre>The problem involves an oscillating charge distribution with a spheroidal shape, which radiates electromagnetic waves. In the radiation zone, the power radiated per unit solid angle depends on the wavelength \lambda and the angle \theta with respect to the symmetry axis (z-axis). The maximum power radiated is A, and we need to find the fraction of this power radiated at \theta = 30^\circ and a possible form of the function f(\lambda, \theta). For a spheroidal charge distribution, the radiation pattern is typically anisotropic, with the power varying with \theta. The power radiated at an angle \theta is often proportional to \sin^2(\theta) for dipole-like radiation. At \theta = 30^\circ, \sin(30^\circ) = 1/2, so \sin^2(30^\circ) = 1/4. Therefore, the fraction of the maximum power A radiated at \theta = 30^\circ is 1/4. The wavelength dependence in such radiation problems is typically a power law, often related to the inverse of some power of the wavelength. Given the choices, the plausible form for f could be \lambda^{-4}, which is common in dipole radiation scenarios. Hence, the answer is 1/4 for the fraction and \lambda^{-4} for the form of f.
