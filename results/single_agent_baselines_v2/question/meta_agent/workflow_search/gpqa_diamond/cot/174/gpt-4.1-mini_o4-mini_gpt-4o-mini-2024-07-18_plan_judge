Question: Example(question='Consider an oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis). Because it oscillates, it would radiate at a wavelength \\lambda. In the radiation zone, the radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of \\lambda and the angle \\theta (with z-axis), along which the power is measured. If the maximum power thus radiated is A, the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle \\theta = 30^0 and a possible form of f are, respectively,', choice1='1/2, \\lambda^(-4)', choice2='3/4, \\lambda^(-6)', choice3='1/4, \\lambda^(-4)', choice4='1/4, \\lambda^(-3)', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: An oscillating spheroidal charge will radiate like a dipole along its symmetry axis, with angular distribution ∝sin^2θ (max at θ=90°). At θ=30°, sin^2(30°)=(1/2)^2=1/4 of the peak. Dipole radiation power scales as ω^4∝λ⁻⁴. Hence the correct choice is 1/4 and λ^(-4).
