        "The possible forms of f suggest that we need to evaluate the angle dependency and the power scaling with \\lambda. The fraction of A that corresponds to \\theta = 30^0 is typically related to the angular distribution of radiation. Based on known results from electromagnetic radiation theory, the fraction at \\theta = 30^0 is likely to be 1/4, and the dependency on \\lambda is consistent with \\lambda^(-4). Therefore, the correct choice is '1/4, \\lambda^(-4)'.": "95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval: (0.0%, 0.0%), Median: 0.0%"
