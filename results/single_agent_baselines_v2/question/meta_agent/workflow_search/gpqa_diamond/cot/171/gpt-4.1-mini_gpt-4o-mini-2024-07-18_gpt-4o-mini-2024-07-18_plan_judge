Question: Example(question='Two stars are being studied. It has been observed that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2. In fact, the energy difference between the considered energy levels was determined to be approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J. Assuming that the stellar photospheres are in LTE, which of these equations for the effective temperatures of the stars (T_1 and T_2) is correct?', choice1='ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]\n', choice2='ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]\n', choice3='ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n', choice4='ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: To determine the correct equation relating the effective temperatures of the two stars, we need to consider the Boltzmann distribution in the context of thermal equilibrium. The ratio of the populations of two energy levels at thermal equilibrium is given by the Boltzmann factor, which can be expressed as: N1/N2 = exp(-ΔE/kT), where ΔE is the energy difference between the levels, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature. Given that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2, we have N1/N2 = 2. Thus, we can write: ln(2) = -ΔE/k * (1/T1 - 1/T2). Rearranging this gives us a relationship involving T1 and T2. We need to find the equation that matches this form.
