Question: Example(question='Two stars are being studied. It has been observed that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2. In fact, the energy difference between the considered energy levels was determined to be approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J. Assuming that the stellar photospheres are in LTE, which of these equations for the effective temperatures of the stars (T_1 and T_2) is correct?', choice1='ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]\n', choice2='ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]\n', choice3='ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n', choice4='ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: In LTE, the ratio of the populations of two energy states is given by the Boltzmann distribution: N_1/N_2 = g_1/g_2 * exp(-ΔE/kT), where ΔE is the energy difference between the states, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature. Since the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2, we have N_1/N_2 = 2. Assuming the degeneracy factors (g_1 and g_2) are the same for both stars, we can write: 2 = exp(-ΔE/kT_1) / exp(-ΔE/kT_2). Taking the natural logarithm of both sides gives: ln(2) = ΔE/k * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1). This simplifies to ln(2) = ΔE/k * (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1*T_2). Therefore, the correct equation is choice 4.
