Question: Example(question='There has been an outbreak of an viral infectious disease in your city. You have been asked to design a molecular diagnostic kit for quick detection of this retrovirus. How would you go about designing this kit?', choice1='First you identify the virus by performing DNA sequencing. You then develop a PCR kit for  quick and accurate diagnosis', choice2='First you identify the IgG antibodies for the infection. You then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG antibodies for quick \n and accurate diagnosis.', choice3='First you identify the virus using the information about the symptoms, provided by the affected patients. You then design a nested PCR kit based on the information for quick diagnosis.', choice4='First you identify the virus by performing cDNA sequencing.  You then develop a real time PCR kit for quick and accurate diagnosis.', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: To design a molecular diagnostic kit for a viral infectious disease, especially a retrovirus, the most appropriate approach is to identify the virus's genetic material. Real-time PCR is a widely used method for the rapid detection of viral RNA or DNA, making it suitable for quick diagnostics. cDNA sequencing is also relevant as retroviruses have RNA genomes that are reverse transcribed to DNA. Thus, the best option is to identify the virus through cDNA sequencing and then develop a real-time PCR kit for accurate and quick diagnosis.
