    <pre>To design a molecular diagnostic kit for a retrovirus, it is important to consider the nature of the virus. Retroviruses have RNA genomes, and they reverse transcribe their RNA into DNA in the host cell. Therefore, detecting the viral RNA or its cDNA is crucial for diagnosis. cDNA sequencing would allow for the identification of the viral genome. Once the viral sequence is known, specific primers can be designed for real-time PCR, which is a sensitive and quick method for detecting viral nucleic acids.
