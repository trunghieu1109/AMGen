Question: {'question': 'There has been an outbreak of an viral infectious disease in your city. You have been asked to design a molecular diagnostic kit for quick detection of this retrovirus. How would you go about designing this kit?', 'choice1': 'First you identify the virus by performing DNA sequencing. You then develop a PCR kit for  quick and accurate diagnosis', 'choice2': 'First you identify the IgG antibodies for the infection. You then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG antibodies for quick \n and accurate diagnosis.', 'choice3': 'First you identify the virus using the information about the symptoms, provided by the affected patients. You then design a nested PCR kit based on the information for quick diagnosis.', 'choice4': 'First you identify the virus by performing cDNA sequencing.  You then develop a real time PCR kit for quick and accurate diagnosis.'}\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent dzzT', content='To design a molecular diagnostic kit for a retrovirus, it is important to consider the nature of the virus. Retroviruses have RNA genomes, and they reverse transcribe their RNA into DNA in the host cell. Therefore, detecting the viral RNA or its cDNA is crucial for diagnosis. cDNA sequencing would allow for the identification of the viral genome. Once the viral sequence is known, specific primers can be designed for real-time PCR, which is a sensitive and quick method for detecting viral nucleic acids.\n\nAnswer:D)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
