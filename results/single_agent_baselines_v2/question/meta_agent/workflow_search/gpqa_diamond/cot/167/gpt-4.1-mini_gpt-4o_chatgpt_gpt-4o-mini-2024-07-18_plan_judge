Question: Example(question='Which of the following issues are the most common sources of difficult-to-spot erroneous results generated in genomics data analysis:\n\n- Mutually incompatible data formats\n- The "chr" / "no chr" confusion\n- Reference assembly mismatch\n- Incorrect ID conversion', choice1='3 and 4', choice2='2 and 3', choice3='All of the above', choice4='2, 3 and 4', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: To determine which issues are the most common sources of difficult-to-spot erroneous results in genomics data analysis, consider each option: 1) Mutually incompatible data formats can lead to errors if tools expect different formats. 2) The 'chr' / 'no chr' confusion arises when some tools expect chromosome names with 'chr' prefix and others do not, causing mismatches. 3) Reference assembly mismatch occurs when different datasets use different genome assemblies, leading to inconsistencies. 4) Incorrect ID conversion can happen when converting between different gene or transcript IDs, leading to errors. All these issues are common and can lead to subtle errors, so 'All of the above' is likely the best choice.
