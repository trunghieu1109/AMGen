Question: Example(question='Which of the following issues are the most common sources of difficult-to-spot erroneous results generated in genomics data analysis:\n\n- Mutually incompatible data formats\n- The "chr" / "no chr" confusion\n- Reference assembly mismatch\n- Incorrect ID conversion', choice1='3 and 4', choice2='2 and 3', choice3='All of the above', choice4='2, 3 and 4', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: To determine which issues are the most common sources of difficult-to-spot erroneous results in genomics data analysis, we consider the provided options. Each of the listed issues can lead to errors: mutually incompatible data formats can cause data integration problems, confusion between 'chr' and 'no chr' can lead to incorrect chromosome assignments, reference assembly mismatch can lead to misalignment of genomic data, and incorrect ID conversion can lead to misinterpretation of data. Given that all these issues can potentially contribute to errors, the choice that encompasses all of them would be the most comprehensive.
