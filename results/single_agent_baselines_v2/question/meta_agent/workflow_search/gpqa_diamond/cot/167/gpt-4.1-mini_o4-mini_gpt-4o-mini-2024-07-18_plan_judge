Question: Example(question='Which of the following issues are the most common sources of difficult-to-spot erroneous results generated in genomics data analysis:\n\n- Mutually incompatible data formats\n- The "chr" / "no chr" confusion\n- Reference assembly mismatch\n- Incorrect ID conversion', choice1='3 and 4', choice2='2 and 3', choice3='All of the above', choice4='2, 3 and 4', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The question asks for the most common sources of subtle errors in genomics data analysis. While mutually incompatible data formats can cause issues, they tend to be more obvious. The most insidious, hard-to-spot errors arise from chromosome naming (‘chr’/’no chr’), mismatched reference assemblies, and incorrect ID conversions. These correspond to options 2, 3, and 4, which is choice4.
