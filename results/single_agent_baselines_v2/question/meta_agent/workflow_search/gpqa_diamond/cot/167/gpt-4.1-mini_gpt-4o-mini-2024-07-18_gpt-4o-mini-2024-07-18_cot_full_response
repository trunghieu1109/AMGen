Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 2cpG', content="To determine which issues are the most common sources of difficult-to-spot erroneous results in genomics data analysis, we consider the provided options. Each of the listed issues can lead to errors: mutually incompatible data formats can cause data integration problems, confusion between 'chr' and 'no chr' can lead to incorrect chromosome assignments, reference assembly mismatch can lead to misalignment of genomic data, and incorrect ID conversion can lead to misinterpretation of data. Given that all these issues can potentially contribute to errors, the choice that encompasses all of them would be the most comprehensive.\n\nAnswer:C", prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
