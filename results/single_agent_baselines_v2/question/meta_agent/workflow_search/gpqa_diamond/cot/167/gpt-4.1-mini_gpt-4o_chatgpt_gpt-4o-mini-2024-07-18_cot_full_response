Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 2cpG', content="To determine which issues are the most common sources of difficult-to-spot erroneous results in genomics data analysis, consider each option: 1) Mutually incompatible data formats can lead to errors if tools expect different formats. 2) The 'chr' / 'no chr' confusion arises when some tools expect chromosome names with 'chr' prefix and others do not, causing mismatches. 3) Reference assembly mismatch occurs when different datasets use different genome assemblies, leading to inconsistencies. 4) Incorrect ID conversion can happen when converting between different gene or transcript IDs, leading to errors. All these issues are common and can lead to subtle errors, so 'All of the above' is likely the best choice.\n\nAnswer:C)", prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
