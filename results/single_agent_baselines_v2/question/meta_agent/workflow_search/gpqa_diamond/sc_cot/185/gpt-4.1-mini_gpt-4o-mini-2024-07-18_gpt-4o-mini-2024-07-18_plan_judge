Question: Example(question='Identify the possible product when (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene undergoes Cope rearrangement.', choice1='4,4a,7,7a-tetrahydro-1H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine', choice2='4,4a,5,7a-tetrahydro-3H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine', choice3='4,6,7,7a-tetrahydro-3H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine', choice4='4,4a,5,6-tetrahydro-1H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To identify the possible product of the Cope rearrangement of (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene, we need to consider the mechanism of the Cope rearrangement which involves the migration of a double bond and the formation of a new product with a different structure. The starting compound has a specific stereochemistry and ring structure that will influence the outcome. Analyzing the provided choices, we look for the one that matches the expected rearrangement product based on the structure of the starting material.

Answer:4,4a,5,6-tetrahydro-1H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine
Extracted answer: 4,4a,5,6-tetrahydro-1H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine
Correct answer: 1
