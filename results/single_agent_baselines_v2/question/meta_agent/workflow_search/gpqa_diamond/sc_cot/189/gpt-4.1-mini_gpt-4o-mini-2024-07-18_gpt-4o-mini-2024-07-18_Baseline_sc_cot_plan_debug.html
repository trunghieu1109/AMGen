    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;The reaction of an electron pair donor, nucleophile (Nu) with an electron pair acceptor is called nucleophilic substitution reaction. An sp3-hybridized electrophile needs to have a leaving group to proceed with the reaction. Substitution reactions have the following two types. One is SN1 and the other is the SN2 reaction. In contrast to the substitution reaction, the elimination reaction involves the removal of a pair or groups of atoms from a molecule. These are chemical reactions in which single carbon-carbon bonded organic compounds are converted to compounds containing double/triple bonds (unsaturated compounds).\nArrange the following nucleophiles more reactive to the poorest reactive in the aqueous solution.\n\n1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate\n2. Hydroxide\n3. Propionate\n4. Methanol\n5. Ethanethiolate&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;5, 2, 1, 3 and 4&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;2, 5, 1, 4 and 3&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;5, 2, 3, 1 and 4&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;2, 5, 3, 4 and 3&#39;}

    <pre>To determine the reactivity of the nucleophiles in aqueous solution, we consider their basicity and sterics. Generally, stronger bases are better nucleophiles. Among the given nucleophiles, ethanethiolate (5) is a strong nucleophile due to its negative charge, followed by hydroxide (2), which is also a strong nucleophile. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (1) is a moderate nucleophile, while propionate (3) and methanol (4) are weaker nucleophiles due to their less basic nature. Therefore, the order of reactivity from most reactive to least reactive would be ethanethiolate (5), hydroxide (2), 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (1), propionate (3), and methanol (4). This corresponds to choice 1.
