Question: Example(question='3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one is treated with sodium hydride, followed by benzyl bromide, forming product 1.\n\n1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide in the presence of a catalytic amount of HCl, forming product 2.\n\n2 is treated at low temperature with n-butyllithium, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride, forming product 3.\n\n3 is stirred with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere, forming product 4.\n\nWhat is the structure of product 4?', choice1='(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol', choice2="N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide", choice3='(((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene', choice4='3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: Step 1: NaH deprotonates the 3-hydroxymethyl to give an alkoxide, which is benzylated by benzyl bromide to give 1: 3-(benzyloxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.
Step 2: Reaction with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide forms the tosylhydrazone at C-1 (product 2).
Step 3: Treatment of the tosylhydrazone with n-BuLi and work-up effects a Shapiro elimination, converting the C-1 ketone into a C=C (cyclohexene) (product 3), leaving the benzyl ether and prop-1-en-2-yl intact.
Step 4: Catalytic hydrogenation (Pd/C, H₂) reduces both the ring C=C and the isopropenyl double bond to give a saturated cyclohexane, and also cleaves the benzyl ether to liberate the C3 hydroxymethyl. The final product is cyclohexane bearing a CH₂OH substituent (at C1) and an isopropyl substituent at C3, which by standard numbering is named (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.
