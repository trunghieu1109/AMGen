    <pre>We start with 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Treating it with sodium hydride followed by benzyl bromide suggests a Williamson ether synthesis, forming a benzyloxy ether at the hydroxymethyl position, yielding a benzyloxymethyl group. This is product 1. Product 1 is then treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide, which typically forms a tosylhydrazone. However, the presence of HCl indicates possible formation of a hydrazone at the ketone position, leading to product 2. Product 2 is treated with n-butyllithium and then aqueous ammonium chloride, which could lead to a reduction of the tosylhydrazone to an alkane, giving a 3-isopropylcyclohexane with a benzyloxymethyl group. Product 3 is then hydrogenated in the presence of Pd/C, which would remove the benzyl protecting group, leading to (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol as the final product 4.
