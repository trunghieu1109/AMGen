Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent VrPK', content='To find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species, we need to calculate the concentration of the dithiocyanato complex [Co(SCN)2] and the total concentration of all cobalt species in the solution. The stability constants provided will help us determine the concentrations of the various complexes formed. Given the concentrations of Co(II) and SCN-, we can use the stability constants to find the equilibrium concentrations of the complexes. Finally, we will calculate the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex relative to the total cobalt concentration.\n\nAnswer:42.3%', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
