Question: {'question': 'We have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate, where the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M and the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16. What will be the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species in the solution?

Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent VrPK', content='We consider the overall formation constants βi for Co(SCN)i species: [Co(SCN)i]=βi[Co][SCN]i, with [SCN–]=0.1 M. The distribution fractions αi=βi[SCN]^i/Σjβj[SCN]^j (with β0=1). Compute terms: β0=1→1; β1·L=9·0.1=0.9; β2·L^2=40·0.01=0.4; β3·L^3=63·0.001=0.063; β4·L^4=16·0.0001=0.0016. Sum=2.3646. The fraction α2=0.4/2.3646≈0.1692→16.9%.\n\nAnswer:A)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
