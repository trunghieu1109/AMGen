Question: Example(question='We have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate, where the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M and the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16. What will be the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species in the solution? ', choice1='16.9%', choice2='42.3%', choice3='25.6%', choice4='38.1%', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species, we need to calculate the concentration of the dithiocyanato complex [Co(SCN)2] and the total concentration of all cobalt species in the solution. The stability constants provided will help us determine the concentrations of the various complexes formed. Given the concentrations of Co(II) and SCN-, we can use the stability constants to find the equilibrium concentrations of the complexes. Finally, we will calculate the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex relative to the total cobalt concentration.
