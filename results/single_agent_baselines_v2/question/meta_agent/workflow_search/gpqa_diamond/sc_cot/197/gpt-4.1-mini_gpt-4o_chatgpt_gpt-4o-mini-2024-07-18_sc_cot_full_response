Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent Hc50', content='To find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes, Co(SCN)2, among all cobalt-containing species, we need to calculate the concentration of Co(SCN)2 and the total concentration of all cobalt species. The stability constants are given as β1 = 9, β2 = 40, β3 = 63, and β4 = 16. These correspond to the formation of Co(SCN)+, Co(SCN)2, Co(SCN)3-, and Co(SCN)4^2-, respectively. The equilibrium expressions are: [Co(SCN)+] = β1[Co2+][SCN-], [Co(SCN)2] = β2[Co2+][SCN-]^2, [Co(SCN)3-] = β3[Co2+][SCN-]^3, [Co(SCN)4^2-] = β4[Co2+][SCN-]^4. We have [SCN-] = 0.1 M and c(Co) = 10^-2 M. The concentration of each species can be expressed in terms of [Co2+]. The total concentration is [Co2+] + β1[Co2+][SCN-] + β2[Co2+][SCN-]^2 + β3[Co2+][SCN-]^3 + β4[Co2+][SCN-]^4 = 10^-2 M. Solving this equation will give [Co2+]. Then, [Co(SCN)2] = β2[Co2+][SCN-]^2 can be calculated. Finally, the percentage is given by 100 * [Co(SCN)2] / total concentration. After solving, the percentage of Co(SCN)2 is found to be 42.3%.\n\nAnswer:B)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
