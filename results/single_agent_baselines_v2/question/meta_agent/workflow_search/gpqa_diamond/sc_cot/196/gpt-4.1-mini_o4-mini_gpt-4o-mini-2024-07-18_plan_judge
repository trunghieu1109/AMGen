Question: Example(question='Compound X, which has the following IR and NMR data, reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Identify the final product.\nIR: 3400–2500 cm-1, 1720 cm-1, 1610 cm-1, 1450 cm-1\n1H NMR: 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H), 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H), 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).', choice1='1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene', choice2='4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid', choice3='2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid', choice4='1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: We have IR 3400–2500 cm–1 (broad O–H), 1720 cm–1 (C=O), plus aromatic bands: a para-disubstituted benzene. The 1H NMR shows 10.5 ppm bs (carboxylic acid proton), aromatic 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H), and aliphatic signals matching a sec-butyl group: CH (m, 1H) at 2.9 ppm, CH2 (m, 2H) at 1.7 ppm, CH3 on the CH as a doublet (3H) at 1.4 ppm, and CH3 of the ethyl chain as a triplet (3H) at 0.9 ppm. So X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (choice B). Treating a benzoic acid with red P and HI reduces the –COOH to –CH3, giving the corresponding alkylbenzene: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which is choice A.
