Question: Example(question='An electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Find the expectation value of its spin along y-direction, S_y.\nNote: \\sigma_y (in latex format) is: \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & -i \\\\\ni & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}', choice1='-25*hbar/2\n\n', choice2='-12*hbar/25\n\n', choice3='12*hbar/25', choice4='25*hbar/2\n', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, we need to use the given spin state and the matrix representation of the spin operator S_y. The spin state is given as (3i, 4). We will first normalize this state, then compute the expectation value using the S_y operator matrix. The expectation value is calculated using the formula <ψ|S_y|ψ> where |ψ> is the state vector. After performing the calculations, we will compare the result with the provided choices.

Answer:The expectation value of S_y is -12*hbar/25.
Extracted answer: The expectation value of S_y is -12*hbar/25.
Correct answer: 2
