Question: Example(question='An electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Find the expectation value of its spin along y-direction, S_y.\nNote: \\sigma_y (in latex format) is: \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & -i \\\\\ni & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}', choice1='-25*hbar/2\n\n', choice2='-12*hbar/25\n\n', choice3='12*hbar/25', choice4='25*hbar/2\n', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: We have spinor ψ = (3i, 4)^T. Compute expectation value ⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2)⟨ψ|σ_y|ψ⟩/⟨ψ|ψ⟩. First, ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = |3i|² + |4|² = 9 + 16 = 25. Next, σ_y ψ = [0  -i; i  0] (3i,4)^T = (-i·4, i·3i) = (-4i, -3). Then ⟨ψ|σ_y|ψ⟩ = (−3i, 4)·(−4i, −3) = (−3i)(−4i) + 4(−3) = (12i²) + (−12) = −12 −12 = −24. Thus ⟨σ_y⟩ = −24/25 and ⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2)(−24/25) = −12ħ/25, which is choice B.
