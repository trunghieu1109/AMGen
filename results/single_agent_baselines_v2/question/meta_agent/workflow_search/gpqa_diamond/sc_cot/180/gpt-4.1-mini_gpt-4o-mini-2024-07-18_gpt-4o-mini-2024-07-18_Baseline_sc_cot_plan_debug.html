    <pre>The question asks for the ratio of neutrino fluxes in two energy bands after stopping the pp-III branch in the Sun. The pp-III branch primarily produces neutrinos in the energy range of 700-800 keV, while the 800-900 keV band is produced by other processes. Since the pp-III branch has stopped, the flux in the first band (700-800 keV) would decrease significantly, while the second band (800-900 keV) would remain relatively unaffected. Therefore, we would expect the flux ratio of band 1 to band 2 to be very low. Among the choices given, 0.01 (10^-2) seems to represent a significant drop in flux for band 1 compared to band 2, which aligns with the expected outcome of stopping the pp-III branch.

Answer:0.01 (10^-2).</pre>
