Question: Example(question='Very large number of neutrinos produced by the Sun reach the Earth (very large flux of neutrinos, defined as the number of neutrinos per cm^2, per second).\n\nLet us assume that, hypothetically, the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the core of the Sun about 8 and a half minutes ago, while all other reactions remained as they were.\n\nWhat would be the approximate ratio of the flux between two bands of neutrino energies of 700-800 KeV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). \n\nFlux (band 1) / flux (band 2) is:\n\n(Note: we are talking about stopping the pp-III branch, not pp-II, pp-I or any other. It’s not a typo or something like that.)\n(Note 2: solar neutrino flavor changes happen, but do not play a role here.)', choice1='0.1 (10^-1).', choice2='10.', choice3='1.', choice4='0.01 (10^-2).', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The question asks for the ratio of neutrino fluxes in two energy bands after stopping the pp-III branch in the Sun. The pp-III branch primarily produces neutrinos in the energy range of 700-800 keV, while the 800-900 keV band is produced by other processes. Since the pp-III branch has stopped, the flux in the first band (700-800 keV) would decrease significantly, while the second band (800-900 keV) would remain relatively unaffected. Therefore, we would expect the flux ratio of band 1 to band 2 to be very low. Among the choices given, 0.01 (10^-2) seems to represent a significant drop in flux for band 1 compared to band 2, which aligns with the expected outcome of stopping the pp-III branch.

Answer:0.01 (10^-2).
