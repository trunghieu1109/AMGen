Question: Example(question='Very large number of neutrinos produced by the Sun reach the Earth (very large flux of neutrinos, defined as the number of neutrinos per cm^2, per second).\n\nLet us assume that, hypothetically, the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the core of the Sun about 8 and a half minutes ago, while all other reactions remained as they were.\n\nWhat would be the approximate ratio of the flux between two bands of neutrino energies of 700-800 KeV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). \n\nFlux (band 1) / flux (band 2) is:\n\n(Note: we are talking about stopping the pp-III branch, not pp-II, pp-I or any other. Itâ€™s not a typo or something like that.)\n(Note 2: solar neutrino flavor changes happen, but do not play a role here.)', choice1='0.1 (10^-1).', choice2='10.', choice3='1.', choice4='0.01 (10^-2).', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The pp-III branch of the proton-proton chain in the Sun produces high-energy neutrinos, primarily from the decay of Beryllium-8 (8B), which results in neutrinos with energies significantly higher than 700-900 keV. The pp-I branch produces neutrinos from the decay of Beryllium-7 (7Be) and proton-proton fusion, which have energies around 700-800 keV. The pp-II branch also produces neutrinos from the decay of Beryllium-7 (7Be), but these are not in the 800-900 keV range. Since the pp-III branch has stopped, the flux of neutrinos in the 800-900 keV range (band 2) will be significantly reduced, as these would primarily come from the higher energy neutrinos produced by the 8B decay. However, the flux in the 700-800 keV range (band 1) should remain relatively unchanged, as it is primarily from the pp-I and pp-II branches, which are still active. Therefore, the ratio of flux (band 1) / flux (band 2) should increase significantly, as band 2's flux decreases while band 1's remains stable.
