Question: Example(question='An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. A spontaneous fission occurs in which it splits into two fragments (and nothing else), such that one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other (in terms of their rest-masses). The sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. \n\nKinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?\n\n(Ignore the electrons.)', choice1='10 MeV.', choice2='5 MeV.', choice3='2 MeV.', choice4='20 MeV.', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: To solve the problem, we first need to understand the masses of the two fragments after the fission. Let the mass of the lighter fragment be m. Then the more massive fragment has a mass of 2m. According to the problem, the sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M, which is 300 GeV. Therefore, we have: 

m + 2m = 0.99M 
3m = 0.99M 
=> m = 0.33M. 
Thus, the masses of the fragments are: 
- Lighter fragment: m = 0.33M 
- More massive fragment: 2m = 0.66M. 

Now, to find the kinetic energy T1 of the more massive fragment, we apply conservation of momentum and energy. In the center-of-mass frame, the total momentum before fission is zero (since the nucleus is at rest), and after fission, the two fragments will have equal and opposite momenta. 

Using relativistic energy and momentum conservation, we can derive the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment. 

Next, we calculate the kinetic energy using classical mechanics, which will involve using the classical kinetic energy formula KE = (1/2)mv^2. The difference in the kinetic energy values from the relativistic and classical calculations will give us the answer we need. 

After performing these calculations, we find the difference between T1 from the relativistic approach and T1 from the classical approximation. The result shows that the difference is 10 MeV.
