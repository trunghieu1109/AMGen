Question: Example(question='An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. A spontaneous fission occurs in which it splits into two fragments (and nothing else), such that one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other (in terms of their rest-masses). The sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. \n\nKinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?\n\n(Ignore the electrons.)', choice1='10 MeV.', choice2='5 MeV.', choice3='2 MeV.', choice4='20 MeV.', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: Initial mass M c^2=300 GeV. After fission, fragment rest energies m1=198 GeV, m2=99 GeV (sum=297 GeV), so total KE=3 GeV. In the CM frame both fragments have equal momentum p. From E1+E2=300 GeV one finds E1=√(p^2+198^2)=199.005 GeV→T1_rel=1.005 GeV. Classically T1_class=p^2/(2m1)=398.99/(396)=1.0075 GeV. Difference≈2.5 MeV ≃2 MeV.
