Question: Example(question='An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. A spontaneous fission occurs in which it splits into two fragments (and nothing else), such that one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other (in terms of their rest-masses). The sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. \n\nKinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?\n\n(Ignore the electrons.)', choice1='10 MeV.', choice2='5 MeV.', choice3='2 MeV.', choice4='20 MeV.', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: To solve this problem, we first establish the following: The initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus is 300 GeV. After fission, the total rest-mass energy of the fragments is 99% of the initial, which is 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV. Let the rest mass of the lighter fragment be m, and the rest mass of the heavier fragment be 2m. Therefore, m + 2m = 3m = 297 GeV, giving m = 99 GeV and 2m = 198 GeV. 

The total energy before fission is 300 GeV (rest energy), and after fission, the total energy is the sum of rest energies and kinetic energies of the fragments. Let T1 and T2 be the kinetic energies of the heavier and lighter fragments, respectively. 

Using conservation of energy: 297 GeV + T1 + T2 = 300 GeV, so T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.

Using conservation of momentum and the fact that the initial momentum is zero, the momentum of the heavier fragment p1 is equal and opposite to that of the lighter fragment p2. 

Using relativistic energy-momentum relation for the heavier fragment: (E1)^2 = (p1*c)^2 + (m1*c^2)^2, where E1 = 198 GeV + T1 and m1 = 198 GeV/c^2. 

The classical approximation assumes p1 = m1*v1, and T1 = (1/2)*m1*v1^2. 

We find the relativistic T1 and the classical T1, and the difference is the answer.
