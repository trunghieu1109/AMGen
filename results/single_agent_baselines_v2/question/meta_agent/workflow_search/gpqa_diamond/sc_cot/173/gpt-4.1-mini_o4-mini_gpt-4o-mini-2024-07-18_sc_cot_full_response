Question: {'question': 'An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. A spontaneous fission occurs in which it splits into two fragments (and nothing else), such that one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other (in terms of their rest-masses). The sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. \n\nKinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?\n\n(Ignore the electrons.)', 'choice1': '10 MeV.', 'choice2': '5 MeV.', 'choice3': '2 MeV.', 'choice4': '20 MeV.'}\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent GPoM', content='Initial mass M c^2=300\u2009GeV. After fission, fragment rest energies m1=198\u2009GeV, m2=99\u2009GeV (sum=297\u2009GeV), so total KE=3\u2009GeV. In the CM frame both fragments have equal momentum p. From E1+E2=300\u2009GeV one finds E1=√(p^2+198^2)=199.005\u2009GeV→T1_rel=1.005\u2009GeV. Classically T1_class=p^2/(2m1)=398.99/(396)=1.0075\u2009GeV. Difference≈2.5\u2009MeV ≃2\u2009MeV.\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
