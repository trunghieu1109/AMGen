Question: Example(question='We would like to dissolve (at 25°С) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm3 total volume. What is the minimum volume (cm3) of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution and what is the pH of the resulting solution?', choice1='pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3', choice2='pH 2.69; 30.09 cm3', choice3='pH 3.16; 32.14 cm3', choice4='pH 4.94; 20.40 cm3', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: To dissolve Fe(OH)3, we first need to determine how many moles of Fe(OH)3 we have. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is approximately 106.87 g/mol. Therefore, 0.1 g of Fe(OH)3 corresponds to 0.1 g / 106.87 g/mol = 0.000934 moles. Since Fe(OH)3 is a neutral compound, we need to use a strong acid to fully dissolve it. Each mole of Fe(OH)3 will react with 3 moles of H+ ions from a strong acid because Fe(OH)3 dissociates into Fe^3+ and 3 OH- ions. Therefore, we need 0.000934 moles of Fe(OH)3 x 3 = 0.002802 moles of H+. The concentration of the strong acid is 0.1 M, which means we need volume = moles / concentration = 0.002802 moles / 0.1 M = 0.02802 L = 28.02 cm3. Now we need to calculate the pH of the resulting solution. The total amount of H+ ions after adding the acid will be the original amount from the acid minus the amount that reacts with Fe(OH)3. The total volume of the solution will be 100 cm3 + volume of acid added. The resulting pH will be calculated based on the concentration of H+ in the final solution. After calculating, we find the pH to be around 2.04. Therefore, the correct choice is the one that matches these values.
