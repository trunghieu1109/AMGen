Question: Example(question='We would like to dissolve (at 25°С) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm3 total volume. What is the minimum volume (cm3) of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution and what is the pH of the resulting solution?', choice1='pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3', choice2='pH 2.69; 30.09 cm3', choice3='pH 3.16; 32.14 cm3', choice4='pH 4.94; 20.40 cm3', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: First, calculate moles of Fe(OH)3: M = 55.845 + 3×17 ≈ 106.845 g/mol, so n = 0.1 g /106.845 ≈ 9.36×10⁻⁴ mol. Each Fe(OH)3 requires 3 H⁺ to dissolve, so total H⁺ needed = 3×9.36×10⁻⁴ ≈ 2.808×10⁻³ mol. Using 0.1 M acid, volume = 2.808×10⁻³ mol ÷ 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 L ≈ 28.1 cm³. This matches choice1’s 28.05 cm³. After neutralization, the solution pH is determined by hydrolysis of Fe³⁺; using the first dissociation constant of [Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺ (Ka₁ ≈ 6.3×10⁻³) and C = 9.36×10⁻³ M gives pH ≈ 2.04. Thus choice1 is correct.
