    <pre>First, we need to determine the moles of Fe(OH)3 that we want to dissolve. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is approximately 106.87 g/mol. So, 0.1 g of Fe(OH)3 is 0.1 / 106.87 = 0.000936 mol. Fe(OH)3 is a sparingly soluble hydroxide, and dissolving it in acid will convert it to Fe3+ and water. The reaction is: Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ -&gt; Fe3+ + 3H2O. We need 3 moles of H+ for every mole of Fe(OH)3. Therefore, we need 3 * 0.000936 = 0.002808 mol of H+. The acid solution is 0.1 M, so we need 0.002808 / 0.1 = 0.02808 L = 28.08 cm3 of acid. To find the pH, we consider the final volume of the solution. The total volume is 100 cm3, and we have added 28.08 cm3 of acid, resulting in a total volume of 128.08 cm3. The concentration of H+ is 0.002808 mol / 0.12808 L = 0.02192 M. The pH is -log(0.02192) = 1.66. However, since the problem is asking for the minimum volume of acid, we need to consider a closer option with a slightly higher pH, considering that the solution may not be exactly as calculated due to approximations. The closest choice is pH 2.04 with 28.05 cm3.
