Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent mPTt', content='The question asks which issues most commonly produce subtle, hard-to-spot errors. While incompatible file formats typically cause immediate failures, the chr/no-chr prefix mismatch, reference assembly mismatch, and ID conversion errors can pass silently, leading to downstream mistakes. Thus the correct combination is items 2, 3, and 4.\n\nAnswer:D)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
