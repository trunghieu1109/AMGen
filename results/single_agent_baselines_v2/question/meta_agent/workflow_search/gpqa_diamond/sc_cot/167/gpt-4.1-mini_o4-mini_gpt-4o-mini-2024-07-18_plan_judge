Question: Example(question='Which of the following issues are the most common sources of difficult-to-spot erroneous results generated in genomics data analysis:\n\n- Mutually incompatible data formats\n- The "chr" / "no chr" confusion\n- Reference assembly mismatch\n- Incorrect ID conversion', choice1='3 and 4', choice2='2 and 3', choice3='All of the above', choice4='2, 3 and 4', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The question asks which issues most commonly produce subtle, hard-to-spot errors. While incompatible file formats typically cause immediate failures, the chr/no-chr prefix mismatch, reference assembly mismatch, and ID conversion errors can pass silently, leading to downstream mistakes. Thus the correct combination is items 2, 3, and 4.
