Question: Example(question='Which of the following issues are the most common sources of difficult-to-spot erroneous results generated in genomics data analysis:\n\n- Mutually incompatible data formats\n- The "chr" / "no chr" confusion\n- Reference assembly mismatch\n- Incorrect ID conversion', choice1='3 and 4', choice2='2 and 3', choice3='All of the above', choice4='2, 3 and 4', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To determine the most common sources of difficult-to-spot erroneous results in genomics data analysis, we need to consider the options provided. Each of the listed issues can lead to errors in data analysis. 'Mutually incompatible data formats' can lead to data processing issues, 'chr' / 'no chr' confusion can cause misalignment in genomic coordinates, 'reference assembly mismatch' can lead to incorrect variant calling, and 'incorrect ID conversion' can result in misidentification of genes or variants. Since all these issues can contribute to errors, the best choice is that all of them are common sources of errors.

Answer:All of the above
Extracted answer: All of the above
Correct answer: 1
