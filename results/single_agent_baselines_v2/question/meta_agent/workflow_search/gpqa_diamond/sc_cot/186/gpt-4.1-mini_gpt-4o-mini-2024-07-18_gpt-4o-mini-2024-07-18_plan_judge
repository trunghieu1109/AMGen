proposed answer: To determine how many stars are detectable with the ESPRESSO spectrograph at a S/N of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure, we need to evaluate each star's brightness and distance. The apparent magnitude can be calculated using the formula: m = M + 5 * (log10(d) - 1), where M is the absolute magnitude and d is the distance in parsecs. A star is detectable if its apparent magnitude is within the sensitivity range of the ESPRESSO spectrograph. Canopus and Polaris are both bright stars, and their apparent magnitudes should be checked. The stars with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg have an Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag, and their distances vary, which will affect their apparent magnitudes. After calculating, we find that Canopus and Polaris are detectable, as well as the star at 5 pc distance, making a total of 3 detectable stars.
