Question: Example(question='How many of the stars listed below would be detectable using the ESPRESSO spectrograph, when it is coupled with one of the 8m VLT telescopes at the Paranal Observatory? A star is considered detectable if a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure is achieved.\n\nFor more details about the ESPRESSO spectrograph, please refer to the following link:\nhttps://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/instruments/espresso/overview.html\n\na) Canopus\nb) Polaris\nc) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 10 pc distance from us.\nd) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 200 pc distance from us.\ne) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 5 pc distance from us.\nf) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 50 pc distance from us.', choice1='4', choice2='3', choice3='2', choice4='5', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: To determine which stars are detectable with ESPRESSO (single 8 m UT, HR mode, R≈140 000) in 1 h exposure at S/N≥10, note its limiting magnitude is about V≈16.5. 

Compute apparent magnitudes:
 a) Canopus V≈–0.7 → detectable
 b) Polaris V≈2.0 → detectable
 c) Mv=15 at 10 pc → m=15+5 log(10/10)=15 → detectable
 d) Mv=15 at 200 pc → m=15+5 log(200/10)=≈21.5 → too faint
 e) Mv=15 at 5 pc → m=15+5 log(5/10)=≈13.5 → detectable
 f) Mv=15 at 50 pc → m=15+5 log(50/10)=≈18.5 → too faint

Thus detectable stars are a, b, c, e: total 4.
