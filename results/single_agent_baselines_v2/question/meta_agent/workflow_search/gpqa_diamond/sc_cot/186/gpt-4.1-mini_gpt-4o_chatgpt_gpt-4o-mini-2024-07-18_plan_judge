proposed answer: To determine which stars are detectable with the ESPRESSO spectrograph on the VLT, we need to consider the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) for each star during a 1-hour exposure. The ESPRESSO spectrograph's performance depends on the apparent magnitude of the star and the telescope's capabilities. The apparent magnitude is calculated using the formula: m = M + 5(log10(d) - 1), where M is the absolute magnitude and d is the distance in parsecs. We then compare the apparent magnitude to the sensitivity of the ESPRESSO spectrograph, which can achieve a S/N of 10 for stars brighter than a certain magnitude. 

1. Canopus (Alpha Carinae) is a bright star with an apparent magnitude of -0.74. It is easily detectable.
2. Polaris (Alpha Ursae Minoris) has an apparent magnitude of 1.98. It is detectable.
3. A star with absolute magnitude 15 mag at 10 pc has an apparent magnitude of 15 mag, which might be on the edge of detectability.
4. A star with absolute magnitude 15 mag at 200 pc has an apparent magnitude of 20.5 mag, which is likely too faint.
5. A star with absolute magnitude 15 mag at 5 pc has an apparent magnitude of 14.25 mag, which might be detectable.
6. A star with absolute magnitude 15 mag at 50 pc has an apparent magnitude of 19.5 mag, which might be too faint.

Based on typical sensitivity limits for such instruments, stars with apparent magnitudes up to around 14-15 might be detectable. Therefore, Canopus, Polaris, and the star at 5 pc are likely detectable. The star at 10 pc might be detectable depending on exact sensitivity limits. The stars at 50 pc and 200 pc are likely too faint.

Thus, 3 stars are detectable for sure: Canopus, Polaris, and the star at 5 pc.
