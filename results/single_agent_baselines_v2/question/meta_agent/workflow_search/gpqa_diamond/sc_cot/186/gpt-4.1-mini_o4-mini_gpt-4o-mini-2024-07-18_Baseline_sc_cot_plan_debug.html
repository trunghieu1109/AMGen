    <pre>To determine which stars are detectable with ESPRESSO (single 8 m UT, HR mode, R≈140 000) in 1 h exposure at S/N≥10, note its limiting magnitude is about V≈16.5. 

Compute apparent magnitudes:
 a) Canopus V≈–0.7 → detectable
 b) Polaris V≈2.0 → detectable
 c) Mv=15 at 10 pc → m=15+5 log(10/10)=15 → detectable
 d) Mv=15 at 200 pc → m=15+5 log(200/10)=≈21.5 → too faint
 e) Mv=15 at 5 pc → m=15+5 log(5/10)=≈13.5 → detectable
 f) Mv=15 at 50 pc → m=15+5 log(50/10)=≈18.5 → too faint

Thus detectable stars are a, b, c, e: total 4.
