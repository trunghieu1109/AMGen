Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 25tA', content='We need the order of substances 1–6 by increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer in their electrophilic bromination. Substituents 1 (CH₃) and 5 (C₂H₅) are activating ortho/para directors; 3 (Cl) is a deactivating ortho/para director; 2 (COOC₂H₅), 4 (NO₂), and 6 (COOH) are deactivating meta directors. Meta directors give very low para fractions, with the strongest deactivator (NO₂) giving the lowest para yield, then COOH, then COOR. Among ortho/para directors, stronger activation favors ortho more, so para fraction increases as activation strength decreases: C₂H₅ > CH₃ > Cl in para-yield. Thus overall para fractions increase in the order NO₂ (4) < COOH (6) < COOR (2) < CH₃ (1) < C₂H₅ (5) < Cl (3), corresponding to choice 4.\n\nAnswer:D)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
