Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To determine the order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer in electrophilic substitution reactions, we need to consider the directing effects of the substituents on the benzene ring. Activating groups like -CH3 and -C2H5 are ortho/para directing, while deactivating groups like -NO2, -COOH, and -COOC2H5 are meta directing. The stronger the deactivating effect, the lower the para-isomer yield. The order of deactivating ability is generally: -NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5 > -Cl. Therefore, the para-isomer yield will be lowest for nitrobenzene (4), followed by benzoic acid (6), ethyl benzoate (2), chlorobenzene (3), toluene (1), and ethylbenzene (5).
