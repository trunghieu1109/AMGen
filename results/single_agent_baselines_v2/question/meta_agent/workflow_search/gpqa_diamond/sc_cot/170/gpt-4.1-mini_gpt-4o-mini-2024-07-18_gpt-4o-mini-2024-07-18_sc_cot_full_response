Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent IrHm', content='To determine the order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer for the given substances undergoing electrophilic substitution with bromine, we need to consider the directing effects of the substituents on the benzene ring. Electron-donating groups (EDGs) favor substitution at the para position more than at the ortho position, while electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) can either direct to the meta position or reduce the overall reactivity. The order of substitution preference will be influenced by the nature of the substituents on the benzene ring. Therefore, I will analyze each substance to determine its effect on the formation of the para-isomer and then rank them accordingly.\n\nAnswer:4<6<2<1<5<3', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
