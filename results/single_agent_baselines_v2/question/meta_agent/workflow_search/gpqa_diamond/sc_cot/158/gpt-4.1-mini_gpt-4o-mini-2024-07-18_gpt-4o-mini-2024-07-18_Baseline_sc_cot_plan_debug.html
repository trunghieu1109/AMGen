    <pre>To determine the comoving distance of the quasar from Earth in a Lambda-CDM universe, we need to consider the parameters provided. The Hubble constant of 70 km/s/Mpc indicates the expansion rate of the universe. The matter density parameter (0.3) and dark energy density parameter (0.7) suggest that the universe is flat. In a flat universe, the scale factor at the present time (a=1) means we can directly relate the distance to the redshift of the quasar. The typical comoving distances for quasars can range from several Gpc, and given the peak wavelength of 790 nm in the near infrared, we can infer that this quasar is at a considerable distance. Among the choices provided, 8 Gpc is a reasonable estimate for the comoving distance of a quasar based on the given parameters.
