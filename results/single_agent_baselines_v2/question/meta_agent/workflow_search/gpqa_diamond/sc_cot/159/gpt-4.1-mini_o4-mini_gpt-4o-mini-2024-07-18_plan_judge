Question: Example(question='Consider an aperture, which shapes like a N-sided polygon. All the apothems are of the same length a. When a monochromatic light (of wavelength \\lambda), travelling along z-axis, falls vertically on this aperture, it creates a series of intensity maxima and minima in the far field region. What is the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large ? Assume that the related angles are small so that tan theta = theta approximation can be taken.', choice1='1.220 \\lambda /a ', choice2='0.610 \\lambda / a', choice3='0.500 \\lambda / a', choice4='0.506 \\lambda / a', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: As N→∞ the N‐sided polygon approaches a circular aperture of diameter D=2a. The minima occur at angles given by zeros of J1: first at 1.22λ/D, second at 2.233λ/D. The angular separation between these two minima is (2.233−1.22)λ/D≈1.01λ/D≈1.01λ/(2a)=0.505λ/a, i.e. ≈0.506λ/a.
