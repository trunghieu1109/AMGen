Question: Example(question='Consider an aperture, which shapes like a N-sided polygon. All the apothems are of the same length a. When a monochromatic light (of wavelength \\lambda), travelling along z-axis, falls vertically on this aperture, it creates a series of intensity maxima and minima in the far field region. What is the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large ? Assume that the related angles are small so that tan theta = theta approximation can be taken.', choice1='1.220 \\lambda /a ', choice2='0.610 \\lambda / a', choice3='0.500 \\lambda / a', choice4='0.506 \\lambda / a', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: As N approaches infinity, the N-sided polygon becomes a circular aperture. The angular distance between the first two minima in a circular aperture can be derived from the diffraction pattern produced by the aperture. For a circular aperture, the first minimum occurs at an angle given by the formula sin(theta) = 1.22 * (lambda / D), where D is the diameter of the aperture. In the case of a polygon with an apothem a, as N becomes very large, the diameter D can be approximated as D = 2a. Therefore, the angle for the first minimum becomes sin(theta) = 1.22 * (lambda / (2a)). The angular distance between the first two minima can then be calculated as the difference between the angles at which these minima occur. Given the small angle approximation, we can directly relate this to the wavelength and apothem. The value simplifies to 1.220 * lambda / a for the first two minima separation. Thus, the correct choice is the first one.
