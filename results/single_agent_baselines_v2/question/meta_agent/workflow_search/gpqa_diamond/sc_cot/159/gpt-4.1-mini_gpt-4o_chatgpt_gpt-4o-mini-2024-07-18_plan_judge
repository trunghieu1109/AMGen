Question: Example(question='Consider an aperture, which shapes like a N-sided polygon. All the apothems are of the same length a. When a monochromatic light (of wavelength \\lambda), travelling along z-axis, falls vertically on this aperture, it creates a series of intensity maxima and minima in the far field region. What is the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large ? Assume that the related angles are small so that tan theta = theta approximation can be taken.', choice1='1.220 \\lambda /a ', choice2='0.610 \\lambda / a', choice3='0.500 \\lambda / a', choice4='0.506 \\lambda / a', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: When N is infinitely large, the N-sided polygon approaches the shape of a circle. The apothem of the polygon becomes the radius of the circle. In the far-field diffraction pattern, the angular position of the minima for a circular aperture is given by the formula for a circular aperture: the first minimum occurs at an angle \( \theta = 1.22 \frac{\lambda}{D} \), where \( D \) is the diameter of the circular aperture. Since the apothem \( a \) is the radius, the diameter \( D = 2a \). Therefore, the angular position of the first minimum is \( \theta_1 = 1.22 \frac{\lambda}{2a} = 0.61 \frac{\lambda}{a} \). The angular distance between the first two minima in a circular aperture is the same as the angular position of the first minimum because the first minimum is the first angle where the intensity is zero, and the second minimum is the second angle where the intensity is zero, which is at twice the angle of the first minimum. Therefore, the angular distance between the first two minima is \( 0.61 \frac{\lambda}{a} \).
