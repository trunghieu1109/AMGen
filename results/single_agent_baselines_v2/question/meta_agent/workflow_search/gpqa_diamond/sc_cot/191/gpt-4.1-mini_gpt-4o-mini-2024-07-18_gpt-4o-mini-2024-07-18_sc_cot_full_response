Question: {'question': 'Imagine an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ having a small spherical cavity inside. The centre of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the centre of the spherical conductor. The radius of the cavity is $r$, and $r<R$.

Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 5Iw6', content='When a charge +q is placed inside the cavity of an uncharged spherical conductor, it induces a charge of -q on the inner surface of the conductor. The outer surface of the conductor will then have a charge of +q to maintain the overall neutrality of the conductor. The electric field outside the conductor behaves as if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the sphere due to the spherical symmetry. Therefore, at a point P outside the spherical conductor, the electric field can be calculated using the formula for the electric field due to a point charge. The distance from the center of the conductor to point P is L, and the field at point P is given by the formula E = k * q / L^2, where k = 1/(4πε₀). Thus, the correct choice is the one that represents this relationship.\n\nAnswer:C', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
