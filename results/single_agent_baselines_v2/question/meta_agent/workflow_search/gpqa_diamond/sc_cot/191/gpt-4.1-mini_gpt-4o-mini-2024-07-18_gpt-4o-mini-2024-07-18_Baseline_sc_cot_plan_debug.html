    <pre>When a charge +q is placed inside the cavity of an uncharged spherical conductor, it induces a charge of -q on the inner surface of the conductor. The outer surface of the conductor will then have a charge of +q to maintain the overall neutrality of the conductor. The electric field outside the conductor behaves as if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the sphere due to the spherical symmetry. Therefore, at a point P outside the spherical conductor, the electric field can be calculated using the formula for the electric field due to a point charge. The distance from the center of the conductor to point P is L, and the field at point P is given by the formula E = k * q / L^2, where k = 1/(4πε₀). Thus, the correct choice is the one that represents this relationship.
