proposed answer: To find the area of the pseudosphere given the metric, we need to derive the area formula from the provided metric. The metric indicates that the area element is affected by the factor \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}. We can set up the area integral over the region defined by the pseudosphere. Given the radius r=2, we will integrate over the appropriate bounds. The area of the pseudosphere can be computed, and we will check which of the provided choices matches our result.
