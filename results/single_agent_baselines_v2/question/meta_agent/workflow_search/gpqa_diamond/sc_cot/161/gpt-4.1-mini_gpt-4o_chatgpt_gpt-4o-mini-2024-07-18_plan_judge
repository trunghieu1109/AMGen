proposed answer: The given metric is ds^2 = \frac{32}{(4-x^2-y^2)}(dx^2 + dy^2). This is a metric on the Poincar√© disk model of hyperbolic geometry. The metric is conformally equivalent to the Euclidean metric, with a conformal factor \frac{32}{(4-x^2-y^2)}. The area element in this metric is dA = \frac{32}{(4-x^2-y^2)} dx dy. The region of integration for the pseudosphere of radius r=2 is the disk x^2 + y^2 < 4. Let's compute the area of this region.

We switch to polar coordinates, where x = r cos(\theta) and y = r sin(\theta). The area element becomes dA = \frac{32}{(4-r^2)} r dr d\theta. The limits for r are from 0 to 2, and for \theta from 0 to 2\pi.

The area is then given by:

\int_{0}^{2\pi} \int_{0}^{2} \frac{32}{(4-r^2)} r dr d\theta.

The inner integral with respect to r is:

\int_{0}^{2} \frac{32r}{(4-r^2)} dr.

Using the substitution u = 4 - r^2, du = -2r dr, we have:

\int \frac{32r}{(4-r^2)} dr = \int \frac{-16}{u} du = -16 \ln|u| + C = -16 \ln|4-r^2| + C.

Evaluating from r = 0 to r = 2 gives:

[-16 \ln|4-r^2|]_{0}^{2} = -16 \ln|4-4| + 16 \ln|4-0| = 0 + 16 \ln 4 = 16 \ln 4.

The outer integral with respect to \theta is trivial:

\int_{0}^{2\pi} 16 \ln 4 d\theta = 16 \ln 4 \cdot 2\pi = 32\pi \ln 4.

Thus, the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2 is 32\pi \ln 4, which does not match any of the given choices directly. However, we have made a mistake in the interpretation of the metric or the choices. Let's reconsider the choices.

The correct interpretation might be that the area is infinite, as the metric resembles that of a hyperbolic disk extending infinitely. Therefore, the correct choice is +\infty.
