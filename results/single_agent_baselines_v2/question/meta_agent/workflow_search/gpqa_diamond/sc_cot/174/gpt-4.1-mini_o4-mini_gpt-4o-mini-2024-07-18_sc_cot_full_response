Question: {'question': 'Consider an oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis). Because it oscillates, it would radiate at a wavelength \\lambda. In the radiation zone, the radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of \\lambda and the angle \\theta (with z-axis), along which the power is measured. If the maximum power thus radiated is A, the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle \\theta = 30^0 and a possible form of f are, respectively,', 'choice1': '1/2, \\lambda^(-4)', 'choice2': '3/4, \\lambda^(-6)', 'choice3': '1/4, \\lambda^(-4)', 'choice4': '1/4, \\lambda^(-3)'}\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent VWWJ', content='The oscillating spheroidal charge distribution has no net dipole moment, so the leading radiation is quadrupolar.  A simple axisymmetric quadrupole radiation pattern varies as sin^2θ\u2009cos^2θ, which peaks at θ=45° with value ∝1/4.  At θ=30°, sin^2θ\u2009cos^2θ=(1/4)(3/4)=3/16, so the fraction of the maximum is (3/16)/(1/4)=3/4.  Quadrupole power scales as ω^6∝λ^(–6).  Hence the correct choice is choice2 (fraction=3/4, λ^(–6)).\n\nAnswer:B)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
