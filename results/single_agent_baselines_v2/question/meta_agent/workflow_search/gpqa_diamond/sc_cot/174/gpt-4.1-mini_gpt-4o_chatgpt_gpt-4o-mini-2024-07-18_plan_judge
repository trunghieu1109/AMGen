Question: Example(question='Consider an oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis). Because it oscillates, it would radiate at a wavelength \\lambda. In the radiation zone, the radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of \\lambda and the angle \\theta (with z-axis), along which the power is measured. If the maximum power thus radiated is A, the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle \\theta = 30^0 and a possible form of f are, respectively,', choice1='1/2, \\lambda^(-4)', choice2='3/4, \\lambda^(-6)', choice3='1/4, \\lambda^(-4)', choice4='1/4, \\lambda^(-3)', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: The problem involves a spheroidal oscillating charge distribution radiating electromagnetic waves. The power radiated per unit solid angle depends on the angle \( \theta \) and the wavelength \( \lambda \). The maximum power radiated is A. For a dipole radiation pattern, the power per unit solid angle is proportional to \( \sin^2(\theta) \). At \( \theta = 30^\circ \), the fraction of maximum power is \( \sin^2(30^\circ) = (1/2)^2 = 1/4 \). Therefore, the fraction of A radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) is 1/4. The power radiated by a dipole is proportional to \( \lambda^{-4} \). Thus, the possible form of f is \( \lambda^{-4} \).
