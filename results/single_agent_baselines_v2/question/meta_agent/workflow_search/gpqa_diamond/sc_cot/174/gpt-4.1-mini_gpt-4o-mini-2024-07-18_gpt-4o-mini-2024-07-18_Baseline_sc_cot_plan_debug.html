    <pre>To determine the fraction of the maximum power A that will be radiated at an angle \theta = 30^0, we need to analyze the provided options for the function f. The function f represents the dependence of the radiated power per unit solid angle on the angle and wavelength. We have to find the correct fraction and its corresponding form. The options are given with different fractions and dependencies on \lambda. We need to match the correct fraction with its form based on the context of radiation from an oscillating charge distribution.
