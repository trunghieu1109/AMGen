Question: Example(question='Consider an oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis). Because it oscillates, it would radiate at a wavelength \\lambda. In the radiation zone, the radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of \\lambda and the angle \\theta (with z-axis), along which the power is measured. If the maximum power thus radiated is A, the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle \\theta = 30^0 and a possible form of f are, respectively,', choice1='1/2, \\lambda^(-4)', choice2='3/4, \\lambda^(-6)', choice3='1/4, \\lambda^(-4)', choice4='1/4, \\lambda^(-3)', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The oscillating spheroidal charge distribution has no net dipole moment, so the leading radiation is quadrupolar.  A simple axisymmetric quadrupole radiation pattern varies as sin^2θ cos^2θ, which peaks at θ=45° with value ∝1/4.  At θ=30°, sin^2θ cos^2θ=(1/4)(3/4)=3/16, so the fraction of the maximum is (3/16)/(1/4)=3/4.  Quadrupole power scales as ω^6∝λ^(–6).  Hence the correct choice is choice2 (fraction=3/4, λ^(–6)).
