Question: Example(question='Consider an oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis). Because it oscillates, it would radiate at a wavelength \\lambda. In the radiation zone, the radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of \\lambda and the angle \\theta (with z-axis), along which the power is measured. If the maximum power thus radiated is A, the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle \\theta = 30^0 and a possible form of f are, respectively,', choice1='1/2, \\lambda^(-4)', choice2='3/4, \\lambda^(-6)', choice3='1/4, \\lambda^(-4)', choice4='1/4, \\lambda^(-3)', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To determine the fraction of the maximum power A that will be radiated at an angle \theta = 30^0, we need to analyze the provided options for the function f. The function f represents the dependence of the radiated power per unit solid angle on the angle and wavelength. We have to find the correct fraction and its corresponding form. The options are given with different fractions and dependencies on \lambda. We need to match the correct fraction with its form based on the context of radiation from an oscillating charge distribution.

Answer:1/4, \lambda^(-4)
Extracted answer: 1/4, \lambda^(-4)
