Question: Example(question='What is the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product obtained when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess of HI?', choice1='1', choice2='3', choice3='0', choice4='5', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product obtained from the reaction of 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid with red phosphorus and excess HI, we need to analyze the structure of the starting compound and consider the effects of the reaction. The reaction with HI typically leads to the addition of hydrogen and the removal of double bonds or rings, potentially increasing the saturation of the molecule. The IHD can be calculated using the formula IHD = (2C + 2 + N - H - X)/2, where C is the number of carbons, N is the number of nitrogens, H is the number of hydrogens, and X is the number of halogens. After analyzing the structure and the expected changes upon reaction, we can determine the IHD of the final product.
