Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent MCjL', content='The molecule 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid has 5 degrees of unsaturation: 1 ring + 1 ring C=C + 1 vinyl C=C + 1 aldehyde C=O + 1 carboxyl C=O. Under HI/red P, both C=O groups are reduced to CH2 (removing 2 DU) while the ring double bond and vinyl remain intact. The ring itself remains, so DU = 5 â€“ 2 = 3.\n\nAnswer:B)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
