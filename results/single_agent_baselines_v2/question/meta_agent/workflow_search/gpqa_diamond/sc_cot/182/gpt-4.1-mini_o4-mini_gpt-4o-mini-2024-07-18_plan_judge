Question: Example(question='What is the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product obtained when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess of HI?', choice1='1', choice2='3', choice3='0', choice4='5', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The molecule 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid has 5 degrees of unsaturation: 1 ring + 1 ring C=C + 1 vinyl C=C + 1 aldehyde C=O + 1 carboxyl C=O. Under HI/red P, both C=O groups are reduced to CH2 (removing 2 DU) while the ring double bond and vinyl remain intact. The ring itself remains, so DU = 5 â€“ 2 = 3.
