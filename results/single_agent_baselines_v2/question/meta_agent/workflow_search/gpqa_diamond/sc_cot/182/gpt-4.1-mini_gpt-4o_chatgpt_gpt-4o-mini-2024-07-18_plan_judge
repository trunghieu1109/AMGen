Question: Example(question='What is the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product obtained when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess of HI?', choice1='1', choice2='3', choice3='0', choice4='5', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) is calculated based on the number of rings and multiple bonds. The original compound, 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, has a cyclohexene ring (1 ring, 1 double bond), a formyl group (1 double bond), and a vinyl group (1 double bond), giving an IHD of 3. When reacted with red phosphorus and excess HI, the compound is fully reduced to a saturated cyclohexane derivative, removing all double bonds and unsaturations. The product is a fully saturated cyclohexane with no double bonds or rings, resulting in an IHD of 0.
