proposed answer: First, we need to determine the mass dimensions of each component in the interaction term \( \mathcal{L}_{int} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu} \). The mass dimension of the Lagrangian density \( \mathcal{L} \) is 4. The field \( \psi \) is a Dirac field, which has mass dimension \( \frac{3}{2} \). Therefore, \( \bar{\psi} \) also has mass dimension \( \frac{3}{2} \). The field strength tensor \( F^{\mu\nu} \) has mass dimension 2. The \( \sigma_{\mu\nu} \) is a combination of gamma matrices, which are dimensionless. Therefore, the mass dimension of the term \( \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu} \) is \( \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} + 2 = 5 \). To make the total mass dimension of \( \mathcal{L}_{int} \) equal to 4, \( \kappa \) must have mass dimension \( 4 - 5 = -1 \). A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimension, so this theory is not renormalizable since \( \kappa \) has negative mass dimension.
