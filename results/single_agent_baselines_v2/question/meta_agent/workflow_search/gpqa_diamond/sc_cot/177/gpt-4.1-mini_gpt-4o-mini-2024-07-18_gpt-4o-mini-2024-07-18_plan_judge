proposed answer: To determine the mass dimension of \kappa in the given interaction Lagrangian, we need to analyze the dimensions of the other components involved. The fields \psi are typically fermionic fields which have mass dimension 3/2 in 4-dimensional spacetime. The tensor \sigma_{\mu\nu} is a dimensionless quantity since it is constructed from the gamma matrices which also have mass dimension 0. The field strength tensor F^{\mu\nu} has mass dimension 2. Therefore, the overall mass dimension of the interaction term \mathcal{L}_{int} must be 4, as it is a Lagrangian density. We can express this as follows: \left[\mathcal{L}_{int}\right]_{M} = \left[\kappa\right]_{M} + 3 + 0 + 2 = 4. Solving for \left[\kappa\right]_{M} gives us \left[\kappa\right]_{M} = -1. Regarding renormalizability, since the interaction is dimension -1, it suggests that the theory is not renormalizable, as interactions with negative mass dimensions typically lead to non-renormalizable theories. Thus, the correct choice is that the mass dimension of \kappa is -1 and the theory is not renormalizable.

Answer:The mass dimension \left[\kappa\right]_{M}=-1. The theory is not renormalizable.
