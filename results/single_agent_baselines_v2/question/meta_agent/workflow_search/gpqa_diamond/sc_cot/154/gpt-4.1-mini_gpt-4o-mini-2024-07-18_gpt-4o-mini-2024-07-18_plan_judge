Question: Example(question='Imagine an operator $\\vec{P}$ of a system have components $P_x, P_y$ and $P_z$. The matrix form of the  operator $P_x$ has components in the first row as $(0, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,\\hbar/\\sqrt{2},0)$.  The matrix form of the  operator $P_y$ has components in the first row as $(0, -i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0, -i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2},0)$. Similarly, matrix form of the  operator $P_z$ has components in the first row as $(\\hbar, 0, 0)$, that in the second row as $(0, 0, 0)$ and that in the third row as $(0,0, -\\hbar)$. The basis vectors here are the eigenvectors of $P_z$. The system is found in the eigenstate of $P_x$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$. To be more specific, the explicit form of the state of the system is given by the column vector having elements $(-1/2, 1/\\sqrt{2}, -1/2)$. What is the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z $ of $P_z$', choice1='\\hbar\n', choice2='\\hbar/2', choice3='\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}\n', choice4='\\sqrt{2}\\hbar', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: To find the uncertainty \Delta P_z of the operator P_z, we need to calculate the expectation value \langle P_z \rangle and the expectation value of the square \langle P_z^2 \rangle. The uncertainty is given by the formula \Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}. First, we compute \langle P_z \rangle using the given state vector and the matrix form of P_z. Then we compute \langle P_z^2 \rangle. After finding these values, we can calculate the uncertainty.

Answer:The uncertainty \Delta P_z of P_z is \hbar/2.
Extracted answer: The uncertainty \Delta P_z of P_z is \hbar/2.
