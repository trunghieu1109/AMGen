Question: Example(question='Imagine an operator $\\vec{P}$ of a system have components $P_x, P_y$ and $P_z$. The matrix form of the  operator $P_x$ has components in the first row as $(0, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,\\hbar/\\sqrt{2},0)$.  The matrix form of the  operator $P_y$ has components in the first row as $(0, -i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0, -i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2},0)$. Similarly, matrix form of the  operator $P_z$ has components in the first row as $(\\hbar, 0, 0)$, that in the second row as $(0, 0, 0)$ and that in the third row as $(0,0, -\\hbar)$. The basis vectors here are the eigenvectors of $P_z$. The system is found in the eigenstate of $P_x$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$. To be more specific, the explicit form of the state of the system is given by the column vector having elements $(-1/2, 1/\\sqrt{2}, -1/2)$. What is the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z $ of $P_z$', choice1='\\hbar\n', choice2='\\hbar/2', choice3='\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}\n', choice4='\\sqrt{2}\\hbar', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: To find the uncertainty \( \Delta P_z \) of the operator \( P_z \), we need to calculate the standard deviation of the observable \( P_z \) in the given state. The uncertainty is given by \( \Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle \psi | P_z^2 | \psi \rangle - \langle \psi | P_z | \psi \rangle^2} \). First, we calculate \( \langle \psi | P_z | \psi \rangle \) using the given state \( |\psi\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\ 1/\sqrt{2} \\ -1/2 \end{pmatrix} \) and the matrix form of \( P_z \). Then, we calculate \( \langle \psi | P_z^2 | \psi \rangle \) by applying \( P_z^2 \) to the state and taking the inner product. Finally, we compute the uncertainty.
