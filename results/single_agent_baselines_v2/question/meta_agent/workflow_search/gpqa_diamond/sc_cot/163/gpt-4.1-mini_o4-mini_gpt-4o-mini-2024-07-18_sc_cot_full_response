Question: {'question': 'Astronomers are studying two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2. Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.', 'choice1': '~ 0.4', 'choice2': '~ 0.7', 'choice3': '~ 0.6\n', 'choice4': '~ 1.2'}\Pattern: sc_cot
