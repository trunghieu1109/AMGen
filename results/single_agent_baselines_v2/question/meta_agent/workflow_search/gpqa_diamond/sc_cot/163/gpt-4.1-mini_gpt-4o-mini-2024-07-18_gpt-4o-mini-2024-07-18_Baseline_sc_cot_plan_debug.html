    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Astronomers are studying two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2. Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;~ 0.4&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;~ 0.7&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;~ 0.6\n&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;~ 1.2&#39;}

    <pre>To compare the masses of system_1 and system_2, we can use the mass function derived from the radial velocity amplitudes and the orbital periods of the binary systems. The mass function (for a binary star system) relates the masses of the stars to the amplitudes of their radial velocity curves and the period of the orbit. The formula is: M_total = (K1 + K2)^3 / (2Ï€G) * (P / (K1 * K2)), where K1 and K2 are the radial velocity amplitudes, P is the period, and G is the gravitational constant. We can calculate the mass ratios based on the given amplitudes and periods. After calculating the ratios, we can determine by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2.

Answer:The factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2 is approximately ~ 0.6.</pre>
