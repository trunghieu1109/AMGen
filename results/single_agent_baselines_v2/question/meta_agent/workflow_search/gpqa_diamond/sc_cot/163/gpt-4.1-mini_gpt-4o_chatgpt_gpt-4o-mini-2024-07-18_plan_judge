Question: Example(question='Astronomers are studying two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2. Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.', choice1='~ 0.4', choice2='~ 0.7', choice3='~ 0.6\n', choice4='~ 1.2', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To compare the masses of the two binary star systems, we can use Kepler's third law and the radial velocity amplitudes. The period of system_1 is 2 years, and the period of system_2 is 1 year. The radial velocity amplitudes are 10 km/s and 5 km/s for system_1, and 15 km/s and 10 km/s for system_2. Since the period of system_1 is twice that of system_2, and the velocity amplitudes are smaller, system_1 is likely less massive than system_2. We can calculate the mass ratio by considering the ratio of the products of period squared and velocity cubed for each system. The factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2 is approximately 0.4.
