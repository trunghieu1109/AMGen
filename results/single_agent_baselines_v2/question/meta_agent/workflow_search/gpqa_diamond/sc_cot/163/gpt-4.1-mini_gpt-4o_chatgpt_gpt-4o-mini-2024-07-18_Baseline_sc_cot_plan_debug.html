    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Astronomers are studying two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2. Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;~ 0.4&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;~ 0.7&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;~ 0.6\n&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;~ 1.2&#39;}

    <pre>To compare the masses of the two binary star systems, we can use Kepler&#39;s third law and the radial velocity amplitudes. The period of system_1 is 2 years, and the period of system_2 is 1 year. The radial velocity amplitudes are 10 km/s and 5 km/s for system_1, and 15 km/s and 10 km/s for system_2. Since the period of system_1 is twice that of system_2, and the velocity amplitudes are smaller, system_1 is likely less massive than system_2. We can calculate the mass ratio by considering the ratio of the products of period squared and velocity cubed for each system. The factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2 is approximately 0.4.
