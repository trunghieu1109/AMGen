Question: Example(question='Astronomers are observing a planet with a radius of 1 Earth radius in a circular orbit, with a transit impact parameter of 0.2, around a star that has a radius 1.5 times that of the Sun. This planet has an orbital period of 3 days. What is the maximum orbital period of a second planet, with a radius of 2.5 times that of Earth, in the same system that will exhibit both transit and occultation events? Assume that the second planet also has a circular orbit and shares the same orbital plane as the previously mentioned transiting planet.', choice1='~ 7.5', choice2='~ 33.5', choice3='~ 37.5', choice4='~ 12.5', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: To determine the maximum orbital period of the second planet that will exhibit both transit and occultation events, we need to consider the geometry of the orbits. Both planets are in the same orbital plane, and the first planet has a transit impact parameter of 0.2. This means it is slightly off center during its transit. The maximum impact parameter for a transit to occur is 1, but for an occultation (secondary eclipse) to occur, the planet must pass behind the star, which means its impact parameter must be less than the sum of the star's radius and the planet's radius divided by the semi-major axis. The second planet is larger, so its maximum allowable impact parameter for occultation is smaller. We calculate the semi-major axis of the first planet using Kepler's third law, then find the maximum semi-major axis for the second planet that still allows both transits and occultations, and finally use Kepler's third law again to find the corresponding maximum orbital period for the second planet.
