Question: Example(question='Astronomers are observing a planet with a radius of 1 Earth radius in a circular orbit, with a transit impact parameter of 0.2, around a star that has a radius 1.5 times that of the Sun. This planet has an orbital period of 3 days. What is the maximum orbital period of a second planet, with a radius of 2.5 times that of Earth, in the same system that will exhibit both transit and occultation events? Assume that the second planet also has a circular orbit and shares the same orbital plane as the previously mentioned transiting planet.', choice1='~ 7.5', choice2='~ 33.5', choice3='~ 37.5', choice4='~ 12.5', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: We need the maximum orbital period of a second planet that will both transit (inferior conjunction) and be occulted (superior conjunction). For a circular, edge-on orbit, the condition for both transit and occultation is (a/R⋆)cos i ≤1. From the known first planet: P1=3 d, R⋆=1.5 R⊙≈0.006976 AU, and assuming M⋆≈M⊙, Kepler’s law gives a1/R⋆≈5.86. Its impact parameter b=(a1/R⋆)cos i=0.2 ⇒ cos i≈0.03413. Thus for the second planet (same i): (a2/R⋆)≤1/cos i≈29.29 ⇒ a2≤29.29 R⋆≈0.2045 AU. Then P2≈a2^{3/2} (in years) ≈0.09247 yr ≈33.8 d, matching choice ~33.5.
