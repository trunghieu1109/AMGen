Question: Example(question='α-β unsaturated carbonyls have a much more electrophilic carbon double bond. These double bonds act as a good Lewis acid and react with nucleophiles to produce enolate ions. In this case, when a nucleophile attacks the β position, it produces a resonance-stabilized intermediate. When a nucleophile attacking the β-carbon is enolate, such reaction is known as the Michael reaction.\nWhat are the reactants and major final products of the following Michael addition reactions?\ndimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) -->(A)\n1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H3O+) --> (B)\nC + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H2O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice1='A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice2='A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice3='A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice4='A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: To solve the problem, we need to analyze each of the Michael addition reactions given and determine the products. 

For reaction (A):
- The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate with a base (NaOEt, EtOH). 
- Dimethyl malonate will form an enolate ion under basic conditions, which will attack the beta-position of the unsaturated ester, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate.
- The product will be trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate after the Michael addition and subsequent esterification.

For reaction (B):
- The reactants are 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine and (E)-but-2-enenitrile with methanol and acid (H3O+).
- The enamine 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine will tautomerize to form an enamine, which will then attack the beta-position of (E)-but-2-enenitrile.
- The product will be 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile after the Michael addition and subsequent tautomerization.

For reaction (C):
- The reactants are compound C and but-3-en-2-one with a base (KOH, H2O).
- Compound C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione, which will form an enolate that attacks the beta-position of but-3-en-2-one.
- The product will be 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione after the Michael addition.

Comparing the results with the given choices, choice 1 matches the products we determined.
