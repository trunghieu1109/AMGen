Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent TwPR', content='Heisenberg uncertainty: Δx Δp ≥ ħ/2 => Δp ≈ ħ/(2 Δx) = 1.055e-34 J·s/(2×1e-10 m) ≈5.3e-25 kg·m/s. Then Δv = Δp/m_e ≈5.3e-25/9.11e-31 ≈5.8e5 m/s. Energy uncertainty ΔE ≈ m_e v Δv ≈9.11e-31 kg×2e8 m/s×5.8e5 m/s ≈1.06e-16 J, so about 10^(-16) J.\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
