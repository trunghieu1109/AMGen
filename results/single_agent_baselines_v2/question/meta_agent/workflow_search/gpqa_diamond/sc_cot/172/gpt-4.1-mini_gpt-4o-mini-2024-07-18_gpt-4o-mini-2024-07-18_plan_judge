Question: Example(question="If uncertainty in space of electron's location, which is travelling with speed v= 2* 10^8 m/s along x-direction is Δx=0.1 nm . Based on the infromation estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of electron.", choice1='~10^(-19) J', choice2='~10^(-18) J', choice3='~10^(-16) J', choice4='~10^(-17) J', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To estimate the minimum uncertainty in energy ΔE of an electron, we can use the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which states that Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where Δp is the uncertainty in momentum and ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. The momentum p of the electron is given by p = mv, where m is the mass of the electron and v is its velocity. The uncertainty in momentum Δp can be related to the uncertainty in energy ΔE using the relation ΔE = v * Δp. First, we calculate Δp using the given Δx and then find ΔE.
