Question: Example(question='In an inactive state, a transcription factor subunit awaits an activation signal from the membrane phosphorylation cascade. Upon phosphorylation on the Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, shuttles into the nucleus, and serves in gene transcription. A missense mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. You observe that a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Which of the following molecular phenotypes is most likely observed in the presence of mutation Y?', choice1='loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype', choice2='protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype', choice3='protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele', choice4='change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The question describes two mutations affecting a transcription factor. Mutation X is a recessive loss-of-function mutation in the transactivation domain, while mutation Y is a heterozygous dominant-negative mutation in the dimerization domain. A dominant-negative mutation typically interferes with the function of the wild-type protein, leading to a loss-of-function phenotype. Given that mutation Y is in the dimerization domain, it is likely to prevent the proper dimerization of the transcription factor, which is essential for its function. This would lead to a situation where the presence of mutation Y results in a loss of function of the wild-type allele due to disrupted dimerization. Therefore, the most likely molecular phenotype observed in the presence of mutation Y is 'protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele'.
