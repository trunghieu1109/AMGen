Question: Example(question='In an inactive state, a transcription factor subunit awaits an activation signal from the membrane phosphorylation cascade. Upon phosphorylation on the Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, shuttles into the nucleus, and serves in gene transcription. A missense mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. You observe that a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Which of the following molecular phenotypes is most likely observed in the presence of mutation Y?', choice1='loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype', choice2='protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype', choice3='protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele', choice4='change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The question describes a transcription factor subunit that normally dimerizes upon activation. A heterozygous mutation in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative, meaning the mutant subunit interferes with the function of the wild-type subunit. Dominant-negative mutations often involve the mutant protein binding to the wild-type partner to form nonfunctional complexes or aggregates, thereby reducing overall activity even in the presence of one normal allele. Choice 2 describes protein aggregation and a loss-of-function phenotype, which matches the expected dominant-negative mechanism.
