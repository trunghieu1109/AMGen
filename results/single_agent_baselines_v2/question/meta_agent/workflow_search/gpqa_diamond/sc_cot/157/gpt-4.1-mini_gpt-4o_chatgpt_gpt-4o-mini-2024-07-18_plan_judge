Question: Example(question='In an inactive state, a transcription factor subunit awaits an activation signal from the membrane phosphorylation cascade. Upon phosphorylation on the Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, shuttles into the nucleus, and serves in gene transcription. A missense mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. You observe that a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Which of the following molecular phenotypes is most likely observed in the presence of mutation Y?', choice1='loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype', choice2='protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype', choice3='protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele', choice4='change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To solve this problem, we need to understand the effects of the mutations described. Mutation Y is in the dimerization domain and is a dominant-negative mutation. This means that even in the presence of a wild-type allele, mutation Y can interfere with the function of the wild-type protein. Typically, dominant-negative mutations often result in a loss-of-function phenotype because the mutant protein interferes with the normal function of the wild-type protein. In the context of dimerization, a dominant-negative mutation might prevent proper dimer formation or cause improper dimer formation, leading to a loss of function. The choices include various outcomes such as loss of dimerization, aggregation, degradation, and change of conformation. Given that mutation Y is dominant-negative and affects the dimerization domain, it is likely to cause a loss of function through interference with dimerization. This aligns with choice 2, where protein aggregation (due to improper dimerization) leads to a loss-of-function phenotype.
