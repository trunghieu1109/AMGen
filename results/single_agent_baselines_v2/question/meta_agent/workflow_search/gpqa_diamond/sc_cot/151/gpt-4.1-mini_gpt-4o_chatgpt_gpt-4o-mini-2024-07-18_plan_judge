Question: Example(question='You identified a new quorum-sensing peptide in the bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus. You are highly interested if its role in intercellular communication is conserved among the eukaryotes. You treat yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with the peptide and interestingly observe the formation of the shmoo. You want to learn about the proteome of the active chromatin in the shmoo and recover it by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. The least of proteins from which complex below will you observe in your assay?', choice1='pre-initiation complex', choice2='pre-replication complex', choice3='enhancer protein complex', choice4='nucleosome histone complex', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The task involves understanding which protein complex is least likely to be observed in the proteome of active chromatin in the shmoo of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The shmoo formation is related to mating and involves changes in gene expression, which requires transcriptional activation. The pre-initiation complex is involved in transcription initiation, the enhancer protein complex is also involved in transcription regulation, and the nucleosome histone complex is part of the chromatin structure. The pre-replication complex, however, is involved in DNA replication, not transcription. Since the focus is on active chromatin related to transcription, the pre-replication complex proteins are least likely to be observed.
