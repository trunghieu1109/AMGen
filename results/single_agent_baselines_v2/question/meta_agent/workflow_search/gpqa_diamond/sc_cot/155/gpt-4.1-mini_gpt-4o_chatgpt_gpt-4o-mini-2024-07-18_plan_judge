Question: Example(question='A chemist performs two reactions:\n\nReaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. \n\nReaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.\n\nBoth reactions go to 100% completion. The chemist combines the products of both reactions, and then runs the product mixture on both a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column and a chiral HPLC column.\n\nAssuming that the chromatographic resolution is as high as theoretically possible in both cases, what does the chemist observe in each of these chromatograms?', choice1='4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', choice2='3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice3='2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice4='2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: First, let's analyze the reactions. Reaction 1 involves (E)-oct-4-ene treated with mCPBA, which forms an epoxide, and then with aqueous acid, which leads to diol formation. The (E)-alkene gives a trans-diol. Reaction 2 involves (Z)-oct-4-ene, which similarly forms an epoxide and then a diol, but the (Z)-alkene gives a cis-diol. Both reactions are stereospecific, and the diols formed are enantiomers. In the standard HPLC, which is achiral, enantiomers are not distinguished, so we will see two peaks corresponding to the trans and cis diols. In the chiral HPLC, enantiomers are resolved, so we will see four peaks: two for the enantiomers of the trans-diol and two for the enantiomers of the cis-diol.

Answer:2 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC
Extracted answer: 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC
Correct answer: 3
