Question: Example(question='A chemist performs two reactions:\n\nReaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. \n\nReaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.\n\nBoth reactions go to 100% completion. The chemist combines the products of both reactions, and then runs the product mixture on both a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column and a chiral HPLC column.\n\nAssuming that the chromatographic resolution is as high as theoretically possible in both cases, what does the chemist observe in each of these chromatograms?', choice1='4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', choice2='3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice3='2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice4='2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: In Reaction 1, (E)-oct-4-ene undergoes epoxidation with mCPBA to form an epoxide, which, upon treatment with acid, opens to form a diol. Similarly, in Reaction 2, (Z)-oct-4-ene also forms a diol through the same mechanism. The products from (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene are diastereomers, which means they will have different physical properties. In a standard HPLC, which does not distinguish between enantiomers or diastereomers, both diols will be detected as separate peaks. However, in a chiral HPLC, the diastereomers will also be separated, and if the diols are chiral (which they are, since they are formed from chiral starting materials), they will show additional peaks corresponding to the enantiomers of each diastereomer. Therefore, in standard HPLC, there will be 2 peaks (one for each diol), and in chiral HPLC, there will be 4 peaks (two for each diastereomer, as each can exist as two enantiomers).

Answer:3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC
Extracted answer: 3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC
Correct answer: 3
