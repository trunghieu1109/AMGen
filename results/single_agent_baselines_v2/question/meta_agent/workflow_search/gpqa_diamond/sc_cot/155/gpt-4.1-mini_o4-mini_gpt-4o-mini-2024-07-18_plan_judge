Question: Example(question='A chemist performs two reactions:\n\nReaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. \n\nReaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.\n\nBoth reactions go to 100% completion. The chemist combines the products of both reactions, and then runs the product mixture on both a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column and a chiral HPLC column.\n\nAssuming that the chromatographic resolution is as high as theoretically possible in both cases, what does the chemist observe in each of these chromatograms?', choice1='4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', choice2='3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice3='2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice4='2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: We need to predict the diol products after epoxidation (syn) of E- and Z-oct-4-ene followed by acidic hydrolysis (anti opening). Overall this is anti dihydroxylation. Anti addition to a trans (E) alkene gives the meso diol (achiral), anti addition to a cis (Z) alkene gives a racemic pair of enantiomeric diols. Combined mixture: one meso diol + two enantiomers. On an achiral column enantiomers coelute → 2 peaks (meso + racemate). On a chiral column enantiomers separate → 3 peaks (meso + two enantiomers).
