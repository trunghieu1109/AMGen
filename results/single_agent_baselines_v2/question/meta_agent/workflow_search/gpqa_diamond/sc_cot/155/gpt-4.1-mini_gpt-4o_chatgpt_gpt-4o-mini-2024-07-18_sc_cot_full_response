Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 2cpG', content="First, let's analyze the reactions. Reaction 1 involves (E)-oct-4-ene treated with mCPBA, which forms an epoxide, and then with aqueous acid, which leads to diol formation. The (E)-alkene gives a trans-diol. Reaction 2 involves (Z)-oct-4-ene, which similarly forms an epoxide and then a diol, but the (Z)-alkene gives a cis-diol. Both reactions are stereospecific, and the diols formed are enantiomers. In the standard HPLC, which is achiral, enantiomers are not distinguished, so we will see two peaks corresponding to the trans and cis diols. In the chiral HPLC, enantiomers are resolved, so we will see four peaks: two for the enantiomers of the trans-diol and two for the enantiomers of the cis-diol.\n\nAnswer:2 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC", prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
