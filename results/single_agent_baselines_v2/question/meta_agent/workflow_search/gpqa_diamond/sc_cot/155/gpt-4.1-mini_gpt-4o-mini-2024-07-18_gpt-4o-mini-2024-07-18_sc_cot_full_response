Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent DQVo', content='In Reaction 1, (E)-oct-4-ene undergoes epoxidation with mCPBA to form an epoxide, which, upon treatment with acid, opens to form a diol. Similarly, in Reaction 2, (Z)-oct-4-ene also forms a diol through the same mechanism. The products from (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene are diastereomers, which means they will have different physical properties. In a standard HPLC, which does not distinguish between enantiomers or diastereomers, both diols will be detected as separate peaks. However, in a chiral HPLC, the diastereomers will also be separated, and if the diols are chiral (which they are, since they are formed from chiral starting materials), they will show additional peaks corresponding to the enantiomers of each diastereomer. Therefore, in standard HPLC, there will be 2 peaks (one for each diol), and in chiral HPLC, there will be 4 peaks (two for each diastereomer, as each can exist as two enantiomers).\n\nAnswer:3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
