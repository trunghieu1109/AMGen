Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 56D6', content='To determine which particle is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry, we need to consider the nature of each particle. A magnon is a quasiparticle associated with the collective excitations in a system with broken spin rotational symmetry, typical in magnets. A skyrmion is a topological soliton that can arise in certain field theories and is related to broken symmetries in those contexts. A pion is a particle associated with spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in quantum chromodynamics. A phonon is a quasiparticle representing quantized sound or vibrational energy in a crystal lattice, related to broken translational symmetry. However, phonons are typically associated with lattice vibrations and not directly with a spontaneously-broken symmetry in the same sense as the others. Therefore, the particle not typically associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry in the same context is the phonon.\n\nAnswer:D)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
