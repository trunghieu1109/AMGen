Question: Example(question='Which of the following (effective) particles is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry?', choice1='Magnon', choice2='Skyrmion', choice3='Pion', choice4='Phonon', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: We examine each candidate: 1) Magnon is the Goldstone boson of spontaneously broken spin-rotation symmetry in magnetic systems. 2) Skyrmion is a topological soliton solution, not itself a Goldstone mode from symmetry breaking. 3) Pion is a pseudo-Goldstone boson from spontaneously broken chiral symmetry in QCD. 4) Phonon is the Goldstone boson of broken continuous translational symmetry in crystals. Thus the only one not arising from a spontaneously broken symmetry is the skyrmion.
