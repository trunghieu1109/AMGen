Question: Example(question='Which of the following (effective) particles is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry?', choice1='Magnon', choice2='Skyrmion', choice3='Pion', choice4='Phonon', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To determine which particle is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry, we need to analyze the nature of each particle listed. Magnons and Skyrmions are typically associated with systems that exhibit spontaneous symmetry breaking. Pions are also associated with the breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics. Phonons, however, are quantized modes of vibrations in a crystal lattice and do not necessarily arise from a spontaneously-broken symmetry. Therefore, the correct answer is Phonon.
