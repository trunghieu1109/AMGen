Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 56D6', content='We examine each candidate: 1) Magnon is the Goldstone boson of spontaneously broken spin-rotation symmetry in magnetic systems. 2) Skyrmion is a topological soliton solution, not itself a Goldstone mode from symmetry breaking. 3) Pion is a pseudo-Goldstone boson from spontaneously broken chiral symmetry in QCD. 4) Phonon is the Goldstone boson of broken continuous translational symmetry in crystals. Thus the only one not arising from a spontaneously broken symmetry is the skyrmion.\n\nAnswer:B)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
