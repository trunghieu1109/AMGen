Question: Example(question='Astronomers are interested in the luminosities of two stars. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2. The mass of Star_1 is also larger by the same factor (1.5 times). Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same. Astronomers also calculated the radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:', choice1='~2.25', choice2='~2.35', choice3='~2.32', choice4='~2.23\n', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To determine the luminosity of the stars, we can use the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the luminosity (L) of a black body is proportional to the surface area (A) and the fourth power of the temperature (T): L = A * σ * T^4, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The surface area of a star is given by A = 4 * π * R^2, where R is the radius of the star. Given that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2, we can express the surface areas as A1 = 4 * π * (1.5 * R2)^2 and A2 = 4 * π * R2^2. This leads to A1 = 4 * π * 2.25 * R2^2 = 2.25 * A2. Since the temperatures of the stars are the same (as they appear brightest at the same wavelengths), we can compare their luminosities. Thus, L1/L2 = A1/A2 = 2.25. Therefore, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of approximately 2.25.
