Question: {'question': 'Astronomers are interested in the luminosities of two stars. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2. The mass of Star_1 is also larger by the same factor (1.5 times). Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same. Astronomers also calculated the radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:', 'choice1': '~2.25', 'choice2': '~2.35', 'choice3': '~2.32', 'choice4': '~2.23\n'}\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent Dt0q', content='We want L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 (T1/T2)^4. Given R1/R2=1.5 so (R1/R2)^2=2.25. Spectroscopy shows observed λmax the same, but Star2 has radial velocity 700 km/s, so its intrinsic λmax shifted by factor (1+v/c). Thus T2/T1 = λ1/λ2 = 1/(1+v/c), so T1/T2 = 1+v/c ≈1+0.002333=1.002333. Then L1/L2 =2.25/(1.002333)^4 ≈2.25/1.009366 ≈2.23.\n\nAnswer:D)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
