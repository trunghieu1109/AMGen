Question: Example(question='You are studying a nuclear decay which converts two heavy nucleons of flavor A to another flavor B, while simultaneously emitting two much lighter particles E and V. In short, 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V. It is known that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous, with some endpoint value Q.\n\nA variant of this decay emits one exotic, massless particle M instead of the 2V. In this case, how does the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles compare to that of the original decay?', choice1='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint increases.', choice2='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases.', choice3='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.', choice4='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint decreases.', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: In the original decay, the emission of two particles V contributes to the energy distribution of the outgoing particles E. When one exotic, massless particle M is emitted instead of the two V particles, the energy conservation and the degrees of freedom for the outgoing particles E change. The massless particle M allows for a different distribution of energy among the outgoing particles E, leading to a modification of the energy spectrum. Specifically, since M is massless, it can carry away energy without contributing to the mass, which would allow E particles to have a different energy distribution. Given that the total energy must still be conserved, the shape of the spectrum is likely to be continuous but adjusted due to the presence of the massless particle. The endpoint is also likely to decrease because the massless particle M does not contribute to the mass balance in the same way as the two V particles did, thus allowing for less energy to be available for the E particles. Therefore, the most appropriate choice is that the spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases.
