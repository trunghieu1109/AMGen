Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 1pvS', content='In the original decay 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V, the energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous because the two neutrinos (2V) can carry away varying amounts of energy, leading to a continuous distribution of energy among the E particles. The endpoint of this spectrum is the maximum energy the E particles can have, which is Q.\n\nIn the variant decay 2A -> 2B + 2E + M, the exotic massless particle M replaces the 2 neutrinos. Since M is massless and there is only one such particle, the kinematics are different. The energy spectrum of the E particles will still be continuous because M can carry away any amount of energy, but the presence of only one massless particle instead of two neutrinos means that the maximum energy available to the E particles might be different. However, since M is massless, it is likely that the total energy available to E is reduced, as M might carry away a fixed amount of energy, decreasing the endpoint energy available to the E particles. Therefore, the spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases.\n\nAnswer:B)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
