Question: Example(question='You are studying a nuclear decay which converts two heavy nucleons of flavor A to another flavor B, while simultaneously emitting two much lighter particles E and V. In short, 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V. It is known that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous, with some endpoint value Q.\n\nA variant of this decay emits one exotic, massless particle M instead of the 2V. In this case, how does the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles compare to that of the original decay?', choice1='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint increases.', choice2='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases.', choice3='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.', choice4='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint decreases.', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: In the original decay 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V, the energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous because the two neutrinos (2V) can carry away varying amounts of energy, leading to a continuous distribution of energy among the E particles. The endpoint of this spectrum is the maximum energy the E particles can have, which is Q.

In the variant decay 2A -> 2B + 2E + M, the exotic massless particle M replaces the 2 neutrinos. Since M is massless and there is only one such particle, the kinematics are different. The energy spectrum of the E particles will still be continuous because M can carry away any amount of energy, but the presence of only one massless particle instead of two neutrinos means that the maximum energy available to the E particles might be different. However, since M is massless, it is likely that the total energy available to E is reduced, as M might carry away a fixed amount of energy, decreasing the endpoint energy available to the E particles. Therefore, the spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases.
