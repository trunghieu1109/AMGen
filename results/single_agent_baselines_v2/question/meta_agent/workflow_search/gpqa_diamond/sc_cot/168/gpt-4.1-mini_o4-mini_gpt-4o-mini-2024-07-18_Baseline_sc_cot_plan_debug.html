    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;You are studying a nuclear decay which converts two heavy nucleons of flavor A to another flavor B, while simultaneously emitting two much lighter particles E and V. In short, 2A -&gt; 2B + 2E + 2V. It is known that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous, with some endpoint value Q.\n\nA variant of this decay emits one exotic, massless particle M instead of the 2V. In this case, how does the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles compare to that of the original decay?&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint increases.&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases.&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint decreases.&#39;}

    <pre>The original 2νββ (2A→2B+2e+2ν) is a 4-body decay with a continuous summed-electron spectrum up to Q. Replacing the two neutrinos with one massless Majoron M gives a 3-body final state (2e+M), which still yields a continuous summed electron spectrum, but the phase‐space/kernels differ so the spectral shape is altered.  Because the original neutrinos had tiny nonzero mass, the new Majoron is strictly massless, allowing the electrons to carry off slightly more energy at maximum (the endpoint shifts up by the small amount 2m_ν), so the endpoint increases slightly.
