Question: Example(question='Two stars are being studied. It has been observed that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2. In fact, the energy difference between the considered energy levels was determined to be approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J. Assuming that the stellar photospheres are in LTE, which of these equations for the effective temperatures of the stars (T_1 and T_2) is correct?', choice1='ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]\n', choice2='ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]\n', choice3='ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n', choice4='ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: Under LTE the excitation follows the Boltzmann factor: n_j/n_i ∝ exp(−ΔE/(kT)). The observed ratio 2 = [exp(−ΔE/(kT₁))]/[exp(−ΔE/(kT₂))] = exp[ΔE/k·(1/T₂−1/T₁)]. Taking ln gives ln2 = (ΔE/k)·(1/T₂−1/T₁). Ignoring the constant prefactor for form, 1/T₂−1/T₁ = (T₁−T₂)/(T₁T₂). Thus ln2 = (T₁−T₂)/(T₁T₂), which is choice 4.
