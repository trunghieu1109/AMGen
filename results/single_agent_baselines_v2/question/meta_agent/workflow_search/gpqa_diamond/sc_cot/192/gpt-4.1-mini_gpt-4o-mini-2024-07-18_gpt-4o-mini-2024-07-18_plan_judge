Question: Example(question='In a specific region of the sky, astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?', choice1='~ r^2', choice2='~ r^4', choice3='~ r^3', choice4='~ r^5', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The parallax (plx) is inversely related to the distance (r) of the star, specifically, plx = 1/r. Given that the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5, we can substitute plx with 1/r to get the relationship in terms of distance. Thus, the number of stars N varies as N ~ 1/(1/r)^5 = r^5. Therefore, the number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance.
