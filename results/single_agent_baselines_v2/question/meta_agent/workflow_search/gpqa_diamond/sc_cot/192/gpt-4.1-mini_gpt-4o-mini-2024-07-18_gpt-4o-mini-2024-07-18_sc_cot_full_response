Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent oaG6', content='The parallax (plx) is inversely related to the distance (r) of the star, specifically, plx = 1/r. Given that the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5, we can substitute plx with 1/r to get the relationship in terms of distance. Thus, the number of stars N varies as N ~ 1/(1/r)^5 = r^5. Therefore, the number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance.\n\nAnswer:D', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
