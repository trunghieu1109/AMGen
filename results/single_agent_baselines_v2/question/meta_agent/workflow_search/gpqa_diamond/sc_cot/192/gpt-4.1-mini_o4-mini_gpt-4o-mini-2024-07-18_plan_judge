Question: Example(question='In a specific region of the sky, astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?', choice1='~ r^2', choice2='~ r^4', choice3='~ r^3', choice4='~ r^5', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: Given N(p) ∝ 1/p^5 and p ∝ 1/r, so dp/dr = -1/r^2. The number per unit distance is N(r) = N(p)·|dp/dr| ∝ (1/p^5)·(1/r^2). Substituting p=1/r gives ∝ r^5·1/r^2 = r^3.
