One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators. Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.

    <pre>To solve this question, we need to evaluate the statements regarding the use of a dual catalyst system for ethylene polymerization to introduce regular branches. The goal is to form high-density polyethylene with regular branching using only ethylene as the monomer. Let&#39;s analyze each statement:

1. &#39;Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.&#39; - This statement is likely true, as there are industrial processes that use dual catalyst systems for producing polyethylene with specific properties.

2. &#39;Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.&#39; - This statement suggests that aluminum-based activators are not suitable for the branching step. However, in many catalyst systems, aluminum-based compounds (like MAO) are used as activators, so this statement might be incorrect.

3. &#39;One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.&#39; - Group VIa transition metals (such as chromium) are used in some polymerization catalysts, but they are not typically associated with introducing regular branches. This statement might be misleading.

4. &#39;Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.&#39; - Noble metal catalysts can be used for polymerization, but they are indeed expensive. This statement is likely correct.

Based on this analysis, the most correct statement regarding the formation of a polymer with regular branches using a dual catalyst system is choice 1, as it reflects the reality of industrial practices.
