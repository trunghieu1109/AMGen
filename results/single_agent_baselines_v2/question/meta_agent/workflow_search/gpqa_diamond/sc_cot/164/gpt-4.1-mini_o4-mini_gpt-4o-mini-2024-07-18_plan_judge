Question: Example(question='In an industrial research lab, a scientist performs ethylene polymerization with a homogeneous organometallic catalyst system, generating a polymer of high density. He intends to add a second catalyst system to introduce regular branches in the polymer backbone, also only using ethylene as the reactant. He consults a senior scientist, who gives the following statements. “Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US. One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators. Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step. Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.”\nWhich of these four statements is correct regarding the formation of a polymer with regular branches using only ethylene as the monomer and a dual catalyst system?', choice1='Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.', choice2='Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.', choice3='One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.', choice4='Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: We evaluate each statement:1) No industrial dual-catalyst process using only ethylene for regular branching is commercial; 2) Aluminum activators do work for many steps, so this is false; 3) Group VIa metals are not used for ethylene polymerization to introduce branches; 4) Noble-metal catalysts (e.g. Pd, Rh) can indeed produce branched polyethylenes from ethylene alone but are too costly for large scale. Thus statement 4 is correct.
