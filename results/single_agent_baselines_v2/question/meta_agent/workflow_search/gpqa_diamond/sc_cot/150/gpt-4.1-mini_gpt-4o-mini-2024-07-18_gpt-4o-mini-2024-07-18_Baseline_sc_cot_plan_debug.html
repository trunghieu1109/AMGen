    <pre>To find the probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0, we need to calculate the projection of the state vector onto the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 of the operator P. The state vector is given as (-1, 2, 1) and the observable matrix P has the specified elements. We will calculate the projection of the state onto the eigenvector associated with the eigenvalue 0 and then use that to compute the probability. The eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 can be determined from the operator P, and the probability is given by the square of the norm of the projection of the state vector onto this eigenvector. After performing the calculations, we find that the probability is 1/3.
