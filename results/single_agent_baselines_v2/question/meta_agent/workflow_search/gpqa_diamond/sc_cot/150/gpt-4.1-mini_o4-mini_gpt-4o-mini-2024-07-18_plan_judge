Question: Example(question='The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1). An observable of the system is represented by the matrix operator P having elements in the first row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0),  in the second row as (1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}) and in the third row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0). Calculate the probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 at time t.', choice1='1/3\n', choice2='2/3\n', choice3='\\sqrt{2/3}\n', choice4='1', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: We need the projector onto the eigenvalue 0 subspace of P. The eigenvalues of P are 1, –1, and 0, with the normalized eigenvector for 0 being v0 = (1/√2, 0, –1/√2). The initial state ψ = (–1, 2, 1) has norm √6, so the normalized state is ψ/√6. The overlap is ⟨v0|ψ⟩ = (1/√2)(–1/√6) + (–1/√2)(1/√6) = –2/(2√3) = –1/√3, so the probability is |–1/√3|^2 = 1/3.
