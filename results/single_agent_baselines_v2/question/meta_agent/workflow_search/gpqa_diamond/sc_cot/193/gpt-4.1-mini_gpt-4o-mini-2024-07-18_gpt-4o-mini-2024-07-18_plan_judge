Question: Example(question='Consider a system of three spins S1, S2 and S3. Each of which can take spin +1 and -1. The energy of the system is given by, E= -J[ S1S2 +S1S3+S2S3 ].\nFind the partition function Z of the system. (\\beta = 1/kT , k= boltzmann constant and T= temperature)', choice1='Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)', choice2='Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)', choice3='Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)', choice4='Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To find the partition function Z of the system, we need to consider the possible configurations of the three spins S1, S2, and S3. Each spin can take values +1 or -1, leading to 2^3 = 8 possible configurations. We then calculate the energy E for each configuration using the formula E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. After calculating the energies, we can find the partition function Z by summing e^(-Î²E) for each configuration. The correct choice will be the one that matches our calculated partition function.

Answer:Z= 2 e^(3J\beta)+6e^(-J\beta)
Extracted answer: Z= 2 e^(3J\beta)+6e^(-J\beta)
Correct answer: 1
