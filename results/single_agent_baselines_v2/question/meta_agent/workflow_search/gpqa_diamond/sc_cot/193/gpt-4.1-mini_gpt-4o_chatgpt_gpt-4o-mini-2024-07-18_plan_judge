Question: Example(question='Consider a system of three spins S1, S2 and S3. Each of which can take spin +1 and -1. The energy of the system is given by, E= -J[ S1S2 +S1S3+S2S3 ].\nFind the partition function Z of the system. (\\beta = 1/kT , k= boltzmann constant and T= temperature)', choice1='Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)', choice2='Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)', choice3='Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)', choice4='Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To find the partition function Z, we need to sum over all possible states of the system, each weighted by the Boltzmann factor e^(-beta * E). There are 2^3 = 8 possible configurations for the spins S1, S2, and S3, since each spin can be +1 or -1. We calculate the energy for each configuration using E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3] and then compute the corresponding Boltzmann factor e^(-beta * E). Finally, we sum these factors to get the partition function Z.
