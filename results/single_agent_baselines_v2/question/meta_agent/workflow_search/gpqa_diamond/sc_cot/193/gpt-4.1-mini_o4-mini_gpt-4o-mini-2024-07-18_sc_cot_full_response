Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent UBFY', content='We have 3 spins with energy E= -J(S1S2+S1S3+S2S3). There are 8 configurations. All aligned (2 states) give S1S2+S1S3+S2S3=3, so E= -3J, contributing 2e^{3Jβ}. The other 6 mixed-spin states give sum = -1, so E= +J, contributing 6e^{-Jβ}. Hence Z=2e^{3Jβ}+6e^{-Jβ}, which is choice A.\n\nAnswer:A)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
