Question: Example(question='There has been an outbreak of an viral infectious disease in your city. You have been asked to design a molecular diagnostic kit for quick detection of this retrovirus. How would you go about designing this kit?', choice1='First you identify the virus by performing DNA sequencing. You then develop a PCR kit for  quick and accurate diagnosis', choice2='First you identify the IgG antibodies for the infection. You then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG antibodies for quick \n and accurate diagnosis.', choice3='First you identify the virus using the information about the symptoms, provided by the affected patients. You then design a nested PCR kit based on the information for quick diagnosis.', choice4='First you identify the virus by performing cDNA sequencing.  You then develop a real time PCR kit for quick and accurate diagnosis.', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: To design a molecular diagnostic kit for a retrovirus, it's important to consider the nature of retroviruses. Retroviruses have RNA genomes, so the appropriate strategy would involve converting the RNA to DNA (cDNA) and then designing a PCR-based diagnostic. DNA sequencing alone would not be useful for a retrovirus unless it is preceded by reverse transcription. Antibody-based methods like ELISA would not be as direct or rapid for detecting the presence of the virus itself compared to PCR. Identifying the virus based solely on symptoms is not reliable for designing a molecular diagnostic kit. Therefore, the most appropriate approach is to perform cDNA sequencing to identify the viral genome and then develop a real-time PCR kit for detection.
