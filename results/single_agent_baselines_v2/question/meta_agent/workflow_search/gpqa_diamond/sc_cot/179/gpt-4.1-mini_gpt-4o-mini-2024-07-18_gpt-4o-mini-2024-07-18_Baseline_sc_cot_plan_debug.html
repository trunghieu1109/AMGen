    <pre>To find the minimum energy of the system, we need to calculate the potential energy between the 12 charges constrained at a distance of 2 m from point P and the charge fixed at P. The potential energy U between two point charges is given by the formula U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb&#39;s constant (approximately 8.99 x 10^9 N m²/C²), q1 and q2 are the charges, and r is the distance between them. In this case, each of the 12 charges has a charge of 2e, where e is the elementary charge (approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 C). Therefore, the charge of each particle is 2 * 1.602 x 10^-19 C. The total energy will be the sum of the potential energies of all pairs of charges, but we can simplify the calculation since all charges are identical and symmetrically placed. There are 12 charges at 2 m from point P and they all interact with the charge at P. We will calculate the energy for one charge interacting with the fixed charge and then multiply by the number of charges. The potential energy for one charge at distance 2 m from charge at P will be U = k * (2e * 2e) / 2 = k * (4e^2) / 2 = 2k * e^2 / 2. The total energy for 12 such charges will be 12 times this value. We will then compute the numerical values to find the final answer.
