Question: Example(question='Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are\nconstrained to stay at 2 m from a point P.

Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: We have 13 identical charges q = 2e. One is fixed at the center P; the other 12 lie on the surface of a sphere of radius R = 2 m. The total electrostatic potential energy is
U = k Σ_{i<j} q_i q_j / r_{ij} = k q^2 Σ_{i<j} 1/r_{ij}.
Here all charges are equal, so q^2 = (2e)^2 = 4 e^2. The sum over pairs splits into two parts:
(1) Interactions between the central charge and each of the 12 outer charges: each distance is R, so Σ_center = 12*(1/R) = 12*(1/2) = 6 (in units of 1/m).
(2) Interactions among the 12 charges on the sphere: the minimal arrangement is an icosahedron. There are C(12,2)=66 pairs, of which 30 edges at distance d1, 30 next-nearest pairs at distance d2, and 6 diametrically opposite pairs at distance d3 = 2R. For an icosahedron inscribed in radius R, one finds numerically for R = 2 m
 d1 = 1.05146*R = 2.1029 m,
 d2 = 1.7013*R = 3.4026 m,
 d3 = 2R = 4 m.
Hence Σ_outer = 30*(1/d1) + 30*(1/d2) + 6*(1/d3)
           ≈ 30*0.4755 + 30*0.2938 + 6*0.25
           ≈ 14.265 + 8.813 + 1.5 = 24.578 (in 1/m).
Thus total Σ_{i<j}1/r_{ij} = Σ_center + Σ_outer = 6 + 24.578 = 30.578 (m⁻¹).
Finally U = k * (4 e^2) * 30.578 = 4 * (k e^2) * 30.578.
Using k e^2 ≈ 2.3069×10^(-28) J·m, we get
 U ≈ 4 * 30.578 * 2.3069×10^(-28) J ≈ 2.8219×10^(-26) J,
which to three significant figures is 2.822×10^(-26) J.
