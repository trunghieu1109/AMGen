proposed answer: To calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) using the relative entropy measure for the given Schrödinger cat state, we need to follow these steps: 1. Calculate the normalization constant N using the given formula. 2. Construct the density matrix rho for the Schrödinger cat state |psi>. 3. Determine the reference Gaussian state tau, which is typically the closest Gaussian state to |psi>. 4. Compute the relative entropy del_b = [trace(rho* ln(rho))-trace(tau* ln(tau))]. 5. Substitute the given values phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5 into the formulas and calculate the result.
