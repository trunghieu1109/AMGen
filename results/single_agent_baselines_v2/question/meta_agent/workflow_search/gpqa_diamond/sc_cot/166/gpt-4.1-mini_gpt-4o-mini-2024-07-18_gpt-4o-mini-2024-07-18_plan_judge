Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) of the given Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure, we need to evaluate the density matrices for the non-Gaussian state and the reference Gaussian state, and then apply the formula for relative entropy. The parameters given are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. After performing the calculations, we find that the non-Gaussianity value corresponds to one of the provided choices.
