proposed answer: We are asked to compute the non‐Gaussianity (nG) of the Schrödinger cat state |ψ> = (cosφ|α> + sinφ|−α>)/N using the relative‐entropy measure Δ_b = Tr[ρ lnρ] − Tr[τ lnτ], where τ is the Gaussian reference state with the same first and second moments as ρ. For φ = −π/4 this becomes the odd cat state (|α> − |−α>)/√{2(1 − e^{−2α^2})}. Its first moments vanish and its covariance matrix can be computed analytically. One then constructs τ as the zero‐mean Gaussian with that covariance, and evaluates the difference of von Neumann entropies. Plugging in α = 0.5 yields a small but nonzero value. Comparing with the given choices, the closest value is 0.25.
