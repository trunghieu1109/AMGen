Question: Example(question='The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1), and the operators of two observables P and Q of the system are represented by two square matrices. The matrix corresponding to operator P has the elements in first row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0), elements in the second row as (1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}) and that in third row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0). The matrix operator for Q is represented by the square matrix having elements in the first row as (1, 0, 0), second row as (0, 0, 0) and third row as (0, 0, -1). Now, if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P, what is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements?', choice1='1/2', choice2='1/6', choice3='1/3', choice4='2/3', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To find the probability of obtaining specific measurement outcomes for observables P and Q, we first need to determine the eigenstates and eigenvalues of the operators represented by the matrices. The matrix for operator P is given, and we can compute its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. We will also compute the probability of measuring the state after the measurement of P. After that, we will compute the probability of measuring Q. The final probability will be the product of the probabilities from both measurements.
