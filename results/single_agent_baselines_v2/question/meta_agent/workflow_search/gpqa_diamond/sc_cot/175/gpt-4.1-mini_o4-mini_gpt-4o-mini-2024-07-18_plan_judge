Question: Example(question='The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1), and the operators of two observables P and Q of the system are represented by two square matrices. The matrix corresponding to operator P has the elements in first row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0), elements in the second row as (1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}) and that in third row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0). The matrix operator for Q is represented by the square matrix having elements in the first row as (1, 0, 0), second row as (0, 0, 0) and third row as (0, 0, -1). Now, if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P, what is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements?', choice1='1/2', choice2='1/6', choice3='1/3', choice4='2/3', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: We have the initial (unnormalized) state ψ = (–1,2,1), normalization ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = 6. Operator P has eigenvalues 1,0,–1; the eigenvector for eigenvalue 0 is v₀ ∝ (1,0,–1), normalized v₀ = (1/√2,0,–1/√2). The probability to get P=0 is |⟨v₀|ψ⟩|²/⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = |(1/√2)(-1)+(0)(2)+(–1/√2)(1)|²/6 = (2)/6 = 1/3. After collapse to v₀, measure Q=–1 whose eigenvector is e₃=(0,0,1); probability = |⟨e₃|v₀⟩|² = (1/√2)² = 1/2. Joint probability = (1/3)*(1/2) = 1/6.
