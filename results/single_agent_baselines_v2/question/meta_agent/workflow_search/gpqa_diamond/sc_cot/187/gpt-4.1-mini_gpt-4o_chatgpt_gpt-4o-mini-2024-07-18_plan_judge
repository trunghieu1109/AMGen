Question: Example(question='Consider a rhombohedral crystal, with the interatomic distance of 10 Angstrom and the angles $\\quad\\alpha=\\beta=\\gamma=30^{0}$. What is the interplanar distance of the (111) plane of the crystal?\n', choice1='9.54 Angstrom', choice2='8.95 Angstrom', choice3='9.08 Angstrom', choice4='10.05 Angstrom', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To find the interplanar distance of the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal, we use the formula for the interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral lattice: d_{hkl} = (a / sqrt(h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + kl + hl)cos(alpha))) * sqrt(1 + 2cos(alpha) / (1 - 3cos^2(alpha))). For the (111) plane, h = k = l = 1, and we are given a = 10 Angstrom and alpha = 30 degrees. Cos(30 degrees) = sqrt(3)/2. Plug these into the formula to find the interplanar distance.
