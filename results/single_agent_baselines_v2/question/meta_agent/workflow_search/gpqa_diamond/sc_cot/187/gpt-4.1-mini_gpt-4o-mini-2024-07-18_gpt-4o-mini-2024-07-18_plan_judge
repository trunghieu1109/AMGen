Question: Example(question='Consider a rhombohedral crystal, with the interatomic distance of 10 Angstrom and the angles $\\quad\\alpha=\\beta=\\gamma=30^{0}$. What is the interplanar distance of the (111) plane of the crystal?\n', choice1='9.54 Angstrom', choice2='8.95 Angstrom', choice3='9.08 Angstrom', choice4='10.05 Angstrom', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To find the interplanar distance of the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal, we can use the formula for interplanar spacing d_hkl in a rhombohedral lattice given by: d_hkl = (a / sqrt(h^2 + k^2 + l^2)) * sqrt(1 + cos(α)cos(β)cos(γ) - cos^2(α) - cos^2(β) - cos^2(γ)). Here, a is the interatomic distance, h, k, l are the Miller indices (1, 1, 1 for the (111) plane), and α, β, γ are the angles of the lattice. We are given that a = 10 Å, and α = β = γ = 30°. First, we need to calculate cos(30°) which is √3/2. Then we can substitute these values into the formula to find the interplanar distance d_111.
