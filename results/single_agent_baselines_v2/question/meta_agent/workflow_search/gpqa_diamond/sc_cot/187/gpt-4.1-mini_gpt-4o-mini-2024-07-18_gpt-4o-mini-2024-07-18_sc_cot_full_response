Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent J7wM', content='To find the interplanar distance of the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal, we can use the formula for interplanar spacing d_hkl in a rhombohedral lattice given by: d_hkl = (a / sqrt(h^2 + k^2 + l^2)) * sqrt(1 + cos(α)cos(β)cos(γ) - cos^2(α) - cos^2(β) - cos^2(γ)). Here, a is the interatomic distance, h, k, l are the Miller indices (1, 1, 1 for the (111) plane), and α, β, γ are the angles of the lattice. We are given that a = 10 Å, and α = β = γ = 30°. First, we need to calculate cos(30°) which is √3/2. Then we can substitute these values into the formula to find the interplanar distance d_111.\n\nAnswer:9.08 Angstrom', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
