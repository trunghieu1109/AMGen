Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent J7wM', content='To find the interplanar distance of the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal, we use the formula for the interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral lattice: d_{hkl} = (a / sqrt(h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + kl + hl)cos(alpha))) * sqrt(1 + 2cos(alpha) / (1 - 3cos^2(alpha))). For the (111) plane, h = k = l = 1, and we are given a = 10 Angstrom and alpha = 30 degrees. Cos(30 degrees) = sqrt(3)/2. Plug these into the formula to find the interplanar distance.\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
