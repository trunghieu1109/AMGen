Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent xWMy', content='We need to find v_max for a relativistic mass-spring oscillator. Energy conservation: total energy E = γmc^2 + ½kx^2 (potential). At turning points x=±A, speed zero so E = mc^2 + ½kA^2. At x=0, potential =0 so E = γ_max mc^2. Thus γ_max = 1 + (kA^2)/(2mc^2). Then v_max = c√[1–1/γ_max^2] = c√[1–1/(1 + kA^2/(2mc^2))^2]. For small kA^2/(2mc^2) this reduces to A√(k/m), and v_max<c. Choice B matches.\n\nAnswer:B)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
