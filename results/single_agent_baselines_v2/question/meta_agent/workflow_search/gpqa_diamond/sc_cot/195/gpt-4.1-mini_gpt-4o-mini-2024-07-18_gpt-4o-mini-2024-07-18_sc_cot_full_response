Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 2cCZ', content='To find the maximum speed of a relativistic harmonic oscillator, we need to consider the relativistic effects and the relationship between the force, potential energy, and kinetic energy in the context of special relativity. The maximum speed can be derived from the energy considerations and the relativistic equations of motion. The choices provided represent different formulations, and we need to identify which one correctly represents the maximum speed in a relativistic context.\n\nAnswer:B', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
