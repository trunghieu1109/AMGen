Question: Example(question='What is the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product obtained when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess of HI?', choice1='1', choice2='3', choice3='0', choice4='5', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_1_182
proposed answer: All agents have calculated the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) for the product as 1. The product is a fully saturated cyclohexane with alkyl side chains, indicating no pi bonds and only one ring, which contributes to the IHD of 1. Among the given multiple-choice options (1, 3, 0, 5), the option that matches the calculated IHD of 1 is choice '1'. Therefore, the correct choice corresponding to the product's IHD is option A.
