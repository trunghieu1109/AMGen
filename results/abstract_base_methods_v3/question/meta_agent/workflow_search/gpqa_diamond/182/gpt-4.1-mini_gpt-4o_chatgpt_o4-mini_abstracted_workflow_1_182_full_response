The '2-formyl' group is an aldehyde, the '5-vinyl' group is an alkene, and 'cyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid' indicates a cyclohexene ring with a carboxylic acid group. The degree of unsaturation can be calculated by considering the double bonds and rings. The cyclohexene ring contributes one degree of unsaturation, the vinyl group contributes another, and the formyl group does not add any additional unsaturation beyond the carbonyl.

In this context, HI can reduce aldehydes and carboxylic acids to alkanes. The presence of excess HI suggests that the vinyl group and any double bonds in the cyclohexene ring will also be reduced. Red phosphorus acts as a catalyst, facilitating the reduction process. Therefore, the effect of red phosphorus and excess HI on 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is to reduce all the functional groups, including the aldehyde, carboxylic acid, and alkenes, to alkanes.

In this reaction, the HI will likely reduce the alkene and carbonyl groups, converting the aldehyde and carboxylic acid into alkanes. The cyclohexene ring will also be reduced to a cyclohexane ring. This results in the saturation of the molecule, removing all degrees of unsaturation.

In Sub-task 2, it was determined that red phosphorus and excess HI would reduce the compound by saturating the double bonds and reducing the carbonyl groups. This means the cyclohexene ring would become a cyclohexane ring, the vinyl group would be reduced to an ethyl group, and the aldehyde and carboxylic acid groups would be reduced to alkanes. The overall effect is the conversion of the compound into a fully saturated cyclohexane derivative, with no remaining double bonds or carbonyl groups.
