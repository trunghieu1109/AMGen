Question: Example(question='An equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 g was heated to 200°C without air. In this case, only a mixture of gases was formed, which, without cooling, was passed successively through tubes filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 (№1), Ca(OH)2 (№2) solution, and red-hot copper (№3). Results: the weights of tubes №1 and №3 increased by 3.60 g and 0.80 g, respectively (CuO formed in tube №3). The weight of the second tube has not changed. As a result, only 2.24 liters of gas C (standard temperature and pressure) remained.\nIndicate the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.', choice1='15', choice2='13', choice3='17', choice4='19', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: The problem involves an equimolar mixture of salts A and B that decomposes to form gases. From the sub-task answers, we know that 0.35 moles of gases were formed, consisting of 0.20 moles of H2O and 0.15 moles of O2. The weight increase in tube №1 indicates 0.20 moles of H2O were absorbed, and the weight increase in tube №3 indicates 0.05 moles of O2 reacted to form CuO, leaving 0.10 moles of O2 as gas C. The equimolar condition implies that salts A and B each contributed equally to the formation of these gases. H2O consists of 3 atoms (2 H and 1 O), and O2 consists of 2 atoms. Therefore, the total number of atoms in the gases is (0.20 moles * 3 atoms/mole) + (0.15 moles * 2 atoms/mole) = 0.60 + 0.30 = 0.90 moles of atoms. Since the salts were equimolar and decomposed completely, the total number of atoms in the original salts A and B must match the number of atoms in the gases formed. The closest choice to 0.90 moles of atoms, considering the options given, is 19 atoms. This suggests that the total number of atoms in salts A and B is 19. However, this calculation assumes that all atoms in the salts end up in the gaseous products, which may not account for other atoms present in the salts that do not form gases. The choice of 19 atoms is based on matching the calculated moles of atoms to the closest option provided.

proposed answer: The calculated total number of atoms in the original salts A and B is 30, as determined in the previous sub-task. The multiple-choice options provided are 15, 13, 17, and 19. None of these options match the calculated total of 30 atoms. Therefore, none of the given choices are correct based on the calculation.

Answer:None of the choices match the calculated total of 30 atoms.
