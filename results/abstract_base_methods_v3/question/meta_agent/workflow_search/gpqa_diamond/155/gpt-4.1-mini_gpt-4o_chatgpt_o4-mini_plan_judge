Question: Example(question='A chemist performs two reactions:\n\nReaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. \n\nReaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.\n\nBoth reactions go to 100% completion. The chemist combines the products of both reactions, and then runs the product mixture on both a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column and a chiral HPLC column.\n\nAssuming that the chromatographic resolution is as high as theoretically possible in both cases, what does the chemist observe in each of these chromatograms?', choice1='4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', choice2='3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice3='2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice4='2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: In sub-task 4, it was determined that on a standard (achiral) HPLC column, enantiomers co-elute, resulting in 1 peak for each pair of enantiomers. Since the combined product mixture contains two pairs of enantiomers: (2R,3S)/(2S,3R) and (2R,3R)/(2S,3S), there will be 2 peaks on the standard HPLC. In sub-task 5, it was determined that on a chiral HPLC column, each enantiomer is separated, resulting in 2 peaks for each pair of enantiomers. Therefore, with two pairs of enantiomers, there will be 4 peaks on the chiral HPLC. The correct choice is 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC.
