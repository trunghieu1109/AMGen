Question: Example(question='ChIP-seq on a PFA-fixed sample with an antibody to the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells followed by next-generation sequencing and standard quality control, alignment and peak-calling steps produced ChIP peaks that disappeared when PFA+DSG fixation was used. Where are we most likely to find such disappearing peaks?', choice1='At active promoters and enhancers', choice2='At repeats', choice3='In the introns of large genes', choice4='At random locations in the genome', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_39_13
proposed answer: The disappearing IKAROS peaks are most likely found at active promoters and enhancers. This conclusion is based on the understanding that IKAROS is a transcription factor that binds directly to DNA at regulatory regions such as promoters and enhancers. When using PFA fixation alone, these direct DNA-protein interactions are captured, resulting in ChIP peaks. However, when DSG is added, it introduces protein-protein crosslinking, which can obscure or eliminate these direct interactions, causing the peaks to disappear. Therefore, the peaks that disappear with PFA+DSG fixation are those at active promoters and enhancers, aligning with choice A).
