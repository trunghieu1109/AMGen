Since the peak wavelengths of both stars are the same, their temperatures must also be the same. Therefore, the surface temperatures of Star_1 and Star_2 are equal.; answer - The temperatures of both stars are equal because their peak wavelengths are the same, indicating equal surface temperatures according to Wien's displacement law.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - The problem states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2, and the mass of Star_1 is also 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2. Therefore, the radius ratio R1/R2 = 1.5 and the mass ratio M1/M2 = 1.5. These ratios are important for calculating the luminosity of the stars, as luminosity depends on the radius and temperature of the star. Since the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same, they have the same temperature. Thus, the luminosity ratio can be calculated using the formula L = 4\u03c0R^2\u03c3T^4, where R is the radius and T is the temperature. Since T is the same for both stars, the luminosity ratio L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 = 1.5^2 = 2.25.; answer - The radius and mass ratios between Star_1 and Star_2 are both 1.5, as given in the problem statement. These ratios are used in the luminosity calculations, confirming that Star_1 is 1.5 times larger in both radius and mass compared to Star_2.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - The luminosity of a star can be calculated using the formula L = 4\u03c0R^2\u03c3T^4, where R is the radius of the star, \u03c3 is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature of the star. Given that the peak wavelengths of both stars are the same, the temperatures of the two stars are equal according to Wien's displacement law. Therefore, the temperature term T^4 cancels out when calculating the luminosity ratio. The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 (R1/R2 = 1.5). Since the luminosity depends on the square of the radius, the luminosity ratio L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 = 1.5^2 = 2.25. Therefore, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of 2.25.; answer - ~2.25\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - The radial velocities of the stars affect the observed wavelengths of light due to the Doppler effect, which can cause a shift in the observed spectrum. However, the problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same, indicating that any Doppler shift has been accounted for or is negligible in this context. The luminosity of a star, as calculated using the black body radiation formula L = 4\u03c0R^2\u03c3T^4, depends on the intrinsic properties of the star such as its radius and temperature, not on its motion relative to the observer. Therefore, the radial velocities do not affect the intrinsic luminosity ratio calculation. The luminosity ratio is determined by the radius and temperature, and since the temperatures are equal and the radius ratio is given, the radial velocities can be neglected in this calculation.; answer - The radial velocities do not influence the luminosity ratio calculation and can be neglected under the assumption of black body radiation.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - The calculated luminosity ratio of Star_1 to Star_2 is 2.25, based on the given radius ratio and the assumption that both stars have the same temperature.

        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The relativistic Doppler shift formula is used to calculate the intrinsic wavelength of a star given its observed wavelength and radial velocity. For Star_1, with a radial velocity of 0 km/s, the intrinsic wavelength is the same as the observed wavelength. For Star_2, with a radial velocity of 700 km/s, we apply the formula: lambda_intrinsic = lambda_observed * sqrt((1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c)). Here, v = 700 km/s and c = 299792 km/s. Plugging in these values, we find the intrinsic wavelength for Star_2.; answer - The intrinsic peak wavelength of Star_1 is the same as the observed wavelength, while for Star_2, it is slightly shorter due to the Doppler effect, calculated using the given formula.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - Wien's displacement law relates the temperature of a black body to the peak wavelength of its emission spectrum. The formula T = b / lambda_intrinsic allows us to calculate the temperature, where b is Wien's displacement constant (approximately 2.897 x 10^-3 m*K). From Sub-task 1, we know that the intrinsic peak wavelength of Star_1 is the same as the observed wavelength, as its radial velocity is 0 km/s. For Star_2, the intrinsic wavelength is slightly shorter due to its radial velocity of 700 km/s, calculated using the relativistic Doppler shift formula. Applying Wien's law to these intrinsic wavelengths will give us the temperatures of the stars. Since the wavelengths are the same for both stars after Doppler correction, the temperatures will also be the same.; answer - The true surface temperatures of Star_1 and Star_2 are the same, as their intrinsic peak wavelengths are the same after Doppler correction.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - In Sub-task 2, we determined that the true surface temperatures of Star_1 and Star_2 are the same because their intrinsic peak wavelengths are the same after Doppler correction. This conclusion is consistent with the given data: both stars have the same observed peak wavelength, and the Doppler correction for Star_2 accounts for its radial velocity. The relativistic Doppler shift formula was correctly applied to find the intrinsic wavelength of Star_2, and since Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, its intrinsic wavelength is the same as the observed one. Wien's displacement law then gives the same temperature for both stars. The consistency check confirms that the temperatures are physically consistent with the stars' radial velocities and observed data. There are no overlooked assumptions or errors in this analysis, as the Doppler effect and Wien's law were correctly applied. The feedback from Critic Agent bfT6 also supports this conclusion, indicating that the analysis is correct and consistent with physical principles.; answer - The temperatures of Star_1 and Star_2 are consistent and correct, as both stars have the same intrinsic peak wavelength after Doppler correction, leading to the same temperature by Wien's law.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - The problem states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2, and the mass of Star_1 is also 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2. These ratios are given directly in the problem statement and are crucial for calculating the luminosity of the stars. The luminosity of a star, assuming it radiates as a black body, is proportional to the square of its radius and the fourth power of its temperature. Since the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same, their temperatures are the same. Therefore, the luminosity ratio depends only on the radius ratio. The radius ratio is 1.5, so the luminosity ratio is (1.5)^2 = 2.25. The mass ratio is not directly relevant to the luminosity calculation in this context.; answer - The radius and mass ratios between Star_1 and Star_2 are both 1.5 times larger for Star_1, as given in the problem statement.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - The luminosity of a star radiating as a black body is given by the formula L = 4\u03c0R^2\u03c3T^4, where R is the radius and T is the temperature. From Sub-task 3, we know that the temperatures of Star_1 and Star_2 are the same because their intrinsic peak wavelengths are the same. Therefore, the temperature term T^4 cancels out when calculating the luminosity ratio L1/L2. From Sub-task 4, we have that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times the radius of Star_2. The luminosity ratio L1/L2 is then determined by the square of the radius ratio, since L \u221d R^2. Thus, L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. This result is consistent with the problem statement and the calculations performed in the sub-tasks.; answer - ~2.25\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 6 output: thinking - Radial velocities affect the observed wavelengths of stars due to the Doppler effect, which shifts the observed wavelengths depending on the motion of the star relative to the observer. For Star_1, with a radial velocity of 0 km/s, the observed wavelength is the same as the intrinsic wavelength. For Star_2, with a radial velocity of 700 km/s, the observed wavelength is shifted, and we must apply the Doppler correction to find the intrinsic wavelength. The intrinsic wavelength is used to determine the temperature of the star via Wien's Law. However, once the intrinsic temperature is determined, the radial velocity does not affect the intrinsic luminosity calculation. Luminosity depends on the intrinsic temperature and radius of the star, not on the radial velocity. Therefore, after correcting for the Doppler effect to find the intrinsic temperature, radial velocities do not directly affect the intrinsic luminosity calculations.; answer - Radial velocities affect observed wavelengths due to the Doppler effect, but after correcting for this to find intrinsic temperatures, they do not directly affect intrinsic luminosity calculations.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 7 output: thinking - The calculated luminosity ratio from Subtask 5 is 2.25. The multiple-choice options provided are ~2.25, ~2.35, ~2.32, and ~2.23. The option ~2.25 is the closest match to the calculated value of 2.25.
