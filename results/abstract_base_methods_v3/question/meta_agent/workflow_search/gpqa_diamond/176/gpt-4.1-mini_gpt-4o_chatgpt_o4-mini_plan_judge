Question: Example(question='Astronomers are interested in the luminosities of two stars. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2. The mass of Star_1 is also larger by the same factor (1.5 times). Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same. Astronomers also calculated the radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:', choice1='~2.25', choice2='~2.35', choice3='~2.32', choice4='~2.23\n', correct_index=4)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_6_176
proposed answer: The calculated luminosity ratio of Star_1 to Star_2 is 2.25, based on the given radius ratio and the assumption that both stars have the same temperature. The formula used is L = 4πR^2σT^4, where the temperature term cancels out due to equality, leaving the ratio dependent solely on the square of the radius ratio, which is (1.5)^2 = 2.25. The provided multiple-choice options are ~2.25, ~2.35, ~2.32, and ~2.23. The calculated value of 2.25 matches exactly with the option ~2.25, making it the closest and most accurate choice. Therefore, the correct answer is A).

proposed answer: The calculated luminosity ratio from Subtask 5 is 2.25. The multiple-choice options provided are ~2.25, ~2.35, ~2.32, and ~2.23. The option ~2.25 is the closest match to the calculated value of 2.25. All debate agents agree that the calculated ratio aligns perfectly with option A) ~2.25, confirming it as the correct choice.
