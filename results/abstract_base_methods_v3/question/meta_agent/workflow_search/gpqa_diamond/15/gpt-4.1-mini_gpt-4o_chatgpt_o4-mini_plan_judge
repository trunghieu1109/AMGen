Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_15
proposed answer: All agents agree that three compounds exhibit optical activity: (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione, (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, and (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. These compounds have chiral centers and lack internal symmetry, which are necessary conditions for optical activity. The other compounds either lack chiral centers or have internal symmetry, making them not optically active. Therefore, the consensus is that the total number of optically active compounds is 3.

proposed answer: All four agents agree that there are three optically active compounds: (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione, (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, and (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. These compounds are optically active because they have chiral centers and lack internal planes of symmetry. The other compounds are either achiral or meso compounds with internal symmetry. Therefore, the total number of optically active compounds is 3.
