Question: Example(question='Astronomers are studying two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2. Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.', choice1='~ 0.4', choice2='~ 0.7', choice3='~ 0.6\n', choice4='~ 1.2', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_6_163
proposed answer: All agents agree that the calculated mass ratio factor from Sub-task 5 is approximately 0.6. The multiple-choice options provided are: choice1: ~0.4, choice2: ~0.7, choice3: ~0.6, and choice4: ~1.2. The closest match to the calculated factor of 0.6 is choice3: ~0.6. Therefore, the corresponding letter choice is C. All agents consistently selected C as the correct answer based on this reasoning.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_6_163
proposed answer: All agents have calculated the mass ratio factor to be approximately 0.4 using the given data and the approximate method. This value is closest to the multiple-choice option ~0.4. Therefore, the corresponding letter choice for this option is A). The consistent agreement among the agents and the alignment of the calculated value with the given options justify selecting A) as the final answer.
