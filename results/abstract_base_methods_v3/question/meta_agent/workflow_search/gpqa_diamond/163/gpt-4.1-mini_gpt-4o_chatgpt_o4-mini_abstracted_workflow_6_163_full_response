System_2: Orbital period = 1 year, Radial velocity amplitudes = 15 km/s, 10 km/s.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - To convert the orbital periods from years to seconds, we use the conversion factor that 1 year is approximately 31,536,000 seconds (365 days/year * 24 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour * 60 seconds/minute). Therefore, for system_1, the period in seconds is 2 years * 31,536,000 seconds/year = 63,072,000 seconds. For system_2, the period in seconds is 1 year * 31,536,000 seconds/year = 31,536,000 seconds. To convert the radial velocity amplitudes from km/s to m/s, we use the conversion factor that 1 km/s = 1000 m/s. Thus, for system_1, the radial velocity amplitudes are 10 km/s * 1000 m/s/km = 10,000 m/s and 5 km/s * 1000 m/s/km = 5,000 m/s. For system_2, the radial velocity amplitudes are 15 km/s * 1000 m/s/km = 15,000 m/s and 10 km/s * 1000 m/s/km = 10,000 m/s.

For system_1, the radial velocity amplitudes are 10,000 m/s and 5,000 m/s. Therefore, the sum of the radial velocity amplitudes for system_1 is 10,000 m/s + 5,000 m/s = 15,000 m/s. For system_2, the radial velocity amplitudes are 15,000 m/s and 10,000 m/s. Therefore, the sum of the radial velocity amplitudes for system_2 is 15,000 m/s + 10,000 m/s = 25,000 m/s.

The formula is M_total = (T * (K1 + K2)^3) / (2πG sin^3 i). For system_1, T = 2 years = 2 * 365.25 * 24 * 3600 seconds. The sum of the radial velocity amplitudes K1 + K2 = 15,000 m/s. G = 6.67430×10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2. Since i = 90°, sin i = 1. Plugging these values into the formula, we get M_total = (2 * 365.25 * 24 * 3600 * (15,000)^3) / (2π * 6.67430×10^-11). Calculating this gives the total mass of system_1.; answer - M_total = (2 * 365.25 * 24 * 3600 * (15,000)^3) / (2π * 6.67430×10^-11)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4b output: thinking - To calculate the total mass of system_2, we use the binary mass function formula. The binary mass function is given by: f(M) = (P * (K1 + K2)^3) / (2 * π * G), where P is the period of the system, K1 and K2 are the radial velocity amplitudes, and G is the gravitational constant. For system_2, P = 1 year = 3.154e7 seconds, K1 + K2 = 25,000 m/s, and G = 6.67430e-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2. Plugging these values into the formula, we get: f(M) = (3.154e7 * (25,000)^3) / (2 * π * 6.67430e-11). Calculating this gives f(M) ≈ 1.989e30 kg, which is approximately the mass of the Sun.

To find the ratio R = M_total,1 / M_total,2, we need to evaluate the expression for M_total,1 and divide it by the mass of system_2. Evaluating the expression for M_total,1 gives a numerical value, which we then divide by 1 solar mass to find the ratio. The calculation shows that M_total,1 is approximately 0.6 times the mass of system_2.; answer - ~ 0.6\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4d output: thinking - To validate the mass ratio factor using the approximate method, we use the formula: ratio_approx = (T1/T2) * ((K1_1 + K2_1)/(K1_2 + K2_2))^3.

The sum of radial velocity amplitudes for system_1 is K1_1 + K2_1 = 15,000 m/s, and for system_2 is K1_2 + K2_2 = 25,000 m/s. Plugging these into the formula, we get: ratio_approx = (2/1) * (15,000/25,000)^3 = 2 * (0.6)^3 = 2 * 0.216 = 0.432.

For system_2 with a period of 1 year, it is 1 * 365.25 * 24 * 3600 seconds. To convert radial velocity amplitudes from km/s to m/s, we multiply by 1000, since 1 km = 1000 m.

For system_1 with a period of 2 years, this becomes 2 * 31,536,000 = 63,072,000 seconds. For system_2 with a period of 1 year, this is 1 * 31,536,000 = 31,536,000 seconds. To convert the radial velocity amplitudes from km/s to m/s, we multiply by 1,000 (since 1 km = 1,000 m). Thus, for system_1 with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s, the conversions are 10,000 m/s and 5,000 m/s, respectively. For system_2 with amplitudes of 15 km/s and 10 km/s, the conversions are 15,000 m/s and 10,000 m/s, respectively.

The expression for M_total,1 is given as (2 * 365.25 * 24 * 3600 * (15,000)^3) / (2π * 6.67430×10^-11). From sub-task 4b, the total mass of system_2 is approximately 1 solar mass, which is 1.989e30 kg. To find the ratio R = M_total,1 / M_total,2, we need to compute the numerical value of M_total,1 using the given expression and then divide it by 1.989e30 kg. Calculating M_total,1: T = 2 * 365.25 * 24 * 3600 = 63,072,000 seconds. K1 + K2 = 15,000 m/s. Plugging these into the formula: M_total,1 = (63,072,000 * (15,000)^3) / (2π * 6.67430×10^-11). This gives M_total,1 ≈ 1.393e30 kg. Now, R = 1.393e30 / 1.989e30 ≈ 0.7.
