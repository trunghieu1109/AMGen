proposed answer: The derived energy spectrum for the 2D quantum harmonic oscillator is E = (n_x + 1/2)ħsqrt(2k/m) + (n_y + 1/2)ħsqrt(k/(2m)). This expression accounts for the different effective spring constants in the x and y directions, which are 2k and 1/2k respectively. This leads to angular frequencies ω_x = sqrt(2k/m) and ω_y = sqrt(k/(2m)). When we substitute these into the energy formula, we get E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m). This matches choice 1 in the original question, which is E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m). All agents agree that choice A) is the correct match for the derived energy spectrum, considering the effective spring constants and the structure of the potential.
