At high energies, QED encounters divergences in its calculations, particularly in loop diagrams where virtual particles can have arbitrarily high energies, leading to infinite results. To obtain finite, physically meaningful predictions, QED requires regularization techniques to handle these divergences. This process involves introducing a cutoff or parameter to make the integrals finite, and then renormalization is used to absorb these infinities into redefined physical constants.

It is a part of the Standard Model of particle physics and is known for its precision in predicting phenomena such as the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron. However, QED encounters divergences at high energies due to the interactions of charged particles with the electromagnetic field. These divergences manifest as infinite results in certain calculations, necessitating the use of regularization techniques to make sense of these infinities. Regularization allows physicists to introduce a cutoff or parameter to control these divergences, leading to finite and physically meaningful predictions.
