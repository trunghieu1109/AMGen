LDA (Lithium diisopropylamide) is a strong, non-nucleophilic base commonly used to deprotonate alpha hydrogens adjacent to carbonyl groups or similar structures, such as the alpha carbon in enamines, making them more nucleophilic. DME (Dimethoxyethane) is an ether solvent often used in reactions involving organolithium reagents like LDA, as it can solubilize both the base and the substrate. CH3CH2I (ethyl iodide) is an alkylating agent, which can react with the nucleophilic site on the enamine to introduce an ethyl group. H3O+ (hydronium ion) is used to hydrolyze the iminium ion or enamine back to the carbonyl compound, completing the reaction sequence.
