According to Kepler's third law, a^3 = (G * M_star * P^2) / (4 * π^2), where P is the orbital period and M_star is the mass of the host star. For circular orbits, this simplifies to a = (G * M_star * P^2 / (4 * π^2))^(1/3). Given that both host stars have the same radius, R_star, and the mass of Planet_1's host star is twice that of Planet_2's, we can calculate the semi-major axis for each planet. Since Planet_1's period is one-third of Planet_2's, P1 = P2 / 3. For Planet_1, a1 = (G * 2M * (P2/3)^2 / (4 * π^2))^(1/3) = (G * 2M * P2^2 / 9 / (4 * π^2))^(1/3). For Planet_2, a2 = (G * M * P2^2 / (4 * π^2))^(1/3). The ratio of transit probabilities is (R_star / a1) / (R_star / a2) = a2 / a1. Simplifying, a2 / a1 = ((G * M * P2^2 / (4 * π^2))^(1/3)) / ((G * 2M * P2^2 / 9 / (4 * π^2))^(1/3)) = (1 / (2/9)^(1/3)) = (9/2)^(1/3) ≈ 1.65.

The semi-major axis is determined using Kepler's third law, which relates the orbital period and the mass of the host star. For Planet_1, which has a shorter orbital period and a host star with twice the mass of Planet_2's host star, the semi-major axis is smaller compared to Planet_2. This results in a higher transit probability for Planet_1. The ratio of the transit probabilities was calculated to be approximately 1.65, meaning Planet_1 has a 1.65 times higher probability of transiting compared to Planet_2. Therefore, the researchers should choose to observe Planet_1 as it has the higher probability of transiting.; answer - Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - The task is to determine which planet to observe based on the transit probability ratio.
