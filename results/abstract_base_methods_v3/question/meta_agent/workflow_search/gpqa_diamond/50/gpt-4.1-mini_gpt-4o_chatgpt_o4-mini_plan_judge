Question: Example(question='If a charge q is placed d distance away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius R. Calculate the net potential energy of this system.', choice1='U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)', choice2='U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)', choice3='U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)', choice4='U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_5_50
proposed answer: The derived expression for the potential energy from Sub-task 4 is U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2). This expression matches exactly with choice 1, which is U = - (1/2) * kq^2 R / (d^2 - R^2). The variables and the structure of the expression are identical, confirming that choice 1 is the correct option. The other choices do not match this expression, either due to differences in coefficients, variables, or the arrangement of terms. Therefore, the correct potential energy formula is choice 1.
