Question: Example(question='X is a meson resonance. What is the mean decay distance? Knowing that the production energy is $E_{X}=8GeV$, the mass $m_{X}=1.2GeV$, and the width $\\Gamma_{X}=320MeV$.', choice1='5.0223 * 10^-16 m', choice2='4.0655 * 10^-16 m', choice3='4.0655 * 10^-15 m', choice4='5.0223 * 10^-15 m', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_4_143
proposed answer: The computed mean decay distance from Sub-task 3 is 4.0655 * 10^-15 m. When comparing this value with the given multiple-choice options: 'choice1': 5.0223 * 10^-16 m, 'choice2': 4.0655 * 10^-16 m, 'choice3': 4.0655 * 10^-15 m, 'choice4': 5.0223 * 10^-15 m, it is clear that the computed value exactly matches 'choice3': 4.0655 * 10^-15 m. Therefore, 'choice3' is the correct and closest matching choice.
