        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - To calculate the relativistic gamma factor (\u03b3) of the meson X, we use the relation \u03b3 = E_X / m_X. The production energy E_X is given as 8 GeV, and the rest mass m_X is given as 1.2 GeV. Therefore, \u03b3 = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.6667. This calculation is straightforward as it involves dividing the total energy by the rest mass energy to find the Lorentz factor, which indicates how much time dilation and length contraction the particle experiences due to its relativistic speed.; answer - 6.6667\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - To determine the mean lifetime (\u03c4) of the meson X, we use the relation \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393_X. The decay width \u0393_X is given as 320 MeV, which is equivalent to 0.32 GeV. The reduced Planck constant \u0127 is approximately 6.582119569e-25 GeV\u00b7s. Thus, we calculate \u03c4 as \u03c4 = 6.582119569e-25 GeV\u00b7s / 0.32 GeV = 2.0569123653125e-24 s. This calculation involves dividing the reduced Planck constant by the decay width to obtain the mean lifetime of the particle in seconds.; answer - 2.0569123653125e-24 s\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - To compute the mean decay distance (L) of the meson X in the lab frame, we use the formula L = \u03b3 * \u03b2 * c * \u03c4. From Sub-task 1, we have \u03b3 = 6.6667. From Sub-task 2, the mean lifetime \u03c4 is 2.0569123653125e-24 s. The speed of light c is 3.0e8 m/s. We calculate \u03b2 using the formula \u03b2 = sqrt(1 - 1/\u03b3^2). Substituting \u03b3 = 6.6667, we get \u03b2 = sqrt(1 - 1/(6.6667)^2) = sqrt(1 - 1/44.4444) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887. Now, we can calculate L = \u03b3 * \u03b2 * c * \u03c4 = 6.6667 * 0.9887 * 3.0e8 m/s * 2.0569123653125e-24 s. Calculating this gives L \u2248 4.0655 * 10^-15 m. Therefore, the mean decay distance is approximately 4.0655 * 10^-15 m, which matches choice3.; answer - 4.0655 * 10^-15 m\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - The computed mean decay distance from Sub-task 3 is 4.0655 * 10^-15 m. When comparing this value with the given multiple-choice options: 'choice1': 5.0223 * 10^-16 m, 'choice2': 4.0655 * 10^-16 m, 'choice3': 4.0655 * 10^-15 m, 'choice4': 5.0223 * 10^-15 m, it is clear that the computed value exactly matches 'choice3': 4.0655 * 10^-15 m.
