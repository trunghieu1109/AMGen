            "A supernova occurred in our Galaxy. Part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta part and the Galaxy are inertial frames of reference. From the reference frame of the ejecta, the center of the Galaxy is moving at 60 000 km/s (sixty thousand kilometers per second) towards it.\nWhat distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?\n\n(Note: Gravity can be ignored, and rotation and revolution of the Galaxy can be ignored.)",

        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The problem statement provides the following physical quantities and reference frames: 1) The velocity of the center of the Galaxy as observed from the ejecta's reference frame is 60,000 km/s. 2) The time interval in the ejecta's reference frame is 50 seconds. 3) The reference frames involved are the ejecta's reference frame and the Galaxy's reference frame. These are identified based on the description of the motion and the frames of reference mentioned in the problem.; answer - The given physical quantities and reference frames are: 1) Velocity of the center of the Galaxy in the ejecta's reference frame: 60,000 km/s. 2) Time interval in the ejecta's reference frame: 50 seconds. 3) Reference frames: ejecta's reference frame and Galaxy's reference frame.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - In the problem, we have two inertial frames: the ejecta's frame and the Galaxy's frame. The problem states that from the ejecta's reference frame, the center of the Galaxy is moving towards it at a velocity of 60,000 km/s. This means that if we consider the ejecta to be at rest, the Galaxy is approaching the ejecta at this speed. Since both frames are inertial and there are no external forces acting (gravity and rotation are ignored), this relative velocity is consistent with the principle of relativity, which states that the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames. Thus, the relative velocity between the two frames is 60,000 km/s, with the Galaxy moving towards the ejecta at this speed.; answer - The two inertial frames are the ejecta's frame and the Galaxy's frame. The given relative velocity of 60,000 km/s means that from the perspective of the ejecta, the center of the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - In the problem, we have two inertial frames: the ejecta's frame and the Galaxy's frame. From the ejecta's reference frame, the center of the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. By the principle of relative motion, if the Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at 60,000 km/s in the ejecta's frame, then the ejecta must be moving towards the Galaxy at 60,000 km/s in the Galaxy's frame. This is because relative velocity is symmetric between two inertial frames. Therefore, the velocity of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy frame is 60,000 km/s. This determination assumes classical mechanics and ignores relativistic effects, which is reasonable given the velocity is much less than the speed of light.; answer - The velocity of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy frame is 60,000 km/s.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - To calculate the time interval elapsed in the Galaxy frame corresponding to 50 seconds elapsed in the ejecta frame, we need to use the time dilation formula from special relativity. The formula is: t' = t / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2), where t' is the time interval in the Galaxy frame, t is the time interval in the ejecta frame (50 seconds), v is the relative velocity (60,000 km/s), and c is the speed of light (approximately 300,000 km/s). First, we calculate the factor v^2/c^2: (60,000 km/s)^2 / (300,000 km/s)^2 = 0.04. Then, we calculate the time dilation factor: sqrt(1 - 0.04) = sqrt(0.96). The time interval in the Galaxy frame is then: t' = 50 / sqrt(0.96). Calculating this gives t' \u2248 50.51 seconds. Therefore, the time interval elapsed in the Galaxy frame is approximately 50.51 seconds.; answer - The time interval elapsed in the Galaxy frame is approximately 50.51 seconds.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - The calculated distance traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy frame is 3,030,600 km, based on the velocity of 60,000 km/s and the time interval of 50.51 seconds.
