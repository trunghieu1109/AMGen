Question: Example(question='A supernova occurred in our Galaxy. Part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta part and the Galaxy are inertial frames of reference. From the reference frame of the ejecta, the center of the Galaxy is moving at 60 000 km/s (sixty thousand kilometers per second) towards it.\nWhat distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?\n\n(Note: Gravity can be ignored, and rotation and revolution of the Galaxy can be ignored.)', choice1='2 880 000 km.', choice2='3 000 000 km.', choice3='3 060 000 km.', choice4='2 940 000 km.', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_122
proposed answer: The calculated distance traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy frame is 3,030,600 km, based on the velocity of 60,000 km/s and the time interval of 50.51 seconds. This value does not exactly match any of the provided multiple-choice options. However, the closest option to the calculated distance is 3,060,000 km. This suggests that the given choices might involve some rounding or approximation. Therefore, the most reasonable choice, considering the options provided, is to select the one that is closest to the calculated value, which is choice C) 3,060,000 km.
