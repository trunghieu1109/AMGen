        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - To find the relative velocity of two objects moving in the same direction at relativistic speeds, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula: v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c^2). Here, v1 = 0.6c and v2 = 0.5c. Plugging these values into the formula, we get v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6 * 0.5)) = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3) = 0.1c / 0.7 = 0.142857c, which is approximately 0.14c.; answer - v_rel = 0.14c\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - The Lorentz factor (gamma) is calculated using the formula: gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2). For the astronaut with velocity 0.6c, gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25. For the astronaut with velocity 0.5c, gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) = 1 / 0.8660254 \u2248 1.1547.; answer - The Lorentz factors are approximately 1.25 for the astronaut traveling at 0.6c and 1.1547 for the astronaut traveling at 0.5c.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - The relativistic energy of an object is given by E = gamma * m * c^2, where gamma is the Lorentz factor, m is the rest mass, and c is the speed of light. For the astronaut with mass 2m and velocity 0.6c, the Lorentz factor is 1.25. Therefore, the energy is E1 = 1.25 * 2m * c^2 = 2.5m * c^2. For the astronaut with mass 3m and velocity 0.5c, the Lorentz factor is approximately 1.1547. Therefore, the energy is E2 = 1.1547 * 3m * c^2 \u2248 3.4641m * c^2. The total energy of the system is the sum of these energies: E_total = E1 + E2 = 2.5m * c^2 + 3.4641m * c^2 \u2248 5.9641m * c^2.; answer - The total relativistic energy of the system is approximately 5.9641m * c^2.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - From Sub-task 3, we have already calculated the total relativistic energy of each astronaut. The astronaut with mass 2m and velocity 0.6c has an energy of E1 = 2.5m * c^2. The astronaut with mass 3m and velocity 0.5c has an energy of E2 \u2248 3.4641m * c^2. The total energy of the system is the sum of these two energies: E_total = E1 + E2 = 2.5m * c^2 + 3.4641m * c^2 \u2248 5.9641m * c^2. Therefore, the total energy of the system is approximately 5.9641m * c^2.; answer - The total energy of the system is approximately 5.9641m * c^2.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - All agents have calculated the relative velocity to be 0.14c and the total energy to be approximately 5.9641m * c^2. When comparing these results with the given multiple-choice options, Choice 1 has v_rel = 0.14c and E = 5.96 mc^2, which closely matches the calculated values. The other choices do not match both the relative velocity and the total energy. Therefore, Choice 1 is the correct answer.; answer - A)"
