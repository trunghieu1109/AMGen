In standard Maxwell's equations, Gauss's law for magnetism is expressed as ∇·B = 0, which directly states that there are no magnetic monopoles, as the divergence of the magnetic field is zero, implying no 'magnetic charge' exists to create a net flux.

If magnetic monopoles exist, this equation changes to ∇·B = ρ_m, where ρ_m is the magnetic monopole density. This directly affects the divergence of the magnetic field. Ampère's law in its standard form is ∇×B = μ₀(J + ε₀∂E/∂t). With magnetic monopoles, an additional term is added, resulting in ∇×B = μ₀(J + ε₀∂E/∂t) + μ₀ε₀∂B_m/∂t, where B_m is the magnetic field due to monopoles. Therefore, both the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field equations change. Faraday's law, ∇×E = -∂B/∂t, is not directly affected by monopoles unless there is a corresponding electric monopole term, which is not standard in this context. However, the presence of magnetic monopoles implies a symmetry that might suggest a dual term in Faraday's law, but traditionally it's the divergence and curl of the magnetic field that are modified.
