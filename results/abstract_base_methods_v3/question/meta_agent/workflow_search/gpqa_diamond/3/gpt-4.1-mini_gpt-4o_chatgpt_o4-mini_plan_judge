proposed answer: In the presence of magnetic monopoles, two of Maxwell's equations are modified. Gauss's law for magnetism, originally stating that the divergence of the magnetic field is zero (∇·B = 0), changes to ∇·B = ρ_m, where ρ_m is the magnetic charge density. This reflects the presence of magnetic monopoles. Additionally, Ampère's law with Maxwell's addition, which originally states that the curl of the magnetic field is related to the current density and the displacement current (∇×H = J + ∂D/∂t), would include an additional term for magnetic current density, analogous to how electric currents are included for electric charges. Therefore, both the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field equations are affected by the presence of magnetic monopoles. This aligns with the choice that mentions both divergence and curl of the magnetic field would be different.

proposed answer: In the presence of magnetic monopoles, Maxwell's equations are modified. Specifically, Gauss's law for magnetism changes to account for magnetic charge density, and Ampère's law is modified to include a magnetic current density term. These changes affect both the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field. Therefore, the correct choice is the one that mentions both the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field, which corresponds to choice 2. This aligns with electromagnetic theory, where the introduction of magnetic monopoles leads to these specific changes in Maxwell's equations. The final answer format is correct as it is a single letter choice (B), which corresponds to the correct option identified in the sub-task. The reasoning provided aligns with electromagnetic theory, where the presence of magnetic monopoles modifies Maxwell's equations, specifically affecting both the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field. This matches choice 2, which is correctly identified as B.
