proposed answer: The calculated minimum uncertainty in energy (ΔE) from the sub-tasks is approximately 1.056 * 10^(-18) J. When comparing this result with the given multiple-choice options, the closest match is choice 2, which is ~10^(-18) J. This choice is justified because the calculated value 1.056 * 10^(-18) J is closest to the option ~10^(-18) J, making it the most reasonable selection given the provided options. All agents agree on this choice based on the calculations and comparisons made.

proposed answer: The electron is traveling at a speed of 2 × 10^8 m/s, which is a significant fraction of the speed of light (approximately 0.67c). This indicates that relativistic effects are important and should be considered. All debate agents agree that the relativistic approach is necessary for accurately calculating the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) due to the high speed of the electron. The relativistic energy-momentum relation was used, resulting in an uncertainty in energy, ΔE, of approximately 1.58 × 10^(-16) J. This value aligns with choice C) ~10^(-16) J. The non-relativistic approach would underestimate the uncertainty in energy because it does not account for the increase in mass and energy associated with relativistic speeds. Therefore, the physically sound choice for ΔE is based on the relativistic calculation, and the closest matching multiple-choice option is C) ~10^(-16) J.
