The speed of light, c, is approximately 3 \u00d7 10^8 m/s. To determine if relativistic effects are significant, we calculate the ratio v/c. This gives v/c = (2 \u00d7 10^8 m/s) / (3 \u00d7 10^8 m/s) = 2/3 \u2248 0.67. Since this ratio is greater than 0.1, relativistic effects are indeed significant. When v is a significant fraction of c, relativistic formulas should be used to calculate the energy and its uncertainty. Therefore, we should consider relativistic effects in the energy uncertainty calculation.; answer - Relativistic effects are significant because v/c \u2248 0.67, so relativistic formulas must be applied for energy uncertainty calculation.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - The electron's speed is v = 2 \u00d7 10^8 m/s, which is approximately 0.67 times the speed of light (c \u2248 3 \u00d7 10^8 m/s).

The uncertainty in momentum is \u0394p \u2248 5.272859 \u00d7 10^(-25) kg\u00b7m/s. In the relativistic regime, the energy-momentum relation is E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m\u2080c^2)^2. However, for the uncertainty in energy, we can use the approximation \u0394E \u2248 c * \u0394p when the kinetic energy is much larger than the rest mass energy.
