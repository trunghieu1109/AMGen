However, the reaction sequence provided (NaNO2 + HCl, H2O, aq. KOH, Heat) suggests a diazotization and hydrolysis process. This would convert the amine group into a diazonium salt, which upon hydrolysis, would yield a phenol. Therefore, the final product should have a hydroxyl group instead of an amine. The NMR data supports the presence of an aromatic ring and an aldehyde group, but the final product should be a phenol derivative. Given the reaction conditions and the transformation of the amine to a phenol, the final product is more likely to be a structure with a phenolic group, such as 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde or a similar phenolic aldehyde.
