proposed answer: The computed flux ratio from the analysis is 10. The multiple-choice options provided are: A) 0.1 (10^-1), B) 10, C) 1, D) 0.01 (10^-2). The computed ratio of 10 matches option B. Therefore, the correct answer choice is B.

Answer:B
Extracted answer: B
Correct answer: 4

proposed answer: The computed flux ratio from sub-task 5 is 0. We need to compare this result to the provided multiple-choice options: 0.1 (10^-1), 10, 1, and 0.01 (10^-2). None of these options match the computed ratio of 0. However, the closest option to 0 is 0.01 (10^-2), which is a very small number. In the context of multiple-choice questions, when the exact answer is not available, the closest approximation is often selected. Therefore, the closest choice to 0 is 0.01 (10^-2), which corresponds to choice D.
