proposed answer: The correct sequence for synthesizing [1,1'-bi(cyclopentylidene)]-2-one from 1,5-dichloropentane involves the following steps: 1) Zn, ether for the Wurtz reaction, 2) Cl2/hv for halogenation, 3) Aq. KOH for dehydrohalogenation, 4) Pyridine + CrO3 + HCl for oxidation, and 5) Aq. NaOH for workup. Comparing this sequence with the given choices, choice 1 matches exactly with this deduced sequence. The other choices do not match the logical sequence in terms of reagents and reactions necessary for the synthesis of the target compound.
