The energy difference between the levels is given as ΔE = 1.38 × 10^(-23) J. The assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) implies that the populations of the energy levels follow the Boltzmann distribution. This means that the ratio of the populations of the excited states in the two stars can be related to their temperatures using the Boltzmann factor, which is proportional to exp(-ΔE/kT), where k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature.

The given condition is that the population of the excited state in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Using the Boltzmann distribution, the ratio of populations in the excited state to the ground state for star_1 is exp(-ΔE/k_B T_1) and for star_2 is exp(-ΔE/k_B T_2). The condition is exp(-ΔE/k_B T_1) = 2 * exp(-ΔE/k_B T_2). Taking the natural logarithm of both sides gives -ΔE/k_B T_1 = ln(2) - ΔE/k_B T_2. Rearranging this equation gives ln(2) = ΔE/k_B (1/T_2 - 1/T_1). This equation relates the temperatures T_1 and T_2 of the two stars, with the factor ΔE/k_B ensuring dimensional consistency. The derivation is correct and dimensionally consistent because ΔE has units of energy (Joules), k_B is the Boltzmann constant with units of energy per temperature (Joules per Kelvin), and T_1 and T_2 are temperatures (Kelvin). The expression (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) is dimensionless, as it is a difference of reciprocals of temperatures.

This simplifies the equation ln(2) = ΔE/k_B (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) to ln(2) = 1 (1/T_2 - 1/T_1), or simply ln(2) = 1/T_2 - 1/T_1.
