Question: Example(question='Two stars are being studied. It has been observed that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2. In fact, the energy difference between the considered energy levels was determined to be approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J.

proposed answer: The derived equation from the sub-tasks is ln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2). This matches the form of choice 4 in the original question, which is ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]. The derivation shows that by taking the ratio of the Boltzmann factors and applying the logarithm, we arrive at an expression for ln(2) in terms of the temperatures T_1 and T_2. The algebraic manipulation involves recognizing that the difference in inverse temperatures (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) can be rewritten as (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2), which is exactly the form given in choice 4. None of the other choices match this algebraic form, confirming that choice 4 is the correct relationship.

proposed answer: The problem involves comparing the excitation levels of iron atoms in the photospheres of two stars, assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). The energy difference between the levels is given, and we need to relate this to the effective temperatures of the stars. The derived equation is ln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2), which is consistent with the assumption that the energy difference Î”E/k_B = 1 K, leading to ln(2) = 1/T_2 - 1/T_1. This equation is dimensionally consistent, as both sides are dimensionless. The choice D) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)] matches the derived equation exactly. The derivation and the selected answer are physically correct, dimensionally consistent, and logically coherent.
