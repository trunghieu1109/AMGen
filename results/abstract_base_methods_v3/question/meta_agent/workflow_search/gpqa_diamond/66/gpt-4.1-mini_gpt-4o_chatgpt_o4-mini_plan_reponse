The total angular momentum quantum number for the system is l = 2, and the z-component of the total angular momentum is m = -1. This is a standard notation for coupled angular momentum states in quantum mechanics.; answer - The individual electron orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are l1 = 1 and l2 = 1.

The combinations that satisfy m1 + m2 = -1 are: (m1, m2) = (-1, 0), (0, -1), and (-1, -1).

We use the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient tables to find the coefficients for these pairs in the context of coupling two angular momenta l1 = 1 and l2 = 1 to form a total angular momentum l = 2 with m = -1.

From Sub-task 2a, the valid pairs are (-1, 0), (0, -1), and (-1, -1). The pair (-1, -1) cannot contribute to m = -1, so its Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is 0.

This is because the total magnetic quantum number m = -1 cannot be achieved with both m1 and m2 being -1, as their sum would be -2, not -1.
