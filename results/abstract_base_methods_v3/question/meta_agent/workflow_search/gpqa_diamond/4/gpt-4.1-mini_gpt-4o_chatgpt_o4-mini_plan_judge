Question: Example(question='Calculate the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator $\\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\\hbar/2$. Given the $X-$component, $P_x$ of the operator $P$ as $\\hbar/2$ times a 2 by 2 square matrix having elements in the first row as $(0 1)$, and that in the second row as $(1, 0)$. The $Y-$component, $P_y$ of the operator is given by the product of $\\hbar/2$ and a 2 by 2 square matrix having elements in the first row as $(0, -i)$, and that in the second row as $(i, 0)$. Finally, the $Z-$component, $P_z$ of the operator is given by the product of $\\hbar/2$  and another 2 by 2 square matrix having elements in the first row as $(1, 0)$, and that in the second row as $(0, -1)$.  What are the elements of the normalized eigenvector? \n', choice1='(\\cos(\\theta), e^{i\\phi}\\sin (\\theta))\u2028', choice2='(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar, \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar)', choice3='(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin (\\theta/2))\n', choice4='(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar \\cos(\\theta/2), \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar \\sin (\\theta/2))', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: The normalized eigenvector elements obtained in Sub-task 5 are (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)). We need to compare this with the given multiple-choice options. Choice 1 is (cos(θ), e^{iφ}sin(θ)), which does not match because it involves full angles θ and φ, and an exponential term. Choice 2 is (√(2/3)ħ, √(1/3)ħ), which does not match because it involves specific numerical coefficients and ħ. Choice 3 is (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)), which matches exactly with the form obtained in Sub-task 5. Choice 4 is (√(2/3)ħ cos(θ/2), √(1/3)ħ sin(θ/2)), which does not match because it involves numerical coefficients and ħ. Therefore, the correct choice that matches the normalized eigenvector form is Choice 3.
