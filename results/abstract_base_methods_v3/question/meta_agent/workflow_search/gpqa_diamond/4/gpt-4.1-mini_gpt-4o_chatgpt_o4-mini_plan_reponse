In the x-z plane, the y-component of the vector is zero. A common way to parameterize directions in a plane is using trigonometric functions. For a direction vector in the x-z plane, we can use an angle \\( \\theta \\) to describe its orientation. The x-component can be represented as \\( \\sin(\\theta) \\) and the z-component as \\( \\cos(\\theta) \\). This is analogous to representing a unit vector on a circle where the x-coordinate is given by the sine and the z-coordinate by the cosine of the angle with respect to the z-axis. Thus, the direction vector \\( \\vec{n} \\) can be expressed as \\( (\\sin(\\theta), 0, \\cos(\\theta)) \\).; answer - (\\sin(\\theta), 0, \\cos(\\theta))\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - To construct the operator \\( P \\cdot \\vec{n} \\), we need to take the dot product of the vector \\( \\vec{n} = (\\sin(\\theta), 0, \\cos(\\theta)) \\) with the operator \\( \\vec{P} = (P_x, P_y, P_z) \\). From Sub-task 1, we have the matrices for \\( P_x, P_y, \\) and \\( P_z \\). Since \\( \\vec{n} \\) lies in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero, so the contribution from \\( P_y \\) is zero. Therefore, \\( P \\cdot \\vec{n} = \\sin(\\theta) P_x + \\cos(\\theta) P_z \\). Substituting the matrices, we get: \\( P \\cdot \\vec{n} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\sin(\\theta) \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\cos(\\theta) \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) \\).

The problem provides the components of the operator in terms of Pauli matrices and asks for the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +\u0127/2. The sub-task solutions consistently derive the eigenvector by solving the matrix equation and normalizing it. The solutions show that the eigenvector components are expressed in terms of trigonometric functions of \u03b8/2, specifically (cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)). This form is consistent with the known solutions for spin-1/2 systems in quantum mechanics, where the eigenvectors of the Pauli matrices are expressed in terms of angles. All agents agree on this form, and it satisfies the normalization condition, as cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2) + sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2) = 1. Therefore, the final decision on the normalized eigenvector elements is (cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)).; answer - (\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin (\\theta/2))\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 6 output: thinking - The normalized eigenvector elements obtained in Sub-task 5 are (cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)).
