proposed answer: The final product 4 is a cyclohexane derivative with an ethyl cyanoacetate substituent. The cyclohexane ring typically has two sets of hydrogens: axial and equatorial. However, the presence of the ethyl cyanoacetate substituent breaks the symmetry of the cyclohexane ring, potentially leading to more distinct hydrogen environments. The ethyl group contributes distinct hydrogen environments: the methyl group, the methylene group, and the hydrogen on the carbon adjacent to the cyano group. The cyano group affects the chemical environment of nearby hydrogens. Considering these factors, the distinct hydrogen environments are: 1) axial hydrogens on the cyclohexane, 2) equatorial hydrogens on the cyclohexane, 3) methylene hydrogens adjacent to the ester, 4) methyl group hydrogens on the ethyl chain, and 5) methylene hydrogens adjacent to the cyano group. This analysis leads to the identification of 10 distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum, as the substituent breaks the symmetry of the cyclohexane ring, making each hydrogen potentially distinct.

proposed answer: To perform a self-consistency check, I will independently recount the chemically distinct hydrogen environments in product 4. Product 4 is derived from a cyclohexane ring with substituents that break the symmetry. The substituents include a cyano group and an ethoxycarbonyl group. The cyclohexane ring can have distinct axial and equatorial hydrogens at each carbon due to the substituents. Each carbon in the cyclohexane ring (C2, C3, C4, C5) can have distinct axial and equatorial hydrogens, potentially leading to 8 distinct signals from the ring. Additionally, the ethyl cyanoacetate substituent contributes 2 distinct signals: one from the CH2 group and one from the CH3 group. Combining these, we have 8 distinct signals from the cyclohexane ring and 2 from the ethyl group, totaling 10 distinct hydrogen environments. This accounts for the asymmetry introduced by the substituents and the distinct chemical environments of the hydrogens. The count is consistent with the previous analysis, confirming the total number of distinct signals is 10.
