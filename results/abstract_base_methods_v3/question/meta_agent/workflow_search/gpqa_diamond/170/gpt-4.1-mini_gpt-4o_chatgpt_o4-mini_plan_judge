Question: Example(question='Substances 1-6 undergo an electrophilic substitution reaction with an excess of bromine (it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed):\n1) ะก6H5-CH3\n2) C6H5-COOC2H5\n3) C6H5-Cl\n4) C6H5-NO2\n5) C6H5-C2H5\n6) C6H5-COOH\nC6H5 - means benzene ring\nArrange the substances in order of increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer.', choice1='3<5<1<6<2<4', choice2='4<2<6<3<1<5', choice3='6<2<4<5<1<3', choice4='4<6<2<1<5<3', correct_index=4)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_170
proposed answer: The order determined in Sub-task 5 is 4<2<6<1<5<3. We need to match this order with the provided multiple-choice options. Let's examine each choice:

- Choice 1: 3<5<1<6<2<4
- Choice 2: 4<2<6<3<1<5
- Choice 3: 6<2<4<5<1<3
- Choice 4: 4<6<2<1<5<3

The correct order from Sub-task 5 is 4<2<6<1<5<3. Comparing this with the choices, we see that Choice 4 matches exactly with the order 4<6<2<1<5<3. Therefore, the correct choice is D).
