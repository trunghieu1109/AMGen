Question: Example(question='You have prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The FTIR spectrum of this compound shows absorption peaks indicating the presence of an ester group. The 1H NMR spectrum shows six signals: two signals corresponding to aromatic-H, two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups. There are no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups. Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, or C12H14O2.', choice1='C12H14O2', choice2='C12H12O2', choice3='C11H14O2', choice4='C11H12O2', correct_index=4)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_52
proposed answer: The analysis of the NMR and FTIR data indicates that the compound has 12 hydrogens and 12 carbons, which fits the formula C12H12O2. The NMR data shows two aromatic protons, two vinyl protons, and two methyl groups, totaling 12 hydrogens. The absence of -CH2 signals supports this count. The presence of an ester group implies at least two oxygens. The aromatic ring typically contributes 6 carbons, and the remaining carbons can be part of the ester and vinyl groups. C11H12O2 and C11H14O2 have fewer carbons than indicated by the aromatic and ester structure. C12H14O2 has more hydrogens than observed in the NMR data. Therefore, C12H12O2 is the best fit, which corresponds to choice B.
