Question: Example(question='In an inactive state, a transcription factor subunit awaits an activation signal from the membrane phosphorylation cascade. Upon phosphorylation on the Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, shuttles into the nucleus, and serves in gene transcription. A missense mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. You observe that a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Which of the following molecular phenotypes is most likely observed in the presence of mutation Y?', choice1='loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype', choice2='protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype', choice3='protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele', choice4='change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_24_157
proposed answer: A dominant-negative mutation in the dimerization domain typically results in the formation of non-functional dimers with the wild-type protein, leading to a loss-of-function phenotype. The mutation Y, being dominant-negative, suggests that the mutant protein can still dimerize but forms non-functional complexes with the wild-type protein, sequestering it and preventing it from functioning properly. This often results in protein aggregation, as the non-functional dimers accumulate, leading to a loss-of-function phenotype. The other options do not align as well with the typical effects of a dominant-negative mutation: loss of dimerization would not result in a wild-type phenotype, protein degradation is less common than sequestration, and a gain-of-function phenotype is not typical for dominant-negative mutations. Therefore, the most likely molecular phenotype observed in the presence of mutation Y is protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype.
