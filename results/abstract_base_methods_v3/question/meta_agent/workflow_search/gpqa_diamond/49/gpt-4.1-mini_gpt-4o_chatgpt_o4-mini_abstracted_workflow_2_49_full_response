Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent BQak', content="In quantum field theory, the number of loops in a Feynman diagram is often determined by the powers of the coupling constants and the loop factors, typically expressed as powers of 1/(4pi). Each loop generally contributes a factor of 1/(4pi)^2 to the amplitude. The given size estimate expression is 'alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2'. The factor 1/(4pi)^6 suggests 3 loops because each loop contributes a factor of 1/(4pi)^2, and (1/(4pi)^2)^3 = 1/(4pi)^6.
