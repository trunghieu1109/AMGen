The maximum amplitude A is the furthest distance the mass moves from the equilibrium position. In the relativistic context, the kinetic energy and momentum are modified by the Lorentz factor, which depends on the velocity of the mass. The maximum speed v_max will occur when the potential energy is zero, and all the energy is kinetic. The relativistic kinetic energy is given by E_k = (\u0013 - 1)mc^2, where \u0013 = 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) is the Lorentz factor. The total energy of the system is conserved, and at maximum amplitude, the energy is purely potential, given by (1/2)kA^2. At maximum speed, this energy is converted to kinetic energy.

For a spring with spring constant k and maximum amplitude A, the potential energy U at maximum amplitude is the energy when the spring is stretched or compressed by the maximum amount A. This energy is given by U = (1/2)kA^2. This is derived from integrating the force F = -kx with respect to displacement x, which gives the work done (or energy stored) as (1/2)kx^2. At maximum amplitude, x = A, so the potential energy is U = (1/2)kA^2.; answer - The potential energy of the harmonic oscillator at maximum amplitude A is given by U = (1/2)kA^2.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - The total energy of a relativistic harmonic oscillator consists of the relativistic kinetic energy and the potential energy. The relativistic kinetic energy is given by K = (\u007f - 1)mc^2, where \u007f is the Lorentz factor \u007f = 1/\u001a(1 - v^2/c^2). The potential energy of the harmonic oscillator, as derived in Sub-task 2, is U = (1/2)kA^2 at maximum amplitude. However, for a general position x, the potential energy is U = (1/2)kx^2. Therefore, the total energy E of the system should be expressed as E = (\u007f - 1)mc^2 + (1/2)kx^2, where \u007f = 1/\u001a(1 - v^2/c^2). This expression correctly accounts for the relativistic effects on the kinetic energy and the potential energy at any position x.; answer - The total energy of the system is E = (\u007f - 1)mc^2 + (1/2)kx^2, where \u007f = 1/\u001a(1 - v^2/c^2).\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - To derive the expression relating velocity v to total energy and potential energy, we start with the total energy expression from Sub-task 3: E = (\u03b3 - 1)mc^2 + (1/2)kx^2, where \u03b3 = 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2). We also know that the relativistic energy-momentum relation is E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2, where p is the relativistic momentum p = \u03b3mv. In the case of the harmonic oscillator, the potential energy U = (1/2)kx^2, and the total energy E is constant and equals the maximum energy when the oscillator is at maximum amplitude. Therefore, at any point, E = \u03b3mc^2 = (\u03b3 - 1)mc^2 + (1/2)kx^2. Solving for \u03b3mc^2, we have \u03b3mc^2 = E - (1/2)kx^2. Using the relation \u03b3 = 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2), we can solve for v in terms of E and x: v = c sqrt(1 - (mc^2/(E - (1/2)kx^2))^2). This expression shows how the velocity v is related to the total energy E and the potential energy at position x.; answer - v = c sqrt(1 - (mc^2/(E - (1/2)kx^2))^2)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - To determine the maximum speed $v_{max}$ of a relativistic harmonic oscillator, we need to consider the energy balance at maximum amplitude $A$.
