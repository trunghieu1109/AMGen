proposed answer: The Diels-Alder reaction between 5-fluorocyclopenta-1,3-diene and maleic anhydride is expected to proceed via an endo transition state, which is favored due to secondary orbital interactions. The fluorine atom, being an electron-withdrawing group, influences the electron density of the diene, making it more reactive towards the electron-deficient maleic anhydride. The endo preference is further supported by the syn addition nature of the reaction, where the substituents are on the same face of the newly formed ring. All agents agree that the absolute configuration of the major product is (3aR,4R,7S,7aS,8r), which corresponds to choice 1. This configuration aligns with the endo product where the substituents are positioned to minimize steric hindrance and maximize electronic interactions. Therefore, the correct major product is choice 1.
