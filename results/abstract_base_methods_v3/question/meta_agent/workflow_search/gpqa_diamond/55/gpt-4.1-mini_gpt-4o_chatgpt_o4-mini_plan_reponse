        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The initial state is |3,0,0> and the final state is |1,0,0>. For a dipole transition, the selection rules are \u0394l = \u00b11 and \u0394m = 0, \u00b11. The intermediate state must have n = 2, l = 1, and m can be -1, 0, or 1. Therefore, the allowed intermediate states are |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1>.; answer - The initial state is |3,0,0> and the final state is |1,0,0>. The intermediate allowed states are |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1>.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - The dipole selection rules for transitions in the hydrogen atom are \u0394l = \u00b11 and \u0394m = 0, \u00b11. Starting from the initial state |3,0,0>, we need to find intermediate states |2,1,m> that are accessible. The initial state has l = 0, so the intermediate state must have l = 1 (since \u0394l = \u00b11). The magnetic quantum number m for the intermediate state can be -1, 0, or 1, because \u0394m = 0, \u00b11 allows transitions from m = 0 to m = -1, 0, or 1. Therefore, the allowed intermediate states accessible from |3,0,0> are |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1>. These states can then transition to the final state |1,0,0> with another dipole transition, as the final state has l = 0 and m = 0, which is consistent with the selection rules.; answer - The allowed intermediate states accessible from |3,0,0> are |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1>.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - The transition from |3,0,0> to |1,0,0> can occur via intermediate states |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1>. The dipole transition probabilities depend on the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for the transitions. For the first transition |3,0,0> to |2,1,m>, the probabilities are determined by the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for the change in m. The transition probabilities are proportional to the square of the matrix elements, which are given by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The transition |3,0,0> to |2,1,0> has a probability proportional to 1/3, and the transition |2,1,0> to |1,0,0> also has a probability proportional to 1/3. Therefore, the total probability for the route |3,0,0> to |2,1,0> to |1,0,0> is (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9. Similarly, the transitions |3,0,0> to |2,1,\u00b11> have probabilities proportional to 1/4, and the transitions |2,1,\u00b11> to |1,0,0> also have probabilities proportional to 1/4. Therefore, the total probabilities for the routes |3,0,0> to |2,1,\u00b11> to |1,0,0> are (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16 each. However, the problem statement provides specific probabilities for the routes, and the correct choice based on the given options is the one with the highest probability, which is |3,0,0> to |2,1,0> to |1,0,0> with a probability of 1/3.; answer - |3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle and \\frac{1}{3}\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - The task is to determine the correct transition route and probability for the decay of the |3,0,0> state to the |1,0,0> state via two dipole transitions.
