proposed answer: The task is to determine the correct transition route and probability for the decay of the |3,0,0> state to the |1,0,0> state via two dipole transitions. The possible intermediate states are |2,1,m> where m can be -1, 0, or 1. The calculated probabilities for these transitions are: |3,0,0> to |2,1,0> to |1,0,0> has a probability of 1/3, and |3,0,0> to |2,1,Â±1> to |1,0,0> each have a probability of 1/4. Among the given choices, choice 2 matches the transition route |3,0,0> to |2,1,0> to |1,0,0> with the correct probability of 1/3. The other choices do not match the calculated probabilities. Therefore, the correct answer is choice 2.
