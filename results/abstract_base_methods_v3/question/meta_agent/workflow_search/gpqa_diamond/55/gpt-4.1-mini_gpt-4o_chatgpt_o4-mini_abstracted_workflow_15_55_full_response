From the sub-task, we know that the transition route |3,0,0> to |2,1,0> to |1,0,0> has a probability of 1/3. This matches with choice 2. The other options, |3,0,0> to |2,1,1> to |1,0,0> and |3,0,0> to |2,1,-1> to |1,0,0>, both have probabilities of 1/4, as calculated. These match with choices 1 and 3, respectively. Choice 4 is incorrect because it suggests a probability of 2/3, which does not align with any of the calculated probabilities.
