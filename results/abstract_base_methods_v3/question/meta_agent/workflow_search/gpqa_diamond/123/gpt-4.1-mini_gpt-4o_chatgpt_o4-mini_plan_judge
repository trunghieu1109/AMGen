proposed answer: The calculated Lorentz factor required for two thirds of the particles to reach the detector walls was determined to be 40. This was derived using the equation P = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ)) and solving for γ when P = 2/3. Among the provided multiple-choice options (28, 40, 68, 54), the option 40 matches the calculated Lorentz factor exactly. All agents agree that 40 is the correct choice based on the calculations, making it the closest and correct choice.

proposed answer: To validate the calculated Lorentz factor γ₁, we can double-check the steps involved in deriving it. We start with the survival probability formula P₁ = exp(-<d> / L₁), where P₁ = 2/3 and <d> = 22.5 m. Solving for L₁ gives L₁ = -22.5 m / ln(2/3). Calculating this gives L₁ ≈ 55.48 m. The decay constant c τ was found to be approximately 1.024 m from the previous sub-task. Therefore, the new Lorentz factor γ₁ = L₁ / (c τ) = 55.48 m / 1.024 m ≈ 54.17. This is consistent with the calculations provided. Comparing this value with the multiple-choice options, the closest value is 54. Thus, the choice that matches our calculation is 54.
