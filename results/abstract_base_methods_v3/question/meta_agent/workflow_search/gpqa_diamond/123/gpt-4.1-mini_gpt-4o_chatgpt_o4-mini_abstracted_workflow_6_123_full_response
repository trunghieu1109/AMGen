We have L₀ = γ₀ c τ, so c τ = L₀ / γ₀. From Sub-task 2, L₀ ≈ 20.48 m and γ₀ ≈ 20, so c τ ≈ 20.48 m / 20 ≈ 1.024 m.\n\n(b) Calculate the new decay length L₁ using the desired survival probability P₁ = 2/3 and the average path length <d> = 22.5 m. The survival probability formula is P₁ = exp(-<d> / L₁), so 2/3 = exp(-22.5 m / L₁). Taking the natural logarithm of both sides gives ln(2/3) = -22.5 m / L₁. Solving for L₁ gives L₁ = -22.5 m / ln(2/3).\n\n(c) Solve for the new Lorentz factor γ₁ using the relation L₁ = γ₁ c τ. We have γ₁ = L₁ / (c τ). Substituting the expressions from steps (a) and (b), we get γ₁ = (-22.5 m / ln(2/3)) / 1.024 m.\n\nThis gives us the final formula for γ₁.
