We need to write these matrices explicitly and confirm that the basis vectors are eigenvectors of P_z. The matrix form of P_x is given as: P_x = [[0, \u0127/\u221a2, 0], [\u0127/\u221a2, 0, \u0127/\u221a2], [0, \u0127/\u221a2, 0]]. The matrix form of P_y is given as: P_y = [[0, -i\u0127/\u221a2, 0], [i\u0127/\u221a2, 0, -i\u0127/\u221a2], [0, i\u0127/\u221a2, 0]]. The matrix form of P_z is given as: P_z = [[\u0127, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -\u0127]]. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which means they should satisfy the eigenvalue equation P_z |v\u27e9 = \u03bb|v\u27e9 for some eigenvalue \u03bb. The given basis vectors are the standard basis vectors in this context, which are typically |1\u27e9 = [1, 0, 0], |2\u27e9 = [0, 1, 0], and |3\u27e9 = [0, 0, 1]. Applying P_z to these vectors, we find: P_z |1\u27e9 = \u0127|1\u27e9, P_z |2\u27e9 = 0|2\u27e9, and P_z |3\u27e9 = -\u0127|3\u27e9. Therefore, the basis vectors are indeed eigenvectors of P_z with eigenvalues \u0127, 0, and -\u0127, respectively.; answer - The operators in matrix form are: P_x = [[0, \u0127/\u221a2, 0], [\u0127/\u221a2, 0, \u0127/\u221a2], [0, \u0127/\u221a2, 0]], P_y = [[0, -i\u0127/\u221a2, 0], [i\u0127/\u221a2, 0, -i\u0127/\u221a2], [0, i\u0127/\u221a2, 0]], P_z = [[\u0127, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -\u0127]]. The basis vectors are eigenvectors of P_z with eigenvalues \u0127, 0, and -\u0127.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - We are given that the system is in the eigenstate of P_x corresponding to the eigenvalue -\u0127, and the explicit form of this state is given as the column vector (-1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2). This column vector is already expressed in the basis of the eigenvectors of P_z, as confirmed in Sub-task 1. The basis vectors for P_z were identified as |1\u27e9 = [1, 0, 0], |2\u27e9 = [0, 1, 0], and |3\u27e9 = [0, 0, 1], with corresponding eigenvalues \u0127, 0, and -\u0127. The given state vector (-1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2) is already in this basis. Therefore, no further transformation is needed. The state is expressed as a linear combination of the P_z eigenvectors: |\u03c8\u27e9 = (-1/2)|1\u27e9 + (1/\u221a2)|2\u27e9 + (-1/2)|3\u27e9. This confirms that the state is in the correct basis and corresponds to the eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -\u0127.; answer - The state vector (-1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2) is already expressed in the P_z eigenbasis and corresponds to the eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -\u0127 as given.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - To calculate the expectation value \u27e8Pz\u27e9, we need to perform the matrix multiplication of the state vector with the Pz operator and then take the inner product with the state vector. The state vector is given as |\u03c8\u27e9 = (-1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2).

Substituting these values into the formula gives \u0394Pz = sqrt(\u0127\u00b2/2 - 0\u00b2) = sqrt(\u0127\u00b2/2) = \u0127/\u221a2.
