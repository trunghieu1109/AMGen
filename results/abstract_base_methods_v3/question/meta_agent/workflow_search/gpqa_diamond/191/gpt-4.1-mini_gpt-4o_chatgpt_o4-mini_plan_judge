Question: Example(question='Imagine an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ having a small spherical cavity inside. The centre of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the centre of the spherical conductor. The radius of the cavity is $r$, and $r<R$. Now consider a small amount of positive charge $+q$ is somehow placed somewhere inside the cavity. What is the magnitude of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at a point P (outside the spherical conductor) of distance $L$ from the centre of the spherical conductor? Note, the distance of the point P from the centre of the cavity is $l$. Here, l, L > R. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\\theta$\n', choice1='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n', choice2='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n', choice3='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\n', choice4='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: The derived expression for the magnitude of the electric field E at point P, as concluded by the Final Decision Agent, is E = (1/(4 \pi \epsilon_0)) (q/L^2). This expression indicates that the electric field at a point outside the spherical conductor behaves as if the charge +q were at the center of the conductor, due to the conductor's electrostatic shielding and charge redistribution. Among the given multiple-choice options, choice 4) E = \dfrac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_o} \dfrac{q}{L^2} matches the derived expression. The other choices involve different dependencies on distances l and s, or angles, which do not apply to the field outside the conductor according to the symmetry and electrostatic shielding properties. Therefore, the correct formula for the magnitude of the electric field at point P is represented by choice 4.
