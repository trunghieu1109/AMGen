proposed answer: All agents agree that from Sub-task 3, the mass dimension of \( \kappa \) is -1. From Sub-task 4, it was concluded that the theory is not renormalizable because the mass dimension of \( \kappa \) is negative. The correct choice must reflect both the mass dimension of \( \kappa \) as -1 and the fact that the theory is not renormalizable. Among the given choices, choice 3 states 'The mass dimension \( \left[\kappa\right]_{M}=-1. The theory is not renormalizable.', which matches these conclusions. Therefore, choice C is the correct answer.
