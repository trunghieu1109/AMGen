Question: Example(question='A vector field f(r) falls off radially as 1/r^2 from the origin, i.e. the magnitude of the field is f(r) = 1/r^2. The field has non-zero component only along  the radial direction in spherical coordinates. Evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of the field, ∇.f inside the volume of a sphere of radius R centred at the origin. Here, ∇ and f both are implied as vectors. Which answer below is the most appropriate one for the answer of the integral?', choice1='1', choice2='4 π', choice3='0', choice4='4/3 π R ', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: The vector field f(r) = 1/r^2 is radial and has a singularity at the origin. The divergence of this field is zero everywhere except at the origin. When applying the Divergence Theorem, the surface integral over the sphere of radius R gives 4π, which accounts for the singularity at the origin. The direct volume integral of the divergence would be zero if not considering the singularity, but the correct interpretation is that the singularity contributes a distributional term, making the volume integral equal to the surface integral, which is 4π.
