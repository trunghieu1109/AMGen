Question: Example(question='You tag the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with a GFP and deliver them to mice via oral gavage. By in vivo imaging, you observe that some of the fluorescence was destroyed by the stomach acid, and some were entangled in the intestinal mucus before they reached the secondary lymphoid organs. You identify the fluorescent Peyer patches and isolate the proliferating cell population. You sequence their variable heavy chain gene and observe high variability. Which process is taking place?', choice1='somatic hypermutation', choice2='complement activation', choice3='class switching recombination', choice4='VDJ recombination', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_87
proposed answer: The high variability observed in the variable heavy chain gene sequences from the proliferating cells in Peyer's patches is indicative of somatic hypermutation. This process introduces point mutations into the variable regions of immunoglobulin genes, leading to a diverse array of antibodies, which is crucial for affinity maturation. The other processes listed do not account for the observed high variability: complement activation is an innate immune response, class switching recombination affects the constant region, and VDJ recombination occurs earlier in B cell development. All agents agree that the correct process is somatic hypermutation, which corresponds to choice A.
