For this reaction to occur, the center-of-mass energy of the two photons must be at least equal to the rest mass energy of the electron-positron pair, which is 2 * 0.511 MeV = 1.022 MeV. The energy of the CMB photon is given as 10^-3 eV, which is much smaller than the energy of the gamma-ray photon. In the center-of-mass frame, the energy of the gamma-ray photon must be high enough to compensate for the low energy of the CMB photon to reach the threshold of 1.022 MeV. The energy threshold condition can be derived from the conservation of energy and momentum, leading to the requirement that the product of the energies of the two photons must be at least (m_e c^2)^2, where m_e is the electron mass. Solving for the gamma-ray energy, we find that E_gamma * E_CMB >= (0.511 MeV)^2, and since E_CMB = 10^-3 eV, we can solve for E_gamma.; answer - The energy threshold for the gamma-ray photon is approximately 2.6*1e5 GeV.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - The threshold energy condition for the reaction \\( \\gamma \\gamma \\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-} \\) is derived from the conservation of energy and momentum.
