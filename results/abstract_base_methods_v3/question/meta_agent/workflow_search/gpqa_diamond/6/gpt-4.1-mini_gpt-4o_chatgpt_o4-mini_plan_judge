Question: Example(question='The universe is filled with the Cosmic Microwave Background. Consider the annihilation of high energy \\gamma-rays with a photon from the CMB Radiation into electron-positron, i.e. $\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$. From what energy \\gamma-rays would have their lifetimes in the universe limited by this process? Knowing that the average photon energy of the CMB is $10^{-3}eV$.', choice1='9.5*1e4 GeV', choice2='1.8*1e5 GeV', choice3='2.6*1e5 GeV', choice4='3.9*1e5 GeV', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_6
proposed answer: The calculated threshold energy for the process \( \gamma\gamma\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-} \) is 2.6 * 10^5 GeV. This value is directly compared to the multiple-choice options provided: A) 9.5*1e4 GeV, B) 1.8*1e5 GeV, C) 2.6*1e5 GeV, and D) 3.9*1e5 GeV. The option C) 2.6*1e5 GeV exactly matches the calculated threshold energy. Therefore, option C is the closest and correct choice as it directly corresponds to the calculated energy threshold.
