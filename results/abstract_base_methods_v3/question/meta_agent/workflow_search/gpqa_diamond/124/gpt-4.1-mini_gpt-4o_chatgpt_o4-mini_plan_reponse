        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The potential given is V(r) = (1/2) m \\omega^2 r^2, which is a quadratic potential in the radial distance r. This form is characteristic of a harmonic oscillator potential, where the force is proportional to the displacement and acts towards the equilibrium position, following Hooke's law. The system is described as isotropic, meaning the potential is the same in all directions, which is typical for a 3D harmonic oscillator. Therefore, the system is a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator.; answer - The system is a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator with potential V(r) = (1/2) m \\omega^2 r^2.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - The energy eigenvalues for a 3D isotropic quantum harmonic oscillator are given by the formula E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) \\hbar \\omega, where n_x, n_y, and n_z are non-negative integers representing the quantum numbers for each spatial dimension. This formula accounts for the energy contributions from each dimension of the oscillator, and the term 3/2 \\hbar \\omega represents the zero-point energy of the system.; answer - The energy eigenvalues for a 3D isotropic quantum harmonic oscillator are given by E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) \\hbar \\omega, where n_x, n_y, and n_z are the quantum numbers.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - In a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are determined by the sum of the quantum numbers n_x, n_y, and n_z. The ground state corresponds to n_x + n_y + n_z = 0, the first excited state to n_x + n_y + n_z = 1, the second excited state to n_x + n_y + n_z = 2, and so on. Therefore, the third excited state corresponds to n_x + n_y + n_z = 3. Using the formula for the energy eigenvalues, E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) \\hbar \\omega, we substitute n_x + n_y + n_z = 3 to get E = (3 + 3/2) \\hbar \\omega = (9/2) \\hbar \\omega. To find the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions, we count the number of ways to distribute 3 quanta among n_x, n_y, and n_z, which is given by the number of partitions of 3 into three non-negative integers. The possible combinations are (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3), (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (1,0,2), (0,2,1), (0,1,2), and (1,1,1), totaling 10 combinations. Therefore, there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions.; answer - (9/2) \\hbar \\omega , 10\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - In a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are determined by the sum of the quantum numbers n_x, n_y, and n_z. The degeneracy of a given energy level is determined by the number of ways to distribute a total of n = n_x + n_y + n_z quanta among the three dimensions. For the third excited state, n = 3. The degeneracy is given by the number of partitions of 3 into three non-negative integers, which corresponds to the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions. The possible combinations are (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3), (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (1,0,2), (0,2,1), (0,1,2), and (1,1,1), totaling 10 combinations. Therefore, there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions for the third excited state. This is consistent with the degeneracy formula (n+1)(n+2)/2 for n = 3, which also gives 10.; answer - 10\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - The problem involves a quantum mechanical system with a particle in an isotropic 3D harmonic oscillator potential.
