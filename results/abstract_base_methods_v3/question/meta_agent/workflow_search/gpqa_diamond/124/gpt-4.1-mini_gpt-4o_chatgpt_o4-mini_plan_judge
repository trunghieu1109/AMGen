Question: Example(question='Consider a quantum mechanical system containing a particle of mass $m$ moving in an istropic three dimensional potential of the form $V(r) = 1/2 m \\omega^2 r^2$ corresponding to the acted force obeying Hookeâ€™s law. Here, $\\omega$ is the angular frequency of oscillation and $r$ is the radial distance of the particle from the origin in spherical polar coordinate. What is the value of energy of the third excited state, and how many linearly independent eigenfunctions are possible for the same energy eigenvalue?', choice1='(9/2) \\hbar \\omega , 10', choice2='(9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 3', choice3='11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 10', choice4='11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 3', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_7_124
proposed answer: The problem involves a quantum mechanical system with a particle in an isotropic 3D harmonic oscillator potential. The energy of the third excited state was calculated as (9/2) \hbar \omega, and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions (degeneracy) was determined to be 10. The correct multiple-choice option must match both the calculated energy and the degeneracy. Among the given choices, choice1: '(9/2) \hbar \omega , 10' matches both the energy eigenvalue and the degeneracy calculated in the sub-tasks. All debate agents agree that choice1 is the correct answer based on the calculations and reasoning provided.
