Question: Example(question='Consider a system with Hamiltonian operator $H = \\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n}$. Here, $\\vec{n}$ is an arbitrary unit vector, $\\varepsilon $ is a constant of dimension energy, and components of $\\vec{\\sigma}$ are the Pauli spin matrices. What are the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator?\n', choice1='+ \\varepsilon, -\\varepsilon\n', choice2='+\\varepsilon \\hbar/2, - \\varepsilon \\hbar/2', choice3='+1, -1', choice4='+\\hbar/2, -\\hbar/2', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: The derived eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator $H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}$ are +\varepsilon and -\varepsilon. This is because the Pauli matrices \(\vec{\sigma}\) have eigenvalues of +1 and -1, and when scaled by \(\varepsilon\), the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian become +\varepsilon and -\varepsilon. Comparing these with the given multiple-choice options: Choice A) + \varepsilon, -\varepsilon matches exactly with the derived eigenvalues. The other choices involve additional factors such as \(\hbar\) or different numerical values, which do not match the derived eigenvalues. Therefore, the correct choice is A).
