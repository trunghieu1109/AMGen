According to the relativistic velocity addition formula, if an object moves with velocity u in a frame that itself is moving with velocity v, the velocity of the object in the stationary frame is given by (u + v) / (1 + uv/c^2). Here, u = 1/n and v = v. Since c = 1 in this context, the formula becomes (1/n + v) / (1 + (1/n)v). Simplifying this expression, we get (1 + nv) / (n + v).

Since the speed of light in vacuum is c=1, the speed of light inside the glass in the glass's rest frame is 1/n.

The speed of light in vacuum is c = 1, and the refractive index n reduces the speed of light in the medium by a factor of n.

In the rest frame of the glass, the speed of light is 1/n. The glass itself is moving with velocity v towards the observer. According to the relativistic velocity addition formula, if an object moves with velocity u in a frame that itself is moving with velocity v, the velocity of the object in the stationary frame is given by (u + v) / (1 + uv). Here, u = 1/n and v = v. Therefore, the speed of light relative to the observer is (1/n + v) / (1 + (1/n)v). Simplifying this expression, we get (1 + nv) / (n + v).; answer: (1+n*v)/(n+v)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCritic agent D48O, providing feedback, thinking: The application of the relativistic velocity addition formula is correct in this context. The formula is used to find the resultant velocity of an object when two velocities are involved, one being the velocity of the medium and the other being the velocity of light in the medium. The formula (u + v) / (1 + uv/c^2) is appropriate for combining velocities in special relativity, where u is the velocity of light in the medium (1/n) and v is the velocity of the medium (v). The simplification to (1 + nv) / (n + v) is also correct. However, the limitation of this formula is that it assumes the velocities are in the same direction and that the speeds involved are significant fractions of the speed of light, where relativistic effects are non-negligible. For small velocities compared to the speed of light, classical addition of velocities would suffice.; answer: The correct application of the relativistic velocity addition formula results in the speed of light relative to the observer being (1 + nv) / (n + v).\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent KYfg, refining relativistic velocity addition, thinking: To find the speed of light relative to the laboratory observer, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula.
