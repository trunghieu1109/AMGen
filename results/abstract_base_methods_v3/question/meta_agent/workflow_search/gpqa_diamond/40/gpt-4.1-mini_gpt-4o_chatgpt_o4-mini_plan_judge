Question: Example(question='A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory? Take the speed of light in vacuum c=1.', choice1='(1+n*v)/(n-v)\n\n\n', choice2='(1-n*v)/(n+v)\n\n', choice3='(1+n*v)/(n+v)\n\n', choice4='1', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_1_40
proposed answer: The derived formula for the speed of light in the glass relative to the laboratory observer is (1 + nv) / (n + v). This formula accounts for the relativistic addition of velocities, where the speed of light in the medium and the velocity of the medium itself are combined. Upon comparing this derived formula with the provided multiple-choice options, we find that Choice 3: (1+n*v)/(n+v) matches exactly with the derived formula. The other options either have different numerators or denominators, or do not reflect the correct relativistic velocity addition principle. Therefore, the correct choice that matches the derived formula is Choice 3.
