proposed answer: The mean free path of gas molecules (λ1) is determined by their interactions with each other, which depend on factors such as pressure and temperature. When an electron beam is introduced, the mean free path for electron scattering (λ2) is affected by the interaction of electrons with gas molecules. Electrons, being much smaller and faster, have a smaller cross-section for interaction with gas molecules, resulting in a longer mean free path for electrons (λ2) compared to gas molecules (λ1). The 1.22 multiplier accounts for the difference in interaction cross-sections and the higher energy of electrons, suggesting that λ2 is likely to be greater than or equal to 1.22 times λ1. This aligns with the physics of electron scattering in ultra-high vacuum environments, making option D) 'λ2 >= 1.22*λ1' the correct choice.

proposed answer: The mean free path λ1 is determined by the scattering cross-section for gas molecules, while λ2 is determined by the electron scattering cross-section. In high-energy electron beams, like those at 1000 kV, electrons have much smaller scattering cross-sections compared to gas molecules. This results in λ2 being larger than λ1 because electrons interact less frequently with gas molecules. The choice 'λ2 >= 1.22*λ1' (choice D) aligns with the understanding that λ2 is greater than λ1 due to the reduced probability of interaction for electrons. Although the exact multiplier like 1.22 is not empirically justified without specific data, the qualitative understanding is that λ2 is greater than λ1. Therefore, the choice D is the most appropriate based on the given options.
