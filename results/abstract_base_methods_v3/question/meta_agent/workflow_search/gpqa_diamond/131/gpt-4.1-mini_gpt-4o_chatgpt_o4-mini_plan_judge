Question: Example(question='The 1H NMR spectrum of a solution containing a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14 exhibits two signals (two singlets) at around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. There are also three signals at around 2.2 ppm (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio. Which two compounds are present in the mixture from the following options: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, and 1,4-diethylbenzene.', choice1='1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene', choice2='1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene', choice3='1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene', choice4='1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene', correct_index=4)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_131
proposed answer: The observed 1H NMR spectrum shows two aromatic singlets at around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio and three aliphatic singlets at around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio. This pattern suggests that the mixture contains two compounds with symmetrical substitution patterns that result in these specific ratios. 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene has a symmetrical substitution pattern that results in a single aromatic singlet due to equivalent aromatic protons, and its methyl groups are in equivalent environments, leading to two aliphatic singlets in a 2:1 ratio. 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene also has a symmetrical substitution pattern, resulting in a single aromatic singlet, and its methyl groups are in three different environments, leading to three aliphatic singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio. The combination of these two compounds explains the observed NMR data: two aromatic singlets from each compound and three aliphatic singlets that match the integration ratios. Therefore, the compounds 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene are the ones present in the mixture.

proposed answer: The NMR spectrum shows two aromatic singlets at ~6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio, indicating two sets of equivalent aromatic protons. The three aliphatic singlets at ~2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio suggest different environments for the methyl groups. 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene has symmetrical substitution, leading to a single aromatic singlet and equivalent methyl groups, which contribute to the 2:1:1 aliphatic signal ratio. 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene has two sets of equivalent aromatic protons, matching the aromatic singlet signals, and its methyl groups contribute to the 2:1:1 ratio. The symmetry and substitution patterns of these two compounds collectively explain the observed NMR data. Other combinations do not satisfy the integration and symmetry requirements for both aromatic and aliphatic protons as observed. Therefore, the correct pair of compounds is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.
