Traps can affect carrier transport by temporarily immobilizing carriers, which would alter the current characteristics.\n\n2) Single-carrier transport: This refers to a situation where only one type of charge carrier (either electrons or holes) is responsible for the current in the device. The Mott-Gurney equation assumes single-carrier transport to simplify the analysis.\n\n3) Ohmic contact: An Ohmic contact is a type of electrical contact that allows charge carriers to flow freely between the metal and the semiconductor without any energy barrier. This means there is no potential barrier to carrier injection, and the current-voltage relationship is linear at low biases.\n\n4) Schottky contact: A Schottky contact is a metal-semiconductor junction that has a built-in potential barrier for carrier injection. This barrier can impede carrier flow, unlike an Ohmic contact.\n\n5) Carrier injection barrier: This refers to any potential energy barrier at the contact that impedes the injection of carriers from the contact into the semiconductor. An Ohmic contact has no such barrier, whereas a Schottky contact does.\n\n6) Drift current: This is the current due to the motion of charge carriers under the influence of an electric field. In the Mott-Gurney equation, the current is primarily due to drift.\n\n7) Diffusion current: This is the current due to the movement of carriers from regions of high concentration to regions of low concentration.

These concepts are crucial for understanding the conditions under which the Mott-Gurney equation can be applied.; answer: A trap-free device is one that lacks defect states that capture and release carriers. Single-carrier transport involves only one type of charge carrier, either electrons or holes. An Ohmic contact allows free flow of carriers with no significant energy barrier, while a Schottky contact has an energy barrier that impedes carrier injection. A carrier injection barrier prevents easy flow of carriers into the device.
