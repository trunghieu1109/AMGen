Question: Example(question="Compounds that have the same molecular formula but are different in their structural arrangement are known as isomers. Isomers have two types, constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but differ in their structures. In stereoisomers, molecules are connected in the same way, but their arrangements in space are different.\nWhich of the following organic moieties show optical isomerism?\n\n1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate\n2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n3. benzophenone\n4. dimethyl fumarate", choice1='2 and 3', choice2='1 and 2', choice3='3 and 4', choice4='1, 2 and 4', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_7_116
proposed answer: All agents agree that compounds 1 (dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate) and 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) exhibit optical isomerism. Compound 1 shows optical isomerism due to axial chirality, and compound 2 has a chiral center. Compounds 3 (benzophenone) and 4 (dimethyl fumarate) do not exhibit optical isomerism as they lack chiral centers. Comparing this classification with the multiple-choice options, choice 2 ('1 and 2') correctly lists the compounds that show optical isomerism. Therefore, the correct answer is choice 2.
