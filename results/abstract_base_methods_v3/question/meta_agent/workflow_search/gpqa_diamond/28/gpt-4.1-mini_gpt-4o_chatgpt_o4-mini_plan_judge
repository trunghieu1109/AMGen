Question: Example(question='You have an interesting drought-resistant cultivar of barley, which, unfortunately, contains an anti-nutritional compound. This compound makes it impossible to use this cultivar for food purposes. After an extensive investigation, you discover the gene responsible for the synthesis of this compound. This gene consists of five exons and four introns. You decide to use old-school approaches and produce a collection of mutants using EMS chemical mutagen. You sequence a target gene in all mutant lines and discover some changes at the beginning of its sequence in the first exon area. Which of the following mutations will most probably let you eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the cultivar?\n\nIntact gene:\n5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’\n\nMutant 1:\n5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’\nMutant 2:\n5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’\nMutant 3:\n5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’\nMutant 4:\n5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’<b>', choice1='Mutant 2', choice2='Mutant 4', choice3='Mutant 1', choice4='Mutant 3', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: To determine which mutant line most probably eliminates the anti-nutritional compound, we need to identify the mutation that disrupts the gene's function, leading to a nonfunctional protein. A frameshift mutation or a premature stop codon can cause such a disruption. Analyzing the mutants: Mutant 1 has a synonymous mutation, which does not change the amino acid sequence and is unlikely to affect protein function. Mutant 2 has a missense mutation, changing one amino acid, but it does not introduce a stop codon or cause a frameshift, so it might not abolish the gene's function. Mutant 3 also has a synonymous mutation, which does not affect the protein sequence. Mutant 4 appears to have a truncation or deletion that could lead to a frameshift, disrupting the reading frame and potentially introducing premature stop codons. This would likely result in a nonfunctional protein. Therefore, Mutant 4 is the most likely candidate to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound because the frameshift or truncation likely leads to a nonfunctional protein, thereby abolishing the gene's function.

proposed answer: The task is to select the mutant line most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound based on the mutations observed. The intact gene sequence is provided, along with the sequences of four mutants. The goal is to identify which mutation is most likely to result in a loss of function of the gene responsible for the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound. Mutant 1 has a synonymous mutation, which does not change the amino acid sequence and is unlikely to affect protein function. Mutant 2 has a missense mutation, which changes one amino acid and may affect protein function, but it does not guarantee a complete loss of function. Mutants 3 and 4 both have frameshift mutations, which are known to cause significant disruptions in protein function by altering the reading frame, potentially introducing premature stop codons or drastically changing the protein structure. This often results in a nonfunctional protein. Among these, Mutant 4 introduces a frameshift early in the sequence, which is more likely to cause a significant disruption in protein function compared to Mutant 3, where the frameshift occurs slightly later. Therefore, Mutant 4 is the most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound due to the early and severe disruption of the gene's coding sequence.
