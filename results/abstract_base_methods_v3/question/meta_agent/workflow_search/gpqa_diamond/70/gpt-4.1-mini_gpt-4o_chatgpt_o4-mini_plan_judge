Question: Example(question='Astronomers are studying a system of five exoplanets with circular orbits, discovered through the TTV method. The planets (designated as Planet_1 through Planet_5), which are in orbital resonance, have orbital periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Assuming these planets possess the same albedo, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2?', choice1='~0.75', choice2='~0.83', choice3='~0.69', choice4='~0.57', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_6_70
proposed answer: All agents have calculated the equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet_4 and Planet_2 to be approximately 0.83. This calculation is based on the relationship between temperature and orbital radius, assuming the planets have the same albedo. The multiple-choice options provided are ~0.75, ~0.83, ~0.69, and ~0.57. The calculated value of 0.83 matches exactly with option B) ~0.83. Therefore, option B is the closest matching choice and is consistent with the calculations performed by all agents.
