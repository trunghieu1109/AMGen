This means if we let the orbital period of Planet_1 be T, then the orbital periods of the planets are as follows: Planet_1 = T, Planet_2 = 2T, Planet_3 = 2.5T, Planet_4 = 3.5T, and Planet_5 = 5T. We are specifically interested in the orbital periods of Planet_2 and Planet_4. Based on the given ratio, the orbital period of Planet_2 is 2T and the orbital period of Planet_4 is 3.5T.; answer - The orbital period of Planet_2 is 2T and the orbital period of Planet_4 is 3.5T.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - Kepler's third law states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (T) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of the orbit (a), which for circular orbits is the orbital radius. Mathematically, this is expressed as T^2 ∝ a^3. Therefore, if we know the ratio of the orbital periods of two planets, we can determine the ratio of their orbital radii by taking the cube root of the square of the period ratio. This relationship is crucial for determining the relative distances of the planets from their star based on their orbital periods.; answer - According to Kepler's third law, for planets in circular orbits around the same star, the square of the orbital period (T) is proportional to the cube of the orbital radius (a). Thus, T^2 ∝ a^3.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - From sub-task 1, we know the orbital periods of Planet_2 and Planet_4 are 2T and 3.5T, respectively. According to Kepler's third law, T^2 ∝ a^3, where T is the orbital period and a is the orbital radius. To find the ratio of the orbital radii, we use the relationship (T_4 / T_2)^2 = (a_4 / a_2)^3. Substituting the given periods, we have (3.5T / 2T)^2 = (a_4 / a_2)^3. Simplifying, (3.5 / 2)^2 = (a_4 / a_2)^3. Calculating, (3.5 / 2)^2 = (7/4)^2 = 49/16. Therefore, (a_4 / a_2)^3 = 49/16. Taking the cube root, a_4 / a_2 = (49/16)^(1/3). This calculation assumes the central star's mass is much larger than the planets' masses, which is typical for exoplanet systems. It also assumes circular orbits and neglects any perturbations or interactions between the planets.; answer - (49/16)^(1/3)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - The equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by the formula T_eq ∝ (1 / sqrt(a)), where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since the planets are in orbital resonance and have circular orbits, their orbital periods are related to their semi-major axes by Kepler's third law: T^2 ∝ a^3. Therefore, a ∝ T^(2/3). The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between two planets is then T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (a2 / a1)^(1/2). Given the orbital period ratio of Planet_4 to Planet_2 is 3.5:2, the semi-major axis ratio is (3.5/2)^(2/3). The temperature ratio is then (2/3.5)^(1/2 * 2/3) = (2/3.5)^(1/3). Calculating this gives approximately 0.83.; answer - ~0.83\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - To calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 to Planet_2, we use the relationship that the equilibrium temperature (T_eq) is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital radius (a), i.e., T_eq ∝ 1/sqrt(a). From sub-task 3, we have the ratio of the orbital radii a_4/a_2 = (49/16)^(1/3). Therefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures T_eq4/T_eq2 is given by (a_2/a_4)^(1/2) = ((49/16)^(1/3))^(-1/2). Simplifying, this is equal to (16/49)^(1/6). Calculating this gives approximately 0.83.
