Question: Example(question='A synchrocyclotron is a special type of cyclotron. A proton is injected at \\$t=0\\$ with negligible kinetic energy, i.e. \\$T\\simeq0\\$ undergoes two accelerations in the accelerator to reach the kinetic energy \\$T{1}=950MeV\\$. The alternating voltage applied in the accelerator is given by\nU\\left(t\\right)=U{0}\\cos\\left[2\\pi\\nu\\left(\\alpha\\right)t+\\Phi_{0}\\right].\n\nHow many revolutions does the proton make in the synchrocyclotron?\nData : \\$\\Phi{0}=\\frac{\\pi}{4},U{0}=190kV\\$. ', choice1='1864', choice2='2500', choice3='3536', choice4='5300', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_136
proposed answer: All agents have calculated the total number of revolutions required for the proton to reach the kinetic energy of 950 MeV as 3536. This number matches the provided multiple-choice option C) 3536. Since all agents agree on this calculation and the match with option C, the correct answer choice is C.

Answer:C)
Extracted answer: C)
