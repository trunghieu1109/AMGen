        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - Spontaneously-broken symmetry refers to a situation in a physical system where the underlying laws possess a certain symmetry, but the state of the system does not exhibit that symmetry. In the context of effective particles, this often leads to the emergence of collective excitations or quasiparticles that are associated with the broken symmetry. For example, in a ferromagnet, the rotational symmetry is spontaneously broken, leading to magnons as the associated quasiparticles. In particle physics, the breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics leads to pions as the associated particles. Phonons are associated with the breaking of translational symmetry in crystals. Skyrmions, however, are topological solitons and are not directly associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry in the same way as the others.; answer - Spontaneously-broken symmetry in the context of effective particles refers to a situation where the system's ground state does not exhibit the symmetry of the underlying laws, leading to the emergence of quasiparticles associated with the broken symmetry. Examples include magnons, pions, and phonons, which are associated with broken rotational, chiral, and translational symmetries, respectively. Skyrmions are not directly associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry in this context.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - Magnons are quasiparticles that arise in the context of magnetically ordered systems, such as ferromagnets, where the rotational symmetry is spontaneously broken. Pions are particles associated with the breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics, where the chiral symmetry of the strong interaction is spontaneously broken. Phonons are quasiparticles that arise from the quantization of lattice vibrations in crystals and are associated with the breaking of translational symmetry. Skyrmions, on the other hand, are topological solitons that do not arise directly from spontaneously-broken symmetries but rather represent stable, localized configurations in certain field theories. Therefore, among the given particles, Skyrmions are not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry in the same way as magnons, pions, and phonons.; answer - Magnons arise in magnetically ordered systems with broken rotational symmetry. Pions are associated with chiral symmetry breaking in quantum chromodynamics. Phonons result from the quantization of lattice vibrations in crystals with broken translational symmetry. Skyrmions are topological solitons, not directly linked to spontaneously-broken symmetries like the others.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - Nambu-Goldstone bosons are particles that arise due to spontaneously-broken continuous symmetries. Magnons are associated with the breaking of rotational symmetry in magnetically ordered systems, making them Nambu-Goldstone bosons. Pions are associated with the breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics, and they are also considered Nambu-Goldstone bosons. Phonons arise from the quantization of lattice vibrations in crystals, which can be related to the breaking of translational symmetry, and they can be considered as Nambu-Goldstone modes in this context. Skyrmions, however, are topological solitons and do not arise from spontaneously-broken continuous symmetries in the same way, so they are not Nambu-Goldstone bosons. The limitation in the previous evaluation is that it could have provided more detail on the nature of skyrmions as topological solitons and the specific conditions under which phonons are considered Nambu-Goldstone modes.; answer - Magnons, pions, and phonons are associated with spontaneously-broken symmetries and can be considered Nambu-Goldstone bosons. Skyrmions are not associated with spontaneously-broken symmetries in this context.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - All the agents agree that magnons, pions, and phonons are associated with spontaneously-broken symmetries and can be considered Nambu-Goldstone bosons. Magnons are linked to the breaking of rotational symmetry, pions to the breaking of chiral symmetry, and phonons to the breaking of translational symmetry. Skyrmions, however, are topological solitons and do not arise from spontaneously-broken continuous symmetries, which means they are not Nambu-Goldstone bosons. Therefore, Skyrmions are not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry, unlike the other particles mentioned.; answer - Skyrmion\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - The original question asks which particle is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry.
