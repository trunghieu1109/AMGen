They are associated with the spontaneously-broken rotational symmetry of the spin system. When a ferromagnet is magnetized, the rotational symmetry is broken, and magnons are the resulting quasiparticles that describe collective excitations of the spins. Pions are particles that arise in the context of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) as the Goldstone bosons associated with the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry. In QCD, the chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken, and pions emerge as the associated particles. Phonons are quasiparticles associated with lattice vibrations in a crystal. They arise due to the breaking of continuous translational symmetry in the formation of a crystal lattice. Skyrmions, on the other hand, are topological solitons that arise in certain field theories and magnetic systems. They are not directly associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry in the same way as magnons, pions, and phonons. Skyrmions are characterized by their topological properties rather than being a result of a symmetry breaking.; answer: Magnons arise from the breaking of rotational symmetry in ferromagnets.
