Question: Example(question='Which of the following (effective) particles is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry?', choice1='Magnon', choice2='Skyrmion', choice3='Pion', choice4='Phonon', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_188
proposed answer: The original question asks which particle is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry. The sub-task analysis concluded that Skyrmions are not associated with spontaneously-broken symmetries, unlike magnons, pions, and phonons. In the provided multiple-choice options, 'Skyrmion' corresponds to choice B). Therefore, the correct answer is B).

Answer:B)
Extracted answer: B)
Correct answer: 2
