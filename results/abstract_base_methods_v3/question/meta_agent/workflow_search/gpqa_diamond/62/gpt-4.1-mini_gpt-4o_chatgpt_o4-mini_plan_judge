Question: Example(question='Let there be a diatomic molecule, with elements X and Y, that can be modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model (or non-rigid rotor model). If the molecule is in its fundamental state, what momentum should an absorbed photon have, in order for the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy?\nMx: mass of atom X = 20 amu\nMy: mass of atom Y = 2 amu\nR: molecular bond length = 2 angstroms\nw: angular frequency of vibration = 4*10^14 rad/s', choice1='p = 2.3*10^(-27) N*s', choice2='p = 1.9*10^(-28) N*s', choice3='p = 1.1*10^(-27) N*s', choice4='p = 1.4*10^(-28) N*s', correct_index=4)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_47_62
proposed answer: The calculated photon momentum p is 6.63 × 10^(-31) kg*m/s, which is equivalent to 6.63 × 10^(-31) N*s. This value does not directly match any of the given multiple-choice options. However, the closest option in terms of order of magnitude and potential rounding or assumptions in the problem setup is 'p = 1.4*10^(-28) N*s'. This choice is the closest to the calculated value when considering the context and possible approximations.
