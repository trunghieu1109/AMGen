Question: Example(question='An electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is also moving along the horizontal axis, but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After colliding, both annihilate producing 2 photons.\n\nThe energies of both photons were measured and they have the same value. The directions were also measured. One of the photons was moving in the upper-right direction, while another in the lower-right direction.\n\nWhat is the angle between the directions of the photons?', choice1='96', choice2='74', choice3='138', choice4='172', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_19_114
proposed answer: In Sub-task 6, it was calculated that the angle between the directions of the two photons is 138 degrees. The multiple-choice options provided are 96°, 74°, 138°, and 172°. The calculated angle of 138 degrees matches exactly with the option '138°'. Therefore, the correct answer is the option that matches the calculated angle, which is 138°.
