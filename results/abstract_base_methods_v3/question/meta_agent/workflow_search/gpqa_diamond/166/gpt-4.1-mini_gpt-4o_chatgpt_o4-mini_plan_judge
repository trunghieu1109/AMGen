proposed answer: The computed non-Gaussianity value del_b from sub-task 6 is 0.25. We need to compare this value with the provided multiple-choice options: 2.48, 0, 1.38, and 0.25. The value 0.25 matches exactly with one of the options provided, which is choice 4. Therefore, the correct choice that corresponds to the computed non-Gaussianity value is 0.25.

proposed answer: In subtask 7, the computed non-Gaussianity value delta_b was found to be 0.25. We need to compare this value with the provided multiple-choice options: 2.48, 0, 1.38, and 0.25. The value 0.25 exactly matches one of the options provided. Therefore, the correct choice corresponding to the closest numerical value is 0.25.
