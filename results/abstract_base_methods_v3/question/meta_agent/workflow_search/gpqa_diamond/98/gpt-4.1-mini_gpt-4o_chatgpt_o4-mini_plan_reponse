The complex splitting patterns observed, such as a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets, suggest the presence of hydrogens in environments with multiple neighboring hydrogens, leading to complex coupling. The doublet of triplets of quartets could arise from a hydrogen that is coupled to three different sets of nonequivalent hydrogens, such as a hydrogen on a methine carbon with neighboring methyl and methylene groups. The doublet of triplets of triplets could indicate a hydrogen with two sets of neighboring hydrogens, possibly on a carbon adjacent to an ethyl group.

The complex splitting suggests a branched structure consistent with the carboxylic acid identified in the FTIR spectrum.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - To interpret the complex splitting patterns observed in the 1H NMR spectrum, we need to consider the nature of the substituents and their coupling environments. The doublet of triplets of quartets suggests a proton that is coupled to several other protons, possibly in a methyl or methylene group with additional coupling to another group. Similarly, the doublet of triplets of triplets indicates a proton with a similar but slightly different coupling environment. The presence of these complex splitting patterns, along with the absence of vinyl hydrogens, suggests a highly branched aliphatic compound. The FTIR spectrum confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid group. Given the choices, we can rule out compounds with simpler alkyl chains, as they would not produce such complex splitting. The compound CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH is likely due to its branching and the presence of multiple methyl groups, which can cause the observed complex splitting patterns.
