Question: Example(question='You have prepared an unknown compound. To identify the product, you have used the following characterisation techniques: FTIR and 1H NMR. The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers. A strong absorption peak is also observed at 1700 wavenumbers. Several peaks were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum, none of which are correspond to vinyl-hydrogens. One of the signals in the 1H NMR is a doublet of triplets of quartets whilst a different signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Identify the compound as either, CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH, CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH, CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH, or CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH', choice1='CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH', choice2='CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH', choice3='CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH', choice4='CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: All agents agree that the compound is CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH, which corresponds to choice D. The FTIR spectrum shows a broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹, indicating an O-H stretch typical of carboxylic acids, and a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹, indicating a C=O stretch. The 1H NMR spectrum shows complex splitting patterns with no vinyl hydrogens, suggesting the absence of alkenes. The complex splitting patterns suggest methine hydrogens next to ethyl groups. The compound CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH fits these spectral data, as it contains methine hydrogens with ethyl group neighbors, leading to the observed NMR splitting, and matches the FTIR data for a carboxylic acid. Therefore, the correct multiple-choice answer is D.

proposed answer: The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid group, as evidenced by the broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ (O-H stretch) and the strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ (C=O stretch). The 1H NMR spectrum shows complex splitting patterns, such as a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets, which suggest a highly branched aliphatic compound with multiple methyl groups. The absence of vinyl hydrogens confirms the compound is fully saturated. Among the given options, CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH fits these observations as it contains a carboxylic acid group and a branched structure with multiple methyl groups, leading to the observed NMR splitting patterns. The other options either have simpler alkyl chains or do not match the NMR data as well. Therefore, the most consistent assignment is CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH, which corresponds to choice B.
