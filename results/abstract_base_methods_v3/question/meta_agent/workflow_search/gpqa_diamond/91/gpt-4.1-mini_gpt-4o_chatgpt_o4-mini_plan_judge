Question: Example(question='Calculate the enthalpy of formation of (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Given,\nEnthalpy of atomization of carbon = 1000 kJ/mol.\nBond energy of H-H = 100 kJ/mol\nBond energy of C-C = 200 kJ/mol\nBond energy of C=C = 300 kJ/mol\nBond energy of C-H = 400 kJ/mol', choice1='11200 kJ/mol', choice2='1900 kJ/g', choice3='11.44 kJ/g', choice4='67.4 kJ/mol', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_91
proposed answer: The calculated enthalpy of formation is 9800 kJ/mol. The multiple-choice options are: A) 11200 kJ/mol, B) 1900 kJ/g, C) 11.44 kJ/g, and D) 67.4 kJ/mol. The calculated value is in kJ/mol, so we should compare it with options A and D. Option A is 11200 kJ/mol, which is the closest to the calculated value of 9800 kJ/mol. Option D is 67.4 kJ/mol, which is significantly different. The other options are in kJ/g, which are not directly comparable. Therefore, the most reasonable choice is option A, as it is the closest match in the correct units.
