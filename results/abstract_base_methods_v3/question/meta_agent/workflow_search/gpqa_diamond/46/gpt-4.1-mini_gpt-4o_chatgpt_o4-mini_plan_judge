Iteration: abstracted_workflow_5_46
proposed answer: The IR spectrum shows N-H stretching bands at 3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1, indicating an amine group, and a strong C=O stretching band at 1720 cm-1, suggesting a carbonyl group, likely an ester. The 1H NMR data indicates the presence of an ethyl group (triplet at 1.20 ppm and quartet at 4.5 ppm), an NH2 group (broad singlet at 4.0 ppm), and a para-substituted benzene ring (doublets at 7.0 ppm and 8.0 ppm). Among the choices, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate contains an ethyl ester, an NH2 group, and a para-substituted benzene, aligning with all spectral data and the molecular formula C9H11NO2. Therefore, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate is the most probable compound based on the spectral data analysis.
