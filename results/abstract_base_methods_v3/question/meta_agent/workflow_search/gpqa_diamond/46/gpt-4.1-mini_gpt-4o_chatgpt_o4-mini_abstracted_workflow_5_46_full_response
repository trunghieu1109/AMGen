Among the choices, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate contains an ethyl ester, an NH2 group, and a para-substituted benzene, aligning with all spectral data and the molecular formula C9H11NO2. Therefore, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate is the most probable compound based on the spectral data analysis.; answer: D", iteration_idx=-1)]
