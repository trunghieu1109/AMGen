proposed answer: All debate agents agree that the paramagnetic coupling term ⟨H⟩ is much smaller than the transition energy ΔE, specifically by about 5 orders of magnitude. This indicates that the paramagnetic effect is negligible compared to the energy of the transition. Therefore, the correct choice that describes the relationship between ⟨H⟩ and ΔE is that ⟨H⟩ is much less than ΔE, which corresponds to choice A) \left\langle H\right\rangle \ll\Delta E.
