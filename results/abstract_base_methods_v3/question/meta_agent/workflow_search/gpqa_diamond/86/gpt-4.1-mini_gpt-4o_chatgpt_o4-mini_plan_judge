Question: Example(question='You have prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound containing 8 carbon atoms in total. Peaks in the FTIR spectrum of this compound indicate the presence of a carbonyl group as well as an aromatic-halogen bond. Identify the correct 1H NMR data for this compound. ', choice1='1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)', choice2='1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)', choice3='1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)', choice4='1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: The compound in question is a di-substituted aromatic ring with a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond, likely a benzoyl halide such as benzoyl chloride. The expected 1H NMR features for such a compound include aromatic protons appearing in the range of 7-8 ppm. The presence of electron-withdrawing groups like a carbonyl and halogen would cause the aromatic protons to appear as doublets due to splitting from neighboring protons, with each doublet integrating to 2H, consistent with a para-substitution pattern. Among the given choices, choice 4 shows peaks at 7.8 ppm and 7.6 ppm, each integrating to 2H, which matches the expected pattern for the compound. The other choices either include peaks in the aliphatic region or do not match the expected integration pattern. Therefore, choice 4 is the best match for the expected 1H NMR spectral characteristics of the compound.
