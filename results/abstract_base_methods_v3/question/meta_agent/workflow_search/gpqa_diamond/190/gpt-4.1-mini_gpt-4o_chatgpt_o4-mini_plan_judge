Question: Example(question='3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one is treated with sodium hydride, followed by benzyl bromide, forming product 1.\n\n1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide in the presence of a catalytic amount of HCl, forming product 2.\n\n2 is treated at low temperature with n-butyllithium, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride, forming product 3.\n\n3 is stirred with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere, forming product 4.\n\nWhat is the structure of product 4?', choice1='(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol', choice2="N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide", choice3='(((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene', choice4='3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_16_190
proposed answer: The deduced structure of product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol. This conclusion is reached by analyzing the reaction sequence: the initial benzyl protection of the hydroxyl group, followed by the formation of a tosylhydrazone, and then a Shapiro reaction leading to an isopropyl group. The final hydrogenation step with Pd/C removes the benzyl protecting group and reduces any double bonds, resulting in a saturated alcohol. Comparing this deduced structure with the multiple-choice options, choice 1, (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol, matches exactly. The other options either retain the benzyl group or include additional groups inconsistent with the final hydrogenation step. Therefore, the correct answer is choice 1.
