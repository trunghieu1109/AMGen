When this N-tosylhydrazone is treated with n-butyllithium at low temperature, a Shapiro reaction occurs. In the Shapiro reaction, the N-tosylhydrazone is deprotonated by the strong base (n-butyllithium), leading to the formation of a carbanion intermediate. This carbanion can then undergo elimination of the tosyl group, resulting in the formation of a diazo compound. The diazo compound can further decompose to form a carbenoid species, which can rearrange or react further.
