The equation is pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA]), where [A⁻] is the concentration of the base form and [HA] is the concentration of the acid form. In this case, H2PO4⁻ is the acid form (HA) and HPO4²⁻ is the base form (A⁻). The pKa for the dissociation of H2PO4⁻ to HPO4²⁻ is the negative logarithm of Ka2, which is 6.2x10^-8. Therefore, pKa = -log(6.2x10^-8) ≈ 7.21. The initial concentrations are [HPO4²⁻] = 0.0281 M and [H2PO4⁻] = 0.0368 M. Plugging these values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation gives: pH = 7.21 + log(0.0281/0.0368). Calculating the logarithm: log(0.0281/0.0368) = log(0.7644) ≈ -0.116.

The Henderson–Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA]), where [A⁻] is the concentration of the base (HPO4²⁻) and [HA] is the concentration of the acid (H2PO4⁻). From the previous sub-tasks, the initial concentration of HPO4²⁻ is 0.0281 M and the initial concentration of H2PO4⁻ is 0.0368 M. The pKa for the second dissociation (H2PO4⁻ to HPO4²⁻) is -log(Ka2) = -log(6.2x10^-8). Calculating this gives pKa2 = 7.21. Using the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation, we have pH = 7.21 + log(0.0281/0.0368). Calculating the log term, we get log(0.0281/0.0368) = log(0.7644) ≈ -0.116. Therefore, pH = 7.21 - 0.116 = 7.094.; answer: The pH of the solution is approximately 7.094.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent 45b7, calculating pH using Henderson–Hasselbalch equation, thinking: To calculate the pH of the solution using the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation, we use the expression: pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA]), where [A⁻] is the concentration of the base form and [HA] is the concentration of the acid form. In this case, HPO4²⁻ acts as the base (A⁻) and H2PO4⁻ acts as the acid (HA). The pKa is the negative logarithm of the Ka2 value, which is 6.2x10^-8. Therefore, pKa = -log(6.2x10^-8) ≈ 7.21. The initial concentrations given are [HPO4²⁻] = 0.0281 M and [H2PO4⁻] = 0.0368 M. Applying the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation: pH = 7.21 + log(0.0281/0.0368). Calculating the ratio: 0.0281/0.0368 ≈ 0.764. Taking the logarithm: log(0.764) ≈ -0.117. Therefore, pH = 7.21 - 0.117 = 7.093.; answer: The pH of the solution is approximately 7.09.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent pbmh, calculating pH using Henderson–Hasselbalch equation, thinking: To calculate the pH of the solution, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, which is applicable for buffer solutions. The equation is pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA]), where [A⁻] is the concentration of the base form and [HA] is the concentration of the acid form. In this case, H2PO4⁻ is the acid form (HA) and HPO4²⁻ is the base form (A⁻). The pKa for the dissociation of H2PO4⁻ to HPO4²⁻ is the negative logarithm of Ka2, which is 6.2x10^-8. Therefore, pKa = -log(6.2x10^-8) ≈ 7.21. The initial concentrations are [HPO4²⁻] = 0.0281 M and [H2PO4⁻] = 0.0368 M. Plugging these values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation gives: pH = 7.21 + log(0.0281/0.0368). Calculating the logarithm: log(0.0281/0.0368) = log(0.7644) ≈ -0.116.

Substituting the pH value, we get [H⁺] = 10^(-7.094). Calculating this gives [H⁺] ≈ 8.06 x 10^-8 M.
