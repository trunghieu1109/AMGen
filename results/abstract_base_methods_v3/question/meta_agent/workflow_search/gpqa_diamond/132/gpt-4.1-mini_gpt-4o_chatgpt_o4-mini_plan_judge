Question: Example(question='We have a solution which has the volume of 200.00 cm3 and contains 1.00 g KH2PO4 (Mw = 136.09 g/mol) and 1.00 g Na2HPO4●2H2O (Mw = 177.99 g/mol) (T = 25 °C). What is the concentration of orthophosphate ions in this solution? The Ka1, Ka2 and Ka3 values for H3PO4 are 7.5x10^-3, 6.2x10^-8 and 1.8x10^-12, respectively.', choice1='5.48x10^-7 M ', choice2='6.24x10^-7 M', choice3='2.81x10^-7 M', choice4='3.97x10^-7 M ', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_19_132
proposed answer: The calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) from Sub-task 6 is 2.81x10^-7 M. We need to compare this value with the provided multiple-choice options to select the correct answer. The options given are: A) 5.48x10^-7 M, B) 6.24x10^-7 M, C) 2.81x10^-7 M, and D) 3.97x10^-7 M. The calculated value of 2.81x10^-7 M matches exactly with option C. Therefore, the correct answer is option C.

Answer:C

proposed answer: The calculated orthophosphate ion concentration from subtask 6d is 6.28 x 10^-7 M. Comparing this with the provided multiple-choice options: A) 5.48x10^-7 M, B) 6.24x10^-7 M, C) 2.81x10^-7 M, D) 3.97x10^-7 M, the closest option is B) 6.24x10^-7 M. The slight difference is likely due to rounding, as mentioned in the subtask 6d analysis. Therefore, the correct choice is B) 6.24x10^-7 M.

Answer:B)
Extracted answer: B)
Correct answer: 2
