This means that the probability of decay in a future time interval is independent of how much time has already passed without decay. The given decay probability of 32% within 100 minutes suggests that the decay follows an exponential distribution with a certain decay constant. The memoryless property is a key feature of the exponential distribution, making it suitable for modeling radioactive decay processes.; answer - The appropriate decay probability model is the exponential decay model, which is characterized by the memoryless property.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - To calculate the decay constant (λ) for an exponential decay process, we use the relationship between the decay probability and the exponential distribution. The probability that an atom decays within time t is given by P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt). We know that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, or 0.32. Therefore, we have 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100). Solving for λ, we get e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides, we find -λ * 100 = ln(0.68), so λ = -ln(0.68) / 100.; answer - λ = -ln(0.68) / 100\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3a output: thinking - The decay of an atom is modeled as a memoryless process, which means the probability of decay in the future is independent of the past. This is characteristic of the exponential distribution. The probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes given it has survived 50 minutes is a conditional probability problem. We use the memoryless property of the exponential distribution, which states that P(T > s + t | T > s) = P(T > t). Therefore, the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes given it has survived 50 minutes is the same as the probability that it decays within 150 minutes from now. The probability of decay within time t is given by P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt). Thus, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150).; answer - The conditional probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes given it has survived 50 minutes is P(T <= 200 | T > 50) = P(T <= 150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150).\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3b output: thinking - To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes given it has survived 50 minutes. From Sub-task 3a, we know that the decay process is memoryless, and the probability of decay within time t is given by P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt). We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, so P(100) = 0.32 = 1 - e^(-100λ). Solving for λ, we get e^(-100λ) = 0.68, so -100λ = ln(0.68), and λ = -ln(0.68)/100. Now, we need to calculate P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150). Substituting λ, we get P(150) = 1 - e^(-150 * (-ln(0.68)/100)) = 1 - (0.68)^(1.5). We calculate (0.68)^(1.5) = (0.68)^(3/2) = sqrt(0.68^3). First, calculate 0.68^3 = 0.68 * 0.68 * 0.68 = 0.314432. Then, calculate sqrt(0.314432) ≈ 0.560. Therefore, (0.68)^(1.5) ≈ 0.560.

The decay process is memoryless, so the probability of decay within 100 minutes is given by P(100) = 0.32, which means e^(-100λ) = 0.68. Solving for λ gives λ = -ln(0.68)/100. The probability of decay in the next 150 minutes given survival for 50 minutes is P(150) = 1 - e^(-150λ). Substituting λ, we have P(150) = 1 - (0.68)^(1.5). We calculated (0.68)^(1.5) as (0.68)^(3/2) = sqrt(0.68^3). First, 0.68^3 = 0.68 * 0.68 * 0.68 = 0.314432. Then, sqrt(0.314432) ≈ 0.560. Therefore, (0.68)^(1.5) ≈ 0.560.

The exponential decay model follows the formula P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt), where P(t) is the probability of decay by time t, and λ is the decay constant. Given P(100) = 0.32, we have 0.68 = e^(-λ * 100).
