The probability that an atom decays within time t is given by P(t) = 1 - e^(-\u03bbt). We know that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, or 0.32. Therefore, we have 0.32 = 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 100). Solving for \u03bb, we get e^(-\u03bb * 100) = 0.68.

This is characteristic of the exponential distribution. The probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes given it has survived 50 minutes is a conditional probability problem. We use the memoryless property of the exponential distribution, which states that P(T > s + t | T > s) = P(T > t). Therefore, the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes given it has survived 50 minutes is the same as the probability that it decays within 150 minutes from now. The probability of decay within time t is given by P(t) = 1 - e^(-\u03bbt).

From Sub-task 3a, we know that the decay process is memoryless, and the probability of decay within time t is given by P(t) = 1 - e^(-\u03bbt). We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, so P(100) = 0.32 = 1 - e^(-100\u03bb). Solving for \u03bb, we get e^(-100\u03bb) = 0.68, so -100\u03bb = ln(0.68), and \u03bb = -ln(0.68)/100. Now, we need to calculate P(150) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 150). Substituting \u03bb, we get P(150) = 1 - e^(-150 * (-ln(0.68)/100)) = 1 - (0.68)^(1.5). We calculate (0.68)^(1.5) = (0.68)^(3/2) = sqrt(0.68^3). First, calculate 0.68^3 = 0.68 * 0.68 * 0.68 = 0.314432. Then, calculate sqrt(0.314432) \u2248 0.560. Therefore, (0.68)^(1.5) \u2248 0.560.
