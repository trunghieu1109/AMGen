This is consistent with the presence of diastereoisomers, which are stereoisomers that have different spatial arrangements, leading to differences in their NMR chemical shifts and chromatographic behavior. Enantiomers, on the other hand, would not lead to two peaks in the LC-MS analysis as they typically have identical chromatographic behavior under achiral conditions. \'Double coupling\' during an amide-bond forming reaction would likely result in a different mass spectrum, and contamination with a precursor would also show a different mass spectrum or additional peaks.

The NMR spectrum showing two peaks for the same alpha-proton with similar chemical shifts and equal integrals suggests two different stereoisomers with slightly different chemical environments, which is characteristic of diastereoisomers. The LC-MS data showing two distinct peaks with identical mass spectra and equal intensities further supports this, as it indicates two forms of the compound with the same molecular weight. This is consistent with diastereoisomers, which have the same molecular formula and mass but different spatial arrangements, leading to distinct chromatographic and NMR peaks. The equal intensities suggest equal amounts of these forms, ruling out contamination or reaction side-products, which would likely result in different intensities or additional peaks.
