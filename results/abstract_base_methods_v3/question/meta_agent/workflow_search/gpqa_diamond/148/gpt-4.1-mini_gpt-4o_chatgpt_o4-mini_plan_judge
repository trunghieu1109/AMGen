Question: Example(question='You are analyzing a small peptidic compound that has been chemically synthesized. The 1H NMR spectrum of the crude compound appears consistent with the expected molecule, with the exception of two peaks that both correspond to the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar chemical shifts and roughly equal integrals (together they integrate to 1H - the expected integral); based on the coupling pattern, you can rule out spin-spin coupling as an explanation for the duplicate peaks. LC-MS analysis of the crude compound at elevated temperature shows two clearly defined peaks of equal intensities. Both peaks have the same mass spectrum, which is consistent with the expected molecule. What is the most likely explanation for these observations?', choice1='The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers', choice2='The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers', choice3="'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction", choice4='The compound is contaminated with a precursor', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: The observations from the 1H NMR and LC-MS analyses suggest the presence of two stereoisomers with the same molecular weight and mass spectrum but different chemical environments, as indicated by the two peaks in both analyses. The equal intensities and similar chemical shifts of the NMR peaks, coupled with the identical mass spectra and equal intensities in LC-MS, point towards the presence of diastereoisomers. Enantiomers would not show distinct peaks in NMR or LC-MS as they have identical chemical environments and retention times. Double coupling or contamination would likely result in different mass spectra or additional peaks in LC-MS, which were not observed. Therefore, the most plausible explanation is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers.
