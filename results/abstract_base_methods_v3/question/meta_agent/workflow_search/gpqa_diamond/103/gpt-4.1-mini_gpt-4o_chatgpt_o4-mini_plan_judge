Question: Example(question='Astronomers are searching for exoplanets around two stars with exactly the same masses. Using the RV method, they detected one planet around each star, both with masses similar to that of Neptune. The stars themselves have masses similar to that of our Sun. Both planets were found to be in circular orbits.\n\nPlanet #1 was detected from the up to 5 miliangstrom periodic shift of a spectral line at a given wavelength. The periodic wavelength shift of the same spectral line in the spectrum of the host of planet #2 was 7 miliangstrom.\n\nThe question is: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?', choice1='~ 0.36', choice2='~ 1.40', choice3='~ 1.96', choice4='~ 0.85', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: The ratio of the orbital periods of planet #2 to planet #1 was derived as 5/7, which is approximately 0.714. This was based on the inverse relationship between radial velocity amplitude and orbital period for circular orbits. The radial velocity amplitude ratio was determined using the wavelength shifts: 7 milliangstroms for planet #2 and 5 milliangstroms for planet #1. Comparing the calculated value of 0.714 to the multiple-choice options, the closest match is option D) ~0.85. Although 0.714 is not exactly 0.85, it is the closest option available, indicating a possible rounding or approximation in the problem statement.

proposed answer: The computed orbital period ratio is approximately 0.364, derived from the formula P2/P1 = (v1/v2)^3, where v1 and v2 are the radial velocity amplitudes for planets 1 and 2, respectively. Given the radial velocity amplitudes of 5 miliangstrom for planet 1 and 7 miliangstrom for planet 2, the calculation (5/7)^3 = 125/343 â‰ˆ 0.364 was performed. This result is closest to the multiple-choice option ~0.36. The derivation is based on Kepler's third law and the relationship between radial velocity amplitude and orbital period, which is a correct approach. Dimensional analysis confirmed the formula is dimensionally consistent and physically plausible. Therefore, the choice that best matches the computed result is A) ~0.36.
