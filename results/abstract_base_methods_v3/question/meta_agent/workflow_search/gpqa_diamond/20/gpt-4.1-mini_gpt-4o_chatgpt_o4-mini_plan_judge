Question: Example(question='Compounds that have the same molecular formula but are different in their structural arrangement are known as isomers. Isomers have two types, constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but differ in their structures. In stereoisomers, molecules are connected in the same way, but their arrangements in space are different.\nAmong the given compounds (benzoquinone & cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione) the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) and among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate which one will show optical isomerism (B).', choice1='A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate', choice2='A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate', choice3='A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate', choice4='A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_46_20
proposed answer: All agents agree that benzoquinone does not show tautomerism because it lacks the necessary structural features, such as an acidic hydrogen and a neighboring atom with a lone pair. Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo tautomerism due to its carbonyl groups and acidic hydrogens. For optical isomerism, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate can show optical isomerism due to the presence of a chiral center, whereas dimethyl fumarate cannot because it is symmetrical and lacks chiral centers. Therefore, the correct combination is A = benzoquinone (does not show tautomerism) and B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (shows optical isomerism), which corresponds to choice C.
