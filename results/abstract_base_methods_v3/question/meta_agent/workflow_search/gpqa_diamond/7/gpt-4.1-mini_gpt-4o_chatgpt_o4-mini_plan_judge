Question: Example(question="You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control’s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control’s resistance; 0% ‒ all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?\n", choice1='G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3', choice2='G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1', choice3='G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1', choice4='G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_7
proposed answer: All debate agents agree that G2 is likely the transcription factor because its knockout results in a complete loss of resistance, indicating its upstream regulatory role. The analysis also shows that G1 and G3 display pleiotropy, with G1 being epistatic towards G3. This is supported by the experimental results where g1 has higher resistance than g3, and the double mutant g1g3 shows a significant drop in resistance, indicating G1's presence is more critical. These findings align with choice 4: 'G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.' This choice correctly identifies G2 as the transcription factor and describes the interaction between G1 and G3 as pleiotropy with G1 being epistatic towards G3, which matches the experimental observations and the analysis from the sub-tasks.

proposed answer: The majority of the debate agents (HBMu, YwVb, and TN3S) agree that choice 4 is the most appropriate conclusion based on the experimental data. They all identify G2 as the transcription factor, which is supported by the fact that the g2 knockout results in 0% resistance, indicating its crucial upstream role. They also agree that G1 is epistatic towards G3, as the g1g3 double mutant shows significantly reduced resistance compared to g1 alone, indicating G1's presence is necessary for G3's function. Although the mention of pleiotropy in choice 4 is not directly supported by the data, it does not contradict the main findings regarding the roles of G1, G2, and G3. Therefore, choice 4 aligns best with the experimental results and the analyses provided by the majority of the agents.
