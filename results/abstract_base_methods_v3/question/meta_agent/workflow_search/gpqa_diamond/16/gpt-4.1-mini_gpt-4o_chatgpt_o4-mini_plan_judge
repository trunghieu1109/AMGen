Question: Example(question='What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex (we assume that the pH is ideal, T = 25 Â°C). KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10.', choice1='1.0x10^-2 M ', choice2='5.0x10^-3 M', choice3='6.3x10^-7 M', choice4='2.0x10^-2 M ', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_12_16
proposed answer: All debate agents have calculated the concentration of free Ca2+ ions to be approximately 2x10^-7 M. Among the provided multiple-choice options, 6.3x10^-7 M (choice C) is the closest value to the calculated concentration. Although there is a slight discrepancy between the calculated value and the provided option, choice C is the nearest approximation. The large formation constant of the Ca-EDTA complex suggests minimal dissociation, supporting the assumption that the concentration of free Ca2+ ions is very low. Therefore, choice C is the most reasonable selection given the available options.
