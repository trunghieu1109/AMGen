The equilibrium expression for the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex can be written as the reverse of the formation reaction. The formation reaction is: Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- ⇌ Ca-EDTA. The formation constant K_Ca-EDTA = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]) = 5x10^10. Therefore, the dissociation reaction is: Ca-EDTA ⇌ Ca^2+ + EDTA^4-.

At the start, before any dissociation occurs, the concentration of free Ca2+ ions is 0 M because all the calcium is initially bound in the complex. As the complex dissociates, we assume that x M of Ca-EDTA dissociates into x M of Ca2+ and x M of EDTA4-. Therefore, at equilibrium, the concentration of Ca-EDTA will be 0.02 - x M, the concentration of Ca2+ will be x M, and the concentration of EDTA4- will also be x M. The equilibrium expression from Sub-task 1 is K_dissociation = [Ca2+][EDTA4-]/[Ca-EDTA] = 1/(5x10^10). Substituting the equilibrium concentrations, we have (x)(x)/(0.02 - x) = 1/(5x10^10). This equation can be solved to find the value of x, which represents the concentration of free Ca2+ ions at equilibrium.; answer - Initial concentration of Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M; let x be the concentration of Ca2+ ions at equilibrium. At equilibrium: [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 - x, [Ca2+] = x, [EDTA4-] = x.

At equilibrium, the concentration of free Ca2+ ions is x M, and the concentration of free EDTA4- ions is also x M. The concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex at equilibrium is 0.02 - x M. The formation constant KCa-EDTA is given as 5x10^10, which is the reciprocal of the dissociation constant. The equilibrium expression for the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex is given by the dissociation constant K_dissociation = [Ca2+][EDTA4-]/[Ca-EDTA]. Since KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10, we have K_dissociation = 1/(5x10^10). Substituting the equilibrium concentrations into the dissociation expression, we get (x)(x)/(0.02 - x) = 1/(5x10^10).

Therefore, we approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. Substituting this into the equation, we get x^2/0.02 = 1/(5x10^10). Solving for x, we have x^2 = 0.02/(5x10^10).

At equilibrium, some of this complex will dissociate into Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-. Let x be the concentration of Ca^2+ that is formed at equilibrium. Since the stoichiometry of the dissociation is 1:1:1, x will also be the concentration of EDTA^4- formed. Thus, at equilibrium, the concentration of Ca-EDTA will be (0.02 - x) M, the concentration of Ca^2+ will be x M, and the concentration of EDTA^4- will be x M. We can use these expressions to solve for x using the dissociation constant K_dissociation derived in Sub-task 1.; answer: Let x be the concentration of Ca^2+ formed. Initial concentrations: [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 M, [Ca^2+] = [EDTA^4-] = 0 M.

At equilibrium, some of this complex will dissociate into Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-. Let x be the concentration of Ca^2+ that dissociates. Initially, the concentration of Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- is 0. As the complex dissociates, the concentration of Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- will both increase by x, and the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex will decrease by x. Therefore, the initial concentration of Ca-EDTA is 0.02 M, the concentration of Ca^2+ at equilibrium is x, and the concentration of EDTA^4- at equilibrium is also x. The concentration of Ca-EDTA at equilibrium is 0.02 - x. We use these expressions to apply the equilibrium constant from the dissociation reaction to solve for x.; answer: Initial concentration of Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M.
