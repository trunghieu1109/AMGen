The magnetic moment is given by mu = gamma*Sz, where gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio and Sz is the spin operator along the Z-axis. In this setup, the particle's spin is aligned with the magnetic field, meaning it is in an eigenstate of the Sz operator with a definite value of the z-component of spin. This alignment implies that the particle's magnetic moment is stable and does not precess as long as the magnetic field is along the Z-axis.

The Hamiltonian is now determined by the magnetic field along the +Y direction, which means the spin will start to precess around the +Y axis. The precession occurs because the spin state is not an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian, leading to oscillations in the expectation values of the spin components.

The magnetic moment mu is expressed as mu = gamma * S, where gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio and S is the spin operator. When the magnetic field is along the +Y direction, we have B = (0, B, 0). The Hamiltonian is then given by H = -mu · B. Substituting the expressions for mu and B, we get H = -gamma * S · (0, B, 0) = -gamma * (Sx * 0 + Sy * B + Sz * 0) = -gamma * B * Sy.

For a spin-1/2 particle, the time evolution of the expectation value of an observable, such as the z-component of the magnetic moment <mu_z>(t), is governed by the Heisenberg equation of motion. The magnetic moment along the z-axis is given by mu_z = gamma * Sz. The Heisenberg equation of motion for Sz is d<Sz>/dt = (i/hbar) * [H, Sz], where [H, Sz] is the commutator of H and Sz. Substituting the Hamiltonian H = -gamma * B * Sy, we have [H, Sz] = -gamma * B * [Sy, Sz]. The commutator [Sy, Sz] is i * hbar * Sx (using the commutation relations of spin operators). Thus, d<Sz>/dt = (i/hbar) * (-gamma * B * i * hbar * Sx) = gamma * B * Sx. This indicates that the expectation value <Sz>(t) will oscillate in time due to the presence of the Sx term.

The Hamiltonian is now determined by the magnetic field along the +Y direction, which means the spin will start to precess around the +Y axis.

Initially, the spin was aligned with the +Z magnetic field, meaning it was in an eigenstate of the Sz operator. When the magnetic field is turned off in the +Z direction and turned on in the +Y direction, the Hamiltonian governing the system changes. The new Hamiltonian is proportional to Sy, the spin operator along the Y-axis. The particle is no longer in an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian. Instead, it is in a superposition of the eigenstates of Sy. This change causes the expectation value of the z-component of the spin (and thus the magnetic moment) to oscillate over time. The frequency of this oscillation is determined by the energy difference between the eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian, which is proportional to gamma*B, as the new Hamiltonian is proportional to the magnetic field B and the gyromagnetic ratio gamma.; answer: When the magnetic field is changed from the +Z direction to the +Y direction, the spin state of the particle is no longer aligned with the magnetic field. The expectation value of the z-component of the spin begins to oscillate with a frequency determined by the energy splitting due to the new magnetic field along the Y-axis.

The Hamiltonian is now determined by the magnetic field along the +Y direction, which interacts with the spin through the term -gamma*B*Sy, where Sy is the spin operator along the Y-axis. The initial state, which was an eigenstate of Sz, will start to evolve in time under the influence of the new Hamiltonian. This results in precession of the spin around the new magnetic field direction, which is along the +Y axis. The precession causes the expectation value of the z-component of the spin, and hence the magnetic moment, to oscillate over time. The frequency of this oscillation is determined by the Larmor precession frequency, which is given by the magnitude of the gyromagnetic ratio times the magnitude of the magnetic field, gamma*B.; answer: When the magnetic field is turned along the +Y direction, the spin precesses around the +Y axis, causing the z-component of the magnetic moment to oscillate with frequency gamma*B.\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent vm7D, formulating Hamiltonian, thinking: After the magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction, the Hamiltonian of the system is determined by the interaction of the magnetic moment with the magnetic field. The magnetic moment mu is given by mu = gamma * S, where S is the spin operator. The magnetic field B is now along the +Y direction, so we can write B = (0, B, 0). The Hamiltonian is given by H = -mu · B. Substituting mu = gamma * S and B = (0, B, 0), we have H = -gamma * S · (0, B, 0) = -gamma * (Sx * 0 + Sy * B + Sz * 0) = -gamma * B * Sy.

To determine the time evolution of the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment, <mu_z>(t), we need to consider the time evolution of the spin state under this Hamiltonian. The time evolution of a quantum state is given by the Schrödinger equation, and for an observable A, its expectation value evolves according to the Heisenberg equation of motion: d<A>/dt = i/hbar * <[H, A]>. In this case, A = Sz, and we need to compute the commutator [H, Sz]. Since H = -gamma * B * Sy, we have [H, Sz] = -gamma * B * [Sy, Sz]. The commutation relations for spin operators are [Sy, Sz] = i*hbar*Sx. Therefore, [H, Sz] = -gamma * B * i*hbar * Sx. This implies that d<Sz>/dt = i/hbar * <[H, Sz]> = -gamma * B * <Sx>. Similarly, we can compute d<Sx>/dt and d<Sy>/dt to find that the expectation values of the spin components precess around the Y-axis. Specifically, d<Sy>/dt = 0 and d<Sx>/dt = gamma * B * <Sz>. These coupled differential equations describe a precession with frequency omega = gamma * B. Therefore, the expectation value <mu_z>(t) will oscillate with this frequency.; answer: gamma*B\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent LydZ, determining time evolution and oscillation frequency, thinking: The Hamiltonian after the magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction is H = -gamma * B * Sy. This Hamiltonian describes the precession of the spin around the Y-axis. The initial state of the system has the spin aligned with the Z-axis. Under the influence of the Hamiltonian, the spin will precess around the Y-axis. The time evolution of the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment, <mu_z>(t), can be calculated using the formula for the time evolution of an expectation value in quantum mechanics. The expectation value of the spin operator Sz as a function of time is given by <Sz>(t) = <Sz>(0) * cos(omega * t), where omega is the precession frequency. The precession frequency omega is determined by the Hamiltonian: omega = gamma * B. Therefore, the oscillation frequency of <mu_z>(t) is gamma * B.; answer: gamma*B\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent mJna, determining time evolution and oscillation frequency, thinking: After the magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction, the Hamiltonian is H = -gamma * B * Sy. For a spin-1/2 particle, the time evolution of the expectation value of an observable, such as the z-component of the magnetic moment <mu_z>(t), is governed by the Heisenberg equation of motion. The magnetic moment along the z-axis is given by mu_z = gamma * Sz. The Heisenberg equation of motion for Sz is d<Sz>/dt = (i/hbar) * [H, Sz], where [H, Sz] is the commutator of H and Sz. Substituting the Hamiltonian H = -gamma * B * Sy, we have [H, Sz] = -gamma * B * [Sy, Sz]. The commutator [Sy, Sz] is i * hbar * Sx (using the commutation relations of spin operators). Thus, d<Sz>/dt = (i/hbar) * (-gamma * B * i * hbar * Sx) = gamma * B * Sx. This indicates that the expectation value <Sz>(t) will oscillate in time due to the presence of the Sx term.
