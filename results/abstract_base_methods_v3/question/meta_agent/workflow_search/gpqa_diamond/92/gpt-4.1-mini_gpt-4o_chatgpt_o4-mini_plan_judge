Question: Example(question='"Scientist aims to run quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) on some samples. He first wants to make a calibration curve so he took positive control with known copy numbers and run qPCR on serially diluted positive control three technical replicates. The efficiency of qPCR was 100%. The R2 was 1, and the slope was -3.3. His results were as follows:\nAt the concentration of 100000 copies per µl, ct of triplicate results were 33.9, 34.2, 34.5.\nAt the concentration of 10000 copies per µl, ct of triplicate results were 30.6, 30.9, 31.2.\nAt the concentration of 1000 copies per µl, ct of triplicate results were 27.3, 27.6, 27.9.\nAt the concentration of 100 copies per µl, ct of triplicate results were 24, 24.3, 24.6.\nAt the concentration of 10 copies per µl, ct of triplicate results were 20.7, 21, 21.3\nWhich of the following explains the discrepancies in his results?\n\n', choice1='Ct values are not in agreement with the amount of target nucleic acid in samples ', choice2='Ten-fold dilution is more than 3.3 cycles', choice3='The deviation is more than 0.3 between technical replicates', choice4='qPCR cannot be used for the quantification of nucleic acid in samples ', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: The analysis of the data shows that the Ct values decrease with increasing concentration, which is consistent with qPCR principles. The expected Ct difference between ten-fold serial dilutions is 3.3 cycles, and the observed Ct differences match this expectation exactly, indicating no discrepancy in dilution effects. The calibration curve parameters (100% efficiency, R2 of 1, slope of -3.3) confirm the validity of the calibration curve and the suitability of qPCR for quantification. However, the deviation among triplicate Ct values for each concentration is 0.6 cycles, which exceeds the acceptable threshold of 0.3 cycles, indicating inconsistency among technical replicates. This inconsistency could lead to inaccurate quantification, and it is the only aspect that does not meet the expected standards. Therefore, the best explanation for the discrepancies is that the deviation is more than 0.3 between technical replicates, which corresponds to choice C.

proposed answer: The analysis of the qPCR data from the sub-tasks reveals that the fundamental principles of qPCR are upheld: the Ct values decrease with increasing concentration, and the mean Ct differences between ten-fold dilutions match the expected 3.3 cycles, indicating no deviation from expected qPCR efficiency. The calibration curve is valid with ideal efficiency and linearity. However, the deviation among triplicate Ct values for each concentration is 0.6 cycles, which exceeds the acceptable threshold of 0.3 cycles. This significant variability among technical replicates is the main discrepancy observed in the results. Therefore, the best explanation for the observed discrepancies is that the deviation is more than 0.3 between technical replicates, as this directly addresses the inconsistency found in the replicate analysis.
