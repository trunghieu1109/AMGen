proposed answer: The 2D NOESY NMR spectrum provides information about protons that are spatially close to each other. In the context of the major product, which is likely the endo isomer of the Diels-Alder reaction, the spatial arrangement of protons leads to a NOE cross-peak between the methyl groups and the protons near the anhydride moiety. The chemical shifts and integral values provided suggest that the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm corresponds to the methyl groups, and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm corresponds to the protons near the anhydride moiety. These protons are spatially close in the endo configuration, resulting in the observed NOESY cross-peak. All agents agree that the correct choice is the one that matches these chemical shifts and integral values, which is Choice 1: A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.

proposed answer: The task is to determine which two proton resonances are connected by the NOESY cross-peak in the major product. The NOESY spectrum provides information about protons that are spatially close to each other. From the analysis in the sub-tasks, it is established that the cross-peak in the major product's NOESY spectrum connects a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. This suggests that these protons are in close proximity, likely due to a syn orientation in the Diels-Alder adduct. The 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm corresponds to the methyl groups on the cyclopentadiene moiety, and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm corresponds to the methylene bridge protons. This analysis is consistent across all debate agents, who have evaluated the multiple-choice options and concluded that Choice A is the only option that matches the observed NOESY cross-peak data. Therefore, the final decision is that the NOESY cross-peak in the major product connects the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.

Answer:A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm
