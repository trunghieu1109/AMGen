These data are consistent with maleic anhydride, which has a symmetrical structure with equivalent protons on the alkene. Maleic anhydride is known to have a single type of hydrogen environment due to the symmetry of the molecule, and the carbon peaks correspond to the alkene and carbonyl carbons.

The endo isomer is usually the major product due to favorable secondary orbital interactions. In the 1H NMR spectrum, the endo product may show a NOE cross-peak between protons that are spatially close due to the endo orientation. The 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm likely corresponds to the methyl groups on the cyclopentadiene, and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm could correspond to protons on the bridgehead or near the anhydride moiety. The presence of a cross-peak in the NOESY spectrum of the major product suggests that these protons are close in space, consistent with the endo configuration.

The absence or weakness of this cross-peak in the minor product suggests a different spatial arrangement, likely the exo isomer, where these protons are not as close. This spatial proximity in the major product is consistent with the endo configuration, where the methyl groups and the bridgehead protons are closer due to the folding of the cycloaddition product.; answer - A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - The 2D NOESY NMR spectrum provides information about protons that are spatially close to each other.

The 13C NMR peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm suggest sp2 hybridized carbons, likely from an alkene and carbonyl groups. A common dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene that forms a symmetric anhydride is maleic acid, which forms maleic anhydride.
