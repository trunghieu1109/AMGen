proposed answer: The key factor enabling the conversion from a sequential to a parallel algorithm in the context of solving higher dimensional heat equations using fractional approximations is the 'Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation'. This approach allows the decomposition of the matrix exponential function into simpler, independent components that can be processed concurrently. This decomposition is crucial for parallel computation as it aligns with the architecture of parallel processors, facilitating concurrent processing of each component. Other factors such as nonlocal boundary conditions and stability analysis, while important for the overall problem-solving process, do not directly contribute to parallelization. Complex roots of the fractional approximation pertain to mathematical properties rather than enabling parallel computation. Therefore, the linear partial fraction approach is the most relevant factor for enabling parallelization.
