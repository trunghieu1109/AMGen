This range is determined by the atmospheric transmission and the sensitivity of the instruments used in these telescopes. The Earth's atmosphere is transparent to visible light, allowing telescopes to observe this range effectively.

The rest wavelength of the Lyman alpha line is 1216 Angstroms. The optical detection window starts at 4000 Angstroms. Therefore, we set the observed_wavelength to 4000 Angstroms and solve for z: z = (4000 / 1216) - 1. Calculating this gives z = 3.289 - 1 = 2.289. Thus, the minimum redshift is approximately 2.3.

        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The Lyman alpha absorption line is a well-known spectral line associated with the transition of electrons in neutral hydrogen atoms. It occurs when an electron transitions from the n=2 to the n=1 energy level, and this transition has a rest-frame wavelength of approximately 1216 Angstroms. This is a fundamental property of hydrogen and is widely used in astrophysics to study distant objects.; answer - The rest-frame wavelength of the Lyman alpha absorption line relevant to neutral hydrogen clouds is approximately 1216 Angstroms.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - Optical ground-based telescopes are limited by the Earth's atmosphere, which absorbs certain wavelengths of light. The atmosphere is generally opaque to ultraviolet light, and optical telescopes are typically sensitive to wavelengths starting from around 3500 to 3600 Angstroms. This range is chosen because it is where the atmosphere becomes transparent enough for telescopes to detect light effectively, and it is also where the sensitivity of optical instruments begins. Therefore, the realistic blue cutoff wavelength for optical ground-based telescopes is around 3500 to 3600 Angstroms.; answer - The realistic blue cutoff wavelength for optical ground-based telescopes is typically around 3500 to 3600 Angstroms, considering atmospheric transmission and instrumental sensitivity.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3a output: thinking - To calculate the minimum redshift (z) at which the Lyman alpha absorption line (rest wavelength 1216 Angstroms) is redshifted into the optical detection window, we use the formula z = (observed_wavelength / rest_wavelength) - 1. We have multiple plausible blue cutoff wavelengths for optical ground-based telescopes: 3200 \u00c5, 3500 \u00c5, and 4000 \u00c5. \n\n1. For 3200 \u00c5: \n   z = (3200 \u00c5 / 1216 \u00c5) - 1 = 1.6303\n\n2. For 3500 \u00c5: \n   z = (3500 \u00c5 / 1216 \u00c5) - 1 = 1.8766\n\n3.

Therefore, using 3500 \u00c5 as a typical value, the minimum redshift is approximately 1.8766.

The realistic blue cutoff wavelength for optical ground-based telescopes is around 3500 \u00c5, giving a minimum redshift of approximately 1.8766.
