proposed answer: The task is to determine which multiple-choice option correctly lists the kinematically allowed decays of the boson X with a mass of 6 GeV. The kinematically allowed decays are to fermion-antifermion pairs where the combined mass is less than or equal to 6 GeV. These include c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^{+}\tau^{-}, \mu^{+}\mu^{-}, and e^{+}e^{-}. Comparing these to the provided choices: Choice 1 includes all these channels, making it a match. Choice 2 incorrectly includes b\bar{b}, which is not allowed due to mass constraints. Choice 3 includes t\bar{t}, which is also not allowed. Choice 4 omits c\bar{c}, which is allowed. Therefore, choice 1 is the correct match.
