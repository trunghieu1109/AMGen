Solving this equation for p_mu gives us the momentum of the muon, and thus its kinetic energy KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu*c^2. The kinetic energy of the neutrino is simply E_nu = p_nu*c. Solving these equations simultaneously, we find the kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino to be approximately 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV, respectively. Comparing these values with the provided multiple-choice options, the correct choice is 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV, which corresponds to choice 4.; answer: D)\n<SEPERATOR>\nFinal Decision agent, selecting correct kinetic energies and choice, thinking: The problem involves the decay of a stationary Pi(+) particle into a mu(+) and a neutrino. The rest mass energies of Pi(+) and mu(+) are given as 139.6 MeV and 105.7 MeV, respectively. Using conservation of energy and momentum, we can determine the kinetic energies of the decay products. The total initial energy is the rest mass energy of Pi(+), which is 139.6 MeV. After the decay, this energy is distributed between the mu(+) and the neutrino. The energy of the muon is given by E_mu = sqrt(p_mu^2c^2 + m_mu^2c^4), where m_mu is 105.7 MeV/c^2. For the massless neutrino, E_nu = p_nu*c. Conservation of momentum gives p_mu = -p_nu, and conservation of energy gives E_mu + E_nu = 139.6 MeV. Solving these equations, we find the kinetic energy of the muon to be 4.12 MeV and the kinetic energy of the neutrino to be 29.8 MeV. Comparing these values with the provided multiple-choice options, the correct choice is 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV, which corresponds to choice D).; answer: D)", iteration_idx=-1)]
