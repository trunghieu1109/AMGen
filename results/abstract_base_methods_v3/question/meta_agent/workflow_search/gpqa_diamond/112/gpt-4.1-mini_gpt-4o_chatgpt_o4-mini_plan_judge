Question: Example(question='You have prepared an unknown compound. To identify the product, you have used the following characterisation techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers. Two other strong absorption peaks are observed at 1700 and 1650 wavenumbers. Several peaks were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum including peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens. The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45. Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O2.', choice1='C6H10O2', choice2='C6H12O', choice3='C6H10O', choice4='C6H12O2', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_5_112
proposed answer: The refined molecular formula from Sub-task 5 is C6H10O2. The multiple-choice options provided are: A) C6H10O2, B) C6H12O, C) C6H10O, D) C6H12O2. The correct formula identified is C6H10O2, which corresponds to option A. Therefore, the correct multiple-choice answer is A.
