proposed answer: To synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, the correct sequence of reactions should involve first introducing the acetyl group via Friedel-Crafts acylation, followed by nitration to introduce the nitro group, and finally bromination to introduce the bromo group. The target molecule does not require any reduction, diazotization, or deamination steps, as these are used to modify amino groups, which are not present in the target molecule. Therefore, we need to choose the sequence that aligns with this order: acetylation, nitration, and bromination. Option 4 starts with Friedel-Crafts acylation (CH3COCl/AlCl3), followed by bromination (Br2/FeBr3), and then nitration (HNO3/H2SO4), which matches the necessary sequence to achieve the target compound. Options 1, 2, and 3 involve unnecessary steps such as reduction, diazotization, or deamination, which are not needed for the synthesis of the target compound.

proposed answer: Based on the critical evaluation of the provided reaction sequences, the correct sequence to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene involves the following steps: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 to introduce the acetyl group, ii) HNO3/H2SO4 to nitrate the ring, and iii) Br2/FeBr3 to brominate the ring. This sequence respects the directing effects of the substituents: the acetyl group is a meta-director, directing the nitro group to the correct position, and the nitro group then directs bromination to the desired position. However, none of the provided options match this correct sequence exactly. Choice 4 starts with acetylation, which is correct, but follows with bromination before nitration, which is not optimal according to the directing effects. The additional steps in all options introduce unnecessary complexity. Therefore, none of the options fully align with the correct sequence established in the sub-tasks.

Answer:None of the provided options match the correct sequence.
