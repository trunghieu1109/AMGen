Question: Example(question='We have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate, where the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M and the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16. What will be the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species in the solution? ', choice1='16.9%', choice2='42.3%', choice3='25.6%', choice4='38.1%', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_21_197
proposed answer: All agents have calculated the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex among all cobalt-containing species to be 16.92%. This value is closest to the multiple-choice option '16.9%', which corresponds to choice A. The other options (42.3%, 25.6%, and 38.1%) do not match the calculated percentage. Therefore, the consensus among the agents is that the correct answer is choice A, as it matches the calculated percentage when rounded to one decimal place.
