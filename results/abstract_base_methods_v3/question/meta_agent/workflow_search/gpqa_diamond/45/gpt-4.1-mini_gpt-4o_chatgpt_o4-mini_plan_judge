Question: Example(question='Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. How many possible products are there (excluding ethene)?', choice1='4', choice2='6', choice3='8', choice4='2', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_5_45
proposed answer: The metathesis reaction of racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst results in four distinct products: two homodimers and two heterodimers, each existing as a racemic mixture. This matches the count of 4 possible products. Therefore, the correct choice from the provided options is the one that corresponds to 4 products.

Answer:A
Extracted answer: A
Correct answer: 2

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_5_45
proposed answer: The metathesis reaction of racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst results in two main skeletal isomers: 4-methylpent-2-ene and 3-methylhex-3-ene. Each of these can exist in two stereochemical forms due to E/Z isomerism. Therefore, the possible products are E-4-methylpent-2-ene, Z-4-methylpent-2-ene, E-3-methylhex-3-ene, and Z-3-methylhex-3-ene, totaling 4 distinct products. This matches choice A) 4.
