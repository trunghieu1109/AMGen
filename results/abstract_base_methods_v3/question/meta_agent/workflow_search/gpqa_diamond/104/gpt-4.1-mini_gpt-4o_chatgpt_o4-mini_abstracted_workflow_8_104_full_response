The values given are F_spotless = 1.472 × 10^8 W/m² and F_total = 1.378 × 10^8 W/m². Substituting these into the formula gives A = (1.472 × 10^8 - 1.378 × 10^8) / 1.472 × 10^8 = 0.094 × 10^8 / 1.472 × 10^8 = 0.094 / 1.472. Calculating this gives approximately 0.06387755. However, rounding to three decimal places, which is a common practice for such calculations, gives 0.0639. This value is consistent with the answers provided by Debate Agents Nmmp and QNIC, and it is a dimensionless number representing the relative change in flux due to the spots.

The amplitude A due to the spots was given as 0.0639, and taking the square root gives approximately 0.2528. This value is closest to the option B) ~0.32, which was correctly chosen. However, the limitation here is that the calculation assumes a simple model where the amplitude of the light curve dip is directly related to the square of the radius ratio, which is a simplification. In reality, other factors such as limb darkening and the geometry of the transit can affect the observed amplitude. Additionally, the choice of the closest option is somewhat subjective, as 0.2528 is not extremely close to 0.32, but it is the closest among the given options.\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Derive the radius ratio (Rpl/Rstar) of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude signal in the star\'s light curve by taking the square root of the normalized amplitude A.
