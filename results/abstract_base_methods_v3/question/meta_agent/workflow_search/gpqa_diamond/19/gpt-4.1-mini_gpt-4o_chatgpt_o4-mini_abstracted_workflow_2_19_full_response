'The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons' implies that the interaction is localized to single nucleons, not involving multiple nucleons or collective effects. This supports the idea of treating nucleons as free particles during the interaction.\n2. 'The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon' suggests that the interaction does not involve or get affected by other nucleons in the nucleus, effectively isolating the nucleon of interest.\n3.

This is aligned with the impulse approximation, where interactions are considered as if nucleons are free particles. Assumption 2: 'The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon' means that the interaction can be treated as if it occurs in isolation, without interference from other nucleons. This supports the idea of treating nucleons as free particles in the impulse approximation. Assumption 3: 'The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic' relates to the internal structure of nucleons, suggesting that the quarks' dynamics do not affect the nucleon's response significantly. This is less directly related to the impulse approximation, which focuses more on the nucleon as a whole. Assumption 4: 'The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces' implies that the nucleon behaves as if it is not bound within the nucleus, which is a key part of the impulse approximation, treating nucleons as free particles.
