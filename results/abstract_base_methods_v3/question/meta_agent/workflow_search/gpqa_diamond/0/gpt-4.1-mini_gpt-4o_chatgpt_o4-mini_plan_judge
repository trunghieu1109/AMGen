Question: Example(question='Two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10^-9 sec and 10^-8 sec, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which one of the following options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?\n', choice1='10^-9 eV', choice2='10^-11 eV', choice3='10^-8 eV\n', choice4='10^-4 eV', correct_index=4)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_8_0
proposed answer: Based on the analysis in Sub-task 4, the minimum energy difference required to clearly distinguish the two energy levels is approximately 3.62 Ã— 10^-7 eV. Among the given options, 10^-4 eV is the only value that exceeds this threshold, making it the correct choice for clear resolution. Therefore, the alphabet choice corresponding to this option is D).
