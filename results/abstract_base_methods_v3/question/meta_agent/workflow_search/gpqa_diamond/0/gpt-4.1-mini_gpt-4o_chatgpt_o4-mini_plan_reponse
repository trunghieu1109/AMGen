        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The energy-time uncertainty principle states that the uncertainty in energy (\u0394E) and the uncertainty in time (\u0394t) are related by \u0394E * \u0394t \u2265 \u0127/2, where \u0127 is the reduced Planck's constant (approximately 1.0545718 \u00d7 10^-34 Js). For a quantum state with a lifetime \u0394t, the energy uncertainty or linewidth \u0394E is approximately \u0127/(2\u0394t). For the two states with lifetimes 10^-9 s and 10^-8 s, their energy uncertainties are approximately 6.6 \u00d7 10^-7 eV and 6.6 \u00d7 10^-8 eV, respectively. To clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference should be larger than the sum of their uncertainties, which is approximately 7.26 \u00d7 10^-7 eV. Therefore, the energy difference should be larger than this value to resolve the levels.; answer - The energy difference should be larger than the sum of the uncertainties, which is approximately 7.26 \u00d7 10^-7 eV.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - Using the energy-time uncertainty principle, \u0394E \u2248 \u0127 / (2 * \u0394t), where \u0127 is the reduced Planck's constant (1.0545718 \u00d7 10^-34 Js).

According to the energy-time uncertainty principle, the energy uncertainty (\u0394E) for a state is approximately \u0127 / (2 * lifetime). For the state with a lifetime of 10^-9 s, the energy uncertainty is approximately 3.29 \u00d7 10^-7 eV, and for the state with a lifetime of 10^-8 s, it is approximately 3.29 \u00d7 10^-8 eV. To clearly resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference should be larger than the sum of these uncertainties, which is approximately 3.62 \u00d7 10^-7 eV. Among the given options, 10^-4 eV is the only choice that is larger than this value, making it the correct choice. This approach assumes that the only broadening mechanism is the finite lifetime of the states, and other broadening effects are negligible.; answer - D)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - The minimum energy difference required to clearly distinguish the two energy levels, as determined in the sub-tasks, is approximately 3.62 \u00d7 10^-7 eV. We need to compare this value with the given multiple-choice options: 10^-9 eV, 10^-11 eV, 10^-8 eV, and 10^-4 eV. The option that allows clear resolution must be greater than 3.62 \u00d7 10^-7 eV.
