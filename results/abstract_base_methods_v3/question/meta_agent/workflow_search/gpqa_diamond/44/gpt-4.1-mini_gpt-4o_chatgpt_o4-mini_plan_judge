Question: Example(question='Four identical spin-1/2 particles are placed in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. Calculate the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system in terms of energy  E.\n(Here E= pi^2 \\hbar^2 /2mL^2 )', choice1='4E, 10E, 50E', choice2='10E, 15E, 18E\n', choice3='4E, 10E, 15E', choice4='30E, 39E, 50E', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_21_44
proposed answer: The calculated energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are 10E, 15E, and 30E, respectively. Comparing these with the given multiple-choice options: Choice 1 (4E, 10E, 50E), Choice 2 (10E, 15E, 18E), Choice 3 (4E, 10E, 15E), and Choice 4 (30E, 39E, 50E), none of the options match all three calculated energies exactly. However, Choice 2 matches the ground state and first excited state energies (10E and 15E), but not the second excited state energy (18E vs. 30E). Despite this, Choice 2 is the closest match for the first two states, making it the best available option.
