According to the previous analysis and decision, triisopropyl borate exhibits C3h symmetry due to its structural features, including a threefold rotational axis and a horizontal mirror plane. The previous answer identified triisopropyl borate as choice B. Therefore, the final answer should be B.

The reasoning is based on the molecular structure of triisopropyl borate, which has a central boron atom bonded to three isopropyl groups. This configuration allows for a threefold rotational axis and a horizontal mirror plane, which are characteristic of C3h symmetry. The other molecules listed have more complex structures that do not support C3h symmetry. According to the multiple-choice options provided, triisopropyl borate corresponds to choice B. Therefore, the correct answer in the required format is B.; answer: B\n<SEPERATOR>\nFinal Decision agent on final answer formatting, thinking: The task is to determine which molecule has C3h symmetry and return the corresponding multiple-choice letter. All agents have consistently identified triisopropyl borate as the molecule with C3h symmetry due to its structural features, including a threefold rotational axis and a horizontal mirror plane.
