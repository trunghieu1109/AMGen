Question: Example(question='Astronomers are studying a system of three exoplanets (Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3) with circular orbits discovered through the TTV method. They have found that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 2.3. They have also found that the ratio of the masses between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.15, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 1.35. By what factor is the orbital period of Planet3 larger than that of Planet1, if the albedo for all three planets is equal to 0.3 (similar to that of Earth)?', choice1='~ 4.4', choice2='~ 33.4', choice3='~ 10.4', choice4='~ 3.2', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_47_41
proposed answer: All agents have calculated the orbital period ratio of Planet3 to Planet1 to be approximately 33.4 based on the given data and Kepler's third law. This calculated value matches exactly with the provided multiple-choice option B) ~ 33.4. Since the calculated result aligns perfectly with one of the given options, the closest matching choice is clearly option B) ~ 33.4.

Answer:B)
Extracted answer: B)
