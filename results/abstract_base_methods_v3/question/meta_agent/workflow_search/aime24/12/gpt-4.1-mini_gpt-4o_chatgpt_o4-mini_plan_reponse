This is because the polar form of a complex number with magnitude r and argument \u03b8 is given by r(cos \u03b8 + i sin \u03b8) or re^(i\u03b8). Since we are given |z| = 4, we set r = 4, and \u03b8 is the variable we will optimize over.; answer - z = 4(cos \u03b8 + i sin \u03b8) = 4e^(i\u03b8)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - To rewrite the expression in terms of \u03b8, we substitute z = 4e^(i\u03b8) and 1/z = (1/4)e^(-i\u03b8) into the original expression (75+117i)z + (96+144i)/z. This gives us (75+117i)(4e^(i\u03b8)) + (96+144i)((1/4)e^(-i\u03b8)). Simplifying, we distribute the terms: (75+117i)(4e^(i\u03b8)) = 300e^(i\u03b8) + 468i e^(i\u03b8) and (96+144i)((1/4)e^(-i\u03b8)) = 24e^(-i\u03b8) + 36i e^(-i\u03b8). Now, we can combine these: 300e^(i\u03b8) + 468i e^(i\u03b8) + 24e^(-i\u03b8) + 36i e^(-i\u03b8). We use Euler's formula to express e^(i\u03b8) = cos(\u03b8) + i sin(\u03b8) and e^(-i\u03b8) = cos(\u03b8) - i sin(\u03b8). Thus, 300e^(i\u03b8) = 300(cos(\u03b8) + i sin(\u03b8)), 468i e^(i\u03b8) = 468i(cos(\u03b8) + i sin(\u03b8)), 24e^(-i\u03b8) = 24(cos(\u03b8) - i sin(\u03b8)), and 36i e^(-i\u03b8) = 36i(cos(\u03b8) - i sin(\u03b8)). Combining these, we have (300 cos(\u03b8) - 24 cos(\u03b8)) + i(300 sin(\u03b8) + 24 sin(\u03b8)) + (468i cos(\u03b8) + 36i cos(\u03b8)) - (468 sin(\u03b8) + 36 sin(\u03b8)). Simplifying further, we get 276 cos(\u03b8) + 336i cos(\u03b8) + i(324 sin(\u03b8)) - 504 sin(\u03b8). Therefore, the expression simplifies to (276 cos(\u03b8) - 504 sin(\u03b8)) + i(336 cos(\u03b8) + 324 sin(\u03b8)). The real part of this expression is 276 cos(\u03b8) - 504 sin(\u03b8).; answer - (276 cos(\u03b8) - 504 sin(\u03b8)) + i(336 cos(\u03b8) + 324 sin(\u03b8))\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - From Sub-task 2, we have the expression (276 cos(\u03b8) - 504 sin(\u03b8)) + i(336 cos(\u03b8) + 324 sin(\u03b8)). The real part of this expression is the part without the imaginary unit i, which is 276 cos(\u03b8) - 504 sin(\u03b8).

This expression is of the form A cos(\u03b8) + B sin(\u03b8), where A = 276 and B = -504. We can rewrite it as R cos(\u03b8 - \u03c6), where R is the amplitude and \u03c6 is the phase shift. The amplitude R is given by R = sqrt(A^2 + B^2) = sqrt(276^2 + (-504)^2). The phase shift \u03c6 is determined by the tangent of \u03c6, which is tan(\u03c6) = B/A = -504/276. This form allows us to easily determine the maximum value of the expression, which is R, since the maximum value of cos(\u03b8 - \u03c6) is 1.

The cosine function reaches its maximum value of 1 when its argument is 0, or any multiple of 2\u03c0. Therefore, to maximize the expression, we set \u03b8 - \u03c6 = 0 (mod 2\u03c0), which implies \u03b8 = \u03c6. This is a standard result in trigonometric optimization, where the maximum value of a cosine function is achieved when its argument is zero.

From the given sub-task 4b, we have \u03c6 = arctan(-4/3). Therefore, the value of \u03b8 that maximizes the expression is \u03b8 = -arctan(-4/3). This is because the maximum value of the expression is achieved when the angle \u03b8 is the negative of the phase angle \u03c6, ensuring that the expression reaches its maximum value, which is the amplitude R.; answer - \u03b8 = -arctan(-4/3)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 6 output: thinking - To find the maximum value of the real part of the expression (75+117i)z + (96+144i)/z where |z|=4, we first rewrite the expression in terms of z = 4e^{i\u03b8}.
