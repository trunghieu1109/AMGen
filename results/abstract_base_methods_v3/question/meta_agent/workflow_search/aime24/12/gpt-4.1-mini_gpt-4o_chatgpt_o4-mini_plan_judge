Question: Find the largest possible real part of \[(75+117i)z+\frac{96+144i}{z}\]where $z$ is a complex number with $|z|=4$.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_1_12
proposed answer: From Sub-task 4, we have the expression for the real part as 552 cos(θ - φ). In Sub-task 5, we determined that the value of θ that maximizes this expression is θ = φ. Substituting θ = φ into the expression 552 cos(θ - φ), we get 552 cos(0), since θ - φ = 0. The cosine of 0 is 1, so the expression becomes 552 * 1 = 552. Therefore, the maximum value of the real part is 552.

proposed answer: To find the maximum value of the real part of the expression (75+117i)z + (96+144i)/z where |z|=4, we first rewrite the expression in terms of z = 4e^{iθ}. The expression becomes 4(75+117i)e^{iθ} + (96+144i)/(4e^{iθ}). Simplifying, we get (300+468i)e^{iθ} + (24+36i)e^{-iθ}. This can be further simplified to (300+468i)(cosθ + i sinθ) + (24+36i)(cosθ - i sinθ). The real part of this expression is 300cosθ - 468sinθ + 24cosθ + 36sinθ = (300+24)cosθ + (-468+36)sinθ = 324cosθ - 432sinθ. This is of the form A cosθ + B sinθ where A = 324 and B = -432. The maximum value of this expression is the amplitude R = sqrt(A^2 + B^2) = sqrt(324^2 + (-432)^2) = 540, as calculated in sub-task 4b. Therefore, the maximum value of the real part is 540.
