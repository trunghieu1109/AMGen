Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: In Sub-task 5, it was determined that the absolute difference between the radii of tangency circles, |r_i - r_o|, is 2. This difference is expressed as the fraction \( \frac{2}{1} \), where 2 and 1 are relatively prime. Therefore, m = 2 and n = 1. The sum m + n is calculated as 2 + 1 = 3. This is the final answer for the sum m + n. The Critic Agent confirmed that the final sum m+n is correct based on the given information.

proposed answer: The problem involves finding the difference between the radii of two tangent circles when a torus is externally tangent to a sphere. The difference was calculated as 4, expressed as the fraction 4/1. Since 4 and 1 are relatively prime, the fraction is in its simplest form. The problem asks for the sum of m and n, where m = 4 and n = 1. Therefore, m + n = 4 + 1 = 5. This calculation is consistent with the problem's requirements and the geometric setup. The final answer is the sum m + n, which is 5.
