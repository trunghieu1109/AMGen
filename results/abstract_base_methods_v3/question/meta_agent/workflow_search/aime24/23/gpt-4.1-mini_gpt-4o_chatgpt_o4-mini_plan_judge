Question: Find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid so that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is $999$, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is $99$. The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$.
\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\ \hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\ \hline \end{array}\]

proposed answer: In sub-task 6, we enumerated all possible assignments of digits to the grid cells that satisfy the given conditions. The conditions are: (1) the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is 999, and (2) the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99. The valid solutions found were: (a, b, c, d, e, f) = (0, 0, 8, 9, 9, 1), (0, 1, 8, 9, 8, 1), (0, 2, 8, 9, 7, 1), (0, 3, 8, 9, 6, 1), (0, 4, 8, 9, 5, 1), (0, 5, 8, 9, 4, 1), (0, 6, 8, 9, 3, 1), (0, 7, 8, 9, 2, 1), (0, 8, 8, 9, 1, 1), (0, 9, 8, 9, 0, 1). There are 10 such combinations, each satisfying both the horizontal and vertical sum conditions. Therefore, the total number of valid digit assignments is 10.

proposed answer: To count the total number of valid digit assignments, we need to consider the constraints given: the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is 999, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99. The constraints a + d = 9, b + e = 9, and c + f = 9 must hold, where a, b, c, d, e, f are digits from 0 to 9. Additionally, a + b + c = 8 and d + e + f = 19. We can enumerate all possible combinations of (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 8, and for each combination, find the corresponding (d, e, f) such that d = 9 - a, e = 9 - b, f = 9 - c, and check if d + e + f = 19. This ensures that the horizontal and vertical sum conditions are satisfied. By checking all combinations, we find that there are 12 valid digit assignments that satisfy all the conditions.
