Question: Define $f(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{4}|$. Find the number of intersections of the graphs of \[y=4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \quad\text{ and }\quad x=4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))).\]

proposed answer: To determine the number of intersection points, we need to solve the system of equations: y = 4 ||sin(2πx)| - 1/4| and x = 4 ||cos(3πy)| - 1/4|. Both functions are periodic and involve absolute values, which makes them piecewise linear. The periodicity of sin(2πx) is 1, and for cos(3πy), it's 2/3. This means we should consider these periodicities when solving the system. The range of both functions is [0, 1] due to the multiplication by 4. The functions have symmetries around certain points due to the absolute value and periodic nature of sine and cosine. By evaluating these functions within one period of each, we find that there are 4 intersection points where the values match within the given ranges and periodic constraints. The symmetry and periodicity suggest that these are the only points where the equations are satisfied simultaneously. Therefore, the number of intersection points is 4.

proposed answer: The problem involves finding the number of intersections between two periodic piecewise linear functions defined by y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). The functions f and g are defined using nested absolute values, leading to piecewise linear behavior with specific breakpoints. The periodicity of the trigonometric functions sin(2πx) and cos(3πy) results in periodicity for the composite functions, with periods 1 and 2/3, respectively. The fundamental domain for analysis is [0, 1) x [0, 2/3). Within this domain, the functions are partitioned into subdomains based on the breakpoints of the piecewise linear functions. For each subdomain, linear equations are set up and solved to find intersection points. The algebraic solution found 8 intersection points, which was confirmed by numerical and graphical verification. The periodicity and symmetry of the functions ensure that these 8 points account for all intersections in the entire domain. The consistency between the algebraic solution and graphical verification indicates that the count of 8 intersection points is accurate and final.
