Question: Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: The conditional probability that Jen wins the grand prize given that she wins a prize is already given as 1/115. This fraction is already in its simplest form because 1 and 115 are relatively prime (they have no common divisors other than 1). Therefore, the fraction cannot be simplified further. The problem asks for the sum of the numerator and the denominator of this simplified fraction. Since the fraction is 1/115, the numerator is 1 and the denominator is 115. The sum of these is 1 + 115 = 116.
