Question: Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations:
\[\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}\]\[\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}\]\[\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}\]
Then the value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_3_24
proposed answer: Both agents agree that the absolute value of \( \log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) \) is \( \frac{25}{8} \), which is already in its simplest form. The integers \( m = 25 \) and \( n = 8 \) are relatively prime, meaning they have no common factors other than 1. Therefore, the sum \( m + n \) is \( 25 + 8 = 33 \). This conclusion is consistent across both agents' analyses, confirming the correctness of the answer.

proposed answer: The problem requires finding the sum of m and n, where m/n is the reduced fraction representing the absolute value of the expression from the original problem. From the related sub-task, it was determined that the absolute value is 25/8, which is already in its simplest form. Therefore, m = 25 and n = 8. These numbers are relatively prime, meaning they have no common factors other than 1. The sum m + n is 25 + 8, which equals 33. This is the final integer answer for the problem.
