To express this system explicitly in terms of a, b, and c, we can rearrange each equation to solve for one variable in terms of the others. From equation 1, we have a = b + c + 1/2. From equation 2, we have b = a + c + 1/3. From equation 3, we have c = a + b + 1/4. However, these expressions are not isolated for a, b, and c individually. To solve the system, we can add all three equations together: (a - b - c) + (b - a - c) + (c - a - b) = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4. The left-hand side simplifies to -a - b - c, and the right-hand side simplifies to 13/12. Therefore, -a - b - c = 13/12, or a + b + c = -13/12. This is one equation that relates a, b, and c together. We can use this equation along with the original system to solve for a, b, and c explicitly.; answer - The explicit system of equations is: 1) a = b + c + 1/2, 2) b = a + c + 1/3, 3) c = a + b + 1/4, and 4) a + b + c = -13/12.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - To solve the system of linear equations, we have: 1) a = b + c + 1/2, 2) b = a + c + 1/3, 3) c = a + b + 1/4, and 4) a + b + c = -13/12. We can express one variable in terms of the others using equation 4. Let's express a in terms of b and c: a = -13/12 - b - c. Substitute this into equations 1, 2, and 3. For equation 1: -13/12 - b - c = b + c + 1/2, which simplifies to -13/12 = 2b + 2c + 1/2, or 2b + 2c = -19/12. So, b + c = -19/24. For equation 2: b = -13/12 - b - c + c + 1/3, which simplifies to b = -13/12 - b + 1/3, or 2b = -13/12 + 1/3 = -3/4. So, b = -3/8. For equation 3: c = -13/12 - b - c + b + 1/4, which simplifies to c = -13/12 - c + 1/4, or 2c = -5/6. So, c = -5/12. Now we have b = -3/8 and c = -5/12. Substitute these into b + c = -19/24 to check: -3/8 + (-5/12) = -19/24, which is correct. Now, find a: a = -13/12 - b - c = -13/12 + 3/8 + 5/12. Convert to common denominator: -13/12 = -26/24, 3/8 = 9/24, 5/12 = 10/24. So, a = -26/24 + 9/24 + 10/24 = -7/24. Therefore, a = -7/24, b = -3/8, c = -5/12.

Each equation is explicitly written as a linear combination of a, b, and c equal to a constant.

Adding these equations, we get: (a - b - c) + (b - a - c) + (c - a - b) = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4. On the left side, the terms a and -a, b and -b, c and -c cancel out, resulting in -a - b - c. Therefore, -a - b - c = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4. To simplify the right side, we find a common denominator: 1/2 = 6/12, 1/3 = 4/12, 1/4 = 3/12, so 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 = 6/12 + 4/12 + 3/12 = 13/12.

To solve for a, b, and c, we can use the sum equation to express one variable in terms of the others. Let's express a in terms of b and c: a = -13/12 - b - c. Substitute this into the first equation: (-13/12 - b - c) - b - c = 1/2. Simplifying, we get -13/12 - 2b - 2c = 1/2. Multiply through by 12 to clear fractions: -13 - 24b - 24c = 6. Rearrange to get 24b + 24c = -19. Divide by 24: b + c = -19/24. Now, substitute a = -13/12 - b - c into the second equation: b - (-13/12 - b - c) - c = 1/3. Simplify: b + 13/12 + b + c - c = 1/3, which simplifies to 2b + 13/12 = 1/3. Multiply by 12: 24b + 13 = 4. So, 24b = -9, and b = -9/24 = -3/8. Now, substitute b = -3/8 into b + c = -19/24: -3/8 + c = -19/24. Convert -3/8 to -9/24: -9/24 + c = -19/24. So, c = -19/24 + 9/24 = -10/24 = -5/12. Finally, substitute b = -3/8 and c = -5/12 into a = -13/12 - b - c: a = -13/12 + 3/8 + 5/12. Convert to common denominator: -13/12 = -26/24, 3/8 = 9/24, 5/12 = 10/24.

Substituting a = -7/24, b = -3/8, and c = -5/12, we convert each term to a common denominator and perform the arithmetic. For equation 1: a - b - c = (-7/24) - (-9/24) - (-10/24) = 12/24 = 1/2, which is correct. For equation 2: b - a - c = (-9/24) - (-7/24) - (-10/24) = 8/24 = 1/3, which is correct.

We need to compute log2(x^4 y^3 z^2) using these values. By the properties of logarithms, log2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = 4*log2(x) + 3*log2(y) + 2*log2(z) = 4a + 3b + 2c. Substituting the given values, we have: 4a = 4*(-7/24) = -28/24, 3b = 3*(-3/8) = -9/8 = -27/24, and 2c = 2*(-5/12) = -10/12 = -20/24. Adding these together: 4a + 3b + 2c = -28/24 - 27/24 - 20/24 = -75/24. Simplifying -75/24 gives -25/8. The problem asks for the absolute value, so we take |-25/8| = 25/8.
