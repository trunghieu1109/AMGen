Question: Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?

proposed answer: From Sub-task 5, we found that the probability fraction m/n in its lowest terms is 71/128. Here, m = 71 and n = 128. The problem asks for the sum m+n, which is simply 71 + 128. Therefore, the sum m+n is 199.

proposed answer: The problem involves determining the probability that a regular octagon with vertices independently colored red or blue can be rotated such that all blue vertices map to positions originally occupied by red vertices. The total number of ways to color the octagon is 2^8 = 256. To find the number of valid colorings that satisfy the condition, we use Burnside's Lemma, which considers the symmetries of the octagon (rotations). For each rotation, we determine the number of colorings that remain unchanged. The calculations are: |A_0| = 256 for the identity rotation, |A_1| = |A_3| = |A_5| = |A_7| = 2 for rotations by 45, 135, 225, and 315 degrees, |A_2| = |A_6| = 16 for rotations by 90 and 270 degrees, and |A_4| = 4 for the rotation by 180 degrees. Applying Burnside's Lemma, the number of valid colorings is (256 + 4*2 + 2*16 + 4)/8 = 36. The probability is thus 36/256, which reduces to 9/64. Therefore, m = 9 and n = 64, and their sum is m+n = 73. The answer is 73.
