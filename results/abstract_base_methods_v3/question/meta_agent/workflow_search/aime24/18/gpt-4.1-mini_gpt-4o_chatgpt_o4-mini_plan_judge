Question: Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). Then \(OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\).

proposed answer: The unique point C on segment AB is given as C = (1/3, sqrt(3)/6). We need to calculate OC^2, where O = (0,0) is the origin. The distance squared, OC^2, is calculated using the distance formula: OC^2 = (1/3)^2 + (sqrt(3)/6)^2. Calculating each term, we have (1/3)^2 = 1/9 and (sqrt(3)/6)^2 = 3/36 = 1/12. To add these fractions, we find a common denominator, which is 36. Thus, OC^2 = 4/36 + 3/36 = 7/36. Therefore, OC^2 = 7/36. The problem asks for the sum p + q, where OC^2 = p/q. Here, p = 7 and q = 36, which are relatively prime, so p + q = 7 + 36 = 43. This confirms that the calculations are consistent and correct.

proposed answer: In Sub-task 7, we determined that the coordinates of point C are (1/4, sqrt(3)/4) by analyzing its position on segment AB and the condition that it does not belong to any other segment in the family \(\mathcal{F}\) except \(\overline{AB}\). We calculated \(OC\) as the distance from the origin to point C, which is \(\sqrt{(1/4)^2 + (\sqrt{3}/4)^2} = \sqrt{1/16 + 3/16} = \sqrt{4/16} = \sqrt{1/4} = 1/2\). Therefore, \(OC^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4\). The fraction \(1/4\) is in its simplest form, with \(p = 1\) and \(q = 4\). The sum \(p + q = 1 + 4 = 5\). This matches the result obtained previously, confirming the correctness of the calculations.
