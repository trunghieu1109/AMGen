        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The given expression a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b can be rewritten by factoring terms. Notice that each term is of the form x^2y, where x and y are distinct variables from a, b, c. We can group the terms as follows: a^2b + a^2c = a^2(b + c), b^2a + b^2c = b^2(a + c), c^2a + c^2b = c^2(a + b). Since a + b + c = 300, we can substitute b + c = 300 - a, a + c = 300 - b, and a + b = 300 - c into these expressions. Thus, the expression becomes a^2(300 - a) + b^2(300 - b) + c^2(300 - c). This is a symmetric form that relates the expression to the sum a + b + c = 300.; answer - The expression a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b can be rewritten as a^2(300 - a) + b^2(300 - b) + c^2(300 - c) using the relation a + b + c = 300.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - We have the expression from sub-task 1: a^2(300 - a) + b^2(300 - b) + c^2(300 - c). To express this in terms of symmetric sums, we can expand each term: a^2(300 - a) = 300a^2 - a^3, b^2(300 - b) = 300b^2 - b^3, c^2(300 - c) = 300c^2 - c^3. Adding these, we get 300(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) - (a^3 + b^3 + c^3). Now, note that a^2 + b^2 + c^2 can be expressed using the symmetric sums as (a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca), which is 300^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca). Therefore, the expression becomes 300(300^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca)) - (a^3 + b^3 + c^3). Additionally, a^3 + b^3 + c^3 can be expressed in terms of symmetric sums as (a + b + c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - bc - ca) + 3abc. Substituting a + b + c = 300, we get a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 300(300^2 - 3(ab + bc + ca)) + 3abc. Thus, the entire expression in terms of symmetric sums is 300(300^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca)) - [300(300^2 - 3(ab + bc + ca)) + 3abc].; answer - The simplified symmetric expression is 300(300^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca)) - [300(300^2 - 3(ab + bc + ca)) + 3abc].\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - We have the expression from sub-task 2: 300(300^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca)) - [300(300^2 - 3(ab + bc + ca)) + 3abc]. We need to set this equal to 6,000,000. Let's simplify this expression. First, expand the terms: 300(300^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca)) = 300 * 300^2 - 600(ab + bc + ca). The second part is 300(300^2 - 3(ab + bc + ca)) + 3abc = 300 * 300^2 - 900(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc. Subtracting these, we get: (300 * 300^2 - 600(ab + bc + ca)) - (300 * 300^2 - 900(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc) = 300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc. We set this equal to 6,000,000: 300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000. Dividing the entire equation by 3 gives: 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.

This is a complex problem involving both a linear and a nonlinear equation. The first step is to consider the linear equation a + b + c = 300, which defines a plane in 3D space where the solutions are integer lattice points. The second equation, 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000, is a constraint that further restricts these points. We can try to solve this by iterating over possible values of a, b, and c such that a + b + c = 300. For each combination, we compute ab + bc + ca and abc, and check if they satisfy the second equation. However, given the large range of possibilities (a, b, c can each be up to 300), this is computationally intensive. Instead, we might look for patterns or use symmetry to reduce the number of cases. For example, we can assume a >= b >= c without loss of generality to reduce the search space. However, even with these reductions, finding all solutions manually is impractical without computational assistance. Therefore, while theoretically possible, enumerating all such triples manually is not feasible without further insights or computational tools.; answer - Enumerating all possible triples manually is impractical due to the complexity of the constraints. Computational tools or further insights are needed to solve this efficiently.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - The problem involves two equations: a + b + c = 300 and a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.

Thus, the entire expression becomes 300(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) - (a^3 + b^3 + c^3). Now, we use the identity for symmetric sums: a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = (a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca). Substituting a + b + c = 300, we have a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 300^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca).

To reduce the search space, we can assume without loss of generality that a \u2265 b \u2265 c, which implies a \u2265 b and b \u2265 c = 300 - a - b. This ordering reduces the search space because we only need to consider cases where a \u2265 b and b \u2265 300 - a - b. Since a + b + c = 300, we have c = 300 - a - b, and thus b \u2265 300 - a - b implies 2b \u2265 300 - a, or a \u2265 300 - 2b.

We can iterate over a from 0 to 300, and for each a, iterate over b from 0 to min(a, 150), due to the constraint a \u2265 300 - 2b, which simplifies to b \u2264 (300 - a) / 2.
