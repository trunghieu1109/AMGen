Question: Find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon ($12$-gon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The diagram below shows three of those rectangles.

proposed answer: To determine the total number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon, we need to consider the pairs of perpendicular diagonals and sides that can form rectangles. Each vertex of the dodecagon can be used as a starting point to form rectangles using the diagonals and sides. For each vertex A_k, we can form two rectangles: one using the diagonals A_kA_{k+3} and A_{k+3}A_{k+6}, and another using A_kA_{k+6} and A_{k+6}A_{k}. Since there are 12 vertices in the dodecagon, and each vertex can be the starting point for 2 rectangles, this initially suggests 12 * 2 = 24 rectangles. However, each rectangle is counted twice (once for each pair of opposite corners), so we divide by 2 to avoid double-counting, resulting in a total of 12 unique rectangles. Therefore, the correct total number of rectangles is 12.

proposed answer: The problem involves counting the number of distinct rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon, where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The sub-task 9 has already established that the enumeration of rectangles has been verified using different methods, including combinatorial counting and explicit enumeration, and both methods have consistently resulted in the same count of 66 rectangles. The use of geometric properties and symmetries of the dodecagon ensures that each rectangle is counted once. Therefore, the final decision on the accurate enumeration of rectangles formed inside the dodecagon is 66, and this is the total number of distinct rectangles that can be formed.
