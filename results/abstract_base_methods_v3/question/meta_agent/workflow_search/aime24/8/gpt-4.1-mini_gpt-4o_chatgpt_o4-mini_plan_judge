Question: Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.

proposed answer: The game involves removing either 1 or 4 tokens, and the winning and losing positions form a periodic pattern. In combinatorial games like this, the positions where the first player (Alice) is in a losing position are key to determining the second player's (Bob's) winning strategy. The pattern repeats every 5 positions, as observed in such games. For every 5 consecutive numbers, there are exactly two positions (n = 2 and n = 5) where Bob can guarantee a win. Therefore, for every complete cycle of 5 numbers, Bob wins 2 times. To find the number of such positions up to 2024, we calculate the number of complete cycles: 2024 / 5 = 404 complete cycles. Since there are 2 winning positions per cycle, the total number of winning positions for Bob is 404 * 2 = 808. Thus, the correct count of winning positions for Bob is 808.

proposed answer: The classification of positions as winning or losing is consistent with the principles of combinatorial game theory. A position is losing if every possible move leaves the opponent in a winning position, and winning if there exists at least one move that leaves the opponent in a losing position. The recurrence relation used correctly identifies losing positions as those where both n-1 and n-4 are winning positions. The pattern detection step identified that losing positions occur when n mod 5 is 0 or 2, which was validated by checking several positions. This pattern is consistent with the rules of the game, as removing 1 or 4 tokens from a position where n mod 5 is 0 or 2 will leave the opponent in a position where n mod 5 is not 0 or 2, thus in a winning position. The counting step correctly identified the number of such positions up to 2024 by considering the arithmetic sequences formed by n mod 5 = 0 and n mod 5 = 2. The calculations were verified to be consistent with the periodic pattern and the arithmetic sequences. Therefore, the final count of 809 positions where Bob has a winning strategy is consistent with the principles of combinatorial game theory and the analysis provided.

Answer:The final count of positions where Bob has a winning strategy is 809, consistent with the pattern that losing positions occur when n mod 5 is 0 or 2.
