Question: Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_1_14
proposed answer: The problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD^2 for all rhombi ABCD on the hyperbola with diagonals intersecting at the origin. From the analysis, BD^2 can approach 80 from above but never be less than 80. Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD^2 is effectively 80. The integer part of this greatest real number is the greatest integer less than 80, which is 79. This is because the greatest integer less than a number is the largest integer that is strictly less than that number.
