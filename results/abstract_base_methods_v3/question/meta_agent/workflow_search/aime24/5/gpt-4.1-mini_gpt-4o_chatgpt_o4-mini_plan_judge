Question: Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.

proposed answer: In Sub-task 8, the inradius was expressed as \( \frac{\sqrt{41}}{20} \), which is in the form \( \frac{m \sqrt{n}}{p} \) with \( m = 1 \), \( n = 41 \), and \( p = 20 \). These values satisfy the conditions: \( m \) and \( p \) are coprime, and \( n \) is square-free. Therefore, the sum \( m + n + p = 1 + 41 + 20 = 62 \) is the correct final answer.

proposed answer: In Sub-task 7, the inradius of the tetrahedron was simplified to the form (m * sqrt(n)) / p, where m and p are coprime integers and n is square-free. The inradius was found to be 18 / 55, which corresponds to m = 18, n = 1, and p = 55. These values satisfy the conditions: m and p are coprime, and n is square-free. Therefore, the sum m + n + p is 18 + 1 + 55 = 74. This is the final integer answer for the sum m + n + p.
