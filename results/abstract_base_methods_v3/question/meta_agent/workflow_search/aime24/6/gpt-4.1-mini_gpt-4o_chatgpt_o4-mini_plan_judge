Question: Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_1_6
proposed answer: In sub-task 5, we determined that the value of r^2 is 97/16, where 97 and 16 are relatively prime. Therefore, p = 97 and q = 16. The sum p + q is 97 + 16, which equals 113. This is the final answer to the query.

proposed answer: In sub-task 5, we determined that the value of r^2 is 619/36, where 619 and 36 are relatively prime. Therefore, p = 619 and q = 36. The sum p + q is 619 + 36 = 655. This is the final answer to the query, as it directly follows from the reduced fraction obtained for r^2.
