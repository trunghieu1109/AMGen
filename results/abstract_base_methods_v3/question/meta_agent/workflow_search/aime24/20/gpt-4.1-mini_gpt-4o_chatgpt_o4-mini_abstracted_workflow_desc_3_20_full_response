Question: Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\).

Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Reflexion Agent 1UfR', content='To determine the smallest base b for which there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers, we need to enumerate the b-eautiful numbers for each base starting from b = 2. A b-eautiful number n in base b is represented as n = x*b + y, where x and y are digits such that 1 ≤ x < b and 0 ≤ y < b. The condition for n to be b-eautiful is that x + y = sqrt(n), meaning x + y must be a perfect square and n = (x + y)^2. We iterate over all possible pairs (x, y) for each base b, checking if x + y is a perfect square and if n equals (x + y)^2. We count the number of such valid pairs for each base. By starting from b = 2 and increasing, we apply this process to find the least base with more than ten b-eautiful numbers. After performing this enumeration, we find that for b = 14, there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers.
