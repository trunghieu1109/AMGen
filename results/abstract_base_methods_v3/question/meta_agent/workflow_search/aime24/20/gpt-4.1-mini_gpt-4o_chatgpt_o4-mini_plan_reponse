This is because the value of the number is determined by the place values of its digits, with the leftmost digit being multiplied by the base to the power of its position (which is 1 for the leftmost digit in a two-digit number) and the rightmost digit being multiplied by the base to the power of 0 (which is 1).; answer - n = x * b + y\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - From sub-task 1, we have the expression for the two-digit number n in base b as n = x * b + y, where x and y are the digits. The condition given is that the sum of the two digits x and y equals the square root of n, which can be written as x + y = \\sqrt{n}. Substituting the expression for n, we have x + y = \\sqrt{x * b + y}. This equation relates the sum of the digits to the square root of the number expressed in base b.; answer - x + y = \\sqrt{x * b + y}\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - To derive the equation, we start with the condition that the sum of the digits x and y equals the square root of the number n, which is expressed in base b as n = x * b + y. This gives us the equation x + y = \\sqrt{x * b + y}. Squaring both sides, we obtain (x + y)^2 = x * b + y. Expanding the left side, we have x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = x * b + y. Rearranging terms, we get x^2 + 2xy + y^2 - y = x * b. This equation relates b, x, and y and is suitable for analysis because it expresses b in terms of x and y, which are the digits of the number in base b. The limitations of this equation include the requirement that x and y are valid digits in base b, meaning 0 <= x, y < b, and that the resulting n must be a perfect square. These conditions must be checked to ensure valid solutions.; answer - x^2 + 2xy + y^2 - y = x * b\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - In a base b numeral system, a two-digit number can be expressed as n = xb + y, where x is the digit in the 'b's place and y is the digit in the 'units' place. For n to be a two-digit number in base b, x must be at least 1 (since if x were 0, it would be a one-digit number) and less than b (since x is a digit in base b). Therefore, 1 \u2264 x < b. The digit y can be any digit from 0 to b-1, so 0 \u2264 y < b. The problem states that the sum of these two digits, x + y, must equal \u221an. Since n = xb + y, we have x + y = \u221a(xb + y). The base b must be at least 2, so b \u2265 2. These constraints help us determine the possible values for x, y, and b that satisfy the conditions of the problem.; answer - The valid ranges are: 0 \u2264 y < b, 1 \u2264 x < b, and b \u2265 2.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - To determine all b-eautiful numbers for a fixed base b, we need to find pairs of digits (x, y) such that the number n = x * b + y is a perfect square and the sum of the digits x + y equals the square root of n.

We iterate over possible values of x and y, where 1 \u2264 x < b and 0 \u2264 y < b, and check if they satisfy this equation. If they do, then n = x * b + y is a b-eautiful number. This process is repeated for each base b to identify all b-eautiful numbers for that base.; answer - Iterate over 1 \u2264 x < b and 0 \u2264 y < b for a fixed b, checking if x^2 + 2xy + y^2 - y = x * b holds and n = x * b + y is a perfect square with x + y = \u221an.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 6 output: thinking - To determine the count of b-eautiful numbers for a given base b, we need to iterate over all possible digit pairs (x, y) where 1 \u2264 x < b and 0 \u2264 y < b.

This involves checking the equation x^2 + 2xy + y^2 - y = x * b. If both conditions are satisfied, then n is a b-eautiful number. By counting all such valid pairs, we determine the total number of b-eautiful numbers for the given base b.
