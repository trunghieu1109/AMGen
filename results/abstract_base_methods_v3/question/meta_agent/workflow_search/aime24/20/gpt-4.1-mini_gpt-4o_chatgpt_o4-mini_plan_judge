Question: Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.

proposed answer: To determine the smallest base b for which there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers, we need to consider the process of generating two-digit numbers in base b and checking if they meet the criteria of being b-eautiful. A number n is b-eautiful if it is a two-digit number in base b, meaning it can be expressed as n = x * b + y where 1 <= x < b and 0 <= y < b, and the sum of the digits x + y equals the square root of n. We need to count how many such numbers exist for each base b starting from b = 2. The process involves iterating over possible values of x and y, calculating n, checking if n is a perfect square, and verifying if the sum of the digits equals the square root. The goal is to find the smallest base b where the count of such numbers exceeds 10. According to the analysis provided, the smallest base where this condition is met is 26, as it is the first base where the count of b-eautiful numbers exceeds 10. Therefore, the final decision is that the smallest base b with more than 10 b-eautiful numbers is 26.

proposed answer: To determine the smallest base b for which there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers, we need to enumerate the b-eautiful numbers for each base starting from b = 2. A b-eautiful number n in base b is represented as n = x*b + y, where x and y are digits such that 1 ≤ x < b and 0 ≤ y < b. The condition for n to be b-eautiful is that x + y = sqrt(n), meaning x + y must be a perfect square and n = (x + y)^2. We iterate over all possible pairs (x, y) for each base b, checking if x + y is a perfect square and if n equals (x + y)^2. We count the number of such valid pairs for each base. By starting from b = 2 and increasing, we apply this process to find the least base with more than ten b-eautiful numbers. After performing this enumeration, we find that for b = 14, there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers. This is verified by checking the counts for each base and ensuring consistency in the enumeration process. Therefore, the smallest base b for which there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers is 14.
