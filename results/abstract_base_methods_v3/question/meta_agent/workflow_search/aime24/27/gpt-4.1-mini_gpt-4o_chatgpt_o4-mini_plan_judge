Question: Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_0_27
proposed answer: The problem requires us to find the sum of Q and R, where Q is the quotient and R is the remainder when the greatest four-digit number N, which satisfies the given divisibility condition, is divided by 1000. From Sub-task 6, we have determined that this number N is 9857. When we divide 9857 by 1000, the quotient Q is 9 and the remainder R is 857. Therefore, the sum Q + R is 9 + 857 = 866. The reasoning provided in Sub-task 6 is thorough and correct, leading to the conclusion that Q + R is indeed 866.

proposed answer: From Sub-task 6, the greatest four-digit number N that satisfies the condition is 7770. When 7770 is divided by 1000, the quotient Q is 7 and the remainder R is 770. Therefore, Q + R = 7 + 770 = 777. This matches the problem's requirement to find the sum of the quotient and remainder when N is divided by 1000.
