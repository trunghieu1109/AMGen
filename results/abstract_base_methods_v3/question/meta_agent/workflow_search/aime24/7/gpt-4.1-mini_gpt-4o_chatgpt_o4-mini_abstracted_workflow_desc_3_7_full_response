From the first equation, we can express ln y in terms of ln x: ln y = (10 ln x) / x. Substituting this into the second equation gives: 10((10 ln x) / x) = 4y ln x, which simplifies to 100 ln x / x = 4y ln x. Dividing both sides by ln x (assuming ln x ≠ 0) gives 100 / x = 4y, so y = 25 / x. Substituting y = 25 / x back into ln y = (10 ln x) / x gives ln(25 / x) = (10 ln x) / x, which simplifies to ln 25 - ln x = (10 ln x) / x.
