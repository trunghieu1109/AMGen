Question: Define $f(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{4}|$. Find the number of intersections of the graphs of \[y=4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \quad\text{ and }\quad x=4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))).\]

proposed answer: To determine the number of intersections of the graphs y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))), we need to find the points (x, y) such that 4g(f(sin(2πx))) = y and 4g(f(cos(3πy))) = x. From previous analysis, both functions have a range of [0, 1] and are piecewise linear. The function 4g(f(sin(2πx))) is periodic with period 1, while 4g(f(cos(3πy))) is periodic with period 2/3. Within one period of 4g(f(sin(2πx))), which is [0, 1], the function is piecewise linear with critical points at x = 0, 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, and 1. Similarly, within one period of 4g(f(cos(3πy))), which is [0, 2/3], the function is piecewise linear with critical points at y = 0, 1/4, and 1/2. To find intersections, we equate the two functions: 4g(f(sin(2πx))) = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). This means we need to find x and y such that f(sin(2πx)) = f(cos(3πy)). Since both f(sin(2πx)) and f(cos(3πy)) have a range of [0, 1/2], we need to find when these two expressions are equal. The function f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| is symmetric around x = 0 and x = 1/2, so it is sufficient to consider the intervals [0, 1/2] for both sin(2πx) and cos(3πy). The intersections occur when sin(2πx) = cos(3πy) or when |sin(2πx) - 1/2| = |cos(3πy) - 1/2|. Solving these equations over the respective periods, we find that there are 4 intersections within one period of 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and 4g(f(cos(3πy))). The periodicity of the functions ensures that these intersections repeat, but within one period, there are 4 distinct intersections. The analysis assumes that the intersections are evenly distributed and does not account for potential symmetries or additional intersections that might occur due to the specific form of the functions. However, given the periodicity and symmetry, 4 intersections is a reasonable conclusion.

proposed answer: The intersection points identified in the previous analysis are (0, 0), (1/2, 1/2), and (1, 1). These are the points where the graphs of the functions y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) intersect. Since these are the only points where the values of the two functions are equal, the number of intersection points is simply the count of these points. There are three such points: (0, 0), (1/2, 1/2), and (1, 1). Therefore, the number of intersection points is 3.
