    <pre>Related original question:

Define $f(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{4}|$. Find the number of intersections of the graphs of \[y=4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \quad\text{ and }\quad x=4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))).\]. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 8: Make final decision on intersection points. 

 ### thinking by Final Decision Agent FCgf:
Both agents have analyzed the problem and determined that the intersections occur at points where the expressions 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and 4g(f(cos(3πy))) are equal. The functions are periodic and range from 0 to 1. The specific values where intersections occur are determined by the periodic nature and the discrete evaluation of the functions. Both agents agree that the intersections occur at (0, 0), (1/2, 1/2), and (1, 1). These points are where both functions achieve the same value, either 0 or 1, due to the periodicity and symmetry of the functions involved. Therefore, the final decision on the intersection points is consistent with the analysis provided by both agents.

### answer by Final Decision Agent FCgf:
(0, 0), (1/2, 1/2), (1, 1)

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 9: Count the number of intersection points to find the final answer. 

 then justify completely and detailedly why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. Again, your task is only to answer the question Sub-task 9: Count the number of intersection points to find the final answer. and explaination.</pre>

    <pre>The intersection points identified in the previous analysis are (0, 0), (1/2, 1/2), and (1, 1). These are the points where the graphs of the functions y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) intersect. Since these are the only points where the values of the two functions are equal, the number of intersection points is simply the count of these points. There are three such points: (0, 0), (1/2, 1/2), and (1, 1). Therefore, the number of intersection points is 3.
