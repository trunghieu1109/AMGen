    <pre>Related original question:

Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice&#39;s play.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 6: Convert the count of winning positions for Bob into the final answer format required by the query. 

 ### thinking by Debate Agent cHh2:
The original query asks for the number of positive integers n less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a strategy to guarantee a win. From Sub-task 5, it was determined that there are 405 such positions where n is of the form 5k + 2. This pattern ensures that Bob can always force a win regardless of Alice&#39;s moves. The query specifically asks for the count of these integers, so the final answer is simply this integer value, 405. The analysis has shown that these are the only configurations where Bob can guarantee a win, and hence, the count is already in the required format. Therefore, the answer to Sub-task 6 is the integer 405, which represents the number of such positions.

The original query asks for the number of positive integers n less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a strategy to guarantee a win. From the analysis in Sub-task 5, it was determined that there are 405 such positions where n is of the form 5k + 2. This pattern ensures that Bob can always force a win regardless of Alice&#39;s moves. Since the query requires the count of these winning positions, the answer is simply the integer 405, which represents the number of such positions. The analysis has shown that these are the only configurations where Bob can guarantee a win, and hence, the count is already in the required format.

### answer by Debate Agent cHh2:
405

    <pre>The original problem requires finding the number of positive integers n less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy. From the analysis provided, it was determined that Bob can guarantee a win when n is of the form 5k + 2. This is because, in these positions, Bob can always respond to Alice&#39;s moves in a way that eventually forces Alice into a losing position. The count of such positions up to 2024 is 405, as calculated in the previous sub-tasks. Therefore, the final answer to the original query is the integer 405, which represents the number of positions where Bob can guarantee a win. This conclusion is based on the pattern identified and the calculations performed, which have been verified to be correct.
