    <pre>Related original question:

Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice&#39;s play..

### Sub-task 4: Apply the strategy or algorithm to count the number of positive integers n less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy. 

 ### thinking #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent UjFv:
To determine the number of positive integers n less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy, we use the strategy identified: Bob wins if n is a multiple of 5. This is because if n is a multiple of 5, Bob can always leave a multiple of 5 for Alice, ensuring that Alice cannot win. Therefore, we need to count the number of multiples of 5 from 1 to 2024. The smallest multiple of 5 is 5 itself, and the largest multiple of 5 less than or equal to 2024 is the largest integer k such that 5k &lt;= 2024. Solving for k, we have k = floor(2024 / 5). Calculating this gives k = 404. Therefore, there are 404 multiples of 5 from 1 to 2024, and for each of these, Bob has a winning strategy. The reasoning is based on the pattern observed in the game, where Bob can force a win by leaving a multiple of 5 for Alice, ensuring that Alice cannot win. This pattern holds for all n up to 2024, as the game rules and strategy do not change.

### answer #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent UjFv:
404

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 5: Synthesize the results to provide the final count of such integers n, ensuring the solution is consistent with the conditions and strategy developed. 

 then justify completely and detailedly why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. Again, your task is only to answer the question Sub-task 5: Synthesize the results to provide the final count of such integers n, ensuring the solution is consistent with the conditions and strategy developed. and explaination.</pre>

    <pre>The problem involves determining the number of integers n less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy in the game. From the analysis, we know that Bob has a winning strategy if n is a multiple of 5. This is because if n is a multiple of 5, Bob can always play in such a way that he leaves a multiple of 5 for Alice, ensuring that Alice cannot win. To find the number of such integers, we need to count the multiples of 5 from 1 to 2024. The smallest multiple of 5 is 5, and the largest multiple of 5 less than or equal to 2024 is found by calculating the largest integer k such that 5k &lt;= 2024. This is given by k = floor(2024 / 5), which equals 404. Therefore, there are 404 multiples of 5 from 1 to 2024, and for each of these, Bob has a winning strategy. This count is consistent with the conditions and strategy developed, as the game rules and strategy do not change for different values of n.
