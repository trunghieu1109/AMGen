Question: Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.

proposed answer: The problem involves determining the number of integers n less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy in the game. From the analysis, we know that Bob has a winning strategy if n is a multiple of 5. This is because if n is a multiple of 5, Bob can always play in such a way that he leaves a multiple of 5 for Alice, ensuring that Alice cannot win. To find the number of such integers, we need to count the multiples of 5 from 1 to 2024. The smallest multiple of 5 is 5, and the largest multiple of 5 less than or equal to 2024 is found by calculating the largest integer k such that 5k <= 2024. This is given by k = floor(2024 / 5), which equals 404. Therefore, there are 404 multiples of 5 from 1 to 2024, and for each of these, Bob has a winning strategy. This count is consistent with the conditions and strategy developed, as the game rules and strategy do not change for different values of n.

Question: Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.
Iteration: abstract_workflow_3_8
proposed answer: The original problem requires finding the number of positive integers n less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy. From the analysis provided, it was determined that Bob can guarantee a win when n is of the form 5k + 2. This is because, in these positions, Bob can always respond to Alice's moves in a way that eventually forces Alice into a losing position. The count of such positions up to 2024 is 405, as calculated in the previous sub-tasks. Therefore, the final answer to the original query is the integer 405, which represents the number of positions where Bob can guarantee a win. This conclusion is based on the pattern identified and the calculations performed, which have been verified to be correct.
