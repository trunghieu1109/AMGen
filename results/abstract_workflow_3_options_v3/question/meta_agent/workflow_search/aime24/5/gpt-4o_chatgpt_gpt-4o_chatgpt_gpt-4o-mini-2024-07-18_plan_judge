Question: Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.

proposed answer: In the previous sub-task, the inradius of the tetrahedron was expressed as \( \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{4} \). This expression is already in the form \( \frac{m\sqrt{n}}{p} \) with \( m = 3 \), \( n = 2 \), and \( p = 4 \). We verified that \( m \) and \( p \) are relatively prime, and \( n \) is not divisible by the square of any prime. Therefore, the values obtained are correct. The sum \( m + n + p = 3 + 2 + 4 = 9 \).

proposed answer: Both agents have calculated the inradius of the tetrahedron using the formula r = 3V / S, where V is the volume and S is the surface area. They used the Cayley-Menger determinant to find the volume and Heron's formula for the areas of the triangular faces. The symmetry in the edge lengths suggests a special structure, simplifying the calculations. Both agents independently arrived at the values m = 8, n = 5, and p = 15, ensuring that m and p are relatively prime and n is not divisible by the square of any prime. Therefore, the sum m + n + p = 8 + 5 + 15 = 28. This consistent result across both agents confirms the correctness of the calculations and the symmetry of the tetrahedron.
