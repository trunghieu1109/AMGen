    <pre>Related original question:

Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$..

### Sub-task 6: Calculate the probability of winning the grand prize given that a prize is won. 

 ### thinking #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent sq4D:
To calculate the probability of winning the grand prize given that a prize is won, we use the formula for conditional probability: P(Grand Prize | Prize) = P(Grand Prize and Prize) / P(Prize). Since winning the grand prize means winning a prize, P(Grand Prize and Prize) is simply P(Grand Prize). From the previous sub-tasks, we have P(Grand Prize) = 1/210 and P(Prize) = 23/42. Therefore, P(Grand Prize | Prize) = (1/210) / (23/42). To divide by a fraction, we multiply by its reciprocal: (1/210) * (42/23) = 42/(210*23). Simplifying, 42/210 reduces to 1/5, so we have (1/5) * (1/23) = 1/115. Thus, the probability of winning the grand prize given that a prize is won is 1/115. The fraction 1/115 is in simplest form, so m = 1 and n = 115, giving m+n = 116.

### answer #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent sq4D:
116

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 7: Find m and n such that the probability from subtask_6 is m/n, and calculate m+n. 

 then justify completely and detailedly why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. Again, your task is only to answer the question Sub-task 7: Find m and n such that the probability from subtask_6 is m/n, and calculate m+n. and explaination.</pre>

    <pre>From sub-task 6, we found that the probability of winning the grand prize given that a prize is won is 1/115. This probability is already in the form m/n where m = 1 and n = 115, since 1 and 115 are relatively prime. Therefore, m+n = 1+115 = 116.
