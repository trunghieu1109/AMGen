Question: Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?

proposed answer: Both agents have simplified the probability fraction 18/256 to 9/128 by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 18 and 256, which is 2. They divided both the numerator and the denominator by 2 to get the simplest form of the fraction. Since 9 and 128 have no common divisors other than 1, 9/128 is indeed in its simplest form. The problem asks for the sum of the numerator and the denominator of this simplest form fraction, which is 9 + 128. Both agents correctly calculated this sum as 137. Therefore, the final decision on m+n is 137.

proposed answer: In sub-task 7, the probability that the octagon can be rotated so that all blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices was determined to be 5/64. This fraction is already in its simplest form, as 5 and 64 are relatively prime (they have no common divisors other than 1). Therefore, the values of m and n are 5 and 64, respectively. To compute m+n, we simply add these two numbers together: 5 + 64 = 69. This is the sum of the numerator and the denominator of the simplified fraction, which is what the question is asking for.
