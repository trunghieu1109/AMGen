    <pre>Related original question:

Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$..

### Sub-task 4: Express the square of the radius as a fraction in simplest form and find the sum of the numerator and denominator. 

 ### thinking #3 by Debate Agent EVN1:
To solve Sub-task 4, we need to express the square of the radius, r^2, in its simplest fractional form and find the sum of the numerator and denominator. From the previous sub-tasks, we have determined that r^2 = 137.25/4, which simplifies to the fraction 549/16. We need to check if this fraction is in its simplest form. The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 549 and 16 is 1, indicating that the fraction is indeed in its simplest form. Therefore, the numerator p is 549 and the denominator q is 16. The sum of the numerator and the denominator is p + q = 549 + 16 = 565. This confirms that the fraction is in its simplest form and the sum of the numerator and denominator is correct.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent 6E9j:
The square of the radius, r^2, was calculated by determining the diagonal of the box with dimensions (1, 2, 11.5) as \( \sqrt{137.25} \). The radius r of the smallest sphere that can contain the box is half of this diagonal, so \( r = \frac{\sqrt{137.25}}{2} \). Squaring this expression gives \( r^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{137.25}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{137.25}{4} = \frac{549}{16} \). This fraction is already in its simplest form since 549 and 16 have no common factors other than 1. Therefore, the numerator p = 549 and the denominator q = 16. The sum of the numerator and denominator is \( p + q = 549 + 16 = 565 \). This confirms the calculations and ensures that the fraction is in its simplest form.

    <pre>Both agents have calculated the square of the radius, r^2, as 549/16. They have verified that this fraction is in its simplest form by checking that the greatest common divisor of 549 and 16 is 1. Therefore, the fraction cannot be simplified further. The sum of the numerator and denominator, 549 + 16, is 565. Since both agents agree on this result and the calculations are consistent, the final decision on the radius squared is that r^2 = 549/16, and the sum of the numerator and denominator is 565.
