Question: Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.
Iteration: abstract_workflow_1_1_15
proposed answer: To determine the number of residents who own all four items, we need to consider the information provided and apply the principle of inclusion-exclusion correctly. We have 900 residents, and each owns a bag of candy hearts. The problem states that 195 own a diamond ring, 367 own golf clubs, and 562 own a garden spade. Additionally, 437 residents own exactly two of these items, and 234 own exactly three. The key is to determine how many own all three specific items (ring, clubs, spade), which would mean they own all four items since everyone has candy hearts. The 234 residents who own exactly three items are those who own a diamond ring, golf clubs, and a garden spade. Since every resident also owns candy hearts, these 234 residents indeed own all four items. Therefore, the number of residents who own all four items is 234.

proposed answer: The problem states that each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. Therefore, any resident who owns the three items (diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade) also automatically owns the fourth item, which is the candy hearts. From sub-task 6, we know that 234 residents own all three of the specified items. Since owning these three items means they also own the candy hearts, the number of residents who own all four items is the same as those who own all three. Therefore, the number of residents who own all four items is 234.
