    <pre>Related original question:

Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$..

### Sub-task 4: Express AP in the form m/n where m and n are relatively prime integers. 

 ### thinking #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent 1C5s:
The problem involves finding the length of segment AP in a triangle inscribed in a circle, using the intersecting chords theorem and the power of a point theorem. The tangents to the circle at points B and C intersect at point D, and AD intersects the circle again at P. We are given the lengths AB = 5, BC = 9, and AC = 10. Using the power of a point theorem, we have AD * DP = AB * AC. From previous calculations, we found that AD = 5 and DP = 6.05, leading to AP = AD + DP = 11.05. Converting 11.05 to a fraction, we have 11.05 = 11 + 0.05 = 11 + 1/20 = 221/20. This fraction is in its simplest form because 221 and 20 are relatively prime, having no common factors other than 1. Therefore, AP is expressed as 221/20, where 221 and 20 are relatively prime integers.

### answer #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent 1C5s:
221/20

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 5: Calculate m + n from the expression of AP. 

 then justify completely and detailedly why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. Again, your task is only to answer the question Sub-task 5: Calculate m + n from the expression of AP. and explaination.</pre>

    <pre>From the previous sub-task, we have the expression for AP as 221/20, where m = 221 and n = 20. To find m + n, we simply add these two numbers together. Since 221 and 20 are relatively prime, they are already in their simplest form, and we can directly compute m + n = 221 + 20.
