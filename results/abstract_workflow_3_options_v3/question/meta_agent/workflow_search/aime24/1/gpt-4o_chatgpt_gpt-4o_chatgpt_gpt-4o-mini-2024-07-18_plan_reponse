        "response": "In sub-task 4, the length of AP was determined to be 50/11, where m = 50 and n = 11. These values are relatively prime, meaning they have no common factors other than 1. Therefore, the sum m + n is calculated as 50 + 11 = 61. This calculation is straightforward and accurate, as it directly follows from the expression of AP in the form m/n. The problem asked for m + n, and since m and n are correctly identified as 50 and 11, their sum is 61. The calculation is complete and there are no limitations, as it directly answers the problem's requirement to find m + n.\n\nAnswer:61",

Since 221 and 20 are relatively prime, they are already in their simplest form, and we can directly compute m + n = 221 + 20.\n\nAnswer:241",
