Question: Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.

proposed answer: In sub-task 4, the length of AP was determined to be 50/11, where m = 50 and n = 11. These values are relatively prime, meaning they have no common factors other than 1. Therefore, the sum m + n is calculated as 50 + 11 = 61. This calculation is straightforward and accurate, as it directly follows from the expression of AP in the form m/n. The problem asked for m + n, and since m and n are correctly identified as 50 and 11, their sum is 61. The calculation is complete and there are no limitations, as it directly answers the problem's requirement to find m + n.

proposed answer: From the previous sub-task, we have the expression for AP as 221/20, where m = 221 and n = 20. To find m + n, we simply add these two numbers together. Since 221 and 20 are relatively prime, they are already in their simplest form, and we can directly compute m + n = 221 + 20.
