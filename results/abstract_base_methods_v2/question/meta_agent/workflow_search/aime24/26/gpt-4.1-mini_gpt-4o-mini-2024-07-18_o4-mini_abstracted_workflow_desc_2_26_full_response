The problem requires us to count all such sets B that satisfy this condition. For each element a_i in A, we can form sets B that have a_i as their maximum element.

The elements of B must be positive integers, and since we want the maximum element to be exactly n, all other elements must be chosen from the set {1, 2, ..., n-1}. For each element in this set, we have the choice to either include it in B or not. Therefore, for k elements (where k = n - 1), we have 2^k subsets, including the empty set. Since we need B to be nonempty and must include the maximum element n, we subtract the empty set from our count. Thus, the number of nonempty subsets B with maximum element exactly n is given by 2^(n-1) - 1. To verify this, we can calculate for small values of n: For n=1, we have no elements to choose from, so the count is 0. For n=2, we can only have the set {2} as B, which gives us 1.

The elements of B must be positive integers, and since we want the maximum element to be exactly n, all other elements must be chosen from the set {1, 2, ..., n-1}. For each element in this set, we have the choice to either include it in B or not. Therefore, for k elements (where k = n - 1), we have 2^k subsets, including the empty set.

The elements of B can be any subset of the integers from 1 to n-1 (since n is the maximum), and we must include n itself in each B. The number of subsets of a set with k elements is 2^k. Therefore, if we have the integers {1, 2, ..., n-1}, there are 2^(n-1) subsets of this set. Since we must include n in each subset to form B, we have 2^(n-1) ways to choose the remaining elements of B. Thus, the formula for the number of finite nonempty sets B with max(B) = n is 2^(n-1). We can verify this with small values: for n=1, there are no elements less than 1, so B can only be {1}, giving us 1 set; for n=2, we can have {2} or {1, 2}, giving us 2 sets; for n=3, we can have {3}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}, or {1, 2, 3}, giving us 4 sets.

Specifically, the elements of B can be any subset of the integers {1, 2, ..., n-1} along with the integer n itself. The number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., n-1} is 2^(n-1), which includes the empty set. Since B must be nonempty and must include n, we have to exclude the empty subset, resulting in a total of 2^(n-1) nonempty subsets. Therefore, the formula for the number of finite nonempty sets B with maximum element exactly n is 2^(n-1). To verify this formula: For n=1, the only set is {1}, so there is 1 set: 2^(1-1) = 1. For n=2, the possible sets are {2}, {1,2}, giving 2 sets: 2^(2-1) = 2. For n=3, the possible sets are {3}, {1,3}, {2,3}, {1,2,3}, giving 4 sets: 2^(3-1) = 4.

The number 2024 can be expressed as a sum of powers of 2, which corresponds to the maximum elements of sets B that can be formed. The binary representation of 2024 is 11111100100 in binary, which indicates that it can be decomposed into sums of distinct powers of 2. This suggests that the elements of A could be chosen from the set of powers of 2 that sum up to 2024 + k. Each candidate set A can be constructed by selecting distinct powers of 2 and adjusting for k, the number of elements in A. By verifying each candidate set A, we can reconstruct the total count of sets B and ensure it equals 2024.

Each term 2^(a_i - 1) represents the count of sets B with maximum element a_i. By analyzing the binary representation of numbers, we can identify candidate values for a_i.
