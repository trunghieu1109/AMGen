Question: Alice chooses a set $A$ of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets $B$ of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of $B$ belongs to $A$. Bob's list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A.

proposed answer: From Sub-task 4, we have identified the set A as {1, 2, ..., 11}. To find the sum of the elements of A, we can use the formula for the sum of the first n positive integers, which is n(n + 1) / 2. Here, n = 11, so the sum is 11 * (11 + 1) / 2 = 11 * 12 / 2 = 66. Therefore, the sum of the elements of A is 66.

proposed answer: To find the correct candidate set A that corresponds to the total of 2024 sets B, we need to compute the sum of the elements for each candidate set A identified in Sub-task 4. The candidate sets A are {10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5} and {10, 8, 6}. We will calculate the sums: For {10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5}, the sum is 10 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 = 45. For {10, 8, 6}, the sum is 10 + 8 + 6 = 24. We also need to verify which of these sets generates exactly 2024 sets B. The set {10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5} generates the required number of sets B, as it includes all integers from 5 to 10, allowing for combinations that yield 2024. Therefore, the correct candidate set A is {10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5}, and its sum is 45.
