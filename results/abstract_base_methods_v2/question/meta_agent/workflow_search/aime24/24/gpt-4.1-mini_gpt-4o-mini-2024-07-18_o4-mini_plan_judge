Question: Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations:
\[\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}\]\[\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}\]\[\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}\]
Then the value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: From Sub-task 5, we found that the absolute value of log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) is 3/4, which can be expressed as the fraction m/n where m = 3 and n = 4. Since 3 and 4 are relatively prime, we can sum them to find m + n. Therefore, m + n = 3 + 4 = 7.

proposed answer: To cross-check the computed value of |log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)|, we can sum the original equations. The original equations are: log_2(x/y z) = 1/2, log_2(y/x z) = 1/3, and log_2(z/x y) = 1/4. Summing these gives us log_2(x/y z) + log_2(y/x z) + log_2(z/x y) = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4. The left-hand side simplifies to log_2((x/y z)(y/x z)(z/x y)) = log_2(x^2 y^2 z^2) = log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2). The right-hand side can be calculated as follows: the common denominator is 12, so we have (6 + 4 + 3) / 12 = 13/12. Therefore, log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = 13/12, and its absolute value is |13/12|. This means m = 13 and n = 12, which are relatively prime. Thus, m + n = 13 + 12 = 25. This confirms that the previous result was incorrect, and the correct answer is 25.
