This clearly identifies the variables (a, b, and c) and the constants on the right-hand side of each equation.; answer - The system of equations is: 1. a - b - c = 1/2, 2. b - a - c = 1/3, 3. c - a - b = 1/4.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - To solve the system of equations, we have: 1. a - b - c = 1/2, 2. b - a - c = 1/3, 3. c - a - b = 1/4. We can express a, b, and c in terms of each other. From the first equation, we can express a as a = b + c + 1/2. Substituting this into the second equation gives us b - (b + c + 1/2) - c = 1/3, which simplifies to -1/2 - 2c = 1/3. Solving for c gives c = -11/12. Substituting c back into the first equation allows us to find a and b. After solving, we find a = 1/12, b = 1/4, and c = -11/12. We can then calculate log_2(x^4y^3z^2) = 4*log_2(x) + 3*log_2(y) + 2*log_2(z) = 4*(1/12) + 3*(1/4) + 2*(-11/12) = 1/3 + 3/4 - 11/6 = 1/3 + 9/12 - 22/12 = 4/12 = 1/3.
