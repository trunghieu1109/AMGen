Question: Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.

proposed answer: From Sub-task 8, we determined that the length of segment AP is expressed as the fraction 45/8. In this fraction, the numerator m is 45 and the denominator n is 8. Since 45 and 8 share no common factors other than 1, they are relatively prime. The problem specifically asks for the sum of m and n, which is calculated as 45 + 8. Therefore, the final result for m + n is 53.
