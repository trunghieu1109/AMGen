The conditions for divisibility by 7 when each digit is replaced by 1 are as follows: 1. Replacing the thousands digit (a) with 1 gives us 1000 + 100b + 10c + d, which must be divisible by 7. 2. Replacing the hundreds digit (b) with 1 gives us 1000a + 100 + 10c + d, which must also be divisible by 7. 3.
