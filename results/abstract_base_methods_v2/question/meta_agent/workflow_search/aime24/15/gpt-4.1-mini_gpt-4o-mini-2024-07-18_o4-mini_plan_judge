Question: Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.

proposed answer: To determine the number of residents who own all four items, we analyze the equations derived from the ownership data. We have two equations: 1) x + w = 229 and 2) x + 437 + 234 + w = 900. Simplifying the second equation gives us x + w = 229, which is identical to the first equation. This means we cannot uniquely determine x and w without additional information. However, since there are 234 residents who own exactly three items, and owning all four items would imply that these residents also own the fourth item, it suggests that the number of residents who own all four items must be 0. This is because if any residents owned all four items, it would contradict the counts of those owning exactly three items. Therefore, the conclusion is that the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four items is 0.

proposed answer: After analyzing the derived equations and the calculations performed, it is clear that the number of residents who own all four items is consistent across different evaluations. The equations x1 + x4 = 229 and x1 + 4*x4 = 448 were solved correctly, leading to the conclusion that x4, the number of residents who own all four items, equals 73. This solution adheres to the constraints of the problem, as it fits within the total number of residents and the specific counts of ownership provided. Therefore, I am confident that the final decision on the number of residents who own all four items is accurate and validated by the calculations performed.
