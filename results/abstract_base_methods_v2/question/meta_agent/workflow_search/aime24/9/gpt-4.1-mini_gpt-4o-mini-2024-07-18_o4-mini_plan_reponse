        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - To find the total number of ways to choose 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1, 2, ..., 10}, we use the combination formula C(n, k), which represents the number of ways to choose k elements from a set of n elements without regard to the order of selection. Here, n = 10 and k = 4. The formula is given by C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!). Therefore, C(10, 4) = 10! / (4! * (10 - 4)!) = 10! / (4! * 6!) = (10 * 9 * 8 * 7) / (4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = 210. Thus, the total number of ways to choose 4 distinct numbers from the set S is 210.; answer - 210\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - To win the grand prize, the 4 numbers randomly chosen must exactly match the 4 numbers that Jen has chosen. Since there is only 1 specific combination of numbers that can match Jen's chosen numbers, the number of ways the lottery numbers can be chosen such that Jen wins the grand prize is exactly 1. This is because there is only one set of 4 distinct numbers that can correspond to the specific set of numbers Jen picked. Therefore, the answer is 1.; answer - 1\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - To calculate the number of ways Jen can win a prize, we need to count the scenarios where at least 2 of her chosen numbers are included in the 4 randomly chosen numbers. We can break this down into three cases: (1) exactly 2 of her numbers are chosen, (2) exactly 3 of her numbers are chosen, and (3) all 4 of her numbers are chosen. Let's denote Jen's chosen numbers as J1, J2, J3, J4. The total number of combinations for choosing 4 numbers from 10 is 210 (as calculated in Sub-task 1). \n\n1. **Case 1: Exactly 2 of Jen's numbers are chosen.** \n   - Choose 2 from Jen's 4 numbers: C(4, 2) = 6 ways. \n   - Choose 2 from the remaining 6 numbers (10 total - 4 Jen's numbers): C(6, 2) = 15 ways. \n   - Total for this case: 6 * 15 = 90 ways. \n\n2. **Case 2: Exactly 3 of Jen's numbers are chosen.** \n   - Choose 3 from Jen's 4 numbers: C(4, 3) = 4 ways. \n   - Choose 1 from the remaining 6 numbers: C(6, 1) = 6 ways. \n   - Total for this case: 4 * 6 = 24 ways. \n\n3. **Case 3: All 4 of Jen's numbers are chosen.** \n   - There is only 1 way to choose all 4 of her numbers: C(4, 4) = 1 way. \n\nAdding these cases together gives us the total number of ways Jen can win a prize: 90 + 24 + 1 = 115. Thus, the number of ways the lottery numbers can be chosen such that Jen wins a prize is 115.; answer - 115\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - To compute the conditional probability that Jen wins the grand prize given that she wins a prize, we use the formula for conditional probability: P(A | B) = P(A and B) / P(B). Here, A is the event that Jen wins the grand prize, and B is the event that Jen wins a prize. From Sub-task 2, we found that the number of ways Jen can win the grand prize (event A) is 1. From Sub-task 3, we found that the number of ways Jen can win a prize (event B) is 115. Therefore, the conditional probability is P(A | B) = 1 / 115. This fraction is already in simplest form, so we can express it as m/n where m = 1 and n = 115. Since m and n are relatively prime, we find m+n = 1 + 115 = 116.; answer - 116\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - To find the sum of the numerator and denominator of the conditional probability fraction, we first identify the values of m and n. From the previous calculations, we have m = 1 and n = 115, which are already in their simplest form. Therefore, we compute the sum: m + n = 1 + 115 = 116. This sum represents the final answer as required.; answer - 116"
