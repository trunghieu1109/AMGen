Question: Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: To find the sum of the numerator and denominator of the conditional probability fraction, we first identify the values of m and n. From the previous calculations, we have m = 1 and n = 115, which are already in their simplest form. Therefore, we compute the sum: m + n = 1 + 115 = 116. This sum represents the final answer as required.
