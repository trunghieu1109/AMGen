Question: Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.

proposed answer: To determine the correct value of p + q, we need to analyze the results from the previous calculations. The two proposed sums are 26 and 29. The first result, 26, comes from the values p = 23 and q = 3, which are coprime. The second result, 29, suggests a different pair of coprime integers. To resolve this, we should verify the calculations leading to each result. The correct approach involves ensuring that the values of p and q are derived from the constraints of the problem accurately. After careful consideration, the correct values that satisfy the conditions of the problem yield p = 23 and q = 3, leading to the sum of 26 being the valid answer. Therefore, the final decision is that p + q = 26 is the correct answer.

proposed answer: We have determined that the value of rÂ² can be expressed as 27/4, where the numerator p is 27 and the denominator q is 4. Since 27 and 4 are relatively prime (their greatest common divisor is 1), we can confirm that this fraction is in its simplest form. Therefore, we can compute p + q = 27 + 4 = 31.
