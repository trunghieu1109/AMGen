The reciprocal of z can be expressed as 1/z = 1/(4(cos θ + i sin θ)) = (1/4)(cos(-θ) + i sin(-θ)) = (1/4)(cos θ - i sin θ) because of the properties of cosine and sine. Now substituting these into the expression, we get: (75 + 117i)(4(cos θ + i sin θ)) + (96 + 144i)(1/4)(cos θ - i sin θ). We can simplify the expression further to combine the terms and express it purely in terms of θ, which will involve expanding and combining real and imaginary parts.; answer: (75 + 117i)(4(cos θ + i sin θ)) + (96 + 144i)(1/4)(cos θ - i sin θ)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent SF17, rewrite expression in terms of θ, thinking: To rewrite the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z in terms of θ, we first substitute z = 4(cos θ + i sin θ) into the expression. We also need to find 1/z, which is the reciprocal of z. Since z = 4(cos θ + i sin θ), we can express 1/z as 1/(4(cos θ + i sin θ)). Using the formula for the reciprocal of a complex number, we get 1/z = (1/4)(cos(-θ) + i sin(-θ)) = (1/4)(cos θ - i sin θ) since cos(-θ) = cos θ and sin(-θ) = -sin θ. Now we can substitute both z and 1/z into the original expression and simplify it into terms of cos θ and sin θ.; answer: (75 + 117i)(4(cos θ + i sin θ)) + (96 + 144i)(1/(4(cos θ + i sin θ)))\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent asu1, separate real part, thinking: To find the real part of the expression obtained in Sub-task 2, we need to expand and simplify the terms. Starting with the expression (75 + 117i)(4(cos θ + i sin θ)), we distribute to get: 300 cos θ + 75(4i sin θ) + 468i sin θ - 117(4 sin θ). This simplifies to 300 cos θ - 468 sin θ. Next, we consider the second part (96 + 144i)((1/4)(cos θ - i sin θ)), which expands to (24 cos θ - 36i sin θ + 36i sin θ + 36 sin θ). The imaginary parts cancel out, leaving us with 24 cos θ + 36 sin θ. Combining these results gives us the total real part as 300 cos θ - 468 sin θ + 24 cos θ + 36 sin θ, which simplifies to 324 cos θ - 432 sin θ.
