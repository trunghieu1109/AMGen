Question: Find the largest possible real part of \[(75+117i)z+\frac{96+144i}{z}\]where $z$ is a complex number with $|z|=4$.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_1_12
proposed answer: The maximum possible real part of the expression (75+117i)z + (96+144i)/z can be analyzed using the results from Sub-task 5. We found that the maximum value of the expression A cos θ + B sin θ, where A = 324 and B = -432, is 540. This value represents the maximum possible real part of the given expression when z is constrained to have a modulus of 4. Therefore, the maximum possible real part value is 540.
