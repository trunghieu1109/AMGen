The condition for the segment PQ to have unit length is given by the distance formula: the distance between points P and Q is given by √((a - 0)² + (0 - b)²) = √(a² + b²). For the segment to be of unit length, we require that this distance equals 1, leading to the equation a² + b² = 1. This represents a circle of radius 1 in the first quadrant, where both a and b are positive. Since we can express any point on the unit circle in the first quadrant using the coordinates (cos(θ), sin(θ)) for θ in [0, π/2), we can conclude that this parametrization indeed captures all segments of unit length in the first quadrant, confirming that any valid (a, b) pair satisfying a² + b² = 1 corresponds to a unique segment PQ.

We have P = (a, 0) and Q = (0, b). The line segment connecting P and Q can be expressed parametrically as R(λ) = (λa, (1 - λ)b) for λ in [0, 1]. Here, when λ = 0, R(0) = (0, b) which corresponds to point Q, and when λ = 1, R(1) = (a, 0) which corresponds to point P. For any λ in between 0 and 1, R(λ) traces the line segment from Q to P. The coordinates (λa, (1 - λ)b) respect the geometric constraints since a and b are both positive, thus ensuring that R(λ) remains in the first quadrant.

Therefore, we calculate B - A = (0 - 1/2, \x1a\x1b - 0) = (-1/2, \x1a\x1b). Substituting this into the parametrization gives us C = (1/2, 0) + t(-1/2, \x1a\x1b) = (1/2 - t/2, t\x1a\x1b).

Since the segment \x01PQ must have a length of 1, we use the distance formula to establish the condition: the distance between P and Q is given by the formula for distance in a Cartesian plane, which is sqrt((a-0)^2 + (0-b)^2) = sqrt(a^2 + b^2). For the length to be 1, we require that a^2 + b^2 = 1. This condition describes a quarter circle in the first quadrant where a and b are both positive, ensuring that P and Q lie in the first quadrant. The parametrization is valid as it covers all unit-length segments with endpoints on the axes while maintaining the constraints of the first quadrant. The values of a and b can be expressed in terms of a parameter θ, where a = cos(θ) and b = sin(θ) for θ in [0, π/2].

The condition for the length of the segment \x16PQ to be 1 is given by the distance formula: the length is \x16PQ = sqrt((a - 0)^2 + (0 - b)^2) = sqrt(a^2 + b^2). For the segment to have unit length, we require that sqrt(a^2 + b^2) = 1, which leads to the condition a^2 + b^2 = 1. This is the equation of a circle of radius 1 centered at the origin in the first quadrant.

The segment PQ can be parametrized by a parameter λ that varies from 0 to 1. When λ = 0, we are at point P, and when λ = 1, we are at point Q. The linear interpolation between P and Q gives us the point R(λ) = (λa, (1-λ)b). This form respects the geometric constraints as it varies continuously between the endpoints P and Q, covering all points on the segment. Since λ is constrained between 0 and 1, the coordinates (λa, (1-λ)b) will always yield points within the first quadrant, confirming the validity of the parametrization. Therefore, R(λ) = (λa, (1-λ)b) for λ in [0, 1] correctly represents all points on the segment PQ.; answer: R(λ) = (λa, (1-λ)b) for λ in [0, 1]\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent Qunx, deriving parametric form of points on segments, thinking: To derive the explicit parametric form of points on each segment PQ in the family F, we start with the points P = (a, 0) and Q = (0, b) where a and b satisfy the unit length condition a² + b² = 1. A point R on the segment PQ can be expressed as a linear combination of P and Q. Specifically, we can express R as R(λ) = (λ a, (1-λ) b) for λ in [0, 1].

This parametrization respects the geometric constraints as it maintains the coordinates of R within the bounds defined by P and Q. Since both a and b are positive and λ varies from 0 to 1, R(λ) will always yield points in the first quadrant.

Therefore, we calculate B - A = (0 - 1/2, \x1a\x1b - 0) = (-1/2, \x1a\x1b). Substituting this into the parametrization gives us C = (1/2, 0) + t(-1/2, \x1a\x1b) = (1/2 - t/2, t\x1a\x1b).
