Question: Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). Then \(OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\).

proposed answer: From the previous sub-tasks, we determined that OC^2 = 1/4, which can be expressed as p/q where p = 1 and q = 4. Since 1 and 4 are relatively prime positive integers, we can compute the sum p + q. Therefore, p + q = 1 + 4 = 5. This confirms that the final answer for the sum p + q is indeed 5.

proposed answer: In Sub-task 6, we determined that the squared distance OC² for the point C located at (1/3, √3/6) is OC² = 7/36. Here, p = 7 and q = 36 are relatively prime positive integers. The task requires us to find the sum p + q, which is 7 + 36 = 43. Therefore, the final answer is 43.
