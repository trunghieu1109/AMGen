Question: Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.

proposed answer: In sub-task 4, we determined that the total time taken for Aya's walk, including the time spent in the coffee shop, when walking at a speed of (s + 0.5) km/h is 214 minutes. This value is already in minutes, which is the required unit for the answer. Therefore, the final decision on the total time in minutes is simply the value we calculated, which is 214 minutes.

Answer:214 minutes

proposed answer: In sub-task 4, we calculated the total time Aya takes for her walk at a speed of s + 0.5 km/h, which is 3.5 km/h. The walking time was computed as 9 km / 3.5 km/h, resulting in approximately 2.57142857 hours. Adding the time spent in the coffee shop, which was determined to be 3 hours (or 180 minutes), gave us a total of 5.57142857 hours. To convert this total time into minutes, we multiply by 60, resulting in approximately 334.2857142 minutes. Rounding this to the nearest integer gives us 334 minutes. Therefore, the total time in minutes, including the time spent in the coffee shop, is 334 minutes.
