Question: Eight circles of radius $34$ are sequentially tangent, and two of the circles are tangent to $AB$ and $BC$ of triangle $ABC$, respectively. $2024$ circles of radius $1$ can be arranged in the same manner. The inradius of triangle $ABC$ can be expressed as $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: In Sub-task 5, we found that the inradius of triangle ABC is expressed as the fraction 17/4, where 17 and 4 are coprime integers. To compute the sum m + n, we simply add these two integers together: m = 17 and n = 4. Therefore, m + n = 17 + 4 = 21. This calculation is straightforward and confirms that the values are correct and the sum is accurately computed.

proposed answer: In Sub-task 6, we derived the inradius r of triangle ABC as a simplified fraction 17/4. The integers 17 and 4 are relatively prime, meaning they have no common factors other than 1. To find m+n, we simply add these two integers together: 17 + 4 = 21. This confirms that the calculation is correct and the final answer is indeed an integer as required.
