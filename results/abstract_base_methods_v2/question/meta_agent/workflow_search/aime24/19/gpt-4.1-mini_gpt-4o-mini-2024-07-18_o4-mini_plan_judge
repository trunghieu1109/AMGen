Question: Let $\omega\neq 1$ be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\]
is divided by 1000.

proposed answer: From Sub-task 5, we concluded that the product evaluates to 0. When we take the remainder of 0 when divided by any integer, including 1000, the result is still 0. Therefore, the remainder when the integer obtained from Sub-task 5 is divided by 1000 is 0.

is divided by 1000.

proposed answer: Upon reviewing all algebraic transformations, substitutions, and calculations from stages 1 to 4, I find that the expression 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} was consistently represented as ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2, and it was confirmed that it cannot be factored as a perfect square. The product ∏_{k=0}^{12} P(ω^k) was evaluated correctly, leading to the conclusion that it equals 13. The final step of finding the remainder when 13 is divided by 1000 was also correctly executed, yielding a remainder of 13. All steps were logically sound and consistent with the properties of roots of unity and polynomial evaluations. Therefore, I am confident that the final answer is accurate and free of errors.
