Question: A list of positive integers has the following properties:
$\bullet$ The sum of the items in the list is $30$.
$\bullet$ The unique mode of the list is $9$.
$\bullet$ The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.
Find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

proposed answer: To find the sum of the squares of the items in the list (9, 9, 3, 4, 5), we first calculate the square of each item: 9^2 = 81, 9^2 = 81, 3^2 = 9, 4^2 = 16, and 5^2 = 25. Then, we sum these squares: 81 + 81 + 9 + 16 + 25 = 212. Therefore, the sum of the squares of all items in the list is 212.

proposed answer: The selected candidate list {9, 9, 9, 3} does not satisfy the median condition because the median is calculated as 9, which is present in the list. Therefore, I need to find a different candidate list that meets all the conditions: the sum must be 30, the unique mode must be 9, and the median must be a positive integer not in the list. After exploring other combinations, I found the list {9, 9, 9, 1, 2} which sums to 30, has a unique mode of 9, and has a median of 9, which is not valid. However, if I consider the list {9, 9, 9, 1, 2, 0} which sums to 30, has a unique mode of 9, and the median is 2, which is not in the list. The sum of the squares of this list is 9^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 + 1^2 + 2^2 = 81 + 81 + 81 + 1 + 4 = 248. Therefore, the sum of the squares of all items in the validated list is 248.
