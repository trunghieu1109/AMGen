proposed answer: To find the product xy using the values obtained from Sub-task 5, we have x = e^2 and y = e^5. Therefore, the product xy = (e^2)(e^5) = e^(2+5) = e^7. The approximate value of e is about 2.718, so e^7 is approximately 2.718^7, which is approximately 1096.63. Rounding this to the nearest integer gives us 1097. Since the question asks for a numeric result, the final answer should be the integer 1097.

proposed answer: We have verified that the derived value of xy = 25 satisfies both original logarithmic equations and the constraints x > 1 and y > 1. By expressing y in terms of x as y = 25 / x, we ensured that both x and y remain greater than 1. The calculations confirmed that both logarithmic equations hold true for appropriate values of x and y derived from xy = 25. Therefore, the conclusion is consistent and correct.
