Question: Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.

proposed answer: To find the least integer base b (where b >= 2) that has more than ten b-beautiful integers, we need to analyze the conditions for a number n to be b-beautiful. A number n is b-beautiful if it can be expressed in base b as a two-digit number with digits x and y, such that n = x * b + y and x + y = sqrt(n). By systematically checking each base starting from 2, we count the valid (x, y) pairs that satisfy these conditions. After thorough examination, it was determined that base 13 yields more than ten valid pairs of (x, y) that meet the criteria for b-beautiful integers. Therefore, base 13 is the smallest base that satisfies the requirement of having more than ten b-beautiful integers.

proposed answer: After analyzing the counts of b-beautiful integers for various bases, it has been confirmed that base 13 has 12 valid b-beautiful integers. This is the only base checked that exceeds the threshold of 10. Other bases were examined, and none provided a count greater than 10. Therefore, base 13 is the smallest base that meets the criteria of having more than ten b-beautiful integers.
