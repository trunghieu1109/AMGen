Question: There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\times5$ grid such that: 

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_10_29
proposed answer: In the previous sub-tasks, we established that each row and column can either be filled with a single color of chips or left empty. The configurations counted in Sub-task 5 were 243 valid configurations that adhered to the rules. Since each configuration represents a unique way to fill the grid while respecting the constraints, and we confirmed that the total number of chips placed does not exceed the available chips, the final number of valid maximal chip placements is simply the number of configurations counted. Therefore, the final answer is 243.

proposed answer: To compute the final number of valid maximal chip placements on the 5x5 grid, we integrate the validated enumeration results from the previous sub-tasks. The configurations for smaller grids (2x2 and 3x3) have been counted and validated, showing that the approach used for counting configurations is consistent. For the 5x5 grid, the derived count of 276 configurations has been established based on the constraints that each row and column must contain chips of the same color and that no additional chips can be placed without violating these conditions. This count has been cross-verified with smaller grids, confirming the methodology. Therefore, the final answer for the number of valid maximal chip placements on the 5x5 grid is 276.
