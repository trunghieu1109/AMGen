Question: Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?

proposed answer: From Sub-task 6, we determined that the probability of the octagon being colored such that all blue vertices can be positioned on red vertices after rotation is given by the fraction 17/128. Here, m is 17 and n is 128. Since these two numbers are relatively prime, this fraction is in its simplest form. To find the final answer, we need to compute m + n, which is 17 + 128 = 145.

proposed answer: From Sub-task 6, we established that the probability that the octagon can be rotated so that all blue vertices map to originally red vertices is given by the fraction 39/256. The integers 39 and 256 are relatively prime, meaning they share no common factors other than 1. Therefore, we can define m = 39 and n = 256. To find m + n, we simply add these two values together: 39 + 256 = 295. This confirms that the answer is correct based on the previous calculations.
