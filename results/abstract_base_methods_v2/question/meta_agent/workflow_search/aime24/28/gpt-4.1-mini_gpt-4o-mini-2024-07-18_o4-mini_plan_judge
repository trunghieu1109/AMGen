Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: In Sub-task 5, we determined that the difference between the radii of the tangent circles on the torus is 6, which can be expressed as the fraction 6/1. Here, m = 6 and n = 1 are relatively prime positive integers. To find the final answer, we need to compute m + n, which is 6 + 1 = 7. Therefore, the final answer is 7.

proposed answer: The difference r_i - r_o has been calculated to be 1/2, which can be expressed as the fraction m/n where m = 1 and n = 2. Since 1 and 2 are relatively prime positive integers, we can sum them to find m + n, which equals 3. This confirms that the calculations are correct and the values are in their simplest form.
