Question: Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.

proposed answer: To find the total number of positive integers n â‰¤ 2024 for which Bob has a guaranteed winning strategy, we need to count the positions from the enumerated list provided in sub-task 5. The list includes all the losing positions for Alice, which are positions where if Alice starts with that number of tokens, she cannot win if Bob plays optimally. Since we are interested in the positions where Bob can guarantee a win, we need to find the complement of these losing positions up to 2024. The total numbers from 1 to 2024 are 2024, and we can count the losing positions from the provided list. The length of the list of losing positions gives us the count of positions where Alice cannot win. By subtracting the count of losing positions from 2024, we can determine the number of positions where Bob has a winning strategy. After counting the losing positions from the list, we find that there are 487 losing positions. Therefore, the number of winning positions for Bob is 2024 - 487 = 1537.

proposed answer: Based on the established modular pattern, we have determined that Bob has a guaranteed winning strategy for positions where n is classified as losing for Alice. These positions occur when n is congruent to 0 or 2 modulo 5. To find the count of such positions less than or equal to 2024, we can calculate the number of integers n that satisfy these conditions. The integers that are 0 mod 5 up to 2024 are 5, 10, 15, ..., 2020, which gives us 404 such integers. The integers that are 2 mod 5 up to 2024 are 2, 7, 12, ..., 2022, which gives us 405 such integers. Adding these counts together, we find that there are 404 + 405 = 809 integers n for which Bob has a guaranteed winning strategy. Therefore, the final count is 809.
