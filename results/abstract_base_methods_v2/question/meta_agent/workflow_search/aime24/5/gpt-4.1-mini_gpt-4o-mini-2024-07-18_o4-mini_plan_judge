Question: Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.

proposed answer: From Sub-task 6, we found that the common distance from point I to each face of the tetrahedron can be expressed as (3 * sqrt(1)) / 2. Here, we identify m = 3, n = 1, and p = 2. Since 3 and 2 are coprime and 1 is square-free, this representation is valid. To find the final answer, we compute m + n + p = 3 + 1 + 2 = 6.

proposed answer: From the previous sub-task, we have identified the values of m, n, and p from the inradius expression r = (8âˆš5)/15. Here, m = 8, n = 5, and p = 15. Since m and p are coprime (gcd(8, 15) = 1) and n is square-free (5 is not divisible by the square of any prime), the expression is in the required form. To find the final answer, we compute the sum m + n + p, which is 8 + 5 + 15 = 28. Therefore, the final numeric answer to the problem is 28.
