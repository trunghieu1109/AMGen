Question: Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.

proposed answer: To determine the greatest real number that is less than BD^2 for all rhombi formed by points on the hyperbola, we analyze the expression BD^2 = 96 * sinh^2(t). The function sinh^2(t) increases without bound as t increases, which means BD^2 can also become arbitrarily large. However, we need to find the maximum value of BD^2 that can be achieved while still satisfying the conditions of the rhombus and the hyperbola. The hyperbola's parameters impose constraints on the possible values of BD^2. By evaluating the limiting behavior of the hyperbola and the properties of the rhombus, we find that the maximum value of BD^2 approaches 96 as t approaches a certain limit. Therefore, the greatest real number that is less than all possible values of BD^2 is 96, as it represents the upper bound of the expression without reaching it. Thus, the answer is 95, which is the greatest integer less than 96.

proposed answer: To find the greatest real number less than all possible values of BD^2 for the rhombus ABCD inscribed in the hyperbola, we analyze the expression BD^2 = 4(20 + 24t^2) / (1 - t^2) where t = tanh(v). The parameter t is constrained by the relationship tanh(u) * tanh(v) = 5/6, which limits t to the interval (0, 1). As t approaches 1, BD^2 tends to infinity due to the denominator approaching zero. Therefore, we need to evaluate BD^2 at the lower boundary of the interval. When t = 0, we find that BD^2 = 4(20 + 0) / (1 - 0) = 80. Since the function is continuous and increases towards infinity as t approaches 1, the greatest real number that is less than all possible values of BD^2 is indeed 80, as it is the minimum value achieved at t = 0.
