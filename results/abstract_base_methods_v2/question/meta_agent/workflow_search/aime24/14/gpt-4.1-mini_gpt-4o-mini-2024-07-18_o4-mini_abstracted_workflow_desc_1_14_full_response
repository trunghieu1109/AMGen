Therefore, AC^2 = (2 sqrt(20) cosh(u))^2 + (2 sqrt(24) sinh(u))^2 = 4(20 cosh^2(u) + 24 sinh^2(u)). For the diagonal BD, we have BD = |B - D| = |(sqrt(20) cosh(v), -sqrt(24) sinh(v)) - (-sqrt(20) cosh(v), sqrt(24) sinh(v))| = |(2 sqrt(20) cosh(v), -2 sqrt(24) sinh(v))|.

The side lengths can be expressed in terms of the parameters u and v. The condition AB = BC = CD = DA leads to the equality of the distances from A to B and B to C. This can be expressed as: sqrt((x_B - x_A)^2 + (y_B - y_A)^2) = sqrt((x_C - x_B)^2 + (y_C - y_B)^2), leading to the relation tanh u * tanh v = a^2 / b^2 = 5/6.

The condition tanh(u) * tanh(v) = 5/6 implies that t must be bounded. Since tanh(v) approaches 1 as v approaches infinity, we can say that t is in the interval (0, 1). As t approaches 1, the denominator (1 - t^2) approaches 0, which causes BD^2 to approach infinity. Thus, we need to find the minimum value of BD^2 on the interval (0, 1). The function is continuous and differentiable in this interval, and we can find the critical points by differentiating BD^2 with respect to t and setting the derivative to zero.

However, due to the constraint tanh(u) * tanh(v) = 5/6, this further restricts the possible values of t. As t approaches 1, the denominator (1 - t^2) approaches 0, causing BD^2 to approach infinity. Therefore, we need to consider the behavior of BD^2 as t approaches the upper limit of its domain. The function is continuous and increases as t increases towards 1. To find the greatest real number less than all possible values of BD^2, we analyze the limits: as t approaches 1 from the left, BD^2 approaches infinity, meaning there is no upper bound.
