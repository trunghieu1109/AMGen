Question: Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.

proposed answer: To find the total number of paths with exactly four direction changes on an 8x8 grid, we need to partition the 8 right (R) and 8 up (U) steps into 5 segments, ensuring that each segment has at least one step. This is done using the stars and bars method. For the right steps, we solve the equation r1 + r2 + r3 + r4 + r5 = 8 with r_i >= 1. By letting r_i' = r_i - 1, we transform it to r1' + r2' + r3' + r4' + r5' = 3, which has C(3 + 5 - 1, 5 - 1) = C(7, 4) = 35 solutions. The same applies for the up steps, yielding another 35 compositions. The segments can be arranged in any order, and we use the multinomial coefficient to account for the arrangements of 5 segments (2 horizontal and 3 vertical or vice versa), which gives us C(5, 2, 3) = 10. Therefore, the total number of valid paths is 35 * 35 * 10 = 12250. This confirms the calculations from the previous sub-tasks, leading to a final answer of 12250 paths with exactly four direction changes.

proposed answer: The final count of 294 paths with exactly four direction changes has been validated through combinatorial reasoning and empirical testing of smaller cases. The paths can be represented as sequences of right (R) and up (U) moves, and the symmetry in the arrangement of moves confirms the consistency of the count. Additionally, testing smaller grids has shown that the reasoning holds true, reinforcing the correctness of the total count of 294 paths. Therefore, I am confident that the number of paths of length 16 from (0,0) to (8,8) on the grid that change direction exactly four times is indeed 294.
