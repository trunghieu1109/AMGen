The intersection of two line segments can be found using the parametric equations of the lines and solving for the parameters. We will check each pair of segments, calculate their intersection points, and filter out those that lie strictly inside the dodecagon. Given the symmetry and regularity of the dodecagon, we can expect a certain number of intersection points, but we must ensure that we only include those that are not at the vertices of the dodecagon. This requires careful calculation and verification of the coordinates of the intersection points. The previous calculation included duplicates and points that do not strictly lie inside the dodecagon, such as (0, 0) and others that are on the edges. Therefore, we need to ensure that the intersection points we list are unique and strictly inside the dodecagon.; answer - The exact coordinates of the intersection points formed by the sides and diagonals of the dodecagon, strictly inside the polygon, are: [(0.5, 0), (0, 0.5), (-0.5, 0), (0, -0.5), (0.5, -0.5), (-0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 0.5), (-0.5, -0.5)]\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - To construct an adjacency map of all segment pieces between intersection points along the sides and diagonals of the dodecagon, we need to consider all the intersection points identified in the previous sub-task, as well as the vertices of the dodecagon.
