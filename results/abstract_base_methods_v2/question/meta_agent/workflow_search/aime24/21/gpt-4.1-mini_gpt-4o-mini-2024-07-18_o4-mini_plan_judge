Question: Find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon ($12$-gon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The diagram below shows three of those rectangles.

proposed answer: To count all distinct rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon, we need to consider the vertices of the dodecagon and how they can be connected to form rectangles. A rectangle requires two pairs of opposite sides that are equal and parallel. In a regular dodecagon, the vertices can be connected in various ways to form rectangles. Since the dodecagon has symmetry, we must account for potential duplicates when counting rectangles. After analyzing the configurations and ensuring that each rectangle adheres to the geometric properties defined, the total number of distinct rectangles that can be formed is determined to be 30. This count includes all unique orientations and positions of rectangles that can be formed within the constraints of the dodecagon's sides and diagonals.

proposed answer: To find the total number of distinct rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon, we first need to ensure that we have deduplicated the rectangles based on their vertex sets. After processing the candidate rectangles and grouping them by their sorted vertex sets, we can count the unique configurations that represent distinct rectangles. The distinct rectangles identified are: {((0.5, 0), (0, 0.5), (-0.5, 0), (0, -0.5)), ((0.5, -0.5), (0.5, 0), (-0.5, 0.5), (-0.5, 0)), ((0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 0), (-0.5, -0.5), (-0.5, 0))}. There are 3 distinct rectangles after deduplication. Therefore, the final count of distinct rectangles is 3.
