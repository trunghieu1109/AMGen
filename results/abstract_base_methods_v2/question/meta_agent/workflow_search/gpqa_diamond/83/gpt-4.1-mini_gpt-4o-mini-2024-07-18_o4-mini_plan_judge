proposed answer: The key factor for converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel algorithm is the effective decomposition of the problem into independent subproblems. Among the provided choices, the 'Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation' is the most relevant because it facilitates the simplification of computations, allowing the problem to be broken down into parts that can be solved independently. This decomposition is essential for parallel execution, as it enables multiple processors to work on different parts of the problem simultaneously. Other choices, such as stability analysis and existence of nonlocal boundary conditions, do not directly contribute to this decomposition process. Therefore, the choice that best aligns with the key factor for enabling parallelization is the 'Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation'.

proposed answer: The key factor that enables the conversion from a sequential algorithm to a parallel algorithm in the context of solving higher dimensional heat equations is the 'Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation'. This is because the linear partial fraction decomposition allows the original problem to be expressed as a sum of simpler, independent linear systems. Each of these systems can be solved independently and concurrently, which is essential for effective parallel computation. The other options, such as the existence of nonlocal boundary conditions and stability analysis, while important for the overall problem, do not directly facilitate the decomposition necessary for parallel execution. Similarly, complex roots of fractional approximation may relate to stability but do not inherently provide the structure needed for parallelization. Therefore, the linear partial fraction decomposition is the most relevant factor that enables the transformation of a sequential algorithm into a parallel one.
