The presence of this charge induces a negative charge on the inner surface of the conductor, while the outer surface acquires a positive charge of +q to maintain overall neutrality. According to electrostatics, the electric field outside the conductor behaves as if all the charge were concentrated at a point at the center of the conductor. Therefore, the electric field at a distance L from the center of the spherical conductor can be calculated using Coulomb\'s law. The formula for the electric field E due to a point charge is given by E = (1 / (4πε₀)) * (q / L²). Since L is greater than R, this formula applies directly. Thus, the correct expression for the electric field at point P is E = (1 / (4πε₀)) * (q / L²). This confirms that the electric field outside the conductor is determined solely by the charge on the outer surface and is independent of the induced charges inside the conductor.

Therefore, the correct answer is D.; answer - D", agents="CoT agent CreF, analyzing physical setup, thinking: In the given problem, we have an uncharged spherical conductor with a radius R and a small spherical cavity of radius r located inside it. The center of the cavity is at a distance s from the center of the spherical conductor.

The angle theta is the angle between the line from the center of the cavity to point P and the line from the center of the conductor to the center of the cavity.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent RVvd, determining electrostatic conditions, thinking: In an uncharged spherical conductor with a cavity containing a charge +q, the electrostatic conditions are such that the conductor will respond to the presence of the charge by redistributing its own charges. The positive charge +q inside the cavity will induce a negative charge on the inner surface of the cavity, equal to -q. Consequently, the outer surface of the conductor will have a charge of +q, ensuring overall charge neutrality of the conductor. This means that outside the conductor, the electric field behaves as if there is a point charge +q located at the center of the conductor. Therefore, the electric field at a point outside the conductor can be calculated using Coulomb's law, and it will depend on the distance from the center of the conductor (L) or equivalently from the center of the cavity (l) adjusted by the geometry (angle theta) between these two points. The key point is that the electric field outside the conductor is determined solely by the total charge on the outer surface, which is +q, and it follows the inverse square law with respect to the distance from the center of the conductor.; answer: The electric field outside the spherical conductor at point P is given by $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent 9uhQ, determining electrostatic conditions, thinking: Inside the uncharged spherical conductor, placing a positive charge +q in the cavity will induce a negative charge on the inner surface of the conductor. This induced negative charge will be equal in magnitude to +q, so the inner surface will have a charge of -q. Since the conductor overall remains uncharged, the outer surface of the conductor will acquire a positive charge of +q. This means that the electric field inside the conductor itself (in the material of the conductor) is zero, as is the case for any electrostatic condition in a conductor. Outside the conductor, the electric field behaves as if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the conductor. Therefore, at point P, which is outside the conductor, the electric field can be calculated based on the total charge on the outer surface, which is +q. The electric field at point P, a distance L from the center of the conductor, can be expressed as E = (1/(4πε₀))(q/L²).

The electric field outside the conductor behaves as if all the charge were concentrated at a point at the center of the conductor.

Since L > R, this formula applies directly, confirming that the electric field at point P is E = (1 / (4πε₀)) * (q / L²).
