When a high-energy gamma-ray photon collides with a CMB photon, they can annihilate each other, resulting in the production of an electron-positron pair. This is represented by the reaction gamma gamma -> e+ e-. This process is significant because it limits the lifetime of high-energy gamma-ray photons in the universe, as they can lose energy and convert into matter (electron-positron pairs) when they interact with the CMB photons. The threshold energy for this process is determined by the energy of the CMB photons, which is approximately 10^-3 eV, and the energy of the gamma-ray photons must be sufficiently high to allow for this annihilation to occur.; answer - The annihilation of a high-energy gamma-ray photon with a CMB photon producing an electron-positron pair, including the reaction gamma gamma -> e+ e-.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - In photon-photon collisions, the energy threshold condition for pair production, such as the creation of an electron-positron pair, requires that the center-of-mass energy of the system must be at least twice the rest mass energy of the electron. The rest mass energy of an electron is approximately 0.511 MeV, so the total energy required for the pair production is at least 2 * 0.511 MeV = 1.022 MeV. This means that the high-energy gamma-ray photons must have sufficient energy to ensure that when they collide with CMB photons, the resulting center-of-mass energy is at least this threshold.

This means that the energy of the incoming gamma-ray photons must be sufficiently high to meet this threshold when interacting with the CMB photons, which have an average energy of about 10^-3 eV.
