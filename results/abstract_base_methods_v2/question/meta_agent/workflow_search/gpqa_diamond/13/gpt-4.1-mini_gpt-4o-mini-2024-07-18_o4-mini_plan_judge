Question: Example(question='ChIP-seq on a PFA-fixed sample with an antibody to the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells followed by next-generation sequencing and standard quality control, alignment and peak-calling steps produced ChIP peaks that disappeared when PFA+DSG fixation was used. Where are we most likely to find such disappearing peaks?', choice1='At active promoters and enhancers', choice2='At repeats', choice3='In the introns of large genes', choice4='At random locations in the genome', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_13
proposed answer: The analysis indicates that the disappearance of ChIP peaks when switching from PFA fixation to PFA+DSG fixation is most likely due to the nature of the binding interactions at active promoters and enhancers. These regions are known for their dynamic and transient interactions with transcription factors like IKAROS. The addition of DSG enhances crosslinking, which can obscure the detection of these weaker interactions, leading to the loss of ChIP-seq peaks. Other genomic regions, such as repeats or random locations, do not typically exhibit the same level of dynamic binding and are less likely to show such sensitivity to fixation changes. Therefore, the best matching answer from the provided options is 'At active promoters and enhancers'.
