        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The given potential V(r) = (1/2) m omega^2 r^2 is characteristic of a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator. In this potential, the particle experiences a restoring force that is proportional to its displacement from the origin, which is in accordance with Hooke's law. The parameters involved are the mass m of the particle, the angular frequency omega which dictates the oscillation frequency, and the radial coordinate r which measures the distance of the particle from the origin in spherical coordinates. Therefore, the system is indeed a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator.; answer - The quantum mechanical system is a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator with potential V(r) = (1/2) m omega^2 r^2.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - The energy eigenvalues of a 3D isotropic quantum harmonic oscillator are given by the formula E_n = (n + 3/2) \\hbar \\omega, where n is the principal quantum number, which can take non-negative integer values corresponding to the total number of quanta in the system. For the third excited state, the principal quantum number n is 3 (since the ground state corresponds to n=0, the first excited state to n=1, and so forth). Plugging n=3 into the formula gives E_3 = (3 + 3/2) \\hbar \\omega = (9/2) \\hbar \\omega. Therefore, the energy of the third excited state is (9/2) \\hbar \\omega.; answer - (9/2) \\hbar \\omega\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - The third excited state corresponds to the principal quantum number n = 3 for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. The energy eigenvalues for such a system are given by the formula E_n = (n + 3/2) \\hbar \\omega. Substituting n = 3 into this formula yields E_3 = (3 + 3/2) \\hbar \\omega = (9/2) \\hbar \\omega. Additionally, for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to the same energy eigenvalue is determined by the degeneracy of the energy level, which is 3 for the third excited state. Therefore, the answer is (9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 3.; answer - (9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 3\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - The degeneracy of the energy levels for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator can be derived from the quantum numbers associated with the system. The total number of quanta in the system, n, is related to the principal quantum number, and for a given energy level, the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponds to the number of ways to distribute n quanta among three dimensions (x, y, z). The formula for the degeneracy g(n) is given by g(n) = (n + 1)(n + 2)/2. For the third excited state, n = 3, thus the degeneracy is g(3) = (3 + 1)(3 + 2)/2 = 4 * 5 / 2 = 10. Therefore, there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions for the energy eigenvalue of the third excited state.; answer - The energy of the third excited state is (9/2) \\hbar \\omega, and there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions for the same energy eigenvalue.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - The third excited state corresponds to the principal quantum number n = 3 for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. The degeneracy of the energy levels for such a system is given by the formula g(n) = (n + 1)(n + 2)/2. For n = 3, we calculate the degeneracy as g(3) = (3 + 1)(3 + 2)/2 = 4 * 5 / 2 = 10. Therefore, there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to the energy eigenvalue of the third excited state.; answer - (9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 10\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 6 output: thinking - The energy of the third excited state for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is calculated to be (9/2) \\hbar \\omega.
