Question: Example(question='Consider a quantum mechanical system containing a particle of mass $m$ moving in an istropic three dimensional potential of the form $V(r) = 1/2 m \\omega^2 r^2$ corresponding to the acted force obeying Hookeâ€™s law. Here, $\\omega$ is the angular frequency of oscillation and $r$ is the radial distance of the particle from the origin in spherical polar coordinate. What is the value of energy of the third excited state, and how many linearly independent eigenfunctions are possible for the same energy eigenvalue?', choice1='(9/2) \\hbar \\omega , 10', choice2='(9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 3', choice3='11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 10', choice4='11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 3', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: The energy of the third excited state for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is calculated to be (9/2) \hbar \omega. The degeneracy for this energy level is determined to be 10, which is calculated using the formula for degeneracy in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. Among the provided choices, only choice 1 states '(9/2) \hbar \omega, 10', which matches both the calculated energy and the degeneracy. Therefore, this is the correct answer.
