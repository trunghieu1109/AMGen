Question: Example(question='We dilute 20.00 cm3 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm3 water, then titrate the resulting solution with 0.1M NaOH (25 °C). What will be the value of pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point? The Ka of acetic acid is 1.85x10^-5.', choice1='4.57; 6.92  ', choice2='4.26; 8.52', choice3='4.73; 7.00', choice4='3.17; 6.73  ', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_46_82
proposed answer: After analyzing the calculated pH values at 25% titration and at the equivalence point, we find that the pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26 and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately 8.52. Among the provided multiple-choice options, only choice 2 lists these values as '4.26; 8.52'. Therefore, choice 2 is the correct answer as it matches both calculated pH values accurately.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_46_82
proposed answer: The verified pH at 25% titration is 4.26, which matches exactly with choice 2. The equivalence point pH is generally around 8.02, and while choice 2 lists 8.52, it is the closest option available. Therefore, choice 2 is the best match for the given pH values, making the correct letter choice B.
