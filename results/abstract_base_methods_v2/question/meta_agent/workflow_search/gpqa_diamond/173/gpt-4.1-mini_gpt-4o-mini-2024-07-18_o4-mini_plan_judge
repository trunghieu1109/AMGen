Question: Example(question='An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. A spontaneous fission occurs in which it splits into two fragments (and nothing else), such that one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other (in terms of their rest-masses). The sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. \n\nKinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?\n\n(Ignore the electrons.)', choice1='10 MeV.', choice2='5 MeV.', choice3='2 MeV.', choice4='20 MeV.', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_47_173
proposed answer: The computed difference between the relativistic kinetic energy T1 and the classical kinetic energy T1 is 5 MeV. Looking at the provided multiple-choice options, we see that one of the choices is exactly 5 MeV. Therefore, the correct answer choice that matches the computed difference is B) 5 MeV.

Answer:B
Extracted answer: B
Correct answer: 2
