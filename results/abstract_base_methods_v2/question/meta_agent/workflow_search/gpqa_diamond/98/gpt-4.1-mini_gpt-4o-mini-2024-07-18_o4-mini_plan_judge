Question: Example(question='You have prepared an unknown compound. To identify the product, you have used the following characterisation techniques: FTIR and 1H NMR. The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers. A strong absorption peak is also observed at 1700 wavenumbers. Several peaks were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum, none of which are correspond to vinyl-hydrogens. One of the signals in the 1H NMR is a doublet of triplets of quartets whilst a different signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Identify the compound as either, CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH, CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH, CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH, or CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH', choice1='CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH', choice2='CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH', choice3='CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH', choice4='CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: The spectral data indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group, supported by the broad FTIR peak at 3000 wavenumbers (indicative of O-H stretching) and the strong peak at 1700 wavenumbers (indicative of C=O stretching). The absence of vinyl hydrogens in the 1H NMR spectrum suggests that there are no double bonds in the compound. The complex splitting patterns observed in the NMR, such as a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets, imply a branched structure with multiple hydrogen environments. Among the provided options, CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH (choice D) is the only one that fits these criteria, as it contains a carboxylic acid group and has the necessary branching to account for the complex splitting patterns in the NMR spectrum. The other options either do not have the correct branching or do not correspond to a carboxylic acid based on the spectral data. Therefore, choice D is the best match for the spectral data provided.

proposed answer: To determine the best matching compound based on the spectral evidence from FTIR and NMR, we analyze each candidate's compatibility with the observed data. The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid group, evidenced by the broad O–H stretch around 3000 cm⁻¹ and a strong C=O stretch at 1700 cm⁻¹. All candidates contain this functional group, so they are consistent with this aspect. The NMR data shows no vinyl hydrogens, which eliminates any candidates that would suggest the presence of such hydrogens. The complex splitting patterns observed in the NMR, specifically a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets, must be accounted for by the hydrogen environments in each candidate. Candidate A (CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH) does not fit the NMR splitting patterns due to an insufficient number of neighboring hydrogens to produce the observed multiplicities. Candidate B (CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH) fits the NMR splitting patterns well, as it has the right arrangement of methyl and methylene groups to create the observed complex splitting. Candidate C (CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH) fails to match the NMR data due to the presence of ethyl groups, which would introduce vinyl hydrogens that are absent in the spectrum. Candidate D (CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH) also fails due to the presence of multiple ethyl groups, which would lead to vinyl hydrogen signals. Therefore, based on the spectral evidence, Candidate B is the most plausible match for the unknown compound.
