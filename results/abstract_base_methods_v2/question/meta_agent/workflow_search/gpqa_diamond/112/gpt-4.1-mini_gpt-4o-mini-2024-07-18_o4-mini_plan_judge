Question: Example(question='You have prepared an unknown compound. To identify the product, you have used the following characterisation techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers. Two other strong absorption peaks are observed at 1700 and 1650 wavenumbers. Several peaks were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum including peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens. The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45. Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O2.', choice1='C6H10O2', choice2='C6H12O', choice3='C6H10O', choice4='C6H12O2', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: After evaluating the refined molecular formula C6H10O2 against the provided multiple-choice options, it is clear that C6H10O2 is the only option that aligns with the spectroscopic data obtained from FTIR, 1H NMR, and mass spectrometry. The broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers in the FTIR suggests the presence of O-H groups, which is consistent with alcohols or carboxylic acids, while the strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 wavenumbers indicate carbonyl functionalities typical of ketones or esters. The presence of vinyl hydrogens in the 1H NMR spectrum suggests unsaturation, which is compatible with C6H10O2. Additionally, the mass spectrum fragment at m/z = 45 supports the presence of smaller fragments that could arise from a compound with a carbonyl group, further corroborating the presence of an ester or ketone. Therefore, C6H10O2 is the most consistent chemical formula for the unknown compound based on the comprehensive analysis of all spectroscopic data.

proposed answer: The selected molecular formula C6H10O2 is validated by the spectral evidence provided. The FTIR spectrum shows a broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹, which is indicative of O–H stretching, suggesting the presence of an alcohol or carboxylic acid. The strong peaks at 1700 cm⁻¹ and 1650 cm⁻¹ indicate the presence of carbonyl (C=O) groups, which are consistent with the presence of a carboxylic acid or ketone. The 1H NMR spectrum shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens, which supports the presence of an alkene functionality. The mass spectrum fragment at m/z = 45 suggests the presence of a carbonyl group, which aligns with the presence of C=O in C6H10O2. Other candidate formulas such as C6H12O do not account for the carbonyl functionality, while C6H10O does not account for the O–H peak, and C6H12O2 has too many hydrogens for the observed functionalities. Therefore, C6H10O2 is the most consistent with all the spectral evidence, confirming its suitability as the molecular formula for the unknown compound.
