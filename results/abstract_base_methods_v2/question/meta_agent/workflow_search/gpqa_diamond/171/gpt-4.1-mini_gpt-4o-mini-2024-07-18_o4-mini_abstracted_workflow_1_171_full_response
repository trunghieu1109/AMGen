This distribution relates the population of atoms in different energy states to the temperature of the system and the energy difference between those states.

In this case, since the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2, we can relate this to the effective temperatures of the stars using the Boltzmann distribution, which leads to the conclusion that the temperature difference can be expressed in terms of the natural logarithm of the population ratio, ln(2).; answer - The Boltzmann distribution relates population ratios to temperature and energy difference.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - The ratio of excited iron atom populations in star_1 and star_2 can be expressed using the Boltzmann factor. According to the Boltzmann distribution, the ratio of populations N1 (for star_1) and N2 (for star_2) is given by: N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp(-ΔE/kT). Here, since we are considering the same energy levels for both stars, we can assume g1 = g2, simplifying the equation to N1/N2 = exp(-ΔE/kT).

According to the Boltzmann distribution, the population ratio of two energy levels is given by: N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp(-ΔE/kT). Here, we are considering the populations of excited states in two stars, where N1 is the population in star_1 and N2 is the population in star_2. Given that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2, we have N1 = 2N2. The energy difference ΔE is given as approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J.
