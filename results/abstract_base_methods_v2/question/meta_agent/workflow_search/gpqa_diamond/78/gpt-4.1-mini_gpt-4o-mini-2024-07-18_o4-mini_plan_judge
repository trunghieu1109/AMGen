proposed answer: To determine the most plausible structure of Compound X (C11H12O) based on the provided NMR data and the reaction conditions, we analyze the signals from both the 1H and 13C NMR spectra. The 1H NMR shows two singlets at δ 2.28 and δ 2.31, indicating two equivalent methyl groups, which suggests a symmetrical structure likely attached to an aromatic system. The presence of aromatic protons in the range of δ 6.75 to δ 7.71 indicates a substituted aromatic ring. The 13C NMR data supports this, revealing signals that correspond to both aliphatic and aromatic carbons, including a carbonyl or epoxide carbon at δ 197.7. Given the reaction conditions involving a nucleophilic catalyst, it is reasonable to conclude that Compound X contains an epoxide functional group. Among the choices provided, '2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane' (choice 2) is the most consistent with the NMR data, as it features an aromatic ring with a methyl substituent and an epoxide group, aligning with the signals observed in the spectra. The other options either do not match the NMR data or lack the required structural features. Therefore, the most plausible structure of Compound X is '2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane'.

proposed answer: After evaluating the mechanistic insights and the structure-to-NMR analysis, it is clear that the most plausible structure for Compound X is 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. This conclusion is supported by the presence of aromatic protons and the expected carbonyl group indicated by the NMR data. Although none of the candidate structures perfectly align with the carbonyl signal, this structure has the highest aromatic character and fits the molecular formula provided. Additionally, the epoxide is consistent with the reaction mechanism involving epoxide ring-opening, which aligns with the expected reaction pathway. Therefore, despite some discrepancies, 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane is the most reasonable choice given the available data.
