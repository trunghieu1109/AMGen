Question: Example(question='You are analyzing a small peptidic compound that has been chemically synthesized. The 1H NMR spectrum of the crude compound appears consistent with the expected molecule, with the exception of two peaks that both correspond to the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar chemical shifts and roughly equal integrals (together they integrate to 1H - the expected integral); based on the coupling pattern, you can rule out spin-spin coupling as an explanation for the duplicate peaks. LC-MS analysis of the crude compound at elevated temperature shows two clearly defined peaks of equal intensities. Both peaks have the same mass spectrum, which is consistent with the expected molecule. What is the most likely explanation for these observations?', choice1='The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers', choice2='The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers', choice3="'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction", choice4='The compound is contaminated with a precursor', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: The analysis of the NMR and LC-MS data indicates that the presence of two peaks for the same alpha-proton, along with two distinct peaks in the LC-MS with equal intensities and identical mass spectra, strongly suggests the existence of diastereoisomers. Enantiomers would not produce two distinct NMR peaks since they would have identical chemical environments and therefore similar spectral characteristics. The equal integrals of the NMR peaks confirm that they correspond to different environments of protons, which is a hallmark of diastereoisomers. Additionally, the absence of spin-spin coupling rules out the possibility of double coupling artifacts. Contamination with a precursor could also lead to similar peaks, but the identical mass spectra observed in the LC-MS analysis further supports that the peaks correspond to different isomeric forms of the same compound rather than a contaminant. Therefore, the most likely explanation for the observations is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers.

proposed answer: After analyzing the evidence from the spectral features and considering the chemical context, the most likely explanation for the observed spectral features is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers. The presence of two distinct peaks for the same alpha-proton in the 1H NMR spectrum, both integrating to 1H, indicates that these peaks arise from different stereochemical environments, which is characteristic of diastereoisomers. The similar chemical shifts and equal integrals suggest that these peaks are not due to spin-spin coupling, which has been ruled out by the coupling patterns. Furthermore, the LC-MS analysis showing two distinct peaks of equal intensity with identical mass spectra supports the diastereoisomer hypothesis, as diastereoisomers can exhibit different chromatographic behaviors despite having the same molecular formula. In contrast, a mixture of enantiomers would typically not produce distinct NMR signals unless in a chiral environment, which is not indicated here. The idea of 'double coupling' during an amide-bond forming reaction does not adequately explain the observed data, and contamination with a precursor would likely lead to additional signals in the mass spectrum, which is not observed. Therefore, considering the evidence and chemical plausibility, the conclusion is that the compound is best explained as a mixture of diastereoisomers, aligning with the observed spectral features and chromatographic behavior.
