We denote the eigenfunction \u03c6 as a 2-dimensional column vector, \u03c6 = [\u03c61, \u03c62]. The matrix multiplication Ay(\u03c6) will yield a new vector.

This resulting vector should equal a * \u03c6, where a is the eigenvalue.

This indicates that the eigenvalues are h/(4\u03c0) and -h/(4\u03c0). In the context of intrinsic angular momentum, these eigenvalues correspond to the quantized values of the angular momentum component along the y-axis for the muon, which is consistent with the expected behavior of spin-1/2 particles.

Therefore, the eigenvectors of Ay can be simultaneous eigenfunctions of A^2. However, for Az, we need to check the commutation relation [Ay, Az]. If Ay and Az do not commute, then the eigenvectors of Ay cannot be simultaneous eigenfunctions of Az.
