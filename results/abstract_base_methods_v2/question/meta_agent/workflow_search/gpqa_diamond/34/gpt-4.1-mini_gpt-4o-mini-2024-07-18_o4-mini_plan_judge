Question: Example(question='Consider the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, A of a muon be represented by a 2×2 matrix Ay satisfying the eigenvalue equation Ay(φ) = a(φ). Here, a is the eigenvalue, φ is the eigenfunction. The matrix operator has the form Ay = c∙S; where the constant c=h/4π and S being a 2×2 matrix. The first row of the matrix S is (0   -i) and the second row is (i  0). You are asked to calculate the eigenvalue and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. During the calculation, which statement below will you consider to be correct? ', choice1='The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A^2, but not of the Z-component, Az.', choice2='The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.', choice3='The imaginary part of the eigenvalue of Ay are +1/2 or –1/2, and the real part of that are +1 or –1. ', choice4='The imaginary part of the eigenvalue of Ay are +2πh or –2πh, and the real part of that are +h/4π or –h/4π. ', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: After analyzing the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay, we find that the eigenfunctions φ correspond to the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. The first statement is incorrect because eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of Az. The second statement is correct as the eigenfunctions derived from the matrix operator will indeed form a basis in the corresponding Hilbert space. The third and fourth statements regarding the imaginary and real parts of the eigenvalues are incorrect, as the eigenvalues we calculated are purely real and do not match the values given in those statements. Therefore, the only correct statement is the second one.

proposed answer: After evaluating the statements regarding the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the operator Ay, it is clear that statement 1 is the most accurate. It correctly identifies that the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, which aligns with the principles of angular momentum in quantum mechanics. However, it incorrectly suggests that they cannot be eigenfunctions of Az, which is misleading. Statement 2 is not entirely correct as the eigenfunctions are not necessarily the same as the basis functions of Ay. Statements 3 and 4 are incorrect regarding the nature of the eigenvalues, as they do not have imaginary parts. Therefore, the best choice based on the analysis is A).
