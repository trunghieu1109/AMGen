proposed answer: To determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of the final product 4 (ethyl 2-pentylcyanoacetate), we analyze the molecular structure. The product contains an ethyl group, which contributes 3 distinct hydrogens (1 from the terminal methyl and 2 from the methylene). The pentyl chain contributes additional distinct hydrogens depending on its structure. The terminal methyl of the pentyl chain contributes 3 distinct hydrogens, and the methylene groups can contribute 2 more distinct signals depending on their environments. The cyano group does not contribute any hydrogens. Considering the symmetry and the chemical environments, we can identify that there are 8 distinct hydrogen signals observable in the 1H NMR spectrum of product 4. Therefore, the final count of distinct hydrogen signals is 8.

proposed answer: After analyzing the molecular structure of product 4, which has the formula C10H15BrN2O2, we consider the various functional groups and the symmetry of the molecule. The presence of bromine and nitrogen introduces different chemical environments for the hydrogen atoms. By examining the connectivity and the unique environments created by these groups, we can categorize the hydrogen atoms into distinct types. The analysis indicates that there are 8 distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum, as each unique environment corresponds to a distinct signal. Therefore, the conclusion is that there are 8 distinct hydrogen signals observable.
