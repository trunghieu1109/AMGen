proposed answer: To synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, the optimal reaction sequence should start with nitration using HNO3/H2SO4 to introduce a nitro group, followed by bromination using Br2/FeBr3 to place a bromine at the meta position relative to the nitro group, and finally Friedel-Crafts acylation using CH3COCl/AlCl3 to introduce the ethanone group. Upon reviewing the provided options, none of them follow this correct sequence. Therefore, there is no correct option among A, B, C, or D that corresponds to the optimal reaction sequence for synthesizing the target molecule efficiently without undesired side reactions or low yield steps.

proposed answer: After evaluating all the provided reaction sequences, it is clear that the target molecule 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one requires specific functional group placements on the phenyl ring. The optimal sequence should start with bromination to introduce the bromo group at the 3-position, followed by nitration to place the nitro group at the 5-position, and finally Friedel-Crafts acylation to add the ethanone group at the 1-position. Choice 3 begins with bromination (i) Br2/FeBr3, which is essential for the correct positioning of the bromo group. It then proceeds with nitration (ii) HNO3/H2SO4, allowing for the introduction of the nitro group at the desired position. The sequence continues with Friedel-Crafts acylation (iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3, which effectively adds the ethanone group. This order of reactions ensures that the substituents are placed correctly and that the overall yield is maximized with minimal side reactions. Other choices either misplace the order of reactions or introduce groups in a way that could lead to lower yields or undesired products. Therefore, choice 3 is the most logical and efficient pathway for the synthesis.
