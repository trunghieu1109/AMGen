Question: Example(question="You want to study the role of the GADD45G protein in a mouse model. You are highly interested in whether the IL-2-induced protein has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. You decide to create a transgenic mouse model with the inducible overexpression of the coding sequence for the GADD45G gene. You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus. For that purpose, you will modify the gene's coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein. You genetically engineer the plasmid and, aided by Lipofectamine®, transfect it into the Chinese hamster ovary cells. You select the antibiotic-resistant cell colonies to test the expression level of your construct. Once you begin, you observe that you are unable to overexpress your protein as you expected. In the series of tests you undertake to identify the cause, you realize that the sequence of the plus strand of your construct reads:\n\n\n5'ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'\n\nYou annoyingly notice the reason.", choice1='The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain', choice2='The ribosome terminated the translation early', choice3='The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation', choice4='The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: The analysis indicates that the HA tag region has a missense mutation, which prevents it from matching the canonical HA antigenic determinant sequence. This mismatch is critical because the HA tag is essential for the recognition by antibodies, which is necessary for the purification and detection of the protein. Additionally, the absence of a linker sequence between the HA tag and the GADD45G coding sequence poses a significant risk for proteolysis or instability of the nascent protein chain. Linkers provide flexibility and prevent steric hindrance, and their absence can lead to misfolding or aggregation, making the protein more susceptible to degradation. The translated sequence does not contain premature stop codons, and the presence of a UAA codon would not cause translation termination in the mouse system, as mice have the necessary tRNA for UAA. Therefore, the most likely cause of the failure to overexpress the protein in the transfected cells is the combination of the missense mutation in the HA tag, which affects antibody recognition, and the absence of a linker sequence, which compromises the stability and functionality of the recombinant protein.

Answer:The combination of a missense mutation in the HA tag and the absence of a linker sequence.

proposed answer: After integrating the findings from the sequence verification, translation analysis, mutation detection, linker evaluation, and biological context, it is clear that the primary cause of the failure to overexpress the GADD45G protein is the presence of a UAA stop codon in the translated sequence. This stop codon leads to premature termination of translation, resulting in a truncated protein that cannot be properly expressed or function as intended. While the lack of a linker sequence could contribute to issues such as proteolysis, the immediate and most significant problem is the premature translation termination caused by the UAA codon. This is a critical factor that directly impacts the ability to produce the full-length protein, making it the priority issue to address in order to achieve successful overexpression. Therefore, the primary cause is confirmed to be the UAA stop codon leading to translation termination.

Answer:The primary cause of the failure to overexpress the protein is the presence of a UAA stop codon leading to premature translation termination.
