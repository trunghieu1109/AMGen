        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The interaction Lagrangian indicates that the boson X couples to fermions through the term involving the coupling constant lambda_f. The fermions that can couple to the boson X are quarks and leptons. The quarks include the up (u), down (d), charm (c), strange (s), top (t), and bottom (b) quarks. The leptons include the electron (e), muon (mu), and tau (tau). Therefore, the potential fermions that could couple to the boson X are: u, d, c, s, t, b, e, mu, and tau.; answer - The potential fermions that could couple to the boson X are: u, d, c, s, t, b, e, mu, and tau.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - To determine the kinematic feasibility of the decay of the boson X (mass = 6 GeV) into fermion-antifermion pairs, we need to consider the masses of the relevant fermions identified: up (u), down (d), charm (c), strange (s), top (t), bottom (b), electron (e), muon (mu), and tau (tau). The masses are approximately: u ~ 2 MeV, d ~ 4 MeV, c ~ 1.27 GeV, s ~ 95 MeV, t ~ 173 GeV, b ~ 4.18 GeV, e ~ 0.511 MeV, mu ~ 0.106 GeV, tau ~ 1.78 GeV. For a decay to be kinematically allowed, the mass of the decay products must be less than the mass of the boson. Therefore, we can have decays into pairs of (c, c), (s, s), (u, u), (d, d), (tau, tau), (mu, mu), and (e, e) since their combined masses are less than 6 GeV. However, the decay into (t, t) is not allowed because the top quark's mass exceeds the boson's mass. The bottom quark decay (b, b) is allowed since its mass is 4.18 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. Thus, the kinematically allowed decays of the boson X include pairs of these fermions as long as their combined mass is under 6 GeV.; answer - The kinematically allowed decays of the boson X are: X \\rightarrow c\\bar{c}, s\\bar{s}, u\\bar{u}, d\\bar{d}, \\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}, \\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}, e^{+}e^{-}, b\\bar{b}.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - To determine the kinematically allowed decays of the boson X (mass = 6 GeV), we compare its mass with twice the mass of each relevant fermion. The relevant fermions and their approximate masses are: up (u) ~ 2 MeV, down (d) ~ 4 MeV, charm (c) ~ 1.27 GeV, strange (s) ~ 95 MeV, bottom (b) ~ 4.18 GeV, electron (e) ~ 0.511 MeV, muon (mu) ~ 0.106 GeV, and tau (tau) ~ 1.78 GeV. The pairs that can decay must satisfy the condition that their combined mass is less than 6 GeV. The pairs that are kinematically allowed are: (c, c) with 2.54 GeV, (s, s) with 190 MeV, (u, u) with 4 MeV, (d, d) with 8 MeV, (tau, tau) with 3.56 GeV, (mu, mu) with 0.212 GeV, and (e, e) with 1.022 MeV. The pair (b, b) is not allowed since its combined mass is 8.36 GeV, which exceeds 6 GeV.
