Question: Example(question='A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory? Take the speed of light in vacuum c=1.', choice1='(1+n*v)/(n-v)\n\n\n', choice2='(1-n*v)/(n+v)\n\n', choice3='(1+n*v)/(n+v)\n\n', choice4='1', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_40
proposed answer: The derived expression for the speed of light in glass relative to the observer is (1 + n*v) / (n + v). This expression matches exactly with one of the provided multiple-choice options, specifically choice 3, which is also (1 + n*v) / (n + v). Therefore, the correct answer is choice 3, as it is the only option that corresponds to the derived expression without any further simplification needed.
