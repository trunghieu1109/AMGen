Question: Example(question='Compounds that have the same molecular formula but are different in their structural arrangement are known as isomers. Isomers have two types, constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but differ in their structures. In stereoisomers, molecules are connected in the same way, but their arrangements in space are different.\nAmong the given compounds (benzoquinone & cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione) the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) and among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate which one will show optical isomerism (B).', choice1='A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate', choice2='A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate', choice3='A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate', choice4='A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_20
proposed answer: After analyzing the results from the previous sub-tasks, it is clear that benzoquinone does not exhibit tautomerism, while cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does. Additionally, dimethyl fumarate is the compound that shows optical isomerism due to its chiral centers, whereas methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate does not. Therefore, the correct combination that includes benzoquinone (the compound not showing tautomerism) and dimethyl fumarate (the compound showing optical isomerism) corresponds to choice 1: A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate.

proposed answer: After analyzing the compounds in question, it is evident that benzoquinone does not exhibit tautomerism due to its structural constraints that prevent hydrogen transfer and double bond shifts. In contrast, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo tautomerism because it has multiple carbonyl groups and the necessary hydrogen atoms for transfer. Regarding optical isomerism, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a stereogenic center, allowing it to exist as enantiomers, while dimethyl fumarate lacks any stereogenic centers and therefore cannot exhibit optical isomerism. Thus, the correct choices are A = benzoquinone for not showing tautomerism and B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate for showing optical isomerism, which corresponds to choice C in the provided options.
