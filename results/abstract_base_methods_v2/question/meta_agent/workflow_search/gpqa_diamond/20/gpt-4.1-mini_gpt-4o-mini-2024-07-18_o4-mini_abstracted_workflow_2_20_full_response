Answer is a string include the answer for this query'}], sub_tasks='Sub-task 1 output: thinking - Tautomerism is a type of isomerism where isomers (tautomers) can readily interconvert, typically involving the relocation of a proton and a shift of a double bond. The most common example is keto-enol tautomerism, where a ketone (keto form) can convert to an enol (alcohol form) by the transfer of a hydrogen atom and the movement of a double bond. For a compound to exhibit tautomerism, it generally needs to have a hydrogen atom that can be easily transferred and a suitable structural framework that allows for the formation of both forms. In the case of benzoquinone, it does not show tautomerism because it lacks the necessary structural features to interconvert between forms. On the other hand, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can exhibit tautomerism due to the presence of multiple carbonyl groups that can participate in keto-enol interconversion. Therefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism is benzoquinone (A). Regarding optical isomerism, dimethyl fumarate has a double bond that creates a cis-trans isomerism, allowing for optical isomers, while methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate does not have such a feature. Thus, dimethyl fumarate shows optical isomerism (B).; answer - A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - Benzoquinone has a structure that does not allow for the hydrogen transfer and double bond shift necessary for tautomerism. It is a cyclic compound with two carbonyl groups, and its structure does not facilitate the formation of an enol form. In contrast, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has multiple carbonyl groups that can participate in keto-enol tautomerism due to the presence of hydrogen atoms that can be transferred and the structural flexibility needed for the interconversion. Therefore, benzoquinone is the compound that does not show tautomerism.; answer - A = benzoquinone\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3a output: thinking - To identify stereogenic (chiral) centers in methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, we need to analyze their structures. A stereogenic center is typically a carbon atom that is bonded to four different substituents. \n\n1. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure can be represented as CH3-CH(OH)-C(=O)OCH3. The second carbon (C2) is attached to an -OH group, a methyl group (CH3), a carboxylate group (C(=O)O), and a hydrogen atom. Since C2 is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center.\n\n2. **Dimethyl fumarate**: The structure can be represented as C(=O)OCH3-CH=CH-C(=O)OCH3. In this compound, the double bond between the two central carbons (C2 and C3) means that they cannot be chiral centers because they do not have four different substituents. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not have any stereogenic centers.\n\nThus, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has one chiral center, while dimethyl fumarate has none.; answer - Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has one stereogenic center at C2; dimethyl fumarate has no stereogenic centers.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3b output: thinking - Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has one stereogenic center at C2, which means it can exist in two non-superimposable mirror image forms (enantiomers). This leads to optical isomerism because these enantiomers will rotate plane-polarized light in different directions. On the other hand, dimethyl fumarate does not have any stereogenic centers, meaning it cannot exhibit optical isomerism as there are no chiral molecules that can form enantiomers. Therefore, only methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism due to its chiral center, while dimethyl fumarate does not.; answer - Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism; dimethyl fumarate does not.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3c output: thinking - Geometric (cis-trans) isomerism occurs due to the restricted rotation around a double bond, leading to different spatial arrangements of substituents. In dimethyl fumarate, the presence of a double bond between the two central carbons allows for cis and trans configurations, where the two methyl groups can be on the same side (cis) or opposite sides (trans). However, this does not create chiral centers, as the double bond does not allow for four different substituents on any carbon. On the other hand, optical isomerism arises from the presence of chiral centers, which are carbon atoms bonded to four different groups. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has one chiral center at C2, allowing for two non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers), which is the essence of optical isomerism. Therefore, while dimethyl fumarate can exhibit geometric isomerism, it cannot exhibit optical isomerism due to the absence of chiral centers. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, with its chiral center, can exhibit optical isomerism but does not have geometric isomers due to the absence of double bonds in its structure.; answer - Geometric (cis-trans) isomerism occurs in dimethyl fumarate due to the double bond allowing for different spatial arrangements of substituents, while optical isomerism occurs in methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate due to its chiral center. Dimethyl fumarate has no chiral centers and thus cannot exhibit optical isomerism.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has one stereogenic center at C2, which allows it to exist in two non-superimposable mirror image forms (enantiomers). This characteristic leads to optical isomerism, as these enantiomers will rotate plane-polarized light in different directions. In contrast, dimethyl fumarate does not have any stereogenic centers, meaning it cannot exhibit optical isomerism because there are no chiral molecules that can form enantiomers. Therefore, based on the presence of a chiral center in methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and the absence of such in dimethyl fumarate, it is clear that methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is the compound that exhibits optical isomerism.; answer - Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exhibits optical isomerism.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - Upon reviewing the conclusions from Sub-tasks 2 and 4, the findings are consistent and correct. Benzoquinone does not exhibit tautomerism due to its structural characteristics, which do not allow for the necessary hydrogen transfer and double bond shifts. In contrast, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo tautomerism due to its multiple carbonyl groups and the presence of hydrogen atoms that can be transferred. For optical isomerism, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a stereogenic center, allowing it to exist as enantiomers, while dimethyl fumarate lacks any stereogenic centers, thus cannot exhibit optical isomerism. Therefore, the conclusions drawn are validated and consistent with the principles of stereochemistry and tautomerism.; answer - A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 6 output: thinking - After analyzing the compounds in question, it is evident that benzoquinone does not exhibit tautomerism due to its structural constraints that prevent hydrogen transfer and double bond shifts.

Regarding optical isomerism, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a stereogenic center, allowing it to exist as enantiomers, while dimethyl fumarate lacks any stereogenic centers and therefore cannot exhibit optical isomerism.

It consists of a cyclic structure with two carbonyl groups that do not facilitate the interconversion necessary for tautomerism. In contrast, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has multiple carbonyl groups that allow it to participate in keto-enol tautomerism. Therefore, benzoquinone does not exhibit tautomerism.; answer: A = benzoquinone\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent GASx, determining non-tautomeric compound, thinking: Benzoquinone is a compound that contains a cyclic structure with two carbonyl groups (C=O) in a conjugated system, which does not provide the necessary structural features for tautomerism, particularly keto-enol tautomerism, as it lacks the hydrogen atom that can easily transfer to create an enol form. In contrast, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has multiple carbonyl groups that can participate in tautomeric shifts, allowing it to interconvert between keto and enol forms. Therefore, benzoquinone does not exhibit tautomerism, while cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does.

This presence of a chiral center leads to optical isomerism, as the two forms will rotate plane-polarized light in different directions. On the other hand, dimethyl fumarate has no stereogenic centers, meaning it cannot form optical isomers because it lacks chiral centers that would create non-superimposable mirror images.
