In this expression, 'a' is a constant that scales the amplitude of the wave function, 'x' is the variable representing position along the tube, and 'i' is the imaginary unit which indicates that the wave function has both real and imaginary parts. The term 'sqrt(1 + x)' in the denominator suggests that as 'x' increases, the amplitude of the wave function decreases, which is typical in quantum mechanics where the probability density is related to the square of the amplitude.
