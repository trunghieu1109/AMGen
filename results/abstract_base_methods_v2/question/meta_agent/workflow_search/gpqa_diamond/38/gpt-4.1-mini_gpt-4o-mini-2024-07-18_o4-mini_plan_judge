proposed answer: To determine the numerical value of 'a' that satisfies the normalization condition, we derived the equation a^2 * (ln(4) - ln(2)) + 0.5 = 1. Rearranging this gives us a^2 = 0.5 / (ln(4) - ln(2)). Since ln(4) - ln(2) simplifies to ln(2), we have a^2 = 0.5 / ln(2). Calculating this yields a = sqrt(0.5 / ln(2)). Numerically evaluating this expression results in approximately 0.85. This value matches one of the provided multiple-choice options (0.85, 1.1, 0.35, 0.6), confirming that 0.85 is indeed the correct answer. Therefore, the final decision on the numerical value of 'a' is 0.85.
