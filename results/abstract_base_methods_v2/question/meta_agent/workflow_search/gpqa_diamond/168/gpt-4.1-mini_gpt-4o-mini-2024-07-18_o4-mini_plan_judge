proposed answer: In the original decay, the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous, allowing for a range of energy values up to a maximum endpoint Q. When one massless particle M replaces the two V particles in the variant decay, the energy available for the outgoing E particles is altered. The massless particle does not contribute any mass-energy, which effectively reduces the total energy that can be allocated to the E particles. Consequently, the spectrum remains continuous but with an adjusted shape due to the redistribution of energy. Furthermore, the maximum energy endpoint of the E particles decreases compared to the original decay because the energy that was previously shared with the two V particles is now altered by the introduction of the massless particle M. Therefore, the correct comparison indicates that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases relative to Q.

proposed answer: In the original decay, the energy of the emitted particles E is shared with the two massive particles V. When these two massive particles are replaced by a single massless particle M, all the energy that would have been allocated to the rest mass of the two V particles becomes available for the kinetic energy of the E particles. This results in an increase in total kinetic energy for the E particles. The massless particle M allows for a broader range of momentum states for the emitted E particles, hence the total energy spectrum remains continuous. Additionally, since the energy available for the E particles has increased, the endpoint energy also increases. This conclusion aligns with the principles of energy conservation and the behavior of massless particles, confirming that there are no contradictions in this analysis.
