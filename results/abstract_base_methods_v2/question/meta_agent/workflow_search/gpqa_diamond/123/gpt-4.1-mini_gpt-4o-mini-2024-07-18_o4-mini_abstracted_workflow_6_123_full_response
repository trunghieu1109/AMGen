The radius of the detector is given as 30 meters, which is a physical dimension of the setup. The initial Lorentz factor is approximately 20, which describes the relativistic speed of the particles. The initial survival fraction of the particles reaching the detector's inner walls is stated to be one third (1/3), and the target survival fraction that we want to achieve is two thirds (2/3). These parameters are crucial for calculating the required Lorentz factor to achieve the desired survival fraction of particles.; answer - Detector radius: 30 m, Initial Lorentz factor: ~20, Initial survival fraction: 1/3, Target survival fraction: 2/3.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - To derive the analytic exponential decay relation, we start with the survival fraction of particles reaching the detector's inner walls, which can be modeled using the exponential decay formula. The survival fraction S after traveling a distance R (the radius of the detector) is given by S = e^(-R/λ), where λ is the decay length. The decay length λ is related to the Lorentz factor γ and the proper lifetime τ₀ of the particles by the relation λ = γ * c * τ₀, where c is the speed of light. When calculating the survival fractions for different Lorentz factors, the constants τ₀ and c will cancel out when taking ratios, leading to the conclusion that the survival fraction is dependent on the ratio of the radius to the decay length, which is proportional to the Lorentz factor. Therefore, we can express the relationship as S = e^(-R/(γ * c * τ₀)). This shows the connection between the survival fraction, detector radius, and decay length while confirming that the constants cancel out when comparing different scenarios.; answer - The analytic exponential decay relation is S = e^(-R/(γ * c * τ₀)), where S is the survival fraction, R is the detector radius, λ = γ * c * τ₀ is the decay length, and the constants τ₀ and c cancel out when taking ratios.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - To compute the initial decay length λ₀, we use the relationship derived from the survival fraction S = e^(-R/λ). Given that the survival fraction is 1/3 and the radius R is 30 m, we can rearrange the equation to find λ₀. Specifically, we have λ₀ = -R / ln(S). Substituting the values, we get λ₀ = -30 / ln(1/3). The natural logarithm of 1/3 is approximately -1.0986, so we can calculate λ₀ as follows: λ₀ = -30 / (-1.0986) ≈ 27.3 m. Therefore, the initial decay length λ₀ is approximately 27.3 meters, which is a reasonable value given the parameters of the problem.; answer - 27.3 m\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - To compute the new decay length λ_new required to achieve the target survival fraction of 2/3 at the same detector radius of 30 meters, we use the formula λ_new = -R / ln(S). Here, R is the radius of the detector (30 m) and S is the target survival fraction (2/3). Substituting these values into the formula gives us λ_new = -30 / ln(2/3). The natural logarithm of 2/3 is approximately 0.405465, so we calculate λ_new as 30 / 0.405465, which results in approximately 74.1 meters. This calculation is valid as it follows the derived exponential decay relation and uses the correct parameters.; answer - 74.1 m\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - To find the new Lorentz factor γ_new, we first calculate the ratio of the new decay length λ_new to the initial decay length λ₀. From Sub-task 3, we have λ₀ ≈ 27.3 m, and from Sub-task 4, we have λ_new ≈ 74.1 m. The ratio γ_new / γ₀ is given by λ_new / λ₀, which is 74.1 / 27.3. This simplifies to approximately 2.72. The original Lorentz factor γ₀ is given as ~20. Therefore, we compute the new Lorentz factor γ_new as γ₀ × (γ_new / γ₀) = 20 × 2.72 ≈ 54.4. Rounding this to the nearest whole number gives us 54. Thus, the new Lorentz factor needed for about two thirds of the particles to reach the detector inner walls is approximately 54.

The survival fraction S at a distance d can be expressed as S = e^(-d/λ), where λ is the decay length. The decay length λ is related to the proper lifetime τ₀ of the particle and the Lorentz factor γ by the relation λ = γτ₀c, where c is the speed of light. Therefore, we can express the survival fraction as S = e^(-d/(γτ₀c)). \n\nNow, considering the specific case where we have a detector of radius R (30 m), we can write S = e^(-R/(γτ₀c)). This shows that the survival fraction depends on the radius of the detector, the Lorentz factor, and the proper lifetime of the particles. \n\nWhen we take the ratios of survival fractions for different Lorentz factors, the constants τ₀ and c will cancel out, leading to a simplified relationship that only depends on the Lorentz factors and the distance. This is crucial for finding the required Lorentz factor to achieve a specific survival fraction. Hence, we can conclude that the decay length λ is proportional to the Lorentz factor γ, and the constants cancel out when taking ratios, allowing us to solve for the required γ to achieve the desired survival fraction of 2/3.; answer: The analytic exponential decay relation connecting survival fraction, detector radius, and decay length (λ) is given by S = e^(-R/(γτ₀c)), where S is the survival fraction, R is the detector radius, and λ = γτ₀c.

The decay length is given by λ = γ * c * τ₀, where τ₀ is the proper lifetime of the particles and c is the speed of light. The survival fraction of particles that reach the detector inner walls can be expressed as S = e^(-R/λ), where R is the radius of the detector. We want to express λ in terms of γ. Substituting λ into the survival fraction equation gives us S = e^(-R/(γ * c * τ₀)). When we take the ratio of survival fractions for different Lorentz factors, the constants c and τ₀ cancel out, leading to a relation solely dependent on the radius and the Lorentz factors. This shows how the survival fraction depends on the detector radius and the Lorentz factor, allowing us to determine the required Lorentz factor for a target survival fraction of 2/3.; answer: The analytic exponential decay relation is S = e^(-R/(γ * c * τ₀)), where S is the survival fraction, R is the detector radius, γ is the Lorentz factor, c is the speed of light, and τ₀ is the proper lifetime.
