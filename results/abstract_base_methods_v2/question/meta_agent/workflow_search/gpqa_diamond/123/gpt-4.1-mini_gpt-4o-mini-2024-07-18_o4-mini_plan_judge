proposed answer: To determine the required Lorentz factor for two thirds of the particles to reach the detector walls, we analyzed the exponential decay relationship. We set up the equation exp(-30/λ) = 2/3, where λ is the decay length. Solving this gives us λ = -30 / ln(2/3). We then relate this decay length to the Lorentz factor γ using the formula λ = γ * c * τ_0, where τ_0 is the proper lifetime of the particles. Given the initial Lorentz factor of ~20, we calculated that a significantly higher Lorentz factor is necessary to achieve the desired fraction of particles reaching the walls. Among the provided options (28, 40, 68, 54), the calculations indicate that the required Lorentz factor is closest to 68, as it is the only value that would significantly increase the fraction of particles reaching the walls compared to the initial condition. Therefore, the closest matching choice is C) 68.

proposed answer: The computed new Lorentz factor γ_new is approximately 54.4, which rounds to 54. Among the provided multiple-choice options (28, 40, 68, 54), the value 54 is the only option that matches the computed result. This indicates that the calculations align with the expected outcomes for the problem, confirming that the new Lorentz factor required for about two thirds of the particles to reach the detector inner walls is indeed 54. Therefore, it is reasonable to select this option as it directly reflects our findings.
