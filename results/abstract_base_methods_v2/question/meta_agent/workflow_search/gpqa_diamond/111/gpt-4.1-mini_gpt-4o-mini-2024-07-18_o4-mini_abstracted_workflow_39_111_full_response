The operator A has the matrix representation [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]. We can denote |up> as |1> and |down> as |2>. Thus, we can express |alpha> in vector form as (1/sqrt(7)) * [1+i, 2-i]. To find ⟨A⟩, we calculate A|alpha> first. This involves the matrix multiplication of A with |alpha>: A * |alpha> = [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]] * (1/sqrt(7)) * [1+i, 2-i]. Performing this multiplication gives us: A|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [ħ/2 * (2-i), ħ/2 * (1+i)] = (ħ/sqrt(7)) * [1, 2]. Now, we compute ⟨alpha|A|alpha⟩ = ⟨alpha| * A|alpha>. This is the inner product of |alpha> and the result we just calculated. The inner product ⟨alpha| is the conjugate transpose of |alpha>: ⟨alpha| = (1/sqrt(7)) * [(1-i), (2+i)]. Thus, we have ⟨alpha|A|alpha⟩ = (1/7) * [(1-i)(ħ/2 * (2-i)) + (2+i)(ħ/2 * (1+i))].

For the first eigenvector v1_normalized = (1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)), the norm is sqrt((1/sqrt(2))^2 + (1/sqrt(2))^2) = sqrt(1/2 + 1/2) = sqrt(1) = 1, confirming it is normalized. For the second eigenvector v2_normalized = (1/sqrt(2), -1/sqrt(2)), the norm is also sqrt((1/sqrt(2))^2 + (-1/sqrt(2))^2) = sqrt(1/2 + 1/2) = sqrt(1) = 1, confirming it is normalized as well.

We need to compute A|alpha> first. The matrix A acting on |alpha> gives us: A|alpha> = A[(1/sqrt(7))((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)] = (1/sqrt(7))A[(1+i)|up>] + (1/sqrt(7))A[(2-i)|down>]. This results in (1/sqrt(7))[(0)(1+i)|up> + (ħ/2)(2-i)|up> + (ħ/2)(1+i)|down> + (0)(2-i)|down>] = (1/sqrt(7))[(ħ/2)(2-i)|up> + (ħ/2)(1+i)|down>]. Now we compute ⟨alpha|A|alpha⟩. We take the inner product: ⟨alpha| = (1/sqrt(7))[(1+i)*⟨up| + (2-i)*⟨down|]. The full expression becomes ⟨alpha|A|alpha⟩ = (1/7)[(1+i)*⟨up| + (2-i)*⟨down|][(ħ/2)(2-i)|up> + (ħ/2)(1+i)|down>].

The normalized state |alpha> is given by |alpha> = (1/sqrt(7))((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>). The matrix representation of A in the |up>, |down> basis is A = [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]. We first compute A|alpha> and then take the inner product with ⟨alpha|. Performing the matrix multiplication, we find A|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7))((1+i)(ħ/2)|down> + (2-i)(ħ/2)|up>). Then we compute ⟨alpha|A|alpha⟩ by taking the inner product, which results in a value that simplifies to 2*hbar/sqrt(7).

The operator A has the matrix representation [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]. We can denote |up> as |1> and |down> as |2>. Thus, we can express |alpha> in vector form as (1/sqrt(7)) * [1+i, 2-i]. To find ⟨A⟩, we calculate A|alpha> first. This involves the matrix multiplication of A with |alpha>: A * |alpha> = [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]] * (1/sqrt(7)) * [1+i, 2-i]. Performing this multiplication gives us: A|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [ħ/2 * (2-i), ħ/2 * (1+i)] = (ħ/sqrt(7)) * [1, 2]. Now, we compute ⟨alpha|A|alpha⟩ = ⟨alpha| * A|alpha>. This is the inner product of |alpha> and the result we just calculated. The inner product ⟨alpha| is the conjugate transpose of |alpha>: ⟨alpha| = (1/sqrt(7)) * [(1-i), (2+i)]. Thus, we have ⟨alpha|A|alpha⟩ = (1/7) * [(1-i)(ħ/2 * (2-i)) + (2+i)(ħ/2 * (1+i))].
