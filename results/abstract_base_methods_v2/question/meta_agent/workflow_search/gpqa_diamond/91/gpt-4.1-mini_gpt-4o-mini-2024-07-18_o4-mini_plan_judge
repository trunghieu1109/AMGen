Question: Example(question='Calculate the enthalpy of formation of (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Given,\nEnthalpy of atomization of carbon = 1000 kJ/mol.\nBond energy of H-H = 100 kJ/mol\nBond energy of C-C = 200 kJ/mol\nBond energy of C=C = 300 kJ/mol\nBond energy of C-H = 400 kJ/mol', choice1='11200 kJ/mol', choice2='1900 kJ/g', choice3='11.44 kJ/g', choice4='67.4 kJ/mol', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_91
proposed answer: The calculated enthalpy of formation is 3100 kJ/mol. When comparing this value to the provided multiple-choice options (11200 kJ/mol, 1900 kJ/g, 11.44 kJ/g, and 67.4 kJ/mol), none of the options match the calculated value. The closest option is 11200 kJ/mol, but it is still significantly higher than 3100 kJ/mol. Therefore, based on the calculations and the available choices, there is no correct answer among the options provided. It is clear that the calculated value does not align with any of the given choices, indicating that either the calculation or the options may contain an error.

Answer:None of the options match the calculated value.
Extracted answer: None of the options match the calculated value.
Correct answer: 3
