proposed answer: After analyzing the reactions of (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene, we find that the (E)-isomer produces one product, while the (Z)-isomer produces two diastereomers. In a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column, these three distinct products will yield three peaks. In contrast, the chiral HPLC column can resolve the diastereomers into separate peaks, resulting in a total of four peaks: one for the (E)-product and two for the diastereomers from the (Z)-product. Therefore, the combined results indicate that there will be 3 peaks in the standard HPLC and 4 peaks in the chiral HPLC, which corresponds to choice 2 in the multiple-choice options provided.

Answer:3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC

proposed answer: After reviewing the analyses from sub-task 6 and sub-task 7, it is clear that the predictions for the number of peaks in standard and chiral HPLC are consistent with the expected behavior of the compounds produced from the reactions. In standard HPLC, the two enantiomers from (E)-oct-4-ene co-elute as one peak each, and the meso compound from (Z)-oct-4-ene counts as another distinct peak, leading to a total of 3 peaks. In contrast, chiral HPLC can separate the enantiomers from (E)-oct-4-ene, resulting in 4 distinct peaks (2 pairs of enantiomers), while the meso compound does not contribute an additional peak. Therefore, the correct multiple-choice answer that describes the number of peaks observed in each chromatogram is '3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC'. This conclusion is supported by the principles of achiral and chiral separation, confirming the accuracy of the peak counts.
