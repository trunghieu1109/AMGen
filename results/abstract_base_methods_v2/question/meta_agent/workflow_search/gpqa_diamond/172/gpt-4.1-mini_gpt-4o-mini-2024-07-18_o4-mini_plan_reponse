The uncertainty in energy \u0394E can be derived from the uncertainty in velocity \u0394v. The relationship between the uncertainty in energy and the uncertainty in velocity can be expressed as \u0394E = m_e v \u0394v. This is because the energy depends on the square of the velocity, and thus the uncertainty in energy is directly proportional to the uncertainty in velocity. Therefore, we can express \u0394E in terms of \u0394v and known quantities as \u0394E = m_e v \u0394v, where m_e is approximately 9.11 \u00d7 10^(-31) kg, v = 2 \u00d7 10^8 m/s, and \u0394v is approximately 5.79 \u00d7 10^5 m/s.

Given the speed of the electron v = 2 \u00d7 10^8 m/s and the speed of light c = 3 \u00d7 10^8 m/s, we calculate \u03b3 as follows: \u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (2/3)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 4/9) = 1 / sqrt(5/9) = 3/sqrt(5).

Given the speed of the electron v = 2 \u00d7 10^8 m/s and the speed of light c = 3 \u00d7 10^8 m/s, we calculate \u03b3 as follows: \u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (2/3)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 4/9) = 1 / sqrt(5/9) = 3/sqrt(5). Next, we compute the rest mass energy of the electron, E_0 = m_e c^2, where m_e is the mass of the electron (approximately 9.11 \u00d7 10^(-31) kg). Thus, E_0 = (9.11 \u00d7 10^(-31) kg)(3 \u00d7 10^8 m/s)^2 = 8.19 \u00d7 10^(-14) J. The relativistic kinetic energy is then E = (\u03b3 - 1)m_e c^2.
