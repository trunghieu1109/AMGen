Question: Example(question="You identified a new ligand-receptor pair initially expressed in the neural crest cells and want to understand the developmental fate of their interaction. The receptor is a monomeric transmembrane barrel with eight alpha helices, four extracellular helices, and three beta sheets that create a binding site for the ligand. The ligand is a coiled-coil of two alpha helices. You create a bicistronic lox-Cre vector with the ligand ORF at the 5' position, fused to mCherry; the receptor ORF is at the 3' and fused to the eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and upstream of the receptor is the IRES regulatory element. Between the ligand ORF and mCherry, there is a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, and between the receptor and the eGFP, there is a stop in the lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. You had also raised antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and now use them to test the construct expression on the Western blot after plasmid transfection to primary astrocyte culture. Total proteins give a signal proportional to the actin loading. You finally breed a mouse model homozygous for your construct in the wt background. You cross it to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice; after the offspring is born you visualize them under the fluorescent confocal microscope. You do not observe a green signal. Which of the answers below explains the most likely reason for it?", choice1='ligand and the receptor are in a paracrine relationship', choice2='the receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame', choice3='the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing', choice4='the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: Upon analyzing the provided choices and correlating them with the observed absence of green fluorescence (eGFP), the most plausible explanation is that 'the receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame'. This conclusion arises from the understanding that if the receptor and eGFP coding sequences are misaligned or not in the same reading frame, the translation would not yield a functional eGFP protein, leading to no green signal being detected. The bicistronic vector with the IRES element should allow for both proteins to be expressed; however, if they are not in frame, the eGFP will not be synthesized correctly. The other options, while possible, do not directly address the issue of the eGFP not being produced due to translational problems. Therefore, the lack of green signal can be most accurately attributed to this specific coding sequence alignment issue.

proposed answer: After considering the provided choices and the analysis from Sub-task 9, the most likely explanation for the absence of the green fluorescence signal (eGFP) in the offspring is that the receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame. This choice aligns with the technical aspects of constructing the bicistronic vector. If the receptor and eGFP are not in the correct reading frame, the translation of the eGFP will not occur, leading to no observable fluorescence. While incomplete Cre recombination is a valid concern, the specific wording of the choices suggests focusing on the construct's integrity, making the frame issue a more direct explanation given the context of the experiment. The other options, such as paracrine relationships or enhancer absence, do not directly address the molecular mechanism of the construct's expression and visualization, further supporting the choice that the receptor-eGFP construct is not properly configured for translation.
