Therefore, to convert θ = 10^-17 degrees to radians, we use the formula: radians = degrees × (π / 180). Thus, θ in radians = 10^-17 × (π / 180). Calculating this gives approximately 1.74533 × 10^-19 radians. This conversion is necessary for further calculations involving physical dimensions, such as the size of the black hole's event horizon.; answer - 1.74533 × 10^-19 radians\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - To calculate the physical diameter of the black hole's event horizon, we use the small angle approximation which states that for small angles in radians, the diameter (D) can be approximated as D = θ * d, where θ is the angular size in radians and d is the distance to the black hole. From Sub-task 1, we found θ to be approximately 1.74533 × 10^-19 radians. The distance d is given as 10^10 parsecs. We first convert parsecs to meters using the conversion 1 parsec = 3.086 × 10^16 meters. Therefore, d = 10^10 parsecs = 10^10 * 3.086 × 10^16 meters = 3.086 × 10^26 meters. Now, substituting these values into the formula: D = θ * d = (1.74533 × 10^-19 radians) * (3.086 × 10^26 meters). This gives us the diameter of the black hole's event horizon. Calculating this, we find D ≈ 5.39 × 10^7 meters. This value represents the physical size of the black hole's event horizon based on the angular size and distance provided.; answer - 5.39 × 10^7 meters\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - The Schwarzschild radius (Rs) is defined as half of the physical diameter of the black hole's event horizon. From Sub-task 2, we calculated the physical diameter D of the black hole's event horizon to be approximately 5.39 × 10^7 meters. Therefore, to find the Schwarzschild radius, we divide this diameter by 2. This calculation is straightforward: Rs = D / 2 = (5.39 × 10^7 meters) / 2 = 2.695 × 10^7 meters. This value accurately represents the Schwarzschild radius of the black hole, which is the radius of the event horizon for a non-rotating black hole.

From Sub-task 3, we found Rs to be 2.695 × 10^7 meters. We can now calculate the area: A = 4π(2.695 × 10^7 m)^2. First, we calculate Rs^2: (2.695 × 10^7 m)^2 = 7.254 × 10^14 m^2. Then, we multiply by 4π: A = 4 * π * 7.254 × 10^14 m^2. Using π ≈ 3.14159, we find A ≈ 4 * 3.14159 * 7.254 × 10^14 m^2 ≈ 9.116 × 10^15 m^2.

Boltzmann's constant k is approximately 1.38 × 10^-23 J/K, and the Planck length l_p is about 1.616 × 10^-35 meters. We already calculated the area A of the event horizon to be approximately 9.116 × 10^15 m^2. Now substituting these values into the formula: S = (1.38 × 10^-23 J/K * 9.116 × 10^15 m^2) / (4 * (1.616 × 10^-35 m)^2). First, we compute (1.616 × 10^-35 m)^2 = 2.617 × 10^-70 m^2.
