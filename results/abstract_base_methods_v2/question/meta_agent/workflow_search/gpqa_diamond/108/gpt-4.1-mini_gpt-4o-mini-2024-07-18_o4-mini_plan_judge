proposed answer: To determine which partial waves are not permitted, we analyze the transitions based on angular momentum conservation, parity conservation, and Pauli statistics. The initial state is 1S0, which has total angular momentum J = 0 and parity +1. The emitted particle X has intrinsic parity -1. For the final NN state, we have the following transitions: 1S0 -> 3P0, 1S0 -> 7D1, 1S0 -> 3D3, and 1S0 -> 3S1. 

1. **Angular Momentum Conservation**: The final state must conserve angular momentum. The 3P0 state has J = 0, which can be achieved with the emission of a particle with angular momentum 0 (s). The 7D1, 3D3, and 3S1 states do not satisfy angular momentum conservation with the given initial state. 

2. **Parity Conservation**: The initial state has parity +1, while the final states have different parities. The 3P0 state has parity -1, which violates parity conservation. The 7D1, 3D3, and 3S1 states also violate parity conservation. 

3. **Pauli Statistics Condition**: For T(NN) = 0, the condition T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2) must hold. The 3P0 state results in an even sum of S + L, which violates the Pauli condition. The other states also violate either angular momentum or parity conservation. 

Thus, all transitions 1S0 -> 3P0, 1S0 -> 7D1, 1S0 -> 3D3, and 1S0 -> 3S1 are not permitted due to violations of conservation laws or Pauli statistics. Therefore, the final answer is that none of these transitions are permitted.

Answer:1S0 -> 3P0, 1S0 -> 7D1, 1S0 -> 3D3, 1S0 -> 3S1

proposed answer: After carefully analyzing the results from angular momentum conservation, parity conservation, and Pauli statistics constraints, it is evident that certain transitions are forbidden. The transition 1S0 -> 3P0 + s violates the Pauli statistics condition, resulting in T = 1, which contradicts the requirement that T(NN) = 0. Additionally, the transitions 1S0 -> 7D1 + p, 1S0 -> 3D3 + f, and 1S0 -> 3S1 + p do not conserve parity, as the initial parity (even) does not equal the final parity (odd) after accounting for the intrinsic parity of the emitted particle X. Therefore, the transitions that are forbidden due to a combination of these conservation laws are 1S0 -> 3P0 + s, 1S0 -> 7D1 + p, 1S0 -> 3D3 + f, and 1S0 -> 3S1 + p. This comprehensive evaluation ensures that all aspects of the problem are taken into account and that the final answer is consistent with the physical principles governing the system.
