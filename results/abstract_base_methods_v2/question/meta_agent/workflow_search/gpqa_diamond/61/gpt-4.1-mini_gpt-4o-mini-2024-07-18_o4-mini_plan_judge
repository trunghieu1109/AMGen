proposed answer: After analyzing the sequences of reagents in each choice against the required synthetic steps for synthesizing 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane, it is clear that none of the options provide a complete and correct pathway. However, Choice 1 is the closest as it correctly includes the initial steps of deprotonation with NaNH2 and alkylation with methyl chloride, followed by hydrogenation with H2 and Pd, and ozonolysis with O3 and (CH3)2S. The final step with Ba(OH)2 does not align with the necessary introduction of the hydroxymethyl group, but it is the most appropriate option available. Therefore, I conclude that the best answer is A).
