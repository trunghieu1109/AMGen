Question: Example(question='Consider a system with Hamiltonian operator $H = \\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n}$. Here, $\\vec{n}$ is an arbitrary unit vector, $\\varepsilon $ is a constant of dimension energy, and components of $\\vec{\\sigma}$ are the Pauli spin matrices. What are the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator?\n', choice1='+ \\varepsilon, -\\varepsilon\n', choice2='+\\varepsilon \\hbar/2, - \\varepsilon \\hbar/2', choice3='+1, -1', choice4='+\\hbar/2, -\\hbar/2', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: The derived eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator H = ε σ · n are ±ε. When comparing these eigenvalues with the provided multiple-choice options, the first choice is '+ ε, -ε', which exactly matches the derived eigenvalues. The other choices do not match the derived eigenvalues of H. Therefore, the correct choice is the first one.
