Question: Example(question='Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are\nconstrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system\ncorrect to three decimals?', choice1='2.822 x 10^-26', choice2='5.645 x 10^-26', choice3='7.056 x 10^-27', choice4='122.330', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_8_179
proposed answer: The computed minimum energy value from Sub-task 6 is 2.822 x 10^-26 Joules. When comparing this value with the provided multiple-choice options, we see that choice 1 is 2.822 x 10^-26, which matches exactly with our computed value. Therefore, the correct choice corresponding to the computed minimum energy is A).
