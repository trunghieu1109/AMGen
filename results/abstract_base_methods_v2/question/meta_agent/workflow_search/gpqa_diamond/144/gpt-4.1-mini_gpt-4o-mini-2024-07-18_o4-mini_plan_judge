Question: Example(question='How many stereoisomers are there for the compound 6-chloro-9-ethyl-2-methylundeca-3,7-dien-5-ol?', choice1='8', choice2='16', choice3='32', choice4='4', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_144
proposed answer: After reviewing the calculations from Sub-task 6, it was determined that the total number of stereoisomers for the compound 6-chloro-9-ethyl-2-methylundeca-3,7-dien-5-ol is 16. This conclusion was reached by considering the contributions from the chiral centers and the double bonds, both of which contributed 4 stereoisomers each, leading to a total of 16. When comparing this result with the provided multiple-choice options (8, 16, 32, 4), the only option that matches our calculated total is 16. Therefore, the correct answer corresponds to choice B.

Answer:B
Extracted answer: B
Correct answer: 2
