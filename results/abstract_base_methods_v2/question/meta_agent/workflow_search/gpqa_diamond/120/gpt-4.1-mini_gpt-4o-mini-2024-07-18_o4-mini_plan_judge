Question: Example(question='When saturated epoxides are reacted with organocuprates, the alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring. In the disubstituted epoxides, inversion of configuration occurs at a carbon to which Nu is added. Identify the product when (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo [4.1.0] heptane is reacted with Me2CuLi:', choice1='(1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol', choice2='(1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol ', choice3='(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol ', choice4='(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol ', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: The predicted product structure and stereochemistry from the reaction of (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo [4.1.0] heptane with Me2CuLi indicates that the nucleophile attacks the less hindered carbon (carbon 2) of the epoxide, resulting in an inversion of configuration at that carbon. The original configuration at carbon 2 is R, and after the nucleophilic attack, it becomes S. The configurations at the other carbons (1, 4, and 5) remain unchanged. Therefore, the resulting product is (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol. Comparing this with the provided options, none of the options match this exact configuration. However, the closest match in terms of configuration is option 4, which is (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol. Thus, option 4 is the correct answer.

Answer:(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol
Extracted answer: (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol
Correct answer: 3

proposed answer: The predicted product structure and stereochemistry from Subtask 6 is (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol. When comparing this with the given multiple-choice options, the correct answer is (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol, which matches the predicted product exactly. This confirms the inversion at carbon 2 while retaining the configurations at the other stereocenters. Therefore, the answer corresponds to the last option provided in the choices.
