Question: Example(question='An electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is also moving along the horizontal axis, but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After colliding, both annihilate producing 2 photons.\n\nThe energies of both photons were measured and they have the same value. The directions were also measured. One of the photons was moving in the upper-right direction, while another in the lower-right direction.\n\nWhat is the angle between the directions of the photons?', choice1='96', choice2='74', choice3='138', choice4='172', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: The calculated angle between the directions of the photons produced in the annihilation event is 96 degrees. This conclusion is based on the symmetry of the emitted photons, which have equal energy and are directed in opposite vertical directions (upper-right and lower-right). The angle between these directions is thus the angle between the two paths, which is 96 degrees. Among the provided multiple-choice options, 96 degrees is explicitly listed as one of the choices, confirming it as the correct answer.

proposed answer: The final calculated angle between the directions of the photons from Subtask 5 is 138 degrees. This value has been confirmed through multiple independent calculations and aligns with the principles of conservation of momentum and energy in particle physics. When comparing this calculated angle to the provided multiple-choice options (96°, 74°, 138°, 172°), the only option that matches is 138°. Therefore, the correct answer choice is clearly option C) 138°.
