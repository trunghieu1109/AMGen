Question: Example(question='An equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 g was heated to 200°C without air. In this case, only a mixture of gases was formed, which, without cooling, was passed successively through tubes filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 (№1), Ca(OH)2 (№2) solution, and red-hot copper (№3). Results: the weights of tubes №1 and №3 increased by 3.60 g and 0.80 g, respectively (CuO formed in tube №3). The weight of the second tube has not changed. As a result, only 2.24 liters of gas C (standard temperature and pressure) remained.\nIndicate the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.', choice1='15', choice2='13', choice3='17', choice4='19', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_63
proposed answer: After analyzing the total number of atoms in salts A and B, I found that the total number of atoms calculated is 15. This matches one of the provided multiple-choice options. The other options (13, 17, and 19) do not match the calculated total. Therefore, the correct answer choice is A) 15.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_63
proposed answer: The total number of atoms in salts A and B was calculated to be 15 based on the composition of the salts and the gases produced during their decomposition. Each salt contributes a specific number of atoms, and when considering the gases formed, the total number of atoms aligns with the choice of 15. This matches the provided options, confirming that 15 is the correct answer based on the chemical reasoning and calculations.
