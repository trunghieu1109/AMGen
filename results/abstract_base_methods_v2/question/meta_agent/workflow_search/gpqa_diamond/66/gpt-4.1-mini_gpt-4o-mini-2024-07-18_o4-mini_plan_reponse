The measurement operators L1z and L2z correspond to the z-components of the angular momentum for each electron. The eigenvalues of L1z and L2z for each electron in the p state (l=1) can take values of -\u0127, 0, and +\u0127. For both electrons to have eigenvalues of -\u0127, we need to consider the coupling of their states. The joint probability of measuring both L1z and L2z as -\u0127 can be derived from the coefficients of the coupled state in the uncoupled basis. Since the total state |1, 1, 2, -1> does not allow both electrons to have -\u0127 simultaneously (as it would require a different m value), the probability is 0.; answer - 0\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - To express the total coupled angular momentum state |1,1,2,-1> in terms of the uncoupled basis states |l1, m1> \u2297 |l2, m2>, we need to consider the possible values of m1 and m2 for each electron. Since both electrons are in a p orbital (l=1), the possible values for m1 and m2 are -1, 0, and +1. The total z-component m for the coupled state is given by m = m1 + m2. For the state |1,1,2,-1>, we have m = -1, which can be achieved by the following combinations of (m1, m2): (-1, 0), (0, -1), and (-1, -1). However, the state |1,1,2,-1> specifically indicates a coupling that allows for certain combinations of m1 and m2. When we express |1,1,2,-1> in the uncoupled basis, we will find that it is a linear combination of the appropriate uncoupled states. The actual expression involves Clebsch-Gordan coefficients which determine the contribution of each uncoupled state to the coupled state. Therefore, the total state can be written as a sum of the appropriate uncoupled basis states, weighted by these coefficients. Thus, the answer is the complete expression in terms of the uncoupled basis states.; answer - The total coupled angular momentum state |1,1,2,-1> can be expressed in terms of the uncoupled basis states as follows: |1,1,2,-1> = \u221a(1/3) (|1, -1> \u2297 |1, 0> + |1, 0> \u2297 |1, -1> + |1, -1> \u2297 |1, -1>).\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - To determine the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for the decomposition of the coupled state |1,1,2,-1> into the uncoupled basis states |1, m1> |1, m2>, we refer to the expression derived in Sub-task 2. The state |1,1,2,-1> can be expressed as a linear combination of the uncoupled states |1, m1> \u2297 |1, m2> where m1 and m2 can take values -1, 0, and +1.

The measurement operators L1z and L2z correspond to the z-components of the angular momentum for each electron. The eigenvalues for L1z and L2z can be calculated from the individual m values of the electrons. Since m1 + m2 = m, we have m1 + m2 = -1. The possible values for m1 and m2 for l1 = 1 and l2 = 1 are -1, 0, and 1. The only combination that gives m1 + m2 = -1 is m1 = -1 and m2 = 0, or m1 = 0 and m2 = -1. Therefore, the probability of measuring both L1z and L2z as -\u0127 is determined by the coefficients of these states in the coupled state.

We need to find pairs (m1, m2) such that m1 + m2 = -1. The allowed pairs are: (m1 = -1, m2 = 0) and (m1 = 0, m2 = -1). Other combinations such as (1, -2), (1, -1), (0, -1), etc., do not satisfy the total m = -1 condition or are not allowed due to the constraints of the magnetic quantum numbers. Therefore, the valid pairs are (m1, m2) = (-1, 0) and (0, -1).; answer - The allowed pairs (m1, m2) are: (-1, 0) and (0, -1).\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2b output: thinking - To compute the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for the decomposition of the coupled state |1,1,2,-1> into the uncoupled basis states |1, m1> \u2297 |1, m2>, we consider the valid pairs (m1, m2) identified in Sub-task 2a, which are (-1, 0) and (0, -1). According to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for adding angular momentum, we find that the coefficient for the state |1, -1> \u2297 |1, 0> contributing to |2, -1> is \u221a(1/3), and similarly for |1, 0> \u2297 |1, -1> also contributes with the same coefficient due to symmetry.

For both pairs, m1 + m2 = -1, which matches the total m = -1. 2) The coefficients from Sub-task 2b are both \u221a(1/3). The sum of the squares of the coefficients is (\u221a(1/3))^2 + (\u221a(1/3))^2 = 1/3 + 1/3 = 2/3, which does not equal 1, indicating that the coefficients need to be normalized. To normalize, we can divide each coefficient by \u221a(2/3), resulting in coefficients of \u221a(1/2) for each term. 3) The coefficients match standard references for |1,1,2,-1> when properly normalized. Therefore, the decomposition is valid but requires normalization to ensure the total probability is 1, confirming physical consistency.; answer - The decomposition is valid but requires normalization to ensure the total probability is 1.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - From the verified decomposition in Sub-task 2c, we identified the pairs (m1, m2) that contribute to the total m = -1.

The coefficient corresponding to this specific measurement outcome is derived from the normalized coefficients we found, which were \u221a(1/2) for each term after normalization. Therefore, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for the outcome where both L1z and L2z yield -\u0127 is \u221a(1/2). This coefficient represents the probability amplitude for both electrons being in the state with m = -1, which is consistent with the total m = -1 for the coupled state.
