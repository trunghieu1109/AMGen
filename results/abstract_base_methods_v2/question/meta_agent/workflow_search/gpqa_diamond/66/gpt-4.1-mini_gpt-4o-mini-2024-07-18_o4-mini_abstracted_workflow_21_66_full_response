The total angular momentum state is given as |1, 1, 2, -1>, indicating that the total angular momentum l = 2 and the z-component m = -1. The measurement operators L1z and L2z correspond to the z-components of the angular momentum for each electron.

We need to find pairs (m1, m2) such that m1 + m2 = -1. The allowed pairs are: (m1 = -1, m2 = 0) and (m1 = 0, m2 = -1). Other combinations such as (1, -2), (1, -1), (0, -1), etc., do not satisfy the total m = -1 condition or are not allowed due to the constraints of the magnetic quantum numbers.

To normalize, we can divide each coefficient by √(2/3), resulting in coefficients of √(1/2) for each term. 3) The coefficients match standard references for |1,1,2,-1> when properly normalized.

The coefficient corresponding to this specific measurement outcome is derived from the normalized coefficients we found, which were √(1/2) for each term after normalization. Therefore, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for the outcome where both L1z and L2z yield -ħ is √(1/2). This coefficient represents the probability amplitude for both electrons being in the state with m = -1, which is consistent with the total m = -1 for the coupled state.
