Question: Example(question='Consider two electrons are in p orbital angular momentum state. Ignoring there spin angular momentum, the coupled angular momentum state of the 2-electron system is represented by $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1,1, 2, -1>. Here, $l_1, l_2$ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of particles 1 and 2 respectively. And, $l, m$ are the total angular momentum quantum number and the corresponding Z component of the 2-electron system respectively. If measurement is made of the orbital angular momentum components $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, what is the joint probability of getting the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$?\n', choice1='1', choice2='1/2', choice3='0', choice4='2/3', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: The calculated joint probability of measuring L1z = -ħ and L2z = -ħ is 1/3. This value does not match any of the provided multiple-choice options: 1, 1/2, 0, or 2/3. Since none of the options correspond to the calculated probability, it indicates that there is no correct answer choice available among the options provided.

proposed answer: The calculated joint probability of measuring L1z = -ħ and L2z = -ħ is 1/2, derived from the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for the coupled angular momentum states of two electrons in p orbitals. The Clebsch-Gordan decomposition indicates that the probability of both electrons having their z-components of angular momentum equal to -ħ is 1/2, which is consistent with the requirement that the total m value must equal -1 for the state |1, 1, 2, -1>. Among the provided options (1, 1/2, 0, 2/3), the value 1/2 is present, making it the correct choice. Therefore, the answer is B.
