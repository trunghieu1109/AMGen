Answer is a string include the answer for this query'}], sub_tasks='Sub-task 1 output: thinking - Spontaneously-broken symmetry occurs when the underlying laws of a system exhibit symmetry, but the state of the system does not. This means that the ground state (or vacuum state) of the system does not share the symmetry of the governing equations. In the context of effective particles, those associated with spontaneously-broken symmetries typically arise as excitations or collective modes in the system. For example, pions are associated with the breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics (QCD), while magnons are related to the breaking of spin symmetry in magnetic systems. Skyrmions are topological solitons that also relate to broken symmetries in field theories. Phonons, however, are quantized modes of vibrations in a medium and are not directly associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry; they arise in systems that maintain translational symmetry.

Skyrmions are topological solitons in field theories that relate to the breaking of chiral symmetry and can be thought of as particles that arise from such symmetry breaking. Pions are the lightest mesons in quantum chromodynamics and are directly associated with the breaking of chiral symmetry in QCD. Phonons, on the other hand, are quantized sound waves in a medium and arise from the normal modes of vibration in a system that retains translational symmetry, thus they are not associated with spontaneously-broken symmetries. Therefore, while magnons, skyrmions, and pions are all linked to spontaneously-broken symmetries, phonons are not, as they emerge in symmetric systems.; answer: Phonon\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent L5bL, describing particles and their origins, thinking: Magnons are collective excitations in a magnetic system that arise due to the breaking of spin symmetry, particularly in ferromagnetic materials. They are associated with the alignment of spins in a lattice and represent the low-energy excitations above the ground state of a magnetically ordered system. Skyrmions are topological solitons that emerge in certain field theories and are linked to the breaking of chiral symmetry, particularly in the context of nuclear physics and non-linear sigma models. Pions are mesons that arise as a result of the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics (QCD), acting as the lightest excitations in this symmetry-breaking scenario. Phonons, on the other hand, are quantized sound waves or vibrational modes in a solid, arising from the collective motion of atoms in a lattice. They do not relate to spontaneously-broken symmetries, as they emerge in systems that maintain translational symmetry.
