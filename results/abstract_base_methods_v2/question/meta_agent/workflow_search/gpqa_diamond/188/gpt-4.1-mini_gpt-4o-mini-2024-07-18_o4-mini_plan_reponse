        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - Spontaneously-broken symmetry occurs when the underlying laws of a system exhibit symmetry, but the state of the system does not. This means that the ground state (or vacuum state) of the system does not share the symmetry of the governing equations. In the context of effective particles, those associated with spontaneously-broken symmetries typically arise as excitations or collective modes in the system. For example, pions are associated with the breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics (QCD), while magnons are related to the breaking of spin symmetry in magnetic systems. Skyrmions are topological solitons that also relate to broken symmetries in field theories. Phonons, however, are quantized modes of vibrations in a medium and are not directly associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry; they arise in systems that maintain translational symmetry. Therefore, phonons do not fit the criteria of being associated with spontaneously-broken symmetry.; answer - Phonon\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - Magnons are collective excitations in a magnetic system that arise due to the breaking of spin symmetry, typically in ferromagnets. Skyrmions are topological solitons that emerge in field theories with broken symmetries, often related to chiral symmetry. Pions are pseudoscalar mesons that are associated with the breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). They are considered Goldstone bosons resulting from this symmetry breaking. Phonons, on the other hand, are quantized sound waves in a solid and arise from the vibrational modes of a lattice that maintains translational symmetry. Thus, phonons do not originate from spontaneously-broken symmetries, which is why they are the only effective particle in this list not associated with such symmetry breaking.; answer - Phonon\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - Upon evaluating each particle against the criteria of association with spontaneously-broken symmetry, we find that Magnons, Skyrmions, and Pions are all associated with such symmetry breaking. Magnons arise from the breaking of spin symmetry in ferromagnets, Skyrmions are linked to chiral symmetry breaking in certain field theories, and Pions are Goldstone bosons resulting from the breaking of chiral symmetry in QCD. In contrast, Phonons are quantized excitations related to the vibrational modes of a lattice that retains translational symmetry, meaning they do not arise from any spontaneously-broken symmetry. Therefore, Phonons are the only effective particle in this list that is not associated with spontaneously-broken symmetry, confirming the previous conclusion. This distinction is significant as it highlights the different physical contexts in which these particles operate, with implications for their roles in various physical phenomena and theories.; answer - Phonon\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - After analyzing the characteristics of the particles Magnon, Skyrmion, Pion, and Phonon, it is evident that Magnons, Skyrmions, and Pions are all associated with spontaneously-broken symmetries. Magnons arise from the breaking of spin symmetry in ferromagnetic materials, Skyrmions are linked to chiral symmetry breaking in certain theoretical frameworks, and Pions are recognized as Goldstone bosons resulting from the breaking of chiral symmetry in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). In contrast, Phonons represent quantized vibrations within a lattice structure that maintains translational symmetry, indicating that they do not stem from any form of spontaneously-broken symmetry. This distinction is crucial, as it highlights the different physical contexts and implications of these particles. Therefore, Phonons are the only effective particle listed that is not associated with spontaneously-broken symmetry.; answer - Phonon\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - After analyzing the options provided, it is clear that Phonons are the only particles listed that do not arise from spontaneously-broken symmetries.
