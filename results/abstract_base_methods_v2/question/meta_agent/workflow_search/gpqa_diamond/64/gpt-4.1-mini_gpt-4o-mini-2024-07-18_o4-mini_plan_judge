Question: Example(question='By considering different factors like heat, acidic and basic medium, etc., select a suitable mechanism and point out the major products from the following reactions.\n1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol + (THF, KH, H+) ---> A\n(E)-pent-2-en-1-ol + acetyl bromide (Base = LDA) ---> B', choice1='A = (E)-bicyclo[5.3.1]undec-1(11)-en-4-one, B = 3-ethylpent-4-enoic acid', choice2='A = (E)-bicyclo[5.3.1]undec-1(11)-en-4-one, B = lithium 3-ethylpent-4-enoate', choice3='A = decahydro-7H-benzo[7]annulen-7-one, B = 3-ethylpent-4-enoic acid', choice4='A = decahydro-7H-benzo[7]annulen-7-one, B = lithium 3-ethylpent-4-enoate', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_64
proposed answer: After analyzing the predicted products from the reactions, we find that the first reaction yields (E)-bicyclo[5.3.1]undec-1(11)-en-4-one, and the second reaction yields lithium 3-ethylpent-4-enoate. Comparing these results with the provided multiple-choice options, only choice 2 accurately reflects both products: A = (E)-bicyclo[5.3.1]undec-1(11)-en-4-one and B = lithium 3-ethylpent-4-enoate. Therefore, choice 2 is the correct answer as it aligns perfectly with the predicted outcomes of the reactions based on the mechanisms considered.
