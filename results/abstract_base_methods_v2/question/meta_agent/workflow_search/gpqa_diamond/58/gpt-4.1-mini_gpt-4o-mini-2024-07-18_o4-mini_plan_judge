Question: Example(question='Determine the pH of the solution of 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2.', choice1='1.38', choice2='12.62', choice3='8.68', choice4='8.92', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_47_58
proposed answer: The calculated pH of the solution is approximately 8.68. When comparing this value with the provided multiple-choice options, we see that option 3 corresponds to 8.68. Therefore, the correct answer choice is C, as it matches the calculated pH.

Answer:C
Extracted answer: C
Correct answer: 2
