Question: Example(question='In an inactive state, a transcription factor subunit awaits an activation signal from the membrane phosphorylation cascade. Upon phosphorylation on the Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, shuttles into the nucleus, and serves in gene transcription. A missense mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. You observe that a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Which of the following molecular phenotypes is most likely observed in the presence of mutation Y?', choice1='loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype', choice2='protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype', choice3='protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele', choice4='change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_24_157
proposed answer: Mutation Y is a dominant-negative mutation in the dimerization domain, which disrupts the ability of the transcription factor to form functional dimers. This interference can lead to protein degradation, as improperly dimerized proteins are often targeted for degradation by the cell's quality control mechanisms. Additionally, the presence of mutation Y compromises the function of the wild-type allele, since the wild-type protein may struggle to dimerize effectively with the mutated protein. Therefore, the most likely molecular phenotype observed in the presence of mutation Y is that the wild-type allele's function is compromised, resulting in protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele. This aligns with choice 3: 'protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele'.
