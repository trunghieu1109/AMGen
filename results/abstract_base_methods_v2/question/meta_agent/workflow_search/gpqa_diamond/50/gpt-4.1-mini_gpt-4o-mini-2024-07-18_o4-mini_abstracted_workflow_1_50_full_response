The grounded conducting sphere will influence the electric field and potential in its vicinity. To solve problems involving such configurations, we can use the method of image charges, which simplifies the analysis by replacing the conducting sphere with an imaginary charge (the image charge) that produces the same effect as the grounded sphere. The image charge is placed inside the sphere at a specific location and has a specific magnitude that ensures the potential on the surface of the sphere remains zero (grounded). This method allows us to calculate the potential energy of the system by considering the interaction between the real charge and the image charge, as well as the geometry of the setup. Therefore, the relevant electrostatic principles include the concept of image charges and the properties of conductors in electrostatic equilibrium.\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent uqgW:\nThe method of image charges applies to this configuration.\n\n### Sub-task 2: Formulate the equivalent image charge system replacing the grounded conducting sphere by determining the magnitude and position of the image charge inside the sphere, based on the known electrostatic boundary conditions. \n\n ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent HEBJ:\nTo replace the grounded conducting sphere with an equivalent image charge system, we need to determine the position and magnitude of the image charge. The image charge, denoted as q\', must be placed inside the sphere at a distance \'r\' from the center, where \'r\' is determined by the relationship between the radius of the sphere R and the distance of the real charge q from the center d. The image charge will have a magnitude of -q(R/d), ensuring that the potential on the surface of the conducting sphere remains zero. The position of the image charge is given by the formula r = R^2/d. This setup allows us to maintain the boundary condition of the grounded sphere while simplifying the calculation of the potential energy of the system.\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent HEBJ:\nThe image charge q\' is placed at a distance r = R^2/d from the center of the sphere and has a magnitude of -q(R/d).\n\n### Sub-task 3a: Derive the general expression for the potential energy of a system involving a real charge and its image charge near a grounded conductor, explicitly including the crucial factor of 1/2 that arises from the method of image charges. Use classical electrostatics principles and clarify the physical interpretation of this factor. \n\n ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent jV3F:\nTo derive the general expression for the potential energy of the system involving a real charge and its image charge, we start by noting that the potential energy U between two point charges is given by U = k * q1 * q2 / r, where k is Coulomb\'s constant, q1 and q2 are the charges, and r is the distance between them. In our case, we have a real charge q located at a distance d from the center of the sphere, and an image charge q\' located at a distance r = R^2/d from the center of the sphere. The magnitude of the image charge is -q(R/d). Therefore, the potential energy U between the real charge q and the image charge q\' can be expressed as U = k * q * (-q(R/d)) / (d - R^2/d). The factor of 1/2 arises in the method of image charges because we consider the potential energy of the interaction between the real charge and the image charge, but we must take into account that the image charge is a mathematical construct that helps us solve for the potential due to the grounded conductor. Thus, the final expression for the potential energy becomes U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2), which incorporates the factor of 1/2 to reflect the nature of the image charge method.\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent jV3F:\nU = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)\n\n### Sub-task 3b: Substitute the specific values of the real charge q, image charge magnitude, and their positions (distance d and image position inside the sphere) into the general potential energy expression derived in subtask_3a.

The potential energy U of the system is given by the formula U = k * (q * q') / r, where k is Coulomb's constant and r is the distance between the real charge and the image charge. In our case, the image charge q' has a magnitude of -q(R/d), and it is placed at a distance r = R^2/d from the center of the sphere. The negative sign indicates that the image charge is opposite in sign to the real charge, which is consistent with the grounded conductor's behavior. The factor of 1/2 arises from the method of image charges because we consider the potential energy of the system as the work done in bringing the image charge from infinity to its position.

The derived formula features a factor of - (1/2), and it contains k, q^2, and R in the numerator, with (d^2 - R^2) in the denominator. Analyzing each option: 1) U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2) matches exactly with the derived formula. 2) U = - k * q^2 * d / (d^2 - R^2) does not match due to the absence of the 1/2 factor and different variables. 3) U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * d / (d^2 + R^2) does not match due to the use of d instead of R and a different denominator. 4) U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R^2 / (d^2 - R^2) does not match due to the R^2 in the numerator instead of R.

The grounded conducting sphere alters the electric field configuration, and the potential energy is influenced by the distance between the charge and the sphere, as well as the radius of the sphere. The derived formula U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2) corresponds to the energy interactions that occur in this specific setup. This formula captures the essence of how the charge interacts with the induced charges on the sphere, leading to the conclusion that choice 1 is indeed correct.

For a grounded conducting sphere, the potential energy of a charge placed outside the sphere is influenced by the induced charge on the sphere's surface. This specific formula accurately captures the relationship between the charge q, the distance d from the center, and the sphere's radius R, as it incorporates the necessary factors that arise from the electrostatic interactions. The negative sign indicates that work is done by the field when the charge is brought closer to the sphere, consistent with the nature of potential energy in electrostatic systems.
