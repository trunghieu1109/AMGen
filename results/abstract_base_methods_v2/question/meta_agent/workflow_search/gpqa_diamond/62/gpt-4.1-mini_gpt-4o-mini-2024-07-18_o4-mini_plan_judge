Question: Example(question='Let there be a diatomic molecule, with elements X and Y, that can be modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model (or non-rigid rotor model). If the molecule is in its fundamental state, what momentum should an absorbed photon have, in order for the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy?\nMx: mass of atom X = 20 amu\nMy: mass of atom Y = 2 amu\nR: molecular bond length = 2 angstroms\nw: angular frequency of vibration = 4*10^14 rad/s', choice1='p = 2.3*10^(-27) N*s', choice2='p = 1.9*10^(-28) N*s', choice3='p = 1.1*10^(-27) N*s', choice4='p = 1.4*10^(-28) N*s', correct_index=4)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_6_62
proposed answer: The calculated photon momentum is approximately 1.45 x 10^(-28) N*s. When comparing this value to the provided multiple-choice options, we find that choice4, which is p = 1.4*10^(-28) N*s, is the closest to the calculated momentum. The other options are either significantly higher or lower than the calculated value. Therefore, choice4 is the most accurate representation of the required photon momentum for the transition from the fundamental state to the first excited state of the molecule.
