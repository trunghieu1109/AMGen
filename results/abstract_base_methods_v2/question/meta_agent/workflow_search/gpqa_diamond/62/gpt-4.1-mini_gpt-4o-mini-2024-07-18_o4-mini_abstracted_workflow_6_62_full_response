Here, Mx = 20 amu and My = 2 amu. First, we convert the atomic masses to kilograms (1 amu = 1.66 * 10^(-27) kg). Therefore, Mx = 20 * 1.66 * 10^(-27) kg and My = 2 * 1.66 * 10^(-27) kg.

The vibrational energy quantum (ΔEvib) is calculated to be 4.22 x 10^(-20) J, which is the energy required to transition from the ground vibrational state to the first excited vibrational state. Additionally, the rotational energy constant (B) is found to be 6.59 x 10^(-23) J, which represents the energy difference between rotational states. The first rotational transition (from J=0 to J=1) has an energy difference of 2B, which equals 1.318 x 10^(-22) J. However, since the vibrational energy quantum is significantly larger than the rotational energy difference, the lowest energy transition is primarily dictated by the vibrational energy quantum. Therefore, the total energy required for the lowest transition is effectively determined by the vibrational energy quantum, which is 4.22 x 10^(-20) J.

The lowest energy transition that can occur involves moving to the first excited vibrational state (ΔEvib) and potentially the first rotational state (which is the next accessible rotational level). The total energy needed for the lowest transition would be the sum of ΔEvib and the energy associated with the first rotational state (which is typically B).

We have ΔE = 4.35318 x 10^(-20) J. Substituting these values into the equation gives us p = (4.35318 x 10^(-20) J) / (3 x 10^8 m/s). Performing this calculation yields the momentum of the photon required for the transition.
