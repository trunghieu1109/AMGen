Question: Example(question='Let us assume stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. In this scenario, how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx?', choice1='~ 1/plx^3', choice2='~ 1/plx^2', choice3='~ 1/plx^1', choice4='~ 1/plx^4', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: After analyzing the derived expression from the previous sub-tasks, it is clear that the number of stars per unit parallax interval scales with parallax (plx) as ~ 1/plx^3. This indicates a cubic relationship where an increase in parallax results in a significant decrease in the number of stars detected per unit of parallax. Among the provided choices, the only one that accurately reflects this relationship is choice 1, which states ~ 1/plx^3. Therefore, I conclude that the correct answer is A.

proposed answer: The verified scaling relation for the number of stars per unit parallax interval, N(plx), is given by the equation N(plx) = 4Ï€ n / plx^4. This indicates that the number of stars decreases with the fourth power of the parallax. As parallax increases, which means stars are further away, the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases significantly. Among the provided choices, the only one that matches this relationship is '~ 1/plx^4', which correctly reflects the inverse fourth power relationship with respect to parallax. Therefore, the correct choice is D).
