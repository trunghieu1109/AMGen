We know that P(100) = 0.32, so we can set up the equation: 0.32 = 1 - e^(-100\u03bb). Rearranging gives us e^(-100\u03bb) = 0.68. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides, we have -100\u03bb = ln(0.68), which leads to \u03bb = -ln(0.68) / 100. Calculating this gives us \u03bb \u2248 0.0473 per minute. This decay constant represents the rate at which the atom decays exponentially over time.; answer - The decay constant (lambda) is approximately 0.0473 per minute.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - To calculate the survival probability of the atom after 50 minutes, we use the exponential decay model. The survival probability S(t) is given by S(t) = e^(-\u03bbt), where \u03bb is the decay constant and t is the time elapsed. From sub-task 1, we found that \u03bb \u2248 0.0473 per minute. For t = 50 minutes, we calculate S(50) = e^(-0.0473 * 50). This gives us the probability that the atom has not decayed after 50 minutes. Performing the calculation, we find S(50) \u2248 e^(-2.365) \u2248 0.093. Thus, the survival probability after 50 minutes is approximately 9.3%.; answer - Approximately 9.3%\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - The memoryless property of the exponential distribution indicates that the probability of decay in the next time interval is independent of how much time has already elapsed. Given that the atom has survived the first 50 minutes, we can treat the next 150 minutes as a new time frame starting from zero. The decay probability for 150 minutes is calculated using the decay constant \u03bb, which we found to be approximately 0.0473 per minute. The probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is given by P(150) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 150). Substituting the value of \u03bb, we find P(150) = 1 - e^(-0.0473 * 150) \u2248 1 - e^(-7.095) \u2248 0.9992. This indicates a very high probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, which aligns with the nature of exponential decay where the longer the time, the higher the probability of decay. However, this result seems excessively high compared to the original decay probability of 32% over 100 minutes, suggesting a potential misunderstanding or error in the decay constant used.

        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The decay probability P(t) for an exponential decay process is given by P(t) = 1 - e^(-lambda * t). We know that the decay probability is 32% (or 0.32) within 100 minutes. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 0.32 = 1 - e^(-lambda * 100). Rearranging gives us e^(-lambda * 100) = 0.68. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides, we have -lambda * 100 = ln(0.68). Thus, lambda = -ln(0.68) / 100. This gives us the decay constant in terms of the natural logarithm of 0.68 divided by 100 minutes.; answer - lambda = -ln(0.68) / 100\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - To compute the decay constant lambda numerically, we use the formula derived in Sub-task 1: lambda = -ln(0.68) / 100. First, we calculate ln(0.68), which is approximately -0.385. Therefore, lambda = -(-0.385) / 100 = 0.00385 per minute. Next, we verify this by calculating the decay probability at 100 minutes using the formula P(t) = 1 - e^(-lambda * t). Substituting t = 100 and lambda = 0.00385 gives us P(100) = 1 - e^(-0.385) = 0.32, which confirms our calculation is correct within \u00b11%. Thus, the numerical value of the decay constant is approximately 0.00385.; answer - lambda = 0.00385\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - In an exponential decay process, the memoryless property states that the probability of survival for a certain time period does not depend on how much time has already passed. Given that the atom has survived for 50 minutes, we want to find the probability that it will survive for an additional 150 minutes. The survival probability S(t) is given by S(t) = e^(-lambda * t). We already calculated lambda as approximately 0.00385. Thus, we compute S(150) = e^(-0.00385 * 150). This results in a survival probability of approximately 0.52, which corresponds to a 52% chance of survival over the next 150 minutes. Hence, the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes is 1 - S(150) = 1 - 0.52 = 0.48 or 48%. Therefore, the conditional survival probability calculation is correct and follows the exponential decay model, which is widely accepted for radioactive decay processes.; answer - 48%\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - To calculate the conditional probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes given it has survived the first 50 minutes, we apply the memoryless property of exponential decay. The survival probability S(t) is given by S(t) = e^(-lambda * t). We have already calculated lambda as approximately 0.00385. The survival probability for the next 150 minutes is S(150) = e^(-0.00385 * 150). This results in a survival probability of approximately 0.52, which corresponds to a 52% chance of survival over the next 150 minutes. Therefore, the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes is 1 - S(150) = 1 - 0.52 = 0.48 or 48%. This calculation confirms that the atom has a 48% chance of decaying in the next 150 minutes after surviving the first 50 minutes, consistent with the properties of exponential decay. However, it is important to note that this calculation assumes the decay process is purely exponential and does not account for any external influences that could affect the decay rate.; answer - 48%\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - The calculated conditional decay probability of 48% is consistent with the problem context. Given that the atom has survived the first 50 minutes, we apply the memoryless property of exponential decay, which states that the future decay probability is independent of the past. The decay constant (lambda) was calculated based on the initial decay probability of 32% over 100 minutes, leading to a consistent survival probability of approximately 52% over the next 150 minutes. This aligns with the expected behavior of radioactive decay, confirming that the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes after surviving 50 minutes is indeed reasonable and accurate. However, it is important to note that this conclusion relies on the assumption that the decay process follows an exponential model without external influences, which may not always be the case in real-world scenarios. Therefore, while the calculation is mathematically sound, one should be cautious about the assumptions made regarding the decay process.; answer - The calculated conditional decay probability is consistent with the problem context and reasonable given the decay constant and elapsed time.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 6 output: thinking - The calculated conditional decay probability after 50 minutes of survival is approximately 48%.
