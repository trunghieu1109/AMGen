Question: Example(question='We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.\nSo far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? ', choice1='52%', choice2='48%', choice3='44%', choice4='40%', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_6_73
proposed answer: The calculated conditional decay probability of approximately 99.92% indicates that the atom has a very high likelihood of decaying in the next 150 minutes after having survived the first 50 minutes. However, the provided multiple-choice options (52%, 48%, 44%, 40%) are significantly lower than this value. This discrepancy suggests that the options may not accurately reflect the nature of exponential decay or the context of the question. Since none of the options align with the calculated probability, I conclude that the correct answer is not among the choices provided.

Answer:None of the provided options are correct.
Extracted answer: None of the provided options are correct.
Correct answer: 3

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_6_73
proposed answer: The calculated conditional decay probability after 50 minutes of survival is approximately 48%. This value is derived from the memoryless property of exponential decay, which states that the probability of decay in the future is independent of the time already survived. When comparing this calculated probability with the provided options (52%, 48%, 44%, 40%), the closest match is 48%. This option not only aligns perfectly with the calculated probability but also falls within the Â±0.5% tolerance range specified in the task. Therefore, the most accurate answer among the available options is option B, which corresponds to 48%.
