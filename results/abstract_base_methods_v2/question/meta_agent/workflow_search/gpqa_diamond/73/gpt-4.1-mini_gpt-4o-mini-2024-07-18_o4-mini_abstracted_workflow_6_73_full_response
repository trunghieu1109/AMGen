We know that the decay probability is 32% (or 0.32) within 100 minutes. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 0.32 = 1 - e^(-lambda * 100). Rearranging gives us e^(-lambda * 100) = 0.68. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides, we have -lambda * 100 = ln(0.68). Thus, lambda = -ln(0.68) / 100. This gives us the decay constant in terms of the natural logarithm of 0.68 divided by 100 minutes.; answer - lambda = -ln(0.68) / 100\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - To compute the decay constant lambda numerically, we use the formula derived in Sub-task 1: lambda = -ln(0.68) / 100.

Next, we verify this by calculating the decay probability at 100 minutes using the formula P(t) = 1 - e^(-lambda * t). Substituting t = 100 and lambda = 0.00385 gives us P(100) = 1 - e^(-0.385) = 0.32, which confirms our calculation is correct within ±1%.

Given that the atom has survived for 50 minutes, we want to find the probability that it will survive for an additional 150 minutes. The survival probability S(t) is given by S(t) = e^(-lambda * t). We already calculated lambda as approximately 0.00385. Thus, we compute S(150) = e^(-0.00385 * 150). This results in a survival probability of approximately 0.52, which corresponds to a 52% chance of survival over the next 150 minutes. Hence, the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes is 1 - S(150) = 1 - 0.52 = 0.48 or 48%.
