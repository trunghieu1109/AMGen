proposed answer: The calculated mass dimension of \kappa is -1, which indicates that the interaction becomes stronger at higher energies. In quantum field theory, for a theory to be renormalizable, coupling constants must have non-negative mass dimensions. Since \kappa has a negative mass dimension, the theory is not renormalizable. Therefore, the correct choice must reflect both the mass dimension of \kappa being -1 and the conclusion that the theory is not renormalizable. The only option that matches this conclusion is choice C, which states that the mass dimension \left[\kappa\right]_{M}=-1 and that the theory is not renormalizable.
