From Sub-task 1, we know that the fermion field \\psi has mass dimension 3/2, the operator \\sigma_{\\mu\\nu} is dimensionless (0), and the field strength tensor F^{\\mu\\nu} has mass dimension 2. Therefore, the mass dimension of the interaction term can be calculated as follows: \\bar{\\psi} has the same mass dimension as \\psi, which is 3/2. Thus, the total mass dimension is (3/2) + (0) + (3/2) + (2) = 3/2 + 3/2 + 2 = 3 + 2 = 5. However, since we are considering the interaction term as a whole in the Lagrangian, we need to remember that the Lagrangian density itself has mass dimension 4. Hence, we set the total mass dimension of the interaction term equal to 4, which leads us to conclude that the mass dimension of the coupling constant \\kappa must compensate for the dimensions of the fields and operators to yield a total of 4. This confirms that the mass dimension of the interaction term \\bar{\\psi} \\sigma_{\\mu\\nu} \\psi F^{\\mu\\nu} is indeed 4, which is consistent with the dimensional analysis of the Lagrangian.
