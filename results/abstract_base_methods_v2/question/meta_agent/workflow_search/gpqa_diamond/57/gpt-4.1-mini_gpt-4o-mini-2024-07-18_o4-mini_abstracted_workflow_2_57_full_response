One of the key features of Superstring Theory is that it is formulated in a way that is inherently free from the divergences that plague other quantum field theories, particularly at high energies. This is largely due to its higher-dimensional nature and the way it incorporates quantum gravity. As a result, Superstring Theory does not require regularization in the same way that Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) or Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) do, since it does not produce the same types of infinities that necessitate such techniques.

It involves calculations of scattering amplitudes and loop diagrams, which can lead to divergences, particularly at high energies. These divergences arise from virtual particles in loop diagrams, which contribute to the integrals that can become infinite. Therefore, QED requires regularization techniques, such as dimensional regularization or cutoff regularization, to handle these infinities and yield finite, physically meaningful predictions.

At high energies, QCD exhibits asymptotic freedom, meaning that quarks and gluons interact more weakly as they come closer together. However, at low energies, the coupling becomes strong, leading to confinement and the formation of hadrons. The calculations in QCD often involve loop integrals that diverge, especially at high energies, necessitating the use of regularization techniques. These techniques help manage the infinities that arise in perturbative expansions, which are crucial for making predictions in high-energy particle physics.
