            "You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function \u2013 G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control\u2019s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control\u2019s resistance; 0% \u2012 all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?\n",

        "response": "After analyzing the resistance patterns of the mutants, it is evident that G2 is a transcription factor since its knockout leads to a complete loss of resistance (0% in g2 and the double mutants g1g2 and g2g3). This indicates its critical role in the resistance pathway. G1 shows some level of resistance even when G3 is knocked out, suggesting that G1 is epistatic towards G3, meaning that G1 can mask the effects of G3's knockout. The resistance levels indicate that G1 and G3 exhibit redundancy, as G1 can compensate for the loss of G3 to some extent. However, G1's presence significantly masks the effect of G3 in the double mutant g1g3, further supporting the idea of epistasis. Therefore, the most appropriate conclusion from the options provided is that G2 is a transcription factor, while G1 is epistatic towards G3, and they show redundancy in their functions. This aligns with choice 4, which states that 'G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.'

This indicates that g1 contributes positively to resistance, as it retains a significant level of resistance compared to the control. In contrast, g2 completely abolishes resistance, suggesting it is crucial for resistance, likely acting as a transcription factor. g3 shows some level of resistance, but not as high as g1, indicating it may also play a role but is not as critical as g1. Therefore, g2 is likely essential for resistance, while g1 and g3 may have some redundancy or interaction. Overall, g2's knockout leads to complete loss of resistance, highlighting its importance.; answer - G2 is essential for resistance, g1 contributes positively, and g3 has a lesser role.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - Analyzing the resistance data of the double mutants g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3 compared to the wild-type control and the single mutants shows significant interactions between the genes. The resistance levels are as follows: g1g2 has 0% resistance, g1g3 has 10% resistance, and g2g3 has 0% resistance. The g1g2 double mutant shows no resistance, indicating that the knockout of G2, which is crucial for resistance, completely negates any contribution from G1. The g1g3 mutant retains some resistance (10%), suggesting that G1 is still providing some level of resistance even when G3 is knocked out. The g2g3 mutant also shows no resistance, confirming that G2 is essential and that G3 does not compensate for its loss. This indicates that G2 is likely a transcription factor that is critical for the resistance pathway, while G1 and G3 may have some redundancy or interaction, but G1 is more dominant in providing resistance when G2 is present. Therefore, the interactions suggest that G2 is essential for resistance, and G1 acts upstream of G3, showing that G1 is epistatic to G3 in the presence of G2.; answer - G2 is essential for resistance, G1 is epistatic towards G3, and G1 and G3 show redundancy.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - Based on the resistance patterns observed in the single and double mutants, G2 is the gene that causes a complete loss of resistance when knocked out, as seen in the g2 mutant which has 0% resistance. Additionally, the double mutants g1g2 and g2g3 also show 0% resistance, confirming that G2 is essential for resistance. The fact that G1 retains some resistance even when G3 is knocked out (g1g3 has 10% resistance) suggests that G1 is not as critical as G2. Furthermore, G1 is epistatic to G3, meaning that G1's presence can influence the resistance level even when G3 is knocked out. This indicates that G1 acts downstream of G2. Therefore, G2 is likely a transcription factor acting upstream, as its knockout leads to the complete loss of resistance, highlighting its crucial role in the resistance pathway.; answer - G2 is a transcription factor.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - The evaluation of the genetic interactions between G1 and G3 based on resistance levels in single and double mutants indicates that G1 is epistatic towards G3. The single mutant g1 shows a resistance level of 75%, while g3 shows 50%. In the double mutant g1g3, the resistance drops significantly to 10%, suggesting that G1's presence masks the effects of G3, which is characteristic of epistasis. Additionally, since both g1g2 and g2g3 mutants show 0% resistance, it reinforces the idea that G2 is critical for resistance and that G1 and G3 do not fully compensate for each other. This indicates that G1 is dominant in its effect on resistance, while G3 does not provide additional benefits when G1 is present, suggesting redundancy in their functions. Therefore, the conclusion is that G1 is epistatic towards G3, and they exhibit redundancy in their roles in resistance to anthracnose. However, it is important to note that this analysis may not account for all possible interactions and the complexity of gene regulation, which could involve additional factors not considered in this evaluation.; answer - G1 is epistatic towards G3, and they show redundancy in their functions.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - After analyzing the resistance patterns of the mutants, it is evident that G2 is a transcription factor since its knockout leads to a complete loss of resistance (0% in g2 and the double mutants g1g2 and g2g3).

The g1g2 and g2g3 mutants show a complete loss of resistance, indicating that G2 is essential for resistance and suggests that it may be epistatic to G1. The g1g3 mutant shows a slight resistance of 10%, which implies that G1 still contributes to resistance even in the absence of G2, but not as effectively when G3 is involved. This suggests that G1 and G3 may exhibit redundancy in their function, but G2 is critical and likely acts upstream. Overall, these results indicate that G2 is a transcription factor that is epistatic over G1 and G3, while G1 and G3 may show some redundancy in their functions. Therefore, the combined gene effects suggest that G2 is the key regulator of resistance to anthracnose, with G1 and G3 contributing to resistance but not independently sufficient.; answer - G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - The analysis of the resistance patterns indicates that G2 is the gene whose knockout results in a complete loss of resistance (0% in g2 and g2g3 mutants).

Additionally, the double mutants g1g2 and g2g3 both show 0% resistance, reinforcing the idea that G2 is epistatic over G1 and G3, meaning that the presence of G2 is necessary for any resistance to be expressed. The fact that G1 and G3 still show some level of resistance when G2 is present indicates that they may have redundant functions, but without G2, they cannot confer resistance.

This suggests that G1 and G3 can partially compensate for each other, which is characteristic of redundancy. However, G1 appears to be more effective than G3, as the loss of G1 leads to a more significant drop in resistance than the loss of G3. Therefore, G1 is likely epistatic towards G3, meaning that the presence of G1 can mask the effect of G3.
