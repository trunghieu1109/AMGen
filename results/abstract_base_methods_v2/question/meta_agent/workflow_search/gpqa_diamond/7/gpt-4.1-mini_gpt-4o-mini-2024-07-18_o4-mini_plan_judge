Question: Example(question="You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control’s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control’s resistance; 0% ‒ all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?\n", choice1='G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3', choice2='G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1', choice3='G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1', choice4='G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: After analyzing the resistance patterns of the mutants, it is evident that G2 is a transcription factor since its knockout leads to a complete loss of resistance (0% in g2 and the double mutants g1g2 and g2g3). This indicates its critical role in the resistance pathway. G1 shows some level of resistance even when G3 is knocked out, suggesting that G1 is epistatic towards G3, meaning that G1 can mask the effects of G3's knockout. The resistance levels indicate that G1 and G3 exhibit redundancy, as G1 can compensate for the loss of G3 to some extent. However, G1's presence significantly masks the effect of G3 in the double mutant g1g3, further supporting the idea of epistasis. Therefore, the most appropriate conclusion from the options provided is that G2 is a transcription factor, while G1 is epistatic towards G3, and they show redundancy in their functions. This aligns with choice 4, which states that 'G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.' Although the term 'pleiotropy' may not be the most accurate descriptor, the choice encompasses the essential findings regarding G2's role and G1's interaction with G3.

proposed answer: Upon analyzing the experimental results, G2 is clearly identified as a transcription factor since the g2 mutant shows complete loss of resistance to anthracnose (0% resistance). This indicates that G2 is crucial for the resistance mechanism. The resistance levels of g1 (75%) and g3 (50%) suggest that G1 and G3 can compensate for each other to some extent, indicating redundancy. However, the fact that the double mutants g1g3 (10% resistance), g1g2 (0% resistance), and g2g3 (0% resistance) show no additional resistance suggests that G1 is epistatic to G3, meaning G1's presence is necessary for any resistance when G3 is also present. Therefore, the best fitting conclusion is that G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3. This aligns perfectly with choice 1.
