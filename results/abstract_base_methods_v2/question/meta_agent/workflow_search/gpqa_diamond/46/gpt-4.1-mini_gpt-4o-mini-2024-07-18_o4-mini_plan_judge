Iteration: abstracted_workflow_5_46
proposed answer: The compound C9H11NO2 is best identified as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate based on the analysis of the provided spectral data. The IR spectrum shows medium to strong intensity bands at 3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1, which are indicative of N-H stretching, suggesting the presence of an amine or amide group. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 indicates a carbonyl group, which is consistent with the presence of an ester or amide. The 1H NMR data reveals a triplet at 1.20 ppm (3H) corresponding to a methyl group, a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H) likely corresponding to an amine or amide proton, and a quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) indicating a methylene group in an ethyl group. Additionally, the aromatic protons are observed at 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), indicating a disubstituted benzene ring. Among the four options provided, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate fits the molecular formula C9H11NO2 and matches the spectral data closely, while the other options do not align as well with the identified functional groups or the molecular formula constraints. Therefore, the correct choice is D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.
