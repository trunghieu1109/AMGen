This can be rewritten as \\( \\rho = \\frac{1}{2} I \\), where \\( I \\) is the identity matrix. In the Bloch sphere representation, a density matrix can be expressed as \\( \\rho = \\frac{1}{2} (I + r \\cdot \\sigma) \\), where \\( r \\) is the Bloch vector and \\( \\sigma \\) are the Pauli matrices. Since the density matrix represents a completely mixed state (equal probabilities for |0\u27e9 and |1\u27e9), the Bloch vector \\( r \\) is (0, 0, 0), indicating that it is at the center of the Bloch sphere. Therefore, the correct answer is r=(0,0,0).; answer - r=(0,0,0)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - The given density matrix is \\( \\rho = \\frac{1}{2} (|0\\rangle \\langle 0| + |1\\rangle \\langle 1|) \\). This represents a completely mixed state, which can be expressed in the form \\( \\rho = \\frac{1}{2} (I + r \\cdot \\sigma) \\), where \\( r \\) is the Bloch vector and \\( \\sigma \\) are the Pauli matrices. Since this density matrix does not have any off-diagonal terms, it indicates that it is at the center of the Bloch sphere, leading to the conclusion that the Bloch vector \\( r \\) is (0, 0, 0). Therefore, the correct answer is r=(0,0,0).; answer - r=(0,0,0)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - The calculated Bloch vector r = (0, 0, 0) represents the center of the Bloch sphere. In the context of qubit state space, this point corresponds to a completely mixed state, where the probabilities of measuring the qubit in the |0\u27e9 or |1\u27e9 states are equal (50% each). Geometrically, this means that the qubit is in a state of maximum uncertainty, and thus it does not favor either of the basis states. Therefore, the coordinates of the Bloch vector indicate that it is located at the origin of the Bloch sphere, which is r=(0,0,0).; answer - r=(0,0,0)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - The calculated Bloch vector r = (0, 0, 0) represents the center of the Bloch sphere, which corresponds to a completely mixed state. This indicates that the qubit has equal probabilities of being measured in the |0\u27e9 or |1\u27e9 states, reflecting maximum uncertainty.
