For small values of m, we can take m = 1 (assuming m can take values like -1, 0, 1). Therefore, ⟨H⟩ = -mμ_BB = -1 * (5.79 x 10^-5 eV/T) * (1 T) = -5.79 x 10^-5 eV. This value is significantly smaller than the transition energy ΔE we calculated earlier (≈ 2.55 eV).

The energy shift due to the magnetic field is given by ΔE_Z = -m μ_B B, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton (approximately 9.274 x 10^-24 J/T). For small m values (e.g., m = 0, ±1), we can calculate the energy shift for m = 1 (as a representative case). Substituting B = 1 T and m = 1 into the formula gives us ⟨H⟩ = -1 * (9.274 x 10^-24 J/T) * (1 T) = -9.274 x 10^-24 J. To compare this with the transition energy ΔE, we need to convert ⟨H⟩ to eV: ⟨H⟩ = -9.274 x 10^-24 J / (1.602 x 10^-19 J/eV) ≈ -5.79 x 10^-5 eV, which is much smaller than ΔE ≈ 2.55 eV.
