        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - To calculate the transition energy \u0394E of the Hydrogen atom corresponding to the given wavelength \u03bb = 0.4861 \u03bcm, we can use the photon energy formula, which is given by E = hc/\u03bb, where h is Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 J\u00b7s) and c is the speed of light (3.00 x 10^8 m/s). First, we need to convert the wavelength from micrometers to meters: \u03bb = 0.4861 \u03bcm = 0.4861 x 10^-6 m. Now we can substitute the values into the formula: E = (6.626 x 10^-34 J\u00b7s)(3.00 x 10^8 m/s) / (0.4861 x 10^-6 m). Calculating this gives us the transition energy \u0394E in joules, which can then be converted to electronvolts (1 eV = 1.602 x 10^-19 J) if needed. After performing the calculation, we find that \u0394E is approximately 2.55 eV.; answer - \u0394E \u2248 2.55 eV\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - To determine the paramagnetic coupling term \u27e8H\u27e9 for the Hydrogen atom in a magnetic field B = 1 T with small orbital magnetic quantum number m, we can use the formula for the Zeeman effect energy shift, which is given by \u0394E_Z = -\frac{m \times e \times B}{2m_e}, where e is the elementary charge and m_e is the electron mass. For small values of m (like m = -1, 0, +1), we can calculate the energy shifts due to the magnetic field. For example, for m = 1, the energy shift would be proportional to the magnetic field and the quantum number. The values of e and m_e are known constants. After substituting the known values, we find that the paramagnetic coupling term \u27e8H\u27e9 is on the order of magnitude of a few micro-electronvolts (\u03bceV) for B = 1 T. This is significantly smaller than the transition energy \u0394E calculated previously (\u2248 2.55 eV), indicating that the paramagnetic coupling term is much less than the transition energy. Therefore, we conclude that \u27e8H\u27e9 << \u0394E.; answer - \u27e8H\u27e9 << \u0394E\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - The paramagnetic coupling term \u27e8H\u27e9 for the Hydrogen atom in a magnetic field of 1 T is on the order of a few micro-electronvolts (\u03bceV), while the transition energy \u0394E calculated from the wavelength of 0.4861 \u03bcm is approximately 2.55 eV.
