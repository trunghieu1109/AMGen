proposed answer: The paramagnetic coupling term ⟨H⟩ for the Hydrogen atom in a magnetic field of 1 T is estimated to be on the order of a few micro-electronvolts (μeV), while the transition energy ΔE derived from the wavelength of 0.4861 μm is approximately 2.55 eV. Since 1 eV is equivalent to 1,000,000 μeV, it is clear that ΔE is significantly larger than ⟨H⟩. This indicates that ⟨H⟩ is much less than ΔE, leading us to conclude that ⟨H⟩ << ΔE. Therefore, the correct choice from the options provided is choice 1: ⟨H⟩ << ΔE.
