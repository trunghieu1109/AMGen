proposed answer: To determine which exoplanet has the highest density, we need to analyze the densities of the four options provided. Option a) is an Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet, which gives it a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm^3, the same as Earth's density. Option b) is a planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm^3, which is equal to Earth's density. Option c) is a planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth; due to its increased volume, its density would be less than 5.5 g/cm^3. Option d) is a planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth, which would lead to a higher density than 5.5 g/cm^3 because it occupies less volume relative to its mass. Therefore, while options a) and b) both have a density of 5.5 g/cm^3, option d) is likely to have a density greater than that. After careful consideration, option d) is the one with the highest density among the choices provided. Hence, the final answer is d).
