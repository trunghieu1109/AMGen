proposed answer: The major isomer of product 3 is determined by the Diels-Alder reaction between product 2 and cyclopentadiene, which is known for its stereospecificity. The stereochemical configuration of the major isomer reflects the most stable arrangement of substituents during the reaction. After analyzing the provided options, the structure that corresponds to the correct stereochemical outcome is 'dimethyl (1R,4S,4aS,4bR,5R,8S,8aS,8bR,10R,11R)-1,4,4a,4b,5,8,8a,8b-octahydro-1,4-ethano-5,8-methanobiphenylene-10,11-dicarboxylate', which is option 1. This conclusion is supported by the consensus among multiple analyses that confirm this structure as the major isomer based on the reaction pathway and stereochemical considerations.

proposed answer: After analyzing the stereochemical configurations of the provided options, it is clear that the major isomer of product 3 is expected to be the endo product due to the Dielsâ€“Alder reaction mechanism. The endo product typically has substituents oriented in a way that minimizes steric hindrance and maximizes favorable interactions. Among the choices, option B has the correct stereochemical descriptors that align with the expected endo orientation, particularly with the S configuration at the 5 position, which is crucial for the stability of the endo product. The other options either present different stereochemical arrangements or configurations that do not favor the endo approach. Therefore, choice B is the most likely candidate for the major isomer of product 3.
