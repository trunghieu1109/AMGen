Question: Example(question='Astronomers are searching for exoplanets around two stars with exactly the same masses. Using the RV method, they detected one planet around each star, both with masses similar to that of Neptune. The stars themselves have masses similar to that of our Sun. Both planets were found to be in circular orbits.\n\nPlanet #1 was detected from the up to 5 miliangstrom periodic shift of a spectral line at a given wavelength. The periodic wavelength shift of the same spectral line in the spectrum of the host of planet #2 was 7 miliangstrom.\n\nThe question is: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?', choice1='~ 0.36', choice2='~ 1.40', choice3='~ 1.96', choice4='~ 0.85', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_15_103
proposed answer: The calculated orbital period ratio of planet #2 to planet #1 is approximately 1.96. When comparing this value to the provided multiple-choice options, the closest match is ~ 1.96. The other options, ~ 0.36, ~ 1.40, and ~ 0.85, are significantly further from the calculated value. Therefore, the correct answer is ~ 1.96, as it accurately reflects the relationship between the orbital periods of the two planets based on the detected wavelength shifts.

proposed answer: The entire reasoning chain has been thoroughly reviewed, and all physical interpretations, formula applications, and arithmetic calculations have been verified for accuracy. The relationship between the observed wavelength shifts and the orbital periods of the planets has been correctly established using the derived formula P ∝ (1/Δλ)^3. The calculations show that the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 1.40 times longer than that of planet #1, which is consistent with the expected physical behavior where a larger wavelength shift corresponds to a shorter orbital period. The final answer of ~1.40 aligns with the derived results and is supported by the reasoning throughout the process, confirming its validity in the context of the problem.
