Question: Example(question='Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements, reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons, and a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K. The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. Calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.', choice1='29', choice2='25', choice3='35', choice4='31', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_139
proposed answer: The cumulative atomic masses calculated in Sub-task 7 were 1.008 g/mol for Hydrogen (lightest) and 12.011 g/mol for Carbon (heaviest), which sums up to 13.019 g/mol. However, this value does not match any of the provided multiple-choice options (29, 25, 35, 31). Therefore, I need to find the closest match among the options. Since 13.019 is significantly lower than all the provided choices, it indicates that the cumulative atomic masses calculated do not correspond to the numeric values provided in the options. Thus, I will select the answer that represents the lowest option available, which is 25, as it is the only plausible choice in context despite not matching the calculated cumulative atomic masses.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_139
proposed answer: The calculated cumulative atomic mass of the lightest and heaviest elements present in Substance X is 35.006 u, which rounds to 35. This matches one of the provided multiple-choice options. Therefore, the correct answer choice is 35.
