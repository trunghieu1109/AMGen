Question: Example(question='"Scientist aims to run quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) on some samples. He first wants to make a calibration curve so he took positive control with known copy numbers and run qPCR on serially diluted positive control three technical replicates. The efficiency of qPCR was 100%. The R2 was 1, and the slope was -3.3. His results were as follows:\nAt the concentration of 100000 copies per µl, ct of triplicate results were 33.9, 34.2, 34.5.\nAt the concentration of 10000 copies per µl, ct of triplicate results were 30.6, 30.9, 31.2.\nAt the concentration of 1000 copies per µl, ct of triplicate results were 27.3, 27.6, 27.9.\nAt the concentration of 100 copies per µl, ct of triplicate results were 24, 24.3, 24.6.\nAt the concentration of 10 copies per µl, ct of triplicate results were 20.7, 21, 21.3\nWhich of the following explains the discrepancies in his results?\n\n', choice1='Ct values are not in agreement with the amount of target nucleic acid in samples ', choice2='Ten-fold dilution is more than 3.3 cycles', choice3='The deviation is more than 0.3 between technical replicates', choice4='qPCR cannot be used for the quantification of nucleic acid in samples ', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: After analyzing the various perspectives on the discrepancies observed in the qPCR results, it is clear that the best explanation is that 'Ct values are not in agreement with the amount of target nucleic acid in samples'. This option highlights the fundamental issue that the observed Ct values do not align with the expected values based on the known copy numbers. While other options discuss technical aspects such as the expected cycle differences for dilutions or the variability between replicates, they do not address the core issue of the discrepancies in the context of the expected quantification. The fact that the Ct values deviate from what is anticipated based on the known concentrations suggests potential problems with the assay or sample handling, making this option the most comprehensive and relevant explanation for the discrepancies observed in the results.
