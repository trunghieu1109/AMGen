The hydroxyl group at the 4-position will react with TBDMSCl, forming a silyl ether. This reaction typically involves the nucleophilic attack of the oxygen atom of the hydroxyl group on the silicon atom of TBDMSCl, leading to the formation of a tert-butyldimethylsilyl ether.

This reaction serves to remove the tert-butyldimethylsilyl (TBDMS) protecting group that was introduced earlier in the synthetic pathway. The acidic conditions facilitate the cleavage of the silyl ether bond, regenerating the hydroxyl group at the 4-position.

This step is an acidic deprotection, where the tert-butyldimethylsilyl (TBDMS) protecting group is removed. In this reaction, the acidic conditions will protonate the oxygen atom of the TBDMS group, facilitating its cleavage and allowing the hydroxyl group to be reformed at the 4-position. The stereochemistry at the 2 and 3 positions remains unchanged, as the acidic deprotection does not involve any stereochemical alteration at those centers.
