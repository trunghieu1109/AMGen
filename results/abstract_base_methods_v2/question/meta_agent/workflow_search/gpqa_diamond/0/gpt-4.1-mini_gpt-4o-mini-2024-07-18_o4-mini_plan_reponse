For the two states with lifetimes of 10^-9 sec and 10^-8 sec, we can calculate the energy uncertainties. For the first state with a lifetime of 10^-9 sec, the energy uncertainty \u0394E1 is approximately \u0127/(2 * 10^-9 sec). For the second state with a lifetime of 10^-8 sec, the energy uncertainty \u0394E2 is approximately \u0127/(2 * 10^-8 sec). The energy difference that can be resolved must be greater than the larger of these two uncertainties. Since the lifetime of the second state is longer, it has a smaller energy uncertainty, and thus the energy difference that can be resolved must be greater than \u0394E2.

This means that the shorter the lifetime of a quantum state (\u0394t), the greater the uncertainty in its energy (\u0394E). In this case, we have two states with lifetimes of 10^-9 sec and 10^-8 sec. For the state with a lifetime of 10^-9 sec, the energy uncertainty can be calculated as \u0394E1 = \u0127 / (2 * 10^-9 sec), and for the state with a lifetime of 10^-8 sec, \u0394E2 = \u0127 / (2 * 10^-8 sec). Since \u0394E1 is larger than \u0394E2, the state with the shorter lifetime has a broader energy distribution. To clearly distinguish between the two energy levels, the energy difference (E2 - E1) must be greater than the larger of the two energy uncertainties.

To clearly distinguish between the two energy levels, the energy difference must be greater than the larger of the two energy uncertainties.
