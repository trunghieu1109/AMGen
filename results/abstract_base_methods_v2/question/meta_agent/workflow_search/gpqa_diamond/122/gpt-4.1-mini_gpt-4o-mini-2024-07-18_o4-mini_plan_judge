Question: Example(question='A supernova occurred in our Galaxy. Part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta part and the Galaxy are inertial frames of reference. From the reference frame of the ejecta, the center of the Galaxy is moving at 60 000 km/s (sixty thousand kilometers per second) towards it.\nWhat distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?\n\n(Note: Gravity can be ignored, and rotation and revolution of the Galaxy can be ignored.)', choice1='2 880 000 km.', choice2='3 000 000 km.', choice3='3 060 000 km.', choice4='2 940 000 km.', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_122
proposed answer: To determine the distance traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy frame, we use the formula: distance = velocity × time. The velocity of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy is 60,000 km/s. The time interval in the Galaxy frame corresponding to 50 seconds in the ejecta frame is approximately 51.02 seconds. Therefore, the distance traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy frame is calculated as follows: distance = 60,000 km/s × 51.02 s = 3,061,200 km. When comparing this calculated distance with the provided multiple-choice options (2,880,000 km, 3,000,000 km, 3,060,000 km, and 2,940,000 km), the closest option to our calculated distance of 3,061,200 km is 3,060,000 km. Hence, the correct answer choice is C).
