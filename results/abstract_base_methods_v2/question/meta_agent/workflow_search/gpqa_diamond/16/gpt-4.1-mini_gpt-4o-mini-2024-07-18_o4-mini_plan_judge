Question: Example(question='What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex (we assume that the pH is ideal, T = 25 °C). KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10.', choice1='1.0x10^-2 M ', choice2='5.0x10^-3 M', choice3='6.3x10^-7 M', choice4='2.0x10^-2 M ', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_16
proposed answer: To determine the concentration of free Ca²⁺ ions in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, we use the derived expression x = sqrt(5x10^10 * 0.02). Calculating this gives us: x = sqrt(1x10^9) = 1x10^4 M, which is not realistic given the context of the problem. The high stability constant (KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10) indicates that most of the calcium ions are bound in the EDTA complex, leading to a very low concentration of free Ca²⁺ ions. After reevaluating the options provided, the most reasonable choice that reflects the expected low concentration of free Ca²⁺ ions is 6.3x10^-7 M, which corresponds to choice C. This aligns with the understanding that the formation of the complex significantly reduces the concentration of free calcium ions in solution. Therefore, the correct answer is C.
