Question: Example(question="Compounds that have the same molecular formula but are different in their structural arrangement are known as isomers. Isomers have two types, constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but differ in their structures. In stereoisomers, molecules are connected in the same way, but their arrangements in space are different.\nWhich of the following organic moieties show optical isomerism?\n\n1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate\n2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n3. benzophenone\n4. dimethyl fumarate", choice1='2 and 3', choice2='1 and 2', choice3='3 and 4', choice4='1, 2 and 4', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_23_116
proposed answer: After analyzing the compounds for optical isomerism, it is clear that methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is the only compound that exhibits optical isomerism due to its chiral center. The other compounds either lack chiral centers or have symmetrical structures that do not allow for optical isomerism. The provided multiple-choice options include combinations of these compounds. The option '2 and 3' includes methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate but also includes benzophenone, which does not exhibit optical isomerism. The option '1 and 2' includes methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and is the best choice, even though we are uncertain about compound 1. Therefore, the correct choice that identifies the compound showing optical isomerism is '1 and 2'.

Answer:1 and 2

proposed answer: From the final decision on the confirmed optical activity classification of the compounds, we have: 1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate is 'possible' for optical isomerism, 2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is 'confirmed' to be optically active, 3. Benzophenone is 'not optically active', and 4. Dimethyl fumarate is also 'not optically active'. Therefore, the only compound that is confirmed to show optical isomerism is compound 2. Looking at the provided choices, the only option that includes compound 2 is choice 1, which states '2 and 3'. However, since compound 3 is not optically active, this choice is incorrect. The correct choice that matches the confirmed optically active compound (which is only compound 2) is not explicitly listed. Therefore, I will select the choice that includes compound 2 and does not include any incorrect compounds. The closest match is choice 2, which includes compound 1 and 2, where compound 2 is confirmed optically active. Thus, the answer is B.
