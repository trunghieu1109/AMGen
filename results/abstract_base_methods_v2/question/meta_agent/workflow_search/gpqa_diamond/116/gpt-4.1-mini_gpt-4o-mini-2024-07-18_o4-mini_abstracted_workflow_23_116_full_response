This phenomenon arises from the presence of chiral centers, which are typically carbon atoms bonded to four different substituents, leading to point chirality. Additionally, axial chirality can occur in compounds that have restricted rotation around a bond, such as in certain biphenyls or alkenes, where the spatial arrangement of substituents can create non-superimposable mirror images. For a compound to exhibit optical isomerism, it must lack an internal plane of symmetry and possess a configuration that allows for these distinct spatial arrangements.; answer - Optical isomerism is the property of a compound to exist in two non-superimposable mirror image forms, known as enantiomers, which arises from the presence of chiral centers or axial chirality. Chiral centers are typically carbon atoms bonded to four different groups, while axial chirality occurs in compounds with restricted rotation around a bond.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - To analyze the optical isomerism of the given compounds, we need to consider their structures in detail. For each compound: \n\n1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This compound has a biphenyl structure, which can exhibit axial chirality due to restricted rotation around the bond connecting the two phenyl rings. The presence of bulky nitro groups at the 6,6' positions can lead to different spatial arrangements, making this compound potentially optically active.\n\n2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: This compound has a chiral center at the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group. It has two enantiomers due to the presence of a carbon atom bonded to four different groups (the hydroxyl group, a methyl group, and two hydrogen atoms). Therefore, it shows optical isomerism.\n\n3. **Benzophenone**: This compound does not have any chiral centers or axial chirality. It has a symmetrical structure that allows for superimposable mirror images, thus it does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4. **Dimethyl fumarate**: This compound has a double bond between two carbon atoms (the fumarate part), which can lead to geometric isomerism (cis/trans) but does not have chiral centers. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nBased on this analysis, compounds 1 and 2 exhibit optical isomerism due to the presence of chiral centers or axial chirality, while compounds 3 and 4 do not. Thus, the answer is that compounds 1 and 2 show optical isomerism.; answer - 1 and 2\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate has a biphenyl structure that can exhibit axial chirality due to restricted rotation around the bond connecting the two phenyl rings. The presence of bulky nitro groups at the 6,6' positions creates steric hindrance, which restricts the rotation around the biphenyl bond. This restriction leads to the possibility of two non-superimposable mirror image forms, making the compound optically active. However, it is important to consider that if the compound exists as a racemic mixture, it would not exhibit optical activity despite having the potential for chirality. Therefore, while the compound can exhibit axial chirality, its actual optical activity would depend on the specific configuration and whether it is a racemic mixture or not.; answer - Yes, it exhibits axial chirality.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center at the carbon atom that is bonded to four different substituents: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH3), and two hydrogen atoms. This configuration confirms that it is a chiral center, allowing the compound to exist in two non-superimposable mirror image forms, known as enantiomers. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exhibits optical activity due to this point chirality. The analysis is accurate as it identifies the chiral center and confirms the compound's ability to show optical isomerism.; answer - Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and exhibits optical activity.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - Benzophenone does not exhibit optical isomerism because it lacks chiral centers. A chiral center is defined as a carbon atom bonded to four different substituents, and in benzophenone, the carbonyl carbon is bonded to two identical phenyl groups. This symmetry means that there are no non-superimposable mirror images, which is a requirement for optical isomerism. Additionally, there are no features such as axial chirality present in benzophenone that would allow for optical isomerism. Therefore, it does not have the necessary structural characteristics to be optically active.; answer - Benzophenone does not show optical isomerism.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 6 output: thinking - Dimethyl fumarate is a compound that contains a double bond between two carbon atoms, which can lead to geometric isomerism (cis/trans). However, for optical isomerism to occur, a compound must have chiral centers or exhibit axial chirality. In the case of dimethyl fumarate, it does not have any chiral centers because the two carbon atoms involved in the double bond are each bonded to two identical groups (methyl groups), which means it lacks chirality. Therefore, while it can exist in cis and trans forms, it does not exhibit optical isomerism as it does not have non-superimposable mirror images. Thus, dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism.; answer - Dimethyl fumarate does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 7 output: thinking - Based on the analyses of each compound: \n1.

Therefore, it is categorized as 'possible' for optical isomerism. \n2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and is confirmed to exhibit optical activity, so it is categorized as 'confirmed' for optical isomerism. \n3. Benzophenone lacks chiral centers and does not exhibit optical isomerism, so it is categorized as 'not optically active'. \n4.
