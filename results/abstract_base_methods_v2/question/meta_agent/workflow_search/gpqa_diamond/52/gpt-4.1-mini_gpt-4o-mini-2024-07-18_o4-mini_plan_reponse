        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The FTIR spectrum shows absorption peaks indicating the presence of an ester group. Esters typically show a strong absorption peak around 1735-1750 cm-1 due to the C=O stretching vibration. Additionally, esters may show C-O stretching vibrations in the region of 1000-1300 cm-1. The presence of these peaks confirms the existence of an ester functional group in the compound. Therefore, the FTIR data supports the identification of the compound as containing an ester group.; answer - The FTIR spectrum confirms the presence of an ester functional group.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - The 1H NMR spectrum shows a total of six signals, which can be categorized as follows: two signals correspond to aromatic protons, which is typical for di-substituted aromatic compounds where symmetry can lead to distinct signals for each set of protons. The two signals for vinyl protons indicate the presence of a double bond, with one signal appearing as a doublet and the other as a doublet of quartets, suggesting that the vinyl protons are in different environments due to substitution. Lastly, the presence of two signals corresponding to -CH3 groups indicates that there are two distinct methyl groups in the compound. The absence of -CH2 signals suggests that there are no methylene groups present, which is consistent with the structure of an aromatic compound with substituents. This analysis aligns with the expected structure of the compound, supporting the identification of the signals in the 1H NMR spectrum.; answer - The 1H NMR spectrum shows six signals: two for aromatic protons, two for vinyl protons (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two for -CH3 groups, with no -CH2 signals.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - The identified proton environments from the 1H NMR spectrum indicate that there are two aromatic protons, which is consistent with a di-substituted aromatic ring. The presence of two vinyl protons, one appearing as a doublet and the other as a doublet of quartets, suggests that these protons are adjacent to different substituents, likely due to the presence of an ester group. The two -CH3 signals indicate that there are two distinct methyl groups, which could be attached to the aromatic ring or the vinyl group. The absence of -CH2 signals suggests that there are no methylene groups in the compound. This analysis supports the idea that the compound is a di-substituted aromatic compound with an ester functional group, and the hydrogen counts align with the proposed chemical formulas. The total number of hydrogens (12) and the presence of the ester group suggest that the correct formula is C12H14O2, as it accounts for all the protons and the functional groups present.; answer - C12H14O2\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - The combined spectral data from FTIR and 1H NMR indicates the presence of an ester group and specific proton environments.

The presence of these characteristic peaks confirms that the compound contains an ester functional group, which is crucial for determining the overall structure and chemical formula of the compound.; answer - The FTIR spectrum confirms the presence of an ester functional group.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - The 1H NMR spectrum shows six distinct signals, categorized as follows: two signals for aromatic protons (2H each, totaling 4H), two signals for vinyl protons (one doublet and one doublet of quartets, totaling 2H), and two signals for methyl (-CH3) groups (3H each, totaling 6H). The absence of -CH2 signals indicates that there are no protons from methylene groups in the compound. Therefore, the total number of hydrogens observed from the integration values is 4H (aromatic) + 2H (vinyl) + 6H (methyl) = 12H. This aligns with the potential chemical formulas provided, particularly those with 12 hydrogens (C12H14O2 and C12H12O2).; answer - The total number of hydrogens observed from integration values is 12.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - The total number of hydrogens observed from the integration values is 12, as calculated from the 1H NMR spectrum data. The candidate molecular formulas are C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, and C12H14O2. Analyzing the hydrogen counts: C11H12O2 has 12 hydrogens, C11H14O2 has 14 hydrogens, C12H12O2 has 12 hydrogens, and C12H14O2 has 14 hydrogens. The total of 12 hydrogens matches with C11H12O2 and C12H12O2. Since the compound shows no -CH2 signals and has a total of 12 hydrogens, it is likely that the correct formula is either C11H12O2 or C12H12O2. However, the presence of two -CH3 groups and the structure of the compound suggest that C12H12O2 is more plausible due to the additional carbon that can accommodate the structure of the di-substituted aromatic ring with an ester group. Therefore, the total hydrogen count aligns with C12H12O2 as the most likely candidate.; answer - C12H12O2\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - The analysis of the carbon and oxygen counts in the candidate molecular formulas C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, and C12H14O2 shows that C12H12O2 is the most plausible candidate for the di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with an ester group. C12H12O2 has 12 carbons and 12 hydrogens, which aligns with the total hydrogen count observed in the 1H NMR spectrum. The presence of an ester group and the aromatic structure requires a sufficient number of carbons to maintain stability, which C12H12O2 provides. C11H12O2, while having the correct hydrogen count, lacks sufficient carbons to support the required structure. C11H14O2 and C12H14O2 both have too many hydrogens, which is inconsistent with the observed NMR data. Therefore, C12H12O2 is consistent with the spectral evidence and the structural requirements, making it the most likely candidate.; answer - C12H12O2\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - After analyzing the spectral data and considering the hydrogen and carbon counts from the molecular formulas, C12H12O2 emerges as the most plausible candidate.

The presence of an ester group and a di-substituted aromatic ring suggests that the structure must accommodate these features, which C12H12O2 does effectively. The other candidates either have too few carbons (C11H12O2) or too many hydrogens (C11H14O2 and C12H14O2), making them inconsistent with the observed spectral data.
