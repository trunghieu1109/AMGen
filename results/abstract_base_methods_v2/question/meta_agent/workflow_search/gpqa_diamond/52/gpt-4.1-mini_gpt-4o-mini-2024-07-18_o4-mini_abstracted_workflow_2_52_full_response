Esters typically show a strong absorption peak around 1735-1750 cm-1 due to the C=O stretching vibration. Additionally, there may be C-O stretching vibrations around 1000-1300 cm-1. The presence of these characteristic peaks confirms that the compound contains an ester functional group, which is crucial for determining the overall structure and chemical formula of the compound.; answer - The FTIR spectrum confirms the presence of an ester functional group.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - The 1H NMR spectrum shows six distinct signals, categorized as follows: two signals for aromatic protons (2H each, totaling 4H), two signals for vinyl protons (one doublet and one doublet of quartets, totaling 2H), and two signals for methyl (-CH3) groups (3H each, totaling 6H). The absence of -CH2 signals indicates that there are no protons from methylene groups in the compound. Therefore, the total number of hydrogens observed from the integration values is 4H (aromatic) + 2H (vinyl) + 6H (methyl) = 12H.

The candidate molecular formulas are C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, and C12H14O2.

The total of 12 hydrogens matches with C11H12O2 and C12H12O2. Since the compound shows no -CH2 signals and has a total of 12 hydrogens, it is likely that the correct formula is either C11H12O2 or C12H12O2. However, the presence of two -CH3 groups and the structure of the compound suggest that C12H12O2 is more plausible due to the additional carbon that can accommodate the structure of the di-substituted aromatic ring with an ester group.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with an ester group, which suggests a certain structure that must accommodate the carbon and oxygen counts.

The presence of an ester group and the aromatic ring indicates that the compound should have a reasonable number of carbons to maintain stability and structure. The oxygen counts are consistent across all formulas, with 2 oxygens in each. Given that the total hydrogen count from the NMR spectrum is 12, and considering the structural features, C12H12O2 is the most plausible candidate as it provides the necessary carbon framework for the di-substituted aromatic ring while maintaining the correct hydrogen and oxygen counts.
