Question: Example(question='You have prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The FTIR spectrum of this compound shows absorption peaks indicating the presence of an ester group. The 1H NMR spectrum shows six signals: two signals corresponding to aromatic-H, two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups. There are no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups. Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, or C12H14O2.', choice1='C12H14O2', choice2='C12H12O2', choice3='C11H14O2', choice4='C11H12O2', correct_index=4)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_52
proposed answer: The spectral data from FTIR indicates the presence of an ester group, which requires at least two oxygen atoms in the molecular formula. The 1H NMR spectrum shows six distinct signals: two for aromatic protons, two for vinyl protons (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two for methyl groups, with no signals for -CH2 groups. This suggests a total of 12 hydrogen atoms. Among the candidates, C12H14O2 has 12 carbons, 14 hydrogens, and 2 oxygens, which aligns with the spectral data and the deductions made from the proton environments. The absence of -CH2 signals and the presence of the ester group further support that C12H14O2 is the most likely molecular formula for the compound. Other candidates do not match the hydrogen count or the structural implications derived from the spectral data. Therefore, C12H14O2 is the correct answer based on the analysis of the spectral evidence and structural deductions.

proposed answer: After analyzing the spectral data, the 1H NMR spectrum shows a total of 12 hydrogen atoms, which aligns perfectly with the molecular formula C12H12O2. The presence of an ester group and a di-substituted aromatic ring further supports this choice, as C12H12O2 can accommodate these features. The other options either do not match the hydrogen count or have structural inconsistencies with the observed data. Therefore, C12H12O2 is the most plausible candidate based on the provided evidence.
