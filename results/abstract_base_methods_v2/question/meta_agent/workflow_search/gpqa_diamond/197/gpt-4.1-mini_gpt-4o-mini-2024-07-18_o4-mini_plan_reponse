We have the total cobalt concentration c(Co) = 10^-2 M and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. We can express the total cobalt concentration as: c(Co) = [Co(II)]_free + [Co(SCN)]+ + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3] + [Co(SCN)4]. Substituting the expressions for the complexes in terms of [Co(II)]_free and [SCN-] into this equation allows us to solve for [Co(II)]_free.

The stability constant for the dithiocyanato complex, Co(SCN)2, is \u03b22 = 40. The concentration of the dithiocyanato complex can be calculated using the formula: [Co(SCN)2] = \u03b22 * [Co(II)]_free * [SCN-]^2. Substituting the values, we have: [Co(SCN)2] = 40 * 0.002 M * (0.1 M)^2 = 40 * 0.002 * 0.01 = 0.0008 M.

The concentration of the dithiocyanato complex [Co(SCN)2] can be calculated using the formula: [Co(SCN)2] = \u03b22 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2.

Using the expressions for the concentrations of the complexes derived earlier: [Co(SCN)] = 0.9 * [Co^2+], [Co(SCN)2] = 0.4 * [Co^2+], [Co(SCN)3] = 0.063 * [Co^2+], and [Co(SCN)4] = 0.0016 * [Co^2+], we can substitute [Co^2+] into these equations.
