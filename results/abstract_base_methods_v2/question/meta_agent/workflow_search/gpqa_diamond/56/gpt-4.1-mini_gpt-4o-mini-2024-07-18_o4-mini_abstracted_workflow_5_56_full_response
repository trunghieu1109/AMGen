The incident electron energy is 50 MeV.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - To convert degrees to radians, we use the conversion factor π radians = 180 degrees. Therefore, to convert each phase shift from degrees to radians, we multiply the degree value by π/180. The conversions for the given phase shifts are as follows: δ₀ = 90° * (π/180) = π/2 radians, δ₁ = 67° * (π/180) = 67π/180 radians, δ₂ = 55° * (π/180) = 55π/180 radians, δ₃ = 30° * (π/180) = π/6 radians, and δ₄ = 13° * (π/180) = 13π/180 radians.
