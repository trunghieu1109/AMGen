Question: Example(question='There is a spin 1/2 particle with magnetic moment mu (= gamma*Sz), aligned with a magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction. Suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction; both fields have the same magnitude, B. The average of the z-component of the particleâ€™s moment starts oscillating. What is its oscillation frequency?', choice1='gamma*B/2', choice2='gamma*B', choice3='gamma*B/sqrt(2)', choice4='sqrt(2)*gamma*B', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_24_67
proposed answer: The oscillation frequency of the expectation value <mu_z>(t) is determined by the Hamiltonian for a spin-1/2 particle in a magnetic field along the +Y direction. The Hamiltonian is given by H = -gamma * B * Sz, which leads to precession of the spin state around the Y-axis. The frequency of this precession is directly proportional to the magnetic field strength, B, and the gyromagnetic ratio, gamma. Therefore, the oscillation frequency of <mu_z>(t) is gamma * B. This matches with option (B) from the choices provided, confirming that the correct answer is indeed gamma * B.
