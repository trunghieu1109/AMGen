Question: Example(question=" Consider a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass $m$ and maximum amplitude $A$ obeying Hook's law ($F=-kx$).

proposed answer: After evaluating the derived expression for the maximum speed v_max of the relativistic harmonic oscillator and comparing it with the provided multiple-choice options, it is clear that choice 2, which is $v_{max}=c\sqrt{1-\frac{1}{(1+\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$, accurately incorporates the necessary relativistic adjustments. This expression reflects the behavior of the oscillator as it approaches relativistic speeds, taking into account the potential energy at maximum amplitude and the effects of relativity. The other choices either do not account for these factors or do not align with the expected physical behavior of the system. Therefore, choice 2 is confirmed as the correct expression for the maximum velocity v_max of the relativistic harmonic oscillator.
