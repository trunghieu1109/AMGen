Question: Example(question='A textile dye containing an extensively conjugated pi-electrons emits light with energy of 2.3393 eV. What color of light is absorbed by the organic compound?', choice1='Blue', choice2='Yellow', choice3='Red', choice4='Violet', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_6_29
proposed answer: The energy of the emitted light is 2.3393 eV, which corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 530 nm, placing it in the green region of the visible spectrum. The color absorbed by the organic compound is the complementary color to green, which is red. Therefore, the correct answer among the provided options (Blue, Yellow, Red, Violet) is Red, corresponding to option C.

Answer:C
Extracted answer: C
