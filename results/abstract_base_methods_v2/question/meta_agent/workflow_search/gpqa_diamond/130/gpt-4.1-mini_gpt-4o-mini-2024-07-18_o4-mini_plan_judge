Question: Example(question='A dicarboxylic acid containing a cis-alkene was dehydrated to the corresponding anhydride. This anhydride, which has a single peak (7 ppm) in its 1H NMR spectrum and two peaks (137 ppm, 165 ppm) in its 13C spectrum, was reacted with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to yield two products (a major and a minor product). Both products have a molecular formula of C13H16O3.\n\nThe 2D NOESY NMR spectra of the major and minor products were taken. A cross-peak was present in the spectrum of the major product but absent (or very weak) in spectrum of the minor product.\n\nIn the spectrum of the major product, which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak (integrals are taken from the corresponding 1H NMR)?', choice1='A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm', choice2='A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm', choice3='A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm', choice4='A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_36_130
proposed answer: The presence of a cross-peak in the NOESY NMR spectrum of the major product indicates that the protons corresponding to these resonances are in close spatial proximity. Analyzing the provided options, the pair 'A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm' suggests a significant interaction due to the number of protons and the difference in chemical shifts. The 6H singlet indicates a symmetrical environment, likely from two equivalent methyl groups, while the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm suggests protons attached to a more electronegative atom, such as oxygen. This combination is likely to be spatially close, allowing for the observed cross-peak. The other options either do not provide suitable pairs in terms of proximity or involve different splitting patterns that do not align with the expected interactions. Therefore, the most plausible pair of resonances connected by the cross-peak in the major product is the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm, making option A the correct choice.

proposed answer: The final validation of the NOESY cross-peak assignment confirms that the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm are indeed the resonances connected by the cross-peak in the major product. This conclusion is supported by the analysis of the 1H NMR data, where the 6H singlet corresponds to two equivalent methyl groups, and the 2H singlet corresponds to protons adjacent to an electronegative atom or a carbonyl group. The presence of a cross-peak indicates that these protons are in close spatial proximity, which aligns with the expected structure of the major product. The minor product, lacking this correlation, further validates that the assignment is robust and consistent with the spectral data. Therefore, the selected assignment is confirmed as correct.
