Here, E_X = 8 GeV and m_X = 1.2 GeV. We assume that E_X represents the total energy of the meson resonance, which includes both rest mass energy and kinetic energy. Therefore, we can directly substitute these values into the formula: γ = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.6667. This indicates that the meson is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light, which is consistent with high-energy particle physics.; answer - 6.6667\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - To find the mean lifetime (τ) of the meson resonance X from its decay width (Γ_X = 320 MeV), we use the relation τ = ħ / Γ_X.

Now we can calculate τ: τ = (6.582 × 10^-16 eV·s) / (320 × 10^6 eV) = 2.060625 × 10^-24 s.
