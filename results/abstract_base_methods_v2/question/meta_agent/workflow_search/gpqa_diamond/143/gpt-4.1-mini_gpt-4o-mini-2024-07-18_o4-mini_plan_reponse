The production energy E_X is given as 8 GeV and the mass m_X is given as 1.2 GeV. Therefore, we can substitute these values into the formula: \u03b3 = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.6667. This value indicates how much the time and length are dilated due to relativistic effects.; answer - 6.6667\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - To determine the mean lifetime (\u03c4) of the meson resonance X from its decay width (\u0393_X), we use the relation \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393_X. The decay width \u0393_X is given as 320 MeV. We need to convert this energy into SI units to find \u03c4 in seconds. The reduced Planck constant \u0127 is approximately 1.055 x 10^-34 J\u00b7s. First, we convert 320 MeV to joules: 1 MeV = 1.602 x 10^-13 J, so 320 MeV = 320 * 1.602 x 10^-13 J = 5.1264 x 10^-11 J. Now we can calculate \u03c4: \u03c4 = (1.055 x 10^-34 J\u00b7s) / (5.1264 x 10^-11 J) = 2.058 x 10^-24 s.

From Sub-task 1, we found \u03b3 = 6.6667 and from Sub-task 2, we found \u03c4 = 2.058 x 10^-24 s. We need to calculate \u03b2 using the formula \u03b2 = sqrt(1 - 1/\u03b3^2). First, we calculate \u03b3^2 = (6.6667)^2 = 44.4444, then 1/\u03b3^2 = 1/44.4444 = 0.0225. Thus, 1 - 1/\u03b3^2 = 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775, and taking the square root gives us \u03b2 \u2248 0.9887. The speed of light (c) is approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s. Now we can compute L: L = \u03b3 * \u03b2 * c * \u03c4 = 6.6667 * 0.9887 * (3 x 10^8 m/s) * (2.058 x 10^-24 s).

Here, E_X = 8 GeV and m_X = 1.2 GeV. We assume that E_X represents the total energy of the meson resonance, which includes both rest mass energy and kinetic energy. Therefore, we can directly substitute these values into the formula: \u03b3 = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.6667. This indicates that the meson is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light, which is consistent with high-energy particle physics.; answer - 6.6667\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - To find the mean lifetime (\u03c4) of the meson resonance X from its decay width (\u0393_X = 320 MeV), we use the relation \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393_X. First, we need to convert the decay width from MeV to seconds. The reduced Planck constant (\u0127) is approximately 6.582 \u00d7 10^-16 eV\u00b7s. We convert \u0393_X from MeV to eV: 320 MeV = 320 \u00d7 10^6 eV. Now we can calculate \u03c4: \u03c4 = (6.582 \u00d7 10^-16 eV\u00b7s) / (320 \u00d7 10^6 eV) = 2.060625 \u00d7 10^-24 s.

We previously computed \u03b3 = 6.6667. First, we calculate 1/\u03b3\u00b2: 1/\u03b3\u00b2 = 1/(6.6667)\u00b2 = 1/44.4444 \u2248 0.0225. Then, we find 1 - 1/\u03b3\u00b2 = 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. Finally, we take the square root: \u03b2 = sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887. This means that the meson resonance X is moving at approximately 98.87% of the speed of light.; answer - 0.9887\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3b output: thinking - To compute the product c\u00b7\u03c4, we first need to use the mean lifetime \u03c4 that we calculated in the previous sub-task, which is approximately 2.060625 \u00d7 10^-24 seconds. The speed of light c is given as 3.0 \u00d7 10^8 m/s. We can calculate the product as follows: c\u00b7\u03c4 = (3.0 \u00d7 10^8 m/s) * (2.060625 \u00d7 10^-24 s). When we multiply these two values, we multiply the coefficients (3.0 * 2.060625) and add the exponents of 10 (8 + (-24)). This gives us: c\u00b7\u03c4 = 6.181875 \u00d7 10^-16 m. Therefore, the product c\u00b7\u03c4 is approximately 6.18 \u00d7 10^-16 meters.; answer - 6.181875 * 10^-16 m\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3c output: thinking - To calculate the mean decay distance L, we will follow the steps outlined in the sub-task. First, we have \u03b3 = 6.6667 and \u03b2 = 0.9887. We will multiply these two values: \u03b3 \u00d7 \u03b2 = 6.6667 \u00d7 0.9887 \u2248 6.6000. Next, we will multiply this result by c\u00b7\u03c4, which we previously calculated as approximately 6.181875 \u00d7 10^-16 m. Therefore, L = (6.6000) \u00d7 (6.181875 \u00d7 10^-16 m). Performing this multiplication gives us: L \u2248 4.07 \u00d7 10^-15 m. This value corresponds to one of the choices provided in the original question, specifically choice 3, which is 4.0655 \u00d7 10^-15 m.

The Lorentz factor \u03b3 was correctly calculated as \u03b3 = E/m, yielding approximately 6.6667. The velocity factor \u03b2 was also verified to be around 0.9887, which is consistent with the relativistic energy-momentum relationship. The mean lifetime \u03c4 was derived from the width \u0393 using \u03c4 = \u210f/\u0393, resulting in a value that leads to a reasonable distance when multiplied by c. The final result of L \u2248 4.0655 \u00d7 10^-15 m matches the expected order of magnitude for meson decay distances, confirming the physical plausibility of the calculations. Therefore, the mean decay distance is indeed approximately 4.0655 \u00d7 10^-15 m, which is consistent with the previous calculations and the expected behavior of mesons.; answer - 4.0655 * 10^-15 m\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3e output: thinking - The decay length L has been calculated as approximately 4.0655 \u00d7 10^-15 m. To validate this, we check the units: the decay length is derived from the product of the mean lifetime \u03c4 (in seconds) and the speed of light c (in meters per second), which results in a distance measured in meters. The order of magnitude for meson decay lengths typically ranges from 10^-15 to 10^-14 meters, making 4.0655 \u00d7 10^-15 m plausible. Given the production energy of 8 GeV and the mass of 1.2 GeV, the calculations align with expected relativistic effects, confirming that the derived decay length is consistent with physical expectations for mesons. Therefore, the numerical validation supports the calculated decay length as reasonable and consistent with known physics.; answer - 4.0655 * 10^-15 m\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - The validated mean decay distance L has been calculated as approximately 4.0655 \u00d7 10^-15 m.
