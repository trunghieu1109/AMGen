Iteration: abstracted_workflow_38_23
proposed answer: After analyzing the properties of the two liquids in mixture X, which are likely simple alkenes that decolorize bromine water and do not have conjugated double bonds, we can use the general formula for alkenes (C_nH_(2n)) to determine the total number of hydrogen atoms. Since the two liquids are equimolar, we can assume they have the same number of carbon atoms. The analysis suggests that the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids is 22, as this fits the criteria of being equimolar and having no conjugated double bonds. This conclusion is supported by the previous analyses and the properties of the resulting hydrocarbon Z. Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 22.

proposed answer: After thorough analysis and validation of the chemical properties and reactions involved, it is confirmed that mixture X consists of two butenes (C4H8). Each butene contributes 8 hydrogen atoms, leading to a total of 16 hydrogen atoms in mixture X (8 + 8 = 16). This aligns with the requirement that the compounds in mixture X decolorize bromine water and do not contain conjugated double bonds. The subsequent disproportionation reaction produces butane and cyclopentane in mixture Y, which do not decolorize bromine water. The hydrogenation of both mixtures yields cyclohexane (C6H12), which matches the specified hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28% and is a widely used solvent. Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is confirmed to be 16, corresponding to option C.
