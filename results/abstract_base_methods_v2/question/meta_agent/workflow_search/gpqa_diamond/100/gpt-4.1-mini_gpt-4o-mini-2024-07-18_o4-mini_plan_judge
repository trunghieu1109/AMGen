Question: Example(question='A student performed an acid-catalyzed reaction of 3-methylpyrrolidine with compound A, the final product of the reaction is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. Select the suitable reagent (A) and catalyst (B) for the reaction.\n3-methylpyrrolidine + A (B, Heat, solvent) ---> 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine', choice1='A = vinylcyclohexane, B = TsOH', choice2='A = cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, B = TsOH', choice3='A = vinylcyclohexane, B = Acetic acid', choice4='A = cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, B = Acetic acid', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_100
proposed answer: The reaction involves 3-methylpyrrolidine reacting with an electrophile to form an imine, which is then dehydrated to yield the final product. The structure of the final product indicates that compound A must be cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, as it can provide the necessary functionality to form the cyclohexylidene group. The catalyst B must be an acid that facilitates this reaction, and TsOH (p-toluenesulfonic acid) is a well-known acid catalyst that enhances the nucleophilicity of the amine and promotes the condensation reaction. Therefore, the correct combination of reagent A and catalyst B is A = cyclohexanecarbaldehyde and B = TsOH, which corresponds to choice 2.
