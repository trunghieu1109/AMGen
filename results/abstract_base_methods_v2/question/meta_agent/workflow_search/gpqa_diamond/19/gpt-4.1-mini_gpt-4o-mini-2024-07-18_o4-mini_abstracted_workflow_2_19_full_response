The first assumption states that the interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons. This implies that we can treat each nucleon independently when considering the effects of the interaction, which is a key aspect of the impulse approximation. It allows us to neglect correlations between nucleons that arise from their mutual interactions. \n\n2. The second assumption, that the nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon, suggests that the selected nucleon can be treated as if it is free from the influence of the other nucleons. This means that the nucleon can interact with the external current without being affected by the binding forces from the rest of the nucleus, which is essential for the impulse approximation to hold. \n\n3. The third assumption posits that the quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic. This simplifies the treatment of the nucleonâ€™s internal structure, allowing us to use non-relativistic quantum mechanics to describe the nucleon. This assumption is important because it ensures that the dynamics of the nucleon can be treated in a simpler framework, which is consistent with the impulse approximation. \n\n4. The fourth assumption states that the interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces. This is a direct implication of the impulse approximation, as it allows us to treat the nucleon as if it were free, thus simplifying the calculations significantly. \n\nIn summary, all four assumptions are crucial for the impulse approximation to be valid, as they allow us to treat nucleons as independent entities that are not influenced by the complex interactions present in a nucleus.
