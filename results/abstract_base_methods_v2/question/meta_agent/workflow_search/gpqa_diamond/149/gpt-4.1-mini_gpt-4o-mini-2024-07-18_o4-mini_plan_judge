KOH, Heat \n\n1H-NMR (ppm): 9.72 (t, 1H), 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H), 6.27 (bs, 2H), 3.66 (d, 2H). Identify the final product.', choice1='4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal', choice2='3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal', choice3='2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal', choice4='2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_9_149
proposed answer: After analyzing the reaction sequence involving NaNO2 + HCl, followed by hydrolysis with water and then treatment with aqueous KOH and heat, it is clear that the starting compound undergoes diazotization to form a diazonium salt, which is then hydrolyzed to yield a phenolic compound. The final step suggests dehydration, leading to a conjugated system. The NMR data supports the presence of aromatic protons and a conjugated double bond, which aligns with the structure of '2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal'. This compound contains the necessary functional groups and structural features resulting from the described transformations, making it the most suitable final product among the options provided.
