The formula for the interplanar spacing is d_hkl = 1 / |G_hkl|. Therefore, we need to compute |G_111| using the derived values of a* and the angles.

After performing the calculations, we find that the numerical value of d_111 is approximately 9.08 Angstrom, which corresponds to choice 3.; answer: 9.08 Angstrom\n<SEPERATOR>\nFinal Decision agent, selecting final numerical interplanar distance, thinking: After reviewing the calculations and the provided choices, the most consistent result for the interplanar distance d_111 is 9.08 Angstrom. This value was derived from multiple calculations that considered the interatomic distance and the angles of the rhombohedral crystal. The calculations showed that the derived formula for d_111, when applied correctly, yields this value. Additionally, it aligns with the majority of the answers provided by the debate agents, reinforcing its validity. Therefore, I conclude that 9.08 Angstrom is the correct interplanar distance for the (111) plane.; answer: 9.08 Angstrom\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent V0bn, comparing computed distance with options, thinking: The computed interplanar distance d_111 is 9.08 Angstrom, which directly matches one of the provided multiple-choice options.
