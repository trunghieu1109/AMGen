The carboxylic acid is at position 1.

The hydroxyl group (OH) and the dimethylamino group (N(CH3)2) are ortho to the carboxylic acid, which places them at positions 2 and 6, respectively. Finally, the methoxy group (OCH3) is para to the carboxylic acid, placing it at position 4.

The carboxylic acid is at position 1. The substituents are described as follows: The carbaldehyde (CHO) and the cyano group (CN) are both meta to the carboxylic acid, which means they are located at positions 3 and 5, respectively. The hydroxyl group (OH) and the dimethylamino group (N(CH3)2) are ortho to the carboxylic acid, which places them at positions 2 and 6, respectively. Finally, the methoxy group (OCH3) is para to the carboxylic acid, placing it at position 4.

Starting with the carboxylic acid (COOH) at position 1, the carbaldehyde (CHO) and cyano (CN) groups are both meta to it, which places them at positions 3 and 5, respectively. The hydroxyl (OH) and dimethylamino (N(CH3)2) groups are ortho to the carboxylic acid, thus they occupy positions 2 and 6. The methoxy group (OCH3) is para to the carboxylic acid, placing it at position 4.

The carbaldehyde (CHO) and cyano (CN) groups are both meta to the carboxylic acid, meaning they will be placed in positions 3 and 5, respectively. The hydroxyl (OH) and dimethylamino (N(CH3)2) groups are ortho to the carboxylic acid, so they will occupy positions 2 and 6.
