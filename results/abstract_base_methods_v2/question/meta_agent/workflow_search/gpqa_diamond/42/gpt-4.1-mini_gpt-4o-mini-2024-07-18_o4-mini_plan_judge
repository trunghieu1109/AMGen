Question: Example(question='A benzene ring has a carboxylic acid a carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another. Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino and para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group. The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile. What is the correct IUPAC name for this molecule?\n', choice1='5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid', choice2='3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid', choice3='2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid', choice4='2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_42
proposed answer: After analyzing the structure of the molecule and the positions of the functional groups, the IUPAC name constructed is '3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid'. This name accurately reflects the positions of the carboxylic acid (1), hydroxyl (2), dimethylamino (3), methoxy (4), cyano (5), and the carbaldehyde (6) groups on the benzene ring. The name follows IUPAC conventions for naming aromatic compounds with multiple substituents, where the substituents are listed in alphabetical order along with their locants. Comparing this constructed name with the provided multiple-choice options, it matches exactly with choice 2: '3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid'. Therefore, the correct answer is choice 2.
