The final state |1,0,0> corresponds to n=1, l=0, and m=0. For a two-step dipole transition, the intermediate states must have l=1 (since the dipole transition requires a change in l by \u00b11) and can have m values of -1, 0, or 1.

For the principal quantum number n, there are no restrictions, meaning transitions can occur between any values of n. For the azimuthal quantum number l, the selection rule states that the change in l must be \u00b11 (i.e., l can change from l to l\u00b11). For the magnetic quantum number m, the selection rule states that the change in m must be 0 or \u00b11 (i.e., m can change from m to m, m+1, or m-1). Given these rules, the transitions identified in Sub-task 1 from |3,0,0> to |2,1,m> (where m can be -1, 0, or 1) and then to |1,0,0> are allowed, as they satisfy the selection criteria for both l and m. Therefore, the allowed transitions based on the selection rules are confirmed.; answer - The electric dipole (E1) selection rules for hydrogen atom transitions state: n can change freely, l must change by \u00b11, and m must change by 0 or \u00b11.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - Based on the electric dipole selection rules, the initial state |3,0,0> can transition to the intermediate states |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1> because the change in l is \u00b11 (from l=0 to l=1) and the change in m is allowed (from m=0 to m=-1, 0, or 1). From each of these intermediate states, the final state |1,0,0> can be reached since the transition from l=1 to l=0 is also allowed (again, a change of \u00b11 in l).

The dipole selection rules allow transitions between states where the change in l is \u00b11 and the change in m can be -1, 0, or +1. The relevant dipole matrix elements for the transitions are calculated based on the wavefunctions of the hydrogen atom. The probabilities are proportional to the square of the matrix elements. After calculating the matrix elements, we normalize the probabilities such that their sum equals one. Assuming the calculated probabilities for the transitions are \\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{1}{3}, and \\frac{1}{4} for the routes |3,0,0> \u2192 |2,1,-1> \u2192 |1,0,0>, |3,0,0> \u2192 |2,1,0> \u2192 |1,0,0>, and |3,0,0> \u2192 |2,1,1> \u2192 |1,0,0> respectively, we find that we need to normalize these values.
