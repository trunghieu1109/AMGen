Question: Example(question='In a specific region of the sky, astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?', choice1='~ r^2', choice2='~ r^4', choice3='~ r^3', choice4='~ r^5', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: The analysis shows that the number of stars N varies with distance r as N ∝ r^5. When we take the derivative of N with respect to r, we find that dN/dr = 5k * r^4. This indicates that the rate of change of the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to r^4. Therefore, when comparing this result with the provided options, the correct choice that represents how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance is ~ r^4.

proposed answer: The derived functional form of the number of stars per unit distance interval is dN/dr ∝ r^5. This indicates that the number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance. When comparing this with the provided multiple-choice options, the only option that matches this relationship is ~ r^5. The other options (~ r^2, ~ r^4, ~ r^3) do not correspond to the derived dependence, confirming that the correct choice is indeed ~ r^5.
