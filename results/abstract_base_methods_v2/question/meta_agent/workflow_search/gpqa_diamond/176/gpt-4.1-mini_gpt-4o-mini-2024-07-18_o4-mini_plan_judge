Question: Example(question='Astronomers are interested in the luminosities of two stars. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2. The mass of Star_1 is also larger by the same factor (1.5 times). Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same. Astronomers also calculated the radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:', choice1='~2.25', choice2='~2.35', choice3='~2.32', choice4='~2.23\n', correct_index=4)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_15_176
proposed answer: The computed luminosity ratio for Star_1 compared to Star_2 is approximately 2.25. Among the given multiple-choice options, the closest value to 2.25 is ~2.23. Although 2.25 is not explicitly listed, ~2.23 is the nearest approximation. Therefore, it is reasonable to select ~2.23 as the correct answer based on the proximity to the computed value.

Answer:~2.23
Extracted answer: ~2.23
Correct answer: 4

proposed answer: The index of the matching choice identified in Subtask 5 is 2. In the context of multiple-choice questions, the index 1 corresponds to choice A, index 2 corresponds to choice B, index 3 corresponds to choice C, and index 4 corresponds to choice D. Therefore, since the matching choice index is 2, the letter representation for this index is B.
