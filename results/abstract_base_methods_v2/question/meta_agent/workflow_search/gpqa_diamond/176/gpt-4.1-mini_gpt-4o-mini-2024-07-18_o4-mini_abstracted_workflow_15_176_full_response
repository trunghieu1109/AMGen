The law is given by the formula λ_max * T = b, where b is Wien\'s displacement constant (approximately 2.898 x 10^-3 m*K). Since both stars have the same peak wavelength, they must also have the same temperature. Therefore, we can conclude that the temperature of both stars is the same, but we cannot determine the exact temperature without knowing the peak wavelength.

This reasoning confirms that Star_1 and Star_2 have the same temperature.; answer - The temperatures of Star_1 and Star_2 are equal.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - To calculate the luminosity of each star using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, we use the formula L = 4πR²σT⁴, where L is the luminosity, R is the radius, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature. Since we established that the temperatures of Star_1 and Star_2 are equal, we can denote the temperature as T. Let R2 be the radius of Star_2, then the radius of Star_1 is R1 = 1.5 * R2.

Since we established that the temperatures of Star_1 and Star_2 are equal, we can denote the temperature as T. Let R2 be the radius of Star_2, then the radius of Star_1 is R1 = 1.5 * R2. The luminosity of Star_1 is L1 = 4π(1.5R2)²σT⁴ = 4π(2.25R2²)σT⁴ = 2.25 * (4πR2²σT⁴) = 2.25 * L2, where L2 is the luminosity of Star_2.

Since we established that the temperatures of Star_1 and Star_2 are equal, we can denote the temperature as T. Let R2 be the radius of Star_2, then the radius of Star_1 is R1 = 1.5 * R2. The luminosity of Star_1 is L1 = 4π(1.5R2)²σT⁴ = 4π(2.25R2²)σT⁴ = 2.25 * (4πR2²σT⁴) = 2.25 * L2, where L2 is the luminosity of Star_2.

This was derived using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, where the increased radius of Star_1 (1.5 times that of Star_2) contributed to its greater luminosity. Since we are asked to compute the luminosity ratio L_Star1 / L_Star2, we can express this as L_Star1 = 2.25 * L_Star2.

We found that the luminosity of Star_1 is 2.25 times that of Star_2. Therefore, the luminosity ratio can be expressed as L_Star1 / L_Star2 = 2.25.

Thus, the luminosity ratio can be expressed as L_Star1 / L_Star2 = 2.25. This ratio indicates how much brighter Star_1 is compared to Star_2 based on their respective radii and the assumption of equal temperatures.

This means that if L_Star2 is denoted as L2, then L_Star1 can be expressed as L_Star1 = 2.25 * L2. Therefore, the ratio of the luminosities can be calculated as L_Star1 / L_Star2 = (2.25 * L2) / L2 = 2.25.
