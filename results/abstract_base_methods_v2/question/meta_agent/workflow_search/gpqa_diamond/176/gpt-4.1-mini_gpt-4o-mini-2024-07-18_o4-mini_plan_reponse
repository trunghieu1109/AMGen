Given that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2 and both stars have the same temperature, we can express the luminosity of Star_1 in terms of Star_2's luminosity. Let R_2 be the radius of Star_2, then R_1 = 1.5R_2. The luminosity of Star_2 is L_2 = 4\u03c0R_2\u00b2\u03c3T\u2074, and for Star_1, we have L_1 = 4\u03c0(1.5R_2)\u00b2\u03c3T\u2074. Simplifying L_1 gives us L_1 = 4\u03c0(2.25R_2\u00b2)\u03c3T\u2074 = 2.25L_2.

This conclusion is consistent across multiple analyses and aligns with the principles of the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which relates luminosity to the radius and temperature of stars.

        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - Wien's displacement law states that the peak wavelength (\u03bb_max) of radiation emitted by a black body is inversely proportional to its temperature (T). The law is given by the formula \u03bb_max * T = b, where b is Wien's displacement constant (approximately 2.898 x 10^-3 m*K). Since both stars have the same peak wavelength, they must also have the same temperature. Therefore, we can conclude that the temperature of both stars is the same, but we cannot determine the exact temperature without knowing the peak wavelength. However, since the question states that they have the same peak wavelength, we can affirm that their temperatures are equal.; answer - The temperature of both stars is the same.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - Since both stars have the same peak wavelength, we can apply Wien's displacement law, which indicates that the temperature of a black body is inversely proportional to its peak wavelength. Therefore, if the peak wavelengths are identical for both stars, their temperatures must also be equal. This reasoning confirms that Star_1 and Star_2 have the same temperature.; answer - The temperatures of Star_1 and Star_2 are equal.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - To calculate the luminosity of each star using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, we use the formula L = 4\u03c0R\u00b2\u03c3T\u2074, where L is the luminosity, R is the radius, \u03c3 is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature. Since we established that the temperatures of Star_1 and Star_2 are equal, we can denote the temperature as T. Let R2 be the radius of Star_2, then the radius of Star_1 is R1 = 1.5 * R2. The luminosity of Star_1 is L1 = 4\u03c0(1.5R2)\u00b2\u03c3T\u2074 = 4\u03c0(2.25R2\u00b2)\u03c3T\u2074 = 2.25 * (4\u03c0R2\u00b2\u03c3T\u2074) = 2.25 * L2, where L2 is the luminosity of Star_2.

This conclusion is derived from the application of the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which relates the luminosity of a star to its radius and temperature. Given that Star_1 has a radius and mass 1.5 times that of Star_2, and assuming they radiate as black bodies with the same peak wavelength, the luminosity ratio can be confidently stated as 2.25.

In the context of multiple-choice questions, the index 1 corresponds to choice A, index 2 corresponds to choice B, index 3 corresponds to choice C, and index 4 corresponds to choice D.
