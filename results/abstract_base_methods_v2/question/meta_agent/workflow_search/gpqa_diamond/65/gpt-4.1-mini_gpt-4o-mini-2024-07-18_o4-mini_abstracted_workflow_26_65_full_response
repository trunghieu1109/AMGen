Lorentz symmetry ensures that the laws of physics are invariant under Lorentz transformations, which is fundamental for any relativistic theory. Poincare symmetry extends this by including translations in space and time, ensuring that physical laws are the same regardless of the observer\'s position or state of motion. CP symmetry is crucial for understanding particle interactions, especially in the context of CP violation, which is an important aspect of the Standard Model. Finally, CPT symmetry is a fundamental theorem in quantum field theory that states that the combined transformations of charge, parity, and time must leave the physical laws invariant.

Lorentz symmetry ensures invariance under Lorentz transformations, while Poincare symmetry encompasses both Lorentz transformations and translations in space and time. CP symmetry is essential for understanding particle interactions and violations, and CPT symmetry is a fundamental principle in quantum field theory. Therefore, all four symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The multiple-choice options provided indicate that the correct answer must include all four symmetries, which corresponds to the choice \'1,2,3,4\'. However, since this option is not explicitly listed, I must select the closest match based on the available choices, which is \'1,2,4\' (choice 4) that includes Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT symmetries, but misses CP.
