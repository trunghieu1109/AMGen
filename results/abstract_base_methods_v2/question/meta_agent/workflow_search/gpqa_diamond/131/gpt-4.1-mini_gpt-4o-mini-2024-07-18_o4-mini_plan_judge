Question: Example(question='The 1H NMR spectrum of a solution containing a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14 exhibits two signals (two singlets) at around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. There are also three signals at around 2.2 ppm (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio. Which two compounds are present in the mixture from the following options: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, and 1,4-diethylbenzene.', choice1='1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene', choice2='1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene', choice3='1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene', choice4='1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene', correct_index=4)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_131
proposed answer: The NMR data indicates two distinct aromatic compounds, as evidenced by the two singlets at around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio, suggesting symmetry in substitution. The presence of three singlets at around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio indicates that one compound has two equivalent protons (likely from two methyl groups) while the other has two different environments for the protons (one methyl and one ethyl). Analyzing the candidates: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene has four methyl groups and would contribute to the 2:1:1 ratio observed at ~2.2 ppm, while 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene has three methyl groups and one hydrogen that would also fit the expected signals. The other candidates either do not match the required symmetry or do not produce the correct integration ratios. Therefore, the two compounds that match the observed NMR data are indeed 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

Answer:1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene
Extracted answer: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene
Correct answer: 4

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_131
proposed answer: The analysis confirms that the selected candidate pair, 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, reconciles well with the molecular formula C10H14. The NMR data shows two singlets at around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio, indicating equal contributions from both compounds in the aromatic region. Additionally, the three singlets at around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio correspond to the different methyl groups in the two compounds, supporting the integration ratios observed. Therefore, this pair matches the NMR data and molecular formula without contradictions, validating the choice made in the previous analysis.
