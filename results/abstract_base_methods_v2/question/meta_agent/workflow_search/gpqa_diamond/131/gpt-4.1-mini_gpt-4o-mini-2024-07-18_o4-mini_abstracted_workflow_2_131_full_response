In this case, we have C = 10, H = 14, N = 0, and X = 0. Plugging in the values: DU = (2*10 + 2 + 0 - 14 - 0) / 2 = (20 + 2 - 14) / 2 = 8 / 2 = 4. A degree of unsaturation of 4 indicates that there are 4 rings or double bonds in the structure. Given that the compounds are aromatic, we can confirm the presence of at least one aromatic ring. The presence of two singlets in the NMR spectrum suggests that there are two different environments for the protons, which is consistent with the presence of two different aromatic compounds. The three signals at around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio suggest that there are different types of protons in the aliphatic region, likely due to the presence of methyl groups on the aromatic rings.

For 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, there are 2 unique environments: the protons on the aromatic ring typically appear around 6.5-7.5 ppm, while the methyl groups appear around 2.0-2.5 ppm. The splitting pattern for the aromatic protons will be complex due to their interactions, while the methyl groups will appear as singlets. For 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, the 3 unique environments include aromatic protons (6.5-7.5 ppm), and 3 methyl groups (2.0-2.5 ppm), with the methyl groups likely appearing as singlets. For 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, the 4 unique environments include aromatic protons (6.5-7.5 ppm) and 4 methyl groups (2.0-2.5 ppm), with the methyl groups appearing as singlets.

Each compound will have different sets of equivalent protons based on their substitution patterns. For 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, the protons on the aromatic ring will be in two different environments due to symmetry, and the four methyl groups will contribute to the aliphatic region. For 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, the substitution pattern will create three different environments for the aromatic protons and the four methyl groups will also be represented.

For 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, there are two distinct sets of aromatic protons due to the symmetry of the compound, leading to two signals in NMR. The methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5 will lead to equivalent proton environments. For 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, we have three distinct sets of aromatic protons, which will yield three signals in NMR, and the methyl groups will also create distinct environments.

For 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, there are 2 unique environments: the protons on the aromatic ring typically appear around 6.5-7.5 ppm, while the methyl groups appear around 2.0-2.5 ppm. The splitting pattern for the aromatic protons will be complex due to their interactions, while the methyl groups will appear as singlets. For 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, the 3 unique environments include aromatic protons (6.5-7.5 ppm), and 3 methyl groups (2.0-2.5 ppm), with the methyl groups likely appearing as singlets. For 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, the 4 unique environments include aromatic protons (6.5-7.5 ppm) and 4 methyl groups (2.0-2.5 ppm), with the methyl groups appearing as singlets.

For 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, the methyl groups are in positions that create a symmetrical environment, leading to two unique proton environments: one for the protons on the aromatic ring (around 6.5-7.0 ppm) and one for the methyl groups (around 2.0-2.5 ppm). The splitting pattern for the aromatic protons will likely be complex due to the influence of neighboring protons. For 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, there are three unique environments: the aromatic protons (around 6.5-7.0 ppm), one set of methyl protons (around 2.0-2.5 ppm), and another set of methyl protons (also around 2.0-2.5 ppm but possibly slightly different due to their different environments). The splitting will vary based on the proximity of the methyl groups to each other. For 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, there are four unique environments: one for the aromatic protons (around 6.5-7.0 ppm) and three distinct methyl environments (around 2.0-2.5 ppm), each likely showing different splitting patterns. Finally, for 1,4-diethylbenzene, there are two unique environments: the aromatic protons (around 6.5-7.0 ppm) and the ethyl protons (around 1.0-1.5 ppm for the methyl protons and around 3.0-3.5 ppm for the methylene protons). The splitting patterns will be influenced by the coupling with neighboring protons. Therefore, the expected chemical shifts and splitting patterns are as follows: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene - Aromatic protons ~6.5-7.0 ppm (complex splitting), Methyl protons ~2.0-2.5 ppm (singlet); 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene - Aromatic protons ~6.5-7.0 ppm (complex splitting), Methyl protons ~2.0-2.5 ppm (singlets); 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene - Aromatic protons ~6.5-7.0 ppm (complex splitting), Methyl protons ~2.0-2.5 ppm (singlets); 1,4-diethylbenzene - Aromatic protons ~6.5-7.0 ppm (complex splitting), Ethyl protons ~1.0-1.5 ppm (triplet) and ~3.0-3.5 ppm (quartet).; answer: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene - Aromatic protons ~6.5-7.0 ppm (complex splitting), Methyl protons ~2.0-2.5 ppm (singlet); 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene - Aromatic protons ~6.5-7.0 ppm (complex splitting), Methyl protons ~2.0-2.5 ppm (singlets); 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene - Aromatic protons ~6.5-7.0 ppm (complex splitting), Methyl protons ~2.0-2.5 ppm (singlets); 1,4-diethylbenzene - Aromatic protons ~6.5-7.0 ppm (complex splitting), Ethyl protons ~1.0-1.5 ppm (triplet) and ~3.0-3.5 ppm (quartet).\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent qU33, predicting chemical shifts and splitting patterns, thinking: To predict the expected chemical shift ranges and splitting patterns for each unique proton environment in the candidate compounds, we need to consider the structure of each compound and the typical chemical shifts for protons in aromatic and aliphatic environments. For 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, the two unique environments are the protons on the aromatic ring and the methyl groups. The methyl protons typically resonate around 2.0-2.5 ppm, while the aromatic protons resonate around 6.5-7.5 ppm. The splitting pattern for the methyl groups will be singlets due to their equivalent nature. For 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, we expect three unique environments: the aromatic protons and the three methyl groups, with similar chemical shift ranges as mentioned above. The splitting pattern for the methyl groups will also be singlets. For 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, there will be four unique environments for the methyl groups and the aromatic protons, with the same chemical shifts and singlet patterns. Lastly, for 1,4-diethylbenzene, the ethyl groups will have their protons resonate around 1.0-1.5 ppm for the methyls and 3.0-3.5 ppm for the methylene protons, while the aromatic protons will resonate around 6.5-7.5 ppm. The splitting pattern for the ethyl groups will show multiplets due to the neighboring protons. In summary, the predicted chemical shifts and splitting patterns are as follows: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: aromatic protons ~6.7 ppm (singlet), methyls ~2.2 ppm (singlet); 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene: aromatic protons ~6.7 ppm (singlet), methyls ~2.2 ppm (singlet); 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene: aromatic protons ~6.7 ppm (singlet), methyls ~2.2 ppm (singlet); 1,4-diethylbenzene: aromatic protons ~6.7 ppm (multiplet), ethyl methyls ~1.0-1.5 ppm (triplet), and ethyl methylene ~3.0-3.5 ppm (quartet).; answer: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: aromatic protons ~6.7 ppm (singlet), methyls ~2.2 ppm (singlet); 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene: aromatic protons ~6.7 ppm (singlet), methyls ~2.2 ppm (singlet); 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene: aromatic protons ~6.7 ppm (singlet), methyls ~2.2 ppm (singlet); 1,4-diethylbenzene: aromatic protons ~6.7 ppm (multiplet), ethyl methyls ~1.0-1.5 ppm (triplet), ethyl methylene ~3.0-3.5 ppm (quartet).\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent GoCx, round 0, comparing candidate pairs with observed NMR data, thinking: The observed 1H NMR data shows two singlets at ~6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio, indicating the presence of two unique aromatic proton environments. This is consistent with the presence of two different aromatic compounds. Additionally, the three singlets at ~2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio suggest the presence of three unique aliphatic proton environments, which can be attributed to methyl groups. The predicted chemical shifts and splitting patterns for the candidate compounds indicate that both 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene provide the necessary proton environments to match the observed data. In contrast, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene do not fit the observed ratios and shifts as they either have too many unique environments or do not align with the integration ratios. Therefore, the consistent matches for the observed data are 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.; answer: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent rQPx, round 0, comparing candidate pairs with observed NMR data, thinking: The observed 1H NMR data shows two aromatic singlets at ~6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio, indicating that there are two distinct aromatic environments that are equivalent in terms of integration. This aligns well with the presence of two compounds in a 1:1 mixture. Additionally, the three aliphatic singlets at ~2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio suggest that there are three unique methyl groups from the two compounds contributing to this signal. When comparing the predicted environments from the candidate compounds, 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene both have aromatic protons that would resonate around 6.7 ppm and would produce singlets due to the symmetry in their structures. The methyl groups from these compounds would provide the expected aliphatic signals at ~2.2 ppm, with the ratios matching the observed data. In contrast, the other candidate pairs either do not match the aromatic singlet ratio or do not provide the correct integration ratios for the aliphatic signals. Therefore, the consistent match is between 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.; answer: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent jx2d, round 0, comparing candidate pairs with observed NMR data, thinking: The observed 1H NMR data shows two aromatic singlets at ~6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio and three aliphatic singlets at ~2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio. For 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, it has 2 unique aromatic environments and 4 methyl groups, which would not yield the observed 2:1:1 ratio for the aliphatic protons. For 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, it has 3 unique methyl environments and would produce the correct 2:1:1 ratio of aliphatic protons, but it does not match the aromatic singlet requirement. For 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, it also has 4 methyl groups and would not yield the observed ratios. However, 1,4-diethylbenzene has 2 unique aromatic environments (consistent with the two singlets) and its ethyl groups would produce a different splitting pattern, which does not match the observed aliphatic singlets. The only combination that fits the 1:1 ratio for aromatic protons and the 2:1:1 ratio for aliphatic protons is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, as they can produce the observed signals due to their unique environments.

The three aliphatic singlets at ~2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio suggest that there are three different methyl environments, with one of them having twice the number of protons as the others. For 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, there are two unique aromatic environments (two singlets) and four methyl groups, which would not match the observed data. For 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, there are three methyl groups, but it has three unique environments leading to a mismatch with the integration ratio. 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene has four methyl groups and would also not fit the observed data. However, 1,4-diethylbenzene has a different splitting pattern for the ethyl groups and does not match the observed singlet pattern at ~2.2 ppm.
