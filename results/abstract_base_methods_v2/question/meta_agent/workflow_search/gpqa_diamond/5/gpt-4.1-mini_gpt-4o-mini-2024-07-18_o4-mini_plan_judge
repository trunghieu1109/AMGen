proposed answer: After analyzing the potential V(r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ), we can identify the effective frequencies for the two dimensions. The radial part corresponds to a harmonic oscillator with frequency ω_x = sqrt(k/m), and the angular part contributes to an effective frequency ω_y derived from the cos^2(θ) term, which leads to ω_y = sqrt(3k/m). Substituting these frequencies into the general energy formula for a two-dimensional anisotropic quantum harmonic oscillator, E = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x + (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y, results in E = (n_x + 1/2)ħsqrt(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2)ħsqrt(3k/m). Simplifying this expression leads to E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ħ√(k/m), which matches choice A. Therefore, the correct energy spectrum formula is A.
