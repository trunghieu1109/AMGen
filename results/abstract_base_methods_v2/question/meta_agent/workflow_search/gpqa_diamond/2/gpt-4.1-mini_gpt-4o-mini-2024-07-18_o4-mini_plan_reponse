The normalization condition requires that the sum of the squares of the coefficients equals 1. We calculate: (0.5)^2 + (\u221a3/2)^2 = 0.25 + 0.75 = 1. Since the sum equals 1, the state is already normalized. Therefore, the normalized state vector in the |\u2191\u27e9, |\u2193\u27e9 basis is simply |\u03c8\u27e9 = 0.5|\u2191\u27e9 + (\u221a3)/2|\u2193\u27e9.; answer - |\u03c8\u27e9 = 0.5|\u2191\u27e9 + (\u221a3)/2|\u2193\u27e9 (normalized state)\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - The Pauli spin operators \u03c3_z and \u03c3_x are represented in the |\u2191\u27e9, |\u2193\u27e9 basis as follows: \u03c3_z is represented by the matrix [[1, 0], [0, -1]], which corresponds to the eigenvalues +1 for |\u2191\u27e9 and -1 for |\u2193\u27e9. The operator \u03c3_x, which flips the spin states, is represented by the matrix [[0, 1], [1, 0]], indicating that \u03c3_x|\u2191\u27e9 = |\u2193\u27e9 and \u03c3_x|\u2193\u27e9 = |\u2191\u27e9.

From Sub-task 2, we have \u03c3_z = [[1, 0], [0, -1]] and \u03c3_x = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. We multiply \u03c3_z by 10 and \u03c3_x by 5: 10\u03c3_z = 10 * [[1, 0], [0, -1]] = [[10, 0], [0, -10]] and 5\u03c3_x = 5 * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] = [[0, 5], [5, 0]]. Now we add these two matrices together: [[10, 0], [0, -10]] + [[0, 5], [5, 0]] = [[10, 5], [5, -10]]. Therefore, the matrix representation of the operator 10\u03c3_z + 5\u03c3_x is [[10, 5], [5, -10]].; answer - [[10, 5], [5, -10]]\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - To calculate the expectation value \u27e8\u03c8| (10\u03c3_z + 5\u03c3_x) |\u03c8\u27e9, we use the normalized state vector |\u03c8\u27e9 = 0.5|\u2191\u27e9 + (\u221a3)/2|\u2193\u27e9 and the operator matrix [[10, 5], [5, -10]]. First, we express |\u03c8\u27e9 in vector form: |\u03c8\u27e9 = [0.5, \u221a3/2]. The operator matrix is A = [[10, 5], [5, -10]]. We compute A|\u03c8\u27e9: A|\u03c8\u27e9 = [[10, 5], [5, -10]] * [0.5, \u221a3/2] = [10*0.5 + 5*(\u221a3/2), 5*0.5 - 10*(\u221a3/2)] = [5 + (5\u221a3)/2, (5 - 10\u221a3)/2]. Next, we calculate \u27e8\u03c8|A|\u03c8\u27e9: \u27e8\u03c8| = [0.5, \u221a3/2]*, thus \u27e8\u03c8|A|\u03c8\u27e9 = [0.5, \u221a3/2] * [5 + (5\u221a3)/2, (5 - 10\u221a3)/2]. This results in 0.5*(5 + (5\u221a3)/2) + (\u221a3/2)*((5 - 10\u221a3)/2).
