In the Pz eigenbasis, the eigenstates are |+z> = [1, 0, 0], |0> = [0, 1, 0], and |-z> = [0, 0, 1]. The state vector can be expressed as a linear combination of these basis vectors. The coefficients correspond to the amplitudes for each eigenstate. To confirm that this state corresponds to the eigenstate of Px with eigenvalue -\u0127, I need to apply the Px operator to this state and check if the result is -\u0127 times the original state. The calculations show that applying Px yields the expected eigenvalue, confirming the self-consistency of the representation.; answer - The state vector in the Pz eigenbasis is given by the coefficients of the basis vectors: (-1/2)|+z> + (1/sqrt(2))|0> + (-1/2)|-z>.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - To calculate the expectation value \u27e8Pz\u27e9 of the operator Pz in the given state vector, we first need to express the state vector in the Pz eigenbasis.

We perform the matrix multiplication of Pz with the state vector and then take the inner product with the state vector.

The state vector in the Pz eigenbasis is expressed as a linear combination of the eigenstates |+z>, |0>, and |-z>. I will first apply the Pz operator to the state vector to find \u27e8Pz\u27e9, and then apply it again to find \u27e8Pz\u00b2\u27e9.

From previous calculations, we have established that \u27e8Pz\u27e9 = 0 and \u27e8Pz\u00b2\u27e9 = 0. Substituting these values into the formula yields \u0394Pz = sqrt(0 - 0\u00b2) = sqrt(0) = 0. This indicates that there is no uncertainty in the measurement of Pz for the given state vector, as both the expectation value and the expectation value of the square are zero, leading to a definitive measurement without spread.

The matrix Pz is given as: Pz = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix}.
