Question: Example(question='Imagine an operator $\\vec{P}$ of a system have components $P_x, P_y$ and $P_z$. The matrix form of the  operator $P_x$ has components in the first row as $(0, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,\\hbar/\\sqrt{2},0)$.  The matrix form of the  operator $P_y$ has components in the first row as $(0, -i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0, -i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2},0)$. Similarly, matrix form of the  operator $P_z$ has components in the first row as $(\\hbar, 0, 0)$, that in the second row as $(0, 0, 0)$ and that in the third row as $(0,0, -\\hbar)$. The basis vectors here are the eigenvectors of $P_z$. The system is found in the eigenstate of $P_x$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$. To be more specific, the explicit form of the state of the system is given by the column vector having elements $(-1/2, 1/\\sqrt{2}, -1/2)$. What is the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z $ of $P_z$', choice1='\\hbar\n', choice2='\\hbar/2', choice3='\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}\n', choice4='\\sqrt{2}\\hbar', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: The computed uncertainty ΔPz is 0. When comparing this value with the provided multiple-choice options, none of the options (\hbar, \hbar/2, \hbar/\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{2}\hbar) include 0. Therefore, there is no correct answer choice that matches the computed uncertainty. This indicates that the uncertainty ΔPz is not represented in the given options.

Answer:None of the options match the computed uncertainty ΔPz, which is 0.
Extracted answer: None of the options match the computed uncertainty ΔPz, which is 0.
Correct answer: 3

proposed answer: The computed uncertainty ΔPz is ħ/√2, which matches one of the provided multiple-choice options. The options given were: \hbar, \hbar/2, \hbar/\sqrt{2}, and \sqrt{2}\hbar. Among these, the option that corresponds exactly to the computed value of ΔPz is \hbar/\sqrt{2}. Therefore, I conclude that this is the correct answer choice.
