The matrix Pz is given as: Pz = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix}. When we multiply Pz by itself, we calculate each element of the resulting matrix by taking the dot product of the rows of the first matrix with the columns of the second matrix. The resulting matrix will have the form: Pz² = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\hbar^2 \\end{pmatrix}.

The verified expectation values show that ⟨Pz⟩ = 0 and ⟨Pz²⟩ = ħ²/2. Substituting these values into the formula yields ΔPz = sqrt(ħ²/2 - 0²) = sqrt(ħ²/2) = ħ/√2. This result is consistent with the principles of quantum mechanics and the properties of the operators involved. Therefore, the final decision on the uncertainty ΔPz is ħ/√2.; answer: ħ/√2\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT agent 0ab8, selecting correct multiple-choice answer for ΔPz, thinking: The computed uncertainty ΔPz is ħ/√2, which matches one of the provided multiple-choice options. The options given were: \\hbar, \\hbar/2, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, and \\sqrt{2}\\hbar. Among these, the option that corresponds exactly to the computed value of ΔPz is \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}. Therefore, I conclude that this is the correct answer choice.; answer: C', iteration_idx=-1)]
