Each particle contributes based on its mass and the nature of its interactions. The Higgs boson (h₁) contributes positively due to its mass and role in symmetry breaking, represented by a positive coefficient α₁. The W and Z bosons also contribute positively, with coefficients α₂ and α₃ respectively, reflecting their contributions to electroweak symmetry breaking. Charged scalars (H⁺) and neutral scalars (H⁰) similarly contribute positively, with coefficients α₄ and α₅, due to their mass terms. The pseudoscalar (A⁰) also contributes positively with coefficient α₆. All contributions enhance the mass of h₂, indicating a consistent positive contribution from all relevant particles. However, this analysis assumes no additional particles or higher-order corrections significantly alter these contributions, which is a limitation of the model.

The top quark contributes positively due to its large mass, which enhances the effective potential significantly. This positive contribution is crucial as it stems from the top quark's role in the Higgs mechanism and its interactions with the Higgs field. On the other hand, the singlet fermions N_i contribute negatively to the mass correction. This negative contribution arises from their specific interactions and the structure of the effective potential, where the logarithmic term can lead to a reduction in the mass due to the summation over their contributions. The negative signs associated with the singlet fermions reflect their role in the effective potential, which can counterbalance the positive contribution from the top quark. The relative importance of these contributions is essential; while the top quark's contribution is substantial and positive, the negative contributions from the singlet fermions can significantly affect the final mass of h₂. Therefore, the mass formula reflects both the enhancement from the top quark and the suppression from the singlet fermions, which is critical for understanding the mass spectrum in this extended model.; answer - The fermion contributions to the one-loop radiative mass correction for the pseudo-Goldstone boson h₂ include the top quark and the singlet fermions N_i. The top quark contributes positively due to its large mass, enhancing the effective potential.

In the context of the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism, the mass correction arises from loop integrals that depend on the scales of symmetry breaking, represented by the VEVs of the scalar fields involved. The factor (x² + v²) ensures that the mass correction is appropriately normalized by the scale of symmetry breaking. The overall structure of the mass formula includes contributions from scalar and gauge bosons, which are positive, and fermions, which can have negative contributions. The positive contributions enhance the mass of h₂, while the negative contributions from the singlet fermions N_i can reduce it. Therefore, the overall sign conventions in the mass formula reflect the balance between these contributions, confirming that the placement of the VEV factor in the denominator is correct and necessary for the physical interpretation of the mass of h₂. This analysis aligns with the outputs of Sub-tasks 3a and 3b, which detail the contributions and their signs, supporting the conclusion that the structure of the mass correction expression is consistent and valid.; answer - The VEV factor (x² + v²) is correctly placed in the denominator of the mass formula for h₂, ensuring proper dimensionality and normalization.

The top quark, being the heaviest fermion in the Standard Model, has a significant positive contribution to the mass correction due to its large mass, which enhances the effective potential.
