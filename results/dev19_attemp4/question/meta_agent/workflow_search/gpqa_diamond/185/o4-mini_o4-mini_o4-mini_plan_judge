Question: Example(question='Identify the possible product when (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene undergoes Cope rearrangement.', choice1='4,4a,7,7a-tetrahydro-1H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine', choice2='4,4a,5,7a-tetrahydro-3H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine', choice3='4,6,7,7a-tetrahydro-3H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine', choice4='4,4a,5,6-tetrahydro-1H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: 1. The rearrangement converts the azabicyclo[2.2.1] framework into a cyclopenta[c]pyridine scaffold via a suprafacial [3,3]-sigmatropic shift.
2. In the product, the six-membered pyridine ring (atoms N1–C2–C3–C4–C5–C6) must remain aromatic, retaining three π bonds and thus all those carbons remain sp2.
3. The fused cyclopentane ring shares positions C4 and C5 of the pyridine; its other three atoms are the former bridgeheads C4a, C7a and the methylene C7.
4. These four carbons (C4, C4a, C7, C7a) become sp3 in the cyclopentane fragment, requiring four extra hydrogens at those positions, hence “tetrahydro” at 4,4a,7,7a.
5. The nitrogen (N1) retains its proton, giving the 1H tautomer rather than any 3H tautomer.
6. Among the four choices, only 4,4a,7,7a-tetrahydro-1H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine matches this pattern of saturation and N-H placement.
7. Therefore, the correct answer is choice A).
