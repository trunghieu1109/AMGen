proposed answer: 1. At the turning points x=±A, the oscillator’s speed is zero and all energy is potential plus rest energy: E_turn = m c² + ½ k A².  
2. At x=0, potential energy is zero and total energy is purely relativistic: E_eq = γ m c², where γ = 1/√(1–v_max²/c²).  
3. Energy conservation demands E_eq = E_turn, so γ m c² = m c² + ½ k A² ⇒ γ = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).  
4. Substitute γ = 1/√(1–v_max²/c²): 1/√(1–v_max²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).  
5. Invert and square to get 1–v_max²/c² = 1/[1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]².  
6. Rearranged, v_max²/c² = 1 – 1/[1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]². Therefore v_max = c √[1 – 1/(1 + k A²/(2 m c²))²].  
7. Comparing with the given options shows this matches choice 2 exactly.  
8. The nonrelativistic limit (k A²/(2 m c²)≪1) also reduces to v_max≈√(k A²/m), confirming consistency.  
Thus the correct answer is choice B).
