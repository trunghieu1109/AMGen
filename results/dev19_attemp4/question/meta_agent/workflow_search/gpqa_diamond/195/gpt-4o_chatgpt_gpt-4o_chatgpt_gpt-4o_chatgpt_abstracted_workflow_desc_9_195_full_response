Classically, Hook's law states that the force exerted by a spring is proportional to the displacement from equilibrium, F = -kx. The potential energy stored in the spring is U = (1/2)kx^2. In the absence of relativistic effects, the maximum speed can be found using energy conservation: the total mechanical energy is constant, and at maximum speed, all energy is kinetic. The kinetic energy classically is K = (1/2)mv^2, and at maximum amplitude A, the potential energy is U = (1/2)kA^2, leading to v_max = sqrt(kA^2/m).

In classical mechanics, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator can be found by equating the maximum potential energy (at maximum displacement A) to the maximum kinetic energy. However, since this is a relativistic problem, we must consider relativistic dynamics.
