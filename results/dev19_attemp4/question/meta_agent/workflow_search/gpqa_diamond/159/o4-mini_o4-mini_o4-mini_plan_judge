Question: Example(question='Consider an aperture, which shapes like a N-sided polygon. All the apothems are of the same length a. When a monochromatic light (of wavelength \\lambda), travelling along z-axis, falls vertically on this aperture, it creates a series of intensity maxima and minima in the far field region. What is the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large ? Assume that the related angles are small so that tan theta = theta approximation can be taken.', choice1='1.220 \\lambda /a ', choice2='0.610 \\lambda / a', choice3='0.500 \\lambda / a', choice4='0.506 \\lambda / a', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: 1. As N approaches infinity, the N-sided regular polygon with apothem a becomes a circular aperture of radius a.
2. In the far‐field (Fraunhofer) diffraction of a circular aperture, the intensity pattern is given by the Airy function where minima occur at zeros of the first‐order Bessel function J1(u).
3. The first two positive zeros of J1(u) are u1 ≈ 3.8317 and u2 ≈ 7.0156.
4. Using the small‐angle approximation (sinθ ≈ θ) and k = 2π/λ, the mth minimum satisfies k a θm = um, so θm = um λ/(2π a).
5. Thus θ1 = 3.8317 λ/(2π a) ≈ 0.610 λ/a and θ2 = 7.0156 λ/(2π a) ≈ 1.117 λ/a.
6. The angular separation Δθ = θ2 − θ1 = (7.0156 − 3.8317) λ/(2π a) ≈ 0.506 λ/a.
7. Comparing this result with the given options shows it matches choice D.
