Question: Example(question='Observations of a quasar across the electromagnetic spectrum are being carried out. Focusing on the near infrared and optical spectrum, there is a peak at wavelength of about 790 nm, and at shorter wavelengths < 790 nm the flux drops significantly.\n\nIf we lived in a universe defined by Lambda-CDM model such that the current Hubble constant is 70 km s^-1 Mpc^-1, matter density parameter is 0.3, dark energy density parameter is 0.7, and universe is flat,\nwhat can be assumed about the value of the comoving distance (for scale factor a=1) of this quasar from the Earth?', choice1='8 Gpc', choice2='9 Gpc', choice3='7 Gpc', choice4='6 Gpc', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: 1. We have a sharp drop in the quasar’s observed flux blueward of 790 nm, which we identify as the Gunn–Peterson trough at the redshifted Lyα line (λ_rest=121.6 nm).
2. This gives a redshift z = (λ_obs/λ_rest) – 1 ≃ (790/121.6) – 1 ≃ 5.50.
3. In flat ΛCDM (H₀=70 km/s/Mpc, Ωₘ=0.3, Ω_Λ=0.7), the comoving distance D_C = (c/H₀) ∫₀^z dz′/√[Ωₘ(1+z′)³+Ω_Λ].
4. Calculate the Hubble distance D_H = c/H₀ ≃ 300,000 km/s ÷ 70 km/s/Mpc ≃ 4,286 Mpc ≃ 4.286 Gpc.
5. Numerically evaluate I = ∫₀^5.5 dz′/√[0.3(1+z′)³+0.7] via Simpson’s rule with 5 points: z′={0,1.375,2.75,4.125,5.5}. We get f(z′)=1/E(z′)≈{1.0000,0.4606,0.2460,0.1562,0.1097}. Simpson sum S≈1 + 4×0.4606 + 2×0.2460 + 4×0.1562 + 0.1097 ≃ 4.069. With h=1.375, I ≃ (h/3)·S ≃ (1.375/3)·4.069 ≃ 1.865.
6. Therefore D_C ≃ D_H × I ≃ 4.286 Gpc × 1.865 ≃ 8.00 Gpc.
7. Comparing to the discrete choices 6, 7, 8, 9 Gpc, the closest match is 8 Gpc (choice A).
