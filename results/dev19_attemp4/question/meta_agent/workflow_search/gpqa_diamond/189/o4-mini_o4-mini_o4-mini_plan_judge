Question: Example(question='The reaction of an electron pair donor, nucleophile (Nu) with an electron pair acceptor is called nucleophilic substitution reaction. An sp3-hybridized electrophile needs to have a leaving group to proceed with the reaction. Substitution reactions have the following two types. One is SN1 and the other is the SN2 reaction. In contrast to the substitution reaction, the elimination reaction involves the removal of a pair or groups of atoms from a molecule. These are chemical reactions in which single carbon-carbon bonded organic compounds are converted to compounds containing double/triple bonds (unsaturated compounds).\nArrange the following nucleophiles more reactive to the poorest reactive in the aqueous solution.\n\n1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate\n2. Hydroxide\n3. Propionate\n4. Methanol\n5. Ethanethiolate', choice1='5, 2, 1, 3 and 4', choice2='2, 5, 1, 4 and 3', choice3='5, 2, 3, 1 and 4', choice4='2, 5, 3, 4 and 3', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: To rank the nucleophiles (5 = EtS–, 2 = OH–, 1 = 4-Me-cyclohexan-1-olate, 3 = propionate, 4 = MeOH) in water, we consider four factors:

1. Basicity (pKa of conjugate acid):
   – Cyclohexanol pKa ≈ 17 → strongest base (1)
   – Water pKa ≈ 15.7 → next (2)
   – Ethanethiol pKa ≈ 10 → weaker base (5)
   – Propionic acid pKa ≈ 4.8 → much weaker (3)
   – Methanol neutral and poorest (4)

2. Polarizability (“softness”) in protic solvent:
   – RS– (5) is highly polarizable → very nucleophilic
   – RO– (1) next → less polarizable than RS–
   – OH– (2) is hard and small → heavily solvated
   – RCOO– (3) resonance‐stabilized, two O’s → lower nucleophilicity
   – ROH (4) neutral → very low

3. Solvation and steric hindrance:
   – OH– (2) is heavily H-bonded → reduced vs alkoxides
   – Cyclohexan-1-olate (1) is bulky → steric penalty
   – Propionate (3) is doubly solvated and resonance‐delocalized → weak

4. Putting it all together for SN2 reactivity in water:
   – EtS– (5): least solvated, very polarizable → highest
   – OH– (2): strong base but heavily solvated → second
   – Cyclohexanolate (1): very basic but bulky and solvation moderated → third
   – Propionate (3): resonance‐stabilized and highly solvated → fourth
   – Methanol (4): neutral, poorest → last

This sequence 5 > 2 > 1 > 3 > 4 matches choice A).
