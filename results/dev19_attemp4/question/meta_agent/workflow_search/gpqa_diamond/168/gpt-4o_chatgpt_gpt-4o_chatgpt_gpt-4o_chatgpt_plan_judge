Question: Example(question='You are studying a nuclear decay which converts two heavy nucleons of flavor A to another flavor B, while simultaneously emitting two much lighter particles E and V. In short, 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V. It is known that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous, with some endpoint value Q.\n\nA variant of this decay emits one exotic, massless particle M instead of the 2V. In this case, how does the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles compare to that of the original decay?', choice1='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint increases.', choice2='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases.', choice3='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.', choice4='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint decreases.', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: In the original decay process 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V, the energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous because the energy is shared among multiple particles, allowing for a range of possible energy values for the E particles. The endpoint of this spectrum is determined by the maximum energy the E particles can have, which is limited by the energy carried away by the other particles, including the two V particles. In the variant decay process, where 2V is replaced by a single massless particle M, energy conservation still applies, but the massless particle M can carry energy continuously without a lower bound, unlike the two V particles which might have some mass. This means that M can take away less energy than the combined energy of the two V particles, allowing the E particles to have more energy. As a result, the energy spectrum of the E particles remains continuous because the energy distribution among the particles still allows for a range of energy values, but the endpoint of the spectrum increases because the E particles can achieve higher energy values due to the reduced energy carried away by the single massless particle compared to the two V particles. Therefore, the spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.
