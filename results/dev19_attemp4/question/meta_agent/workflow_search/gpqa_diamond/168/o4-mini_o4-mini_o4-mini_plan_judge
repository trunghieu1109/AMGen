Question: Example(question='You are studying a nuclear decay which converts two heavy nucleons of flavor A to another flavor B, while simultaneously emitting two much lighter particles E and V. In short, 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V. It is known that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous, with some endpoint value Q.\n\nA variant of this decay emits one exotic, massless particle M instead of the 2V. In this case, how does the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles compare to that of the original decay?', choice1='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint increases.', choice2='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases.', choice3='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.', choice4='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint decreases.', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: We compare the original 4-body decay 2A→2B+2E+2V with the 3-body variant 2A→2B+2E+M. In any decay with more than two final particles, the energy shared among light products is continuously variable, so the E-spectrum stays continuous. Next, endpoint energies arise when all other products carry minimal kinetic energy. In the original, the two massive V’s can be at rest, so the maximal E energy sum is Q  (fixed). In the variant, we remove the rest mass 2m_V and replace it with a massless M: that rest energy is entirely available as extra kinetic energy for the E’s (and recoil), raising the maximal total E energy by 2m_V c^2. Thus the endpoint shifts above Q, while the spectrum remains continuous (though its detailed shape changes due to phase-space reduction). Hence choice C.
