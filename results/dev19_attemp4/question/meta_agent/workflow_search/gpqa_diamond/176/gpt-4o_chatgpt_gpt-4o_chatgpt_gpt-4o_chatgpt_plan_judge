Question: Example(question='Astronomers are interested in the luminosities of two stars. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2. The mass of Star_1 is also larger by the same factor (1.5 times). Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same. Astronomers also calculated the radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:', choice1='~2.25', choice2='~2.35', choice3='~2.32', choice4='~2.23\n', correct_index=4)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_0_176
proposed answer: To determine the factor by which Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the luminosity L of a star is given by L = 4πR^2σT^4, where R is the radius of the star, T is its temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since the stars have the same peak wavelength, they have the same temperature due to Wien's Displacement Law. Therefore, the luminosity ratio depends only on the square of their radii. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, so the luminosity of Star_1 is greater by a factor of (1.5)^2 = 2.25. The mass and radial velocity do not affect the luminosity in this context.

proposed answer: To determine the factor by which Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for black body radiation. The luminosity L of a star is given by L = 4πR^2σT^4, where R is the radius, T is the temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The problem states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2, and both stars have the same peak wavelength, indicating they have the same temperature. Therefore, the luminosity ratio L1/L2 is determined by the ratio of their radii squared, since the temperatures are the same. The radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2, so the luminosity ratio is (1.5)^2 = 2.25. This means that the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of 2.25. The radial velocity affects the observed wavelength but not the intrinsic temperature or luminosity directly, as the temperature correction has already been accounted for. Therefore, the most consistent and correct answer is A) ~2.25.
