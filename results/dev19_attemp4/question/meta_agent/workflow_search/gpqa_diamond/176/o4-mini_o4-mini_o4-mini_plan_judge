proposed answer: 1. Observed λ_max must be corrected for each star’s radial velocity via the Doppler formula: λ_emit = λ_obs / (1 + v_rad/c).  
2. For Star₂ (v=700 km/s ≪ c), the fractional shift Δλ/λ ≈ v/c ≈ 700/3×10^5 ≈ 2.3×10^−3, so λ_emit differs by only ~0.23%.  
3. After applying Doppler correction, both stars indeed have the same λ_emit ⇒ T₁ = T₂ (via Wien’s law λ_max T = constant).  
4. Stefan–Boltzmann law: L ∝ R² T⁴. With T₁ = T₂, L₁/L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25.  
5. The small Doppler correction alters the inferred temperature by ≲0.23%, which would change L by ≲4×(0.23%) ≲1%, far below the precision distinguishing choices.  
6. Therefore, properly accounting for radial velocity does not affect the conclusion that L₁/L₂ ≈ 2.25.

proposed answer: 1. Stefan–Boltzmann law: L ∝ R^2 T^4. 2. Wien’s displacement law: λ_max = b/T ⇒ T = b/λ_max. 3. Observers report identical λ_max for both stars. Two possible cases:
   Case I (Doppler corrections applied or negligible radial velocity effect): intrinsic λ_max1 = λ_max2 ⇒ T1 = T2. Then L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2·(T1/T2)^4 = (1.5)^2·1^4 = 2.25.
   Case II (no Doppler correction): Star_2’s observed λ_max is redshifted by factor (1+v/c) ≈1.00233, so its intrinsic T2 ≈ T_obs×(1+v/c) ≈ T1×1.00233. Then L1/L2 = (1.5)^2·(1/1.00233)^4 ≈2.23.
4. In practice astronomers correct spectra for radial velocities to recover intrinsic λ_max, so we adopt Case I. 5. Compare to options: A)~2.25, B)~2.35, C)~2.32, D)~2.23. The computed value 2.25 matches option A exactly.
