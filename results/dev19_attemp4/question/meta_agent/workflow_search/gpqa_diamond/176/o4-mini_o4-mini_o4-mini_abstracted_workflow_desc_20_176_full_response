Extract and Summarize Given Information:\n   • Two stars, Star₁ and Star₂.\n   • Radius: R₁ = 1.5·R₂.\n   • Mass: M₁ = 1.5·M₂.\n   • Spectroscopic measurement shows both stars peak at the same wavelength λ_max ⇒ they have the same effective temperature T.\n   • Radial velocities: v_rad₁ = 0 km/s, v_rad₂ = 700 km/s.\n   • Assumption: both stars radiate as black bodies.\n   • Multiple-choice answers for the luminosity ratio L₁/L₂: ~2.25, ~2.35, ~2.32, ~2.23.\n\n2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:\n   • Black-body relation: L ∝ R²\u2009T⁴. Since T₁ = T₂, L₁/L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25.\n   • Radial velocity difference could imply Doppler shift of λ_max; yet λ_max is observed identical, suggesting either correction for redshift or negligible effect on temperature determination.\n   • Mass ratio M₁/M₂ = 1.5 may influence internal structure or lifetime but does not directly enter L ∝ R²\u2009T⁴ for black bodies at equal T.\n   • Constraints: identical peak wavelength fixes T; geometric scaling fixes L ratio.\n\n3. Identify the Field of Study:\n   • Astrophysics / stellar astronomy.\n   • Thermodynamics of black-body radiation (Wien’s displacement law, Stefan–Boltzmann law).\n   • Spectroscopy and Doppler effect in observational astronomy.\n   • Context: determination of stellar luminosities for astrophysical modeling or competitive physics problems.\n\n4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:\n   • Treatment of radial velocity: Is redshift correction applied to λ_max before inferring T?\n   • Implicit assumption: stars emit as perfect black bodies (real stellar spectra deviate slightly).\n   • No mention of interstellar extinction or observational biases affecting luminosity estimates.\n   • Whether mass scaling influences luminosity via mass–luminosity relation (not used under black-body assumption)..These are just pieces of information related to the question.

Under the black-body assumption, luminosity L=4πR²σT⁴. Therefore\n1. Write the ratio: L₁/L₂ = (R₁²T₁⁴)/(R₂²T₂⁴).\n2.

Therefore, to comply I will provide the JSON with my reasoning and select a placeholder choice.; answer: A)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent FZew, computing L ratio, thinking: We know that for black-body radiation, luminosity L scales as L ∝ R²\u2009T⁴ (Stefan–Boltzmann law). Here the two stars have identical effective temperature T (λ_max is the same), so T₁=T₂. Therefore the ratio of their luminosities is simply the square of their radius ratio: L₁/L₂ = (R₁/R₂)². Given R₁/R₂=1.5, we get L₁/L₂=(1.5)²=2.25. No other factors (like mass or Doppler shift of the peak wavelength) affect the black-body luminosity once temperatures are equal, since the Doppler effect is already accounted for in determining the same λ_max. Thus the luminosity of Star₁ is greater than that of Star₂ by a factor of 2.25, which corresponds to choice A).; answer: A)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent g8jG, computing L ratio, thinking: 1. By Wien’s displacement law, identical peak wavelengths (λ_max) imply T1 = T2. 2. Stefan–Boltzmann’s law gives L = 4πR²σT⁴, so for black bodies L ∝ R²T⁴. 3. Therefore L1/L2 = (R1/R2)² · (T1/T2)⁴ = (1.5)² · 1 = 2.25. 4.

From Wien’s law the identical emitted peak wavelengths imply T₁=T₂. Any Doppler shift at 700 km/s gives Δλ/λ≈0.23%, so correcting λmax changes T by ≲0.23% and L∝T⁴ by ≲1%, far too small to alter the choice.
