Question: Example(question='What is the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product obtained when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess of HI?', choice1='1', choice2='3', choice3='0', choice4='5', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_16_182
proposed answer: Step 1: Determine the original IHD of 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. It has one ring (1 DU), one C=C in the ring (1 DU), one vinyl C=C (1 DU), one formyl C=O (1 DU) and one carboxyl C=O (1 DU) for a total of 5 degrees of unsaturation.

Step 2: Predict the effect of red phosphorus and excess HI. This reagent system is known to decarboxylate carboxylic acids (loss of CO2, removing 1 DU) and to reduce aldehydes fully to alkanes (removing the C=O, another 1 DU). It does not hydrogenate C=C bonds under these conditions.

Step 3: Calculate the IHD of the product. After decarboxylation and aldehyde reduction, the molecule retains the cyclohexane ring (1 DU) plus the two carbon–carbon double bonds (one in the ring and one in the vinyl substituent, 2 DUs), giving 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.

Step 4: Cross‐check with options. The calculated IHD of 3 matches choice B.

No other plausible pathway under red P/HI would leave more or fewer double bonds, so the unique consistent answer is B).

proposed answer: After reductive deoxygenation and decarboxylation by HI/red P, the product is a saturated cyclohexane ring with one methyl and one ethyl substituent (C9H18). IHD = (2×9+2–18)/2 = 1, accounting for the ring only. Among the choices (1, 3, 0, 5), 1 corresponds to choice A).
