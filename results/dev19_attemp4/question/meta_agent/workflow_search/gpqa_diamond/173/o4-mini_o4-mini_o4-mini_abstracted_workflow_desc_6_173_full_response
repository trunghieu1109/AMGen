Extract and Summarize Given Information:\n   • Initial nucleus: rest mass M, at rest, with rest‐mass energy E₀ = 300 GeV.\n   • Spontaneous fission produces exactly two fragments, no other particles.\n   • Fragment rest masses: m₁ and m₂, with m₁ = 2·m₂.\n   • Sum of fragment rest masses: m₁ + m₂ = 0.99·M.\n   • Define T₁ as the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (mass m₁).\n   • Numerical choices for the (relativistic vs nonrelativistic difference) are given: 2 MeV, 5 MeV, 10 MeV, 20 MeV.\n\n2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:\n   • Conservation laws: total energy (rest + kinetic) and momentum must be conserved in the CMS (initial nucleus at rest).\n   • Mass ratio constraint fixes m₁ and m₂ in terms of M:\n       m₂ = (1/3)·0.99\u2009M,  m₁ = (2/3)·0.99\u2009M.\n   • Excess rest‐mass energyΔm\u2009c² = (M – (m₁ + m₂))\u2009c² = 0.01\u2009M\u2009c² is converted into kinetic energy of the two fragments.\n   • Relativistic vs classical approximation: at these total energies (hundreds of GeV), fragment velocities may justify or breach the small‐v assumption of nonrelativistic KE = p²/(2m).\n   • The difference between the exact relativistic T₁ and the classical estimate arises from higher‐order terms in γ and p–E relations.\n\n3. Identify the Field of Study:\n   • Primary domain: special‐relativistic kinematics in particle/nuclear physics.\n   • Subfields: two‐body decay kinematics, energy–momentum conservation, relativistic kinetic energy formulas.\n   • Contexts: high‐energy nuclear reactions, fission fragment distributions in accelerator or astrophysical settings, physics competition problems.\n\n4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:\n   • Frame choice: assumed center‐of‐mass frame since the initial nucleus is at rest, but explicitly stating this avoids ambiguity.\n   • Labeling of fragments: ‘more massive’ vs ‘less massive’ should be tracked consistently when computing momenta and KE.\n   • Treatment of binding‐energy differences: rest‐mass deficit is small (1%), but exact distribution of Δm\u2009c² between fragments relies on momentum partition.\n   • Neglected effects: electromagnetic interactions between fragments immediately post‐scission, possible excitation energy, and electron clouds are ignored by instruction..These are just pieces of information related to the question.

It splits into two fragments with rest masses m₁ = (2/3)·0.99 M and m₂ = (1/3)·0.99 M. The total available kinetic energy is ΔE = [M – (m₁ + m₂)] c² = 0.01 M c² = 3 GeV. In the center‐of‐mass frame, momentum conservation gives p₁ = p₂ ≡ p. Relativistically, for fragment 1: E₁ = √(p²c² + m₁²c⁴) = γ₁ m₁c², so its kinetic energy is T₁_rel = E₁ – m₁c² = (γ₁ – 1)m₁c². Likewise for fragment 2. Meanwhile, energy conservation gives E₁ + E₂ = M c² = (m₁ + m₂)c² + ΔE. Using E₂ = √(p²c² + m₂²c⁴), solve for p by squaring and subtracting: E₁ + E₂ = (m₁ + m₂)c² + ΔE ⇒ (γ₁ m₁ + γ₂ m₂)c² = (m₁ + m₂)c² + ΔE. But momentum equality p = m₁γ₁v₁ = m₂γ₂v₂ gives a relation between γ’s. The exact solution yields p²c² = [ΔE² + 2ΔE(m₁ + m₂)c²]·(m₁²m₂²)/( (m₁ + m₂)² ). One then substitutes back into T₁_rel = √(p²c² + m₁²c⁴) – m₁c². For the classical (nonrelativistic) approximation one assumes p ≪ m₁c, p²/(2m₁) ≪ m₁c², so T₁_nr = p²/(2m₁). But p² = 2μ·ΔE·(m₁ + m₂) where μ = m₁m₂/(m₁ + m₂) is the reduced mass. Thus T₁_nr = μ·ΔE/m₁. Numerically, μ = (m₁m₂)/(m₁ + m₂) = ( (2/3·0.99M)(1/3·0.99M) )/(0.99M) = (2/9·0.99M). So T₁_nr = (2/9·0.99M)/(2/3·0.99M)·3 GeV = (2/9)/(2/3)·3 GeV = (1/3)·3 GeV = 1 GeV. The actual velocity β₁ ≈ sqrt(2T₁_nr/(m₁c²)) ≈ sqrt(2 GeV/(0.66·300 GeV)) ≈ 0.10.

It splits into two fragments of rest masses m1 and m2 with m1=2\u2009m2 and m1+m2=0.99\u2009M. The mass deficit Δm= M−(m1+m2)=0.01\u2009M provides total kinetic energy ΔE=Δm\u2009c^2=0.01×300\u2009GeV=3\u2009GeV.\n\nRelativistic two‐body kinematics gives the heavy‐fragment energy\n  E1= (M^2 + m1^2 − m2^2)/(2\u2009M)\u2009c^2.\nSubtracting its rest‐energy m1\u2009c^2 yields\n  T1_rel = E1 − m1\u2009c^2 = [ (M^2 + m1^2 − m2^2)/(2\u2009M) − m1 ] c^2.\nClassically, the kinetic energy is\n  T1_nr = p^2/(2\u2009m1),\nwith p fixed by momentum conservation. Equivalently for small velocities in a share‐of‐energy picture,\n  T1_nr = ΔE × (m2/(m1+m2)).\n\nSubstitute m1=0.66\u2009M, m2=0.33\u2009M:\n  (M^2 + m1^2 − m2^2)/(2M) = (1 +0.4356 −0.1089)/2 ×M =0.66335\u2009M,\n  T1_rel = (0.66335 −0.66)\u2009M\u2009c^2 =0.00335×300\u2009GeV ≃1.005\u2009GeV.\n  T1_nr =3\u2009GeV×(0.33/0.99)=1.000\u2009GeV.\n\nDifference ΔT = T1_rel − T1_nr ≃0.005\u2009GeV =5\u2009MeV.\nThus the correct choice is B).; answer: B)\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent RbC4, thinking: We have an initial nucleus at rest with M c²=300 GeV. It splits into two fragments with m₁=2 m₂, and m₁+m₂=0.99 M ⇒ m₂=0.33 M, m₁=0.66 M. The mass deficit Δm=0.01 M gives total kinetic Q=0.01×300 GeV=3 GeV. \n\nRelativistic result: In the CM frame, fragment energies are E₁=(M²+m₁²−m₂²)/(2M)c². Writing masses as fractions of M: m₁=0.66 M, m₂=0.33 M, so (1+0.66²−0.33²)/2=0.66335 ⇒ E₁=0.66335×300 GeV=199.005 GeV. Then T₁_rel=E₁−m₁c²=199.005−198=1.005 GeV. \n\nNonrelativistic approximation: The two fragments share Q inversely to their masses: T₁_nr=Q×(m₂/(m₁+m₂))=3 GeV×(0.33/0.99)=1.000 GeV. \n\nDifference ΔT₁=T₁_rel−T₁_nr=1.005 GeV−1.000 GeV=0.005 GeV=5 MeV. \n\nThus the numeric values are T₁_rel≈1.005 GeV, T₁_nr≈1.000 GeV, ΔT₁≈0.005 GeV (5 MeV), matching choice B).; answer: B)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCritic agent mzxy, feedback: The solution correctly applies conservation of energy and momentum for a two-body decay in the center-of-mass frame, uses the exact relativistic expression E1=(M^2+m1^2−m2^2)/(2M), and compares it to the nonrelativistic share T1_nr=Q·m2/(m1+m2). Numerical substitution (M=300 GeV/c^2, m1=0.66 M, m2=0.33 M, Q=3 GeV) yields T1_rel≈1.005 GeV and T1_nr=1.000 GeV, so ΔT≈5 MeV. The arithmetic and physics are consistent, and the chosen answer (5 MeV) is correct.; correct: True', iteration_idx=0)]
