Question: Example(question='An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. A spontaneous fission occurs in which it splits into two fragments (and nothing else), such that one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other (in terms of their rest-masses). The sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. \n\nKinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?\n\n(Ignore the electrons.)', choice1='10 MeV.', choice2='5 MeV.', choice3='2 MeV.', choice4='20 MeV.', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: We have an initial nucleus at rest with M c²=300 GeV. It splits into two fragments with m₁=2 m₂, and m₁+m₂=0.99 M ⇒ m₂=0.33 M, m₁=0.66 M. The mass deficit Δm=0.01 M gives total kinetic Q=0.01×300 GeV=3 GeV. 

Relativistic result: In the CM frame, fragment energies are E₁=(M²+m₁²−m₂²)/(2M)c². Writing masses as fractions of M: m₁=0.66 M, m₂=0.33 M, so (1+0.66²−0.33²)/2=0.66335 ⇒ E₁=0.66335×300 GeV=199.005 GeV. Then T₁_rel=E₁−m₁c²=199.005−198=1.005 GeV. 

Nonrelativistic approximation: The two fragments share Q inversely to their masses: T₁_nr=Q×(m₂/(m₁+m₂))=3 GeV×(0.33/0.99)=1.000 GeV. 

Difference ΔT₁=T₁_rel−T₁_nr=1.005 GeV−1.000 GeV=0.005 GeV=5 MeV. 

Thus the numeric values are T₁_rel≈1.005 GeV, T₁_nr≈1.000 GeV, ΔT₁≈0.005 GeV (5 MeV), matching choice B).
