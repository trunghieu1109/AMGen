proposed answer: 1. Compute apparent V magnitudes for each star:
   a) Canopus: m_V ≈ –0.70 (catalog).
   b) Polaris: m_V ≈ +1.98 (catalog).
   c) M_V=15 at 10 pc: m_V = 15 + 5 log10(10/10) = 15.00.
   d) M_V=15 at 200 pc: m_V = 15 + 5 log10(200/10) ≈ 21.51.
   e) M_V=15 at 5 pc: m_V = 15 + 5 log10(5/10) ≈ 13.50.
   f) M_V=15 at 50 pc: m_V = 15 + 5 log10(50/10) ≈ 18.50.

2. Adopt an empirical S/N scaling for ESPRESSO on one VLT 8 m in a 1 h exposure:
   S/N(V) ≈ 260 × 10^(–0.2 × (V – 8)).
   (Matches S/N≈100 at V=8 on a 3.6 m, scaled by √(8²/3.6²)≈2.65.)

3. Calculate S/N for each star:
   a) V=–0.70: S/N ≈ 260×10^(–0.2×(–8.70)) ≈ 14 300.
   b) V=+1.98: S/N ≈ 260×10^(–0.2×(–6.02)) ≈ 4 100.
   c) V=15.00: S/N ≈ 260×10^(–0.2×7.00) ≈ 10.4.
   d) V=21.51: S/N ≈ 260×10^(–0.2×13.51) ≈ 0.5.
   e) V=13.50: S/N ≈ 260×10^(–0.2×5.50) ≈ 20.5.
   f) V=18.50: S/N ≈ 260×10^(–0.2×10.50) ≈ 2.1.

4. Apply detectability criterion (S/N ≥ 10):
   Detectable: a, b, c, e → 4 stars.
   Non-detectable: d, f → 2 stars.

5. Total detectable stars = 4, corresponding to choice A).

proposed answer: We have the validated 1 h S/N≥10 limit at mV,lim≈16.6 mag for ESPRESSO on an 8 m VLT. Compute apparent magnitudes: 1) Canopus mV≈–0.7 mag (<16.6) → detectable. 2) Polaris mV≈+1.98 mag (<16.6) → detectable. 3) M_V=15 mag at 5 pc: mV=15+5 log10(5/10)=13.5 mag (<16.6) → detectable. 4) M_V=15 mag at 10 pc: mV=15.0 mag (<16.6) → detectable. 5) M_V=15 mag at 50 pc: mV=15+5 log10(50/10)=18.5 mag (>16.6) → not detectable. 6) M_V=15 mag at 200 pc: mV≈21.5 mag (>16.6) → not detectable. Total detectable = 4.
