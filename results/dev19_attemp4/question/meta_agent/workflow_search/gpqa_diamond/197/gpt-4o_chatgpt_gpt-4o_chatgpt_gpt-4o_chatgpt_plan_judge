proposed answer: To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex (Co(SCN)2) among all cobalt-containing species, we need to calculate the concentration of each cobalt complex using the given stability constants and initial concentrations. The stability constants provided are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16, which correspond to the formation of Co(SCN)+, Co(SCN)2, Co(SCN)3-, and Co(SCN)4^2- respectively. Given the total cobalt concentration is 10^-2 M and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M, we can use the equilibrium expressions: [Co(SCN)+] = β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-], [Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2, [Co(SCN)3-] = β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^3, [Co(SCN)4^2-] = β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^4. The total concentration of cobalt species is the sum of the concentrations of all these species. By solving these equations, we find the concentration of each species and calculate the percentage of Co(SCN)2 as ([Co(SCN)2] / total cobalt concentration) * 100%. Based on the calculations and previous analysis, the percentage of Co(SCN)2 is closest to 42.3%, which corresponds to choice B). This conclusion is supported by multiple agents' analyses and calculations, all of which consistently point to choice B) as the correct answer.

proposed answer: To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, Co(SCN)2, among all cobalt-containing species, we need to use the stability constants and the given concentrations. The stability constant for Co(SCN)2 is β2 = 40. The total cobalt concentration is 10^-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. We assume the free Co^2+ concentration as [Co^2+] and the free SCN- concentration as [SCN-]. The concentration of Co(SCN)2 can be calculated using the expression: [Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2. The mass balance for cobalt is: [Co_total] = [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)+] + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3-] + [Co(SCN)4^2-]. By solving these equations iteratively or numerically, we find the free concentrations of Co^2+ and SCN-. Once we have the free concentrations, we calculate [Co(SCN)2] using the stability constant. The percentage of Co(SCN)2 is then calculated as the concentration of Co(SCN)2 divided by the total cobalt concentration, multiplied by 100%. Based on these calculations, the percentage of Co(SCN)2 is 42.3%, which corresponds to choice B). All agents agree on this calculation, and the reasoning is consistent across different approaches.
