Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Final Decision Agent gjwt', content='To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, Co(SCN)2, among all cobalt-containing species, we need to use the stability constants and the given concentrations. The stability constant for Co(SCN)2 is β2 = 40. The total cobalt concentration is 10^-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. We assume the free Co^2+ concentration as [Co^2+] and the free SCN- concentration as [SCN-]. The concentration of Co(SCN)2 can be calculated using the expression: [Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2. The mass balance for cobalt is: [Co_total] = [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)+] + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3-] + [Co(SCN)4^2-]. By solving these equations iteratively or numerically, we find the free concentrations of Co^2+ and SCN-. Once we have the free concentrations, we calculate [Co(SCN)2] using the stability constant. The percentage of Co(SCN)2 is then calculated as the concentration of Co(SCN)2 divided by the total cobalt concentration, multiplied by 100%.
