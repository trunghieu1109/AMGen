Question: Example(question='We have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate, where the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M and the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16. What will be the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species in the solution? ', choice1='16.9%', choice2='42.3%', choice3='25.6%', choice4='38.1%', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: To identify the closest choice for the fraction α₂ = [Co(SCN)₂]/[Co]ₜ, we first compute the distribution coefficient using standard speciation formulas.  

1. Write the general expression for α₂:
   α₂ = β₂·[L]² / (1 + β₁·[L] + β₂·[L]² + β₃·[L]³ + β₄·[L]⁴),
   where [L] = [SCN⁻] = 0.10 M.  

2. Calculate each term:
   • β₁·[L]   = 9 × 0.10   = 0.90  
   • β₂·[L]² = 40 × 0.01   = 0.40  
   • β₃·[L]³ = 63 × 0.001  = 0.063 
   • β₄·[L]⁴ = 16 × 0.0001 = 0.0016

3. Sum to find the denominator D:
   D = 1 + 0.90 + 0.40 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646

4. Compute α₂:
   α₂ = 0.40 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.1692 → 16.92%

5. Compare with the provided choices:
   A) 16.9%  B) 42.3%  C) 25.6%  D) 38.1%
   The calculated 16.92% is essentially identical to 16.9% and is much closer than any other option.

Therefore, the best match is choice A).
