proposed answer: The pp-III branch of solar nuclear reactions is responsible for producing high-energy neutrinos, particularly those associated with the decay of boron-8. These neutrinos can have energies extending into the MeV range, which includes the 800-900 keV band. If the pp-III branch is stopped, the production of these high-energy neutrinos would be significantly reduced. The 800-900 keV band is more likely to be populated by neutrinos from the pp-III branch compared to the 700-800 keV band. Therefore, stopping the pp-III branch would lead to a larger decrease in the neutrino flux in the 800-900 keV band than in the 700-800 keV band. As a result, the ratio of flux (band 1) / flux (band 2) would increase, as the flux in band 2 decreases more than in band 1. This leads to the conclusion that the ratio would be greater than 1. The most consistent answer is that the ratio is 10, indicating a significant decrease in the flux of the higher energy band (800-900 keV) compared to the lower energy band (700-800 keV).

proposed answer: The question involves understanding the impact of stopping the pp-III branch on the neutrino flux in two specific energy bands: 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV. The pp-III branch is primarily responsible for producing high-energy neutrinos, typically above 1 MeV, due to reactions involving Beryllium-8 and Boron-8. The energy bands in question, 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV, are lower than 1 MeV and are more likely influenced by the pp-I and pp-II branches, which produce lower energy neutrinos. Stopping the pp-III branch would primarily affect the flux of neutrinos in the higher energy range (above 1 MeV), while the flux in the 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV bands would remain largely unchanged. Since both bands are similarly unaffected by the stoppage of the pp-III branch, the ratio of flux (band 1) / flux (band 2) would remain approximately the same. Therefore, the most consistent answer is that the ratio is likely to be 1.
