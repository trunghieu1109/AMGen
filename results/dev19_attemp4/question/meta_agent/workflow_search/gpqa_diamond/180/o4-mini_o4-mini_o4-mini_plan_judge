Question: Example(question='Very large number of neutrinos produced by the Sun reach the Earth (very large flux of neutrinos, defined as the number of neutrinos per cm^2, per second).\n\nLet us assume that, hypothetically, the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the core of the Sun about 8 and a half minutes ago, while all other reactions remained as they were.\n\nWhat would be the approximate ratio of the flux between two bands of neutrino energies of 700-800 KeV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). \n\nFlux (band 1) / flux (band 2) is:\n\n(Note: we are talking about stopping the pp-III branch, not pp-II, pp-I or any other. It’s not a typo or something like that.)\n(Note 2: solar neutrino flavor changes happen, but do not play a role here.)', choice1='0.1 (10^-1).', choice2='10.', choice3='1.', choice4='0.01 (10^-2).', correct_index=4)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_16_180
proposed answer: Step 1: Identify contributions after pp-III shutdown:
• pp-I neutrinos end at 420 keV → no contribution to 700–800 keV or 800–900 keV bands.
• pp-II (⁷Be) yields a monoenergetic 862 keV line → entirely in the 800–900 keV band; zero in 700–800 keV.
• pp-III (⁸B) continuum neutrinos → turned off, so no contribution in either band.
• CNO and hep neutrinos → small continuous background, ≤10⁸ cm⁻² s⁻¹ spread over 0–1.2 MeV; only source remaining in 700–800 keV, and adds at most ~10⁸ cm⁻² s⁻¹ to the 800–900 keV band.

Step 2: Compute post-shutdown fluxes:
• Flux(700–800 keV) ≲1×10⁸ cm⁻² s⁻¹ (only CNO+hep).
• Flux(800–900 keV) ≈5×10⁹ cm⁻² s⁻¹ (7Be) +1×10⁸ cm⁻² s⁻¹ (CNO+hep) ≃5.1×10⁹ cm⁻² s⁻¹.

Step 3: Form the ratio:
Flux(700–800)/Flux(800–900) ≲(1×10⁸)/(5.1×10⁹) ≃0.02.

Step 4: Compare to choices {0.01, 0.1, 1, 10}:
0.02 is closest to 0.01 (10⁻²).

Conclusion: The best-matching choice is D).
