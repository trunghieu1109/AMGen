Question: Example(question='In a specific region of the sky, astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?', choice1='~ r^2', choice2='~ r^4', choice3='~ r^3', choice4='~ r^5', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: We start with the given star count per unit parallax: N(plx) ∝ 1 / plx^5. In astronomy, stellar parallax plx and distance r are related by plx ∝ 1/r, so plx = k/r where k is a constant.  

Step 1: Express N in terms of r.  Substitute plx = k/r into N(plx):
   N(plx) ∝ 1/(k/r)^5 = r^5 / k^5 ∝ r^5.  

Step 2: Relate differentials to convert from per unit parallax to per unit distance. The number of stars in the interval dr is N(r) dr, which must equal N(plx) d(plx). Thus:
   N(r) dr = N(plx) · |d(plx)/dr| dr.  

Step 3: Compute the Jacobian |d(plx)/dr|. From plx = k/r, we get d(plx)/dr = -k / r^2, so |d(plx)/dr| = k / r^2 ∝ 1 / r^2.  

Step 4: Multiply the two r-dependent factors to get N(r):
   N(r) ∝ (r^5) · (1 / r^2) = r^(5 - 2) = r^3.  

Therefore, the number of stars per unit distance scales as r^3, matching choice C).
