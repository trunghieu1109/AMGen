proposed answer: The problem states that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. Parallax (plx) is related to distance (r) by the inverse relationship: plx = 1/r. This is a standard relationship in astronomy, where parallax is used to measure distances to stars. Given the relationship N(plx) = 1/plx^5, we can substitute plx = 1/r to express the number of stars as a function of distance. Substituting, we get N(r) = 1/(1/r)^5 = r^5. This means the number of stars is proportional to the fifth power of the distance. Therefore, as distance increases, the number of stars increases with r^5. This is a direct and clear relationship derived from the given information.

proposed answer: The problem involves determining how the number of stars varies with distance when given a relationship with parallax. We start with the given relationship: the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. Parallax (plx) is related to distance (r) by the inverse relationship: plx = 1/r. Therefore, the number of stars as a function of distance is initially N(r) = 1/(1/r)^5 = r^5. However, to find the number of stars per unit range of distance, we need to consider the change of variables from parallax to distance. This involves using the Jacobian of the transformation. The Jacobian is the derivative of plx with respect to r, which is d(plx)/dr = -1/r^2. The density function in terms of distance is then adjusted by multiplying by the absolute value of the Jacobian: N(r) = N(plx) * |d(plx)/dr| = r^5 * (1/r^2) = r^3. This means the number of stars per unit distance varies as r^3. Therefore, the correct choice is C) ~ r^3.
