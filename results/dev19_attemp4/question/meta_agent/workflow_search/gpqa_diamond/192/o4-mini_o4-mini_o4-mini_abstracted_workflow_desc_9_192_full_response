Extract and Summarize Given Information:\n   • The observed quantity: number density of stars (per unit parallax) varies as 1/plx^5.\n   • Variables:\n     – plx: parallax (angular measurement of stellar displacement).\n     – r: distance (inverse relation to parallax).\n   • Provided answer choices for how number per unit distance scales: ~ r^2, r^3, r^4, or r^5.\n\n2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:\n   • Parallax–Distance Relation: plx ∝ 1/r (astronomical standard: plx in arcseconds, r in parsecs).\n   • Change-of-variables: N(plx) d(plx) corresponds to N(r) d(r) via d(plx)/d(r).\n   • Constraints: the power-law behaviour in parallax imposes a corresponding power law in r; sign of derivative influences the mapping between intervals.\n   • Hypothesis: the steep dependence 1/plx^5 combined with plx ∝ r^{-1} will yield a positive power of r in the expression for N(r).\n\n3.

Step 2: relate differential elements: N(r)dr=N(plx)|d(plx)| so N(r)=N(plx)·|d(plx)/dr|.  Since plx=k/r, d(plx)/dr=–k/r², so |d(plx)/dr|=k/r².  Step 3: multiply: N(r)∝r⁵·(1/r²)=r³.  Thus the number of stars per unit distance scales as r³, matching choice C).\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent nG3w:\n1. We are given N(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5, where plx is the stellar parallax.  2. In astronomy, distance r (in parsecs) is related to parallax by plx ∝ 1/r.  Thus plx = k/r for some constant k (we can absorb k into proportionality constants).  3. To find N(r) per unit distance, we perform a change of variables from plx to r.  The relation between differential counts is N(r)dr = N(plx)d(plx).  4. We have N(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5 ⇒ substitute plx = k/r ⇒ N(plx) ∝ r^5.  5. Compute the Jacobian: d(plx)/dr = d(k/r)/dr = −k/r^2.  The magnitude |d(plx)/dr| ∝ 1/r^2.  6. Then N(r) = N(plx)·|d(plx)/dr| ∝ r^5·(1/r^2) = r^3.  7. Therefore the number of stars per unit distance scales as r^3, matching choice “~ r^3.”\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent T1Of:\n1. We are given that the number of stars per unit parallax scales as N(plx)∝1/plx^5.\n2. The parallax–distance relation is plx=k/r (where k is a constant of proportionality), so plx∝1/r.\n3. To find the number per unit distance, N(r), we use the change of variables formula: N(r)dr = N(plx)·|d(plx)/dr| dr.\n4. Compute N(plx) in terms of r: N(plx)∝(plx)^{-5} = (k/r)^{-5} = r^5/k^5.\n5. Compute the Jacobian: |d(plx)/dr| = |d(k/r)/dr| = k/r^2.\n6. Multiply: N(r)∝(r^5/k^5)·(k/r^2) = r^5·k/(k^5·r^2) = (1/k^4)·r^3, so N(r)∝r^3.\n7. Therefore, among the choices ~r^2, ~r^3, ~r^4, ~r^5, the correct scaling is ~r^3.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent GX9C:\nWe start from the observed distribution per unit parallax: N(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5.\n\n1.

The four answer choices for how the number per unit distance scales with r are: ~r^2, ~r^3, ~r^4, and ~r^5.\n\nSince in astronomy plx and distance are inversely related (plx ∝ 1/r), we set plx = 1/r (up to a constant factor).

Among the three candidate summaries, M5uW (choice B) precisely states “plx ∝ 1/r” and lists only the four answer options, without extraneous derivations. It cleanly captures the required relation. The standard relation is plx=k/r (so plx∝1/r).

To find the differential mapping, we write plx = k·r⁻¹ for some constant k.  Differentiating both sides with respect to r gives d(plx) = k·(–1)·r⁻²·dr = –k·r⁻²·dr.  Since k is just a proportionality constant, we have d(plx) ∝ –1/r² · dr.  This mapping shows that a small change in distance corresponds to a change in parallax scaled by 1/r² (with a negative sign indicating plx decreases as r increases).; answer: plx ∝ 1/r;  d(plx) = –1/r² · d(r)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent FATV, thinking: To transform N(plx)∝1/plx^5 into N(r), substitute plx=k/r.
