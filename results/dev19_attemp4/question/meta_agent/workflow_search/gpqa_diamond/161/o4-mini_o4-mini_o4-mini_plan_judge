proposed answer: We have the metric ds² = (32/(4 − x² − y²))(dx² + dy²) on the coordinate disk x² + y² < 4. The area element is √det(g)
 = 32/(4 − r²) in polar coordinates (r, θ), with r² = x² + y². Thus the total area A is

 A = ∬_{r<2} (32/(4 − r²)) r dr dθ
   = 2π · ∫₀² (32 r/(4 − r²)) dr
   = 64π ∫₀² (r/(4 − r²)) dr.

To check convergence, examine the integrand near the upper limit r → 2⁻. Set ε = 2 − r, so r = 2 − ε → 2 and

 4 − r² = 4 − (2 − ε)² = 4 − (4 − 4ε + ε²) = 4ε − ε² ≈ 4ε for small ε.

Hence

 r/(4 − r²) ≈ 2/(4ε) = 1/(2ε),  and dr = −dε.

Therefore near ε → 0⁺,

 ∫ r/(4 − r²) dr ≈ ∫ [1/(2ε)] (−dε) = (1/2) ∫ dε/ε,

which diverges logarithmically as ε → 0. Multiplying by the finite constant 64π does not remove this divergence. Thus A = +∞.

Among the choices, +∞ corresponds to choice A).
