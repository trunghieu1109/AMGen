proposed answer: The metric given is ds^2 = \frac{32}{(4-x^2-y^2)}(dx^2 + dy^2), which suggests a surface with constant negative curvature, typical of hyperbolic geometry. The constraint 4-x^2-y^2 < 0 implies a disk of radius 2 in the xy-plane. In hyperbolic geometry, surfaces like the pseudosphere can have infinite area due to their nature of extending infinitely. The metric is conformal to the Euclidean metric with a factor \frac{32}{(4-x^2-y^2)}, which diverges as x^2 + y^2 approaches 4, indicating the area is infinite. Therefore, the area of the pseudosphere is +\infty.
