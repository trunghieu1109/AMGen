proposed answer: 1. The spheroidal charge distribution is small compared to the radiation wavelength and oscillates along the z-axis, so its far-field emission is dominated by an electric dipole term.  
2. Electric dipole radiation has an angular intensity pattern proportional to sin²θ, which is zero on the axis (θ=0°) and maximal at θ=90°.  
3. The problem defines A as the maximum of f(λ,θ), so at θ=90° we have f(λ,90°)=A. Thus we can write f(λ,θ)=A·sin²θ·g(λ)/g(λ), and g(λ) is normalized so that the peak already carries the λ-dependence.  
4. The fraction of the peak radiated at θ=30° is sin²30°=(1/2)²=1/4.  
5. Classical electric dipole radiated power scales like the square of the dipole’s second time derivative, ∝ω⁴. Since ω=2πc/λ, this gives a λ⁻⁴ dependence.  
6. Therefore, f(λ,θ)∝sin²θ·λ⁻⁴, yielding 1/4 of the maximum at θ=30° and a λ⁻⁴ scaling.  
7. Among the given choices, only C) “1/4, λ⁻⁴” matches both the angular fraction and the wavelength dependence.

proposed answer: 1. In the far‐field zone, an oscillating spheroidal charge along the z–axis behaves like an electric dipole oriented along z.
2. The instantaneous dipole moment p̈ oscillates at angular frequency ω, so the power radiated per unit solid angle scales as |p̈|² sin²θ ∝ ω⁴ sin²θ.
3. Since ω=2πc/λ, ω⁴∝1/λ⁴, hence f(λ,θ)∝(1/λ⁴) sin²θ.
4. The maximum of sin²θ is unity at θ=90°, so A≡max₍θ₎f(λ,θ)∝1/λ⁴.
5. The normalized angular pattern is f(λ,θ)/A=sin²θ. At θ=30°, sin²30°=(1/2)²=1/4.
6. Thus f(λ,30°)/A=1/4 and the wavelength dependence is λ⁻⁴.
7. Comparing with the four choices: only option C) gives (1/4, λ^(−4)).
