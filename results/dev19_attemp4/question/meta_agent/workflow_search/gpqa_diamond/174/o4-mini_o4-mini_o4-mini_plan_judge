proposed answer: 1. The spheroidal charge distribution is small compared to the radiation wavelength and oscillates along the z-axis, so its far-field emission is dominated by an electric dipole term.  
2. Electric dipole radiation has an angular intensity pattern proportional to sin²θ, which is zero on the axis (θ=0°) and maximal at θ=90°.  
3. The problem defines A as the maximum of f(λ,θ), so at θ=90° we have f(λ,90°)=A. Thus we can write f(λ,θ)=A·sin²θ·g(λ)/g(λ), and g(λ) is normalized so that the peak already carries the λ-dependence.  
4. The fraction of the peak radiated at θ=30° is sin²30°=(1/2)²=1/4.  
5. Classical electric dipole radiated power scales like the square of the dipole’s second time derivative, ∝ω⁴. Since ω=2πc/λ, this gives a λ⁻⁴ dependence.  
6. Therefore, f(λ,θ)∝sin²θ·λ⁻⁴, yielding 1/4 of the maximum at θ=30° and a λ⁻⁴ scaling.  
7. Among the given choices, only C) “1/4, λ⁻⁴” matches both the angular fraction and the wavelength dependence.

proposed answer: 1. In the far‐field zone, an oscillating spheroidal charge along the z–axis behaves like an electric dipole oriented along z.
2. The instantaneous dipole moment p̈ oscillates at angular frequency ω, so the power radiated per unit solid angle scales as |p̈|² sin²θ ∝ ω⁴ sin²θ.
3. Since ω=2πc/λ, ω⁴∝1/λ⁴, hence f(λ,θ)∝(1/λ⁴) sin²θ.
4. The maximum of sin²θ is unity at θ=90°, so A≡max₍θ₎f(λ,θ)∝1/λ⁴.
5. The normalized angular pattern is f(λ,θ)/A=sin²θ. At θ=30°, sin²30°=(1/2)²=1/4.
6. Thus f(λ,30°)/A=1/4 and the wavelength dependence is λ⁻⁴.
7. Comparing with the four choices: only option C) gives (1/4, λ^(−4)).

proposed answer: 1. The far-field radiation pattern of an oscillating charge distribution aligned along the z-axis is that of an electric dipole, with intensity per unit solid angle I(θ)∝sin²θ and peaking at θ=90°, where sin²90°=1.  
2. Define A as the maximum radiated power per unit solid angle, i.e. A=I(90°). At θ=30°, sin30°=1/2 so I(30°)=sin²30°·A=(1/2)²·A=1/4·A. Hence the fraction f(30°)/A=1/4.  
3. The power radiated by an oscillating dipole scales as the square of the second time derivative of the dipole moment: P∝|p̈|²∝ω⁴. Since ω=2πc/λ, we have P∝λ⁻⁴. Thus the angular distribution per unit solid angle carries a λ⁻⁴ dependence.  
4. Comparing with the provided options, only choice C) gives the pair (1/4, λ⁻⁴).

proposed answer: Step 1: Identify the dominant radiation mechanism. A small oscillating spheroidal charge distribution with a net dipole moment radiates predominantly as an electric dipole in the far field.

Step 2: Determine the angular dependence. The power per unit solid angle for an electric dipole varies as sin²θ, where θ is measured from the dipole (z) axis.

Step 3: Normalize the pattern. The maximum power A occurs at θ=90°, since sin²(90°)=1. Thus f_max=A.

Step 4: Compute the fraction at θ=30°. We have sin²(30°)=(1/2)²=1/4, so f(30°)=A×1/4, giving the fraction f(30°)/A=1/4.

Step 5: Find the wavelength dependence. The dipole power scales as the square of the second time derivative of the dipole moment: P∝|p̈|²∝ω⁴. With ω=2πc/λ, we get P∝λ^(−4).

Step 6: Combine results. The full form is f(λ,θ)∝λ^(−4) sin²θ, normalized to A at θ=90°. Hence at θ=30° the fraction is 1/4 and the λ dependence is λ^(−4).

Step 7: Match to choices. Among the given options:
 1) 1/2, λ^(−4)
 2) 3/4, λ^(−6)
 3) 1/4, λ^(−4)
 4) 1/4, λ^(−3)
Only option 3 matches 1/4 and λ^(−4), which corresponds to choice C).
