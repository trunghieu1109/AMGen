Question: Example(question='The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1). An observable of the system is represented by the matrix operator P having elements in the first row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0),  in the second row as (1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}) and in the third row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0). Calculate the probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 at time t.', choice1='1/3\n', choice2='2/3\n', choice3='\\sqrt{2/3}\n', choice4='1', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: Step 1: Recall from Sub-task 1 the normalized state vector
ψₙ = (–1/√6, 2/√6, 1/√6)ᵀ.

Step 2: Recall from Sub-task 3 the projector onto the zero‐eigenvalue subspace of P:
Π₀ = |u₀⟩⟨u₀|, where u₀ = (1/√2)(1, 0, –1)ᵀ.
Explicitly,
Π₀ = \begin{pmatrix} 1/2 & 0 & –1/2 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ –1/2 & 0 & 1/2 \end{pmatrix}.

Step 3: Compute the projection of ψₙ:
Π₀ ψₙ = u₀⟨u₀|ψₙ⟩.
First compute the overlap ⟨u₀|ψₙ⟩:
⟨u₀|ψₙ⟩ = (1/√2)[(1)(–1/√6) + (0)(2/√6) + (–1)(1/√6)]
           = (1/√2)(–1/√6 – 1/√6)
           = –2/(√2·√6)
           = –1/√3.

Step 4: The projected vector is (–1/√3)·u₀. Its norm squared is |–1/√3|² · ∥u₀∥² = (1/3)·1 = 1/3, since u₀ is normalized.

Therefore, the probability of measuring the eigenvalue 0 is 1/3.
