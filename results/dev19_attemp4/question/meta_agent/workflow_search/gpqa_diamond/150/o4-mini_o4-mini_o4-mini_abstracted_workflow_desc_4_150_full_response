Extract and Summarize Given Information:\n   - State vector at time t: a column matrix ψ = (–1, 2, 1)ᵀ.\n   - Observable operator P represented by a 3×3 matrix with rows:\n       • Row 1: (0, 1/√2, 0)\n       • Row 2: (1/√2, 0, 1/√2)\n       • Row 3: (0, 1/√2, 0)\n   - The measurement in question: probability that the outcome equals 0.\n   - Four candidate probabilities provided: 1/3, 2/3, √(2/3), 1.\n\n2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:\n   - The state vector ψ may need normalization before computing probabilities.\n   - The operator P has eigenvalues, one of which is 0; the corresponding eigenspace determines the event “measurement yields 0.”\n   - Probability = ∥projection of ψ onto the zero‐eigenvalue subspace∥² / ∥ψ∥².  Constraints: orthonormality of eigenvectors, completeness of projector decomposition.\n   - The structure of P (symmetric matrix with identical off‐diagonal entries in row 2) suggests degeneracy or simple eigenvector patterns.\n\n3. Identify the Field of Study:\n   - Domain: Quantum mechanics (quantum measurement theory) formulated via linear algebra.\n   - Subfields/concepts: finite‐dimensional Hilbert spaces, eigenvalue problems, projection operators, normalization of state vectors.\n   - Applications: quantum computing, spectroscopy, foundational quantum theory, problems in physics competitions.\n\n4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:\n   - Is the given state vector already normalized or must it be normalized first?  \n   - Does P have exactly one zero eigenvalue or a degenerate zero eigenspace of dimension >1?  \n   - Are there any phase conventions or basis‐ordering assumptions implicit in the matrix representation?  \n   - Confirmation of real versus complex entries (here all are real) and whether orthonormality is assumed for the eigenbasis..These are just pieces of information related to the question.
