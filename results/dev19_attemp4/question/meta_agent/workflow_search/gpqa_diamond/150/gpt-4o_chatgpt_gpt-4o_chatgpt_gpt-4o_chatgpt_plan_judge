Question: Example(question='The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1). An observable of the system is represented by the matrix operator P having elements in the first row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0),  in the second row as (1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}) and in the third row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0). Calculate the probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 at time t.', choice1='1/3\n', choice2='2/3\n', choice3='\\sqrt{2/3}\n', choice4='1', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: To finalize the probability calculation, we need to project the state vector onto the eigenspace corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 and compute the probability of measuring this eigenvalue. The state vector is given as \((-1, 2, 1)\) and the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 is \((1, 0, -1)\). The projection of the state vector onto this eigenvector is calculated using the formula: \( \text{Proj}_{v}(u) = \frac{u \cdot v}{v \cdot v} v \), where \( u \) is the state vector and \( v \) is the eigenvector. Calculating, we find \( u \cdot v = (-1)(1) + (2)(0) + (1)(-1) = -2 \) and \( v \cdot v = (1)(1) + (0)(0) + (-1)(-1) = 2 \). Therefore, the projection is \( \frac{-2}{2} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \). The probability of measuring the eigenvalue 0 is the square of the magnitude of this projection divided by the square of the magnitude of the original state vector. The magnitude of the projection is \( \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 0^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{2} \) and the magnitude of the state vector is \( \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6} \). Thus, the probability is \( \left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{6}}\right)^2 = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3} \). All agents agree on this calculation, and the final answer is A).
