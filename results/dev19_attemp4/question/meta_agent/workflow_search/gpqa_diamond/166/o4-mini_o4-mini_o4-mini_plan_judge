proposed answer: 1. The non-Gaussianity measure is defined as Δ_b = Tr[ρ lnρ] − Tr[τ lnτ].  2. The Schrödinger cat state ρ = |ψ〉〈ψ| is a pure state, so its von Neumann entropy S(ρ) = −Tr[ρ lnρ] = 0, implying Tr[ρ lnρ] = 0.  3. Therefore Δ_b = 0 − Tr[τ lnτ] = −Tr[τ lnτ] = S(τ).  4. The reference Gaussian state τ is chosen to match the first and second moments of ρ.  5. For α = 0.5 and φ = −π/4 (the odd cat), one finds 〈a†a〉 ≈ 1.0213 and Re〈a²〉 ≈ 0.25.  6. The covariance matrix elements are V₁₁ = [1 + 2 Re〈a²〉 + 2〈a†a〉]/2 ≈ 1.7713, V₂₂ = [1 − 2 Re〈a²〉 + 2〈a†a〉]/2 ≈ 1.2713.  7. Then det V ≈ 2.2501, giving the symplectic eigenvalue ν = √(det V) ≈ 1.500.  8. The von Neumann entropy of τ is S(τ) = (ν + ½) ln(ν + ½) − (ν − ½) ln(ν − ½) = 2.0·ln2.0 − 1.0·ln1.0 ≈ 1.3863.  9. Hence Δ_b ≈ 1.3863, which rounds to 1.38, matching choice C).
