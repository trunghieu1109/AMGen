Extract and Summarize Given Information:\n   - Six aromatic substrates (numbered 1–6) all have the formula C6H5–X, where X is a substituent on the benzene ring:\n       1) C6H5–CH3 (toluene)\n       2) C6H5–COOC2H5 (ethyl benzoate)\n       3) C6H5–Cl (chlorobenzene)\n       4) C6H5–NO2 (nitrobenzene)\n       5) C6H5–C2H5 (ethylbenzene)\n       6) C6H5–COOH (benzoic acid)\n   - Each undergoes electrophilic aromatic substitution with excess Br2, producing exactly one monobrominated product per substrate.\n   - The task is to rank these substrates by increasing weight fraction (mass percentage) of the para-bromo isomer in the product mixture.\n   - Four candidate orderings are provided (choices 1–4).\n\n2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:\n   - Substituent effects on EAS regiochemistry: each X can be ortho/para-directing (electron-donating groups) or meta-directing (electron-withdrawing groups).\n   - Electron-donating substituents (e.g., –CH3, –C2H5) activate the ring and favor ortho/para substitution; electron-withdrawing substituents (–NO2, –COOC2H5, –COOH) deactivate and direct meta.\n   - Steric factors: ortho positions may be sterically hindered, often boosting the para fraction relative to ortho.\n   - Weight fraction of para isomer = (mass of para isomer)/(total mass of all monobromo isomers). Since all isomers share the same molecular formula when substituted by Br, mass ratios mirror mole fractions of para vs ortho vs meta.\n   - Thus, the stronger the para-directing influence (or steric hindrance at ortho), the higher the para mole fraction → higher weight fraction.\n\n3. Identify the Field of Study:\n   - Primary domain: Organic chemistry, specifically electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS).\n   - Subfields/concepts: Reaction mechanisms (activating/deactivating groups), regiochemistry, substituent effects (Hammett parameters), steric effects.\n   - Contexts: Reaction planning in synthetic organic chemistry, questions in academic exams or chemistry Olympiads.\n\n4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:\n   - "Only one monobromo derivative is formed" could be misread: it means that each substrate yields a single bromine addition, not that only one positional isomer forms—indeed, ortho/meta/para mixtures are presumed.\n   - Definition of "weight fraction of the yield": whether this is strictly mass percentage of para isomer or if yield refers to isolated product mass.\n   - Reaction conditions unspecified beyond "excess Br2": solvent, catalyst (FeBr3?), temperature, which can influence ortho/para ratio.\n   - Relative steric versus electronic contributions are not quantified; typical textbooks give empirical ortho:para ratios but exact numbers depend on conditions..These are just pieces of information related to the question. You are not required to answer the question — just follow what is defined in the instruction: Sub-task 4: Compare the derived ranking with the four provided choice sequences and select the matching one..   \n\nRelated sub-task questions and answers:\n\n### Sub-task 3: Synthesize and choose the most consistent computed weight fractions and ranking. \n\n ### thinking by Final Decision Agent 3NKk:\nWe need to rank the six substrates by their weight fraction of the para‐bromo isomer (which equals the mole fraction of para since all isomers have the same molar mass).
