Question: Example(question='Substances 1-6 undergo an electrophilic substitution reaction with an excess of bromine (it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed):\n1) С6H5-CH3\n2) C6H5-COOC2H5\n3) C6H5-Cl\n4) C6H5-NO2\n5) C6H5-C2H5\n6) C6H5-COOH\nC6H5 - means benzene ring\nArrange the substances in order of increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer.', choice1='3<5<1<6<2<4', choice2='4<2<6<3<1<5', choice3='6<2<4<5<1<3', choice4='4<6<2<1<5<3', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: To rank by the weight fraction of the para‐bromo isomer, note that all monobromo isomers have the same molar mass, so para weight fraction follows the mole fraction of para substitution. Estimate typical para fractions under Br₂/FeBr₃:

1) Nitrobenzene (4): Strongly deactivated, meta directing → para yield ≈0–2%
2) Benzoic acid (6): Strongly meta directing, slight steric ortho blocking → para ≈5–7%
3) Ethyl benzoate (2): Moderately deactivating meta director → para ≈10–12%
4) Toluene (1): Weak +I activator, ortho/para director → para ≈35–40%
5) Ethylbenzene (5): Similar activation to toluene but bulkier, ortho more hindered → para ≈45–50%
6) Chlorobenzene (3): Deactivated by –I but ortho/para directing by resonance, ortho hindered → para ≈55–60%

Ascending order of para fractions: 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3, which matches choice 4.
