Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent mlVC', content='To determine the minimum volume of 0.1 M monobasic strong acid needed to dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)3, we need to consider the solubility equilibrium and the reaction with the acid. Fe(OH)3 is a sparingly soluble compound with a low solubility product (Ksp), meaning it does not dissolve well in pure water. The dissolution reaction is: Fe(OH)3(s) ⇌ Fe³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq). In an acidic solution, the OH⁻ ions from Fe(OH)3 can react with H⁺ ions from the acid to form water, shifting the equilibrium and allowing more Fe(OH)3 to dissolve. The reaction of interest is: H⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq) → H2O(l), which removes OH⁻ ions and permits more Fe(OH)3 to dissolve. We calculate the moles of Fe(OH)3 from its mass (0.1 g) and molar mass (106.87 g/mol), which gives approximately 0.000936 moles. This produces 3 times as many moles of OH⁻, or 0.002808 moles of OH⁻. Therefore, we need 0.002808 moles of H⁺ to neutralize the OH⁻. Since the acid is 0.1 M, the volume of acid needed is 0.002808 moles / 0.1 M = 0.02808 L = 28.08 cm³. After the reaction, the concentration of H⁺ in the total volume of 100 cm³ (0.1 L) is (0.002808 moles / 0.1 L) = 0.02808 M. The pH is calculated as pH = -log(0.02808) ≈ 2.55. However, we must also consider the hydrolysis of Fe³⁺, which can slightly increase the pH. The closest choice to our calculated volume and pH is choice A) with pH 2.04 and 28.05 cm³.

Fe(OH)3 is a sparingly soluble compound with a low solubility product (Ksp), meaning it does not dissolve well in pure water. The dissolution process can be represented by the equilibrium: Fe(OH)3(s) ⇌ Fe³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq). The Ksp expression for this equilibrium is Ksp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³. In the presence of a strong acid, the H⁺ ions from the acid react with OH⁻ ions from Fe(OH)3 to form water: H⁺ + OH⁻ → H2O. This reaction removes OH⁻ from the solution, shifting the equilibrium to the right and allowing more Fe(OH)3 to dissolve. The minimum volume of acid needed is determined by the amount of OH⁻ that needs to be neutralized. Since the acid is 0.1 M, we can calculate the moles of H⁺ needed to react with the OH⁻ produced by 0.1 g of Fe(OH)3. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is approximately 106.87 g/mol, so 0.1 g corresponds to about 0.000936 moles of Fe(OH)3. This produces 3 times as many moles of OH⁻, or 0.002808 moles of OH⁻. Therefore, we need 0.002808 moles of H⁺ to neutralize the OH⁻. Since the acid is 0.1 M, the volume of acid needed is 0.002808 moles / 0.1 M = 0.02808 L = 28.08 cm³.

Fe(OH)3 is a sparingly soluble hydroxide with a low Ksp, meaning it does not dissolve well in pure water. However, in an acidic solution, the OH- ions from Fe(OH)3 can react with H+ ions from the strong acid to form water. This reaction shifts the dissolution equilibrium of Fe(OH)3 to the right, allowing more Fe(OH)3 to dissolve. The minimum volume of acid needed is determined by the stoichiometry of the reaction: Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ -> Fe3+ + 3H2O. For each mole of Fe(OH)3, 3 moles of H+ are needed. We calculate the moles of Fe(OH)3 from its mass (0.1 g) and molar mass (106.87 g/mol), which gives approximately 9.36 x 10^-4 moles. Therefore, we need 3 times this amount of H+, which is 2.808 x 10^-3 moles. In a 0.1 M acid solution, this corresponds to 28.08 cm3 of acid.

Fe(OH)3 is a sparingly soluble compound with a very low solubility product (Ksp). The dissolution of Fe(OH)3 in water is represented by the equilibrium: Fe(OH)3(s) ⇌ Fe³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq). The Ksp expression is [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³. To dissolve Fe(OH)3 in an acidic solution, the OH⁻ ions are neutralized by the H⁺ ions from the strong acid, shifting the equilibrium to the right and allowing more Fe(OH)3 to dissolve. The reaction is: H⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq) → H2O(l). We first calculate the moles of Fe(OH)3: 0.1 g / 106.87 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 moles. This produces 3 times as many moles of OH⁻, or 0.002808 moles of OH⁻. The acid must provide an equal amount of H⁺ to neutralize these OH⁻ ions. Therefore, we need 0.002808 moles of H⁺. Since the acid concentration is 0.1 M, the volume of acid needed is 0.002808 moles / 0.1 M = 0.02808 L = 28.08 cm³. After neutralization, the concentration of H⁺ in the total volume of 100 cm³ (0.1 L) is 0.002808 moles / 0.1 L = 0.02808 M. The pH is calculated as pH = -log(0.02808) ≈ 2.55.

The dissolution reaction of Fe(OH)3 is: Fe(OH)3(s) ⇌ Fe³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq). The Ksp expression for this equilibrium is [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³ = Ksp. In an acidic solution, OH⁻ ions are neutralized by H⁺ ions from the acid, shifting the equilibrium to dissolve more Fe(OH)3. Given the molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is approximately 106.87 g/mol, 0.1 g corresponds to about 0.000936 moles of Fe(OH)3. This produces 3 times as many moles of OH⁻ (0.002808 moles). To ensure dissolution, we need at least 0.002808 moles of H⁺ ions to neutralize the OH⁻. Using a 0.1 M acid solution, the required volume of acid is 0.002808 moles / 0.1 M = 0.02808 L = 28.08 cm³. The pH of the resulting solution, considering the H⁺ concentration in 100 cm³ total volume, is pH = -log(0.02808) ≈ 2.55.

Fe(OH)3 is a sparingly soluble compound, and its dissolution can be represented by the equilibrium: Fe(OH)3(s) ⇌ Fe³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq). The solubility product expression is [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³ = Ksp. In the presence of a strong acid, H+ ions react with OH- ions to form water, shifting the equilibrium towards the right and allowing more Fe(OH)3 to dissolve. The moles of Fe(OH)3 can be calculated from its mass (0.1 g) and molar mass (106.87 g/mol), resulting in approximately 0.000936 moles. This produces 0.002808 moles of OH- ions, requiring an equal amount of H+ ions to neutralize them. Therefore, 0.002808 moles of H+ are needed. Given the acid concentration of 0.1 M, the volume of acid required is 0.002808 moles / 0.1 M = 0.02808 L = 28.08 cm³.

Fe(OH)3 is a sparingly soluble compound with a low solubility product (Ksp), meaning it does not dissolve well in pure water. The dissolution reaction is: Fe(OH)3(s) ⇌ Fe³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq). In an acidic solution, the OH⁻ ions from Fe(OH)3 can react with H⁺ ions from the acid to form water, shifting the equilibrium and allowing more Fe(OH)3 to dissolve. The reaction of interest is: H⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq) → H2O(l), which removes OH⁻ ions and permits more Fe(OH)3 to dissolve. We calculate the moles of Fe(OH)3 from its mass (0.1 g) and molar mass (106.87 g/mol), which gives approximately 0.000936 moles. This produces 3 times as many moles of OH⁻, or 0.002808 moles of OH⁻. Therefore, we need 0.002808 moles of H⁺ to neutralize the OH⁻. Since the acid is 0.1 M, the volume of acid needed is 0.002808 moles / 0.1 M = 0.02808 L = 28.08 cm³.

Fe(OH)3 is a sparingly soluble compound, and its dissolution in water is governed by the solubility product (Ksp). The dissolution reaction is: Fe(OH)3(s) ⇌ Fe³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq).
