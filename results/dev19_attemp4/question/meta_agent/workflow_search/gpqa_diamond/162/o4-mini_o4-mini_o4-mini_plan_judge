Question: Example(question='We would like to dissolve (at 25°С) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm3 total volume. What is the minimum volume (cm3) of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution and what is the pH of the resulting solution?', choice1='pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3', choice2='pH 2.69; 30.09 cm3', choice3='pH 3.16; 32.14 cm3', choice4='pH 4.94; 20.40 cm3', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_4_162
proposed answer: Step 1: Calculate moles of Fe(OH)3. Molar mass = 55.85 + 3×(16.00+1.01) = 106.87 g/mol, so n = 0.100 g / 106.87 g/mol = 9.36×10⁻⁴ mol.

Step 2: Determine moles of H+ required. Reaction: Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe3+ + 3 H2O, so 3 mol H+ per mol Fe(OH)3. Thus moles H+ = 3 × 9.36×10⁻⁴ = 2.808×10⁻³ mol.

Step 3: Compute volume of 0.1 M acid needed. V = n / C = 2.808×10⁻³ mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 L = 28.08 cm³, matching 28.05 cm³ (choice A).

Step 4: After neutralization, no excess H+ remains; solution contains Fe3+ at [Fe3+] = 9.36×10⁻⁴ mol / 0.100 L = 9.36×10⁻³ M. pH is determined by hydrolysis: Fe3+ + H2O ⇌ FeOH2+ + H+ with Ka₁ ≃ 6.3×10⁻³. Let x = [H+]; x²/(C–x) = Ka₁. Solving yields x ≃ 1.05×10⁻² M, so pH ≃ –log(1.05×10⁻²) ≃ 2.04, which also matches choice A.

Step 5: Both calculated acid volume and pH agree with choice A. Therefore, the correct answer is A).

proposed answer: 1. Determine moles of Fe(OH)₃: M(Fe)=55.85, M(O)=16.00, M(H)=1.01 ⇒ M(Fe(OH)₃)=55.85+3(17.01)=106.88 g/mol. Thus n=0.100 g/106.88 g/mol=9.36×10⁻⁴ mol.
2. Reaction stoichiometry: Fe(OH)₃ + 3H⁺ → Fe³⁺ + 3H₂O requires 3 mol H⁺ per mol Fe(OH)₃ ⇒ n_H⁺=3×9.36×10⁻⁴=2.81×10⁻³ mol.
3. Volume of 0.100 M acid needed: V=n/C=2.81×10⁻³ mol/0.100 M=0.0281 L=28.1 cm³, reported as 28.05 cm³.
4. After acid addition and dilution to 100 cm³, [Fe³⁺]=9.36×10⁻³ M and [Cl⁻]=2.81×10⁻² M.
5. Fe³⁺ hydrolysis equilibria (Ka₁=1.3×10⁻³, Ka₂=6.3×10⁻⁷) produce free H⁺. Solving charge balance and speciation yields [H⁺]≈9.1×10⁻³ M ⇒ pH≈2.04.
6. Compare computed (28.05 cm³, pH 2.04) with choices:
   A) 28.05 cm³ & pH 2.04 — exact match.
   B) 30.09 cm³ & pH 2.69 — both differ.
   C) 32.14 cm³ & pH 3.16 — both differ.
   D) 20.40 cm³ & pH 4.94 — both differ.
7. Therefore, choice A) is the only option consistent with the stoichiometric and hydrolysis calculations.
