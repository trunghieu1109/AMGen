Question: Example(question='There has been an outbreak of an viral infectious disease in your city. You have been asked to design a molecular diagnostic kit for quick detection of this retrovirus. How would you go about designing this kit?', choice1='First you identify the virus by performing DNA sequencing. You then develop a PCR kit for  quick and accurate diagnosis', choice2='First you identify the IgG antibodies for the infection. You then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG antibodies for quick \n and accurate diagnosis.', choice3='First you identify the virus using the information about the symptoms, provided by the affected patients. You then design a nested PCR kit based on the information for quick diagnosis.', choice4='First you identify the virus by performing cDNA sequencing.  You then develop a real time PCR kit for quick and accurate diagnosis.', correct_index=4)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_21_156
proposed answer: The outbreak involves a retrovirus with an RNA genome requiring reverse transcription. Early detection calls for direct viral RNA amplification before antibody seroconversion. Conventional PCR (open-tube, end-point) is slower and contamination-prone; nested PCR doubles handling steps and contamination risk; IgG ELISA detects host response late. Real-time RT-PCR (choice D) provides closed-tube, one-step RT and quantitative detection within hours, with high sensitivity and specificity ideal for outbreak screening. Thus, the optimal kit design follows choice D.
