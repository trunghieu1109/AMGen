Question: Example(question='The Mott-Gurney equation describes the dark current (J) versus voltage (V) behavior of a semiconductor device in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. The equation can be expressed as\n$ J = \\frac{9}{8} \\epsilon \\mu \\frac{V^2}{L^3}$\nwhere $\\epsilon$ is the dielectric constant, $\\mu$ is the charge carrier mobility, and L is the length of the device. Which of the following statements is true about the validity of this equation?\n', choice1='The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.', choice2='The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.', choice3='The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.', choice4='The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: Step 1: List the four core assumptions of the Mott–Gurney law: (1) trap-free material (no carrier trapping), (2) single-carrier conduction (only one type of charge carrier), (3) ideal injection (Ohmic contact, i.e. no injection barrier), and (4) drift-dominated current (negligible diffusion current).  
Step 2: Examine each choice:
• Choice A: “trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.”  Matches all four assumptions: trap-free, single carrier, ideal Ohmic injection (no barrier), drift-dominated (negligible diffusion).  
• Choice B: “negligible drift current.”  Contradicts assumption (4) since drift must dominate in SCLC.  
• Choice C: “two-carrier device.”  Violates assumption (2) requiring single-carrier conduction.  
• Choice D: “Schottky contact.”  Introduces an injection barrier, violating assumption (3).  
Step 3: Only Choice A satisfies all validity conditions exactly.
