proposed answer: Step 1: Benzylation of the C3 hydroxymethyl. NaH deprotonates the –CH2OH at C3 of the starting cyclohexanone, and benzyl bromide converts it to a benzyloxymethyl ether (–OCH2Ph) at C3, while leaving the C1 ketone and the C5 isopropenyl intact (product 1).

Step 2: Tosyl hydrazone formation at C1. Treatment of product 1 with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide under catalytic HCl condenses the C1 ketone to the corresponding N-tosyl hydrazone, preserving the benzyl ether at C3 and the isopropenyl at C5 (product 2).

Step 3: Shapiro reaction on the hydrazone. Addition of n-BuLi at low temperature deprotonates the hydrazone, expels N2 and TsNLi, and generates an exocyclic methylene at C1 (–C=CH2). After quenching with NH4Cl, product 3 bears an exocyclic C1=CH2, the benzyl ether at C3, and the isopropenyl at C5.

Step 4: Catalytic hydrogenolysis/hydrogenation. Stirring product 3 with H2 over Pd/C simultaneously:
 • Hydrogenates the exocyclic C1=CH2 to a methyl substituent at C1.
 • Hydrogenates the isopropenyl (C5) to an isopropyl substituent.
 • Cleaves the benzyl ether at C3, regenerating the free –CH2OH.

The net result is a fully saturated cyclohexane bearing a free hydroxymethyl substituent at one position and an isopropyl substituent at another, with no other functional groups. This structure corresponds exactly to choice A: (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.
