Question: Example(question='In an industrial research lab, a scientist performs ethylene polymerization with a homogeneous organometallic catalyst system, generating a polymer of high density.

He consults a senior scientist, who gives the following statements. “Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US. One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators. Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.

proposed answer: We need to identify which statement about using only ethylene and a dual homogeneous catalyst system to introduce regular branches is correct. Testing each option:

A) Industrial implementation: No single-step, dual-catalyst, purely homogeneous ethylene system producing regularly branched PE has been commercialized in the US; existing plants use comonomers or gas-phase processes. So A is false.

B) Aluminum-based activators: Chain-walking catalysts (e.g., Pd or Ni) routinely use MAO or aluminum alkyls to activate the metal center for branch formation, so aluminum activators do work. Thus B is false.

C) Group VIa catalysts: Cr, Mo, or W homogeneous catalysts polymerize ethylene into linear chains or oligomers but do not perform successive β-hydride elimination/insertion needed for regular branching. No known homogeneous group VIa chain-walking system for pure ethylene branching exists. So C is false.

D) Noble metal catalysts: Well-defined Pd or Pt complexes can catalyze ethylene chain walking and branch formation using only ethylene, but these noble-metal catalysts and their ligands are costly and require high loadings, making them uneconomical at industrial scale. This statement correctly describes a feasible mechanism and its economic drawback.

Therefore, statement D is the only correct one.

proposed answer: To introduce regular branches from ethylene only, one needs a chain‐walking catalyst system. 1. Statement A: No major US plant combines two homogeneous catalysts (linear + chain‐walker) in one reactor for pure‐ethylene branching—still at pilot scale, so false. 2. Statement B: Aluminum activators (e.g., MAO) do activate many late‐metal chain‐walking catalysts (Ni diimine), so they do work, making B false. 3. Statement C: Group VIa metals (Cr, Mo, W) produce linear polyethylene but lack the reversible β‐hydride elimination/insertion needed for chain walking, so C is false. 4. Statement D: Noble‐metal complexes (Pd, Pt) can catalyze chain walking from pure ethylene but their high metal/ligand costs and limited lifetimes render them impractical at commodity scale—this is correct.
