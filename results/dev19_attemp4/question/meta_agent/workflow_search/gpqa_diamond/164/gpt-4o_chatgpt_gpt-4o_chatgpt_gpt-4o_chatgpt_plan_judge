proposed answer: To determine the correct statement regarding the formation of a polymer with regular branches using only ethylene as the monomer and a dual catalyst system, we need to analyze the provided statements in the context of polymer chemistry and catalysis. The goal is to introduce regular branches in the polymer backbone, which requires a specific catalyst system. Statement 1 suggests that such systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US, indicating feasibility but not directly addressing the formation of branches. Statement 2 highlights that aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step, which is crucial because it indicates the need for alternative activators to achieve the desired reaction step for branching. Statement 3 mentions using a group VIa transition metal catalyst with specific activators, which could be effective, but it lacks specificity about the activators' role in branching. Statement 4 discusses noble metal catalysts being effective but too expensive, which is relevant but does not address the branching process directly. The critical factor in forming regular branches is the ineffectiveness of aluminum-based activators, as identified in statement 2, making it the most pertinent to the task of introducing branches. Therefore, statement 2 is the correct choice as it directly addresses a key limitation in the branching process.

proposed answer: The task is to select the statement that correctly describes the method for forming a polymer with regular branches using only ethylene as the monomer and a dual catalyst system. The statements provided are: 1) Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US. 2) Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step. 3) One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators. 4) Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive. The question specifically asks for the method of forming branched polymers, not about the industrial scale, limitations, or cost factors. Statement 3 directly addresses the method by describing the use of a group VIa transition metal catalyst with specific activators, which is crucial for introducing regular branches in the polymer. This makes it the most relevant and significant statement in the context of the question. Statements 1, 2, and 4, while informative about scale, limitations, and cost, do not directly contribute to the understanding of the method for forming branched polymers. Therefore, the correct and prioritized statement is Statement 3.
