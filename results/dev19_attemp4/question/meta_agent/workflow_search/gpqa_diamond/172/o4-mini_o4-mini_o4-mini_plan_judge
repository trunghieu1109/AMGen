proposed answer: 1. Calculate momentum uncertainty (Δp) using Heisenberg’s principle:
   • Δx = 0.1 nm = 1×10⁻¹⁰ m
   • ħ ≈ 1.055×10⁻³⁴ J·s
   ⇒ Δp ≥ ħ/(2 Δx) = (1.055×10⁻³⁴ J·s)/(2×1×10⁻¹⁰ m) ≃ 5.28×10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s

2. Relate Δp to energy uncertainty (ΔE):
   • For a particle of mass m and velocity v, exact differential of kinetic energy E = p²/(2m) gives ΔE = (p/m)·Δp = v·Δp
   • Here v = 2×10⁸ m/s
   ⇒ ΔE ≃ v·Δp = (2×10⁸ m/s)×(5.28×10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s) ≃ 1.06×10⁻¹⁶ J

3. Check robustness:
   • Using full relativistic relation ΔE = (c²p/E)·Δp at v≈0.67c gives p/E = v/c², so ΔE ≃ v·Δp (same result)
   • Changing the exact form of the uncertainty bound (e.g. ħ/(4πΔx)) shifts ΔE by less than a factor of two, still ∼10⁻¹⁶ J

4. Compare with choices:
   A) ~10⁻¹⁹ J   B) ~10⁻¹⁸ J   C) ~10⁻¹⁶ J   D) ~10⁻¹⁷ J
   • Computed ΔE ≃1.06×10⁻¹⁶ J clearly matches choice C)

Therefore, the most consistent estimate of the minimum energy uncertainty is C).
