proposed answer: To determine the minimum uncertainty in the energy (ΔE) of the electron, we start by applying the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states that Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where Δx is the uncertainty in position, Δp is the uncertainty in momentum, and ħ is the reduced Planck's constant (approximately 1.0545718 * 10^(-34) Js). Given Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 * 10^(-9) m, we can calculate the minimum uncertainty in momentum as Δp = ħ / (2 * Δx). Substituting the values, we find Δp = 1.0545718 * 10^(-34) Js / (2 * 0.1 * 10^(-9) m) = 5.272859 * 10^(-25) kg*m/s. Next, we relate the uncertainty in momentum to the uncertainty in energy using the relation ΔE = Δp * v, where v is the velocity of the electron (v = 2 * 10^8 m/s). Calculating ΔE, we have ΔE = (5.272859 * 10^(-25) kg*m/s) * (2 * 10^8 m/s) = 1.0545718 * 10^(-16) J. This calculation shows that the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE is approximately 1.0545718 * 10^(-16) J. Therefore, the closest choice to our calculated ΔE is choice C, which is ~10^(-16) J. This conclusion is consistent with the detailed analysis and calculations performed in previous sub-tasks.
