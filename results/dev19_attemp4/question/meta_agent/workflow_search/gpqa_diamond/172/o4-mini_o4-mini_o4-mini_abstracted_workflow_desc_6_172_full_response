Hence the best match is choice C).; answer: C)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent xCLM, comparing ΔE to choices, thinking: 1. From the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: Δx·Δp ≥ ħ/2. With Δx=1×10⁻¹⁰\u2009m and ħ≈1.05×10⁻³⁴\u2009J·s, we get Δp≈ħ/(2Δx)≈(1.05×10⁻³⁴)/(2×10⁻¹⁰)=5.27×10⁻²⁵\u2009kg·m/s.\n2. The minimum energy uncertainty for a particle moving at speed v is ΔE≈v·Δp. Substituting v=2×10⁸\u2009m/s gives ΔE≈2×10⁸×5.27×10⁻²⁵=1.05×10⁻¹⁶\u2009J.\n3. Comparing to the provided choices (~10⁻¹⁹, ~10⁻¹⁸, ~10⁻¹⁶, ~10⁻¹⁷\u2009J), the value 1.05×10⁻¹⁶\u2009J matches choice C) ~10⁻¹⁶\u2009J most closely.; answer: C)', iteration_idx=-1)]
