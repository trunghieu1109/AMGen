Question: Example(question='Consider a system of three spins S1, S2 and S3. Each of which can take spin +1 and -1. The energy of the system is given by, E= -J[ S1S2 +S1S3+S2S3 ].\nFind the partition function Z of the system. (\\beta = 1/kT , k= boltzmann constant and T= temperature)', choice1='Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)', choice2='Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)', choice3='Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)', choice4='Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: We enumerate all 2^3=8 spin configurations and compute their energies:

1. All spins aligned (S1=S2=S3=+1 or –1):
   Pair products S1S2, S1S3, S2S3 all equal +1, so sum = +3, energy E = -J·3 = -3J. Degeneracy g1 = 2.

2. Exactly one spin flipped (six configurations):
   Two spins aligned (+1×+1 or -1×-1) contribute +1 each, and two cross-terms are -1 each. Sum of pair products = -1, energy E = -J·(-1) = +J. Degeneracy g2 = 6.

Boltzmann weights:
- For E=-3J: weight = exp(-β·(-3J)) = exp(3Jβ), total contribution = 2·e^{3Jβ}.
- For E=+J:  weight = exp(-β·J)    = exp(-Jβ), total contribution = 6·e^{-Jβ}.

Partition function Z = 2e^{3Jβ} + 6e^{-Jβ}, which matches choice A).
