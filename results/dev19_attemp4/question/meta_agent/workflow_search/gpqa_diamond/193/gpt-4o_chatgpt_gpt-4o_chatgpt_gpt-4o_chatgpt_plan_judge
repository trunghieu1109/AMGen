proposed answer: To find the partition function Z, we need to consider all possible configurations of the spins S1, S2, and S3, each of which can be +1 or -1. There are 2^3 = 8 possible configurations. The energy for each configuration is given by E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. We calculate the energy for each configuration: 1) S1 = +1, S2 = +1, S3 = +1: E = -3J. 2) S1 = +1, S2 = +1, S3 = -1: E = -J. 3) S1 = +1, S2 = -1, S3 = +1: E = -J. 4) S1 = +1, S2 = -1, S3 = -1: E = J. 5) S1 = -1, S2 = +1, S3 = +1: E = -J. 6) S1 = -1, S2 = +1, S3 = -1: E = J. 7) S1 = -1, S2 = -1, S3 = +1: E = J. 8) S1 = -1, S2 = -1, S3 = -1: E = -3J. The partition function Z is the sum of e^(-βE) over all configurations: Z = e^(3Jβ) + 3e^(Jβ) + 3e^(-Jβ) + e^(-3Jβ). Simplifying, we can group the terms as Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ), which matches choice A.
