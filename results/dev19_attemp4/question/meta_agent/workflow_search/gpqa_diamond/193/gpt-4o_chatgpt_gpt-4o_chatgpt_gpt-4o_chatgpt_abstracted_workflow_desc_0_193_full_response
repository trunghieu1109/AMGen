Each spin can be +1 or -1, so there are 2^3 = 8 possible configurations. The energy expression is E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. The energy depends on the products of pairs of spins. Let's consider each configuration:\n\n1. S1 = +1, S2 = +1, S3 = +1: E = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -3J.\n2. S1 = +1, S2 = +1, S3 = -1: E = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J.\n3. S1 = +1, S2 = -1, S3 = +1: E = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J.\n4. S1 = +1, S2 = -1, S3 = -1: E = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = +J.\n5.

S1 = -1, S2 = -1, S3 = -1: E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -3J.\n\nFrom this, we see that there are two configurations with energy -3J, three configurations with energy -J, and three configurations with energy +J.

Each spin can be either +1 or -1, so there are 2^3 = 8 possible configurations of the spins (S1, S2, S3). For each configuration, we calculate the energy by substituting the values of the spins into the energy expression. The energy depends on the products S1S2, S1S3, and S2S3. If two spins are aligned (both +1 or both -1), their product is +1, and if they are anti-aligned (one +1, one -1), their product is -1. The energy is minimized when the spins are aligned, as this results in the most negative energy due to the negative sign in front of J. There are 4 configurations where all spins are aligned (either all +1 or all -1), which gives the lowest energy E = -3J. There are 4 configurations where one pair of spins is aligned and the other is anti-aligned, resulting in energy E = J. By calculating the energy for each configuration, we can see how the energy changes with different spin alignments.; answer: A)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent yEii, analyzing relationships, thinking: The energy of the system is given by E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. Each spin can be +1 or -1, so we need to consider all possible configurations of the three spins. There are 2^3 = 8 possible configurations. For each configuration, we calculate the energy by substituting the values of S1, S2, and S3 into the energy expression. The product S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can take values -3, -1, 1, or 3, depending on the alignment of the spins. When all spins are aligned (S1 = S2 = S3 = +1 or S1 = S2 = S3 = -1), the product is 3, leading to the lowest energy state (E = -3J). When two spins are aligned and one is opposite, the product is -1, leading to a higher energy state (E = J). When all spins are opposite (e.g., S1 = +1, S2 = -1, S3 = -1), the product is 1, leading to an energy of -J. The partition function Z is the sum over all configurations, each weighted by e^{-\\beta E}. We calculate Z by considering the degeneracy of each energy level: there are 2 configurations with energy -3J, 6 configurations with energy J, and 0 configurations with energy -J.
