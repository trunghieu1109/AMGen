Question: Example(question='Astronomers are observing a planet with a radius of 1 Earth radius in a circular orbit, with a transit impact parameter of 0.2, around a star that has a radius 1.5 times that of the Sun. This planet has an orbital period of 3 days. What is the maximum orbital period of a second planet, with a radius of 2.5 times that of Earth, in the same system that will exhibit both transit and occultation events? Assume that the second planet also has a circular orbit and shares the same orbital plane as the previously mentioned transiting planet.', choice1='~ 7.5', choice2='~ 33.5', choice3='~ 37.5', choice4='~ 12.5', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_6_194
proposed answer: 1. For both transit and occultation, the impact parameter must satisfy |b₂| ≤ 1 – (R_{p2}/R_*).  
2. Compute R_{p2}/R_*: R_{p2}=2.5 R⊕, R_*=1.5 R☉⇒ R_{p2}/R_*=(2.5×R⊕)/(1.5×R☉)≃0.0153.  
3. Thus b₂,max=1–0.0153=0.9847.  
4. Planet 1’s impact parameter b₁=0.2 gives cos i via b₁=(a₁ cos i)/R_*.  From P₁=3 d and M_*≃M☉, Kepler’s law yields a₁≃0.041 AU. So cos i=(b₁ R_*)/a₁.  
5. Maximum semi‐major axis for planet 2: a₂,max=(b₂,max R_*)/cos i = a₁·(b₂,max/b₁) ≃0.041 AU×(0.9847/0.2)≃0.202 AU.  
6. By Kepler’s third law, P₂,max=P₁·(a₂,max/a₁)^{3/2}=3 d×(0.202/0.041)^{1.5}≈3 d×10.94≈32.8 d.  
7. Compare to the choices (~7.5, 12.5, 33.5, 37.5 d): 32.8 d is closest to 33.5 d, which is choice B).
