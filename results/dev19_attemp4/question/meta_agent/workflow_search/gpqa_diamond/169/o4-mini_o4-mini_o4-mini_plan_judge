Question: Example(question='An electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Find the expectation value of its spin along y-direction, S_y.\nNote: \\sigma_y (in latex format) is: \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & -i \\\\\ni & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}', choice1='-25*hbar/2\n\n', choice2='-12*hbar/25\n\n', choice3='12*hbar/25', choice4='25*hbar/2\n', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: Step 1: Write down the given (unnormalized) spinor ψ and its adjoint ψ†:
ψ = (3i, 4)^T, so ψ† = (−3i, 4).

Step 2: Compute the norm ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = 9 + 16 = 25. Normalize: φ = ψ/5, φ† = (−3i/5, 4/5).

Step 3: Recall the Pauli matrix σ_y and the spin operator:
σ_y = [[0, −i], [i, 0]],  S_y = (ħ/2) σ_y.

Step 4: Apply σ_y to φ:
σ_y φ = [0*(3i/5) + (−i)*(4/5), i*(3i/5) + 0*(4/5)]^T = (−4i/5, 3i^2/5)^T = (−4i/5, −3/5)^T.

Step 5: Compute the inner product φ† (σ_y φ):
= (−3i/5)*(−4i/5) + (4/5)*(−3/5)
= (12 i^2/25) − 12/25 = (−12/25) − 12/25 = −24/25.

Step 6: Multiply by ħ/2 to get ⟨S_y⟩:
⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2)*(−24/25) = −12 ħ/25.

Step 7: Compare with the provided choices: only choice B) matches: –12 ħ/25.
