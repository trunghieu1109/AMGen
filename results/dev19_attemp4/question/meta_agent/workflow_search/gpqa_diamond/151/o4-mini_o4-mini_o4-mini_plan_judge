Question: Example(question='You identified a new quorum-sensing peptide in the bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus. You are highly interested if its role in intercellular communication is conserved among the eukaryotes. You treat yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with the peptide and interestingly observe the formation of the shmoo. You want to learn about the proteome of the active chromatin in the shmoo and recover it by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. The least of proteins from which complex below will you observe in your assay?', choice1='pre-initiation complex', choice2='pre-replication complex', choice3='enhancer protein complex', choice4='nucleosome histone complex', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: We are performing chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) against active‐chromatin marks (e.g. H3K4me3, H3K27ac) in shmooing yeast cells, followed by mass spectrometry (MS). This assay enriches proteins physically associated with transcriptionally active loci (promoters, enhancers) and the nucleosomes carrying active marks. We compare the four candidate complexes:

1. Pre‐initiation complex (PIC): Assembles at active promoters of transcribed genes, includes TBP, TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF, TFIIH and RNA polymerase II. Because these proteins localize exactly to active promoters marked by our antibody, they are robustly co‐immunoprecipitated and readily detected by MS.

2. Enhancer protein complex: In yeast, upstream activating sequences (UAS) function like enhancers and recruit transcriptional activators (e.g. Ste12), Mediator, coactivators, and chromatin remodelers. These factors loop into promoters and associate with active histone marks, so they too are enriched in active‐chromatin ChIP–MS.

3. Nucleosome histone complex: Core histones (H2A, H2B, H3, H4) are the direct targets of antibodies against active marks. Modified nucleosomes and their variant histones or remodeling complexes are among the most abundant proteins recovered.

4. Pre‐replication complex (pre‐RC): Composed of ORC subunits, Cdc6, Cdt1, and MCM2–7 helicase loader. This complex binds replication origins during G1 to license DNA for S phase. These origin sites are distinct from actively transcribed promoters/enhancers and do not bear active‐chromatin histone marks. Pre‐RC proteins do not co‐localize with transcriptionally engaged chromatin and thus are not immunoprecipitated by active‐chromatin antibodies.

Only the pre‐replication complex fails to localize to, or be marked on, transcriptionally active regions in shmooing cells. Therefore, its proteins will be the least recovered in an active‐chromatin ChIP–MS assay.
