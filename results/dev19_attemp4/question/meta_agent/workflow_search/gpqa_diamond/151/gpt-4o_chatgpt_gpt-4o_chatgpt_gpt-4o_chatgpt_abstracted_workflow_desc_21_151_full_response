Pre-initiation complex: This complex is involved in the initiation of transcription. It assembles at the promoter region of genes and is crucial for the start of RNA synthesis. It includes transcription factors and RNA polymerase.\n\n2. Pre-replication complex: This complex is involved in the initiation of DNA replication. It assembles at origins of replication and is crucial for the start of DNA synthesis. It is not directly involved in transcription or gene expression in the context of active chromatin.\n\n3. Enhancer protein complex: This complex is involved in the regulation of gene expression by enhancing the transcription of specific genes. It interacts with enhancer regions and can facilitate the assembly of the transcription machinery at promoters.\n\n4. Nucleosome histone complex: This complex is the fundamental unit of chromatin structure, consisting of DNA wrapped around histone proteins. It is involved in both the structural organization of chromatin and the regulation of gene expression through modifications that can either repress or activate transcription.\n\nIn the context of active chromatin, we expect to see protein complexes involved in transcriptional activation, such as the pre-initiation complex and enhancer protein complex. The nucleosome histone complex is always present as it forms the basic structure of chromatin.

It plays a direct role in gene expression by facilitating RNA polymerase II binding and transcription initiation.\n\n2. Pre-replication complex: This complex is involved in the initiation of DNA replication. It assembles at origins of replication during the G1 phase of the cell cycle and is necessary for the start of DNA synthesis. It is not directly involved in transcription or active chromatin related to gene expression, but rather in DNA replication.\n\n3. Enhancer protein complex: This complex is associated with enhancers, which are DNA elements that increase the transcription of associated genes. Enhancer protein complexes interact with transcription factors and the transcription machinery to facilitate gene expression. They are directly involved in regulating chromatin structure and gene expression.\n\n4. Nucleosome histone complex: This complex refers to the basic unit of chromatin, consisting of DNA wrapped around histone proteins. Nucleosomes play a role in chromatin structure and can influence gene expression by regulating the accessibility of DNA to transcription factors and RNA polymerase. \n\nIn the context of active chromatin and gene expression, the pre-initiation complex and enhancer protein complex are directly involved. The nucleosome histone complex is also relevant as it is the basic structural unit of chromatin.
