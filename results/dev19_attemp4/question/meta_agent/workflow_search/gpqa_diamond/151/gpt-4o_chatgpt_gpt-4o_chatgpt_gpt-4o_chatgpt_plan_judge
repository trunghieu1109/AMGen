Question: Example(question='You identified a new quorum-sensing peptide in the bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus. You are highly interested if its role in intercellular communication is conserved among the eukaryotes. You treat yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with the peptide and interestingly observe the formation of the shmoo. You want to learn about the proteome of the active chromatin in the shmoo and recover it by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. The least of proteins from which complex below will you observe in your assay?', choice1='pre-initiation complex', choice2='pre-replication complex', choice3='enhancer protein complex', choice4='nucleosome histone complex', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_21_151
proposed answer: The task is to determine which protein complex is least likely to be observed in the proteome of active chromatin during shmoo formation in yeast. Shmoo formation is a response to mating signals, involving changes in gene expression and chromatin structure. The four protein complexes given are: pre-initiation complex, pre-replication complex, enhancer protein complex, and nucleosome histone complex. The pre-initiation complex is involved in transcription initiation and would be present in active chromatin. The enhancer protein complex regulates gene expression by interacting with enhancers, also present in active chromatin. The nucleosome histone complex is the basic unit of chromatin structure and is always present. The pre-replication complex is involved in DNA replication, not directly in transcription or gene expression. During shmoo formation, yeast cells are arrested in G1 phase, focusing on gene expression changes for mating, not DNA replication. Thus, the pre-replication complex is least likely to be observed in active chromatin during shmoo formation. This conclusion is consistent across all analyses provided by the agents.
