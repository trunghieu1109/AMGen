Question: Example(question='Imagine an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ having a small spherical cavity inside. The centre of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the centre of the spherical conductor. The radius of the cavity is $r$, and $r<R$. Now consider a small amount of positive charge $+q$ is somehow placed somewhere inside the cavity. What is the magnitude of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at a point P (outside the spherical conductor) of distance $L$ from the centre of the spherical conductor? Note, the distance of the point P from the centre of the cavity is $l$. Here, l, L > R. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\\theta$\n', choice1='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n', choice2='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n', choice3='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\n', choice4='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: The problem involves a charge +q placed inside a cavity within an uncharged spherical conductor. The presence of the charge induces a charge distribution on the conductor. The inner surface of the cavity acquires a charge of -q, and the outer surface of the conductor acquires a charge of +q to maintain the overall neutrality of the conductor. Due to the spherical symmetry of the conductor, the charge distribution on the outer surface can be treated as if it were a point charge +q located at the center of the conductor. This is a result of the shell theorem, which states that a spherically symmetric charge distribution affects external points as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. Therefore, the electric field at a point P outside the conductor, at a distance L from the center of the conductor, is equivalent to the electric field due to a point charge +q at the center. The electric field at point P is given by E = (1/(4πϵ₀))(q/L²), which corresponds to choice D).
