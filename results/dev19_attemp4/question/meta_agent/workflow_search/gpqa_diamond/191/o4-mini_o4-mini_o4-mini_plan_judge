Question: Example(question='Imagine an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ having a small spherical cavity inside. The centre of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the centre of the spherical conductor. The radius of the cavity is $r$, and $r<R$. Now consider a small amount of positive charge $+q$ is somehow placed somewhere inside the cavity. What is the magnitude of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at a point P (outside the spherical conductor) of distance $L$ from the centre of the spherical conductor? Note, the distance of the point P from the centre of the cavity is $l$. Here, l, L > R. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\\theta$\n', choice1='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n', choice2='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n', choice3='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\n', choice4='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: Step 1: Identify that the conductor is isolated and initially uncharged. When +q is placed inside the cavity, –q is induced on the inner cavity wall to cancel the field in the conductor’s bulk, and +q appears on the outer surface by charge conservation.
Step 2: The outer surface is a perfect sphere of radius R carrying total charge +q uniformly. By Gauss’s law, any spherical Gaussian surface of radius L>R encloses net charge +q.
Step 3: Apply Gauss’s law: ∮E·dA = E·4πL² = q/ε₀, so E = (1/4πε₀)(q/L²), directed radially outward.
Step 4: By the uniqueness theorem, the external field is independent of the cavity’s offset and matches that of a point charge +q at the center of the sphere.
Step 5: Compare with the provided options: Choice D is E = (1/4πε₀)·q/L², which exactly matches the derived expression.
