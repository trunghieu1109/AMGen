Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent ri0f', content='1. For a rhombohedral lattice with edge length a and equal angles α, the reciprocal‐lattice metric gives: |G*·(h,k,l)|^2 = [h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk+hl+kl) cosα] / [a^2(1+2 cosα)]. 2. For the (111) plane: numerator = 1^2+1^2+1^2 + 2(1·1+1·1+1·1)cosα = 3 + 6 cosα = 3(1+2 cosα), so |G*·(1,1,1)|^2 = 3/[a^2], giving d_{111} = 1/|G*·h| = a·√[(1+2 cosα)/3]. 3. Substituting a = 10\u2009Å and α = 30° (cos30° = √3/2 ≈ 0.8660): (1 + 2·0.8660) = 2.7320; divided by 3 → 0.9107; √0.9107 ≈ 0.9543; ∴ d_{111} ≈ 10·0.9543 = 9.543\u2009Å. 4.

Extract and Summarize Given Information:\n   • Crystal type: Rhombohedral (all edges equal, all angles equal).  \n   • Interatomic distance (edge length a): 10 Å.  \n   • Lattice angles: α = β = γ = 30°.  \n   • Plane of interest: (111) Miller indices.  \n   • Provided multiple-choice options for interplanar spacing d₁₁₁:  \n     – 9.54 Å  \n     – 8.95 Å  \n     – 9.08 Å  \n     – 10.05 Å  \n\n2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:\n   • In a rhombohedral lattice, edge length a and angle α determine the metric tensor components.  \n   • Interplanar spacing dₕₖₗ is a function of (h,k,l), the lattice parameters a and α, and the angle between crystallographic axes.  \n   • The (111) plane is symmetrically oriented; its spacing depends on both length and acute angles.  \n   • Conditions like equal angles (α=β=γ) simplify formulas for d₁₁₁ but still require careful metric evaluation.  \n\n3. Identify the Field of Study:\n   • Domain: Crystallography / Solid State Physics.  \n   • Subfields: Lattice geometry, Miller indices, interplanar spacing.  \n   • Related mathematical concepts: 3D geometry, metric tensors, trigonometry.  \n   • Applications: X-ray diffraction, materials science, crystallographic analysis.  \n\n4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:\n   • Angle value: α = 30° is unusually small for rhombohedral lattices—verify whether this refers to the internal angle or an obtuse supplement.  \n   • Definition of “interatomic distance”: assumed to be the primitive lattice constant a.  \n   • Sign convention or normalization for Miller indices in non‐orthogonal cells.  \n   • Potential units consistency: Ångström throughout.  \n   • Possible alternative lattice settings (hexagonal vs. primitive rhombohedral) influencing formula choice..These are just pieces of information related to the question.
