proposed answer: 1. Spectroscopic analysis of Compound X shows IR bands at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad O–H) and 1720 cm⁻¹ (C=O), confirming a carboxylic acid, plus aromatic bands at 1610 and 1450 cm⁻¹. ¹H NMR shows a broad 10.5 ppm signal (COOH), aromatic AA′BB′ pattern (8.0 and 7.2 ppm, each 2H) consistent with a para-disubstituted benzene, and aliphatic signals (2.9 m, 1H; 1.7 m, 2H; 1.4 d, 3H; 0.9 t, 3H) that match a sec-butyl side chain. Therefore Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.
2. Under red phosphorus/HI, aromatic carboxylic acids undergo reductive decarboxylation (Ar–COOH → Ar–COI → Ar–CH₂I → Ar–CH₃ with loss of CO₂), converting the carboxyl group into a methyl group while leaving other substituents intact.
3. Applying this to 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid yields p-sec-butyl toluene (the COOH becomes CH₃), i.e. 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.
4. Comparing to the options: A) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene matches exactly; B) retains the acid (wrong); C) is a different acid/propanoyl structure; D) has an isobutyl, not sec-butyl. Thus the correct final product is A).
