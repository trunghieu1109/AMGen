proposed answer: The IR and NMR data for Compound X indicate the presence of a carboxylic acid group, as evidenced by the broad IR peak at 3400–2500 cm-1 and the C=O stretch at 1720 cm-1. The NMR data supports this with a broad singlet at 10.5 ppm, which is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton. The aromatic nature of the compound is suggested by the peaks at 1610 cm-1 and the doublets at 8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm in the NMR, which are typical for aromatic protons. The aliphatic region of the NMR shows signals that suggest a sec-butyl group (multiplet at 2.9 ppm, multiplet at 1.7 ppm, doublet at 1.4 ppm, and triplet at 0.9 ppm). When Compound X is reacted with red phosphorus and HI, the carboxylic acid group is reduced to a hydrocarbon, removing the carboxyl group as CO2. This transformation means that the final product will be a hydrocarbon retaining the aromatic ring and aliphatic chains. Among the given choices, A) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene is the only one that matches the expected structure after the removal of the carboxylic acid group, as it is a hydrocarbon with a sec-butyl group attached to an aromatic ring.
