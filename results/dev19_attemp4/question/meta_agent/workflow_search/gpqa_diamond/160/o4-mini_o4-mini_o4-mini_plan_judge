Question: Example(question='While designing a high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating at an accelerating voltage of 1000 kV, Mike connected vacuum pumps to create an ultra-high vacuum state (< 10^-9 Torr) in the sample compartment, aiming to minimize the presence of gas molecules for improved electron microscopy.

Mike accurately determined the mean free path of these gas molecules in the vacuum state (< 10^-9 Torr) to be λ1, based on factors such as sample compartment volume, pressure, and temperature.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_14_160
proposed answer: Step 1: In an ultra-high vacuum at pressure P and temperature T, the gas number density is n = P/(k_B T).
Step 2: For molecule–molecule collisions (identical particles), kinetic theory gives λ1 = 1/(√2⋅n⋅σ1), where σ1 is the molecular collision cross section.
Step 3: For high-energy electron–gas collisions, the directed beam approximation yields λ2 = 1/(n⋅σ2), with σ2 the electron–molecule cross section.
Step 4: Form the ratio R = λ2/λ1 = [1/(n⋅σ2)] / [1/(√2⋅n⋅σ1)] = √2⋅(σ1/σ2).
Step 5: Typical values: σ1 ~10⁻¹⁹–10⁻²⁰ m² for molecules; σ2 ~10⁻²²–10⁻²¹ m² for 1000 keV electrons. Thus σ1/σ2 ~10²–10³.
Step 6: Therefore R ≃ √2×(10²–10³) ≫1.22 (even in the extreme σ1=σ2, R=√2≈1.414>1.22).
Conclusion: λ2 ≥1.22⋅λ1, so choice D) is correct.

proposed answer: Step 1: Write down the mean free‐path formulas under the same number density n and temperature T.
  – For gas–gas collisions: λ₁ = 1/(√2 n σ₁).
  – For electron–gas collisions: λ₂ = 1/(n σ₂).
Step 2: Form the ratio R = λ₂/λ₁ = (√2 σ₁)/σ₂.  Since n and T are fixed by the UHV state, only σ₁ (molecule–molecule cross section) and σ₂ (electron–molecule cross section) matter.
Step 3: Survey typical cross‐section magnitudes in UHV residual gas (mostly N₂/O₂) and 1 MeV–1 GeV electrons:
  • σ₁ ≈ (3–6)×10⁻¹⁹ m² from Chapman–Enskog theory.
  • Total σ₂ at megavolt energies is smaller than σ₁ but not orders of magnitude smaller once transport and angular effects are included; effective σ₂ ≈ (3–5)×10⁻¹⁹ m².
Step 4: Compute extreme R bounds with these ranges:
  – If σ₁=3×10⁻¹⁹ and σ₂=5×10⁻¹⁹, R≈1.414·3/5≈0.85 (but this underestimates anisotropic effects).
  – If σ₁=6×10⁻¹⁹ and σ₂=3×10⁻¹⁹, R≈1.414·6/3≈2.83 (an overestimate without considering transport weighting).
Step 5: Include realistic electron‐transport cross‐section values (which account for forward‐peaked scattering and reduce σ₂): σ₂,eff≈(3.5–5.5)×10⁻¹⁹ m², narrowing R to roughly 1.02–1.20.
Step 6: Conclude that the electron beam sees fewer scattering events per unit path than gas molecules scatter each other (so λ₂>λ₁), yet the difference is modest, bounded by the small change in effective σ₂. Thus 1<R<1.22.
Step 7: Match this to the choices: only option B) (λ₁<λ₂<1.22·λ₁) fits.
