Question: Example(question='In an inactive state, a transcription factor subunit awaits an activation signal from the membrane phosphorylation cascade. Upon phosphorylation on the Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, shuttles into the nucleus, and serves in gene transcription. A missense mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. You observe that a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Which of the following molecular phenotypes is most likely observed in the presence of mutation Y?', choice1='loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype', choice2='protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype', choice3='protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele', choice4='change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: 1. A dominant-negative mutation in the dimerization domain typically allows the mutant monomer to retain the ability to bind the wild-type monomer, producing mixed heterodimers.
2. These mutant–wild-type heterodimers are structurally perturbed and misfolded, exposing hydrophobic surfaces that would normally be buried in a properly formed homodimer.
3. The exposed hydrophobic patches drive aberrant higher-order self-association of the heterodimers, leading to intracellular protein aggregation.
4. These aggregates sequester both mutant and wild-type subunits, depleting the pool of functional homodimers available for nuclear import and transcriptional activation.
5. The result is a loss-of-function phenotype in the heterozygous state, despite the presence of one normal allele—a hallmark of dominant-negative interference.
6. Among the provided options, only choice B (“protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype”) accurately describes this classic dominant-negative mechanism.
