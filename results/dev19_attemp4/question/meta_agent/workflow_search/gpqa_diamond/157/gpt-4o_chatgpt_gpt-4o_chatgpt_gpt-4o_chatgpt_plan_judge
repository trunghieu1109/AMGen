Question: Example(question='In an inactive state, a transcription factor subunit awaits an activation signal from the membrane phosphorylation cascade. Upon phosphorylation on the Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, shuttles into the nucleus, and serves in gene transcription. A missense mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. You observe that a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Which of the following molecular phenotypes is most likely observed in the presence of mutation Y?', choice1='loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype', choice2='protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype', choice3='protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele', choice4='change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: The transcription factor requires dimerization for its function, which involves the dimerization domain. Mutation Y is a heterozygous mutation in the dimerization domain that acts as a dominant-negative mutation. This means that even one mutated allele can interfere with the function of the wild-type protein. Dominant-negative mutations often result in the formation of non-functional dimers or aggregates with the wild-type protein, leading to a loss-of-function phenotype. In this case, mutation Y likely causes the transcription factor to misfold or aggregate, preventing proper dimerization and thus leading to a loss-of-function phenotype. This aligns with choice B, which describes protein aggregation and a loss-of-function phenotype. All agents agree on this analysis, and the reasoning is consistent with the nature of dominant-negative mutations affecting dimerization.
