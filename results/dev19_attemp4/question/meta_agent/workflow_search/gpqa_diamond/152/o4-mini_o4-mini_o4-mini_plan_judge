Question: Example(question='α-β unsaturated carbonyls have a much more electrophilic carbon double bond. These double bonds act as a good Lewis acid and react with nucleophiles to produce enolate ions. In this case, when a nucleophile attacks the β position, it produces a resonance-stabilized intermediate. When a nucleophile attacking the β-carbon is enolate, such reaction is known as the Michael reaction.\nWhat are the reactants and major final products of the following Michael addition reactions?\ndimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) -->(A)\n1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H3O+) --> (B)\nC + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H2O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice1='A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice2='A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice3='A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice4='A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: Step 1: Identify product A. In the Michael addition of dimethyl malonate to methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate under NaOEt, the malonate enolate attacks the β-carbon to give a three-carbon backbone bearing two CO2Me groups at C1 (from malonate), one CO2Me at C3 (from acrylate), and a p-tolyl at C2. This is named trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. Only choices 1 and 4 list this for A. 

Step 2: Identify product B. The enamine 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine of cyclohexanone adds to (E)-but-2-enenitrile, then upon acidic hydrolysis the enamine reverts to the ketone, giving 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile. Only choices 1 and 4 match this for B. 

Step 3: Determine intermediate C. To yield 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione upon reaction with but-3-en-2-one under base, the nucleophile must be cyclohexane-1,3-dione (the diketo tautomer), whose enolate attacks the enone. Only choice 4 names C as cyclohexane-1,3-dione (choice 1 wrongly gives the enol tautomer). 

Since only choice 4 matches A, B, and C simultaneously, the correct answer is D).
