Question: Example(question='α-β unsaturated carbonyls have a much more electrophilic carbon double bond. These double bonds act as a good Lewis acid and react with nucleophiles to produce enolate ions. In this case, when a nucleophile attacks the β position, it produces a resonance-stabilized intermediate. When a nucleophile attacking the β-carbon is enolate, such reaction is known as the Michael reaction.\nWhat are the reactants and major final products of the following Michael addition reactions?\ndimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) -->(A)\n1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H3O+) --> (B)\nC + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H2O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice1='A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice2='A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice3='A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice4='A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: To evaluate the choices for the Michael addition reactions, we need to consider the mechanism of the Michael addition, which involves a nucleophilic attack on the β-carbon of an α-β unsaturated carbonyl compound. The conditions provided, such as NaOEt, EtOH, MeOH, H3O+, KOH, and H2O, are typical for promoting such reactions. In the first reaction, dimethyl malonate acts as the nucleophile, attacking the β-carbon of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, leading to a product with an additional carboxylate group. The second reaction involves 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine acting as a nucleophile, attacking the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile, resulting in a product with a nitrile group. The third reaction involves cyclohexane-1,3-dione acting as the nucleophile, attacking the β-carbon of but-3-en-2-one, resulting in a product with an additional ketone group. Comparing the choices, choice 1 aligns with these mechanisms and expected products: A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione. Therefore, the correct answer is choice A.

proposed answer: To evaluate the choices for the Michael addition reactions, we need to consider the mechanisms and the stability of the resulting products. For Reaction A, dimethyl malonate is deprotonated by NaOEt to form an enolate, which attacks the β-carbon of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. This results in the formation of trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, which is consistent with choice A. Reaction B involves the nucleophilic attack of 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine on (E)-but-2-enenitrile, leading to the formation of 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, which also matches choice A. For Reaction C, the identity of compound C is clarified as cyclohexane-1,3-dione. The enolate formed from cyclohexane-1,3-dione attacks the β-carbon of but-3-en-2-one, resulting in 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione, consistent with choice A. The reaction conditions favor the stability of the proposed products, and no significant positional isomers or tautomeric forms are expected. Therefore, the correct choice is A.
