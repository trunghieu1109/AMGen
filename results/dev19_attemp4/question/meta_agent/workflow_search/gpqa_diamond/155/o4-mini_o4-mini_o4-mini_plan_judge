Question: Example(question='A chemist performs two reactions:\n\nReaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. \n\nReaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.\n\nBoth reactions go to 100% completion. The chemist combines the products of both reactions, and then runs the product mixture on both a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column and a chiral HPLC column.\n\nAssuming that the chromatographic resolution is as high as theoretically possible in both cases, what does the chemist observe in each of these chromatograms?', choice1='4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', choice2='3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice3='2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice4='2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: Step 1: Determine products of each reaction. Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene undergoes syn epoxidation to give a trans epoxide; acid-catalyzed anti opening yields trans-4,5-octanediol. In an 8-carbon chain, this trans diol has an internal mirror plane and is a meso compound (achiral). Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene gives a cis epoxide; acid opening yields cis-4,5-octanediol, which has no internal mirror plane and exists as a pair of enantiomers (R,R and S,S).

Step 2: List stereoisomers in the combined mixture: one meso diol, plus two enantiomers (R,R and S,S) of the cis diol.

Step 3: Predict achiral reverse-phase HPLC: Achiral columns separate diastereomers but not enantiomers. The meso diol (achiral) is one diastereomer; the racemic enantiomeric pair coelutes as a single peak. Total peaks = 2.

Step 4: Predict chiral HPLC: Chiral columns resolve enantiomers but treat meso (achiral) as one. Thus you observe one peak for the meso diol and separate peaks for R,R and S,S. Total peaks = 3.

Step 5: Match to answer choices: “2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC” corresponds to choice C).
