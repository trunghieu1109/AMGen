Upon treatment with aqueous acid, the trans-epoxide will open to form a trans-diol, which is a meso compound and thus achiral. The cis-epoxide will open to form a cis-diol, which is chiral and exists as a pair of enantiomers. Therefore, we have two types of diols: a meso trans-diol and a pair of enantiomeric cis-diols.

For (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxidation yields a trans-epoxide, which, upon acid-catalyzed ring opening, forms a trans-diol. This trans-diol is actually a meso compound because the two hydroxyl groups are on opposite sides of the carbon chain, making it achiral. For (Z)-oct-4-ene, the epoxidation yields a cis-epoxide, which forms a cis-diol upon ring opening. The cis-diol has hydroxyl groups on the same side of the carbon chain, making it chiral. Thus, the cis-diol exists as a pair of enantiomers. In summary, the reactions produce one meso compound (the trans-diol) and one pair of enantiomers (the cis-diol). On a standard achiral HPLC, the meso compound and the pair of enantiomers will appear as two peaks because the enantiomers are not separated. On a chiral HPLC, the meso compound will still appear as one peak, but the enantiomers will be separated into two distinct peaks, resulting in three peaks in total.; answer: 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent bDGc, predicting distinct products, thinking: The reactions start with (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene, both of which are treated with mCPBA to form epoxides. (E)-oct-4-ene forms a trans-epoxide and (Z)-oct-4-ene forms a cis-epoxide. Upon hydrolysis with aqueous acid, the trans-epoxide leads to a trans-diol, which is a meso compound and therefore achiral. The cis-epoxide leads to a cis-diol, which is chiral and exists as a pair of enantiomers. Therefore, the reaction mixture contains one meso trans-diol and one pair of enantiomeric cis-diols. On a standard achiral HPLC, the meso trans-diol and the racemic cis-diol mixture will likely show up as two peaks if they have different polarities. On a chiral HPLC, the meso trans-diol will still show as one peak, but the racemic cis-diol will separate into its two enantiomers, resulting in three peaks.

For (E)-oct-4-ene, the reaction sequence produces a trans-diol which is a meso compound (achiral). For (Z)-oct-4-ene, the reaction sequence produces a cis-diol which is chiral and exists as a pair of enantiomers. Therefore, the reaction mixture consists of one meso trans-diol and one pair of enantiomeric cis-diols. On a standard achiral HPLC column, the meso trans-diol and the racemic cis-diol mixture will likely show up as two peaks if they have different polarities. On a chiral HPLC column, the meso trans-diol will still show as one peak, but the racemic cis-diol will separate into its two enantiomers, resulting in three peaks.
