Question: Example(question='A chemist performs two reactions:\n\nReaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. \n\nReaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.\n\nBoth reactions go to 100% completion. The chemist combines the products of both reactions, and then runs the product mixture on both a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column and a chiral HPLC column.\n\nAssuming that the chromatographic resolution is as high as theoretically possible in both cases, what does the chemist observe in each of these chromatograms?', choice1='4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', choice2='3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice3='2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice4='2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: In the reactions, (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene are both treated with mCPBA to form epoxides, which are then hydrolyzed to diols. The (E)-oct-4-ene forms a trans-epoxide, leading to a trans-diol, which is a meso compound and thus achiral. The (Z)-oct-4-ene forms a cis-epoxide, leading to a cis-diol, which is chiral and exists as a pair of enantiomers. On a chiral HPLC column, separation is based on chirality. The meso trans-diol will not separate into multiple peaks as it is achiral. The cis-diol, however, will separate into two peaks because it consists of a pair of enantiomers. Therefore, on a chiral HPLC column, we will observe three peaks: one for the meso compound and two for the enantiomers of the cis-diol. This reasoning is consistent with the analysis provided by multiple agents, all of whom concluded that three peaks would be observed on the chiral HPLC column.
