Question: Example(question='In the lab, a chemist discovers an unnamed bottle with a white solid inside. He gathers the following spectral information in order to identify the liquid. Make a reasonable structural suggestion for the unidentified drug using the information provided.\nMass: molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 (100%)\na peak at m/z = 158 (32%)\nIR : broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1, strong sharp peak at 1720 cm-1\n1H NMR: 11.0 ppm (s, 1H), 8.02 ppm (d, 2H), 7.72 (d, 2H)', choice1='4-chlorobenzoic acid', choice2='2-chlorobenzoic acid', choice3='3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde\n', choice4='Phenyl chloroformate', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: 1. Mass spectrometry shows peaks at m/z 156 (100%) and m/z 158 (32%), giving a 3:1 Cl isotopic pattern and a molecular weight of 156, consistent with formula C7H5ClO2 (one chlorine atom).
2. IR spectroscopy displays a broad band from 3500–2700 cm⁻¹ (O–H stretch of a carboxylic acid) and a strong sharp band at 1720 cm⁻¹ (C=O stretch of a carboxylic acid), confirming a –COOH group.
3. The ¹H NMR spectrum has:
   • 11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H) for the carboxylic acid proton.
   • Two aromatic doublets at 8.02 ppm (2H) and 7.72 ppm (2H) forming an AA′BB′ pattern, indicating a para-disubstituted benzene ring with two sets of equivalent protons.
4. Among the options:
   • 2- and 3-chlorobenzoic acids (ortho/meta) show three distinct aromatic signals, not the observed two-doublet pattern.
   • 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde lacks a broad carboxylic O–H stretch and has an aldehyde proton instead of an acid proton.
   • Phenyl chloroformate lacks a carboxylic acid O–H and has an extra oxygen atom.
5. Only 4-chlorobenzoic acid (para isomer) matches the molecular weight, isotopic pattern, IR bands, and NMR pattern. Therefore, the correct choice is A).
