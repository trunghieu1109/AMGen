Question: Example(question='In the lab, a chemist discovers an unnamed bottle with a white solid inside. He gathers the following spectral information in order to identify the liquid. Make a reasonable structural suggestion for the unidentified drug using the information provided.\nMass: molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 (100%)\na peak at m/z = 158 (32%)\nIR : broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1, strong sharp peak at 1720 cm-1\n1H NMR: 11.0 ppm (s, 1H), 8.02 ppm (d, 2H), 7.72 (d, 2H)', choice1='4-chlorobenzoic acid', choice2='2-chlorobenzoic acid', choice3='3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde\n', choice4='Phenyl chloroformate', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: The spectral data provided includes mass spectrometry, IR spectroscopy, and 1H NMR spectroscopy. The mass spectrometry data shows a molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 with a secondary peak at m/z = 158, indicating the presence of a chlorine atom due to the isotopic pattern of chlorine (35Cl and 37Cl). This matches the molecular weight of compounds containing a chlorine atom. The IR spectroscopy data shows a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1, indicative of an O-H group, likely from a carboxylic acid, and a strong peak at 1720 cm^-1, indicating a carbonyl group, consistent with a carboxylic acid. The 1H NMR data shows a singlet at 11.0 ppm, characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton, and two doublets at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm, suggesting aromatic protons, possibly in a para or ortho configuration. Among the given choices, 4-chlorobenzoic acid matches the molecular weight of 156 and contains a chlorine atom and a carboxylic acid group, consistent with the spectral data. The NMR pattern with two doublets is also consistent with a para-substitution pattern on the aromatic ring. Therefore, the most plausible structure based on the spectral data is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.
