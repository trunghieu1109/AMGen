For any unit vector n, the Pauli matrices satisfy (σ·n)^2 = I. This follows from σ_iσ_j = δ_{ij}I + iε_{ijk}σ_k and ∑n_i^2 = 1, so the cross terms cancel and you get the identity.\n3. If v is an eigenvector of σ·n with eigenvalue λ, then (σ·n)^2 v = λ^2 v, but (σ·n)^2 = I implies λ^2 = 1.\n4. Therefore the eigenvalues of σ·n are +1 and –1.\n5. Multiplying these by ε gives the eigenvalues of H as +ε and –ε.\n6. Among the provided choices, choice A) (“+ ε, –ε”) matches this result exactly.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent uxMj:\nWe start with H=ε\u2009σ·n. From sub‐task 3 we know the eigenvalues of σ·n are ±1 (since (σ·n)^2=I for unit vector n). Scaling these eigenvalues by ε gives the eigenvalues of H as ±ε. Among the provided choices: A) "+ε, -ε" matches exactly, whereas the others include factors of ħ/2 or are unitless ±1. Therefore the correct selection is A).\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent YEeg:\nThe operator H is defined as H = ε σ·n. First, recall that for a unit vector n, (σ·n)^2 = I, so the eigenvalues of σ·n are ±1. Scaling σ·n by ε multiplies its eigenvalues by ε, giving eigenvalues ±ε for H. Among the provided choices, only choice A) “+ ε, -ε” matches these values.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent 6bOl:\n1. We start with the Hamiltonian H = ε (σ·n), where σ·n = n_xσ_x + n_yσ_y + n_zσ_z and n is a unit vector (||n||=1).\n2. The eigenvalue equation for the operator A = σ·n is A\u2009|ψ⟩ = λ\u2009|ψ⟩. To find λ, square both sides: A^2\u2009|ψ⟩ = λ^2\u2009|ψ⟩.\n3. Using Pauli matrix algebra: (σ·n)^2 = (n_xσ_x + n_yσ_y + n_zσ_z)^2 = I, because σ_iσ_j = δ_{ij}I + iε_{ijk}σ_k and ||n||^2 = n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1, so the cross terms cancel.\n4. Thus A^2 = I, giving λ^2 = 1, so λ = +1 or −1. These are the eigenvalues of σ·n.\n5. The Hamiltonian H = ε\u2009A therefore has eigenvalues ε·(+1) = +ε and ε·(−1) = −ε.\n6.
