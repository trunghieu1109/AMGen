proposed answer: The Hamiltonian operator is given by H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma}.\vec{n}, where \vec{\sigma} is the vector of Pauli matrices and \vec{n} is a unit vector. The expression \vec{\sigma}.\vec{n} is a linear combination of the Pauli matrices: n_x \sigma_x + n_y \sigma_y + n_z \sigma_z. The Pauli matrices are 2x2 Hermitian matrices, and their linear combinations are also 2x2 Hermitian matrices. The eigenvalues of a matrix of the form \vec{\sigma}.\vec{n} are known to be +1 and -1, due to the properties of Pauli matrices and the fact that \vec{n} is a unit vector. Therefore, the eigenvalues of H = \varepsilon (\vec{\sigma}.\vec{n}) are \varepsilon times the eigenvalues of \vec{\sigma}.\vec{n}, which are +\varepsilon and -\varepsilon. This reasoning is consistent across all the analyses provided, and the correct choice is A) +\varepsilon, -\varepsilon.
