Question: Example(question='Two stars are being studied. It has been observed that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2. In fact, the energy difference between the considered energy levels was determined to be approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J. Assuming that the stellar photospheres are in LTE, which of these equations for the effective temperatures of the stars (T_1 and T_2) is correct?', choice1='ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]\n', choice2='ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]\n', choice3='ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n', choice4='ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: 1. In Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the population of an excited energy level follows the Boltzmann distribution: N∝exp[−ΔE/(kT)].
2. For the same level in two stars at temperatures T₁ and T₂, the ratio N₁/N₂=exp[−ΔE/(kT₁)+ΔE/(kT₂)]. Taking the natural logarithm with N₁/N₂=2 gives:
   ln(2)=−ΔE/(kT₁)+ΔE/(kT₂)=(ΔE/k)(1/T₂−1/T₁).
3. The reciprocal difference simplifies to 1/T₂−1/T₁=(T₁−T₂)/(T₁ T₂).
4. Numerically ΔE=1.38×10⁻²³ J and k=1.38×10⁻²³ J/K, so ΔE/k=1 K. Substituting yields:
   ln(2)=1×(T₁−T₂)/(T₁ T₂)=(T₁−T₂)/(T₁ T₂).
5. Comparing with the given options, only choice D has exactly this form:
   ln(2) = (T₁−T₂)/(T₁ T₂).
6. Therefore, the correct answer is D).
