According to the Boltzmann distribution, the ratio of populations of two energy levels is given by exp(-ΔE/kT), where ΔE is the energy difference between the levels, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature. In this problem, the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2, meaning the ratio of populations for the same energy level is 2. Therefore, we have: n_1/n_2 = 2 = exp(-ΔE/kT_1) / exp(-ΔE/kT_2). Taking the natural logarithm of both sides gives ln(2) = (ΔE/kT_2) - (ΔE/kT_1).

The Boltzmann factor is given by exp(-E/kT), where E is the energy difference between the levels, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature. Since the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to those in star_2, we can express this as: n_1/n_2 = 2, where n_1 and n_2 are the populations of the excited state in star_1 and star_2, respectively. According to the Boltzmann distribution, n_1/n_2 = exp(-E/kT_1) / exp(-E/kT_2) = exp(-E/kT_1 + E/kT_2). Given n_1/n_2 = 2, we have: exp(-E/kT_1 + E/kT_2) = 2. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides gives: -E/kT_1 + E/kT_2 = ln(2). Rearranging terms, we get: ln(2) = E/k (1/T_2 - 1/T_1). This can be rewritten as: ln(2) = E/k [(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1*T_2)].
