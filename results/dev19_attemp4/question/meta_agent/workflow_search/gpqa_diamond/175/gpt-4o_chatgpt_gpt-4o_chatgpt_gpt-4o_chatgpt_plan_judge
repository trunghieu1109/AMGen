Question: Example(question='The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1), and the operators of two observables P and Q of the system are represented by two square matrices. The matrix corresponding to operator P has the elements in first row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0), elements in the second row as (1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}) and that in third row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0). The matrix operator for Q is represented by the square matrix having elements in the first row as (1, 0, 0), second row as (0, 0, 0) and third row as (0, 0, -1). Now, if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P, what is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements?', choice1='1/2', choice2='1/6', choice3='1/3', choice4='2/3', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: The problem involves calculating the probability of obtaining specific eigenvalues for the operators P and Q. The initial state is given as a column matrix (-1, 2, 1). The operator P has an eigenvector [1, 0, -1] corresponding to the eigenvalue 0. We project the initial state onto this eigenvector to find the probability of measuring 0 for P. The projection gives the state [-1, 0, 1], and the probability is the square of the norm of this projection divided by the square of the norm of the initial state, which is 1/3. After measuring 0 for P, the state is updated to [-1, 0, 1]. The operator Q has an eigenvector [0, 0, 1] corresponding to the eigenvalue -1. We project the updated state onto this eigenvector to find the probability of measuring -1 for Q. The projection gives [0, 0, 1], and the probability is the square of the norm of this projection divided by the square of the norm of the updated state, which is 1/2. The combined probability of measuring 0 for P and -1 for Q is the product of these probabilities: (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6. This matches choice B).
