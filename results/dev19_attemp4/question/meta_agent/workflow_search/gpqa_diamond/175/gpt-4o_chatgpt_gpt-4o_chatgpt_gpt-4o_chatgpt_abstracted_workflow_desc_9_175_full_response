In quantum mechanics, measuring an observable corresponds to projecting the state vector onto the eigenvectors of the operator representing that observable. The probability of obtaining a particular eigenvalue is given by the square of the magnitude of the projection of the state vector onto the corresponding eigenvector. For operator P, we find its eigenvectors and eigenvalues. The first step is to calculate the eigenvalues of matrix P by solving the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0. Once we have the eigenvalues, we find the corresponding eigenvectors.

Next, we consider the operator Q, which is represented by the matrix Q = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -1]]. The eigenvalues of Q are 1, 0, and -1. We are interested in the eigenvalue -1. The eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue -1 can be found by solving (Q + I)v = 0, which gives v = [0, 0, 1]. We then project the updated state [-1, 0, 1] onto this eigenvector. The projection is calculated as (|v> . |ψ>') / (|v> . |v>) * |v>, where |ψ>' is the updated state. The dot product |v> . |ψ>' = 0* (-1) + 0*0 + 1*1 = 1, and |v> . |v> = 0*0 + 0*0 + 1*1 = 1.

The eigenvalues of Q are 1 and -1, with corresponding eigenvectors [1, 0, 0] and [0, 0, 1] respectively. To find the probability of measuring -1 for Q, we project the updated state [-1, 0, 1] onto the eigenvector of Q corresponding to the eigenvalue -1, which is [0, 0, 1]. The projection is calculated as: Proj_v(updated state) = (|v> . updated state) / (|v> . |v>) * |v>. Here, |v> . updated state = 1, and |v> . |v> = 1.

The initial state is given as a column matrix (-1, 2, 1). The operator P has an eigenvector [1, 0, -1] corresponding to the eigenvalue 0. We project the initial state onto this eigenvector to find the probability of measuring 0 for P. The projection gives the state [-1, 0, 1], and the probability is the square of the norm of this projection divided by the square of the norm of the initial state, which is 1/3. After measuring 0 for P, the state is updated to [-1, 0, 1]. The operator Q has an eigenvector [0, 0, 1] corresponding to the eigenvalue -1.
