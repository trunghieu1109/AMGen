Question: Example(question='The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1), and the operators of two observables P and Q of the system are represented by two square matrices. The matrix corresponding to operator P has the elements in first row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0), elements in the second row as (1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}) and that in third row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0). The matrix operator for Q is represented by the square matrix having elements in the first row as (1, 0, 0), second row as (0, 0, 0) and third row as (0, 0, -1). Now, if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P, what is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements?', choice1='1/2', choice2='1/6', choice3='1/3', choice4='2/3', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: 1. Normalize the initial state |ψ⟩=(–1,2,1)^T: its norm²=6, so |ψ_norm⟩=(–1/√6,2/√6,1/√6)^T.
2. Find P’s eigenspace for eigenvalue 0: solve P v=0 gives v∝(1,0,–1), normalize to |u₀⟩=(1/√2,0,–1/√2)^T.
3. Compute P(P=0)=|⟨u₀|ψ_norm⟩|². Overlap ⟨u₀|ψ_norm⟩=(1/√2)(–1/√6)+(–1/√2)(1/√6)=–1/√3, so P(P=0)=1/3.
4. The post‐measurement (collapsed) state is |ψ₀⟩=|u₀⟩ up to phase: (–1/√2,0,1/√2)^T.
5. Q has eigenvalue –1 with eigenvector |e₃⟩=(0,0,1)^T; the projector is Π_{–1}=|e₃⟩⟨e₃|.
6. Compute conditional probability P(Q=–1|P=0)=⟨ψ₀|Π_{–1}|ψ₀⟩=|⟨e₃|ψ₀⟩|²=|(1/√2)|²=1/2.
7. The joint probability P(P=0 then Q=–1)=P(P=0)·P(Q=–1|P=0)=(1/3)·(1/2)=1/6.
8. Among the given options, 1/6 corresponds to choice B).
