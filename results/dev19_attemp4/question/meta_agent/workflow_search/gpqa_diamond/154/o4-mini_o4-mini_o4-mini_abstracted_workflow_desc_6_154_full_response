Extract and Summarize Given Information:\n   • Operators and Basis:\n     – We have three components of a vector operator \\(\\vec P=(P_x,P_y,P_z)\\).\n     – The basis is the set of eigenvectors of \\(P_z\\).\n   • Matrix representations (in the \\(P_z\\)-eigenbasis, dimension 3):\n     – \\(P_x\\):\n       Row 1: \\((0,\\\\,\\hbar/\\sqrt2,\\\\,0)\\)\n       Row 2: \\((\\hbar/\\sqrt2,\\\\,0,\\\\,\\hbar/\\sqrt2)\\)\n       Row 3: \\((0,\\\\,\\hbar/\\sqrt2,\\\\,0)\\)\n     – \\(P_y\\):\n       Row 1: \\((0,\\\\,-i\\hbar/\\sqrt2,\\\\,0)\\)\n       Row 2: \\((i\\hbar/\\sqrt2,\\\\,0,\\\\,-i\\hbar/\\sqrt2)\\)\n       Row 3: \\((0,\\\\,i\\hbar/\\sqrt2,\\\\,0)\\)\n     – \\(P_z\\):\n       Row 1: \\((\\hbar,\\\\,0,\\\\,0)\\)\n       Row 2: \\((0,\\\\,0,\\\\,0)\\)\n       Row 3: \\((0,\\\\,0,\\\\,-\\hbar)\\)\n   • Quantum state:\n     – The system is prepared in the eigenstate of \\(P_x\\) with eigenvalue \\(-\\hbar\\).\n     – Its coordinate (column) vector in the \\(P_z\\)-basis is\n       \\[\\psi=\\begin{pmatrix}-1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt2 \\\\ -1/2\\end{pmatrix},\\]\n       which is normalized since \\((1/2)^2+(1/\\sqrt2)^2+(1/2)^2=1\\).\n   • Question metrics:\n     – Compute the uncertainty \\(\\Delta P_z\\) for this state.\n     – Provided multiple‐choice answers: \\(\\hbar\\), \\(\\hbar/2\\), \\(\\hbar/\\sqrt2\\), \\(\\sqrt2\\,\\hbar\\).\n\n2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:\n   • Operator algebra:\n     – \\(P_x, P_y, P_z\\) satisfy the usual angular‐momentum commutation relations \\([P_i,P_j]=i\\hbar\\,\\epsilon_{ijk}P_k\\).  These matrix forms correspond to the spin-1 representation of SU(2).\n   • State–operator interplay:\n     – The given state is an eigenvector of \\(P_x\\) (eigenvalue \\(-\\hbar\\)), so \\(P_x\\psi=-\\hbar\\psi\\).\n     – To find \\(\\Delta P_z\\), one needs \\(\\langle P_z\\rangle=\\psi^\\dagger P_z\\psi\\) and \\(\\langle P_z^2\\rangle=\\psi^\\dagger P_z^2\\psi\\).\n   • Constraints and significance:\n     – The normalization of \\(\\psi\\) ensures expectation values are well‐defined.\n     – The orthonormality of the \\(P_z\\)-eigenbasis simplifies matrix‐element calculations.\n\n3. Identify the Field of Study:\n   • Primary domain: Quantum mechanics (matrix mechanics formulation).\n   • Relevant subfields:\n     – Angular momentum in quantum systems (spin-1 representation).\n     – Linear algebra over complex vector spaces (Hermitian operators).\n   • Common contexts:\n     – Quantum measurement and uncertainty relations.\n     – Problems in undergraduate/graduate quantum physics courses and competition exams.\n\n4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:\n   • All quantities are explicitly given and unambiguous:\n     – The state vector is properly normalized.\n     – Operator matrices are fully specified.\n   • Possible subtlety: sign conventions for eigenstates of \\(P_x\\) and overall phase—but these do not affect uncertainties.\n   • No further assumptions appear necessary; problem statement is complete as given..These are just pieces of information related to the question.
