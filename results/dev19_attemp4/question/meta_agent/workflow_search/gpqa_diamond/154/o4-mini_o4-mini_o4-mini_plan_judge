Question: Example(question='Imagine an operator $\\vec{P}$ of a system have components $P_x, P_y$ and $P_z$. The matrix form of the  operator $P_x$ has components in the first row as $(0, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,\\hbar/\\sqrt{2},0)$.  The matrix form of the  operator $P_y$ has components in the first row as $(0, -i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0, -i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2},0)$. Similarly, matrix form of the  operator $P_z$ has components in the first row as $(\\hbar, 0, 0)$, that in the second row as $(0, 0, 0)$ and that in the third row as $(0,0, -\\hbar)$. The basis vectors here are the eigenvectors of $P_z$. The system is found in the eigenstate of $P_x$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$. To be more specific, the explicit form of the state of the system is given by the column vector having elements $(-1/2, 1/\\sqrt{2}, -1/2)$. What is the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z $ of $P_z$', choice1='\\hbar\n', choice2='\\hbar/2', choice3='\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}\n', choice4='\\sqrt{2}\\hbar', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: 1. The uncertainty of P_z is defined as ΔP_z = √(⟨P_z^2⟩ − ⟨P_z⟩^2).
2. From Sub-task 2 we have ⟨P_z⟩ = 0.
3. From Sub-task 3 we have ⟨P_z^2⟩ = ħ^2/2.
4. Therefore Var(P_z) = ⟨P_z^2⟩ − ⟨P_z⟩^2 = ħ^2/2 − 0 = ħ^2/2.
5. Taking the square root gives ΔP_z = ħ/√2.
6. Comparing to the choices (A) ħ, (B) ħ/2, (C) ħ/√2, (D) √2 ħ, the correct match is C).
