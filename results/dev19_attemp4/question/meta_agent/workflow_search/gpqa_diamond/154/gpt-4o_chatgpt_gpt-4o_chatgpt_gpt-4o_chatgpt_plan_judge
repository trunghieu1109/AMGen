Question: Example(question='Imagine an operator $\\vec{P}$ of a system have components $P_x, P_y$ and $P_z$. The matrix form of the  operator $P_x$ has components in the first row as $(0, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,\\hbar/\\sqrt{2},0)$.  The matrix form of the  operator $P_y$ has components in the first row as $(0, -i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0, -i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2},0)$. Similarly, matrix form of the  operator $P_z$ has components in the first row as $(\\hbar, 0, 0)$, that in the second row as $(0, 0, 0)$ and that in the third row as $(0,0, -\\hbar)$. The basis vectors here are the eigenvectors of $P_z$. The system is found in the eigenstate of $P_x$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$. To be more specific, the explicit form of the state of the system is given by the column vector having elements $(-1/2, 1/\\sqrt{2}, -1/2)$. What is the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z $ of $P_z$', choice1='\\hbar\n', choice2='\\hbar/2', choice3='\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}\n', choice4='\\sqrt{2}\\hbar', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: To determine the uncertainty ΔP_z, we need to calculate the expectation values <P_z> and <P_z^2> using the given state vector |ψ⟩ = (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2) and the operator P_z. The matrix form of P_z is diagonal with elements (ℏ, 0, -ℏ). The expectation value <P_z> is calculated as ⟨ψ|P_z|ψ⟩, which involves the conjugate transpose of the state vector, multiplying it by P_z, and then multiplying by the state vector again. The calculation is: <P_z> = (-1/2)*ℏ*(-1/2) + (1/√2)*0*(1/√2) + (-1/2)*(-ℏ)*(-1/2) = 0. Similarly, the expectation value <P_z^2> is calculated as: <P_z^2> = (-1/2)*ℏ^2*(-1/2) + (1/√2)*0*(1/√2) + (-1/2)*ℏ^2*(-1/2) = ℏ^2/2. The uncertainty ΔP_z is given by the square root of the difference between <P_z^2> and <P_z>^2: ΔP_z = sqrt(<P_z^2> - <P_z>^2) = sqrt(ℏ^2/2 - 0) = ℏ/√2. This matches choice C), which is consistent with the calculations.
