proposed answer: Step 1: Check statement A (“W and X represent evolution operators”). Evolution operators must be unitary (U†U=I). W†W=I, so W is unitary. But X†X≠I (e.g. (X†X)₁₁=6≠1), so X is not unitary. Hence A is false.
Step 2: Check statement B (“There exists a vector whose norm changes under e^X”). Since X is neither Hermitian nor anti-Hermitian, e^X is not unitary, so it can change the norm of some vector. Hence B is true.
Step 3: Check statement C (“(e^X)*Y*(e^{–X}) represents a quantum state”). A density matrix transformed by conjugation remains valid only if the conjugating operator is unitary. Here e^X is not unitary, so positivity or unit trace may be lost. Hence C is false.
Step 4: Check statement D (“Z and X represent observables”). Observables must be Hermitian. Z†=Z, so Z is Hermitian. X†≠X, so X is not Hermitian. Hence D is false.
Only statement B is correct.

proposed answer: We check each statement:

1) W is unitary but X†=−X so X is anti-Hermitian, not unitary. Thus X itself cannot be an evolution operator → choice A is false.

2) Since X†=−X, e^X is unitary and preserves all norms; no vector’s norm can change under e^X → choice B is false.

3) A valid density matrix ρ′ must be obtained by ρ′=U Y U† with U unitary. Here (e^X)*Y*(e^{−X}) is not of the form U Y U† (and U= e^X†≠ e^{−X}), so it need not be Hermitian with unit trace and positive semidefinite → choice C is false.

4) Z is Hermitian, but X is anti-Hermitian (X†=−X), so X is not an observable → choice D is false.

Hence none of the four standard statements holds.
