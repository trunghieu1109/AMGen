Question: Example(question='Which of the following (effective) particles is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry?', choice1='Magnon', choice2='Skyrmion', choice3='Pion', choice4='Phonon', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_7_188
proposed answer: We classify each candidate based on whether it arises as a (pseudo-)Goldstone mode of a spontaneously broken continuous symmetry: 1) Magnon: In a ferromagnet or antiferromagnet, global spin-rotation symmetry is spontaneously broken by magnetic order. Small fluctuations of the order parameter—spin waves—are massless Goldstone modes (“magnons”). 2) Pion: In low-energy QCD, the approximate SU(2)_L×SU(2)_R chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken to SU(2)_V. The pions are light pseudo-Goldstone bosons (they acquire small mass from explicit quark masses). 3) Phonon: A crystal lattice breaks continuous translational invariance of free space. Long-wavelength lattice vibrations (phonons) are the resulting Goldstone modes. 4) Skyrmion: A skyrmion is a finite-energy topological soliton (a stable, localized defect) classified by a nontrivial homotopy of the order-parameter manifold. It is not a small-amplitude fluctuation associated with a broken continuous symmetry and does not appear as a gapless Goldstone mode. Therefore, only the skyrmion is not tied to spontaneous symmetry breaking.
