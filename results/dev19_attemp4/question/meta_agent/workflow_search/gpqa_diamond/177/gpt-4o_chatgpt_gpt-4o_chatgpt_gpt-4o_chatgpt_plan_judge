proposed answer: The Lagrangian given is \( \mathcal{L}_{int}=\kappa\bar{\psi}\sigma_{\mu\nu}\psi F^{\mu\nu} \). In 4-dimensional spacetime, the mass dimension of the Lagrangian density is 4. The field \( \psi \) is a spinor field with mass dimension \( \frac{3}{2} \). The field strength tensor \( F^{\mu\nu} \) has mass dimension 2. The sigma term \( \sigma_{\mu\nu} \) is dimensionless as it is constructed from gamma matrices. Therefore, the mass dimension of the term \( \bar{\psi}\sigma_{\mu\nu}\psi F^{\mu\nu} \) is \( 3 + 2 = 5 \), since \( \bar{\psi} \) has mass dimension \( \frac{3}{2} \) and \( \psi \) also has mass dimension \( \frac{3}{2} \), giving a total of 3 for the spinor fields, and 2 for \( F^{\mu\nu} \). To make the Lagrangian have dimension 4, \( \kappa \) must have mass dimension \( 4 - 5 = -1 \). A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. Since \( \kappa \) has a negative mass dimension, the theory is not renormalizable. Therefore, the most consistent and correct solution is that the mass dimension of \( \kappa \) is \(-1\) and the theory is not renormalizable.
