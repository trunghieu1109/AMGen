Question: Example(question='Which of the following issues are the most common sources of difficult-to-spot erroneous results generated in genomics data analysis:\n\n- Mutually incompatible data formats\n- The "chr" / "no chr" confusion\n- Reference assembly mismatch\n- Incorrect ID conversion', choice1='3 and 4', choice2='2 and 3', choice3='All of the above', choice4='2, 3 and 4', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: We need the combination of issues that most silently evade standard validation in genomics pipelines.  Issue A (format incompatibility) usually triggers parser errors or warnings, so including A makes errors more detectable. Issues B (“chr”/no-“chr” naming), C (reference assembly mismatch), and D (incorrect ID conversion) each bypass format checks, coordinate‐range checks, and ID‐mapping logs on their own. When B, C, and D co‐occur, there is no early parser error, no prefix metadata enforcement, no assembly‐version check, and no guaranteed logging of mis‐mapped IDs. Thus the triple B + C + D is the most insidious, difficult‐to‐spot source of errors. Mapping to the provided choices, “2, 3 and 4” (choice D) is correct.

proposed answer: In genomics pipelines, mutually incompatible data formats (Issue A) typically cause obvious parse or validation errors that are caught and fixed before analysis proceeds. In contrast, the “chr”/“no chr” naming mismatch (Issue B) silently drops or misaligns intervals without warnings; reference assembly mismatches (Issue C) shift coordinates or miscall variants undetected by most tools; and incorrect ID conversion (Issue D) quietly misannotates or loses gene/transcript identifiers until much later. These three issues (B, C, and D) are each frequent, difficult-to-spot sources of erroneous results, whereas Issue A is conspicuous. Therefore, the correct combination is B, C, and D, which corresponds to choice4 (option D).
