Question: Example(question='Astronomers are studying two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2. Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.', choice1='~ 0.4', choice2='~ 0.7', choice3='~ 0.6\n', choice4='~ 1.2', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: We assume both binary systems have circular orbits (eccentricity e≈0) and are observed edge-on (inclination i≈90°), so that each star’s radial velocity amplitude K equals its orbital speed. 

1. Kepler’s third law for a two-body system: P² = (4π² a³)/(G M_total), so M_total = (4π² a³)/(G P²).
2. In a circular, edge-on binary, the sum of RV amplitudes gives the total separation a: K₁ + K₂ = 2π a / P → a = P(K₁ + K₂)/(2π).
3. Substitute a into M_total: 
   M_total = [4π²/(G P²)]·[P(K₁+K₂)/(2π)]³ 
           = (K₁+K₂)³·P/(2π G). 
   Thus for any such binary, M_total ∝ P·(K₁ + K₂)³, with the same proportionality constant for both systems.
4. Compute the proportional terms for each system (constant cancels in the ratio):
   • System 1: P₁ = 2 yr, K₁ + K₂ = 10 + 5 = 15 km/s → term₁ = 2·15³ = 2·3375 = 6750.
   • System 2: P₂ = 1 yr, K₁ + K₂ = 15 + 10 = 25 km/s → term₂ = 1·25³ = 15625.
5. The mass ratio is M₁/M₂ = 6750 / 15625 ≃ 0.432. 
6. Comparing 0.432 to the provided choices (~0.4, ~0.6, ~0.7, ~1.2), the closest match is ~0.4, corresponding to choice A).
