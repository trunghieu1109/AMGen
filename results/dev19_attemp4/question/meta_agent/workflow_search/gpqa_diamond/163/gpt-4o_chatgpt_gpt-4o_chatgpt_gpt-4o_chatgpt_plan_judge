Question: Example(question='Astronomers are studying two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2. Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.', choice1='~ 0.4', choice2='~ 0.7', choice3='~ 0.6\n', choice4='~ 1.2', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: To determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we need to compare their total masses using the given radial velocity amplitudes and orbital periods. For system_1, the orbital period is 2 years with radial velocity amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, the period is 1 year with amplitudes of 15 km/s and 10 km/s. The total mass of a binary system can be estimated using the formula: M1 + M2 = (v1 + v2)^3 * P / (2 * pi * G), where v1 and v2 are the radial velocity amplitudes, P is the period, and G is the gravitational constant. The total mass is proportional to the cube of the sum of the radial velocities times the period. For system_1, the sum of the velocities is 15 km/s and for system_2, it is 25 km/s. The ratio of the masses is then ((15 km/s)^3 * 2 years) / ((25 km/s)^3 * 1 year). This simplifies to (3375 * 2) / 15625, which is approximately 0.432. Thus, system_1 is approximately 0.432 times as massive as system_2. Therefore, the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2 is approximately 0.4, which corresponds to choice A).
