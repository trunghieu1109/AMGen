Question: Example(question='You identified a new quorum-sensing peptide in the bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus. You are highly interested if its role in intercellular communication is conserved among the eukaryotes. You treat yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with the peptide and interestingly observe the formation of the shmoo. You want to learn about the proteome of the active chromatin in the shmoo and recover it by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. The least of proteins from which complex below will you observe in your assay?', choice1='pre-initiation complex', choice2='pre-replication complex', choice3='enhancer protein complex', choice4='nucleosome histone complex', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_151
proposed answer: In the context of active chromatin during transcriptional activation, the pre-initiation complex, enhancer protein complex, and nucleosome histone complex are all associated with transcriptional activity. The pre-initiation complex is involved in the assembly of transcription machinery at promoters, the enhancer protein complex enhances transcriptional activity, and the nucleosome histone complex is a structural component of chromatin that can be modified to allow transcription. These complexes are expected to be present and abundant in active chromatin. On the other hand, the pre-replication complex is primarily involved in DNA replication, not transcription. It is formed at origins of replication during the G1 phase of the cell cycle to prepare for DNA synthesis in the S phase. Since the pre-replication complex is not directly involved in transcriptional activation, it is least likely to be observed in a ChIP-MS assay targeting active chromatin during shmoo formation, which is associated with mating and signaling rather than replication.

proposed answer: In the context of shmoo formation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the yeast cells are typically arrested in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. During this phase, transcriptional activity is high, and the pre-initiation complex, which is involved in the initiation of transcription, would be expected to be abundant in active chromatin regions. The nucleosome histone complex is a fundamental part of chromatin and would also be present as it is involved in DNA packaging and regulation. The enhancer protein complex is not a canonical component in yeast as it is in metazoans, so its presence would be minimal or absent. The pre-replication complex is associated with DNA replication origins and would be less prevalent in G1-arrested cells, which are not actively replicating DNA. Therefore, the least observed protein complex in the ChIP-MS assay on active chromatin in shmoo-forming yeast cells would be the pre-replication complex due to the cell cycle arrest in G1.
