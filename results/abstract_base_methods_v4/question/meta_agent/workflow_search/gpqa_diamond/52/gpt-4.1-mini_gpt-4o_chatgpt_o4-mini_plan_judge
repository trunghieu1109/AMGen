Question: Example(question='You have prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The FTIR spectrum of this compound shows absorption peaks indicating the presence of an ester group. The 1H NMR spectrum shows six signals: two signals corresponding to aromatic-H, two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups. There are no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups. Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, or C12H14O2.', choice1='C12H14O2', choice2='C12H12O2', choice3='C11H14O2', choice4='C11H12O2', correct_index=4)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_52
proposed answer: The spectral analysis and structural deductions from the sub-task indicate that the compound has six signals in the 1H NMR spectrum: two for aromatic protons, two for vinyl protons, and two for methyl groups, with no -CH2 signals. This suggests a di-substituted aromatic ring with an ester group, a vinyl group, and two methyl groups, totaling 12 hydrogens. The FTIR spectrum confirms the presence of an ester group. The chemical formula C12H12O2 accounts for these features: it includes the aromatic ring, ester group, vinyl group, and two methyl groups, fitting the spectral data. Other formulas either have too many hydrogens or do not match the substitution pattern indicated by the NMR data. All agents agree that the correct molecular formula is C12H12O2, which corresponds to choice B.

proposed answer: The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of an ester group, and the 1H NMR spectrum shows signals for two aromatic protons, two vinyl protons, and two methyl groups, with no methylene signals. This suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring and a methacrylate ester structure. The molecular formula C12H14O2 accounts for all observed protons and carbons: C6H4 from the aromatic ring, C4H4O2 from the ester group, and C2H6 from the methyl groups. The degrees of unsaturation calculation, which is 6 (4 from the aromatic ring, 1 from the vinyl group, and 1 from the ester group), supports the molecular formula C12H14O2. Other formulas do not fit the spectral data as well. C11H12O2 and C11H14O2 lack sufficient protons and carbons, while C12H12O2 lacks enough hydrogens for the methyl and vinyl groups. Therefore, the most consistent formula is C12H14O2.
