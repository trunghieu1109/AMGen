To ensure it is normalized, we need to check that its norm is 1. The norm of a vector (a, b) is given by sqrt(a^2 + b^2). For the vector (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)), the norm is sqrt(cos^2(θ/2) + sin^2(θ/2)). Using the Pythagorean identity, we know that cos^2(θ/2) + sin^2(θ/2) = 1.

This can be rewritten as two simultaneous equations: 1) cos(theta) * a + sin(theta) * b = a, and 2) sin(theta) * a - cos(theta) * b = b. Rearranging these gives: a * (cos(theta) - 1) + b * sin(theta) = 0, and a * sin(theta) - b * (cos(theta) + 1) = 0. For a non-trivial solution (a, b not both zero), the determinant of the coefficient matrix must be zero: det([[cos(theta) - 1, sin(theta)], [sin(theta), -(cos(theta) + 1)]]) = 0. Simplifying, this determinant condition is automatically satisfied for any theta, indicating that the equations are dependent. Solving one equation in terms of the other, assume b = k * a, then a * (cos(theta) - 1) + k * a * sin(theta) = 0, leading to k = (1 - cos(theta)) / sin(theta). Using trigonometric identities, k simplifies to tan(theta/2). Thus, b = tan(theta/2) * a. The eigenvector can be written as |psi> = a * [1, tan(theta/2)]^T. To normalize, we set the magnitude of |psi> to 1: sqrt(1 + tan^2(theta/2)) = 1, which implies a = cos(theta/2).

Rearranging terms, we get: (cos(theta) - 1) * a + sin(theta) * b = 0 and sin(theta) * a - (cos(theta) + 1) * b = 0. These equations imply that the determinant of the coefficient matrix must be zero for non-trivial solutions. Solving this system, we find that a = cos(theta/2) and b = sin(theta/2) satisfy the equations.

To solve for the eigenvector |psi>, we need to find the values of 'a' and 'b' that satisfy this equation. This can be rewritten as a system of linear equations: 1) cos(theta)*a + sin(theta)*b = a, and 2) sin(theta)*a - cos(theta)*b = b. Simplifying these equations: 1) (cos(theta) - 1)*a + sin(theta)*b = 0, and 2) sin(theta)*a - (cos(theta) + 1)*b = 0. To find a non-trivial solution, the determinant of the coefficients matrix must be zero. However, solving directly, the first equation implies sin(theta)*b = (1 - cos(theta))*a, and the second equation gives sin(theta)*a = (cos(theta) + 1)*b. These can be solved by setting a = cos(theta/2) and b = sin(theta/2), which satisfy both equations when normalized.
