        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The problem statement provides the components of the quantum mechanical operator \\( \\vec{P} \\) in terms of 2x2 matrices multiplied by \\( \\hbar/2 \\). The \\( X \\)-component, \\( P_x \\), is given as a matrix with elements in the first row as (0, 1) and in the second row as (1, 0). This corresponds to the Pauli matrix \\( \\sigma_x \\). The \\( Y \\)-component, \\( P_y \\), is given as a matrix with elements in the first row as (0, -i) and in the second row as (i, 0), which corresponds to the Pauli matrix \\( \\sigma_y \\). The \\( Z \\)-component, \\( P_z \\), is given as a matrix with elements in the first row as (1, 0) and in the second row as (0, -1), which corresponds to the Pauli matrix \\( \\sigma_z \\). Therefore, the components are: \\( P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\), \\( P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\), and \\( P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\).; answer - Px = (\\hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]], Py = (\\hbar/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]], Pz = (\\hbar/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - The direction vector \\( \\vec{n} \\) lies in the x-z plane, which means it has no component in the y-direction. Therefore, it can be expressed in terms of an angle \\( \\theta \\) as \\( \\vec{n} = (\\sin(\\theta), 0, \\cos(\\theta)) \\). This parameterization is typical for vectors in the x-z plane, where \\( \\theta \\) is the angle the vector makes with the z-axis. The sine and cosine functions are used to ensure that the vector is normalized (i.e., it has a magnitude of 1), as \\( \\sin^2(\\theta) + \\cos^2(\\theta) = 1 \\). This representation allows us to express any direction in the x-z plane in terms of the angle \\( \\theta \\).; answer - n = (sin(theta), 0, cos(theta))\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - To construct the operator P_n along the direction n, we need to form a linear combination of the operators P_x, P_y, and P_z using the components of the vector n. From sub-task 2, we have n = (sin(theta), 0, cos(theta)). Therefore, n_x = sin(theta), n_y = 0, and n_z = cos(theta). Using the matrices from sub-task 1, we have: P_x = (\\hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]], P_y = (\\hbar/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]], and P_z = (\\hbar/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]. The operator P_n is given by: P_n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z = sin(theta) * P_x + 0 * P_y + cos(theta) * P_z. Substituting the matrices, we get: P_n = sin(theta) * (\\hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] + cos(theta) * (\\hbar/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]. Simplifying, we have: P_n = (\\hbar/2) * [sin(theta) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] + cos(theta) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]]. This results in: P_n = (\\hbar/2) * [[cos(theta), sin(theta)], [sin(theta), -cos(theta)]].; answer - P_n = (\\hbar/2) * [[cos(theta), sin(theta)], [sin(theta), -cos(theta)]]\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - To set up the eigenvalue equation for the operator P_n, we use the result from sub-task 3, where P_n is given by the matrix: P_n = (\\hbar/2) * [[cos(theta), sin(theta)], [sin(theta), -cos(theta)]]. The eigenvalue equation is P_n |psi> = (+\\hbar/2) |psi>. Substituting the matrix for P_n, we have: (\\hbar/2) * [[cos(theta), sin(theta)], [sin(theta), -cos(theta)]] * |psi> = (+\\hbar/2) |psi>. Let |psi> be a column vector |psi> = [a, b]^T. The matrix equation becomes: (\\hbar/2) * [[cos(theta), sin(theta)], [sin(theta), -cos(theta)]] * [a, b]^T = (+\\hbar/2) * [a, b]^T. Simplifying, we get: [[cos(theta), sin(theta)], [sin(theta), -cos(theta)]] * [a, b]^T = [a, b]^T. This is the explicit matrix equation for the eigenvalue problem.; answer - [[cos(theta), sin(theta)], [sin(theta), -cos(theta)]] * [a, b]^T = [a, b]^T\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - All agents agree that the solution to the eigenvalue equation for the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +\u0127/2 is (cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)). They derived this by solving the system of linear equations obtained from the eigenvalue equation, ensuring the determinant condition for non-trivial solutions is met. The solution is consistent across all agents, indicating a consensus. The eigenvector is normalized, as the magnitude of (cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)) is 1, satisfying the requirement for a normalized eigenvector.; answer - (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 6 output: thinking - The eigenvector obtained in Sub-task 5 is (cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)). To ensure it is normalized, we need to check that its norm is 1. The norm of a vector (a, b) is given by sqrt(a^2 + b^2). For the vector (cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)), the norm is sqrt(cos^2(\u03b8/2) + sin^2(\u03b8/2)). Using the Pythagorean identity, we know that cos^2(\u03b8/2) + sin^2(\u03b8/2) = 1. Therefore, the norm of the vector is sqrt(1) = 1, which means the vector is already normalized. Thus, the normalized eigenvector is (cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)).; answer - (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 7 output: thinking - The normalized eigenvector obtained in Sub-task 6 is (cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)). We need to compare this with the given multiple-choice options to find the correct form. The options are: 1) (cos(\u03b8), e^{i\u03c6}sin(\u03b8)), 2) (\u221a(2/3)\u0127, \u221a(1/3)\u0127), 3) (cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)), 4) (\u221a(2/3)\u0127 cos(\u03b8/2), \u221a(1/3)\u0127 sin(\u03b8/2)). The form (cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)) matches exactly with choice 3. Therefore, the correct normalized eigenvector form is choice 3.; answer - C)"
