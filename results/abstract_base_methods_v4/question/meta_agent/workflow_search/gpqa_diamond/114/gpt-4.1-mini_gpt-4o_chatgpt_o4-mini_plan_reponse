        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The Lorentz factor \\( \\gamma \\) is given by the formula \\( \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} \\), where \\( v \\) is the velocity of the particle and \\( c \\) is the speed of light. For the electron, \\( \\gamma = 4 \\), so we have \\( 4 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v_e^2}{c^2}}} \\). Solving for \\( v_e \\), we get \\( v_e = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{16}} = c \\sqrt{\\frac{15}{16}} = c \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{4} \\). For the positron, \\( \\gamma = 2 \\), so we have \\( 2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v_p^2}{c^2}}} \\). Solving for \\( v_p \\), we get \\( v_p = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{4}} = c \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{4}} = c \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\). Therefore, the velocities are \\( v_e = c \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{4} \\) for the electron and \\( v_p = c \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\) for the positron.; answer - The velocity of the electron is \\( v_e = c \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{4} \\) and the velocity of the positron is \\( v_p = c \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\).\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - To calculate the total energy and momentum of the electron-positron system before annihilation, we use the relativistic energy and momentum formulas. The total energy of a particle is given by E = \u03b3mc^2, where \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor, m is the rest mass, and c is the speed of light. The momentum is given by p = \u03b3mv, where v is the velocity. For the electron, with Lorentz factor 4, E_e = 4mc^2 and p_e = 4mv_e = 4m(c\u221a15/4) = mc\u221a15. For the positron, with Lorentz factor 2, E_p = 2mc^2 and p_p = 2mv_p = 2m(c\u221a3/2) = mc\u221a3. The total energy before annihilation is E_total = E_e + E_p = 4mc^2 + 2mc^2 = 6mc^2. The total momentum is the vector sum of the momenta: since the electron is moving to the right and the positron to the left, their momenta are in opposite directions. Thus, p_total = mc\u221a15 - mc\u221a3. Therefore, the total energy is 6mc^2 and the total momentum is mc(\u221a15 - \u221a3).; answer - The total energy of the system before annihilation is 6mc^2, and the total momentum is mc(\u221a15 - \u221a3).\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - In the annihilation event, the conservation of energy and momentum principles must be applied. Initially, the total energy of the system is 6mc^2, and the total momentum is mc(\u221a15 - \u221a3). After annihilation, two photons are produced, each with energy E_photon. Since the photons have the same energy, we have 2E_photon = 6mc^2, so E_photon = 3mc^2. The momentum of each photon is given by p_photon = E_photon/c = 3mc. The directions of the photons are such that one is moving in the upper-right direction and the other in the lower-right direction. Let \u03b8 be the angle between the directions of the two photons. The conservation of momentum in the horizontal direction gives: 3mc cos(\u03b8/2) + 3mc cos(\u03b8/2) = mc(\u221a15 - \u221a3), which simplifies to 6mc cos(\u03b8/2) = mc(\u221a15 - \u221a3). Solving for cos(\u03b8/2), we get cos(\u03b8/2) = (\u221a15 - \u221a3)/6. Using the identity cos(\u03b8/2) = cos(90\u00b0 - \u03b8/2), we find \u03b8 = 138\u00b0. The reasoning is consistent with the conservation laws and the given conditions, and the final angle between the photons is 138\u00b0.; answer - 138\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - All agents agree that the angle between the photons is 138\u00b0, based on the conservation of energy and momentum principles. The symmetry of the problem, with both photons having equal energies and being emitted symmetrically with respect to the horizontal axis, leads to the conclusion that the angle between the photons is twice the angle each photon makes with the horizontal axis. The calculations provided by the agents consistently yield an angle of 138\u00b0, which satisfies the conditions of the problem.; answer - 138\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - The problem involves the annihilation of an electron and a positron, resulting in two photons. The conservation of momentum and energy principles dictate that the photons are emitted symmetrically with respect to the horizontal axis.
