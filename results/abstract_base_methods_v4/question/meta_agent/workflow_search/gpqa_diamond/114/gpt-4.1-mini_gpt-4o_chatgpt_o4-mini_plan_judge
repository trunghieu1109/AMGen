Question: Example(question='An electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is also moving along the horizontal axis, but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After colliding, both annihilate producing 2 photons.\n\nThe energies of both photons were measured and they have the same value. The directions were also measured. One of the photons was moving in the upper-right direction, while another in the lower-right direction.\n\nWhat is the angle between the directions of the photons?', choice1='96', choice2='74', choice3='138', choice4='172', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_6_114
proposed answer: The problem involves the annihilation of an electron and a positron, resulting in two photons. The conservation of momentum and energy principles dictate that the photons are emitted symmetrically with respect to the horizontal axis. Given that both photons have the same energy and are emitted in opposite directions (one in the upper-right and the other in the lower-right), the angle between them is determined by the symmetry of the situation. The calculations and reasoning provided in the sub-task indicate that the angle between the photons is 138°. This is consistent with the conservation laws and the symmetry of the problem. Therefore, the correct answer is 138°.
