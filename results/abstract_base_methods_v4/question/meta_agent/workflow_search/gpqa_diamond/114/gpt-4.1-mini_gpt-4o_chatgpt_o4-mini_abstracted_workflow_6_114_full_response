The total energy of a particle is given by E = γmc^2, where γ is the Lorentz factor, m is the rest mass, and c is the speed of light. The momentum is given by p = γmv, where v is the velocity. For the electron, with Lorentz factor 4, E_e = 4mc^2 and p_e = 4mv_e = 4m(c√15/4) = mc√15. For the positron, with Lorentz factor 2, E_p = 2mc^2 and p_p = 2mv_p = 2m(c√3/2) = mc√3.

The rest mass energy of an electron (and positron) is given by E_0 = m_e c^2, where m_e is the rest mass of the electron. The total energy of a particle is given by E = \x1e\x1e gamma \x1e\x1e m_e c^2, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. The momentum p is given by p = \x1e\x1e gamma \x1e\x1e m_e v. For the electron, with Lorentz factor 4, its total energy is E_e = 4 m_e c^2, and its momentum is p_e = 4 m_e v_e. For the positron, with Lorentz factor 2, its total energy is E_p = 2 m_e c^2, and its momentum is p_p = 2 m_e v_p. The total energy of the system is E_total = E_e + E_p = 4 m_e c^2 + 2 m_e c^2 = 6 m_e c^2. The total momentum is the vector sum of the momenta of the electron and positron. Since they are moving in opposite directions along the horizontal axis, we have p_total = p_e - p_p = 4 m_e v_e - 2 m_e v_p. Substituting the velocities, we get p_total = 4 m_e (c \x1e\x1e sqrt{15}/4) - 2 m_e (c \x1e\x1e sqrt{3}/2) = m_e c \x1e\x1e sqrt{15} - m_e c \x1e\x1e sqrt{3}.

The rest mass energy of an electron (or positron) is given by E_0 = m_e c^2, where m_e is the rest mass of the electron. The total energy of a particle with Lorentz factor γ is given by E = γ m_e c^2. For the electron with Lorentz factor 4, the total energy is E_e = 4 m_e c^2. For the positron with Lorentz factor 2, the total energy is E_p = 2 m_e c^2. Therefore, the total energy of the system is E_total = E_e + E_p = 4 m_e c^2 + 2 m_e c^2 = 6 m_e c^2. The momentum of a particle is given by p = γ m_e v. For the electron, p_e = 4 m_e (c sqrt(15)/4) = m_e c sqrt(15). For the positron, p_p = 2 m_e (c sqrt(3)/2) = m_e c sqrt(3). Since the electron and positron are moving in opposite directions, the total momentum is p_total = p_e - p_p = m_e c sqrt(15) - m_e c sqrt(3). Therefore, the total energy is 6 m_e c^2 and the total momentum is m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).; answer: The total energy of the system is 6 m_e c^2 and the total momentum is m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent NRTL, apply conservation laws and establish photon relations, thinking: In the annihilation event, the total energy and momentum of the system must be conserved. Before the collision, the total energy is 6mc^2 and the total momentum is mc(√15 - √3). After the collision, two photons are produced, each with energy E_photon. Since the photons have the same energy, we have 2E_photon = 6mc^2, so E_photon = 3mc^2. The momentum of each photon is given by p_photon = E_photon/c = 3mc. The directions of the photons are such that one is moving in the upper-right direction and the other in the lower-right direction. Let θ be the angle between the directions of the two photons. The momentum conservation in the horizontal direction gives: 3mc cos(θ/2) + 3mc cos(θ/2) = mc(√15 - √3), which simplifies to 6mc cos(θ/2) = mc(√15 - √3). Solving for cos(θ/2), we get cos(θ/2) = (√15 - √3)/6.

Initially, the total energy is 6mc^2, and the momentum is mc(√15 - √3). After annihilation, two photons are produced with equal energy, E_photon = 3mc^2. The momentum of each photon is 3mc. The directions are such that one photon moves in the upper-right direction and the other in the lower-right direction. Due to symmetry, the horizontal components of the photon momenta must add up to the initial momentum, mc(√15 - √3). This leads to the equation 6mc cos(θ/2) = mc(√15 - √3), yielding cos(θ/2) = (√15 - √3)/6.

Since the total momentum before the collision in the vertical direction is zero, the vertical components of the photons' momenta must cancel each other out. This symmetry ensures that the angle between the directions of the two photons is twice the angle that each photon makes with the horizontal axis. In the previous reasoning, it was determined that the angle between the photons is 138°, which satisfies the conservation of momentum and energy.

Initially, the electron and positron have a combined energy of 6mc^2 and a momentum of mc(√15 - √3). After annihilation, two photons are produced with equal energies. The symmetry of the problem and the conservation of momentum imply that the photons must have equal and opposite vertical components of momentum, meaning they are symmetric with respect to the horizontal axis. This symmetry indicates that the angle between the photons is twice the angle each photon makes with the horizontal axis.

The conservation of momentum requires that the horizontal components of the photon momenta sum to equal the initial momentum of the electron-positron system. This initial momentum was calculated as mc(√15 - √3). Since the photons have equal energies, their momenta are equal as well. The symmetry with respect to the horizontal axis implies that the angle between the photons is twice the angle each photon makes with the horizontal axis.
