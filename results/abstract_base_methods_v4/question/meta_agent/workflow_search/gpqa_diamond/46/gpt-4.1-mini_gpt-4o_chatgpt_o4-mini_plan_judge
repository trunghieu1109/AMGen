Iteration: abstracted_workflow_5_46
proposed answer: The IR spectrum shows peaks indicative of an amine or amide group (N-H stretching at 3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1) and a carbonyl group (C=O stretching at 1720 cm-1). The 1H NMR data suggests the presence of an ethyl group (1.20 ppm, t, 3H; 4.5 ppm, q, 2H), a para-substituted aromatic ring (7.0 ppm, d, 2H; 8.0 ppm, d, 2H), and possibly NH2 protons (4.0 ppm, bs, 2H). The molecular formula C9H11NO2 suggests an aromatic ring, an ethyl group, and an amine or amide group. Evaluating the given choices: 1) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide has an ethoxy group instead of an ethyl group, which does not match the NMR data. 2) 4-aminophenyl propionate has a propionate group instead of an ethyl ester, inconsistent with the NMR data. 3) 3-ethoxybenzamide has an ethoxy group and an amide, which does not match the NMR data indicating an ethyl group. 4) Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate has an ethyl ester group, a para-substituted aromatic ring, and an amine group, consistent with the IR and NMR data. Thus, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate best fits all spectral data and molecular formula constraints.

proposed answer: The spectral data provided includes IR and 1H NMR information. The IR spectrum shows medium to strong intensity bands at 3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1, which are indicative of N-H stretching, suggesting the presence of an amine group. There is also a strong band at 1720 cm-1, which is characteristic of a carbonyl group, likely an ester. The 1H NMR data shows signals at 1.20 ppm (triplet, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (quartet, 2H), which are consistent with an ethyl group. A broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H) suggests NH2 protons. The aromatic region shows doublets at 7.0 ppm and 8.0 ppm, each integrating to 2H, indicating a para-substituted benzene ring. Among the given choices, 'ethyl 4-aminobenzoate' (choice D) contains an ethyl group, an amino group, and a para-substituted benzene ring, which matches the spectral data. Therefore, the correct compound choice is 'ethyl 4-aminobenzoate', corresponding to option D.
