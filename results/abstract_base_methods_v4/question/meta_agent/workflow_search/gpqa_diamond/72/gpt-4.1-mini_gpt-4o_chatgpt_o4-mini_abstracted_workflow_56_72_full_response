If one object is moving with velocity u = 0.6c and another with velocity v = 0.5c in the same direction, the velocity of the second object relative to the first is given by: v_rel = (v - u) / (1 - uv/c^2). Substituting the given values, v_rel = (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.5 * 0.6)) = -0.1c / (1 - 0.3) = -0.1c / 0.7 = -0.142857c.
