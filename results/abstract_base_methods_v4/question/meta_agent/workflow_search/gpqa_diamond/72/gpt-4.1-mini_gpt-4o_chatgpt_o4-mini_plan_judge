Question: Example(question='Two astronauts of masses 2m and 3m travel at relativistic speeds of 0.6 c and 0.5 c, respectively, in the positive x-direction. Here, c is the speed of light. What will be the relative speed and the total energy of the system?', choice1='v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2', choice2='v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2', choice3='v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2', choice4='v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_56_72
proposed answer: The calculated relative velocity from Sub-task 2 is v_rel = 0.14c, and the total energy from Sub-task 4 is E = 5.96 mc^2. Comparing these results with the given multiple-choice options: Choice 1 has v_rel = 0.14c and E = 5.96 mc^2, which matches exactly with our calculations. Choices 2, 3, and 4 have either different relative velocities or total energy values that do not match our calculations. Therefore, the correct answer is Choice 1.
