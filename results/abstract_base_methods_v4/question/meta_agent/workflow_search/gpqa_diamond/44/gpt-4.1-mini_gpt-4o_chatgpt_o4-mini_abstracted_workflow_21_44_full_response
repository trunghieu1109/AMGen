From Sub-task 2, the allowed states are (1, +1/2), (1, -1/2), (2, +1/2), and (2, -1/2). These states correspond to the lowest energy levels n = 1 and n = 2, with both spin orientations. The energy for each state is given by E_n = n^2 * E. Therefore, the energies for the occupied states are: E_1 = 1^2 * E = E for (1, +1/2) and (1, -1/2), and E_2 = 2^2 * E = 4E for (2, +1/2) and (2, -1/2).

We need to promote fermions to higher single-particle states. The possible promotions are: 1) Promote a fermion from n=1 to n=3, resulting in (1, -1/2), (2, +1/2), (3, +1/2), (3, -1/2) with energy E + 4E + 9E + 9E = 23E; 2) Promote a fermion from n=2 to n=3, resulting in (1, +1/2), (1, -1/2), (3, +1/2), (3, -1/2) with energy E + E + 9E + 9E = 20E; 3) Promote a fermion from n=2 to n=4, resulting in (1, +1/2), (1, -1/2), (3, +1/2), (4, +1/2) with energy E + E + 9E + 16E = 27E. The configuration with the lowest energy is (1, +1/2), (1, -1/2), (3, +1/2), (3, -1/2) with total energy 20E. Therefore, the second excited state energy is 20E. However, since we are looking for configurations that are higher than the first excited state, we need to ensure that we are promoting two particles to achieve the next excited state. Let's consider two-particle promotions: 1) Promote one fermion from n=1 to n=3 and another from n=2 to n=3, resulting in (1, -1/2), (3, +1/2), (3, -1/2), (3, +1/2) with energy E + 9E + 9E + 9E = 28E; 2) Promote one fermion from n=1 to n=3 and another from n=2 to n=4, resulting in (1, -1/2), (3, +1/2), (3, -1/2), (4, +1/2) with energy E + 9E + 9E + 16E = 35E. The configuration with the lowest energy from two-particle promotions is (1, -1/2), (3, +1/2), (3, -1/2), (3, +1/2) with total energy 28E. Therefore, the second excited state energy is 28E.; answer: The second excited state configuration involves promoting two fermions from the first excited state to higher states, resulting in configurations such as (1, -1/2), (3, +1/2), (3, -1/2), (3, +1/2) with total energy 28E.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent 6F0Q, enumerate second excited state configurations, thinking: To find the second excited state, we start from the first excited state configuration identified as (1, +1/2), (1, -1/2), (2, +1/2), (3, +1/2) with a total energy of 15E.
