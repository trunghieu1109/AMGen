The problem states that E = (pi^2 * hbar^2) / (2mL^2), which is the energy of the first level (n=1). Therefore, the energy levels in terms of E are E_n = n^2 * E.

Each energy level can hold up to two fermions of opposite spin. The single-particle energy levels are E, 4E, 9E, etc. In the ground state, the four fermions will occupy the lowest available energy levels with different quantum numbers and spins. The lowest energy configuration is two fermions in the n=1 level (one spin up, one spin down) and two fermions in the n=2 level (one spin up, one spin down). The total energy is 2E + 8E = 10E. For the first excited state, one fermion is moved to the next available level, n=3. This results in energies 2E (n=1) + 4E (n=2) + 9E (n=3) = 15E. For the second excited state, another fermion is moved to n=3, resulting in 2E (n=1) + 18E (n=3) = 20E. However, the correct configuration for the second excited state, considering the choices, is likely 2E (n=1) + 4E (n=2) + 9E (n=3) + 9E (n=3) = 24E, but this doesn't match the choices.

The total energy for this configuration is 2E (from two fermions in the n=1 level) + 8E (from two fermions in the n=2 level) = 10E.

To find the first excited state, we need to promote one fermion to the next higher energy level while respecting the Pauli exclusion principle. The next available energy level is n=3, which has an energy of 9E. By moving one fermion from the n=2 level to the n=3 level, the configuration becomes: two fermions in the n=1 level (2E), one fermion in the n=2 level (4E), and one fermion in the n=3 level (9E). The total energy for this configuration is 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.

The energies of the states are given by E_n = n^2 * E, where E is a constant. The Pauli exclusion principle must be respected, meaning no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state. In the ground state, the configuration is two fermions in n=1 and two in n=2, giving a total energy of 10E. For the first excited state, one fermion is promoted to n=3, resulting in a total energy of 15E. For the second excited state, we need to promote another fermion to a higher energy level. The possible configurations for the second excited state are: 1) two fermions in n=1, one in n=3, and one in n=4, resulting in a total energy of 2E + 9E + 16E = 27E; 2) one fermion in each of n=1, n=2, n=3, and n=4, resulting in a total energy of 1E + 4E + 9E + 16E = 30E.
