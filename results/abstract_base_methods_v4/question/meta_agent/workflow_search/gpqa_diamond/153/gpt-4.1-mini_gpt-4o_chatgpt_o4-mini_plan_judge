Question: Example(question='In the lab, a chemist discovers an unnamed bottle with a white solid inside. He gathers the following spectral information in order to identify the liquid. Make a reasonable structural suggestion for the unidentified drug using the information provided.\nMass: molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 (100%)\na peak at m/z = 158 (32%)\nIR : broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1, strong sharp peak at 1720 cm-1\n1H NMR: 11.0 ppm (s, 1H), 8.02 ppm (d, 2H), 7.72 (d, 2H)', choice1='4-chlorobenzoic acid', choice2='2-chlorobenzoic acid', choice3='3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde\n', choice4='Phenyl chloroformate', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: The spectral data provided includes a molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 and a secondary peak at m/z = 158, indicating the presence of a chlorine atom due to its isotopic pattern. The IR spectrum shows a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1, suggesting an O-H stretch typical of carboxylic acids, and a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1, indicative of a carbonyl group (C=O). The 1H NMR data shows a singlet at 11.0 ppm, consistent with a carboxylic acid proton, and two doublets at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm, suggesting aromatic protons in a para-substitution pattern. Among the choices, 4-chlorobenzoic acid fits these spectral features: it has a carboxylic acid group (accounting for the O-H and C=O peaks), a chlorine atom (explaining the isotopic pattern), and a para-substituted benzene ring (matching the NMR data). The other options either lack the carboxylic acid group or do not match the substitution pattern suggested by the NMR data. Therefore, the most reasonable structural suggestion is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.
