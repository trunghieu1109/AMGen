The total angular momentum quantum number for the system is l = 2, and the z-component of the total angular momentum is m = -1. These quantum numbers describe the coupled state of the two electrons in the p orbital.; answer - The individual electron orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are l1 = 1 and l2 = 1. The total coupled angular momentum quantum number is l = 2, and its z-component is m = -1.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - The coupled angular momentum state |1,1,2,-1> can be expressed in terms of the uncoupled basis states |1, m1> \u2297 |1, m2> using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. For two electrons each with l = 1, the possible values of the total angular momentum L are 0, 1, and 2. We are given the state |1,1,2,-1>, which means the total L is 2 and its z-component m is -1. We need to find the combination of m1 and m2 such that their sum is -1. The possible combinations are: (m1, m2) = (0, -1), (-1, 0), and (-1, -1). We use the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients to find the coefficients for these combinations in the |1,1,2,-1> state. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for |1, 0> \u2297 |1, -1> to |2, -1> is sqrt(1/3), for |1, -1> \u2297 |1, 0> to |2, -1> is sqrt(1/3), and for |1, -1> \u2297 |1, -1> to |2, -1> is sqrt(1/3).

However, to determine the probability of each pair in the coupled state |1, 1, 2, -1>, we need to consider the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The pair (-1, -1) is of particular interest because it corresponds to both electrons having Lz = -\u0127, which is the condition we are interested in for the joint probability calculation. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients will tell us the probability amplitude for each pair in the state |1, 1, 2, -1>.; answer - The possible pairs (m1, m2) that satisfy m1 + m2 = -1 are (-1, 0), (0, -1), and (-1, -1).\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for the expansion of the coupled state |1,1,2,-1> in terms of the uncoupled basis states |1, m1> \u2297 |1, m2> are determined by the combinations of m1 and m2 that satisfy m1 + m2 = -1. The possible pairs are (-1, 0), (0, -1), and (-1, -1). For each of these pairs, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is sqrt(1/3). This is consistent across all the debate agents' calculations and aligns with standard Clebsch-Gordan tables for adding angular momenta. Therefore, the expansion of the state |1,1,2,-1> in terms of the uncoupled basis states is: sqrt(1/3) |1, 0> \u2297 |1, -1> + sqrt(1/3) |1, -1> \u2297 |1, 0> + sqrt(1/3) |1, -1> \u2297 |1, -1>.; answer - |1,1,2,-1> = sqrt(1/3) |1, 0> \u2297 |1, -1> + sqrt(1/3) |1, -1> \u2297 |1, 0> + sqrt(1/3) |1, -1> \u2297 |1, -1>.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - The uncoupled basis state corresponding to the measurement outcome where both L1z and L2z have eigenvalues -\u0127 is the state where m1 = -1 and m2 = -1.
