The quantum numbers involved are: l1 and l2, which are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers for each electron. Since they are in a p orbital, l1 = l2 = 1. The total coupled angular momentum quantum number is l, and its z-component is m. The given state is |1,1,2,-1>, which means l1 = 1, l2 = 1, l = 2, and m = -1. This state represents the total angular momentum of the two-electron system, where the total angular momentum quantum number l is 2, and the z-component of the total angular momentum m is -1.; answer - The quantum numbers are: l1 = 1, l2 = 1, l = 2, m = -1. This is because the state |1,1,2,-1> indicates that each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number of 1 (p orbital), the total angular momentum quantum number is 2, and the z-component of the total angular momentum is -1.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - For two electrons each with orbital angular momentum quantum number l1 = l2 = 1, the possible magnetic quantum numbers for each electron are m1, m2 = -1, 0, or 1.

The coupled state |l1, l2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1> is a combination of the uncoupled states |1, m1> ⊗ |1, m2>. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for a given pair (m1, m2) is denoted as ⟨1, m1; 1, m2 | 2, -1⟩. For the pair (m1, m2) = (-1, 0), the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is ⟨1, -1; 1, 0 | 2, -1⟩ = √(1/3). For the pair (m1, m2) = (0, -1), the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is ⟨1, 0; 1, -1 | 2, -1⟩ = √(2/3). These coefficients are obtained from standard Clebsch-Gordan tables. The normalization condition for the state |1,1,2,-1> is satisfied because the sum of the squares of the coefficients is 1: (√(1/3))^2 + (√(2/3))^2 = 1/3 + 2/3 = 1.; answer - The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are: ⟨1, -1; 1, 0 | 2, -1⟩ = √(1/3) and ⟨1, 0; 1, -1 | 2, -1⟩ = √(2/3).\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients obtained in Sub-task 3 are ⟨1, -1; 1, 0 | 2, -1⟩ = √(1/3) and ⟨1, 0; 1, -1 | 2, -1⟩ = √(2/3).

The formula for the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient ⟨j1, m1; j2, m2 | j, m⟩ is given by a specific expression involving factorials and square roots, which matches the values obtained. Additionally, the selection rules for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients require that m = m1 + m2, which is satisfied here as -1 = -1 + 0 and -1 = 0 + (-1). The normalization condition is also satisfied, as the sum of the squares of the coefficients is 1: (√(1/3))^2 + (√(2/3))^2 = 1/3 + 2/3 = 1.

The pair (-1, -1) does not satisfy the condition m1 + m2 = -1, which is required for the coupled state |1,1,2,-1>. Therefore, the specific uncoupled basis state corresponding to m1 = -1 and m2 = -1 does not contribute to the coupled state |1,1,2,-1>, and thus the probability of measuring both L1z and L2z as -ħ is zero.; answer - 0\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 6 output: thinking - The state |1,1,2,-1> is a coupled state of two p-orbital electrons, where each electron has l=1.

The pair (m1, m2) = (-1, -1) does not satisfy m1 + m2 = -1, so it does not appear in the expansion. Therefore, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for |1, -1> ⊗ |1, -1> is 0.

The possible pairs are: (m1, m2) = (-1, 0), (0, -1), and (-1, -1). These pairs satisfy the condition m1 + m2 = -1. However, since the total coupled state is |1,1,2,-1>, we are interested in the contribution to this specific state, which is a linear combination of these pairs.
