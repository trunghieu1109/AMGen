Question: Example(question='Compound X, which has the following IR and NMR data, reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Identify the final product.\nIR: 3400â€“2500 cm-1, 1720 cm-1, 1610 cm-1, 1450 cm-1\n1H NMR: 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H), 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H), 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).', choice1='1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene', choice2='4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid', choice3='2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid', choice4='1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_5_196
proposed answer: The IR and NMR data suggest the presence of a carboxylic acid and an aromatic ring in the starting compound. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI typically reduces carboxylic acids to hydrocarbons. The predicted final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which aligns with the structure of Choice 1. The other choices either represent the starting compound or have different structural groups that do not match the predicted product. Therefore, the correct multiple-choice answer is A).
