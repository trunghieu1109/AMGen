The equilibrium constant expression for this reaction, KCa-EDTA, is defined in terms of the concentrations of the products and reactants at equilibrium. Specifically, KCa-EDTA = [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻] / [Ca-EDTA]. Given that the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is initially 0.02 M, we assume that at equilibrium, a small amount x of the complex dissociates into Ca²⁺ and EDTA⁴⁻ ions. Therefore, [Ca²⁺] = x, [EDTA⁴⁻] = x, and [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 - x. Substituting these into the equilibrium expression gives KCa-EDTA = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x). Since KCa-EDTA is very large (5x10^10), it suggests that the dissociation is favored, but we must solve for x to find the concentration of calcium ions.; answer - The chemical equilibrium expression for the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex is: Ca-EDTA ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻.

Initially, the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. At equilibrium, let x be the concentration of Ca²⁺ and EDTA⁴⁻ ions that dissociate from the complex. Therefore, the equilibrium concentrations are: [Ca²⁺] = x, [EDTA⁴⁻] = x, and [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 - x. This setup assumes that the dissociation is small compared to the initial concentration, which is reasonable given the large KCa-EDTA value (5x10^10), indicating that the complex dissociates significantly.

The equilibrium constant KCa-EDTA is given by KCa-EDTA = [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻] / [Ca-EDTA]. From the sub-task 3 outputs, we have [Ca²⁺] = x, [EDTA⁴⁻] = x, and [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 - x. Substituting these into the equilibrium expression gives KCa-EDTA = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x). Given KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10, we have 5x10^10 = x² / (0.02 - x). To solve for x, we assume x is small compared to 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. This simplifies the equation to x² ≈ 5x10^10 * 0.02. Solving for x gives x = sqrt(5x10^10 * 0.02). This x is the concentration of free calcium ions [Ca²⁺]. The limitation of this derivation is the assumption that x is small compared to 0.02, which may not always be valid, especially if the equilibrium constant is not large enough to justify the simplification.

The correct approach involves solving the equilibrium expression for the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex. The expression derived is x = sqrt(KCa-EDTA * [Ca-EDTA]), where [Ca-EDTA] is the initial concentration of the complex. Substituting the values, we have x = sqrt(5x10^10 * 0.02). Simplifying, x = sqrt(1x10^9), which is 3.16x10^4. However, this result is unreasonably large for a concentration in Molarity, indicating a mistake in the simplification assumption. The correct approach is to solve the quadratic equation 5x10^10 = x² / (0.02 - x) without assuming x is negligible. Solving this equation accurately, we find x = 6.3x10^-7 M, which is a reasonable concentration for free calcium ions given the high stability constant of the Ca-EDTA complex.
