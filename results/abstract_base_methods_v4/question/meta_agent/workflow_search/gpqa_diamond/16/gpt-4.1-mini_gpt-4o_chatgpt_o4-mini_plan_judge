Question: Example(question='What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex (we assume that the pH is ideal, T = 25 Â°C). KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10.', choice1='1.0x10^-2 M ', choice2='5.0x10^-3 M', choice3='6.3x10^-7 M', choice4='2.0x10^-2 M ', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_1_16
proposed answer: All agents have calculated the free calcium ion concentration to be 6.3x10^-7 M. This value matches exactly with choice C in the provided multiple-choice options. The stability constant of the Ca-EDTA complex is very high, indicating that the concentration of free calcium ions should be very low, which is consistent with the calculated value. Therefore, the correct answer choice is C.

Answer:C
