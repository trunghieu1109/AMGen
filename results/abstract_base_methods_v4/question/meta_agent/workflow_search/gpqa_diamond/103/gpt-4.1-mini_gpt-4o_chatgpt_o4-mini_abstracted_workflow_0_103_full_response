The wavelength shift (Δλ) is related to the radial velocity (v) of the star by the formula Δλ/λ = v/c, where λ is the original wavelength and c is the speed of light. The radial velocity amplitude (K) of the star is directly proportional to the mass of the planet and inversely proportional to the orbital period of the planet (P), as given by the formula K = (2πG/P)^(1/3) * (M_planet * sin(i)) / (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3), where G is the gravitational constant and i is the inclination angle. For circular orbits, the inclination angle is typically assumed to be 90 degrees, making sin(i) = 1. Since both stars have the same mass and both planets have similar masses, the ratio of the radial velocity amplitudes is determined by the ratio of the wavelength shifts. Therefore, the ratio of the orbital periods can be found by comparing the measured wavelength shifts: P2/P1 = (Δλ1/Δλ2)^3/2.; answer - The relationship between the RV method's measured wavelength shifts and the radial velocity amplitudes of the host stars is that the radial velocity amplitude is directly proportional to the wavelength shift.

The periodic wavelength shift is directly proportional to the radial velocity amplitude of the star. This amplitude is related to the mass of the planet, the mass of the star, and the orbital period of the planet. For two planets with similar masses and stars with similar masses, the ratio of the radial velocity amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the wavelength shifts. Since the wavelength shift for planet #1 is 5 milliangstroms and for planet #2 is 7 milliangstroms, the ratio of the radial velocities is 5/7. The radial velocity amplitude is also inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital period (from Kepler's third law), so the ratio of the orbital periods is (5/7)^2.; answer: The relationship is that the ratio of the radial velocity amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the wavelength shifts.

The amplitude of the radial velocity (RV) shift is related to the mass of the planet and the semi-major axis of its orbit. The wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the radial velocity amplitude (K) of the star. Specifically, Δλ/λ = v/c, where v is the radial velocity, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength of the spectral line. Since the mass of the stars and planets are similar and the orbits are circular, the ratio of the wavelength shifts can be used to find the ratio of the radial velocity amplitudes. The RV amplitude K is related to the orbital period P by Kepler's third law and the formula K ∝ (M_planet * sin(i) / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3))), where i is the inclination angle. For circular orbits and similar inclinations, the ratio of the RV amplitudes (K2/K1) is approximately equal to the ratio of the wavelength shifts (Δλ2/Δλ1). Therefore, the ratio of the orbital periods (P2/P1) can be found using Kepler's third law, giving P2/P1 ≈ (Δλ1/Δλ2)^(3/2).; answer: The relationship is that the wavelength shift is directly proportional to the radial velocity amplitude of the star, which is induced by the gravitational pull of the planet.

For a circular orbit, the radial velocity amplitude of the star is given by K = (2 * π * G / P)^(1/3) * (M_p * sin(i)) / (M_s + M_p)^(2/3), where G is the gravitational constant and i is the inclination of the orbit. Since we are assuming the orbits are edge-on (i = 90 degrees, sin(i) = 1) and the planet masses are much smaller than the star masses (M_p << M_s), the formula simplifies to K ≈ (2 * π * G / P)^(1/3) * M_p / M_s^(2/3).

For circular orbits, e = 0, so the formula simplifies to K = (2 * π * a * sin(i)) / P. Using Kepler's third law, a^3 = (G * (M_star + m_p) * P^2) / (4 * π^2), we can express a in terms of P. Assuming sin(i) = 1 for edge-on orbits, we get K = (2 * π * (G * (M_star + m_p) * P^2 / (4 * π^2))^(1/3)) / P.

Assuming the planet masses are much smaller than the star masses, this simplifies to K ≈ (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (M_planet / M_star^(2/3)). Since the masses of the stars and planets are the same for both systems, we can ignore the mass terms and focus on the relationship between K and P. From the formula, we see that K ∝ P^(-1/3), meaning that P ∝ K^(-3). Therefore, the ratio of the orbital periods P2/P1 is (K1/K2)^(-3). We previously found that K2/K1 = 7/5, so K1/K2 = 5/7.
