Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_83
proposed answer: All debate agents agree that the key factor enabling the conversion from a sequential to a parallel algorithm is the 'Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation'. This is because it allows the decomposition of the matrix exponential function into smaller, independent components, which can be processed in parallel. The other options, such as nonlocal boundary conditions, stability analysis, and complex roots, do not directly facilitate task decomposition for parallelization. Therefore, the linear partial fraction approach is the most relevant factor for enabling parallel computation.
