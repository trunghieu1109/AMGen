Question: Example(question='Astronomers are studying a system of five exoplanets with circular orbits, discovered through the TTV method. The planets (designated as Planet_1 through Planet_5), which are in orbital resonance, have orbital periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Assuming these planets possess the same albedo, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2?', choice1='~0.75', choice2='~0.83', choice3='~0.69', choice4='~0.57', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_6_70
proposed answer: The calculated temperature ratio between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately 0.83, as determined in Sub-task 6. The multiple-choice options provided are: A) ~0.75, B) ~0.83, C) ~0.69, D) ~0.57. The closest matching choice to the calculated ratio of ~0.83 is option B) ~0.83. Therefore, the correct choice is B.

Answer:B
Extracted answer: B
Correct answer: 2
