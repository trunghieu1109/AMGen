Question: Example(question='You tag the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with a GFP and deliver them to mice via oral gavage. By in vivo imaging, you observe that some of the fluorescence was destroyed by the stomach acid, and some were entangled in the intestinal mucus before they reached the secondary lymphoid organs. You identify the fluorescent Peyer patches and isolate the proliferating cell population. You sequence their variable heavy chain gene and observe high variability. Which process is taking place?', choice1='somatic hypermutation', choice2='complement activation', choice3='class switching recombination', choice4='VDJ recombination', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_5_87
proposed answer: The observed high variability in the variable heavy chain gene sequences from proliferating cells in Peyer patches is indicative of somatic hypermutation. This process occurs in mature B cells after antigen exposure and involves the introduction of point mutations in the variable regions of antibody genes, leading to increased diversity and affinity for specific antigens. This matches the context of the experiment, where the fluorescent Peyer patches and proliferating cell populations were isolated, suggesting that these B cells have been activated and are undergoing affinity maturation. VDJ recombination occurs earlier during B cell development to establish initial diversity, not the high variability observed in mature B cells post-exposure. Complement activation and class switching recombination do not involve changes in the variable region sequences of antibodies. Therefore, the correct immunological process taking place is somatic hypermutation.
