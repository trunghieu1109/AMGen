proposed answer: The compound in question is a di-substituted aromatic ring with a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond, likely a halogenated acetophenone. In such compounds, the aromatic protons typically appear in the 7-8 ppm range due to the deshielding effects of the aromatic ring and the carbonyl group. The acetyl group's methyl protons usually appear as a singlet around 2-3 ppm. Upon comparing the given options, choice2 has aromatic protons at 7.8 and 7.6 ppm as doublets, which is consistent with the expected pattern for para substitution. The singlet at 3.7 ppm is likely for the acetyl methyl group. Other choices do not match this pattern: Choice 1 has an unexpected singlet at 6.9 ppm and doublets at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm, which are not typical for aromatic protons. Choice 3 lacks the aromatic proton signals entirely. Choice 4 has a singlet at 2.3 ppm, which is too far upfield for the acetyl group. Therefore, choice 2 best matches the expected 1H NMR data for the compound.

proposed answer: The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with 8 carbon atoms, a carbonyl group, and an aromatic-halogen bond. The FTIR spectrum indicates a carbonyl group, suggesting an aldehyde or ketone. The 1H NMR data should reflect these features. Choice 2 has a singlet at 9.9 ppm, characteristic of an aldehyde proton, and doublets at 7.8 ppm and 7.6 ppm, typical for aromatic protons in a para-disubstituted benzene ring. The singlet at 3.7 ppm could correspond to a methylene group adjacent to the carbonyl. This matches the expected structure and spectral data, confirming choice 2 is correct. Other choices lack the aldehyde peak or have incorrect splitting patterns for the aromatic protons, making them inconsistent with the structural and spectral constraints.
