Question: Example(question='Which of the following symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT?\n\n1. Lorentz Symmetry\n2. Poincare symmetry\n3. CP symmetry\n4. CPT symmetry', choice1='1,3,4', choice2='3,4', choice3='1,2', choice4='1,2,4', correct_index=4)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_49_65
proposed answer: All agents agree that the symmetries that must be respected by all SMEFT operators are Poincare symmetry (which includes Lorentz symmetry) and CPT symmetry. CP symmetry is not a requirement as it can be violated. Therefore, the correct choice is the one that includes Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, and CPT symmetry. Choice 4 (1,2,4) includes these symmetries: 1 (Lorentz symmetry), 2 (Poincare symmetry), and 4 (CPT symmetry). This aligns with the requirement that all SMEFT operators must respect these symmetries.
