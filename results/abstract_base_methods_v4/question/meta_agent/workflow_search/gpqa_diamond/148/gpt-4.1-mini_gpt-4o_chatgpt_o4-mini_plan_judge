Question: Example(question='You are analyzing a small peptidic compound that has been chemically synthesized. The 1H NMR spectrum of the crude compound appears consistent with the expected molecule, with the exception of two peaks that both correspond to the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar chemical shifts and roughly equal integrals (together they integrate to 1H - the expected integral); based on the coupling pattern, you can rule out spin-spin coupling as an explanation for the duplicate peaks. LC-MS analysis of the crude compound at elevated temperature shows two clearly defined peaks of equal intensities. Both peaks have the same mass spectrum, which is consistent with the expected molecule. What is the most likely explanation for these observations?', choice1='The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers', choice2='The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers', choice3="'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction", choice4='The compound is contaminated with a precursor', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_148
proposed answer: The NMR and LC-MS data indicate the presence of two forms of the compound with the same molecular weight but different chemical environments for the alpha-proton. Enantiomers would not show distinct peaks in NMR or LC-MS under standard conditions, as they have identical physical properties except for optical activity. Diastereoisomers, however, can have different chemical environments, leading to the observed differences in NMR and LC-MS. The equal intensities of the peaks in both the NMR and LC-MS suggest an equal mixture of two forms, which aligns with the presence of diastereoisomers. Reaction side-products or contamination would likely result in different mass spectra or unequal intensities, which is not the case here. Therefore, the most plausible explanation is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers.
