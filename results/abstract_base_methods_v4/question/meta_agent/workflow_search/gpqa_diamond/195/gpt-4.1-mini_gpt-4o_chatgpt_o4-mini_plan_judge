Question: Example(question=" Consider a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass $m$ and maximum amplitude $A$ obeying Hook's law ($F=-kx$). What is the maximum speed  $v_max$ of the mass? The speed of light is $c$.", choice1='$v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})}}$', choice2='$v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$', choice3='$v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2m})^2}}$', choice4='$v_{max}=\\sqrt{\\frac{kA^2}{m}}$', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: The derived expression for the maximum speed v_max is v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA^2)/(2mc^2))^2). This expression matches the structure of choice 2, which is v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA^2)/(2mc^2))^2). The key aspect is the term 1/(1 + (kA^2)/(2mc^2))^2, which is identical in both the derived expression and choice 2. The other choices do not align with this structure: choice 1 involves a different form with a square root of a sum, choice 3 has a different denominator, and choice 4 is a non-relativistic expression. Therefore, the correct choice that matches the derived expression is choice 2.
