Question: Example(question='ChIP-seq on a PFA-fixed sample with an antibody to the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells followed by next-generation sequencing and standard quality control, alignment and peak-calling steps produced ChIP peaks that disappeared when PFA+DSG fixation was used. Where are we most likely to find such disappearing peaks?', choice1='At active promoters and enhancers', choice2='At repeats', choice3='In the introns of large genes', choice4='At random locations in the genome', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_13
proposed answer: The disappearing ChIP-seq peaks when switching from PFA to PFA+DSG fixation are most likely found at active promoters and enhancers. This is because IKAROS, as a transcription factor, typically binds to these regulatory regions to influence gene expression. The addition of DSG to PFA fixation enhances protein-protein crosslinking, which can interfere with or mask the direct protein-DNA interactions that occur at these sites. Therefore, the peaks that represent IKAROS binding at active promoters and enhancers are likely to disappear due to the disruption or masking of these interactions by DSG. This matches choice A, 'At active promoters and enhancers', as the most likely genomic region where disappearing peaks are observed.
