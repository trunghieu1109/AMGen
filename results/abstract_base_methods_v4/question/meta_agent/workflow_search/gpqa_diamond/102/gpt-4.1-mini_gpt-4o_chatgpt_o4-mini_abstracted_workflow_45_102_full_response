The target molecule requires an acetyl group at the 1-position, a bromo group at the 3-position, and a nitro group at the 5-position. The optimal sequence should involve initial acetylation to set the acetyl group, followed by bromination and nitration to achieve the desired substitution pattern. However, all choices include unnecessary steps such as reduction, diazotization, and deamination, which do not contribute to the synthesis and can lead to unwanted side reactions. Choice 4 is the closest to the logical sequence needed, as it starts with acetylation, but it still requires modification to remove the unnecessary deamination step.

The acyl group (ethanone) is a deactivating, meta-directing group. This means that when it is present, it reduces the overall reactivity of the benzene ring towards electrophilic substitution and directs new substituents to the meta position relative to itself. The nitro group is also a strongly deactivating, meta-directing group. The bromo group, on the other hand, is a weakly deactivating group but is ortho/para-directing. Therefore, in the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, the acyl group should be introduced first to establish the 1-position, which will then direct the nitration to the 5-position (meta to the acyl group) and finally, bromination will occur at the 3-position (ortho to the acyl group and meta to the nitro group). This sequence ensures that the correct substitution pattern is achieved by taking advantage of the directing effects of each substituent.; answer: The acyl group is deactivating and meta-directing; the nitro group is strongly deactivating and meta-directing; the bromo group is weakly deactivating but ortho/para-directing.

The acyl group (ethanone) is a deactivating group and meta-directing. This means that after the acylation step, any new substituents will prefer to add to the meta position relative to the acyl group. The nitro group is also a deactivating group and meta-directing. Therefore, after nitration, the next substituent will also prefer the meta position relative to the nitro group. The bromo group, on the other hand, is an ortho/para-directing group and slightly activating. However, since we are starting with benzene and want the acyl group at position 1, nitration at position 5, and bromination at position 3, the synthesis should begin with acylation to establish the 1-position. Then, nitration can occur at the meta position relative to the acyl group, which is position 5. Finally, bromination can occur at the meta position relative to the nitro group, which is position 3. This sequence takes advantage of the directing effects of the substituents to achieve the desired substitution pattern.; answer: The acyl group is deactivating and meta-directing.

The acyl group (C=O) is indeed a meta-director and deactivating because it withdraws electron density from the benzene ring through resonance and inductive effects, making the ring less reactive to electrophilic aromatic substitution. The bromo group, being a halogen, is an exception to the general rule that ortho/para-directors are activating; it is ortho/para-directing but deactivating due to its electron-withdrawing inductive effect, despite having lone pairs that can donate electron density through resonance. The nitro group (NO2) is a well-known strong electron-withdrawing group, making it a meta-director and strongly deactivating due to its resonance and inductive effects.

Choice 4 seems to be the most promising as it starts with acetylation, which is crucial for the correct positioning of the acyl group, followed by bromination and nitration, which can lead to the desired substitution pattern.

The target molecule requires an acetyl group at the 1-position, a bromo group at the 3-position, and a nitro group at the 5-position. The acetyl group is a meta-director, while the bromo group is an ortho/para-director. The nitro group is also a meta-director. \n\nChoice 1 begins with nitration, which adds a nitro group, and then reduction to an amine, which is converted to an acetanilide. This sequence does not align with the desired positions of the substituents because the initial nitro group is not placed correctly. \n\nChoice 2 starts with nitration, reduction, diazotization, and deamination, which are unnecessary steps that do not contribute to the correct substitution pattern. \n\nChoice 3 begins with bromination, which places a bromo group, followed by nitration, which places a nitro group.

However, the sequence includes unnecessary reduction and deamination steps that disrupt the desired pattern for the target molecule. \n\nUpon evaluating the sequences, none of the choices perfectly match the target molecule without modification due to unnecessary transformations like reduction and deamination, which are not required for the synthesis of the target molecule.

The target molecule, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, requires an acyl group at the 1-position, a bromo group at the 3-position, and a nitro group at the 5-position. The sequence should ideally start with acetylation to ensure the acyl group is placed at the correct position. Bromination and nitration should follow, with the directing effects of the acyl group favoring the placement of the bromo and nitro groups at the meta positions relative to the acyl group. The sequence should avoid unnecessary steps like deamination, which can remove key functional groups. Choice 4 starts with acetylation, which is crucial for positioning the acyl group correctly. However, the sequence includes a deamination step, which is unnecessary and detrimental to achieving the target molecule.

The target molecule, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, requires specific substituents at designated positions. For high-yield synthesis, the sequence should ideally follow the order of functional group additions that respect the directing effects of existing substituents. In aromatic chemistry, substituents can be ortho/para or meta-directing. The acetyl group is a meta-director, while the nitro group is also a meta-director. Bromination should be done after introducing groups that can direct it to the correct position. Evaluating the choices, Choice 4 starts with acetylation, which is crucial for the correct positioning of the acyl group. However, it includes unnecessary steps like reduction, diazotization, and deamination, which can lead to side reactions and do not contribute to the target structure. Choices 1, 2, and 3 involve early nitration or bromination, which can complicate subsequent steps due to potential over-substitution or incorrect positioning. The ideal sequence should involve acetylation, followed by nitration and bromination in the correct order, without unnecessary transformations.
