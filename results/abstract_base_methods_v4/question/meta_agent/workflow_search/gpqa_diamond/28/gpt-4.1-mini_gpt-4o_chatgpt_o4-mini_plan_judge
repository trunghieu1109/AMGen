Question: Example(question='You have an interesting drought-resistant cultivar of barley, which, unfortunately, contains an anti-nutritional compound. This compound makes it impossible to use this cultivar for food purposes. After an extensive investigation, you discover the gene responsible for the synthesis of this compound. This gene consists of five exons and four introns. You decide to use old-school approaches and produce a collection of mutants using EMS chemical mutagen. You sequence a target gene in all mutant lines and discover some changes at the beginning of its sequence in the first exon area. Which of the following mutations will most probably let you eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the cultivar?\n\nIntact gene:\n5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’\n\nMutant 1:\n5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’\nMutant 2:\n5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’\nMutant 3:\n5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’\nMutant 4:\n5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’<b>', choice1='Mutant 2', choice2='Mutant 4', choice3='Mutant 1', choice4='Mutant 3', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: All agents agree that the most likely mutation to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound is a frameshift mutation, as these are more disruptive to protein function than synonymous or missense mutations. Both Mutant 3 and Mutant 4 have frameshift mutations, but Mutant 4's frameshift occurs earlier in the sequence, which is generally more disruptive. Therefore, Mutant 4 is the most likely candidate to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. The multiple-choice answer corresponding to Mutant 4 is B).

proposed answer: All agents agree that Mutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon early in the sequence, which is a nonsense mutation. This type of mutation results in a truncated protein that is likely nonfunctional, as it cannot perform its normal function. The nonsense-mediated decay mechanism might further reduce the protein levels, enhancing the impact of this mutation. In contrast, the other mutants have either synonymous or missense mutations, which are less likely to completely disrupt the protein function. Therefore, Mutant 2 is the most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound by disrupting the protein synthesis. Mutant 2 corresponds to choice A in the multiple-choice options.
