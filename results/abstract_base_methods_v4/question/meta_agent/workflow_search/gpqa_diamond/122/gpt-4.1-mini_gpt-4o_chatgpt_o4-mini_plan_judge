Question: Example(question='A supernova occurred in our Galaxy. Part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta part and the Galaxy are inertial frames of reference. From the reference frame of the ejecta, the center of the Galaxy is moving at 60 000 km/s (sixty thousand kilometers per second) towards it.\nWhat distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?\n\n(Note: Gravity can be ignored, and rotation and revolution of the Galaxy can be ignored.)', choice1='2 880 000 km.', choice2='3 000 000 km.', choice3='3 060 000 km.', choice4='2 940 000 km.', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_1_122
proposed answer: The computed distance traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy frame is 3,061,200 km. Among the provided multiple-choice options, the closest match to this calculated distance is 3,060,000 km. This choice accounts for rounding differences in the calculations. Therefore, the correct answer choice is C).
