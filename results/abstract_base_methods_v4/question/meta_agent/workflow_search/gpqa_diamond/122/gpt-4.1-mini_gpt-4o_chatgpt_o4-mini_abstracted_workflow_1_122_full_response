From the reference frame of the ejecta, the center of the Galaxy is moving towards it at a velocity of 60,000 km/s. This means that if we consider the Galaxy's frame as stationary, the ejecta is moving towards the center of the Galaxy at 60,000 km/s. The direction is towards the Galaxy center from the perspective of the ejecta, which implies the relative motion is such that the distance between the ejecta and the Galaxy center is decreasing over time.

From the reference frame of the ejecta, the center of the Galaxy is moving towards it at a velocity of 60,000 km/s. To find the velocity of the ejecta with respect to the Galaxy frame, we need to use the relativistic velocity transformation formula. The formula for transforming velocities in special relativity is: v' = (v - u) / (1 - (vu/c^2)), where v is the velocity of the Galaxy center relative to the ejecta, u is the velocity of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy, and c is the speed of light. Here, v = -60,000 km/s (since the Galaxy center is moving towards the ejecta), and we want to find u. Solving for u, we get u = v / (1 + (v^2/c^2)). Since v = -60,000 km/s and c = 300,000 km/s, we find u = -60,000 km/s / (1 + (60,000^2/300,000^2)). This simplifies to u ≈ -60,000 km/s, since the relativistic correction is very small at this speed. Therefore, the relative velocity of the ejecta with respect to the Galaxy frame is approximately -60,000 km/s, meaning the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy center at 60,000 km/s. The limitation of this calculation is that it assumes the velocities involved are much less than the speed of light, which is true in this case since 60,000 km/s is only 0.2c. Therefore, the relativistic correction is very small, and the result is approximately the same as the classical result.; answer - The relative velocity of the ejecta with respect to the Galaxy frame is approximately -60,000 km/s.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - To calculate the time interval elapsed in the Galaxy frame corresponding to 50 seconds elapsed in the ejecta frame, we use the time dilation formula from special relativity: t = t' / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2). Here, t' is the proper time interval in the ejecta frame, v is the relative velocity between the two frames, and c is the speed of light. We have t' = 50 seconds, v = 60,000 km/s, and c = 300,000 km/s. Plugging these values into the formula, we get: t = 50 / sqrt(1 - (60,000/300,000)^2). This simplifies to t = 50 / sqrt(1 - 0.2^2) = 50 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 50 / sqrt(0.96). Calculating this gives t ≈ 50 / 0.9798 ≈ 51.02 seconds. Therefore, approximately 51.02 seconds elapse in the Galaxy frame when 50 seconds elapse in the ejecta frame. The calculation is correct, and the limitation is that it assumes constant relative velocity and negligible gravitational effects, which is valid under the problem conditions.; answer - Approximately 51.02 seconds elapse in the Galaxy frame when 50 seconds elapse in the ejecta frame.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - To determine the distance traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy frame, we use the formula for distance: distance = velocity * time.

This means that if we were to observe the Galaxy from the ejecta's point of view, the Galaxy would appear to be approaching at this speed. The relative velocity between two inertial frames is the speed of one frame as seen from the other.
