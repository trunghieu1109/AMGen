proposed answer: The Hamiltonian operator is given by H = ε (σ · n), where σ are the Pauli matrices and n is a unit vector. The operator (σ · n) has eigenvalues of +1 and -1 because the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. Therefore, the Hamiltonian H = ε (σ · n) will have eigenvalues that are scaled by ε, resulting in +ε and -ε. Among the multiple-choice options provided, choice 1 is '+ ε, -ε', which directly matches the derived eigenvalues. The other options involve factors of ħ/2 or different values, which are not consistent with the derived result. Therefore, the correct choice is choice 1.
