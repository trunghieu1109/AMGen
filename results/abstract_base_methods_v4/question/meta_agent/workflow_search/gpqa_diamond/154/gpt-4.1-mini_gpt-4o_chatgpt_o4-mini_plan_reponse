The matrix form of the  operator $P_x$ has components in the first row as $(0, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,\\hbar/\\sqrt{2},0)$.  The matrix form of the  operator $P_y$ has components in the first row as $(0, -i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0, -i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2},0)$. Similarly, matrix form of the  operator $P_z$ has components in the first row as $(\\hbar, 0, 0)$, that in the second row as $(0, 0, 0)$ and that in the third row as $(0,0, -\\hbar)$. The basis vectors here are the eigenvectors of $P_z$. The system is found in the eigenstate of $P_x$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$. To be more specific, the explicit form of the state of the system is given by the column vector having elements $(-1/2, 1/\\sqrt{2}, -1/2)$. What is the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z $ of $P_z$",

We need to write these matrices explicitly and confirm that the basis vectors are eigenvectors of P_z. The matrix form of P_x is given as: P_x = [[0, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0], [\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}], [0, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0]]. The matrix form of P_y is given as: P_y = [[0, -i\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0], [i\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0, -i\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}], [0, i\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0]]. The matrix form of P_z is given as: P_z = [[\\hbar, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -\\hbar]]. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which means that when P_z acts on these basis vectors, it should return the same vector scaled by the eigenvalue. The eigenvectors of P_z are typically the standard basis vectors in this representation, corresponding to the eigenvalues \\hbar, 0, and -\\hbar. Therefore, the given basis vectors are indeed the eigenvectors of P_z, confirming the representation context.; answer - The operators in matrix form are: P_x = [[0, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0], [\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}], [0, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0]], P_y = [[0, -i\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0], [i\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0, -i\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}], [0, i\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0]], P_z = [[\\hbar, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -\\hbar]]. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - The given system state vector is expressed as (-1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2). This is already in the Pz eigenbasis because the problem states that the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of Pz. The matrix form of Px is given, and we need to confirm that this state vector is indeed an eigenstate of Px with eigenvalue -\u0127. We perform the matrix-vector multiplication of Px with the state vector. The matrix Px is [[0, \u0127/\u221a2, 0], [\u0127/\u221a2, 0, \u0127/\u221a2], [0, \u0127/\u221a2, 0]]. Multiplying this matrix by the vector (-1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2) gives the result (-\u0127/2, \u0127/\u221a2, -\u0127/2), which is -\u0127 times the original vector (-1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2). Therefore, the vector is indeed an eigenstate of Px with eigenvalue -\u0127.; answer - The state vector (-1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2) is expressed in the Pz eigenbasis and corresponds to the eigenstate of Px with eigenvalue -\u0127 because when Px operates on this vector, it returns the vector scaled by -\u0127.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - To calculate the expectation value \u27e8Pz\u27e9, we need to perform the matrix multiplication of the Pz operator with the given state vector, and then take the inner product with the state vector. The matrix form of Pz is given as [[\u0127, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -\u0127]]. The state vector is (-1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2). First, we multiply the Pz matrix by the state vector: Pz * (-1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2) = [\u0127 * (-1/2), 0, -\u0127 * (-1/2)] = [-\u0127/2, 0, \u0127/2]. Next, we take the inner product of the resulting vector with the original state vector: \u27e8(-1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2), (-\u0127/2, 0, \u0127/2)\u27e9 = (-1/2)*(-\u0127/2) + (1/\u221a2)*0 + (-1/2)*(\u0127/2) = \u0127/4 - \u0127/4 = 0.

The operator Pz is given by the matrix [[\u0127, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -\u0127]]. The state vector is (-1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2). First, we apply Pz to the state vector: Pz * (-1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2) = (\u0127 * -1/2, 0, -\u0127 * -1/2) = (-\u0127/2, 0, \u0127/2). Next, we apply Pz again to this resulting vector: Pz * (-\u0127/2, 0, \u0127/2) = (\u0127 * -\u0127/2, 0, -\u0127 * \u0127/2) = (-\u0127\u00b2/2, 0, -\u0127\u00b2/2). Now, we compute the inner product of the original state vector with this resulting vector: \u27e8(-1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2), (-\u0127\u00b2/2, 0, -\u0127\u00b2/2)\u27e9 = (-1/2 * -\u0127\u00b2/2) + (1/\u221a2 * 0) + (-1/2 * -\u0127\u00b2/2) = \u0127\u00b2/4 + 0 + \u0127\u00b2/4 = \u0127\u00b2/2. Therefore, the expectation value \u27e8Pz\u00b2\u27e9 is \u0127\u00b2/2.; answer - \u0127\u00b2/2\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - To determine the uncertainty \u0394Pz, we use the formula \u0394Pz = sqrt(\u27e8Pz\u00b2\u27e9 - \u27e8Pz\u27e9\u00b2). From the sub-tasks, we have calculated \u27e8Pz\u27e9 = 0 and \u27e8Pz\u00b2\u27e9 = \u0127\u00b2/2.
