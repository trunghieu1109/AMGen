Using c = 3 x 10^8 m/s, we calculate v1 and v2.; answer - The orbital velocity of Planet1 is approximately 1428.57 m/s, and the orbital velocity of Planet2 is approximately 1904.76 m/s.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - To find the orbital radii of the planets, we use the formula for circular orbits: v^2 = GM_star / r, where v is the orbital velocity, G is the gravitational constant, M_star is the mass of the star, and r is the orbital radius. We have the orbital velocities from Sub-task 1: v1 = 1428.57 m/s for Planet1 and v2 = 1904.76 m/s for Planet2. The mass of the star is given as 1.5 times the mass of the Sun, so M_star = 1.5 * M_sun, where M_sun = 1.989 x 10^30 kg. Solving for r, we have r = GM_star / v^2.

The centripetal force required to keep the planet in a circular orbit is F_centripetal = M_planet * v^2 / r, where v is the orbital velocity. Setting F_gravity = F_centripetal, we get G * M_star / r = v^2. Solving for r, we find r = G * M_star / v^2.
