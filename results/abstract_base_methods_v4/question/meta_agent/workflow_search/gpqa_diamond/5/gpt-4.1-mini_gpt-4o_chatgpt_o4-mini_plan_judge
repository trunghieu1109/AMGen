Question: Example(question='A quantum mechanical particle of mass m moves in two dimensions in the following potential, as a function of (r,θ): V (r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ)\nFind the energy spectrum.', choice1='E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)', choice2='E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))', choice3='E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))', choice4='E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: The derived energy spectrum expression from Sub-task 4 is E = (n_x + 1/2)ℏ√(2k/m) + (n_y + 1/2)ℏ√(k/m). This expression can be rewritten as E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ℏ√(k/m) by factoring out ℏ√(k/m) and recognizing that the x-direction has a frequency of √(2k/m), which effectively doubles the coefficient of n_x. The y-direction has a frequency of √(k/m), which matches the coefficient of n_y. The constant term 3/2 accounts for the zero-point energy in both dimensions. Comparing this with the multiple-choice options, option A) E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ℏ√(k/m) matches the derived expression exactly. Therefore, the correct choice is A).
