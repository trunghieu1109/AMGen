Question: Example(question='A dicarboxylic acid containing a cis-alkene was dehydrated to the corresponding anhydride. This anhydride, which has a single peak (7 ppm) in its 1H NMR spectrum and two peaks (137 ppm, 165 ppm) in its 13C spectrum, was reacted with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to yield two products (a major and a minor product). Both products have a molecular formula of C13H16O3.\n\nThe 2D NOESY NMR spectra of the major and minor products were taken. A cross-peak was present in the spectrum of the major product but absent (or very weak) in spectrum of the minor product.\n\nIn the spectrum of the major product, which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak (integrals are taken from the corresponding 1H NMR)?', choice1='A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm', choice2='A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm', choice3='A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm', choice4='A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_36_130
proposed answer: All agents agree that the NOESY cross-peak in the major product connects the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm with the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. This is consistent with the endo configuration of the major product in a Diels-Alder reaction, where these protons are in close spatial proximity. Among the given choices, option A matches this description, as it specifies a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm, indicating the correct proton resonances connected by the NOESY cross-peak. Therefore, the correct answer is choice A.

proposed answer: All agents agree that the NOESY cross-peak in the major product connects a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. This matches choice A, which describes these exact resonances. The presence of the NOESY cross-peak indicates spatial proximity between these protons, consistent with the expected structure of the major product. The other choices do not match this specific combination of integrals and chemical shifts that are connected by the NOESY cross-peak. Therefore, choice A is the correct answer.
