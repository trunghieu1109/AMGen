In an ultra-high vacuum with pressure < 10^-9 Torr, the mean free path is primarily influenced by the low pressure, as λ is inversely proportional to pressure. The temperature and volume of the compartment affect the kinetic energy and distribution of gas molecules, but the pressure is the dominant factor in determining λ1. Mike uses the formula λ = (kT)/(√2 * π * d^2 * P) to calculate λ1, where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, d is the molecular diameter, and P is the pressure. The assumptions are that the gas behaves ideally and the temperature is constant. The volume of the compartment is not directly in the formula for λ, but it affects the number of molecules present, which relates to pressure. The mean free path λ1 is thus a function of these parameters, assuming no other interactions.; answer: The mean free path λ1 is determined by the pressure, temperature, and properties of the gas molecules in the vacuum chamber. In an ultra-high vacuum with pressure < 10^-9 Torr, λ1 is calculated using the formula λ = (kT)/(√2 * π * d^2 * P), where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, d is the molecular diameter, and P is the pressure.

The formula for the mean free path is λ = (kT)/(√2 * π * d^2 * P), where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, d is the diameter of the gas molecules, and P is the pressure. In this ultra-high vacuum state with pressure < 10^-9 Torr, the pressure is extremely low, leading to a very large mean free path. Since the temperature and gas properties (such as molecular diameter) are constant, λ1 is primarily determined by the low pressure. The sample compartment volume does not directly affect the mean free path but is related to the total number of gas molecules present. The assumptions include constant temperature and molecular size, and the interpretation is that λ1 is large due to low pressure, with no significant changes from other factors since the temperature remains constant.; answer: The mean free path λ1 is determined by the formula λ = (kT)/(√2 * π * d^2 * P), where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, d is the diameter of the gas molecules, and P is the pressure.
