A chiral center typically has four different substituents. 1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate: The biphenyl system can have axial chirality if the substituents are such that they can create non-superimposable mirror images. The presence of nitro and carboxylate groups can potentially lead to chirality, but it depends on the specific arrangement. 2.

Benzophenone: This compound does not have any chiral centers or elements that can cause optical isomerism as its structure is symmetrical. 4.

Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate: The biphenyl structure may allow for axial chirality, but the presence of identical groups at the 6,6' and 2,2' positions likely precludes chirality. 2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: This compound is derived from lactic acid, which is known to be chiral due to the presence of a chiral center at the second carbon (bearing a hydroxyl, a hydrogen, a methyl group, and a carboxylate group). 3. Benzophenone: This compound lacks any chiral centers or stereochemical complexity that would lead to optical isomerism. 4. Dimethyl fumarate: Fumarate itself is not chiral and the dimethyl ester does not introduce chirality. Thus, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is the only compound that exhibits optical isomerism due to its chiral center.; answer: 2 and 3\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent wSrg, analyzing chirality, thinking: To determine if a compound exhibits optical isomerism, we need to check for the presence of chiral centers or elements of chirality. 1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate: This compound has a biphenyl structure, which can exhibit axial chirality if the substituents prevent free rotation around the bond connecting the two phenyl rings. However, with symmetric substitutions (dinitro and dicarboxylate groups), it is unlikely to be chiral. 2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: This compound, also known as methyl lactate, has a chiral center at the second carbon (the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group), making it optically active. 3. Benzophenone: This compound does not have any chiral centers or elements of chirality; it is a simple ketone with two identical phenyl groups. 4. Dimethyl fumarate: This compound is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is a trans isomer of butenedioic acid. It does not have any chiral centers and is not optically active.

Benzophenone: This compound does not show optical isomerism as it lacks chiral centers and is symmetrical. 4. Dimethyl fumarate: This compound does not show optical isomerism as it lacks chiral centers, although it can show geometric isomerism. Therefore, compounds 1 and 2 show optical isomerism.; answer: 1 and 2\n<SEPERATOR>\nCritic agent VcZs, providing feedback, thinking: The classification of optical isomerism is based on the presence of chirality in a molecule. A molecule is considered chiral if it has a non-superimposable mirror image, often due to the presence of a chiral center (a carbon atom with four different substituents) or due to axial chirality (as in certain biphenyl compounds). The limitations of this classification include the fact that not all molecules with chiral centers are optically active, as they may exist as racemic mixtures that do not rotate plane-polarized light. Additionally, some molecules may exhibit optical isomerism due to axial or planar chirality, which is not always immediately obvious without detailed structural analysis.; answer: The compounds that show optical isomerism are 1 and 2, as determined by the presence of chirality in these molecules.\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent LkHe, refining classification, thinking: Based on the analysis from Sub-task 2, we classify each compound as follows: 1.
