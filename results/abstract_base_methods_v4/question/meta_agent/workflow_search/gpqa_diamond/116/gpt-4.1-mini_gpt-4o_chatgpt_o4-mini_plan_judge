Question: Example(question="Compounds that have the same molecular formula but are different in their structural arrangement are known as isomers. Isomers have two types, constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but differ in their structures. In stereoisomers, molecules are connected in the same way, but their arrangements in space are different.\nWhich of the following organic moieties show optical isomerism?\n\n1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate\n2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n3. benzophenone\n4. dimethyl fumarate", choice1='2 and 3', choice2='1 and 2', choice3='3 and 4', choice4='1, 2 and 4', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_116
proposed answer: All agents agree that compounds 1 (dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate) and 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) exhibit optical isomerism. The multiple-choice options provided are: choice1: 2 and 3, choice2: 1 and 2, choice3: 3 and 4, choice4: 1, 2 and 4. The correct choice should include both compounds 1 and 2. Only choice2 lists '1 and 2', which matches the compounds identified as showing optical isomerism. Therefore, choice2 is the correct answer.
