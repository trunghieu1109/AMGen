Since we are given that c = 1, the speed of light in the glass medium at rest relative to the glass is 1/n. This is because the refractive index n is defined as the ratio of the speed of light in vacuum to the speed of light in the medium.; answer - 1/n\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - The velocity of the moving glass medium relative to the laboratory frame is simply the velocity v, as the glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam. Since the laboratory frame is the reference frame in which we are observing the motion, the velocity of the glass relative to this frame is just the velocity v itself.; answer - The velocity of the moving glass medium relative to the laboratory frame is v.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - To find the speed of light relative to the laboratory observer, we need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Here, u = 1/n (from sub-task 1), v = v (from sub-task 2), and c = 1. Plugging these into the formula, we get: u' = (1/n + v) / (1 + (1/n)v).

The speed of light in the glass relative to the glass is 1/n, as determined in sub-task 1. The glass itself is moving with velocity v relative to the laboratory. According to the relativistic velocity addition formula, if an object moves with velocity u relative to an observer, and the observer moves with velocity v relative to another observer, the velocity of the object relative to the second observer is given by (u + v) / (1 + u*v/c^2). Here, u = 1/n, v = v, and c = 1. Therefore, the speed of light relative to the laboratory observer is (1/n + v) / (1 + (1/n)*v) = (1 + n*v) / (n + v).; answer: (1+n*v)/(n+v)\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent BGna, apply relativistic velocity addition, thinking: To find the speed of light in the glass relative to the laboratory observer, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula. If an object moves with velocity u in a medium that itself moves with velocity v relative to an observer, the velocity of the object relative to the observer is given by (u + v) / (1 + uv/c^2). In this case, the speed of light in the glass is 1/n (from Sub-task 1), and the velocity of the glass is v (from Sub-task 2). Since c = 1, the relativistic velocity addition formula becomes (1/n + v) / (1 + (1/n)v). Simplifying, we get (1 + nv) / (n + v).; answer: (1+n*v)/(n+v)\n\n\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent oDLZ, apply relativistic velocity addition, thinking: To find the speed of light relative to the laboratory observer, we need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Here, u = 1/n (from sub-task 1), v = v (from sub-task 2), and c = 1. Plugging these into the formula, we get: u' = (1/n + v) / (1 + (1/n)v).
