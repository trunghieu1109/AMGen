Question: Example(question='A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory? Take the speed of light in vacuum c=1.', choice1='(1+n*v)/(n-v)\n\n\n', choice2='(1-n*v)/(n+v)\n\n', choice3='(1+n*v)/(n+v)\n\n', choice4='1', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_4_40
proposed answer: The expression derived from the problem is (1 + nv) / (n + v). This expression needs to be compared with the given multiple-choice options to find a match. The options are: choice1: (1+n*v)/(n-v), choice2: (1-n*v)/(n+v), choice3: (1+n*v)/(n+v), and choice4: 1. Upon comparison, the expression (1 + nv) / (n + v) exactly matches choice3: (1+n*v)/(n+v). Therefore, choice3 is the correct answer.
