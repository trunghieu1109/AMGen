A theory is considered renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. This is because terms with non-negative mass dimensions do not grow with energy, making the theory manageable at high energies. In contrast, coupling constants with negative mass dimensions lead to terms that increase with energy, causing divergences that cannot be absorbed by a finite number of counterterms, thus making the theory non-renormalizable.
