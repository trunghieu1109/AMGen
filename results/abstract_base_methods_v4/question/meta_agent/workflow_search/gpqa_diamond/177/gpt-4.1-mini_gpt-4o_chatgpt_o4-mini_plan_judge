proposed answer: All agents agree that the mass dimension of \( \kappa \) is -1 and that the theory is not renormalizable. This conclusion is based on the fact that a negative mass dimension for a coupling constant indicates non-renormalizability, as it implies the theory grows with energy and requires an infinite number of counterterms. Among the provided options, Choice 3 states that the mass dimension \( [\kappa]_{M} = -1 \) and the theory is not renormalizable, which matches the findings from the sub-tasks. Therefore, the correct answer is Choice C.
