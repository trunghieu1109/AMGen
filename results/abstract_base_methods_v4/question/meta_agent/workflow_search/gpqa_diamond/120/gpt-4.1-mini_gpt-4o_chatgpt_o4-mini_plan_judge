Question: Example(question='When saturated epoxides are reacted with organocuprates, the alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring. In the disubstituted epoxides, inversion of configuration occurs at a carbon to which Nu is added. Identify the product when (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo [4.1.0] heptane is reacted with Me2CuLi:', choice1='(1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol', choice2='(1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol ', choice3='(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol ', choice4='(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol ', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: The reaction of (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane with Me2CuLi involves a nucleophilic attack at the less hindered carbon of the epoxide, which is carbon 6. This attack results in inversion of configuration at carbon 6, changing it from S to R. The other stereocenters (1R, 3R, and 4R) remain unchanged, but the structural rearrangement into a cyclohexanol derivative results in a new numbering: 1R, 4R, and 5R. This matches the stereochemistry of choice 2: (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol. All agents agree on this analysis, confirming that choice 2 is the correct product.

proposed answer: The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. When it reacts with Me2CuLi, the methyl group is introduced at the less hindered carbon of the epoxide, which is C6. The nucleophilic attack causes inversion of configuration at C6, which becomes C5 in the product. The original configuration at C6 is S, and after inversion, it becomes R. The other stereocenters remain unchanged. This leads to the product being (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol. Comparing this with the given choices, choice 3, (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol, is the correct match. The justification is consistent with the reaction mechanism, where the nucleophilic attack occurs at the less hindered carbon, causing inversion of configuration. All debate agents agree on this analysis, confirming choice 3 as the correct answer.
