Question: Example(question='Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known. The bright-red substance A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 (ɷF=31,96%) and fluorine. A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. A3 can also interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y with fluorine. By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained. In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances. Indicate the range in which the molecular weight of the substance A4 falls.', choice1='220-240', choice2='140-160', choice3='160-180', choice4='110-130', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: The problem involves determining the molecular weight range of a compound A4, which is related to a series of binary fluorine compounds with an element Y, identified as calcium (Ca). From the sub-tasks, A2 is identified as CaF2, suggesting that A4 is a fluoride compound involving calcium. The molecular weight of CaF2 is 78.08 g/mol, but the problem suggests A4 is a solution or complex form, which could have a higher molecular weight. Considering the options and the possibility of complex formation or additional components in solution, the most plausible range for A4 is 110-130, as it could involve a complex or hydrated form of calcium fluoride that fits within this range. This aligns with the typical chemistry of calcium fluorides and the behavior described in the problem.

proposed answer: All agents have calculated the molecular weight of A4, which is deduced to be XeF6, as approximately 245.29 g/mol. This value does not exactly match any of the given multiple-choice options. However, the closest range provided is 220-240. Despite the slight discrepancy, this range is the most reasonable choice given the options, as it is the closest to the calculated molecular weight. The discrepancy could be due to rounding or approximation in atomic weights. Therefore, the final decision is to select the range 220-240.
