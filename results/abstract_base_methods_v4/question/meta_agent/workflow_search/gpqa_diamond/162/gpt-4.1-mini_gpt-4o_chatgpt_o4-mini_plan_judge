Question: Example(question='We would like to dissolve (at 25°С) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm3 total volume. What is the minimum volume (cm3) of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution and what is the pH of the resulting solution?', choice1='pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3', choice2='pH 2.69; 30.09 cm3', choice3='pH 3.16; 32.14 cm3', choice4='pH 4.94; 20.40 cm3', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_47_162
proposed answer: All agents agree that the calculated minimum volume of 0.1 M monobasic strong acid needed is 28.05 cm3, and the pH of the resulting solution is 4.94. When comparing these values with the multiple-choice options, none of the options match both the calculated volume and pH exactly. However, the pH of 4.94 is considered a more critical factor in determining the solution's state. Choice D is the only option that matches the calculated pH of 4.94, even though the volume does not match. Given the importance of pH in the context of the problem, Choice D is the most appropriate selection.
