When treated with sodium hydride (NaH), the hydroxyl group is deprotonated to form an alkoxide ion. This alkoxide is a good nucleophile, which can then react with benzyl bromide (a primary alkyl halide) in an SN2 reaction. This reaction would result in the formation of a benzyl ether, where the alkoxide attacks the benzyl bromide, displacing the bromide ion and forming a new C-O bond with the benzyl group. This results in the structure where the hydroxymethyl group at the 3-position is now a benzyloxymethyl group.
