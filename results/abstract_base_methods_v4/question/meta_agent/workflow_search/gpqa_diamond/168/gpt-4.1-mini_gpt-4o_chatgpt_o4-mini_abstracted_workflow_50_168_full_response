The key point here is that the energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous with an endpoint value Q. This is characteristic of beta decay processes where neutrinos are involved. The continuous spectrum arises because the energy is shared between the emitted particles, and the neutrinos can take away varying amounts of energy, leading to a continuous distribution for the E particles.

This changes the decay reaction from 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V to 2A -> 2B + 2E + M. In the original decay, the continuous energy spectrum of the E particles was due to the distribution of energy among the two E particles and the two neutrinos. The presence of neutrinos, which can take away varying amounts of energy, results in a continuous energy spectrum for the E particles. However, in the variant decay, the single massless particle M replaces the two neutrinos. Since M is massless and exotic, it will likely carry away a fixed amount of energy, or at least not have the same continuous energy distribution as the neutrinos. This would lead to a change in the energy distribution of the E particles. The spectrum of the E particles could become discrete because the energy is now shared among fewer particles (2E and M), and there is less variability in how the energy is distributed.

The decay process changes from 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V to 2A -> 2B + 2E + M. The key difference here is the replacement of the neutrinos with a single massless particle. In the original process, the energy spectrum of the E particles is continuous because the neutrinos share the energy with the E particles in various ways. With the replacement by a single massless particle M, the energy distribution of the E particles will change. Since M is massless and likely does not take away as much energy variability as two neutrinos would, the energy spectrum of E is expected to become discrete. This is because the energy conservation now involves fewer particles sharing the available energy, leading to specific energy values for the E particles. Additionally, the endpoint of the energy spectrum may increase because the single massless particle M might take away less energy overall compared to two neutrinos, allowing the E particles to reach higher maximum energies.; answer: In the variant decay process, the reaction is 2A -> 2B + 2E + M, where M is a single exotic, massless particle replacing the two neutrinos V.

Here, the two neutrinos V are replaced by a single exotic, massless particle M. In the original decay, the continuous energy spectrum of the E particles was due to the energy being shared between the E particles and the neutrinos, with the neutrinos carrying away varying amounts of energy. In the variant decay, there is only one massless particle M instead of two neutrinos, which means there is less freedom in how the energy can be distributed among the emitted particles. This typically results in a discrete energy spectrum for the E particles, as the energy distribution is more constrained. The endpoint energy for the E particles might increase because there is less 'missing' energy carried away by the massless particle compared to two neutrinos.
