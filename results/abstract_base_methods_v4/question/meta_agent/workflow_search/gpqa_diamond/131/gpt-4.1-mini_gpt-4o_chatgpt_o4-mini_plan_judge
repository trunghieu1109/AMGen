Question: Example(question='The 1H NMR spectrum of a solution containing a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14 exhibits two signals (two singlets) at around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. There are also three signals at around 2.2 ppm (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio. Which two compounds are present in the mixture from the following options: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, and 1,4-diethylbenzene.', choice1='1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene', choice2='1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene', choice3='1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene', choice4='1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene', correct_index=4)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_131
proposed answer: Based on the analysis in Sub-task 7, the pair of compounds that match the observed NMR data are 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. This pair produces the correct pattern of singlets in both the aromatic and aliphatic regions of the NMR spectrum. The aromatic region shows two singlets in a 1:1 ratio, which corresponds to the two distinct sets of equivalent aromatic protons from these compounds. The aliphatic region shows three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio, which can be explained by the different methyl environments in these compounds. Therefore, the correct multiple-choice answer that corresponds to this pair is choice A.

proposed answer: The NMR data shows two aromatic signals at 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio, indicating two different aromatic environments. The three signals at 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio suggest the presence of methyl groups in different environments. 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene has two aromatic protons in a 1:1 ratio and two types of methyl groups (2:2), while 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene has two aromatic protons in a 1:1 ratio and three types of methyl groups (2:1:1). This matches the observed NMR pattern, confirming these two compounds are present.
