We have 0.2 moles of OH- ions, and the standard enthalpy change for the neutralization reaction (formation of water) is -57.3 kJ/mol. Therefore, the total enthalpy change is 0.2 moles * -57.3 kJ/mol = -11.46 kJ. To convert kJ to kcal, we use the conversion factor 1 kJ = 0.239005736 kcal. Thus, -11.46 kJ * 0.239005736 kcal/kJ = -2.737 kcal, which rounds to -2.74 kcal.
