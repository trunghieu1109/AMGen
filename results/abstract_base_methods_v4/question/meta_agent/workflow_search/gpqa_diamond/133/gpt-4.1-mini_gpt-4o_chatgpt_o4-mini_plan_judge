Question: Example(question='Calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H2SO4 and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)2 are mixed.', choice1='-2.72 kcal', choice2='-3.80 kcal', choice3='-11.42 kcal', choice4='-16.0 kJ', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_133
proposed answer: The calculated enthalpy of neutralization is -2.74 kcal, which is closest to the given choice of -2.72 kcal (choice A). The other options, -3.80 kcal, -11.42 kcal, and -16.0 kJ, are not as close to the calculated value. Therefore, the correct answer is choice A.
