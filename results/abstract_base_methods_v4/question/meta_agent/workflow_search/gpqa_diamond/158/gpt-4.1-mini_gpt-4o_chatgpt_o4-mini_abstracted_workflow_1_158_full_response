Let's assume the rest-frame wavelength is around 400 nm, which is typical for optical/near-infrared emissions. The observed wavelength is 790 nm. The redshift z is given by the formula: z = (observed wavelength / rest-frame wavelength) - 1. Substituting the values, z = (790 nm / 400 nm) - 1 = 1.975.

Common emission lines in quasars include the Lyman-alpha line at 121.6 nm, the H-alpha line at 656.3 nm, and other Balmer lines. However, for a broad continuum peak, we might consider the peak of the optical spectrum, which could be around 400 nm. In the previous sub-task, it was assumed that the rest-frame wavelength was around 400 nm, which is reasonable for a peak in the optical region of the spectrum.
