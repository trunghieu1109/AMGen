Question: Example(question="You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control’s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control’s resistance; 0% ‒ all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?\n", choice1='G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3', choice2='G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1', choice3='G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1', choice4='G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: The analysis from the sub-tasks indicates that G2 is likely a transcription factor because the g2 mutant shows 0% resistance, suggesting its crucial role in the resistance pathway. The double mutants g1g2 and g2g3 also show 0% resistance, supporting G2's role as a key upstream regulator. Sub-task 4 concluded that G1 and G3 show gene redundancy with partial compensation, as the g1g3 double mutant has significantly lower resistance than either single mutant. Among the provided choices, Choice 1 and Choice 4 both identify G2 as a transcription factor and describe G1 and G3 as having some form of redundancy or pleiotropy. However, Choice 4 also describes G1 as epistatic towards G3, which aligns with the observation that G1 has a higher single mutant resistance (75%) compared to G3 (50%), and the double mutant g1g3 shows a significant drop to 10%. Thus, the interactions described in Choice 4 are most consistent with the findings from Sub-tasks 3 and 4. Therefore, the final decision is that G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.

proposed answer: In the experiment, G2 is identified as the transcription factor because its knockout results in a complete loss of resistance, and double mutants involving G2 do not further reduce resistance beyond the g2 single mutant level. This indicates that G2 acts upstream of G1 and G3. The interaction between G1 and G3 is characterized as synthetic enhancement, as the g1g3 double mutant shows a drastic reduction in resistance compared to either single mutant. Among the multiple-choice options, choice 4 correctly identifies G2 as the transcription factor. Although it mentions pleiotropy, which is not the correct term for the interaction between G1 and G3, it is the closest option because it acknowledges G2's role as a transcription factor. Therefore, choice 4 is the best fit despite the slight mismatch in terminology regarding pleiotropy.
