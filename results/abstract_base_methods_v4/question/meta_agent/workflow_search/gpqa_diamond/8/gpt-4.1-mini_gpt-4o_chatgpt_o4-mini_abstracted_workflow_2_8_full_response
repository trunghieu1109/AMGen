For quinuclidine, the structure is a bicyclic amine that does not possess a C3 rotational axis due to its non-planar, asymmetric nature.

Quinuclidine: Quinuclidine is a bicyclic amine that typically has a chair-like conformation. It does not possess a C3 rotational axis because its structure does not allow for a threefold rotational symmetry. The nitrogen atom in the ring and the overall asymmetry of the bicyclic structure prevent it from having C3h symmetry. It may have some lower symmetry elements like a C2 axis or mirror planes, but not C3h.\n\n2. Triisopropyl borate: This molecule is a borate ester, and its structure consists of a boron atom bonded to three isopropyl groups. While it may have some rotational symmetry due to the arrangement of the isopropyl groups around the boron, it does not have a horizontal mirror plane combined with a C3 axis, which is required for C3h symmetry. \n\n3.

As previously discussed, quinuclidine, triisopropyl borate, and the two complex polycyclic molecules do not have a C3 rotational axis based on their typical structural features. Without a C3 axis, these molecules cannot have C3h symmetry, which requires both a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane perpendicular to it.

In the previous analyses, none of the molecules were found to have a C3 rotational axis based on typical structural considerations. Without a C3 axis, the concept of a horizontal mirror plane (σ_h) perpendicular to it does not apply, as C3h symmetry requires both a C3 axis and a σ_h plane.
