The initial volume of acetic acid is 20.00 cm³, which is 0.02000 L, and the molarity is 0.05 M. Therefore, the initial moles of acetic acid = 0.05 M × 0.02000 L = 0.001 moles.; answer - 0.001 moles\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - After dilution, the total volume of the solution is the sum of the initial volume of acetic acid and the volume of water added. The initial volume of acetic acid is 20.00 cm³ and the volume of water added is also 20.00 cm³, making the total volume 40.00 cm³ or 0.04000 L. The initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001 moles, as calculated previously. The concentration of acetic acid after dilution is given by the formula: concentration = moles / volume. Thus, the new concentration of acetic acid = 0.001 moles / 0.04000 L = 0.025 M.; answer - 0.025 M\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - To find the moles of NaOH required to reach the equivalence point, we need to determine the moles of acetic acid present in the solution after dilution. We previously calculated that the concentration of acetic acid after dilution is 0.025 M, and the total volume of the solution is 0.04000 L. Therefore, the moles of acetic acid present are: moles = concentration * volume = 0.025 M * 0.04000 L = 0.001 moles. At the equivalence point, the moles of NaOH added will equal the moles of acetic acid initially present, which is 0.001 moles.; answer - 0.001 moles\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - To calculate the volume of 0.1 M NaOH needed to reach 25% titration, we first determine the moles of NaOH required for 25% of the equivalence point. We know that the moles of NaOH required to reach the equivalence point is 0.001 moles. Therefore, 25% of this amount is 0.001 moles * 0.25 = 0.00025 moles. Since the concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, we use the formula: moles = concentration * volume. Rearranging for volume gives us volume = moles / concentration = 0.00025 moles / 0.1 M = 0.0025 L. Converting to cm3, we have 0.0025 L * 1000 cm3/L = 2.5 cm3.; answer - 2.5 cm3\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - At 25% titration, 25% of the initial acetic acid has been converted to acetate ion. Initially, there are 0.001 moles of acetic acid. At 25% titration, 0.00025 moles of acetic acid have reacted to form 0.00025 moles of acetate ion. The remaining acetic acid is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. The total volume of the solution is the initial 40.00 cm³ plus the 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added, which is 42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 L. The concentration of acetic acid is 0.00075 moles / 0.0425 L = 0.01765 M, and the concentration of acetate ion is 0.00025 moles / 0.0425 L = 0.00588 M. Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]), where pKa = -log(1.85x10^-5) = 4.73. Therefore, pH = 4.73 + log(0.00588/0.01765) = 4.73 + log(0.333) = 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253. Rounding to two decimal places, the pH is approximately 4.26.; answer - 4.26\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 6 output: thinking - The pH at the equivalence point is determined by the hydrolysis of the acetate ion, which is the conjugate base of acetic acid. At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been converted to acetate ions. The concentration of acetate ions is calculated by dividing the initial moles of acetic acid by the total volume of the solution at equivalence. The initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001 moles, and the total volume at equivalence is 50.00 cm³ or 0.05000 L. Therefore, the concentration of acetate ions is 0.02 M. The Kb for acetate ion is calculated using the relation Kb = Kw/Ka, where Kw is the ion product of water (1.0 x 10^-14) and Ka is the acid dissociation constant of acetic acid (1.85 x 10^-5). This gives Kb = 5.41 x 10^-10. The hydrolysis equilibrium expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH-] / [CH3COO-]. Let x be the concentration of OH- produced, then Kb = x^2 / 0.02. Solving for x gives x = sqrt(5.41 x 10^-10 * 0.02) = 1.04 x 10^-5 M. The pOH is -log(1.04 x 10^-5) = 4.98. The pH is 14 - pOH = 9.02.

The concentration of acetate ions is equal to the initial moles of acetic acid divided by the total volume of the solution. The total volume is 40.00 cm³ (initial acetic acid solution) + volume of NaOH added to reach equivalence point. Since 0.001 moles of NaOH are added, and the concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume of NaOH added is 0.001 moles / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³. Therefore, the total volume at equivalence is 50.00 cm³ = 0.05000 L. The concentration of acetate ions is 0.001 moles / 0.05000 L = 0.02 M.
