The formula is derived from the partial wave expansion of the scattering amplitude. For elastic scattering, the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude is given by Im f(0) = (1/k) * Σ_l=0^∞ (2l+1) * sin²(δ_l), where k is the wave number and δ_l are the phase shifts for each partial wave.
