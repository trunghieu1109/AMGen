The electric/magnetic duality symmetry is a theoretical concept that suggests a symmetry between electric and magnetic fields, where electric charges and currents have magnetic counterparts. In such a symmetric theory, the equations for electric and magnetic fields would be more symmetrical, and the presence of magnetic monopoles would naturally fit into this symmetry, modifying both Gauss's law for magnetism and the Amp\u00e8re-Maxwell law.; answer - The assumption of the non-existence of magnetic monopoles is mathematically represented in Gauss's law for magnetism, \u2207\u00b7B = 0, which would change to \u2207\u00b7B = \u03c1_m if monopoles existed.
