Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent Yqrz', content="To verify the correctness of the selected answer, we need to consider how Maxwell's equations are modified in the presence of magnetic monopoles. In standard electromagnetism, Gauss's law for magnetism states that the divergence of the magnetic field B is zero, ∇·B = 0, because there are no magnetic monopoles. However, if magnetic monopoles exist, this equation is modified to ∇·B = ρ_m, where ρ_m is the magnetic charge density. This directly affects the divergence of the magnetic field. Additionally, Faraday's law, which is originally ∇×E = -∂B/∂t, is also modified in the presence of magnetic monopoles to include a magnetic current density term, becoming ∇×E = -∂B/∂t - J_m, where J_m is the magnetic current density. This affects the curl of the electric field. Therefore, the modifications due to magnetic monopoles involve changes to both the divergence of the magnetic field and the curl of the electric field.

Faraday's law, ∇×E = -∂B/∂t, does not directly assume the non-existence of magnetic monopoles, but the presence of magnetic monopoles would introduce a duality symmetry between electric and magnetic fields, leading to a modified set of equations where magnetic charges and currents play roles analogous to electric charges and currents.
