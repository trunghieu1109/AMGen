Question: Example(question='1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. How many possible organic products are there in this reaction?', choice1='4', choice2='3', choice3='1', choice4='2', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_5_140
proposed answer: The final decision from the sub-task analysis indicates that there are 2 distinct organic products formed in the reaction. The multiple-choice options provided are: '4', '3', '1', and '2'. The correct number of products, 2, matches with choice '2', which corresponds to option D). Therefore, the correct answer choice is D).

Answer:D)
Extracted answer: D)
Correct answer: 2
