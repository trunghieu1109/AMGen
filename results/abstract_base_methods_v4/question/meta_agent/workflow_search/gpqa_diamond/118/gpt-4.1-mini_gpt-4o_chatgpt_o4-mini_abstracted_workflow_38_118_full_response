When treated with TsOH, an acid, the methylene group can undergo protonation, leading to the formation of a carbocation. This carbocation may facilitate rearrangements or cyclizations. Given the structural complexity and strain in the cyclobuta and cyclopenta rings, the carbocation might rearrange to relieve strain or form a more stable structure. A likely outcome is the formation of a more stable polycyclic structure, potentially involving cyclization or rearrangement to form a new ring system.

When treated with TsOH, an acid-catalyzed dehydration reaction is likely to occur. The presence of TsOH can lead to the formation of a carbocation at the methylene position. This carbocation can undergo rearrangement, potentially involving the migration of a hydride or an alkyl group, to form a more stable carbocation. Subsequently, a cyclization reaction may occur, leading to the formation of a new ring structure.
