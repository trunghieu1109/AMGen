The correct approach is to use the exponential decay law, where the probability of decay within a length L is given by P = 1 - exp(-L/L_mean). We want P to be at least 0.30, so we set up the equation 0.30 = 1 - exp(-L_min/L_mean). Solving for L_min gives exp(-L_min/L_mean) = 0.70, thus L_min = -L_mean * ln(0.70). Given L_mean = 1.884 x 10^-6 m from Sub-task 4, we calculate L_min = -1.884 x 10^-6 m * ln(0.70). The calculations by agents z7dL, vX9s, and MOts are consistent with this approach, yielding values around 5.68 x 10^-7 m to 5.69 x 10^-7 m. Agent Ml5Y\'s calculation of 2.08 x 10^-6 m is incorrect because it uses ln(0.30) instead of ln(0.70).
