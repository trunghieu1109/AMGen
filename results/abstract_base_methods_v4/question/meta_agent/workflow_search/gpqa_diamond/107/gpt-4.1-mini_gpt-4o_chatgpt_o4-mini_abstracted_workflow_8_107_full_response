The paramagnetic term is given by ⟨H⟩ = μ_B * B * m, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton (approximately 9.274 x 10^-24 J/T), B is the magnetic field strength (1 T), and m is the orbital magnetic quantum number. For small m, let's consider m = 1 for estimation. Thus, ⟨H⟩ ≈ 9.274 x 10^-24 J/T * 1 T * 1 = 9.274 x 10^-24 J. Comparing this with the transition energy ΔE = 4.09 x 10^-19 J calculated in sub-task 1, we see that ⟨H⟩ is much smaller than ΔE.
