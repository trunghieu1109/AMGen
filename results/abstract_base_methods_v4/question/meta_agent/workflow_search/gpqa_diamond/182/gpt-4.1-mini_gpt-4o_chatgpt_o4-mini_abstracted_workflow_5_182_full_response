To calculate the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD), we compare it to the saturated formula for a hydrocarbon with 9 carbons, which is C9H20. The actual formula, C9H18, has 2 fewer hydrogens than the saturated version, indicating one degree of unsaturation. This degree of unsaturation corresponds to the presence of the cyclohexane ring.

Red phosphorus and HI can convert alcohols, aldehydes, and carboxylic acids into alkanes by reducing the functional groups. In this reaction, the aldehyde group and carboxylic acid group in 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid are likely reduced to alkanes.

Red phosphorus acts as a catalyst, while HI serves as the reducing agent. In this reaction, HI can reduce both the aldehyde and carboxylic acid groups to primary alcohols or further to alkanes, and it can also add across the double bonds in the cyclohexene ring and the vinyl group, converting them to saturated hydrocarbons. Thus, the role of red phosphorus and HI is to fully saturate the compound by reducing all unsaturations and functional groups to alkanes.; answer: Red phosphorus and excess HI serve to reduce the aldehyde and carboxylic acid groups to alkanes and saturate the double bonds in both the cyclohexene ring and the vinyl group, resulting in a fully saturated hydrocarbon.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent 4Mgw, analyzing reagents, thinking: Red phosphorus and HI are commonly used together in organic chemistry as a reducing agent.
