Question: Example(question='What is the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product obtained when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess of HI?', choice1='1', choice2='3', choice3='0', choice4='5', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_5_182
proposed answer: All agents agree that the molecular formula of the predicted product is C9H18. The saturated formula for a hydrocarbon with 9 carbon atoms is C9H20. The actual formula has 2 fewer hydrogens, indicating 1 degree of unsaturation. This corresponds to an IHD of 1. The correct multiple-choice option for an IHD of 1 is '1', which matches choice A). Therefore, the final decision is that the index of hydrogen deficiency is 1, and the correct choice is A).

Answer:A)
Extracted answer: A)
Correct answer: 1
