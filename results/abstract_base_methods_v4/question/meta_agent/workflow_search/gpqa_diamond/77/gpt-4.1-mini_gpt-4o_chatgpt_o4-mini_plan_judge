Question: Example(question='Imagine a point charge q is moving with a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$, where t is time, with respect to the origin. Let $\\vec{r}$ be the field point, where the field is observed, with respect to the origin of the same reference frame, and  $\\vec{d}$ be the vector from the point where the electromagnetic field was generated at some earlier time $tr$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$. The velocity of the moving charge q at the field generating instant $tr$ is $\\vec{v}$. What are the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (\\vec{A}) at time t, satisfying $t > tr$, and position $\\vec{r}$?

proposed answer: The Li√©nard-Wiechert potentials describe the electromagnetic potentials due to a moving point charge, taking into account the finite speed of light and the motion of the charge. The scalar potential V and vector potential \( \vec{A} \) are given by expressions that involve the retarded time, ensuring causality. The correct expressions for these potentials are: \( V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{qc}{4\pi\epsilon_o (d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \) and \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_o qc \vec{v}}{4\pi (d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \). These expressions correctly account for the retardation effects by including the term \( (d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}) \) in the denominator, which reflects the influence of the charge's motion and the finite speed of electromagnetic interactions. Among the given choices, choice 2 matches these expressions exactly, as it includes the correct denominator structure and accounts for the retardation effects. Therefore, choice 2 is the correct answer.
