Question: Example(question='An equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 g was heated to 200°C without air. In this case, only a mixture of gases was formed, which, without cooling, was passed successively through tubes filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 (№1), Ca(OH)2 (№2) solution, and red-hot copper (№3). Results: the weights of tubes №1 and №3 increased by 3.60 g and 0.80 g, respectively (CuO formed in tube №3). The weight of the second tube has not changed. As a result, only 2.24 liters of gas C (standard temperature and pressure) remained.\nIndicate the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.', choice1='15', choice2='13', choice3='17', choice4='19', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_8_63
proposed answer: The analysis determined that the total number of atoms in salts A and B is 17. This was based on the decomposition of NH4Cl and HCOONH4, which together have 17 atoms. The multiple-choice options provided are 15, 13, 17, and 19. The calculated total of 17 matches option 17. Therefore, the correct answer choice is the one that corresponds to 17.
