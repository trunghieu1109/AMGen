proposed answer: The major isomer of product 3 is determined by the Diels-Alder reaction between product 2 and cyclopentadiene. This reaction is stereospecific and typically favors the endo product due to favorable secondary orbital interactions. The stereochemistry of the original bicyclic framework in product 2 is preserved in product 3. All agents agree that choice 1's stereochemistry aligns with the expected endo orientation and preserves the stereochemistry from product 2. The SMILES string of choice 1 correctly reflects these stereochemical outcomes, indicating that choice 1 is the major isomer formed under the reaction conditions.
