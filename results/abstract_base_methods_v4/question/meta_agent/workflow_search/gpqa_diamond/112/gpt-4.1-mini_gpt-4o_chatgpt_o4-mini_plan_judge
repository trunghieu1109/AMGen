Question: Example(question='You have prepared an unknown compound. To identify the product, you have used the following characterisation techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers. Two other strong absorption peaks are observed at 1700 and 1650 wavenumbers. Several peaks were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum including peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens. The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45. Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O2.', choice1='C6H10O2', choice2='C6H12O', choice3='C6H10O', choice4='C6H12O2', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: All agents analyzed the spectral data and concluded that the FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of an O-H group (broad peak at 3000 wavenumbers), a C=O group (strong peak at 1700 wavenumbers), and a C=C group (peak at 1650 wavenumbers). This suggests the compound is a carboxylic acid with an alkene. The 1H NMR spectrum confirms the presence of vinyl hydrogens, supporting the C=C bond. The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45, consistent with a CH3CO fragment, indicating a carbonyl group. Among the given choices, C6H10O2 is the only formula that can accommodate a carboxylic acid (O-H and C=O) and an alkene (C=C), matching all the spectral data. C6H12O and C6H10O do not have enough oxygen atoms to account for both the O-H and C=O groups, and C6H12O2 suggests an alcohol or ester, which doesn't fit as well with the strong C=C indication. Therefore, the most consistent formula with all the spectral data is C6H10O2.
