Question: Example(question='Consider the following metric:\n\nds^{2}=\\frac{32}{\\left(4-x^{2}-y^{2}\\right)}\\left(dx^{2}+dy^{2}\\right)\n\nWhat is the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2?\n\nPS: for the maths use a LaTeX editor.', choice1='+\\infty', choice2='4\\pi\\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\\right)', choice3='0', choice4='4\\pi\\left(x^{2}-y^{2}\\right)', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_5_161
proposed answer: The computed area of the pseudosphere was found to be infinite, as the integral diverges to infinity. This matches with choice 1, which is '+\infty'. Therefore, the correct multiple-choice option that corresponds to the computed result is choice A.
