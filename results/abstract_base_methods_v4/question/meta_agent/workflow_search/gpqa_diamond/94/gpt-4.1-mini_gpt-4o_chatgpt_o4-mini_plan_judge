Question: Example(question='3,3,6-trimethylhepta-1,5-dien-4-one is treated with 1 equivalent of meta-chloroperbenzoic acid. Two different products are formed, in approximately a 1:1 ratio.\n\nIn a separate vessel, Methyllithium is treated with copper(I)iodide. an excess of the resulting solution is slowly added to the product mixture of the first reaction. Name one product that will be formed by this reaction:', choice1='4,4,5,7,7-pentamethyloctane-3,5-diol', choice2='2,3,4,5,5-pentamethylhept-6-ene-2,4-diol', choice3='5-hydroxy-3,3,6,6-tetramethylhept-1-en-4-one', choice4='6-hydroxy-2,2,5,5-tetramethyloctan-4-one', correct_index=4)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_9_94
proposed answer: The analysis from the sub-tasks indicates that the reaction sequence involves the formation of epoxides from 3,3,6-trimethylhepta-1,5-dien-4-one using mCPBA, followed by the treatment with a Gilman reagent, which opens the epoxide rings. The nucleophilic attack by the Gilman reagent occurs at the less hindered carbon, resulting in the formation of an alcohol and the addition of a methyl group. The predicted product from this reaction is 6-hydroxy-2,2,5,5-tetramethyloctan-4-one, which corresponds to choice 4. This choice matches the structural features and naming conventions expected from the reaction mechanism, as it describes a compound with a hydroxyl group at position 6 and methyl groups at positions 2 and 5, consistent with the expected outcome of the reaction sequence.
