        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The given density matrix is \\( \\rho = \\frac{1}{2} (|0\\rangle \\langle 0| + |1\\rangle \\langle 1|) \\). This is a mixed state because it is a statistical mixture of the states \\(|0\\rangle\\) and \\(|1\\rangle\\) with equal probabilities of 1/2 each. In the computational basis, this density matrix can be written as a 2x2 matrix: \\( \\rho = \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\). This is the matrix representation of the maximally mixed state, which is the identity matrix scaled by 1/2. The Bloch vector representation of this state is \\( \\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0) \\), which corresponds to the center of the Bloch sphere.; answer - The density matrix \\( \\rho = \\frac{1}{2} (|0\\rangle \\langle 0| + |1\\rangle \\langle 1|) \\) is a mixed state represented by the matrix \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\), which is the identity matrix scaled by 1/2.

For the given density matrix \\( \\rho = \\frac{1}{2}( |0\\rangle \\langle 0| + |1\\rangle \\langle 1| ) \\), it can be written as \\( \\rho = \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\), which is the identity matrix divided by 2. This corresponds to the Bloch vector \\( \\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0) \\), meaning the qubit is at the center of the Bloch sphere. This is because the identity matrix does not have any components in the directions of the Pauli matrices, indicating no polarization in any direction.; answer - The Bloch sphere representation of a single-qubit density matrix is given by \\( \\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\mathbf{r} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}) \\), where \\( \\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z) \\) is the Bloch vector.

The Bloch vector components are calculated using the expectation values of the Pauli matrices: \\( r_x = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_x) \\), \\( r_y = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_y) \\), and \\( r_z = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_z) \\).

Calculating the traces: \\( r_x = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}) = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}) = 0 \\), \\( r_y = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}) = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}) = 0 \\), \\( r_z = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}) = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}) = 0 \\).
