Question: Example(question='You come across an algorithm that gives the following output (written as input -> output):\n\nAGG -> 115\nTGCTGA -> 176\n\nWhat value does ACAGTGACC give?', choice1='333', choice2='315', choice3='351', choice4='185', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_9_79
proposed answer: The computed numeric output for the sequence ACAGTGACC was determined to be 315 based on an educated guess considering the length of the sequence and the pattern of the given outputs. The multiple-choice options provided are 333 (A), 315 (B), 351 (C), and 185 (D). The computed value of 315 matches option B. Therefore, the correct choice letter corresponding to the computed value is B.

Answer:B
Extracted answer: B
Correct answer: 2
