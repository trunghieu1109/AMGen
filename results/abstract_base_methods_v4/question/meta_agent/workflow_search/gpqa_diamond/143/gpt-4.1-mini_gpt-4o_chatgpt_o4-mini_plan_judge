Question: Example(question='X is a meson resonance. What is the mean decay distance? Knowing that the production energy is $E_{X}=8GeV$, the mass $m_{X}=1.2GeV$, and the width $\\Gamma_{X}=320MeV$.', choice1='5.0223 * 10^-16 m', choice2='4.0655 * 10^-16 m', choice3='4.0655 * 10^-15 m', choice4='5.0223 * 10^-15 m', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_4_143
proposed answer: All agents have calculated the mean decay distance L to be 4.0655 * 10^-15 m. This value matches exactly with choice 3 in the provided multiple-choice options. Each agent independently verified that the calculated value corresponds to choice 3, confirming the accuracy of the calculation and the correctness of the choice. Therefore, the consensus among the agents is that choice 3 is the correct answer.
