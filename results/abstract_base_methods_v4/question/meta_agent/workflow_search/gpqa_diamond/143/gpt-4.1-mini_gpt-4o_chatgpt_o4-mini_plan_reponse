        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The relativistic gamma factor (\u03b3) is calculated using the formula \u03b3 = E_X / m_X, where E_X is the production energy and m_X is the mass of the meson. Given E_X = 8 GeV and m_X = 1.2 GeV, we can calculate \u03b3 as follows: \u03b3 = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.6667. This is the factor by which time dilation and length contraction affect the meson due to its relativistic speed.; answer - 6.6667\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - The mean lifetime (\u03c4) of the meson resonance X can be calculated using the relation \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393_X, where \u0127 is the reduced Planck constant and \u0393_X is the width of the meson. We are given \u0393_X = 320 MeV, which we need to convert to GeV by noting that 1 MeV = 0.001 GeV, so \u0393_X = 0.320 GeV. The reduced Planck constant is given as \u0127 = 6.582119569e-25 GeV\u00b7s. Thus, the mean lifetime is \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393_X = 6.582119569e-25 GeV\u00b7s / 0.320 GeV = 2.0569123653125e-24 s. This calculation uses the provided values and conversion factors to ensure accuracy.; answer - 2.0569123653125e-24 s\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - To calculate the mean decay distance (L) of the meson resonance X, we use the formula L = \u03b3 * \u03b2 * c * \u03c4. From Sub-task 1, we have \u03b3 = 6.6667. From Sub-task 2, the mean lifetime \u03c4 is 2.0569123653125e-24 s. The speed of light c is 3.0e8 m/s. First, we calculate \u03b2 using the formula \u03b2 = sqrt(1 - 1/\u03b3^2). Substituting \u03b3 = 6.6667, we get \u03b2 = sqrt(1 - 1/(6.6667)^2) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887. Now, we can calculate L: L = \u03b3 * \u03b2 * c * \u03c4 = 6.6667 * 0.9887 * 3.0e8 m/s * 2.0569123653125e-24 s. Calculating this gives L \u2248 4.0655 * 10^-15 m. This matches choice 3 in the original question, confirming the calculation is correct.; answer - 4.0655 * 10^-15 m\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - All agents have calculated the mean decay distance L to be 4.0655 * 10^-15 m. This value matches exactly with choice 3 in the provided multiple-choice options. Each agent independently verified that the calculated value corresponds to choice 3, confirming the accuracy of the calculation and the correctness of the choice.
