proposed answer: The problem provides multiple-choice options for the transition routes and their probabilities. The calculated transition probabilities are: |3,0,0> -> |2,1,0> -> |1,0,0> with probability 1/3, |3,0,0> -> |2,1,1> -> |1,0,0> with probability 1/4, and |3,0,0> -> |2,1,-1> -> |1,0,0> with probability 1/4. Comparing these with the given choices: Choice 1 matches the route |3,0,0> -> |2,1,1> -> |1,0,0> with probability 1/4. Choice 2 matches the route |3,0,0> -> |2,1,0> -> |1,0,0> with probability 1/3. Choice 3 matches the route |3,0,0> -> |2,1,-1> -> |1,0,0> with probability 1/4. Choice 4 does not match any calculated probability as it suggests a probability of 2/3, which is not consistent with the calculated results. Therefore, the correct option based on the calculated probabilities is Choice 2, which matches the transition route |3,0,0> -> |2,1,0> -> |1,0,0> with probability 1/3.
