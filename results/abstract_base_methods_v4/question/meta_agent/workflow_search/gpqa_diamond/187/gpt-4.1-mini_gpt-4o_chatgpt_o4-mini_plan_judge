Question: Example(question='Consider a rhombohedral crystal, with the interatomic distance of 10 Angstrom and the angles $\\quad\\alpha=\\beta=\\gamma=30^{0}$. What is the interplanar distance of the (111) plane of the crystal?\n', choice1='9.54 Angstrom', choice2='8.95 Angstrom', choice3='9.08 Angstrom', choice4='10.05 Angstrom', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_29_187
proposed answer: The calculated interplanar distance for the (111) plane of the rhombohedral crystal is approximately 8.95 Angstroms. When comparing this calculated value with the provided multiple-choice options, we find that option B) 8.95 Angstrom is an exact match. Therefore, the closest matching value from the options is 8.95 Angstrom, which confirms the correctness of the calculation and the choice.
