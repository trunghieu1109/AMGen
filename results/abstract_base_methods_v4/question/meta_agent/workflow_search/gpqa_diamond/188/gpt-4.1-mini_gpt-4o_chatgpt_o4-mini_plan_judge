proposed answer: All agents agree that magnons and pions are associated with spontaneously-broken symmetries. Magnons are linked to the spontaneous breaking of rotational symmetry in ferromagnets, and pions are associated with the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Skyrmions, while they can be related to spontaneously-broken symmetries in specific contexts, are primarily topological solitons. Phonons, on the other hand, represent lattice vibrations and are not directly linked to spontaneously-broken symmetries. They are more related to the collective excitations in the lattice structure rather than a result of symmetry breaking. Therefore, phonons are the effective particles not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry.

Answer:Phonon
Extracted answer: Phonon
Correct answer: 2

proposed answer: Based on the analysis, magnons, pions, and phonons are all associated with spontaneously-broken continuous symmetries. Magnons are associated with broken rotational symmetry in spin systems, pions with chiral symmetry breaking in quantum chromodynamics (QCD), and phonons with translational symmetry breaking in crystals. Skyrmions, on the other hand, are topological solitons characterized by their topological charge and are not directly tied to spontaneously-broken continuous symmetries. Therefore, skyrmions are not associated with spontaneously-broken symmetries, unlike the other particles.

Answer:Skyrmion
Extracted answer: Skyrmion
Correct answer: 2
