Question: Example(question='Two stars are being studied. It has been observed that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2. In fact, the energy difference between the considered energy levels was determined to be approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J.

proposed answer: In Sub-task 5, the derived expression for ln(2) was found to be ln(2) = ΔE/k * [(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)]. This expression matches choice 4, which is ln(2) = [(T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]. The other choices do not match this form. Choice 1 is ln(2) = [T_2 / T_1], which is not the same. Choice 2 is ln(2) = [(T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2], which has an extra square in the denominator. Choice 3 is ln(2) = [(T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)], which has a plus sign instead of a minus sign in the numerator. Therefore, the correct choice is choice 4.

proposed answer: To validate the selected answer, we need to ensure that the equation ln(2) = [(T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)] is dimensionally consistent and physically meaningful. The problem involves the excitation of iron atoms, which is related to the Boltzmann distribution. The energy difference ΔE = 1.38 x 10^(-23) J is given, and the Boltzmann constant k is approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K. The ratio of the populations of two energy levels in thermal equilibrium is given by the Boltzmann factor, which is proportional to exp(-ΔE/kT). The fact that the excitation is twice as high in star_1 compared to star_2 suggests a relationship involving the temperatures T_1 and T_2. The derived expression ln(2) = ΔE / k * (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) is consistent with the form of choice 4, ln(2) = [(T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)], when considering the proportionality and the fact that ΔE/k is a constant factor that cancels out in the comparison. Substituting typical values for ΔE and k confirms that the expression is dimensionally consistent, as both sides of the equation are dimensionless. Therefore, the selected answer D) is physically plausible and dimensionally consistent.
