Question: Example(question='A synchrocyclotron is a special type of cyclotron. A proton is injected at \\$t=0\\$ with negligible kinetic energy, i.e. \\$T\\simeq0\\$ undergoes two accelerations in the accelerator to reach the kinetic energy \\$T{1}=950MeV\\$. The alternating voltage applied in the accelerator is given by\nU\\left(t\\right)=U{0}\\cos\\left[2\\pi\\nu\\left(\\alpha\\right)t+\\Phi_{0}\\right].\n\nHow many revolutions does the proton make in the synchrocyclotron?\nData : \\$\\Phi{0}=\\frac{\\pi}{4},U{0}=190kV\\$. ', choice1='1864', choice2='2500', choice3='3536', choice4='5300', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_31_136
proposed answer: The calculated number of revolutions from Sub-task 4 is approximately 3536. The multiple-choice options provided are 1864, 2500, 3536, and 5300. Comparing these options with the calculated result, 3536 is an exact match with one of the options. Therefore, the closest matching answer is option C) 3536.
