Here, f = 0.2, T_spot = 5000K, and T_star = 6000K. Plugging in these values, we get: T_eff_spotted = (0.2 * 5000^4 + 0.8 * 6000^4)^(1/4). Calculating each term: 5000^4 = 6.25 * 10^14 and 6000^4 = 1.296 * 10^15. So, 0.2 * 5000^4 = 1.25 * 10^14 and 0.8 * 6000^4 = 1.0368 * 10^15. Adding these gives: 1.25 * 10^14 + 1.0368 * 10^15 = 1.1618 * 10^15. Taking the fourth root: (1.1618 * 10^15)^(1/4) ≈ 5832K.

From Sub-task 1, we know the effective temperature of the spotted hemisphere is approximately 5832K. The unspotted hemisphere has the same effective temperature as the star, 6000K. The flux for the spotted hemisphere is calculated using its effective temperature: flux_spotted = (5832)^4. The flux for the unspotted hemisphere is calculated using the star's effective temperature: flux_unspotted = (6000)^4. Calculating each: (5832)^4 ≈ 1.155 * 10^15 and (6000)^4 = 1.296 * 10^15.

The flux difference is therefore: flux_unspotted - flux_spotted = 1.296 * 10^15 - 1.155 * 10^15 = 0.141 * 10^15.

We have already calculated the flux difference in Sub-task 3a as 0.141 * 10^15. The total flux from both hemispheres is the sum of the flux from the unspotted hemisphere and the spotted hemisphere, which is 1.296 * 10^15 + 1.155 * 10^15 = 2.451 * 10^15.

The flux difference was calculated as 0.141 * 10^15, and the total flux from both hemispheres was 2.451 * 10^15. The calculated amplitude was 0.0575, which is less than 1, indicating it is physically plausible. This value is consistent with the spot coverage of 20% on one hemisphere, as the spots reduce the brightness of the hemisphere, leading to a detectable amplitude in the light curve.

Thus, the final answer choice is confirmed to be ~0.32.; answer: The final answer choice is ~0.32, as it has the smallest absolute difference from the computed radius ratio.\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent DiHI, round 0, fact-check mapping and confirm final answer, thinking: The computed radius ratio from Sub-task 4a is approximately 0.24. To ensure the robustness of the final answer, we need to verify the mapping of this ratio to the closest multiple-choice option by calculating the absolute differences again. The options provided are: ~0.07, ~0.32, ~0.11, and ~0.39. Re-evaluating the absolute differences: \n\n- For ~0.07, the absolute difference is |0.24 - 0.07| = 0.17.\n- For ~0.32, the absolute difference is |0.24 - 0.32| = 0.08.\n- For ~0.11, the absolute difference is |0.24 - 0.11| = 0.13.\n- For ~0.39, the absolute difference is |0.24 - 0.39| = 0.15.\n\nThe smallest absolute difference is indeed 0.08, which corresponds to the option ~0.32. Multiple independent agents reviewing these calculations would confirm that the closest match is ~0.32, thus verifying the robustness of the final answer selection.; answer: ~0.32\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent EvNn, round 0, fact-check mapping and confirm final answer, thinking: The task involves verifying the mapping of the computed radius ratio of approximately 0.24 to the multiple-choice options, ensuring the smallest absolute difference is chosen correctly.

The computed radius ratio was approximately 0.24. We compared this value to the multiple-choice options: ~0.07, ~0.32, ~0.11, and ~0.39. The absolute differences were calculated as follows: |0.24 - 0.07| = 0.17, |0.24 - 0.32| = 0.08, |0.24 - 0.11| = 0.13, and |0.24 - 0.39| = 0.15. The smallest difference was 0.08, corresponding to the option ~0.32. Multiple independent calculations confirm that the smallest difference is indeed 0.08, thus making option ~0.32 the most accurate choice.

To determine the closest multiple-choice option, we calculate the absolute differences between 0.24 and each of the provided options: ~0.07, ~0.32, ~0.11, and ~0.39. The absolute differences are: |0.24 - 0.07| = 0.17, |0.24 - 0.32| = 0.08, |0.24 - 0.11| = 0.13, and |0.24 - 0.39| = 0.15. The smallest absolute difference is 0.08, which corresponds to the option ~0.32. This mapping was confirmed by multiple independent agents, who all calculated the same differences and reached the same conclusion. The process was consistent and robust, involving straightforward calculations and verification by multiple agents.
