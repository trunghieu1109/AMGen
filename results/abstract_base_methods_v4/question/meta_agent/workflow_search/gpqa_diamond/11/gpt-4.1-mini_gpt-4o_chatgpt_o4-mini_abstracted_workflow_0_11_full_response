Since the initial particle, Pi(+), is stationary, its initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the total momentum of the decay products (mu(+) and nu) must also sum to zero to conserve momentum. For energy conservation, the initial energy of the system is the rest mass energy of Pi(+), which is 139.6 MeV since it is at rest and has no kinetic energy.
