Question: Example(question='A vector field f(r) falls off radially as 1/r^2 from the origin, i.e. the magnitude of the field is f(r) = 1/r^2. The field has non-zero component only along  the radial direction in spherical coordinates. Evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of the field, ∇.f inside the volume of a sphere of radius R centred at the origin. Here, ∇ and f both are implied as vectors. Which answer below is the most appropriate one for the answer of the integral?', choice1='1', choice2='4 π', choice3='0', choice4='4/3 π R ', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_15_135
proposed answer: The confirmed integral value from subtask 5 is 4π. We need to match this value to the given multiple-choice options. The options provided are: '1', '4 π', '0', and '4/3 π R'. The option '4 π' directly matches the confirmed integral value of 4π. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is '4 π'.
