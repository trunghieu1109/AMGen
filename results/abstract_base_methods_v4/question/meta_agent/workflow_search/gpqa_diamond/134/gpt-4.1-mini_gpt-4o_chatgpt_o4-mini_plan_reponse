In the Standard Model, the fermions include the quarks (up, down, charm, strange, top, bottom) and the leptons (electron, muon, tau, and their corresponding neutrinos).

Therefore, the fermions that could potentially couple to X are the charged leptons (e, \\mu, \\tau) and the quarks (u, d, c, s, t, b).; answer - The fermions that could potentially couple to the bosonic field X are the charged leptons (electron, muon, tau) and the quarks (up, down, charm, strange, top, bottom).\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - To determine the kinematically allowed decays of the boson X, we need to compare the mass of X (6 GeV) with the masses of the fermions it can decay into.

The boson X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs if the sum of their masses is less than the mass of X. Therefore, X can decay into u, d, s, c, b quarks and e, \u03bc, \u03c4 leptons, but not into t quarks since the top quark is too heavy.; answer - The masses of the standard model fermions relevant for the decay analysis are: up quark (u) ~ 2.2 MeV, down quark (d) ~ 4.7 MeV, strange quark (s) ~ 96 MeV, charm quark (c) ~ 1.27 GeV, bottom quark (b) ~ 4.18 GeV, top quark (t) ~ 173 GeV, electron (e) ~ 0.511 MeV, muon (\u03bc) ~ 105.7 MeV, and tau (\u03c4) ~ 1.777 GeV.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - To determine the kinematic threshold for the boson X decaying into a fermion-antifermion pair, we need to check if the mass of the boson X (6 GeV) is greater than twice the mass of each fermion.

For each fermion, we calculate twice the mass and compare it to 6 GeV. For u, d, s, c, b quarks and e, \u03bc, \u03c4 leptons, twice their masses are much less than 6 GeV (e.g., 2 * 1.27 GeV = 2.54 GeV for charm quark, 2 * 4.18 GeV = 8.36 GeV for bottom quark). The boson X can decay into these fermions since 6 GeV > 2 * their mass. However, for the top quark, 2 * 173 GeV = 346 GeV, which is greater than 6 GeV, so X cannot decay into top quarks.; answer - The boson X (6 GeV) can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs of u, d, s, c, b quarks and e, \u03bc, \u03c4 leptons, but not t quarks, since 6 GeV > 2 * their mass for all except the top quark.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - From sub-task 1, we identified that the bosonic field X can couple to the charged leptons (electron, muon, tau) and the quarks (up, down, charm, strange, top, bottom).
