proposed answer: The kinematically allowed decays of the boson X at the lowest order, as determined in sub-task 4, are into the fermion-antifermion pairs: u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, s\bar{s}, c\bar{c}, b\bar{b}, e^{+}e^{-}, μ^{+}μ^{-}, τ^{+}τ^{-}. We need to compare this list with the provided multiple-choice options. Choice 1 does not include b\bar{b}, which is kinematically allowed. Choice 2 includes all the allowed pairs. Choice 3 incorrectly includes t\bar{t}, which is not kinematically allowed. Choice 4 is missing μ^{+}μ^{-}. Therefore, the correct choice is Choice 2, as it includes all the kinematically allowed decays and no additional ones that are not allowed.

proposed answer: The task is to determine which multiple-choice option correctly lists the kinematically allowed decay channels for the boson X, given its mass of 6 GeV. The decay channels must satisfy the condition that the boson mass is greater than twice the mass of the fermions involved. The finalized list of allowed decays is: X → c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ⁺ τ⁻, μ⁺ μ⁻, e⁺ e⁻. We compare this list with each choice: 

Choice 1: X → c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ⁺ τ⁻, μ⁺ μ⁻, e⁺ e⁻. This matches the allowed list exactly and includes no forbidden decays.

Choice 2: X → b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ⁺ τ⁻, μ⁺ μ⁻, e⁺ e⁻. This includes b b̄, which is forbidden as the mass of the boson X is not greater than twice the mass of the bottom quark.

Choice 3: X → c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, t t̄, τ⁺ τ⁻, μ⁺ μ⁻, e⁺ e⁻. This includes t t̄, which is forbidden as the mass of the boson X is not greater than twice the mass of the top quark.

Choice 4: X → b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ⁺ τ⁻, e⁺ e⁻. This includes b b̄, which is forbidden.

Therefore, the only choice that includes all allowed decays and excludes forbidden ones is Choice 1.
