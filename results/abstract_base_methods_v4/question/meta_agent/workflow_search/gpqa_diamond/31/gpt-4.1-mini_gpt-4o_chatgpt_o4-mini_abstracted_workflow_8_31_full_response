The atomic number (Z) of Lithium is 3, as it has 3 protons. The atomic mass number (A) is the total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus. Since it has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, the atomic mass number A is 3 + 3 = 6. Therefore, the nucleus X is Lithium-6, with an atomic number Z = 3 and atomic mass number A = 6.; answer - The atomic mass number (A) is 6 and the atomic number (Z) is 3 for the nucleus X, Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - The rest mass energy of a nucleus can be calculated using its atomic mass and the conversion factor from atomic mass units (amu) to energy. The atomic mass of Lithium-6 is approximately 6.015 amu. The conversion factor is 1 amu = 931.5 MeV/c^2. Therefore, the rest mass energy E0 = 6.015 amu * 931.5 MeV/amu = 5603.5725 MeV.

Given that the speed v is 0.96c, we substitute this into the formula: gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2). This simplifies to gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1 / sqrt(0.0784). Calculating this gives gamma = 1 / 0.28 = 3.5714. Therefore, the Lorentz factor for the nucleus X moving at 0.96c is approximately 3.5714.; answer - 3.5714\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - The total relativistic energy (E) of a particle is calculated by multiplying its rest mass energy (E0) by the Lorentz factor (gamma).

This value is very close to the provided choice of 20.132 GeV, which suggests that the calculation is accurate given the precision required and possible rounding in the choices.

The atomic mass number A for Lithium-6 is 6. The atomic mass unit (amu) is approximately 931.5 MeV/c^2. Therefore, the rest mass energy E0 can be calculated as A * 931.5 MeV/c^2. For Lithium-6, this is 6 * 931.5 MeV/c^2 = 5589 MeV/c^2. Converting this to GeV, we divide by 1000, resulting in 5.589 GeV/c^2.

The atomic mass unit (u) is a standard unit of mass that quantifies mass on an atomic or molecular scale. It is approximately equal to 1/12 of the mass of an unbound neutral atom of carbon-12 in its nuclear and electronic ground state, and it is equal to 931.5 MeV/c^2 in energy units. For Lithium-6, the atomic mass is approximately 6 atomic mass units (u). Therefore, the rest mass energy E0 is calculated as follows: E0 = (mass in atomic mass units) * (energy equivalent of 1 atomic mass unit in MeV) = 6 u * 931.5 MeV/u = 5589 MeV. Converting this to GeV (since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV), we have E0 = 5.589 GeV.
