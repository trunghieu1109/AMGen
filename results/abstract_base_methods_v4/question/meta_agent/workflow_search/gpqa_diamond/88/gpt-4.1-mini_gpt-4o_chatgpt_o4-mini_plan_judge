Question: Example(question='1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated to 240C with an excess of KOH, creating a light yellow solid product 1, With 1H nmr spectrum: 4.79(2H), 2.41-2.23(10H), 1.94(2H) and a characteristic absorbance in the IR spectrum at 1720cm-1.\n\nThis product was then heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide, forming product 2.\n\nozone was bubbled through a solution of 2 at -78C, followed by addition of dimethylsulfide, forming product 3.\n\nin the 1H nmr spectrum of 3, what is the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom (excluding those that will exchange with deuterated solvent)?', choice1='doublet of triplets', choice2='triplet of triplets', choice3='pentet', choice4='triplet', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_88
proposed answer: The most deshielded hydrogen atom in the 1H NMR spectrum of product 3, identified as 1-adamantanone, is likely adjacent to the carbonyl group. The adamantane structure is symmetrical, and the hydrogens near the carbonyl group are coupled with multiple neighboring hydrogens. This results in a complex splitting pattern. The 'triplet of triplets' pattern is plausible because these hydrogens are coupled with two sets of equivalent neighboring hydrogens, each causing a triplet splitting. This matches the choice 'triplet of triplets', which corresponds to choice B).
