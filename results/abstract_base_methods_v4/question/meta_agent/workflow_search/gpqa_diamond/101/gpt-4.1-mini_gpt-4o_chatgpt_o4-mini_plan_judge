Question: Example(question="You identified a new ligand-receptor pair initially expressed in the neural crest cells and want to understand the developmental fate of their interaction. The receptor is a monomeric transmembrane barrel with eight alpha helices, four extracellular helices, and three beta sheets that create a binding site for the ligand. The ligand is a coiled-coil of two alpha helices. You create a bicistronic lox-Cre vector with the ligand ORF at the 5' position, fused to mCherry; the receptor ORF is at the 3' and fused to the eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and upstream of the receptor is the IRES regulatory element. Between the ligand ORF and mCherry, there is a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, and between the receptor and the eGFP, there is a stop in the lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. You had also raised antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and now use them to test the construct expression on the Western blot after plasmid transfection to primary astrocyte culture. Total proteins give a signal proportional to the actin loading. You finally breed a mouse model homozygous for your construct in the wt background. You cross it to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice; after the offspring is born you visualize them under the fluorescent confocal microscope. You do not observe a green signal. Which of the answers below explains the most likely reason for it?", choice1='ligand and the receptor are in a paracrine relationship', choice2='the receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame', choice3='the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing', choice4='the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: The most plausible explanation for the lack of green fluorescence signal is that the receptor and the eGFP are not in frame. This conclusion is supported by the consistent analysis across multiple agents, which identified a frame shift as the primary reason for the absence of green fluorescence. The Cre recombinase should have removed the stop cassettes, allowing for the expression of the fusion proteins. However, if the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, the fusion protein would not be translated correctly, resulting in no green fluorescence. Other potential reasons, such as missing enhancer activity or protein localization issues, are less likely because the CBA promoter is strong and ubiquitous, and protein localization issues would not inherently prevent fluorescence unless the GFP is misfolded or degraded. Paracrine signaling effects would not directly affect the fluorescence of the eGFP, which is a reporter for protein expression, not signaling interactions. Therefore, the frame shift is the most plausible explanation.

proposed answer: The evaluated hypotheses suggest that the most likely reason for the absence of green fluorescence is incomplete Cre recombination, which prevents the expression of the receptor-eGFP fusion protein. This aligns with the multiple-choice option 'the receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame' if we interpret it as a broader issue with the construct not being expressed correctly due to incomplete recombination. However, the option 'the receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame' more directly suggests a frame-shift mutation, which is less supported by the evidence if Western blot sizes are correct. The option 'the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi' is plausible if the protein is expressed but mislocalized, but this would not prevent fluorescence entirely, just alter its localization. The option 'the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing' is less likely given the use of the CBA promoter and IRES, which should drive expression. The option 'ligand and the receptor are in a paracrine relationship' does not explain the lack of fluorescence if the receptor is expressed. Therefore, the most plausible explanation based on the evidence is 'the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi', as it accounts for correct expression but mislocalization, which could prevent visible fluorescence.
