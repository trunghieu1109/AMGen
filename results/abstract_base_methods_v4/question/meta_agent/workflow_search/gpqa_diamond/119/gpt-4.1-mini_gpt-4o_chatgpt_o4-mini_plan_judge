Question: Example(question='Let us assume stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. In this scenario, how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx?', choice1='~ 1/plx^3', choice2='~ 1/plx^2', choice3='~ 1/plx^1', choice4='~ 1/plx^4', correct_index=4)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_6_119
proposed answer: All agents have consistently determined that the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to 1/plx^4. This conclusion is based on the assumption that stars are uniformly distributed in space and the relationship between parallax and distance. The derived functional form matches choice 4 in the given options, which is '~ 1/plx^4'. Therefore, the correct choice is D) ~ 1/plx^4, as it aligns with the derived result from the analysis.
