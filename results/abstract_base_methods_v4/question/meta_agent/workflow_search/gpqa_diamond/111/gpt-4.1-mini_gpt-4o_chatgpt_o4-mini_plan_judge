proposed answer: The calculated probabilities from sub-task 5 are 0.54 and 0.46, and the average value from sub-task 6 is ħ/14. Comparing these with the given multiple-choice options, Choice 2 has the probabilities 0.54 and 0.46, which match exactly with the calculated probabilities. However, the average value in Choice 2 is 3*hbar/sqrt(7), which does not match the calculated average value of ħ/14. Despite this discrepancy, none of the other choices match the probabilities, and the probabilities are a more critical aspect of the problem. Therefore, Choice 2 is the closest match based on the probabilities, even though the average value does not match. This suggests that there might be an error in the calculation of the average value or in the provided choices, but given the options, Choice 2 is the most consistent with the calculated probabilities.

proposed answer: The probabilities calculated in sub-task 5 are 0.64 and 0.36, which match the probabilities given in choice4. However, the expectation value calculated in sub-task 6b was initially given as ħ/14, which does not match any of the choices. The critic agent pointed out that the correct expectation value should be hbar/sqrt(7), which matches choice3. Therefore, the correct choice should be based on both the probabilities and the expectation value. The probabilities in choice3 are 0.28 and 0.72, which do not match the calculated probabilities, but the expectation value hbar/sqrt(7) does match. Given the critic's feedback, choice3 is the correct answer because it has the correct expectation value.
