The energy difference for this transition can be calculated using the rotational energy formula: ΔErot = (h² / (8π²I)) * (J(J+1)), where I is the moment of inertia. For a diatomic molecule, I = μR², where μ is the reduced mass. μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (20 amu + 2 amu) = 1.818 amu = 1.818 * 1.66053906660 × 10^(-27) kg.

The moment of inertia I is given by I = μR², where μ is the reduced mass and R is the bond length. The reduced mass μ is calculated as μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (20 amu + 2 amu) = 1.818 amu, which is converted to kg by multiplying by 1.66053906660 × 10^(-27) kg/amu. Therefore, I = μR² = (1.818 * 1.66053906660 × 10^(-27) kg) * (2 * 10^(-10) m)². Substituting these values into the formula for ΔE gives ΔE = ħ²/I = (1.0545718 × 10^(-34) J·s)² / ((1.818 * 1.66053906660 × 10^(-27) kg) * (2 * 10^(-10) m)²).
