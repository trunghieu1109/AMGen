Question: Example(question='The reaction of an electron pair donor, nucleophile (Nu) with an electron pair acceptor is called nucleophilic substitution reaction. An sp3-hybridized electrophile needs to have a leaving group to proceed with the reaction. Substitution reactions have the following two types. One is SN1 and the other is the SN2 reaction. In contrast to the substitution reaction, the elimination reaction involves the removal of a pair or groups of atoms from a molecule. These are chemical reactions in which single carbon-carbon bonded organic compounds are converted to compounds containing double/triple bonds (unsaturated compounds).\nArrange the following nucleophiles more reactive to the poorest reactive in the aqueous solution.\n\n1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate\n2. Hydroxide\n3. Propionate\n4. Methanol\n5. Ethanethiolate', choice1='5, 2, 1, 3 and 4', choice2='2, 5, 1, 4 and 3', choice3='5, 2, 3, 1 and 4', choice4='2, 5, 3, 4 and 3', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_189
proposed answer: The ranked order of nucleophiles from most reactive to least reactive is: Ethanethiolate, Hydroxide, 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate, Propionate, Methanol. Comparing this order with the provided multiple-choice options, we find that Choice 1: '5, 2, 1, 3, and 4' matches the ranking exactly. Ethanethiolate corresponds to 5, Hydroxide to 2, 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate to 1, Propionate to 3, and Methanol to 4. Therefore, Choice 1 is the correct answer as it aligns perfectly with the ranked order determined in the analysis.
