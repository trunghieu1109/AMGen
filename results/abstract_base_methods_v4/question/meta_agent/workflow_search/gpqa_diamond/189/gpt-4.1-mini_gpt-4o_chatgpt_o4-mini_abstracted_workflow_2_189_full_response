In aqueous solution, negatively charged nucleophiles are generally more reactive than neutral ones. Among negatively charged nucleophiles, those with less electronegative atoms are typically more nucleophilic. Steric hindrance can reduce nucleophilicity, and the solvent can stabilize or destabilize the nucleophile. \n\n1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate: This is an alkoxide ion, negatively charged, and relatively bulky due to the cyclohexane ring. \n2. Hydroxide (OH-): A small, negatively charged ion with high nucleophilicity in aqueous solution. \n3.

Charge: Nucleophiles with a negative charge are generally more reactive than neutral ones because they have a higher electron density to donate. \n2. Electronegativity: Less electronegative atoms are better nucleophiles because they hold onto their electrons less tightly and can donate them more readily. \n3. Solvent effects: In polar protic solvents like water, nucleophiles are often solvated, which can hinder their reactivity. Larger, less solvated nucleophiles tend to be more reactive in such solvents. \n4. Steric hindrance: Bulky nucleophiles are less reactive because they have difficulty approaching the electrophile due to steric crowding. \nConsidering these factors, ethanethiolate (5) is highly nucleophilic due to its negative charge and sulfur atom, which is less electronegative than oxygen. Hydroxide (2) is also a strong nucleophile due to its negative charge. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (1) is a charged species but may be slightly hindered.

The cyclohexane ring introduces some steric hindrance, which can reduce nucleophilicity. It is more solvated in water than thiolates, but less hindered than larger, bulkier nucleophiles.\n\n4. Propionate (3): A carboxylate ion with resonance stabilization, it is less nucleophilic than alkoxides or thiolates.

However, its bulkiness due to the cyclohexane ring introduces steric hindrance, reducing its nucleophilicity compared to smaller ions like hydroxide.\n\n4.
