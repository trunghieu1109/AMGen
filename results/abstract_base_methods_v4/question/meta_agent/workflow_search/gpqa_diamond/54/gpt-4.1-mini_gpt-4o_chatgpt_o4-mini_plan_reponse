This is consistent with the trans-vinyl proton expected in Trans-propenyl acetate.

Trans isomers typically have larger coupling constants (around 12-18 Hz) due to the anti-periplanar orientation of the protons, whereas cis isomers have smaller coupling constants (around 6-12 Hz) due to the syn-periplanar orientation.
