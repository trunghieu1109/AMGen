Question: Example(question='You have prepared an unknown compound. To identify the product, you have used the following characterisation techniques: FTIR and 1H NMR. The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers. A strong absorption peak is also observed at 1700 wavenumbers. Several peaks were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum, none of which are correspond to vinyl-hydrogens. One of the signals in the 1H NMR is a doublet of triplets of quartets whilst a different signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Identify the compound as either, CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH, CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH, CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH, or CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH', choice1='CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH', choice2='CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH', choice3='CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH', choice4='CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_98
proposed answer: The compound identified as best matching the spectral data is CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH. According to the provided choices, this corresponds to choice A. The FTIR data indicates a carboxylic acid group, and the 1H NMR data suggests a branched alkyl chain with complex splitting patterns, which aligns with the structure of CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH. Therefore, the correct multiple-choice answer is A.

proposed answer: The compound identified from the spectral analysis is CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. This matches with choice 2 in the original question, which corresponds to option B. The FTIR spectrum indicates a carboxylic acid group with a broad O-H stretch around 3000 cm⁻¹ and a strong C=O stretch near 1700 cm⁻¹. The 1H NMR spectrum shows complex splitting patterns consistent with the presence of an ethyl group and two chiral centers with methyl groups, which aligns with the structure of CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. The absence of vinyl hydrogens further supports this identification. Therefore, the correct multiple-choice answer is B.
