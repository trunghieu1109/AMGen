Question: Example(question='Astronomers are interested in the luminosities of two stars. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2. The mass of Star_1 is also larger by the same factor (1.5 times). Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same. Astronomers also calculated the radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:', choice1='~2.25', choice2='~2.35', choice3='~2.32', choice4='~2.23\n', correct_index=4)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_1_176
proposed answer: The problem involves comparing the luminosities of two stars, where Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and both stars have the same temperature since they peak at the same wavelength. According to the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the luminosity of a star is proportional to the square of its radius when the temperature is constant. Therefore, the luminosity ratio L1/L2 is (R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. The radial velocities do not affect the intrinsic luminosity. Among the provided options, ~2.25 is the closest match to the computed luminosity ratio of 2.25. All agents agree that the correct choice is A) ~2.25.

proposed answer: The finalized luminosity ratio calculated by the agents is 2.25. The multiple-choice options provided are ~2.23, ~2.25, ~2.32, and ~2.35. The closest matching factor to the calculated luminosity ratio of 2.25 is ~2.25. Most agents agree that the correct choice is the one that matches the calculated value most closely, which is ~2.25. Therefore, the final decision on the closest matching luminosity ratio is ~2.25.
