Question: Example(question='Two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10^-9 sec and 10^-8 sec, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which one of the following options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?\n', choice1='10^-9 eV', choice2='10^-11 eV', choice3='10^-8 eV\n', choice4='10^-4 eV', correct_index=4)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_8_0
proposed answer: Based on Sub-task 4, the energy difference required to clearly resolve the two quantum states must be greater than 5.79 Ã— 10^-7 eV. Among the given options, only 10^-4 eV meets this criterion. The options correspond to: A) 10^-9 eV, B) 10^-11 eV, C) 10^-8 eV, and D) 10^-4 eV. Therefore, the correct choice is D) 10^-4 eV.

Answer:D
Extracted answer: D
Correct answer: 4
