Question: Example(question='The universe is filled with the Cosmic Microwave Background. Consider the annihilation of high energy \\gamma-rays with a photon from the CMB Radiation into electron-positron, i.e. $\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$. From what energy \\gamma-rays would have their lifetimes in the universe limited by this process? Knowing that the average photon energy of the CMB is $10^{-3}eV$.', choice1='9.5*1e4 GeV', choice2='1.8*1e5 GeV', choice3='2.6*1e5 GeV', choice4='3.9*1e5 GeV', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_37_6
proposed answer: All agents have calculated the gamma-ray energy threshold to be 2.6 * 10^5 GeV. This value matches exactly with the third multiple-choice option, which is 2.6*1e5 GeV. Therefore, the correct choice is C) 2.6*1e5 GeV, as it aligns with the calculated threshold energy required for pair production with a CMB photon.
