Question: Example(question='There is a spin 1/2 particle with magnetic moment mu (= gamma*Sz), aligned with a magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction. Suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction; both fields have the same magnitude, B. The average of the z-component of the particleâ€™s moment starts oscillating. What is its oscillation frequency?', choice1='gamma*B/2', choice2='gamma*B', choice3='gamma*B/sqrt(2)', choice4='sqrt(2)*gamma*B', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_24_67
proposed answer: The problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment initially aligned along the +Z direction. When the magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction, the Hamiltonian becomes H = -gamma * B * Sy. The spin precesses around the y-axis due to this Hamiltonian. The time evolution of the spin state causes oscillations in the expectation value of the z-component of the spin, <Sz>, and hence in <mu_z>. The frequency of these oscillations is determined by the energy splitting between the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian, which is given by the coefficient gamma * B. This is the Larmor frequency associated with the magnetic field applied in the y-direction. All agents agree that the correct oscillation frequency is gamma * B, which corresponds to choice (B).
