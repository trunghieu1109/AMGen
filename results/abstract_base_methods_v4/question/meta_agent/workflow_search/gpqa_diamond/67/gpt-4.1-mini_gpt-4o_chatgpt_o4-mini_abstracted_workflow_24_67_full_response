This means its magnetic moment is aligned along the +Z axis. When the magnetic field is turned off and a new field of the same magnitude B is applied along the +Y direction, the particle's magnetic moment will start to precess around the new magnetic field direction. This is because the magnetic moment experiences a torque due to the perpendicular alignment of the magnetic field, causing it to precess. The frequency of this precession, known as the Larmor frequency, is determined by the gyromagnetic ratio gamma and the magnitude of the magnetic field B. The formula for the Larmor frequency is omega = gamma * B.
