Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O is the disodium salt of phosphoric acid and contributes HPO4^2- ions to the solution. The dissociation equilibria for phosphoric acid are as follows: H3PO4 \u21cc H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1 = 7.5x10^-3), H2PO4^- \u21cc H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 = 6.2x10^-8), and HPO4^2- \u21cc H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3 = 1.8x10^-12).

The initial concentrations provided are [H2PO4^-] = 0.03675 M and [HPO4^2-] = 0.02810 M. The equilibrium expressions are correctly set up as: For the first equilibrium, Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-], and for the second equilibrium, Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-].

We have the initial concentrations: [H2PO4^-] = 0.03675 M and [HPO4^2-] = 0.02810 M. The relevant equilibria are: 1) H2PO4^- \u21cc H+ + HPO4^2- with Ka2 = 6.2x10^-8, and 2) HPO4^2- \u21cc H+ + PO4^3- with Ka3 = 1.8x10^-12. We assume that the concentration of H+ is small compared to the initial concentrations, allowing us to use the approximation method. For the first equilibrium, we set up the expression Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]. Solving for [H+], we find that [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4^-]/[HPO4^2-]. For the second equilibrium, we use Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-]. Substituting [H+] from the first equilibrium into the second, we solve for [PO4^3-]. After calculations, we find that the concentration of PO4^3- is approximately 2.81x10^-7 M.

The mass balance equation is [H2PO4^-] + [HPO4^2-] + [PO4^3-] = 0.03675 M + 0.0281 M, which accounts for the total concentration of phosphate species.

Given Ka3 = 1.8x10^-12, we can rearrange to find [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H^+]. Assuming [HPO4^2-] is the dominant species at this pH, we can estimate its concentration from the initial amounts of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4\u25cf2H2O, which are approximately equal.

At pH 7.2, [H+] is approximately 6.31x10^-8 M, which is small compared to the phosphate species concentrations, which are in the range of 10^-7 M. The pKa2 of phosphoric acid is 7.21, close to the pH, indicating that [HPO4^2-] and [H2PO4^-] are in equilibrium, with [HPO4^2-] slightly more prevalent. The calculation of [PO4^3-] using the equilibrium expression for the third dissociation and the given Ka3 value is consistent with these assumptions.
