Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_132
proposed answer: The calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) from sub-task 6 is 2.81x10^-7 M. We need to compare this value with the provided multiple-choice options: A) 5.48x10^-7 M, B) 6.24x10^-7 M, C) 2.81x10^-7 M, D) 3.97x10^-7 M. The calculated value matches exactly with option C) 2.81x10^-7 M. Therefore, the correct answer is option C.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_132
proposed answer: From Sub-task 6.4, the calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions is self-consistent with the assumptions made during the equilibrium calculations. The concentration of orthophosphate ions, [PO4^3-], was calculated using the equilibrium expression for the third dissociation of phosphoric acid, considering the Ka3 value and the pH of the solution. The calculated concentration should match one of the provided multiple-choice options. Based on the equilibrium calculations and the consistency check, the correct concentration of orthophosphate ions is 2.81x10^-7 M, which matches choice C).
