Question: Example(question='Compounds that have the same molecular formula but are different in their structural arrangement are known as isomers. Isomers have two types, constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but differ in their structures. In stereoisomers, molecules are connected in the same way, but their arrangements in space are different.\nAmong the given compounds (benzoquinone & cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione) the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) and among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate which one will show optical isomerism (B).', choice1='A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate', choice2='A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate', choice3='A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate', choice4='A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_20
proposed answer: All agents agree that benzoquinone does not show tautomerism and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exhibits optical isomerism. The correct choice that matches these criteria is choice3, which corresponds to A = benzoquinone and B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Therefore, the final decision is to select choice3.

Answer:choice3
Extracted answer: choice3
Correct answer: 3

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_20
proposed answer: Based on the validated results from the sub-tasks, benzoquinone is identified as the compound that does not show tautomerism (A), and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is identified as the compound that shows optical isomerism (B). Reviewing the multiple-choice options provided: Choice 1 has A = benzoquinone and B = dimethyl fumarate, Choice 2 has A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione and B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, Choice 3 has A = benzoquinone and B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, and Choice 4 has A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione and B = dimethyl fumarate. The correct choice that matches the findings is Choice 3, where A is benzoquinone and B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.
