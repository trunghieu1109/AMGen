Based on the principles of electrostatics, the electric field outside a conductor is determined by the net charge enclosed, and due to the spherical symmetry, it can be treated as if the charge were at the center of the sphere. This leads to the conclusion that the electric field at a distance L from the center of the conductor is given by E = (1/(4 pi epsilon_0)) (q/L^2). Comparing this with the given multiple-choice options: \n- Choice 1 involves a dependence on l and s, which is incorrect because the field outside depends only on L.\n- Choice 2 also involves l and s incorrectly.\n- Choice 3 suggests dependence only on l, which is incorrect as it should be L.\n- Choice 4 matches the derived expression, E = (1/(4 pi epsilon_0)) (q/L^2), which is consistent with the electrostatic principles for a point charge at the center of a spherical conductor.\nTherefore, the correct choice is D).; answer: D)\n<SEPERATOR>\nFinal Decision agent, selecting correct formula, thinking: The problem involves a spherical conductor with a cavity containing a charge +q. The conductor is uncharged overall, and the charge +q induces charges on the inner surface of the cavity. Due to the properties of conductors and electrostatic shielding, the electric field outside the conductor is determined by the net charge enclosed within the conductor. The spherical symmetry of the conductor allows us to treat the external electric field as if the charge +q were at the center of the conductor. This is because the electric field outside a conductor with a symmetric charge distribution is equivalent to that of a point charge at the center. The induced charges on the inner surface do not affect the external field, as they are balanced by induced charges on the outer surface, maintaining the conductor's neutrality. Therefore, the electric field at point P, located at a distance L from the center of the conductor, is given by the expression for the electric field due to a point charge at the center: E = (1/(4 pi epsilon_0)) (q/L^2). Comparing this with the given options, choice 4 matches this expression. Hence, the correct formula for the magnitude of the electric field at point P is option 4.; answer: D)", iteration_idx=-1)]
