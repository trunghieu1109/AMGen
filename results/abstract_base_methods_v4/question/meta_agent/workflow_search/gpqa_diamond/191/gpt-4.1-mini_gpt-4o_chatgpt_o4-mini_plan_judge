Question: Example(question='Imagine an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ having a small spherical cavity inside. The centre of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the centre of the spherical conductor. The radius of the cavity is $r$, and $r<R$. Now consider a small amount of positive charge $+q$ is somehow placed somewhere inside the cavity. What is the magnitude of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at a point P (outside the spherical conductor) of distance $L$ from the centre of the spherical conductor? Note, the distance of the point P from the centre of the cavity is $l$. Here, l, L > R. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\\theta$\n', choice1='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n', choice2='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n', choice3='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\n', choice4='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: The problem involves a spherical conductor with a cavity containing a charge +q. The conductor is uncharged overall, and the charge +q induces charges on the inner surface of the cavity. Due to the properties of conductors and electrostatic shielding, the electric field outside the conductor is determined by the net charge enclosed within the conductor. The spherical symmetry of the conductor allows us to treat the external electric field as if the charge +q were at the center of the conductor. This is because the electric field outside a conductor with a symmetric charge distribution is equivalent to that of a point charge at the center. The induced charges on the inner surface do not affect the external field, as they are balanced by induced charges on the outer surface, maintaining the conductor's neutrality. Therefore, the electric field at point P, located at a distance L from the center of the conductor, is given by the expression for the electric field due to a point charge at the center: E = (1/(4 pi epsilon_0)) (q/L^2). Comparing this with the given options, choice 4 matches this expression. Hence, the correct formula for the magnitude of the electric field at point P is option 4.
