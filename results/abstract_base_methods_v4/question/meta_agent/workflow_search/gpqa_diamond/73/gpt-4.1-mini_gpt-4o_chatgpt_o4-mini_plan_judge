Question: Example(question='We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.\nSo far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? ', choice1='52%', choice2='48%', choice3='44%', choice4='40%', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_15_73
proposed answer: The conditional probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given it has survived the first 50 minutes, was calculated as 44%. This probability was derived using the memoryless property of exponential decay, which states that the future probability of decay is independent of the past. The calculated probability of 44% matches the choice provided as '44%' in the multiple-choice options. Therefore, the correct answer is the option that matches this probability, which is choice C).
