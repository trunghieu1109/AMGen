In an exponential decay model, the probability that an atom has not decayed by time t is given by the survival function S(t) = e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant. The probability that the atom decays within time t is 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt). We are given that this probability is 32% for t = 100 minutes, so we have 1 - e^(-100λ) = 0.32. Solving for λ, we get e^(-100λ) = 0.68, so -100λ = ln(0.68), and λ = -ln(0.68) / 100.; answer - The decay constant λ is approximately 0.00384 per minute.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - Using the decay constant λ = 0.00384 per minute from Sub-task 1, we can calculate the survival probability after 50 minutes using the survival function S(t) = e^(-λt).

We want to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes given it has survived the first 50 minutes. The survival probability after 50 minutes is approximately 0.825, as calculated in Sub-task 2.
