            "We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.\nSo far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? ",

This probability was derived using the memoryless property of exponential decay, which states that the future probability of decay is independent of the past. The calculated probability of 44% matches the choice provided as '44%' in the multiple-choice options.

        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The decay probability of 32% within 100 minutes can be interpreted as the probability that the atom will decay within that time period. In an exponential decay model, the probability that an atom has not decayed by time t is given by the survival function S(t) = e^(-\u03bbt), where \u03bb is the decay constant. The probability that the atom decays within time t is 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-\u03bbt). We are given that this probability is 32% for t = 100 minutes, so we have 1 - e^(-100\u03bb) = 0.32. Solving for \u03bb, we get e^(-100\u03bb) = 0.68, so -100\u03bb = ln(0.68), and \u03bb = -ln(0.68) / 100.; answer - The decay constant \u03bb is approximately 0.00384 per minute.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - Using the decay constant \u03bb = 0.00384 per minute from Sub-task 1, we can calculate the survival probability after 50 minutes using the survival function S(t) = e^(-\u03bbt). For t = 50 minutes, S(50) = e^(-0.00384 * 50). Calculating this gives S(50) = e^(-0.192). Therefore, the probability that the atom has not decayed after 50 minutes is approximately e^(-0.192).; answer - The survival probability after 50 minutes is approximately e^(-0.192), which is about 0.825.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - The memoryless property of exponential decay implies that the probability of decay in a future time interval is independent of the past. Therefore, the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes given it has survived the first 50 minutes is the same as the probability of decay in 150 minutes from the start. Using the decay constant \u03bb = 0.00384, the survival probability after 150 minutes is S(150) = e^(-0.00384 * 150). The probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is 1 - S(150) = 1 - e^(-0.576). This calculation gives approximately 0.44 or 44%. This approach is valid under the assumption that the decay process follows an exponential distribution.; answer - 44%\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - The conditional probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given it has survived the first 50 minutes, was calculated as 44%.
