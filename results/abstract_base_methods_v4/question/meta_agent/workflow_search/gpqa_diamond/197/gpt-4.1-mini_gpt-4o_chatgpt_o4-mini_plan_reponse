Cumulative stability constants (\u03b2) represent the overall equilibrium constant for the formation of a complex from the metal ion and ligands. They are typically larger for higher numbers of ligands because they represent the product of stepwise stability constants. In this case, \u03b21 < \u03b22 < \u03b23, which is consistent with the idea that adding more ligands generally increases the stability of the complex. However, \u03b24 is smaller than \u03b23, which might seem unusual, but it can happen if the fourth ligand does not bind as strongly or if there is steric hindrance or other effects. The fact that these constants are not strictly increasing suggests they are cumulative, as stepwise constants (K) would typically decrease as more ligands are added due to decreasing availability of coordination sites and increasing steric hindrance.
