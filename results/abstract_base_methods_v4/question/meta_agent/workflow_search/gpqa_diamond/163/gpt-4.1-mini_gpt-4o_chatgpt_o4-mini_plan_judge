Question: Example(question='Astronomers are studying two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2. Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.', choice1='~ 0.4', choice2='~ 0.7', choice3='~ 0.6\n', choice4='~ 1.2', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_6_163
proposed answer: The calculated mass ratio factor is ~0.6, which matches the choice labeled as 'choice3' in the original question. Therefore, the corresponding letter choice for this option is C).

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_6_163
proposed answer: The computed mass ratio factor from Sub-task 4d is 0.864. We need to compare this value with the given multiple-choice options: ~0.4, ~0.7, ~0.6, and ~1.2. The value 0.864 is closest to 0.7 among the options provided. Although 0.864 is not exactly 0.7, it is the nearest option compared to the others. The other options, 0.4, 0.6, and 1.2, are either significantly lower or higher than 0.864. Therefore, the closest match to the computed mass ratio factor is ~0.7.
