        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The initial NN bound state is given as 1S0. In the term symbol (2S+1)L(J), 1S0 indicates the following: The '1' in front of 'S' indicates that 2S+1 = 1, which means S = 0. The 'S' indicates that the orbital angular momentum L = 0 (since S corresponds to L = 0 in spectroscopic notation). The '0' after 'S' indicates that the total angular momentum J = 0. For nucleons, the isospin T is typically 1 for a neutron-proton pair in a singlet state, but since the problem states T(NN) = 0 for the final state, we assume the initial state also has T = 0 for consistency with the problem's context.; answer - The initial NN bound state 1S0 has total spin S = 0, orbital angular momentum L = 0, total angular momentum J = 0, and isospin T = 0.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - The Pauli statistics constraint given is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2). This means that the isospin T(NN) of the final NN state must be congruent to the sum of the spin S(NN) and the orbital angular momentum L(NN), plus 1, modulo 2. Since the problem states that the final isospin T(NN) = 0, we have 0 = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2). This implies that S(NN) + L(NN) must be congruent to -1 modulo 2, which is the same as saying S(NN) + L(NN) is odd. Therefore, for the final NN state, the sum of the spin and orbital angular momentum must be an odd number.; answer - The Pauli statistics constraint for the final NN state is that the sum of the spin S(NN) and the orbital angular momentum L(NN) must be odd, given that the final isospin T(NN) = 0.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - The emitted particle X has intrinsic parity -1. The lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X, which is the orbital angular momentum of X. The parity of a state is given by (-1)^(L) for orbital angular momentum L, and the intrinsic parity of the particle. Therefore, the parity of the emitted particle X in a state with angular momentum l is (-1)^(l+1). This affects the parity conservation in the reaction.; answer - The intrinsic parity of the emitted particle X is -1, and its angular momentum notation is given by the lowercase letter (e.g., s, p, f) which denotes the orbital angular momentum state of X.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - For each final NN partial wave choice, we need to extract the quantum numbers S, L, J, and the angular momentum state of the emitted particle X. We are given that T(NN) = 0 for the final state. The choices are given in the format like '3P0 + s', where '3P0' is the term symbol for the NN state and 's' is the angular momentum state of the emitted particle X. \n\n1) For '3P0 + s': \n- The term symbol '3P0' indicates (2S+1)L(J) = 3P0, so S = 1, L = 1 (P corresponds to L = 1), and J = 0. The lowercase 's' indicates that the emitted particle X has orbital angular momentum l = 0.\n\n2) For '7D1 + p':\n- The term symbol '7D1' indicates (2S+1)L(J) = 7D1, so S = 3, L = 2 (D corresponds to L = 2), and J = 1. The lowercase 'p' indicates that the emitted particle X has orbital angular momentum l = 1.\n\n3) For '3D3 + f':\n- The term symbol '3D3' indicates (2S+1)L(J) = 3D3, so S = 1, L = 2 (D corresponds to L = 2), and J = 3. The lowercase 'f' indicates that the emitted particle X has orbital angular momentum l = 3.\n\n4) For '3S1 + p':\n- The term symbol '3S1' indicates (2S+1)L(J) = 3S1, so S = 1, L = 0 (S corresponds to L = 0), and J = 1. The lowercase 'p' indicates that the emitted particle X has orbital angular momentum l = 1.\n\nWe also need to check the Pauli statistics constraint, which requires S + L to be odd for T = 0. \n- For '3P0', S + L = 1 + 1 = 2 (even), so it does not satisfy the constraint.\n- For '7D1', S + L = 3 + 2 = 5 (odd), so it satisfies the constraint.\n- For '3D3', S + L = 1 + 2 = 3 (odd), so it satisfies the constraint.\n- For '3S1', S + L = 1 + 0 = 1 (odd), so it satisfies the constraint.; answer - For '3P0 + s', S = 1, L = 1, J = 0, T = 0, l = 0 (does not satisfy Pauli constraint); For '7D1 + p', S = 3, L = 2, J = 1, T = 0, l = 1; For '3D3 + f', S = 1, L = 2, J = 3, T = 0, l = 3; For '3S1 + p', S = 1, L = 0, J = 1, T = 0, l = 1.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - The Pauli statistics constraint requires that for T(NN) = 0, the sum S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 must be even. This is because the constraint is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2), and for T(NN) = 0, we need S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 to be even. We apply this to each final NN state:\n\n1) For '3P0 + s': S = 1, L = 1, so S + L + 1 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3, which is odd. This does not satisfy the constraint.\n\n2) For '7D1 + p': S = 3, L = 2, so S + L + 1 = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6, which is even. This satisfies the constraint.\n\n3) For '3D3 + f': S = 1, L = 2, so S + L + 1 = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4, which is even. This satisfies the constraint.\n\n4) For '3S1 + p': S = 1, L = 0, so S + L + 1 = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2, which is even. This satisfies the constraint.\n\nTherefore, the only final NN state that does not satisfy the Pauli statistics constraint is '3P0 + s'.; answer - '3P0 + s' does not satisfy the Pauli statistics constraint for T(NN) = 0.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 6 output: thinking - The initial state is 1S0, which means the total angular momentum J_initial = 0. For each final state, we need to check if the total angular momentum is conserved by ensuring J_initial = J_final + l, where J_final is the total angular momentum of the final NN state and l is the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle X. The correct condition is that the vector sum of J_final and l must equal J_initial, considering all possible values of l that can satisfy this condition. \n\n1) For '3P0 + s': J_final = 0, l = 0, so J_initial = 0 = 0 + 0. Angular momentum is conserved.\n\n2) For '7D1 + p': J_final = 1, l = 1, so J_initial = 0 cannot equal 1 + 1. Angular momentum is not conserved.\n\n3) For '3D3 + f': J_final = 3, l = 3, so J_initial = 0 cannot equal 3 + 3. Angular momentum is not conserved.\n\n4) For '3S1 + p': J_final = 1, l = 1, so J_initial = 0 cannot equal 1 + 1. Angular momentum is not conserved.\n\nOnly '3P0 + s' conserves total angular momentum, as J_initial = J_final + l is satisfied with l = 0.; answer - '3P0 + s' conserves total angular momentum.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 7 output: thinking - The initial state is a 1S0 state, which has L = 0 and S = 0. The parity of the initial state is given by (-1)^L = (-1)^0 = +1. For each final state, we need to calculate the parity and compare it with the initial state's parity. The parity of the final NN state is given by (-1)^L(NN), and the parity of the emitted particle X is (-1)^(l+1), where l is the orbital angular momentum of X. The total parity of the final state is the product of these parities.\n\n1) For '3P0 + s':\n   - L(NN) = 1, so parity of NN = (-1)^1 = -1.\n   - l = 0, so parity of X = (-1)^(0+1) = -1.\n   - Total parity = (-1) * (-1) = +1, which matches the initial parity.\n\n2) For '7D1 + p':\n   - L(NN) = 2, so parity of NN = (-1)^2 = +1.\n   - l = 1, so parity of X = (-1)^(1+1) = +1.\n   - Total parity = (+1) * (+1) = +1, which matches the initial parity.\n\n3) For '3D3 + f':\n   - L(NN) = 2, so parity of NN = (-1)^2 = +1.\n   - l = 3, so parity of X = (-1)^(3+1) = +1.\n   - Total parity = (+1) * (+1) = +1, which matches the initial parity.\n\n4) For '3S1 + p':\n   - L(NN) = 0, so parity of NN = (-1)^0 = +1.\n   - l = 1, so parity of X = (-1)^(1+1) = +1.\n   - Total parity = (+1) * (+1) = +1, which matches the initial parity.\n\nAll choices satisfy parity conservation, but '3P0 + s' does not satisfy the Pauli statistics constraint, as S + L = 2 is even, which is not allowed for T = 0.; answer - All choices satisfy parity conservation, but '3P0 + s' is not permitted due to the Pauli statistics constraint.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 8 output: thinking - To determine which final NN partial wave choice is not permitted, we need to consider the constraints from Pauli statistics, angular momentum conservation, and parity conservation. The Pauli statistics constraint requires that for T(NN) = 0, the sum S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 must be even. The choice '3P0 + s' does not satisfy this requirement because S + L + 1 = 3, which is odd. Although '3P0 + s' satisfies angular momentum conservation (J_initial = J_final + l is satisfied with l = 0) and parity conservation, the violation of the Pauli statistics constraint is fundamental and cannot be overlooked. Therefore, '3P0 + s' is not permitted due to the violation of Pauli statistics.; answer - A)"
