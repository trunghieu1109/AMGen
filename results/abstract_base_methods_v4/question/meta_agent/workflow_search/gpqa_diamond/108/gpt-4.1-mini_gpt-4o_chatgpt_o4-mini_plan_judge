Question: Example(question='Consider a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state which emit a particle X of intrinsic parity -1. Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2).\n\nSuppose the final NN state has T(NN) = 0. Which of the following partial waves is not permitted, where the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X? Make use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity.\n\nNote that the term symbol (e.g. 1S0) is in general defined (2S+1)L(J), where S is the total spin, L the total orbital angular momentum written in spectroscopic notation, and J the total angular momentum.', choice1='1S0 -> 3P0 + s', choice2='1S0 -> 7D1 + p', choice3='1S0 -> 3D3 + f', choice4='1S0 -> 3S1 + p', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: To determine which final NN partial wave choice is not permitted, we need to consider the constraints from Pauli statistics, angular momentum conservation, and parity conservation. The Pauli statistics constraint requires that for T(NN) = 0, the sum S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 must be even. The choice '3P0 + s' does not satisfy this requirement because S + L + 1 = 3, which is odd. Although '3P0 + s' satisfies angular momentum conservation (J_initial = J_final + l is satisfied with l = 0) and parity conservation, the violation of the Pauli statistics constraint is fundamental and cannot be overlooked. Therefore, '3P0 + s' is not permitted due to the violation of Pauli statistics.
