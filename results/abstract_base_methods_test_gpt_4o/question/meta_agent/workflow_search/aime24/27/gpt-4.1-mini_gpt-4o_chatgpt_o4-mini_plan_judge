Question: Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_3_27
proposed answer: Both agents have consistently determined that the greatest four-digit number N is 9183. When dividing 9183 by 1000, the quotient Q is 9 and the remainder R is 183. The problem asks for the sum of Q and R, which is calculated as 9 + 183 = 192. This calculation is straightforward and consistent with the information provided in Sub-task 6. Therefore, the final decision on Q + R is 192.

Answer:Q + R = 192
Extracted answer: Q + R = 192
Correct answer: 699

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_3_27
proposed answer: Both agents have determined that the greatest four-digit number N that satisfies the condition is 9996. When dividing 9996 by 1000, the quotient Q is 9 and the remainder R is 996. The problem asks for the sum Q + R, which is 9 + 996 = 1005. Both agents agree on this calculation, and it is consistent with the conditions of the problem. Therefore, the final decision on Q + R is 1005.
