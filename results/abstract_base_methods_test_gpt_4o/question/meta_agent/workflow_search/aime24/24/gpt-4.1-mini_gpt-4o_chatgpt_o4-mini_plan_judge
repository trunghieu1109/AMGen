Question: Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations:
\[\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}\]\[\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}\]\[\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}\]
Then the value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: The problem asks for the sum of the numerator and the denominator of the simplified fraction \( \frac{m}{n} \) where \( m = 19 \) and \( n = 8 \). Since the fraction \( \frac{19}{8} \) is already in its simplest form, we simply add the numerator and the denominator to find \( m + n = 19 + 8 = 27 \).

proposed answer: The problem involves finding the value of \( \left| \log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) \right| \) and expressing it as a fraction \( \frac{m}{n} \) where \( m \) and \( n \) are relatively prime positive integers. From the previous sub-task, we determined that \( \left| \log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) \right| = \frac{11}{3} \). This fraction is already in its simplest form because 11 and 3 are coprime. Therefore, \( m = 11 \) and \( n = 3 \). The question asks for the sum \( m + n \), which is \( 11 + 3 = 14 \).
