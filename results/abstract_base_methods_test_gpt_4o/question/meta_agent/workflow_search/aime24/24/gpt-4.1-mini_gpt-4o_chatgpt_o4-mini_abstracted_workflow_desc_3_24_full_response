We can rewrite this equation as:\na = b + c + 1/2\n\nSubstitute b + c from the equation (a + b + c) = -13/24:\nb + c = -13/24 - a\n\nSubstitute into the expression for a:\na = (-13/24 - a) + 1/2\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\na = -13/24 - a + 12/24\n\nCombine like terms:\na + a = 12/24 - 13/24\na + a = -1/24\n2a = -1/24\n\na = -1/48\n\nThus, a = -1/48.

The original equations are: 1) a - b - c = 1/2, 2) b - a - c = 1/3, 3) c - a - b = 1/4. \n\nSubstituting into the first equation: a - b - c = -1/48 - (-5/48) - (-5/12) = -1/48 + 5/48 + 5/12. Converting 5/12 to a denominator of 48 gives 20/48. So, -1/48 + 5/48 + 20/48 = 24/48 = 1/2, which is correct.\n\nSubstituting into the second equation: b - a - c = -5/48 - (-1/48) - (-5/12) = -5/48 + 1/48 + 5/12. Converting 5/12 to a denominator of 48 gives 20/48. So, -5/48 + 1/48 + 20/48 = 16/48 = 1/3, which is correct.\n\nSubstituting into the third equation: c - a - b = -5/12 - (-1/48) - (-5/48) = -5/12 + 1/48 + 5/48. Converting -5/12 to a denominator of 48 gives -20/48. So, -20/48 + 1/48 + 5/48 = -14/48 = -7/24, which is incorrect. \n\nThere seems to be an inconsistency with the third equation, indicating a possible error in the calculation of c. However, the first two equations are satisfied, suggesting that the values of a and b are likely correct, but c needs to be re-evaluated.

We use the first equation of the system: a - b - c = 1/2. We can express a as a = (a + b + c) + 2b + 2c. Substituting a + b + c = -13/24 into this expression, we have a = -13/24 + 2b + 2c. However, to find a directly, we can rewrite the equation a - b - c = 1/2 as a = b + c + 1/2. Using a + b + c = -13/24, we have b + c = -13/24 - a. Substituting b + c = -13/24 - a into a = b + c + 1/2, we get a = (-13/24 - a) + 1/2.

The absolute value is \\( \\left| \\frac{11}{3} \\right| = \\frac{11}{3} \\). Therefore, the value of \\( \\left| \\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) \\right| \\) is \\( \\frac{11}{3} \\), and since \\( m = 11 \\) and \\( n = 3 \\), \\( m+n = 14 \\).

This fraction is already in its simplest form because 11 and 3 are coprime (i.e., they have no common factors other than 1).

The original equations are: 1) a - b - c = 1/2, 2) b - a - c = 1/3, 3) c - a - b = 1/4. We found a = 1/9, b = 5/36, and c = 1/4. Substituting these into the equations: 1) 1/9 - 5/36 - 1/4 = 1/2, converting to a common denominator of 36 gives 4/36 - 5/36 - 9/36 = -10/36 = -5/18, which is incorrect. 2) 5/36 - 1/9 - 1/4 = 1/3, converting to a common denominator of 36 gives 5/36 - 4/36 - 9/36 = -8/36 = -2/9, which is incorrect. 3) 1/4 - 1/9 - 5/36 = 1/4, converting to a common denominator of 36 gives 9/36 - 4/36 - 5/36 = 0, which is incorrect. The values do not satisfy the original equations, indicating an error in the solution.
