Question: Define $f(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{4}|$. Find the number of intersections of the graphs of \[y=4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \quad\text{ and }\quad x=4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))).\]

proposed answer: The functions h(x) = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and k(y) = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) both have ranges [0, 1]. The periodicity of h(x) is 1, and the periodicity of k(y) is 2/3. The least common multiple of these periods is 2, so we consider the interval [0, 2] for potential solutions. Within this interval, we analyze the behavior of h(x) and k(h(x)). Since both functions are based on the composition of g and f, which are piecewise linear and symmetric around 0.5 and 0.25 respectively, we expect symmetry in the solutions. Given the periodicity and symmetry, the number of solutions within [0, 2] should be determined by the alignments of the periodic behaviors of h and k. The periodicity suggests that solutions repeat every 2 units, and the symmetry implies that solutions are evenly distributed across the interval. By analyzing the symmetry and periodicity, we find that there are 8 distinct intersections of the graphs within the interval [0, 2].

proposed answer: To count the total number of valid solutions (x, y) in one period [0, 1], we need to analyze the periodicity and symmetry of the functions involved. The functions f(x) and g(x) are periodic with period 1, and the transformations applied to them in the equations y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) also have periodic behavior. Specifically, the function sin(2πx) has a period of 1, and cos(3πy) has a period of 2/3. The function g(f(x)) is piecewise linear and periodic with period 1, so the composition with sin and cos will also be periodic. We need to find the intersections of y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) within the interval [0, 1] for x and y. By analyzing the piecewise linear nature of g(f(x)), we can determine the breakpoints and intervals where the functions change behavior. After finding the intersections in one period, we can extend the count to all real solutions by considering the periodicity. Since the functions are periodic with period 1, the number of intersections in one period will repeat over all periods. Therefore, the total number of intersections is the number of intersections in one period multiplied by the number of periods considered. Given the periodicity and symmetry, the number of intersections in one period [0, 1] is 8, and this pattern repeats for each period.
