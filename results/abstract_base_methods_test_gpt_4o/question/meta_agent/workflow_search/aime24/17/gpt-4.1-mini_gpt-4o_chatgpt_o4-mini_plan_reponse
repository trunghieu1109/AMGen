        "sub_tasks_text": "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The expression a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b is symmetric in a, b, and c. We can try to express it in terms of symmetric polynomials like the elementary symmetric polynomials: s1 = a + b + c, s2 = ab + bc + ca, and s3 = abc. However, this expression is not directly expressible in terms of these elementary symmetric polynomials. Instead, we can notice that each term is of the form x^2y, which suggests a connection to the sum of squares and products. We can rewrite the expression as a^2(b+c) + b^2(a+c) + c^2(a+b). Since a + b + c = 300, we have b + c = 300 - a, a + c = 300 - b, and a + b = 300 - c. Substituting these into the expression, we get a^2(300-a) + b^2(300-b) + c^2(300-c). This is a simplified form that uses the given condition a + b + c = 300.; answer - a^2(300-a) + b^2(300-b) + c^2(300-c) = 6,000,000.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - We have the expression from Sub-task 1: a^2(300-a) + b^2(300-b) + c^2(300-c) = 6,000,000, with the constraint a + b + c = 300. We want to express this in terms of symmetric polynomials. One approach is to express each term in terms of the symmetric sums s1 = a + b + c = 300, s2 = ab + bc + ca, and s3 = abc. The expression a^2(300-a) can be expanded as 300a^2 - a^3. Similarly, b^2(300-b) = 300b^2 - b^3 and c^2(300-c) = 300c^2 - c^3. Therefore, the entire expression becomes: (300a^2 - a^3) + (300b^2 - b^3) + (300c^2 - c^3) = 6,000,000. This simplifies to 300(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) - (a^3 + b^3 + c^3) = 6,000,000. Now, we use the identity a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = (a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca) = 300^2 - 2s2. Also, we use the identity a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = (a + b + c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - bc - ca) + 3abc = 300((300^2 - 2s2) - s2) + 3s3 = 300(300^2 - 3s2) + 3s3. Substituting these into the expression, we have 300(300^2 - 2s2) - (300(300^2 - 3s2) + 3s3) = 6,000,000.

Simplifying this gives 300s2 - s3 = 2,000,000. These two equations, s1 = 300 and 300s2 - s3 = 2,000,000, characterize the possible triples (a, b, c) that satisfy both conditions. However, these equations alone do not uniquely determine the integer values of a, b, and c, as they are underdetermined. Additional constraints or methods, such as analyzing the polynomial x^3 - s1x^2 + s2x - s3 = 0, are needed to find specific integer solutions.

This identity comes from the fact that the expression a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b can be rewritten in terms of symmetric polynomials. The symmetric sum s1 is the sum of the variables, s2 is the sum of the products of the variables taken two at a time, and s3 is the product of the variables. By using the identity, we can express the given polynomial sum in terms of these symmetric sums, which simplifies the algebraic manipulation needed to solve the problem.; answer - a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = s1*s2 - 3*s3\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - We start with the expression from Sub-task 1: a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = s1*s2 - 3*s3.

To verify the algebraic correctness, we can check that the substitution was done correctly and that the resulting equation is consistent with the original problem statement. The substitution and resulting equation are consistent and correct given the identities and constraints provided.; answer - 300*s2 - 3*s3 = 6,000,000\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - To verify the algebraic identity and substitution, we need to independently expand and simplify the original polynomial sum a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b for sample triples (a, b, c) and compare it with the expression 300*s2 - 3*s3. We have already tested the triples (100, 100, 100) and (150, 100, 50), and both satisfy the condition 300*s2 - 3*s3 = 6,000,000. For (100, 100, 100), s1 = 300, s2 = 30000, s3 = 1000000, and the expression evaluates to 6000000, matching the condition. For (150, 100, 50), s1 = 300, s2 = 27500, s3 = 750000, and the expression also evaluates to 6000000. These checks confirm the correctness of the symmetric polynomial representation and substitution for these cases. However, the limitation is that only a few specific cases were tested, and the verification relies on the assumption that the identity holds for all triples (a, b, c) satisfying the conditions. A more thorough proof or a broader range of test cases would strengthen the verification. The identity sum_sym a^2b = s1*s2 - 3*s3 is a known result in symmetric polynomials, and the substitution s1 = 300 is straightforward. The consistency of the results for the tested cases suggests that the identity and substitution are correct, but further testing or a formal proof would be ideal to ensure there are no algebraic errors.; answer - The algebraic identity and substitution are correct, as verified by expanding and simplifying the polynomial sum for sample triples (a, b, c) and confirming consistency with the symmetric polynomial representation. However, further testing or a formal proof would strengthen the verification.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - We have the equation 300*s2 - 3*s3 = 6,000,000, which simplifies to 100*s2 - s3 = 2,000,000. We need to find feasible integer ranges for s2 and s3 given that a, b, c are nonnegative integers. Since s2 = ab + ac + bc and s3 = abc, both s2 and s3 are nonnegative. From the equation, we have s3 = 100*s2 - 2,000,000. For s3 to be nonnegative, we need 100*s2 >= 2,000,000, which gives s2 >= 20,000. Additionally, since s2 = ab + ac + bc, the maximum value of s2 occurs when two of the variables are 0 and the third is 300, giving s2 = 0. However, this is not possible here due to the constraint on s3. The minimum value of s2 is when a, b, c are as equal as possible, which is around 30,000 when a = b = c = 100. Therefore, s2 must be at least 20,000 and at most around 30,000. For s3, since s3 = abc, the maximum value occurs when a, b, c are as equal as possible, which is around 1,000,000 when a = b = c = 100. Therefore, s3 must be at least 0 and at most around 1,000,000. These bounds are consistent with the equation 100*s2 - s3 = 2,000,000, as s2 and s3 must satisfy this equation while being nonnegative integers.; answer - s2 must be between 20,000 and 30,000, and s3 must be between 0 and 1,000,000, satisfying 100*s2 - s3 = 2,000,000.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - To solve this problem, we need to count the number of nonnegative integer triples (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 and the polynomial condition a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000 is satisfied. Based on the previous analysis, we have the derived relation 300*s2 - 3*s3 = 6,000,000, or equivalently 100*s2 - s3 = 2,000,000, where s2 = ab + ac + bc and s3 = abc.

For each triple (a, b, c), we check if the polynomial condition is satisfied. However, this direct approach could be computationally expensive due to the large number of possible triples. \n\nTo optimize, we can use the bounds on s2 and s3 to prune the search space.

Additionally, we can leverage symmetry and properties of the polynomial to reduce redundant calculations. We can also use the fact that the maximum value of s3 occurs when a, b, and c are close to each other, which can guide our choice of starting points and ranges for a and b.\n\nBy implementing this strategy, we can efficiently count the number of valid triples (a, b, c) that satisfy both the sum and polynomial conditions.

This approach balances computational feasibility with correctness.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 6 output: thinking - Both agents agree on the approach of using symmetry considerations by ordering the triples as a <= b <= c to avoid duplicate counting. This method ensures that each distinct solution is counted only once. By iterating over possible values of a, and for each fixed a, iterating over b such that a <= b, we can compute c = 300 - a - b with the constraint that b <= c. This ensures that we only consider triples (a, b, c) where a <= b <= c. For each valid triple, we verify the polynomial condition a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000. The derived relation 100*s2 - s3 = 2,000,000 (where s2 = ab + ac + bc and s3 = abc) is used to quickly check if a triple satisfies the polynomial condition.
