To derive a system of equations relating ln(x) and ln(y), we can express ln(y) in terms of ln(x) from the first equation: ln(y) = (10 ln(x)) / x. Similarly, from the second equation, we can express ln(x) in terms of ln(y): ln(x) = (10 ln(y)) / (4y). These two expressions form a system of equations relating ln(x) and ln(y). The limitation of this system is that it does not directly provide the values of x and y, and further manipulation or substitution is needed to find specific values.

For the first equation, divide both sides by x to get ln(y) = (10/x) ln(x). For the second equation, divide both sides by 4y to get ln(x) = (10/4y) ln(y). This gives us a system of equations: ln(y) = (10/x) ln(x) and ln(x) = (10/4y) ln(y). These equations express ln(y) in terms of ln(x) and vice versa, forming a system of equations relating ln(x) and ln(y).
