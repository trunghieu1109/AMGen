Question: Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_1_1
proposed answer: The problem requires finding the length AP in the form of a fraction m/n where m and n are relatively prime, and then computing the sum m + n. From the related sub-task, we have already determined that AP can be expressed as the fraction 343/50, where 343 and 50 are relatively prime integers. Therefore, m = 343 and n = 50. The sum m + n is 343 + 50 = 393. This matches the answer provided in the related sub-task, confirming that the calculation is correct.

proposed answer: The problem requires finding the length AP in the form of a fraction m/n, where m and n are relatively prime integers. From the related sub-task, we have determined that AP = 6/5. Here, m = 6 and n = 5, which are relatively prime. Therefore, the sum m + n is 6 + 5 = 11. This matches the answer provided in the related sub-task, confirming the correctness of the solution.
