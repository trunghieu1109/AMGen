Question: Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_3_6
proposed answer: The problem requires us to find the sum p + q, where r^2 is expressed as a fraction p/q in its simplest form. From the sub-task answers, it was determined that the minimum value of r^2 is 27, which can be expressed as the fraction 27/1. Since 27 and 1 are relatively prime, the fraction is already in its simplest form. Therefore, p = 27 and q = 1. The sum of p and q is 27 + 1 = 28. Both agents agree on this conclusion, confirming that the sum of p and q is 28.
