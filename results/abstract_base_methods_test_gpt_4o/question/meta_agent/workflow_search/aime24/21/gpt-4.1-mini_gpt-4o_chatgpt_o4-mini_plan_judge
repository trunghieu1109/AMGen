Question: Find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon ($12$-gon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The diagram below shows three of those rectangles.

proposed answer: To count the unique rectangles, we need to consider each valid pair of parallel sides identified in Sub-task 5 and determine how many unique rectangles can be formed. We have three types of pairings: 1. Sides of the dodecagon with diagonals skipping 5 vertices. There are 12 sides, and each side can pair with two diagonals skipping 5 vertices (since there are 6 such diagonals, and each one can form a rectangle with two sides). This gives us 12 * 2 = 24 rectangles. 2. Diagonals skipping 1 vertex with diagonals skipping 4 vertices. There are 12 diagonals skipping 1 vertex and 12 diagonals skipping 4 vertices. Each diagonal skipping 1 vertex can pair with one diagonal skipping 4 vertices to form a rectangle, giving us 12 rectangles. 3. Diagonals skipping 2 vertices with diagonals skipping 3 vertices. There are 12 diagonals skipping 2 vertices and 12 diagonals skipping 3 vertices. Each diagonal skipping 2 vertices can pair with one diagonal skipping 3 vertices to form a rectangle, giving us 12 rectangles. Adding these, we have 24 + 12 + 12 = 48 unique rectangles.

proposed answer: To find the number of unique rectangles that can be formed, we must consider the valid configurations identified in Sub-task 5. Each configuration corresponds to a unique rectangle. The configurations are: (1,4) with (0,3), (3,4) with (0,1), (2,6) with (0,4), (4,6) with (0,2), (6,11) with (0,5), and (5,11) with (0,6). Each of these represents a distinct rectangle because they involve different sets of vertices from the dodecagon. Since a regular dodecagon has rotational symmetry, each configuration is unique, and there are no duplicates when considering the symmetry. Thus, the total number of unique rectangles is simply the count of these configurations. We have verified that these configurations form rectangles with opposite sides equal and right angles, and they lie entirely within the dodecagon. Therefore, the count of unique rectangles is 6.
