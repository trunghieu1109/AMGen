Question: Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.

proposed answer: The expression for BD^2 is given by BD^2 = 80 + 176 tan^2(t_2). To find the greatest real number less than BD^2 for all such rhombi, we need to consider the behavior of the expression as tan^2(t_2) varies. The expression is minimized when tan^2(t_2) is minimized, which is 0, giving BD^2 = 80. However, the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD^2, which implies we need to consider values just below the minimum possible BD^2. Since BD^2 = 80 is the minimum value, the greatest real number less than this minimum is 79, as it is the largest integer less than 80. Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD^2 for all such rhombi is 79.

proposed answer: The problem asks for the greatest real number that is less than BD^2 for all such rhombi. This means we need to find the maximum possible value of BD^2 and then determine the greatest real number that is strictly less than this maximum value. From the analysis of the hyperbola and the conditions of the rhombus, we know that the maximum value of BD^2 occurs when the parameters are chosen such that the rhombus is non-degenerate and the diagonals are maximized. The maximum value of BD^2 is determined by the geometry of the hyperbola and the constraints of the rhombus. If we denote this maximum value as M, then the greatest real number less than M is M - 1, assuming M is an integer. If M is not an integer, the greatest integer less than M is floor(M). Therefore, we need to calculate the maximum possible value of BD^2 and then find the greatest integer less than this value. Based on the problem setup and previous analysis, the maximum value of BD^2 is 176, so the greatest real number less than this is 175.
