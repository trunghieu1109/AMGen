In base b, any two-digit number can be written as n = x * b + y, where x is the most significant digit and y is the least significant digit. According to the definition of a b-eautiful number, the sum of the digits x and y must equal the square root of n, i.e., x + y = √n. Since √n must be an integer, n must be a perfect square. Substituting n = x * b + y into the condition x + y = √n gives us the equation x + y = √(x * b + y). Therefore, the resulting equation linking x, y, and b is x + y = √(x * b + y).

Since n = x * b + y must be a perfect square, we can let n = k^2 for some integer k, which implies √n = k. Therefore, we have x + y = k. Substituting n = k^2 into the equation n = x * b + y gives us k^2 = x * b + y. We now have two equations: x + y = k and x * b + y = k^2. From x + y = k, we can express y as y = k - x. Substituting this into the second equation gives x * b + (k - x) = k^2, which simplifies to x * (b - 1) + k = k^2. Rearranging gives x * (b - 1) = k^2 - k, so x = (k^2 - k) / (b - 1). For x to be an integer, (k^2 - k) must be divisible by (b - 1). Additionally, we have the constraints 1 ≤ x ≤ b - 1 and 0 ≤ y ≤ b - 1. Since y = k - x, we also have 0 ≤ k - x ≤ b - 1. These constraints allow us to enumerate possible values of k, x, and y for a given b to find valid b-eautiful numbers.

This involves calculating n = x * b + y for each base, where 1 ≤ x ≤ b-1 and 0 ≤ y ≤ b-1, and checking if n is a perfect square with x + y = √n. By doing this independently, we can cross-validate the results to ensure accuracy. Discrepancies may arise from computational errors or incorrect boundary conditions. Resolving these requires careful checking of each step and ensuring the calculations adhere to the conditions for a b-eautiful number. This systematic approach ensures that we accurately count the b-eautiful numbers for each base and identify the smallest base with more than ten such numbers. Since the task is computationally intensive and the previous analyses did not provide complete counts, this verification process is crucial for ensuring accuracy.

A b-eautiful number n in base b is formed by two digits x and y such that n = x * b + y, where 1 ≤ x ≤ b-1 and 0 ≤ y ≤ b-1, and n is a perfect square with x + y = √n. We need to compute the number of such numbers for each base starting from b = 2 and identify the first base where this count exceeds 10. This involves checking each base systematically and ensuring the conditions are met for each possible two-digit number in that base. Once the counts are verified, we compare results from independent analyses to confirm accuracy.

This involves checking each base from 2 onwards and counting the b-eautiful numbers by considering numbers of the form n = x * b + y, where 1 ≤ x ≤ b-1 and 0 ≤ y ≤ b-1. For each n, we check if it is a perfect square and if the sum of digits x and y equals the square root of n. By performing these computations for bases 2 to 20, we can determine the number of b-eautiful numbers for each base. The smallest base with more than 10 such numbers can be identified by comparing these counts.
