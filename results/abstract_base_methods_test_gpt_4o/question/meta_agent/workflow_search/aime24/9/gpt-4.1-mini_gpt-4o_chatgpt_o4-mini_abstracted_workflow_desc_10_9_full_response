Question: Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

From Sub-task 4, we know there is 1 grand prize winning outcome. From Sub-task 3, we know there are 115 total winning outcomes where Jen matches at least two numbers. Therefore, the conditional probability is given by the ratio 1/115. This fraction is already in its simplest form because 1 is the numerator, and 115 is the denominator, which are relatively prime.

From Sub-task 4, we know that the number of grand prize outcomes is 1. From Sub-task 3, the total number of winning outcomes where Jen matches at least two numbers is 115. Therefore, the conditional probability is the ratio of these two numbers: 1/115. The probability is expressed as a fraction m/n where m and n are relatively prime integers. In this case, m = 1 and n = 115, so they are already relatively prime.

The number of ways to choose k elements from a set of n elements is given by the binomial coefficient C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!). Here, n = 10 and k = 4, so we calculate C(10, 4) = 10! / (4!(10-4)!) = 10! / (4!6!) = (10 * 9 * 8 * 7) / (4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = 210.

Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S. The lottery also picks 4 distinct numbers from S. We need to count the number of ways these picks overlap in exactly k numbers. For k = 2: Jen's 4 numbers match exactly 2 of the lottery's numbers, so we choose 2 out of Jen's 4 numbers to match (C(4, 2)) and 2 out of the remaining 6 numbers in S to fill the rest (C(6, 2)).
