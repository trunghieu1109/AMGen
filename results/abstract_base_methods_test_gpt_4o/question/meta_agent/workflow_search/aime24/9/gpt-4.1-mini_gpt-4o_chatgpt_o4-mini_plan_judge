Question: Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_10_9
proposed answer: The conditional probability that Jen wins the grand prize given that she wins a prize is calculated by dividing the number of grand prize outcomes by the total number of winning outcomes. From the sub-tasks, we know that there is 1 grand prize outcome and 115 total winning outcomes where Jen matches at least two numbers. Therefore, the conditional probability is 1/115. This fraction is already in its simplest form because 1 and 115 are relatively prime. Thus, m = 1 and n = 115. The problem asks for the sum m+n, which is 1 + 115 = 116.
