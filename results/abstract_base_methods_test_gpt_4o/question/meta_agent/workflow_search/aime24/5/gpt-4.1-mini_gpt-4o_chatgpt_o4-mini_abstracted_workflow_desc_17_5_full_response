To analyze the geometric properties, we note that the opposite edges are equal: AB = CD, AC = BD, and BC = AD. This suggests a high degree of symmetry. We can check if the faces are congruent by considering the triangles formed by these edges. For example, triangle ABC has sides AB = √41, AC = √80, and BC = √89.
