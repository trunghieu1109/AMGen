Since \\( \\omega \\) is a 13th root of unity, \\( \\omega^k \\) for \\( k = 0, 1, \\ldots, 12 \\) are all the 13th roots of unity. We can rewrite the expression as a product over the roots of unity of a polynomial in \\( x \\). Let us consider the polynomial \\( P(x) = 2 - 2x + x^2 \\).

The polynomial whose roots are \\( \\omega^k \\) for \\( k = 1, 2, \\ldots, 12 \\) is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial \\( \\Phi_{13}(x) \\). Therefore, the product \\( \\prod_{k=0}^{12} P(\\omega^k) \\) can be expressed as \\( P(1) \\times \\prod_{k=1}^{12} P(\\omega^k) \\). Since \\( P(x) = 2 - 2x + x^2 \\), we evaluate \\( P(1) = 2 - 2\\times1 + 1^2 = 1 \\). Then, we need to evaluate \\( \\prod_{k=1}^{12} P(\\omega^k) \\), which is essentially evaluating the polynomial \\( P(x) \\) over the roots of the 13th cyclotomic polynomial. This can be interpreted as evaluating the product of the values of \\( P(x) \\) at the roots of \\( \\Phi_{13}(x) \\), which simplifies to \\( \\Phi_{13}(2 - 2x + x^2) \\).

The expression \\( \\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\\omega^k+\\omega^{2k}) \\) can be related to evaluating a transformation of this polynomial. Specifically, if we define the transformation as \\( P(x) = 2 - 2x + x^2 \\), then the product can be expressed as \\( P(1) \\times \\prod_{k=1}^{12} P(\\omega^k) \\).

The expression (\\omega^k - 1)^2 + 1 can be seen as a transformation of \\omega^k, where we first shift \\omega^k by -1, square the result, and then add 1. This transformation does not simplify further using standard algebraic identities for roots of unity, as it is already in a simplified polynomial form.

The expression \\(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k}\\) can be rewritten using the simplification \\((\\omega^k - 1)^2 + 1\\). Therefore, the product over all 13th roots of unity is equivalent to the resultant \\(Res_x(x^{13} - 1, P(x))\\), where \\(P(x) = 2 - 2x + x^2\\).

Both agents attempted to use De Moivre's Theorem to compute (1 + i)^{13} and (1 - i)^{13). The modulus of 1 + i is sqrt(2), and its argument is pi/4. Therefore, (1 + i)^{13} = (sqrt(2))^{13} * (cos(13*pi/4) + i*sin(13*pi/4)). The angle 13*pi/4 is equivalent to pi/4 (since 13*pi/4 = 3*pi + pi/4, and cos and sin are periodic with period 2*pi). Thus, (1 + i)^{13} = (sqrt(2))^{13} * (sqrt(2)/2 + i*sqrt(2)/2) = 128 + 128i. Similarly, (1 - i)^{13} = 128 - 128i.

This can be verified by noting that 32513 = 32 * 1000 + 513, which confirms that 513 is indeed the remainder when 32513 is divided by 1000.
