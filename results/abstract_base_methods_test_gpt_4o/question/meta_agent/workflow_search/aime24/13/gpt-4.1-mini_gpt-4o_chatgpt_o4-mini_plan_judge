Question: Eight circles of radius $34$ are sequentially tangent, and two of the circles are tangent to $AB$ and $BC$ of triangle $ABC$, respectively. $2024$ circles of radius $1$ can be arranged in the same manner. The inradius of triangle $ABC$ can be expressed as $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine the inradius of triangle ABC based on the two scenarios provided. In the first scenario, we have 8 circles of radius 34, and in the second scenario, we have 2024 circles of radius 1. The key is to find a relationship between the number of circles, their radii, and the inradius of the triangle. The total length of the chain of circles in the first scenario is 476 units (8 circles with centers 68 units apart), and in the second scenario, it is 2023 units (2024 circles with centers 2 units apart). The inradius is proportional to the total length of the chain of circles. Therefore, the ratio of the inradii is equal to the ratio of the total lengths of the chains: r1/r2 = 476/2023. Since the inradius for the scenario with 2024 circles of radius 1 is 1, we have r1 = 476/2023. Simplifying this fraction, we get that the inradius is 476/2023. The greatest common divisor of 476 and 2023 is 1, so the fraction is already in its simplest form. Therefore, m = 476 and n = 2023, and m+n = 476 + 2023 = 2499.
