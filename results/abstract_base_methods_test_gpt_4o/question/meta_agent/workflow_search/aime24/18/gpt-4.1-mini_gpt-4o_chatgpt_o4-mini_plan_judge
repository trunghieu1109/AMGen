Question: Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). Then \(OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\).

proposed answer: The unique point C on the segment \( \overline{AB} \) was found to be \( C = \left( \frac{1}{4}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \right) \). To find \( OC^2 \), we use the distance formula from the origin to point C: \( OC^2 = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \right)^2 \). Calculating this, we have \( OC^2 = \frac{1}{16} + \frac{3}{16} = \frac{4}{16} = \frac{1}{4} \). The fraction \( \frac{1}{4} \) is already in its simplest form with \( p = 1 \) and \( q = 4 \), which are relatively prime. Therefore, \( p + q = 1 + 4 = 5 \). This matches the previous sub-task answer, confirming the correctness of the calculation.

proposed answer: The problem involves finding the point C on the segment AB such that it does not belong to any segment from the family \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). The point C was found to be \(C = \left(\frac{1}{4}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}\right)\). To find \(OC^2\), we use the distance formula from the origin O to the point C: \(OC = \sqrt{\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}\right)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{16} + \frac{3}{16}} = \sqrt{\frac{4}{16}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{4}} = \frac{1}{2}\). Therefore, \(OC^2 = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}\). The fraction \(\frac{1}{4}\) is already in its reduced form with \(p = 1\) and \(q = 4\), which are relatively prime. Thus, the sum \(p + q = 1 + 4 = 5\).
