We need to calculate OC^2, where O is the origin (0, 0). The distance OC is calculated using the distance formula: OC = sqrt((1/4)^2 + (sqrt(3)/4)^2). This simplifies to OC = sqrt(1/16 + 3/16) = sqrt(4/16) = sqrt(1/4) = 1/2. Therefore, OC^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4. Expressing this as a fraction, we have OC^2 = 1/4, where p = 1 and q = 4 are relatively prime.

From Sub-task 1, we have \\( P = (\\cos \\theta, 0) \\) and \\( Q = (0, \\sin \\theta) \\) for \\( 0 < \\theta < \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\). A point on the segment \\( \\overline{PQ} \\) can be expressed as a linear combination of \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\). Specifically, the point can be written as \\( (1-s)P + sQ \\).

A segment PQ of unit length with P = (x, 0) and Q = (0, y) satisfies x^2 + y^2 = 1. The point C can be expressed as C = (sx, (1-s)y) for some 0 <= s <= 1. Substituting C = (1/4, sqrt(3)/4), we get the system: 1/4 = sx and sqrt(3)/4 = (1-s)y. Solving for x and y, we have x = 1/(4s) and y = sqrt(3)/(4(1-s)). Substituting into x^2 + y^2 = 1, we get (1/(4s))^2 + (sqrt(3)/(4(1-s)))^2 = 1. Simplifying, we have 1/(16s^2) + 3/(16(1-s)^2) = 1. Multiplying through by 16s^2(1-s)^2, we get (1-s)^2 + 3s^2 = 16s^2(1-s)^2. Expanding and simplifying, we get 1 - 2s + s^2 + 3s^2 = 16s^2 - 32s^3 + 16s^4. This simplifies to 1 - 2s + 4s^2 = 16s^2 - 32s^3 + 16s^4. Rearranging, we have 16s^4 - 32s^3 + 12s^2 + 2s - 1 = 0.

Calculating this, we have (1/4)^2 = 1/16 and (sqrt(3)/4)^2 = 3/16. Therefore, OC^2 = 1/16 + 3/16 = 4/16 = 1/4.

This simplifies to OC = sqrt(1/16 + 3/16) = sqrt(4/16) = sqrt(1/4) = 1/2. Therefore, OC^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4.
