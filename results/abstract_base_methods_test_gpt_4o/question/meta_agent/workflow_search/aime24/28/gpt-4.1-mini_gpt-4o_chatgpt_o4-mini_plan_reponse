The torus is formed by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis that is 6 units away from the circle's center. This means the major radius R is 6 and the minor radius r is 3. In a 3D coordinate system, the parametric equations for the torus can be given as follows: Let \\( \\theta \\) and \\( \\phi \\) be parameters where \\( \\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi) \\) represents the angle around the tube, and \\( \\phi \\in [0, 2\\pi) \\) represents the angle around the torus. The parametric equations are: \\( x = (R + r \\cos \\theta) \\cos \\phi \\), \\( y = (R + r \\cos \\theta) \\sin \\phi \\), \\( z = r \\sin \\theta \\).

The sphere S has radius 11 and can be positioned for tangency.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - To determine the two distinct positions where the torus T is externally tangent to the sphere S, we need to consider the geometry of the torus and the sphere. The torus has a major radius R = 6 and a minor radius r = 3. The sphere has a radius of 11. When the torus is tangent to the sphere on the inner side of the torus tube, the center of the sphere is at a distance of R - r + 11 from the center of the torus. This is because the sphere's surface must touch the inner side of the torus tube, which is 3 units away from the center of the torus. Therefore, the distance from the center of the torus to the center of the sphere is 6 - 3 + 11 = 14. The radius of the circle of tangency, r_i, is the distance from the center of the sphere to the point of tangency, which is 11 - (R - r) = 11 - 3 = 8. When the torus is tangent to the sphere on the outer side of the torus tube, the center of the sphere is at a distance of R + r + 11 from the center of the torus. This is because the sphere's surface must touch the outer side of the torus tube, which is 3 units away from the center of the torus. Therefore, the distance from the center of the torus to the center of the sphere is 6 + 3 + 11 = 20. The radius of the circle of tangency, r_o, is the distance from the center of the sphere to the point of tangency, which is 11 - (R + r) = 11 - 9 = 2. The difference r_i - r_o is 8 - 2 = 6.

This means the major radius (distance from the center of the torus to the center of the tube) is 6, and the minor radius (radius of the tube) is 3. The sphere S has a radius of 11. To analyze the problem, we can set up a coordinate system where the center of the sphere S is at the origin (0, 0, 0). The torus T can be positioned such that its center is at (0, 0, 11 + 3) = (0, 0, 14) when it is resting on the sphere. This is because the sphere's radius is 11, and the torus's minor radius is 3, so the center of the torus must be 14 units from the center of the sphere to be tangent. The torus is tangent to the sphere along a circle, and we need to find the radii of these tangent circles when the torus is both resting on and under the sphere.; answer - The torus T is formed by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis in the plane of the circle at a distance of 6 from its center, giving it a major radius R=6 and a minor radius r=3. The sphere S has a radius of 11. In a coordinate system, place the center of the sphere S at the origin (0, 0, 0). When the torus T is resting on the sphere, its center is at (0, 0, 14), and when it is under the sphere, its center is at (0, 0, -14).\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - To derive the implicit equation of the torus T, we consider its geometric formation. The torus is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 (minor radius) around an axis that is 6 units away (major radius). If we place the center of the torus at (0, 0, 14) when it is resting on the sphere, we can use the following approach. In a coordinate system (x, y, z), the torus can be described by the equation: ((x^2 + y^2)^(1/2) - 6)^2 + z^2 = 3^2. This equation accounts for the fact that at any cross-section perpendicular to the z-axis, the distance from the center of the torus to the axis of revolution is 6, and the radius of the circle being revolved is 3. The implicit equation of the sphere S, centered at the origin with radius 11, is simply x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 11^2. This is the standard equation for a sphere centered at the origin with a given radius.; answer - The implicit equation of the torus T is ((x^2 + y^2)^(1/2) - 6)^2 + z^2 = 9, and the implicit equation of the sphere S is x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 121.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - To formulate the external tangency condition between the torus T and the sphere S, we need to consider the equations of both surfaces and the condition for tangency. The torus T is described by the equation ((x^2 + y^2)^(1/2) - 6)^2 + z^2 = 9, and the sphere S is described by the equation x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 121. For the torus to be externally tangent to the sphere, they must intersect along a circle, and at every point of this circle, the normal vectors to the surfaces must be parallel. The normal vector to the sphere at a point (x, y, z) is the gradient of its equation, which is (2x, 2y, 2z). The normal vector to the torus at a point (x, y, z) can be found by taking the gradient of its equation. The gradient of the torus equation involves the partial derivatives with respect to x, y, and z. Specifically, the gradient of the torus equation is: (2(x^2 + y^2)^(1/2) - 12)x/(x^2 + y^2)^(1/2), (2(x^2 + y^2)^(1/2) - 12)y/(x^2 + y^2)^(1/2), 2z. For tangency, these gradients must be proportional, meaning there exists a scalar \u03bb such that the gradient of the torus equation is \u03bb times the gradient of the sphere equation. This gives us the system of equations: (2(x^2 + y^2)^(1/2) - 12)x/(x^2 + y^2)^(1/2) = 2\u03bbx, (2(x^2 + y^2)^(1/2) - 12)y/(x^2 + y^2)^(1/2) = 2\u03bby, 2z = 2\u03bbz. Additionally, the points of tangency must satisfy both the torus and sphere equations. By solving this system, we can find the angular parameter \u03b8* that describes the circle(s) of tangency. The key is to solve for the points (x, y, z) that satisfy these conditions, which will give us the circle of tangency.; answer - The external tangency condition requires that the gradients of the torus and sphere equations are proportional at the points of intersection, and these points must satisfy both the torus and sphere equations. This leads to a system of equations: (2(x^2 + y^2)^(1/2) - 12)x/(x^2 + y^2)^(1/2) = 2\u03bbx, (2(x^2 + y^2)^(1/2) - 12)y/(x^2 + y^2)^(1/2) = 2\u03bby, 2z = 2\u03bbz, along with the original surface equations. Solving this system will identify the parameters describing the circle(s) of tangency.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - To solve the problem, we need to find the radii of the circles of tangency when the torus is externally tangent to the sphere in two different configurations: one where the torus is resting on the sphere and one where it is under the sphere.

When the torus is resting on the sphere, the center of the torus is at (0, 0, 14), and when it is under the sphere, the center is at (0, 0, -8).
