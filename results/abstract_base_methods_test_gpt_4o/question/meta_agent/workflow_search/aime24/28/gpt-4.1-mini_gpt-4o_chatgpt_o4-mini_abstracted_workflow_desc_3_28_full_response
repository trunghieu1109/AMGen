Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$.

This means the major radius (distance from the center of the torus to the center of the tube) is 6, and the minor radius (radius of the tube) is 3. The sphere S has a radius of 11. To analyze the problem, we can set up a coordinate system where the center of the sphere S is at the origin (0, 0, 0). The torus T can be positioned such that its center is at (0, 0, 11 + 3) = (0, 0, 14) when it is resting on the sphere. This is because the sphere's radius is 11, and the torus's minor radius is 3, so the center of the torus must be 14 units from the center of the sphere to be tangent. The torus is tangent to the sphere along a circle, and we need to find the radii of these tangent circles when the torus is both resting on and under the sphere.; answer - The torus T is formed by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis in the plane of the circle at a distance of 6 from its center, giving it a major radius R=6 and a minor radius r=3.

The torus is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 (minor radius) around an axis that is 6 units away (major radius). If we place the center of the torus at (0, 0, 14) when it is resting on the sphere, we can use the following approach. In a coordinate system (x, y, z), the torus can be described by the equation: ((x^2 + y^2)^(1/2) - 6)^2 + z^2 = 3^2. This equation accounts for the fact that at any cross-section perpendicular to the z-axis, the distance from the center of the torus to the axis of revolution is 6, and the radius of the circle being revolved is 3. The implicit equation of the sphere S, centered at the origin with radius 11, is simply x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 11^2. This is the standard equation for a sphere centered at the origin with a given radius.; answer - The implicit equation of the torus T is ((x^2 + y^2)^(1/2) - 6)^2 + z^2 = 9, and the implicit equation of the sphere S is x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 121.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - To formulate the external tangency condition between the torus T and the sphere S, we need to consider the equations of both surfaces and the condition for tangency. The torus T is described by the equation ((x^2 + y^2)^(1/2) - 6)^2 + z^2 = 9, and the sphere S is described by the equation x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 121. For the torus to be externally tangent to the sphere, they must intersect along a circle, and at every point of this circle, the normal vectors to the surfaces must be parallel. The normal vector to the sphere at a point (x, y, z) is the gradient of its equation, which is (2x, 2y, 2z). The normal vector to the torus at a point (x, y, z) can be found by taking the gradient of its equation. The gradient of the torus equation involves the partial derivatives with respect to x, y, and z. Specifically, the gradient of the torus equation is: (2(x^2 + y^2)^(1/2) - 12)x/(x^2 + y^2)^(1/2), (2(x^2 + y^2)^(1/2) - 12)y/(x^2 + y^2)^(1/2), 2z. For tangency, these gradients must be proportional, meaning there exists a scalar λ such that the gradient of the torus equation is λ times the gradient of the sphere equation. This gives us the system of equations: (2(x^2 + y^2)^(1/2) - 12)x/(x^2 + y^2)^(1/2) = 2λx, (2(x^2 + y^2)^(1/2) - 12)y/(x^2 + y^2)^(1/2) = 2λy, 2z = 2λz. Additionally, the points of tangency must satisfy both the torus and sphere equations. By solving this system, we can find the angular parameter θ* that describes the circle(s) of tangency. The key is to solve for the points (x, y, z) that satisfy these conditions, which will give us the circle of tangency.; answer - The external tangency condition requires that the gradients of the torus and sphere equations are proportional at the points of intersection, and these points must satisfy both the torus and sphere equations.

This difference can be expressed as a fraction 6/1, where m = 6 and n = 1. Thus, m + n = 6 + 1 = 7.; correct: The radii calculations are correct based on the geometry of the torus and sphere. The torus has a major radius of 6 and a minor radius of 3. When the torus is resting on the sphere, the circle of tangency on the outer side of the torus is 9 units from the center of the torus. When the torus is under the sphere, the circle of tangency on the inner side is 3 units from the center of the torus. The difference r_i - r_o is indeed -6, and taking the absolute value gives 6. The fraction 6/1 is correct, and m + n = 7.\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent 1GBZ, refining radii calculations, thinking: The torus T is formed by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis that is 6 units away from the center of the circle, giving it a major radius R=6 and a minor radius r=3. The sphere S has a radius of 11. When the torus is resting on the sphere, the center of the torus is at (0, 0, 14), and when it is under the sphere, the center is at (0, 0, -8). The circle of tangency occurs where the distance from the center of the torus to the surface of the sphere is equal to the minor radius of the torus. For the torus resting on the sphere, the circle of tangency is on the outer side of the tube, and for the torus under the sphere, it is on the inner side. The radius of the circle of tangency can be found by considering the geometry of the torus and the sphere. When the torus is resting on the sphere, the circle of tangency has a radius of 9, and when the torus is under the sphere, the circle of tangency has a radius of 3. The difference in the radii of the circles of tangency is 9 - 3 = 6. This difference can be expressed as a fraction \\( \\frac{6}{1} \\), where \\( m = 6 \\) and \\( n = 1 \\). Thus, \\( m + n = 6 + 1 = 7 \\).; answer: The radii of the circles of tangency are r_o = 9 and r_i = 3. The difference r_i - r_o is 3 - 9 = -6, which can be expressed as -6/1. However, the problem asks for the positive difference, so we take the absolute value, which is 6. This difference can be expressed as a fraction 6/1, where m = 6 and n = 1. Thus, m + n = 6 + 1 = 7.\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent bZGG, round 0, calculating simplified fraction m/n, thinking: In Sub-task 5, we determined that the radii of the circles of tangency are r_o = 9 and r_i = 3. The difference r_i - r_o is calculated as 3 - 9 = -6. However, since the problem asks for the positive difference, we consider the absolute value, which is 6. This positive difference can be expressed as the fraction 6/1. In this fraction, the numerator m is 6 and the denominator n is 1, which are relatively prime positive integers. Therefore, m + n = 6 + 1 = 7. This reasoning aligns with the previous calculations and ensures that the fraction is in its simplest form.; answer: 7\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent EY3j, round 0, calculating simplified fraction m/n, thinking: The radii of the circles of tangency when the torus is externally tangent to the sphere are r_o = 9 and r_i = 3.
