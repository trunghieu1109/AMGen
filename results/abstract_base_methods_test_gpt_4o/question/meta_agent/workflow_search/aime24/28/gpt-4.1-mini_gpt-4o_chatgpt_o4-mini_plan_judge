Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: The problem involves finding the difference between the radii of tangency circles when a torus is externally tangent to a sphere. The difference r_i - r_o was calculated to be 6, which can be expressed as the fraction 6/1. Here, m = 6 and n = 1 are relatively prime integers, meaning the fraction is already in its simplest form. Therefore, the sum m + n is calculated as 6 + 1 = 7. This matches the results from the related sub-task questions and confirms the correctness of the solution.

proposed answer: Both agents agree that the difference in radii of the circles of tangency, when the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, is 6. This difference is expressed as the fraction 6/1, where m = 6 and n = 1. These integers are relatively prime, and their sum is m + n = 6 + 1 = 7. The problem asks for the sum of m and n, so the final answer should be provided as a single integer, which is 7.
