Question: Find the largest possible real part of \[(75+117i)z+\frac{96+144i}{z}\]where $z$ is a complex number with $|z|=4$.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_1_12
proposed answer: The expression for the real part of the original expression is 540 \cos(\theta + \phi), where \phi is such that \tan(\phi) = -\frac{4}{3}. To maximize this expression, we need \cos(\theta + \phi) = 1, which occurs when \theta + \phi = 2k\pi for some integer k. Therefore, the maximum value of the real part is simply the amplitude of the cosine function, which is 540. This is because the maximum value of \cos(\theta + \phi) is 1, and when it is 1, the expression becomes 540 \times 1 = 540. Thus, the maximum value of the real part is 540.

Answer:The maximum value of the real part is 540.
