Question: Let $\triangle ABC$ have circumcenter $O$ and incenter $I$ with $\overline{IA}\perp\overline{OI}$, circumradius $13$, and inradius $6$. Find $AB\cdot AC$.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_0_16
proposed answer: Both agents have derived the value of AB \cdot AC using the given conditions and known formulas. They used Euler's formula to find OI, and related the area of the triangle to the sides using the circumradius and inradius. The perpendicularity condition and the derived relationships confirm the result. Both agents consistently arrived at the value 168 for AB \cdot AC, and there is no conflicting information. Therefore, the final decision on the numeric value of AB \cdot AC is 168.

Question: Let $\triangle ABC$ have circumcenter $O$ and incenter $I$ with $\overline{IA}\perp\overline{OI}$, circumradius $13$, and inradius $6$. Find $AB\cdot AC$.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_0_16
proposed answer: To determine the correct value of AB · AC, we need to consider the given conditions and the derived formulas. The circumradius R is 13, and the inradius r is 6. The condition IA ⊥ OI implies a specific geometric relationship. Using Euler's formula, OI^2 = R(R - 2r), we find OI^2 = 13(13 - 12) = 13. The perpendicularity condition suggests a specific configuration of the triangle. The formula AB · AC = 4Rr sin(A) is applicable here, considering the given conditions and the relationship between the circumradius, inradius, and the sides of the triangle. Substituting the known values into this formula gives AB · AC = 4 * 13 * 6 = 312. This calculation is consistent with the geometric properties and the given conditions, making 312 the correct value for AB · AC.
