Question: There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\times5$ grid such that: 

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_10_29
proposed answer: To calculate the total number of valid configurations, we need to consider each of the cases identified in Sub-task 5 and count the distinct ways to achieve each configuration. The configurations are based on the number of rows and columns filled with each color, ensuring the grid is fully filled and respecting the indistinguishability of chips. For each configuration, we choose which rows and columns are filled with white chips, and the remaining are filled with black chips. The configurations are: (1) 5 rows and 5 columns with white chips, (2) 4 rows and 4 columns with white chips and 1 row and 1 column with black chips, (3) 3 rows and 3 columns with white chips and 2 rows and 2 columns with black chips, (4) 2 rows and 2 columns with white chips and 3 rows and 3 columns with black chips, (5) 1 row and 1 column with white chips and 4 rows and 4 columns with black chips, (6) 5 rows and 5 columns with black chips. For each configuration, the number of ways to choose the rows and columns is given by the binomial coefficient. For example, for configuration (2), we choose 4 rows out of 5 to be white and 4 columns out of 5 to be white, which gives \( \binom{5}{4} \times \binom{5}{4} = 5 \times 5 = 25 \) ways. Similarly, for configuration (3), we choose 3 rows out of 5 to be white and 3 columns out of 5 to be white, which gives \( \binom{5}{3} \times \binom{5}{3} = 10 \times 10 = 100 \) ways. Summing up the number of ways for each configuration, we get: 1 (for all white) + 25 (for 4 white, 1 black) + 100 (for 3 white, 2 black) + 100 (for 2 white, 3 black) + 25 (for 1 white, 4 black) + 1 (for all black) = 252. Therefore, the total number of valid configurations is 252.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_10_29
proposed answer: The problem involves placing chips on a 5x5 grid such that each row and column has chips of only one color, and any additional chip would violate this condition. From Sub-task 5, we know there are 252 distinct configurations that satisfy these conditions. Each configuration corresponds to a unique way of choosing which rows and columns are white and which are black, ensuring that the chips in the same row and column have the same color. Since the chips are indistinguishable, the number of valid placements is equal to the number of valid configurations. Therefore, the total number of valid chip placements is the same as the number of valid configurations, which is 252.
