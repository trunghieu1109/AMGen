Question: Example(question='In an inactive state, a transcription factor subunit awaits an activation signal from the membrane phosphorylation cascade. Upon phosphorylation on the Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, shuttles into the nucleus, and serves in gene transcription. A missense mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. You observe that a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Which of the following molecular phenotypes is most likely observed in the presence of mutation Y?', choice1='loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype', choice2='protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype', choice3='protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele', choice4='change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Test New Architecture_157
proposed answer: The transcription factor requires dimerization to function properly in gene transcription. Mutation Y, being a dominant-negative mutation in the dimerization domain, disrupts the ability of the transcription factor to form functional dimers. This means that even if a wild-type allele is present, the presence of mutation Y can prevent the formation of a stable and active dimer necessary for transcriptional activity. The dominant-negative effect typically results in the disruption of normal protein interactions, which in this case would prevent the wild-type protein from dimerizing effectively. Therefore, the most plausible molecular phenotype caused by mutation Y would be a loss of protein dimerization, leading to a loss-of-function phenotype. The correct answer should reflect this loss of function caused by the interference of mutation Y with the wild-type protein's ability to dimerize effectively, rather than suggesting a wild-type phenotype, which is incorrect. Thus, the answer is B) 'protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype', as it aligns with the understanding that mutation Y leads to functional impairment due to the dominant-negative effect.
