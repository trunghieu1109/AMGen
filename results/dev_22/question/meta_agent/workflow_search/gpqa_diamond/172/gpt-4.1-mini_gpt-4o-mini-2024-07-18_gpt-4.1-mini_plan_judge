proposed answer: To determine the minimum uncertainty in energy ΔE of the electron, we apply the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which relates the uncertainty in position (Δx) to the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) and subsequently to the uncertainty in energy (ΔE). Given Δx = 0.1 nm (which is 1 x 10^(-10) m), we can calculate Δp using the formula Δp = ħ / Δx, where ħ (reduced Planck's constant) is approximately 1.055 x 10^(-34) J·s. This gives us Δp = (1.055 x 10^(-34) J·s) / (1 x 10^(-10) m) = 1.055 x 10^(-24) kg·m/s. Next, we calculate the momentum p of the electron using p = mv, where m is the mass of the electron (9.11 x 10^(-31) kg) and v is the speed of the electron (2 x 10^8 m/s), yielding p = (9.11 x 10^(-31) kg)(2 x 10^8 m/s) = 1.822 x 10^(-22) kg·m/s. We then use the relationship ΔE ≈ (p/m) * Δp to estimate ΔE. Substituting the values we have, ΔE ≈ (1.822 x 10^(-22) kg·m/s) / (9.11 x 10^(-31) kg) * (1.055 x 10^(-24) kg·m/s) results in ΔE being approximately 1.055 x 10^(-16) J. When comparing this value with the provided options, the closest match is choice C) ~10^(-16) J. This choice is justified as it directly corresponds to our calculated value, making it the most accurate representation of the uncertainty in energy based on the given parameters.
