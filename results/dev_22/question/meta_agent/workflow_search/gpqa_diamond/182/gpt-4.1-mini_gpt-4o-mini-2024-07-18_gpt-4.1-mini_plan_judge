Iteration: Test New Architecture_182
proposed answer: To determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product formed from the reaction of 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid with red phosphorus and excess HI, we analyze the structural changes that occur during the reaction. Initially, the compound has an IHD of 3 due to the presence of a cyclohexene ring (contributing 1) and two double bonds (one from the vinyl group and one from the cyclohexene, each contributing 1). The reaction with red phosphorus and excess HI leads to the reduction of the formyl group (–CHO) to a primary alcohol (–CH2OH) and the carboxylic acid group (–COOH) to another alcohol (–CH2OH). Additionally, the vinyl group (–C=C) and the cyclohexene ring undergo hydrogenation, resulting in the complete saturation of the compound. After these transformations, there are no remaining rings or double bonds, leading to an IHD of 0. This conclusion is consistent across multiple analyses, confirming that the correct answer is C, which corresponds to an IHD of 0, indicating complete saturation of the product after the reaction.

proposed answer: To determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) for the product formed from the reaction of 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid with red phosphorus and excess HI, we analyze the structural features of the compound. The original compound has a cyclohexene ring, which contributes 1 to the IHD due to its double bond, and a vinyl group (C=C), which contributes another 1 to the IHD. Therefore, the total contribution from these unsaturations is 2. The formyl group (–CHO) and the carboxylic acid group (–COOH) are reduced to alkyl iodides, which do not contribute to unsaturation. Thus, the total IHD of the product remains at 3, as it retains the contributions from the ring and the vinyl double bond. This reasoning is consistent and confirms that the computed IHD of 3 is correct, aligning with the analysis of other agents who also concluded an IHD of 3. Therefore, the most accurate choice among the provided options is B) 3.
