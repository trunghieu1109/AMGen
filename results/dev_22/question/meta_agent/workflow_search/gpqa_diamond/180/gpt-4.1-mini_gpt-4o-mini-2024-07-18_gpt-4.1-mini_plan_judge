proposed answer: To determine the ratio of the flux between the two bands of neutrino energies (700-800 keV and 800-900 keV) after the pp-III branch stops, we analyze the contributions of the different solar neutrino production processes. The pp-III branch primarily produces neutrinos in the 800-900 keV range (band 2), while the 700-800 keV range (band 1) receives contributions mainly from the pp-I and pp-II branches. When the pp-III branch is stopped, the flux in band 2 will decrease significantly, while band 1 will still receive contributions from the other branches. This leads us to expect that the ratio of Flux(band 1) to Flux(band 2) will be less than 1, favoring the higher energy band (800-900 keV). Based on the analyses from Sub-task 2 and Sub-task 4, the expected ratio is approximately 0.1 (10^-1), indicating that the flux in the 700-800 keV band is much lower than that in the 800-900 keV band. Therefore, the correct answer choice is A).

proposed answer: To determine the approximate ratio of the flux between the two energy bands (700-800 keV and 800-900 keV) after stopping the pp-III branch, we analyze the contributions of the solar fusion processes to these bands. The pp-III branch is primarily responsible for producing neutrinos in the 800-900 keV band. When this branch stops, the flux in the 800-900 keV band will decrease significantly, while the flux in the 700-800 keV band, which is mainly contributed by the pp-I and pp-II branches, will remain relatively stable. This leads to an expectation that the flux in the 700-800 keV band becomes larger compared to the 800-900 keV band. Based on previous analyses and typical flux ratios observed in neutrino studies, the ratio of flux (band 1) to flux (band 2) is expected to be approximately 0.1 (10^-1), indicating that the flux in the lower energy band is ten times that of the higher energy band after the cessation of the pp-III branch. This conclusion is consistent with the known physics of solar neutrinos and the contributions from each fusion process, confirming that stopping the pp-III branch would cause a significant drop in the flux of the higher energy band while the lower energy band remains largely unchanged. Therefore, the answer is A) 0.1 (10^-1).
