proposed answer: To compute the fraction of maximum power radiated at theta = 30 degrees, we analyze the provided options in the context of the radiation characteristics of an oscillating charge distribution. The maximum power A represents the peak output when the oscillating charge is aligned with the observer's line of sight along the z-axis. The function f describes how this power is distributed over different angles and wavelengths. The choices provided suggest different fractions of the maximum power A that can be radiated at 30 degrees and different dependencies on the wavelength (lambda). Based on the known behavior of radiation from oscillating dipoles, the intensity typically decreases with increasing wavelength, and the fraction of power radiated at specific angles is consistent with theoretical predictions. The analysis from Sub-task 2 indicates that the angular dependence is expected to follow a specific pattern, and the choice that best fits the expected radiation characteristics at 30 degrees is the one that provides a reasonable fraction of maximum power and aligns with known theoretical predictions for dipole radiation. After careful consideration, the option that best fits is A, which suggests a moderate dependency on wavelength and a reasonable fraction of the maximum power radiated at the specified angle. Therefore, I conclude that the answer is A.

proposed answer: To determine the correct choice among the options given, we need to integrate the results from Subtasks 2 and 3. From Subtask 2, we found that the fraction of the maximum radiated power A emitted at theta = 30 degrees is 1/4. This was calculated using the angular distribution function for dipole radiation, where g(30 degrees) = sin^2(30 degrees) = 1/4. Therefore, the angular fraction is confirmed to be 1/4. From Subtask 3, we established that the wavelength dependence of the radiated power per unit solid angle for dipole radiation is f(lambda, theta) ∝ lambda^(-4). This means that the power radiated decreases as the wavelength increases, with a specific dependence on lambda to the power of -4. Now, we need to match these results with the provided choices: 1) 1/2, λ^(-4), 2) 3/4, λ^(-6), 3) 1/4, λ^(-4), 4) 1/4, λ^(-3). The only option that aligns with both our derived angular fraction of 1/4 and the wavelength dependence of λ^(-4) is option 3) 1/4, λ^(-4). Therefore, the correct answer is option C.
