proposed answer: To synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, we need to carefully consider the order of reactions and the directing effects of the substituents introduced at each step. The first step in all sequences is Friedel-Crafts alkylation using tert-butyl chloride and AlCl3, which introduces a tert-butyl group onto the benzene ring. This group is a strong ortho/para director due to its electron-donating nature. The next step involves nitration with HNO3/H2SO4, where the nitro group is likely to be directed to the para position due to steric hindrance from the tert-butyl group, resulting in the desired 3-nitrobenzene derivative. Following this, we need to introduce the ethoxy group. The order of these reactions is crucial; the ethoxy group should be introduced after the nitro group to avoid interference and ensure the final product is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Analyzing the sequences: choice 1 maintains a logical order with minimal risk of interference, while choices 2 and 3 introduce unnecessary steps or do not preserve the correct order of functional group introduction. Choice 4 disrupts the necessary order by placing the introduction of the tert-butyl group after the nitro group. Therefore, choice 1 is the most compatible and logical sequence for achieving the high-yield synthesis of the target compound, as it respects the necessary order of reactions and the directing effects of the substituents introduced at each step.

proposed answer: To synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene, we need to carefully analyze the provided reaction sequences. The first step should be the Friedel-Crafts alkylation using tert-butyl chloride and AlCl3, which introduces the tert-butyl group to the benzene ring, yielding tert-butylbenzene. This group is a strong electron-donating group, which will direct subsequent electrophilic substitutions to the ortho and para positions. The next step involves the introduction of the nitro group using HNO3/H2SO4, which will preferentially add to the ortho position due to steric hindrance from the tert-butyl group, resulting in 2-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. Finally, we need to introduce the ethoxy group. This can be achieved through an electrophilic substitution with an ethyl halide (like EtBr) after generating a suitable leaving group from the nitro compound. The order of these reactions is crucial for achieving the desired product in high yield. The first choice (A) presents a logical sequence that follows this pathway: tert-butyl introduction, nitro group addition, and then ethoxy substitution, ensuring high yield and correct regioselectivity. Other options may introduce groups in a less favorable order or include unnecessary steps that could lead to side reactions, making them less suitable for the target synthesis.
