proposed answer: To determine the uncertainty ΔPz of the operator Pz, we start by using the formula ΔPz = sqrt(⟨Pz²⟩ - ⟨Pz⟩²). From the calculations in Sub-task 4, we have found that ⟨Pz⟩ = 0 and ⟨Pz²⟩ = ħ²/4. Substituting these values into the uncertainty formula gives us ΔPz = sqrt(ħ²/4 - 0) = sqrt(ħ²/4) = ħ/2. This result indicates that the uncertainty in the measurement of Pz when the system is in the specified state is ħ/2. Now, we compare this result with the provided multiple-choice options: A) ħ, B) ħ/2, C) ħ/√2, D) √2ħ. The computed uncertainty of ħ/2 corresponds exactly to option B. Therefore, the correct answer is B.

proposed answer: To determine the uncertainty Delta Pz, we computed it using the formula Delta Pz = sqrt(<Pz^2> - <Pz>^2). From previous calculations, we found <Pz> = 0 and <Pz^2> = (1/2) * hbar^2. Substituting these values into the uncertainty formula gives us Delta Pz = sqrt((1/2) * hbar^2 - (0)^2) = sqrt((1/2) * hbar^2) = (hbar / sqrt(2)). This value is non-negative, confirming the calculation is valid. Now, we compare this result with the given multiple-choice options: A) hbar, B) hbar/2, C) hbar/sqrt{2}, and D) sqrt{2}hbar. The computed uncertainty matches option C, which is hbar/sqrt{2}. The other options do not match our computed uncertainty. Therefore, option C is the only correct choice based on our calculations, confirming that the uncertainty in the measurement of Pz is indeed hbar/sqrt{2}. This conclusion is consistent with the principles of quantum mechanics and the calculations performed, confirming the non-zero uncertainty in the observable Pz.
