proposed answer: The given metric is ds² = 32/(4 - x² - y²)(dx² + dy²), which describes a pseudosphere. To compute the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2, we need to analyze the behavior of the metric as we approach the boundary defined by x² + y² = 4. As we approach this boundary, the term (4 - x² - y²) approaches zero, which causes the conformal factor 32/(4 - x² - y²) to diverge to infinity. This suggests that the area integral, which would be set up over the region where x² + y² < 4, will diverge as we approach the boundary. In polar coordinates, we would express the area element as dA = (32/(4 - r²)) r dr dθ, and integrating this from 0 to 2 for r and 0 to 2π for θ confirms that as r approaches 2, the area becomes infinite. Therefore, the area of the pseudosphere diverges, leading to the conclusion that the area is +∞. This matches the first choice provided, which states that the area is +∞.
