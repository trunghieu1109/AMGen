proposed answer: To determine the correct choice regarding the mass dimension of \kappa and the renormalizability of the theory, we analyze the interaction Lagrangian \mathcal{L}_{int}=\kappa\bar{\psi}\sigma_{\mu\nu}\psi F^{\mu\nu}. The Dirac field \psi has a mass dimension of 3/2, and its conjugate \bar{\psi} also has a mass dimension of 3/2. The field strength tensor F^{\mu\nu} has a mass dimension of 2, while the term \sigma_{\mu\nu} is dimensionless. Therefore, the overall mass dimension of the term \bar{\psi}\sigma_{\mu\nu}\psi F^{\mu\nu} is calculated as (3/2 + 0 + 3/2 + 2) = 5. For the Lagrangian density to have a mass dimension of 4, we set up the equation: 4 = \kappa \cdot 5. Solving for \kappa gives us \kappa = \frac{4}{5}, which indicates that the mass dimension of \kappa is -1. In quantum field theory, a coupling constant with a negative mass dimension is typically associated with non-renormalizable theories. Since the interaction term has a mass dimension of 5, which exceeds the allowed dimension of 4 for renormalizable theories, we conclude that the theory is not renormalizable. This reasoning aligns with the findings from previous analyses and confirms that the mass dimension of \kappa is -1 and the theory is non-renormalizable. Therefore, the correct answer is C.
