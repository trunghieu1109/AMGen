proposed answer: To integrate the analyzed mass spectrometry, IR, and NMR data, we start with the mass spectrometry results. The molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound is 156 g/mol. The additional peak at m/z = 158 (32%) suggests the presence of chlorine, as chlorine has two isotopes (35Cl and 37Cl) that can cause such a pattern. Next, the IR spectrum shows a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1, which is characteristic of O-H stretching, indicating the presence of a hydroxyl group, commonly found in carboxylic acids. The sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 indicates a carbonyl group (C=O), which is typical for carboxylic acids or ketones. The 1H NMR data reveals a singlet at 11.0 ppm, indicative of a carboxylic acid proton, and two doublets at 8.02 ppm (2H) and 7.72 ppm (2H), suggesting a disubstituted aromatic ring with a symmetrical substitution pattern. This analysis strongly suggests that the compound is a carboxylic acid with a para-substituted aromatic ring, which aligns with 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The molecular weight, functional groups, and spectral data all support this conclusion. The other options do not match as closely with the spectral data provided, making 4-chlorobenzoic acid the most reasonable structural suggestion for the unidentified drug.
