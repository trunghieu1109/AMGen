proposed answer: In electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions, the nature of the substituents on the benzene ring plays a crucial role in determining the yield of the para-isomer. The order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer is influenced by whether the substituents are activating or deactivating and their directing effects. Based on the analysis: 1) C6H5-CH3 (methyl) is an activating group that enhances electron density and directs substitution to ortho and para positions, leading to a high yield of para-isomer. 2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (ethoxy) is also activating but less effective than methyl, still favoring ortho and para positions. 3) C6H5-Cl (chloro) is a deactivating group that withdraws electron density, leading to a lower yield of para-isomer but still directs to ortho and para positions. 4) C6H5-NO2 (nitro) is a strongly deactivating group that directs to meta positions, resulting in a very low yield of para-isomer. 5) C6H5-C2H5 (ethyl) behaves similarly to methyl, promoting substitution at ortho and para positions. 6) C6H5-COOH (carboxylic acid) is a deactivating group that directs to meta positions, contributing the least to the yield of the para-isomer. Therefore, the expected order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer is: 4 (NO2) < 6 (COOH) < 3 (Cl) < 5 (C2H5) < 1 (CH3) < 2 (COOC2H5), which corresponds to choice C. This reflects the overall reactivity and regioselectivity based on the electronic effects of the substituents.

proposed answer: To determine the correct sequence of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield, we must analyze the electronic and steric effects of each substituent on the benzene ring. The substituents can be categorized as activating or deactivating, which influences their directing effects during electrophilic substitution reactions. Activating groups such as –CH3 (methyl) and –C2H5 (ethyl) increase electron density on the benzene ring, favoring para substitution due to less steric hindrance compared to ortho substitution. On the other hand, deactivating groups like –NO2 (nitro) and –COOH (carboxy) withdraw electron density, leading to lower reactivity and often directing substitution to the meta position, which results in lower para yields. The –Cl (chloro) group is a deactivator but still allows for para substitution, although it is less favorable than with activating groups. Based on these principles, the expected order of increasing para-isomer yield is: 4 (NO2) < 6 (COOH) < 2 (COOC2H5) < 3 (Cl) < 1 (CH3) < 5 (C2H5). This aligns with choice B, which reflects the influence of electronic effects and steric hindrance on the regioselectivity of bromination. Therefore, the correct answer is B.
