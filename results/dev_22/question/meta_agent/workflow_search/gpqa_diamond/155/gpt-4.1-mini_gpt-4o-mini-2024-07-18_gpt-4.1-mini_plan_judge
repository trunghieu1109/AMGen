proposed answer: In the reactions involving (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene, both compounds undergo epoxidation with mCPBA, leading to the formation of different diols upon treatment with aqueous acid. The (E)-isomer and (Z)-isomer yield distinct diols due to their stereochemistry. Each isomer produces two diastereomers, resulting in a total of four distinct products. In a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column, diastereomers can be resolved as separate peaks, leading to the observation of 2 peaks (one for each diastereomer). In contrast, a chiral HPLC column can separate enantiomers, allowing for the observation of all four distinct products as separate peaks. Therefore, the chemist will observe 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC, confirming that the correct answer is B. This conclusion is consistent with the understanding of stereochemical relationships and chromatographic behavior, where diastereomers are resolved in achiral columns and enantiomers are resolved in chiral columns.

proposed answer: In Subtask 3, we predicted that the combined product mixture from (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene would yield 2 peaks on a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column. This is because the products from (E)-oct-4-ene, which are diastereomers, co-elute as one peak, and the meso product from (Z)-oct-4-ene also counts as one peak, resulting in a total of 2 peaks. In Subtask 4, we found that the same product mixture on a chiral HPLC column would yield 3 peaks. The two enantiomers from (E)-oct-4-ene can be resolved into two distinct peaks, and the meso compound from (Z)-oct-4-ene counts as one peak, leading to a total of 3 peaks. Therefore, when integrating the results from both subtasks, we conclude that the expected number of peaks in the standard HPLC is 2 and in the chiral HPLC is 3. This aligns with the stereochemical analysis and the behavior of the products on the respective columns, confirming the accuracy of our predictions and ensuring consistency in counting the peaks.
