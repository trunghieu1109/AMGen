proposed answer: To determine the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator H = ε σ · n, we recognize that σ represents the Pauli matrices, which have eigenvalues of ±1. The Hamiltonian scales these eigenvalues by the constant ε, which has dimensions of energy. Therefore, the eigenvalues of H are ±ε. Among the provided choices, the first option '+ ε, -ε' directly corresponds to these derived eigenvalues. The other options involve factors of ħ or different scaling, which do not match the derived eigenvalues. Thus, the correct answer is A) + ε, -ε.
