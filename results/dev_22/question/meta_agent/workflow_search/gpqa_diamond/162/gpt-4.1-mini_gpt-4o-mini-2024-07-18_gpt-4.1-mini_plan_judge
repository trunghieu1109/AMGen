Iteration: Test New Architecture_162
proposed answer: To determine the minimum volume of 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required to dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)3, we first calculate the moles of Fe(OH)3. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is approximately 106.87 g/mol, so the number of moles in 0.1 g is calculated as 0.1 g / 106.87 g/mol = 0.000935 moles. The balanced reaction shows that 1 mole of Fe(OH)3 reacts with 3 moles of HCl, thus we need 0.000935 moles * 3 = 0.002805 moles of HCl. The volume of 0.1 M HCl needed is then calculated using the formula Volume = moles / concentration = 0.002805 moles / 0.1 M = 0.02805 L, which is 28.05 cm3. This volume is necessary for complete neutralization. After the reaction, the pH of the solution can be estimated based on the strong acid concentration. Since we have used exactly the amount of HCl needed to neutralize Fe(OH)3, the resulting pH will be low, around 2.04, which corresponds to the first choice provided. Therefore, the correct pair of minimum acid volume and pH is 28.05 cm3 and pH 2.04, which matches choice A.

proposed answer: To determine the minimum volume of 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required to completely dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)3, we first calculate the number of moles of Fe(OH)3. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is approximately 106.87 g/mol, so 0.1 g corresponds to about 0.000935 moles (0.1 g / 106.87 g/mol). The dissolution reaction is Fe(OH)3 (s) ⇌ Fe3+ (aq) + 3OH- (aq). This means that dissolving 0.000935 moles of Fe(OH)3 will produce 0.000935 moles of Fe3+ and 0.002805 moles of OH- (since 3 moles of OH- are produced for every mole of Fe(OH)3). To neutralize these OH- ions, we need an equivalent amount of H+ ions from the strong acid. Since the acid is 0.1 M, we can calculate the volume required to provide 0.002805 moles of H+: Volume (L) = moles / concentration = 0.002805 moles / 0.1 M = 0.02805 L, or 28.05 cm3. Additionally, we must consider the K_sp of Fe(OH)3, which is approximately 4.0 x 10^-38, indicating low solubility. The acid not only neutralizes the OH- ions but also shifts the equilibrium to allow more Fe(OH)3 to dissolve, and the hydrolysis of Fe3+ ions will contribute to the acidity of the solution, further affecting the pH. After careful analysis, the closest match for the calculated volume of acid and resulting pH is choice A, which indicates 28.05 cm3 of acid leads to a pH of 2.04. Therefore, the answer is A. However, I must reflect on the pH calculation, as the hydrolysis of Fe3+ ions may lead to a lower pH than calculated. The pH of 2.04 may not fully account for the additional H+ ions from Fe3+ hydrolysis, which could suggest a more acidic solution than indicated. Therefore, while the volume of acid is correct, the pH may need to be reassessed based on hydrolysis contributions. Nonetheless, based on the choices provided, A remains the best fit for the volume and pH pair.
