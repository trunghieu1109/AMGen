Question: Example(question='Imagine an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ having a small spherical cavity inside. The centre of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the centre of the spherical conductor. The radius of the cavity is $r$, and $r<R$. Now consider a small amount of positive charge $+q$ is somehow placed somewhere inside the cavity. What is the magnitude of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at a point P (outside the spherical conductor) of distance $L$ from the centre of the spherical conductor? Note, the distance of the point P from the centre of the cavity is $l$. Here, l, L > R. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\\theta$\n', choice1='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n', choice2='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n', choice3='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\n', choice4='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: In this scenario, we have a spherical conductor with a cavity containing a positive charge +q. The conductor is initially uncharged, which means that when the charge +q is placed inside the cavity, it induces a negative charge on the inner surface of the cavity and a positive charge of +q on the outer surface of the conductor to maintain overall neutrality. According to Gauss's law, the electric field outside the conductor only depends on the total charge enclosed, which in this case is +q due to the positive charge inside the cavity. The electric field at point P, which is outside the conductor, can be calculated using the formula for the electric field due to a point charge, E = k * q / r^2. Given that point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor (where L > R), we can treat the charge +q as if it were located at the center of the conductor for the purpose of calculating the electric field at point P. The other expressions provided in the choices involve distances that are either influenced by the cavity's position or are not relevant for the electric field calculation at point P. Therefore, the most physically consistent and mathematically plausible expression for the electric field at point P is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q/L²), which corresponds to choice D. This reasoning is supported by the principles of electrostatics and the properties of conductors in electrostatic equilibrium. Thus, the final answer is D.
