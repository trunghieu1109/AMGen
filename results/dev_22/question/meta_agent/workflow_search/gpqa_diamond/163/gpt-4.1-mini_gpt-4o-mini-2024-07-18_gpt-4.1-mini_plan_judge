proposed answer: To evaluate the computed mass ratio factor from Sub-task 4, we need to analyze the total masses of system_1 and system_2. We found that system_1 has a total mass of approximately 1.5 solar masses and system_2 has a total mass of approximately 1.6667 solar masses. The ratio of these masses is calculated as 1.5 / 1.6667, which gives us approximately 0.9. This indicates that system_1 is less massive than system_2, specifically about 0.9 times the mass of system_2. The provided multiple-choice options are ~0.4, ~0.7, ~0.6, and ~1.2. Among these options, the closest approximation to 0.9 is ~0.7. Therefore, I select option B as it is the most accurate representation of the computed mass ratio factor, reflecting that system_1 is less massive than system_2. This choice is justified as it aligns with the calculations and the context of the question.

proposed answer: To determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we first need to compute the total masses of both systems using Kepler's third law. The periods for system_1 and system_2 are 2 years and 1 year, respectively. The radial velocity amplitudes for system_1 are 10 km/s and 5 km/s, while for system_2 they are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. We convert the periods into seconds: 2 years = 2 * 365.25 * 24 * 3600 seconds and 1 year = 365.25 * 24 * 3600 seconds. Using the formula for the semi-major axis 'a' based on the radial velocity amplitudes and the period, we can calculate 'a' for both systems. Then, applying Kepler's third law, we find the total mass for each system. The mass ratio is computed as M1/M2. Previous calculations suggest that this ratio is approximately 0.6, indicating that system_1 is less massive than system_2. Therefore, the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2 is less than 1, leading us to conclude that the answer is C (~ 0.6). This is consistent with the physical expectations that the mass ratio should reflect the relative masses based on the observed data.
