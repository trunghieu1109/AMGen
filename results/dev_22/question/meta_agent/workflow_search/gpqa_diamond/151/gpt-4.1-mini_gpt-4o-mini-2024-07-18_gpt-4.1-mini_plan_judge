Question: Example(question='You identified a new quorum-sensing peptide in the bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus. You are highly interested if its role in intercellular communication is conserved among the eukaryotes. You treat yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with the peptide and interestingly observe the formation of the shmoo. You want to learn about the proteome of the active chromatin in the shmoo and recover it by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. The least of proteins from which complex below will you observe in your assay?', choice1='pre-initiation complex', choice2='pre-replication complex', choice3='enhancer protein complex', choice4='nucleosome histone complex', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Test New Architecture_151
proposed answer: In the context of the experimental conditions involving Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the observation of shmoo formation, we need to evaluate the relevance of the listed protein complexes to active chromatin. The pre-initiation complex (PIC) is crucial for initiating transcription, which is highly relevant during shmoo formation as it involves gene expression in response to mating signals. The enhancer protein complex also enhances transcriptional activity, making it significant in this context. The nucleosome histone complex, while primarily involved in DNA packaging, also plays a role in regulating access to DNA and thus influences transcription, linking it to active chromatin. However, the pre-replication complex (PRC) is primarily associated with preparing DNA for replication during the S phase and does not directly contribute to transcriptional activity, especially during the shmoo formation phase. Therefore, when considering which protein complex is least likely to be observed in an assay focused on active chromatin during shmoo formation, the pre-replication complex is the least relevant. This conclusion is supported by the understanding that shmoo formation is a transcriptionally active process, while the PRC is not involved in transcription. Thus, the answer is B) pre-replication complex.
