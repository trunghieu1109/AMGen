proposed answer: The Mott-Gurney equation is specifically applicable to single-carrier devices operating under space-charge-limited current (SCLC) conditions. For the equation to hold, the device must be trap-free, meaning there are no localized states that can capture charge carriers, which would affect mobility. Additionally, there should be no significant carrier injection barrier, allowing for a straightforward relationship between voltage and current. Among the provided choices, 'choice1' states that the Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current. This aligns perfectly with the fundamental assumptions of the Mott-Gurney equation. The other choices introduce conditions that do not conform to these requirements: 'choice2' mentions an Ohmic contact, which is not necessary for the Mott-Gurney equation; 'choice3' refers to a two-carrier device, which is outside the scope of the equation; and 'choice4' discusses a Schottky contact, which implies a barrier that contradicts the assumptions of the Mott-Gurney equation. Therefore, 'choice1' is the only correct statement that accurately describes the conditions under which the Mott-Gurney equation is valid.
