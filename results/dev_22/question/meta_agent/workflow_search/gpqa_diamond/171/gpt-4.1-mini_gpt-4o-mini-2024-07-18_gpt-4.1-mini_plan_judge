Question: Example(question='Two stars are being studied. It has been observed that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2. In fact, the energy difference between the considered energy levels was determined to be approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J. Assuming that the stellar photospheres are in LTE, which of these equations for the effective temperatures of the stars (T_1 and T_2) is correct?', choice1='ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]\n', choice2='ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]\n', choice3='ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n', choice4='ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: To evaluate the candidate equations for the effective temperatures T_1 and T_2 based on the excitation levels of iron in the two stars, we start from the derived relationship obtained from the Boltzmann distribution. The ratio of populations of excited states can be expressed as P2/P1 = exp(-ΔE/kT2) / exp(-ΔE/kT1). Given that the population in star_1 (P1) is twice that in star_2 (P2), we can write the equation as 2 = exp(-ΔE/kT2) / exp(-ΔE/kT1). Rearranging this gives us 2 = exp(ΔE/kT1 - ΔE/kT2). Taking the natural logarithm of both sides results in ln(2) = ΔE/k * (1/T1 - 1/T2). This can be rearranged to show that ln(2) = (ΔE/k) * (T2 - T1) / (T1 * T2). The derived equation indicates that the natural logarithm of the excitation ratio is equal to the energy difference divided by the product of the temperatures. Now, we need to compare this derived equation with the provided choices. Choice D states ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)], which matches our derived relationship when we consider the sign difference (as T1 - T2 is the negative of T2 - T1). Therefore, choice D correctly represents the relationship between T_1 and T_2. The other choices do not align with the derived equation, making D the correct answer.
