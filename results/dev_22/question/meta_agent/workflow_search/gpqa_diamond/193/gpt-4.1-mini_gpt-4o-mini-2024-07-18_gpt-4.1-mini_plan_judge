proposed answer: To determine the correct partition function Z for the system of three spins, we first analyze the energy levels based on the interactions of the spins. The distinct energy levels identified are: E = -3J (with degeneracy 2), E = -J (with degeneracy 3), E = J (with degeneracy 3), and E = 3J (with degeneracy 1). The corresponding Boltzmann factors for these energy levels are e^{3Jβ}, e^{Jβ}, e^{-Jβ}, and e^{-3Jβ}, respectively. The contributions to the partition function Z from each energy level are calculated as follows: from E = -3J: 2 * e^{3Jβ} = 2e^{3Jβ}; from E = -J: 3 * e^{Jβ} = 3e^{Jβ}; from E = J: 3 * e^{-Jβ} = 3e^{-Jβ}; from E = 3J: 1 * e^{-3Jβ} = e^{-3Jβ}. Summing these contributions gives us Z = 2e^{3Jβ} + 3e^{Jβ} + 3e^{-Jβ} + e^{-3Jβ}. Now, we compare this result with the provided choices. The choices are: 1) Z = 2 e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ), 2) Z = 2e^(2Jβ) + 6e^(-2Jβ), 3) Z = 6e^(2Jβ) + 2e^(-2Jβ), 4) Z = 2 e^(-3Jβ) + 6e^(Jβ). None of the choices match the computed Z exactly, but choice 1 has a similar structure with e^(3Jβ) and e^(-Jβ), making it the closest match. Therefore, I conclude that the best choice is A, while noting the discrepancies between the computed Z and the provided options, which suggests a potential issue with the problem setup or the choices given.
