proposed answer: To calculate the probability of measuring the eigenvalue 0, we need to find the squared norm of the projection of the normalized state vector onto the eigenspace associated with the eigenvalue 0. The eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 is v = (1, 0, -1), which spans the eigenspace. The normalized state vector is given as (-1/√6, 2/√6, 1/√6). We first calculate the projection of the normalized state vector onto the eigenspace spanned by the eigenvector v. The projection formula is proj_v(u) = (u · v / v · v) * v. We first compute the dot product u · v: u · v = (-1/√6)(1) + (2/√6)(0) + (1/√6)(-1) = -1/√6 - 1/√6 = -2/√6. Next, we compute the dot product v · v: v · v = 1^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2 = 2. Now we can calculate the projection: proj_v(u) = (-2/√6 / 2) * (1, 0, -1) = (-1/√6)(1, 0, -1) = (-1/√6, 0, 1/√6). The squared norm of this projection is given by ||proj_v(u)||^2 = ((-1/√6)^2 + 0^2 + (1/√6)^2) = (1/6 + 0 + 1/6) = 2/6 = 1/3. Therefore, the probability of measuring the eigenvalue 0 is 1/3.
