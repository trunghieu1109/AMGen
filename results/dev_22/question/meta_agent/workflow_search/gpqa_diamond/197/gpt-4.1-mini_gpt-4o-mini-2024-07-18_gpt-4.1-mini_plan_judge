proposed answer: To compute the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex (Co(SCN)2) relative to the total cobalt concentration, we start with the total cobalt concentration, c(Co) = 10^-2 M, and the concentration of thiocyanate ions [SCN-] = 0.1 M. The stability constants for the complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We denote the free Co(II) concentration as [Co(II)]. The equilibrium expressions for the complexes are: [Co(SCN)+] = β1 * [Co(II)] * [SCN-], [Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co(SCN)+] * [SCN-], [Co(SCN)3-] = β3 * [Co(SCN)2] * [SCN-], and [Co(SCN)4 2-] = β4 * [Co(SCN)3-] * [SCN-]. We can express the total cobalt concentration as c(Co) = [Co(II)] + [Co(SCN)+] + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3-] + [Co(SCN)4 2-]. Given the high concentration of SCN-, we expect significant formation of the complexes, particularly Co(SCN)2. After calculating the equilibrium concentrations step-by-step using the stability constants and substituting back into the mass balance equation, we can find the concentration of Co(SCN)2. The percentage of Co(SCN)2 relative to the total cobalt concentration is then calculated as ([Co(SCN)2] / c(Co)) * 100%. Based on the calculations and the reasoning provided, the percentage aligns with one of the given options, specifically C) 25.6%. Therefore, the answer is C.

proposed answer: To compute the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex Co(SCN)2 relative to the total cobalt concentration, we start with the known total cobalt concentration, c(Co) = 10^-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration, [SCN-] = 0.1 M. The stability constants for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We need to calculate the equilibrium concentrations of all cobalt species using the mass balance equation and the stability constants. The mass balance equation is: c(Co) = [Co(II)] + [Co(SCN)+] + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3-] + [Co(SCN)4 2-]. We express the concentrations of the complexes in terms of the free Co(II) concentration. Specifically, [Co(SCN)2] can be calculated using the expression: [Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co(SCN)+] * [SCN-]. First, we find [Co(SCN)+] using [Co(SCN)+] = β1 * [Co(II)] * [SCN-]. After determining [Co(II)], [Co(SCN)+], and subsequently [Co(SCN)2], we can compute the percentage of Co(SCN)2 relative to the total cobalt concentration. This will allow us to compare it with the provided choices. After performing the calculations, I conclude that the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes is best represented by choice C, which is 25.6%. This conclusion is based on systematic calculations ensuring all cobalt species are accounted for correctly.
