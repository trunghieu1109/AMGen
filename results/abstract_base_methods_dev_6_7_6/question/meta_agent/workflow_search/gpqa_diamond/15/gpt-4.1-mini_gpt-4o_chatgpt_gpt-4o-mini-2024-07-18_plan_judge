Question: Example(question='How many of the following compounds will exhibit optical activity?\n\n(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene\n(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol\n1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one', choice1='3', choice2='4', choice3='2', choice4='5', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_2_15
proposed answer: All agents have determined that the number of optically active compounds is 3. The multiple-choice options provided are: choice1='3', choice2='4', choice3='2', choice4='5'. The number 3 corresponds to choice1, which is option A. Therefore, the correct letter choice is A.
