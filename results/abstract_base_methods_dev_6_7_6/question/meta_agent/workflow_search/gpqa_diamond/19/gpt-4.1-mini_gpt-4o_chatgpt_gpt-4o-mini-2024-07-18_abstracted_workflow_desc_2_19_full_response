The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons: This implies that the interaction does not involve collective effects or correlations between nucleons, treating each nucleon as an independent entity. 2. The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon: This suggests that the interaction can 'see' through the nucleus and only affects the chosen nucleon, ignoring the presence of other nucleons. 3. The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic: This means that the internal structure of the nucleon is simplified, assuming that the quarks move slowly compared to the speed of light, which affects the internal dynamics. 4. The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces: This implies that the nucleon behaves as if it is free, not influenced by the nuclear potential or forces binding it to the nucleus.

The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons: This assumption implies that the interaction is localized to a single nucleon, ignoring any collective effects or correlations with other nucleons.

It implies that the nucleus does not significantly alter the interaction. 3. The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic: This assumption simplifies the internal structure of the nucleon by assuming that the quarks move slowly compared to the speed of light, which affects the internal dynamics and makes calculations more tractable. 4.
