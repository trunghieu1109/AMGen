Question: Example(question='All the following statements about the molecular biology of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2) are correct except\n\n\n', choice1='Programmed ribosomal frameshifting creates two polyproteins near to 5` end of the genome by moving back by 1 nucleotide with the help of slippery nucleotides, and pseudoknot. The SARS-CoV-2 programmed ribosomal frameshifting mostly has the same conformation as the SARS-CoV programmed ribosomal frameshifting.', choice2='SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14-ExoN operates as heterodimers in a mismatch repair mechanism. The N-terminal ExoN domain of nsp14 could bind to nsp10 making an active exonuclease complex that prevents the breakdown of dsRNA. ', choice3='SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a has the ability to trigger caspase-8 activation/cleavage, without affecting the expression levels of Bcl-2. Caspase-8 activation is recognized as a characteristic feature of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway via death receptors, while Bcl-2 plays a crucial role in initiating the mitochondrial pathway. This suggests that the mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a induces apoptosis is via the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.\n', choice4='The rate of frameshifting in vitro is linearly correlated with the number of conformations that a pseudoknot can adopt. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Programmed -1 Frameshift Signals show two conformations when under tension, similar to other pseudoknots that induce comparable frameshifting rates. ', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: The incorrect statement identified in the sub-tasks is related to the nsp10/nsp14-ExoN complex, which was evaluated in Sub-task 3. This statement inaccurately describes the role of the nsp10/nsp14-ExoN complex in SARS-CoV-2, claiming it operates in a mismatch repair mechanism and prevents dsRNA breakdown, which is not consistent with its known function in RNA proofreading during replication. This incorrect statement corresponds to choice2 in the original question. In a typical multiple-choice format, choice2 maps to option B). Therefore, the incorrect statement is option B).
