The energy for a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator is given by E_n = (n + 1/2)ℏω. For a two-dimensional oscillator, the total energy is the sum of the energies in the x and y directions. From the sub-tasks, we have the effective frequencies ω_x = sqrt(4k/m) and ω_y = sqrt(k/m). Therefore, the energy spectrum is E = (n_x + 1/2)ℏω_x + (n_y + 1/2)ℏω_y. Substituting the frequencies, we get E = (n_x + 1/2)ℏsqrt(4k/m) + (n_y + 1/2)ℏsqrt(k/m). Simplifying, this results in E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ℏsqrt(k/m).
