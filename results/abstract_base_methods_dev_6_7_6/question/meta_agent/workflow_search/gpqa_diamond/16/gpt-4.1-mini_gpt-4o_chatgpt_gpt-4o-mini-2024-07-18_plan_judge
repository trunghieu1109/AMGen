Question: Example(question='What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex (we assume that the pH is ideal, T = 25 Â°C). KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10.', choice1='1.0x10^-2 M ', choice2='5.0x10^-3 M', choice3='6.3x10^-7 M', choice4='2.0x10^-2 M ', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_17_16
proposed answer: All agents have consistently derived the concentration of free Ca2+ ions as 6.3x10^-7 M from the equilibrium calculations. This value matches exactly with option C) in the multiple-choice answers provided in the original question. Therefore, the correct answer choice is C).
