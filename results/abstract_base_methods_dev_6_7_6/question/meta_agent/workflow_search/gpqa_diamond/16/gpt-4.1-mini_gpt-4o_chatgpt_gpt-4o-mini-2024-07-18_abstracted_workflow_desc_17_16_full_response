At equilibrium, we assume that x is the concentration of Ca²⁺ ions that dissociate from the complex. Due to the 1:1 stoichiometry of the dissociation, the concentration of EDTA⁴⁻ ions will also be x. Therefore, the concentration of the remaining Ca-EDTA complex at equilibrium will be 0.02 - x. Using the equilibrium expression KCa-EDTA = [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻] / [Ca-EDTA], we substitute the equilibrium concentrations: KCa-EDTA = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x).
