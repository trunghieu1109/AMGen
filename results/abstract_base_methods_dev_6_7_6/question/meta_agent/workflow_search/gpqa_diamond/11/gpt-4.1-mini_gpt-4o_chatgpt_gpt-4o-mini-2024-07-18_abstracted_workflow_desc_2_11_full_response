Initially, the energy is the rest mass energy of Pi(+), which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy is the sum of the kinetic energy and rest mass energy of mu(+) and the energy of the neutrino. Let E_mu be the total energy of mu(+), which includes its rest mass energy (105.7 MeV) and its kinetic energy (KE_mu). The energy of the neutrino (E_nu) is equal to its momentum since it is massless. By conservation of energy: 139.6 MeV = E_mu + E_nu. By conservation of momentum, the momentum of mu(+) (p_mu) equals the momentum of the neutrino (p_nu), so p_mu = p_nu.

Initially, the Pi(+) is at rest, so its total energy is its rest mass energy, E_initial = 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy is the sum of the kinetic energy (KE) and rest mass energy of the mu(+) and the energy of the neutrino. Let E_mu = KE_mu + m_mu*c^2 be the total energy of the mu(+), where m_mu*c^2 = 105.7 MeV is its rest mass energy. Let E_nu = p_nu*c be the energy of the neutrino, which is massless, so its energy is equal to its momentum times the speed of light.
