Question: Example(question='Find KE of product particles in,\nPi(+) = mu(+) + nu\nhere Pi(+) is stationary.\nRest mass of Pi(+) &  mu(+) is 139.6 MeV & 105.7 MeV respectively.', choice1='2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV', choice2='7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV', choice3='3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV', choice4='4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV', correct_index=4)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_2_11
proposed answer: The computed kinetic energy values are 4.12 MeV for the mu(+) and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino. These values match the choice provided in the original question under choice4, which is '4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV'. Therefore, the correct choice corresponding to the calculated values is choice4.
