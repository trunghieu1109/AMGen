Question: Example(question='The universe is filled with the Cosmic Microwave Background. Consider the annihilation of high energy \\gamma-rays with a photon from the CMB Radiation into electron-positron, i.e. $\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$. From what energy \\gamma-rays would have their lifetimes in the universe limited by this process? Knowing that the average photon energy of the CMB is $10^{-3}eV$.', choice1='9.5*1e4 GeV', choice2='1.8*1e5 GeV', choice3='2.6*1e5 GeV', choice4='3.9*1e5 GeV', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_2_6
proposed answer: All agents have calculated the threshold energy for the gamma-ray photon required for pair production with a CMB photon to be 2.61*10^5 GeV. This value matches exactly with the multiple-choice option 2.6*1e5 GeV, which corresponds to option C. Since all agents agree on this calculation and the match with option C, it is reasonable to conclude that option C is the best matching choice.
