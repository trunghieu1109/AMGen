Question: Example(question='Two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10^-9 sec and 10^-8 sec, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which one of the following options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?\n', choice1='10^-9 eV', choice2='10^-11 eV', choice3='10^-8 eV\n', choice4='10^-4 eV', correct_index=4)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_2_0
proposed answer: The minimum energy difference required to clearly resolve the two energy levels, as determined in sub-task 3, is approximately 3.62 x 10^-7 eV. To achieve clear resolution, the energy difference must exceed this value. Among the given options, 10^-9 eV, 10^-11 eV, 10^-8 eV, and 10^-4 eV, only 10^-4 eV is greater than 3.62 x 10^-7 eV. Therefore, 10^-4 eV is the only option that allows for clear resolution of the two energy levels according to the energy-time uncertainty principle. The other options are smaller than the calculated minimum required energy difference and would not suffice for resolution.
