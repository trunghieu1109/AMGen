The state vector |psi> is (0.5, sqrt(3)/2). The operator matrix is [[10, 5], [5, -10]].

The state vector |psi> is given as (0.5, sqrt(3)/2). The operator matrix is [[10, 5], [5, -10]]. We first apply the operator to the state vector: (10*sigma_z + 5*sigma_x) |psi> = [[10, 5], [5, -10]] * [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T. This results in a new vector: [10*0.5 + 5*(sqrt(3)/2), 5*0.5 - 10*(sqrt(3)/2)] = [5 + (5sqrt(3)/2), 2.5 - 5sqrt(3)]. Next, we compute the inner product <psi|[resulting vector]>. The conjugate transpose of |psi> is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]. So, <psi|[resulting vector]> = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] * [5 + (5sqrt(3)/2), 2.5 - 5sqrt(3)]^T = 0.5*(5 + (5sqrt(3)/2)) + (sqrt(3)/2)*(2.5 - 5sqrt(3)).

The state vector |psi> is (0.5, sqrt(3)/2) from sub-task 1. The operator matrix is [[10, 5], [5, -10]] from sub-task 3. First, we apply the operator to |psi>: (10*sigma_z + 5*sigma_x) |psi> = [[10, 5], [5, -10]] * [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]. This results in a new vector: [10*0.5 + 5*(sqrt(3)/2), 5*0.5 - 10*(sqrt(3)/2)] = [5 + (5sqrt(3)/2), 2.5 - 5sqrt(3)]. Next, we compute the inner product <psi| with this vector: <psi| = (0.5, sqrt(3)/2). The inner product is (0.5)*(5 + (5sqrt(3)/2)) + (sqrt(3)/2)*(2.5 - 5sqrt(3)). Simplifying, we get 0.5*5 + 0.5*(5sqrt(3)/2) + sqrt(3)/2*2.5 - sqrt(3)/2*5sqrt(3). This simplifies to 2.5 + (5sqrt(3)/4) + (2.5sqrt(3)/2) - 15/2. Combining terms, we have: 2.5 - 7.5 + (5sqrt(3)/4) + (5sqrt(3)/4) = -5 + (10sqrt(3)/4). Since sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732, we have (10*1.732)/4 = 4.33.
