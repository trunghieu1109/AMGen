Question: Example(question='Calculate the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator $\\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\\hbar/2$. Given the $X-$component, $P_x$ of the operator $P$ as $\\hbar/2$ times a 2 by 2 square matrix having elements in the first row as $(0 1)$, and that in the second row as $(1, 0)$. The $Y-$component, $P_y$ of the operator is given by the product of $\\hbar/2$ and a 2 by 2 square matrix having elements in the first row as $(0, -i)$, and that in the second row as $(i, 0)$. Finally, the $Z-$component, $P_z$ of the operator is given by the product of $\\hbar/2$  and another 2 by 2 square matrix having elements in the first row as $(1, 0)$, and that in the second row as $(0, -1)$.

proposed answer: The derived normalized eigenvector from Sub-task 4 is \( (\cos(\theta/2), \sin (\theta/2)) \). We need to compare this result with the given multiple-choice options to find the correct match. Choice 1: \( (\cos(\theta), e^{i\phi}\sin (\theta)) \) does not match the derived eigenvector, as the cosine and sine functions are not divided by 2. Choice 2: \( (\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar) \) involves \( \hbar \) and specific numerical factors, which do not appear in the derived eigenvector. Choice 3: \( (\cos(\theta/2), \sin (\theta/2)) \) matches exactly with the derived eigenvector from Sub-task 4. Choice 4: \( (\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin (\theta/2)) \) involves \( \hbar \) and numerical factors, differing from the derived eigenvector. Therefore, the correct choice is Choice 3.
