Question: Example(question='In a parallel universe where a magnet can have an isolated North or South pole, Maxwell’s equations look different. But, specifically, which of those equations are different?', choice1='The one related to the divergence of the magnetic field. ', choice2='The ones related to the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field.', choice3='The ones related to the circulation of the electric field and the divergence of the magnetic field.  ', choice4='The one related to the circulation of the magnetic field and the flux of the electric field. ', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: All agents agree that the presence of magnetic monopoles would alter two of Maxwell's equations: Gauss's law for magnetism and Ampère's law. Gauss's law for magnetism would change to account for magnetic charge density, and Ampère's law would include a magnetic current density term. These changes are reflected in choice 3, which corresponds to the circulation of the magnetic field (Ampère's law) and the divergence of the magnetic field (Gauss's law for magnetism). Therefore, the correct multiple-choice answer is option C.
