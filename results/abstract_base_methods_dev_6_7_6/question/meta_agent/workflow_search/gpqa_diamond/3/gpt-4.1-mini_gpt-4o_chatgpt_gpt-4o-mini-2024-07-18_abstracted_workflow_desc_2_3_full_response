Each of these equations has a specific physical meaning: \n1) Gauss's law for magnetism (∇·B = 0) states that the divergence of the magnetic field is zero, which implies that there are no 'sources' or 'sinks' of magnetic field lines, meaning magnetic monopoles do not exist in classical electromagnetism.

If magnetic monopoles existed, this equation would have a non-zero divergence, indicating a source or sink of magnetic field lines. 2) Faraday's law of induction (∇×E = -∂B/∂t) describes how a time-varying magnetic field induces an electric field. This relationship is unaffected by the presence or absence of magnetic monopoles. 3) Ampère's law with Maxwell's addition (∇×H = J + ∂D/∂t) relates the curl of the magnetic field to electric current and the displacement current.
