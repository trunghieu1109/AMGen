Question: Rectangles $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are drawn such that $D,E,C,F$ are collinear. Also, $A,D,H,G$ all lie on a circle. If $BC=16$,$AB=107$,$FG=17$, and $EF=184$, what is the length of $CE$?

proposed answer: To find the length CE, we start by placing rectangle ABCD on the coordinate plane for clarity and convenience. Let point A be at the origin (0,0). Since AB = 107 and BC = 16, and ABCD is a rectangle, the coordinates of the other points are: B at (107,0), C at (107,16), and D at (0,16). Points D, E, C, and F are collinear and lie on the same horizontal line y=16. Let E be at (x_E,16). Given EF = 184, point F is at (x_E + 184,16). Rectangle EFGH has side FG = 17, so points G and H lie 17 units vertically above F and E respectively, at y=33. Thus, H is at (x_E,33) and G at (x_E + 184,33).

The concyclicity condition states that points A(0,0), D(0,16), H(x_E,33), and G(x_E + 184,33) lie on the same circle. Since A and D share the same x-coordinate (0), the center of the circle must lie on a vertical line x = h. The y-coordinate of the center k is the midpoint of A and D's y-coordinates, so k = (0 + 16)/2 = 8.

For points H and G to lie on the same circle, their distances to the center must be equal. Since H and G have the same y-coordinate (33), the center's x-coordinate h must be the midpoint of their x-coordinates: h = (x_E + (x_E + 184))/2 = x_E + 92.

The radius squared r^2 can be calculated using point A: r^2 = (h - 0)^2 + (k - 0)^2 = (x_E + 92)^2 + 8^2 = (x_E + 92)^2 + 64.

Using point H: r^2 = (x_E - h)^2 + (33 - k)^2 = (x_E - (x_E + 92))^2 + (33 - 8)^2 = (-92)^2 + 25^2 = 8464 + 625 = 9089.

Equating the two expressions for r^2 gives: (x_E + 92)^2 + 64 = 9089, so (x_E + 92)^2 = 9025.

Taking the square root: x_E + 92 = Â±95. Since x_E must be positive and less than 107 (because C is at 107), we take the positive root: x_E + 92 = 95, so x_E = 3.

Finally, the length CE is the horizontal distance between C(107,16) and E(3,16), which is 107 - 3 = 104.

This solution is consistent with all given conditions: the side lengths of rectangles ABCD and EFGH, the collinearity of points D, E, C, F, and the concyclicity of points A, D, H, G. The step-by-step coordinate placement, use of midpoint and distance formulas, and equating radius expressions ensure a rigorous and complete solution.
