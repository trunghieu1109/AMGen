Question: Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.

proposed answer: From the previous sub-task, the length AP was found to be AP = 1391/11 after simplification. The original fraction was 4173/33, which was simplified by dividing numerator and denominator by 3. Since 1391 and 11 share no common factors other than 1, the fraction is in lowest terms. To find m + n, we sum the numerator and denominator: 1391 + 11 = 1402. This confirms that the fraction is reduced and the sum is correctly computed.
