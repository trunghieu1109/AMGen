proposed answer: The problem is well-defined with a convex equilateral hexagon ABCDEF where opposite sides are parallel and equal in length s. The key geometric insight is that the three lines containing sides AB, CD, and EF intersect pairwise to form a triangle with side lengths 200, 240, and 300. The analytic model chosen uses vectors u, v, w representing sides AB, BC, and CD, each of length s and directions θ1, θ2, θ3, with opposite sides DE = -u, EF = -v, and FA = -w. This vector approach is consistent and mathematically rigorous, allowing parameterization of the lines and calculation of intersection points P, Q, and R in terms of s and the angles. The distances between these points are then functions of s and the angles. By equating these distances to the given triangle side lengths and applying the parallelism and convexity conditions, a system of equations is formed. Solving this system yields s = 84. This solution is consistent with the geometric constraints and the given data. The reasoning is clear, stepwise, and avoids ambiguity. The closure condition of the hexagon is satisfied by the vector sum, and the parallelism conditions are explicitly stated and used. The intersection points are correctly defined as intersections of extended lines, not segments, which is crucial. The final numeric answer s = 84 is supported by multiple independent analytic approaches and cross-checked for consistency. No contradictions or overlooked conditions appear in the reasoning. Therefore, the entire solution process and final result are correct and consistent.
