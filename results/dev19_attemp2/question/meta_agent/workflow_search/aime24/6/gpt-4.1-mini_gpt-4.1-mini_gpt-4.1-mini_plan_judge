Question: Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.

proposed answer: To verify that the found radius squared r^2 = 657/64 is indeed the smallest radius that can contain all boxes in the set B, we proceed as follows: 1. Constraints and Setup: The set B consists of rectangular boxes with surface area S = 54 and volume V = 23. The surface area constraint is 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54, so xy + yz + zx = 27. The volume constraint is xyz = 23. 2. Radius and Diagonal Relation: The smallest sphere containing a box must have radius at least half the space diagonal of the box. The space diagonal squared is d^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2, so r^2 = d^2 / 4. 3. Parameterization: To find the maximum diagonal under the constraints, we consider the symmetric case x = y = a and z = b. This is justified because for fixed sum of products and fixed product, the diagonal is maximized when two sides are equal (by symmetry and inequality arguments). 4. Using the constraints: From volume, b = 23 / a^2. From surface area, a^2 + 2ab = 27. Substituting b, we get a^2 + 2a(23 / a^2) = 27, which simplifies to a^3 - 27a + 46 = 0. 5. Solving the cubic: a = 2 is a root, giving b = 23 / 4 = 5.75. 6. Diagonal squared: d^2 = 2a^2 + b^2 = 2*(2^2) + (5.75)^2 = 8 + 33.0625 = 41.0625 = 657/16. 7. Radius squared: r^2 = d^2 / 4 = (657/16) / 4 = 657/64. 8. Minimality and Boundary Cases: - The chosen a and b satisfy the constraints exactly. - The diagonal is maximized at this point, so any other box with the same constraints will have a diagonal less than or equal to this. - Since the radius must be at least half the diagonal, this radius is minimal to contain all boxes. - Checking boundary cases (e.g., when one side tends to zero or becomes very large) violates the volume or surface area constraints, so no larger diagonal arises. 9. No larger radius is necessary because the diagonal cannot be larger under the given constraints. 10. No smaller radius suffices because the box with dimensions (2, 2, 5.75) fits exactly inside a sphere of radius sqrt(657/64), and any smaller radius would not contain this box. Therefore, the solution is verified, minimal, and consistent with all constraints and boundary conditions.
