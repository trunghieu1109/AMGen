Question: Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.

proposed answer: We are counting lattice paths from (0,0) to (8,8) consisting of 8 right (R) and 8 up (U) steps, with exactly four direction changes. Each direction change switches the path from R to U or U to R, so the path is divided into 5 segments alternating between R and U moves. The number of segments is 5, and the number of direction changes is 4, which matches the problem statement. The segments alternate starting either with R or with U. Thus, there are two cases: (1) starting with R, so the segments are R-U-R-U-R (3 R segments and 2 U segments), and (2) starting with U, so the segments are U-R-U-R-U (3 U segments and 2 R segments). Each segment length is a positive integer, and the sum of R segments is 8, and the sum of U segments is 8. We need to count the number of ways to split 8 into 3 positive parts (for the 3 segments of one direction) and 8 into 2 positive parts (for the 2 segments of the other direction), and vice versa for the other starting direction. The number of compositions of 8 into 3 positive parts is C(7,2) = 21, and into 2 positive parts is C(7,1) = 7. For starting with R, the number of pairs of compositions is 21 (R segments) * 7 (U segments) = 147. For starting with U, the number of pairs is 7 (R segments) * 21 (U segments) = 147. Each pair corresponds to exactly one unique path because the order of segments is fixed and the steps within each segment are consecutive and identical, so no further permutations are possible. Therefore, the total number of paths with exactly four direction changes is 147 + 147 = 294. To ensure no overlap or omission, note that paths starting with R and paths starting with U are disjoint sets because the first step direction is different. Also, the compositions cover all possible positive segment lengths summing to 8 for each direction, so no paths are missed. As a consistency check, the total number of paths from (0,0) to (8,8) is C(16,8) = 12870, and 294 is a reasonable subset for paths with exactly four direction changes. The reasoning aligns with the problem constraints and combinatorial principles, confirming the correctness of the final count.
