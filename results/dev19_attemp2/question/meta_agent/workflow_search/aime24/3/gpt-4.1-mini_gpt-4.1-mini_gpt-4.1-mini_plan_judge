Question: Define $f(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{4}|$. Find the number of intersections of the graphs of \[y=4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \quad\text{ and }\quad x=4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))).\]

proposed answer: The system involves the equations y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) where f and g are defined using nested absolute values, and the inner trigonometric functions sin(2πx) and cos(3πy) have fundamental periods 1 and 2/3 respectively. Because of these periodicities, the behavior of the system can be fully understood by analyzing it on the fundamental domain x in [0,1) and y in [0, 2/3). Within this domain, the functions f and g, composed with absolute values, create piecewise linear functions with breakpoints at specific values (1/4, 1/2, 3/4) of the absolute value arguments. This piecewise linearity allows the domain to be partitioned into finitely many linear segments. On each pair of segments, the system reduces to a linear system that can be solved exactly, yielding a finite number of intersection points within the fundamental domain. Due to the periodicity of the sine and cosine functions, these intersection points repeat across the entire plane in a lattice pattern formed by translations of the fundamental domain by integer multiples of 1 in x and 2/3 in y. Additionally, the functions are even in their inner arguments because of the absolute values, which implies symmetry and ensures no additional intersection points exist outside these periodic repetitions. This symmetry and periodicity guarantee that the infinite set of intersection points is structured and non-ambiguous, avoiding double counting. Therefore, the total number of intersection points over the entire real plane is countably infinite, arranged as an infinite lattice generated by the finite set of intersection points found in the fundamental domain. This conclusion is consistent with the properties of the functions and the system, and it aligns with the analyses and opinions of multiple agents. Hence, the final verified answer is that the system has infinitely many intersection points on the real plane, arranged periodically with a finite number of intersection points per fundamental domain.
