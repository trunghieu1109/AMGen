Question: Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.

proposed answer: We are given the following information: total residents = 900, all own candy hearts (C), so C = 900. Sets D, G, S have sizes 195, 367, and 562 respectively. Let x4 = |D ∩ G ∩ S| be the number of residents owning all four items (candy hearts plus D, G, S). We also know x2 = 437 (own exactly two items = candy hearts + exactly one of D, G, S) and x3 = 234 (own exactly three items = candy hearts + exactly two of D, G, S). Let x1 be the number owning exactly one item (candy hearts only). The total is x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 = 900.

From the inclusion-exclusion principle and the problem's setup, we have:
1) x2 = (|D| + |G| + |S|) - 2(|D ∩ G| + |G ∩ S| + |S ∩ D|) + 3x4 = 437
2) x3 = (|D ∩ G| + |G ∩ S| + |S ∩ D|) - 3x4 = 234

Let A = |D ∩ G| + |G ∩ S| + |S ∩ D|.

From equation (2): A - 3x4 = 234 => A = 234 + 3x4.

Substitute A into equation (1):
(195 + 367 + 562) - 2A + 3x4 = 437
1124 - 2(234 + 3x4) + 3x4 = 437
1124 - 468 - 6x4 + 3x4 = 437
656 - 3x4 = 437
-3x4 = 437 - 656 = -219
x4 = 73

So, 73 residents own all four items.

Check A:
A = 234 + 3*73 = 234 + 219 = 453

Now find x1:
x1 = 900 - (x2 + x3 + x4) = 900 - (437 + 234 + 73) = 900 - 744 = 156

Interpretation:
- 156 residents own only candy hearts.
- 437 own candy hearts plus exactly one of D, G, S.
- 234 own candy hearts plus exactly two of D, G, S.
- 73 own candy hearts plus all three of D, G, S.

This solution is consistent with the problem constraints and the universal ownership of candy hearts. The number 73 is reasonable given the sizes of the sets and the counts of residents owning exactly two and three items. The algebraic steps carefully use inclusion-exclusion and the problem's definitions, avoiding misinterpretations of the universal candy hearts ownership.
