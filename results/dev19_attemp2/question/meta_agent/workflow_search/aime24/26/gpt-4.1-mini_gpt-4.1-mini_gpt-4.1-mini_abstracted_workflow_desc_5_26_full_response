Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Final Decision Agent IFbj', content="The problem requires finding the sum of elements in the set A such that the sum of 2^(a-1) over all a in A equals 2024. This means expressing 2024 as a sum of distinct powers of two, where each power corresponds to 2^(a-1) for some a in A. The key is to find the binary representation of 2024 and identify the positions of the set bits, which correspond to the exponents a-1. Adding 1 to each exponent gives the elements of A. \n\nStep 1: Convert 2024 to binary. Repeated division by 2 yields the binary number 111111001000 (from MSB to LSB). \n\nStep 2: Identify the set bits (bits equal to 1) and their positions (starting from 0 at the least significant bit):\n- bit 3 = 1\n- bit 6 = 1\n- bit 7 = 1\n- bit 8 = 1\n- bit 9 = 1\n- bit 10 = 1\n- bit 11 = 1\n\nStep 3: Each set bit at position k corresponds to an element a = k + 1 in A.

The binary representation clearly shows the bit at position 11 is set, corresponding to a = 12, which must be included. Therefore, the correct sum is 61.
