Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Final Decision Agent IFbj', content="The problem requires finding the sum of elements in the set A such that the sum of 2^(a-1) over all a in A equals 2024. This means expressing 2024 as a sum of distinct powers of two, where each power corresponds to 2^(a-1) for some a in A.
