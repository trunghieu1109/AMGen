Question: A list of positive integers has the following properties:
$\bullet$ The sum of the items in the list is $30$.
$\bullet$ The unique mode of the list is $9$.
$\bullet$ The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.
Find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_5_22
proposed answer: The verified candidate list from Sub-task 4 is [5, 7, 9, 9]. We need to compute the sum of the squares of all items in this list. Step-by-step calculation: 5 squared is 25, 7 squared is 49, 9 squared is 81. Since 9 appears twice, we have two 81s. Summing these: 25 + 49 + 81 + 81 = 236. This calculation is straightforward and uses the correct list as verified previously, ensuring no errors in arithmetic or list selection.
