Question: Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.

proposed answer: The problem involves finding the inradius r of a tetrahedron with given edge lengths. The inradius r is given by the formula r = (3 * volume) / surface area. From previous sub-tasks, the volume V was found to be 36. The surface area S was found to be 12√89, which is consistent with the given edges since the largest edges are √89, making the surface area involving √89 plausible. Calculating r: r = (3 * 36) / (12√89) = 108 / (12√89) = 9 / √89. Rationalizing the denominator gives r = (9√89) / 89. Here, m = 9, n = 89, and p = 89. The integers m and p are relatively prime (since 9 and 89 share no common factors), and n = 89 is prime, so it is square-free. Therefore, the simplified inradius expression is (9√89)/89. The sum m + n + p = 9 + 89 + 89 = 187. This matches the consistent and simplified expression found previously, confirming the correctness of the arithmetic and simplifications.
