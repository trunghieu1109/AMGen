Question: Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). Then \(OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\).

proposed answer: The problem involves finding the unique point C on segment AB such that C lies on the boundary of the coverage region defined by the family F of unit segments PQ. The coverage region is given by the astroid X^{2/3} + Y^{2/3} = 1. The point C is parametrized by t in (0,1) as C = (1/2 - t/2, t * sqrt(3)/2). Substituting into the boundary condition yields ( (1 - t)/2 )^{2/3} + ( t * sqrt(3)/2 )^{2/3} = 1. Multiplying both sides by 2^{2/3} gives (1 - t)^{2/3} + 3^{1/3} t^{2/3} = 2^{2/3}. By testing t = 3/4, we find that it satisfies this equation exactly, as shown by the algebraic manipulation in the detailed reasoning. Then, the squared distance OC^2 is computed as ((1 - t)^2 + 3 t^2)/4. Substituting t = 3/4 gives OC^2 = 7/16. The integers 7 and 16 are relatively prime, so p = 7 and q = 16, and p + q = 23. The alternative solution giving 97 is based on a more complicated algebraic manipulation that introduces irrational expressions and does not match the neat exact verification for t = 3/4. The solution with OC^2 = 7/16 and p + q = 23 is consistent, exact, and verified by substitution, making it the correct and most reliable answer.
