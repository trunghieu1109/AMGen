Question: Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.

proposed answer: To determine the number of positive integers n ≤ 2024 for which Bob has a guaranteed winning strategy, we rely on the combinatorial game theory analysis of the game where players can remove either 1 or 4 tokens. The key concept is the classification of positions into P-positions (losing positions for the player to move) and N-positions (winning positions for the player to move). Alice moves first, so Bob can guarantee a win if, after Alice's first move, Bob faces a P-position regardless of Alice's choice. Alice can remove either 1 or 4 tokens, so the positions reachable after her first move are n-1 and n-4 (if n-4 ≥ 0). For Bob to guarantee a win, both n-1 and n-4 must be P-positions. If either is an N-position, Alice can move there and have a winning strategy, so Bob cannot guarantee a win. This condition is necessary and sufficient. Using the previously computed P-positions from subtask 1, we check for each n from 1 to 2024 whether both n-1 and n-4 are in the P-positions set (considering n-4 only if n-4 ≥ 0). Counting all such n yields the number of initial positions where Bob has a guaranteed winning strategy. Previous attempts gave counts of 404, 505, and 506. The count 404 is significantly lower and inconsistent with the theory. The counts 505 and 506 are close, differing by 1, likely due to boundary conditions or off-by-one errors. Given the detailed reasoning and the standard combinatorial game theory approach, the count 506 is the most consistent and correct. Therefore, the final answer is 506.
