Question: Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations:
\[\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}\]\[\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}\]\[\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}\]
Then the value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: We start with the values a = log2(x) = -7/24, b = log2(y) = -3/8, and c = log2(z) = -5/12, which were derived from the given system of logarithmic equations. The expression we want to evaluate is |log2(x^4 y^3 z^2)|. Using logarithm properties, this is |4*log2(x) + 3*log2(y) + 2*log2(z)| = |4a + 3b + 2c|. Substituting the values, we get 4*(-7/24) + 3*(-3/8) + 2*(-5/12). Calculating each term: 4*(-7/24) = -28/24 = -7/6, 3*(-3/8) = -9/8, and 2*(-5/12) = -10/12 = -5/6. To add these fractions, we find a common denominator, which is 24. Converting each term: -7/6 = -28/24, -9/8 = -27/24, and -5/6 = -20/24. Summing these gives (-28 - 27 - 20)/24 = -75/24. Taking the absolute value results in 75/24. Simplifying by dividing numerator and denominator by 3 yields 25/8. Since 25 and 8 are relatively prime, the fraction is in simplest form. Therefore, the value of |log2(x^4 y^3 z^2)| is 25/8. The problem asks for m + n where the fraction is m/n, so m = 25 and n = 8, giving m + n = 33. This step-by-step calculation confirms the fraction is correctly reduced and the sum is accurate.
