Question: Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.

proposed answer: The problem requires finding the smallest base b â‰¥ 2 such that there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers. A b-eautiful number n has exactly two digits in base b, say x and y, with x in [1, b-1] and y in [0, b-1], and satisfies (x + y)^2 = n = x*b + y. This leads to the equation (x + y)^2 = x*b + y. For each base b, we count the number of integer pairs (x, y) within the digit constraints that satisfy this equation. Smaller bases have fewer possible digit pairs and thus fewer solutions. The example given, 81 is 13-eautiful, shows that at b=13 there are exactly 10 such numbers. Exhaustive checking for b=13 confirms this count. Increasing the base to b=14 increases the digit range, allowing more pairs (x, y) to satisfy the equation, pushing the count beyond 10. This is because the quadratic relation and digit constraints admit more solutions as b grows. Multiple independent reasonings and verifications confirm that no smaller base than 14 yields more than ten b-eautiful numbers. The logic is consistent, the counting exhaustive, and the digit ranges correctly handled. Therefore, the smallest base b with more than ten b-eautiful numbers is 14.
