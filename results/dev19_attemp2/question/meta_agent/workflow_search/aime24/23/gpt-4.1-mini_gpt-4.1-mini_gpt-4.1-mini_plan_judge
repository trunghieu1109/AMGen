Question: Find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid so that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is $999$, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is $99$. The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$.
\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\ \hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\ \hline \end{array}\]

proposed answer: The problem requires counting the number of ways to fill a 2x3 grid with digits 0-9 such that the sum of the two numbers formed by the rows equals 999, and the sum of the three numbers formed by the columns equals 99. Let the top row digits be (a,b,c) and the bottom row digits be (d,e,f). The constraints translate to two equations: (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999 and (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99. By grouping terms, we find that a + d = 9, b + e = 9, c + f = 9, and the sum of all digits is 27. Using the column sum equation, substituting d = 9 - a, e = 9 - b, f = 9 - c, we get 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99, which simplifies to 10X + Y = 99 where X = a + b + c and Y = d + e + f. Since X + Y = 27, substituting Y = 27 - X gives 10X + 27 - X = 99, or 9X = 72, so X = 8 and Y = 19. Therefore, (a,b,c) must be digits summing to 8, and (d,e,f) are their complements to 9, summing to 19. Counting the number of triples (a,b,c) with digits 0-9 summing to 8 is a standard stars-and-bars problem with no upper bound violations since 8 â‰¤ 9. The number of such triples is C(10,2) = 45. Each such triple uniquely determines (d,e,f) = (9 - a, 9 - b, 9 - c), which are valid digits summing to 19. This satisfies all constraints. Edge cases and the example given confirm validity. Alternative reasoning and inclusion-exclusion confirm no solutions are missed or invalid solutions counted. Hence, the total number of valid digit assignments is 45, and this count is verified and final.
