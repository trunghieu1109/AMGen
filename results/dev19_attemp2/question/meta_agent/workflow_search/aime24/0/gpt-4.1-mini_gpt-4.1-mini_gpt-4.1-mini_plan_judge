Question: Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.

proposed answer: From the previous sub-tasks, we have established that Aya's walking speed s is 2.5 km/h and the coffee shop time t is 24 minutes. We need to find the total time Aya takes when walking at speed s + 0.5 km/h, which is 3.0 km/h. The total distance of the walk is 9 km. First, calculate the walking time at 3.0 km/h: walking time = distance / speed = 9 / 3.0 = 3 hours. Convert this walking time into minutes: 3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes. The coffee shop time t is already given in minutes as 24 minutes. The total time is the sum of walking time and coffee shop time: 180 + 24 = 204 minutes. This calculation carefully converts all units to minutes and sums walking and coffee times correctly, ensuring no unit conversion errors or inconsistencies. Multiple agents have independently arrived at the same total time of 204 minutes, confirming the consistency and correctness of this result. Therefore, the most consistent and correct total time Aya takes, including the coffee shop stop, when walking at 3.0 km/h is 204 minutes.
