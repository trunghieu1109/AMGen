Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: From the previous sub-task, we found that the difference r_i - r_o is 5, which can be expressed as the fraction 5/1. Here, m = 5 and n = 1, and these are relatively prime positive integers. The problem asks for the sum m + n, which is 5 + 1 = 6. This result is consistent with the problem's conditions and the previous calculations. The values of r_i and r_o were derived from the geometry of the torus and sphere, and the difference was simplified correctly. There are no contradictions or errors in the arithmetic or logic leading to this final answer. Therefore, the final answer m + n = 6 is confirmed and correct.
