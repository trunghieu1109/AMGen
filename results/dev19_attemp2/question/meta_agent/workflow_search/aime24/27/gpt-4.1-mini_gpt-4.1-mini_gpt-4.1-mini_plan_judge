Question: Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_4_27
proposed answer: The number N identified from the previous subtask is 5694. To find Q and R, we divide N by 1000. Dividing 5694 by 1000, the quotient Q is the integer part of the division, which is 5, and the remainder R is what is left after subtracting 5*1000 from 5694, which is 694. Finally, we calculate Q + R = 5 + 694 = 699. This arithmetic is straightforward and confirms the final answer for the subtask.
