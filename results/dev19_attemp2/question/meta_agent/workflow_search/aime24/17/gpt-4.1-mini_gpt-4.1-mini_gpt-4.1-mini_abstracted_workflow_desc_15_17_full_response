The counting method respects this by considering permutations and classifying solutions into categories based on equality and zero variables, ensuring no double counting or omissions. 3) Consistency with combinatorial identities: The number of solutions for the zero-variable case matches the expected count from solving quadratic equations and considering permutations. 4) Algebraic consistency: The polynomial constraint is rewritten as 100*S2 - S3 = 2,000,000, which simplifies the problem and is used consistently across all steps. 5) Logical completeness: The classification into four exhaustive and mutually exclusive categories ensures all possible triples are counted without overlap. 6) Computational feasibility: The method reduces the search space by leveraging symmetry and algebraic simplifications, making enumeration practical and reliable.

From previous subtasks, the polynomial constraint can be rewritten as 100 * S2 - S3 = 2,000,000, where S2 = ab + bc + ca and S3 = abc. The classification of solutions into four categories—(1) all equal, (2) one zero variable, (3) two equal variables, and (4) all distinct variables—provides a natural and exhaustive framework for systematic enumeration.\n\nStep 1: All equal variables (a=b=c). Since a+b+c=300, this implies a=b=c=100. Substituting into the polynomial constraint confirms it satisfies the condition exactly. This yields exactly one solution.\n\nStep 2: One zero variable (e.g., c=0). Then a+b=300 and S3=0, so the polynomial constraint reduces to 100*ab=2,000,000, giving ab=20,000. Solving a+b=300 and ab=20,000 yields integer pairs (100,200) and (200,100). Considering zero in each coordinate position and permutations, there are 6 solutions total.\n\nStep 3: Two equal variables and one distinct (a=b=x, c=y). The sum constraint is 2x + y = 300. The polynomial constraint becomes 100(x^2 + 2xy) - x^2 y = 2,000,000. For each integer x from 0 to 150 (since 2x ≤ 300), compute y=300-2x and check if the polynomial constraint holds exactly. Each valid (x,x,y) corresponds to 3 permutations if x ≠ y, or 1 if x=y.\n\nStep 4: All distinct positive variables. This is the most complex case. The constraints are symmetric and nonlinear. To count solutions efficiently, iterate over ordered triples a ≤ b ≤ c with a+b+c=300, compute S2 and S3, and check if 100*S2 - S3 = 2,000,000. Count valid triples and multiply by 6 to account for permutations. This approach leverages symmetry to reduce search space and can be implemented computationally.\n\nSummary: The counting method is to handle each classification separately, using algebraic simplifications to reduce complexity and computational checks where necessary.

The elementary symmetric sums S1 = a + b + c, S2 = ab + bc + ca, and S3 = abc are natural tools to simplify symmetric polynomial expressions. The given polynomial is a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b, which can be grouped as a^2(b + c) + b^2(a + c) + c^2(a + b). Since b + c = S1 - a, and similarly for others, the expression becomes a^2(S1 - a) + b^2(S1 - b) + c^2(S1 - c) = S1(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) - (a^3 + b^3 + c^3). Using known identities, a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = S1^2 - 2S2 and a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = S1^3 - 3S1S2 + 3S3, substituting these yields S1(S1^2 - 2S2) - (S1^3 - 3S1S2 + 3S3) = S1^3 - 2S1S2 - S1^3 + 3S1S2 - 3S3 = S1S2 - 3S3. Since the problem states a + b + c = 300, S1 = 300, so the polynomial constraint simplifies to 300 * S2 - 3 * S3. This re-expression is the most consistent and useful because it leverages symmetry, reduces complexity, and directly relates the polynomial to the elementary symmetric sums, which are easier to handle algebraically and combinatorially.

To analyze it effectively, we use the elementary symmetric polynomials: S1 = a + b + c, S2 = ab + bc + ca, and S3 = abc. Grouping the terms, the polynomial can be rewritten as a^2(b + c) + b^2(a + c) + c^2(a + b). Since b + c = S1 - a, and similarly for the others, this becomes a^2(S1 - a) + b^2(S1 - b) + c^2(S1 - c) = S1(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) - (a^3 + b^3 + c^3). Using known identities, a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = S1^2 - 2S2 and a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = S1^3 - 3S1S2 + 3S3, substituting these yields S1(S1^2 - 2S2) - (S1^3 - 3S1S2 + 3S3) = S1^3 - 2S1S2 - S1^3 + 3S1S2 - 3S3 = S1S2 - 3S3. Given the linear constraint a + b + c = 300, we have S1 = 300, so the polynomial constraint simplifies to 300 * S2 - 3 * S3. The problem states this polynomial equals 6,000,000, so 300 * S2 - 3 * S3 = 6,000,000, or equivalently 100 * S2 - S3 = 2,000,000. This relationship directly links the polynomial constraint to the symmetric sums S2 and S3, with S1 fixed by the linear constraint. This reduces the problem from analyzing three variables directly to studying integer triples (a,b,c) with fixed sum 300 whose pairwise products and triple product satisfy this linear relation. This approach leverages symmetry and well-known polynomial identities, clarifies the restrictions on (a,b,c), and provides a clear algebraic framework for further combinatorial or algebraic analysis. It also confirms consistency with all other agents' analyses, making it the most natural and effective way to understand the problem constraints.; answer - The polynomial constraint a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b can be expressed as (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc. Given the linear constraint a + b + c = 300, denote S1 = 300, S2 = ab + bc + ca, and S3 = abc. The polynomial constraint then becomes 300 * S2 - 3 * S3 = 6,000,000, or equivalently 100 * S2 - S3 = 2,000,000. This expression links the polynomial constraint directly to the elementary symmetric sums S2 and S3 under the fixed sum constraint, clarifying that the triples (a,b,c) must satisfy this linear relation between S2 and S3 while summing to 300. This reduces the problem to finding nonnegative integer triples (a,b,c) with sum 300 such that their symmetric sums satisfy 100 * S2 - S3 = 2,000,000, providing a clear and manageable algebraic condition for further analysis.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - The problem involves finding nonnegative integer triples (a,b,c) summing to 300 and satisfying the polynomial constraint a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000. From previous analysis, this polynomial can be expressed as 300 * S2 - 3 * S3 = 6,000,000, or equivalently 100 * S2 - S3 = 2,000,000, where S2 = ab + bc + ca and S3 = abc. Given the symmetry and nonnegativity, the classification of solutions is naturally based on equality relations among a,b,c and the presence of zeros. Step 1: Consider all equal variables (a = b = c). Since a + b + c = 300, this implies a = 100. Substituting, we find the polynomial constraint holds exactly, so (100,100,100) is a solution. Step 2: Consider one variable zero, say c=0. Then a + b = 300 and S3 = 0. The polynomial constraint reduces to 100 * ab = 2,000,000, so ab = 20,000. Solving a + b = 300 and ab = 20,000 yields integer solutions (100,200) and (200,100). Thus, triples like (100,200,0) and permutations are solutions. Step 3: Consider two equal variables and one distinct (a = b = x, c = y). Then 2x + y = 300, and the polynomial constraint becomes 100(x^2 + 2xy) - x^2 y = 2,000,000. This cubic relation can be analyzed for integer solutions with x,y ≥ 0. Step 4: Consider all distinct variables, all positive. The polynomial constraint 100 * S2 - S3 = 2,000,000 with a + b + c = 300 must hold. This is the most general and complex case, requiring further analysis or computational search. Step 5: Two zeros case is excluded since it leads to zero polynomial value, not matching 6,000,000. This classification respects symmetry, nonnegativity, and the polynomial and sum constraints, and clearly delineates the effect of zero values and equality relations among variables. It is consistent with all previous detailed analyses and provides a structured framework for further solution enumeration or proof. Therefore, the most consistent classification of solutions is: (1) all equal; (2) one zero variable; (3) two equal variables; (4) all distinct variables, with the polynomial constraint linking S2 and S3 in each case.; answer - {'Classification of solutions (a,b,c) based on equality and inequality relations:': {'1.

We can write the sum as: a^2(b+c) + b^2(a+c) + c^2(a+b).

We can try to regroup the terms to use symmetric sums of a, b, c. The elementary symmetric sums are: S1 = a + b + c, S2 = ab + bc + ca, and S3 = abc. Since the expression is symmetric and homogeneous of degree 3, it can be expressed in terms of S1, S2, and S3.

Notice that this expression is symmetric in a, b, c and is homogeneous of degree 3. To re-express it in terms of symmetric sums, we start by considering the elementary symmetric sums: S1 = a + b + c, S2 = ab + bc + ca, and S3 = abc. We want to express the given polynomial in terms of S1, S2, and possibly S3. First, observe that a^2b + a^2c = a^2(b + c), and similarly for other terms. So the sum is a^2(b + c) + b^2(a + c) + c^2(a + b). Since b + c = S1 - a, and similarly for others, the expression becomes: a^2(S1 - a) + b^2(S1 - b) + c^2(S1 - c) = S1(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) - (a^3 + b^3 + c^3). Next, we express a^2 + b^2 + c^2 and a^3 + b^3 + c^3 in terms of S1, S2, and S3. We know a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = S1^2 - 2S2. Also, a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = S1^3 - 3S1S2 + 3S3 (by the Newton's identities). Therefore, the original polynomial equals S1(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) - (a^3 + b^3 + c^3) = S1(S1^2 - 2S2) - (S1^3 - 3S1S2 + 3S3) = S1^3 - 2S1S2 - S1^3 + 3S1S2 - 3S3 = (S1S2) - 3S3. Since S1 = a + b + c = 300 (given), the polynomial simplifies to 300 * S2 - 3 * S3. Thus, the constraint a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000 can be rewritten as 300 * S2 - 3 * S3 = 6,000,000.

Using known identities: a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = S1^2 - 2S2 and a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = S1^3 - 3S1S2 + 3S3, we substitute to get S1(S1^2 - 2S2) - (S1^3 - 3S1S2 + 3S3) = S1^3 - 2S1S2 - S1^3 + 3S1S2 - 3S3 = S1S2 - 3S3. Since the linear constraint is a + b + c = 300, we have S1 = 300, so the polynomial expression simplifies to 300 * S2 - 3 * S3. This relationship clearly ties the polynomial constraint to the symmetric sums S2 and S3, which represent pairwise products and the triple product of (a,b,c), respectively. The linear constraint fixes S1, so the polynomial constraint restricts possible values of S2 and S3. This framework reduces the problem from dealing with three variables directly to analyzing integer solutions (a,b,c) through their symmetric sums subject to the given numerical conditions. Other agents' solutions confirm this approach as consistent and effective, as it leverages symmetry, simplifies the polynomial constraint, and clarifies the restrictions on (a,b,c) in terms of well-understood symmetric polynomials.

Let S1 = a + b + c, S2 = ab + bc + ca, and S3 = abc. Since the expression is symmetric and homogeneous of degree 3, consider grouping terms as a^2(b+c) + b^2(a+c) + c^2(a+b). Note that b + c = S1 - a, and similarly for others, so the expression becomes a^2(S1 - a) + b^2(S1 - b) + c^2(S1 - c) = S1(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) - (a^3 + b^3 + c^3). Using known identities: a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = S1^2 - 2S2 and a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = S1^3 - 3S1S2 + 3S3, substituting these gives S1(S1^2 - 2S2) - (S1^3 - 3S1S2 + 3S3) = S1^3 - 2S1S2 - S1^3 + 3S1S2 - 3S3 = S1S2 - 3S3. Given the linear constraint a + b + c = 300, we have S1 = 300, so the polynomial simplifies to 300 * S2 - 3 * S3. This expression links the polynomial constraint directly to the elementary symmetric sums S2 and S3, which are symmetric and easier to analyze. The linear constraint fixes S1, so the problem reduces to finding nonnegative integer triples (a,b,c) with fixed S1=300 such that 300*S2 - 3*S3 = 6,000,000. This relationship clarifies that the polynomial constraint restricts the possible values of S2 and S3, thus constraining the product and pairwise sums of (a,b,c). Considering other agents' solutions, this simplification is consistent and the most natural way to handle the problem, enabling algebraic and combinatorial approaches to count the valid triples. Therefore, the polynomial expression can be fully and usefully expressed as (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc, and with the linear constraint a + b + c = 300, the polynomial equals 300*S2 - 3*S3, imposing a relation between S2 and S3 that characterizes the solution set (a,b,c).; answer: (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 300 * S2 - 3 * S3, where S2 = ab + bc + ca and S3 = abc with the constraint a + b + c = 300\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent Z0zg, round 0, analyzing polynomial and sum constraint, thinking: Starting from the simplified polynomial expression a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc, we note that the linear constraint is a + b + c = 300. Denote S1 = a + b + c = 300, S2 = ab + bc + ca, and S3 = abc. The polynomial constraint then becomes 300 * S2 - 3 * S3 = 6,000,000. This can be rearranged to 100 * S2 - S3 = 2,000,000. This relationship tightly couples the symmetric sums S2 and S3. Since a, b, c are nonnegative integers summing to 300, S1 is fixed, and the problem reduces to finding triples (a,b,c) with nonnegative integers such that their pairwise sums and product satisfy this linear relation in terms of S2 and S3. This expression leverages well-known symmetric polynomial identities, simplifying the original complicated cubic polynomial into a linear relation between S2 and S3, given S1 fixed. This clarifies that the set of possible triples (a,b,c) lies on the intersection of the plane a + b + c = 300 and the cubic surface defined implicitly by 100 * S2 - S3 = 2,000,000. This approach narrows the search for solutions and informs any combinatorial or algebraic enumeration strategy. Moreover, since S2 and S3 are symmetric sums, the problem is invariant under permutations of (a,b,c), reducing complexity. Considering other agents' solutions which arrive at the same identity confirms the correctness and usefulness of this expression.

This expression is symmetric in a, b, c and homogeneous of degree 3. The key insight is to rewrite it using elementary symmetric polynomials: S1 = a + b + c, S2 = ab + bc + ca, and S3 = abc. Grouping terms, we have a^2(b + c) + b^2(a + c) + c^2(a + b) = a^2(S1 - a) + b^2(S1 - b) + c^2(S1 - c) = S1(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) - (a^3 + b^3 + c^3). Using the identities a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = S1^2 - 2S2 and a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = S1^3 - 3S1S2 + 3S3, we substitute to get: S1(S1^2 - 2S2) - (S1^3 - 3S1S2 + 3S3) = S1^3 - 2S1S2 - S1^3 + 3S1S2 - 3S3 = S1S2 - 3S3. Since the linear constraint is a + b + c = 300, we have S1 = 300, so the polynomial expression simplifies to 300 * S2 - 3 * S3. This shows that the polynomial constraint is equivalent to a linear relation between S2 and S3: 300 * S2 - 3 * S3 = 6,000,000, or equivalently 100 * S2 - S3 = 2,000,000. This relationship restricts the possible values of the symmetric sums S2 and S3 for triples (a,b,c) with fixed sum S1 = 300. Since S2 and S3 represent sums of products of the variables, this condition tightly controls the distribution of (a,b,c). The problem reduces to finding nonnegative integer triples (a,b,c) with fixed sum 300 such that their symmetric sums S2 and S3 satisfy 100 * S2 - S3 = 2,000,000.

From the previous analysis, the polynomial can be expressed in terms of symmetric sums as 300 * S2 - 3 * S3 = 6,000,000, or equivalently 100 * S2 - S3 = 2,000,000, where S2 = ab + bc + ca and S3 = abc. Given that a, b, c are nonnegative integers summing to 300, the problem reduces to finding triples (a,b,c) with nonnegative integers, sum 300, satisfying 100 * S2 - S3 = 2,000,000. To classify solutions based on equality and inequality relations, we consider the following: 1. Symmetry: The problem is symmetric in a, b, c, so solutions can be classified by the number of equal variables: (i) all equal (a = b = c), (ii) two equal (a = b ≠ c), and (iii) all distinct (a ≠ b ≠ c). 2. Effect of zero values: Since a, b, c are nonnegative, some variables may be zero. We consider cases where one or two variables are zero. 3. Inequality relations: Since the sum is fixed, variables are bounded between 0 and 300. Also, S2 = ab + bc + ca and S3 = abc are nonnegative. We analyze each classification: - Case 1: a = b = c = 100 (since sum is 300). Then S2 = 3 * 100 * 100 = 30,000 and S3 = 100 * 100 * 100 = 1,000,000. Compute 100 * S2 - S3 = 100 * 30,000 - 1,000,000 = 3,000,000 - 1,000,000 = 2,000,000, which matches the constraint. So (100,100,100) is a solution. - Case 2: a = b = x, c = y, with 2x + y = 300, x,y ≥ 0. Then S2 = x^2 + 2xy and S3 = x^2 y. The constraint is 100 * S2 - S3 = 2,000,000, or 100(x^2 + 2xy) - x^2 y = 2,000,000. This is a cubic in x and y. We can analyze this to find integer solutions with x,y ≥ 0 and 2x + y = 300. - Case 3: All distinct. We consider the general case with a,b,c all distinct nonnegative integers summing to 300. The constraint 100 * S2 - S3 = 2,000,000 restricts the possible triples to those satisfying this cubic relation. - Case 4: Presence of zeros. If one variable is zero, say c=0, then a + b = 300, S2 = ab + 0 + 0 = ab, S3 = 0. The constraint becomes 100 * ab - 0 = 2,000,000, or ab = 20,000. Since a + b = 300, ab = 20,000. We check if there exist nonnegative integers a,b with sum 300 and product 20,000. The quadratic equation for b is b = 300 - a, so a(300 - a) = 20,000, or 300a - a^2 = 20,000, or a^2 - 300a + 20,000 = 0. The discriminant is 300^2 - 4*20,000 = 90,000 - 80,000 = 10,000, which is a perfect square. The roots are (300 ± 100)/2 = (400/2, 200/2) = (200, 100). Both are integers and nonnegative. So (a,b,c) = (100,200,0) and (200,100,0) are solutions. Similarly for zeros in other positions. - Case 5: Two zeros. If two variables are zero, say b=c=0, then a=300, S2=0, S3=0, so 100*0 - 0 = 0 ≠ 2,000,000, so no solution. Summary: Solutions can be classified into: - Triples with all equal values: (100,100,100) - Triples with one zero variable and the other two satisfying ab=20,000 and a+b=300: (100,200,0), (200,100,0), and permutations. - Triples with two equal variables and one distinct variable satisfying the cubic relation. - Triples with all distinct variables satisfying the cubic relation.

From Sub-task 2, we know the polynomial constraint can be rewritten in terms of the elementary symmetric sums as 300 * S2 - 3 * S3 = 6,000,000, or equivalently 100 * S2 - S3 = 2,000,000, where S2 = ab + bc + ca and S3 = abc. Given the symmetry of the problem, we classify solutions based on the equality and inequality relations among a, b, and c, their nonnegativity, and the effect of zero values. First, consider the possibility of zeros among (a,b,c). If one variable is zero, say c=0, then a + b = 300, and the polynomial constraint reduces to a^2b + b^2a = ab(a + b) = ab * 300. The polynomial constraint equals 6,000,000, so ab * 300 = 6,000,000, which implies ab = 20,000. Since a and b are nonnegative integers summing to 300, we check if there exist integer pairs (a,b) with a + b = 300 and ab = 20,000. The quadratic equation x(300 - x) = 20,000 leads to x^2 - 300x + 20,000 = 0. The discriminant is 300^2 - 4*20,000 = 90,000 - 80,000 = 10,000, which is a perfect square (100^2). Thus, solutions exist: x = (300 ± 100)/2 = 200 or 100. Hence, (a,b,c) = (200,100,0), (100,200,0), and permutations with zero in any position are solutions. Next, consider the case where none of a,b,c are zero. Since all are nonnegative and sum to 300, and given the polynomial constraint in terms of S2 and S3, the relation 100 * S2 - S3 = 2,000,000 must hold. We analyze the possible equalities among a,b,c: (1) All equal: a = b = c = 100. Then S2 = 3*100*100 = 30,000, S3 = 100*100*100 = 1,000,000. Compute 100 * S2 - S3 = 100*30,000 - 1,000,000 = 3,000,000 - 1,000,000 = 2,000,000, which matches the constraint exactly. So (100,100,100) is a solution. (2) Two equal, one different: Let a = b = x, c = y with 2x + y = 300. Then S2 = x^2 + 2xy, S3 = x^2 y. The constraint becomes 100*(x^2 + 2xy) - x^2 y = 2,000,000. Rearranged: 100x^2 + 200 x y - x^2 y = 2,000,000. For integer solutions with nonnegative x,y satisfying 2x + y = 300, we can analyze or test integer values. This case includes the all equal case as a special case (x=y=100). (3) All distinct: a, b, c distinct nonnegative integers summing to 300, satisfying 100 * S2 - S3 = 2,000,000. This is the most general case and requires checking or bounding values. Inequalities: Since a,b,c are nonnegative and sum to 300, each is between 0 and 300. From the polynomial constraint rewritten, S2 and S3 must satisfy 100 * S2 - S3 = 2,000,000. Since S3 ≤ (abc) ≤ (max a)*(max b)*(max c) ≤ 300*300*300 = 27,000,000, and S2 ≤ 3*(max a)*(max b) ≤ 3*300*300=270,000, the equation is plausible. Zero values simplify the polynomial significantly and yield solutions as shown. Symmetry implies that solutions can be permuted among (a,b,c). Therefore, the classification is: (1) Solutions with one variable zero and the other two positive integers summing to 300 with product 20,000; (2) Solutions with all three equal to 100; (3) Solutions with two equal and one different satisfying the polynomial constraint; (4) Solutions with all distinct nonnegative integers summing to 300 satisfying the polynomial constraint.

Counting permutations with one zero and two distinct positive integers gives 3! = 6 permutations, but since the zero is fixed in one position, the distinct triples are (100,200,0), (200,100,0), (100,0,200), (200,0,100), (0,100,200), (0,200,100).

We rearrange to a cubic in x and y. To find integer solutions, iterate x from 0 to 150 (since 2x ≤ 300), compute y=300-2x, and check if the cubic equation holds exactly. Each integer solution (x,x,y) corresponds to three permutations if x ≠ y, or one if x=y (since two equal and one distinct). This step requires computational checking but is efficient due to bounded x.\n\nStep 4: All distinct variables positive: The general case is the most complex. We can exploit symmetry and rewrite the polynomial constraint in terms of symmetric sums. Since a+b+c=300, and 100*S2 - S3=2,000,000, we can express S3 in terms of S2 and vice versa. To count integer triples (a,b,c) satisfying these relations with a,b,c distinct and positive, we can fix a and b, compute c=300 - a - b, and check the polynomial condition. We can limit the search to a ≤ b ≤ c to avoid counting permutations multiple times, then multiply by 6 for distinct triples. This brute force approach is feasible with computational tools given the constraints.\n\nSummary of counting method:\n- Count 1 solution for all equal case.\n- Count 6 solutions for one zero variable case.\n- For two equal variables, iterate over x, compute y, check cubic relation, count solutions accordingly (accounting for permutations).\n- For all distinct variables, iterate over a ≤ b ≤ c with a + b + c=300, check polynomial constraint, count solutions, multiply by 6.\n\nThis classification and counting approach reduces complexity by leveraging symmetry and algebraic structure, making the problem tractable computationally and conceptually clear. The key is to handle each case separately and use the derived algebraic relations to verify solutions efficiently.; answer: An efficient counting method is to classify solutions into four categories:\n1. All equal: exactly one solution (100,100,100).\n2. One zero variable: solve a+b=300 and ab=20,000, yielding two integer pairs (100,200) and (200,100), each giving 3! = 6 permutations, total 6 solutions.\n3. Two equal variables: set a=b=x, c=y=300-2x, and check the cubic equation 100(x^2 + 2xy) - x^2 y = 2,000,000 for integer x,y ≥ 0. Count all such integer solutions, considering permutations (3 if x ≠ y, 1 if x=y).\n4. All distinct positive variables: iterate over a ≤ b ≤ c with a+b+c=300, check the polynomial constraint 100*(ab+bc+ca) - abc = 2,000,000. Count valid triples and multiply by 6 to account for permutations.\n\nSumming counts from all categories gives the total number of solutions.

All permutations of these triples are considered by placing zero in each coordinate.\n\n3. Two equal, one distinct: Let a=b=x, c=y, with 2x + y = 300. The polynomial constraint reduces to a cubic relation in x and y: 100(x^2 + 2xy) - x^2 y = 2,000,000. To count integer solutions, iterate x from 0 to 150 (since 2x ≤ 300), compute y=300 - 2x, check if the cubic relation holds exactly. Count all valid (x,x,y) triples. Each such triple corresponds to 3 distinct permutations if x ≠ y, or 1 if x=y.\n\n4. All distinct and nonzero: This is the most complex case. The constraints are symmetric and nonlinear. To count solutions efficiently, use the symmetric sums approach: for fixed sum 300, iterate over possible values of S2 and S3 satisfying 100 * S2 - S3 = 2,000,000. Then, solve the cubic equation t^3 - 300 t^2 + S2 t - S3 = 0 for integer roots a,b,c ≥ 0.
