        "The counting method is verified as correct and consistent through boundary case checks (e.g., (100,100,100)), symmetry considerations ensuring no double counting, algebraic simplifications confirming the polynomial constraint, and logical completeness of the classification into four categories. Potential pitfalls such as permutation counting and exhaustive enumeration in the two equal and all distinct variable cases are addressed by explicit iteration and permutation factors. Therefore, the method and results are reliable and accurate.": "95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval: (0.0%, 0.0%), Median: 0.0%"
