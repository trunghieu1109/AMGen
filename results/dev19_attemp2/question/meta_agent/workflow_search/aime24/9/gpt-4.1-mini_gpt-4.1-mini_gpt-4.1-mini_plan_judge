Question: Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: The problem asks for the sum m + n where m/n is the reduced fraction representing the conditional probability that Jen wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. From the previous sub-task, the conditional probability was calculated as (1/210) divided by (23/42). This is computed as (1/210) * (42/23) = 42 / (210 * 23). Simplifying by dividing numerator and denominator by 42 gives 1 / (5 * 23) = 1/115. Since 1 and 115 share no common factors other than 1, the fraction is already in simplest form. Therefore, m = 1 and n = 115, and m + n = 116. The arithmetic has been double-checked and is correct.
