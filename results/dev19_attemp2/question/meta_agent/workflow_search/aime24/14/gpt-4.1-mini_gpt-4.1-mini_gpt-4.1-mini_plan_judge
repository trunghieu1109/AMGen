Question: Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.

proposed answer: We start with the hyperbola equation \( \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \) and four points \(A, B, C, D\) on it forming a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin. The problem reduces to analyzing the squared length of diagonal \(BD^2\) under given constraints. From previous derivations, \(BD^2 = 176 \cosh^2 v - 96\), where \(v\) is a parameter related to the points on the hyperbola. The rhombus condition and the diagonals intersecting at the origin impose the constraint \(11 \cosh(u+v) = \cosh(u-v)\), which simplifies to \(\tanh u \tanh v = -\frac{5}{6}\). Since \(\tanh u\) and \(\tanh v\) must lie in \((-1,1)\), this implies \(|\tanh v| > \frac{5}{6}\) to keep \(|\tanh u| < 1\). Using the identity \(\cosh^2 v = \frac{1}{1 - \tanh^2 v}\), the minimum \(\cosh^2 v\) under this constraint occurs as \(|\tanh v| \to \frac{5}{6}^+\), yielding \(\cosh^2 v = \frac{36}{11}\). Substituting back, the minimum possible \(BD^2\) is \(176 \times \frac{36}{11} - 96 = 480\). As \(|\tanh v| \to 1\), \(\cosh^2 v \to \infty\), so \(BD^2 \to \infty\). Therefore, the set of valid \(BD^2\) values is \((480, \infty)\). The greatest real number less than all such \(BD^2\) values is the infimum, which is 480. This value is consistent with all constraints and assumptions, including the hyperbola equation, the rhombus diagonals intersecting at the origin, and the parameter restrictions. Hence, the final verified answer is 480.
