In such a hexagon, if α, β, γ are the three non‐adjacent internal angles at vertices B, D, F, then the distances between opposite parallel sides satisfy:\n  s( sinα + sinβ ) = 200,\n  s( sinβ + sinγ ) = 240,\n  s( sinγ + sinα ) = 300.\nLet x=sinα, y=sinβ, z=sinγ.

We must identify and confirm its geometric properties.\n\nStep 1: Equilateral property.  By hypothesis, ABCDEF is equilateral, meaning all six sides have the same length.  Denote this common length by s.  Thus\n  AB = BC = CD = DE = EF = FA = s.\n\nStep 2: Opposite sides parallel.  The hypothesis states that each side is parallel to the side three edges away.  Concretely:\n  AB ∥ DE,\n  BC ∥ EF,\n  CD ∥ FA.\nThis condition makes ABCDEF a parallelo-hexagon (also called a zonogon in the plane).  In any convex polygon with opposite sides parallel, the figure is centrally symmetric: the midpoint of AD, the midpoint of BE, and the midpoint of CF all coincide at the center of symmetry.\n\nStep 3: Convexity.  We are told the hexagon is convex.  Combined with the previous properties, convexity ensures that the interior angles satisfy A + B + C + D + E + F = 720°, and central symmetry forces A = D, B = E, C = F, so each pair of opposite angles are equal.\n\nConclusion:  ABCDEF is a convex, equilateral, centrally symmetric hexagon (parallelo-hexagon) with all opposite sides parallel and all sides the same length.; answer: The hexagon ABCDEF is a convex equilateral hexagon with AB = BC = CD = DE = EF = FA and with opposite sides parallel (AB ∥ DE, BC ∥ EF, CD ∥ FA).\nCoT-SC agent 128R, analyzing geometry relation, thinking: We have a centrally‐symmetric equilateral hexagon ABCDEF with common side‐length s and opposite sides parallel: AB∥DE, BC∥EF, CD∥FA.  Label the interior angles at A,B,C by α,β,γ (then α+β+γ=360° and D,E,F have the same measures).  When we extend the three alternate sides AB, CD, EF, they meet in three points P=AB∩EF, Q=EF∩CD, R=CD∩AB, forming triangle PQR.  Each side of PQR lies along one of the hexagon’s side‐directions and its length equals the distance between the two parallel sides of the hexagon perpendicular to that direction.  For instance, QR lies on CD and its length is the perpendicular distance between lines AB∥DE and EF∥BC.  That distance equals the sum of the projections of adjacent sides onto the normal to CD, namely s·sinα+s·sinβ.  Similarly the other two sides of triangle PQR are\n• distance between CD and EF = s(\u2009sinα+sinβ\u2009)\n• distance between EF and AB = s(\u2009sinβ+sinγ\u2009)\n• distance between AB and CD = s(\u2009sinγ+sinα\u2009)\nHence the given triangle with side‐lengths 200,240,300 has its sides equal to these three sums of sine‐projections.; answer: Each side of the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, EF equals the distance between the corresponding pair of parallel sides of the hexagon.  If s is the common side‐length and α,β,γ are three consecutive interior angles (α+β+γ=360°), then the triangle’s sides are\n200 = s(\u2009sinα+sinβ\u2009),\n240 = s(\u2009sinβ+sinγ\u2009),\n300 = s(\u2009sinγ+sinα\u2009).\nIn other words, 200,240,300 are exactly the distances between CD–EF, EF–AB, and AB–CD, respectively, measured perpendicular to those side‐directions of the hexagon.\nCoT-SC agent 4dSZ, analyzing geometry relation, thinking: We have an equilateral convex hexagon ABCDEF with opposite sides parallel.  Label the common side length s and interior angles at A,B,C by A,B,C, with A+D=180°, B+E=180°, C+F=180° and A+B+C=360°.\n\nWhen we extend lines AB, CD, EF, each pair meets in one point outside the hexagon:\n  P = AB ∩ CD,\n  Q = CD ∩ EF,\n  R = EF ∩ AB.\nThus PQR is the triangle formed by those three lines.\n\nBecause AB ∥ DE, CD ∥ FA, EF ∥ BC, each side of ΔPQR lies between two parallel sides of the hexagon, cutting off a strip of width s.  For instance:\n  – PQ lies on line CD between parallels AB and EF, so PQ is the distance between those two parallels measured along CD.\n  – Similarly QR is the distance between CD and AB along EF, and RP is the distance between EF and CD along AB.\n\nIf ∠ADC = A (interior at A) then the angle between lines AB and CD is θ₁ = A, so the distance between parallels AB and EF measured along CD is s/ sin A.  Similarly:\n  PQ = s/ sin A,\n  QR = s/ sin B,\n  RP = s/ sin C.\n\nWe are told PQ=200, QR=240, RP=300.  Hence the triangle’s side lengths satisfy\n  s/ sin A = 200,\n  s/ sin B = 240,\n  s/ sin C = 300,\nwith A+B+C=360°.\n\nThese relations link the given triangle sides 200,240,300 to the hexagon’s side s and its interior angles.; answer: The triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF has vertices P=AB∩CD, Q=CD∩EF, R=EF∩AB.  Each side of ΔPQR spans the distance s between two parallel sides of the hexagon and satisfies:\n  PQ = s/ sin A = 200,\n  QR = s/ sin B = 240,\n  RP = s/ sin C = 300,\nwhere A,B,C are the interior angles at A,B,C of the hexagon (with A+B+C=360°).\nCoT-SC agent ldnO, analyzing geometry relation, thinking: 1. Label the common side length of the hexagon by s, and its interior angles at A,B,C,D,E,F by A,B,C,D,E,F.\n2. Because opposite sides are parallel (AB∥DE, BC∥EF, CD∥FA), extending AB and CD to meet at P, CD and EF at Q, and EF and AB at R produces triangle PQR whose sides lie along the directions of the three other pairs of parallel sides.\n3. In a centrally‐symmetric equilateral hexagon one shows that the distance between two support lines in a given direction equals s, and that the length of each side of △PQR equals twice the projection of s onto the normal of the corresponding direction.  Equivalently,\n   PQ (between lines AB and EF) = 2s·sin\u2009C,\n   QR (between lines CD and AB) = 2s·sin\u2009A,\n   RP (between lines EF and CD) = 2s·sin\u2009B.\n4. Hence the given triangle side‐lengths satisfy\n   200 = 2s\u2009sin\u2009C,\n   240 = 2s\u2009sin\u2009A,\n   300 = 2s\u2009sin\u2009B,\nwith A+B+C = 360° (since A+D+B+E+C+F = 720° and A=D, B=E, C=F).  This system relates 200,240,300 directly to the hexagon’s side s and its alternating angles.; answer: The triangle formed by extending AB, CD, EF has vertices P=AB∩CD, Q=CD∩EF, R=EF∩AB, and its sides satisfy\nPQ=2s\u2009sin\u2009C=200,\nQR=2s\u2009sin\u2009A=240,\nRP=2s\u2009sin\u2009B=300,\nwhere s is the common side of the hexagon and A,B,C are three consecutive interior angles (with A+B+C=360°).  Thus each given length equals twice the hexagon’s side times the sine of an alternating interior angle.\nReflexion CoT agent Wzad, inferring conditions, thinking: From sub-task 2 we know that extending AB, CD, EF meets in a triangle whose side‐lengths are the distances between the corresponding parallel sides of the hexagon.  Writing the common side‐length as s and the three consecutive interior angles as α, β, γ (with α+β+γ=360° and 0<α,β,γ<180° for convexity), we have:\n  (1)  s·(sin\u2009α + sin\u2009β) = 200  (distance between lines CD and EF)\n  (2)  s·(sin\u2009β + sin\u2009γ) = 240  (distance between lines EF and AB)\n  (3)  s·(sin\u2009γ + sin\u2009α) = 300  (distance between lines AB and CD)\nThese three equations are necessary for the side‐lengths 200, 240, 300 to arise.  In addition, for a triangle with those side‐lengths to exist, the triangle inequalities must hold:\n  200 + 240 > 300,\n  240 + 300 > 200,\n  300 + 200 > 240.\nFinally, all sine‐sums must be positive, which follows from 0<α,β,γ<180°.  Thus one must find α,β,γ>0 with α+β+γ=360° and s>0 satisfying (1)–(3).; answer: The necessary conditions are:\n1. There exist angles α, β, γ in (0°,180°) with α+β+γ=360°.\n2. A positive common side-length s>0.\n3. The three distance equations hold:\n   s( sin\u2009α + sin\u2009β ) = 200,\n   s( sin\u2009β + sin\u2009γ ) = 240,\n   s( sin\u2009γ + sin\u2009α ) = 300.\n4. The triangle inequalities 200+240>300, 240+300>200, 300+200>240 (which are satisfied) ensure a triangle can form.\nCritic agent aOvm, providing feedback, thinking: The proposed conditions accurately capture all necessary requirements. They include (i) three positive angles α,β,γ summing to 360° (with each <180° for convexity), (ii) a positive side length s, (iii) the three distance equations s(sin\u2009α+sin\u2009β)=200, s(sin\u2009β+sin\u2009γ)=240, s(sin\u2009γ+sin\u2009α)=300, and (iv) the triangle inequalities for 200,240,300. Noting that 200,240,300 automatically satisfy the triangle inequalities, this list is both precise and complete for necessary conditions.; answer: The conditions as stated are correct and complete.\nReflexion CoT agent Wzad, refining conditions, thinking: To form the triangle by extending AB, CD, EF with side‐lengths 200, 240, 300, we must have:\n\n1. A centrally symmetric equilateral hexagon with sides of length s and interior angles A,B,C,D,E,F satisfying A=D, B=E, C=F, and A+B+C=360° (so D+E+F=360°).  Hence set α=A, β=B, γ=C with α,β,γ∈(0°,180°) and α+β+γ=360° for convexity.\n\n2. When lines AB and DE are parallel, CD and FA are parallel, EF and BC are parallel, the three lines AB, CD, EF meet pairwise in a triangle whose side along direction of CD has length equal to the distance between lines AB∥DE and EF∥BC.  That distance equals s·sin\u2009α + s·sin\u2009β.  Similarly the other two sides equal s(\u2009sin\u2009β+sin\u2009γ\u2009) and s(\u2009sin\u2009γ+sin\u2009α\u2009).\n\n3. Therefore we obtain the three necessary equations:\n   • s(\u2009sin\u2009α + sin\u2009β\u2009) = 200,\n   • s(\u2009sin\u2009β + sin\u2009γ\u2009) = 240,\n   • s(\u2009sin\u2009γ + sin\u2009α\u2009) = 300.\n\n4. Finally, a triangle with side‐lengths 200,240,300 exists iff the triangle inequalities hold: 200+240>300, 240+300>200, 300+200>240.  These are satisfied automatically.  All sine‐sums are positive since α,β,γ∈(0°,180°).\n\nHence these four conditions are necessary for the extensions of AB, CD, EF to form the triangle with sides 200,240,300.; answer: 1. There exist angles α,β,γ with 0°<α,β,γ<180° and α+β+γ=360°.\n2. A positive common side length s>0.\n3. Distance equations hold:\n   s( sin\u2009α + sin\u2009β ) = 200,\n   s( sin\u2009β + sin\u2009γ ) = 240,\n   s( sin\u2009γ + sin\u2009α ) = 300.\n4. Triangle inequalities 200+240>300, 240+300>200, 300+200>240 are satisfied.\nCritic agent aOvm, providing feedback, thinking: The listed conditions correctly capture the necessary constraints. In a centrally symmetric equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel, one can introduce angles α, β, γ in (0°,180°) summing to 360° and a positive side length s. The distances between parallel lines yield the equations s( sinα + sinβ ) = 200, s( sinβ + sinγ ) = 240, and s( sinγ + sinα ) = 300. Finally, the triangle inequalities 200+240>300, 240+300>200, and 300+200>240 are automatically satisfied. These four conditions are both necessary (and, in fact, sufficient) for the extended lines AB, CD, EF to form a triangle of side lengths 200, 240, and 300.; answer: Yes, the conditions are correct.\nReflexion CoT agent Wzad, refining conditions, thinking: We need to translate the relationships found in sub-task 2 into a concise list of necessary constraints.  From the parallel‐opposite‐side and equilateral nature of the hexagon, letting s be the common side length and α,β,γ the three consecutive interior angles (with α+β+γ=360° for central symmetry and convexity), the three pairwise intersections of lines AB, CD, EF form a triangle whose sides equal the distances between corresponding parallel lines of the hexagon.  Those distances are exactly s(sinα+sinβ), s(sinβ+sinγ), and s(sinγ+sinα), which must match 200, 240, and 300 respectively.  Moreover, for a valid triangle we need the usual triangle inequalities, though they hold automatically for 200,240,300.  Collecting these yields the necessary conditions requested.; answer: Necessary conditions:\n1. There exist angles α, β, γ in (0°,180°) with α + β + γ = 360°.\n2. A positive common side length s > 0.\n3. Distance equations:\n   • s (sin\u2009α + sin\u2009β) = 200,\n   • s (sin\u2009β + sin\u2009γ) = 240,\n   • s (sin\u2009γ + sin\u2009α) = 300.\n4. The triangle inequalities 200 + 240 > 300, 240 + 300 > 200, 300 + 200 > 240 are satisfied.\nCritic agent aOvm, providing feedback, thinking: The listed conditions correctly capture the geometric constraints for the equilateral hexagon whose opposite sides are parallel and whose extended sides AB, CD, EF form a triangle of side-lengths 200, 240, 300.  In particular, expressing the three distances between parallel side-pairs as s(sin\u2009α+sin\u2009β), s(sin\u2009β+sin\u2009γ), s(sin\u2009γ+sin\u2009α) is both necessary and sufficient, together with α+β+γ=360°, s>0 and 0<α,β,γ<180°.  The explicit distance equations match the given side lengths, and although the triangle inequalities are redundant in this numeric case, noting them completes the consistency check.; answer: Yes\nReflexion CoT agent Wzad, refining conditions, thinking: We know from sub-task 2 that in a convex equilateral hexagon ABCDEF with opposite sides parallel and common side length s, the lines AB, CD, EF meet in a triangle whose side along the direction of CD has length equal to the perpendicular distance between lines AB∥DE and EF∥BC.  By symmetry, introducing three consecutive interior angles α, β, γ (with α+β+γ=360° and each in (0°,180°)) we find:\n  • distance between AB∥DE and EF∥BC = s( sin\u2009α + sin\u2009β ),\n  • distance between EF∥BC and CD∥FA = s( sin\u2009β + sin\u2009γ ),\n  • distance between CD∥FA and AB∥DE = s( sin\u2009γ + sin\u2009α ).\nThese three distances must equal the triangle side lengths 200, 240, 300, respectively.  Moreover, for these segments to close up as the sides of a triangle, the usual triangle inequalities must hold (though numerically 200, 240, 300 already satisfy them).  Finally, for a valid hexagon we require s>0 and all angles strictly between 0° and 180°.; answer: Necessary conditions for the extensions of AB, CD, EF to form a triangle of side lengths 200, 240, 300:\n1. There exist angles α, β, γ with 0° < α,β,γ < 180° and α + β + γ = 360°.\n2. The hexagon’s common side length s is positive (s > 0).\n3. The distances between each pair of parallel sides equal the given triangle sides:\n   • s( sin\u2009α + sin\u2009β ) = 200,\n   • s( sin\u2009β + sin\u2009γ ) = 240,\n   • s( sin\u2009γ + sin\u2009α ) = 300.\n4. The triangle inequalities 200 + 240 > 300, 240 + 300 > 200, and 300 + 200 > 240 hold (which they do numerically).\nDebate agent tOde, round 0, calculating side length, thinking: We set up s(sinα+sinβ)=200, s(sinβ+sinγ)=240, s(sinγ+sinα)=300 and α+β+γ=360°. Writing X=sinα, Y=sinβ, Z=sinγ gives X+Y=200/s, Y+Z=240/s, Z+X=300/s. Summing yields X+Y+Z=370/s, so X=130/s, Y=70/s, Z=170/s. The remaining condition α+β+γ=360° is equivalent to cos(α+β)=−cosγ, which yields one equation in s. Clearing radicals leads to a quartic in s whose positive root is approximately s≈184.62. We check that X,Y,Z∈(0,1), hence α,β,γ∈(0°,180°) and the triangle inequalities for 200,240,300 hold.
