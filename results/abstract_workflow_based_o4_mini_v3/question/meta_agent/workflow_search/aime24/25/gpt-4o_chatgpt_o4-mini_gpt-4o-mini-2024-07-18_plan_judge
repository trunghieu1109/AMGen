proposed answer: We seek the side length s of an equilateral convex hexagon ABCDEF with opposite sides parallel, given that the triangle formed by extensions of AB, CD, EF has side lengths 200, 240, 300.  In such a hexagon, if α, β, γ are the three non‐adjacent internal angles at vertices B, D, F, then the distances between opposite parallel sides satisfy:
  s( sinα + sinβ ) = 200,
  s( sinβ + sinγ ) = 240,
  s( sinγ + sinα ) = 300.
Let x=sinα, y=sinβ, z=sinγ.  Then:
  x+y=200/s,
  y+z=240/s,
  z+x=300/s.
Summing gives 2(x+y+z)=740/s ⇒ x+y+z=370/s.
Hence:
  x=370/s−240/s=130/s,
  y=370/s−300/s=70/s,
  z=370/s−200/s=170/s.
Since 0<x,y,z≤1, we require z=170/s≤1 ⇒ s≥170.  We test integer s≥170 to satisfy the three equations exactly.  For s=185:
  x=130/185=26/37,
  y=70/185=14/37,
  z=170/185=34/37,
all ≤1.  Then:
  s(x+y)=185·(26/37+14/37)=185·(40/37)=200,
  s(y+z)=185·(48/37)=240,
  s(z+x)=185·(60/37)=300.
Thus the distances match.  Finally, check that α,β,γ can be chosen in (0°,180°) summing to 360°: arcsin(26/37)≈44.66°, arcsin(14/37)≈22.25°, arcsin(34/37)≈66.88°.  Taking α=180°−44.66°=135.34°, β=180°−22.25°=157.75°, γ=66.88°, we get α+β+γ≈360° and each in (0,180).  Hence s=185 is valid and minimal.
