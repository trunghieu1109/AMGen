        "response": "To count maximal valid chip placements under the given rules, we use the row/column status model: each of the 5 rows and 5 columns is assigned a color status in {W, B}.  A chip is placed at cell (i,j) exactly when row_i and col_j share the same status.  \n\n1. Any row or column left unassigned (empty) would allow adding a chip at its intersection with a nonempty line without breaking the monochromatic rule, violating maximality.  Therefore every row and every column must be assigned either W or B (no empties).\n\n2. With all 5 rows and 5 columns colored, empty cells occur only where a row and column have different colors; neither W nor B can be placed there without conflicting with one of the two lines. Thus the configuration is indeed maximal.\n\n3. There are 2 choices (W or B) for each of the 5 rows and independently 2 choices for each of the 5 columns, giving 2^5\u00b72^5 = 2^10 = 1024 total maximal placements.\n\n4. Each such placement uses at most 25 chips of each color, within the supply limits of 25 white and 25 black chips, so no further restrictions apply.\n\nHence the total number of maximal valid configurations is 1024.\n\nAnswer:1024",
