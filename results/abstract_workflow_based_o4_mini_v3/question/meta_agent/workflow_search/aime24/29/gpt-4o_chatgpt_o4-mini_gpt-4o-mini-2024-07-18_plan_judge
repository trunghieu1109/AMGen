Question: There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\times5$ grid such that: 

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.

proposed answer: To count maximal valid chip placements under the given rules, we use the row/column status model: each of the 5 rows and 5 columns is assigned a color status in {W, B}.  A chip is placed at cell (i,j) exactly when row_i and col_j share the same status.  

1. Any row or column left unassigned (empty) would allow adding a chip at its intersection with a nonempty line without breaking the monochromatic rule, violating maximality.  Therefore every row and every column must be assigned either W or B (no empties).

2. With all 5 rows and 5 columns colored, empty cells occur only where a row and column have different colors; neither W nor B can be placed there without conflicting with one of the two lines. Thus the configuration is indeed maximal.

3. There are 2 choices (W or B) for each of the 5 rows and independently 2 choices for each of the 5 columns, giving 2^5Â·2^5 = 2^10 = 1024 total maximal placements.

4. Each such placement uses at most 25 chips of each color, within the supply limits of 25 white and 25 black chips, so no further restrictions apply.

Hence the total number of maximal valid configurations is 1024.
