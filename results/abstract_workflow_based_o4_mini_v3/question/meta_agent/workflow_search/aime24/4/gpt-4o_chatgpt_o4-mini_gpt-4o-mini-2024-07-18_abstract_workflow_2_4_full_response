Compute fourth powers mod17: k^4 mod17 for k=0..16 gives residues {0,1,4,13,16}. Since –1≡16 mod17 appears (for k=2,8,9,15), there are solutions to n^4≡–1 mod17.  \n4) To lift to mod17^2=289, use Hensel’s lemma. Let f(n)=n^4+1.  Take n₀=2: f(2)=2^4+1=17≡0 mod17, and f′(n)=4n^3 so f′(2)=32≡15 mod17 which is invertible.

Compute 4th powers mod17: the values are {1,4,13,16} so –1≡16 appears, with basic roots n≡2,15,8,9 mod17.  We Hensel‐lift each root to mod289.  For example n≡2 mod17: write n=2+17t and expand f(n)=n^4+1≡f(2)+f'(2)·17t mod289.  Since f(2)=17 and f'(2)=4·2^3=32≡15 mod17, we get f(n)≡17(1+15t).  Setting ≡0 mod289 gives 1+15t≡0 mod17 ⇒t≡9.  Hence n≡2+17·9=155 mod289.  Repeating for the other seeds yields the four solutions n≡110,155,134,179 mod289.  The least positive is n=110.  Indeed 110^4+1=63001+1=63002=289·218, so divisible by 17^2.\nThus the least prime is p=17, and the least positive n with n^4+1≡0 mod289 is n=110.; answer: p=17, with solutions n≡110, 134, 155, or 179 (mod 289); the least positive n is 110.\nCoT-SC agent 6Hfd, small primes check, thinking: We seek the smallest prime p>2 for which there is a positive integer n with n^4+1 divisible by p^2.

By checking 4th powers mod49 (or by small search n=0…48), one finds n^4+1 mod49 never vanishes.  So p=7 fails.\n\n4. p=11: p^2=121.  First solve n^4≡–1 mod11.  Fourth powers mod11 are {0,1,3,4,5,9}.  –1≡10 mod11 is not among them.  So no solutions mod11, hence none mod121.  So p=11 fails.\n\n5. p=13: p^2=169.  Fourth powers mod13 are {0,1,3,9}.  –1≡12 mod13 is not in this set.  Thus no solutions.  p=13 fails.\n\n6. p=17: p^2=289.  Fourth powers mod17 are {0,1,4,13,16}.  –1≡16 appears, so there are solutions n≡2,8,9,15 mod17.  We use Hensel’s lemma to lift each to mod289.  For n0=2, write n=2+17t.  f(n)=n^4+1, f(2)=17, f'(2)=4·2^3=32≡15 mod17.  We need f(2)+f'(2)·17t≡0 mod289 ⇒17+15·17·t≡0 ⇒1+15t≡0 mod17 ⇒t≡9.  Thus n≡2+17·9=155 mod289.  Lifting the other three seeds similarly yields n≡110,134,179,155 mod289.  The least positive solution is n=110.  Indeed 110^4+1=289·218, so divisible by 17^2.\n\nConclusion: the least prime p>2 for which n^4+1 is divisible by p^2 is p=17, with the smallest corresponding n=110.; answer: The least prime p>2 with n^4+1 divisible by p^2 is 17.\nCoT-SC agent AldE, small primes check, thinking: We seek the smallest prime p>2 for which there exists n>0 with n^4+1≡0 mod p^2.\n\n1. p=3: p^2=9.

For example n≡2 mod17 gives 2^4+1=17, divisible by17 but not 289.  Since f'(2)=4·2^3=32≡15 mod17≠0, Hensel’s lemma lifts to a solution mod289.  Thus 17^2 divides some n^4+1.

In each case, the set of fourth powers mod p does not contain p-1, so no solution n^4≡–1 mod p and hence no n with n^4+1≡0 mod p^2.  \nStep 2: For p=17, compute fourth powers mod17: {0^4,1^4,2^4,3^4,…}= {0,1,4,13,16}. Since -1≡16 mod17 is in this set, there are solutions mod17.  The roots are n≡2,8,9,15 mod17.  \nStep 3: Apply Hensel’s lemma to lift each root to mod289=17^2. For n0=2: set n=2+17t.  f(n)=n^4+1, f(2)=17, f′(2)=4·2^3=32≡15 mod17.  We need f(2)+f′(2)·17t≡0 mod289 ⇒17(1+15t)≡0 ⇒1+15t≡0 mod17 ⇒t≡9, so n≡2+17·9=155 mod289.

From prior analysis, p=17 is the least such prime because for smaller primes (3,5,7,11,13) the congruence n^4≡−1 mod p has no solution.  For p=17 we found the fourth‐power residues mod17 are {0,1,4,13,16}, so −1≡16 is in that set.  The roots mod17 are n≡2,8,9,15.  We then lift one root (n0=2) to mod289 using Hensel’s lemma: set n=2+17t, f(n)=n^4+1, f(2)=17, f′(2)=4·2^3=32≡15 mod17.

Step 5: Divide 146 410 001 by 289; since 289 × 506 609 = 146 410 001, there is no remainder. Hence 146 410 001 ≡ 0 mod 289. All numbers involved lie well within standard integer ranges, so there are no computational limitations here.

The smallest positive lift is n=110.\n\n5) Compute 110^4+1: first 110^2=12 100, then (12 100)^2=146 410 000, add 1 ⇒146 410 001.  Since 17^2=289 and 289×506 609=146 410 001 exactly, we have 110^4+1≡0 (mod289).  Thus n=110 works and validates existence.\n\nConclusion: the least prime is p=17, the least n is 110, and indeed 110^4+1 is divisible by 17^2.; answer: For p=17 and n=110, we have 110^4+1=146410001, which equals 17^2×506609, so n^4+1 is divisible by p^2.\nDebate agent Y5Pi, round 0, determining smallest m, thinking: We seek the least prime p for which there is n with n^4+1≡0 mod p^2, then find the least such n (called m).  \n1) Test small primes p=2,3,5,7,11,13: for each, –1 is not a fourth power mod p, so no solution mod p, hence none mod p^2.  \n2) For p=17 check fourth powers mod17: compute k^4 mod17 for k=0…16 gives {0,1,4,13,16}. Since –1≡16 mod17 appears, solutions to n^4≡–1 mod17 exist, namely n≡2,8,9,15 (mod17).  \n3) To lift n≡2 mod17 to mod17^2=289 use Hensel’s lemma: set n=2+17t, f(n)=n^4+1. Compute f(2)=2^4+1=17; f′(n)=4n^3 gives f′(2)=32≡15 mod17. We need f(2)+17·t·f′(2)≡0 mod289 ⇒17+17·15·t≡0⇒1+15t≡0 mod17⇒15t≡–1⇒t≡9 mod17.

Checking small primes: for p=3,5,7,11,13 one finds −1 is not a fourth power mod p, so no solutions mod p and hence none mod p^2. For p=17 we note −1 ≡ 16 mod 17 and 2^4 ≡16, so n^4 ≡−1 (mod17) has solutions n ≡2,8,9,15. To lift to mod 17^2=289, use Hensel’s lemma. Take n0=2: f(n)=n^4+1, f(2)=17≡0 (mod17) and f′(n)=4n^3 gives f′(2)=32≡15 (mod17), invertible.

No solution.\n2) For p=3,5,7,11,13: check if –1 is a fourth power mod p. The sets of fourth powers mod p do not contain –1, so no solutions mod p and hence none mod p^2.\n3) Next p=17. Compute k^4 mod17 for k=0..16: the residues are {0,1,4,13,16}. Since –1 ≡16 mod17 appears (e.g. 2^4≡16), there are solutions mod17: k≡2,8,9,15.\n4) We lift these to mod17^2=289 via Hensel’s lemma. Take n₀=2: f(n)=n^4+1, f(2)=17≡0 mod17, f′(n)=4n^3 so f′(2)=32≡15 mod17 (invertible). Write n=2+17t and impose f(2)+f′(2)·17t≡0 mod289 ⇒17+15·17·t≡0⇒1+15t≡0 mod17⇒t≡9 mod17. Thus lift: n≡2+17·9=155 mod289.\n5) Similarly lifting seeds 8,9,15 gives n≡110,134,179 mod289. The smallest positive is m=110.\n6) Verify: 110^4+1=146410001 and 289×506609=146410001, so divisible by17^2.\nTherefore, the least p is17 and the least m with m^4+1 divisible by17^2 is110.; answer: 110\nDebate agent amYw, round 1, determining smallest m, thinking: We need the smallest prime p for which n^4+1≡0 mod p^2 has a solution, then find the least such n (call it m).  Checking small primes 2,3,5,7,11,13 yields no fourth‐power = –1 mod p, so no solutions.  For p=17 we note –1≡16 and 2^4≡16 mod 17, so n≡2,8,9,15 mod 17 solve n^4≡–1.  To lift to mod 17^2=289, use Hensel’s lemma: let f(n)=n^4+1.  Take n0=2: f(2)=17≡0 mod 17, f′(2)=4·2^3=32≡15 mod 17 is invertible.  Write n=2+17t.  We need f(2)+f′(2)·17t≡0 mod 289 ⇒17 +15·17t≡0 ⇒1+15t≡0 mod 17 ⇒t≡9.  So n≡2+17·9=155 mod 289.  Lifting the other seeds 8,9,15 gives 110,134,179 mod 289.  The smallest positive lift is m=110.

But m^4 ≡ 0 or 1 (mod 4), so m^4 + 1 ≡ 1 or 2, never 0. No solution.\n   - p = 3, 5, 7, 11, 13: one first checks whether –1 is a fourth power modulo p.  Compute the set {k^4 mod p | k = 0,…,p–1}.  In each of these cases, –1 mod p does not appear among fourth powers, so no solution mod p ⇒ no solution mod p^2.\n\n3) Next p = 17.  Compute fourth‐power residues mod 17:\n     k  : 0  1  2   3   4   5  … 16\n     k^4: 0  1 16 13  13   1 … 16\n   The distinct fourth powers are {0,1,4,13,16}.  Here –1 ≡ 16 (mod 17) appears (for instance 2^4 ≡ 16).  Hence there are solutions to n^4 ≡ –1 (mod 17); namely n ≡ 2, 8, 9, 15 (mod 17).\n\n4) We now lift these solutions from mod 17 to mod 17^2 = 289 using Hensel’s lemma.  Let f(n) = n^4 + 1.\n   - Take the seed n0 = 2.  Then f(2) = 2^4 + 1 = 17 ≡ 0 (mod 17).  Compute the derivative f′(n) = 4 n^3; so f′(2) = 32 ≡ 15 (mod 17), which is invertible modulo 17.\n   - We look for a lift n = 2 + 17 t such that f(n) ≡ 0 (mod 289).\n     Expand via linear approximation: f(2 + 17t) ≡ f(2) + f′(2)·17t ≡ 17 + 15·17 t (mod 289).\n     We require 17 + 15·17 t ≡ 0 (mod 289) ⇒ 1 + 15 t ≡ 0 (mod 17) ⇒ 15 t ≡ –1 ≡ 16 (mod 17) ⇒ t ≡ 15^{-1}·16 ≡ 8·16 ≡ 9 (mod 17)  (since 15^{-1} mod 17 = 8).\n     Thus t ≡ 9, and so n ≡ 2 + 17·9 = 155 (mod 289).\n\n5) Lifting the other seeds similarly:\n   - Seed 8 lifts to n ≡ 8 + 17·(t8) = 110 (mod 289),\n   - Seed 9 lifts to n ≡ 134 (mod 289),\n   - Seed 15 lifts to n ≡ 179 (mod 289).\n   One finds the smallest positive lift among {155,110,134,179} is m = 110.\n\n6) Verification: 110^4 + 1 = (110^2)^2 + 1 = (12100)^2 + 1 = 146410000 + 1 = 146410001.  Since 17^2 = 289 and 289 × 506609 = 146410001, we indeed have 110^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 289).\n\nConclusion: the least prime p for which n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2 is p = 17, and the least positive integer m with m^4 + 1 divisible by 17^2 is m = 110.; answer: 110\nDebate agent amYw, round 2, determining smallest m, thinking: We seek the smallest prime p for which there is a positive integer n with n^4+1≡0 mod p^2, then the least such n (call it m).  \n1) Test p=2: n^4+1≡1+1=2 mod4≠0, so no solution.  \n2) For p=3,5,7,11,13: one checks that –1 mod p is not a fourth power, so no solution even mod p, hence none mod p^2.  \n3) Next p=17. Compute fourth powers mod17: k^4 mod17 for k=0..16 gives residues {0,1,4,13,16}. Since –1≡16 mod17 appears (for k=2,8,9,15), there are solutions to n^4≡–1 mod17.  \n4) To lift to mod17^2=289, use Hensel’s lemma. Let f(n)=n^4+1.  Take n₀=2: f(2)=2^4+1=17≡0 mod17, and f′(n)=4n^3 so f′(2)=32≡15 mod17 which is invertible.
