    <pre>Related original question:

Let $p$ be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $n^4+1$ is divisible by $p^2$. Find the least positive integer $m$ such that $m^4+1$ is divisible by $p^2$.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 1: Identify the condition under which n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 (mod p^2) for a prime number p, focusing on divisibility. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent 4uNt:
We want the condition for n^4+1≡0 mod p^2.  1. First reduce mod p: if p^2 divides n^4+1 then p divides n^4+1, so n^4≡−1 (mod p).  Thus −1 must be a quartic residue mod p.  2. By Fermatʼs little theorem n^{p−1}≡1 (mod p), so raising n^4≡−1 twice gives n^8≡1, hence the order of n mod p divides 8 but not 4.  This forces p≡1 (mod 8) so that −1 is a fourth power.  3. To lift a solution from mod p to mod p^2 one applies Hensel&#39;s lemma to f(x)=x^4+1.  Its derivative f′(x)=4x^3 must be nonzero mod p.  Since p≡1 mod 8 and n^4≡−1, p cannot divide n, so 4n^3≢0 (mod p).  Thus each solution mod p lifts uniquely to mod p^2.  4. Conclusion: n^4+1≡0 (mod p^2) ⇔ (i) n^4≡−1 (mod p) (so −1 is a quartic residue) and (ii) 4n^3≢0 (mod p).  Equivalently, p is an odd prime with p≡1 (mod 8).

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent 4uNt:
The condition is that n^4≡−1 (mod p) (so that −1 is a fourth‐power residue mod p) and that f′(n)=4n^3≢0 (mod p), which together—via Hensel’s lemma—guarantee n^4+1≡0 (mod p^2).

### Sub-task 2: Using the condition from Sub-task 1, determine the minimum prime p such that there exists an integer n for which n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2. Test small prime numbers for verification. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent gR2u:
We need the least prime p for which there exists n with n^4+1≡0 (mod p^2). From Sub‐task 1 we know p must be ≡1 (mod 8). Check primes in increasing order: 2,3,5,7,11,13 all fail the congruence condition. The next is p=17. 
1. Verify mod 17: we seek n^4≡−1≡16 (mod 17). Testing small residues gives 2^4=16.  
2. Check Hensel lift to mod 17^2=289: f(x)=x^4+1, f′(2)=4·2^3=32≡15≠0 (mod 17), so the root lifts uniquely to mod 289. Thus some n exists with n^4+1 divisible by 289. 
No smaller prime works, so p=17.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent gR2u:
17

### Sub-task 3: Having determined the least prime p, find the smallest positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2. 

 ### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent SZAM (yourself):
We know from Sub-task 2 that p = 17 and that roots of x^4+1≡0 mod 17 are x≡2,15,8,9 mod 17.  By Hensel’s lemma each lifts uniquely to mod 17^2=289 via
 b = a – 17·t,  where t ≡ (f(a)/17)·(f′(a))^{–1} mod 17.
 Compute for each a:
1) a=2: f(a)/17=1, f′(a)=4·2^3=32≡15, inv=8 ⇒ t=8 ⇒ b=2−17·8=155
2) a=15: f(a)/17≡3, f′(15)=4·15^3≡2, inv=9 ⇒ t=10 ⇒ b=15−17·10=134
3) a=8: f(a)/17≡3, f′(8)=4·8^3≡8, inv=15 ⇒ t=11 ⇒ b=8−17·11=110
4) a=9: f(a)/17≡12, f′(9)=4·9^3≡9, inv=2 ⇒ t=7 ⇒ b=9−17·7=179
These b mod 289 are the four roots: {110,134,155,179}. The smallest positive is 110.

### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent SZAM (yourself):
110

### please review the calculation of smallest m and provide feedback. 

 ### feedback #1 by Critic Agent N4c2:
The Hensel lifting from the four solutions mod 17 (2, 8, 9, 15) to mod 289 has been carried out correctly, yielding lifts 110, 134, 155, and 179, and indeed the smallest positive lift is 110.

### Sub-task 3: Having determined the least prime p, find the smallest positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2. 

 ### thinking #2 by Chain-of-Thought Agent SZAM (yourself):
We know from Sub-task 2 that the least prime is p=17. We seek the smallest m&gt;0 with m^4+1≡0 (mod 17^2). Step 1: Solve x^4+1≡0 (mod 17). Compute small residues: 2^4=16≡−1, so x≡2; similarly 8^4≡(−9)^4=6561≡−1→x≡8; 9^4≡(−8)^4=4096≡−1→x≡9; 15≡−2 gives 15^4≡16≡−1. Thus the four roots mod 17 are a∈{2,8,9,15}. Step 2: Lift each root a to a unique b mod 289 using Hensel’s lemma. For f(x)=x^4+1: f(a)=a^4+1; f′(a)=4a^3. We write b=a−17·t with t≡(f(a)/17)·(f′(a))^{−1} (mod 17). Compute for each a: 1) a=2: f(2)/17=(16+1)/17=1; f′(2)=32≡15; inv(15)=8; t≡1·8=8; b=2−17·8=2−136=−134≡155. 2) a=8: f(8)/17=(4096+1)/17=4097/17=241≡3; f′(8)=4·512=2048≡8; inv(8)=15; t≡3·15=45≡11; b=8−17·11=8−187=−179≡110. 3) a=9: f(9)/17=(6561+1)/17=6562/17=386≡12; f′(9)=4·729=2916≡9; inv(9)=2; t≡12·2=24≡7; b=9−17·7=9−119=−110≡179. 4) a=15: f(15)/17=(50625+1)/17=50626/17=2978≡3; f′(15)=4·3375=13500≡2; inv(2)=9; t≡3·9=27≡10; b=15−17·10=15−170=−155≡134. The four lifts mod 289 are {155,110,179,134}. The smallest positive is m=110.

### please review the calculation of smallest m and provide feedback. 

 ### feedback #2 by Critic Agent N4c2:
The chain‐of‐thought is correct.  They correctly found the four solutions of x^4+1≡0 mod 17 (x≡2,8,9,15), applied Hensel’s lemma to lift each to mod 17^2=289, and obtained b≡155,110,179,134 (mod 289).  Of these the smallest positive residue is m=110.  A direct check shows 110^4+1 is divisible by 289, and no smaller positive integer has this property.  Therefore m=110 is indeed the correct least positive solution.

### Sub-task 3: Having determined the least prime p, find the smallest positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2. 

 ### thinking #3 by Chain-of-Thought Agent SZAM (yourself):
We know from Sub-task 2 that the least prime p for which there is an n with n^4+1 divisible by p^2 is p=17.  We must find the smallest positive integer m such that m^4+1≡0 (mod 17^2=289).  Step 1: Solve x^4+1≡0 (mod 17).  Compute small residues: 2^4=16≡−1, so 2 is a root; similarly 8≡−9 gives 8^4=(−9)^4=6561≡−1; 9^4=(−8)^4=4096≡−1; 15≡−2 gives 15^4=16≡−1.  Thus the four solutions mod 17 are a∈{2,8,9,15}.  Step 2: Lift each a to a unique solution b modulo 289 via Hensel’s lemma.  For f(x)=x^4+1, f′(x)=4x^3.  We write b=a−17·t where t≡(f(a)/17)·(f′(a))^{−1} mod 17.

1) a=2: f(2)=2^4+1=17 so f(2)/17=1.  f′(2)=4·8=32≡15 mod 17, its inverse is 15^{−1}≡8.  Thus t≡1·8=8, and b=2−17·8=2−136=−134≡155 mod 289.

2) a=8: f(8)=4097 so f(8)/17=4097/17=241≡3.  f′(8)=4·512=2048≡8, inverse 8^{−1}≡15.  So t≡3·15=45≡11, b=8−17·11=8−187=−179≡110.

3) a=9: f(9)=6562 so f(9)/17=6562/17=386≡12.  f′(9)=4·729=2916≡9, inverse 9^{−1}≡2.  So t≡12·2=24≡7, b=9−17·7=9−119=−110≡179.

4) a=15: f(15)=50626 so f(15)/17=50626/17=2978≡3.  f′(15)=4·3375=13500≡2, inverse 2^{−1}≡9.  So t≡3·9=27≡10, b=15−17·10=15−170=−155≡134.

Thus the four solutions of x^4+1≡0 mod 289 are b≡155,110,179,134.  The smallest positive representative is m=110.  A direct check confirms 110^4+1 is divisible by 289 and no smaller positive integer has this property.

    <pre>We have determined that the least prime p for which there is an n with n^4+1 divisible by p^2 is p=17. To find the smallest positive m with m^4+1≡0 mod 17^2=289, we proceed in two main steps:

1. Solve x^4+1≡0 mod 17.  We test small residues modulo 17:
   - 2^4 = 16 ≡ –1, so x≡2 is a solution.
   - 8≡–9 gives 8^4=(–9)^4=6561≡–1, so x≡8.
   - 9≡–8 gives 9^4=(–8)^4=4096≡–1, so x≡9.
   - 15≡–2 gives 15^4=(–2)^4=16≡–1, so x≡15.
   Thus the four solutions mod 17 are a∈{2,8,9,15}.

2. Lift each solution a to a unique solution b modulo 289 using Hensel’s lemma.  For f(x)=x^4+1 and f′(x)=4x^3, we write b=a–17·t where
   t ≡ (f(a)/17) · (f′(a))^(-1) mod 17.
   Compute for each a:
   • a=2: f(2)=17 so f(2)/17=1; f′(2)=32≡15, inverse=8; t=1·8=8; b=2–17·8=2–136=–134≡155.
   • a=8: f(8)=4097 so f(8)/17=4097/17=241≡3; f′(8)=2048≡8, inverse=15; t=3·15=45≡11; b=8–187=–179≡110.
   • a=9: f(9)=6562 so f(9)/17=386≡12; f′(9)=2916≡9, inverse=2; t=12·2=24≡7; b=9–119=–110≡179.
   • a=15: f(15)=50626 so f(15)/17=2978≡3; f′(15)=13500≡2, inverse=9; t=3·9=27≡10; b=15–170=–155≡134.
   The four lifts mod 289 are {155,110,179,134}.

Finally, the smallest positive m among these is m=110. Direct verification shows 110^4+1 is divisible by 289 and no smaller positive integer has this property.
