    <pre>Related original question:

Let $p$ be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $n^4+1$ is divisible by $p^2$. Find the least positive integer $m$ such that $m^4+1$ is divisible by $p^2$.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Find m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by smallest prime&#39;s p^2, using congruence checks. 

 ### thinking #3 by Debate Agent Y5Pi:
1) We seek the least prime p for which the congruence n^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod p^2) has a solution, then the least positive integer m satisfying m^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod p^2).

2) Check small primes:
   - p = 2: we need m^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 4). But m^4 ≡ 0 or 1 (mod 4), so m^4 + 1 ≡ 1 or 2, never 0. No solution.
   - p = 3, 5, 7, 11, 13: one first checks whether –1 is a fourth power modulo p.  Compute the set {k^4 mod p | k = 0,…,p–1}.  In each of these cases, –1 mod p does not appear among fourth powers, so no solution mod p ⇒ no solution mod p^2.

3) Next p = 17.  Compute fourth‐power residues mod 17:
     k  : 0  1  2   3   4   5  … 16
     k^4: 0  1 16 13  13   1 … 16
   The distinct fourth powers are {0,1,4,13,16}.  Here –1 ≡ 16 (mod 17) appears (for instance 2^4 ≡ 16).  Hence there are solutions to n^4 ≡ –1 (mod 17); namely n ≡ 2, 8, 9, 15 (mod 17).

4) We now lift these solutions from mod 17 to mod 17^2 = 289 using Hensel’s lemma.  Let f(n) = n^4 + 1.
   - Take the seed n0 = 2.  Then f(2) = 2^4 + 1 = 17 ≡ 0 (mod 17).  Compute the derivative f′(n) = 4 n^3; so f′(2) = 32 ≡ 15 (mod 17), which is invertible modulo 17.
   - We look for a lift n = 2 + 17 t such that f(n) ≡ 0 (mod 289).
     Expand via linear approximation: f(2 + 17t) ≡ f(2) + f′(2)·17t ≡ 17 + 15·17 t (mod 289).
     We require 17 + 15·17 t ≡ 0 (mod 289) ⇒ 1 + 15 t ≡ 0 (mod 17) ⇒ 15 t ≡ –1 ≡ 16 (mod 17) ⇒ t ≡ 15^{-1}·16 ≡ 8·16 ≡ 9 (mod 17)  (since 15^{-1} mod 17 = 8).
     Thus t ≡ 9, and so n ≡ 2 + 17·9 = 155 (mod 289).

5) Lifting the other seeds similarly:
   - Seed 8 lifts to n ≡ 8 + 17·(t8) = 110 (mod 289),
   - Seed 9 lifts to n ≡ 134 (mod 289),
   - Seed 15 lifts to n ≡ 179 (mod 289).
   One finds the smallest positive lift among {155,110,134,179} is m = 110.

6) Verification: 110^4 + 1 = (110^2)^2 + 1 = (12100)^2 + 1 = 146410000 + 1 = 146410001.  Since 17^2 = 289 and 289 × 506609 = 146410001, we indeed have 110^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 289).

Conclusion: the least prime p for which n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2 is p = 17, and the least positive integer m with m^4 + 1 divisible by 17^2 is m = 110.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent amYw:
We seek the smallest prime p for which there is a positive integer n with n^4+1≡0 mod p^2, then the least such n (call it m).  
1) Test p=2: n^4+1≡1+1=2 mod4≠0, so no solution.  
2) For p=3,5,7,11,13: one checks that –1 mod p is not a fourth power, so no solution even mod p, hence none mod p^2.  
3) Next p=17. Compute fourth powers mod17: k^4 mod17 for k=0..16 gives residues {0,1,4,13,16}. Since –1≡16 mod17 appears (for k=2,8,9,15), there are solutions to n^4≡–1 mod17.  
4) To lift to mod17^2=289, use Hensel’s lemma. Let f(n)=n^4+1.  Take n₀=2: f(2)=2^4+1=17≡0 mod17, and f′(n)=4n^3 so f′(2)=32≡15 mod17 which is invertible.  Write n=2+17t and impose f(2)+f′(2)·17t≡0 mod289: 17+15·17t≡0⇒divide 17⇒1+15t≡0 mod17⇒15t≡–1⇒t≡8·(–1)≡9 mod17.  Thus n≡2+17·9=155 mod289.  
5) Lifting the other seeds 8,9,15 similarly yields n≡110,134,179 mod289. The smallest positive lift is m=110.  
6) Verification: 110^4+1=146410001 and 289×506609=146410001, so 110^4+1≡0 mod17^2.  
Therefore, the least prime is p=17 and the least m with m^4+1 divisible by 17^2 is m=110.

    <pre>We need the least positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2, where p is the smallest prime for which some n satisfies n^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod p^2).

Step 1: Identify p by testing small primes:
- p = 2: m^4 + 1 mod 4 can be 1 or 2, never 0 → reject.
- p = 3,5,7,11,13: check if –1 is a fourth power mod p; it is not for these primes → no solution mod p, so none mod p^2.

Step 2: Next prime p = 17.
Compute the set of fourth powers modulo 17: {k^4 mod 17 | k=0..16} = {0,1,4,13,16}. Since –1 ≡ 16 mod 17 appears (e.g., 2^4 ≡16), there are solutions to n^4 ≡ –1 (mod 17). Seeds are n₀ ≡2,8,9,15 (mod 17).

Step 3: Lift solutions to mod 17^2 = 289 using Hensel’s lemma. Let f(n) = n^4 + 1 and f′(n) = 4n^3.

- For seed n₀ = 2:
  f(2) = 17 ≡ 0 (mod 17), f′(2) = 32 ≡ 15 (mod 17) is invertible.  Seek n = 2 + 17t with f(2 + 17t) ≡ 0 (mod 289).  Linearizing:
    f(2 + 17t) ≡ f(2) + f′(2)·17t ≡ 17 + 15·17t ≡ 17(1 + 15t) ≡ 0 (mod 289)
    ⇒ 1 + 15t ≡ 0 (mod 17) ⇒ 15t ≡ –1 ≡ 16 (mod 17) ⇒ t ≡ 15⁻¹·16 ≡ 8·16 ≡ 9 (mod 17).
  Thus n ≡ 2 + 17·9 = 155 (mod 289).

- Similarly lift n₀ = 8 → n ≡ 110 (mod 289).
- Lift n₀ = 9 → n ≡ 134 (mod 289).
- Lift n₀ = 15 → n ≡ 179 (mod 289).

Step 4: Among the lifts {155, 110, 134, 179}, the smallest positive integer is m = 110.

Step 5: Verify: 110^4 + 1 = 146410001 and 17^2 = 289 divides 146410001 (289 × 506609 = 146410001). Thus m = 110 indeed satisfies m^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 289).

Conclusion: The least m with m^4 + 1 divisible by p^2 (where p = 17) is 110.
