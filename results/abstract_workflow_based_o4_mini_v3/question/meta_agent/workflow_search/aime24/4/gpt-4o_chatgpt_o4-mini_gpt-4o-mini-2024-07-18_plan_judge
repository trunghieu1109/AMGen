proposed answer: We have determined that the least prime p for which there is an n with n^4+1 divisible by p^2 is p=17. To find the smallest positive m with m^4+1≡0 mod 17^2=289, we proceed in two main steps:

1. Solve x^4+1≡0 mod 17.  We test small residues modulo 17:
   - 2^4 = 16 ≡ –1, so x≡2 is a solution.
   - 8≡–9 gives 8^4=(–9)^4=6561≡–1, so x≡8.
   - 9≡–8 gives 9^4=(–8)^4=4096≡–1, so x≡9.
   - 15≡–2 gives 15^4=(–2)^4=16≡–1, so x≡15.
   Thus the four solutions mod 17 are a∈{2,8,9,15}.

2. Lift each solution a to a unique solution b modulo 289 using Hensel’s lemma.  For f(x)=x^4+1 and f′(x)=4x^3, we write b=a–17·t where
   t ≡ (f(a)/17) · (f′(a))^(-1) mod 17.
   Compute for each a:
   • a=2: f(2)=17 so f(2)/17=1; f′(2)=32≡15, inverse=8; t=1·8=8; b=2–17·8=2–136=–134≡155.
   • a=8: f(8)=4097 so f(8)/17=4097/17=241≡3; f′(8)=2048≡8, inverse=15; t=3·15=45≡11; b=8–187=–179≡110.
   • a=9: f(9)=6562 so f(9)/17=386≡12; f′(9)=2916≡9, inverse=2; t=12·2=24≡7; b=9–119=–110≡179.
   • a=15: f(15)=50626 so f(15)/17=2978≡3; f′(15)=13500≡2, inverse=9; t=3·9=27≡10; b=15–170=–155≡134.
   The four lifts mod 289 are {155,110,179,134}.

Finally, the smallest positive m among these is m=110. Direct verification shows 110^4+1 is divisible by 289 and no smaller positive integer has this property.

Question: Let $p$ be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $n^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$. Find the least positive integer $m$ such that $m^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$.
Iteration: abstract_workflow_2_4
proposed answer: We need the least positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2, where p is the smallest prime for which some n satisfies n^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod p^2).

Step 1: Identify p by testing small primes:
- p = 2: m^4 + 1 mod 4 can be 1 or 2, never 0 → reject.
- p = 3,5,7,11,13: check if –1 is a fourth power mod p; it is not for these primes → no solution mod p, so none mod p^2.

Step 2: Next prime p = 17.
Compute the set of fourth powers modulo 17: {k^4 mod 17 | k=0..16} = {0,1,4,13,16}. Since –1 ≡ 16 mod 17 appears (e.g., 2^4 ≡16), there are solutions to n^4 ≡ –1 (mod 17). Seeds are n₀ ≡2,8,9,15 (mod 17).

Step 3: Lift solutions to mod 17^2 = 289 using Hensel’s lemma. Let f(n) = n^4 + 1 and f′(n) = 4n^3.

- For seed n₀ = 2:
  f(2) = 17 ≡ 0 (mod 17), f′(2) = 32 ≡ 15 (mod 17) is invertible.  Seek n = 2 + 17t with f(2 + 17t) ≡ 0 (mod 289).  Linearizing:
    f(2 + 17t) ≡ f(2) + f′(2)·17t ≡ 17 + 15·17t ≡ 17(1 + 15t) ≡ 0 (mod 289)
    ⇒ 1 + 15t ≡ 0 (mod 17) ⇒ 15t ≡ –1 ≡ 16 (mod 17) ⇒ t ≡ 15⁻¹·16 ≡ 8·16 ≡ 9 (mod 17).
  Thus n ≡ 2 + 17·9 = 155 (mod 289).

- Similarly lift n₀ = 8 → n ≡ 110 (mod 289).
- Lift n₀ = 9 → n ≡ 134 (mod 289).
- Lift n₀ = 15 → n ≡ 179 (mod 289).

Step 4: Among the lifts {155, 110, 134, 179}, the smallest positive integer is m = 110.

Step 5: Verify: 110^4 + 1 = 146410001 and 17^2 = 289 divides 146410001 (289 × 506609 = 146410001). Thus m = 110 indeed satisfies m^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 289).

Conclusion: The least m with m^4 + 1 divisible by p^2 (where p = 17) is 110.
