        "response": "We want P = \u220f_{k=0}^{12}(2 \u2212 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) where \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root of unity.  From previous work we have shown\n\n  P = ((1 + i)^{13} \u2212 1)\n      ((1 \u2212 i)^{13} \u2212 1)\n      = |(1 + i)^{13} \u2212 1|^2.\n\n1.  Compute (1 + i)^{13} in closed form.  Write 1 + i = \u221a2\u00b7e^{i\u03c0/4}.  Then\n\n     (1 + i)^{13} = (\u221a2)^{13}\u00b7e^{i(13\u00b7\u03c0/4)}\n                   = 2^{6.5}\u00b7e^{i(13\u03c0/4)}\n                   = 2^6\u00b7\u221a2\u00b7e^{i(13\u03c0/4 \u2212 2\u03c0)}    (subtract 2\u03c0 = 8\u03c0/4)\n                   = 64\u221a2\u00b7e^{i(5\u03c0/4)}\n                   = 64\u221a2\u00b7(\u2212\u221a2/2 \u2212 i\u221a2/2)\n                   = 64\u00b7(\u22121 \u2212 i)\n                   = \u221264 \u2212 64i.\n\n2.  Thus (1 + i)^{13} \u2212 1 = \u221265 \u2212 64i, and its conjugate (1 \u2212 i)^{13} \u2212 1 = \u221265 + 64i.\n\n3.  Therefore\n\n     P = (\u221265 \u2212 64i)(\u221265 + 64i)\n       = (\u221265)^2 + (64)^2\n       = 4225 + 4096\n       = 8321.\n\n4.  Finally, 8321 mod 1000 = 321.\n\nHence the remainder when P is divided by 1000 is 321.\n\nAnswer:321",
