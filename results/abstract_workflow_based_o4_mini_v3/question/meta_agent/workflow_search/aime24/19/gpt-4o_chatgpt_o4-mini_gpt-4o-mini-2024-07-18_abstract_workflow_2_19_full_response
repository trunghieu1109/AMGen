Then\n\n     (1 + i)^{13} = (√2)^{13}·e^{i(13·π/4)}\n                   = 2^{6.5}·e^{i(13π/4)}\n                   = 2^6·√2·e^{i(13π/4 − 2π)}    (subtract 2π = 8π/4)\n                   = 64√2·e^{i(5π/4)}\n                   = 64√2·(−√2/2 − i√2/2)\n                   = 64·(−1 − i)\n                   = −64 − 64i.\n\n2.  Thus (1 + i)^{13} − 1 = −65 − 64i, and its conjugate (1 − i)^{13} − 1 = −65 + 64i.\n\n3.  Therefore\n\n     P = (−65 − 64i)(−65 + 64i)\n       = (−65)^2 + (64)^2\n       = 4225 + 4096\n       = 8321.\n\n4.  Finally, 8321 mod 1000 = 321.\n\nHence the remainder when P is divided by 1000 is 321.; answer: 321', iteration_idx=-1)]
