proposed answer: From Sub-task 4 we have the exact product P = 8321. To compute P mod 1000, we divide 8321 by 1000. The integer quotient is 8, since 8 × 1000 = 8000. Subtracting, 8321 − 8000 = 321. Therefore, the remainder when P is divided by 1000 is 321.

proposed answer: We want P = ∏_{k=0}^{12}(2 − 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) where ω is a primitive 13th root of unity.  From previous work we have shown

  P = ((1 + i)^{13} − 1)
      ((1 − i)^{13} − 1)
      = |(1 + i)^{13} − 1|^2.

1.  Compute (1 + i)^{13} in closed form.  Write 1 + i = √2·e^{iπ/4}.  Then

     (1 + i)^{13} = (√2)^{13}·e^{i(13·π/4)}
                   = 2^{6.5}·e^{i(13π/4)}
                   = 2^6·√2·e^{i(13π/4 − 2π)}    (subtract 2π = 8π/4)
                   = 64√2·e^{i(5π/4)}
                   = 64√2·(−√2/2 − i√2/2)
                   = 64·(−1 − i)
                   = −64 − 64i.

2.  Thus (1 + i)^{13} − 1 = −65 − 64i, and its conjugate (1 − i)^{13} − 1 = −65 + 64i.

3.  Therefore

     P = (−65 − 64i)(−65 + 64i)
       = (−65)^2 + (64)^2
       = 4225 + 4096
       = 8321.

4.  Finally, 8321 mod 1000 = 321.

Hence the remainder when P is divided by 1000 is 321.
