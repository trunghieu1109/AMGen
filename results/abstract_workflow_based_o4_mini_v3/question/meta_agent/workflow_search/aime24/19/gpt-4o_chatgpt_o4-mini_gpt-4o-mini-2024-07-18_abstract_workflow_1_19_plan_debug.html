    <pre>Related original question:

Let $\omega\neq 1$ be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when
\[\prod_k=0^12(2-2\omega^k+\omega^2k)\]
is divided by 1000.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 5: Compute the remainder when the expression&#39;s value is divided by 1000. 

 ### thinking #3 by Debate Agent Rspn:
From Sub-task 4 we know the product P equals 8321. To find the remainder when P is divided by 1000, we divide 8321 by 1000. The integer part of 8321/1000 is 8, since 8×1000=8000. Subtracting gives 8321−8000=321. Therefore, the remainder is 321.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent 7LRv:
Step 1: From Sub-task 4, we know the exact product P equals 8321.
Step 2: To find P mod 1000, perform integer division of 8321 by 1000. 8321 ÷ 1000 gives quotient 8 and some remainder r.
Step 3: Multiply the quotient by 1000: 8 × 1000 = 8000.
Step 4: Subtract this from P: 8321 − 8000 = 321.
Thus the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000 is 321.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 5: Make final decision on the remainder. 

 then justify completely and detailedly, step-by-step why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. 
                If stuck in loop and cannot to solve this problem, stop and add [TOO HARD] in the last position.
                Again, your task is only to answer the question Sub-task 5: Make final decision on the remainder. and explaination.</pre>
