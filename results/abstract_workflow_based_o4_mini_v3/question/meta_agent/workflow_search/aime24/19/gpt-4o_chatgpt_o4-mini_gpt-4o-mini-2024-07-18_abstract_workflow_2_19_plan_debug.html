Let $\omega\neq 1$ be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when
\[\prod_k=0^12(2-2\omega^k+\omega^2k)\]
is divided by 1000.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 5: Make final decision on the prepared expression. 

 ### thinking by Final Decision Agent 0P4F:
We have already factored the original product P=∏_{k=0}^{12}(2−2ω^k+ω^{2k}) into ((1+i)^{13}−1)((1−i)^{13}−1).  Since (1−i)^{13} is the conjugate of (1+i)^{13}, their product is |(1+i)^{13}−1|².  Working modulo 1000 in the Gaussian integers, we set (1+i)^{13}≡a+bi (mod 1000).  Then P≡|(a+bi)−1|²≡(a−1)²+b² (mod 1000).  No further simplification in symbolic form is possible until we compute a and b, so this is the final prepared expression for Sub-task 5.

### answer by Final Decision Agent 0P4F:
P ≡ (a−1)² + b² (mod 1000), where (1+i)^{13} ≡ a+bi (mod 1000).

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Calculate the final product and find the remainder when divided by 1000. 

 then justify completely and detailedly, step-by-step why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. 
                If stuck in loop and cannot to solve this problem, stop and add [TOO HARD] in the last position.

    <pre>We want P = ∏_{k=0}^{12}(2 − 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) where ω is a primitive 13th root of unity.  From previous work we have shown

  P = ((1 + i)^{13} − 1)
      ((1 − i)^{13} − 1)
      = |(1 + i)^{13} − 1|^2.

1.  Compute (1 + i)^{13} in closed form.  Write 1 + i = √2·e^{iπ/4}.  Then

     (1 + i)^{13} = (√2)^{13}·e^{i(13·π/4)}
                   = 2^{6.5}·e^{i(13π/4)}
                   = 2^6·√2·e^{i(13π/4 − 2π)}    (subtract 2π = 8π/4)
                   = 64√2·e^{i(5π/4)}
                   = 64√2·(−√2/2 − i√2/2)
                   = 64·(−1 − i)
                   = −64 − 64i.

2.  Thus (1 + i)^{13} − 1 = −65 − 64i, and its conjugate (1 − i)^{13} − 1 = −65 + 64i.

3.  Therefore

     P = (−65 − 64i)(−65 + 64i)
       = (−65)^2 + (64)^2
       = 4225 + 4096
       = 8321.

4.  Finally, 8321 mod 1000 = 321.

Hence the remainder when P is divided by 1000 is 321.
