A complex number ω is an nth root of unity if ω^n = 1.  Here n=13.\nStep 2: Factorization of x^13−1 over the complex numbers gives all 13 solutions.  They are ω^k= e^{2πi k/13}, for k=0,1,…,12.\nStep 3: Identify the trivial root ω^0=1, and nontrivial roots ω^k for 1≤k≤12.  These nontrivial roots are all the distinct 13th roots ≠1.\nStep 4: Define primitive roots.  A 13th root of unity is primitive if its order exactly 13, meaning ω^k≠1 for any smaller positive exponent.  Since 13 is prime, any ω^k with 1≤k≤12 is primitive (no smaller divisor of 13 except 1 and 13).\nStep 5: State cyclotomic polynomial.  The minimal polynomial over the rationals for a primitive 13th root is φ_13(x)= x^{12} + x^{11} + … + x + 1.  Its roots are exactly ω^k for k=1,…,12.\nStep 6: Sum and product identities.  Since x^{13}−1=(x−1)φ_{13}(x), we have 1 + ω + ω^2 + … + ω^{12} = 0.  Also, product of all nontrivial roots equals φ_{13}(0)=1.\nStep 7: Magnitude and conjugation.  Each ω^k lies on the unit circle, so |ω^k|=1.  Complex conjugate of ω^k is ω^{13−k}.\nStep 8: Symmetry in real and imaginary parts.  The roots come in conjugate pairs, giving symmetric real parts and cancelling imaginary parts when summed appropriately.\nStep 9: Use these properties in any product or sum expressions involving 13th roots.\n; answer: The 13th roots of unity are the 13 solutions to ω^13=1 in the complex plane.  They are ω^k=e^{2πi k/13}, for k=0,1,…,12.  Key characteristics:\n1. ω^0=1 is the trivial root; the others (k=1…12) are nontrivial and all primitive since 13 is prime.\n2. The minimal polynomial for a primitive 13th root is φ_{13}(x)=x^{12}+x^{11}+…+x+1, whose roots are exactly ω^1,…,ω^{12}.\n3. They satisfy 1+ω+ω^2+…+ω^{12}=0.\n4.

Thus the remainder upon division by 1000 is 321.; answer: 321\nDebate agent 7LRv, round 1, computing remainder, thinking: We know from Sub-task 4 that the product P equals 8321. To find the remainder when dividing by 1000, we perform the division: 8321 ÷ 1000 = 8 remainder r. Multiply back: 8×1000 = 8000. Then subtract: 8321 − 8000 = 321. Therefore, the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000 is 321.; answer: 321\nDebate agent Rspn, round 2, computing remainder, thinking: From Sub-task 4 we know the product P equals 8321. To find the remainder when P is divided by 1000, we divide 8321 by 1000. The integer part of 8321/1000 is 8, since 8×1000=8000. Subtracting gives 8321−8000=321. Therefore, the remainder is 321.; answer: 321\nDebate agent 7LRv, round 2, computing remainder, thinking: Step 1: From Sub-task 4, we know the exact product P equals 8321.\nStep 2: To find P mod 1000, perform integer division of 8321 by 1000. 8321 ÷ 1000 gives quotient 8 and some remainder r.\nStep 3: Multiply the quotient by 1000: 8 × 1000 = 8000.\nStep 4: Subtract this from P: 8321 − 8000 = 321.\nThus the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000 is 321.; answer: 321\nFinal Decision agent, computing final remainder, thinking: From Sub-task 4 we have the exact product P = 8321. To compute P mod 1000, we divide 8321 by 1000. The integer quotient is 8, since 8 × 1000 = 8000. Subtracting, 8321 − 8000 = 321. Therefore, the remainder when P is divided by 1000 is 321.; answer: 321', iteration_idx=-1)]
