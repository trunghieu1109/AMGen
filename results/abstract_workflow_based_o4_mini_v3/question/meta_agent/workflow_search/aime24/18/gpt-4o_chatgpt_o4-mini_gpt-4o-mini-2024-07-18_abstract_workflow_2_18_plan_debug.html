    <pre>Related original question:

Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac12,0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac\sqrt32\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcalF\) be the family of segments \(\overlinePQ\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overlineAB\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcalF\) other than \(\overlineAB\). Then \(OC^2=\tfracpq\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\)..

### Sub-task 6: Express the result OC^2 as a simple fraction. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent r49N:
We know from previous work that point C has coordinates (1/8,3√3/8). To find OC², we compute the squared distance from the origin to C: 1. Compute Δx = 1/8, so (Δx)² = (1/8)² = 1/64. 2. Compute Δy = 3√3/8, so (Δy)² = (3√3/8)² = 9·3/64 = 27/64. 3. Sum these squares: OC² = 1/64 + 27/64 = 28/64. 4. Simplify 28/64 by dividing numerator and denominator by 4: 28/64 = 7/16.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent r49N:
7/16

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 7: Calculate the sum p + q ensuring they are relatively prime. 

 then justify completely and detailedly, step-by-step why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. 
                If stuck in loop and cannot to solve this problem, stop and add [TOO HARD] in the last position.
                Again, your task is only to answer the question Sub-task 7: Calculate the sum p + q ensuring they are relatively prime. and explaination.</pre>

    <pre>We know from Sub-task 6 that OC² = 7/16 in lowest terms. Therefore p = 7 and q = 16. Since gcd(7,16) = 1, they are relatively prime. Hence p + q = 7 + 16 = 23.
