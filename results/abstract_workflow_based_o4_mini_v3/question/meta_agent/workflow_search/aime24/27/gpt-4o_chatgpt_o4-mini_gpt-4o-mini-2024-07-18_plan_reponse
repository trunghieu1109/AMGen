        "response": "We know from Sub-task 4 that the greatest four-digit number N satisfying the original property is 8888. We need to divide N by 1000 and find the quotient Q and remainder R.  \n\nStep 1: By the division algorithm, for N=8888 and d=1000, there exist unique integers Q and R such that 8888 = 1000\u00b7Q + R with 0 \u2264 R < 1000.  \n\nStep 2: Compute the integer quotient Q = \u230a8888 / 1000\u230b. Since 8888/1000 = 8.888, the integer part is Q=8.  \n\nStep 3: Compute the remainder R = 8888 \u2013 (1000\u00b78) = 8888 \u2013 8000 = 888.  \n\nStep 4: Verify that 0 \u2264 888 < 1000, which holds, so the division is valid.\n\nAnswer:Q = 8, R = 888",
