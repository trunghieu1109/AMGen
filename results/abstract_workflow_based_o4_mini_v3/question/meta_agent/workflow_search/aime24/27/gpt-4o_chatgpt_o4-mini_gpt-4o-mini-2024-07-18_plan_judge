Question: Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.
Iteration: abstract_workflow_5_27
proposed answer: We know from Sub-task 4 that the greatest four-digit number N satisfying the original property is 8888. We need to divide N by 1000 and find the quotient Q and remainder R.  

Step 1: By the division algorithm, for N=8888 and d=1000, there exist unique integers Q and R such that 8888 = 1000·Q + R with 0 ≤ R < 1000.  

Step 2: Compute the integer quotient Q = ⌊8888 / 1000⌋. Since 8888/1000 = 8.888, the integer part is Q=8.  

Step 3: Compute the remainder R = 8888 – (1000·8) = 8888 – 8000 = 888.  

Step 4: Verify that 0 ≤ 888 < 1000, which holds, so the division is valid.

Answer:Q = 8, R = 888
Extracted answer: Q = 8, R = 888
Correct answer: 699
