    <pre>Related original question:

Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 5: Calculate quotient Q and remainder R when greatest number is divided by 1000. 

 ### thinking #3 by Debate Agent orfW:
We know from Sub-task 4 that the greatest four-digit number N satisfying the original property is 8888. We need to divide N by 1000 and find quotient Q and remainder R.

Step 1: Recall the division algorithm: for integers N and d&gt;0, there exist unique integers Q and R such that N = d·Q + R with 0 ≤ R &lt; d.

Step 2: Set N = 8888 and d = 1000. Compute the integer quotient Q = ⌊8888 / 1000⌋. Since 8888 / 1000 = 8.888, the integer part is Q = 8.

Step 3: Compute the remainder R = N – d·Q = 8888 – 1000·8 = 8888 – 8000 = 888.

Step 4: Verify 0 ≤ R &lt; 1000: indeed, 0 ≤ 888 &lt; 1000, so the division is valid.

Therefore, when 8888 is divided by 1000, the quotient is Q = 8 and the remainder is R = 888.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent Il7V:
We know from Sub-task 4 that the greatest four-digit number N is 8888. We want to divide N by 1000, so we use the division algorithm: N = 1000·Q + R with 0 ≤ R &lt; 1000.

Step 1: Compute the integer quotient Q = ⌊8888 / 1000⌋. Since 8888/1000 = 8.888, the integer part is Q = 8.

Step 2: Compute the remainder R = 8888 – (1000·8) = 8888 – 8000 = 888.

Step 3: Verify 0 ≤ 888 &lt; 1000, so the division is valid.

Thus, when 8888 is divided by 1000, the quotient is 8 and the remainder is 888.

### answer #3 by Debate Agent orfW:
Q = 8, R = 888

### answer #3 by Debate Agent Il7V:
Q = 8, R = 888

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 5: Decide on Q and R. 

 then justify completely and detailedly, step-by-step why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. 
                If stuck in loop and cannot to solve this problem, stop and add [TOO HARD] in the last position.
                Again, your task is only to answer the question Sub-task 5: Decide on Q and R. and explaination.</pre>
