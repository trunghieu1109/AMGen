Question: Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.
Iteration: abstract_workflow_2_9
proposed answer: Step 1: From the previous sub‐task, the conditional probability of winning the grand prize given that a prize was won is 1/115.
Step 2: Identify the numerator m = 1 and the denominator n = 115.
Step 3: Check gcd(1,115). Since the only positive divisor of 1 is 1, gcd(1,115) = 1, so the fraction is already in lowest terms.
Step 4: Compute m + n = 1 + 115 = 116.
Therefore, the simplified fraction is 1/115 and m + n = 116.

Answer:The simplified fraction is 1/115 and m+n = 116.
Extracted answer: The simplified fraction is 1/115 and m+n = 116.
Correct answer: 116

Iteration: abstract_workflow_6_9
proposed answer: From Sub-task 9 we found P(grand prize ∣ prize) = 1/115. In that fraction m=1 and n=115 are relatively prime. Therefore m+n = 1 + 115 = 116.
