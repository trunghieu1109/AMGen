Question: Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from S={1,2,…,10}. The lottery draw also picks 4 distinct numbers from S. The prize condition is stated as “at least two of her numbers were 2 of the randomly chosen numbers.” That phrase can be awkward, but the intended meaning is that she must match at least two numbers. In set‐theoretic terms, if J is Jen’s chosen set of 4 numbers and D is the drawn set of 4 numbers, she wins a prize exactly when |J∩D| ≥ 2. That covers the cases of exactly 2 matches, exactly 3 matches, or exactly 4 matches (in which case she actually wins the grand prize).; answer: She wins a prize if and only if the intersection of her chosen numbers and the drawn numbers has size at least 2 (i.e. she matches exactly 2, 3, or 4 numbers).\nCoT agent oyK3, conditions for grand prize, thinking: The question asks for the precise condition under which Jen wins the grand prize, i.e. when all four of her chosen numbers match the four numbers drawn by the lottery.\n\n1. Jen selects a set of 4 distinct numbers from S = {1,2,...,10}.\n2. The lottery then draws 4 numbers (also distinct) from S.\n3. The grand prize is awarded exactly when Jen’s chosen set of 4 numbers coincides exactly with the drawn set of 4 numbers.\n4. In set‐theoretic terms, if A is Jen’s chosen set and B is the drawn set, then the grand prize condition is A = B.\n5. Equivalently, the intersection A ∩ B must have size |A ∩ B| = 4, which means all four of Jen’s numbers are among those drawn.\n\nThus the necessary and sufficient condition for winning the grand prize is that her chosen numbers exactly match the drawn numbers.; answer: All four of Jen’s chosen numbers must exactly match the four numbers drawn (i.e. her chosen set equals the drawn set).\nCoT agent ZrcO, total lottery outcomes, thinking: We need the number of ways to choose 4 numbers out of the 10 numbers in S = {1,2,…,10}. This is the binomial coefficient “10 choose 4”, denoted C(10,4).\n\nStep 1: Recall the formula for combinations: C(n,k) = n! / (k!
