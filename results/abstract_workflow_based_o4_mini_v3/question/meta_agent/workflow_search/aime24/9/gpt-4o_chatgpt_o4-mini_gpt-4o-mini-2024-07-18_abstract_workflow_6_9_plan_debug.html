    <pre>Related original question:

Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfracmn$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 9: Calculate the probability of winning the grand prize given she wins a prize. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent N9SE:
We want P(grand prize ∣ any prize). By definition: P(G|A) = P(G ∧ A) / P(A). Since winning the grand prize implies winning a prize, P(G ∧ A) = P(G). From sub-task 8, P(G) = 1/210. From sub-task 7, P(A) = 23/42.

Thus
P(G|A) = (1/210) ÷ (23/42) = (1/210) × (42/23).
Simplify 42/210 = 1/5, so the result is 1/(5×23) = 1/115.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent N9SE:
1/115

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 10: Determine m and n from probability and calculate m+n. 

 then justify completely and detailedly, step-by-step why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. 
                If stuck in loop and cannot to solve this problem, stop and add [TOO HARD] in the last position.
                Again, your task is only to answer the question Sub-task 10: Determine m and n from probability and calculate m+n. and explaination.</pre>

    <pre>From Sub-task 9 we found P(grand prize ∣ prize) = 1/115. In that fraction m=1 and n=115 are relatively prime. Therefore m+n = 1 + 115 = 116.
