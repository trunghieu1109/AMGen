    <pre>Related original question:

Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfracmn$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 5: Express the conditional probability as a simplified fraction and find sum of numerator and denominator. 

 ### thinking #3 by Debate Agent TDni:
Step 1: From Sub-task 4, the conditional probability of winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is \(1/115\).
Step 2: To simplify the fraction 1/115, compute gcd(1,115). Since the only positive divisor of 1 is 1 and 115 is not divisible by any number greater than 1 that divides 1, gcd(1,115)=1. Therefore the fraction is already in lowest terms with m=1 and n=115.
Step 3: Compute the sum m+n = 1 + 115 = 116.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent oq4Y:
Step 1: From Sub-task 4, we know the conditional probability P(grand prize | prize) = 1/115.
Step 2: Identify the numerator m = 1 and the denominator n = 115.
Step 3: Check that gcd(1,115) = 1, so the fraction 1/115 is already in simplest form.
Step 4: Compute the sum m + n = 1 + 115 = 116.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 5: Make final decision on fraction and m+n. 

 then justify completely and detailedly, step-by-step why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. 
                If stuck in loop and cannot to solve this problem, stop and add [TOO HARD] in the last position.
                Again, your task is only to answer the question Sub-task 5: Make final decision on fraction and m+n. and explaination.</pre>

    <pre>Step 1: From the previous sub‚Äêtask, the conditional probability of winning the grand prize given that a prize was won is 1/115.
Step 2: Identify the numerator m = 1 and the denominator n = 115.
Step 3: Check gcd(1,115). Since the only positive divisor of 1 is 1, gcd(1,115) = 1, so the fraction is already in lowest terms.
Step 4: Compute m + n = 1 + 115 = 116.
Therefore, the simplified fraction is 1/115 and m + n = 116.

Answer:The simplified fraction is 1/115 and m+n = 116.</pre>
