        "response": "We need to count all 2\u00d73 digit grids satisfying: (1) The sum of the two 3-digit numbers formed by the rows equals 999. (2) The sum of the three 2-digit numbers formed by the columns equals 99.\n\nStep 1: Let the top row digits be A1,A2,A3 and the bottom row be B1,B2,B3.\nStep 2: The horizontal condition A1A2A3 + B1B2B3 = 999 in column\u2010wise addition forces, with no overflow beyond 3 digits, Ai + Bi = 9 for each i=1,2,3.\nStep 3: The vertical condition A1B1 + A2B2 + A3B3 = 99.  Each column number is 10\u00b7Ai + Bi, so\n  10(A1+A2+A3) + (B1+B2+B3) = 99.\nStep 4: Substitute Bi = 9 \u2212 Ai.  Then B1+B2+B3 = 27 \u2212 (A1+A2+A3).  Let S = A1+A2+A3.  The vertical sum becomes\n  10\u00b7S + (27 \u2212 S) = 99  \u21d2  9S + 27 = 99  \u21d2  9S = 72  \u21d2  S = 8.\nStep 5: We now count nonnegative integer solutions to A1+A2+A3 = 8 with 0 \u2264 Ai \u2264 9.  Since 8<10, the upper bounds are nonbinding.  By stars\u2010and\u2010bars, the number of solutions is C(8+3\u22121,3\u22121) = C(10,2) = 45.\nStep 6: For each such (A1,A2,A3), set Bi = 9 \u2212 Ai, which lies in [0,9].  Each yields a valid grid meeting both conditions.  Therefore the total number of unique configurations is 45.\n\nAnswer:45",
