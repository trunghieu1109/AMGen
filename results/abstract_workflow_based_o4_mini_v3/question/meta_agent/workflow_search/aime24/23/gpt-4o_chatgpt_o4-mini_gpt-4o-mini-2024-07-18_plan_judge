Question: Find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid so that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is $999$, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is $99$. The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$.
\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\ \hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\ \hline \end{array}\]

proposed answer: We need to count all 2×3 digit grids satisfying: (1) The sum of the two 3-digit numbers formed by the rows equals 999. (2) The sum of the three 2-digit numbers formed by the columns equals 99.

Step 1: Let the top row digits be A1,A2,A3 and the bottom row be B1,B2,B3.
Step 2: The horizontal condition A1A2A3 + B1B2B3 = 999 in column‐wise addition forces, with no overflow beyond 3 digits, Ai + Bi = 9 for each i=1,2,3.
Step 3: The vertical condition A1B1 + A2B2 + A3B3 = 99.  Each column number is 10·Ai + Bi, so
  10(A1+A2+A3) + (B1+B2+B3) = 99.
Step 4: Substitute Bi = 9 − Ai.  Then B1+B2+B3 = 27 − (A1+A2+A3).  Let S = A1+A2+A3.  The vertical sum becomes
  10·S + (27 − S) = 99  ⇒  9S + 27 = 99  ⇒  9S = 72  ⇒  S = 8.
Step 5: We now count nonnegative integer solutions to A1+A2+A3 = 8 with 0 ≤ Ai ≤ 9.  Since 8<10, the upper bounds are nonbinding.  By stars‐and‐bars, the number of solutions is C(8+3−1,3−1) = C(10,2) = 45.
Step 6: For each such (A1,A2,A3), set Bi = 9 − Ai, which lies in [0,9].  Each yields a valid grid meeting both conditions.  Therefore the total number of unique configurations is 45.
