Then sin A=√(1–(11/25)²)=6√14/25. 3. Area Δ=(1/2)·AB·AC·sin A=(1/2)·5·10·(6√14/25)=6√14. 4. Circumradius R=ABC/(4Δ)=(5·9·10)/(4·6√14)=(75√14)/56. 5.

First, we have triangle ABC inscribed in its circumcircle ω.  At points B and C on ω we draw tangents to ω; these tangents meet at an external point D.  By the definition of a tangent, DB ⟂ OB and DC ⟂ OC, where O is the center of ω.  The line AD meets ω again at a second point P (distinct from A).  Thus P is defined as the second intersection of line AD with ω.  In many treatments this configuration is recognized as relating poles and polars: D is the pole of line BC, and line BC is the polar of D.  Because A lies on the polar of D, it follows by La Hire’s theorem that D lies on the polar of A, namely line BP•CP, so AD meets ω again at P.  This verifies the configuration is well–defined (D is indeed external, AD does intersect ω a second time) and interprets the relationships (tangents, polars, and the second intersection).; answer: The configuration is valid.  Triangle ABC is inscribed in circle ω; the tangents at B and C meet at an external point D; the line AD intersects ω again at a unique second point P.  Equivalently, D is the pole of BC with respect to ω, and P is the second intersection of the polar of D through A with ω.\nCoT-SC agent VDri, calculating power of D, thinking: We wish to compute the power of point D with respect to the circumcircle ω of ΔABC.  By definition, since DB and DC are tangents from D to ω, the power is DB²=DC².  To find DB, observe that in ΔDBC we have DB=DC, so it is isosceles with base BC=9.  Next, the angle between the tangents satisfies ∠BDC=180°–∠BOC, where O is the circumcenter.  But ∠BOC=2∠BAC, so ∠BDC=180°–2A.  Apply the Law of Cosines in ΔDBC:\n\n  BC²=DB²+DC²–2·DB·DC·cos(∠BDC)\n  9²=2·x²–2·x²·cos(180°–2A)\n  =2x²+2x²·cos(2A)\n  =2x²(1+cos2A)\n  =4x²·cos²A,\n\nsince 1+cos2A=2cos²A.  Thus x²=81/(4cos²A).  From ΔABC with sides AB=5, AC=10, BC=9,\n\n  cosA=(AB²+AC²–BC²)/(2·AB·AC)=(25+100–81)/(2·5·10)=44/100=11/25,\n\nso cos²A=121/625.  Therefore\n\n  x²=81/(4·121/625)=81·625/(4·121)=50625/484.\n\nHence the power of D is DB²=DC²=50625/484.; answer: 50625/484\nCoT-SC agent iZAl, calculating power of D, thinking: We are given triangle ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10, inscribed in its circumcircle ω. Point D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C to ω. The power of point D with respect to ω is DB² (or DC²), since DB and DC are tangent segments.\n\n1. In triangle ABC, compute angle A via the Law of Cosines:\n   cos A = (AB² + AC² – BC²) / (2·AB·AC) = (25 + 100 – 81) / (2·5·10) = 44/100 = 11/25.\n\n2. The central angle BOC of ω subtending chord BC has measure φ = 2A.  In triangle BDC (formed by the two tangents and chord BC), DB = DC and ∠BDC = 180° – φ, so the base angles at B and C are φ/2 each.\n\n3. By the Law of Sines in ΔBDC:\n   BC / sin(∠BDC) = DB / sin(φ/2)\n   ⇒ DB = BC·sin(φ/2) / sin(φ).\n   Since φ = 2A, sin(φ/2) = sin(A) and sin(φ) = sin(2A) = 2 sin(A) cos(A),\n   so DB = 9·sin(A) / (2 sin(A) cos(A)) = 9 / (2 cos(A)).\n\n4. Substitute cos(A) = 11/25:\n   DB = 9 / [2·(11/25)] = 9·25/22 = 225/22.\n\n5. Therefore the power of D is DB² = (225/22)² = 50625/484.; answer: 50625/484\nCoT-SC agent VyyR, calculating power of D, thinking: We need the power of D relative to ω. Since DB and DC are tangents from D, Power(D)=DB·DC=DB² (because DB=DC). To find DB, consider triangle BDC. We know BC=9, and ∠DBC and ∠DCB can be found from ∠A in triangle ABC. In ΔABC, with sides 5,9,10, Heron’s formula gives area Δ=6√14, so sin A=(6√14)/25 and cos A=11/25. Then angles at B and C in ΔBDC satisfy ∠DBC=∠DCB=A. By Law of Sines in ΔBDC: DB/sin(∠DCB)=BC/sin(∠BDC). Here ∠DCB=A and ∠BDC=180−2A, so\nDB = BC·sin A/sin(2A) = 9·sin A/(2 sin A cos A) = 9/(2 cos A) = 9/(2·11/25) = 225/22.\nTherefore Power(D) = DB² = (225/22)² = 50625/484.; answer: 50625/484\nReflexion CoT agent 75n5, using intersecting chords theorem, thinking: By the intersecting‐chords (power of a point) theorem for two secants from an external point D: the product of the lengths from D to the circle along each secant is equal. Here one secant is DB (tangent, counted twice) and the other is the full secant through A and P. Thus\n  (DB)² = (DA)·(DP).\nBut along line D–A–P we have DP = DA + AP. Substituting gives\n  (DA)·(DA + AP) = (DB)²,\nwhich is the desired relation.; answer: DA·DP = DB², so since DP = DA + AP we have DA(DA + AP) = DB².\nCritic agent MBKf, feedback on chords theorem, thinking: The solution correctly invokes the power‐of‐a‐point theorem at D: since DB is tangent to ω, DB² equals the product of the two segments of the secant through A and P.  That is exactly DA·DP = DB².; answer: DA·DP = DB², and since DP = DA + AP we obtain DA(DA + AP) = DB².\nReflexion CoT agent 75n5, refining chords relation, thinking: We apply the power‐of‐a‐point theorem at external point D with respect to circle ω.  From D there are two lines meeting ω:\n\n1. The tangent DB (and likewise DC) gives power(D)=DB².\n2. The secant through A and P meets ω at A (closer) and P (farther). By the intersecting‐chords/secsnt theorem, the product of the distances from D to the two intersection points equals the power of D: DA·DP.\n\nHence we have the relation:\n  DA·DP = DB².\n\nFurther, since P lies on line AD beyond A, we note DP = DA + AP, yielding the expanded relation DA·(DA + AP) = DB².; answer: DA·DP = DB²\nCritic agent MBKf, feedback on chords theorem, thinking: Your intersecting‐chords (power of a point) setup is correct. From external point D the tangent DB satisfies DB²=power(D). A secant through A and P satisfies DA·DP=power(D). Noting DP=DA+AP gives the relation DA·(DA+AP)=DB².; answer: DA·DP=DB² with DP=DA+AP, hence DA(DA+AP)=DB²\nReflexion CoT agent 75n5, refining chords relation, thinking: 1. Identify D as an external point to circle ω.\n2. Recall the power of a point theorem: for any point D outside ω, the power is equal for any two lines through D meeting ω.\n3. The tangent DB satisfies power(D)=DB².\n4. The secant through A and P meets ω at A and P, so by the intersecting‐chords (or secant) theorem, DA·DP = power(D).\n5. Equate the two expressions for power(D) to get DA·DP = DB².\n6. Noting that P lies beyond A on line AD, we have DP = DA + AP, giving the expanded form DA·(DA + AP) = DB².; answer: DA·DP = DB²\nCritic agent MBKf, feedback on chords theorem, thinking: 1. D is outside circle ω.\n2. Tangents from D to ω are DB and DC, so DB = DC by the Two Tangents Theorem.\n3. By the Power of a Point theorem, the power of D is DB².\n4. The secant line through D, A, and P meets ω at A and P, so the Secant‐Tangent version of the Power of a Point gives DA · DP = power(D).\n5. Hence DA · DP = DB².\n6. Since A lies between D and P on the secant, we have DP = DA + AP, so DA·(DA + AP) = DB².\nThus the intersecting‐chords (secant) calculation DA·DP = DB² is fully justified.; answer: DA·DP = DB²\nReflexion CoT agent 75n5, refining chords relation, thinking: 1. Identify point D as external to circle ω since the tangents at B and C meet there outside the circle.\n2. Recall the Power of a Point theorem: for any point D outside a circle, the power of D with respect to the circle is equal along any line through D that meets the circle.\n3. One such line is the tangent DB (or DC), so power(D) = DB².\n4. Another line through D is the secant that passes through A and then meets ω again at P. By the secant–secant (or intersecting chords) theorem, the product of the distances from D to the two intersection points on ω equals the power of D. Here those distances are DA and DP, so DA·DP = power(D).\n5. Equate the two expressions for power(D): DB² = DA·DP.\n6. Since on the secant D–A–P we have DP = DA + AP, one may also write DA·(DA + AP) = DB², but the core intersecting chords relation is DA·DP = DB².; answer: DA·DP = DB²\nCoT agent 7blP, applying geometric properties, thinking: We need certain angles and the circumradius R of triangle ABC to proceed with power‐of‐a‐point and tangent‐secant relations later.

R=75/(4√14): rationalize the denominator by multiplying numerator and denominator by √14:\n   R = 75·√14/(4√14·√14) = 75√14/(4·14) = 75√14/56.\n\nSince gcd(75,56)=1, 75√14/56 is in lowest terms.

The first two are already in lowest terms since 11 and 25 share no factors and 6√14 and 25 share none. To simplify R, we rationalize its denominator: R=75/(4√14)·(√14/√14)=75√14/(4·14)=75√14/56. The numbers 75 and 56 are relatively prime (gcd=1), so this is fully reduced.; answer: cos A = 11/25, sin A = (6√14)/25, R = (75√14)/56\nDebate agent IiPh, round 1, simplifying AP, thinking: We begin with the results from Law of Cosines and Law of Sines: cos A=11/25, sin A=(6√14)/25, and R=75/(4√14). We must simplify each:\n\n1. cos A=11/25. 11 and 25 share no common factors; it is already in lowest terms.\n\n2. sin A=(6√14)/25. The integer 6 and 25 share no common factors, and √14 is already simplest as 14 has no square factors besides 1. Hence (6√14)/25 is in lowest terms.\n\n3. R=75/(4√14). To rationalize the denominator, multiply numerator and denominator by √14:\n   R = [75·√14] / [4√14·√14] = 75√14 / (4·14) = 75√14 / 56.\nSince gcd(75,56)=1, this fraction is fully reduced.\n\nThus the simplest radical forms for subsequent AP calculation are:\ncos A=11/25, sin A=6√14/25, and R=75√14/56.; answer: cos A = 11/25, sin A = 6√14/25, R = 75√14/56\nDebate agent ZA9c, round 1, simplifying AP, thinking: We start with the intermediate results: cos A = 11/25, sin A = (6√14)/25, and R = 75/(4√14).  We check each for possible simplification:\n\n1. cos A = 11/25.  The numerator 11 and denominator 25 share no common factors (11 is prime and does not divide 25), so this is already in lowest terms.\n\n2. sin A = (6√14)/25.  The integer 6 and 25 share no common factors (gcd(6,25)=1), and √14 is irrational—there are no like terms to cancel—so this is also in simplest form.\n\n3. R = 75/(4√14).  We rationalize the denominator to eliminate √14:\n   • Multiply numerator and denominator by √14, giving (75·√14)/(4√14·√14) = 75√14/(4·14) = 75√14/56.\n   • Check gcd(75,56): factors of 75 are 3·5·5, factors of 56 are 2·2·2·7; they share no common factors, so gcd=1.
