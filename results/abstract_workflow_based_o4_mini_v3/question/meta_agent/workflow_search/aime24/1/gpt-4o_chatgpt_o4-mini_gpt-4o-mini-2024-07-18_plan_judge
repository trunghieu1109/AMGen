Question: Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.

proposed answer: 1. In ΔABC with AB=5, AC=10, BC=9, Law of Cosines gives cos A=(AB²+AC²–BC²)/(2·AB·AC)=(25+100–81)/100=11/25. 2. Then sin A=√(1–(11/25)²)=6√14/25. 3. Area Δ=(1/2)·AB·AC·sin A=(1/2)·5·10·(6√14/25)=6√14. 4. Circumradius R=ABC/(4Δ)=(5·9·10)/(4·6√14)=(75√14)/56. 5. The intersection D of tangents at B,C satisfies DB=R·tan A=(75√14/56)·(6√14/11)=225/22. 6. By power of point D: DA·DP=DB²=(225/22)² and DP=DA+AP; solving yields AP=225/44. 7. Thus m=225, n=44, so m+n=269.

proposed answer: We apply the power‐of‐a‐point theorem at D, where the tangents from D to the circumcircle ω at B and C satisfy DB²=DA·DP. Since P lies between D and A on line DA, DP=DA−AP, so
  DB²=DA(DA−AP)=DA²−DA·AP
⇒DA·AP=DA²−DB²
⇒AP=(DA²−DB²)/DA.

1.  Coordinate setup:
   Let B=(0,0), C=(9,0).  Solve for A from AB=5 and AC=10:
     x²+y²=25,
     (x−9)²+y²=100
   Subtracting gives 18x−81=−75⇒x=1/3, then y=4√14/3.  So A=(1/3,4√14/3).

2.  Circumcenter O and radius R:
   Since BC is horizontal of length 9, its midpoint is (4.5,0).  The perpendicular bisector of BC is vertical x=4.5.  The circumcenter also lies on the perpendicular bisector of AB.  Solving yields O=(4.5,33/(4√14)), and R=75/(4√14).

3.  Tangents at B and C:
   The slope of BO is (33/(4√14)) / 4.5 = 11/(6√14), so the tangent at B has slope −6√14/11.  Likewise at C the tangent slope is +6√14/11.  Their intersection D solves
     y=−(6√14/11)x
     y=(6√14/11)(x−9)
   giving x=4.5, y=−27√14/11.  So D=(4.5,−27√14/11).

4.  Compute lengths:
   DB²=(4.5−0)²+(−27√14/11−0)²=20.25+ (27√14/11)²=50625/484.
   DA²=(4.5−1/3)²+(−27√14/11−4√14/3)²
       =(25/6)²+(−125√14/33)²=105625/484,
   so DA=√(105625/484)=325/22.

5.  Compute AP:
   DA²−DB²=(105625−50625)/484=55000/484=13750/121,
   AP=(13750/121)/(325/22)=(13750·22)/(121·325)=12100/1573.

6.  Reduce 12100/1573: gcd(12100,1573)=11 ⇒1100/143, again gcd=11⇒100/13.  Thus AP=100/13, so m=100, n=13, and m+n=113.
