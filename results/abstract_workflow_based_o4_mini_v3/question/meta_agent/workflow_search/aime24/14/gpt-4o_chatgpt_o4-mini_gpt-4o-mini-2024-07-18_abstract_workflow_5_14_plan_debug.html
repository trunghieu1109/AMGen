    <pre>Related original question:

Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\fracx^220- \fracy^224 = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 6: Determine the conditions or configurations when BD^2 is maximized, such that all points still comply with the properties of the hyperbola and the rhombus. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent 42mV:
We have BD^2 = 80 + (22/3) y_B^2, from the hyperbola relation x_B^2 = 20 + (5/6)y_B^2. As y_B grows without bound, BD^2 grows without bound as well. There is no finite upper bound or maximum value of BD^2 over all rhombi inscribed in the hyperbola with diagonals through the origin. Concretely, as the vertex B moves farther out along the right‐branch of the hyperbola, its coordinates satisfy y_B→±∞ and x_B→±∞ according to the asymptote y = ±√(6/5) x. In that limit the rhombus still closes (C, D are the reflections across axes), its diagonals remain perpendicular, and BD^2→∞. Thus BD^2 is unbounded above. The “configuration” that makes BD^2 as large as possible is simply pushing B (and hence D) arbitrarily far out along the hyperbola toward its asymptotes. No finite extremal configuration exists.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent 42mV:
There is no finite maximum: BD^2 is unbounded and tends to ∞ as B (and D) recede along the hyperbola toward its asymptotes.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 7: Convert the final results of the previous subtask into the greatest real number that is less than the maximum calculated BD^2. 

 then justify completely and detailedly, step-by-step why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. 
                If stuck in loop and cannot to solve this problem, stop and add [TOO HARD] in the last position.
                Again, your task is only to answer the question Sub-task 7: Convert the final results of the previous subtask into the greatest real number that is less than the maximum calculated BD^2. and explaination.</pre>

    <pre>The previous subtask established that BD² grows without bound along the hyperbola and tends to ∞, so there is no finite maximum. The question now asks: “Convert the final results of the previous subtask into the greatest real number that is less than the maximum calculated BD².” Since the supremum of BD² is ∞, for any real number M one has M &lt; ∞, but given any candidate M there is always a larger real number M′ with M &lt; M′ &lt; ∞. Hence there can be no greatest real number below ∞. In other words, no real number can serve as the largest number less than ∞.

Answer:No such real number exists.</pre>
