As y_B grows without bound, BD^2 grows without bound as well. There is no finite upper bound or maximum value of BD^2 over all rhombi inscribed in the hyperbola with diagonals through the origin. Concretely, as the vertex B moves farther out along the right‐branch of the hyperbola, its coordinates satisfy y_B→±∞ and x_B→±∞ according to the asymptote y = ±√(6/5) x. In that limit the rhombus still closes (C, D are the reflections across axes), its diagonals remain perpendicular, and BD^2→∞. Thus BD^2 is unbounded above. The “configuration” that makes BD^2 as large as possible is simply pushing B (and hence D) arbitrarily far out along the hyperbola toward its asymptotes.

From Sub-task 3 we have A=(2√30,2√30), C=–A, B=(2√30,–2√30), D=–B.  \n2. Vector AC = C–A = (–2√30–2√30,–2√30–2√30) = (–4√30,–4√30). Its length is\n   |AC| = √[(–4√30)²+(–4√30)²] = √[16·30 +16·30] = √960 = 8√15.  \n3. Similarly, BD = D–B = (–2√30–2√30, 2√30–(–2√30)) = (–4√30,4√30), so |BD|=√960=8√15.  \n4. Note that x_A²+y_A² =120+120=240 is fixed by the hyperbola equation x²/20–y²/24=1. Hence both diagonals have the same constant length 2√(x_A²+y_A²)=2√240=8√15 for any such rhombus.; answer: AC = 8√15, BD = 8√15; these arise because x_A² + y_A² =240 is fixed by the hyperbola, making both diagonals of the rhombus constant.\nCritic agent MjXg, providing feedback on diagonal length calculation, thinking: The computation starting from A=(2√30,2√30) and concluding AC=BD=8√15 only covers one special symmetric choice of vertices and rests on the incorrect assumption that x_A²+y_A² is fixed for all points on the hyperbola. In fact x²+y² varies with the point’s parameter, and a rhombus need not have equal diagonals unless it is oriented exactly at 45° as in the example. Thus the result AC=BD=8√15 does not hold in general.; answer: Take a general point on x²/20–y²/24=1 in parametric form x=√20 cosh\u2009u, y=√24 sinh\u2009u.

Sub-task 3 gave one convenient choice: A=(2√30,2√30), B=(2√30,−2√30), C=−A, D=−B, and we verified A lies on x²/20−y²/24=1 because 120/20−120/24=6−5=1.  \n2.

Note that for this special symmetric choice x_A²+y_A²=120+120=240, so each diagonal has length 2√240=8√15.  \n7. This uses the hyperbola relation to fix x²−(20/24)y²=20, and in the special case y=±x one finds x²=120.; answer: AC = 8√15, BD = 8√15. These arise from the coordinates A=(2√30,2√30), C=−A, B=(2√30,−2√30), D=−B by direct distance computation.\nCritic agent MjXg, providing feedback on diagonal length calculation, thinking: The computation AC=8√15 and BD=8√15 is arithmetically correct for the specific choice A=(2√30,2√30) and B=(2√30,−2√30). However, it relies on the special assumption y=±x (so that x²+y²=240) and the imposed symmetry A→−A, B→−B. This restriction means the result does not cover all possible rhombi inscribed in the hyperbola whose diagonals meet at the origin. In the general case one must use AC=2√(x_A²+y_A²) and BD=2√(x_B²+y_B²) with (x_A,y_A),(x_B,y_B) satisfying the hyperbola equation and optimize BD² over all such choices. The value 8√15 is just one instance, not the universal maximum or minimum for BD.; answer: General diagonal formulas: \nAC = 2·√(x_A² + y_A²),\nBD = 2·√(x_B² + y_B²),\nwhere (x_A,y_A) and (x_B,y_B) lie on x²/20 − y²/24 = 1 and are paired so that ABCD is a rhombus with diagonals through the origin. The special numeric result 8√15 arises only when x²+y²=240 (i.e. y=±x), and must be replaced by an optimization over all valid points to solve the original problem.\nReflexion CoT agent 6Vaf, refinement of diagonal lengths, thinking: 1.

The diagonal AC is the vector C−A=(−x_A−x_A,−y_A−y_A)=(−2x_A,−2y_A), so its length is |AC|=2√(x_A²+y_A²).  \n3. Similarly, BD=D−B=(−x_B−x_B,−y_B−y_B)=(−2x_B,−2y_B), so |BD|=2√(x_B²+y_B²).  \n4. Each point (x_i,y_i) lies on x_i²/20−y_i²/24=1, so x_i²=20+(20/24)y_i²=20+(5/6)y_i².  \n5. Hence x_i²+y_i²=20+(5/6)y_i²+y_i²=20+(11/6)y_i².  \n6.

In the special symmetric case y_i=±x_i one recovers x_i²=y_i²=120 and AC=BD=8√15, but in general the diagonal lengths vary according to y_A and y_B subject to the hyperbola equation.; answer: AC = 2√(x_A² + y_A²), BD = 2√(x_B² + y_B²); using the hyperbola x²/20 − y²/24 = 1 yields x_i² + y_i² = 20 + (11/6)y_i², so AC = 2√(20 + (11/6)y_A²), BD = 2√(20 + (11/6)y_B²).\nCritic agent MjXg, providing feedback on diagonal length calculation, thinking: The derivation of AC=2√(20+(11/6)y_A²) and BD=2√(20+(11/6)y_B²) from x_i²/20−y_i²/24=1 is algebraically correct, but it ignores the key rhombus condition that the diagonals must be perpendicular. By treating y_A and y_B as independent, no relation is enforced between A and B and hence no bound on BD² can be derived.; answer: To fix this, one must impose AC⊥BD ⇒ (x_A,y_A)·(x_B,y_B)=0. Using x_i²=20+(5/6)y_i² this gives x_A x_B + y_A y_B=0, linking y_A and y_B.

The diagonal AC is the vector C−A=(−x_A−x_A,−y_A−y_A)=(−2x_A,−2y_A), so its length is |AC|=√[(−2x_A)²+(−2y_A)²]=2√(x_A²+y_A²).\n3.

On the hyperbola x_B²/20−y_B²/24=1 we get x_B²+y_B²=20+(11/6)y_B², so\n   BD² = 4(x_B²+y_B²) = 4[20+(11/6)y_B²] = 80 + (22/3)y_B².\nNext, the condition that ABCD is a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin forces the diagonals AC and BD to be perpendicular.

Eliminating y_A² gives\n   BD² = 80 + 4400·(y_A²+24)/(11y_A²−600).\nViewing y_A² as a parameter >600/11, one checks that BD² is strictly decreasing in y_A² for y_A²>600/11, and that as y_A²→∞, BD²→480.\nHence for every admissible rhombus BD²>480, and 480 is the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi.; answer: BD² = 80 + \\tfrac{22}{3}y_B², and one shows from the perpendicular‐diagonals condition that BD² > 480, with 480 the greatest lower bound.\nDebate agent yTPv, round 1, defining BD^2 constraints, thinking: 1.

Therefore\n   BD²=4[20+(11/6)y_B²]=80+(22/3)y_B².\n4. The rhombus condition (perpendicular diagonals) gives A·B=0, which imposes a relation between y_A and y_B.  Eliminating y_A leads to BD² as a decreasing function of y_A² on its domain and shows that as y_A²→∞, BD²→480⁺, while as y_A² approaches its lower limit BD²→+∞.\n5.

The infimum of BD^2 over all such rhombi is 480, and BD^2>480 in every case.; answer: BD^2 = 80 + \\frac{22}{3}y_B^2, with the constraint BD^2 > 480 (there is no finite maximum; the greatest real number strictly less than all BD^2 is 480).\nCoT agent 42mV, finding max configurations for BD^2, thinking: We have BD^2 = 80 + (22/3) y_B^2, from the hyperbola relation x_B^2 = 20 + (5/6)y_B^2. As y_B grows without bound, BD^2 grows without bound as well. There is no finite upper bound or maximum value of BD^2 over all rhombi inscribed in the hyperbola with diagonals through the origin. Concretely, as the vertex B moves farther out along the right‐branch of the hyperbola, its coordinates satisfy y_B→±∞ and x_B→±∞ according to the asymptote y = ±√(6/5) x. In that limit the rhombus still closes (C, D are the reflections across axes), its diagonals remain perpendicular, and BD^2→∞. Thus BD^2 is unbounded above. The “configuration” that makes BD^2 as large as possible is simply pushing B (and hence D) arbitrarily far out along the hyperbola toward its asymptotes. No finite extremal configuration exists.; answer: There is no finite maximum: BD^2 is unbounded and tends to ∞ as B (and D) recede along the hyperbola toward its asymptotes.\nFinal Decision agent, calculating greatest real number of BD^2, thinking: The previous subtask established that BD² grows without bound along the hyperbola and tends to ∞, so there is no finite maximum. The question now asks: “Convert the final results of the previous subtask into the greatest real number that is less than the maximum calculated BD².” Since the supremum of BD² is ∞, for any real number M one has M < ∞, but given any candidate M there is always a larger real number M′ with M < M′ < ∞. Hence there can be no greatest real number below ∞. In other words, no real number can serve as the largest number less than ∞.; answer: No such real number exists.', iteration_idx=-1)]
