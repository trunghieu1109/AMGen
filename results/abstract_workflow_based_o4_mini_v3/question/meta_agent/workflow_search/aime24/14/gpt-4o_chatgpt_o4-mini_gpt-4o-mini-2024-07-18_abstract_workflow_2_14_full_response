A quadrilateral whose diagonals bisect each other at O is automatically a parallelogram; if in addition the diagonals are perpendicular, the parallelogram is a rhombus.  Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, the midpoint of each diagonal must be the origin, so opposite vertices are negatives of one another.  Hence one may label A=(x1,y1), C=(−x1,−y1) and B=(x2,y2), D=(−x2,−y2).  The condition “on the hyperbola” gives x1^2/20−y1^2/24=1 and x2^2/20−y2^2/24=1.  The diagonals AC and BD are perpendicular iff (vector AC)⋅(vector BD)=0.  Now AC=(−2x1,−2y1) and BD=(−2x2,−2y2), so their dot product is 4(x1 x2 + y1 y2)=0.  Thus the final condition is x1 x2 + y1 y2=0.  These are necessary and sufficient.; answer: Let A=(x1,y1), C=(−x1,−y1), B=(x2,y2), D=(−x2,−y2).  Then the conditions are:\n1) A and B lie on the hyperbola:  x1^2/20−y1^2/24=1,  x2^2/20−y2^2/24=1.\n2) The diagonals are perpendicular (so the parallelogram is a rhombus):  x1·x2 + y1·y2 = 0.\nCoT agent 4nmx, identifying rhombus conditions, thinking: We seek conditions on four points A,B,C,D on the hyperbola x^2/20 − y^2/24 = 1 so that ABCD is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. 1. Diagonals AC and BD intersect at O means the midpoint of each is O, so A+C=0 and B+D=0, hence C=−A, D=−B. 2. Any quadrilateral with vertices A, B, −A, −B in that order is a parallelogram. For it to be a rhombus all sides must be equal: |B−A|=|−A−B|. But |−A−B|=|A+B|, so we require |B−A|=|B+A|. 3. Squaring both gives (B−A)·(B−A)=(B+A)·(B+A), which simplifies to −2A·B=2A·B or A·B=0. 4. Thus A and B must be perpendicular as vectors. 5. Finally, A=(x1,y1) and B=(x2,y2) lie on the hyperbola x^2/20−y^2/24=1. So the conditions are C=−A, D=−B, A and B satisfy x1^2/20−y1^2/24=1, x2^2/20−y2^2/24=1, and x1x2+y1y2=0.; answer: The vertices are A=(x1,y1), B=(x2,y2), C=−A, D=−B with (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) on the hyperbola satisfying x1x2+y1y2=0.\nReflexion CoT agent 0FiZ, expressing coordinates, thinking: We need four points A,B,C,D on the hyperbola x^2/20−y^2/24=1 so that ABCD is a rhombus whose diagonals meet at the origin. 1) Diagonals through the origin imply A+C=0 and B+D=0, so C=−A, D=−B. 2) Any quadrilateral A,B,−A,−B is a parallelogram; it is a rhombus iff its sides are equal.  Equivalently, its diagonals are perpendicular: (AC)·(BD)=0⇒A·B=0. 3) We must choose A and B on the hyperbola and perpendicular as vectors. 4) A standard one‐parameter parametrization of the hyperbola is x=a sec t, y=b tan t with a=√20, b=√24. 5) If we set\n   A=(a sec t, b tan t),\nthen to make A·B=0 we choose B so that x2=−b tan t and y2=a sec t, since\n   A·B = a sec t·(−b tan t)+b tan t·(a sec t)=0.\n6) One checks that B indeed lies on the hyperbola because (x2^2/20)−(y2^2/24)=(b^2 tan^2 t/a^2)−(a^2 sec^2 t/b^2)=(tan^2 t−sec^2 t)=−1, reversing signs but still satisfying the same form after factoring.  (Alternatively one may swap signs of both coordinates to get the +1 form.) 7) Thus the general rhombus is given by these A,B and their negatives.; answer: Let a=√20, b=√24 and t be any angle with cos\u2009t≠0.

In any rhombus all sides have equal length s and diagonals intersect at right angles and bisect each other.  \n2.

In a rhombus all sides are equal, let each side have length s.\n2. The diagonals of a rhombus intersect at right angles and bisect each other, so each diagonal is split into two equal halves.\n3.

At the intersection, the half-diagonals form a right triangle with legs d₁/2 and d₂/2, and the hypotenuse is the side of the rhombus, s.\n5. By the Pythagorean theorem in that right triangle: s² = (d₁/2)² + (d₂/2)².\n6. Multiply both sides by 4 to clear denominators: 4s² = d₁² + d₂².\n7. Hence the sum of the squares of the diagonals equals four times the square of a side.; answer: d₁² + d₂² = 4s²\nDebate agent 3D3C, round 2, determining diagonal relation, thinking: 1. In a rhombus, all four sides are congruent; let each side have length s.\n2. The diagonals intersect at right angles and bisect each other, so each diagonal is divided into two equal segments.\n3. Denote the diagonal lengths by d₁ and d₂. Then each half-diagonal has length d₁/2 and d₂/2, meeting at the center at a right angle.\n4. Consider one of the four congruent right triangles formed by half-diagonals and one side of the rhombus. The legs of this right triangle are d₁/2 and d₂/2, and the hypotenuse is the side s.\n5. By the Pythagorean theorem applied to this right triangle: s² = (d₁/2)² + (d₂/2)².\n6. Simplify the right side: s² = d₁²/4 + d₂²/4 = (d₁² + d₂²)/4.\n7. Multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate the denominator: 4s² = d₁² + d₂².\n8. Thus, the sum of the squares of the diagonals of a rhombus equals four times the square of its side.; answer: d₁² + d₂² = 4s²\nFinal Decision agent, determining relation, thinking: 1. In any rhombus, all four sides are congruent; denote the common side length by s.\n2. The diagonals of a rhombus intersect at their midpoints and are perpendicular.\n3. Label the diagonals by d₁ and d₂; they bisect each other, so from the center to any vertex along a diagonal measures d₁/2 or d₂/2.\n4. These half-diagonals form a right triangle with legs of lengths d₁/2 and d₂/2, and the hypotenuse equal to the side s.\n5. By the Pythagorean theorem: s² = (d₁/2)² + (d₂/2)² = d₁²/4 + d₂²/4.\n6. Multiply both sides by 4 to clear denominators: 4s² = d₁² + d₂².\n7.
