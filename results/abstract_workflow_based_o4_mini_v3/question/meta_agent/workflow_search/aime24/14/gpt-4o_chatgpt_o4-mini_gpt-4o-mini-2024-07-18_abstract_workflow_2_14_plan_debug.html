    <pre>Related original question:

Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\fracx^220- \fracy^224 = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi..

 ### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent OzEv:
We place A and C as opposite vertices of the rhombus with midpoint at the origin: A=(x,y) and C=(−x,−y), where x^2/20−y^2/24=1. Likewise B=(u,v) and D=(−u,−v) on the same hyperbola, so u^2/20−v^2/24=1. Rhombus side‐length equality AB=BC gives:
(u−x)^2+(v−y)^2=(u+x)^2+(v+y)^2, which simplifies to uv=xy.

Parametrize the hyperbola by x=√20 cosh t, y=√24 sinh t, and likewise u=√20 cosh s, v=√24 sinh s. Then uv=xy ⇒cosh s sinh s=cosh t sinh t ⇒s=±t.  Either way cosh s=cosh t and sinh s=±sinh t.

The diagonal BD goes from B to D=(−u,−v), so
BD^2=(−u−u)^2+(−v−v)^2=4(u^2+v^2).
But u^2+v^2=20 cosh^2 t+24 sinh^2 t=22 cosh2t−2. Hence
BD^2=4(22 cosh2t−2)=88 cosh2t−8,
or
BD=2√(22 cosh2t−2).


### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent OzEv:
BD=2√(22 cosh2t−2)

Given the above, answer the following question: Determine maximum value for BD^2 and greatest real number less than this max. 

 then justify completely and detailedly, step-by-step why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. 
                If stuck in loop and cannot to solve this problem, stop and add [TOO HARD] in the last position.
                Again, your task is only to answer the question Determine maximum value for BD^2 and greatest real number less than this max. and explaination.</pre>

    <pre>We have BD^2=88 cosh2t−8, where t∈ℝ.  Since cosh2t≥1 for all real t and grows without bound as |t|→∞, BD^2 attains its minimum when cosh2t=1 (i.e. t=0) and increases to infinity.  Thus: 1. There is no finite maximum of BD^2; its supremum is +∞. 2. The greatest real number that is less than BD^2 for every rhombus (i.e. the infimum of BD^2) occurs at t=0 and equals 88·1−8=80.

Answer:No finite maximum (BD^2→∞).  Greatest real number less than BD^2 for all such rhombi is 80.</pre>
