Question: Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.

proposed answer: We have BD^2=88 cosh2t−8, where t∈ℝ.  Since cosh2t≥1 for all real t and grows without bound as |t|→∞, BD^2 attains its minimum when cosh2t=1 (i.e. t=0) and increases to infinity.  Thus: 1. There is no finite maximum of BD^2; its supremum is +∞. 2. The greatest real number that is less than BD^2 for every rhombus (i.e. the infimum of BD^2) occurs at t=0 and equals 88·1−8=80.

Answer:No finite maximum (BD^2→∞).  Greatest real number less than BD^2 for all such rhombi is 80.
Extracted answer: No finite maximum (BD^2→∞).  Greatest real number less than BD^2 for all such rhombi is 80.
Correct answer: 480

proposed answer: The previous subtask established that BD² grows without bound along the hyperbola and tends to ∞, so there is no finite maximum. The question now asks: “Convert the final results of the previous subtask into the greatest real number that is less than the maximum calculated BD².” Since the supremum of BD² is ∞, for any real number M one has M < ∞, but given any candidate M there is always a larger real number M′ with M < M′ < ∞. Hence there can be no greatest real number below ∞. In other words, no real number can serve as the largest number less than ∞.

Answer:No such real number exists.
Extracted answer: No such real number exists.
Correct answer: 480
