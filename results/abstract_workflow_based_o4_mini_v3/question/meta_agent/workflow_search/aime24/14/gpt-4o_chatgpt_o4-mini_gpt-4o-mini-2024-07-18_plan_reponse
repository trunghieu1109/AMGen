Since cosh2t\u22651 for all real t and grows without bound as |t|\u2192\u221e, BD^2 attains its minimum when cosh2t=1 (i.e. t=0) and increases to infinity.  Thus: 1. There is no finite maximum of BD^2; its supremum is +\u221e. 2. The greatest real number that is less than BD^2 for every rhombus (i.e. the infimum of BD^2) occurs at t=0 and equals 88\u00b71\u22128=80.\n\nAnswer:No finite maximum (BD^2\u2192\u221e).  Greatest real number less than BD^2 for all such rhombi is 80.",

The question now asks: \u201cConvert the final results of the previous subtask into the greatest real number that is less than the maximum calculated BD\u00b2.\u201d Since the supremum of BD\u00b2 is \u221e, for any real number M one has M < \u221e, but given any candidate M there is always a larger real number M\u2032 with M < M\u2032 < \u221e. Hence there can be no greatest real number below \u221e. In other words, no real number can serve as the largest number less than \u221e.\n\nAnswer:No such real number exists.",
