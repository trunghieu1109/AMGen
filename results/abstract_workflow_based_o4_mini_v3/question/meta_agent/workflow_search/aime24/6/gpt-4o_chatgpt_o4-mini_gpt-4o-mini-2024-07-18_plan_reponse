        "response": "We seek the smallest radius r of a sphere that can contain any rectangular box with surface area 54 and volume 23. Such a box has edges l,w,h satisfying\n  lw+lh+wh = 27   (since 2(lw+lh+wh)=54)\n  lwh = 23.\nAny containing sphere must have radius at least half the space diagonal d = \u221a(l\u00b2+w\u00b2+h\u00b2), so r\u00b2 = (l\u00b2+w\u00b2+h\u00b2)/4.  To cover all boxes in B we choose the box maximizing L = l\u00b2+w\u00b2+h\u00b2 under the two constraints.  By symmetry one finds the critical cases occur when two edges are equal, say l=w=a.  Then:\n  a\u00b2+2a h = 27,\n  a\u00b2 h = 23.\nFrom a\u00b2h=23 \u21d2 h=23/a\u00b2.  Plug into the first:  a\u00b2 + 46/a = 27 \u21d2 a\u00b3 \u221227a +46=0.  This factors as (a\u22122)(a\u00b2+2a\u221223)=0, giving positive roots a=2 or a=\u22121+2\u221a6\u22483.898.  The corresponding h are 23/4=5.75 and 23/(\u22121+2\u221a6)\u00b2\u22481.513.  Compute L in each case:\n  Case a=2,h=5.75: L = 2\u00b7(2\u00b2)+5.75\u00b2 = 8 + 33.0625 = 41.0625 = 657/16.\n  Case a\u22483.898,h\u22481.513: L \u2248 2\u00b715.191 + 2.290 = 32.672 < 41.0625.\nThus the maximal diagonal\u2010squared is 657/16, so r\u00b2 = (657/16)/4 = 657/64 in lowest terms.  Hence p=657, q=64, and p+q = 657+64 = 721.\n\nAnswer:721",
