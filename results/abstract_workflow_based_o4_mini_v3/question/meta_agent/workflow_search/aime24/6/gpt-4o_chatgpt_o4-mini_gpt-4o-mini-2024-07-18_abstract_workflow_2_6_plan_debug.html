    <pre>Related original question:

Let $\mathcalB$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcalB$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\fracpq$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 6: Compute the sum of the numerator and denominator of the simplified fraction obtained in subtask 5. 

 ### thinking #3 by Debate Agent VEAh:
1. From Sub-task 5, we have r² = (l² + w² + h²)/4.
2. In this fraction, the numerator p is l² + w² + h² and the denominator q is 4.
3. Sub-task 6 asks for the sum p + q.
4. Therefore, p + q = (l² + w² + h²) + 4.
5. No further simplification is possible because l, w, and h are variables.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent da1R:
Step 1: From Sub-task 5, we have r² expressed in simplest form as the fraction p/q = (l² + w² + h²)/4.
Step 2: Identify the numerator p = l² + w² + h² and the denominator q = 4.
Step 3: Sub-task 6 asks for the sum p + q.
Step 4: Compute p + q = (l² + w² + h²) + 4.
Step 5: Since l, w, and h are symbols without given numeric values, the final answer remains the symbolic expression l² + w² + h² + 4.

### answer #3 by Debate Agent VEAh:
l² + w² + h² + 4

### answer #3 by Debate Agent da1R:
l^2 + w^2 + h^2 + 4

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Decide on sum computation. 

 then justify completely and detailedly, step-by-step why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. 
                If stuck in loop and cannot to solve this problem, stop and add [TOO HARD] in the last position.
                Again, your task is only to answer the question Sub-task 6: Decide on sum computation. and explaination.</pre>

    <pre>We seek the smallest radius r of a sphere that can contain any rectangular box with surface area 54 and volume 23. Such a box has edges l,w,h satisfying
  lw+lh+wh = 27   (since 2(lw+lh+wh)=54)
  lwh = 23.
Any containing sphere must have radius at least half the space diagonal d = √(l²+w²+h²), so r² = (l²+w²+h²)/4.  To cover all boxes in B we choose the box maximizing L = l²+w²+h² under the two constraints.  By symmetry one finds the critical cases occur when two edges are equal, say l=w=a.  Then:
  a²+2a h = 27,
  a² h = 23.
From a²h=23 ⇒ h=23/a².  Plug into the first:  a² + 46/a = 27 ⇒ a³ −27a +46=0.  This factors as (a−2)(a²+2a−23)=0, giving positive roots a=2 or a=−1+2√6≈3.898.  The corresponding h are 23/4=5.75 and 23/(−1+2√6)²≈1.513.  Compute L in each case:
  Case a=2,h=5.75: L = 2·(2²)+5.75² = 8 + 33.0625 = 41.0625 = 657/16.
  Case a≈3.898,h≈1.513: L ≈ 2·15.191 + 2.290 = 32.672 &lt; 41.0625.
Thus the maximal diagonal‐squared is 657/16, so r² = (657/16)/4 = 657/64 in lowest terms.  Hence p=657, q=64, and p+q = 657+64 = 721.
