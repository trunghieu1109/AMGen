    <pre>Related original question:

Let $\mathcalB$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcalB$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\fracpq$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$..

### Sub-task 4: Make final decision on reduced fraction. 

 ### thinking by Final Decision Agent R2sJ:
1. For any rectangular box with edges x,y,z, the smallest enclosing sphere has radius r=½·√(x²+y²+z²), so r²=(x²+y²+z²)/4.
2. We must find the box in ℬ (xyz=23 and xy+yz+zx=27) that maximizes r², then express that maximum as a reduced fraction.
3. By symmetry in maximizing x²+y²+z² under fixed symmetric constraints, the extremum occurs when two edges are equal. Set y=z=t.
4. Volume constraint: x·t²=23 ⇒ x=23/t².
5. Surface‐sum constraint: xy+yz+zx = 2·x·t + t² =27 ⇒ 2·(23/t²)·t + t² =46/t + t² =27.
6. Multiply by t: t³ + 46 =27t ⇒ t³ −27t +46=0. Factor: (t−2)(t²+2t−23)=0. The positive root is t=2.
7. Then y=z=2 and x=23/2²=23/4.
8. Compute x²+y²+z² = (23/4)² + 2² + 2² =529/16 +4+4 =529/16 +128/16 =657/16.
9. Thus r²=(657/16)/4 =657/64. Check gcd(657,64)=1, so 657/64 is in lowest terms.

### answer by Final Decision Agent R2sJ:
657/64

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 5: Calculate p+q from the reduced fraction p/q obtained in Sub-task 4. 

 then justify completely and detailedly, step-by-step why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. 
                If stuck in loop and cannot to solve this problem, stop and add [TOO HARD] in the last position.
                Again, your task is only to answer the question Sub-task 5: Calculate p+q from the reduced fraction p/q obtained in Sub-task 4. and explaination.</pre>

    <pre>1. Sub‐task 4 gives the reduced fraction r² = 657/64, so p = 657 and q = 64.
2. Therefore p + q = 657 + 64 = 721.
