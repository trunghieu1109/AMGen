Question: Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.
Iteration: abstract_workflow_1_6
proposed answer: 1. Sub‐task 4 gives the reduced fraction r² = 657/64, so p = 657 and q = 64.
2. Therefore p + q = 657 + 64 = 721.

proposed answer: We seek the smallest radius r of a sphere that can contain any rectangular box with surface area 54 and volume 23. Such a box has edges l,w,h satisfying
  lw+lh+wh = 27   (since 2(lw+lh+wh)=54)
  lwh = 23.
Any containing sphere must have radius at least half the space diagonal d = √(l²+w²+h²), so r² = (l²+w²+h²)/4.  To cover all boxes in B we choose the box maximizing L = l²+w²+h² under the two constraints.  By symmetry one finds the critical cases occur when two edges are equal, say l=w=a.  Then:
  a²+2a h = 27,
  a² h = 23.
From a²h=23 ⇒ h=23/a².  Plug into the first:  a² + 46/a = 27 ⇒ a³ −27a +46=0.  This factors as (a−2)(a²+2a−23)=0, giving positive roots a=2 or a=−1+2√6≈3.898.  The corresponding h are 23/4=5.75 and 23/(−1+2√6)²≈1.513.  Compute L in each case:
  Case a=2,h=5.75: L = 2·(2²)+5.75² = 8 + 33.0625 = 41.0625 = 657/16.
  Case a≈3.898,h≈1.513: L ≈ 2·15.191 + 2.290 = 32.672 < 41.0625.
Thus the maximal diagonal‐squared is 657/16, so r² = (657/16)/4 = 657/64 in lowest terms.  Hence p=657, q=64, and p+q = 657+64 = 721.
