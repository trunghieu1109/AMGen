    <pre>Related original question:

Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt41$, $AC=BD= \sqrt80$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt89$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\fracm \sqrt np$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$..

### Sub-task 4: Conclude the expression of inradius as m\sqrt{n}/p. 

 ### thinking by Final Decision Agent qWTn:
Step 1: Identify m, n, p from the inradius r = 10√42/63.
  - The numerator is 10√42, so m = 10 and n = 42.
  - The denominator is p = 63.
Step 2: Check that n is square-free.
  - 42 = 2·3·7, with no repeated prime factors, so n = 42 is square-free.
Step 3: Check that gcd(m,p) = 1.
  - m = 10 = 2·5, p = 63 = 3·3·7 share no prime factors, so gcd(10,63) = 1.
All conditions are satisfied, so the inradius in the required form is r = (10√42)/63.

### answer by Final Decision Agent qWTn:
10√42/63

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 5: Sum the values of m, n, and p from the expression of the inradius to determine m+n+p. 

 then justify completely and detailedly, step-by-step why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. 
                If stuck in loop and cannot to solve this problem, stop and add [TOO HARD] in the last position.
                Again, your task is only to answer the question Sub-task 5: Sum the values of m, n, and p from the expression of the inradius to determine m+n+p. and explaination.</pre>

    <pre>Step 1: From Sub-task 4, the inradius is given as r = 10√42/63.
Step 2: Identify m, n, and p: m = 10, n = 42, p = 63.
Step 3: Compute the sum m + n + p = 10 + 42 + 63 = 115.
