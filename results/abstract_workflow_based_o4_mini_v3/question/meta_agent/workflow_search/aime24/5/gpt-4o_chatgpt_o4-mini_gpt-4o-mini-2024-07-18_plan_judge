Question: Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.

proposed answer: Step 1: From Sub-task 4, the inradius is given as r = 10âˆš42/63.
Step 2: Identify m, n, and p: m = 10, n = 42, p = 63.
Step 3: Compute the sum m + n + p = 10 + 42 + 63 = 115.
