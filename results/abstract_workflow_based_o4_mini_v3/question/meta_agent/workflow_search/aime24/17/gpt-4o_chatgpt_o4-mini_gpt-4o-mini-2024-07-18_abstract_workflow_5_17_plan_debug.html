\endequation*. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 1: Identify the constraint where the sum of nonnegative integers a, b, and c equals 300. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent WnG3:
1. The original problem states we are looking for triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) satisfying two conditions.
2. The first condition explicitly given is “a + b + c = 300.”
3. This is the sum constraint on the variables a, b, and c.
4. Therefore, the constraint for Sub-task 1 is exactly a + b + c = 300.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent WnG3:
a + b + c = 300

### Sub-task 2: Identify the polynomial constraint from the equation a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent rD73:
1. The original problem gives two conditions; Sub-task 1 was the linear sum, Sub-task 2 is the second condition.
2. The second condition is explicitly stated as a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.
3. This is a symmetric, homogeneous polynomial equation of degree 3 in the variables a, b, and c.
4. Identifying it means simply restating this polynomial constraint.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent rD73:
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6000000

### Sub-task 3: Transform the constraint a + b + c = 300 to express one variable in terms of others. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent QpuC:
1. We start from the given constraint a + b + c = 300.
2. To express one variable in terms of the other two, choose a variable to isolate; here we pick c.
3. Subtract a and b from both sides of the equation: (a + b + c) – a – b = 300 – a – b.
4. Simplify the left side: c = 300 – a – b.
5. This gives c expressed in terms of a and b, which completes the transformation.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent QpuC:
c = 300 - a - b

### Sub-task 4: Substitute expressions from Sub-task 3 into the polynomial equation and simplify to an equation involving fewer variables. 

 ### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent hCnR (yourself):
To perform Sub-task 4, we substitute c=300−a−b into the polynomial a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b and collect like terms.  

Step 1. Write the six terms with c replaced:  
 a^2b  
+ a^2(300−a−b)  
+ b^2a  
+ b^2(300−a−b)  
+ a(300−a−b)^2  
+ b(300−a−b)^2

Step 2. Expand the first four terms:  
 a^2b + (300a^2−a^3−a^2b) + ab^2 + (300b^2−ab^2−b^3)  
= 300a^2 − a^3 + 300b^2 − b^3

Step 3. Expand c^2=(300−a−b)^2 = 90000 −600(a+b)+(a+b)^2, then multiply by a and b:  
 a·c^2 + b·c^2  
= (a+b)[90000 −600(a+b)+(a+b)^2]
= 90000(a+b) −600(a+b)^2 + (a+b)^3

Step 4. Expand and combine all terms:  
300a^2 − a^3 +300b^2 − b^3  
+ 90000a +90000b −600(a^2+2ab+b^2) +(a^3+3a^2b+3ab^2+b^3)

The a^3 and b^3 terms cancel; collecting like terms gives
−300a^2 −300b^2 −1200ab +90000a +90000b +3a^2b+3ab^2.

Step 5. Set this equal to 6 000 000 and, if desired, divide by 3 for a simpler form.  

Thus the substitution yields the two‐variable equation
3a^2b +3ab^2 −300a^2 −1200ab −300b^2 +90000a +90000b = 6000000.


### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent hCnR (yourself):
3a^2b + 3ab^2 - 300a^2 - 1200ab - 300b^2 + 90000a + 90000b = 6000000

### please review the simplification and provide feedback. 

 ### feedback #1 by Critic Agent WZMC:
The substitution and algebraic manipulation are correct. All cubic terms cancel as shown, and the collected terms match the original expression when setting c=300−a−b. You can further simplify by dividing both sides by 3 if desired.

### Sub-task 4: Substitute expressions from Sub-task 3 into the polynomial equation and simplify to an equation involving fewer variables. 

 ### thinking #2 by Chain-of-Thought Agent hCnR (yourself):
Step 1: Write each term of the polynomial constraint replacing c by (300−a−b):
 a^2b                  stays the same,
 a^2c → a^2(300−a−b)=300a^2−a^3−a^2b,
 b^2a                  stays the same (b^2a=ab^2),
 b^2c → b^2(300−a−b)=300b^2−ab^2−b^3,
 c^2a → a(300−a−b)^2,
 c^2b → b(300−a−b)^2.

Step 2: Sum the first four terms:
 a^2b + (300a^2−a^3−a^2b) + ab^2 + (300b^2−ab^2−b^3)
 =300a^2−a^3 +300b^2−b^3.

Step 3: Expand c^2=(300−a−b)^2=90000−600(a+b)+(a+b)^2. Then
 a·c^2 + b·c^2 = (a+b)[90000−600(a+b)+(a+b)^2]
 =90000(a+b)−600(a+b)^2+(a+b)^3.

Step 4: Expand and combine all terms:
 300a^2−a^3 +300b^2−b^3 +90000(a+b) −600(a^2+2ab+b^2) +(a^3+3a^2b+3ab^2+b^3)

Cancel −a^3+a^3 and −b^3+b^3, and collect like terms:
 −300a^2 −300b^2 −1200ab +3a^2b+3ab^2 +90000a+90000b.

Step 5: Set equal to 6 000 000. The resulting two‐variable equation is:

### answer #2 by Chain-of-Thought Agent hCnR (yourself):
3a^2b + 3ab^2 - 300a^2 - 1200ab - 300b^2 + 90000a + 90000b = 6000000

### please review the simplification and provide feedback. 

 ### feedback #2 by Critic Agent WZMC:
The agent’s algebraic manipulation is correct.  Substituting c=300−a−b, expanding each term, canceling a³ and b³, and collecting like terms indeed yields
  3a²b + 3ab² − 300a² − 1200ab − 300b² + 90000a + 90000b = 6000000.
All intermediate expansions and sign changes check out.

### Sub-task 4: Substitute expressions from Sub-task 3 into the polynomial equation and simplify to an equation involving fewer variables. 

 ### thinking #3 by Chain-of-Thought Agent hCnR (yourself):
Step 1: We start with the polynomial constraint
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6000000.
Step 2: From Sub-task 3 we have c = 300 – a – b.  We substitute this into each term:
 • a^2b stays as is.
 • a^2c = a^2(300–a–b) = 300a^2 – a^3 – a^2b.
 • b^2a = ab^2 stays as is.
 • b^2c = b^2(300–a–b) = 300b^2 – ab^2 – b^3.
 • c^2a = a(300–a–b)^2.
 • c^2b = b(300–a–b)^2.
Step 3: Sum the first four terms:
 a^2b + (300a^2–a^3–a^2b) + ab^2 + (300b^2–ab^2–b^3)
 = 300a^2 – a^3 + 300b^2 – b^3.
Step 4: Expand (300–a–b)^2 = 90000 – 600(a+b) + (a+b)^2, then
 a·c^2 + b·c^2 = (a+b)[90000 – 600(a+b) + (a+b)^2]
 = 90000(a+b) – 600(a+b)^2 + (a+b)^3.
Step 5: Now add all contributions:
 300a^2 – a^3 + 300b^2 – b^3
 + 90000(a+b)
 – 600(a^2 + 2ab + b^2)
 + (a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3).
Step 6: Cancel –a^3 + a^3 and –b^3 + b^3, then collect like terms:
 • a^2b: 3a^2b
 • ab^2: 3ab^2
 • a^2: 300a^2 – 600a^2 = –300a^2
 • b^2: 300b^2 – 600b^2 = –300b^2
 • ab: –600·2ab = –1200ab
 • a: 90000a
 • b: 90000b
Step 7: Set the sum equal to 6000000. This yields the two-variable equation:

### answer #3 by Chain-of-Thought Agent hCnR (yourself):
3a^2b + 3ab^2 - 300a^2 - 1200ab - 300b^2 + 90000a + 90000b = 6000000

### please review the simplification and provide feedback.

    <pre>Step 1: Start from the given polynomial constraint: a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6000000.
Step 2: From Sub-task 3 we have c = 300 − a − b. Substitute this into each term:
 • a^2b remains a^2b.
 • a^2c = a^2(300 − a − b) = 300a^2 − a^3 − a^2b.
 • b^2a = ab^2.
 • b^2c = b^2(300 − a − b) = 300b^2 − ab^2 − b^3.
 • c^2a = a(300 − a − b)^2.
 • c^2b = b(300 − a − b)^2.
Step 3: Sum the first four terms:
 a^2b + (300a^2 − a^3 − a^2b) + ab^2 + (300b^2 − ab^2 − b^3)
 = 300a^2 − a^3 + 300b^2 − b^3.
Step 4: Expand c^2 = (300 − a − b)^2 = 90000 − 600(a + b) + (a + b)^2. Then
 a·c^2 + b·c^2 = (a + b)[90000 − 600(a + b) + (a + b)^2]
 = 90000(a + b) − 600(a + b)^2 + (a + b)^3.
Step 5: Now add all contributions:
 300a^2 − a^3 + 300b^2 − b^3
 + 90000(a + b)
 − 600(a^2 + 2ab + b^2)
 + (a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3).
Step 6: Cancel −a^3 + a^3 and −b^3 + b^3, then collect like terms:
 • a^2b: 3a^2b
 • ab^2: 3ab^2
 • a^2: 300a^2 − 600a^2 = −300a^2
 • b^2: 300b^2 − 600b^2 = −300b^2
 • ab: −600·2ab = −1200ab
 • a: 90000a
 • b: 90000b
Step 7: Set the sum equal to 6000000. The resulting two-variable equation is the final simplified form.
