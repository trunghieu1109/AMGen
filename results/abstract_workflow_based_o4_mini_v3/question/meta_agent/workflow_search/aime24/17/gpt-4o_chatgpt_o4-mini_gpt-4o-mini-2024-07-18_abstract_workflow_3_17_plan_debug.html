### Sub-task 4: Count the number of triples that satisfy the condition. 

 ### thinking by Debate Agent eqzw:
We have shown that the only nonnegative integer triples (a,b,c) with a+b+c=300 satisfying a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6{,}000{,}000 are exactly those in which at least one of a,b,c equals 100. To count these:

1. Let A = {triples with a = 100}.  Then b+c = 200, which has 201 nonnegative solutions (b=0…200).  So |A| = 201.
2. Similarly, |B| = 201 (b = 100) and |C| = 201 (c = 100).
3. The intersection A∩B requires a=b=100 ⇒ c=100, so |A∩B| = 1.  Likewise |A∩C| = 1 and |B∩C| = 1.
4. The triple intersection A∩B∩C is also just (100,100,100), so |A∩B∩C| = 1.
5. By inclusion–exclusion,
   |A∪B∪C| = |A| + |B| + |C| − (|A∩B| + |A∩C| + |B∩C|) + |A∩B∩C|
            = 3·201 − 3·1 + 1
            = 603 − 3 + 1 = 601.

Therefore, there are 601 such triples.

### thinking by Debate Agent CCZc:
We know from prior analysis that the equation a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6{,}000{,}000 for nonnegative integers a,b,c with a+b+c=300 holds exactly when at least one of a,b,c equals 100.  To count all such triples, we use inclusion–exclusion on the three conditions “a=100”, “b=100”, and “c=100”:

1. Let A = {triples with a=100}.  Then b+c=200 has 200+1=201 nonnegative solutions, so |A|=201.
2. Similarly, |B|=201 for b=100 and |C|=201 for c=100.
3. The intersection A∩B is triples with a=b=100, forcing c=100, so |A∩B|=1.  Likewise |A∩C|=1 and |B∩C|=1.
4. The triple intersection A∩B∩C is also just (100,100,100), so |A∩B∩C|=1.
5. By inclusion–exclusion,
   |A∪B∪C| = |A|+|B|+|C| − (|A∩B|+|A∩C|+|B∩C|) + |A∩B∩C|
             = 3·201 − 3·1 + 1
             = 603 − 3 + 1
             = 601.

Hence there are exactly 601 triples satisfying the given condition.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Make final decision on the count of triples. 

 then justify completely and detailedly, step-by-step why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. 
                If stuck in loop and cannot to solve this problem, stop and add [TOO HARD] in the last position.

    <pre>We seek the number of nonnegative integer solutions (a,b,c) to a+b+c=300 satisfying a^2b+a^2c+b^2a+b^2c+c^2a+c^2b=6,000,000.

1.  Observe that a^2b+b^2a=ab(a+b).  Hence the given sum is
   ab(a+b)+ac(a+c)+bc(b+c).
2.  Since a+b+c=300, we have a+b=300−c, etc.  Thus the sum becomes
   ab(300−c)+ac(300−b)+bc(300−a)
   =300(ab+ac+bc)−3abc.
   We require 300(ab+ac+bc)−3abc=6,000,000 ⇔100(ab+ac+bc)−abc=2,000,000.
3.  One checks by substitution that whenever one variable equals 100, say a=100, and b+c=200, the equation holds for all nonnegative b,c with b+c=200.  Indeed,
   sum =100^2(b+c)+100(b^2+c^2)+bc(b+c)
        =10,000·200+100(b^2+c^2)+200bc
        =2,000,000+100(b+c)^2
        =2,000,000+100·200^2
        =6,000,000.
4.  One also shows no other triples satisfy the equation.  Thus the solution set is exactly
   { (a,b,c): one of a,b,c equals 100 and the other two sum to 200 }.
5.  To count these, let A={triples with a=100}.  Then b+c=200 has 201 solutions.  So |A|=201.  Similarly |B|=201 for b=100, |C|=201 for c=100.
6.  Intersections: A∩B (a=b=100) forces c=100, so |A∩B|=1.  Likewise the other pairwise intersections each have size 1, and the triple intersection A∩B∩C is also that single triple.
7.  By inclusion–exclusion,
   |A∪B∪C| = |A|+|B|+|C| −(|A∩B|+|A∩C|+|B∩C|)+|A∩B∩C|
            =3·201 −3·1 +1 =603−3+1 =601.

Therefore, there are exactly 601 such triples.
