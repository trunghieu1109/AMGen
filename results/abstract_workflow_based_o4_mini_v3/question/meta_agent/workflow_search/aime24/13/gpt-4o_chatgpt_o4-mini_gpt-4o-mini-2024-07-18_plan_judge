Question: Eight circles of radius $34$ are sequentially tangent, and two of the circles are tangent to $AB$ and $BC$ of triangle $ABC$, respectively. $2024$ circles of radius $1$ can be arranged in the same manner. The inradius of triangle $ABC$ can be expressed as $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: We have a system relating the inradius r of triangle ABC to sequential tangent chains of eight circles of radius 34 and 2024 circles of radius 1.  Let α be half the apex angle at A in triangle ABC; then by standard geometry of tangent circle chains along the two sides we obtain

  r = 2·34·7·sinα = 476 sinα,

and α must satisfy the transcendental equation

  ∑_{k=1}^7 2 arcsin[34/(34/sinα + 68(k−1))]
    = ∑_{k=1}^{2023} 2 arcsin[1/(1/sinα + 2(k−1))].

This equation involves sums of arcsine terms with arguments forming arithmetic progressions.  There is no known algebraic or closed‐form solution for sinα from this identity, as it does not telescope or reduce via classical special‐function identities.  A numeric approximation for sinα (and hence r) could be found via iterative methods, but the problem requests an exact rational representation r = m/n with m,n coprime, and an exact integer m+n.  Because the defining equation for sinα is transcendental and no known simplification yields a rational value, we cannot derive an exact m/n in closed form by elementary or standard special‐function techniques.  Therefore the problem is intractable in exact form with current methods.
