Question: Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?

proposed answer: Step 1: Total number of colorings. Each of the 8 vertices is independently colored red or blue, so there are 2^8 = 256 possible colorings.
Step 2: Identify the 180° rotation pairing. A 180° rotation on the octagon swaps vertices in 4 opposite pairs: (0,4), (1,5), (2,6), (3,7).
Step 3: Condition for a valid coloring. After rotation, every blue vertex must land on a vertex that was originally red. Thus in each opposite pair exactly one vertex must be blue and the other red.
Step 4: Count valid colorings. For each of the 4 pairs there are 2 choices (which vertex is blue), giving 2^4 = 16 valid colorings.
Step 5: Compute the probability. It is 16 valid colorings divided by 256 total colorings, so 16/256 = 1/16.
Step 6: Reduce the fraction. gcd(16,256)=16, so dividing numerator and denominator by 16 gives 1/16.
Step 7: Identify m and n. In the reduced fraction 1/16, m = 1 and n = 16. Therefore m + n = 1 + 16 = 17.

Answer:The probability as a reduced fraction is 1/16, and m+n = 17.
Extracted answer: The probability as a reduced fraction is 1/16, and m+n = 17.

Question: Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability.

proposed answer: We need the probability that a random 2‐coloring of the 8 vertices of a regular octagon admits a nonzero rotation sending every blue vertex to a position originally red. Equivalently, if S is the set of blue vertices (size s), we seek ∃k∈{1,…,7} such that (S+k)∩S=∅. Total colorings = 2^8 = 256.

Step 1: Count subsets S of size s≤3. For any such S and any nonzero k, |S|+|S+k| ≤ 6 < 8, so S and S+k can be made disjoint. Thus all subsets of sizes 0,1,2,3 are favorable. Their number is C(8,0)+C(8,1)+C(8,2)+C(8,3) = 1 + 8 + 28 + 56 = 93.

Step 2: Count subsets S of size 4. We require |S|+|S+k| = 8 to be disjoint ⇒ S+k = complement(S). Applying the rotation twice yields S+2k = S ⇒ 2k ≡ 0 mod 8 ⇒ k = 4. Thus only the 180° rotation can work. We need S+4 = complement(S). The octagon splits into 4 antipodal pairs {i, i+4}. S must contain exactly one from each pair, giving 2^4 = 16 such subsets.

Step 3: For s = 5,6,7,8, we have |S|+|S+k| > 8 for any nonzero k, so no rotation can make S and S+k disjoint. Contribution = 0.

Total favorable subsets = 93 + 16 = 109. Probability = 109/256. Since gcd(109,256)=1, this fraction is already in lowest terms. The problem then asks for m+n where the probability is m/n. Thus m=109, n=256, and m+n = 365.
