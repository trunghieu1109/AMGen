        "response": "Step 1: Total number of colorings. Each of the 8 vertices is independently colored red or blue, so there are 2^8 = 256 possible colorings.\nStep 2: Identify the 180\u00b0 rotation pairing. A 180\u00b0 rotation on the octagon swaps vertices in 4 opposite pairs: (0,4), (1,5), (2,6), (3,7).\nStep 3: Condition for a valid coloring. After rotation, every blue vertex must land on a vertex that was originally red. Thus in each opposite pair exactly one vertex must be blue and the other red.\nStep 4: Count valid colorings. For each of the 4 pairs there are 2 choices (which vertex is blue), giving 2^4 = 16 valid colorings.\nStep 5: Compute the probability. It is 16 valid colorings divided by 256 total colorings, so 16/256 = 1/16.\nStep 6: Reduce the fraction. gcd(16,256)=16, so dividing numerator and denominator by 16 gives 1/16.\nStep 7: Identify m and n. In the reduced fraction 1/16, m = 1 and n = 16. Therefore m + n = 1 + 16 = 17.\n\nAnswer:The probability as a reduced fraction is 1/16, and m+n = 17.",

        "response": "We need the probability that a random 2\u2010coloring of the 8 vertices of a regular octagon admits a nonzero rotation sending every blue vertex to a position originally red. Equivalently, if S is the set of blue vertices (size s), we seek \u2203k\u2208{1,\u2026,7} such that (S+k)\u2229S=\u2205. Total colorings = 2^8 = 256.\n\nStep 1: Count subsets S of size s\u22643. For any such S and any nonzero k, |S|+|S+k| \u2264 6 < 8, so S and S+k can be made disjoint. Thus all subsets of sizes 0,1,2,3 are favorable. Their number is C(8,0)+C(8,1)+C(8,2)+C(8,3) = 1 + 8 + 28 + 56 = 93.\n\nStep 2: Count subsets S of size 4. We require |S|+|S+k| = 8 to be disjoint \u21d2 S+k = complement(S). Applying the rotation twice yields S+2k = S \u21d2 2k \u2261 0 mod 8 \u21d2 k = 4. Thus only the 180\u00b0 rotation can work. We need S+4 = complement(S). The octagon splits into 4 antipodal pairs {i, i+4}. S must contain exactly one from each pair, giving 2^4 = 16 such subsets.\n\nStep 3: For s = 5,6,7,8, we have |S|+|S+k| > 8 for any nonzero k, so no rotation can make S and S+k disjoint. Contribution = 0.\n\nTotal favorable subsets = 93 + 16 = 109. Probability = 109/256. Since gcd(109,256)=1, this fraction is already in lowest terms. The problem then asks for m+n where the probability is m/n. Thus m=109, n=256, and m+n = 365.\n\nAnswer:365",
