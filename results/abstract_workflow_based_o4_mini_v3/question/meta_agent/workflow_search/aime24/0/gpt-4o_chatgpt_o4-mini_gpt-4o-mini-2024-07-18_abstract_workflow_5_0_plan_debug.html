    <pre>Related original question:

Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac12$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop..

### Sub-task 6: Make final decision on total duration. 

 ### thinking by Final Decision Agent rhpE:
1. From earlier calculations, Aya’s walking speed s was determined to be 2.5 km/h and her coffee-shop stop time t is 24 minutes.
2. We now consider her walking at speed s + 0.5 km/h = 2.5 + 0.5 = 3.0 km/h.
3. The time to walk 9 kilometers at 3.0 km/h is given by:
   walking time (hours) = distance ÷ speed = 9 ÷ 3.0 = 3 hours.
4. Convert walking time to minutes: 3 hours × 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes.
5. Add the coffee-shop stop time t = 24 minutes to the walking time: 180 + 24 = 204 minutes.
6. Therefore, the total duration of the walk, including the coffee-shop stop, at speed s + 0.5 km/h is 204 minutes.

### answer by Final Decision Agent rhpE:
204

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 7: Format the final duration into minutes. 

 then justify completely and detailedly, step-by-step why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. 
                If stuck in loop and cannot to solve this problem, stop and add [TOO HARD] in the last position.
                Again, your task is only to answer the question Sub-task 7: Format the final duration into minutes. and explaination.</pre>

    <pre>1. From earlier, we found Aya’s walking speed s = 2.5 km/h and coffee-shop stop time t = 24 minutes.
2. We now consider her walking at speed s + 0.5 = 3.0 km/h.
3. The walking distance is 9 km. Time to walk = distance/speed = 9 ÷ 3.0 = 3 hours.
4. Convert 3 hours to minutes: 3 × 60 = 180 minutes.
5. Add the coffee-shop stop time t = 24 minutes: total = 180 + 24 = 204 minutes.
6. Thus, when walking at 3.0 km/h (s+½), the entire outing takes 204 minutes.
