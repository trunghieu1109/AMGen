Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.
[asy] size(10cm); usepackage(&#34;tikz&#34;);label(&#34;egintikzpicture[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(2,0)--(2,3)--(5,3)--(5,8)--(8,8);\endtikzpicture&#34;,origin); label(&#34;\begintikzpicture[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(0,3)--(3,3)--(3,5)--(8,5)--(8,8);\endtikzpicture&#34;,E); [/asy].

### Sub-task 4: Calculate the number of valid paths where exactly four direction changes occur. 

 ### thinking #3 by Debate Agent KE24:
We seek paths of 16 moves (8 rights R and 8 ups U) from (0,0) to (8,8) with exactly 4 direction changes. A direction change occurs when consecutive moves differ, so 4 changes partition the 16 moves into 5 runs of identical moves. Each run has length ≥1 and runs alternate between R and U. There are two cases:

Case A (start with R): runs are R^{s1}–U^{s2}–R^{s3}–U^{s4}–R^{s5}. We require s1+s3+s5=8 (total R’s) and s2+s4=8 (total U’s), with all si≥1. The number of positive solutions to s1+s3+s5=8 is C(8−1,3−1)=C(7,2)=21. The number of positive solutions to s2+s4=8 is C(8−1,2−1)=C(7,1)=7. Hence Case A yields 21×7=147 paths.

Case B (start with U): runs are U^{s1}–R^{s2}–U^{s3}–R^{s4}–U^{s5}. Similarly s1+s3+s5=8 and s2+s4=8, each si≥1, giving again 21×7=147 paths by the same stars-and-bars counts.

Summing both cases gives 147+147 = 294 total paths with exactly four direction changes.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent YkJP:
1. We need paths from (0,0) to (8,8) using exactly eight R moves and eight U moves (total 16 moves).  
2. A &#34;direction change&#34; occurs whenever a move differs from the previous one. Exactly four changes partition the moves into five consecutive runs of identical moves.  
3. These five runs must alternate between R and U, so there are exactly two patterns:  
   • Pattern A (start with R):  R^{s1} – U^{s2} – R^{s3} – U^{s4} – R^{s5}  
   • Pattern B (start with U):  U^{s1} – R^{s2} – U^{s3} – R^{s4} – U^{s5}  
4. In Pattern A, runs 1,3,5 are R moves summing to 8: s1+s3+s5=8, each si≥1.  By stars-and-bars, the number of positive solutions is C(8−1,3−1)=C(7,2)=21.  
   Runs 2,4 are U moves summing to 8: s2+s4=8, each ≥1.  The number of positive solutions is C(8−1,2−1)=C(7,1)=7.  
   Hence Pattern A yields 21×7=147 valid run‐length assignments.  
5. By symmetry, Pattern B also yields 147 valid assignments.  
6. Therefore the total number of 16-step paths with exactly four direction changes is 147+147=294.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Make final decision on the number of valid paths. 

 then justify completely and detailedly, step-by-step why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. 
                If stuck in loop and cannot to solve this problem, stop and add [TOO HARD] in the last position.
                Again, your task is only to answer the question Sub-task 4: Make final decision on the number of valid paths. and explaination.</pre>

    <pre>We need the number of paths from (0,0) to (8,8) with exactly four direction changes among 16 moves (8 right R and 8 up U). A direction change partitions the moves into exactly five runs of consecutive identical moves, which must alternate R and U. There are two patterns:

Pattern A (start with R): runs R^{s1}–U^{s2}–R^{s3}–U^{s4}–R^{s5}, with s1+s3+s5=8 and s2+s4=8, all si≥1.  The number of positive integer solutions for s1+s3+s5=8 is C(8−1,3−1)=C(7,2)=21.  For s2+s4=8 it is C(8−1,2−1)=C(7,1)=7.  So Pattern A yields 21×7=147 assignments.

Pattern B (start with U) by symmetry also yields 147 assignments.

Total paths =147+147=294.
