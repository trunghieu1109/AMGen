Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.
[asy] size(10cm); usepackage(&#34;tikz&#34;);label(&#34;egintikzpicture[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(2,0)--(2,3)--(5,3)--(5,8)--(8,8);\endtikzpicture&#34;,origin); label(&#34;\begintikzpicture[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(0,3)--(3,3)--(3,5)--(8,5)--(8,8);\endtikzpicture&#34;,E); [/asy].

### Sub-task 7: Combine the results from distributing the movements and computing the possible combinations to find the total number of valid paths. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent RxUs:
We have two possible starting directions (H or V). For each:  
1) Start with H: we need 3 H‐runs summing to 8 steps (x1+x2+x3=8, xi≥1) and 2 V‐runs summing to 8 (y1+y2=8, yi≥1). The number of positive solutions is C(8−1,3−1)=C(7,2)=21 for the H‐runs and C(8−1,2−1)=C(7,1)=7 for the V‐runs. Once the run lengths are chosen, the path is uniquely determined (go H x1, V y1, H x2, V y2, H x3). So there are 21·7=147 paths starting with H.
2) Start with V: similarly, 3 V‐runs into 8 steps gives 21 choices, and 2 H‐runs into 8 steps gives 7 choices, for another 21·7=147 paths.
Total valid paths =147+147=294.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent RxUs:
294

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 8: Format the final count of paths into a comprehensible solution that answers the original query. 

 then justify completely and detailedly, step-by-step why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. 
                If stuck in loop and cannot to solve this problem, stop and add [TOO HARD] in the last position.
                Again, your task is only to answer the question Sub-task 8: Format the final count of paths into a comprehensible solution that answers the original query. and explaination.</pre>

    <pre>We need the total number of paths from (0,0) to (8,8) using 8 horizontal (H) and 8 vertical (V) steps, changing direction exactly four times. Such a path has exactly five “runs” of consecutive steps in one direction. Two cases arise: starting with H or starting with V.

Case 1: Path starts with H. Then the pattern of runs is H–V–H–V–H (three H‐runs and two V‐runs). We must partition the 8 H‐steps into three positive parts x1+x2+x3=8, which has C(8−1,3−1)=C(7,2)=21 solutions, and partition the 8 V‐steps into two positive parts y1+y2=8, which has C(7,1)=7 solutions. Each choice of run lengths determines a unique path, so there are 21·7=147 paths starting with H.

Case 2: Path starts with V. By symmetry, we have three V‐runs and two H‐runs, giving C(7,2)=21 ways to split the V‐steps and C(7,1)=7 ways to split the H‐steps, for another 21·7=147 paths.

Total number of valid paths = 147+147 = 294.
