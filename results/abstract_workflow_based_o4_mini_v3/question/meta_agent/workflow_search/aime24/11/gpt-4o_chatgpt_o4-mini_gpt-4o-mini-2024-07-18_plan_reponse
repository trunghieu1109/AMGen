        "response": "We need the number of paths from (0,0) to (8,8) with exactly four direction changes among 16 moves (8 right R and 8 up U). A direction change partitions the moves into exactly five runs of consecutive identical moves, which must alternate R and U. There are two patterns:\n\nPattern A (start with R): runs R^{s1}\u2013U^{s2}\u2013R^{s3}\u2013U^{s4}\u2013R^{s5}, with s1+s3+s5=8 and s2+s4=8, all si\u22651.  The number of positive integer solutions for s1+s3+s5=8 is C(8\u22121,3\u22121)=C(7,2)=21.  For s2+s4=8 it is C(8\u22121,2\u22121)=C(7,1)=7.  So Pattern A yields 21\u00d77=147 assignments.\n\nPattern B (start with U) by symmetry also yields 147 assignments.\n\nTotal paths =147+147=294.\n\nAnswer:294",

        "response": "We need the total number of paths from (0,0) to (8,8) using 8 horizontal (H) and 8 vertical (V) steps, changing direction exactly four times. Such a path has exactly five \u201cruns\u201d of consecutive steps in one direction. Two cases arise: starting with H or starting with V.\n\nCase 1: Path starts with H. Then the pattern of runs is H\u2013V\u2013H\u2013V\u2013H (three H\u2010runs and two V\u2010runs). We must partition the 8 H\u2010steps into three positive parts x1+x2+x3=8, which has C(8\u22121,3\u22121)=C(7,2)=21 solutions, and partition the 8 V\u2010steps into two positive parts y1+y2=8, which has C(7,1)=7 solutions. Each choice of run lengths determines a unique path, so there are 21\u00b77=147 paths starting with H.\n\nCase 2: Path starts with V. By symmetry, we have three V\u2010runs and two H\u2010runs, giving C(7,2)=21 ways to split the V\u2010steps and C(7,1)=7 ways to split the H\u2010steps, for another 21\u00b77=147 paths.\n\nTotal number of valid paths = 147+147 = 294.\n\nAnswer:The total number of paths that change direction exactly four times is 294.",
