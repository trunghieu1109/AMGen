Question: Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.

proposed answer: We need the number of paths from (0,0) to (8,8) with exactly four direction changes among 16 moves (8 right R and 8 up U). A direction change partitions the moves into exactly five runs of consecutive identical moves, which must alternate R and U. There are two patterns:

Pattern A (start with R): runs R^{s1}–U^{s2}–R^{s3}–U^{s4}–R^{s5}, with s1+s3+s5=8 and s2+s4=8, all si≥1.  The number of positive integer solutions for s1+s3+s5=8 is C(8−1,3−1)=C(7,2)=21.  For s2+s4=8 it is C(8−1,2−1)=C(7,1)=7.  So Pattern A yields 21×7=147 assignments.

Pattern B (start with U) by symmetry also yields 147 assignments.

Total paths =147+147=294.

proposed answer: We need the total number of paths from (0,0) to (8,8) using 8 horizontal (H) and 8 vertical (V) steps, changing direction exactly four times. Such a path has exactly five “runs” of consecutive steps in one direction. Two cases arise: starting with H or starting with V.

Case 1: Path starts with H. Then the pattern of runs is H–V–H–V–H (three H‐runs and two V‐runs). We must partition the 8 H‐steps into three positive parts x1+x2+x3=8, which has C(8−1,3−1)=C(7,2)=21 solutions, and partition the 8 V‐steps into two positive parts y1+y2=8, which has C(7,1)=7 solutions. Each choice of run lengths determines a unique path, so there are 21·7=147 paths starting with H.

Case 2: Path starts with V. By symmetry, we have three V‐runs and two H‐runs, giving C(7,2)=21 ways to split the V‐steps and C(7,1)=7 ways to split the H‐steps, for another 21·7=147 paths.

Total number of valid paths = 147+147 = 294.

Answer:The total number of paths that change direction exactly four times is 294.
