Start with the first element: total = 4.\n2. Add the second element (6): total = 4 + 6 = 10.\n3. Add the third element (7): total = 10 + 7 = 17.\n4. Add the fourth element (8): total = 17 + 8 = 25.\n5. Add the fifth element (9): total = 25 + 9 = 34.\n6. Add the sixth element (10): total = 34 + 10 = 44.\n7. Add the seventh element (11): total = 44 + 11 = 55.\nTherefore, the sum of the elements in A is 55.\n\nAnswer:55",
