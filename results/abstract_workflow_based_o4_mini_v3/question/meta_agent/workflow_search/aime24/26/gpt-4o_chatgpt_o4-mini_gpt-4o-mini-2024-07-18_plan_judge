Question: Alice chooses a set $A$ of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets $B$ of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of $B$ belongs to $A$. Bob's list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A.
Iteration: abstract_workflow_2_26
proposed answer: From subtask 4 we have determined that the set A is {4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11}. To find the sum of its elements, we proceed step by step:
1. Start with the first element: total = 4.
2. Add the second element (6): total = 4 + 6 = 10.
3. Add the third element (7): total = 10 + 7 = 17.
4. Add the fourth element (8): total = 17 + 8 = 25.
5. Add the fifth element (9): total = 25 + 9 = 34.
6. Add the sixth element (10): total = 34 + 10 = 44.
7. Add the seventh element (11): total = 44 + 11 = 55.
Therefore, the sum of the elements in A is 55.
