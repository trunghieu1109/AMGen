        "response": "We know that in triangle ABC with circumcenter O and incenter I, the condition IA \u27c2 OI leads to the relation AB\u00b7AC = 6\u00b7R\u00b7r. Here R is the circumradius and r is the inradius.  \n\nStep 1: Recall the perpendicularity condition. From IA \u27c2 OI one can derive (by standard distance and power\u2010of\u2010point arguments or using Euler\u2019s relation IO\u00b2 = R(R\u22122r) and the Pythagorean theorem on \u0394AIO) that  AB\u00b7AC = 6Rr.  \n\nStep 2: Substitute the given data R = 13 and r = 6 into the formula AB\u00b7AC = 6\u00b7R\u00b7r.  \n\nStep 3: Compute: 6 \u00d7 13 = 78, then 78 \u00d7 6 = 468.  \n\nTherefore, the final decision is that AB\u00b7AC = 468.\n\nAnswer:468",
