### Calculate the final value of AB * AC by solving the derived equations. 

 ### thinking #3 by Debate Agent HP9v:
1. From the perpendicularity condition IA⊥OI in triangle ABC, one derives the relation AB·AC = 6·R·r.
2. The problem states the circumradius R = 13 and the inradius r = 6.
3. Substitute these values into the formula: AB·AC = 6 × 13 × 6.
4. Compute: 6 × 13 = 78; then 78 × 6 = 468.
5. Hence the final value of AB·AC is 468.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent VGg2:
1. From the perpendicularity condition IA ⟂ OI, one derives the formula AB·AC = 6·R·r.
2. The problem gives the circumradius R = 13 and the inradius r = 6.
3. Substitute these values into the formula: AB·AC = 6 × 13 × 6.
4. Compute step by step: 6 × 13 = 78, then 78 × 6 = 468.
5. Therefore, the final value of AB·AC is 468.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 7: Make final decision on calculating AB * AC. 

 then justify completely and detailedly, step-by-step why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. 
                If stuck in loop and cannot to solve this problem, stop and add [TOO HARD] in the last position.
                Again, your task is only to answer the question Sub-task 7: Make final decision on calculating AB * AC. and explaination.</pre>

    <pre>We know that in triangle ABC with circumcenter O and incenter I, the condition IA ⟂ OI leads to the relation AB·AC = 6·R·r. Here R is the circumradius and r is the inradius.  

Step 1: Recall the perpendicularity condition. From IA ⟂ OI one can derive (by standard distance and power‐of‐point arguments or using Euler’s relation IO² = R(R−2r) and the Pythagorean theorem on ΔAIO) that  AB·AC = 6Rr.  

Step 2: Substitute the given data R = 13 and r = 6 into the formula AB·AC = 6·R·r.  

Step 3: Compute: 6 × 13 = 78, then 78 × 6 = 468.  

Therefore, the final decision is that AB·AC = 468.
