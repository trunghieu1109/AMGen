Question: Let $\triangle ABC$ have circumcenter $O$ and incenter $I$ with $\overline{IA}\perp\overline{OI}$, circumradius $13$, and inradius $6$. Find $AB\cdot AC$.
Iteration: abstract_workflow_2_16
proposed answer: We know that in triangle ABC with circumcenter O and incenter I, the condition IA ⟂ OI leads to the relation AB·AC = 6·R·r. Here R is the circumradius and r is the inradius.  

Step 1: Recall the perpendicularity condition. From IA ⟂ OI one can derive (by standard distance and power‐of‐point arguments or using Euler’s relation IO² = R(R−2r) and the Pythagorean theorem on ΔAIO) that  AB·AC = 6Rr.  

Step 2: Substitute the given data R = 13 and r = 6 into the formula AB·AC = 6·R·r.  

Step 3: Compute: 6 × 13 = 78, then 78 × 6 = 468.  

Therefore, the final decision is that AB·AC = 468.
