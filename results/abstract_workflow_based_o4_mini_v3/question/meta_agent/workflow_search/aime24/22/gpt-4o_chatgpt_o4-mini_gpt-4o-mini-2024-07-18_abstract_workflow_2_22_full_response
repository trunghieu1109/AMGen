We have 5+7=12, plus 9+9=18, so total is 12+18=30, matching the required sum.\nStep 2: Identify the mode. In this list, 9 appears twice, while 5 and 7 each appear once. Thus the unique mode is 9, as required.\nStep 3: Determine the median. Sorting the list gives [5,7,9,9]. With four elements, the median is the average of the 2nd and 3rd terms: (7+9)/2=8.

A mode must appear at least twice to be the unique most frequent element. So 9 must appear ≥2 times.\n2. If 9 appeared 4 times or more: 4×9=36>30, impossible.\n3. If 9 appeared 3 times: 3×9=27, leaving only 3 to be split among the other entries (all positive). The only way is three 1’s: 1+1+1=3. But then 1 also appears 3 times, tying with 9, so 9 would not be a unique mode.\n4. Therefore the only viable frequency for 9 is exactly 2 times: 2×9=18 leaves 12 for the other entries; and no other number can appear more than once (or duplicate) or tie with frequency 2.\n\nHence, 9 must appear exactly twice.; answer: 2\nCoT agent A6d0, determining potential list size, thinking: We know from Sub-task 1 that 9 appears exactly twice, contributing 18 to the total 30. The remaining sum is 12, to be distributed among the other (n–2) distinct positive integers, none equal to 9, and no repeats (so 9 remains the unique mode). We must also satisfy that the median is a positive integer not in the list.\n\nTest n=3: then n–2=1 other number must be 12. List: [9, 9, 12]. Median is 9, which is in the list. Reject.\n\nTest n=4: then n–2=2 others must sum to 12, distinct, positive, ≠9. The pair (5,7) works. List: [5, 7, 9, 9]. Sorted: [5,7,9,9]. Median = (7+9)/2 = 8, an integer not in the list. All conditions met. Accept n=4.\n\nTest n=5: then n–2=3 others must sum to 12, distinct, positive, ≠9. Examples like (3,4,5) give list [3,4,5,9,9] with median 5 (in the list). Every such triple yields a median that’s in the list. Reject.\n\nTest n=6 or higher: then n–2≥4, but the minimal sum of 4 distinct positive integers is 1+2+3+4=10, and of 5 is 1+2+3+4+5=15>12, so only n=6 or n=7 would be possible sums but fail the median integer condition or sum condition. Hence the only viable list size is 4.; answer: 4\nReflexion CoT agent TgrL, identifying potential integers, thinking: We know from Sub-task 1 that 9 must appear exactly twice, contributing 2×9=18 toward the total of 30. That leaves 30−18=12 to be split among the remaining entries, which must be positive integers, none equal to 9, and none repeated (so 9 remains the unique mode). We also require the median to be an integer not in the list.\n\nSince we have two 9’s, the total list size n must be 4 (as established in Sub-task 2), so there are 2 other numbers, say a and b, distinct, both ≠9, with a+b=12 and a<b.\n\nList all positive pairs summing to 12 with a<b:\n1+11, 2+10, 3+9, 4+8, 5+7, 6+6.\n\nExclude any pair containing 9 or a repeat:\n• 3+9 is invalid (contains 9)\n• 6+6 is invalid (repeats 6)\n\nTest remaining pairs for the median condition. Sorted list is [a,9,9,b], so median is (9+9)/2=9 for any b>9, which is in the list—invalid. That leaves only pairs with b<9:\n• 4+8 → sorted [4,8,9,9], median=(8+9)/2=8.5, not an integer—invalid\n• 5+7 → sorted [5,7,9,9], median=(7+9)/2=8, an integer not in the list—valid\n\nThus the only choice is a=5, b=7. The list is {9,9,5,7}.; answer: The list consists of two 9’s, one 5, and one 7.\nCritic agent ncK5, providing feedback, thinking: The identification is correct. Splitting the remaining sum 12 into two distinct positive integers (excluding 9) gives only (5,7) as a valid pair after testing the median condition. In the sorted list [5,7,9,9], the median is (7+9)/2=8, an integer not in the list, satisfying all requirements.; answer: The list of integers is {5, 7, 9, 9}.\nReflexion CoT agent TgrL, refining potential integers identification, thinking: We know from Sub-task 1 that 9 must appear exactly twice, contributing 18 toward the total of 30. This leaves 12 to be split among the remaining two entries. From Sub-task 2 we have four total elements, so there are exactly two other positive integers, both distinct and not equal to 9, summing to 12. List the pairs (a,b) with a<b: (1,11),(2,10),(3,9),(4,8),(5,7),(6,6). Exclude pairs containing 9 or repeats, removing (3,9) and (6,6). For each remaining pair, form the sorted list and compute the median (the average of the middle two values):\n• (1,11) → [1,9,9,11], median = 9 (in the list) → invalid\n• (2,10) → [2,9,9,10], median = 9 (in the list) → invalid\n• (4,8) → [4,8,9,9], median = (8+9)/2 = 8.5 (not integer) → invalid\n• (5,7) → [5,7,9,9], median = (7+9)/2 = 8, an integer not in the list → valid\nThus the only valid composition is two 9’s, one 5, and one 7.; answer: The list contains two 9’s, one 5, and one 7.\nCritic agent ncK5, providing feedback, thinking: The agent’s enumeration of pairs and elimination reasoning is solid. They correctly noted that 9 must appear twice, leaving 12 to split among two distinct, non-9 integers. They listed all (a,b) pairs summing to 12, excluded those containing 9 or repeats, and checked median conditions for each. Only (5,7) yields a median of 8, an integer not in the list. Thus two 9’s, one 5, and one 7 is indeed the only valid choice.; answer: The list of integers is {5,7,9,9}.\nReflexion CoT agent TgrL, refining potential integers identification, thinking: 1. From Sub-task 1, the mode 9 must appear exactly twice, contributing 2×9 = 18 to the total sum of 30.\n2. This leaves 30 − 18 = 12 to be distributed among the remaining entries. From Sub-task 2, the total list size is 4, so there are exactly 2 other positive integers, call them a and b, with a + b = 12, a < b, both ≠ 9, and no repeats.\n3. List all positive pairs summing to 12 with a < b: (1,11), (2,10), (3,9), (4,8), (5,7), (6,6).\n4. Exclude pairs containing 9 or a repeat:\n   • (3,9) contains 9 → invalid\n   • (6,6) repeats 6 → invalid\n5. For each remaining pair, form the sorted list [a,9,9,b] (since a < 9 < b or a < b < 9) and compute the median (the average of the two middle values):\n   • (1,11) → [1,9,9,11], median = (9+9)/2 = 9 (in the list) → invalid\n   • (2,10) → [2,9,9,10], median = 9 → invalid\n   • (4,8) → [4,8,9,9], median = (8+9)/2 = 8.5 (not integer) → invalid\n   • (5,7) → [5,7,9,9], median = (7+9)/2 = 8, which is an integer not in the list → valid\n6. Therefore, the only valid choice is a = 5 and b = 7, giving the list [5,7,9,9].; answer: The list contains two 9’s, one 5, and one 7.\nCritic agent ncK5, providing feedback, thinking: The Sub-task 3 analysis is thorough and correctly identifies all positive pairs summing to 12, excludes invalid options containing 9 or duplicates, computes each list’s median properly, and finds that only [5, 7, 9, 9] yields an integer median (8) not in the list. This reasoning is sound.; answer: The identification of 5 and 7 as the remaining integers is correct.\nReflexion CoT agent TgrL, refining potential integers identification, thinking: 1.

From Sub-task 3, the only candidate pairs (a,b) that sum with two 9’s to 30 and pass the initial exclusions were (5,7), giving the multiset {5,7,9,9}.\n2. To check the median condition: sort the list as [5,7,9,9]. With four elements, the median is the average of the 2nd and 3rd entries: median = (7+9)/2 = 8.\n3. Verify the median is an integer (8) and that 8 does not appear among the list entries (5,7,9,9).\n4. No other pair from Sub-task 3 yields an integer median that is not already in the list.

Fix two 9’s: their sum is 18. The other two entries a and b must satisfy a+b = 30−18 = 12, with 1 ≤ a ≤ b < 9 (otherwise 9 wouldn’t be the unique mode or entries would repeat 9).  \n2. Possible pairs (a,b) summing to 12 are (1,11),(2,10),(3,9),(4,8),(5,7),(6,6).  \n   • (3,9) and (6,6) are invalid: (3,9) introduces a third 9 so mode isn’t unique; (6,6) makes 6 repeat twice but then list has tie for mode between 6 and 9.  \n   • That leaves (1,11),(2,10),(4,8),(5,7).  \n3.

Step 1: Since 9 is the unique mode, it must appear at least twice. More than two 9s would exceed the sum or lose uniqueness, so exactly two 9s. Their sum is 18, so the other two entries a and b satisfy a + b = 12, with 1 ≤ a ≤ b and neither equals 9 (to avoid extra 9s). Step 2: List all pairs (a,b) summing to 12: (1,11),(2,10),(3,9),(4,8),(5,7),(6,6). Eliminate (3,9) because it adds a third 9, and (6,6) because that creates two 6s tying mode with 9.

Since 9 must occur more than any other number and the total is 30, the only way is to include exactly two 9’s (3 or more 9’s would make the other entries too small or nonexistent; one 9 cannot be a mode). Remove two 9’s: the remaining two numbers a and b must satisfy a+b = 30−18 = 12, with 1 ≤ a ≤ b and neither equal to 9 (to keep 9 the unique mode).

For each, form sorted list [a,9,9,b] and compute median=(2nd+3rd)/2:\n   • [1, 9, 9,11] → median=9 (invalid, 9 in list)\n   • [2, 9, 9,10] → median=9 (invalid)\n   • [4, 8, 9, 9] → median=8.5 (invalid, not integer)\n   • [5, 7, 9, 9] → median=8 (integer, 8∉list)\n6. Only [5,7,9,9] satisfies all conditions: sum=30, unique mode=9, median=8∉list.; answer: [5,7,9,9]\nDebate agent YZUg, round 1, constructing potential lists, thinking: We need 4 positive integers summing to 30, with 9 as the unique mode and an integer median that does not appear in the list.  \n1. Since 9 must be the unique mode, it must appear at least twice. More than two 9’s would push the sum over 30 or leave too few remaining numbers; one 9 would not be a mode. So we include exactly two 9’s, summing to 18.  \n2. The other two numbers, a and b, satisfy a + b = 30 − 18 = 12, with 1 ≤ a ≤ b and neither equal to 9 (to keep 9 as the unique mode).  \n3. Possible pairs (a,b) for sum 12: (1,11), (2,10), (3,9), (4,8), (5,7), (6,6).  \n   • (3,9) is invalid (introduces a third 9).  \n   • (6,6) is invalid (6 appears twice, tying the mode with 9).  \n   Remaining: (1,11), (2,10), (4,8), (5,7).  \n4. For each remaining pair, form the sorted list [a,9,9,b] and compute the median (average of 2nd and 3rd terms):  \n   – [1,9,9,11]: median = (9 + 9)/2 = 9 → invalid (median in list).  \n   – [2,9,9,10]: median = 9 → invalid.  \n   – [4,8,9,9]: median = (8 + 9)/2 = 8.5 → invalid (not integer).  \n   – [5,7,9,9]: median = (7 + 9)/2 = 8 → valid (8 is integer and 8 ∉ list).  \n5. No other pairs work, so the only valid list is [5,7,9,9].; answer: [5,7,9,9]\nDebate agent AOlQ, round 2, constructing potential lists, thinking: 1. We seek four positive integers summing to 30 whose unique mode is 9 and whose median is an integer not in the list.\n2. To make 9 the unique mode, include it exactly twice (three or more would force the remaining sum too small or violate uniqueness; one would not make it the mode).\n3. Removing two 9’s uses 18 of the sum, leaving two numbers a and b with a + b = 12, 1 ≤ a ≤ b, and a,b ≠ 9.\n4. Possible (a,b) pairs summing to 12: (1,11), (2,10), (3,9), (4,8), (5,7), (6,6). Exclude (3,9) (adds a third 9) and (6,6) (6 would tie as mode with 9).\n5. Test each remaining pair by forming the sorted list [a,9,9,b] and computing median=(2nd+3rd)/2:\n   • [1,9,9,11]: median=9 → invalid (9 in list)\n   • [2,9,9,10]: median=9 → invalid\n   • [4,8,9,9]: median=8.5 → invalid (not integer)\n   • [5,7,9,9]: median=(7+9)/2=8 → valid (8∉list)\n6.

The number 9 appears twice; 5 and 7 appear once each. Thus 9 is the unique mode.\nStep 3: Compute the median. The sorted list is [5, 7, 9, 9]. The median is the average of the 2nd and 3rd entries: (7 + 9)/2 = 8.

Thus the unique mode is 9, as required.\nStep 3: Determine the median. Sorting the list gives [5,7,9,9]. With four elements, the median is the average of the 2nd and 3rd terms: (7+9)/2=8.
