We need the sum of the squares of its elements.\n\nStep 1: Square each element:\n- 5\u00b2 = 25\n- 7\u00b2 = 49\n- 9\u00b2 = 81\n- 9\u00b2 = 81\n\nStep 2: Sum these squared values:\n- 25 + 49 = 74\n- 74 + 81 = 155\n- 155 + 81 = 236\n\nTherefore, the sum of the squares of the list elements is 236.\n\nAnswer:236",
