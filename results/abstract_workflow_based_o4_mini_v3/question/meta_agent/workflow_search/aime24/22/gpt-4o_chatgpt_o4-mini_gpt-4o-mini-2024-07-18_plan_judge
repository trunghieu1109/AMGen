Question: A list of positive integers has the following properties:
$\bullet$ The sum of the items in the list is $30$.
$\bullet$ The unique mode of the list is $9$.
$\bullet$ The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.
Find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

proposed answer: We have the validated list from Sub-task 6: [5, 7, 9, 9]. We need the sum of the squares of its elements.

Step 1: Square each element:
- 5² = 25
- 7² = 49
- 9² = 81
- 9² = 81

Step 2: Sum these squared values:
- 25 + 49 = 74
- 74 + 81 = 155
- 155 + 81 = 236

Therefore, the sum of the squares of the list elements is 236.
