        "response": "We count all rectangles whose sides lie along sides or diagonals of the regular 12-gon and whose angles are right angles. A well\u2010known characterization is that each rectangle has one diagonal as a diameter (joining opposite vertices) and the other two vertices are a pair of antipodes that subtend a right angle at the diameter\u2019s endpoints. Equivalently, if the diameter joins vertices i and i+6, we pick a step k (1\u2264k\u22645) to locate the third vertex at i+k, the fourth at i+k+6. The side\u2010lengths in \u201csteps\u201d are k and 6\u2212k, which indeed satisfy the right\u2010angle condition because chords of lengths k and 6\u2212k inscribe complementary arcs summing to 180\u00b0.\n\nStep 1: Possible (k,6\u2212k) with 1\u2264k\u22645 are (1,5),(2,4),(3,3),(4,2),(5,1). Pairs (1,5) and (5,1) produce congruent rectangles but are obtained by swapping k\u21946\u2212k; counting both in our method is fine because they are distinct as ordered k choices but lead to the same multiset of side\u2010lengths and same total count when summed.\n\nStep 2: For each k, we vary the base index i. Two choices of i that differ by 6 give the same set of four vertices (just swapping the diameter endpoints), so only i=1\u20266 produce distinct rectangles for each fixed k.\n\nStep 3: However, when k=3 the four vertices lie at i,i+3,i+6,i+9, a square. Shifting i by 4 yields the same quadruple (since gcd(3,12)=3), so only i=1,2,3 give distinct squares for k=3, a total of 3.\n\nStep 4: For k=1,2,4,5 we get exactly 6 distinct rectangles each (i=1\u20266). That is 4\u00d76=24.\nStep 5: For k=3 we get 3 rectangles.\n\nTotal rectangles = 24+3 = 27.\n\nAnswer:27",
