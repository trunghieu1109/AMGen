Equate the two expressions for y: x^(10/x) = x^(4/9). Since x>1, exponents equal: 10/x = 4/9 \u21d2 x = 10\u00b79/4 = 45/2. Then y = x^(4/9) = (45/2)^(4/9). Hence xy = x\u00b7y = (45/2)\u00b7(45/2)^(4/9) = (45/2)^(1+4/9) = (45/2)^(13/9). Note that (45/2)^(13/9) = (90/4)^(13/9), so both expressions match. Final decision: xy = (45/2)^(13/9).\n\nAnswer:(45/2)^(13/9)",

Form the product:\n   xy = x * y = (45/2)^1 * (45/2)^(4/9)\n\n3. Use the exponent\u2010addition rule for the same base a: a^m * a^n = a^(m+n):\n   Here a = 45/2, m = 1, n = 4/9\n   Therefore, xy = (45/2)^(1 + 4/9).\n\n4.
