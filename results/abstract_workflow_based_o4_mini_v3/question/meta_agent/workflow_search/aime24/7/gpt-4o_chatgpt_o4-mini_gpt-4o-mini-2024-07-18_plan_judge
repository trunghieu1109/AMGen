proposed answer: We have two equations: 1) log_x(y^x)=10 ⇒ y^x = x^10 ⇒ y = x^(10/x). 2) log_y(x^4y)=10 ⇒ x^4y = y^10 ⇒ y^9 = x^4 ⇒ y = x^(4/9). Equate the two expressions for y: x^(10/x) = x^(4/9). Since x>1, exponents equal: 10/x = 4/9 ⇒ x = 10·9/4 = 45/2. Then y = x^(4/9) = (45/2)^(4/9). Hence xy = x·y = (45/2)·(45/2)^(4/9) = (45/2)^(1+4/9) = (45/2)^(13/9). Note that (45/2)^(13/9) = (90/4)^(13/9), so both expressions match. Final decision: xy = (45/2)^(13/9).

proposed answer: To compute the product xy given x=45/2 and y=(45/2)^(4/9), proceed step by step:

1. Write x and y with a common base:
   x = 45/2 = (45/2)^1
   y = (45/2)^(4/9)

2. Form the product:
   xy = x * y = (45/2)^1 * (45/2)^(4/9)

3. Use the exponent‐addition rule for the same base a: a^m * a^n = a^(m+n):
   Here a = 45/2, m = 1, n = 4/9
   Therefore, xy = (45/2)^(1 + 4/9).

4. Add the exponents:
   1 = 9/9, so 9/9 + 4/9 = 13/9.

5. Conclude the product:
   xy = (45/2)^(13/9).

This expression is exact, leverages the laws of exponents, and remains valid for x>1 and y>1.
