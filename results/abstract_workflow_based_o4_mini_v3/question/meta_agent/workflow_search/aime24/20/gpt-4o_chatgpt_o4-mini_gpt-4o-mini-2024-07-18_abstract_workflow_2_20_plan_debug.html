    <pre>Related original question:

Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textiteautiful\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textiteautiful\) because \(81  = \underline6 \ \underline3_13 \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt81\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textiteautiful\) integers..

 ### thinking #3 by Debate Agent iyld:
1. From prior work, the number of b-beautiful integers is 2^r - 1, where r is the number of distinct prime factors of b - 1.
2. We require 2^r - 1 &gt; 10, which is equivalent to 2^r &gt; 11, so r ≥ 4.
3. Therefore b - 1 must have at least four distinct prime divisors.
4. To minimize b, choose the four smallest primes: 2, 3, 5, and 7.
5. Their product is 2 × 3 × 5 × 7 = 210, giving the smallest b - 1 with r = 4.
6. Hence b = 210 + 1 = 211 is the smallest base with more than ten b-beautiful integers.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent 6n5H:
We have shown that the number of b-beautiful integers is 2^r - 1, where r is the number of distinct prime factors of N = b - 1. We need 2^r - 1 &gt; 10, i.e. 2^r &gt; 11, which requires r ≥ 4. To minimize b, we choose the smallest 4 primes: 2, 3, 5, 7. Their product is N = 2·3·5·7 = 210, so b - 1 = 210 and hence b = 210 + 1 = 211.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 5: Finalize smallest base b resulting in more than ten valid integers. 

 then justify completely and detailedly, step-by-step why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. 
                If stuck in loop and cannot to solve this problem, stop and add [TOO HARD] in the last position.
                Again, your task is only to answer the question Sub-task 5: Finalize smallest base b resulting in more than ten valid integers. and explaination.</pre>

    <pre>We need the smallest base b≥2 for which there are more than ten b-beautiful integers. From prior work, the count of b-beautiful integers equals 2^r−1, where r is the number of distinct prime factors of N=b−1. We require 2^r−1&gt;10 ⇒2^r&gt;11 ⇒r≥4. To minimize b, we choose b−1 to be the smallest integer with 4 distinct prime factors. The four smallest primes are 2,3,5,7, whose product is 210. Thus b−1=210 ⇒b=211.
