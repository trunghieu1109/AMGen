Call a positive integer \\(n\\) \\(b\\text-\\textit{eautiful}\\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \\(b\\)  and these two digits sum to \\(\\sqrt n\\). For example, \\(81\\) is \\(13\\text-\\textit{eautiful}\\) because \\(81  = \\underline{6} \\ \\underline{3}_{13} \\) and \\(6 + 3 =  \\sqrt{81}\\). Find the least integer \\(b\\ge 2\\) for which there are more than ten \\(b\\text-\\textit{eautiful}\\) integers.",

        "response": "We need the smallest base b\u22652 for which there are more than ten b-beautiful integers. From prior work, the count of b-beautiful integers equals 2^r\u22121, where r is the number of distinct prime factors of N=b\u22121. We require 2^r\u22121>10 \u21d22^r>11 \u21d2r\u22654. To minimize b, we choose b\u22121 to be the smallest integer with 4 distinct prime factors. The four smallest primes are 2,3,5,7, whose product is 210. Thus b\u22121=210 \u21d2b=211.\n\nAnswer:211",
