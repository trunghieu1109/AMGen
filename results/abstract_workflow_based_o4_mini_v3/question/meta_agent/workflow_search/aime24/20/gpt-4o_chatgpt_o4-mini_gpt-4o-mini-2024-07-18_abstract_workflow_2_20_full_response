In any base, digits run from 0 to b−1. For a number to have exactly two digits, its leading (most significant) digit cannot be zero, while the second digit may be zero. Denote the leading digit by A and the trailing digit by B. Then:\n\n1. A must lie between 1 and b−1 (inclusive), since A=0 would give a one‐digit number.\n2. B may lie between 0 and b−1 (inclusive).\n3. The numeric value of the two‐digit base‐b number AB_b is n = A·b + B.\n\nSince the smallest choice is A=1, B=0 giving n_min = 1·b + 0 = b (written 10_b), and the largest is A=b−1, B=b−1 giving n_max = (b−1)·b + (b−1) = b^2−1 (written (b−1)(b−1)_b), the two‐digit numbers in base b range from b to b^2−1.; answer: The two‐digit numbers in base b are exactly those n of the form n = A·b + B with 1 ≤ A ≤ b−1 and 0 ≤ B ≤ b−1, i.e. n runs from b (10_b) to b^2 − 1 ((b−1)(b−1)_b).\nCoT-SC agent iaDp, determining potential sums, thinking: From sub-task 1 we know any two-digit base-b number n has the form n=Ab+B with 1≤A≤b−1, 0≤B≤b−1, so its digit-sum is S=A+B and n ranges from b to b²−1. We want S=√n∈ℤ, so write √n=k ⇒ n=k². Thus k²=Ab+B with A+B=k. Also b≤k²≤b²−1 ⇒ k ranges between √b and √(b²−1). Since k is integer, k must satisfy ceil(√b)≤k≤floor(√(b²−1))=b−1. On the other hand, A+B=k cannot exceed its maximum 2b−2, but b−1≤2b−2 for b≥2, so that imposes no new upper bound. And the minimum A+B=1 only matters if ceil(√b)=1, but √b≥√2>1 so lower bound is ceil(√b)≥2. Hence the only possible digit-sum values S=k are the integers k from ceil(√b) up to b−1.; answer: The potential sums of digits A+B that could equal √n are exactly the integers k with ceil(√b) ≤ k ≤ b−1.\nCoT-SC agent 4GK9, determining potential sums, thinking: We know from Sub‐task 1 that any two‐digit number in base b can be written as n = A·b + B with 1 ≤ A ≤ b−1 and 0 ≤ B ≤ b−1.

By setting A=k(k−1)/(b−1) and B=k−A one immediately sees that the three necessary and sufficient conditions are: (i) b−1 divides k(k−1) so that A∈ℤ, (ii) 1≤A≤b−1, and (iii) 0≤B≤b−1. This exactly characterizes all b-beautiful integers, so the method is valid and complete.; answer: For each integer k with ⌈√b⌉≤k≤b−1, compute A=k(k−1)/(b−1) and B=k−A.

This correctly determines which k yield valid b-beautiful integers.; answer: Yes\nReflexion CoT agent 09TQ, refining valid integer check, thinking: To decide for each candidate sum k (where k is an integer with ceil(√b) ≤ k ≤ b−1) whether there is a two-digit base-b number n whose digit-sum equals k and whose square-root equals k, proceed as follows:\n\n1. We must have n = k² and, written in base b, n = A·b + B with digits A (1 ≤ A ≤ b−1) and B (0 ≤ B ≤ b−1), and A + B = k.\n2. From A + B = k we get B = k – A; substituting into A·b + B = k² gives:\n     A·b + (k – A) = k²  ⇒  A(b – 1) + k = k²  ⇒  A = (k² – k)/(b – 1) = k(k – 1)/(b – 1).\n3.

One must then identify those bases b for which that count exceeds ten.  Doing so in closed form—or by hand—for all b is intractable without computer assistance, and no simple formula for the count in terms of b is known.  Thus I am unable to complete the enumeration or exhibit the bases b with more than ten solutions in a fully rigorous step-by-step way here.; answer: [TOO HARD]\nDebate agent ve10, round 0, counting valid n exceeding ten, thinking: We need to count, for each base b, how many two‐digit b-beautiful integers there are, and then find those bases for which this count exceeds ten.  From Sub‐task 3 we saw that an integer k (in the range ⌈√b⌉≤k≤b−1) gives a solution precisely when (b−1) divides k(k−1).  Equivalently, if N=b−1 factors into r distinct primes, then the congruence k(k−1)≡0 mod N has exactly 2^r solutions mod N, namely those k≡0 or 1 mod p for each prime p|N.  Of these 2^r residues only k≡1 mod N (i.e. k=1) is always below ⌈√b⌉ and so gets excluded; the remaining 2^r−1 all lie between ⌈√b⌉ and b−1 for sufficiently large b.  Hence the total number of b-beautiful integers is 2^r−1.  To have more than ten solutions we require 2^r−1>10 ⇔2^r>11⇔r≥4.  The least b≥2 for which b−1 has r=4 distinct prime factors is b−1=2·3·5·7=210 ⇒b=211.  In that case r=4 so there are 2^4−1=15 valid integers.  Similarly any b with exactly four distinct primes in b−1 (for example 331, 463, …) also has 15 solutions; if b−1 has five distinct primes then there are 2^5−1=31, and so on.; answer: The bases for which the count of valid n exceeds ten are exactly those b with at least four distinct prime factors dividing b−1.  In particular the smallest such base is b=211, for which there are 2^4−1=15 solutions.\nDebate agent uQw8, round 1, counting valid n exceeding ten, thinking: We want, for each base b≥2, to count how many two‐digit b‐beautiful integers n=k² there are, and then determine for which bases this count exceeds ten.  From Sub‐task 3 we know:\n1.  n=k² is b‐beautiful ⇔ written in base b as A·b+B with A+B=k, we have (b−1)|k(k−1), 1≤A≤b−1 and 0≤B≤b−1.\n2.  The critical condition is (b−1)|k(k−1).  Let N=b−1 and let N have r distinct prime factors.  Then the congruence k(k−1)≡0 mod N has exactly 2^r solutions modulo N (each prime factor contributes the two residue classes 0 or 1).  Of these solutions k≡0 mod N gives k=0 which is invalid, while k≡1 mod N gives k=1 which is below the required k≥⌈√b⌉ (since b≥2 implies ⌈√b⌉≥2).  The remaining 2^r−1 solutions all lie in the range 2≤k≤N and, for sufficiently large b, also satisfy k≥⌈√b⌉.  One checks that for b≥3 this exclusion argument is valid, so the total number of valid k (hence valid n=k²) is 2^r−1.\n3.  We need 2^r−1>10 ⇒2^r>11 ⇒r≥4.\n4.  Conclusion:  For any base b for which b−1 has r distinct prime divisors, the number of b‐beautiful integers is 2^r−1, and this number exceeds ten precisely when r≥4.\n5.  Example: the smallest b with b−1=210=2·3·5·7 has r=4, giving 2^4−1=15 valid integers.  If b−1 has 5 primes then 2^5−1=31, etc.; answer: For each base b let r= number of distinct prime factors of b−1.  Then the number of valid two‐digit b‐beautiful integers is 2^r−1, and this exceeds ten exactly when r≥4 (giving counts 15, 31, 63, …).  The least such base is b=211 (b−1=210 has r=4, so 15 valid n).\nDebate agent ve10, round 1, counting valid n exceeding ten, thinking: We count solutions per sub-task 3: n = k^2 is b-beautiful ⇔ (b−1) | k(k−1) and digit bounds hold.  The divisibility condition k(k−1) ≡ 0 mod (b−1) has, when b−1 has r distinct prime factors, exactly 2^r solutions mod (b−1) (each prime factor contributes k ≡ 0 or 1).  Excluding the trivial solution k=1<√b leaves 2^r−1 valid k in the range ⌈√b⌉ ≤ k ≤ b−1.  Hence the number of b-beautiful integers is 2^r−1.  To exceed ten we require 2^r−1>10 ⇒r≥4.  Thus all bases b for which b−1 has at least four distinct prime factors yield more than ten solutions.  The smallest example is b−1 = 2·3·5·7 = 210 ⇒ b=211, giving 2^4−1 = 15 solutions.  For r=5,6,… one gets 31, 63, … solutions respectively.; answer: For any base b with r distinct prime factors in b−1, the number of b-beautiful integers is 2^r−1, which exceeds ten precisely when r≥4.  Hence the counts that exceed ten are 15, 31, 63, … for r=4, 5, 6, …; the least such base is b=211 with 15 solutions.\nDebate agent uQw8, round 2, counting valid n exceeding ten, thinking: 1. From Sub-task 3 we have: n=k^2 is b-beautiful iff when written in base b as A·b+B with A+B=k, we have (b−1)∣k(k−1), 1≤A≤b−1 and 0≤B≤b−1.\n2. The key condition is (b−1)∣k(k−1). Write N=b−1 and let N have r distinct prime factors.  The congruence k(k−1)≡0 mod N is equivalent to k≡0 or 1 mod p for each prime divisor p of N, giving 2 choices per prime, hence 2^r solutions mod N.\n3.  Among these 2^r residue-classes mod N, k≡0 mod N ⇒k=0 and k≡1 mod N ⇒k=1 are invalid (k must satisfy k≥⌈√b⌉≥2).  Excluding those 2 trivial solutions leaves 2^r−2 solutions mod N in the range 2≤k≤N+1, but k≡0 mod N+1 gives k=N+1=b which exceeds b−1, so only one of those two excluded (k=0) was outside the allowed k≤b−1 range.  The net count of valid k in [⌈√b⌉,b−1] is therefore 2^r−1.\n4.  Hence the total number of b-beautiful integers n=k^2 is 2^r−1, where r=number of distinct prime factors of b−1.\n5.  We seek bases b for which this count exceeds ten: 2^r−1>10 ⇔2^r>11⇔r≥4.\n6.  Conclusion: for any base b with b−1 having r≥4 distinct prime factors, there are 2^r−1>10 b-beautiful integers.  In particular, the smallest such base is b−1=2·3·5·7=210 ⇒b=211, giving 2^4−1=15 solutions.  More generally, if r=5,6,… one obtains 31,63,… solutions respectively.; answer: The number of valid n is 2^r−1, where r is the number of distinct prime divisors of b−1.  These exceed ten exactly when r≥4, giving counts 15 for r=4, 31 for r=5, 63 for r=6, and so on.\nDebate agent ve10, round 2, counting valid n exceeding ten, thinking: From sub-task 3 we know n = k^2 is b-beautiful exactly when, writing b−1 = N, the congruence k(k−1) ≡ 0 mod N holds and the digit bounds are automatic for k in [⌈√b⌉, b−1].  The divisibility k(k−1) ≡ 0 mod N has one condition per prime divisor of N: for each prime p|N, k ≡ 0 or 1 mod p.  If N has r distinct prime divisors, there are 2^r solutions modulo N.  Two of these give the trivial residues k ≡ 0,1 mod N, which lie outside the valid range k ≥ 2.  Thus exactly 2^r − 1 of the residues yield valid k in [2, N], and for b ≥ 3 all of these satisfy k ≥ ⌈√b⌉.  Hence the total number of b-beautiful integers is 2^r − 1.  To exceed ten we require 2^r − 1 > 10 ⇔ 2^r > 11 ⇔ r ≥ 4.  The smallest b with b−1 having 4 distinct prime factors is b−1 = 2·3·5·7 = 210, so b = 211, giving 2^4 − 1 = 15 solutions.  For b−1 with 5 primes one gets 2^5 − 1 = 31; with 6 primes, 63; etc.; answer: For any base b ≥ 2, let r be the number of distinct prime divisors of b−1.  The number of b-beautiful integers is 2^r − 1, which exceeds 10 exactly when r ≥ 4.  The smallest such base is b = 211 (b−1 = 210), yielding 15 solutions; if r = 5 one gets 31, if r = 6 one gets 63, and so on.\nFinal Decision agent, finalizing valid n count, thinking: 1. Recall from sub-task 3 that a positive integer n=k² is b-beautiful exactly when its two base-b digits A and B satisfy A+B=k and when k(k−1)≡0 mod (b−1).  \n2. Writing N=b−1 and letting r be the number of distinct prime divisors of N, the congruence k(k−1)≡0 mod N is equivalent to k≡0 or 1 mod p for each prime p∣N.  \n3. Each of the r primes gives 2 residue-choices, so there are 2ʳ solutions k mod N.  Among these, the trivial classes k≡0 and k≡1 correspond to n=0 or n=1 (outside the positive two-digit range), leaving 2ʳ−1 valid k in [2,\u2009N].  \n4. Those k all satisfy 2≤k≤b−1 and automatically lie above ⌈√b⌉ for b≥3, so each yields a two-digit base-b representation summing to k.  \n5. Hence the total number of b-beautiful n is 2ʳ−1.  To exceed ten we need 2ʳ−1>10 ⇔2ʳ>11 ⇔r≥4.  \n6. Conclusion: For any base b, if b−1 has r distinct prime factors, then the count of b-beautiful integers is 2ʳ−1.  This exceeds ten exactly when r≥4, giving 15 for r=4, 31 for r=5, 63 for r=6, and so on.; answer: The number of valid n is 2^r − 1, where r is the number of distinct prime factors of b − 1. These exceed ten exactly when r ≥ 4, yielding 15 (for r=4), 31 (for r=5), 63 (for r=6), etc.\nDebate agent iyld, round 0, determining smallest base b, thinking: We need the smallest base b≥2 for which the count of b-beautiful integers 2^r–1 exceeds 10, where r is the number of distinct prime divisors of b–1. 2^r–1>10⇔2^r>11⇔r≥4. So b–1 must have at least 4 distinct prime factors. The smallest integer with 4 distinct primes is 2·3·5·7=210, so b–1=210 gives b=211.

From prior work, the count is 2^r−1, where r is the number of distinct prime factors of b−1. We require 2^r−1>10, i.e. r≥4. So b−1 must have at least 4 distinct prime divisors. To minimize b, we choose the four smallest primes: 2,3,5,7. Their product is 2·3·5·7=210. Thus b−1=210 gives r=4 and yields 2^4−1=15>b10, and no smaller number has four distinct primes.

To exceed ten we need 2^r–1>10 ⇒2^r>11 ⇒r≥4. Thus b–1 must have at least four distinct prime divisors. To minimize b we choose the smallest four primes: 2,3,5,7. Their product is 2·3·5·7=210. Hence the smallest b–1 with r=4 is 210, giving b=210+1=211.

From prior work, a positive integer n=k² is b-beautiful exactly when its two base-b digits sum to k and k(k−1)≡0 mod (b−1). The number of solutions k in the valid range is 2^r−1, where r is the number of distinct prime factors of N=b−1. We require 2^r−1>10 ⇔ 2^r>11 ⇔ r≥4. Thus b−1 must have at least four distinct prime divisors. To minimize b, choose the four smallest primes: 2, 3, 5, and 7. Their product is 2·3·5·7=210, so the smallest N=b−1 with four distinct primes is 210. Therefore the minimal base is b=210+1=211.; answer: 211\nDebate agent iyld, round 2, determining smallest base b, thinking: 1.
