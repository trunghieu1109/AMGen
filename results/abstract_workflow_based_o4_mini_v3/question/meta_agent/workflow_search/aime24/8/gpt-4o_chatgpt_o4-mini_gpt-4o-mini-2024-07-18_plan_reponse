        "response": "We want to count how many starting positions n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2024) are losing for the first player (Alice), because those are exactly the positions from which the second player (Bob) can force a win. \n\nStep 1: Determine which n are losing for the player who moves.  By the standard impartial\u2010game analysis, a position is losing if every legal move leads to a winning position.  Here the legal moves subtract either 1 or 4 tokens.  By computing small values or by induction one shows that a position n is losing if and only if n mod 5 \u2208 {0,2}.  \n\nStep 2: Thus Bob wins exactly when the initial n satisfies n mod 5 = 0 or n mod 5 = 2.  We now count those n up to 2024.\n\nStep 3: Count of n \u2264 2024 with n mod 5 = 0.  These are the multiples of 5: 5, 10, 15, \u2026, 2020.  The largest multiple of 5 not exceeding 2024 is 2020 = 5\u00d7404.  Hence there are \u230a2024/5\u230b = 404 such n.\n\nStep 4: Count of n \u2264 2024 with n mod 5 = 2.  These are numbers of the form 5k+2: 2, 7, 12, \u2026, 2022.  The largest such number \u2264 2024 is 2022 = 5\u00d7404 + 2.  The count of these is ((2022\u22122)/5) + 1 = (2020/5) + 1 = 404 + 1 = 405.\n\nStep 5: Total positions where Bob can force a win = 404 + 405 = 809.\n\nAnswer:809",

        "response": "We need to count the number of positive integers n \u2264 2024 for which Bob (the second player) has a winning strategy. In this take-and-remove game (remove 1 or 4 tokens), the positions that are losing for the player about to move (so winning for the previous player) are exactly those n \u2261 0 or 2 (mod 5). Since Alice moves first, Bob can guarantee a win precisely when the starting position is a losing position for Alice, i.e. n \u2261 0 or 2 (mod 5). Count these:\n1. n \u2261 0 (mod 5): the numbers are 5, 10, 15, \u2026, 2020. The count is \u230a2024/5\u230b = 404.\n2. n \u2261 2 (mod 5): the numbers are 2, 7, 12, \u2026, 2022. The largest term is 2022 = 2 + 5\u00b7404, so there are 404 + 1 = 405 such n.\nTotal = 404 + 405 = 809.\n\nAnswer:809",
