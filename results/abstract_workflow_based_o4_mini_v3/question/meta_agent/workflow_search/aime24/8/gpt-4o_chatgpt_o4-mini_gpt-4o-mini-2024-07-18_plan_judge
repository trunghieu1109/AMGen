Question: Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.

proposed answer: We want to count how many starting positions n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2024) are losing for the first player (Alice), because those are exactly the positions from which the second player (Bob) can force a win. 

Step 1: Determine which n are losing for the player who moves.  By the standard impartial‐game analysis, a position is losing if every legal move leads to a winning position.  Here the legal moves subtract either 1 or 4 tokens.  By computing small values or by induction one shows that a position n is losing if and only if n mod 5 ∈ {0,2}.  

Step 2: Thus Bob wins exactly when the initial n satisfies n mod 5 = 0 or n mod 5 = 2.  We now count those n up to 2024.

Step 3: Count of n ≤ 2024 with n mod 5 = 0.  These are the multiples of 5: 5, 10, 15, …, 2020.  The largest multiple of 5 not exceeding 2024 is 2020 = 5×404.  Hence there are ⌊2024/5⌋ = 404 such n.

Step 4: Count of n ≤ 2024 with n mod 5 = 2.  These are numbers of the form 5k+2: 2, 7, 12, …, 2022.  The largest such number ≤ 2024 is 2022 = 5×404 + 2.  The count of these is ((2022−2)/5) + 1 = (2020/5) + 1 = 404 + 1 = 405.

Step 5: Total positions where Bob can force a win = 404 + 405 = 809.

proposed answer: We need to count the number of positive integers n ≤ 2024 for which Bob (the second player) has a winning strategy. In this take-and-remove game (remove 1 or 4 tokens), the positions that are losing for the player about to move (so winning for the previous player) are exactly those n ≡ 0 or 2 (mod 5). Since Alice moves first, Bob can guarantee a win precisely when the starting position is a losing position for Alice, i.e. n ≡ 0 or 2 (mod 5). Count these:
1. n ≡ 0 (mod 5): the numbers are 5, 10, 15, …, 2020. The count is ⌊2024/5⌋ = 404.
2. n ≡ 2 (mod 5): the numbers are 2, 7, 12, …, 2022. The largest term is 2022 = 2 + 5·404, so there are 404 + 1 = 405 such n.
Total = 404 + 405 = 809.
