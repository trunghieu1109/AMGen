    <pre>Related original question:

Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alices play.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 4: Compute the exact number of n ≤ 2024 where Bob is guaranteed to win using the formulated rule. 

 ### thinking #3 by Debate Agent r667:
1. From Sub-task 3, Bob wins exactly when n≡0 or 2 (mod 5).
2. Count of n≡0 mod 5 with 1≤n≤2024: these are 5, 10, 15, …, 2020. The number of such terms is ⌊2024/5⌋ = 404.
3. Count of n≡2 mod 5 with 1≤n≤2024: these are 2, 7, 12, …, 2022. The largest term is 2022 = 2 + 5·404, so there are 404+1 = 405 terms.
4. Total positions where Bob wins = 404 + 405 = 809.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent zSWJ:
We know from the general rule that Bob wins exactly when n≡0 or 2 (mod 5). We count positive n≤2024 in these two residue classes:

1. n≡0 (mod 5): the numbers are 5,10,15,…,2020. The count is ⌊2024/5⌋ = 404.
2. n≡2 (mod 5): the numbers are 2,7,12,…,2022. The largest term is 2022 = 5·404 + 2, so there are 404 + 1 = 405 terms.
3. Total = 404 + 405 = 809.

### answer #3 by Debate Agent r667:
809

### answer #3 by Debate Agent zSWJ:
809

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Make final decision on the count of guaranteed wins. 

 then justify completely and detailedly, step-by-step why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. 
                If stuck in loop and cannot to solve this problem, stop and add [TOO HARD] in the last position.
                Again, your task is only to answer the question Sub-task 4: Make final decision on the count of guaranteed wins. and explaination.</pre>

    <pre>We need to count the number of positive integers n ≤ 2024 for which Bob (the second player) has a winning strategy. In this take-and-remove game (remove 1 or 4 tokens), the positions that are losing for the player about to move (so winning for the previous player) are exactly those n ≡ 0 or 2 (mod 5). Since Alice moves first, Bob can guarantee a win precisely when the starting position is a losing position for Alice, i.e. n ≡ 0 or 2 (mod 5). Count these:
1. n ≡ 0 (mod 5): the numbers are 5, 10, 15, …, 2020. The count is ⌊2024/5⌋ = 404.
2. n ≡ 2 (mod 5): the numbers are 2, 7, 12, …, 2022. The largest term is 2022 = 2 + 5·404, so there are 404 + 1 = 405 such n.
Total = 404 + 405 = 809.
