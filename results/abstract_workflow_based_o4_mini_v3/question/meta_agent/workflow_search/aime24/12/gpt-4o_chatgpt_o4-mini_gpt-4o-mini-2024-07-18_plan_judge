Question: Find the largest possible real part of \[(75+117i)z+\frac{96+144i}{z}\]where $z$ is a complex number with $|z|=4$.
Iteration: abstract_workflow_5_12
proposed answer: 1. We start with the expression whose real part we want to maximize: Re[(75+117i)z + 9/6 + 144i·z], subject to |z|=4.
2. Combine like terms: 9/6 = 3/2, and 117i + 144i = 261i, giving (75 + 261i)z + 3/2.
3. Write z = 4e^{iθ}. Then Re[(75 + 261i)z] = Re[4(75 + 261i)e^{iθ}] = 4(75 cosθ – 261 sinθ).
4. Thus the real part R(θ) = 4(75 cosθ – 261 sinθ) + 3/2 = 300 cosθ – 1044 sinθ + 3/2.
5. The maximum of A cosθ + B sinθ is √(A² + B²). Here A = 300, B = –1044, so the maximal value is √(300² + (–1044)²) = √(90 000 + 1 089 936) = √1 179 936.
6. Factor √1 179 936 = √(144²·8194) = 12√8194. Adding the constant 3/2 gives R_max = 12√8194 + 3/2.
