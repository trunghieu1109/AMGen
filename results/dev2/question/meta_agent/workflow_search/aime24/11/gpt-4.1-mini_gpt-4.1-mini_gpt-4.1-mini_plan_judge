Question: Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.
[asy] size(10cm); usepackage("tikz");label("\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(2,0)--(2,3)--(5,3)--(5,8)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}",origin); label("\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(0,3)--(3,3)--(3,5)--(8,5)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}",E); [/asy]

proposed answer: The problem involves counting lattice paths from (0,0) to (8,8) with exactly 4 direction changes. Each path consists of 16 steps: 8 right (R) and 8 up (U). A direction change occurs when the path switches from moving in one direction to the other. With exactly 4 changes, the path is divided into 5 runs alternating between R and U. There are two possible patterns: starting with R (R-U-R-U-R) or starting with U (U-R-U-R-U). For the first pattern, the 8 right steps are partitioned into 3 positive runs and the 8 up steps into 2 positive runs. The number of ways to partition n steps into k positive runs is C(n-1, k-1). Thus, for right steps: C(7,2) = 21 ways, and for up steps: C(7,1) = 7 ways, total 147 ways. For the second pattern, right steps into 2 runs: C(7,1) = 7 ways, up steps into 3 runs: C(7,2) = 21 ways, total 147 ways. Adding both gives 294 ways. This matches the combinatorial reasoning and identities for compositions of integers and confirms the final count is correct.
