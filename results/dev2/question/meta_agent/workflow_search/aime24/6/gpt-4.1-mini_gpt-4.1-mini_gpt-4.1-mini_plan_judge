Question: Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.

proposed answer: The fraction r^2 = 27/4 is already in simplest form because 27 and 4 have no common factors other than 1. The prime factorization of 27 is 3^3 and of 4 is 2^2, so their greatest common divisor is 1. Therefore, p = 27 and q = 4, and the sum p + q = 31.

proposed answer: Both Debate Agent OXLn and Debate Agent WLrb have thoroughly validated the entire solution pipeline. They confirmed the geometric interpretation that the smallest sphere radius squared is one-quarter of the maximum diagonal squared of the box. The optimization direction to maximize the diagonal length under the given constraints (surface area 54 and volume 23) is correct because the sphere must contain the largest possible box in the set. The algebraic manipulations leading to r^2 = 657/64 are consistent and accurate. The fraction 657/64 is in lowest terms since 657 factors as 3^2 * 73 and 64 is 2^6, sharing no common factors. The arithmetic sum p + q = 657 + 64 = 721 is correct. Both agents agree on the final answer and the reasoning is sound, confirming the solution's validity and correctness.
