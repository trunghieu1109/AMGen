Question: Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_0_8
proposed answer: From the previous analysis, the losing positions for Alice are those where n mod 5 = 0 or n mod 5 = 2. This classification comes from examining the game states and determining which positions are losing or winning for the first player. For n â‰¤ 2024, we count how many numbers satisfy these conditions. There are 404 complete groups of 5 numbers in 2024 numbers (since 2024 // 5 = 404), and each group contributes exactly 2 losing positions (one for n mod 5 = 0 and one for n mod 5 = 2), totaling 808. The remainder after these groups is 4 numbers (2021 to 2024). Among these, only 2022 satisfies n mod 5 = 2, adding one more losing position. Thus, total losing positions = 808 + 1 = 809. This matches the previously derived count, confirming the correctness of the classification and counting method.
