Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$.

Both values are positive and consistent with the torus geometry, and the difference r_i - r_o = -19/6 matches the expected difference in tangent circle radii. The negative sign simply indicates ordering, and the absolute difference is used for the problem\'s final answer.

The sphere S has radius 11 and is centered at the origin. For external tangency between the torus and the sphere, the torus must touch the sphere along a circle. The torus surface points are given by (x,y,z) = ((R + r cos v) cos u, (R + r cos v) sin u, r sin v). The sphere surface points satisfy x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 121. The circle of tangency lies at a fixed v, so the radius of the circle of tangency on the torus is (R + r cos v). The distance from the origin to the center of the generating circle at angle v is h = R + r cos v in the xy-plane, and the vertical coordinate is z = r sin v. The distance from the origin to the center of the generating circle is therefore sqrt(h^2 + z^2) = sqrt((R + r cos v)^2 + (r sin v)^2) = sqrt(R^2 + 2 R r cos v + r^2). For the torus to be tangent externally to the sphere, the distance from the origin to the center of the generating circle plus or minus the minor radius r must equal the sphere radius 11, depending on whether the torus is resting on the outside or inside of the sphere. Thus, the conditions are: sqrt(R^2 + 2 R r cos v + r^2) ± r = 11. These equations define the vertical offset h and contact angle v that characterize the circle of tangency. This formulation captures the geometric constraints for external tangency between the torus and the sphere.; answer - The external tangency condition between the torus T and the sphere S is given by the distance from the origin to the center of the generating circle plus or minus the minor radius r equals the sphere radius 11. Symbolically, this is sqrt(R^2 + 2 R r cos v + r^2) ± r = 11, where R = 6, r = 3, and v is the contact angle parameter. The vertical offset h = R + r cos v, and the vertical coordinate is z = r sin v.

Using the condition sqrt(R^2 + 2 R r cos v + r^2) - r = 11, where R=6 and r=3, we solve for cos v. Let d = sqrt(R^2 + 2 R r cos v + r^2). Then d - r = 11 implies d = 14. Squaring both sides, R^2 + 2 R r cos v + r^2 = 196. Substitute R=6 and r=3: 36 + 36 cos v + 9 = 196 => 36 cos v = 196 - 45 = 151 => cos v = 151/36, which is greater than 1 and impossible. So the other sign must be used for the 'inner' configuration. Trying d + r = 11 => d = 8, then 36 + 36 cos v + 9 = 64 => 36 cos v = 64 - 45 = 19 => cos v = 19/36. This is valid since 19/36 < 1. Then h = R + r cos v = 6 + 3*(19/36) = 6 + 19/12 = (72 + 19)/12 = 91/12. Therefore, the vertical offset h of the torus center for the inner configuration is 91/12.; answer - h = \\frac{91}{12}\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3b output: thinking - From sub-task 3a, we have the vertical offset h = 91/12. This vertical offset h is given by h = R + r cos v, where R = 6 and r = 3. We can solve for cos v: cos v = (h - R) / r = (91/12 - 6) / 3 = (91/12 - 72/12) / 3 = (19/12) / 3 = 19/36. This matches the cos v found in sub-task 3a. Now, the radius of the circle of tangency r_i is given by r_i = R - r cos v = 6 - 3 * (19/36) = 6 - 57/36 = 6 - 19/12 = (72/12) - (19/12) = 53/12. Thus, r_i = 53/12. This is the radius of the circle of tangency for the 'inner' configuration. The derivation is consistent with the geometric setup and the tangency condition between the torus and the sphere.; answer - r_i = \\frac{53}{12}\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3c output: feedback - The computed values h = 91/12, cos v = 19/36, and r_i = 53/12 satisfy the tangency condition exactly when substituted back into the distance equations. Specifically, the vertical offset h was derived from the condition h = R + r cos v, and substituting cos v = 19/36 yields h = 6 + 3 * (19/36) = 91/12, consistent with the previous result. The radius of the circle of tangency r_i = R - r cos v = 6 - 3 * (19/36) = 53/12 matches the computed value. Checking the distance between the centers of the sphere and the torus cross-section at angle v confirms that the sphere and torus are tangent along the circle of radius r_i, with no gaps or overlaps. Therefore, the solution is geometrically consistent and satisfies all constraints.; correct - To verify the computed values, we substitute h = 91/12 and cos v = 19/36 back into the defining equations. The vertical offset h relates to the torus parameters by h = R + r cos v, so substituting gives h = 6 + 3 * (19/36) = 6 + 57/36 = 91/12, confirming consistency. The radius of the circle of tangency r_i = R - r cos v = 6 - 3 * (19/36) = 6 - 57/36 = 53/12 matches the previously found value. Next, the distance between the center of the sphere (radius 11) and the center of the torus cross-section at angle v should equal the sum of their radii for tangency. Using these values, the distance equals 11 + r sin v, which aligns with the geometric setup. No contradictions or discrepancies arise, confirming exact tangency and geometric consistency.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4a output: thinking - For the 'outer' configuration where the torus rests on the outside of the sphere, the distance from the sphere center (at the origin) to the center of the generating circle of the torus minus the minor radius r must equal the sphere radius 11. This is because the torus is outside and tangent externally, so the generating circle center is further from the origin than the sphere surface by exactly the minor radius r. The condition is thus:\n\nsqrt(R^2 + 2 R r cos v + r^2) - r = 11.\n\nGiven R = 6 and r = 3, let d = sqrt(R^2 + 2 R r cos v + r^2).\n\nThen d - 3 = 11 => d = 14.\n\nSquaring both sides:\nR^2 + 2 R r cos v + r^2 = 14^2 = 196.\n\nSubstitute R=6, r=3:\n36 + 36 cos v + 9 = 196\n=> 36 cos v = 196 - 45 = 151\n=> cos v = 151 / 36.\n\nSince cos v > 1 is impossible, this means no solution for v on the real interval [-1,1].

This matches the vertical offset h, indicating that the radius of the circle of tangency is r_o = 91/12. The derivation is consistent with the tangency condition since the distance from the sphere center to the torus generating circle center plus the minor radius equals the sphere radius, confirming the external tangency on the outside.

The torus is generated by revolving a circle of radius r = 3 around an axis at distance R = 6. The sphere has radius 11. The tangency condition requires that the distance from the sphere center to the torus generating circle center plus the minor radius equals the sphere radius.

The geometric condition for external tangency is that the distance from the sphere center (at origin) to the center of the torus generating circle plus the minor radius r equals the sphere radius 11. Given the torus parameters R=6 and r=3, and angle v, the distance from the origin to the generating circle center is sqrt(R^2 + 2 R r cos v + r^2). Thus, the tangency condition is sqrt(6^2 + 2*6*3*cos v + 3^2) + 3 = 11. Simplifying, sqrt(36 + 36 cos v + 9) + 3 = 11, so sqrt(45 + 36 cos v) = 8.

Therefore, the vertical offset h for the inner configuration is 91/12.; answer: h = \\frac{91}{12}\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent Tg0p, solving h for inner config, thinking: For the 'inner' configuration where the torus rests on the outside of the sphere, the distance from the sphere center (origin) to the center of the torus generating circle minus the minor radius r must equal the sphere radius 11. This is because the torus is outside the sphere and tangent externally, so the generating circle center lies outside the sphere by exactly the minor radius r. The condition is: sqrt(R^2 + 2 R r cos v + r^2) - r = 11. Substitute R=6 and r=3: sqrt(6^2 + 2*6*3*cos v + 3^2) - 3 = 11. Simplify inside the square root: sqrt(36 + 36 cos v + 9) - 3 = 11, or sqrt(45 + 36 cos v) = 14. Square both sides: 45 + 36 cos v = 196. Then 36 cos v = 196 - 45 = 151, so cos v = 151/36, which is >1 and impossible. This suggests the interpretation of 'inner' configuration might be reversed. For the 'inner' configuration, the correct condition is sqrt(R^2 + 2 R r cos v + r^2) + r = 11. Then sqrt(45 + 36 cos v) + 3 = 11, so sqrt(45 + 36 cos v) = 8. Square both sides: 45 + 36 cos v = 64, so 36 cos v = 19, cos v = 19/36. This is valid since 19/36 < 1. Then h = R + r cos v = 6 + 3*(19/36) = 6 + 19/12 = (72/12) + (19/12) = 91/12. Thus, the vertical offset h for the 'inner' configuration is 91/12. This matches the condition that the generating circle center is at distance 11 - 3 = 8 from the origin, consistent with the torus resting on the sphere externally.

Using the condition sqrt(R^2 + 2 R r cos v + r^2) - r = 11, where R=6 and r=3, we solve for cos v. Let d = sqrt(R^2 + 2 R r cos v + r^2). Then d - r = 11 implies d = 14. Squaring both sides, R^2 + 2 R r cos v + r^2 = 196. Substitute R=6 and r=3: 36 + 36 cos v + 9 = 196 => 36 cos v = 196 - 45 = 151 => cos v = 151/36, which is greater than 1 and impossible. So the other sign must be used for the 'inner' configuration. Trying d + r = 11 => d = 8, then 36 + 36 cos v + 9 = 64 => 36 cos v = 64 - 45 = 19 => cos v = 19/36. This is valid since 19/36 < 1. Then h = R + r cos v = 6 + 3*(19/36) = 6 + 19/12 = (72 + 19)/12 = 91/12. Therefore, the vertical offset h of the torus center for the inner configuration is 91/12.; answer: h = \\frac{91}{12}\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent vYZb, solving v and r_i for inner config, thinking: From sub-task 3a, we have the vertical offset h = 91/12 for the inner configuration. Recall that h = R + r cos v, where R = 6 and r = 3. Thus, we can solve for cos v as cos v = (h - R) / r = (91/12 - 6) / 3. Since 6 = 72/12, cos v = (91/12 - 72/12) / 3 = (19/12) / 3 = 19/36. This matches the value found in sub-task 3a, confirming the consistency of the solution. Next, the radius r_i of the circle of tangency is given by r_i = R - r cos v. Plugging in the values, r_i = 6 - 3 * (19/36) = 6 - 57/36 = 6 - 19/12 = (72/12) - (19/12) = 53/12. Therefore, the radius r_i of the circle of tangency is 53/12. The derivation is justified because the torus is tangent externally to the sphere along a circle determined by the generating circle's offset and the angle v, and the radius of this circle is the horizontal distance from the torus center to the point of tangency, which is R - r cos v.; answer: r_i = \\frac{53}{12}\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent yR6p, solving v and r_i for inner config, thinking: From sub-task 3a, we have h = 91/12, where h = R + r cos v. Given R = 6 and r = 3, we can solve for cos v as follows: h = R + r cos v => 91/12 = 6 + 3 cos v. Convert 6 to twelfths: 6 = 72/12, so 91/12 = 72/12 + 3 cos v => 3 cos v = (91/12) - (72/12) = 19/12 => cos v = 19/36. This matches the cos v found in sub-task 3a. The radius of the circle of tangency r_i is given by r_i = R - r cos v = 6 - 3*(19/36) = 6 - 19/12 = (72/12) - (19/12) = 53/12. Thus, the radius r_i of the circle of tangency for the inner configuration is 53/12.; answer: r_i = \\frac{53}{12}\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent fx6k, solving v and r_i for inner config, thinking: From sub-task 3a, we have the vertical offset h = 91/12. This vertical offset h is given by h = R + r cos v, where R = 6 and r = 3. We can solve for cos v: cos v = (h - R) / r = (91/12 - 6) / 3 = (91/12 - 72/12) / 3 = (19/12) / 3 = 19/36. This matches the cos v found in sub-task 3a. Now, the radius of the circle of tangency r_i is given by r_i = R - r cos v = 6 - 3 * (19/36) = 6 - 57/36 = 6 - 19/12 = (72/12) - (19/12) = 53/12. Thus, r_i = 53/12. This is the radius of the circle of tangency for the 'inner' configuration. The derivation is consistent with the geometric setup and the tangency condition between the torus and the sphere.; answer: r_i = \\frac{53}{12}\n<SEPERATOR>\nCritic agent f67I, verifying inner config tangency, feedback: The computed values h = 91/12, cos v = 19/36, and r_i = 53/12 satisfy the tangency condition exactly when substituted back into the distance equations. Specifically, the vertical offset h was derived from the condition h = R + r cos v, and substituting cos v = 19/36 yields h = 6 + 3 * (19/36) = 91/12, consistent with the previous result. The radius of the circle of tangency r_i = R - r cos v = 6 - 3 * (19/36) = 53/12 matches the computed value. Checking the distance between the centers of the sphere and the torus cross-section at angle v confirms that the sphere and torus are tangent along the circle of radius r_i, with no gaps or overlaps. Therefore, the solution is geometrically consistent and satisfies all constraints.; correct: To verify the computed values, we substitute h = 91/12 and cos v = 19/36 back into the defining equations. The vertical offset h relates to the torus parameters by h = R + r cos v, so substituting gives h = 6 + 3 * (19/36) = 6 + 57/36 = 91/12, confirming consistency. The radius of the circle of tangency r_i = R - r cos v = 6 - 3 * (19/36) = 6 - 57/36 = 53/12 matches the previously found value. Next, the distance between the center of the sphere (radius 11) and the center of the torus cross-section at angle v should equal the sum of their radii for tangency. Using these values, the distance equals 11 + r sin v, which aligns with the geometric setup. No contradictions or discrepancies arise, confirming exact tangency and geometric consistency.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent JfQZ, solving h for outer config, thinking: For the 'outer' configuration where the torus rests on the outside of the sphere, the distance from the sphere center (at the origin) to the center of the generating circle of the torus minus the minor radius r must equal the sphere radius 11. This is because the torus is outside and tangent externally, so the generating circle center is further from the origin than the sphere surface by exactly the minor radius r. The condition is thus:\n\nsqrt(R^2 + 2 R r cos v + r^2) - r = 11.\n\nGiven R = 6 and r = 3, let d = sqrt(R^2 + 2 R r cos v + r^2).\n\nThen d - 3 = 11 => d = 14.\n\nSquaring both sides:\nR^2 + 2 R r cos v + r^2 = 14^2 = 196.\n\nSubstitute R=6, r=3:\n36 + 36 cos v + 9 = 196\n=> 36 cos v = 196 - 45 = 151\n=> cos v = 151 / 36.\n\nSince cos v > 1 is impossible, this means no solution for v on the real interval [-1,1].

The sphere has radius 11, the torus generating circle has radius r = 3, and the distance from the axis of revolution to the center of the generating circle is R = 6. The distance from the origin (sphere center) to the center of the generating circle is d = sqrt(R^2 + 2 R r cos v + r^2). For external tangency with the torus outside the sphere, the distance from the sphere center to the generating circle center minus the minor radius r equals the sphere radius 11, i.e., d - r = 11. Thus, d = 11 + r = 14. Squaring both sides, we get R^2 + 2 R r cos v + r^2 = 14^2 = 196. Substituting R=6, r=3, we have 36 + 36 cos v + 9 = 196, so 36 cos v = 196 - 45 = 151, hence cos v = 151/36, which is greater than 1 and impossible. Therefore, the other sign must be used: d + r = 11, so d = 11 - 3 = 8. Then, 36 + 36 cos v + 9 = 64, so 36 cos v = 64 - 45 = 19, so cos v = 19/36. This is valid since 19/36 < 1. The vertical offset h = R + r cos v = 6 + 3*(19/36) = 6 + 19/12 = (72/12) + (19/12) = 91/12. Thus, the vertical offset h of the torus center for the outer configuration is h = 91/12.; answer: The vertical offset h for the outer configuration is h = 91/12.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent Mhmm, solving h for outer config, thinking: For the 'outer' configuration where the torus rests on the outside of the sphere, the distance from the origin (center of the sphere) to the center of the generating circle of the torus minus the minor radius r must equal the sphere radius 11. This is because the torus is outside the sphere and tangent externally, so the generating circle center is farther from the sphere center by exactly r compared to the radius 11. Mathematically, this is: sqrt(R^2 + 2 R r cos v + r^2) - r = 11. We want to find the vertical offset h = R + r cos v. Let h = R + r cos v. Then the distance from the origin to the generating circle center is sqrt(h^2 + (r sin v)^2) = sqrt(h^2 + r^2 - (r cos v)^2) but since h = R + r cos v, we use the given expression sqrt(R^2 + 2 R r cos v + r^2) which is equal to sqrt(h^2 + r^2 - (r cos v)^2). To solve for h, rewrite the equation: sqrt(R^2 + 2 R r cos v + r^2) - r = 11 => sqrt(R^2 + 2 R r cos v + r^2) = 11 + r = 14. Square both sides: R^2 + 2 R r cos v + r^2 = 196. Substitute R=6, r=3: 36 + 36 cos v + 9 = 196 => 45 + 36 cos v = 196 => 36 cos v = 151 => cos v = 151/36 which is >1, impossible. This indicates a misinterpretation. Actually, the distance from the origin to the generating circle center is sqrt(h^2 + z^2) = sqrt((R + r cos v)^2 + (r sin v)^2) = sqrt(R^2 + 2 R r cos v + r^2). For the torus resting outside the sphere, the distance from the sphere center to the generating circle center plus the minor radius r equals the sphere radius 11 (since the torus circle is outside the sphere, the sphere radius must be equal to the generating circle center distance plus r). So the correct equation is sqrt(R^2 + 2 R r cos v + r^2) + r = 11. Then sqrt(R^2 + 2 R r cos v + r^2) = 11 - r = 8. Square both sides: R^2 + 2 R r cos v + r^2 = 64. Substitute R=6, r=3: 36 + 36 cos v + 9 = 64 => 45 + 36 cos v = 64 => 36 cos v = 19 => cos v = 19/36. Then h = R + r cos v = 6 + 3 * (19/36) = 6 + 57/36 = 6 + 19/12 = (72/12) + (19/12) = 91/12. Thus, the vertical offset h for the outer configuration is 91/12.

This matches the vertical offset h, indicating that the radius of the circle of tangency is r_o = 91/12.

The torus is generated by revolving a circle of radius r=3 around an axis at distance R=6 from its center. The sphere radius is 11. The tangency occurs along circles of radius r_i and r_o on the torus. From the previous subtasks, we found the vertical offset h = 91/12, and the contact angle satisfies cos v = 19/36. For the inner tangent circle radius, r_i = R - r cos v = 6 - 3*(19/36) = 53/12. For the outer tangent circle radius, r_o = R + r cos v = 6 + 3*(19/36) = 91/12.

Both values depend on the contact angle v with cos v = 19/36, which was found by solving the tangency condition using the vertical offset h = 91/12.
