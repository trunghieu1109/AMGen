Question: Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: The conditional probability that Jen wins the grand prize given that she won a prize is the ratio of the number of grand prize winning outcomes (all 4 numbers match) to the number of prize winning outcomes (at least 2 numbers match). From previous calculations, the number of grand prize winning outcomes is 1, and the number of prize winning outcomes is 115. Therefore, the conditional probability is 1/115. Since 1 and 115 have no common factors other than 1, the fraction is already in lowest terms. The problem asks for m + n where the probability is m/n, so m + n = 1 + 115 = 116.
