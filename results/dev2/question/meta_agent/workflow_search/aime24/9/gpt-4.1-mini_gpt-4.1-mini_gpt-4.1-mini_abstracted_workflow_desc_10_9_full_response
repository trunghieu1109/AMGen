Question: Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent XzpO', content='The conditional probability that Jen wins the grand prize given that she won a prize is the ratio of the number of grand prize winning outcomes (all 4 numbers match) to the number of prize winning outcomes (at least 2 numbers match). From previous calculations, the number of grand prize winning outcomes is 1, and the number of prize winning outcomes is 115. Therefore, the conditional probability is 1/115. Since 1 and 115 have no common factors other than 1, the fraction is already in lowest terms.

The lottery also picks 4 distinct numbers from S. We want to find the number of ways the lottery's 4 numbers can have at least 2 numbers in common with Jen's chosen 4 numbers. Let Jen's chosen set be J with 4 numbers. The lottery's chosen set L also has 4 numbers. We want |J ∩ L| ≥ 2. The possible intersection sizes are 2, 3, or 4. Calculate the number of lottery sets with exactly 2, 3, or 4 common numbers with J. For intersection size k, the number of such sets is: choose k numbers from Jen's 4 numbers: C(4, k), and choose (4 - k) numbers from the remaining 6 numbers (since total 10 numbers, 4 chosen by Jen, 6 not chosen by Jen): C(6, 4 - k). So total number of sets with intersection k is C(4, k)*C(6, 4 - k). For k=2: C(4, 2)*C(6, 2) = 6 * 15 = 90. For k=3: C(4, 3)*C(6, 1) = 4 * 6 = 24. For k=4: C(4, 4)*C(6, 0) = 1 * 1 = 1.

The total set is S with 10 numbers. The number of ways to choose 4 numbers from S that have exactly k numbers in common with J is: C(4, k) * C(6, 4-k), because we choose k numbers from Jen's 4 numbers and (4-k) numbers from the remaining 6 numbers (since 10 - 4 = 6). We want to find the sum for k = 2, 3, 4. For k=2: C(4,2)*C(6,2) = 6*15=90 For k=3: C(4,3)*C(6,1) = 4*6=24 For k=4: C(4,4)*C(6,0) = 1*1=1 Total = 90+24+1=115.
