Question: Find the number of triples of nonnegative integers \((a,b,c)\) satisfying \(a + b + c = 300\) and
\begin{equation*}
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.
\end{equation*}

proposed answer: From the detailed analysis, the solutions to the system are the triples (a,b,c) that are permutations of (100,100,100) and (0,100,200). The triple (100,100,100) is unique since all elements are equal, so it counts as 1 solution. The triple (0,100,200) has three distinct elements, so the number of permutations is 3! = 6. Therefore, the total number of solutions is 1 + 6 = 7. This aggregation is correct because it accounts for all permutations of the identified solution triples, and no other triples satisfy the given polynomial constraint and sum condition.

proposed answer: The problem requires counting the number of triples (a,b,c) of nonnegative integers such that a + b + c = 300 and a certain symmetric polynomial expression equals 6,000,000. Given the symmetry in the polynomial and the sum constraint, solutions can be grouped by their distinct values and permutations. The previous sub-tasks have enumerated candidate solutions and verified them rigorously, resulting in 601 valid solutions after considering all permutations and avoiding double counting via inclusion-exclusion principles. The verification process included algebraic checks, quadratic equation solutions, and symmetry considerations to ensure completeness and correctness. Since the polynomial and sum constraints are symmetric in a,b,c, counting distinct triples requires careful handling of permutations to avoid overcounting identical solutions. The final count of 601 solutions reflects this careful aggregation and verification. Therefore, the total number of valid triples (a,b,c) satisfying the conditions is 601, and the verification report confirms that the solution set is complete and correct with no missed or extraneous solutions.
