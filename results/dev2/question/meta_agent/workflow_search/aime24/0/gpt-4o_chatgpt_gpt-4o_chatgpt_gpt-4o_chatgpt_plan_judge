Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: The problem involves a torus and a sphere, where the torus is tangent to the sphere both internally and externally. The internal tangency occurs when the torus is inside the sphere, and the external tangency occurs when the torus is outside the sphere. The internal tangency radius is calculated as the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus minus the radius of the torus's generating circle. The external tangency radius is the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus plus the radius of the torus's generating circle. For the given torus with a generating circle radius of 3 and a distance of 6 from the center to the axis of revolution, the internal tangency radius is 11 - (6 - 3) = 2, and the external tangency radius is 11 - (6 + 3) = 14. The difference is 2 - 14 = -12, but we take the absolute value to get 12. This is expressed as the fraction 12/1, which is already in simplest form. The sum of the numerator and denominator is 12 + 1 = 13.

proposed answer: To verify the derived radii against the sphere equation, we need to consider the geometry of the torus and the sphere. The torus is defined by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis that is 6 units away from the center of the circle. This gives the torus a major radius of 6 and a minor radius of 3. The sphere has a radius of 11. For internal tangency, the torus is tangent to the sphere along its inner circle, which has a radius of 3. The distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 11 - 3 = 8, which matches the internal tangency condition. For external tangency, the torus is tangent to the sphere along its outer circle, which also has a radius of 3. The distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 11 + 3 = 14, which matches the external tangency condition. However, the problem statement suggests a non-zero difference between the radii of tangency circles. Re-evaluating, the correct external tangency should have the torus tangent along its outermost point, which is 6 + 3 = 9 units from the center of the torus. Thus, the correct external tangency radius is 9. Therefore, the difference r_i - r_o = 3 - 9 = -6. The problem asks for the difference in the form of a reduced fraction, which is -6/1. The sum of the numerator and denominator is 6 + 1 = 7, which is consistent with the problem's requirement for positive integers.

Answer:The derived radii are geometrically valid, and the difference in lowest terms is 7.

proposed answer: The problem involves finding the difference between the radii of the internal and external tangency circles, r_i and r_o, when a torus is externally tangent to a sphere. The difference r_i - r_o was found to be 0, which can be expressed as the fraction 0/1. In this fraction, the numerator m is 0 and the denominator n is 1. Since m and n are relatively prime, the fraction is already in its simplest form. Therefore, m + n = 0 + 1 = 1. This matches the conclusion from the related sub-task, where m + n was also found to be 1.

proposed answer: The sub-task 8 already provides the simplified fraction for the difference r_i - r_o as 77/10, where 77 is the numerator (m) and 10 is the denominator (n). These numbers are relatively prime, meaning they have no common factors other than 1. The task in sub-task 9 is to sum these two numbers, m and n, to find m+n. Therefore, we simply add 77 and 10 to get 87.

proposed answer: The fraction 6/1 is indeed simplified correctly, as 6 and 1 are relatively prime. The problem involves a torus and a sphere, and the difference in radii of tangency circles was calculated to be 6. This difference can be expressed as the fraction 6/1, which is already in its simplest form because the greatest common divisor of 6 and 1 is 1. Therefore, m = 6 and n = 1, and their sum is m + n = 6 + 1 = 7. The solution aligns with the problem statement, and the fraction is correctly simplified.

proposed answer: To verify the correctness of the computed difference r_i - r_o and its simplification to m/n, we need to ensure that the values of r_i and r_o are correctly derived from the geometry of the torus and sphere. Let's go through the steps:

1. **Understanding the Geometry:** The torus T is formed by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis 6 units away from the center of the circle. The sphere S has a radius of 11.

2. **External Tangency (r_i):** When the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 11 + 6 = 17. The radius of the circle of tangency r_i is the radius of the torus's cross-sectional circle, which is 3.

3. **Internal Tangency (r_o):** When the torus is internally tangent to the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 11 - 6 = 5. The radius of the circle of tangency r_o is the radius of the torus's cross-sectional circle, which is 2.

4. **Calculating the Difference:** The difference r_i - r_o is calculated as 3 - 2 = 1.

5. **Expressing as m/n:** The difference 1 can be expressed as 1/1, where m = 1 and n = 1. These are relatively prime positive integers, satisfying the condition.

6. **Summing m and n:** The sum m + n is 1 + 1 = 2.

7. **Verification:** The steps and calculations appear consistent and correct based on the given information. The difference was correctly calculated, and the expression as m/n is valid. The sum m + n was also correctly computed.

Therefore, the computed difference and its simplification to m/n are correct.

proposed answer: To verify the correctness of the computed difference and the simplification to m/n, we need to analyze the geometry of the torus and the sphere. The torus is formed by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis 6 units away, resulting in a major radius of 6 and a minor radius of 3. The sphere has a radius of 11. When the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 14 (11 + 3). The inner and outer radii of tangency, r_i and r_o, are determined by the geometry of the torus and sphere. The difference r_i - r_o is calculated based on these tangency conditions. The given values are r_i = 3 and r_o = 2*sqrt(7). The difference is r_i - r_o = 3 - 2*sqrt(7). This expression is irrational and cannot be expressed as a simple fraction m/n with integer m and n. Therefore, the problem as stated is not solvable in the desired form without further information or assumptions. The previous analysis correctly identified that the expression 3 - 2*sqrt(7) cannot be simplified to a rational number of the form m/n. Thus, the conclusion is that the computed difference and the attempt to simplify it to m/n were correctly identified as not possible given the irrational nature of the expression.

proposed answer: 1. The problem involves finding the difference between the radii of two tangent circles when a torus is externally tangent to a sphere. The given values for these radii are r_i = 2 and r_o = 8.
2. The difference is calculated as r_i - r_o = 2 - 8 = -6.
3. This difference is expressed as a fraction: -6/1.
4. To ensure the fraction is in its simplest form, we check if the numerator and denominator are relatively prime.
5. The numerator is -6 and the denominator is 1. Since any number and 1 are relatively prime, -6 and 1 are relatively prime.
6. Therefore, the fraction -6/1 is already in its simplest form.
7. The problem asks for the sum of m and n, where the difference is expressed as m/n. Here, m = -6 and n = 1.
8. The sum m + n is calculated as -6 + 1 = -5.
9. The previous feedback suggested that the sum should be 6 + 1, but this is incorrect because m is -6, not 6.
