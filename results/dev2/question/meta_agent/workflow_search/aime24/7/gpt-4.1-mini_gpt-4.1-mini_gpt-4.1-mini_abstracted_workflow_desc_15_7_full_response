This approach effectively isolates the relationship between x and y but leads to a transcendental equation without a closed-form solution. The simplification is mathematically sound and highlights the inherent complexity of the problem. However, it also limits the ability to find explicit solutions analytically.

Symbolic computation software could also be employed to explore the behavior of the functions and potentially provide series expansions or bounds for solutions.

Alternative approaches could include directly applying numerical methods like the Newton-Raphson method to the original system of equations without first isolating y in terms of x, or using symbolic solvers that can handle transcendental equations to approximate solutions. These methods might provide more direct or computationally efficient routes to approximate values of x and y.

Rewriting the logarithmic equations in terms of natural logarithms: (x * ln y) / ln x = 10 and (4y * ln x) / ln y = 10. Let a = ln x and b = ln y, both positive since x,y > 1. The system becomes: (x * b) / a = 10 and (4y * a) / b = 10. Substituting x = e^a and y = e^b, the system is: (e^a * b) / a = 10 and (4 e^b * a) / b = 10. From the first equation, b = 10 a / e^a; from the second, 4 e^b a / b = 10 => b = (4 e^b a) / 10. Equating expressions for b and simplifying leads to a transcendental equation.
