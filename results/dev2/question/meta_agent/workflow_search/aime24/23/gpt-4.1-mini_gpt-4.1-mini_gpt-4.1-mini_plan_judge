Question: Find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid so that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is $999$, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is $99$. The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$.
\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\ \hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\ \hline \end{array}\]

proposed answer: From Sub-task 3, we found 45 candidate solutions where the digits (a,b,c) sum to 8, and (d,e,f) = (9-a, 9-b, 9-c). Each candidate satisfies the digit constraints and the algebraic relations a+d=9, b+e=9, c+f=9. In Sub-task 4, we verified that for each candidate, the sum of the two row-formed numbers is 999 and the sum of the three column-formed numbers is 99. This verification is based on the algebraic expressions and holds for all candidates without exception. Therefore, all 45 candidates are valid solutions. Hence, the total number of valid digit assignments that satisfy both sum constraints is 45.
