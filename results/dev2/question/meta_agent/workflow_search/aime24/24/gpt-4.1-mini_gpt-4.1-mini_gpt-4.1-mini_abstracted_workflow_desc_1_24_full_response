Substitute the values of log2 x, log2 y, and log2 z found in Sub-task 2 into this expression. Provide the simplified numerical value. \n\n ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent 7YGf:\nWe know that log2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = 4 log2 x + 3 log2 y + 2 log2 z. From Sub-task 2, we have log2 x = -7/24, log2 y = -3/8, and log2 z = -5/12. Substituting these values, we get: 4*(-7/24) + 3*(-3/8) + 2*(-5/12). Calculating each term: 4*(-7/24) = -28/24 = -7/6, 3*(-3/8) = -9/8, 2*(-5/12) = -10/12 = -5/6. Now summing these: -7/6 - 9/8 - 5/6. To add, find common denominator 24: -7/6 = -28/24, -9/8 = -27/24, -5/6 = -20/24. Sum = (-28 - 27 - 20)/24 = -75/24 = -25/8. Therefore, log2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = -25/8. The absolute value is 25/8. Hence, m = 25, n = 8, and m + n = 33.\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent 7YGf:\n33\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Calculate the absolute value of the result from Sub-task 3, simplify it to a fraction m/n in lowest terms, where m and n are relatively prime positive integers.
