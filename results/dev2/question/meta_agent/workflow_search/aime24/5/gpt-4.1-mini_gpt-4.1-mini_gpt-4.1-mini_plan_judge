Question: Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.

proposed answer: The inradius was computed using the formula inradius = 3 * volume / total surface area. The volume was found to be 48√2 and the total surface area was 110. Substituting these values gave inradius = (3 * 48√2) / 110 = (144√2) / 110 = (72√2) / 55 after simplification. The values m=72, n=2, p=55 satisfy the conditions: m and p are positive integers, gcd(72,55)=1 so they are coprime, and n=2 is square-free. The sum m + n + p = 72 + 2 + 55 = 129. This matches all problem constraints and is consistent with previous computations. Therefore, the computed inradius expression and the sum are correct and final.

proposed answer: The inradius r was computed as r = (72 * sqrt(2)) / (87 * sqrt(21) + 39 * sqrt(2)) in Sub-task 8. Rationalizing and simplifying this expression led to r = (696 * sqrt(42)) / 17323, where 696 and 17323 are coprime and 42 is square-free, as shown in Sub-task 9. The sum m + n + p = 696 + 42 + 17323 = 18061 was found. Sub-task 10 confirmed that this inradius satisfies the geometric relation r = 3V / S exactly, with volume V = 6 * sqrt(2) and total surface area S = (87 * sqrt(21) + 39 * sqrt(2)) / 4, matching the previously computed face areas. No discrepancies were found, and the inradius is positive and consistent with the tetrahedron's dimensions. Therefore, the expression for the inradius and the sum m + n + p are correct and fully verified. The final answer is 18061.
