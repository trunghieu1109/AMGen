This is a linear combination of cosine and sine functions of the same angle θ. Such an expression can be rewritten as a single cosine function with a phase shift using the identity: a cosθ + b sinθ = R cos(θ - φ), where R = sqrt(a² + b²) and φ = arctan(b/a). Here, a = 324 and b = -432. The amplitude R is sqrt(324² + (-432)²) = sqrt(104976 + 186624) = sqrt(291600) = 540. The phase shift φ is arctan(b/a) = arctan(-432/324) = arctan(-4/3). Since a > 0 and b < 0, the angle φ is negative, so the expression becomes 540 cos(θ - φ) = 540 cos(θ + arctan(4/3)).
