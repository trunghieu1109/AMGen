Question: Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). Then \(OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\).

proposed answer: The point C on segment AB is given as (3/8, sqrt(3)/8). To find OC^2, we calculate the square of the distance from O=(0,0) to C=(3/8, sqrt(3)/8). This is OC^2 = (3/8)^2 + (sqrt(3)/8)^2 = 9/64 + 3/64 = 12/64 = 3/16. The fraction 3/16 is already in lowest terms since 3 and 16 share no common factors other than 1. Therefore, p=3 and q=16, so p+q=19.

proposed answer: The point C lies on the segment AB connecting A = (1/2, 0) and B = (0, sqrt(3)/2). Parameterizing C as C(t) = ((1 - t)/2, t * sqrt(3)/2) for t in (0,1), the unique t0 found previously is 3/4. Substituting t0 = 3/4, we get C = (1/8, (3 * sqrt(3))/8). Calculating OC^2 = (1/8)^2 + ((3 * sqrt(3))/8)^2 = 1/64 + 27/64 = 28/64. Simplifying 28/64 by dividing numerator and denominator by 4 gives 7/16. Since 7 and 16 are coprime, the fraction is in lowest terms. Therefore, OC^2 = 7/16, and p + q = 7 + 16 = 23. This matches the problem's requirement and is consistent with all previous results.
