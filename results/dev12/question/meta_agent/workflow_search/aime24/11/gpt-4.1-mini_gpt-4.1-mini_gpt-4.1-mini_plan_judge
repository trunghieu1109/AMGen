Question: Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.
[asy] size(10cm); usepackage("tikz");label("\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(2,0)--(2,3)--(5,3)--(5,8)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}",origin); label("\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(0,3)--(3,3)--(3,5)--(8,5)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}",E); [/asy]

proposed answer: The problem involves counting lattice paths from (0,0) to (8,8) with exactly four direction changes. Such paths have five runs of steps alternating between right (R) and up (U). The total number of R steps is 8, and the total number of U steps is 8. The number of direction changes is four, so the path consists of five runs. The runs alternate directions, so the number of runs of R and U steps depends on the starting direction. If the path starts with R, the runs are R-U-R-U-R, so there are 3 runs of R and 2 runs of U. If the path starts with U, the runs are U-R-U-R-U, so there are 3 runs of U and 2 runs of R. We need to count the number of positive integer compositions of 8 into 3 parts (for the direction with 3 runs) and into 2 parts (for the direction with 2 runs). From Sub-task 1, the number of compositions of 8 into 3 parts is C(7,2) = 21, and into 2 parts is C(7,1) = 7. For the path starting with R, the number of ways is the product of the number of compositions for R (3 parts) and U (2 parts), which is 21 * 7 = 147. For the path starting with U, the number of ways is the product of the number of compositions for U (3 parts) and R (2 parts), which is also 21 * 7 = 147. Adding these two cases together, the total number of valid paths with exactly four direction changes is 147 + 147 = 294.
