proposed answer: To verify the solution, we need to check if the calculated side length of the hexagon (100) is consistent with the given properties of the hexagon and the triangle. The hexagon is equilateral and centrally symmetric, meaning all sides are equal and opposite sides are parallel. The triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF has sides 200, 240, and 300. The assumption is that the side length of the hexagon is half the smallest side of the triangle, which is 200. This assumption is based on the geometric property that in a centrally symmetric equilateral hexagon, the triangle formed by the extensions of its sides is the anticomplementary triangle, where each side of the triangle is twice the side length of the hexagon. Therefore, if the side length of the hexagon is 100, the sides of the triangle should be 200, 240, and 300, which matches the given side lengths. This confirms the consistency of the solution with the problem's constraints.

Answer:The side length of the hexagon is 100, which is consistent with the given properties and constraints.

proposed answer: The hexagon ABCDEF is equilateral and has pairs of opposite sides that are parallel, making it a centrally symmetric hexagon. The triangle formed by the extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. This triangle is formed by the lines extending from the sides of the hexagon, and its sides are proportional to the differences in the lengths of the diagonals of the hexagon. Since the hexagon is equilateral, all its sides are equal, say of length 's'. The diagonals of the hexagon are longer than the sides and are related to the side length by a factor. For a regular hexagon, the diagonals are twice the side length. Therefore, the sides of the triangle formed by the extensions are proportional to 2s. The given side lengths 200, 240, and 300 are in the ratio 5:6:7, which suggests that the side length of the hexagon is proportional to these values. Since the largest side of the triangle corresponds to the largest diagonal, we have 2s = 300, giving s = 150. Thus, the side length of the hexagon is 150.
