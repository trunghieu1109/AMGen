This implies that -1 is a fourth power residue modulo p^2. For small primes, we can test whether there exists an n such that n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2. We begin with the smallest primes and test them. For p = 2, n^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 4) leads to n^4 ≡ 3 (mod 4), which is not possible since n^4 can only be 0 or 1 modulo 4.

This implies that -1 must be a fourth power residue modulo p^2. For small primes, we can test if such an n exists by direct computation. For p = 2, n^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 4) implies n^4 ≡ -1 (mod 4), which is not possible since n^4 is 0 or 1 modulo 4. For p = 3, n^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 9) implies n^4 ≡ -1 (mod 9). Testing small values of n modulo 9, we find that 2^4 ≡ 16 ≡ 7 (mod 9), and 3^4 ≡ 81 ≡ 0 (mod 9), so -1 is not a fourth power residue modulo 9.
