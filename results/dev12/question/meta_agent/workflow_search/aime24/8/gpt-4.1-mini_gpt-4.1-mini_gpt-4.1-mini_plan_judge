Question: Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_8
proposed answer: From the previous analysis, the losing positions for the player to move (here, Alice) are those where n mod 5 equals 0 or 2. This means Bob has a winning strategy if the initial number of tokens n satisfies n % 5 == 0 or n % 5 == 2. To count how many such n are there for 1 ≤ n ≤ 2024, we count the numbers in this range that are congruent to 0 or 2 modulo 5. The numbers congruent to 0 mod 5 are 5, 10, 15, ..., up to the largest multiple of 5 ≤ 2024, which is 2020. The count of multiples of 5 up to 2024 is floor(2024/5) = 404. The numbers congruent to 2 mod 5 are 2, 7, 12, ..., up to the largest number ≤ 2024 with remainder 2 mod 5. The largest such number is 2022 (since 2022 % 5 = 2). The count of numbers congruent to 2 mod 5 up to 2024 is also 404 (since the sequence starts at 2 and increments by 5, the count is floor((2024 - 2)/5) + 1 = floor(2022/5) + 1 = 404 + 1 = 405, but we must verify carefully). Let's verify the count for remainder 2: The first number is 2, the last is 2022. The number of terms is ((2022 - 2)/5) + 1 = (2020/5) + 1 = 404 + 1 = 405. So there are 405 numbers congruent to 2 mod 5. Therefore, total losing positions = 404 (for remainder 0) + 405 (for remainder 2) = 809. Hence, there are 809 positive integers n ≤ 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy.
