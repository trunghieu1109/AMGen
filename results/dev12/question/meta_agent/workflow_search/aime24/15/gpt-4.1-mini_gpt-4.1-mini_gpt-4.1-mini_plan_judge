Question: Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.

proposed answer: To find the number of residents owning all four items (diamond rings D, golf clubs G, garden spades S, and candy hearts C), we use the given data and the inclusion-exclusion principle. Since all residents own candy hearts, the problem reduces to analyzing the ownership of D, G, and S. Define variables for the number of residents owning only one of D, G, S (a, b, c), exactly two of these (d, e, f), all three (g), and none of these (h). Given: a + b + c = 437 (exactly two items including candy hearts means candy hearts plus exactly one of D, G, S), d + e + f = 234 (exactly three items including candy hearts means candy hearts plus exactly two of D, G, S), total owning D = 195 = a + d + e + g, total owning G = 367 = b + d + f + g, total owning S = 562 = c + e + f + g, and total residents = 900 = a + b + c + d + e + f + g + h. Summing the totals for D, G, and S gives 195 + 367 + 562 = 1124, which equals (a + b + c) + 2(d + e + f) + 3g. Substitute known sums: 437 + 2*234 + 3g = 1124, which simplifies to 437 + 468 + 3g = 1124, so 905 + 3g = 1124, and 3g = 219, thus g = 73. Therefore, 73 residents own all four items. This solution is consistent with all given data and constraints, and the logical checks confirm its correctness.
