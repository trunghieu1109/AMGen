Question: Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_14_6
proposed answer: To simplify the fraction \( \frac{p}{q} = \frac{997}{144} \), we need to check if 997 and 144 have any common factors other than 1. 997 is a prime number, and 144 is not divisible by 997, so they are relatively prime. Therefore, the fraction is already in its simplest form. The sum \( p + q = 997 + 144 = 1141 \).

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_14_6
proposed answer: To find the value of r^2, we need to determine the diagonal of the box with dimensions a, b, and c that satisfy the given surface area and volume constraints. The optimal configuration found is a = 2, b = 2, and c = 23/4. The diagonal d is calculated as d = sqrt(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) = sqrt(2^2 + 2^2 + (23/4)^2) = sqrt(4 + 4 + 529/16) = sqrt(8 + 529/16) = sqrt(657/16). The radius r of the smallest sphere that can contain the box is half the diagonal, so r = sqrt(657/16)/2 = sqrt(657)/4. Therefore, r^2 = (sqrt(657)/4)^2 = 657/16. The integers 657 and 16 are relatively prime, so p = 657 and q = 16. The sum p + q = 657 + 16 = 673.
