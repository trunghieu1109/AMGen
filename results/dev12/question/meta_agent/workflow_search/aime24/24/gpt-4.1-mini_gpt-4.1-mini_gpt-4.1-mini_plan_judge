Question: Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations:
\[\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}\]\[\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}\]\[\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}\]
Then the value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: We start by letting a = log2(x), b = log2(y), and c = log2(z). The given equations translate to:

1) a - b - c = 1/2
2) b - a - c = 1/3
3) c - a - b = 1/4

Adding all three equations, the left side simplifies to -(a + b + c), and the right side sums to 13/12. Thus, a + b + c = -13/12.

From equation (1), a = 1/2 + b + c.
Substitute into (2): b - (1/2 + b + c) - c = 1/3 => -1/2 - 2c = 1/3 => c = -5/12.

Using c in (3): c - a - b = 1/4 => -1/2 - 2b = 1/4 => b = -3/8.

Then a = 1/2 + b + c = 1/2 - 3/8 - 5/12 = -7/24.

We want |log2(x^4 y^3 z^2)| = |4a + 3b + 2c|.
Calculate:
4*(-7/24) + 3*(-3/8) + 2*(-5/12) = -7/6 - 9/8 - 5/6 = -25/8.

The absolute value is 25/8. Since 25 and 8 are coprime, the fraction is in simplest form.

Therefore, m = 25, n = 8, and m + n = 33.
