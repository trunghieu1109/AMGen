Question: Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations:
\[\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}\]\[\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}\]\[\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}\]
Then the value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: The problem involves solving a system of logarithmic equations to find the values of x, y, and z, and then using these values to compute the expression \( \left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right| \). The given solutions by the agents have correctly solved the system of equations and found that \( x = 2^{5/48} \), \( y = 2^{1/48} \), and \( z = 2^{-5/12} \). They then computed \( x^4y^3z^2 = 2^{-17/48} \), leading to \( \log_2(x^4y^3z^2) = -17/48 \). The absolute value is \( 17/48 \), which is already in simplest form. Therefore, \( m = 17 \) and \( n = 48 \), giving \( m+n = 65 \). Both agents agree on this result, and the reasoning is consistent and correct.

proposed answer: To solve for the absolute value of \( \log_2(x^4y^3z^2) \), we first express the given logarithmic equations in terms of \( a, b, \) and \( c \), where \( a = \log_2(x) \), \( b = \log_2(y) \), and \( c = \log_2(z) \). The equations become: 1. \( a - b - c = \frac{1}{2} \), 2. \( b - a - c = \frac{1}{3} \), 3. \( c - a - b = \frac{1}{4} \). Solving this system of linear equations, we find \( a = \frac{11}{24} \), \( b = \frac{5}{24} \), \( c = \frac{1}{24} \). We then compute \( \log_2(x^4y^3z^2) = 4a + 3b + 2c \). Substituting the values, we have: \( 4(\frac{11}{24}) + 3(\frac{5}{24}) + 2(\frac{1}{24}) = \frac{44}{24} + \frac{15}{24} + \frac{2}{24} = \frac{61}{24} \). The absolute value is \( |\frac{61}{24}| = \frac{61}{24} \), which is positive. Here, \( m = 61 \) and \( n = 24 \) are coprime, so \( m + n = 61 + 24 = 85 \).
