Question: Find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid so that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is $999$, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is $99$. The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$.
\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\ \hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\ \hline \end{array}\]

proposed answer: The problem reduces to finding all digit assignments in a 2x3 grid where the sum of the two 3-digit numbers formed by rows is 999, and the sum of the three 2-digit numbers formed by columns is 99. From the analysis, the digits in the top row are (a, b, c) and the bottom row digits are (d, e, f) such that a + b + c = 8 and d = 9 - a, e = 9 - b, f = 9 - c. This ensures the row sums and column sums conditions are met. Since a, b, c are digits from 0 to 9 and must sum to 8, the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c = 8 is given by the stars and bars theorem as C(8+3-1, 3-1) = C(10, 2) = 45. Each such triple corresponds to a unique valid digit assignment in the grid. Therefore, the total number of valid digit assignments is 45.

proposed answer: The enumeration method requires counting all triples (a,b,c) of digits 0-9 such that a + b + c = 8. For each such triple, the bottom row digits are determined by d = 9 - a, e = 9 - b, f = 9 - c, which are guaranteed to be digits 0-9. This ensures the row sums to 999 and the column sums to 99. The problem reduces to counting the number of nonnegative integer solutions to a + b + c = 8 with each variable ≤ 9. Since 8 ≤ 9, the upper bound does not restrict the count. The number of solutions is given by the stars and bars theorem: C(8+3-1,3-1) = C(10,2) = 45. Each such triple corresponds to a unique valid digit assignment. The example grid (0,0,8) for the top row and (9,9,1) for the bottom row fits this pattern (0+0+8=8, and bottom digits are 9-0=9, 9-0=9, 9-8=1). Thus, the total number of valid digit assignments is 45.
