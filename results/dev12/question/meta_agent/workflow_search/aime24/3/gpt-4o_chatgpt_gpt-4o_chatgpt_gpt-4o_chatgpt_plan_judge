Question: Define $f(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{4}|$. Find the number of intersections of the graphs of \[y=4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \quad\text{ and }\quad x=4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))).\]

proposed answer: To count the number of distinct intersection points of the graphs within one period, we need to analyze the periodicity and the behavior of the functions involved. The function y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) has a period of 1 because sin(2πx) is periodic with period 1. Similarly, x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) has a period of 2/3 because cos(3πy) is periodic with period 2/3. The least common multiple of these periods is 1, so the overall system is periodic with period 1. Within this period, we need to find when 4g(f(sin(2πx))) = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). The function f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| maps [-1, 1] to [0, 1/2], and g(x) = ||x| - 1/4| maps [0, 1/2] to [0, 1/4]. Therefore, 4g(f(...)) maps to [0, 1]. The graphs intersect when the transformed values of sin(2πx) and cos(3πy) are equal. Analyzing the piecewise nature of f and g, we find that the intersections occur at specific points where the transformed values match. By considering the symmetry and periodicity, we determine that there are 4 distinct intersection points within one period.

proposed answer: The problem involves finding the number of intersections between two periodic functions defined by piecewise transformations of trigonometric functions. The functions y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) are periodic with periods 1 and 2/3, respectively. The intersections occur when both functions are equal, i.e., when y = A(x) = B(y) = x. The analysis involves examining the piecewise behavior of the functions over their respective periods. Agent Kmdh suggests there are 3 intersections within one period of A(x), while Agent VohZ suggests there are 6 intersections within one period of B(y). Considering the periodicity and symmetry of the functions, and the fact that the least common multiple of the periods is 2/3, the intersections should be counted over this interval. The detailed piecewise analysis by Agent VohZ, which considers the specific intervals and transformations, leads to the conclusion that there are 6 intersections. Therefore, the final answer is 6.
