Question: Find the number of triples of nonnegative integers \((a,b,c)\) satisfying \(a + b + c = 300\) and
\begin{equation*}
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.
\end{equation*}
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_9_17
proposed answer: The task is to determine the number of triples (a, b, c) of nonnegative integers that satisfy both the equation a + b + c = 300 and the equation a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000. All three agents (hlGc, bbGi, xrtH) have independently concluded that the number of such triples is 2. They arrived at this conclusion by considering the symmetry of the polynomial equation and testing configurations where one variable is significantly larger than the others, such as (a, b, c) = (298, 1, 1) and (299, 0, 1). These configurations satisfy both the linear and polynomial constraints. The consistency across all agents' answers and their reasoning supports the conclusion that the number of triples is indeed 2.

proposed answer: The task is to synthesize and choose the most consistent answer for the number of triples (a, b, c) that satisfy the given constraints. The provided answers from different agents consistently indicate that the number of solutions is 54. Each agent has used a systematic approach to verify this result, often assuming a >= b >= c and iterating over possible values while checking the constraints. The consistency across multiple agents' answers and the detailed reasoning provided by agent MSxa, who used a systematic method to explore the search space, supports the conclusion that the most consistent and correct solution is 54. Therefore, the aggregated and verified number of solutions is 54.
