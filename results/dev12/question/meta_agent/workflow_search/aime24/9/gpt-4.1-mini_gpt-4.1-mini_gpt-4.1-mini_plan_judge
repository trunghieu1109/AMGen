Question: Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: The problem involves Jen choosing 4 distinct numbers from a set of 10 numbers, and then 4 numbers are randomly drawn from the same set. The total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is C(10,4) = 210. Jen wins the grand prize if the drawn numbers exactly match her chosen 4 numbers, which corresponds to exactly 1 favorable outcome. She wins a prize if at least 2 of her chosen numbers are among the drawn numbers. To find the number of prize-winning outcomes, we consider the intersection sizes between Jen's chosen set and the drawn set: intersection size can be 2, 3, or 4. For intersection size 2: C(4,2)*C(6,2) = 6*15 = 90. For intersection size 3: C(4,3)*C(6,1) = 4*6 = 24. For intersection size 4: C(4,4)*C(6,0) = 1*1 = 1. Total prize-winning outcomes = 90 + 24 + 1 = 115. The conditional probability of winning the grand prize given winning a prize is 1/115. This fraction is already in lowest terms, so m=1 and n=115. Therefore, m + n = 116.
