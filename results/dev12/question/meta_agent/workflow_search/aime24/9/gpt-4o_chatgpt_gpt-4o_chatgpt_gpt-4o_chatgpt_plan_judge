Question: Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: The problem involves calculating the probability of winning the grand prize given that Jen has won a prize. This is a conditional probability problem, where we need to find P(Grand Prize | Prize) = P(Grand Prize and Prize) / P(Prize). Winning the grand prize implies winning a prize, so P(Grand Prize and Prize) is simply the probability of winning the grand prize. From the given information, the number of ways to win a prize (at least 2 matches) is 115, and the number of ways to win the grand prize (all 4 matches) is 1. Therefore, the probability of winning the grand prize given that Jen has won a prize is 1/115. This fraction is already in its simplest form, as 1 and 115 are relatively prime. Thus, m = 1 and n = 115, and m + n = 1 + 115 = 116.
