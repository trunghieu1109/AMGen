Question: Alice chooses a set $A$ of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets $B$ of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of $B$ belongs to $A$. Bob's list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_7_26
proposed answer: The elements of A have been identified as 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, and 4. To find the sum of these elements, we simply add them together: 11 + 10 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 4. This calculation gives us the total sum of the elements in A.
