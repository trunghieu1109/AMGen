Question: Alice chooses a set $A$ of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets $B$ of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of $B$ belongs to $A$. Bob's list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_3_26
proposed answer: From the previous step, we found that the set A corresponds to the powers of two decomposition of 2024 as 2^{10} + 2^{9} + 2^{8} + 2^{7} + 2^{6} + 2^{5} + 2^{3}. This means A = {11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 4} because each element a in A satisfies 2^{a-1} being part of the sum. To find the sum of the elements of A, we add these numbers: 11 + 10 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 4 = 55. Therefore, the sum of the elements of A is 55.
