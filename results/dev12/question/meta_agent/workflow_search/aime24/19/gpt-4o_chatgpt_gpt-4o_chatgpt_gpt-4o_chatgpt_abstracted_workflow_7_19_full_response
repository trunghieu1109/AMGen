Notice that \\omega^k is a complex number on the unit circle, so we can use the identity \\omega^{2k} = (\\omega^k)^2. The expression can be rewritten as 2 - 2\\omega^k + (\\omega^k)^2. This is a quadratic expression in \\omega^k and can be factored as (1 - \\omega^k)^2. \n\nTo verify this simplification, we can expand (1 - \\omega^k)^2: \n\n(1 - \\omega^k)^2 = 1 - 2\\omega^k + (\\omega^k)^2.\n\nThis matches the original expression 2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k}, confirming the equivalence.\n\nTesting for k = 0, we have 2 - 2\\omega^0 + \\omega^{0} = 2 - 2 \\cdot 1 + 1 = 1.

The product \\prod_{k=1}^{12} (1 - \\omega^k) is known to be the Vandermonde determinant associated with the 13th roots of unity, excluding \\omega^0 = 1.

We need to consider the product \\prod_{k=1}^{12} (1 - \\omega^k)^2, as we exclude k=0 to avoid a zero factor. The roots of unity \\omega^k for k = 1, 2, ..., 12 are all the non-trivial 13th roots of unity. The product \\prod_{k=1}^{12} (1 - \\omega^k) is known as the cyclotomic polynomial evaluated at 1, specifically \\Phi_{13}(1), where \\Phi_{13}(x) is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial. The cyclotomic polynomial \\Phi_{13}(x) = x^{12} + x^{11} + ... + x + 1. Evaluating \\Phi_{13}(1) gives us 13, since it simplifies to 13 terms each equal to 1.

The roots \\omega^k are the 13th roots of unity, and we know that \\omega^k for k = 1, 2, \\ldots, 12 are all distinct and non-zero. The product \\prod_{k=1}^{12} (1 - \\omega^k) is a well-known result in algebra related to cyclotomic polynomials. Specifically, it is known that \\prod_{k=1}^{12} (x - \\omega^k) = \\frac{x^{13} - 1}{x - 1} evaluated at x = 1 gives the cyclotomic polynomial \\Phi_{13}(1).
