Question: Let $\omega\neq 1$ be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\]
is divided by 1000.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_19
proposed answer: From the previous sub-task, we found that the product over all 13th roots of unity of the polynomial f(x) = 2 - 2x + x^2 equals 8065^2 = 65,044,225. To find the remainder when this product is divided by 1000, we only need the last three digits of 65,044,225, which are 225. Therefore, the remainder is 225.

is divided by 1000.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_19
proposed answer: From the previous sub-task, the product was computed as 8321. To find the remainder when dividing by 1000, we take 8321 mod 1000. The remainder is the last three digits of 8321, which is 321. This confirms the modular arithmetic step is correct and the remainder is 321.
