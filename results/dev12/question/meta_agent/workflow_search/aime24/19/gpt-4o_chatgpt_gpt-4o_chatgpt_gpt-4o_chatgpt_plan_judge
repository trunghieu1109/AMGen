Question: Let $\omega\neq 1$ be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\]
is divided by 1000.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_7_19
proposed answer: The expression given is \( \prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k}) \). We can simplify each term as follows: \( 2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k} = (1 - \omega^k)^2 \). Therefore, the product becomes \( \prod_{k=0}^{12} (1 - \omega^k)^2 = \left(\prod_{k=0}^{12} (1 - \omega^k)\right)^2 \). The product \( \prod_{k=0}^{12} (1 - \omega^k) \) is known to be 13, because it is the value of the derivative of \( x^{13} - 1 \) at \( x = 1 \), which is 13. Thus, the entire product simplifies to \( 13^2 = 169 \). We need to find the remainder of 169 when divided by 1000. Since 169 is less than 1000, the remainder is simply 169.

proposed answer: The product we need to evaluate is \( \prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k}) \) where \( \omega \) is a 13th root of unity. We can simplify the expression inside the product: \( 2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k} = (1 - \omega^k)^2 \). Therefore, the product becomes \( \prod_{k=0}^{12} (1 - \omega^k)^2 \). Since \( \omega^0 = 1 \), the term for \( k=0 \) is \( (1 - 1)^2 = 0 \), which makes the entire product zero. Thus, the product includes a zero factor, and the entire product evaluates to zero. Therefore, the remainder when this product is divided by 1000 is 0.
