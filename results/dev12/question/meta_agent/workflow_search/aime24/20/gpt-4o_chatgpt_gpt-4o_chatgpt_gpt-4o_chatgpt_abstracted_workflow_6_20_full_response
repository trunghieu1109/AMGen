Question: Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.

Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent vpKm', content='To determine the smallest base b for which the count of b-beautiful integers exceeds ten, we need to count the number of valid pairs (a, c) for each base b. A b-beautiful integer n is such that n = ab + c, where a and c are digits in base b, and a + c = sqrt(n) is a perfect square. We iterate over possible perfect squares k^2 such that k^2 < 2b. For each k^2, we find pairs (a, c) such that a + c = k^2, with 0 < a < b and 0 <= c < b. We count the number of such pairs for each base b.
