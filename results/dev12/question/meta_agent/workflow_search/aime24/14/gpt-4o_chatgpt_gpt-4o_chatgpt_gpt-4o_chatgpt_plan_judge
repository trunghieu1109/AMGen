Question: Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.

proposed answer: To verify the solution, we need to ensure that the derived value of BD^2 is consistent with the geometric and algebraic constraints of the problem. The hyperbola is given by \( \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \), which has a transverse axis along the x-axis and a conjugate axis along the y-axis. The vertices of the hyperbola are at \((\pm \sqrt{20}, 0)\). The rhombus ABCD has diagonals intersecting at the origin, and the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. The maximum length of diagonal AC is determined by the distance between the vertices of the hyperbola, which is \(2\sqrt{20}\). The maximum possible length of diagonal BD occurs when the rhombus is oriented such that the diagonals align with the axes of symmetry of the hyperbola. Thus, the maximum length of diagonal BD is \(2\sqrt{24}\). Calculating \(BD^2\), we have \((2\sqrt{24})^2 = 96\). The greatest real number less than this value is 95. This is consistent with the constraints of the problem, as the diagonals are aligned with the axes of the hyperbola, and the rhombus is symmetric about the origin. The assumption that the maximum occurs when the diagonals align with the axes is reasonable given the symmetry and the nature of the hyperbola. Therefore, the solution is consistent with the problem's constraints.

proposed answer: To solve the constrained optimization problem, we need to maximize BD^2 for the rhombus ABCD inscribed in the hyperbola \( \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \) with diagonals intersecting at the origin. The diagonals of the rhombus are perpendicular and bisect each other. The points A, B, C, and D lie on the hyperbola, and the diagonals AC and BD are related to the hyperbolic parameters. The length of diagonal BD can be expressed in terms of hyperbolic functions as BD = 2\sqrt{20 \cosh^2(t_2) + 24 \sinh^2(t_2)}. The constraint is that the sum of the squares of half the diagonals equals the square of the side length of the rhombus. To maximize BD^2, we consider the symmetry and properties of the hyperbola. The maximum value of BD^2 is achieved when the diagonals are aligned with the axes, which gives BD^2 = 80. Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD^2 for all such rhombi is 80.
