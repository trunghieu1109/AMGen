The hyperbola is given by \\( \\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \\). The points A, B, C, and D lie on this hyperbola and form a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin. The diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular and bisect each other. The expressions for the diagonals in terms of hyperbolic functions are: AC = 2\\sqrt{20 \\cosh^2(t_1) + 24 \\sinh^2(t_1)} and BD = 2\\sqrt{20 \\cosh^2(t_2) + 24 \\sinh^2(t_2)}.

This property ensures that the rhombus is equilateral. Additionally, the diagonals of a rhombus have specific properties: they bisect each other at right angles, meaning they intersect at a 90-degree angle, and each diagonal divides the rhombus into two congruent triangles. When the diagonals intersect at the origin, it implies that the rhombus is centered at the origin, and the diagonals are symmetric about the origin. This symmetry about the origin means that if one diagonal is along a certain line, the other diagonal will be perpendicular to it, and both will pass through the origin.

This means that if one diagonal is along a particular direction, the other diagonal is perpendicular to it, and they both pass through the origin. For a rhombus with vertices A, B, C, D, the diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin. This symmetry means that if point A is at (x_1, y_1), then point C must be at (-x_1, -y_1) due to symmetry about the origin. Similarly, if point B is at (x_2, y_2), then point D must be at (-x_2, -y_2). Since all points lie on the hyperbola \\( \\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \\), the coordinates of A, B, C, and D must satisfy this equation.

This means that if one diagonal runs from point A to point C, and the other diagonal runs from point B to point D, the coordinates of these points must satisfy certain symmetry conditions. Specifically, if A has coordinates (x1, y1), then C must have coordinates (-x1, -y1) due to symmetry about the origin. Similarly, if B has coordinates (x2, y2), then D must have coordinates (-x2, -y2). Since A, B, C, and D lie on the hyperbola, their coordinates must satisfy the hyperbola equation.

All these points satisfy the hyperbola equation.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent CNKS, considering symmetry and positioning, thinking: To establish the condition that the diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin, we need to consider the symmetry and geometric properties of the rhombus. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, this implies that the rhombus is symmetric about the origin. Therefore, if one point of the rhombus is at (x, y), the opposite point must be at (-x, -y) due to the symmetry. This symmetry ensures that the diagonals bisect each other at right angles at the origin, dividing the rhombus into four congruent right triangles. For the points A, B, C, and D on the hyperbola, if we place one diagonal along the x-axis, the points on this diagonal could be (a, 0) and (-a, 0), where 2a is the length of this diagonal. Similarly, the other diagonal, being perpendicular, would be along the y-axis with points (0, b) and (0, -b), where 2b is the length of this diagonal. These points must satisfy the hyperbola equation. However, since we are dealing with a rhombus, the diagonal lengths are related by the equation of the hyperbola. For points on the hyperbola, if A = (x_1, y_1) and C = (-x_1, -y_1), then B = (x_2, y_2) and D = (-x_2, -y_2) must also satisfy the hyperbola equation. The symmetry condition implies that the coordinates of these points must be chosen such that when substituted into the hyperbola equation, they maintain the symmetry and satisfy the rhombus properties. This symmetry and the hyperbola's properties restrict the possible values of x and y for these points.; answer: The condition that the diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin implies that the rhombus is symmetric about the origin.

The length of diagonal AC is the distance between points A and C, and the length of diagonal BD is the distance between points B and D. To find these distances, we use the distance formula. For diagonal AC, the coordinates of A and C are symmetric about the origin: A = (x_1, y_1) and C = (-x_1, -y_1). Thus, the length of AC is 2\\sqrt{x_1^2 + y_1^2}.
