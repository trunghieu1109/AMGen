Question: Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?

proposed answer: The problem involves determining the probability that a randomly colored octagon can be rotated such that all blue vertices end up at positions originally occupied by red vertices. Each vertex of the octagon can be colored either red or blue, leading to a total of 2^8 = 256 possible colorings. To find the probability that the octagon can be rotated to satisfy the condition, we consider the rotational symmetry of the octagon. Using Burnside's Lemma, we calculate the number of colorings that remain unchanged under each rotation. There are 8 rotations (0, 45, 90, ..., 315 degrees), and for each rotation, we determine the number of colorings that are invariant. The key is that only the identity rotation (0 degrees) allows for any coloring, while the other rotations require specific patterns. After considering these symmetries, we find that there are 8 colorings that satisfy the condition. Therefore, the probability is 8/256, which simplifies to 1/32. This fraction is in simplest form with numerator m = 1 and denominator n = 32, making the sum m+n = 33.

proposed answer: To solve the problem, we need to calculate the probability that a randomly colored octagon can be rotated such that all blue vertices occupy positions that were originally red. Each vertex is independently colored red or blue with equal probability, leading to 2^8 = 256 possible colorings. We need to consider the rotational symmetries of the octagon, which has 8-fold symmetry. Using Burnside's Lemma, we calculate the number of colorings that remain unchanged under each rotation. For the identity rotation (0 degrees), all 256 colorings are unchanged. For 45, 135, 225, and 315 degrees, no coloring is unchanged because the octagon cannot be divided into equal parts with these rotations. For 90 and 270 degrees, the octagon is divided into 4 pairs of opposite vertices, and each pair must be the same color, leading to 2^4 = 16 unchanged colorings for each. For 180 degrees, the octagon is divided into 2 sets of 4 opposite vertices, leading to 2^2 = 4 unchanged colorings. Applying Burnside's Lemma, the average number of unchanged colorings is (256 + 0 + 16 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 16 + 0) / 8 = 36. The probability is then 36/256 = 9/64. Therefore, m = 9 and n = 64, and m+n = 73.
