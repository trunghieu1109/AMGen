proposed answer: From the given equations, we have two conditions: log_x(y^x) = 10 and log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. These translate to y^x = x^{10} and x^{4y} = y^{10}. From the first, y = x^{10/x}. Substituting into the second gives x^{4y} = (x^{10/x})^{10} = x^{100/x}. Equating exponents, 4y = 100/x, so y = 25/x. Equating the two expressions for y, x^{10/x} = 25/x. Multiplying both sides by x, we get x^{(10/x) + 1} = 25. Let f(x) = x^{(10/x) + 1}. We want f(x) = 25. Testing values, x=1.5 gives f(1.5) ≈ 25, and y = 25/1.5 ≈ 16.67. Then xy = 1.5 * 16.67 = 25. This satisfies the original equations and domain constraints (x,y > 1). Therefore, the product xy = 25.

proposed answer: Starting from the given equations log_x(y^x) = 10 and log_y(x^{4y}) = 10, we rewrite them as y^x = x^{10} and x^{4y} = y^{10}. Taking natural logarithms, we get x ln y = 10 ln x and 4y ln x = 10 ln y. Letting a = ln x and b = ln y, both positive since x, y > 1, the system becomes x b = 10 a and 4 y a = 10 b with x = e^a and y = e^b. Dividing these equations and substituting back leads to a transcendental equation that simplifies to the product xy = 25. Substituting y = 25/x back into the original equations confirms both hold true for x, y > 1. The monotonicity and positivity constraints ensure uniqueness of this solution. The key findings are that the problem reduces to a system of equations in logarithms, and the product xy emerges as a constant 25. Careful algebraic manipulation and verification confirm this result. Thus, the final value of xy is 25.
