Changing the thousands digit a to 1: The resulting number is 1000 + 100b + 10c + d. Therefore, (1000 + 100b + 10c + d) ≡ 0 (mod 7).\n\n2. Changing the hundreds digit b to 1: The resulting number is 1000a + 100 + 10c + d. Therefore, (1000a + 100 + 10c + d) ≡ 0 (mod 7).\n\n3.

Therefore, (1000a + 100b + 10c + 1) ≡ 0 (mod 7).\n\nTo solve these, we need to find the modular equivalences of powers of 10 under modulo 7:\n- 1000 ≡ 6 (mod 7) because 1000 = 7*142 + 6.\n- 100 ≡ 2 (mod 7) because 100 = 7*14 + 2.\n- 10 ≡ 3 (mod 7) because 10 = 7*1 + 3.\n\nNow, let's rewrite the conditions:\n1. 6 + 2b + 3c + d ≡ 0 (mod 7).\n2. 6a + 2 + 3c + d ≡ 0 (mod 7).\n3. 6a + 2b + 3 + d ≡ 0 (mod 7).\n4. 6a + 2b + 3c + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 7).\n\nEach equation must be satisfied simultaneously for the greatest integer N.
