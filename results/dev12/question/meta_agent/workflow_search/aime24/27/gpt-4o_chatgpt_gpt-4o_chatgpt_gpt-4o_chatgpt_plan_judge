Question: Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_10_27
proposed answer: All three agents have consistently determined that the greatest four-digit integer N satisfying the condition is 9981. When 9981 is divided by 1000, the quotient Q is 9 and the remainder R is 981. Therefore, the sum Q + R is calculated as 9 + 981, which equals 990. This conclusion is consistent across all agents' reasoning and calculations.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_10_27
proposed answer: The problem involves finding the greatest four-digit integer N such that changing any digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. The analysis and answers provided by the agents indicate that this number is 7770. To find Q and R, we divide 7770 by 1000. The integer division of 7770 by 1000 gives a quotient Q of 7, and the remainder R is 770, since 7770 = 1000 * 7 + 770. Therefore, Q + R = 7 + 770 = 777. All agents consistently found Q + R to be 777, which is the correct and consistent solution.
