Using Euler's formula, e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ and e^{-iθ} = cosθ - i sinθ, we expand each term and separate real and imaginary parts. For the first term: (300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ) = 300 cosθ + 300 i sinθ + 468 i cosθ + 468 i^2 sinθ. Since i^2 = -1, this becomes (300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + i(300 sinθ + 468 cosθ).
