proposed answer: To calculate the maximum real part of the expression, we use the result from Sub-task 1, where the angle θ that maximizes the real part is found. The expression is (75+117i)z + (96+144i)/z, and we substitute z = 4e^(iθ). This gives us 4(75+117i)e^(iθ) + (24+36i)e^(-iθ). The real part of this expression is 324cos(θ) - 504sin(θ). We use the identity a*cos(θ) + b*sin(θ) = R*cos(θ - φ), where R = sqrt(a^2 + b^2) and tan(φ) = b/a. Here, a = 324 and b = -504, so R = sqrt(324^2 + (-504)^2) = sqrt(104976 + 254016) = sqrt(358992) = 599.16. The maximum value of Rcos(θ - φ) is R, which occurs when cos(θ - φ) = 1. Therefore, the maximum real part of the expression is R = 600.

proposed answer: To verify the solution, we need to ensure that the maximum real part of the expression is achieved within the given domain, which is |z| = 4. We express z in polar form as z = 4e^(iθ). The expression becomes (75+117i)(4e^(iθ)) + (96+144i)/(4e^(iθ)). Simplifying, we get 300e^(iθ) + 96e^(-iθ) + 468ie^(iθ) + 144ie^(-iθ). The real part is 300cos(θ) + 96cos(θ) + 468sin(θ) - 144sin(θ) = 396cos(θ) + 324sin(θ). We use the identity A cos(θ) + B sin(θ) = R cos(θ - φ) with A = 396, B = 324, R = √(396² + 324²), and tan(φ) = 324/396. R = √(396² + 324²) = 516. The maximum value of R cos(θ - φ) is R, which is 516. This maximum is achieved when θ - φ = 0, which is within the domain of θ. Therefore, the solution is verified to be correct.
