Question: A list of positive integers has the following properties:
$\bullet$ The sum of the items in the list is $30$.
$\bullet$ The unique mode of the list is $9$.
$\bullet$ The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.
Find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_7_22
proposed answer: The candidate list [1, 1, 4, 6, 9, 9] satisfies all the problem conditions: the sum is 30, the unique mode is 9 (appearing twice, more than any other number), and the median is (4+6)/2 = 5, which is a positive integer not in the list. The list length is even, which is consistent with the median being the average of two middle numbers. No other candidate list found meets all these criteria simultaneously. Therefore, the sum of the squares of the items in this list is the unique valid solution. Calculating the sum of squares: 1^2 + 1^2 + 4^2 + 6^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 = 1 + 1 + 16 + 36 + 81 + 81 = 216.

proposed answer: The candidate list identified in subtask 1 is [5, 7, 9, 9]. Let's verify all conditions: 1) Sum: 5 + 7 + 9 + 9 = 30, which matches the sum requirement. 2) Unique mode: 9 appears twice, while 5 and 7 appear once each, so 9 is the unique mode. 3) Median: The list length is 4 (even), so median is the average of the 2nd and 3rd elements when sorted. Sorted list is [5, 7, 9, 9], median = (7 + 9)/2 = 8, which is a positive integer not in the list, satisfying the median condition. 4) All elements are positive integers. Since all conditions are met, the sum of squares is 5^2 + 7^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 = 25 + 49 + 81 + 81 = 236. No violations are found, and the solution is unique given the constraints. Therefore, the final answer is 236.
