Question: Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.

proposed answer: We are given that Aya walks 9 kilometers and spends t minutes at a coffee shop. The total time including walking and coffee is 4 hours when walking at speed s km/h, and 2 hours 24 minutes (2.4 hours) when walking at speed s+2 km/h. Setting up equations: 4 = 9/s + t/60 and 2.4 = 9/(s+2) + t/60. Subtracting the second from the first eliminates t/60, giving 1.6 = 9(1/s - 1/(s+2)) = 18/(s(s+2)). Solving s(s+2) = 11.25 leads to s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0. Solving this quadratic gives s = 2.5 km/h (positive root). Substituting back to find t: t/60 = 4 - 9/2.5 = 0.4, so t = 24 minutes. For speed s + 0.5 = 3.0 km/h, walking time is 9/3 = 3 hours = 180 minutes. Adding coffee time 24 minutes, total time is 204 minutes. This is consistent with the problem context and other agents' solutions, confirming the answer is correct.
