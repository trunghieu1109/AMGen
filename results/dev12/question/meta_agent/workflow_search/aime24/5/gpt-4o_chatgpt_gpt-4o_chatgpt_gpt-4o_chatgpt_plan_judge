Question: Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.

proposed answer: The problem involves calculating the inradius of a tetrahedron with given edge lengths. The inradius is given by the formula r = 3V / (A_1 + A_2 + A_3 + A_4), where V is the volume of the tetrahedron and A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4 are the areas of its faces. From the previous sub-task, the volume V was calculated as 60√2. The areas of the faces were calculated using Heron's formula, and their sum was used to find the inradius. The consistent calculations from agents uFv3 and 7Rtt both resulted in the inradius being expressed as 6√6/5. This expression gives m = 6, n = 6, and p = 5, which satisfy the conditions that m and p are relatively prime and n is not divisible by the square of any prime. Therefore, m+n+p = 6+6+5 = 17. This is the most consistent and correct solution based on the previous analysis.

proposed answer: In the previous sub-task, the distance from the incenter of the tetrahedron to its faces was determined to be 1. This distance was expressed in the form \( \frac{m \sqrt{n}}{p} \), where \( m = 1 \), \( n = 1 \), and \( p = 1 \). These values satisfy the conditions that \( m \) and \( p \) are relatively prime, and \( n = 1 \) is not divisible by the square of any prime. Therefore, the sum \( m+n+p = 1+1+1 = 3 \).

proposed answer: To compute the inradius r of the tetrahedron, we use the formula r = 3V / S, where V is the volume of the tetrahedron and S is the total surface area. From previous calculations, we have determined that each face of the tetrahedron has an area of A = \( \frac{\sqrt{71040}}{4} \). Since the tetrahedron is symmetric, it has 4 faces, so the total surface area S = 4A = \( \sqrt{71040} \). 

Next, we need to calculate the volume V of the tetrahedron. Given the symmetry and the edge lengths, we can use the formula for the volume of a tetrahedron with opposite edges equal: 

V = \( \frac{1}{12} \) \sqrt{4a^2b^2c^2 - a^2(A^2 + B^2 + C^2) - b^2(A^2 + B^2 + C^2) - c^2(A^2 + B^2 + C^2) + A^2B^2 + B^2C^2 + C^2A^2} 

where A = \( \sqrt{41} \), B = \( \sqrt{80} \), C = \( \sqrt{89} \). 

Plugging in the values, we find V = \( \frac{1}{12} \) \sqrt{4(41)(80)(89) - 41(80 + 89 + 41) - 80(41 + 89 + 80) - 89(41 + 80 + 89) + 41*80 + 80*89 + 89*41} 

After simplification, V = \( \frac{1}{12} \) \sqrt{1166400} = \( \frac{1}{12} \) * 1080 = 90. 

Now, we can compute the inradius: 

r = \( \frac{3V}{S} = \frac{3 * 90}{\sqrt{71040}} = \frac{270}{\sqrt{71040}} \). 

Simplifying \( \sqrt{71040} \), we find \( \sqrt{71040} = 84\sqrt{10} \). 

Thus, r = \( \frac{270}{84\sqrt{10}} = \frac{45}{14\sqrt{10}} = \frac{45\sqrt{10}}{140} \). 

Simplifying further, we get r = \( \frac{9\sqrt{10}}{28} \). 

Therefore, m = 9, n = 10, p = 28, and m + n + p = 9 + 10 + 28 = 47.
