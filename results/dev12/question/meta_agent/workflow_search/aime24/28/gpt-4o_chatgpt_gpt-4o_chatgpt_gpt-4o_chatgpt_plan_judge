Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: In the previous sub-task, the difference r_i - r_o was determined to be 6, which can be expressed as the fraction 6/1. Here, m = 6 and n = 1, which are coprime integers. Therefore, the sum m + n is calculated as 6 + 1 = 7. This is consistent with the previous analysis and feedback, where the values of r_i and r_o were agreed upon by all agents, leading to the same result for m + n.

proposed answer: In the previous sub-task, the difference r_i - r_o was determined to be -6, which was expressed as the fraction -6/1. To ensure m and n are positive integers, we take the absolute values, resulting in m = 6 and n = 1. These values are coprime since their greatest common divisor is 1. Therefore, the sum m + n is 6 + 1 = 7.
