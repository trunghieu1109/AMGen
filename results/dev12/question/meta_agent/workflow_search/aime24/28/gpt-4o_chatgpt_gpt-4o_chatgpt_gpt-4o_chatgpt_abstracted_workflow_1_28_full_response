Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

Extract and Summarize Given Information:\n    - The torus $T$ is formed by revolving a circle of radius $3$ around an axis that is $6$ units away from the circle\'s center. This gives the torus a major radius of $6$ and a minor radius of $3$.\n    - The sphere $S$ has a radius of $11$.\n    - The problem involves two configurations: when the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, it forms circles of tangency with radii $r_i$ and $r_o$.\n    - The objective is to find the difference $r_i - r_o$ and express it as a fraction $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are coprime, and then find $m+n$.\n\n2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:\n    - The torus and sphere are externally tangent, meaning they touch at a single point along a circle.\n    - The circle of tangency is formed by the intersection of the torus and the sphere.\n    - The conditions of tangency imply geometric constraints on the distances between the centers of the torus and the sphere.\n    - The difference $r_i - r_o$ is influenced by the relative positions of the torus and sphere in the two configurations.\n\n3. Identify the Field of Study:\n    - The problem is primarily in the domain of geometry, specifically involving 3D geometry and the study of surfaces like tori and spheres.\n    - Concepts from analytic geometry may be relevant to determine the positions and distances involved.\n    - Such problems are common in mathematical competitions and can have applications in physics and computer graphics.\n\n4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:\n    - The problem statement mentions the torus resting on the outside of the sphere twice, which seems redundant. It likely means two different configurations of tangency.\n    - The exact nature of the tangency and how the radii $r_i$ and $r_o$ are determined needs clarification.\n    - Assumptions about the orientation and positioning of the torus relative to the sphere may be needed to proceed with a solution..These are just pieces of information related to the question.

The torus has a major radius of 6 and a minor radius of 3, while the sphere has a radius of 11. The problem involves two configurations of tangency: one where the torus is closer to the sphere (internal tangency) and one where it is further away (external tangency). \n\n1. **Internal Tangency (r_i):**\n   - The center of the torus is closer to the sphere. The distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is minimized.\n   - The condition for tangency is that the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus (D_i) plus the minor radius of the torus (3) equals the radius of the sphere (11).\n   - Therefore, D_i + 3 = 11, which gives D_i = 8.\n\n2. **External Tangency (r_o):**\n   - The center of the torus is further from the sphere.

The torus has a major radius of 6 and a minor radius of 3, while the sphere has a radius of 11. In the internal tangency configuration, the torus is positioned such that its center is closer to the sphere. The distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus (D_i) is such that the sum of this distance and the minor radius of the torus equals the radius of the sphere. This gives D_i + 3 = 11, so D_i = 8. In the external tangency configuration, the torus is positioned such that its center is further from the sphere. The distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus (D_o) is such that the difference between this distance and the minor radius of the torus equals the radius of the sphere. This gives D_o - 3 = 11, so D_o = 14. The radii of the circles of tangency, r_i and r_o, are determined by the positions of the torus relative to the sphere in these configurations. The circle of tangency is formed by the intersection of the torus and the sphere. For internal tangency, the radius of the circle of tangency r_i is the distance from the center of the torus to the point of tangency, which is the major radius minus the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus, r_i = 6 - D_i = 6 - 8 = -2, but this is incorrect as it should be positive, so r_i = 3. For external tangency, the radius of the circle of tangency r_o is the distance from the center of the torus to the point of tangency, which is the major radius plus the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus, r_o = 6 + D_o = 6 + 14 = 20, but this is incorrect as it should be positive, so r_o = 3. The difference r_i - r_o is influenced by these distances, and the problem asks for this difference in a specific form. The correct calculation should be r_i = 3 and r_o = 3, so the difference r_i - r_o = 0.; answer - The internal tangency condition has the center-to-center distance D_i = 8, and the external tangency condition has the center-to-center distance D_o = 14. The radii of the circles of tangency, r_i and r_o, are both 3, so the difference r_i - r_o = 0.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - To calculate the radius of the circle of tangency when the torus is internally tangent to the sphere, we need to consider the geometry of the situation.
