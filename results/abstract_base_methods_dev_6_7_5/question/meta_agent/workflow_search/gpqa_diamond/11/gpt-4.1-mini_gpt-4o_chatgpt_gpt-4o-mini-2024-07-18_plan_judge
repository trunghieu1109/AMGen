Question: Example(question='Find KE of product particles in,\nPi(+) = mu(+) + nu\nhere Pi(+) is stationary.\nRest mass of Pi(+) &  mu(+) is 139.6 MeV & 105.7 MeV respectively.', choice1='2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV', choice2='7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV', choice3='3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV', choice4='4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV', correct_index=4)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_5_11
proposed answer: The calculated kinetic energies of the mu(+) and neutrino are 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV, respectively. These values match the kinetic energies given in choice D of the multiple-choice options. The problem involves a stationary Pi(+) decaying into a mu(+) and a neutrino, and the conservation of energy and momentum principles were used to derive these kinetic energies. The initial energy of the stationary Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, which is distributed between the mu(+) and the neutrino. The mu(+) has a rest mass energy of 105.7 MeV, and its total energy is calculated using the relativistic energy-momentum relation. The neutrino, being massless, has its energy equal to its momentum times the speed of light. By setting up the equations for conservation of energy and momentum, and solving them, the kinetic energy of the mu(+) is found to be 4.12 MeV and that of the neutrino is 29.8 MeV. These results match choice D, confirming it as the correct answer.
