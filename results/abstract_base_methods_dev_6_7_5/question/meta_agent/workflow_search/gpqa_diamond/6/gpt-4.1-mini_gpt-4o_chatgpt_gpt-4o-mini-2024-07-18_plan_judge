Question: Example(question='The universe is filled with the Cosmic Microwave Background. Consider the annihilation of high energy \\gamma-rays with a photon from the CMB Radiation into electron-positron, i.e. $\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$. From what energy \\gamma-rays would have their lifetimes in the universe limited by this process? Knowing that the average photon energy of the CMB is $10^{-3}eV$.', choice1='9.5*1e4 GeV', choice2='1.8*1e5 GeV', choice3='2.6*1e5 GeV', choice4='3.9*1e5 GeV', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_2_6
proposed answer: The calculated threshold gamma-ray energy from Sub-task 4 is 2.6*1e5 GeV. When comparing this value with the provided multiple-choice options: A) 9.5*1e4 GeV, B) 1.8*1e5 GeV, C) 2.6*1e5 GeV, D) 3.9*1e5 GeV, option C) 2.6*1e5 GeV matches exactly with the calculated energy. All agents agree that option C is the correct choice as it corresponds to the calculated threshold energy required for the gamma-ray photon to pair-produce with a CMB photon of average energy 10^-3 eV.

Answer:C)
Extracted answer: C)
