This interaction can result in the production of an electron-positron pair, which is a process known as pair production. For this process to occur, the combined energy of the two photons must be at least equal to the rest mass energy of the electron-positron pair, which is 2 * 0.511 MeV = 1.022 MeV. The CMB photon has an average energy of 10^-3 eV, which is much smaller than the energy of the gamma-ray photon. Therefore, the gamma-ray photon must have a very high energy to compensate for the low energy of the CMB photon and meet the energy threshold for pair production. This process limits the lifetime of high-energy gamma-rays in the universe because they can be absorbed by the CMB photons and converted into electron-positron pairs.; answer - The process is the annihilation of a high-energy gamma-ray photon with a CMB photon to produce an electron-positron pair, requiring the gamma-ray to have sufficient energy to meet the pair production threshold.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - The problem involves a high-energy gamma-ray photon interacting with a CMB photon to produce an electron-positron pair. The relevant parameters include the average photon energy of the CMB, which is given as 10^-3 eV. From Sub-task 1, we know that the energy threshold for pair production is 1.022 MeV, which is twice the electron rest mass energy (2 * 0.511 MeV). The gamma-ray photon must have enough energy to meet this threshold when combined with the CMB photon's energy.

The process involves a high-energy gamma-ray photon (E_γ) interacting with a CMB photon (E_CMB) to produce an electron-positron pair. The rest mass energy of the electron-positron pair is 1.022 MeV. For pair production to occur, the total energy in the center of mass frame must be at least 1.022 MeV. In the lab frame, where the CMB photon is at rest, the energy of the gamma-ray photon must be high enough to provide this energy. The threshold condition can be derived from the equation: E_γ * E_CMB = (m_e c^2)^2 / (1 - cos(θ)), where θ is the angle between the two photons. For head-on collisions (θ = 180 degrees), this simplifies to E_γ * E_CMB = (m_e c^2)^2. Solving for E_γ gives E_γ = (m_e c^2)^2 / E_CMB. Substituting m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV and E_CMB = 10^-3 eV, we find E_γ = (0.511 MeV)^2 / 10^-3 eV = 2.6 * 10^5 GeV. This calculation assumes a head-on collision, which is the most favorable condition for pair production. The limitation is that not all interactions will be head-on, so the actual threshold could be higher for non-head-on collisions.

Substituting these values, we calculated E_γ = (0.511 MeV)^2 / 10^-3 eV = 2.6 * 10^5 GeV.
