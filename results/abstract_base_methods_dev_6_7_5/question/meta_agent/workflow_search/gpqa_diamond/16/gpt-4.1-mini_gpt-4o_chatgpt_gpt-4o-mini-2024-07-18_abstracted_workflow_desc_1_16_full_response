The equilibrium expression is 5x10^10 = (x)(x)/(0.02 - x). Several agents attempted to solve this by assuming x is small compared to 0.02, leading to the simplified equation x^2 = 5x10^10 * 0.02. Solving this gives x ≈ 3.16x10^-5 M. However, this assumption was checked and found to be invalid by some agents, as the calculated x was not small compared to 0.02.

This is a quadratic equation in terms of x. We can assume x is very small compared to 0.02 M, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. This simplifies our equation to 5x10^10 = x^2/0.02. Solving for x, we get x^2 = 5x10^10 * 0.02, which simplifies to x^2 = 1x10^9. Taking the square root of both sides gives x ≈ 3.16x10^-5 M.

Assuming x is small compared to 0.02, we can approximate the equation as 5x10^10 = x^2/0.02. Solving for x, we get x^2 = 5x10^10 * 0.02 = 1x10^9. Thus, x = sqrt(1x10^9) = 31622.8 M.
