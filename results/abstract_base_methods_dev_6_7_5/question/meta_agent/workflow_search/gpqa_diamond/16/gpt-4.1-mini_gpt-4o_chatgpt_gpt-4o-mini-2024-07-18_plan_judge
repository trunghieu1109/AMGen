Question: Example(question='What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex (we assume that the pH is ideal, T = 25 Â°C). KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10.', choice1='1.0x10^-2 M ', choice2='5.0x10^-3 M', choice3='6.3x10^-7 M', choice4='2.0x10^-2 M ', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_1_16
proposed answer: The calculated concentration of free Ca2+ ions is 6.3x10^-7 M. Comparing this value with the multiple-choice options: choice1 is 1.0x10^-2 M, choice2 is 5.0x10^-3 M, choice3 is 6.3x10^-7 M, and choice4 is 2.0x10^-2 M. The calculated value exactly matches choice3, which is 6.3x10^-7 M. Therefore, the correct answer choice that corresponds to the calculated concentration is choice C.
