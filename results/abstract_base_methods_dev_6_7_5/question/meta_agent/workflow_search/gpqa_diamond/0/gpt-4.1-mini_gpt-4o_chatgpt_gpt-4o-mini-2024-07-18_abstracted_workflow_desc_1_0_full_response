This principle is a form of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which states that the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) are related by ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. This means that the shorter the lifetime of a state, the greater the uncertainty in its energy. Conversely, a longer lifetime corresponds to a smaller energy uncertainty.
