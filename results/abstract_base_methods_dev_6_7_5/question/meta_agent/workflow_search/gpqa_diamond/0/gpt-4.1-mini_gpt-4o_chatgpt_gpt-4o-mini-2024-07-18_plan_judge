Question: Example(question='Two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10^-9 sec and 10^-8 sec, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which one of the following options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?\n', choice1='10^-9 eV', choice2='10^-11 eV', choice3='10^-8 eV\n', choice4='10^-4 eV', correct_index=4)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_1_0
proposed answer: To clearly resolve two energy levels, the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty in their energies. From the sub-task analysis, the minimum energy difference required for resolution was determined to be greater than 3.29 × 10^-7 eV. The given options are 10^-9 eV, 10^-11 eV, 10^-8 eV, and 10^-4 eV. Among these, only 10^-4 eV is greater than 3.29 × 10^-7 eV, making it the only option that satisfies the condition for clear resolution of the energy levels.
