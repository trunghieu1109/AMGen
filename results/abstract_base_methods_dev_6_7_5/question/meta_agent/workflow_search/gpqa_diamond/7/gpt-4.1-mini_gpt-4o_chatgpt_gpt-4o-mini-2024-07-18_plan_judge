Question: Example(question="You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control’s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control’s resistance; 0% ‒ all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?\n", choice1='G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3', choice2='G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1', choice3='G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1', choice4='G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: Based on the analysis of the experimental data, G2 is identified as the transcription factor because its knockout results in a complete loss of resistance in the g2, g1g2, and g2g3 mutants, indicating its crucial role in regulating the resistance pathway. G1 and G3 show redundancy because the g1g3 double mutant retains some resistance (10%), suggesting that both genes contribute to resistance but neither is solely responsible. The higher resistance in the g1 mutant compared to the g3 mutant suggests that G1 is epistatic towards G3, meaning G1 has a more dominant effect on resistance when both are present. Therefore, the comprehensive conclusion is that G2 is the transcription factor, G1 and G3 show redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Answer:G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.
Extracted answer: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.
Correct answer: 1

proposed answer: Based on the analysis of the experimental data and the conclusions from the subtasks, we can draw a comprehensive conclusion about the gene interactions and transcription factor identity. The knockout of G2 results in a complete loss of resistance (0%), indicating that G2 is a critical regulatory gene, likely acting as a transcription factor. This is supported by the fact that double mutants involving G2 (g1g2 and g2g3) also show 0% resistance, suggesting that G2 is upstream and essential for the function of G1 and G3. The partial resistance observed in the g1 and g3 single mutants (75% and 50% respectively) and the significant drop in resistance in the g1g3 double mutant (10%) indicate that G1 and G3 have overlapping functions, showing partial redundancy. However, neither can fully compensate for the loss of the other, which is why the double mutant has much lower resistance. Therefore, G2 is identified as a transcription factor that regulates G1 and G3, and G1 and G3 exhibit partial redundancy in their contribution to resistance. G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, as its absence alone results in a complete loss of resistance, masking the effects of the other genes.

Answer:G2 is a transcription factor acting upstream of G1 and G3, which show partial redundancy in contributing to resistance.
