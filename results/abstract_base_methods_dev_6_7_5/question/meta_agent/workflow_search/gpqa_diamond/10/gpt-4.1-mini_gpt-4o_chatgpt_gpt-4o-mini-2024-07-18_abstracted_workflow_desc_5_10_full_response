For programmed ribosomal frameshifting, research shows that both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 utilize -1 ribosomal frameshifting facilitated by slippery sequences and pseudoknots, which are critical for viral replication. Studies have confirmed that the frameshifting mechanism is conserved between these viruses. Regarding the nsp10/nsp14-ExoN complex, literature indicates that nsp14 has proofreading exonuclease activity, enhanced by nsp10, which is crucial for maintaining the fidelity of the viral RNA genome. This mechanism is well-documented and is a distinguishing feature of coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. For ORF3a-induced apoptosis, evidence suggests that ORF3a can indeed activate caspase-8, leading to apoptosis via the extrinsic pathway, as shown in experimental studies on SARS-CoV-2. This aligns with findings in related coronaviruses. Finally, the correlation between frameshifting rates and pseudoknot conformations is supported by structural studies showing that the pseudoknot can adopt multiple conformations under tension, affecting the efficiency of frameshifting. This has been observed in both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, as well as other viruses that use similar mechanisms.; answer: Scientific research confirms that SARS-CoV-2 uses programmed ribosomal frameshifting similar to SARS-CoV, facilitated by slippery sequences and pseudoknots. The nsp10/nsp14-ExoN complex has exonuclease activity important for RNA proofreading, with nsp10 enhancing nsp14's function.
