Question: Example(question='Imagine an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ having a small spherical cavity inside. The centre of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the centre of the spherical conductor. The radius of the cavity is $r$, and $r<R$. Now consider a small amount of positive charge $+q$ is somehow placed somewhere inside the cavity. What is the magnitude of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at a point P (outside the spherical conductor) of distance $L$ from the centre of the spherical conductor? Note, the distance of the point P from the centre of the cavity is $l$. Here, l, L > R. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\\theta$\n', choice1='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n', choice2='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n', choice3='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\n', choice4='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: In this problem, we have a spherical conductor with a cavity that contains a small positive charge +q. The conductor is uncharged overall, which means that while +q induces a negative charge on the inner surface of the conductor, the outer surface remains neutral. The key parameters are the radius of the conductor R, the radius of the cavity r, the distance s from the cavity center to the conductor center, the distance L from the conductor center to point P, and the distance l from the cavity center to point P. The angle theta describes the orientation of the vectors involved. According to Gauss's law, the electric field outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution behaves as if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the sphere. Therefore, when analyzing the electric field at point P, we can treat the effect of the charge +q as if it were located at the center of the conductor. This leads us to conclude that the electric field at point P can be expressed as E = (1/(4πε₀))(q/L²), where L is the distance from the center of the conductor to point P. This reasoning aligns with choice 4, which is the correct expression for the electric field in this configuration. The other choices either incorrectly account for the geometry or the influence of the charge distribution. Thus, the correct answer is D.
