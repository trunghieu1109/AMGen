Question: Example(question='The reaction of an electron pair donor, nucleophile (Nu) with an electron pair acceptor is called nucleophilic substitution reaction. An sp3-hybridized electrophile needs to have a leaving group to proceed with the reaction. Substitution reactions have the following two types. One is SN1 and the other is the SN2 reaction. In contrast to the substitution reaction, the elimination reaction involves the removal of a pair or groups of atoms from a molecule. These are chemical reactions in which single carbon-carbon bonded organic compounds are converted to compounds containing double/triple bonds (unsaturated compounds).\nArrange the following nucleophiles more reactive to the poorest reactive in the aqueous solution.\n\n1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate\n2. Hydroxide\n3. Propionate\n4. Methanol\n5. Ethanethiolate', choice1='5, 2, 1, 3 and 4', choice2='2, 5, 1, 4 and 3', choice3='5, 2, 3, 1 and 4', choice4='2, 5, 3, 4 and 3', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Test New Architecture_189
proposed answer: To validate the order of nucleophiles from most reactive to least reactive in aqueous solution, we analyze their intrinsic properties and how they interact with water. The nucleophiles in question are: 1) 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate, 2) hydroxide, 3) propionate, 4) methanol, and 5) ethanethiolate. Based on their properties: 1) Ethanethiolate (C2H5S-) is a strong nucleophile due to its negative charge on sulfur, which is less electronegative than oxygen, making it more reactive despite solvation effects. 2) Hydroxide (OH-) is also a very strong nucleophile, possessing a negative charge and a small size, which enhances its reactivity in water, even with solvation. 3) 4-Methylcyclohexan-1-olate has a negative charge on oxygen, making it reactive, but it is more affected by solvation than ethanethiolate and hydroxide, reducing its nucleophilicity. 4) Propionate (C2H5COO-) has a negative charge but is resonance stabilized, which decreases its nucleophilicity compared to the others. 5) Methanol (CH3OH) is neutral and does not have a significant ability to donate electrons, making it the least reactive nucleophile. Therefore, the order of nucleophilicity from most reactive to least reactive in aqueous solution is: ethanethiolate (5), hydroxide (2), 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (1), propionate (3), and methanol (4). This evaluation is consistent with both intrinsic properties and the effects of the aqueous solvent on nucleophilicity. The correct sequence matches the option '5, 2, 1, 3 and 4', which corresponds to choice A. Thus, the final answer is A.
