proposed answer: To evaluate the candidate final products based on the IR and NMR data of compound X, we need to analyze the structural implications of the spectral features. The IR spectrum shows a broad peak at 3400–2500 cm-1, indicating the presence of a hydroxyl (-OH) group, which is characteristic of carboxylic acids. The peak at 1720 cm-1 confirms the presence of a carbonyl (C=O) group, typical for carboxylic acids. The peaks at 1610 cm-1 and 1450 cm-1 suggest the presence of an aromatic ring due to C=C stretching and C-H bending vibrations, respectively. The 1H NMR data shows a signal at 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H), indicative of a carboxylic acid proton, aligning with the IR data suggesting the presence of a -COOH group. The signals at 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) suggest a para-substituted aromatic ring due to the splitting pattern. The aliphatic protons at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) indicate a branched alkyl chain, likely from a sec-butyl group. Given the choices provided, '4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid' fits the data best as it contains a carboxylic acid functional group (consistent with the IR and NMR data) and has the appropriate aromatic and aliphatic proton signals. The other options do not align as closely with the spectral data, particularly in terms of the presence of the carboxylic acid group. Therefore, the final product after the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would likely be a derivative of this compound, but the original compound X is best identified as '4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid'.
