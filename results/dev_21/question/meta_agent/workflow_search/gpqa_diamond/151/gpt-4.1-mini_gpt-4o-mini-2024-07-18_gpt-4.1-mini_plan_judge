Question: Example(question='You identified a new quorum-sensing peptide in the bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus. You are highly interested if its role in intercellular communication is conserved among the eukaryotes. You treat yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with the peptide and interestingly observe the formation of the shmoo. You want to learn about the proteome of the active chromatin in the shmoo and recover it by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. The least of proteins from which complex below will you observe in your assay?', choice1='pre-initiation complex', choice2='pre-replication complex', choice3='enhancer protein complex', choice4='nucleosome histone complex', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Test New Architecture_151
proposed answer: To determine which protein complex would be least represented in the chromatin immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry assay targeting active chromatin in the shmoo, we need to analyze the roles of each protein complex in the context of active transcription. The pre-initiation complex (PIC) is essential for the initiation of transcription and would be present in active chromatin. The enhancer protein complex is also involved in enhancing transcription and would likely be found in active chromatin. The nucleosome histone complex, while fundamental to chromatin structure, is a more static component and may not be as dynamically represented in an assay focused on transcriptional activity. The pre-replication complex (PRC), however, is specifically involved in DNA replication, which occurs during the S phase of the cell cycle and is not directly related to transcriptional activity. Since the shmoo formation is associated with active transcription rather than DNA replication, the pre-replication complex would be the least represented in this assay. Therefore, based on the evaluations from various agents, the consensus is that the pre-replication complex is the least likely to be observed in the assay targeting active chromatin in the shmoo.
