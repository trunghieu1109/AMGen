proposed answer: To determine the order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer from the electrophilic substitution reactions of the given compounds, we analyze the electronic effects and directing influences of the substituents on the benzene ring. Each substituent can be classified as either electron-donating or electron-withdrawing, which will influence the regioselectivity during bromination. 

1) C6H5-CH3 (toluene) is an electron-donating group (EDG) that activates the ring and directs substitution to the ortho and para positions, resulting in a high yield of the para isomer. 

2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (ethyl benzoate) is an electron-withdrawing group (EWG) that deactivates the ring but still directs to the ortho and para positions, yielding a moderate amount of the para-isomer, but less than toluene. 

3) C6H5-Cl (chlorobenzene) is a weakly deactivating group that directs to ortho and para positions, producing a lower yield of para isomer compared to toluene and ethyl benzoate, but higher than more strongly deactivating groups. 

4) C6H5-NO2 (nitrobenzene) is a strong EWG that deactivates the ring significantly and directs substitution to the meta position, resulting in the least amount of para isomer. 

5) C6H5-C2H5 (ethylbenzene) behaves similarly to toluene, being an EDG and yielding a significant amount of para-isomer due to its activating nature. 

6) C6H5-COOH (benzoic acid) is a strong EWG that also directs to the meta position, leading to minimal para product. 

Considering these effects, the order of increasing yield of the para-isomer based on the substituents' effects would be: 4 (NO2) < 6 (COOH) < 2 (COOC2H5) < 3 (Cl) < 5 (C2H5) < 1 (CH3). Thus, the correct answer is A.
