Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Final Decision Agent 52x1', content='To derive the relationship between the natural logarithm of the excitation ratio and the effective temperatures T1 and T2, we start with the excitation ratio of 2, indicating that the population of the excited state in star_1 is twice that in star_2. According to the Boltzmann distribution, the ratio of populations of two energy levels can be expressed as P1/P2 = exp(-ΔE/(kT1)) / exp(-ΔE/(kT2)). Given that P1/P2 = 2, we set up the equation: 2 = exp(-ΔE/(kT1)) / exp(-ΔE/(kT2)). Rearranging gives us: 2 = exp(ΔE/(kT2) - ΔE/(kT1)). Taking the natural logarithm of both sides results in ln(2) = ΔE/k * (1/T2 - 1/T1). This can be rearranged to isolate ln(2) in terms of T1 and T2, leading to the equation ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 * T2). This matches choice B from the provided options, confirming that it is the correct relationship derived from the excitation ratio and the energy difference under the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).
