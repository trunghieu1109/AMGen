proposed answer: To synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene, we need to carefully consider the order of reactions and the regioselectivity of each substituent. The first step in all provided sequences is Friedel-Crafts alkylation using tert-butyl chloride and AlCl3, which effectively installs the tert-butyl group at position 1 of the benzene ring. This group is electron-donating, directing further electrophilic substitutions towards the ortho (position 2) and para (position 4) positions. The subsequent step involves nitration using HNO3/H2SO4, introducing a nitro group that is a strong deactivating and meta-directing group, which means it will direct further substitutions to position 3 relative to itself. Therefore, after introducing the nitro group, the next electrophilic substitution must occur at position 3. Finally, the ethoxy group should be installed at position 2, which is ortho to the tert-butyl group and meta to the nitro group. Evaluating the options: Sequence A maintains the correct order and regioselectivity for the introduction of substituents, leading to the desired product. Sequence B includes unnecessary steps that could decrease yield. Sequence C misplaces functional groups, making it ineffective for the desired synthesis. Sequence D disrupts the necessary regioselectivity and is not optimal. Thus, the most logical and efficient sequence that leads to the desired product with high yield is Sequence A.

proposed answer: To synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene, we must carefully consider the order of functional group introductions and the directing effects of each substituent. The tert-butyl group is a strong ortho/para director due to its +I effect, which stabilizes carbocation intermediates during electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS). Therefore, it is crucial to introduce the tert-butyl group first to ensure that subsequent reactions occur at the desired positions on the aromatic ring. After the tert-butyl group is in place, the next step should be the introduction of the ethoxy group, which can be achieved through an alkylation reaction. This step will further enhance the reactivity at the ortho and para positions. The introduction of the nitro group should occur last, as it is a meta director and would direct further substitutions to the meta position if introduced earlier. To mitigate this issue, sulfonation can be used as a blocking strategy to protect the ortho and para positions from further electrophilic attack. By introducing a sulfonic acid group first, we can control the regioselectivity of the nitro group introduction. After the desired substitutions are made, desulfonation can restore the reactivity of the ring. Ignoring these blocking strategies can lead to poor regioselectivity and yield, as the presence of multiple substituents can create steric and electronic conflicts that complicate the reaction outcomes. Therefore, the correct sequence of reactions, including sulfonation/desulfonation and the careful timing of nitration and alkylation, is essential for the successful synthesis of the target compound. After reviewing the sequences, choice 1 provides a logical progression that aligns with these mechanistic insights, whereas the other choices introduce potential conflicts or fail to adequately consider the necessary blocking strategies. Thus, choice 1 is determined to be the most efficient and high-yielding route to the target compound.
