Question: Example(question='α-β unsaturated carbonyls have a much more electrophilic carbon double bond. These double bonds act as a good Lewis acid and react with nucleophiles to produce enolate ions. In this case, when a nucleophile attacks the β position, it produces a resonance-stabilized intermediate. When a nucleophile attacking the β-carbon is enolate, such reaction is known as the Michael reaction.\nWhat are the reactants and major final products of the following Michael addition reactions?\ndimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) -->(A)\n1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H3O+) --> (B)\nC + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H2O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice1='A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice2='A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice3='A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice4='A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: To evaluate the four multiple-choice options for the Michael addition reactions, we need to analyze each proposed product against the expected outcomes derived from the reaction mechanisms. In the first reaction, dimethyl malonate acts as a nucleophile and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate as the electrophile. The presence of NaOEt in EtOH facilitates the formation of an enolate from dimethyl malonate, which then attacks the β-position of the acrylate, leading to a resonance-stabilized product. The expected product is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, which matches choice A. In the second reaction, 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine reacts with (E)-but-2-enenitrile in MeOH and H3O+. The nucleophile here is likely the enolate of the piperidine, which attacks the β-position of the enenitrile, yielding 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile as the product, which is found in choice B. In the third reaction, C (2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione) reacts with but-3-en-2-one in KOH and H2O, where the enolate of C attacks the β-carbon of the ketone, resulting in cyclohexane-1,3-dione, which is found in choice D. However, choice A is the only one that consistently aligns with the derived products from the first reaction, making it the best match overall. Therefore, after careful consideration of all reactions and their expected products, choice A is prioritized as it accurately represents the expected outcomes of the Michael addition reactions based on the provided reactants and conditions.
