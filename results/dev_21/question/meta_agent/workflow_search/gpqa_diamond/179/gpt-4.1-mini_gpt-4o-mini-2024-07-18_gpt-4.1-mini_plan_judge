Question: Example(question='Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are\nconstrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system\ncorrect to three decimals?', choice1='2.822 x 10^-26', choice2='5.645 x 10^-26', choice3='7.056 x 10^-27', choice4='122.330', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Test New Architecture_179
proposed answer: To determine the minimum total energy configuration of the system, we need to analyze the interactions between the fixed charge at point P and the 12 identical charges, as well as the interactions among the 12 charges themselves. Each of the 12 charges, with a charge of 2e, experiences an electrostatic potential energy due to its interaction with the charge fixed at P, which also has a charge of 2e. According to Coulomb's law, the potential energy U between two point charges is given by U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, q1 and q2 are the charges, and r is the distance between them. Since all charges are identical and positioned at a distance of 2 m from point P, we can calculate the contribution to the total energy from these interactions. Next, we also need to consider the mutual interactions among the 12 charges. Because they are identical and symmetrically arranged around point P, we can derive the potential energy from their pairwise interactions, again using Coulomb's law. After calculating both contributions and summing them, we can compare the total energy obtained with the provided choices. The previous evaluations indicated that the total energy aligns with choice A, which is 2.822 x 10^-26 Joules. This choice is consistent with the calculations and the configuration of the system, confirming that it represents the minimum energy state. Therefore, the final answer remains A, as it is the closest match to the calculated total energy of the system.
