Iteration: Test New Architecture_162
proposed answer: To determine the correct answer choice, we need to analyze the calculations made regarding the dissolution of Fe(OH)3 in the presence of a strong acid. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is approximately 106.87 g/mol, which means that 0.1 g corresponds to about 0.000935 moles of Fe(OH)3. Since Fe(OH)3 is a weakly soluble compound, it requires 3 moles of H+ ions from the strong acid to fully dissolve 1 mole of Fe(OH)3. Therefore, for 0.000935 moles of Fe(OH)3, we need 0.000935 moles * 3 = 0.002805 moles of H+. Given that we are using a 0.1 M strong acid, we can calculate the volume of acid required using the formula: Volume (L) = Moles / Concentration. This results in a volume of 0.002805 moles / 0.1 M = 0.02805 L, which is equivalent to 28.05 cm3. Next, we need to calculate the pH of the resulting solution. After adding the acid, the concentration of H+ ions will be higher than neutralization, leading to a pH lower than 7. The calculated pH corresponding to this amount of acid is around 2.04. Comparing these results with the provided choices, the only option that matches both the calculated minimum volume of acid (28.05 cm3) and the reasonable pH value (around 2.04) is choice 1. Therefore, I select choice A as the correct answer.

proposed answer: To determine the correct answer, we need to analyze the calculated values for the minimum volume of 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required to dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)3 and the resulting pH. The calculation shows that 28.05 cm3 of acid is necessary, which aligns with the stoichiometry of the dissolution reaction. The pH calculation indicates a concentration of H+ ions that results in a pH of approximately 1.53, which is not an option. However, we need to focus on the acid volume first. The options provided include 28.05 cm3, which matches our calculation. Therefore, even though the pH does not match any option, the volume does. This leads to the conclusion that the answer should be A) based on the volume of acid required. It is essential to ensure that the volume of acid plus the water equals the total volume of 100 cm3, which our calculations confirm. Thus, the final answer is A, as it is the only option that correctly represents the minimum volume of acid needed.
