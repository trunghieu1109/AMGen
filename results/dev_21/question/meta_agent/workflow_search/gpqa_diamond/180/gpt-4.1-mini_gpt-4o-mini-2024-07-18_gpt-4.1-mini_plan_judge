Question: Example(question='Very large number of neutrinos produced by the Sun reach the Earth (very large flux of neutrinos, defined as the number of neutrinos per cm^2, per second).\n\nLet us assume that, hypothetically, the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the core of the Sun about 8 and a half minutes ago, while all other reactions remained as they were.\n\nWhat would be the approximate ratio of the flux between two bands of neutrino energies of 700-800 KeV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). \n\nFlux (band 1) / flux (band 2) is:\n\n(Note: we are talking about stopping the pp-III branch, not pp-II, pp-I or any other. Itâ€™s not a typo or something like that.)\n(Note 2: solar neutrino flavor changes happen, but do not play a role here.)', choice1='0.1 (10^-1).', choice2='10.', choice3='1.', choice4='0.01 (10^-2).', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: To evaluate the flux ratio between the two energy bands (700-800 keV and 800-900 keV) after the pp-III branch stops, we need to analyze the contributions of the different solar fusion processes. The pp-III branch is primarily responsible for producing neutrinos in the higher energy range (800-900 keV). If this branch stops, the flux in the 800-900 keV band will decrease significantly, as it relies heavily on the pp-III branch for its neutrino production. In contrast, the lower energy band (700-800 keV) continues to receive contributions from the pp-I and pp-II branches, which are unaffected by the stopping of the pp-III branch. Therefore, the flux in the 700-800 keV band remains relatively stable compared to the drastic reduction in the 800-900 keV band. This leads to the conclusion that the flux ratio of band 1 (700-800 keV) to band 2 (800-900 keV) will be less than 1. Based on previous analyses and the consensus among various agents, the most reasonable estimate for this ratio is approximately 0.1 (10^-1). This indicates that for every neutrino detected in the 800-900 keV band, there are about 0.1 neutrinos in the 700-800 keV band, reflecting the significant role of the pp-III branch in the higher energy range and the lesser contribution of the other branches in that range.
