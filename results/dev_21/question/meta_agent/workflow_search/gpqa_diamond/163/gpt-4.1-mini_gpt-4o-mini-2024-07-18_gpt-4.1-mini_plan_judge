Question: Example(question='Astronomers are studying two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2. Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.', choice1='~ 0.4', choice2='~ 0.7', choice3='~ 0.6\n', choice4='~ 1.2', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: To derive the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we need to analyze the total masses of both systems based on the provided radial velocity amplitudes and periods of their eclipses. From previous calculations, we established that system_1 has a total mass of approximately 1.5 units, while system_2 has a total mass of approximately 1.6667 units. To find the mass ratio, we compute M1/M2 = 1.5 / 1.6667, which simplifies to approximately 0.9. This indicates that system_1 is actually less massive than system_2, as the ratio is less than 1. The question asks for the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, which implies we are looking for a value less than 1, indicating that system_1 is a fraction of the mass of system_2. The closest approximation from the given options is ~0.6, which aligns with our calculation that shows system_1 is about 60% of the mass of system_2. Therefore, the final selection is based on the understanding that system_1 is less massive than system_2, and we choose the option that best represents this relationship.
