Question: Example(question='The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1), and the operators of two observables P and Q of the system are represented by two square matrices. The matrix corresponding to operator P has the elements in first row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0), elements in the second row as (1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}) and that in third row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0). The matrix operator for Q is represented by the square matrix having elements in the first row as (1, 0, 0), second row as (0, 0, 0) and third row as (0, 0, -1). Now, if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P, what is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements?', choice1='1/2', choice2='1/6', choice3='1/3', choice4='2/3', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: To calculate the probability of measuring Q = -1 on the post-measurement state obtained after measuring P = 0, we first need to recall the post-measurement state from Sub-task 3, which we denote as |ψ'>. This state is obtained by projecting the initial state onto the eigenspace of operator P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0. Next, we need to project this state |ψ'> onto the eigenspace of operator Q corresponding to the eigenvalue -1. The eigenspace of Q for eigenvalue -1 is spanned by the vector (0, 0, 1). The projection operator onto this eigenspace is given by P_Q = | 0 0 0 | | 0 0 0 | | 0 0 1 |. The probability of measuring Q = -1 is given by the square of the norm of the projection of |ψ'> onto the eigenspace of Q. This can be calculated using the formula: P(Q = -1) = ||proj_Q(ψ')||^2. Since the eigenspace vector is normalized, we can simplify the calculation to P(Q = -1) = |(ψ' · v_q)|^2, where v_q is the vector (0, 0, 1). After performing the necessary calculations, we find that the probability is 1/6 based on the inner product results and the normalization of the projected state. Therefore, the most consistent and accurate answer for the probability of measuring Q = -1 is 1/6.
