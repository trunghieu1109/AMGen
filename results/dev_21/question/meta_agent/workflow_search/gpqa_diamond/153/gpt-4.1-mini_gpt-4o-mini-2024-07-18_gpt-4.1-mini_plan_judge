Iteration: Test New Architecture_153
proposed answer: To determine the most reasonable structural suggestion for the unidentified drug, we must carefully analyze the spectral data provided and compare it with the candidate compounds. The mass spectrometry indicates a molecular weight of 156 g/mol, with a significant peak at m/z = 158, suggesting the presence of chlorine. The IR spectrum shows a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1, indicative of an O-H stretch, and a sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1, which corresponds to a C=O stretch typical of carboxylic acids. The 1H NMR spectrum reveals an acidic proton at 11.0 ppm, consistent with a carboxylic acid, and additional peaks at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm indicating aromatic protons. The splitting patterns suggest a disubstituted aromatic ring, likely with chlorine substituents. Among the candidate compounds, 4-chlorobenzoic acid has a structure that fits these spectral characteristics perfectly: it contains a carboxylic acid functional group, matches the molecular weight, and has a chlorine substituent that aligns with the observed m/z values. The other options either do not have the correct functional groups or do not match the spectral data as closely as 4-chlorobenzoic acid does. Therefore, after careful consideration of all the spectral data and the candidate structures, I conclude that the most reasonable structural suggestion for the unidentified drug is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.
