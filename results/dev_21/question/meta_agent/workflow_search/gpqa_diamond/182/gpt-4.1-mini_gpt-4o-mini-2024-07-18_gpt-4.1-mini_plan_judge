Question: Example(question='What is the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product obtained when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess of HI?', choice1='1', choice2='3', choice3='0', choice4='5', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Test New Architecture_182
proposed answer: To determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product formed from the reaction of 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid with red phosphorus and excess HI, we analyze the structural changes that occur during the reaction. Initially, the compound has an IHD of 3, which is derived from the presence of a cyclohexene ring (contributing 1) and a vinyl group (contributing another 1). The formyl group (-CHO) does not contribute to IHD directly, but it is reduced to a methylene group (-CH2-), which decreases the overall unsaturation. The vinyl group (-C=C-) is also reduced to a single bond (-CH-CH2-), further contributing to the saturation of the molecule. The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is converted to an alkyl halide through substitution with HI, which does not contribute to unsaturation. After these transformations, the only remaining unsaturation comes from the cyclohexene ring, which retains one double bond. Therefore, the final IHD is calculated to be 1, as one double bond remains after the reaction. This conclusion is consistent across multiple analyses, confirming that the IHD of the product is indeed 1 based on the structural changes and the transformations identified in the previous sub-tasks.
