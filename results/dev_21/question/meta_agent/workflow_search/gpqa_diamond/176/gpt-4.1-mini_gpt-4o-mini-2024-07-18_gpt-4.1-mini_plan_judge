proposed answer: To evaluate the luminosity ratio L1/L2 for the two stars, we apply the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the luminosity L of a black body is given by L = 4πR^2σT^4. Since both stars have the same peak wavelength, we can infer that their temperatures are equal (T1 = T2). This allows us to ignore the temperature factor when comparing their luminosities. Given that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 (R1 = 1.5R2), we can express the luminosity ratio as L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2. Substituting the radius ratio gives us L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. The radial velocities of the stars do not impact this calculation, as they pertain to the observed light rather than the intrinsic properties of the stars. Therefore, the computed luminosity ratio of approximately 2.25 aligns with our calculations and the understanding of black body radiation. Among the provided answer choices (~2.23, ~2.25, ~2.32, ~2.35), the closest match to our computed value is ~2.25, making it the correct answer.

proposed answer: To evaluate the luminosity ratio of Star_1 to Star_2, we start with the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that luminosity L is proportional to the surface area and the fourth power of the temperature. Given that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, we can express the luminosity ratio as L1/L2 = (R1^2 * T1^4) / (R2^2 * T2^4). Substituting R1 = 1.5 * R2 gives us L1/L2 = (1.5^2) * (T1^4 / T2^4) = 2.25 * (T1^4 / T2^4). The critical part is determining the temperature ratio (T1^4 / T2^4). Since the stars have the same brightest wavelength as determined by spectroscopy, we can infer that they have similar temperatures. However, the radial velocities suggest that there might be a Doppler effect influencing their observed temperatures. To accurately assess the luminosity ratio, we need to apply Wien's law, which states that the wavelength of peak emission is inversely proportional to temperature. Given the radial velocity, we can deduce that Star_2 is moving away faster, which could imply it is cooler compared to Star_1. Thus, if we assume a reasonable correction for the temperature difference, we might find that T1 is slightly greater than T2. The derived temperature ratio, when factored in, will adjust the luminosity ratio from the base of 2.25. After evaluating the choices provided (~2.23, ~2.25, ~2.32, ~2.35), the most consistent with our calculations and adjustments for temperature differences is approximately 2.32, making it the closest match. Therefore, I conclude that the answer is C).
