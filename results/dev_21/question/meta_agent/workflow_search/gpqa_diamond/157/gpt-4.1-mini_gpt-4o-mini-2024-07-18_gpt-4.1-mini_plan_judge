Question: Example(question='In an inactive state, a transcription factor subunit awaits an activation signal from the membrane phosphorylation cascade. Upon phosphorylation on the Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, shuttles into the nucleus, and serves in gene transcription. A missense mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. You observe that a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Which of the following molecular phenotypes is most likely observed in the presence of mutation Y?', choice1='loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype', choice2='protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype', choice3='protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele', choice4='change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Test New Architecture_157
proposed answer: Mutation Y is a dominant-negative mutation located in the dimerization domain of a transcription factor. In molecular biology, dominant-negative mutations produce proteins that interfere with the function of the wild-type protein, even when one normal allele is present. The dimerization domain is crucial for the formation of functional dimers, which are necessary for the transcription factor's activity. When mutation Y is present, it disrupts the ability of the transcription factor to dimerize properly. This means that the wild-type protein cannot effectively dimerize with the mutated protein, leading to a loss of protein dimerization. As a result, the transcription factor cannot enter the nucleus and activate gene transcription effectively, resulting in a loss-of-function phenotype. Other options such as protein aggregation, degradation, or conformational changes do not align with the specific effects of a dominant-negative mutation in the context of dimerization. Therefore, the most likely molecular phenotype observed with mutation Y is a loss of protein dimerization and a consequent loss-of-function phenotype.
