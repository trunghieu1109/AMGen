Question: Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.

proposed answer: We start with the given dimensions x = y = 2 and z = 5.75, which satisfy the constraints: volume xyz = 2 * 2 * 5.75 = 23 and surface area 2(xy + yz + zx) = 2(4 + 11.5 + 11.5) = 2(27) = 54. The space diagonal squared is d^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 4 + 4 + 33.0625 = 41.0625. To express 41.0625 as a fraction, note that 0.0625 = 1/16, so 41.0625 = 41 + 1/16 = 656/16 + 1/16 = 657/16. The radius squared is r^2 = d^2 / 4 = (657/16) / 4 = 657/64. We check if 657 and 64 share common factors: 657 factors into 3^2 * 73, and 64 is 2^6, so no common factors exist. Therefore, the fraction 657/64 is in lowest terms. Finally, p + q = 657 + 64 = 721. All arithmetic steps are verified and consistent, confirming the correctness of the fraction and sum. Hence, the final answer is 721.
