Question: Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.
[asy] size(10cm); usepackage("tikz");label("\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(2,0)--(2,3)--(5,3)--(5,8)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}",origin); label("\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(0,3)--(3,3)--(3,5)--(8,5)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}",E); [/asy]

proposed answer: From Sub-task 2, we found that the number of sequences of segment lengths corresponding to paths with exactly four direction changes is 294. Each sequence corresponds to a unique path because the path is completely determined by the lengths of the monotone segments and their order. Since the path is composed of exactly five segments alternating between horizontal and vertical moves, and the total horizontal and vertical steps are fixed at 8 each, once the segment lengths are fixed, the path is fixed. There is no additional combinatorial factor to consider for each sequence because the path is uniquely determined by the segment lengths. Therefore, the total number of lattice paths with exactly four direction changes is exactly the number of such sequences, which is 294. This matches the combinatorial reasoning and can be verified by considering smaller cases or by the logic that each composition corresponds to a unique path. Hence, the answer is 294.
