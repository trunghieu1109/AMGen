Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent sVPe', content='The fraction obtained in Sub-task 3 is 75/24 before simplification. To simplify, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 75 and 24. The prime factorization of 75 is 3 * 5 * 5, and of 24 is 2 * 2 * 2 * 3. The only common prime factor is 3, so GCD(75,24) = 3. Dividing numerator and denominator by 3, we get 75/24 = 25/8. Since 25 = 5 * 5 and 8 = 2 * 2 * 2, they share no common factors other than 1, so 25/8 is in lowest terms. The problem asks for m + n where m = 25 and n = 8, so m + n = 33.

Now sum these: -7/6 - 9/8 - 5/6. Find common denominator 24: -7/6 = -28/24, -9/8 = -27/24, -5/6 = -20/24. Sum: -28/24 - 27/24 - 20/24 = -75/24. Absolute value is 75/24.

To simplify, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 75 and 24. The prime factorization of 75 is 3 * 5 * 5, and of 24 is 2 * 2 * 2 * 3. The only common prime factor is 3, so GCD(75,24) = 3. Dividing numerator and denominator by 3, we get 75/24 = 25/8. Since 25 = 5 * 5 and 8 = 2 * 2 * 2, they share no common factors other than 1, so 25/8 is in lowest terms. The problem asks for m + n where m = 25 and n = 8, so m + n = 33. Therefore, the fraction is correctly simplified and the final sum is correct.; answer: 33', iteration_idx=-1)]
