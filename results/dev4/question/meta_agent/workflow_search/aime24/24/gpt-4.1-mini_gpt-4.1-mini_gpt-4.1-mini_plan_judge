Question: Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations:
\[\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}\]\[\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}\]\[\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}\]
Then the value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: The fraction obtained in Sub-task 3 is 75/24 before simplification. To simplify, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 75 and 24. The prime factorization of 75 is 3 * 5 * 5, and of 24 is 2 * 2 * 2 * 3. The only common prime factor is 3, so GCD(75,24) = 3. Dividing numerator and denominator by 3, we get 75/24 = 25/8. Since 25 = 5 * 5 and 8 = 2 * 2 * 2, they share no common factors other than 1, so 25/8 is in lowest terms. The problem asks for m + n where m = 25 and n = 8, so m + n = 33. Therefore, the fraction is correctly simplified and the final sum is correct.
