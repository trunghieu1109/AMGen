Question: Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.

proposed answer: From the previous sub-task, the inradius r of the tetrahedron was found to be (41√21)/168. Here, m=41, n=21, and p=168. We verify that m and p are coprime: 41 is prime and does not divide 168, so gcd(41,168)=1. Also, n=21 is square-free since 21=3*7 and neither 3 nor 7 is squared. Therefore, the expression is in the required form. The problem asks for the sum m + n + p = 41 + 21 + 168 = 230. This is the final answer.

proposed answer: The problem asks for the sum m + n + p where the inradius r of the tetrahedron is expressed as (m√n)/p with m and p coprime and n square-free. From the previous sub-task, the inradius was found to be r = (1 * √9562) / 28. Here, m = 1, n = 9562, and p = 28. We verify that m and p are coprime (gcd(1, 28) = 1) and that n = 9562 is square-free (no prime squared divides 9562). The sum is therefore 1 + 9562 + 28 = 9591. This matches the conditions and the problem's requirements, confirming the correctness and consistency of the solution.
