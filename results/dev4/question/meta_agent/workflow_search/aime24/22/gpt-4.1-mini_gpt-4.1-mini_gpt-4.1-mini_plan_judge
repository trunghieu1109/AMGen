Question: A list of positive integers has the following properties:
$\bullet$ The sum of the items in the list is $30$.
$\bullet$ The unique mode of the list is $9$.
$\bullet$ The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.
Find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_0_22
proposed answer: From Sub-task 2, the only valid candidate list that satisfies all the constraints is [5, 7, 9, 9]. This list sums to 30, has 9 as the unique mode (appearing twice, more than any other number), and the median is (7 + 9)/2 = 8, which is a positive integer not in the list. Now, to answer Sub-task 3, we compute the sum of the squares of the items in this list: 5^2 + 7^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 = 25 + 49 + 81 + 81 = 236. This sum corresponds to the list that satisfies all constraints, confirming the correctness of the solution.
