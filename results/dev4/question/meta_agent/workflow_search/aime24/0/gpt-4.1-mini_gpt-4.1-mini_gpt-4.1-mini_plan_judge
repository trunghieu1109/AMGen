Question: Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.

proposed answer: The total time computed in Sub-task 3 is 204 minutes when walking at speed s + 0.5 km/h (3.0 km/h). To verify this, we check consistency with the original problem constraints and previous results. The original times were 4 hours (240 minutes) at speed s = 2.5 km/h and 2 hours 24 minutes (144 minutes) at speed s + 2 = 4.5 km/h, both including the coffee time t = 24 minutes. The walking times alone were 216 minutes (9/2.5 = 3.6 hours = 216 minutes) and 120 minutes (9/4.5 = 2 hours = 120 minutes), respectively, with coffee time added to reach total times. For speed 3.0 km/h, walking time is 9/3 = 3 hours = 180 minutes. Adding coffee time 24 minutes gives 204 minutes total, which logically fits between 240 minutes (slower speed) and 144 minutes (faster speed). This is consistent and reasonable, confirming the correctness of the computed total time. No inconsistencies are found, so the answer is verified.
