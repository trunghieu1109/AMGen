Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: From the previous sub-task, we found that the difference r_i - r_o simplifies to the fraction 19/6. We must verify that 19 and 6 are relatively prime, which they are since 19 is a prime number and does not divide 6. Therefore, the fraction 19/6 is in lowest terms. The problem asks for m + n where the fraction is m/n, so m = 19 and n = 6. Adding these gives 19 + 6 = 25. This is consistent with the problem conditions and the geometric analysis provided, confirming the correctness of the solution.

proposed answer: From the previous subtasks, the difference r_i - r_o was found to be 24/35 in lowest terms, where m = 24 and n = 35. Both 24 and 35 are relatively prime, so the fraction is already reduced. The problem asks for the sum m + n, which is 24 + 35 = 59. This arithmetic is straightforward and correct. The fraction 24/35 aligns with the geometric interpretation of the problem, where the difference in the radii of the tangent circles on the torus corresponds to a rational number derived from the torus and sphere radii. The final answer 59 is consistent with the problem's requirements and the geometric model, confirming the solution's validity.
