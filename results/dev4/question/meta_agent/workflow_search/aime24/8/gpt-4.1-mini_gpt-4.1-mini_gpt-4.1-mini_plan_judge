Question: Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.

proposed answer: The problem is to find the number of positive integers n ≤ 2024 for which Bob, the second player, has a winning strategy. This means the initial position is losing for Alice, the first player. From the analysis in Sub-task 4, the losing positions for the player about to move are those where n mod 5 equals 0 or 2. This is because from these positions, any move (removing 1 or 4 tokens) leads to a winning position for the opponent. The losing positions form two arithmetic progressions: 5k (k ≥ 1) and 5k + 2 (k ≥ 0). Counting these up to 2024: For 5k ≤ 2024, k max = floor(2024/5) = 404, so 404 terms. For 5k + 2 ≤ 2024, k max = floor((2024 - 2)/5) = 404, so 405 terms (k=0 to 404). Total losing positions = 404 + 405 = 809. To verify, consider the pattern of winning and losing positions for small n: n=1 (win), n=2 (lose), n=3 (win), n=4 (win), n=5 (lose), n=6 (win), n=7 (lose), etc., which matches the pattern of losing positions at n mod 5 = 0 or 2. This confirms the correctness of the count. Therefore, the number of positive integers n ≤ 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy is 809.
