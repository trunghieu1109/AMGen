Question: Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.

proposed answer: From the previous analysis, the supremum of BD^2 for all rhombi inscribed on the hyperbola with diagonals intersecting at the origin is found to be 196. This value is derived by considering the constraints imposed by the hyperbola equation, the rhombus properties (equal side lengths and perpendicular bisecting diagonals), and the condition that the diagonals intersect at the origin. The key steps include expressing BD^2 in terms of parameters related to the points on the hyperbola, applying the rhombus conditions to relate these parameters, and then using calculus and algebraic manipulation to find the maximum possible BD^2. The supremum 196 is confirmed to correspond to a valid rhombus configuration on the hyperbola, satisfying all constraints. Checking boundary cases shows that BD^2 cannot exceed 196 without violating the rhombus or hyperbola conditions. Since the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD^2 for all such rhombi, and the supremum is attained at 196, the final answer is 196. This is the maximum squared length of diagonal BD possible for such rhombi, ensuring no larger value satisfies all conditions. Thus, 196 is the greatest real number less than or equal to BD^2 for all such rhombi, verified by the problem's geometric and algebraic constraints.

proposed answer: We have the function f(t) = BD^2 = (44/5) t^2 - 96 defined on the domain t^2 ∈ (20, 720/11) ≈ (20, 65.4545). From previous analysis, f(t) is strictly increasing on this domain, with no critical points inside it. At the lower boundary t^2 = 20, f(t) = 80, and as t^2 approaches the upper boundary 720/11 from below, f(t) approaches 480. However, t^2 = 720/11 is excluded from the domain because it causes division by zero in the expression for s^2, which is necessary for the rhombus construction. Therefore, the supremum of BD^2 is 480, but it is not attained by any actual rhombus on the hyperbola; it is only approached as a limit. 

(a) Checking boundary cases: At t^2 = 20, BD^2 = 80, which is valid but not maximal. Approaching t^2 = 720/11 from below, BD^2 approaches 480, and the rhombus conditions remain valid with positive s^2 and positive y-coordinates, confirming the limit is valid.

(b) Confirming no larger BD^2 satisfies constraints: For t^2 > 720/11, s^2 becomes negative or undefined, violating the rhombus and hyperbola conditions. Hence, no larger BD^2 is possible.

(c) Proof regarding attainment: Since t^2 = 720/11 is excluded, the supremum 480 is not attained but can be approached arbitrarily closely. Thus, the greatest real number less than BD^2 for all such rhombi is any number less than 480 but arbitrarily close to it.

(d) Numeric approximations and alternative checks confirm the symbolic results and the domain restrictions.

Therefore, the final answer is 480, representing the supremum of BD^2 for all rhombi inscribed on the hyperbola with diagonals intersecting at the origin. The supremum is not attained but can be approached arbitrarily closely by valid rhombi.
