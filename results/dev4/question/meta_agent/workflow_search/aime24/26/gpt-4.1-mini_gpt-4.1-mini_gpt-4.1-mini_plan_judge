Question: Alice chooses a set $A$ of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets $B$ of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of $B$ belongs to $A$. Bob's list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_13_26
proposed answer: From Sub-task 3, we found that the total number of sets B is given by the sum over a in A of 2^(a-1) = 2024. Since the powers of two are distinct and correspond uniquely to the binary representation of 2024, the elements of A correspond to the exponents plus one. The binary decomposition of 2024 is 2^{10} + 2^{9} + 2^{8} + 2^{7} + 2^{6} + 2^{5} + 2^{3}, which corresponds to elements a = 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 4 in A. We verify the total number of sets B: sum of 2^{a-1} for a in {4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11} equals 2^3 + 2^5 + 2^6 + 2^7 + 2^8 + 2^9 + 2^{10} = 8 + 32 + 64 + 128 + 256 + 512 + 1024 = 2024, which matches perfectly. Since the sum of distinct powers of two uniquely determines A, this set is unique. Finally, the sum of elements of A is 4 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 = 55.
