Question: Let $\omega\neq 1$ be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\]
is divided by 1000.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_1_19
proposed answer: From Sub-task 3, we found the exact integer product value to be 8321. Now, we need to find the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000. This is straightforward modular arithmetic: 8321 mod 1000 equals the last three digits of 8321, which is 321. Thus, the remainder is 321. This is a direct calculation without any complex modular reduction needed because 8321 is a relatively small integer. Therefore, the remainder when the product is divided by 1000 is 321.
