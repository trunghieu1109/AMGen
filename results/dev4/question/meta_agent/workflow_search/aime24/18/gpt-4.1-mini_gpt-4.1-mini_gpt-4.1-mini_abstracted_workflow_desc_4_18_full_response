To compute p + q, we simply add these two integers: 7 + 16 = 23. To verify correctness, consider the numeric approximation: 7/16 = 0.4375. Previous numeric checks and geometric reasoning confirm that OC^2 lies between 0 and 1 and matches the expected value on segment AB. Since 7 and 16 are relatively prime (gcd(7,16) = 1), the fraction is in lowest terms, satisfying the problem\'s requirement. The sum 23 thus correctly answers the problem. Multiple agent reasoning and verification confirm no contradictions or errors in the derivation and final value. Therefore, the final answer is 23.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent OPlR:\nFrom Sub-task 5, we have OC^2 = 7/16, where 7 and 16 are relatively prime positive integers. To find p + q, we simply add 7 + 16 = 23. To verify correctness, we note that 7/16 = 0.4375. In previous approximations and geometric reasoning, the squared distance OC^2 was found to be exactly this fraction, consistent with the problem\'s conditions and uniqueness of point C on segment AB.
