Question: Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.

proposed answer: Let the four items be: Candy Hearts (C), Diamond Ring (D), Golf Clubs (G), Garden Spade (S). Candy Hearts is owned by all 900 residents, so every resident owns C. The problem states: - Exactly two items owned (including candy hearts): 437 residents. Since everyone owns candy hearts, exactly two items means candy hearts plus exactly one of the other three items. So, these 437 residents own exactly one of {D, G, S}. - Exactly three items owned (including candy hearts): 234 residents. This means candy hearts plus exactly two of {D, G, S}. - We want to find the number of residents owning all four items (C, D, G, S). Let x be the number of residents owning all four items. - The total number of residents is 900. - The number owning exactly one item (only candy hearts) is unknown; call it a. - The number owning exactly two items (C plus exactly one of D, G, S) is 437. - The number owning exactly three items (C plus exactly two of D, G, S) is 234. - The number owning exactly four items (C, D, G, S) is x. Since these categories partition the population, we have: a + 437 + 234 + x = 900 => a + 671 + x = 900 => a = 900 - 671 - x = 229 - x. Next, consider the total owners of each item: - D owners: 195 = number owning exactly D only + number owning D and one other item + number owning D and two other items + number owning all four. The categories for D owners are: - Exactly two items with D: these are residents owning C and exactly one of {D, G, S}, so those owning C and D only (and not G or S). Let d2 be the number of residents owning exactly C and D only. Similarly, g2 and s2 for golf clubs and spade. Since total exactly two items is 437, and these are split among D, G, S, we have: d2 + g2 + s2 = 437. - Exactly three items with D: residents owning C and exactly two of {D, G, S} including D. The exactly three items are 234 total, split among the three pairs: (D,G), (D,S), (G,S). Let d3 be the number of residents owning C, D, and G only; e3 be those owning C, D, and S only; f3 be those owning C, G, and S only. Then d3 + e3 + f3 = 234. - The number owning all four items is x. Now, total D owners = d2 + d3 + e3 + x + (number owning only D and candy hearts) but owning only D and candy hearts is d2 (already counted). So D owners = d2 + d3 + e3 + x. Similarly for G owners: g2 + d3 + f3 + x = 367. For S owners: s2 + e3 + f3 + x = 562. We have the system: d2 + g2 + s2 = 437 (1) d3 + e3 + f3 = 234 (2) d2 + d3 + e3 + x = 195 (3) g2 + d3 + f3 + x = 367 (4) s2 + e3 + f3 + x = 562 (5) Add (3), (4), (5): (d2 + g2 + s2) + 2(d3 + e3 + f3) + 3x = 195 + 367 + 562 = 1124 Substitute (1) and (2): 437 + 2*234 + 3x = 1124 => 437 + 468 + 3x = 1124 => 905 + 3x = 1124 => 3x = 219 => x = 73. So, 73 residents own all four items. Verification: x=73 is positive and less than all individual counts, consistent with problem constraints. Therefore, the number of residents owning all four items is 73.
