Question: Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: First, we verify the total number of 4-element subsets of S = {1, 2, ..., 10} is C(10,4) = 210. Jen's chosen set is fixed, call it J. The grand prize event corresponds to the drawn set being exactly J, so there is exactly 1 such subset. The prize-winning event corresponds to the drawn set having at least 2 elements in common with J. We count the number of 4-element subsets with intersection size k with J for k = 2, 3, 4. 

- For k=4: only 1 subset (J itself).
- For k=3: choose 3 from J (C(4,3)=4) and 1 from outside J (C(6,1)=6), total 4*6=24.
- For k=2: choose 2 from J (C(4,2)=6) and 2 from outside J (C(6,2)=15), total 6*15=90.

Sum of prize-winning subsets = 1 + 24 + 90 = 115.

Therefore, P(grand prize | prize) = 1 / 115. Since 1 and 115 share no common factors other than 1, the fraction is in lowest terms. Thus, m=1, n=115, and m+n=116.

This confirms the previous answer is correct and the fraction is fully simplified. The sum m+n=116 matches the simplified fraction 1/115.
