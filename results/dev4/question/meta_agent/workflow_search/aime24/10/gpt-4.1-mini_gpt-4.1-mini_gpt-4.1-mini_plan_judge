Question: Rectangles $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are drawn such that $D,E,C,F$ are collinear. Also, $A,D,H,G$ all lie on a circle. If $BC=16$,$AB=107$,$FG=17$, and $EF=184$, what is the length of $CE$?

proposed answer: From the detailed analysis and previous sub-tasks, we have two rectangles ABCD and EFGH with given side lengths. Points D, E, C, F are collinear, and points A, D, H, G are concyclic. Using the rectangle properties and the given lengths, we placed points D(0,16), C(107,16), E(x,16), and F(x+184,16) on the line y=16. The rectangle EFGH has sides EF=184 and FG=17, so points H and G are vertically 17 units above E and F, respectively, at (x,33) and (x+184,33). The concyclicity condition of points A(0,0), D(0,16), H(x,33), and G(x+184,33) leads to the equation (y+9)^2 = x^2 + 184x + 64, which simplifies to 625 = x^2 + 184x + 64 when substituting y=16. Solving the quadratic x^2 + 184x - 561 = 0 gives roots x=3 and x=-187. The root x=3 fits the order of points on the line (D=0, E=3, C=107, F=187) and the geometric constraints. Therefore, CE = |107 - 3| = 104. This length satisfies all given conditions and geometric properties, confirming the correctness of the solution.
