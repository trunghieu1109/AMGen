Question: Find the largest possible real part of \[(75+117i)z+\frac{96+144i}{z}\]where $z$ is a complex number with $|z|=4$.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_13_12
proposed answer: From Sub-task 2, we found that the real part of the expression can be written as 540 cos(theta + 0.9273), where theta is the argument of z with |z|=4. The maximum value of this cosine function is 540, achieved when cos(theta + 0.9273) = 1. This corresponds to theta = -0.9273 + 2kπ for any integer k. To verify this maximum, we substitute z = 4e^{iθ} with θ = -0.9273 into the original expression: (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z. The magnitude and phase relationships confirm that the maximum real part is indeed 540. Geometrically, since the expression is linear in z and 1/z with fixed magnitudes, the maximum real part corresponds to aligning the phases to maximize the sum's real component. No larger value can exist because the cosine function is bounded by 1, and the amplitude R = 540 is the maximum achievable magnitude of the real part. Thus, the maximum real part is 540, achievable for some z on the circle |z|=4.
