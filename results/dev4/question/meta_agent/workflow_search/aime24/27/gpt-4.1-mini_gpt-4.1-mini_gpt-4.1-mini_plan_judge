Question: Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_4_27
proposed answer: From the previous analysis and sub-tasks, the number N was found to be 5694. Dividing N by 1000 gives the quotient Q = 5 and the remainder R = 694. Both values satisfy the problem's constraints: Q is a single digit (1 ≤ Q ≤ 9) and R is between 0 and 999. The problem asks for the sum Q + R, so we compute 5 + 694 = 699. This sum is consistent with the decomposition and the problem's requirements. Therefore, the final answer is 699.
