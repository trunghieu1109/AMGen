When treated with pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC), a common oxidizing agent, the secondary alcohol is oxidized to a ketone. PCC specifically oxidizes alcohols to carbonyl compounds without affecting carbon-carbon double bonds. Therefore, the hydroxyl group (OH) in product 1 will be oxidized to a carbonyl group (C=O), resulting in the structure C6H5-CH=CH-CO-CH3 for product 2.

In this process, the carbonyl oxygen is replaced by a methylene group (CH2), converting the ketone into an alkene. This transformation does not involve the formation of epoxides, which typically require peracid reagents and involve the oxidation of alkenes to form a three-membered cyclic ether.
