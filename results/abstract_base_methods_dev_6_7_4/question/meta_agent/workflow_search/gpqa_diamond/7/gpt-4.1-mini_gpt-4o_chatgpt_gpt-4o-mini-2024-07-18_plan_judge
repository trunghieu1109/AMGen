Question: Example(question="You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control’s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control’s resistance; 0% ‒ all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?\n", choice1='G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3', choice2='G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1', choice3='G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1', choice4='G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_57_7
proposed answer: Based on the analysis from the sub-tasks, G2 is identified as a transcription factor because the g2 mutant shows 0% resistance, indicating its critical role upstream in the resistance pathway. G1 and G3 show gene redundancy because their individual knockouts retain some resistance, but the g1g3 double mutant has significantly reduced resistance, suggesting that they may compensate for each other to some extent. G1 is considered epistatic towards G3 because the presence of G1 provides more resistance than G3 alone, and the removal of both results in a dramatic drop in resistance. These interpretations align with Choice 1: 'G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3'. Therefore, the correct choice that aligns with our interpretation is Choice 1.
