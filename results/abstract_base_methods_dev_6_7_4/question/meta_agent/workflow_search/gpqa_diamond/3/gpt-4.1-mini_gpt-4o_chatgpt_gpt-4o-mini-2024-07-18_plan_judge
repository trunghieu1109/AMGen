Question: Example(question='In a parallel universe where a magnet can have an isolated North or South pole, Maxwell’s equations look different. But, specifically, which of those equations are different?', choice1='The one related to the divergence of the magnetic field. ', choice2='The ones related to the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field.', choice3='The ones related to the circulation of the electric field and the divergence of the magnetic field.  ', choice4='The one related to the circulation of the magnetic field and the flux of the electric field. ', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: In the presence of magnetic monopoles, two of Maxwell's equations are modified: Gauss's law for magnetism changes to account for magnetic monopole charge density, affecting the divergence of the magnetic field, and Ampère's law is modified to include a term for magnetic monopole current density, affecting the curl of the magnetic field. Therefore, the correct choice should reflect changes in both the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field. All agents agree that choice 2, which mentions changes related to the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field, correctly reflects these modifications.
