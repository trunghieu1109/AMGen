Gauss's law for magnetism states that the divergence of the magnetic field B is zero, which implies there are no magnetic monopoles in classical electromagnetism. This means that magnetic field lines are continuous loops, without a beginning or end, and do not originate from or terminate at any point.

Specifically, Gauss's law for magnetism, which in classical electromagnetism is ∇·B = 0, would change to ∇·B = ρ_m, where ρ_m is the magnetic monopole charge density. This reflects the fact that magnetic field lines can begin or end on magnetic monopoles, similar to how electric field lines begin or end on electric charges.
