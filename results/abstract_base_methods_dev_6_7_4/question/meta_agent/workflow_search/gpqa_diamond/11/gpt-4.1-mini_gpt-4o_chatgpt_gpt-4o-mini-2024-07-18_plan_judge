Question: Example(question='Find KE of product particles in,\nPi(+) = mu(+) + nu\nhere Pi(+) is stationary.\nRest mass of Pi(+) &  mu(+) is 139.6 MeV & 105.7 MeV respectively.', choice1='2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV', choice2='7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV', choice3='3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV', choice4='4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV', correct_index=4)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_41_11
proposed answer: The problem involves the decay of a stationary Pi(+) into a mu(+) and a neutrino. The rest mass energy of Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and the rest mass energy of mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. The total energy available for the decay products is the difference in rest mass energies, which is 33.9 MeV. Since the Pi(+) is stationary, the momentum of the decay products must be equal and opposite. The neutrino, having negligible mass, will have its energy approximately equal to its momentum. The mu(+) will have both rest mass energy and kinetic energy. By using conservation of energy and momentum, and solving the relativistic energy-momentum equations, we find that the kinetic energy of mu(+) is approximately 4.12 MeV and the kinetic energy of the neutrino is approximately 29.8 MeV. This matches choice D) in the given options. All agents agree on this calculation and choice.
