Question: Example(question='The universe is filled with the Cosmic Microwave Background. Consider the annihilation of high energy \\gamma-rays with a photon from the CMB Radiation into electron-positron, i.e. $\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$. From what energy \\gamma-rays would have their lifetimes in the universe limited by this process? Knowing that the average photon energy of the CMB is $10^{-3}eV$.', choice1='9.5*1e4 GeV', choice2='1.8*1e5 GeV', choice3='2.6*1e5 GeV', choice4='3.9*1e5 GeV', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_1_6
proposed answer: The calculated threshold energy for the high-energy gamma-ray photon is approximately 2.6*10^5 GeV. When comparing this calculated value with the given multiple-choice options (9.5*1e4 GeV, 1.8*1e5 GeV, 2.6*1e5 GeV, 3.9*1e5 GeV), the option that matches exactly is 2.6*1e5 GeV. This is choice 3. All agents agree that this is the correct choice as it directly corresponds to the calculated threshold energy, making it the closest and exact match.
