These lifetimes are related to the energy levels E1 and E2 of the quantum states. The question is about distinguishing these energy levels based on their lifetimes. The energy difference required to resolve these levels is related to the uncertainty principle, which states that the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) are related by ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant.

According to this principle, the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) are related by the inequality ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant (approximately 1.0545718 × 10^-34 Js). This principle implies that the shorter the lifetime of a state (Δt), the larger the uncertainty in its energy (ΔE). Therefore, to distinguish two energy levels E1 and E2 with given lifetimes, the energy difference between these levels should be greater than the uncertainty in energy corresponding to the shorter lifetime. For the given lifetimes of 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, we calculate the minimum resolvable energy difference using the shorter lifetime, 10^-9 seconds. The minimum energy difference required to clearly resolve the states is approximately ΔE ≥ ħ/(2 * 10^-9 s), which is on the order of 10^-7 eV.

The shorter lifetime (10^-9 sec) corresponds to a larger energy uncertainty, setting the minimum energy difference required to resolve the states.
