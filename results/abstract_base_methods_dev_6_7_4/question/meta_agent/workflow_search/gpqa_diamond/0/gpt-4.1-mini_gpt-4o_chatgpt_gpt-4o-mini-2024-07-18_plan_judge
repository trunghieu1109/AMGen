Question: Example(question='Two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10^-9 sec and 10^-8 sec, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which one of the following options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?\n', choice1='10^-9 eV', choice2='10^-11 eV', choice3='10^-8 eV\n', choice4='10^-4 eV', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: Based on the analysis provided in sub-task 5, the energy difference required to distinguish the energy levels must be greater than 3.291 × 10^-7 eV. Among the given choices, 10^-4 eV is the only option that is greater than this threshold, as it is significantly larger than 3.291 × 10^-7 eV. The other options, 10^-9 eV, 10^-11 eV, and 10^-8 eV, are all smaller than the required energy difference and thus cannot resolve the energy levels. Therefore, the correct choice that satisfies the resolution criterion is 10^-4 eV, which corresponds to option D.
