Question: Example(question='Calculate the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator $\\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\\hbar/2$. Given the $X-$component, $P_x$ of the operator $P$ as $\\hbar/2$ times a 2 by 2 square matrix having elements in the first row as $(0 1)$, and that in the second row as $(1, 0)$. The $Y-$component, $P_y$ of the operator is given by the product of $\\hbar/2$ and a 2 by 2 square matrix having elements in the first row as $(0, -i)$, and that in the second row as $(i, 0)$. Finally, the $Z-$component, $P_z$ of the operator is given by the product of $\\hbar/2$  and another 2 by 2 square matrix having elements in the first row as $(1, 0)$, and that in the second row as $(0, -1)$.

proposed answer: The normalized eigenvector obtained from the sub-tasks is (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)). We need to identify the correct form of this eigenvector among the multiple-choice options provided. Let's examine the options: 

Choice 1: (cos(θ), e^{iφ}sin(θ)) - This option includes a complex exponential term and uses θ instead of θ/2, so it does not match the form of the eigenvector.

Choice 2: (√(2/3)ħ, √(1/3)ħ) - This option includes ħ and does not match the form (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)).

Choice 3: (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)) - This option exactly matches the form of the normalized eigenvector obtained.

Choice 4: (√(2/3)ħ cos(θ/2), √(1/3)ħ sin(θ/2)) - This option includes ħ and does not match the form (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)).

Therefore, the correct choice that represents the normalized eigenvector is Choice 3.
