To ensure it is normalized, we need to check that its norm is 1. The norm of a vector [a, b] is given by sqrt(a^2 + b^2). For the vector [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)], the norm is sqrt(cos^2(θ/2) + sin^2(θ/2)). Using the Pythagorean identity, cos^2(θ/2) + sin^2(θ/2) = 1, so the norm is sqrt(1) = 1. Therefore, the vector is already normalized. This confirms that the eigenvector [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)] has unit norm and is correctly normalized.

The solution is consistent with the standard representation of spin-1/2 states in quantum mechanics, where the eigenvector for a spin along an arbitrary direction is given by the angles θ and φ.

To ensure it is normalized, we need to check that its norm is 1. The norm of a vector [a, b] is given by sqrt(a^2 + b^2). For the vector [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)], the norm is sqrt(cos^2(θ/2) + sin^2(θ/2)). Using the Pythagorean identity, cos^2(θ/2) + sin^2(θ/2) = 1, so the norm is sqrt(1) = 1.
