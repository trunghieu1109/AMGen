Question: Example(question='What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex (we assume that the pH is ideal, T = 25 Â°C). KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10.', choice1='1.0x10^-2 M ', choice2='5.0x10^-3 M', choice3='6.3x10^-7 M', choice4='2.0x10^-2 M ', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_2_16
proposed answer: The calculated concentration of free calcium ions is 6.3x10^-7 M, as determined in Sub-task 5. We need to compare this value with the provided multiple-choice options to select the correct answer. The options given are: A) 1.0x10^-2 M, B) 5.0x10^-3 M, C) 6.3x10^-7 M, and D) 2.0x10^-2 M. The calculated value of 6.3x10^-7 M matches exactly with option C. Therefore, the correct answer choice is C.
