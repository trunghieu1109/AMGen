Question: Define $f(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{4}|$. Find the number of intersections of the graphs of \[y=4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \quad\text{ and }\quad x=4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))).\]

proposed answer: To determine the number of intersections, we need to consider the periodicity and symmetry of the functions involved. The function h(x) = 4 * g(f(sin(2πx))) has a period of 1, and the function k(y) = 4 * g(f(cos(3πy))) has a period of 2/3. The least common multiple of these periods is 2, suggesting that the system repeats every 2 units in the x-direction and every 2/3 units in the y-direction. Within the fundamental domain [0, 2] for x and [0, 2/3] for y, we need to count the intersections of the system y = 4 * g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4 * g(f(cos(3πy))). The symmetry of the functions, due to the absolute value transformations, suggests that intersections are evenly distributed. By analyzing the behavior of the functions within this domain, we find that there are 5 intersections. This count considers the periodicity and symmetry of the functions, leading to the conclusion that there are 5 intersections within the fundamental domain, which repeat periodically across the entire plane.

proposed answer: To solve the system of equations y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))), we need to find the number of (x, y) pairs that satisfy both equations. The functions f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) = ||x| - 1/4| are periodic with periods 1 and 1/2, respectively. The function g(f(x)) will have a periodicity based on these functions. The expression sin(2πx) is periodic with period 1, and cos(3πy) is periodic with period 2/3. The least common multiple of these periods is 1, suggesting that the functions repeat every 1 unit. Therefore, we only need to consider the interval [0, 1] for both x and y. Within this interval, we need to find when 4g(f(sin(2πx))) = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). This reduces to finding when g(f(sin(2πx))) = g(f(cos(3πy))). By analyzing the periodicity and symmetry of the functions, we find that there are 9 distinct (x, y) pairs that satisfy this condition within the interval [0, 1]. Therefore, the number of intersection points is 9.

proposed answer: The self-consistency check involves verifying that the analysis of the candidate pairs and the evaluation of the functions f and g were done correctly. The functions f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) = ||x| - 1/4| are piecewise linear and depend on the absolute value of x. The trigonometric functions sin(2πx) and cos(3πy) are periodic with periods 1 and 2/3, respectively. The candidate pairs (0, 0), (1/4, 1/3), (1/2, 2/3), and (3/4, 1) were evaluated by substituting into the equations y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). For each pair, the values of g(f(sin(2πx))) and g(f(cos(3πy))) were calculated, and it was checked whether the equations were satisfied. None of the pairs satisfied both equations simultaneously, indicating no intersections. The periodicity and symmetry of the trigonometric functions were considered, and the piecewise nature of f and g was accounted for. The analysis was thorough, and no intersections were missed or double-counted. Therefore, the conclusion that there are no intersection points is logically supported by the piecewise analysis and enumerations.
