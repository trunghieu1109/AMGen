Question: Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?

proposed answer: From Sub-task 6, we have the probability of the favorable event as a simplified fraction \( \frac{m}{n} = \frac{1}{8} \). Here, \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 8 \). The problem asks for the sum \( m + n \), which is \( 1 + 8 = 9 \). Therefore, the sum \( m + n \) is 9.

proposed answer: In Sub-task 6, we determined that the probability of the octagon being able to be rotated such that all blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is 1/16. This fraction is already in its simplest form, with m = 1 and n = 16. Therefore, the sum m + n is 1 + 16 = 17. The reasoning is consistent with the explanation provided in Sub-task 6, where the total number of colorings is 256 and the number of favorable colorings is 16, leading to the simplified probability of 1/16.

proposed answer: In Sub-task 7, it was determined that the probability fraction 9/256 is already in its simplest form, with m = 9 and n = 256. These numbers are relatively prime, meaning they have no common factors other than 1. Therefore, the sum m + n is 9 + 256. This calculation is straightforward and follows directly from the simplification process described in Sub-task 7.

proposed answer: In Sub-task 7, we determined that the probability of the event is 48/256, which simplifies to 3/16. The integers m and n in the simplified fraction 3/16 are 3 and 16, respectively. These integers are relatively prime, meaning they have no common divisors other than 1. Therefore, the sum m + n is 3 + 16 = 19. This is the final answer for Sub-task 8, as it asks for the sum of m and n from the simplified probability fraction.
