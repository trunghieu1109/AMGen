proposed answer: The least prime p for which there exists a positive integer n such that p^2 divides n^4 + 1 is p = 5, as determined in Sub-task 3. Now, we need to find the least positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 5^2, i.e., m^4 ≡ -1 (mod 25). We start by considering m^4 ≡ -1 (mod 5). Since 5 ≡ 1 (mod 8), -1 is a fourth power residue modulo 5. We find that 2^4 ≡ 1 (mod 5), so 2 is a candidate for m modulo 5. Now, we lift this solution to modulo 25 using Hensel's lemma or trial and error. We check m = 2: 2^4 = 16, and 16 + 1 = 17, which is not divisible by 25. Next, we try m = 7: 7^4 = 2401, and 2401 + 1 = 2402, which is divisible by 25. Therefore, m = 7 is a solution. We verify that 7^4 ≡ -1 (mod 25) by calculating 7^4 = 2401, and 2401 ≡ -1 (mod 25). Thus, the least positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 25 is 7.

Question: Let $p$ be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $n^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$. Find the least positive integer $m$ such that $m^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$.

proposed answer: The task is to determine the least positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2, where p is the least prime found in previous sub-tasks, which is 17. This means we are looking for m such that m^4 ≡ -1 (mod 289). From sub-task 4a, we found that m = 42 satisfies this condition, as 42^4 ≡ -1 (mod 289). This was verified in sub-task 4b, where explicit calculations showed that 42^4 + 1 is indeed divisible by 289. The calculations involved checking 42^4 and confirming that it is congruent to -1 modulo 289. Therefore, based on these verified computations, the least positive integer m is indeed 42. The self-consistency check confirms that no smaller integer m satisfies m^4 ≡ -1 (mod 289), as all calculations and checks are consistent with this result.

Answer:The least positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 289 is m = 42.

proposed answer: The task is to find the least positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 25, given that the least prime p is 5. We need to verify the calculations for small values of m. For m = 1, 1^4 + 1 = 2, which is not divisible by 25. For m = 2, 2^4 + 1 = 17, which is not divisible by 25. For m = 3, 3^4 + 1 = 81 + 1 = 82, which is not divisible by 25. For m = 4, 4^4 + 1 = 256 + 1 = 257, which is not divisible by 25. For m = 5, 5^4 + 1 = 625 + 1 = 626, which is divisible by 25. Therefore, m = 5 is the smallest integer such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 25. The previous analysis by agent gLpX incorrectly stated that 3^4 + 1 = 82 is divisible by 25, which is not true. The correct smallest m is 5.

proposed answer: In Sub-task 4, the initial calculations incorrectly concluded that m = 3 was the least positive integer such that 5^2 divides m^4 + 1. Upon re-evaluation, it was found that 82 is not divisible by 25, as 82 mod 25 = 7. The error was identified and corrected by checking further values of m. For m = 4, m^4 + 1 = 257, which is not divisible by 25. For m = 5, m^4 + 1 = 626, which is divisible by 25 (since 626 mod 25 = 1). Therefore, the correct least positive integer m is 5. The reflexion and cross-validation step ensured the correctness of the modular arithmetic and divisibility checks, correcting the initial error and confirming the correct result.

Answer:The least positive integer m such that 5^2 divides m^4 + 1 is m = 5.
