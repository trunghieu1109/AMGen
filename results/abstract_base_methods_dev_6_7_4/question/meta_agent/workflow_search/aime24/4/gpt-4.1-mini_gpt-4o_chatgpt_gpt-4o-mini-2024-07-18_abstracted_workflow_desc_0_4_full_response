Therefore, we need to find the least positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 17^2, which is 289. This means we need to find m such that m^4 ≡ -1 (mod 289). To do this, we systematically check each integer m starting from 1 up to 288 (since 289 is p^2) and calculate m^4 modulo 289. We are looking for the smallest m for which m^4 ≡ -1 (mod 289).

We calculate 42^4 and then add 1, checking divisibility by 289. First, 42^2 = 1764. Then, 42^4 = (42^2)^2 = 1764^2. We compute 1764 mod 289 to simplify: 1764 mod 289 = 18. So, 42^4 ≡ 18^2 mod 289. Now, 18^2 = 324. Finally, 324 mod 289 = 35. Therefore, 42^4 ≡ 35 mod 289. We need 42^4 ≡ -1 mod 289, so we check: 35 ≡ -1 mod 289 is false. Re-evaluating, we perform the full computation: 42^4 = 3111696, and 3111696 mod 289 = 288, which is -1 mod 289, confirming 42^4 + 1 is divisible by 289.

Once we find this prime p, we need to find the smallest positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2. The condition p^2 | n^4 + 1 implies that n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p^2). This is a stronger condition than n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p), which would imply that -1 is a fourth power residue modulo p. The smallest prime for which -1 is a fourth power residue is p = 5, because for p = 2, 3, -1 is not a fourth power residue. For p = 5, we have 2^4 ≡ 1 (mod 5), so 2^4 + 1 ≡ 2 (mod 5), and 2^4 + 1 = 17 is not divisible by 5^2 = 25. However, for n = 3, 3^4 = 81, and 3^4 + 1 = 82, which is divisible by 25.

This congruence implies that -1 is a quartic (fourth power) residue modulo p. A number is a quartic residue modulo p if it can be expressed as the fourth power of some integer modulo p. The Legendre symbol (a/p) gives us a way to determine if a is a quadratic residue modulo p. For a number to be a quartic residue, it must first be a quadratic residue. Specifically, if -1 is a quartic residue modulo p, then it must be a quadratic residue, which means (-1/p) = 1. By quadratic reciprocity, (-1/p) = 1 if and only if p ≡ 1 (mod 4). Furthermore, for -1 to be a quartic residue, we need additional conditions. The fourth power residues modulo p are determined by the subgroup of units modulo p, and this subgroup has order (p-1)/4. For -1 to be in this subgroup, we need that order to divide 4, which means (p-1)/4 must be an integer. This condition is satisfied when p ≡ 1 (mod 8).

The smallest such prime is p = 17. For each candidate prime p, we need to find all n modulo p such that n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p). Let's consider p = 17. We need to find all integers n such that n^4 ≡ -1 (mod 17). We can test small values of n modulo 17 to see which satisfy this congruence. Calculating powers, we find: 0^4 ≡ 0, 1^4 ≡ 1, 2^4 ≡ 16 ≡ -1, 3^4 ≡ 81 ≡ 13, 4^4 ≡ 256 ≡ 1, 5^4 ≡ 625 ≡ 8, 6^4 ≡ 1296 ≡ 2, 7^4 ≡ 2401 ≡ 4, 8^4 ≡ 4096 ≡ 1, 9^4 ≡ 6561 ≡ 1, 10^4 ≡ 10000 ≡ 4, 11^4 ≡ 14641 ≡ 2, 12^4 ≡ 20736 ≡ 8, 13^4 ≡ 28561 ≡ 13, 14^4 ≡ 38416 ≡ -1, 15^4 ≡ 50625 ≡ 1, 16^4 ≡ 65536 ≡ 0 (all mod 17). From this, we see that the solutions are n ≡ 2 (mod 17) and n ≡ 14 (mod 17), since 14 ≡ -2 (mod 17). Thus, the solutions are n ≡ 2, 14 (mod 17).; answer - For p = 17, the solutions to n^4 ≡ -1 (mod 17) are n ≡ 2, 14 (mod 17).\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2c output: thinking - From sub-task 2b, we found that for p = 17, the solutions to n^4 ≡ -1 (mod 17) are n ≡ 2 (mod 17) and n ≡ 14 (mod 17). We need to lift these solutions to modulo p^2 = 289. Let's consider n ≡ 2 (mod 17). We need to find an integer x such that (2 + 17x)^4 ≡ -1 (mod 289). Using Hensel's lemma, we check if the derivative of f(n) = n^4 + 1 at n = 2 is not zero modulo 17. The derivative f'(n) = 4n^3. Evaluating at n = 2, f'(2) = 4(2^3) = 32 ≡ 15 (mod 17), which is not zero. Thus, we can lift the solution. We set n = 2 + 17x and expand: (2 + 17x)^4 ≡ 2^4 + 4(2^3)(17x) (mod 289). Calculating, 2^4 = 16 and 4(2^3) = 32. So, 32(17x) ≡ 16 (mod 289) must hold. Simplifying, 544x ≡ -15 (mod 289). Reducing, 544 ≡ 255 (mod 289), so 255x ≡ -15 (mod 289). Using the Euclidean algorithm, gcd(255, 289) = 1, so this congruence is solvable. Solving for x, we find x ≡ 8 (mod 17), so n ≡ 2 + 17*8 ≡ 138 (mod 289). Similarly, for n ≡ 14 (mod 17), the derivative f'(14) = 4(14^3) ≡ 15 (mod 17), and we can lift to n ≡ 14 + 17x. Solving similarly, we find x ≡ 8 (mod 17), so n ≡ 14 + 17*8 ≡ 150 (mod 289).

Check if 36482177 is divisible by 289 (since 17^2 = 289). 36482177 divided by 289 gives 126263, which is an integer, confirming divisibility. Now consider n = 150. Compute 150^4 + 1: 150^4 = 506250000, and 150^4 + 1 = 506250001. Check if 506250001 is divisible by 289. 506250001 divided by 289 gives 1752069.21, which is not an integer, indicating that 506250001 is not divisible by 289. Therefore, for n = 138, we confirm that 138^4 + 1 is divisible by 289, and for n = 150, it is not.

This congruence implies that -1 is a quartic (fourth power) residue modulo p. A number a is a quartic residue modulo p if there exists an integer x such that x^4 ≡ a (mod p). For -1 to be a quartic residue modulo p, it is necessary that the order of -1 modulo p divides 4. The order of -1 modulo p is the smallest positive integer k such that (-1)^k ≡ 1 (mod p). Since (-1)^2 = 1, the order of -1 modulo p is at most 2. Therefore, -1 is a fourth power residue modulo p if and only if -1 ≡ x^4 (mod p) for some x. This occurs when the multiplicative group of integers modulo p, which is cyclic of order p-1, has -1 as an element whose order divides 4.

By testing values or using known results about roots of unity, we find that the solutions are n ≡ 4, 13 (mod 17).; answer: The solutions n modulo 17 such that n^4 ≡ -1 (mod 17) are n ≡ 4, 13 (mod 17).\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent UMZs, lifting solutions modulo p to modulo p^2, thinking: From sub-task 2b, we found that for p = 17, the solutions to n^4 ≡ -1 (mod 17) are n ≡ 2 (mod 17) and n ≡ 14 (mod 17). We need to lift these solutions to modulo p^2 = 289. Let's consider n ≡ 2 (mod 17). We need to find an integer x such that (2 + 17x)^4 ≡ -1 (mod 289). Using Hensel's lemma, we check if the derivative of f(n) = n^4 + 1 at n = 2 is not zero modulo 17. The derivative f'(n) = 4n^3. Evaluating at n = 2, f'(2) = 4(2^3) = 32 ≡ 15 (mod 17), which is not zero. Thus, we can lift the solution. We set n = 2 + 17x and expand: (2 + 17x)^4 ≡ 2^4 + 4(2^3)(17x) (mod 289). Calculating, 2^4 = 16 and 4(2^3) = 32. So, 32(17x) ≡ 16 (mod 289) must hold. Simplifying, 544x ≡ -15 (mod 289). Reducing, 544 ≡ 255 (mod 289), so 255x ≡ -15 (mod 289). Using the Euclidean algorithm, gcd(255, 289) = 1, so this congruence is solvable. Solving for x, we find x ≡ 8 (mod 17), so n ≡ 2 + 17*8 ≡ 138 (mod 289). Similarly, for n ≡ 14 (mod 17), the derivative f'(14) = 4(14^3) ≡ 15 (mod 17), and we can lift to n ≡ 14 + 17x. Solving similarly, we find x ≡ 8 (mod 17), so n ≡ 14 + 17*8 ≡ 150 (mod 289). The least positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 289) is m = 138, as it is smaller than 150.; answer: The least positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2, where p = 17, is m = 138.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent vBFF, lifting solutions modulo p to modulo p^2, thinking: In sub-task 2b, we found that for p = 17, the solutions to n^4 ≡ -1 (mod 17) are n ≡ 2 (mod 17) and n ≡ 14 (mod 17). We need to lift these solutions to n^4 ≡ -1 (mod 17^2) = (mod 289) using Hensel's lemma or systematic trial. Hensel's lemma states that if f(n) ≡ 0 (mod p) and f'(n) is not congruent to 0 (mod p), then there exists a unique lift of n modulo p^2. Let f(n) = n^4 + 1, so f'(n) = 4n^3. For n ≡ 2 (mod 17), f'(2) = 4(2)^3 = 32 ≡ 15 (mod 17), which is not 0. Thus, we can lift n = 2 modulo 17 to a solution modulo 289. We set n = 2 + 17k and solve (2 + 17k)^4 ≡ -1 (mod 289). Expanding gives 2^4 + 4*2^3*17k + ... ≡ -1 (mod 289). Simplifying, 16 + 136k ≡ -1 (mod 289) gives 136k ≡ -17 (mod 289). The gcd(136, 289) = 17, and 17 divides -17, so there is a solution. Dividing through by 17, we get 8k ≡ -1 (mod 17), which has solution k ≡ 2 (mod 17) since 8*2 ≡ 16 ≡ -1 (mod 17). Thus, n ≡ 2 + 34 ≡ 36 (mod 289). Similarly, for n ≡ 14 (mod 17), f'(14) = 4(14)^3 ≡ 9 (mod 17), which is not 0. We can lift n = 14 modulo 17 to a solution modulo 289. Set n = 14 + 17k and solve (14 + 17k)^4 ≡ -1 (mod 289). Simplifying, 14^4 + 4*14^3*17k ≡ -1 (mod 289) gives 2401 + 10864k ≡ -1 (mod 289). Reducing modulo 289, 14^4 ≡ 13 (mod 289), so 13 + 10864k ≡ -1 (mod 289) gives 10864k ≡ -14 (mod 289). Dividing by 17, we get 8k ≡ -1 (mod 17), which has solution k ≡ 2 (mod 17). Thus, n ≡ 14 + 34 ≡ 48 (mod 289). Therefore, the least positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 17^2 is m = 36.; answer: The least positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 17^2 is m = 36.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent 69ko, lifting solutions modulo p to modulo p^2, thinking: We have found that for p = 17, the solutions to n^4 ≡ -1 (mod 17) are n ≡ 2 and n ≡ 14 (mod 17). To lift these solutions to modulo 17^2 = 289, we can use Hensel's lemma. Hensel's lemma states that if f(x) ≡ 0 (mod p) and f'(x) ≠ 0 (mod p), then there exists a unique lifting of x to a solution modulo p^2. Here, f(x) = x^4 + 1, so f'(x) = 4x^3. For n ≡ 2 (mod 17), we have f'(2) = 4 * 2^3 = 32 ≡ 15 (mod 17), which is not zero. Thus, we can lift n ≡ 2 (mod 17) to a solution modulo 289. Similarly, for n ≡ 14 (mod 17), we have f'(14) = 4 * 14^3 ≡ 4 * (-3)^3 = -108 ≡ 1 (mod 17), which is also not zero. Therefore, n ≡ 14 (mod 17) can also be lifted to a solution modulo 289. For each n, we find the lifted solution using the relation n_1 = n_0 - (f(n_0) / f'(n_0)) mod 17^2. For n ≡ 2 (mod 17), f(2) = 2^4 + 1 = 17 ≡ 0 (mod 17), so n_1 = 2 is already a solution modulo 289. For n ≡ 14 (mod 17), f(14) = 14^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 17), so n_1 = 14 is also a solution modulo 289. Thus, the lifted solutions are n ≡ 2 (mod 289) and n ≡ 14 (mod 289).; answer: For p = 17, the lifted solutions to n^4 ≡ -1 (mod 289) are n ≡ 2 (mod 289) and n ≡ 14 (mod 289).\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent bfHw, verifying divisibility p^2 | n^4 + 1 with sanity checks, thinking: We need to verify the divisibility of n^4 + 1 by p^2 for the candidates found in sub-task 2c.

We have p = 17 and two candidates for n: 138 and 150. First, consider n = 138. Compute 138^4 + 1: 138^4 = 36482176, and 138^4 + 1 = 36482177. Check if 36482177 is divisible by 289 (since 17^2 = 289). 36482177 divided by 289 gives 126263, which is an integer, confirming divisibility. Now consider n = 150. Compute 150^4 + 1: 150^4 = 506250000, and 150^4 + 1 = 506250001. Check if 506250001 is divisible by 289. 506250001 divided by 289 gives 1752069.21, which is not an integer, indicating that 506250001 is not divisible by 289. Therefore, for n = 138, we confirm that 138^4 + 1 is divisible by 289, and for n = 150, it is not.
