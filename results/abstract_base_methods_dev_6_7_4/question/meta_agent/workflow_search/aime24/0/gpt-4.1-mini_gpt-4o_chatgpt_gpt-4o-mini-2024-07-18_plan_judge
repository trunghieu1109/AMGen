Question: Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.

proposed answer: In the previous sub-task, we determined that when Aya walks at a speed of s + 0.5 km/h, which is 3 km/h, the walking time for 9 km is 3 hours. We also found that the coffee shop time t is 24 minutes. Therefore, the total time in hours is 3 hours for walking plus 0.4 hours (24 minutes) for the coffee shop, which is 3.4 hours. To convert this total time to minutes, we multiply 3.4 hours by 60 minutes/hour, resulting in 204 minutes. Thus, the total time, including the coffee shop stop, is 204 minutes.

proposed answer: In sub-task 6, the total time for Aya's walk plus the coffee shop stop was calculated to be 204 minutes. This time is already in integer form, as it is the sum of 180 minutes (walking time) and 24 minutes (coffee shop time). Therefore, the total time in integer minutes is 204.
