Question: Example(question='There has been an outbreak of an viral infectious disease in your city. You have been asked to design a molecular diagnostic kit for quick detection of this retrovirus. How would you go about designing this kit?', choice1='First you identify the virus by performing DNA sequencing. You then develop a PCR kit for  quick and accurate diagnosis', choice2='First you identify the IgG antibodies for the infection. You then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG antibodies for quick \n and accurate diagnosis.', choice3='First you identify the virus using the information about the symptoms, provided by the affected patients. You then design a nested PCR kit based on the information for quick diagnosis.', choice4='First you identify the virus by performing cDNA sequencing.  You then develop a real time PCR kit for quick and accurate diagnosis.', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: Finalizing kit documentation is a critical step in ensuring that the diagnostic kit is user-friendly and meets all necessary standards. The documentation must include comprehensive Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) that guide users on how to properly use the kit, ensuring that they can achieve accurate results. Additionally, Quality Control (QC) guidelines are essential to maintain the reliability and accuracy of the kit's performance. Troubleshooting tips are also important, as they help users address any common issues that may arise during testing, thereby enhancing user confidence in the kit. Finally, including regulatory compliance information is crucial to ensure that the kit adheres to legal and safety standards, which is vital for its acceptance in the medical community. Therefore, the answer that best reflects the need for thorough and comprehensive documentation is A.
