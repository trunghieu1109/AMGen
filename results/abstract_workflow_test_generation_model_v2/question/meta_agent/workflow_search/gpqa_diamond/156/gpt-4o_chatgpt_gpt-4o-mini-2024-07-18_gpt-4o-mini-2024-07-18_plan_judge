Question: Example(question='There has been an outbreak of an viral infectious disease in your city. You have been asked to design a molecular diagnostic kit for quick detection of this retrovirus. How would you go about designing this kit?', choice1='First you identify the virus by performing DNA sequencing. You then develop a PCR kit for  quick and accurate diagnosis', choice2='First you identify the IgG antibodies for the infection. You then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG antibodies for quick \n and accurate diagnosis.', choice3='First you identify the virus using the information about the symptoms, provided by the affected patients. You then design a nested PCR kit based on the information for quick diagnosis.', choice4='First you identify the virus by performing cDNA sequencing.  You then develop a real time PCR kit for quick and accurate diagnosis.', correct_index=4)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_10_156
proposed answer: The decision to deploy the validated real-time PCR kit is based on its proven effectiveness in rapidly detecting the virus in affected individuals. Real-time PCR is a highly sensitive and specific method that allows for the quick identification of viral RNA, which is crucial during an outbreak. Timely diagnosis is essential for controlling the spread of the infectious disease, as it enables healthcare providers to implement necessary isolation measures and initiate appropriate treatments. Furthermore, the validation of the kit ensures that the results are reliable, which is vital for making informed public health decisions. Overall, deploying this kit aligns with the urgent need for rapid diagnostic capabilities in the context of an outbreak, making it the logical choice for effective outbreak management.
