Question: Example(question='Consider a system with Hamiltonian operator $H = \\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n}$. Here, $\\vec{n}$ is an arbitrary unit vector, $\\varepsilon $ is a constant of dimension energy, and components of $\\vec{\\sigma}$ are the Pauli spin matrices. What are the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator?\n', choice1='+ \\varepsilon, -\\varepsilon\n', choice2='+\\varepsilon \\hbar/2, - \\varepsilon \\hbar/2', choice3='+1, -1', choice4='+\\hbar/2, -\\hbar/2', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: The derived eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator H = ε σ·n are ±ε. This conclusion is consistent across multiple analyses. Among the provided choices, the first option '+ ε, -ε' directly corresponds to these derived eigenvalues. The other options introduce additional factors or different forms that do not match the eigenvalues we computed. Therefore, the correct choice that represents the eigenvalues ±ε is the first option.
