Question: Example(question='Consider a system with Hamiltonian operator $H = \\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n}$. Here, $\\vec{n}$ is an arbitrary unit vector, $\\varepsilon $ is a constant of dimension energy, and components of $\\vec{\\sigma}$ are the Pauli spin matrices. What are the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator?\n', choice1='+ \\varepsilon, -\\varepsilon\n', choice2='+\\varepsilon \\hbar/2, - \\varepsilon \\hbar/2', choice3='+1, -1', choice4='+\\hbar/2, -\\hbar/2', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: The Hamiltonian operator H = ε σ·n, where σ are the Pauli matrices, has eigenvalues that can be derived from the properties of the Pauli matrices. The eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices are ±1, and when multiplied by the constant ε, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian become +ε and -ε. This matches exactly with choice A) + ε, -ε. The other choices involve incorrect scaling factors or additional constants that do not apply to the eigenvalues derived from the Hamiltonian. Therefore, the correct answer is choice A.
