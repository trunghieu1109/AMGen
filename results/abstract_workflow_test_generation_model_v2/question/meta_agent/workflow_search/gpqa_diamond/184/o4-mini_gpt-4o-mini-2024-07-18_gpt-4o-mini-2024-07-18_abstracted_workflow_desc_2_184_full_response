The expression σ·n represents a linear combination of the Pauli matrices, which can be interpreted as a spin operator acting on spin-½ states. The eigenvalues of such a Hamiltonian, which describes a spin-½ particle in a magnetic field aligned along the direction of n, are known to be ±ε.

Therefore, the correct choice that represents the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator is '+ ε, -ε'.; answer: A\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent BHI3, determining eigenvalues of σ·n, thinking: The operator σ·n is a linear combination of the Pauli matrices, and its eigenvalues can be determined from the properties of the Pauli matrices. Each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues of ±1, and since σ·n is a projection onto the direction of the unit vector n, it also has eigenvalues ±1. Therefore, when we consider the Hamiltonian H = ε σ·n, the eigenvalues will be obtained by multiplying these eigenvalues by the constant ε, resulting in eigenvalues of +ε and -ε. Hence, the eigenvalues of the operator σ·n are ±1, which confirms that the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are indeed ±ε.; answer: A\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent NKkf, determining eigenvalues of σ·n, thinking: The operator σ·n, where σ represents the vector of Pauli matrices and n is a unit vector, acts on spin-½ states. The eigenvalues of any Pauli matrix are known to be ±1. Therefore, the operator σ·n, being a linear combination of the Pauli matrices, will also have eigenvalues ±1. This is a fundamental property of spin operators in quantum mechanics. Since the Hamiltonian is given by H = ε σ·n, the eigenvalues of H are obtained by multiplying the eigenvalues of σ·n by the constant ε. Thus, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian H are ±ε.
