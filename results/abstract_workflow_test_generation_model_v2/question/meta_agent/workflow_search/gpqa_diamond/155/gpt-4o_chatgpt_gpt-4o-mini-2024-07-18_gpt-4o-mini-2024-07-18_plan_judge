Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_16_155
proposed answer: After analyzing the results of both reactions involving (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene, we find that the products yield a total of 4 distinct chemical entities. In the standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC, all 4 compounds will be detected as separate peaks, resulting in 4 peaks. The chiral HPLC will also show 4 peaks because it can separate the enantiomers and the distinct alcohols from the reactions. Therefore, both HPLC methods will yield 4 peaks, which corresponds to choice A: '4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC'.

proposed answer: After analyzing the results from both the standard (achiral) and chiral HPLC methods, it is clear that the standard HPLC will show 3 peaks due to the presence of 3 distinct stereoisomers: two diastereomers from (E)-oct-4-ene and one meso compound from (Z)-oct-4-ene. The chiral HPLC will also show 3 peaks, as it can resolve the diastereomers into separate peaks. However, the provided options indicate that the chiral HPLC could show 4 peaks, which is not accurate based on the analysis. The closest correct choice that reflects the findings is '3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC', which is option B. Therefore, despite the discrepancy, option B is the best representation of the expected results from the HPLC analyses.
