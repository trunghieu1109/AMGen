Question: Example(question='A chemist performs two reactions:\n\nReaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. \n\nReaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.\n\nBoth reactions go to 100% completion. The chemist combines the products of both reactions, and then runs the product mixture on both a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column and a chiral HPLC column.\n\nAssuming that the chromatographic resolution is as high as theoretically possible in both cases, what does the chemist observe in each of these chromatograms?', choice1='4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', choice2='3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice3='2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice4='2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: After analyzing the reactions of (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene, we find that (E)-oct-4-ene produces two enantiomers, which will be detected as two separate peaks in standard HPLC. The (Z)-oct-4-ene produces a meso compound, which does not contribute an additional peak in standard HPLC. Therefore, we expect to see 2 peaks in standard HPLC. In chiral HPLC, the two enantiomers from (E)-oct-4-ene will be resolved into two peaks, and the meso compound from (Z)-oct-4-ene will contribute a third peak, leading to a total of 3 peaks in chiral HPLC. This aligns with choice C, which states '2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC'. Therefore, the correct answer is C.
