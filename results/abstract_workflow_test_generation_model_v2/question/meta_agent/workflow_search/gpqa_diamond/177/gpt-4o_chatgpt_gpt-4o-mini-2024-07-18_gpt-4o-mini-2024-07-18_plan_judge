proposed answer: The mass dimension of \kappa has been determined to be -1. In quantum field theory, a coupling constant with a negative mass dimension typically indicates that the theory is not renormalizable. This is because such a coupling can lead to an infinite number of divergences that cannot be absorbed into a finite number of counterterms. Therefore, despite the interaction term being dimensionally consistent, the negative mass dimension of \kappa suggests that the theory is not renormalizable.
