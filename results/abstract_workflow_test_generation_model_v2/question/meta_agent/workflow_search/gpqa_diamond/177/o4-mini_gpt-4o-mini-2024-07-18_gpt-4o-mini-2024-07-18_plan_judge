proposed answer: After analyzing the mass dimension of \kappa, we found that it is -1. This negative mass dimension indicates that the theory is not renormalizable, as coupling constants with negative mass dimensions lead to inconsistencies at high energy scales. Therefore, the correct answer must reflect both the mass dimension of \kappa being -1 and the theory being nonrenormalizable. This aligns perfectly with choice C, which states that the mass dimension \left[\kappa\right]_{M}=-1 and that the theory is not renormalizable.
