Question: Example(question='While designing a high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating at an accelerating voltage of 1000 kV, Mike connected vacuum pumps to create an ultra-high vacuum state (< 10^-9 Torr) in the sample compartment, aiming to minimize the presence of gas molecules for improved electron microscopy. However, as expected, some gas particles remained inside the compartment, as detected by the mass spectrometer. Mike accurately determined the mean free path of these gas molecules in the vacuum state (< 10^-9 Torr) to be λ1, based on factors such as sample compartment volume, pressure, and temperature. However, upon initiating the electron beam, he made an intriguing observation concerning the mean free path based on electron scattering with the gas molecules. He found that the mean free path was no longer equal to λ1; rather, it was λ2, even though the sample compartment temperature remained the same.\n\nWhat can we conclude about λ2 based on the aforementioned scenario?', choice1="λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation", choice2='λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1', choice3='λ2 < λ1', choice4='λ2 >= 1.22*λ1', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: When the electron beam is initiated, it interacts with the gas molecules present in the ultra-high vacuum state. This interaction increases the likelihood of collisions between the electrons and the gas molecules, effectively reducing the mean free path of the gas molecules. Since λ1 represents the mean free path under static conditions without the influence of the electron beam, and λ2 is observed when the beam is present, we can conclude that λ2 is less than λ1 due to the increased scattering. Therefore, the most plausible conclusion is that λ2 < λ1, which corresponds to choice C.
