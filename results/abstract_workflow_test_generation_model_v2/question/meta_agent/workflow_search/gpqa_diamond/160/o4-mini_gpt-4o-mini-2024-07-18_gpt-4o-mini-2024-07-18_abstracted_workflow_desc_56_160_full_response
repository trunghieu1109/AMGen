This is because the presence of the electron beam introduces additional scattering events that were not present before. The mean free path λ is inversely related to the collision cross-section; as the collision cross-section increases due to the scattering of electrons with gas molecules, the mean free path decreases. Therefore, since λ2 is affected by these additional scattering events, we can conclude that λ2 must be less than λ1, which was determined without the influence of the electron beam.

The mean free path λ1 is determined based on the vacuum conditions, which include the pressure and the temperature of the sample compartment. Since the temperature remains constant, the mean free path λ1 is calculated using the ideal gas law and the properties of the gas present in the vacuum.
