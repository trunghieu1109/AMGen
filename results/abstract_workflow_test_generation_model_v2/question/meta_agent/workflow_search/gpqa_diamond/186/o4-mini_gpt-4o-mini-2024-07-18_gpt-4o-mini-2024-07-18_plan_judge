proposed answer: In sub-task 7, it was determined that there are 4 detectable stars based on the criteria provided. The options given are: A) 4, B) 3, C) 2, D) 5. Since the count of detectable stars is 4, the correct choice that matches this count is A.

Answer:A
Extracted answer: A
Correct answer: 2

proposed answer: In Subtask 9, we classified the stars based on their detectability. The stars that were found to be detectable include Polaris, the star at 5 pc, and the star at 10 pc. The stars at 50 pc and 200 pc were determined to be not detectable due to their faintness and distance. Therefore, the total number of detectable stars is 3. This corresponds to option B in the provided multiple-choice options.

Answer:B
Extracted answer: B
Correct answer: 2
