The metric tensor g_ij for a rhombohedral lattice can be expressed in terms of the lattice parameters as follows: g_11 = a^2, g_22 = a^2, g_33 = a^2, g_12 = g_21 = a^2 * cos(α), g_13 = g_31 = a^2 * cos(β), g_23 = g_32 = a^2 * cos(γ).

The metric tensor g_ij for a rhombohedral crystal can be expressed in terms of the lattice constant 'a' and the angle 'α'. The components of the metric tensor are derived from the basis vectors that define the crystal structure. For a rhombohedral lattice, the basis vectors can be defined in terms of 'a' and 'α', leading to the metric tensor components.

Therefore, the closest match and the correct answer is 8.95 Å, which corresponds to choice B.; answer: B\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent tkmJ, round 0, selecting choice, thinking: The verified interplanar distance calculated from both methods is 8.95 Å. Among the provided options, 8.95 Å is explicitly listed as one of the choices. Therefore, it is the correct and closest match to the calculated value.; answer: B\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent Xdh5, round 0, selecting choice, thinking: After confirming the interplanar distance for the (111) plane of the rhombohedral crystal using both the metric tensor method and an alternate derivation, the calculated value is approximately 8.95 Å. Among the provided options (9.54 Å, 8.95 Å, 9.08 Å, 10.05 Å), the closest match is clearly 8.95 Å, which is exactly one of the options listed. This confirms that the answer is accurate and directly corresponds to the calculated interplanar distance.; answer: B\n<SEPERATOR>\nFinal Decision agent, final selection, thinking: After reviewing the calculations for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane in the rhombohedral crystal, the value has been consistently determined to be approximately 8.95 Å. This value is explicitly listed among the provided options. The other options (9.54 Å, 9.08 Å, and 10.05 Å) do not match the calculated result. Therefore, 8.95 Å is not only the closest match but is also the only option that corresponds exactly to the derived interplanar distance. This confirms that the answer is accurate and aligns perfectly with the calculations.; answer: B", iteration_idx=-1)]
