Question: Example(question='You are studying a nuclear decay which converts two heavy nucleons of flavor A to another flavor B, while simultaneously emitting two much lighter particles E and V. In short, 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V. It is known that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous, with some endpoint value Q.\n\nA variant of this decay emits one exotic, massless particle M instead of the 2V. In this case, how does the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles compare to that of the original decay?', choice1='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint increases.', choice2='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases.', choice3='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.', choice4='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint decreases.', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: In the original decay process, the emission of two lighter particles E and V results in a continuous energy spectrum for the outgoing E particles, capped at an endpoint value Q. When we transition to the variant decay that emits a massless particle M instead of the two V particles, the energy dynamics change. The massless particle M does not contribute to the total mass-energy budget, allowing for more energy to be available for the outgoing E particles. This results in a redistribution of energy, which means that the spectrum of the outgoing E particles remains continuous but with a modified shape. Additionally, since the massless particle M does not consume energy like the two V particles would, the maximum energy (or endpoint) available to the E particles can be expected to increase. Therefore, the most appropriate choice is that the spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.
