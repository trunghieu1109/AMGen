proposed answer: After analyzing the effects of stopping the pp-III branch on the neutrino flux in the specified energy bands, it is clear that the flux in the 700-800 keV band (band 1) will decrease significantly due to the cessation of a major source of neutrinos in that range. In contrast, the flux in the 800-900 keV band (band 2) will also decrease but not as drastically, as it is less reliant on the pp-III branch. The established understanding and calculations suggest that the ratio of flux (band 1) to flux (band 2) is approximately 0.1 (10^-1), indicating that the flux in band 1 is about one-tenth of that in band 2. Therefore, the correct answer regarding the ratio of the flux between these two bands after the pp-III branch has stopped is 0.1 (10^-1).

proposed answer: The analysis of the contributions of the pp-III branch to the neutrino flux in the specified energy bands indicates that the pp-III branch has a significant contribution to the 700-800 keV range, while the contributions to the 800-900 keV range are primarily from other processes such as 7Be decay. When the pp-III branch is hypothetically stopped, the flux in the 700-800 keV band would decrease significantly compared to the flux in the 800-900 keV band. This leads to a calculated ratio of approximately 0.1 (10^-1) for the flux in the 700-800 keV band relative to the 800-900 keV band. This conclusion is consistent across multiple analyses, confirming that the correct choice is A.
