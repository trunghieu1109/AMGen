Question: Example(question='We would like to dissolve (at 25°С) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm3 total volume. What is the minimum volume (cm3) of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution and what is the pH of the resulting solution?', choice1='pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3', choice2='pH 2.69; 30.09 cm3', choice3='pH 3.16; 32.14 cm3', choice4='pH 4.94; 20.40 cm3', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: After reviewing the calculations and the provided choices, it is clear that the pH of the solution after adding the required volume of strong acid is closest to 2.04. The calculations indicate that the concentration of H+ ions after adding the acid leads to a pH that aligns with this choice. The other options do not match the calculated values closely enough, making 2.04 the most reasonable answer based on the data provided.

proposed answer: To find the final pH, we need to combine the contributions of [H⁺] from the strong acid and from the hydrolysis of Fe³⁺. The volume of 0.1 M strong acid needed is calculated to be 28.05 cm³, which gives a certain concentration of [H⁺]. The additional [H⁺] from the hydrolysis of Fe³⁺ must also be considered. After calculating both contributions and adjusting for the total volume (which is the initial volume plus the volume of acid added), we can find the total [H⁺] concentration. Finally, we apply the formula pH = -log10([H⁺]_total) to find the final pH. The calculations lead to a final pH of 2.04, which corresponds to the first choice. Therefore, the answer is 'A)'.
