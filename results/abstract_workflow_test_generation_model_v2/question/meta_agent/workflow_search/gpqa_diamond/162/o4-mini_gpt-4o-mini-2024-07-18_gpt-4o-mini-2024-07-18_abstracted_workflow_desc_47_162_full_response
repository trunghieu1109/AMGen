The atomic weights are approximately: Fe = 55.85 g/mol, O = 16.00 g/mol, and H = 1.01 g/mol. The formula Fe(OH)₃ consists of 1 iron atom, 3 oxygen atoms, and 3 hydrogen atoms. Therefore, the molar mass is calculated as follows: Molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.85 g/mol (Fe) + 3 * (16.00 g/mol (O) + 1.01 g/mol (H)) = 55.85 + 3 * 17.01 = 55.85 + 51.03 = 106.88 g/mol.

The dissolution of Fe(OH)₃ can be represented as: Fe(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Fe³⁺ + 3OH⁻. The Ksp expression for this is Ksp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³. We need to relate the hydroxide concentration to the hydrogen ion concentration using the ion product of water, Kw = [H⁺][OH⁻] = 1.0×10⁻¹⁴. From this, we can express [OH⁻] as [OH⁻] = Kw / [H⁺]. Substituting this into the Ksp expression gives us Ksp = [Fe³⁺](Kw / [H⁺])³. Rearranging gives us [Fe³⁺] = Ksp / (Kw / [H⁺])³ = Ksp * [H⁺]³ / Kw³.

The dissociation of Fe(OH)₃ into Fe³⁺ and OH⁻ ions can be represented by the Ksp expression: Ksp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³.
