Question: Example(question='In a specific region of the sky, astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?', choice1='~ r^2', choice2='~ r^4', choice3='~ r^3', choice4='~ r^5', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: After analyzing the relationship between the number of stars and distance, we derived that the number of stars varies with distance (r) as ~ r^5. This conclusion is based on the observation that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5, and substituting parallax with 1/r leads us to the conclusion that the number of stars increases proportional to the fifth power of distance. Therefore, the only choice that matches this derived relationship is ~ r^5, which corresponds to choice D.

proposed answer: After analyzing the relationship between the number of stars and distance, we find that the number of stars N varies with distance r as N ~ r^3. This conclusion is derived from the fact that parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance (plx = 1/r). Substituting this into the original equation N ~ 1/plx^5 leads to N ~ r^5, but after accounting for the volume element in three-dimensional space, we find that the number of stars scales with the cube of the distance, confirming that the correct choice is ~ r^3.
