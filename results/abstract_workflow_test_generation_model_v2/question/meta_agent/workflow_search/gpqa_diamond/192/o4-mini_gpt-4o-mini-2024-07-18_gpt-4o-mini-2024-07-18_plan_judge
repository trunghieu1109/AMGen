Question: Example(question='In a specific region of the sky, astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?', choice1='~ r^2', choice2='~ r^4', choice3='~ r^3', choice4='~ r^5', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_4_192
proposed answer: Based on the analysis from Sub-task 5, we found that the exponent n is 3. This indicates that the number of stars per unit distance varies with the distance r as r^3. Among the provided choices, the one that accurately represents this relationship is choice 3, which is '~ r^3'. Therefore, the correct answer is C.

Answer:C
Extracted answer: C
Correct answer: 3
