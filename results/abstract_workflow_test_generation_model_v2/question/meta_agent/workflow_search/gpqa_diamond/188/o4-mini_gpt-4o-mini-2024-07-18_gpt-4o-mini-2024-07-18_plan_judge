Question: Example(question='Which of the following (effective) particles is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry?', choice1='Magnon', choice2='Skyrmion', choice3='Pion', choice4='Phonon', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_2_188
proposed answer: Phonons are quantized vibrational modes in a crystal lattice and do not arise from any spontaneous symmetry breaking; they maintain the symmetry of the lattice structure. In contrast, magnons, skyrmions, and pions are all associated with spontaneously broken symmetries. Therefore, phonons are the particle that does not have a flag indicating association with spontaneous symmetry breaking.

Answer:D
Extracted answer: D
Correct answer: 2
Question: Example(question='Which of the following (effective) particles is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry?', choice1='Magnon', choice2='Skyrmion', choice3='Pion', choice4='Phonon', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_2_188
proposed answer: In Sub-task 7, the Skyrmion was identified as the particle that is not associated with spontaneously broken symmetry. In the original question, the choices are Magnon (A), Skyrmion (B), Pion (C), and Phonon (D). Since Skyrmion corresponds to choice B, I will select B as the answer.

Answer:B
Extracted answer: B
Correct answer: 2
