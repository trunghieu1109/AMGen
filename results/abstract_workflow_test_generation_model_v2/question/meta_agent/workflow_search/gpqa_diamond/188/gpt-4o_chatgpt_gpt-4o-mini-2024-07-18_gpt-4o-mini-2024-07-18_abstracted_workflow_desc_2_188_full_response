Magnons arise from the breaking of rotational symmetry in ferromagnets, skyrmions are linked to the breaking of chiral symmetry, and pions are Goldstone bosons resulting from the breaking of chiral symmetry in QCD. In contrast, phonons are not associated with spontaneously-broken symmetry; they arise from the quantization of lattice vibrations in solids and do not correspond to a broken continuous symmetry.

In contrast, magnons, skyrmions, and pions are all associated with broken symmetries: magnons with rotational symmetry in ferromagnets, skyrmions with chiral symmetry, and pions as Goldstone bosons from chiral symmetry breaking in QCD.

Answer is a string include the answer for this query'}], sub_tasks='Sub-task 1 output: thinking - Spontaneously-broken symmetry occurs when the underlying laws of a system are symmetric, but the state of the system is not. This leads to the emergence of Goldstone bosons, which are massless excitations that arise due to the breaking of continuous symmetries. Characteristics of Goldstone bosons include being massless, existing in the low-energy spectrum of the theory, and being associated with the directions in which the symmetry is broken. In the context of the original question, we need to identify which of the given particles is not a Goldstone boson or does not arise from spontaneously-broken symmetry. Magnons, skyrmions, and pions are all associated with spontaneously-broken symmetries, while phonons are not typically associated with such a mechanism, as they arise from lattice vibrations in a solid and do not correspond to a broken continuous symmetry.; answer - D\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - Magnons arise in systems where the continuous rotational symmetry of spins is broken, typically in ferromagnets, leading to massless excitations. Skyrmions are associated with the breaking of chiral symmetry in certain field theories, giving rise to soliton-like structures that can also be considered as Goldstone-like excitations. Pions emerge from the breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics (QCD), and they are indeed Goldstone bosons. Phonons, however, arise from the quantization of lattice vibrations and are not associated with the breaking of continuous symmetries, thus they do not correspond to Goldstone bosons.

Characteristics of Goldstone bosons include being massless, existing in the low-energy spectrum of the theory, and being associated with the directions in which the symmetry is broken. In the context of the original question, we need to identify which of the given particles is not a Goldstone boson or does not arise from spontaneously-broken symmetry. Magnons, skyrmions, and pions are all associated with spontaneously-broken symmetries, while phonons are not typically associated with such a mechanism, as they arise from lattice vibrations in a solid and do not correspond to a broken continuous symmetry.; answer: D\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent voZl, identifying symmetries, thinking: Magnons arise from the breaking of spin rotational symmetry in a ferromagnet. They are associated with the low-energy excitations of the ordered magnetic state and are considered Goldstone bosons. Skyrmions are topological solitons that arise in theories with broken chiral symmetry, particularly in the context of nucleon interactions in quantum chromodynamics. They also represent Goldstone modes due to the underlying symmetry breaking. Pions are the lightest mesons and arise from the breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics as well; they are Goldstone bosons associated with this breaking. Phonons, however, arise from the vibrations of atoms in a solid lattice and are not associated with a broken continuous symmetry; they are collective excitations of the lattice and do not represent Goldstone bosons. Therefore, while magnons, skyrmions, and pions are all associated with spontaneously-broken symmetries, phonons are not, which leads to the conclusion that phonons do not correspond to a broken continuous symmetry.; answer: D\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent xHpk, identifying symmetries, thinking: Magnons arise in systems with broken spin symmetry, specifically in ferromagnets where the symmetry associated with spin rotation is broken. They are considered Goldstone bosons because they correspond to the low-energy excitations of the broken symmetry. Skyrmions are topological solitons in field theories that also relate to broken symmetries, particularly in the context of non-linear sigma models, and they can be associated with Goldstone modes as well. Pions are the Goldstone bosons associated with the breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). They are massless in the chiral limit and are thus Goldstone bosons. Phonons, however, arise from the quantization of lattice vibrations in solids and are associated with the broken translational symmetry of the crystal lattice, but they do not correspond to a continuous symmetry breaking in the same way that the others do. Therefore, while phonons do relate to broken symmetries, they do not fit the criteria of being Goldstone bosons like the others do, as they are not massless excitations resulting from a continuous symmetry breaking. Thus, phonons are the particle that does not fit with the others regarding spontaneously-broken symmetry and Goldstone bosons.; answer: D\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent 74bH, identifying symmetries, thinking: Magnons arise in systems where the continuous rotational symmetry of spins is broken, typically in ferromagnets, leading to massless excitations.
