Question: Example(question='In an inactive state, a transcription factor subunit awaits an activation signal from the membrane phosphorylation cascade. Upon phosphorylation on the Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, shuttles into the nucleus, and serves in gene transcription. A missense mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. You observe that a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Which of the following molecular phenotypes is most likely observed in the presence of mutation Y?', choice1='loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype', choice2='protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype', choice3='protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele', choice4='change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_24_157
proposed answer: The presence of the dominant-negative mutation Y in the dimerization domain prevents the wild-type transcription factor from forming functional dimers. This interference leads to a loss of protein dimerization, which is critical for the transcription factor's function. As a result, the wild-type protein cannot perform its role in gene transcription effectively, leading to a loss-of-function phenotype. Therefore, the most likely observed outcome is a loss of protein dimerization and a loss-of-function phenotype, which corresponds to choice A. The other choices do not accurately reflect the consequences of the dominant-negative mutation in this context.

proposed answer: The dominant-negative mutation Y in the dimerization domain is expected to interfere with the normal function of the wild-type transcription factor. This interference can prevent proper dimerization, which is crucial for the transcription factor's activity. As a result, the presence of mutation Y is likely to lead to a loss-of-function phenotype, as the wild-type protein would be unable to perform its essential role in gene transcription. Among the provided choices, 'protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype' best describes the expected outcome, as it captures both the potential for the mutated protein to aggregate and the resultant loss of function due to the dominant-negative effect. Therefore, the most likely observed outcome in the presence of mutation Y is a loss of function due to protein aggregation.
