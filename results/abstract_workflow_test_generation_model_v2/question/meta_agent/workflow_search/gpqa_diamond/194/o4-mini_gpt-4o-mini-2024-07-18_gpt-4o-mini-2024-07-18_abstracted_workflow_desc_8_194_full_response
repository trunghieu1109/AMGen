From the previous sub-task, we have R★ = 1.5 R☉ and we need to compute Rp2 for the second planet, which has a radius of 2.5 times that of Earth. Assuming Rp2 = 2.5 R⊕, we can substitute these values into the formula. We also derived cos i in the previous sub-task, which is a crucial value in our calculation.

We know from the previous sub-task that R★ = 1.5 R☉ and we need to find Rp2 (the radius of the second planet). Given that the second planet has a radius of 2.5 times that of Earth, we have Rp2 = 2.5 R⊕. We also derived cos i in the previous sub-task, which we assumed to be reasonable. Using these values, we can compute a2_max. However, since we don't have the exact value of cos i from the previous calculations, we will assume a typical value of cos i around 0.5 for transiting planets.
