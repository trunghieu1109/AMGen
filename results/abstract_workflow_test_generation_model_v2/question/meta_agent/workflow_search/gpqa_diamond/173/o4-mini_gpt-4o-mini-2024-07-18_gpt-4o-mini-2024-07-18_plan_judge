proposed answer: To determine the difference in kinetic energy ΔT = T1_relativistic - T1_classical, we need to analyze the values derived from previous calculations. The classical kinetic energy T1_classical was found to be approximately 1 GeV, which is equivalent to 1000 MeV. The relativistic kinetic energy T1_relativistic was calculated to be significantly higher due to relativistic effects, leading to a difference of 10 MeV when compared to the classical approximation. This difference is substantial and aligns with the choices provided in the question. Therefore, the most reasonable estimate for ΔT is 10 MeV, which corresponds to choice A).

proposed answer: The calculations for the difference in kinetic energy ΔT have consistently shown that the value is 10 MeV. This value directly corresponds to the first choice provided in the options. Since all previous analyses and calculations confirm that ΔT equals 10 MeV, it is clear that the correct answer is A. The other options (5 MeV, 2 MeV, and 20 MeV) do not match the calculated value, reinforcing that A is the only valid choice.
