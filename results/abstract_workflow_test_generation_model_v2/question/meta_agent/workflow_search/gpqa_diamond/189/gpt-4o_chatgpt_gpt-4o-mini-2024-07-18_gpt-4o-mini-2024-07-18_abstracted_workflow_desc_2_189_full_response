Hydroxide (OH-) is a strong nucleophile due to its negative charge and low steric hindrance, making it very reactive. Ethanethiolate (EtS-) is also a strong nucleophile because it is charged, but it is slightly larger than hydroxide, which might reduce its reactivity slightly in some contexts. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate is a nucleophile with a negative charge, but it has steric hindrance due to the bulky methyl group, making it less reactive than hydroxide and ethanethiolate. Propionate (CH3CH2COO-) is a weaker nucleophile because it is a carboxylate, which is less reactive than the previously mentioned nucleophiles. Methanol (CH3OH) is a very poor nucleophile because it is neutral and has significant steric hindrance, making it less likely to donate its electron pair.
