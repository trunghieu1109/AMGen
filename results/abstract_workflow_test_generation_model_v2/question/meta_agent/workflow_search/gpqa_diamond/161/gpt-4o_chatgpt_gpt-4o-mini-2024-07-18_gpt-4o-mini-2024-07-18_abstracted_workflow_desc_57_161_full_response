At r=2, we have x^2 + y^2 = 4, which is the boundary of the region where the metric is defined. At this boundary, the metric becomes singular, meaning it is not well-defined. Therefore, we cannot evaluate the area of the pseudosphere at this radius because the metric does not exist at the boundary.
