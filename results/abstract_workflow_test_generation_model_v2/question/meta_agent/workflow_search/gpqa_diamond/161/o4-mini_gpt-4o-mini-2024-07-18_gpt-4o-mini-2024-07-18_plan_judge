proposed answer: The area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2 has been computed to be +∞ based on the analysis of the metric and the integration over the defined region. Among the provided answer choices, the only one that matches this result is +∞. The other choices, which include 4π(x^2+y^2), 0, and 4π(x^2−y^2), do not represent an infinite area. Hence, the correct answer is A.
