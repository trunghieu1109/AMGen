The metric is given by ds^2 = (32/(4 - x^2 - y^2))(dx^2 + dy^2). This indicates that the metric tensor g_{ij} can be expressed as g_{ij} = (32/(4 - x^2 - y^2)) * δ_{ij}, where δ_{ij} is the identity matrix. The determinant of this metric tensor can be computed as det(g) = (32/(4 - x^2 - y^2))^2. The area element is then given by sqrt(det(g)) = (32/(4 - x^2 - y^2)). To find the area of the pseudosphere of radius r = 2, we need to integrate this area element over the appropriate region. The area of the pseudosphere is known to be infinite due to the nature of the metric as it approaches the boundary where 4 - x^2 - y^2 = 0.

In polar coordinates, we have x = r cos(θ) and y = r sin(θ), where r ranges from 0 to 2 (the radius) and θ ranges from 0 to 2π. The area element in polar coordinates is given by dA = r dr dθ. The integrand, sqrt(det g), is evaluated at the boundary, leading to an integral that diverges as we approach the boundary of the disk. Therefore, the area integral diverges, confirming that the area of the pseudosphere is infinite.

The metric is given by ds^2 = (32/(4 - x^2 - y^2))(dx^2 + dy^2). This indicates that the metric tensor g_{ij} can be expressed as g_{ij} = (32/(4 - x^2 - y^2)) * δ_{ij}, where δ_{ij} is the identity matrix.

Therefore, the area of the pseudosphere of radius r = 2 is +∞.; answer: A\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent o2cM, evaluating integral, thinking: To set up the double integral of sqrt(det g) over the disk defined by x^2 + y^2 ≤ 4, we first convert to polar coordinates where x = r cos(θ) and y = r sin(θ). The Jacobian of the transformation gives us an extra factor of r when converting the area element. The area element in polar coordinates becomes sqrt(det g) * r dr dθ. Since we found that sqrt(det g) = (32/(4 - r^2)), we can express the integral as: ∫ from 0 to 2π ∫ from 0 to 2 (32/(4 - r^2)) * r dr dθ. The integral with respect to θ simply contributes a factor of 2π. Therefore, the remaining integral is ∫ from 0 to 2 (32r/(4 - r^2)) dr, which can be evaluated using substitution or partial fractions. This integral diverges as we approach the boundary, confirming that the area of the pseudosphere is indeed +∞.; answer: A\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent qFIy, evaluating integral, thinking: To set up the double integral for the area of the pseudosphere using the area element sqrt(det g) over the disk defined by x^2 + y^2 ≤ 4, we first convert to polar coordinates where x = r cos(θ) and y = r sin(θ). In polar coordinates, the area element becomes sqrt(det g) = (32/(4 - r^2)). The bounds for r will be from 0 to 2 (since we are within the disk of radius 2) and for θ from 0 to 2π. Thus, the double integral becomes: ∫(from 0 to 2π) ∫(from 0 to 2) (32/(4 - r^2)) r dr dθ. Evaluating the r integral first gives a finite result, but as we approach the boundary where r = 2, the area diverges, leading us to conclude that the area is infinite. Therefore, the area of the pseudosphere of radius r = 2 is +∞, which corresponds to choice A.; answer: A\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent qows, evaluating integral, thinking: To set up the double integral of sqrt(det g) over the disk defined by x^2 + y^2 ≤ 4, we first convert to polar coordinates.
