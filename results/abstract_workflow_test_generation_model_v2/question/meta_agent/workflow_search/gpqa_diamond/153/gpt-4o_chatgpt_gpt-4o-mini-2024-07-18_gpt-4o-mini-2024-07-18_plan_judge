Question: Example(question='In the lab, a chemist discovers an unnamed bottle with a white solid inside. He gathers the following spectral information in order to identify the liquid. Make a reasonable structural suggestion for the unidentified drug using the information provided.\nMass: molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 (100%)\na peak at m/z = 158 (32%)\nIR : broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1, strong sharp peak at 1720 cm-1\n1H NMR: 11.0 ppm (s, 1H), 8.02 ppm (d, 2H), 7.72 (d, 2H)', choice1='4-chlorobenzoic acid', choice2='2-chlorobenzoic acid', choice3='3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde\n', choice4='Phenyl chloroformate', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: The spectral data provided indicates a molecular ion peak at m/z = 156, which is consistent with chlorobenzoic acids. The broad IR peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1 suggests the presence of a â€“COOH group, typical of carboxylic acids, and the sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 confirms the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) characteristic of carboxylic acids. The 1H NMR data shows a singlet at 11.0 ppm, indicative of a carboxylic acid proton, and the aromatic protons at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm suggest a substituted benzene ring. Among the choices provided, 4-chlorobenzoic acid is the most consistent with this data, as it contains both the carboxylic acid group and a chlorine substituent on the benzene ring. The other options either do not match the molecular weight or lack the necessary functional groups to fit the spectral data. Therefore, 4-chlorobenzoic acid is the best match based on the provided spectral data analysis.
