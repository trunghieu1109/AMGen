Question: Example(question='Astronomers are interested in the luminosities of two stars. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2. The mass of Star_1 is also larger by the same factor (1.5 times). Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same. Astronomers also calculated the radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:', choice1='~2.25', choice2='~2.35', choice3='~2.32', choice4='~2.23\n', correct_index=4)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_6_176
proposed answer: After analyzing the computed luminosity ratio L1/L2 using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, we found that the luminosity of Star_1 is influenced by its larger radius and the difference in temperature compared to Star_2. The calculations indicate that the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of approximately 2.35. Among the provided choices, the closest match to this computed value is choice B, which is ~2.35. Therefore, B is the most appropriate answer based on the calculations and the available options.

Answer:B
Extracted answer: B
Correct answer: 4
