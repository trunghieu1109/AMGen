proposed answer: Using the Stefan-Boltzmann Law, the luminosity of a star is proportional to the square of its radius and the fourth power of its temperature. Since both stars have the same temperature, we can focus on their radii. Given that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2, we can express the luminosity of Star_2 as L2 = 4π(R2)²σT⁴. For Star_1, we can express its luminosity as L1 = 4π(1.5R2)²σT⁴. Simplifying L1 gives us L1 = 4π(2.25R2²)σT⁴ = 2.25 * L2. Therefore, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of approximately 2.25, which corresponds to choice A.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_1_176
proposed answer: The computed luminosity ratio of Star_1 to Star_2, based on the analysis using the Stefan-Boltzmann Law and the given factors of radius and mass, indicates that Star_1 is approximately 2.25 times more luminous than Star_2. This matches the first choice provided, which is ~2.25. Therefore, the correct answer is A.
