Question: Example(question='Consider an oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis). Because it oscillates, it would radiate at a wavelength \\lambda. In the radiation zone, the radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of \\lambda and the angle \\theta (with z-axis), along which the power is measured. If the maximum power thus radiated is A, the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle \\theta = 30^0 and a possible form of f are, respectively,', choice1='1/2, \\lambda^(-4)', choice2='3/4, \\lambda^(-6)', choice3='1/4, \\lambda^(-4)', choice4='1/4, \\lambda^(-3)', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_15_174
proposed answer: After analyzing the derived form of the function f(λ, θ) for the radiated power per unit solid angle, we have established that it equals (1/4) * λ^(-4). This matches perfectly with choice 3, which states '1/4, λ^(-4)'. The other options either have different coefficients or different powers of λ, which do not align with our derived form. Therefore, the correct answer is clearly C.

proposed answer: After analyzing the derived function for the fraction of maximum power radiated at an angle of theta = 30°, we found that it is 3/4. Additionally, the wavelength dependence we derived is lambda^(-6). This perfectly matches with choice B) which states '3/4, lambda^(-6)'. Therefore, the correct answer is B, as it aligns with our calculations and findings.
