Since the quorum-sensing peptide from Lactobacillus acidophilus was observed to induce shmoo formation, it suggests that the peptide may mimic or interact with the eukaryotic signaling pathways involved in mating.

The active chromatin in the shmoo of Saccharomyces cerevisiae would likely be associated with proteins involved in transcription and gene regulation. The pre-initiation complex is crucial for the initiation of transcription, making it a likely candidate to be observed in this assay. The pre-replication complex is involved in DNA replication, which is not directly related to the active chromatin in the context of shmoo formation. The enhancer protein complex is also related to gene regulation but is more about enhancing transcription rather than being directly involved in the active transcription process. The nucleosome histone complex is a fundamental component of chromatin but is not a specific complex that would be isolated in this context.
