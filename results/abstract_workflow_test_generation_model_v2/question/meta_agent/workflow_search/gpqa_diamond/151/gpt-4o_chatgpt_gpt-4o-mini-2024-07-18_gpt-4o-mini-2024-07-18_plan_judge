Question: Example(question='You identified a new quorum-sensing peptide in the bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus. You are highly interested if its role in intercellular communication is conserved among the eukaryotes. You treat yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with the peptide and interestingly observe the formation of the shmoo. You want to learn about the proteome of the active chromatin in the shmoo and recover it by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. The least of proteins from which complex below will you observe in your assay?', choice1='pre-initiation complex', choice2='pre-replication complex', choice3='enhancer protein complex', choice4='nucleosome histone complex', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_2_151
proposed answer: In the context of chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry, we are focusing on the protein complexes associated with active chromatin during the formation of the shmoo in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The pre-initiation complex is essential for the initiation of transcription and is likely to be present during this process, making it highly likely to be observed. The enhancer protein complex, while involved in transcriptional regulation, may not be as prevalent as the pre-initiation complex. The nucleosome histone complex is a structural component of chromatin and does not represent a specific regulatory function that would be isolated in this assay. However, the pre-replication complex is primarily associated with DNA replication rather than transcriptional regulation, making it the least likely complex to be observed in this context. Therefore, the pre-replication complex is the least relevant to the active chromatin associated with shmoo formation and is the least likely to be detected in the assay.
