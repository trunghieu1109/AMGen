Question: Example(question='You identified a new quorum-sensing peptide in the bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus. You are highly interested if its role in intercellular communication is conserved among the eukaryotes. You treat yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with the peptide and interestingly observe the formation of the shmoo. You want to learn about the proteome of the active chromatin in the shmoo and recover it by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. The least of proteins from which complex below will you observe in your assay?', choice1='pre-initiation complex', choice2='pre-replication complex', choice3='enhancer protein complex', choice4='nucleosome histone complex', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_49_151
proposed answer: The least likely complex to be observed in the assay focusing on active chromatin during shmoo formation in yeast is the pre-replication complex. This complex is involved in DNA replication preparation and does not play a direct role in transcription, which is the primary focus when examining active chromatin. The other complexes, such as the pre-initiation complex, enhancer protein complex, and nucleosome histone complex, are all associated with transcription and chromatin activity, making them more relevant to the context of the study. Therefore, the pre-replication complex corresponds to choice B.
