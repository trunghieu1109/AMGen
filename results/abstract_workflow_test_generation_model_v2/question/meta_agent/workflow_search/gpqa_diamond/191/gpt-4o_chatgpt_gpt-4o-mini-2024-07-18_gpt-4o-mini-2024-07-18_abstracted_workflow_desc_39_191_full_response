Since point P is outside the conductor at a distance L, the relevant formula for the electric field due to a point charge is E = (1 / (4 * π * ε₀)) * (q / L^2). This corresponds exactly to choice 4, which states that E = (1 / (4 * π * ε₀)) * (q / L^2).

The presence of the positive charge +q inside the cavity induces a negative charge on the inner surface of the conductor and an equal positive charge on the outer surface, maintaining the overall neutrality of the conductor. Since the point P is outside the spherical conductor, we treat the entire charge +q as if it were concentrated at the center of the conductor due to the spherical symmetry of the system. The electric field due to a point charge at a distance L from the center is given by E = (1 / (4 * π * ε₀)) * (q / L^2).

Since point P is outside the conductor, we treat the entire charge as if it were concentrated at the center of the conductor.

According to Gauss's law, the electric field outside a conductor depends only on the total charge enclosed within it. Since the conductor itself is uncharged and the charge +q is effectively treated as if it were at the center of the spherical conductor, the electric field at a point outside the conductor behaves as if it is due to a point charge +q located at the center of the sphere. The distance from the center of the conductor to the point P outside the conductor is L, and thus the electric field at that point is given by the formula E = (1 / (4 * π * ε₀)) * (q / L^2).

Consequently, a positive charge of +q appears on the outer surface of the conductor to maintain overall charge neutrality. According to Gauss's law, the electric field outside a conductor depends only on the total charge enclosed. Since the outer surface now has an effective charge of +q, the electric field at a point outside the conductor (at a distance L from the center) behaves as if this charge were concentrated at the center of the conductor.

This leads to the conclusion that the correct choice is choice 4.; answer: D\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent Nfd0, applying Gauss's Law, thinking: Applying Gauss's Law to find the electric field outside the spherical conductor involves recognizing that the conductor is uncharged and that a positive charge +q is placed inside the cavity. This charge induces a negative charge on the inner surface of the conductor, and consequently, a positive charge +q appears on the outer surface of the conductor. By Gauss's Law, the electric field outside the conductor behaves as if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the conductor. Since the point P is outside the conductor at a distance L, we can use the formula for the electric field due to a point charge, which is E = k * q / r^2.
