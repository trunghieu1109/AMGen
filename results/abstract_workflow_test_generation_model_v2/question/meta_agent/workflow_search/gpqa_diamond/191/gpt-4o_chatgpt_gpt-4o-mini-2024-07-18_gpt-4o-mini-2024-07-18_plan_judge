Question: Example(question='Imagine an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ having a small spherical cavity inside. The centre of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the centre of the spherical conductor. The radius of the cavity is $r$, and $r<R$. Now consider a small amount of positive charge $+q$ is somehow placed somewhere inside the cavity. What is the magnitude of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at a point P (outside the spherical conductor) of distance $L$ from the centre of the spherical conductor? Note, the distance of the point P from the centre of the cavity is $l$. Here, l, L > R. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\\theta$\n', choice1='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n', choice2='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n', choice3='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\n', choice4='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: After analyzing the situation with the spherical conductor and the charge +q placed inside the cavity, we can apply Gauss's Law to determine the electric field at point P, which is located outside the conductor. Due to the spherical symmetry of the conductor, the electric field outside can be treated as if the entire charge +q were concentrated at the center of the conductor. The formula for the electric field due to a point charge at a distance L from the center is given by E = (1 / (4 * π * ε₀)) * (q / L²). This matches exactly with choice 4, which states E = (1 / (4 * π * ε₀)) * (q / L²). The other choices involve incorrect distances or configurations that do not apply to the situation outside the conductor. Therefore, the correct answer is choice D.
