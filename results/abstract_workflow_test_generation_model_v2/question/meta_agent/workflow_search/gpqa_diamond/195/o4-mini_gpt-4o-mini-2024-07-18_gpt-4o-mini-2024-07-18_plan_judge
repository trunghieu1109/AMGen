Question: Example(question=" Consider a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass $m$ and maximum amplitude $A$ obeying Hook's law ($F=-kx$). What is the maximum speed  $v_max$ of the mass? The speed of light is $c$.", choice1='$v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})}}$', choice2='$v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$', choice3='$v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2m})^2}}$', choice4='$v_{max}=\\sqrt{\\frac{kA^2}{m}}$', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: After analyzing the derived expression for the maximum speed v_max of the relativistic harmonic oscillator, we found that it simplifies to v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA^2/(2mc^2)))^2). This expression directly corresponds to choice 2, which is v_{max}=c\sqrt{1-\frac{1}{(1+\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}. The other choices do not match the structure or terms of our derived expression, confirming that choice B is indeed the correct answer.
