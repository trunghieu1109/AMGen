Question: Example(question='Compound X, which has the following IR and NMR data, reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Identify the final product.\nIR: 3400â€“2500 cm-1, 1720 cm-1, 1610 cm-1, 1450 cm-1\n1H NMR: 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H), 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H), 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).', choice1='1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene', choice2='4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid', choice3='2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid', choice4='1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: The predicted final product from the reaction of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid with red phosphorus and HI is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. This transformation occurs because the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is reduced to a -CH2- group, resulting in an alkyl-substituted aromatic compound. Among the provided choices, 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene is the only option that reflects this reduction accurately, while the other choices either retain the carboxylic acid group or do not correspond to the expected structure. Therefore, the correct answer is choice A.
