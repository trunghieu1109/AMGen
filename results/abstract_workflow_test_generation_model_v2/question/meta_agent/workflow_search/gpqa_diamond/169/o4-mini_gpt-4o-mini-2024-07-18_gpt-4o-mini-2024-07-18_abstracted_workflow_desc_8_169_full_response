To extract the unnormalized spinor, we simply write it as a column vector with the components given.

The conjugate transpose ψ† of [3i, 4]^T is [(-3i), 4]^T. Now we compute ψ†ψ: (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4) = 9 + 16 = 25. Therefore, ||ψ|| = sqrt(25) = 5. To normalize the spinor |ψ>, we divide each component of ψ by its norm: |ψ> = (1/5)[3i, 4] = [3i/5, 4/5]^T.

The Pauli matrix σ_y is given as [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. The expectation value <S_y> can be calculated using the state of the electron and the operator S_y. The state (3i, 4) can be normalized and then used to compute the expectation value. However, the choices provided suggest that the answer is a specific value derived from this calculation. The expectation value <σ_y> is indeed unitless, and the units come from ħ/2.

Now, we need to compute the inner product <ψ|σ_y|ψ> = <ψ|[-4i/5, -3/5]. The bra <ψ| is the conjugate transpose of |ψ>, which is [(-3i/5), (4/5)]. Therefore, <ψ|σ_y|ψ> = [(-3i/5), (4/5)] * [-4i/5, -3/5] = (-3i/5)(-4i/5) + (4/5)(-3/5). Calculating the first term gives: (-3i)(-4i)/(25) = 12/25 (since i^2 = -1). The second term gives: (4)(-3)/(25) = -12/25. Therefore, <σ_y> = 12/25 - 12/25 = 0.

The components are 3i and 4. The norm is calculated as follows: ||ψ|| = sqrt((3i)^2 + (4)^2) = sqrt(-9 + 16) = sqrt(7). To normalize the spinor |ψ>, we divide each component of the spinor by its norm.

The norm is given by ||ψ|| = sqrt(|3i|^2 + |4|^2). The absolute value squared of the first component |3i|^2 is (3i)(-3i) = 9, and for the second component |4|^2 = 16. Therefore, ||ψ|| = sqrt(9 + 16) = sqrt(25) = 5.
