Question: Example(question='Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are\nconstrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system\ncorrect to three decimals?', choice1='2.822 x 10^-26', choice2='5.645 x 10^-26', choice3='7.056 x 10^-27', choice4='122.330', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_3_179
proposed answer: The calculated potential energy of the system is 2.822 x 10^-26 Joules. This value matches exactly with the first choice provided in the original question. Since the question asks for the minimum energy of the system correct to three decimal places, and the calculated value is already in the required format, it confirms that choice 1 is indeed the correct answer. The other choices do not match the calculated energy, making choice 1 the only valid option.
