The period for system_1 is 2 years, which is 2 * 365.25 * 24 * 3600 seconds. For system_2, the period is 1 year, which is 1 * 365.25 * 24 * 3600 seconds. The radial velocity amplitudes for system_1 are 10 km/s and 5 km/s, which convert to 10000 m/s and 5000 m/s respectively. For system_2, the amplitudes are 15 km/s and 10 km/s, converting to 15000 m/s and 10000 m/s respectively. Using the formula M_total = P·(K1 + K2)^3/(2πG)·sin³i, we can calculate the total masses. The gravitational constant G is approximately 6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2. Assuming the inclination angle i is 90 degrees (sin(i) = 1), we can compute the total mass for both systems. After calculating, we find the mass ratio of system_1 to system_2. This leads us to conclude that system_1 is approximately 0.6 times as massive as system_2, hence the answer is ~ 0.6.; answer: C\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent mJNA, computing total mass of systems, thinking: To calculate the total mass of each binary star system, we need to use the derived formula M_total = P·(K1 + K2)^3/(2πG)·sin³i. We will assume the inclination angle i is the same for both systems for simplicity, and we can ignore the sin³i term for a comparative analysis. We will also use consistent units: we need to convert the periods from years to seconds and the radial velocity amplitudes from km/s to m/s. The gravitational constant G is approximately 6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2. For system_1, the period P is 2 years, which is 2 * 365.25 * 24 * 3600 = 63072000 seconds. The radial velocity amplitudes are K1 = 10 km/s = 10000 m/s and K2 = 5 km/s = 5000 m/s, giving K1 + K2 = 15000 m/s. For system_2, the period P is 1 year = 365.25 * 24 * 3600 = 31557600 seconds. The radial velocity amplitudes are K1 = 15 km/s = 15000 m/s and K2 = 10 km/s = 10000 m/s, giving K1 + K2 = 25000 m/s. Now we can compute the total masses: M_total_system_1 = (63072000) * (15000)^3 / (2 * π * 6.674 × 10^-11) and M_total_system_2 = (31557600) * (25000)^3 / (2 * π * 6.674 × 10^-11).

Once we have both total masses, we divide the total mass of system_1 by that of system_2 to find the mass ratio M1/M2.
