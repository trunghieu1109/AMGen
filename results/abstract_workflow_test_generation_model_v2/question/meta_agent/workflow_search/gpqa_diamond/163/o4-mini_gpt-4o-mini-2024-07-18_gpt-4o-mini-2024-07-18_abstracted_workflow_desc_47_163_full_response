For system_1, the period is stated to be 2 years, and for system_2, it is stated to be 1 year. Therefore, I can extract these values directly from the text.; answer - P1 = 2 years, P2 = 1 year\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - In system_1, the radial velocity amplitudes for the two stars are 10 km/s and 5 km/s. Therefore, K_sum1, which is the sum of these amplitudes, is 10 + 5 = 15 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes are 15 km/s and 10 km/s, so K_sum2 is 15 + 10 = 25 km/s. Thus, K_sum1 = 15 km/s and K_sum2 = 25 km/s.; answer - K_sum1 = 15 km/s, K_sum2 = 25 km/s\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - To convert the orbital periods P1 and P2 from years to seconds, we use the conversion factor that 1 year is approximately 3.154e7 seconds. Therefore, P1 = 2 years * 3.154e7 seconds/year = 6.308e7 seconds, and P2 = 1 year * 3.154e7 seconds/year = 3.154e7 seconds. For the radial velocity sums, K_sum1 and K_sum2 need to be converted from km/s to m/s. Since 1 km = 1000 m, we multiply by 1000. Thus, K_sum1 = 15 km/s * 1000 = 15000 m/s, and K_sum2 = 25 km/s * 1000 = 25000 m/s. Therefore, the final values are P1 = 6.308e7 seconds, P2 = 3.154e7 seconds, K_sum1 = 15000 m/s, and K_sum2 = 25000 m/s.; answer - P1 = 6.308e7 seconds, P2 = 3.154e7 seconds, K_sum1 = 15000 m/s, K_sum2 = 25000 m/s\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - To compute the semi-major axes a1 and a2 for each binary star system, we use the formula a = (K_sum * P) / (2π). For system_1, we have K_sum1 = 15000 m/s and P1 = 6.308e7 seconds. Thus, a1 = (15000 m/s * 6.308e7 s) / (2 * π) = (15000 * 6.308e7) / (2 * 3.14159) = 1.5e9 m approximately. For system_2, K_sum2 = 25000 m/s and P2 = 3.154e7 seconds. Therefore, a2 = (25000 m/s * 3.154e7 s) / (2 * π) = (25000 * 3.154e7) / (2 * 3.14159) = 1.25e9 m approximately.

Then, we convert the periods from years to the same units (seconds) for consistency: P1 = 2 years = 2 * 3.154e7 s and P2 = 1 year = 3.154e7 s, so P1/P2 = 2. Therefore, R = 0.216 * 2 = 0.432.
