Question: Example(question='Astronomers are studying two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2. Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.', choice1='~ 0.4', choice2='~ 0.7', choice3='~ 0.6\n', choice4='~ 1.2', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: To determine the mass ratio R = M1/M2 for the two binary star systems, we analyze the provided data. System_1 has a period of 2 years and system_2 has a period of 1 year. Using Kepler's third law, we can derive the total masses of both systems. The radial velocity amplitudes also provide insight into the mass distribution. After performing the necessary calculations, it is found that system_1 has a mass approximately 0.6 times that of system_2. This indicates that system_1 is less massive than system_2. The question asks for the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, which is a misunderstanding since system_1 is not more massive. Therefore, the closest provided choice that reflects the mass ratio is C, which indicates that system_1 is about 0.6 times the mass of system_2.

proposed answer: The calculations indicate that the mass ratio R = M1/M2 for system_1 compared to system_2 is approximately 0.4. This means that system_1 is about 0.4 times the mass of system_2. Since the question asks for the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we interpret this value as indicating that system_1 is less massive than system_2. Among the provided choices, the closest match is choice A) ~ 0.4. Therefore, I conclude that the correct answer is choice A.
