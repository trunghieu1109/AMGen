Question: Example(question='Astronomers are studying two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2. Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.', choice1='~ 0.4', choice2='~ 0.7', choice3='~ 0.6\n', choice4='~ 1.2', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_6_163
proposed answer: After analyzing the total masses of both binary star systems, it has been consistently determined that system_1 has a total mass that is approximately 0.6 times that of system_2. This indicates that system_1 is not more massive than system_2; in fact, it is less massive. Therefore, the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2 is not applicable. The correct choice reflecting this relationship is ~ 0.6, which corresponds to option C.

proposed answer: The calculated mass ratio M1/M2 is approximately 0.6, which is the result of analyzing the radial velocity amplitudes and the periods of the binary star systems. Among the provided options, '~ 0.6' is the closest match to this value. The other options, '~ 0.4', '~ 0.7', and '~ 1.2', do not accurately reflect the calculated ratio. Therefore, the choice that best represents the mass relationship between system_1 and system_2 is '~ 0.6'.
