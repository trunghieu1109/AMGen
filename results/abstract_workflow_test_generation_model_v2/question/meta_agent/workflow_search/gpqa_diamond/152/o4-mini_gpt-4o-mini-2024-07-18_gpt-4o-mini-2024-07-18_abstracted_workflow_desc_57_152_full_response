This attack leads to the formation of a resonance-stabilized intermediate, which is crucial for the stability of the product. The resonance allows for the delocalization of charge, making the intermediate more stable. After the nucleophilic attack, the intermediate can undergo protonation or further reactions to yield the final product.

Bases can deprotonate acidic protons, favoring the formation of enolates or enols, which can stabilize certain tautomeric forms. For example, in the case of the dione product, the basic conditions will promote the formation of the enolate form, which is often more stable than the keto form due to resonance. Additionally, the solvent can also play a role in stabilizing particular tautomers. In this context, the reaction conditions can lead to side transformations, such as the formation of unexpected products if the conditions favor alternative pathways.
