Question: Example(question='α-β unsaturated carbonyls have a much more electrophilic carbon double bond. These double bonds act as a good Lewis acid and react with nucleophiles to produce enolate ions. In this case, when a nucleophile attacks the β position, it produces a resonance-stabilized intermediate. When a nucleophile attacking the β-carbon is enolate, such reaction is known as the Michael reaction.\nWhat are the reactants and major final products of the following Michael addition reactions?\ndimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) -->(A)\n1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H3O+) --> (B)\nC + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H2O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice1='A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice2='A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice3='A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice4='A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: After evaluating the predicted products from the Michael addition reactions, it is evident that the products align with the descriptions provided in choice A. For reaction A, the product is indeed trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, which corresponds to the expected outcome of the nucleophile attacking the β-carbon. In reaction B, the product 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile is consistent with the reaction of the enolate with (E)-but-2-enenitrile. Lastly, for reaction C, the product 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione matches the expected result of the enolate attacking but-3-en-2-one. Therefore, choice A accurately reflects the major products of the reactions, confirming it as the correct answer.

proposed answer: Upon reviewing the predicted products from the Michael addition reactions, I find that choice 1 accurately reflects the expected outcomes based on the mechanisms involved. In reaction A, the product trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate is consistent with the nucleophilic attack of dimethyl malonate on the β-carbon of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. For reaction B, the product 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile aligns with the expected result of the enolate from (E)-but-2-enenitrile attacking the cyclohexyl piperidine. Lastly, in reaction C, the formation of 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione from the reaction of but-3-en-2-one with cyclohexanone is also supported by the reaction mechanism. Therefore, the products in choice 1 are validated as the correct major products of the reactions described.
