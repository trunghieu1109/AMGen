proposed answer: After analyzing the four proposed sequences for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, it is evident that choice A is the most efficient and yields the best results. The sequence starts with a Friedel-Crafts alkylation using tert-butyl chloride and AlCl3, which is a well-established method for introducing bulky groups onto aromatic rings. This is followed by nitration with HNO3 and H2SO4, which is strategically placed to direct the nitro group to the meta position due to the electron-donating nature of the tert-butyl group. The subsequent introduction of the ethoxy group via nucleophilic substitution with ethyl bromide and NaOH is straightforward and effective. Other choices either misorder the reactions or include unnecessary steps that could lead to lower yields or unwanted byproducts. Therefore, choice A stands out as the optimal pathway for achieving a high yield of the target compound, making it the best choice for this synthesis.

proposed answer: After analyzing the four sequences, Choice C stands out as the most efficient and mechanistically sound pathway for synthesizing 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene. It begins with a Friedel-Crafts alkylation using tert-butyl chloride and AlCl3, which is a well-established method for introducing bulky groups like tert-butyl. The subsequent use of SO3/H2SO4 introduces a sulfonyl group, which is a meta director, allowing for the later introduction of a nitro group via HNO3/H2SO4 without any directing conflicts. This sequence respects the directing effects of the substituents, ensuring that the final product is synthesized efficiently. The final step involves the introduction of the ethoxy group using NaOH and EtBr, which can be directed appropriately. Overall, this pathway is expected to yield the target compound effectively, making it the best choice. Choices A, B, and D have various issues such as incorrect order of reactions or potential directing conflicts that would lower their efficiency and yield. Therefore, the ranking is clear, with Choice C being the best option.
