The matrix P is given by: [[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]. We calculate the determinant of (P - λI) where I is the identity matrix and λ is the eigenvalue.

We can find the eigenvalues by solving the characteristic polynomial det(Q - λI) = 0, where I is the identity matrix. This leads to the eigenvalues λ = 1, λ = 0, and λ = -1. For each eigenvalue, we can find the corresponding eigenvector by solving the equation (Q - λI)v = 0. For λ = 1, we find the eigenvector is (1, 0, 0); for λ = 0, the eigenvector can be taken as (0, 1, 0); and for λ = -1, the eigenvector is (0, 0, 1).

The projection operator is formed from the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 of operator P. After applying the projection operator, we obtain a new state vector. We then need to normalize this resulting vector to ensure it is a valid quantum state. The normalization involves dividing the resulting vector by its norm.

From the previous analysis, the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue -1 is (0, 0, 1). The projection operator P onto the eigenspace spanned by this eigenvector can be constructed using the outer product of the eigenvector with itself. The eigenvector can be represented as a column matrix v = (0, 0, 1). The projection operator P is given by P = v * v^T, where v^T is the transpose of v. Therefore, P = (0, 0, 1) * (0, 0, 1)^T = [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1]]. This matrix projects any vector onto the direction of the eigenvector (0, 0, 1), which corresponds to the eigenvalue -1 of the operator Q.; answer - P = [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1]]\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 8 output: thinking - To compute the conditional probability of measuring Q = -1 on the post-P=0 state, we first need to apply the projection operator for Q corresponding to the eigenvalue -1 to the post-measurement state obtained after measuring P = 0. The post-measurement state is derived from the previous sub-task, and we denote it as |ψ'>. The projection operator for Q corresponding to eigenvalue -1 is P_Q = [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1]]. We apply this operator to the state |ψ'> to get the projected state |ψ''>. The conditional probability is then calculated as the squared norm of the projected state |ψ''> divided by the norm of the original state |ψ'>. This gives us the probability of measuring Q = -1 given that we have already measured P = 0. After performing the calculations, we find that the conditional probability is 1/3.
