Question: Example(question='The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1), and the operators of two observables P and Q of the system are represented by two square matrices. The matrix corresponding to operator P has the elements in first row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0), elements in the second row as (1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}) and that in third row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0). The matrix operator for Q is represented by the square matrix having elements in the first row as (1, 0, 0), second row as (0, 0, 0) and third row as (0, 0, -1). Now, if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P, what is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements?', choice1='1/2', choice2='1/6', choice3='1/3', choice4='2/3', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_2_175
proposed answer: To find the overall probability of measuring 0 for P and -1 for Q, we need to multiply the probabilities obtained from the previous sub-tasks. The probability of measuring 0 for P is 1/3, and the probability of measuring -1 for Q after measuring 0 for P is 1/2. Therefore, the overall probability is (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.
