The cobalt species include the free Co²⁺ ions and the various cobalt-thiocyanate complexes. The mass-balance equation can be expressed as: c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [Co(SCN)²⁺] + [Co(SCN)₂²⁺] + [Co(SCN)₃³⁺] + [Co(SCN)₄⁴⁻]. Each complex concentration can be expressed in terms of [Co²⁺], [SCN⁻], and the stability constants βₙ. For example, [Co(SCN)²⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻], [Co(SCN)₂²⁺] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]², and so on. This allows us to express the total cobalt concentration in terms of the free cobalt concentration and the thiocyanate concentration, leading to a system of equations that can be solved to find the concentrations of each species. Therefore, the answer is A.; answer - A\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - To derive the expression for the fraction α₂, we start from the definition of α₂ which represents the fraction of Co(SCN)₂²⁺ complexes relative to the total concentration of cobalt species. The numerator β₂[SCN-]² represents the concentration of the Co(SCN)₂²⁺ complex formed from the free Co²⁺ ions and two thiocyanate ions. The denominator sums up all the species present, which includes the free Co²⁺, the first complex Co(SCN)²⁺, the second complex Co(SCN)₂²⁺, the third complex Co(SCN)₃³⁺, and the fourth complex Co(SCN)₄⁴⁻. This total concentration accounts for all cobalt species in the solution, ensuring that the fraction is calculated correctly. Thus, the expression for α₂ is correctly derived as α₂ = β₂[SCN-]² / (1 + β₁[SCN-] + β₂[SCN-]² + β₃[SCN-]³ + β₄[SCN-]⁴).; answer - A\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - To compute the numerical value of α₂, we substitute the given values into the derived expression. We have c(Co) = 10^-2 M, [SCN-] = 0.1 M, and the stability constants β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, and β₄ = 16. The expression is α₂ = β₂[SCN-]² / (1 + β₁[SCN-] + β₂[SCN-]² + β₃[SCN-]³ + β₄[SCN-]⁴). Substituting the values: β₂[SCN-]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4. Now calculating the denominator: 1 + 9 * 0.1 + 40 * 0.01 + 63 * (0.1)³ + 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646. Therefore, α₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.169. To find the percentage, we multiply by 100, giving us approximately 16.9%.

Therefore, the answer is A.; answer: A\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent 9IWw, deriving alpha2 expression, thinking: To derive the expression for the fraction α₂, we start with the definition of α₂, which represents the fraction of cobalt that is in the form of the Co(SCN)₂²⁺ complex. The numerator is the concentration of the Co(SCN)₂²⁺ complex, which can be expressed as β₂[SCN-]². The denominator represents the total concentration of cobalt species, which includes the free Co²⁺ ions and all the cobalt-thiocyanate complexes. The total cobalt concentration can be expressed as 1 + β₁[SCN-] + β₂[SCN-]² + β₃[SCN-]³ + β₄[SCN-]⁴, where each term corresponds to the respective cobalt species. Thus, the fraction α₂ is given by the ratio of the concentration of the Co(SCN)₂²⁺ complex to the total concentration of cobalt species. Therefore, the derived expression for α₂ is α₂ = β₂[SCN-]² / (1 + β₁[SCN-] + β₂[SCN-]² + β₃[SCN-]³ + β₄[SCN-]⁴).; answer: A\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent 1wxv, deriving alpha2 expression, thinking: To derive the expression for the fraction α₂, we start with the definition of α₂, which represents the fraction of cobalt that is present as the dithiocyanato complex [Co(SCN)₂²⁺]. The expression for α₂ is given as β₂[SCN-]² divided by the sum of all possible cobalt species concentrations, which includes the free Co²⁺ and all thiocyanate complexes.

We have c(Co) = 10^-2 M, [SCN-] = 0.1 M, and the stability constants β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, and β₄ = 16. First, we calculate the numerator: β₂[SCN-]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4. Next, we calculate the denominator: 1 + β₁[SCN-] + β₂[SCN-]² + β₃[SCN-]³ + β₄[SCN-]⁴ = 1 + 9 * 0.1 + 40 * 0.01 + 63 * (0.1)³ + 16 * (0.1)⁴. This simplifies to 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646. Now we can calculate α₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.169 or 16.9%.

We first calculate the numerator: β₂[SCN-]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4. Next, we calculate the denominator: 1 + β₁[SCN-] + β₂[SCN-]² + β₃[SCN-]³ + β₄[SCN-]⁴ = 1 + 9*0.1 + 0.4 + 63*(0.1)³ + 16*(0.1)⁴ = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646. Now we find α₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.169. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100 to get approximately 16.9%.

We have c(Co) = 10^-2 M, [SCN-] = 0.1 M, and the stability constants β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, and β₄ = 16. The expression is α₂ = β₂[SCN-]² / (1 + β₁[SCN-] + β₂[SCN-]² + β₃[SCN-]³ + β₄[SCN-]⁴). Substituting the values: β₂[SCN-]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4. Now calculating the denominator: 1 + 9 * 0.1 + 40 * 0.01 + 63 * (0.1)³ + 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646. Therefore, α₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.169. To find the percentage, we multiply by 100, giving us approximately 16.9%.
