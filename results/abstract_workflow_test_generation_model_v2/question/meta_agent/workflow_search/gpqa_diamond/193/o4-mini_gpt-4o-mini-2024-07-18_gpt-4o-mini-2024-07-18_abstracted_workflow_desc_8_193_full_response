Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Final Decision Agent r6Xg', content='To determine the partition function Z for the system of three spins, we need to consider the contributions from all possible energy states. The energy levels and their contributions were calculated based on the degeneracies of the states. For the energy level E = -3J, there are 2 configurations contributing 2 * exp(3J * beta). For E = -J, there are 3 configurations contributing 3 * exp(J * beta). For E = J, there are 3 configurations contributing 3 * exp(-J * beta). Finally, for E = 3J, there is 1 configuration contributing exp(-3J * beta). Summing these contributions gives us Z = 2 * exp(3J * beta) + 3 * exp(J * beta) + 3 * exp(-J * beta) + exp(-3J * beta). Upon simplifying, we find that the contributions for E = -J combine to give 6 * exp(-J * beta), leading to the final expression Z = 2 * exp(3J * beta) + 6 * exp(-J * beta).
