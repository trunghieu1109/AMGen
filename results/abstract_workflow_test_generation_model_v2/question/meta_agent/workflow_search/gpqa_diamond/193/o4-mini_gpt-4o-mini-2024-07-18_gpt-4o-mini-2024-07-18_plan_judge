Question: Example(question='Consider a system of three spins S1, S2 and S3. Each of which can take spin +1 and -1. The energy of the system is given by, E= -J[ S1S2 +S1S3+S2S3 ].\nFind the partition function Z of the system. (\\beta = 1/kT , k= boltzmann constant and T= temperature)', choice1='Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)', choice2='Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)', choice3='Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)', choice4='Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: To determine the partition function Z for the system of three spins, we need to consider the contributions from all possible energy states. The energy levels and their contributions were calculated based on the degeneracies of the states. For the energy level E = -3J, there are 2 configurations contributing 2 * exp(3J * beta). For E = -J, there are 3 configurations contributing 3 * exp(J * beta). For E = J, there are 3 configurations contributing 3 * exp(-J * beta). Finally, for E = 3J, there is 1 configuration contributing exp(-3J * beta). Summing these contributions gives us Z = 2 * exp(3J * beta) + 3 * exp(J * beta) + 3 * exp(-J * beta) + exp(-3J * beta). Upon simplifying, we find that the contributions for E = -J combine to give 6 * exp(-J * beta), leading to the final expression Z = 2 * exp(3J * beta) + 6 * exp(-J * beta). This matches the first choice provided in the original question, confirming that the correct answer is A.
