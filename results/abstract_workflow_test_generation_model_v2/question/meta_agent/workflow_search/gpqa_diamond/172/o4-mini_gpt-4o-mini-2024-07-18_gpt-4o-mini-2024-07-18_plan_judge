Question: Example(question="If uncertainty in space of electron's location, which is travelling with speed v= 2* 10^8 m/s along x-direction is Δx=0.1 nm . Based on the infromation estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of electron.", choice1='~10^(-19) J', choice2='~10^(-18) J', choice3='~10^(-16) J', choice4='~10^(-17) J', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_6_172
proposed answer: The computed energy uncertainty ΔE is approximately 1.055 x 10^(-16) J. Among the provided choices, the closest match is '~10^(-16) J', which corresponds to choice C. The other options are either too high or too low compared to the computed value, making C the most accurate selection. This is confirmed by the fact that the computed value falls within the range of the choice C, while choices A, B, and D do not align closely with the calculated uncertainty.

Answer:C
Extracted answer: C
Correct answer: 3
