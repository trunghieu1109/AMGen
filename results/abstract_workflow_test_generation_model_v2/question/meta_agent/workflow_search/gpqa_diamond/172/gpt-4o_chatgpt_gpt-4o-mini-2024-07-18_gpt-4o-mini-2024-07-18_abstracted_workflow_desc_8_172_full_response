The mass of the electron is approximately 9.11 * 10^(-31) kg. We have already calculated the uncertainty in momentum Δp to be approximately 5.275 * 10^(-25) kg·m/s. Now we can find Δv by rearranging the equation to Δv = Δp / m. Plugging in the values, we get Δv = (5.275 * 10^(-25) kg·m/s) / (9.11 * 10^(-31) kg) = 5.8 * 10^5 m/s. This value of Δv indicates the minimum uncertainty in the velocity of the electron. Since we are interested in the uncertainty in energy (ΔE), we can relate it to the uncertainty in velocity. The energy of a relativistic electron can be expressed as E = γmc^2, where γ is the Lorentz factor. However, for small uncertainties, we can use the non-relativistic approximation ΔE = m * v * Δv.

This value is significant compared to the speed of the electron (v = 2 * 10^8 m/s), so we must consider relativistic effects. However, for the purpose of calculating the uncertainty in energy, we can proceed with Δv calculated using the classical approximation. The uncertainty in energy ΔE can be calculated using the formula ΔE = m * v * Δv. Using the average velocity v = 2 * 10^8 m/s, we find ΔE = (9.11 * 10^(-31) kg) * (2 * 10^8 m/s) * (5.8 * 10^5 m/s) = 1.06 * 10^(-17) J.
