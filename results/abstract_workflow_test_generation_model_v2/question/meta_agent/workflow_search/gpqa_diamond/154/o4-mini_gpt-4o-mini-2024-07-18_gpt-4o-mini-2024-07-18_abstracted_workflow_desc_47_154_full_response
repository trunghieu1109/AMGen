The expectation value <P_z> is given by the formula <P_z> = ⟨ψ|P_z|ψ⟩, where |ψ⟩ is our state vector. The state vector is (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2).

The expectation value <P_z> is given by the formula <P_z> = <psi|P_z|psi>, where |psi> is the state vector. The state vector is given as (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). We can represent this as a column vector: |psi> = |(-1/2), (1/sqrt(2}), (-1/2)|. The matrix for P_z is \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix}.
