Question: Example(question='Consider an aperture, which shapes like a N-sided polygon. All the apothems are of the same length a. When a monochromatic light (of wavelength \\lambda), travelling along z-axis, falls vertically on this aperture, it creates a series of intensity maxima and minima in the far field region. What is the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large ? Assume that the related angles are small so that tan theta = theta approximation can be taken.', choice1='1.220 \\lambda /a ', choice2='0.610 \\lambda / a', choice3='0.500 \\lambda / a', choice4='0.506 \\lambda / a', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: The result of 0.610·λ/a matches exactly with the provided answer choice B. This is derived from the diffraction pattern formed by an N-sided polygon aperture as N approaches infinity, leading to the formula for the first minimum being θ₁ = 1.22·λ/(2a). Simplifying this gives us θ₁ = 0.610·λ/a, confirming that the correct answer is indeed choice B.

proposed answer: After substituting D = 2a into the equation for the angular distance Δθ, we simplified it to Δθ = (α₂ – α₁)·λ/(2π a). The coefficient derived from previous calculations is 0.506, which corresponds to the choice D in the original question. Therefore, when comparing the simplified result to the provided answer choices, the matching result is 0.506 λ/a, which is option D.
