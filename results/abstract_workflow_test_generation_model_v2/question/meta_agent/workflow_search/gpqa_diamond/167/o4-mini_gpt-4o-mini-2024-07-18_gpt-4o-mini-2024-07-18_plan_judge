Question: Example(question='Which of the following issues are the most common sources of difficult-to-spot erroneous results generated in genomics data analysis:\n\n- Mutually incompatible data formats\n- The "chr" / "no chr" confusion\n- Reference assembly mismatch\n- Incorrect ID conversion', choice1='3 and 4', choice2='2 and 3', choice3='All of the above', choice4='2, 3 and 4', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_2_167
proposed answer: The most common sources of difficult-to-spot errors in genomics data analysis have been identified as the 'chr/no chr' confusion (issue 2), reference assembly mismatch (issue 3), and incorrect ID conversion (issue 4). Among the provided answer choices, only choice 4 includes all three of these issues, stating '2, 3 and 4'. Therefore, choice 4 accurately represents the identified sources of errors, making it the correct answer.
