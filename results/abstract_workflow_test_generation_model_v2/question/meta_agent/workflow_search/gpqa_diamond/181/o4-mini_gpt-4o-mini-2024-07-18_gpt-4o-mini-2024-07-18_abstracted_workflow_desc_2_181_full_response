Firstly, it assumes trap-free transport, meaning that there are no traps in the semiconductor that would hinder the movement of charge carriers. Secondly, it operates under the condition of single-carrier transport, which means that only one type of charge carrier (either electrons or holes) is dominant in the conduction process. Thirdly, it assumes that the contact injection behavior is such that there is no significant barrier to the injection of carriers at the contacts, which is typically the case for Ohmic contacts. Lastly, it assumes that the diffusion current is negligible compared to the drift current, which is valid in the SCLC regime where the electric field is strong enough to dominate the transport mechanism.

'Single-carrier' operation refers to a condition where only one type of charge carrier (either electrons or holes) contributes significantly to the conduction process, which simplifies the analysis of the current flow. 'Ohmic contacts' are those that allow for linear current-voltage behavior without significant barriers to carrier injection, ensuring that the contact does not impede the flow of charge carriers. In contrast, 'Schottky contacts' have a potential barrier that can impede carrier injection, making them less ideal for the assumptions of the Mott-Gurney equation. Finally, diffusion current is considered negligible when the electric field is strong enough that the drift current (movement of carriers due to the electric field) dominates over the diffusion current (movement of carriers due to concentration gradients). This is a key condition in the space-charge-limited current regime where the Mott-Gurney equation is applicable.; answer: A\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent 43uj, defining assumptions, thinking: In semiconductor physics, 'trap-free' refers to a condition where there are no localized states within the bandgap that can capture charge carriers, allowing for unimpeded transport of carriers through the material. 'Single-carrier' operation means that only one type of charge carrier (either electrons or holes) is primarily responsible for conduction, which simplifies the analysis and ensures that the behavior can be described by a single carrier mobility. 'Ohmic' contacts are characterized by a linear current-voltage relationship, indicating that there is no significant energy barrier to carrier injection, making them ideal for applications where efficient charge transport is required. In contrast, 'Schottky' contacts have a potential barrier that can impede carrier injection, which is not suitable for the Mott-Gurney equation's assumptions. Finally, diffusion current becomes negligible when the electric field is strong enough that drift current dominates the charge transport, typically in the SCLC regime where the voltage is sufficiently high.
