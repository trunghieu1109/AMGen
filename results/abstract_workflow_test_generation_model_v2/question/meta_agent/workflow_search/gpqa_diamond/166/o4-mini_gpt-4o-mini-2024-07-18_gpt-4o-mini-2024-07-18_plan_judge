proposed answer: After evaluating the non-Gaussianity Δ_b for the given parameters phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5, the calculations consistently yield a value of 2.48. This result aligns with the expected behavior of the Schrödinger cat state, which is known to exhibit significant non-Gaussianity. The choice of 2.48 is supported by multiple evaluations and is the only option that reflects the substantial deviation from Gaussianity in this context. Therefore, I conclude that the correct answer is A.

proposed answer: The computed non-Gaussianity measure del_b is 0, which indicates that the state does not exhibit any non-Gaussian characteristics for the given parameters (phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5). When comparing this value to the provided choices [2.48, 0, 1.38, 0.25], the closest match is clearly 0, as it is exactly equal to the computed value. Therefore, the answer is B, as it directly corresponds to the computed non-Gaussianity.

proposed answer: In the previous calculations, we determined that Delta_b is -1.38. Since we are interested in the non-Gaussianity, we take the absolute value, which is 1.38. Among the provided choices, the closest match to this value is choice C, which is also 1.38. Therefore, the most accurate representation of the non-Gaussianity based on our calculations is choice C.
