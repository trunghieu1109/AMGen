Question: Example(question='Calculate the amount of non-Gaussianity(nG) in the Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy measure. The state is defined as,\n|psi> =( cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> )/ N;\nHere, alpha is the amplitude, phi is the phase and N is the normalisation constant.\nN = sqrt(1+ sin(2*phi)*exp(-2*alpha^2)).\nThe relative entropy measure is given as,\ndel_b = [trace(rho* ln(rho))-trace(tau* ln(tau))]\nwhere tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state and rho is the density matrix of the above non-Gaussian state.\nCalculate the nG for phi =-pi /4 and alpha= 0.5.', choice1='2.48', choice2='0', choice3='1.38', choice4='0.25', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: After reviewing the calculations and the context of the problem regarding the non-Gaussianity of the Schrödinger cat state, it is clear that the calculated relative entropy measure del_b was found to be 1.38. This value is consistent with the expected outcomes for similar quantum states and is one of the provided choices. The other options do not align with the calculated result, making 1.38 the most reasonable and fitting choice. Therefore, I conclude that the correct answer is C.
