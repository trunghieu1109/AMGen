Question: Example(question='What is the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product obtained when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess of HI?', choice1='1', choice2='3', choice3='0', choice4='5', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_29_182
proposed answer: The index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) for the product obtained from the reaction has been consistently calculated to be 1 across multiple analyses. This indicates that there is one degree of unsaturation remaining in the product after the reaction. The choices provided in the original question include '1' as the first option, which directly corresponds to the calculated IHD. Therefore, based on the calculations and the matching of the IHD value with the provided choices, the correct answer is A.
