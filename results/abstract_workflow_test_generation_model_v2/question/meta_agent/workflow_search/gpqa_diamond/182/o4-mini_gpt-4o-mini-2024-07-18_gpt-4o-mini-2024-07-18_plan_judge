proposed answer: To calculate the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) for the molecular formula C10H12O2, we use the formula IHD = (2C + 2 + N - H - X) / 2. Here, C = 10 (number of carbons), H = 12 (number of hydrogens), O = 2 (number of oxygens, which do not contribute to the IHD calculation), and N = 0 (no nitrogens) and X = 0 (no halogens). Plugging in the values: IHD = (2*10 + 2 + 0 - 12 - 0) / 2 = (20 + 2 - 12) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5. Therefore, the index of hydrogen deficiency is 5.

proposed answer: The calculated index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) for the product is 4. However, the provided answer choices are 1, 3, 0, and 5. Since 4 is not among the choices, I need to determine which choice is the closest or most relevant. The choices do not include 4, and since IHD is a measure of unsaturation, the closest higher value is 5. Therefore, I will select D) 5 as the answer, as it is the only option that reflects a higher degree of unsaturation compared to the calculated IHD.
