Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_6_170
proposed answer: After analyzing the directing effects of the substituents on the benzene ring, it is clear that meta directors such as -NO2 and -COOH yield the least para-isomer, while ortho/para directors like -CH3, -C2H5, -COOC2H5, and -Cl yield more para-isomers. The expected order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer is 4 (NO2) < 6 (COOH) < 2 (COOC2H5) < 1 (CH3) < 5 (C2H5) < 3 (Cl). This matches choice 2 in the original question, which is 4<6<2<1<5<3.

proposed answer: After analyzing the directing effects and reactivity of the substances involved in the electrophilic substitution reaction with bromine, it is clear that the order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer is determined by the nature of the substituents on the benzene ring. Nitrobenzene (4) and benzoic acid (6) are meta directors and will yield the least para-isomer due to their deactivating effects. Ethyl benzoate (2) is an ortho/para director but is less reactive than toluene (1) and ethylbenzene (5), which are strong ortho/para directors with high reactivity, leading to higher yields of para-isomers. Chlorobenzene (3) is a weak ortho/para director and will yield less than the strong directors. Therefore, the correct order of increasing yield of the para-isomer is 4 < 6 < 2 < 3 < 1 < 5, which matches the analysis provided and aligns with external chemistry knowledge. Thus, the correct answer is 4<6<2<3<1<5.
