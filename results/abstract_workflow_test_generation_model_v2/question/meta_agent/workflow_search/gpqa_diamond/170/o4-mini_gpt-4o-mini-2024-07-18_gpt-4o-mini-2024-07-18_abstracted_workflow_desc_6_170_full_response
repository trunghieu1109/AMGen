Electron-donating groups (EDGs) such as methyl (C6H5-CH3) and ethyl (C6H5-C2H5) increase the electron density of the ring, favoring electrophilic attack at the ortho and para positions, which leads to higher yields of para isomers. Ethoxy (C6H5-COOC2H5) is a moderate EDG and would also favor para substitution but to a lesser extent than the alkyl groups. Chlorine (C6H5-Cl) is a weak EDG that can direct to ortho and para positions but also has a strong inductive withdrawing effect, leading to lower yields of para isomers compared to strong EDGs. On the other hand, nitro (C6H5-NO2) and carboxylic acid (C6H5-COOH) are strong electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) that deactivate the ring and predominantly direct electrophiles to the meta position, resulting in lower yields of para products.

On the contrary, nitro (C6H5-NO2) and carboxylic acid (C6H5-COOH) are strong electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) that deactivate the ring, leading to lower yields of para isomers. Therefore, the order based on the strength of the substituents in influencing para selectivity is 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3, where 4 and 6 being EWGs yield the least para isomers, followed by the moderate EDG 2, and the stronger EDGs 1 and 5 yielding more, with 3 yielding the most due to its weakly activating nature.

Based on the analysis from Sub-task 4, the order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-bromo isomer is determined by considering the effects of each substituent: Nitro (C6H5-NO2) is a strong EWG, leading to the lowest para yield. Carboxylic acid (C6H5-COOH) is also an EWG but slightly less influential than nitro, hence it follows. Ethoxy (C6H5-COOC2H5) is a moderate EDG, allowing for some para yield, followed by methyl (C6H5-CH3) and ethyl (C6H5-C2H5) which are strong EDGs that favor para substitution. Chlorine (C6H5-Cl) is a weak EDG but can still lead to para substitution due to its directing effects.
