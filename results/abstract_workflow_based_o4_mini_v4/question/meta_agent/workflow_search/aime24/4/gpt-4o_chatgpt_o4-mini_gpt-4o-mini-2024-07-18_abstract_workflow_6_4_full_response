Testing p=17 (the first prime ≡1 mod8), we find 2^4+1=17 (so 17|n^4+1) and by Hensel’s lemma there is a lift n≡155 mod289 giving 289|n^4+1. Thus p=17 works and no smaller p≡1 mod8 does.; answer: 17\nCoT-SC agent 4kLG, thinking: We need the least prime p≡1 mod8 for which there is n with n^4≡−1 mod\u2009p and 4n^3≠0 mod\u2009p so that Hensel’s lemma lifts to p^2. The smallest prime ≡1 mod8 is 17. We have 2^4=16≡−1 mod17 and 4·2^3=32≠0 mod17, so by Hensel’s lemma there is n mod289 with n^4≡−1, hence 17^2 divides n^4+1. Thus p=17.; answer: 17\nCoT-SC agent Ej4H, thinking: We need the smallest prime p ≡ 1 mod 8 for which -1 is a quartic residue, and thus p^2 ∣ n^4+1 for some n by Hensel’s lemma. The smallest such prime is 17.; answer: 17\nReflexion CoT agent FkIz, thinking: We need to find all m such that m^4+1≡0 mod17^2. First solve m^4≡−1 mod17: testing shows m≡2,8,9,15 mod17. Since f′(m)=4m^3≠0 mod17 for these, each lifts uniquely to mod289 by Hensel’s lemma. Writing m=a+17t and solving 4a^3·17t+(a^4+1)≡0 mod289 gives t mod17. Carrying this out yields lifts m≡42,151,155,264 mod289. Thus these 4 residue classes are all solutions, and the least positive m is 42.; answer: For p=17, m^4+1≡0 mod289 if and only if m≡2,8,9,15 mod17.  By Hensel’s lemma these lift uniquely to m≡42,151,155,264 mod289, so the least positive solution is 42.\nCritic agent mG7z, feedback: The Hensel lift in the worked solution is done incorrectly for a=8. They took (a^4+1)/17≡1 mod17, but in fact 8^4+1=4097 gives (4097/17)=241≡3 mod17. Solving 4a^3·k + (f(a)/17)≡0 mod17 with f′(8)=2048≡8 yields k≡6, so m=8+6·17=110. Checking shows 110^4+1≡0 mod289. Hence the minimal positive root is m=110, not 42.; correct: The least positive integer m with m^4+1 divisible by 17^2=289 is m=110.\nReflexion CoT agent FkIz, refining thinking: To analyze m^4+1≡0 mod17^2 we first solve m^4≡−1 mod17. Testing gives m≡2,8,9,15 mod17. For each a in {2,8,9,15}, write m=a+17k and apply Hensel’s lemma: we need f(a)/17 + f′(a)·k ≡0 mod17, where f(a)=a^4+1 and f′(a)=4a^3.

For each a, write m=a+17k and use Hensel’s lemma: f(a)=a^4+1, f′(a)=4a^3. We require f(a)/17 + f′(a)·k ≡0 mod17, solve for k. Computation yields:\n a=2: k≡10→m=2+10·17=172 (≡155 mod289)\n a=8: k≡6 →m=8+6·17=110\n a=9: k≡10→m=9+10·17=179\n a=15:k≡7 →m=15+7·17=134\n Thus the four solutions mod289 are m≡110,134,155,179 and the least positive m is 110.; answer: The solutions of m^4+1≡0 mod17^2 are m≡110,134,155,179 mod289, and the least positive m is 110.\nCritic agent mG7z, feedback: The Hensel-lifting step has errors for a=2 and a=15. For a=2 one finds 1+15k≡0 mod17 ⇒k≡9 (not 10), so m=2+9·17=155. For a=15 one finds 14+2k≡0⇒k≡10 (not 7), so m=15+10·17=185.
