    <pre>Related original question:

Let $p$ be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $n^4+1$ is divisible by $p^2$. Find the least positive integer $m$ such that $m^4+1$ is divisible by $p^2$.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 1: Determine the condition for divisibility of n^4 + 1 by p^2. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent 3cWF:
To have p^2∣(n^4+1) one must first have p∣(n^4+1), i.e. n^4≡−1 mod p.  Moreover Hensel’s lemma lifts this to mod p^2 provided f′(n)=4n^3≠0 mod p (so p∤n).  Finally −1 is a fourth power mod p exactly when p≡1 mod 8.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent 3cWF:
The necessary and sufficient condition is:
(1) n^4≡−1 (mod p),
(2) p∤n (so that f′(n)=4n^3≠0 mod p),
which forces −1 to be a quartic residue mod p, i.e. p≡1 mod 8.

### Sub-task 2: Identify the least prime number p satisfying the condition from subtask 1. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent Ej4H:
We need the smallest prime p ≡ 1 mod 8 for which -1 is a quartic residue, and thus p^2 ∣ n^4+1 for some n by Hensel’s lemma. The smallest such prime is 17.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent Ej4H:
17

### Sub-task 3: Analyze the divisibility condition m^4 + 1 ≡ 0 mod p^2 for the identified prime p. 

 ### thinking #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent FkIz:
First solve m^4 ≡ –1 mod 17 by testing m = 0,…,16 to find m ≡ 2,8,9,15 mod17. For each a in {2,8,9,15}, write m = a + 17k and apply Hensel’s lemma. Compute f(a) = a^4+1 and f′(a) = 4a^3, then solve (f(a)/17) + f′(a)·k ≡ 0 mod17 for k. This gives lifts m ≡ 155,110,179,134 mod289. Ordering these yields the least positive solution m = 110.

### answer #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent FkIz:
The solutions of m^4+1≡0 mod17^2 are m≡110,134,155,179 mod289, and the least positive m is 110.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Determine the least positive integer m satisfying the condition from subtask 3.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
