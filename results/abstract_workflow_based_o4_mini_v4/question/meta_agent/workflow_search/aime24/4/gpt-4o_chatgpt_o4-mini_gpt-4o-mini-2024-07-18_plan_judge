Question: Let $p$ be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $n^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$. Find the least positive integer $m$ such that $m^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$.
Iteration: abstract_workflow_2_4
proposed answer: Both previous reasoning steps using Hensel’s lemma and enumeration of solutions modulo 17^2 agree that the smallest positive m satisfying m^4 + 1 ≡ 0 mod 289 is 110.
