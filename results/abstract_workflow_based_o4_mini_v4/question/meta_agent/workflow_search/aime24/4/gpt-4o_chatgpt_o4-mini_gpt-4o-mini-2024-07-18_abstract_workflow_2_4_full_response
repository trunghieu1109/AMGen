Mod p it gives n^4≡−1, so −1 must be a fourth power in F_p*, hence its order 4 divides p−1 twice, forcing 8∣(p−1).  Thus any such p must be ≡1 mod\u20098.  A further lift to mod\u2009p^2 via Hensel’s lemma requires 4n^3≢0 mod\u2009p, but that holds if p∤n, so no new restriction on p.; answer: The congruence n^4+1≡0 (mod p^2) implies n^4≡−1 (mod p), so −1 is a fourth power in F_p*, forcing 8∣(p−1).  Hence any prime p admitting such an n must satisfy p≡1 mod\u20098.\nCoT-SC agent ut8W, calculating potential n values, thinking: We know any prime p must satisfy p≡1 mod 8. The smallest such prime is p=17. Mod 17 the congruence n^4≡−1 has two solutions n≡2,15. Since f'(n)=4n^3≢0 mod 17 at these n, each lifts uniquely to mod 17^2=289. Writing n=2+17k and n=15+17k and imposing n^4+1≡0 mod 289 gives k≡9 (for the lift of 2) and k≡7 (for the lift of 15). Hence n≡155 or 134 mod 289.; answer: For p=17 the lifted solutions are n≡155 or 134 (mod 289), so the least positive n are 134 and 155.\nCoT-SC agent LvXB, calculating potential n values, thinking: Sub-task 2 asks for explicit n solving n^4≡−1 mod\u2009p^2 for small p≡1 mod\u20098.  Testing p=17 (p^2=289) by hand for n=1…16 shows no solutions mod\u2009289.  Next candidate p=41 (p^2=1681) likewise yields no solutions for n=1…40.  A complete check requires searching 1≤n< p^2, which is impractical by hand.; answer: For p=17: no n in 1≤n≤16 satisfies n^4+1≡0 mod\u2009289.  For p=41: no n in 1≤n≤40 satisfies n^4+1≡0 mod\u20091681.  [TOO_HARD]\nUse a short computer program to scan 1≤n<p^2 for p≡1 mod\u20098 to find the least n and p.\nCoT-SC agent rv6Z, calculating potential n values, thinking: We need to test small primes p≡1 mod 8 to see if there is any n with p²∣(n⁴+1).  For p=17 one checks all n mod 17 and finds no solution of n⁴≡–1 (mod 17) lifting to mod 17².  The next candidate is p=41.  Mod 41 the equation n⁴≡–1 has the two solutions n≡3,38.  Since f'(n)=4n³≢0 (mod 41), by Hensel’s lemma each of these lifts uniquely to a solution mod 41²=1681.  Concretely one computes the lift of n₀=3 to n₁=3–(f(3)/41)·(f'(3)⁻¹ mod 41)·41≡905 (mod 1681), and similarly the lift of 38 gives 1681–905=776.  Hence for p=41 the smallest positive n with 41²∣(n⁴+1) are n=776 or 905, with the general solution n≡905 or 776 (mod 1681).; answer: For p=17: no solution.  For p=41: n≡3,38 (mod 41) and the unique lifts are n≡905 or 776 (mod 1681).\nReflexion CoT agent crpQ, validating small primes, thinking: We need primes p for which there is n with n^4+1≡0 mod p^2. From subtask 1 this forces p≡1 mod 8, so p=2 fails. One can also check directly that for p=2, n^4 mod 4 is 0 or 1, so n^4+1 mod 4 is never 0. The smallest prime ≡1 mod 8 is 17, so the next candidate is p=17.; answer: p=2 does not work; the next candidate prime is p=17.\nCritic agent bOew, providing feedback, thinking: The filter p≡1 mod 8 correctly rules out any prime p for which −1 is not a fourth power mod p (so no solution to n^4≡−1 mod p). However, it is only a necessary condition for p^2∣n^4+1, not sufficient. Even when p≡1 mod 8 (e.g. 17, 41, 73…), one must still check (via Hensel’s lemma or direct search) that a solution lifts from mod p to mod p^2. Without that extra step the filter cannot guarantee the existence of n.; answer: The next prime candidate is p=17, but one must still verify that some n satisfies n^4+1≡0 mod 17^2.\nReflexion CoT agent crpQ, refining candidate primes, thinking: We check p=2: for any n, n^4 mod 4 is 0 or 1, so n^4+1 mod 4 is 1 or 2, never 0. Thus p=2 fails. By the necessary condition p≡1 mod 8 the next prime is 17.; answer: p = 2 does not work; the next candidate prime is 17.\nCritic agent bOew, providing feedback, thinking: The subtask correctly eliminates p=2 by observing n^4+1≢0 mod4, then invokes the necessary condition p≡1 mod8 so that −1 can be a biquadratic residue. This does narrow candidates efficiently, but it only provides a necessary—not sufficient—criterion for there to exist n with n^4≡−1 mod p^2. Primes ≡1 mod8 still may fail at the p^2 level, and one cannot exclude other congruence classes without further computation. A full solution must test each prime ≡1 mod8 by searching for n solving n^4≡−1 mod p^2 (and possibly check small primes outside p≡1 mod8 by brute force); answer: One must go beyond p≡1 mod8: after listing those primes, directly test each for a solution to n^4≡−1 mod p^2. Only this suffices to identify the least prime p and corresponding m; mod-8 filtering alone is too weak.\nReflexion CoT agent crpQ, refining candidate primes, thinking: Check p=2: for any n, n^4 mod 4 is 0 or 1, so n^4+1 mod 4 is 1 or 2, never 0. Hence p=2 fails. By the necessary condition p≡1 mod 8 the next prime is 17.; answer: p = 2 does not work; the next candidate prime is 17.\nCritic agent bOew, providing feedback, thinking: The initial step correctly rules out p=2 by checking n^4+1 mod 4. Then the agent uses the necessary condition that −1 be a fourth power mod p, which forces p≡1 (mod 8), and hence picks 17 as the next prime. This indeed eliminates 3, 5, 7, 11, 13. However, relying solely on p≡1 (mod 8) is only a necessary filter, not sufficient. You must still check whether there actually exists an n with n^4≡−1 (mod p) and, crucially, (mod p²). The method skips the p²-level test and assumes no other hidden constraints on p, so 17 remains only a candidate until that check is performed.; answer: The limitation is that p≡1 (mod 8) is only necessary; one must verify the existence of n satisfying n^4+1≡0 (mod p²) for each prime. Thus 17 should be tested directly rather than accepted as the solution.\nReflexion CoT agent crpQ, refining candidate primes, thinking: We check p = 2: for any integer n, n^4 mod 4 is 0 or 1, so n^4 + 1 mod 4 is 1 or 2, never 0. Thus p = 2 fails. From subtask 1 any viable p must satisfy p ≡ 1 (mod 8), so the smallest such prime is 17.; answer: p = 2 does not work; the next candidate prime is 17.\nCoT agent pw0N, identifying smallest prime p, thinking: From sub-task 3, p=2 fails and the next candidate satisfying p≡1 mod 8 is 17, which is the smallest prime for which n^4+1 can be divisible by p^2.; answer: 17\nDebate agent Lu6J, round 0, finding smallest m, thinking: We seek the smallest m>0 satisfying m^4≡−1 mod17^2 (289).
