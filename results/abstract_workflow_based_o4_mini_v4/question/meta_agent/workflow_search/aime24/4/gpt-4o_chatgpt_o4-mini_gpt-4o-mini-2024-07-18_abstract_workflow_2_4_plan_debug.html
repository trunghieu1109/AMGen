    <pre>Related original question:

Let $p$ be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $n^4+1$ is divisible by $p^2$. Find the least positive integer $m$ such that $m^4+1$ is divisible by $p^2$.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 5: Based on the identified prime p, find the smallest positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2. 

 ### thinking #3 by Debate Agent Lu6J:
We need to solve m^4≡−1 mod17^2. First find solutions mod17: m^4≡−1 mod17 gives m≡2,8,9,15. Lift each to mod289 using Hensel’s lemma: for m0=2 → m=155; m0=8 → m=110; m0=9 → m=179; m0=15 → m=151. The smallest positive m is 110.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent ydQT:
We must solve m^4≡−1 mod 17^2. First find m mod 17: m≡2,8,9,15. Applying Hensel lifting to each root modulo 17 gives m=155 (from 2), 110 (from 8), 179 (from 9), and 151 (from 15). The smallest positive m is 110.

### answer #3 by Debate Agent Lu6J:
110

### answer #3 by Debate Agent ydQT:
110

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 5: Make final decision on m.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
