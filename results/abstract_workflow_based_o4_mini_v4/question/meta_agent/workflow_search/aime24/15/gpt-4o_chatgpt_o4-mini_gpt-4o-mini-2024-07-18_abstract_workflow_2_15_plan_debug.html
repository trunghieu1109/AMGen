    <pre>Related original question:

Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things..

### Sub-task 6: Determine number of residents who own all four items using intersections and data from two and three-item owners. 

 ### thinking #3 by Debate Agent WHeG:
Let n_k be number owning exactly k of the four items. Total item‐ownerships =195+367+562+900=2024 =n_1+2n_2+3n_3+4n_4. We know n_2=437 and n_3=234. Also n_1+n_2+n_3+n_4=900, but we can substitute directly: 2024 =n_1+2·437+3·234+4n_4 =n_1+874+702+4n_4. Also n_1=900−(437+234+n_4)=229−n_4. So 2024 =(229−n_4)+1576+4n_4=1805+3n_4 ⇒3n_4=219 ⇒n_4=73.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent Vyu0:
Let n_k be the number of residents owning exactly k of the four items. The total number of item-ownerships is 195+367+562+900=2024, which equals n_1+2n_2+3n_3+4n_4. We know n_2=437 and n_3=234, and n_1+n_2+n_3+n_4=900. Substitute into the sum: (900–n_2–n_3–n_4)+2n_2+3n_3+4n_4=2024 ⇒900+ n_2+2n_3+3n_4=2024 ⇒900+437+468+3n_4=2024 ⇒1805+3n_4=2024 ⇒3n_4=219 ⇒n_4=73.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Make final decision on deducing ownership of all items.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
