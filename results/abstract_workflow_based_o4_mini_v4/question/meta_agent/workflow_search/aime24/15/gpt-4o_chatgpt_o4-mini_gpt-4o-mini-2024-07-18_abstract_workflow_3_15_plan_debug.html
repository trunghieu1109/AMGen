    <pre>Related original question:

Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things..

### Sub-task 5: Aggregate numbers to ensure consistency in residents owning one, two, or three items and derive those owning all four. 

 ### thinking by Debate Agent TTcs:
We use the counts of exactly 1, 2, 3, and 4 items among 900 residents. Let E1, E2, E3, E4 be the numbers owning exactly 1, 2, 3, and 4 items. We know E2 = 437 and E3 = 234. Every resident owns candy, so sum of owned items = 195 + 367 + 562 + 900 = 2024 = E1 + 2E2 + 3E3 + 4E4. Also E1 + E2 + E3 + E4 = 900, giving E1 = 900 - 437 - 234 - E4 = 229 - E4. Substitute into the total-sum equation: 2024 = (229 - E4) + 2·437 + 3·234 + 4E4 = 1805 + 3E4, so 3E4 = 219 and E4 = 73.

### thinking by Debate Agent 0oN5:
We know every resident owns candy, so sum of sizes =195+367+562+900=2024. Let E1+E2+E3+E4=900 with E2=437, E3=234. Also 2024 = E1+2E2+3E3+4E4. From total residents E1 = 900−E2−E3−E4 = 229−E4. Substitute: 2024 = (229−E4) + 2·437 + 3·234 + 4E4 = 1805 + 3E4, so 3E4 = 219, giving E4 = 73.

    <pre>We use the total number of owned items: 195 + 367 + 562 + 900 = 2024, and let E1, E2, E3, E4 be counts of residents owning exactly 1, 2, 3, and 4 items. Given E2 = 437 and E3 = 234, and E1 + E2 + E3 + E4 = 900, so E1 = 229 - E4. The sum of owned items also equals E1 + 2E2 + 3E3 + 4E4 = 2024. Substituting yields 2024 = (229 - E4) + 2*437 + 3*234 + 4E4 = 1805 + 3E4, so 3E4 = 219 and E4 = 73.
