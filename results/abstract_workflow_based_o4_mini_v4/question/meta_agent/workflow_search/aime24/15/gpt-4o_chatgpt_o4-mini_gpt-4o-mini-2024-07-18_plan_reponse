        "response": "We use the total number of owned items: 195 + 367 + 562 + 900 = 2024, and let E1, E2, E3, E4 be counts of residents owning exactly 1, 2, 3, and 4 items. Given E2 = 437 and E3 = 234, and E1 + E2 + E3 + E4 = 900, so E1 = 229 - E4. The sum of owned items also equals E1 + 2E2 + 3E3 + 4E4 = 2024. Substituting yields 2024 = (229 - E4) + 2*437 + 3*234 + 4E4 = 1805 + 3E4, so 3E4 = 219 and E4 = 73.\n\nAnswer:73",
