    <pre>Related original question:

Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfracmn$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 6: Express the difference r_i - r_o as a fraction in simplest form, and find the sum of the numerator and denominator. 

 ### thinking #3 by Debate Agent 5dCK:
The difference r_i–r_o involves r_i, which depends on the torus’s axis orientation when it rests on the sphere. That orientation (tilt or axis direction) has not been specified, so r_i cannot be determined numerically and thus m+n cannot be found.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent C4wM:
The inner tangent circle radius r_i depends on how the torus’s axis is oriented when it rests on the sphere, which has not been specified. Without that geometric detail, we cannot compute a numeric value for r_i and thus cannot determine r_i–r_o or the sum m+n.

### answer #3 by Debate Agent 5dCK:
r_i - r_o = r_i - \tfrac{111}{19}
[TOO_HARD]
Please specify the torus’s axis orientation (tilt or axis direction) when resting on the sphere to determine r_i.

### answer #3 by Debate Agent C4wM:
[TOO_HARD]
Please specify the torus’s axis orientation (tilt or axis direction) when resting on the sphere to determine r_i.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Make final decision on expressing difference as a fraction and calculating the sum of its parts.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>To find r_i and r_o, position the torus axis first vertically, with sphere center on that axis below the torus center at distance D.  Minimizing the distance from the sphere center to the torus gives D=2√7 and the contact occurs at φ with cosφ=6/8, yielding r_i=6+3·(3/4)=33/4.  Next, position the torus axis horizontally, with the sphere center on that axis at distance D′.  Minimizing gives D′=4√10 and contact at φ with sinφ=−3/7, yielding r_o=6+3·(−3/7)=33/7.  Thus r_i–r_o=33/4−33/7=99/28, so m+n=99+28=127.
