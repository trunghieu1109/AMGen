    <pre>Related original question:

Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfracmn$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 6: Compute the difference r_i - r_o using results from Sub-tasks 4 and 5. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent uUdZ:
We found from sub-tasks 4 and 5 that r_i = 33/4 and r_o = 33/4, so their difference is 0.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent uUdZ:
0

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 7: Express the result from Sub-task 6 as a fraction m/n and compute m+n, where m and n are coprime positive integers.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>Since the difference r_i - r_o computed in Sub-task 6 is 0, we express this as the fraction 0/1 with m=0 and n=1. Hence m+n=1.
