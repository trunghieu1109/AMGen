Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: To find r_i and r_o, position the torus axis first vertically, with sphere center on that axis below the torus center at distance D.  Minimizing the distance from the sphere center to the torus gives D=2√7 and the contact occurs at φ with cosφ=6/8, yielding r_i=6+3·(3/4)=33/4.  Next, position the torus axis horizontally, with the sphere center on that axis at distance D′.  Minimizing gives D′=4√10 and contact at φ with sinφ=−3/7, yielding r_o=6+3·(−3/7)=33/7.  Thus r_i–r_o=33/4−33/7=99/28, so m+n=99+28=127.

proposed answer: Since the difference r_i - r_o computed in Sub-task 6 is 0, we express this as the fraction 0/1 with m=0 and n=1. Hence m+n=1.
