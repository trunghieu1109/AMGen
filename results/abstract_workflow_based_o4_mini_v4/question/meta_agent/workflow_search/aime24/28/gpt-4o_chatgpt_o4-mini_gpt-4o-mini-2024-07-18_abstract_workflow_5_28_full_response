Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

I will state its major/minor radii, symmetry, implicit Cartesian equation, and parametric equations.; answer: For the torus T obtained by revolving a circle of radius r=3 whose center is distance R=6 from the axis, we have:\n\n1. Major radius: R=6 (distance from torus center to center of tube)  \n2. Minor radius: r=3 (radius of the generating circle)  \n3.

A sphere of radius R centered at (h,k,l) is given by (x−h)^2+(y−k)^2+(z−l)^2=R^2.  Here R=11, and if we place the center at the origin for simplicity, the equation becomes x^2+y^2+z^2=121.; answer: Sphere S is the set of all points in ℝ^3 at distance 11 from its center.  Geometrically, it is a 2‐dimensional surface in 3‐space of constant curvature.  If we place its center at the origin (0,0,0), its equation is\nx^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 121.\nReflexion CoT agent cbR6, determining tangency conditions, thinking: To find external tangency we must have at the circle of contact (1) the point lies on both surfaces, and (2) their normals agree.  Placing the sphere center at the origin and shifting the torus tube‐center to z=h, we write ρ=√(x²+y²).  Then:\n\n1. Sphere:   ρ²+z²=121\n2. Torus:   (ρ−6)²+(z−h)²=9\n3. Normal‐matching:  ∇[(ρ−6)²+(z−h)²] ∥ ∇[ρ²+z²]  ⇒  (ρ−6)/ρ = (z−h)/z\n\nThese three equations are the necessary and sufficient conditions for external tangency.; answer: The conditions for external tangency are that at the circle of contact (with radius ρ in the plane z):\n\n1. ρ² + z² = 121   (point lies on the sphere),\n2. (ρ − 6)² + (z − h)² = 9   (point lies on the torus shifted by h along z),\n3. (ρ − 6)/ρ = (z − h)/z   (surface normals agree).\n\nEquivalently one may solve these three simultaneous equations for ρ, z, and h.\nCritic agent Xb0R, feedback on tangency conditions, thinking: The proposed conditions correctly capture external tangency: the contact point must lie on both the sphere (ρ²+z²=121) and the torus ((ρ−6)²+(z−h)²=9), and matching normals yield (ρ−6)/ρ=(z−h)/z).; answer: ρ²+z²=121; (ρ−6)²+(z−h)²=9; (ρ−6)/ρ=(z−h)/z\nReflexion CoT agent cbR6, refining tangency conditions, thinking: We use cylindrical coordinates (ρ,θ,z). External tangency requires the contact point lie on both surfaces and normals coincide. The sphere centered at the origin gives ρ²+z²=11², the torus with tube center at z=h gives (ρ−6)²+(z−h)²=3², and parallel normals yield proportional gradients, i.e. (ρ−6)/ρ=(z−h)/z.; answer: 1. ρ² + z² = 121  \n2. (ρ − 6)² + (z − h)² = 9  \n3. (ρ − 6)/ρ = (z − h)/z\nCritic agent Xb0R, feedback on tangency conditions, thinking: The three equations correctly encode the external‐tangency constraints: (1) ρ²+z²=121 forces the contact point onto the sphere of radius 11; (2) (ρ−6)²+(z−h)²=9 forces it onto the radius‐3 generating circle of the torus; (3) (ρ−6)/ρ=(z−h)/z enforces that the sphere’s normal (ρ,z) is parallel to the torus’s normal (ρ−6,z−h).  To finish, one must choose the sign of h for the “upper” and “lower” contacts and solve this system for (ρ,z) to obtain ρ=r_o and ρ=r_i.; answer: Yes—the stated equations are the correct tangency conditions.\nReflexion CoT agent cbR6, refining tangency conditions, thinking: The question asks to state the necessary and sufficient equations that a point on the torus and sphere must satisfy in order to be an external tangency point.  We place the sphere of radius 11 at the origin and describe the torus (major radius 6, minor radius 3) whose tube‐center line is shifted vertically by h.  In cylindrical coordinates (ρ,θ,z), the contact circle has some radius ρ at height z.  External tangency requires (1) the point lies on the sphere, (2) on the torus, and (3) their normals are parallel.  These yield three scalar equations in ρ, z, and h.; answer: Using cylindrical coordinates (ρ,θ,z), with the sphere centered at (0,0,0) and the torus tube‐center at (ρ=6,z=h), the external tangency conditions are:\n1. ρ² + z² = 11²                 (point lies on the sphere)\n2. (ρ − 6)² + (z − h)² = 3²      (point lies on the torus)\n3. (ρ − 6)/ρ = (z − h)/z         (sphere and torus normals are parallel)\nCritic agent Xb0R, feedback on tangency conditions, thinking: The three equations you’ve given are exactly the necessary and sufficient conditions for an external tangency circle:\n1. ρ² + z² = 11² ensures the point lies on the sphere of radius 11.\n2. (ρ − 6)² + (z − h)² = 3² ensures the point lies on the torus tube of minor radius 3 centered at (ρ=6, z=h).\n3. (ρ−6)/ρ = (z−h)/z enforces that the sphere’s normal vector (ρ, z) is parallel to the torus’s normal ((ρ−6), (z−h)).\nAll three together fully characterize the external tangency.; answer: yes\nReflexion CoT agent cbR6, refining tangency conditions, thinking: To find the locus of external tangency between torus T (major radius R=6, minor radius r=3) and sphere S (radius 11) centered at the origin, place both in cylindrical coordinates (ρ,θ,z).  A contact circle lies at some (ρ,z), common to both surfaces, and their normals must coincide.  The sphere equation is ρ²+z²=11²; the torus (with tube‐center line at ρ=6, z=h) is (ρ−6)²+(z−h)²=3²; parallel normals give ∇(sphere) ∥ ∇(torus), i.e. (ρ,z) ∥ (ρ−6, z−h), so (ρ−6)/ρ = (z−h)/z.; answer: The necessary and sufficient conditions for external tangency are:\n1. ρ² + z² = 11²\n2. (ρ − 6)² + (z − h)² = 3²\n3. (ρ − 6)/ρ = (z − h)/z\nCoT agent u9Yw, calculating internal tangency radius, thinking: We solve simultaneous equations for external tangency between torus (major radius 6, minor radius 3, center height H) and sphere radius 11. Normal alignment gives z = (H/6)ρ, sphere gives ρ²=4356/(H²+36), torus gives two solutions for H²: 28 or 160, yielding ρ=33/4 or 33/7. The larger is the internal‐tangency circle radius r_i = 33/4.; answer: 33/4\nCoT agent Fopn, calculating external tangency radius, thinking: We set up equations for a point of external tangency in cylindrical coordinates (ρ,z) and the tube-center height h: \n1) Sphere: ρ²+z²=11²\n2) Torus: (ρ−6)²+(z−h)²=3²\n3) Normals parallel: (ρ−6)/ρ=(z−h)/z\nFrom 3) we get h=6z/ρ.
