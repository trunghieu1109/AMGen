Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.",

        "response": "To find r_i and r_o, position the torus axis first vertically, with sphere center on that axis below the torus center at distance D.  Minimizing the distance from the sphere center to the torus gives D=2\u221a7 and the contact occurs at \u03c6 with cos\u03c6=6/8, yielding r_i=6+3\u00b7(3/4)=33/4.  Next, position the torus axis horizontally, with the sphere center on that axis at distance D\u2032.  Minimizing gives D\u2032=4\u221a10 and contact at \u03c6 with sin\u03c6=\u22123/7, yielding r_o=6+3\u00b7(\u22123/7)=33/7.  Thus r_i\u2013r_o=33/4\u221233/7=99/28, so m+n=99+28=127.\n\nAnswer:127",
