    <pre>Related original question:

Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overlineAD$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\fracmn$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 6: Calculate the specific values of m and n using the simplified expression for AP, ensuring they are relatively prime. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent xjw8:
From the derived expression AP = 100/13 and the requirement that m and n be relatively prime, we directly read off m = 100 and n = 13.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent xjw8:
m = 100, n = 13

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 7: Add m and n to find the final result.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
