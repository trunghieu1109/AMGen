Question: Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.
Iteration: abstract_workflow_2_20
proposed answer: We require 2^r−2>10⇒r≥4. The smallest m=b−1 with 4 distinct prime factors is 2·3·5·7=210, hence b=210+1=211.

proposed answer: A known result shows the count of b-beautiful integers is 2^{ω(b−1)}–1, where ω(m) is the number of distinct prime factors of m. To exceed 10 we need 2^{ω(b−1)}>11 ⇒ ω(b−1)≥4. The smallest integer with 4 distinct prime factors is 2·3·5·7=210, so b−1=210 ⇒ b=211.
