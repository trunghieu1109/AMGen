Question: Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.

Its value in base 10 is n=bx+y, and the sum of its base‐b digits is x+y.; answer: For each x in 1…b−1 and y in 0…b−1, the two-digit number is n = b·x + y and its digit sum is x + y.\nReflexion CoT agent 6Gk3, comparing sqrt to digit sum, thinking: We have general two‐digit base‐b numbers n=bx+y with 1≤x≤b−1, 0≤y≤b−1. Then √n=√(bx+y).  Compare this to the digit sum S=x+y:\nCompute (x+y)^2−n = x^2+2xy+y^2 −(bx+y) = x^2 +2xy +y^2 −bx −y.  One checks this is always ≥0 for b≥2, x≥1, y≥0, with equality exactly when bx+y is a perfect square. Hence √n ≤ x+y, and √n = x+y precisely in the “beautiful” (square) cases.; answer: For each two‐digit number n in base b of the form n=bx+y, we have\n√n = √(bx+y)\nand the sum of digits S = x+y.  One finds\n(x+y)^2 − n = x^2 +2xy +y^2 − (bx+y) ≥ 0\nfor all b≥2, 1≤x≤b−1, 0≤y≤b−1, with equality exactly when bx+y is a perfect square.  Therefore:\n• √n < x+y whenever n is not a perfect square.\n• √n = x+y precisely when n is a perfect square (the b-beautiful cases).  \nCritic agent ahnt, providing feedback, thinking: The derivation that (x+y)^2−(bx+y)≥0 with equality iff bx+y is a perfect square is correct. There are no algebraic mistakes in showing √n≤x+y and equality characterizes the two‐digit squares in base b.; answer: The chain‐of‐thought is correct: b‐beautiful numbers are exactly the two‐digit base‐b perfect squares, with √n=x+y holding precisely for those squares.\nReflexion CoT agent 6Gk3, refining comparison, thinking: We verify the algebra: For n=bx+y with 1≤x≤b−1, 0≤y≤b−1, (x+y)^2−n = x^2+2xy+y^2−(bx+y) = (x−y)^2 + (2xy−bx) = (x−y)^2 + x(2y−b). Since y≤b−1, 2y−b ≤ b−2, and both terms are nonnegative for b≥2. Thus (x+y)^2 ≥ n with equality exactly when n is a perfect square. Hence √n≤x+y, equality iff n is square.; answer: For each two‐digit base-b number n=bx+y:\n• √n = √(bx+y)\n• Digit sum S = x+y\nOne finds always √n ≤ S, with equality (√n = S) precisely when n is a perfect square.\nCritic agent ahnt, providing feedback, thinking: The algebraic step is incorrect. Starting with n=bx+y, one has\n (x+y)^2−n = x^2+2xy+y^2−bx−y,\nbut the proposed decomposition\n (x−y)^2 + x(2y−b)\n expands to x^2+y^2−bx, missing the “−y” term. Hence you cannot conclude (x+y)^2 ≥ n in general, nor that √n ≤ x+y always holds.; answer: The correct identity is\n (x+y)^2 − n = x^2+2xy+y^2 − bx − y.\nTo assess its sign you must check x^2+2xy+y^2 ≥ bx+y case by case; equality occurs precisely when bx+y is a perfect square, but there is no blanket inequality √n≤x+y for all two‐digit base-b numbers.\nReflexion CoT agent 6Gk3, refining comparison, thinking: For a two‐digit base‐b number with digits x (1≤x≤b−1) and y (0≤y≤b−1), we have\nn = b·x + y,\n√n = √(b x + y),\ndigit sum S = x + y.\nTo compare √n and S, consider Δ = (x+y)^2 − n = x^2 + 2xy + y^2 − (b x + y).\nIf Δ>0 then √n < S; if Δ=0 then √n = S (n is a perfect square); if Δ<0 then √n > S.; answer: For each two‐digit base-b number n=b x+y with 1≤x≤b−1, 0≤y≤b−1:\n• √n = √(b x + y)\n• Digit sum S = x + y\n• Compare via Δ = (x+y)^2 − (b x + y):\n   – If Δ>0 then √n < S\n   – If Δ=0 then √n = S (n is a perfect square)\n   – If Δ<0 then √n > S\nCritic agent ahnt, providing feedback, thinking: The derivation is correct. For n=bx+y and S=x+y, setting Δ=(x+y)²−(bx+y) gives Δ>0⇔S²>n⇔S>√n, Δ=0⇔S²=n⇔S=√n, and Δ<0⇔S²<n⇔S<√n, matching the stated conclusions.; answer: The calculation is correct; no discrepancies found.\nReflexion CoT agent 6Gk3, refining comparison, thinking: We consider a general two-digit base-b number with digits x (1 ≤ x ≤ b−1) and y (0 ≤ y ≤ b−1). Its value is n = b·x + y and its digit sum is S = x + y. To compare √n and S, compute Δ = (x + y)² − (b·x + y). Then Δ > 0 ⇔ (x + y)² > n ⇔ S > √n, Δ = 0 ⇔ S = √n, and Δ < 0 ⇔ S < √n.; answer: For each two-digit base-b number n = b·x + y (1 ≤ x ≤ b−1, 0 ≤ y ≤ b−1):\n• √n = √(b·x + y)\n• Digit sum S = x + y\n• Let Δ = (x + y)² − (b·x + y)\n  – If Δ > 0 then √n < S\n  – If Δ = 0 then √n = S\n  – If Δ < 0 then √n > S\nCoT agent XEx1, counting b-beautiful numbers, thinking: We need to count all two‐digit base‐b numbers n=bx+y whose digit sum S=x+y equals √n.  Setting S^2=n gives S^2=bx+y ⇒ S^2−S=(b−1)x ⇒ x=S(S−1)/(b−1).  We then require x integer in [1,b−1] and y=S−x in [0,b−1].  The total number is the count of all integer S for which these divisibility and bound conditions hold.; answer: For any integer b≥2, the number of b-beautiful integers equals the number of integer S in [1,2(b−1)] such that (b−1) divides S(S−1) and, setting x=S(S−1)/(b−1), one has 1≤x≤b−1 and 0≤S−x≤b−1.\nDebate agent w3Q9, round 0, identifying least b, thinking: We need two‐digit base-b numbers n=b x+y with digit sum S=x+y satisfying S^2=n.  This gives S^2−S=(b−1)x so x=S(S−1)/(b−1) must be integer 1≤x≤b−1 and y=S−x in [0,b−1].  Equivalently S(S−1)≡0 mod\u2009m where m=b−1, and x≤m forces S≤m.  The number of S in [2,m] with S(S−1)≡0 mod\u2009m equals the number of solutions to S≡0 or 1 mod\u2009p^e for each prime dividing m, minus the trivial S=0,1.  There are 2^r solutions mod\u2009m if m has r distinct prime factors, giving 2^r−2 valid S in [2,m].  We want 2^r−2>10 ⇒2^r>12 ⇒r≥4.  The smallest m with 4 distinct primes is 2·3·5·7=210, so b=m+1=211.; answer: 211\nDebate agent 8SnR, round 0, identifying least b, thinking: We reduce the count of b-beautiful numbers to the number of solutions to D=b−1 dividing S(S−1) with S(S−1)/D in [1,D] and S≥(1+√(1+4D))/2.  One finds the total assignments for prime‐powers in D is τ(D)=Π(e_i+1), giving roughly τ(D)−1 solutions before small‐S corrections.  Seeking the least D with τ(D)−1>10+O(1) leads to D=120 (τ(120)=16), so b=121.; answer: 121\nDebate agent w3Q9, round 1, identifying least b, thinking: We seek positive integers n with exactly two base-b digits x,y (n=(b−1)x+y) satisfying x+y=√n. Setting S=x+y gives S^2−S=(b−1)x so x=S(S−1)/(b−1)∈ℤ, 1≤x≤b−1, S−x=y∈[0,b−1], and S≤b−1. One finds S must satisfy S(S−1)≡0 mod\u2009m with m=b−1. Solutions mod\u2009m are given by S≡0 or 1 modulo each prime power dividing m, yielding 2^r residue classes (r=number of distinct prime factors). Excluding the trivial S=0,1 gives at most 2^r−2 valid S in [2,m], and almost all exceed the lower bound S≥(1+√(1+4m))/2 for large m. To exceed ten solutions require 2^r−2>10 ⇒2^r>12 ⇒r≥4. The smallest m with 4 distinct primes is 2·3·5·7=210, so b=m+1=211.; answer: 211\nDebate agent 8SnR, round 1, identifying least b, thinking: A two‐digit base-b number n=xb+y with x+y=S satisfies S^2=n iff S^2−S=(b−1)x, so (b−1)∣S(S−1) and x=S(S−1)/(b−1)∈[1,b−1]. Writing m=b−1 and factoring m into r distinct primes gives exactly 2^r residue classes of S mod m with S(S−1)≡0. Only the classes S≡0,1 (mod m) fail to produce a solution in the allowable S‐range [≈√m,m], so the count is 2^r−2. We need 2^r−2>10 ⇒2^r>12 ⇒r≥4.
