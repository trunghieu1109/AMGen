Question: Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.

Equivalently, b ≤ n ≤ b^2−1.; answer: A positive integer n has exactly two digits in base b if and only if b ≤ n ≤ b^2−1.\nCoT agent GWuC, determine sum condition equals sqrt(n), thinking: From sub-task 1 we have n=d₁b+d₀ with 1≤d₁≤b−1, 0≤d₀≤b−1. The requirement d₁+d₀=√n implies squaring both sides gives (d₁+d₀)²=d₁b+d₀. This is the desired condition.; answer: If n=d₁b+d₀ in base b, then b≤n≤b²−1 and the sum-of-digits condition is d₁+d₀=√n, equivalently (d₁+d₀)²=d₁b+d₀ with 1≤d₁≤b−1, 0≤d₀≤b−1.\nCoT agent 8I2d, determine how many b-beautiful numbers exist, thinking: We have n = d₁b + d₀ with 1≤d₁≤b−1, 0≤d₀≤b−1 and d₁+d₀ = s = √n.  Equivalently s(s−1)= (b−1)d₁, so b−1 divides s(s−1).  Writing m=b−1 and factoring m=∏pᵢ^{eᵢ}, for each prime pᵢ we need pᵢ^{eᵢ}|s or |(s−1), giving 2 choices per distinct prime.  By CRT there are 2^{ω(m)} residues mod m satisfying this in 0≤s<m; lifting to 1≤s≤m gives 2^{ω(m)} solutions, one of which is s=1 (d₁=0) invalid.  Hence number of valid s, and thus b-beautiful n, is 2^{ω(b−1)}−1.; answer: For each integer b≥2, the number of b−beautiful integers is 2^{ω(b−1)}−1, where ω(b−1) is the number of distinct prime factors of b−1.\nCoT agent ApQU, determine digit range, thinking: A two-digit base-b number has digits d1·b + d0 with d1≠0. Thus d1 can be any integer from 1 up to b–1, and d0 any integer from 0 up to b–1.; answer: d1∈{1,2,…,b−1}, d0∈{0,1,2,…,b−1}\nReflexion CoT agent qRkE, identifying valid combinations, thinking: We need to find all two‐digit base-b numbers n = d₁b + d₀ whose digit sum equals √n.  Writing s = d₁ + d₀, the condition d₁ + d₀ = √n becomes s² = d₁b + d₀.  Since d₀ = s − d₁, substitute to get s² = d₁b + (s − d₁) = (b−1)d₁ + s, so s(s−1) = (b−1)d₁.  Hence d₁ and d₀ must satisfy these diophantine constraints in the allowed digit ranges.; answer: All digit pairs (d₁,d₀) with 1 ≤ d₁ ≤ b−1 and 0 ≤ d₀ ≤ b−1 that satisfy (d₁ + d₀)² = b·d₁ + d₀.  Equivalently, letting s = d₁ + d₀, one must have (b−1)∣s(s−1), with d₁ = s(s−1)/(b−1) and d₀ = s − d₁.\nCritic agent 4QdM, providing feedback, thinking: The submitted answer correctly derives the necessary and sufficient condition for two‐digit base-b numbers to satisfy d₁+d₀=√n.  In particular, setting s=d₁+d₀ one obtains s²=b·d₁+d₀, which rearranges to (b−1)d₁=s(s−1).  From this it follows that (b−1) must divide s(s−1) and that\n  d₁ = s(s−1)/(b−1),  d₀ = s−d₁,\nwith the constraints 1≤d₁≤b−1 and 0≤d₀≤b−1.  This characterization captures exactly all digit pairs meeting the sum=√n condition.; answer: All valid digit pairs (d₁,d₀) are those for which (d₁+d₀)² = b·d₁ + d₀.  Equivalently, if s=d₁+d₀ then:\n  • (b−1) divides s(s−1),\n  • d₁ = s(s−1)/(b−1),\n  • d₀ = s − d₁,\nsubject to 1≤d₁≤b−1 and 0≤d₀≤b−1.\nThese are exactly the solutions to the digit‐sum equals square‐root condition in base b.\nReflexion CoT agent qRkE, refining combinations, thinking: We need all two-digit base-b numbers n=d1*b+d0 whose digit sum equals sqrt(n). Writing s=d1+d0, the condition is s^2=d1*b+d0. Substitute d0=s−d1 to get s^2=d1*b+(s−d1)=(b−1)d1+s, hence (b−1)d1=s(s−1). Thus s(s−1) must be divisible by (b−1), and then d1=s(s−1)/(b−1), d0=s−d1. Finally verify 1≤d1≤b−1, 0≤d0≤b−1.; answer: All digit pairs (d1,d0) with 1≤d1≤b−1 and 0≤d0≤b−1 satisfying (d1+d0)^2=b·d1+d0. Equivalently, let s=d1+d0; require (b−1)|s(s−1), set d1=s(s−1)/(b−1), d0=s−d1, and keep only those in the valid digit ranges.\nCritic agent 4QdM, providing feedback, thinking: To find all two-digit base-b numbers n=d1·b+d0 whose digit sum s=d1+d0 equals √n, set s²=b·d1+d0. Substituting d0=s−d1 gives s²=d1·(b−1)+s, so (b−1)·d1=s(s−1). Thus for each integer s from 1 up to 2(b−1):\n 1. Check if (b−1) divides s(s−1).\n 2. If yes, let d1 = s(s−1)/(b−1) and d0 = s−d1.\n 3. Keep the pair only if 1 ≤ d1 ≤ b−1 and 0 ≤ d0 ≤ b−1.\nAll such (d1,d0) exactly describe the b-beautiful two-digit numbers.; answer: All valid digit pairs are those for which s=d1+d0 and (b−1) divides s(s−1), with d1=s(s−1)/(b−1) and d0=s−d1 satisfying 1≤d1≤b−1, 0≤d0≤b−1; these are precisely the solutions of (d1+d0)²=b·d1+d0.\nReflexion CoT agent qRkE, refining combinations, thinking: We derive that for a two‐digit base-b number n=d₁·b+d₀ with digit sum s=d₁+d₀ to equal √n, one must have s²=d₁b+d₀.  Substituting d₀=s−d₁ gives s²=(b−1)d₁+s, so (b−1)d₁=s(s−1).  Hence s(s−1) must be divisible by b−1, and then d₁ and d₀ are determined.  We then enforce the digit bounds.; answer: All pairs (d₁,d₀) with 1≤d₁≤b−1 and 0≤d₀≤b−1 that satisfy (d₁+d₀)²=b·d₁+d₀.  Equivalently, letting s=d₁+d₀:  \n1. s runs over integers from 1 to 2(b−1).\n2.

It cleanly reduces the problem to checking divisibility by (b−1) and then verifying digit bounds.; answer: All valid digit pairs (d₁,d₀) in base b are found by:\n1. Let s=d₁+d₀, with 1≤s≤2(b−1).\n2. Require (b−1)∣s(s−1).\n3. Compute d₁=s(s−1)/(b−1) and d₀=s−d₁.\n4.

Substituting s=d₁+d₀ gives (b−1)d₁=s(s−1).  Hence s(s−1) must be divisible by b−1, and then the digits are determined by d₁=s(s−1)/(b−1) and d₀=s−d₁, with the usual digit bounds.; answer: All digit pairs (d₁,d₀) satisfying:\n1. Let s=d₁+d₀, where 1≤s≤2(b−1).\n2.

Without a bound on b or a specified range, we cannot list them exhaustively. A finite approach requires either fixing b or imposing an upper limit. Thus the problem as stated is too broad for a complete explicit enumeration.; answer: For each valid digit pair (d₁,d₀) in base b, the corresponding integer is n = d₁·b + d₀.\n[TOO_HARD]\nPlease specify a finite range of bases (e.g. b≤B) or a specific base b to enumerate the values of n.\nDebate agent N1Kp, round 2, calculating n values, thinking: Sub-task 6 as stated asks for an explicit enumeration of all b–beautiful numbers for every integer base b≥2.
