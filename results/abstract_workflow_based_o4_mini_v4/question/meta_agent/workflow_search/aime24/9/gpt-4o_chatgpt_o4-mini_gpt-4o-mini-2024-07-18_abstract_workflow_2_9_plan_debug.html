    <pre>Related original question:

Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfracmn$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$..

### Make final decision on conditional probability calculations. 

 ### thinking by Final Decision Agent FW2H:
Both solutions correctly compute the total outcomes C(10,4)=210, the prize‐winning outcomes 115, and the grand‐prize outcomes 1. Hence the conditional probability is (1/210)/(115/210)=1/115.

### answer by Final Decision Agent FW2H:
1/115

Given the above, answer the following question: Express the probability as a fraction m/n and compute m+n.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>Total lottery outcomes C(10,4)=210. Prize outcomes (≥2 matches): C(4,2)C(6,2)+C(4,3)C(6,1)+C(4,4)C(6,0)=90+24+1=115. Grand‐prize outcomes=1. Conditional probability=(1/210)/(115/210)=1/115 so m=1,n=115 and m+n=116.
