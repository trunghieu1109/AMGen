Question: Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

A draw wins if it matches k of her 4 numbers with k≥2. For each k, there are C(4,k) ways to choose the matching numbers and C(6,4−k) ways to choose the rest from the other 6. Sum for k=2,3,4: C(4,2)·C(6,2)+C(4,3)·C(6,1)+C(4,4)·C(6,0)=6·15+4·6+1·1=115.; answer: 115\nCoT-SC agent VyTZ, calculating ways for win condition, thinking: We count the number of 4-number draws that share at least 2 numbers with Jen’s fixed 4.
