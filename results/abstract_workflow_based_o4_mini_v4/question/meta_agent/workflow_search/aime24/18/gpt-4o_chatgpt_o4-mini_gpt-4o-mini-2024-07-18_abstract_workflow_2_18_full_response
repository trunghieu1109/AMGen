Question: Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). Then \(OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\).

Its slope is (√3/2−0)/(0−1/2)=−√3, so the point‐slope form at A gives y−0=−√3(x−1/2), i.e. y=−√3 x+√3/2.; answer: y = -√3 x + √3/2\nCoT-SC agent 3WET, verifying family of segments PQ, thinking: We need to describe all unit‐length segments with one endpoint on the x‐axis and the other on the y‐axis.  If P=(x,0) and Q=(0,y), the distance PQ=√(x²+y²)=1 forces x²+y²=1 with x,y≥0.  Equivalently parametrize by θ∈[0,π/2] so that P=(cosθ,0), Q=(0,sinθ).; answer: The family ℱ consists exactly of the segments joining P=(x,0) to Q=(0,y) where x²+y²=1 and x,y≥0.  Equivalently, for θ∈[0,π/2], P=(cosθ,0), Q=(0,sinθ), and PQ has length 1.\nCoT-SC agent 1APL, verifying family of segments PQ, thinking: To describe all unit‐length segments with endpoints on the axes in the first quadrant, set P=(x,0), Q=(0,y). The distance constraint is √[(x−0)²+(0−y)²]=1 ⇒ x²+y²=1 with x,y≥0. One can parameterize by an angle θ∈[0,π/2]: P=(cosθ,0), Q=(0,sinθ).; answer: The family F consists exactly of those segments joining P=(x,0) to Q=(0,y) in the first quadrant satisfying x² + y² = 1.

The distance requirement is √(p²+q²)=1, so p²+q²=1 with p,q≥0. Equivalently use the parameter θ∈[0,π/2]: P=(cosθ,0), Q=(0,sinθ).; answer: The family ℱ consists of all segments \nP=(p,0), Q=(0,q) with p²+q²=1 and p,q≥0.

The unique point C on the line AB: y=−√3x+√3/2 that also lies on the astroid satisfies x=cos³θ, y=sin³θ, θ=60°, giving C=(cos³60°, sin³60°)=(1/8,3√3/8).; answer: C = \\bigl(1/8,\\,3\\sqrt3/8\\bigr)\nCritic agent oHzp, feedback on point C identification, thinking: The solution correctly identifies that the envelope of the family of chords is the astroid x^{2/3}+y^{2/3}=1 and finds its intersection with line AB (y=−√3 x+√3/2).

Intersecting this with line AB: y = -√3 x + √3/2, we solve x^{2/3}+(-√3 x + √3/2)^{2/3}=1.
