Line OA through O and A lies on the x-axis, so y=0. Line OB through O and B lies on the y-axis, so x=0. Segment AB has slope (√3/2−0)/(0−1/2)=−√3, passing through A gives y=−√3(x−1/2), i.e. y=−√3x+√3/2.; answer: Line OA: y=0.  Line OB: x=0.  Line AB: y=−√3 x + √3/2.\nCoT agent 34yg, define constraints for segments in F, thinking: Endpoints P and Q lie on the axes so write P=(x,0), Q=(0,y) with x>0, y>0 (first quadrant). The segment length is 1, so by the distance formula: √((x−0)²+(0−y)²)=1 ⇒ x²+y²=1.; answer: The family F consists of all segments with endpoints P=(x,0) and Q=(0,y) where x>0, y>0, and x²+y²=1.\nReflexion CoT agent hjD6, find condition for point C, thinking: To lie on another segment P=(x,0) to Q=(0,y) of length 1 in F, C=(x_c,y_c) must satisfy for some y in (y_c,1): (x_c y/(y–y_c))^2 + y^2 =1.  This equation already has the root y=√3/2 coming from AB.  Requiring it to have no other root forces that root to be double: f′(√3/2)=0.  Solving yields x_c=1/8, y_c=3√3/8, i.e. C divides AB in a 3:1 ratio from A.  Hence the unique point C is (1/8,3√3/8), and no other segment in F passes through it.; answer: A point C on AB is on no other unit‐segment of F ⇔ the intersection equation has a double root at y=√3/2 ⇔ f′(√3/2)=0 ⇔ C=(1/8,3√3/8).\nCritic agent a7wt, feedback on point C condition, thinking: The derivation correctly shows that requiring the intersection equation f(y)=\\bigl(x_c y/(y−y_c)\\bigr)^2+y^2−1 to have its only (real) root at y=√3/2 and for that root to be of multiplicity two (i.e. f(√3/2)=0 and f′(√3/2)=0) is both necessary and sufficient to prevent any other unit segment in ℱ from passing through C. Imposing the double‐root condition yields C=(1/8,3√3/8) on AB.; answer: Condition: f(y)=((x_c y)/(y−y_c))^2+y^2−1 must satisfy f(√3/2)=0 and f′(√3/2)=0, which forces C to divide AB in a 3:1 ratio from A, i.e. C=(1/8,3√3/8). Limitations: we must have 0<y_c<√3/2 so that the denominator in f is positive and the domain y>y_c contains √3/2; the double‐root test only applies when C lies strictly between A and B (endpoints give trivial intersections).\nReflexion CoT agent hjD6, refine condition for point C, thinking: A point C=(x_c,y_c) on AB lies on another segment P=(x,0) to Q=(0,y) of length 1 exactly when the equation f(y)=(x_c y/(y−y_c))^2+y^2−1=0 has a root y≠√3/2 in (0,1). To forbid any other intersections, the only root y=√3/2 must be of multiplicity two, so f(√3/2)=0 and f′(√3/2)=0.; answer: C must satisfy that the intersection equation f(y)=(x_c y/(y−y_c))^2+y^2−1 has y=√3/2 as a double root; equivalently f(√3/2)=0 and f′(√3/2)=0.\nCritic agent a7wt, feedback on point C condition, thinking: The condition f(y)=(x_c y/(y−y_c))^2 + y^2 −1 has y=√3/2 as a double root is correct: one imposes f(√3/2)=0 and f′(√3/2)=0.  In addition you must enforce that C lies strictly between A and B on the line AB (so 0<x_c<1/2, 0<y_c<√3/2) and that there are no other real roots of f(y) in (0,∞), ensuring no other unit–length segment in ℱ passes through C.; answer: C on AB must satisfy f(√3/2)=0 and f′(√3/2)=0, with 0<x_c<½, 0<y_c<√3/2 to guarantee uniqueness and exclusion of endpoints.\nReflexion CoT agent hjD6, refine condition for point C, thinking: To ensure C on AB lies on no other unit segment in F, any intersection equation f(y) for a segment from P=(x,0) to Q=(0,y) must have its only solution y=√3/2 come from AB and be of multiplicity two.  That prevents any distinct y∈(0,1) giving another segment through C.; answer: C=(x_c,y_c) on AB lies on no other segment in F ⇔ the equation f(y)=(x_c·y/(y−y_c))²+y²−1 has y=√3/2 as a double root.  Equivalently f(√3/2)=0 and f′(√3/2)=0, with (x_c,y_c) strictly between A and B on AB.\nCritic agent a7wt, feedback on point C condition, thinking: The necessary and sufficient test is that C=(x_c,y_c) on AB satisfy the “double‐root” condition for the intersection equation of a generic segment P=(x,0) to Q=(0,y) with unit length.  Writing f(y) = (x_c·y/(y−y_c))^2 + y^2 −1, one requires f(√3/2)=0 and f′(√3/2)=0, and additionally that C lie strictly between A and B on AB.  Limitations: this derivation assumes y≠y_c (so the formula remains valid), restricts P and Q to the first–quadrant axes (0≤x≤1, 0≤y≤1), and further assumes no other real roots y≥0 arise from f.; answer: C must lie on AB, so y_c=√3(½−x_c), and satisfy f(√3/2)=0, f′(√3/2)=0 with 0<x_c<½ and 0<y_c<√3/2.  Equivalently the intersection multiplicity at y=√3/2 is two, ruling out any distinct segment in 𝓕 passing through C.\nReflexion CoT agent hjD6, refine condition for point C, thinking: To prevent any other unit‐length segment P=(x,0) to Q=(0,y) in ℱ from passing through C=(x_c,y_c), the intersection condition in y must have its only solution y=√3/2 occur with multiplicity two.  Writing f(y)=(x_c·y/(y−y_c))^2 + y^2 −1, requiring f(√3/2)=0 and f′(√3/2)=0 ensures no distinct y∈(0,1) gives another segment through C.  Additionally C must lie strictly between A and B on AB.; answer: A point C=(x_c,y_c) on AB is on no other segment in ℱ except AB if and only if the equation f(y)=(x_c·y/(y−y_c))^2 + y^2 −1 has y=√3/2 as a double root.  Equivalently, one imposes\n1) f(√3/2)=0,\n2) f′(√3/2)=0,\nand C lies strictly between A and B on the line AB.\nReflexion CoT agent hKGP, calculate coordinates for C, thinking: Parameterize C on AB by C=((1–t)/2, t·√3/2).  The double‐root condition f′(√3/2)=0 gives 4(√3/2)^2(1–t)=t ⇒3(1–t)=t⇒t=3/4.  Hence x_C=(1–3/4)/2=1/8, y_C=(3/4)(√3/2)=3√3/8.; answer: C = \\bigl(\\tfrac18,\\tfrac{3\\sqrt3}{8}\\bigr)\nCritic agent J74y, feedback on C coordinates, thinking: The derivation is sound. Parameterizing C on AB and applying the tangency (double‐root) condition correctly yields t=3/4, giving x_C=(1–3/4)/2=1/8 and y_C=(3/4)(√3/2)=3√3/8. Thus the coordinates are correct.; answer: C = (1/8, 3√3/8)\nReflexion CoT agent hKGP, refine C coordinates, thinking: We parametrize C on AB by C=((1−t)/2, t√3/2). The double‐root (tangency) condition yields t=3/4, so x_C=(1−3/4)/2=1/8 and y_C=(3/4)(√3/2)=3√3/8.; answer: C = (1/8, 3√3/8)\nCritic agent J74y, feedback on C coordinates, thinking: The coordinates C = (1/8, 3√3/8) are correct.; answer: C = (1/8, 3√3/8)\nReflexion CoT agent hKGP, refine C coordinates, thinking: We parametrize point C on line AB by C=((1−t)/2, t·√3/2). Imposing the double‐root (tangency) condition yields t=3/4, which gives x_C=(1−3/4)/2=1/8 and y_C=(3/4)(√3/2)=3√3/8.; answer: C = (1/8, 3√3/8)\nCritic agent J74y, feedback on C coordinates, thinking: The coordinates C=(1/8,3√3/8) correctly lie on segment AB and satisfy the required tangency condition, so they are accurate.; answer: Yes, the coordinates are correct.\nReflexion CoT agent hKGP, refine C coordinates, thinking: We parameterize point C on segment AB by C=((1−t)/2, t·√3/2).
