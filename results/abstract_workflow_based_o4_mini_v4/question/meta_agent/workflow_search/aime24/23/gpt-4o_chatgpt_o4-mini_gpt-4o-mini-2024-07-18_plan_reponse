The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$.\n\\[\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \\hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\\\ \\hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\\\ \\hline \\end{array}\\]",

        "response": "From the row\u2010sum 999 and column\u2010sum 99 conditions we obtain digit\u2010wise a+d=9, b+e=9, c+f=9 and a+b+c=8. Every nonnegative triple (a,b,c) with sum 8 and each \u22649 yields a unique grid, so there are C(8+3\u22121,2)=45 valid configurations.\n\nAnswer:All 45 valid configurations are given parametrically by first row = (a,b,c) and second row = (9\u2212a,9\u2212b,9\u2212c), where a,b,c are nonnegative digits with a+b+c=8.",
