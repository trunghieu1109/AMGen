Question: Find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid so that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is $999$, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is $99$. The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$.
\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\ \hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\ \hline \end{array}\]
Iteration: abstract_workflow_2_23
proposed answer: From the row‐sum 999 and column‐sum 99 conditions we obtain digit‐wise a+d=9, b+e=9, c+f=9 and a+b+c=8. Every nonnegative triple (a,b,c) with sum 8 and each ≤9 yields a unique grid, so there are C(8+3−1,2)=45 valid configurations.

Answer:All 45 valid configurations are given parametrically by first row = (a,b,c) and second row = (9−a,9−b,9−c), where a,b,c are nonnegative digits with a+b+c=8.
Extracted answer: All 45 valid configurations are given parametrically by first row = (a,b,c) and second row = (9−a,9−b,9−c), where a,b,c are nonnegative digits with a+b+c=8.
Correct answer: 045
