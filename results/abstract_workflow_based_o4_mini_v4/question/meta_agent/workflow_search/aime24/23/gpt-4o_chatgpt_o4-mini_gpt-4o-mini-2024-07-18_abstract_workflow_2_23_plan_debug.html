    <pre>Related original question:

Find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid so that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is $999$, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is $99$. The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$.
\[\beginarray|c|c|c| \hline 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 8 \\ \hline 9 &amp; 9 &amp; 1 \\ \hline \endarray\].

### Sub-task 4: Determine all unique valid configurations where both the row-wise and column-wise sums hold true simultaneously. 

 ### thinking #3 by Debate Agent K8ei:
From the row‐sum and column‐sum conditions we get a+d=9, b+e=9, c+f=9 and a+b+c=8. Hence choosing any nonnegative digits a,b,c summing to 8 determines a unique grid by setting d=9−a, e=9−b, f=9−c. There are C(8+3−1,2)=45 such triples, and thus 45 valid configurations.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent q6GO:
From the row‐sum 999 and column‐sum 99 conditions we get digit‐wise a+d=9, b+e=9, c+f=9 and a+b+c=8. Every nonnegative triple (a,b,c) with a+b+c=8 and 0≤a,b,c≤9 yields a valid grid by setting the first row to (a,b,c) and the second row to (9−a,9−b,9−c). There are C(8+3−1,2)=45 such triples.

### answer #3 by Debate Agent K8ei:
All valid configurations are given by: First row = (a,b,c), second row = (9−a,9−b,9−c), where a,b,c are digits with a+b+c=8. There are 45 such configurations.

### answer #3 by Debate Agent q6GO:
All 45 valid configurations are given parametrically: first row = (a,b,c), second row = (9−a,9−b,9−c) for every nonnegative integer triple (a,b,c) with a+b+c=8.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Make final decision on valid grid configurations.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
