    <pre>Related original question:

Find the largest possible real part of \[(75+117i)z+\frac96+144iz\]where $z$ is a complex number with $|z|=4$.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 7: Calculate the maximum value for real part and find z achieving it. 

 ### thinking #3 by Debate Agent Edvq:
We rewrite the expression as Re((75+117i)z + 9/6 + 144i z) = Re((75+261i)z) + 3/2. For |z|=4, the maximum of Re((a+bi)z) is 4√(a²+b²), achieved when z points in the direction of the conjugate of a+bi. Here a=75, b=261, so the maximum real part is 4√(75²+261²)+3/2, and the maximizing z is 4(75−261i)/√(75²+261²).

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent btzD:
We have f(z)=Re((75+117i)z + 9/6 + 144i z) = Re((75+261i)z)+3/2. For |z|=4, the maximum of Re((a+bi)z) is 4√(a^2+b^2) attained when z points along the conjugate of a+bi. Here a=75, b=261, so max f = 4√(75^2+261^2) + 3/2 and the maximizing z is 4(75-261i)/√(75^2+261^2).

### answer #3 by Debate Agent Edvq:
Maximum value = 4√73746 + 3/2; maximizing z = 4(75 − 261i)/√73746

### answer #3 by Debate Agent btzD:
Maximum real part = 4√73746 + 3/2, achieved at z = 4(75 − 261i)/√73746

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 7: Make final decision on max value and corresponding z.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>We combine terms to get (75+261i)z + 3/2. The maximum of Re((a+bi)z) for |z|=4 is 4√(a^2+b^2), here a=75, b=261, giving 4√73746. Adding 3/2 yields the max real part. The maximizer z points in the direction of the conjugate of 75+261i, i.e. z = 4(75−261i)/√73746.

Answer:Maximum real part = 4√73746 + 3/2, achieved at z = 4(75−261i)/√73746</pre>
