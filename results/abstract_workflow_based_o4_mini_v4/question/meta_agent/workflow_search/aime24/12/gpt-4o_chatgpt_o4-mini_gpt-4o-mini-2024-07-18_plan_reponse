The maximum of A cos\u03b8 + B sin\u03b8 is \u221a(A\u00b2+B\u00b2), here \u221a(300\u00b2+1044\u00b2)=12\u221a8194. Thus the maximum real part is 12\u221a8194 + 3/2.\n\nAnswer:12\u221a8194 + 3/2",

The maximizer z points in the direction of the conjugate of 75+261i, i.e. z = 4(75\u2212261i)/\u221a73746.\n\nAnswer:Maximum real part = 4\u221a73746 + 3/2, achieved at z = 4(75\u2212261i)/\u221a73746",
