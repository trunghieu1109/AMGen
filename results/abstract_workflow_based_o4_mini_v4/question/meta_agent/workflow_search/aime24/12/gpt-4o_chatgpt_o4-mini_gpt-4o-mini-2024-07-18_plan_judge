Question: Find the largest possible real part of \[(75+117i)z+\frac{96+144i}{z}\]where $z$ is a complex number with $|z|=4$.
Iteration: abstract_workflow_2_12
proposed answer: We combine (75+117i)z and 144i z to get (75+261i)z. With |z|=4 and z=4e^{iθ}, the real part is R(θ)=300 cosθ−1044 sinθ+3/2. The maximum of A cosθ + B sinθ is √(A²+B²), here √(300²+1044²)=12√8194. Thus the maximum real part is 12√8194 + 3/2.

Answer:12√8194 + 3/2
Extracted answer: 12√8194 + 3/2
Correct answer: 540
Question: Find the largest possible real part of \[(75+117i)z+\frac{96+144i}{z}\]where $z$ is a complex number with $|z|=4$.
Iteration: abstract_workflow_5_12
proposed answer: We combine terms to get (75+261i)z + 3/2. The maximum of Re((a+bi)z) for |z|=4 is 4√(a^2+b^2), here a=75, b=261, giving 4√73746. Adding 3/2 yields the max real part. The maximizer z points in the direction of the conjugate of 75+261i, i.e. z = 4(75−261i)/√73746.

Answer:Maximum real part = 4√73746 + 3/2, achieved at z = 4(75−261i)/√73746
Extracted answer: Maximum real part = 4√73746 + 3/2, achieved at z = 4(75−261i)/√73746
Correct answer: 540
