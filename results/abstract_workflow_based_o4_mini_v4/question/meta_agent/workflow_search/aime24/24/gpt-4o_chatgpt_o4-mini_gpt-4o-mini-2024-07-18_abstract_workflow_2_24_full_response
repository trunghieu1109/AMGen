Then multiply all three to get 1/(xyz)=2^{1/2+1/3+1/4}=2^{13/12}, so xyz=2^{-13/12}.  Finally substitute back into the first to obtain x^2=(x/(yz))·(xyz)=2^{1/2}·2^{-13/12}=2^{-7/12}.; answer: Converted system: 1) x/(yz)=2^{1/2}, 2) y/(xz)=2^{1/3}, 3) z/(xy)=2^{1/4}.  From multiplying: xyz=2^{-13/12}.  From the first: x^2=2^{-7/12}.\nCoT-SC agent Zjuk, solving for variable expressions, thinking: From Subtask 1 we have x/(yz)=2^{1/2}, y/(xz)=2^{1/3}, z/(xy)=2^{1/4}.  Set x=2^a, y=2^b, z=2^c.  Then\na−b−c=1/2,\nb−a−c=1/3,\nc−a−b=1/4\nand a+b+c=−13/12.  Introduce a parameter t by letting a=t; then b=t−1/12 and c=t−1/8.
