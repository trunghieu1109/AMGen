        "response": "The problem of a convex equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel is equivalent to an affine image of a regular hexagon. In such a configuration the triangle formed by the lines containing every second side (AB, CD, EF) has side lengths proportional to the hexagon\u2019s side. Matching this to a 200\u2013240\u2013300 triangle yields a unique scale factor giving s=100.\n\nAnswer:100",
