Question: Let ABCDEF be a convex equilateral hexagon in which all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle whose sides are extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. Find the side length of the hexagon.
Iteration: abstract_workflow_1_25
proposed answer: The problem of a convex equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel is equivalent to an affine image of a regular hexagon. In such a configuration the triangle formed by the lines containing every second side (AB, CD, EF) has side lengths proportional to the hexagon’s side. Matching this to a 200–240–300 triangle yields a unique scale factor giving s=100.

Iteration: abstract_workflow_2_25
proposed answer: Using the affine‐map argument one shows s = abc√3/(12A), where A = √[p(p–a)(p–b)(p–c)] with a=200,b=240,c=300 and p=370.  Numerically A≈23924.8 so s≈(200·240·300·√3)/(12·23924.8)≈86.9, hence s=87.
