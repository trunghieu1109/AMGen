    <pre>Related original question:

Let ABCDEF be a convex equilateral hexagon in which all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle whose sides are extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. Find the side length of the hexagon..

 ### thinking #3 by Debate Agent 4He5:
Model the hexagon as an affine image of a regular hexagon of side s.  In the regular case the triangle from extending AB, CD, EF has side 3s and area 9s^2√3/4.  Under the affine map with determinant Δ its sides become a,b,c and its area A = Δ·(9s^2√3/4).  Also abc = (3s)^3Δ = 27s^3Δ.  Eliminate Δ: Δ = abc/(27s^3), so
A = (abc/(27s^3))·(9s^2√3/4) = abc√3/(12s).  Hence s = abc√3/(12A).  With a=200,b=240,c=300, semiperimeter p=(a+b+c)/2=370, A=√[p(p−a)(p−b)(p−c)]=√(370·170·130·70)≈23929, giving s ≈(200·240·300·√3)/(12·23929)≈87.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent oQrq:
We can model the given hexagon as an affine image of a regular hexagon of side s.  In the regular case the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, EF has side length 3s and area (9s^2√3)/4.  Under an affine map with determinant Δ it becomes a triangle with sides a,b,c and area A=Δ·(9s^2√3)/4, and abc=(3s)^3Δ=27s^3Δ.  Eliminating Δ gives  abc=12sA/√3, so s = abc√3/(12A).  Then use Heron’s formula A=√[p(p–a)(p–b)(p–c)], p=(a+b+c)/2.

### answer #3 by Debate Agent 4He5:
s = \dfrac{abc\sqrt3}{12\sqrt{p(p-a)(p-b)(p-c)}} with a=200,b=240,c=300,p=370, A=√(370·170·130·70) ⇒ s≈87

### answer #3 by Debate Agent oQrq:
s = \frac{abc\sqrt3}{12A}, where A=\sqrt{p(p-a)(p-b)(p-c)}, p=\frac{a+b+c}{2}.  For a=200,b=240,c=300 we have p=370, A=\sqrt{370·170·130·70}\approx23924.8, hence s\approx86.9

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 5: Make final decision on hexagon side length.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>Using the affine‐map argument one shows s = abc√3/(12A), where A = √[p(p–a)(p–b)(p–c)] with a=200,b=240,c=300 and p=370.  Numerically A≈23924.8 so s≈(200·240·300·√3)/(12·23924.8)≈86.9, hence s=87.
