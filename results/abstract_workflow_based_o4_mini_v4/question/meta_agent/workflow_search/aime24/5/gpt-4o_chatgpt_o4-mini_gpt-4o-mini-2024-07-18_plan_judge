Question: Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.

proposed answer: Given r = \frac{20\sqrt{21}}{63}, we identify m=20, n=21, p=63. Their sum is 20+21+63 = 104.

proposed answer: From the inradius expression \(\tfrac{20}{3\sqrt{21}}\), we have m=20, n=21, p=3. Thus m+n+p = 20+21+3 = 44.
