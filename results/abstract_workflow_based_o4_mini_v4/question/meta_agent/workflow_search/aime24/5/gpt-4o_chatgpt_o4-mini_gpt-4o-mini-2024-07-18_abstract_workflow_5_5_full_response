This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime.

This implies it is a disphenoid (isosceles tetrahedron) whose four faces are congruent triangles. Such a tetrahedron is tangential (admits an inscribed sphere) so there is a unique point inside equidistant from all faces.; answer: The tetrahedron ABCD is a disphenoid (isosceles tetrahedron) with opposite edges equal: AB=CD=√41, AC=BD=√80, BC=AD=√89. All four faces are congruent, and the tetrahedron admits an inscribed sphere (incenter) equidistant from each face.\nCoT agent Byht, establish inradius formula, thinking: For a tetrahedron to have a point equidistant from all faces it must be tangential (i.e.\nadmit an insphere).  In that case its inradius r satisfies\n    r = 3V / (A₁ + A₂ + A₃ + A₄)\nwhere V is the volume and A_i the areas of its four faces.  Volume can be computed by\n    V = (1/6) |(AB × AC)·AD|,\nand each face area by the usual Heron’s formula.  The necessary and sufficient constraint is that the tetrahedron be tangential (equivalently here, a disphenoid with opposite edges equal).; answer: r = 3V / (A₁ + A₂ + A₃ + A₄);  the tetrahedron must be tangential (i.e.\nadmit an insphere), equivalently have an insphere if and only if it is a disphenoid with pairs of opposite edges equal.\nCoT agent ejOO, simplify radical expression, thinking: To simplify an expression of the form m/(p·√n) one rationalizes the denominator by multiplying top and bottom by √n, yielding (m·√n)/(p·n). One must also strip any square factors out of n first (so n is squarefree) and cancel any common factors between m and p.; answer: For any integers m,p,n with n squarefree and gcd(m,p)=1,\n\nm\n— = (m√n)/(p\u2009n)\np√n\n\nThat is, 1) factor n to remove any square divisors so n is squarefree, 2) cancel any common divisors of m and p, then 3) multiply numerator and denominator by √n to obtain (m√n)/(p\u2009n).\nReflexion agent 791G, calculating volume, thinking: We recognize ABCD as a disphenoid with opposite edges equal: a^2=41, b^2=80, c^2=89. A known volume formula for such tetrahedra is\nV = \\frac{1}{12}\\sqrt{4a^2b^2c^2 - a^2(b^2+c^2-a^2)^2 - b^2(c^2+a^2-b^2)^2 - c^2(a^2+b^2-c^2)^2 + (b^2+c^2-a^2)(c^2+a^2-b^2)(a^2+b^2-c^2)}.\nSubstituting A=41, B=80, C=89 yields inside the radical 409600, so V = \\frac{\\sqrt{409600}}{12} = \\frac{640}{12} = \\frac{160}{3}.; answer: 160/3\nDebate agent eut9, round 0, applying inradius formula, thinking: We have a disphenoid with opposite edges equal: a²=41, b²=80, c²=89. All four faces are congruent triangles with sides √41,√80,√89.  Volume from Sub-task 4 is V=160/3.  The area of one face by Heron (or by ¼√[2(a²b²+b²c²+c²a²)−(a⁴+b⁴+c⁴)]) gives A_face=6√21, so the total surface area ΣA=4·6√21=24√21.  Then r=3V/ΣA=3·(160/3)/(24√21)=160/(24√21)=20/(3√21)=20√21/63.; answer: Volume V = 160/3; each face area A_face = 6√21; total surface area ΣA = 24√21; hence r = 3V/ΣA = 20√21/63.\nDebate agent 1YTq, round 0, applying inradius formula, thinking: We recognize the tetrahedron as a disphenoid with opposite edges squared 41, 80, 89.  Its volume was found as V=160/3.  Each face is congruent with edge‐lengths √41,√80,√89.  Using 16K^2=2(a^2b^2+a^2c^2+b^2c^2)−(a^4+b^4+c^4) gives face area K=6√21, so total surface area A=4K=24√21.; answer: Volume = 160/3, Surface Area = 24√21\nDebate agent eut9, round 1, applying inradius formula, thinking: We have a disphenoid with opposite edges squared 41,80,89. Prior tasks gave V=160/3 and face area K=6√21. There are 4 congruent faces so ΣA=4K=24√21. These are the intermediate values for applying r=3V/ΣA.; answer: Volume V = 160/3; each face area = 6√21; total surface area = 24√21\nDebate agent 1YTq, round 1, applying inradius formula, thinking: We use the results from prior sub-tasks: the tetrahedron is a disphenoid with opposite edges √41,√80,√89. Its volume was computed via the Cayley–Menger formula (or the special disphenoid volume formula) as V=160/3. Each face is congruent with edges √41,√80,√89; by the formula 16K²=2(a²b²+b²c²+c²a²)−(a⁴+b⁴+c⁴) one finds K=6√21. There are 4 faces, so the total surface area is 4·6√21=24√21.; answer: Volume = 160/3, Surface Area = 24√21\nDebate agent eut9, round 2, applying inradius formula, thinking: Using the disphenoid properties and results from previous subtasks: the volume V was found to be 160/3. Each face, being congruent with edge-lengths √41, √80, √89, has area K = 6√21. There are 4 faces, so the total surface area is 4K = 24√21.; answer: Volume V = 160/3; each face area = 6√21; total surface area = 24√21\nDebate agent 1YTq, round 2, applying inradius formula, thinking: We already determined that the tetrahedron is a disphenoid with opposite edges √41, √80, √89. Its volume was computed as V=160/3, and each of its four congruent faces has area K=6√21, giving total surface area 4K=24√21.; answer: Volume V = 160/3; each face area = 6√21; total surface area = 24√21\nFinal Decision agent, inradius determination, thinking: We have volume V=160/3 and total surface area S=24√21. The inradius r satisfies r=3V/S. Compute 3V=160, so r=160/(24√21)=20/(3√21)=20√21/63.; answer: 3V=160; S=24√21; hence r=3V/S=160/(24√21)=20/(3√21)=20√21/63\nReflexion agent MaEp, evaluating inradius, thinking: To finalize, use r = 3V/S with V = 160/3 and S = 24√21: r = (3·(160/3)) / (24√21) = 160/(24√21) = 20/(3√21) = 20√21/63.; answer: The inradius is \\(\\frac{20\\sqrt{21}}{63}\\).\nCoT agent goyP, confirming form, thinking: We start from the result r=20√21/63. Rewrite as r=(20√21/63)·(√21/√21)=420/(63√21)=20/(3√21). Here m=20, p=3 are coprime and n=21 is squarefree.; answer: The inradius can be written as \\frac{20}{3\\sqrt{21}}, with m=20, n=21, p=3 (gcd(m,p)=1 and n squarefree).\nCoT agent 9Ifk, calculate m+n+p, thinking: From the inradius expression \\(\\tfrac{20}{3\\sqrt{21}}\\), we have m=20, n=21, p=3.
