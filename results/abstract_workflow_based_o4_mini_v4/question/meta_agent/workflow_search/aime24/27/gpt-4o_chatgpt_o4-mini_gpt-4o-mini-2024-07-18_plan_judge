Question: Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.
Iteration: abstract_workflow_1_27
proposed answer: Based on Q = 5 and R = 694 from sub-task 4, their sum is 699.

Answer:699
Extracted answer: 699
