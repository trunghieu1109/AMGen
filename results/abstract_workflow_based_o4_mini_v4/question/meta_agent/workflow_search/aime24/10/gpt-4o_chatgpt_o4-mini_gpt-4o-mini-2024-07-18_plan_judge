Question: Rectangles $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are drawn such that $D,E,C,F$ are collinear. Also, $A,D,H,G$ all lie on a circle. If $BC=16$,$AB=107$,$FG=17$, and $EF=184$, what is the length of $CE$?
Iteration: abstract_workflow_1_10
proposed answer: Given C and E lie on the horizontal line y=16 at x-coordinates 107 and 3, respectively, the distance CE is |107âˆ’3| = 104.

Answer:104
