    <pre>Related original question:

Rectangles $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are drawn such that $D,E,C,F$ are collinear. Also, $A,D,H,G$ all lie on a circle. If $BC=16$,$AB=107$,$FG=17$, and $EF=184$, what is the length of $CE$?. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 5: Calculate CE using the line equation and the position of E solved in subtask 4. 

 ### thinking #3 by Debate Agent ryAU:
C and E both lie on the horizontal line y=16 with coordinates C=(107,16) and E=(3,16), so the distance CE is the absolute difference of their x-coordinates: |107−3|=104.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent KmcZ:
C and E lie on the horizontal line y=16 at x=107 and x=3, respectively. The distance CE is |107−3| = 104.

### answer #3 by Debate Agent ryAU:
104

### answer #3 by Debate Agent KmcZ:
104

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 5: Make final decision on length of CE.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
