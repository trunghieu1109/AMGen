Question: Let $\omega\neq 1$ be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\]
is divided by 1000.
Iteration: abstract_workflow_2_19
proposed answer: The sub-task references an “intermediate product” without specifying which k-values or grouping of factors to include, making the computation of its remainder modulo 1000 impossible as stated. To proceed, the index range or divisor constraints must be clarified.

Answer:Cannot determine the remainder modulo 1000 without a clear definition of the intermediate product. [TOO_HARD]
Please specify the index range (e.g., k=0 to m) or the intended grouping of factors so the intermediate product can be evaluated modulo 1000.

is divided by 1000.
Iteration: abstract_workflow_6_19
proposed answer: We compute P=∏_{k=0}^{12}(2−2ω^k+ω^{2k}) as the resultant of x^13−1 and x^2−2x+2, whose roots are 1±i. Evaluating (1±i)^13−1 yields factors −65∓64i; their product is 8321, giving remainder 321 mod 1000.
