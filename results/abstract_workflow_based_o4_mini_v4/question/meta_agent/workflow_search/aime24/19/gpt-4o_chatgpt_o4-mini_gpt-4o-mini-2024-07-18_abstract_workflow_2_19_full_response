This is straightforward: roots are e^{2πik/13}, sum over all equals 0, sum over nontrivial equals -1.; answer: The 13th roots of unity are the 13 complex numbers ω^k = e^{2πi k/13}, for k = 0,1,2,…,12, each satisfying ω^13 = 1. They are the 13 distinct solutions of x^13 − 1 = 0. Their key summation property is:\n\nSum_{k=0 to 12} ω^k = 0.\n\nEquivalently, excluding the trivial root ω^0 = 1, one has:\n\nSum_{k=1 to 12} ω^k = −1.\nCoT-SC agent NJ4H, simplifying expression, thinking: We observe that (1 - ω^k)^2 = 1 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Hence adding 1 gives 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} = (1 - ω^k)^2 + 1.; answer: (1 - ω^k)^2 + 1\nCoT-SC agent XSTA, simplifying expression, thinking: We observe 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} = ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2. Completing the square gives ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 1 + 1 = (ω^k - 1)^2 + 1.; answer: (ω^k - 1)^2 + 1\nCoT-SC agent oWeE, simplifying expression, thinking: We interpret ω^{2k} for ω^2k. The expression is 2 − 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. We complete the square: ω^{2k} − 2ω^k + 2 = (ω^k − 1)^2 + 1. This is the simplest form using root‐of‐unity properties.; answer: 2−2ω^k+ω^{2k}=(ω^k−1)^2+1\nReflexion CoT agent mYCJ, computing intermediate product, thinking: We note ∏_{k=0}^{12}(2-2ω^k+ω^{2k})=∏_{ω^13=1}((1-ω)^2+1)=∏(1-ω-i)·∏(1-ω+i). But ∏_{ω^13=1}(a-ω)=a^13−1. Thus the product equals[(1−i)^13−1]·[(1+i)^13−1]. Since (1±i)=√2·e^{±iπ/4}, (1±i)^13=2^6·(−(1±i))=−64(1±i). Hence factors are −64(1−i)−1=−65+64i and −65−64i, whose product is (−65)^2−(64i)^2=4225+4096=8321.; answer: 8321\nCritic agent JXAe, verifying product, thinking: The chain of thought is correct. The factorisation 2−2ω^k+ω^{2k}=(1−ω^k)^2+1=(1−ω^k+i)(1−ω^k−i) allows splitting the product into ∏(1+i−ω^k)= (1+i)^13−1 and ∏(1−i−ω^k)= (1−i)^13−1. Computing (1±i)^13=−64(1±i) and subtracting 1 gives −65∓64i. Their product is (−65)^2−(64i)^2=4225+4096=8321, so the intermediate result is correct.; answer: Yes\nReflexion CoT agent mYCJ, refining product calculation, thinking: We factor each term: 2–2ω^k+ω^{2k}=(1–ω^k)^2+1=(1–ω^k+i)(1–ω^k–i). The product over k of (a–ω^k) for ω^13=1 is a^13–1. Hence the desired product is [(1+i)^13–1]⋅[(1–i)^13–1]. Since 1±i=√2 e^{±iπ/4}, (1±i)^13=2^{6.5}e^{±i13π/4}=2^6·(−1)(1±i)=−64(1±i). Subtracting 1 gives −65∓64i. Their product is (−65)^2−(64i)^2=4225+4096=8321.; answer: 8321\nCritic agent JXAe, verifying product, thinking: The factorization (2 − 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) = (1 − ω^k)^2 + 1 = (1 − ω^k + i)(1 − ω^k − i) is valid, and using the identity ∏_{k=0}^{12}(a − ω^k) = a^{13} − 1 yields [(1 + i)^{13} − 1][(1 − i)^{13} − 1]. Computing (1 ± i)^{13} correctly gives −64(1 ± i), so subtracting 1 yields −65 ∓ 64i, whose product is (−65 − 64i)(−65 + 64i) = 8321. All steps and the final intermediate product 8321 are correct.; answer: 8321\nReflexion CoT agent mYCJ, refining product calculation, thinking: We use the factorization 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} = (1 - ω^k)^2 + 1 = (1 - ω^k + i)(1 - ω^k - i). The product over k of (a - ω^k) for all 13th roots ω^k is a^13 - 1. Thus the desired product is [(1 + i)^13 - 1]·[(1 - i)^13 - 1]. Computing (1 ± i)^13 = -64(1 ± i) and subtracting 1 gives -65 ∓ 64i. Their product is (-65 + 64i)(-65 - 64i) = 8321.; answer: 8321\nCritic agent JXAe, verifying product, thinking: The factorization 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} = (1 - ω^k)^2 + 1 and its split into (1 - ω^k + i)(1 - ω^k - i) is valid. Using ∏_{k=0}^{12}(a - ω^k) = a^13 - 1 with a = 1 ± i gives (1 ± i)^13 - 1 = -64(1 ± i) - 1 = -65 ∓ 64i, and their product (-65 + 64i)(-65 - 64i) = 8321. All steps and the intermediate product are correct.; answer: Yes, the intermediate product is correct.\nReflexion CoT agent mYCJ, refining product calculation, thinking: We factor each term: 2–2ω^k+ω^{2k}=(1–ω^k)^2+1=(1–ω^k+i)(1–ω^k–i). The product over all 13th roots ω^k of (a−ω^k) equals a^{13}−1. Hence the desired product is [(1+i)^{13}−1]⋅[(1−i)^{13}−1]. Since (1±i)^{13}=−64(1±i), subtracting 1 gives −65∓64i, whose product is (−65+64i)(−65−64i)=8321.; answer: 8321\nReflexion CoT agent mYCJ, validating product, thinking: We have the product computed as 8321.

Taking this modulo 1000 gives 8321 ≡ 321 (mod 1000), which confirms the result under modulus 1000.; answer: 321\nCritic agent p7R3, validating modular arithmetic, thinking: The modular arithmetic check via the resultant (or by computing (1±i)^{13}−1) shows the full product is 8321, so modulo 1000 it is indeed 321.; answer: 321\nReflexion CoT agent mYCJ, refining product simplification, thinking: We have previously found the full product to be 8321. Reducing this result modulo 1000 gives 8321 ≡ 321 (mod 1000), which confirms the simplified product under the modulus.; answer: 321\nCritic agent p7R3, validating modular arithmetic, thinking: The simplification is correct: the full product equals 8321, which gives 8321 ≡ 321 (mod 1000).; answer: 321\nReflexion CoT agent mYCJ, refining product simplification, thinking: The full product equals 8321, and reducing modulo 1000 gives 8321 ≡ 321 (mod 1000), confirming the simplified product under modulus 1000.; answer: 321\nDebate agent bENz, round 0, calculating remainder, thinking: The sub-task refers to an “intermediate product” but does not specify which partial product (e.g. up to which index k or what divisor constraints).
