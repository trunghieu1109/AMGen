For points A,B,C,D on the hyperbola with diagonals meeting at O, we have A+C=0 and B+D=0, and for perpendicular diagonals AC⊥BD we get (C–A)·(D–B)=(-2A)·(-2B)=0 ⇒ A·B=0.; answer: Rhombus conditions:\n1.

Diagonals perpendicular (⇔ rhombus): AC ⟂ BD ⇒ A · B = 0.\nCoT-SC agent 0QkA, expressing rhombus conditions, thinking: We know a rhombus is a parallelogram with all sides equal, and in a parallelogram the diagonals bisect each other. Since the diagonals meet at the origin, the midpoint of each diagonal is 0, so C = –A and D = –B. That makes ABCD a parallelogram. To force it to be a rhombus, its sides must be equal, which in a parallelogram is equivalent to its diagonals being perpendicular. The diagonals are the vectors AC = –2A and BD = –2B, so they are perpendicular ⇔ A·B = 0. Together with the hyperbola constraints on A and B, these give the full geometric conditions.; answer: Let A=(x1,y1), B=(x2,y2) lie on x^2/20 – y^2/24 = 1, and set C=–A, D=–B so that the diagonals meet at the origin (midpoint at 0). Then ABCD is a parallelogram.

Diagonals bisect each other at O implies O is midpoint of AC and BD, so C=−A and D=−B. Equal sides AB, BC, CD, DA lead to |B−A|=|B+A|, which simplifies to A·B=0.; answer: Label A=(x₁,y₁), B=(x₂,y₂) on the hyperbola, and set C=−A, D=−B so the diagonals meet at the origin.

Thus BD^2=4(x_B^2+y_B^2)=4(20 sec^2φ+24 tan^2φ)=80 sec^2φ+96 tan^2φ=176 sec^2φ−96. The minimum occurs when sec^2φ=1 (φ=0), giving infimum BD^2=176−96=80.; answer: BD^2=176 sec^2φ−96, and its minimum (infimum) is 80.\nCritic agent UK3Z, providing feedback, feedback: The algebraic derivation BD²=176\u2009sec²φ−96 and its infimum 80 are arithmetically correct, but the argument stops short of ensuring that ABCD is actually a rhombus on the given hyperbola. In particular:\n1) One must exhibit points A and C on x²/20−y²/24=1 with A=−C so that diagonals meet at the origin, then enforce AB=BC (the rhombus side‐length condition). This constraint may restrict φ or alter the extremum.\n2) At φ=0 one gets B=(±2√5,0) and A=(0,±2√6), which indeed yields equal sides but gives a rectangle (all angles 90°), a degenerate rhombus case. The derivation never checks angle or side‐length equality beyond BD.\n3) No finite maximum of BD² exists (as φ→π/2 BD²→∞), so only the infimum is meaningful.\n\nWithout incorporating the full rhombus constraints, the optimization is incomplete.; correct: To complete the solution, after parametrizing B=(2√5\u2009sec\u2009φ,2√6\u2009tan\u2009φ) and D=−B, introduce A=(2√5\u2009sec\u2009ψ,2√6\u2009tan\u2009ψ) and C=−A. Impose AB=BC to link φ and ψ, solve that system on the hyperbola, then substitute back into BD² and re‐optimize under the true rhombus constraint. This guarantees a valid ABCD and yields the correct bound BD²≥80.\nReflexion CoT agent WAsJ, refining BD^2 optimization, thinking: The BD^2 expression follows from B=(2√5\u2009secφ,2√6\u2009tanφ) and D=−B, so BD^2=4(20\u2009sec^2φ+24\u2009tan^2φ)=176\u2009sec^2φ−96. Since sec^2φ≥1, the infimum is 80 at φ=0. However, ensuring ABCD is a rhombus requires the side‐length condition AB=BC or full parallelogram constraints, which may affect the extremum and is not yet enforced.; answer: BD^2 = 176 sec^2 φ − 96, with infimum 80.\n[TOO_HARD]\nPlease incorporate the rhombus side‐length condition (e.g., AB=BC) or full parallelogram constraints to verify and refine this extremum.\nCritic agent UK3Z, providing feedback, feedback: The expression BD^2 = 176\u2009sec^2φ − 96 correctly gives the squared length of diagonal BD for points B and D = ±B on the hyperbola, but it wholly omits the rhombus side‐length constraint (AB = BC) or full parallelogram conditions. As a result, the infimum of 80 at φ = 0 corresponds to a degenerate “rhombus” (B and D collapsing onto the transverse axis) and is not guaranteed to be valid for a nondegenerate rhombus. A genuine extremum under the rhombus condition requires solving AB^2 = BC^2 (and similarly for the other sides), which introduces additional equations and may shift the bound away from 80.; correct: [TOO_HARD]\nPlease supply or derive the explicit relation (e.g. coordinates or parametrization) that enforces AB = BC (and thus the full rhombus conditions). With that additional information we can incorporate the side‐length constraint and compute the true maximal lower bound of BD^2.\nReflexion CoT agent WAsJ, refining BD^2 optimization, thinking: We derived BD^2 = 4(|B|^2) = 4(20\u2009sec^2φ + 24\u2009tan^2φ) = 176\u2009sec^2φ − 96 and observed its infimum is 80 at φ=0. However, this ignores the rhombus side‐length condition (AB = BC) which may alter the valid range of φ and shift the true minimum. Without enforcing AB = BC (and the full parallelogram constraints), the bound 80 corresponds to a degenerate case and cannot be guaranteed for a nondegenerate rhombus.; answer: BD^2 = 176\u2009sec^2φ − 96, with infimum 80\n[TOO_HARD]\nTo refine this bound under the nondegenerate rhombus constraint, one must solve AB^2 = BC^2 (and analogous side‐length equalities) simultaneously with the hyperbola equations, e.g. by introducing parameters θ and φ for A and B and enforcing A + C = 0, B + D = 0, and AB^2 = BC^2.\nCritic agent UK3Z, providing feedback, feedback: The expression BD² = 176\u2009sec²φ – 96 follows from BD = 2|B| on the given hyperbola and is algebraically correct in isolation. However it ignores the rhombus condition AB = BC. As φ→0 the infimum 80 comes from a degenerate “rhombus” (all points collapsing on one branch), so no nondegenerate rhombus actually attains or approaches BD²=80.; correct: To find the true minimum of BD² one must simultaneously impose AB² = BC² (and the parallelogram centering constraints) on top of the hyperbola coordinates. This forces φ away from zero and yields a strictly larger lower bound on BD².
