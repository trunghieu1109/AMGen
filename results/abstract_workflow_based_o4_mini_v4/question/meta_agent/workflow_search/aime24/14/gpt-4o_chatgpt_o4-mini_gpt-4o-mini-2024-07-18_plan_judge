Question: Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.
Iteration: abstract_workflow_2_14
proposed answer: We have BD^2=4(x₂²+y₂²)=80+176 tan²β, with β linked to α by 5 secα secβ+6 tanα tanβ=0 ⇒ sinα sinβ=−5/6 ⇒ sin²β>25/36. Thus tan²β> (25/36)/(11/36)=25/11, giving inf BD²=80+176·(25/11)=480, not attained. So the greatest real below all BD² is 480.

Answer:BD² = 80 + 176 tan²β, and the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi is 480.
Extracted answer: BD² = 80 + 176 tan²β, and the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi is 480.
Correct answer: 480

Iteration: abstract_workflow_6_14
proposed answer: Parametrizing the rhombus on the hyperbola yields BD² = 80 + 176 tan²φ with the nondegeneracy condition tan²φ > 25/11. As φ approaches arcsin(5/6), tan²φ→25/11 and BD²→480⁺, so 480 is the supremum never attained by any nondegenerate rhombus.

Answer:480
Extracted answer: 480
Correct answer: 480
