Question: There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\times5$ grid such that: 

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.
Iteration: abstract_workflow_2_29
proposed answer: For each choice of Wr white rows and Wc white columns (0≤Wr,Wc≤5), the number of white chips is Wr×Wc≤25 and black chips is (5−Wr)×(5−Wc)≤25, so the chip‐count constraints are satisfied. The all‐chips‐in‐row and all‐chips‐in‐column same–colour condition holds by construction, and each configuration is saturated since no additional cell has matching row and column colours. There are 2^5 choices for rows and 2^5 for columns, giving 1024 valid configurations.
