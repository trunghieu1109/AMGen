Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\\times5$ grid such that: \n\neach cell contains at most one chip\nall chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour\nany additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.",

        "response": "For each choice of Wr white rows and Wc white columns (0\u2264Wr,Wc\u22645), the number of white chips is Wr\u00d7Wc\u226425 and black chips is (5\u2212Wr)\u00d7(5\u2212Wc)\u226425, so the chip\u2010count constraints are satisfied. The all\u2010chips\u2010in\u2010row and all\u2010chips\u2010in\u2010column same\u2013colour condition holds by construction, and each configuration is saturated since no additional cell has matching row and column colours. There are 2^5 choices for rows and 2^5 for columns, giving 1024 valid configurations.\n\nAnswer:1024",
