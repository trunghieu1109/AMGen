A list of positive integers has the following properties:
$\bullet$ The sum of the items in the list is $30$.
$\bullet$ The unique mode of the list is $9$.
$\bullet$ The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.
Find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list..

 ### thinking #3 by Debate Agent asEx:
We need a list of positive integers summing to 30 with unique mode 9 and median (average of middle two values) a positive integer not in the list. A 4‐element list [5,7,9,9] has sum 30, mode 9, median (7+9)/2=8 (not in list). Sum of squares =25+49+81+81=236.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent W7a4:
We need a list of positive integers summing to 30 with unique mode 9 and median a positive integer not in the list. The smallest such list is [5,7,9,9]: sum = 30, mode = 9, median = (7+9)/2 = 8 (not in list). Sum of squares = 5² + 7² + 9² + 9² = 25 + 49 + 81 + 81 = 236.

Given the above, answer the following question: Make final decision on the sum of squares.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
