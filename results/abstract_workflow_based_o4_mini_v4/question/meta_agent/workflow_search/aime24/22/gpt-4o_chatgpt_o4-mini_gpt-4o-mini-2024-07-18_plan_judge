Question: A list of positive integers has the following properties:
$\bullet$ The sum of the items in the list is $30$.
$\bullet$ The unique mode of the list is $9$.
$\bullet$ The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.
Find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.
Iteration: abstract_workflow_1_22
proposed answer: We need a list of positive integers summing to 30, with unique mode 9 and median a positive integer not in the list. The smallest such list is [5,7,9,9], giving median (7+9)/2=8 (not in the list). Sum of squares is 5²+7²+9²+9² = 25+49+81+81 = 236.

proposed answer: We need a positive integer list summing to 30 with unique mode 9 and an even number of terms so the median (average of two middle terms) is an integer not in the list. The 4-term list [5,7,9,9] satisfies these conditions: sum is 30, mode is 9, median is (7+9)/2=8 (not in the list). Sum of squares = 5²+7²+9²+9² = 25+49+81+81 = 236.
