Question: Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.

Converting t minutes to hours gives t/60. Hence walking time = 4 – t/60 hours, which must equal distance/s = 9/s hours.; answer: Aya’s walking time at speed s is 4 – t/60 hours, which equals 9/s hours.\nCoT-SC agent 9nDZ, calculating walking time at speed s+2, thinking: Convert 2 hours 24 minutes to hours: 2 + 24/60 = 2.4. Subtract coffee time t minutes (t/60 hours) to get walking time, which must equal distance/speed: 9/(s+2).; answer: Aya’s walking time at speed s+2 is 2.4 – t/60 hours, which equals 9/(s+2) hours.\nCoT-SC agent LFhs, calculating walking time at speed s+2, thinking: To calculate Aya’s walking time at speed s+2, convert 2 h 24 min to hours (2.4 h), subtract the coffee time t/60, and set that equal to distance/speed.; answer: Aya’s walking time at speed s+2 is 2.4 – t/60 hours, which equals 9/(s+2) hours.\nCoT-SC agent F7KP, calculating walking time at speed s+2, thinking: We subtract coffee time t (in hours) from total trip time 2\u2009h\u200924\u2009min = 2.4\u2009h to get walking time, and set that equal to distance over speed.; answer: Aya’s walking time at speed s+2 is 2.4 – t/60 hours, which equals 9/(s+2) hours.\nReflexion CoT agent HpA3, solving for initial speed s, thinking: We have from Sub-task 1: 4 – t/60 = 9/s. From Sub-task 2: 2.4 – t/60 = 9/(s+2). Subtracting the second from the first gives 1.6 = 9/s – 9/(s+2) = 18/(s(s+2)), so s(s+2) = 18/1.6 = 11.25.
