Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.
[asy] size(10cm); usepackage(&#34;tikz&#34;);label(&#34;egintikzpicture[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(2,0)--(2,3)--(5,3)--(5,8)--(8,8);\endtikzpicture&#34;,origin); label(&#34;\begintikzpicture[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(0,3)--(3,3)--(3,5)--(8,5)--(8,8);\endtikzpicture&#34;,E); [/asy].

### Sub-task 6: Format the final result as the total number of paths that satisfy the given conditions and ensure it aligns with the initial query requirements. 

 ### thinking by Debate Agent EQjV:
Both patterns contribute 147 paths each, giving a total of 294 paths with exactly four direction changes.

### thinking by Debate Agent dEGE:
Based on the previous sub-tasks, each pattern yields 147 paths, giving a total of 294 paths with exactly four direction changes.

### answer by Debate Agent EQjV:
294

### answer by Debate Agent dEGE:
294

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Make final decision on formatted result.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
