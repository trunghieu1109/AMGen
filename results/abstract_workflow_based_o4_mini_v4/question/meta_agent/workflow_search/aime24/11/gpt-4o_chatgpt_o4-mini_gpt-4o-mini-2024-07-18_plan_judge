Question: Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.
[asy] size(10cm); usepackage("tikz");label("egin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(2,0)--(2,3)--(5,3)--(5,8)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}",origin); label("\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(0,3)--(3,3)--(3,5)--(8,5)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}",E); [/asy]
Iteration: abstract_workflow_2_11
proposed answer: Monotonic paths from (0,0) to (8,8) with exactly four direction changes correspond to five alternating runs of east and north moves. Counting compositions yields 147 starting with east and 147 starting with north.

Iteration: abstract_workflow_5_11
proposed answer: Both patterns contribute 147 paths each, giving a total of 294 paths with exactly four direction changes.
