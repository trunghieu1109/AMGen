Question: Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.
Iteration: abstract_workflow_2_8
proposed answer: Bob’s winning positions are when n≡0 or 2 mod 5. Up to 2024 there are ⌊2024/5⌋=404 multiples of 5 and ⌊(2024−2)/5⌋+1=405 numbers ≡2 mod 5, totaling 404+405=809.

proposed answer: We count n in [1..2024] that are ≡0 or 2 mod 5. Multiples of 5: floor(2024/5)=404. Those ≡2 mod 5: floor((2024-2)/5)+1=405. Sum=404+405=809.
