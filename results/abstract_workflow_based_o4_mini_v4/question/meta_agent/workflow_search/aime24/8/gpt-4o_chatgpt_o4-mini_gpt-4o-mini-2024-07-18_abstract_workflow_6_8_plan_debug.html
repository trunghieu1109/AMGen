    <pre>Related original question:

Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alices play.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 1: Identify the conditions under which a position is winning or losing in the game. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent SmJx:
We recognize this as a subtraction game with move set {1,4}.  A position is losing (P-position) iff none of its options (n−1 or n−4) is losing.  Computing up from 0 shows that the losing positions form a periodic pattern mod 5.  Specifically, n=0,2,5,7,10,… are losing, i.e. n≡0 or 2 (mod 5).  All other n are winning (N-positions).

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent SmJx:
A position with n tokens is losing (P-position) exactly when n≡0 or 2 (mod 5).  It is winning (N-position) when n≡1,3,4 (mod 5).

### Sub-task 2: Develop a rule or pattern to classify each position as either winning or losing for the player whose turn it is, based on the output from Sub-task 1. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent iUkD:
From Sub-task 1 we know losing positions are exactly those where n≡0 or 2 (mod 5), so we can directly classify any position by its residue mod 5.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent iUkD:
For any position with n tokens:
If n mod 5 is 0 or 2, it is a losing position (P-position).
Otherwise (n mod 5 = 1, 3, or 4), it is a winning position (N-position).

### Sub-task 3: Make final decision on losing positions. 

 ### thinking by Final Decision Agent 3YjH:
From standard impartial game analysis with moves of size 1 or 4, the P-positions (losing for the next player, here Alice) repeat periodically modulo 5. One checks base cases n=0 (P),1(N),2(P),3(N),4(N) and the pattern n≡0,2 mod 5 persists by induction for all n≤2024.

### answer by Final Decision Agent 3YjH:
All losing positions for Alice with n≤2024 are exactly those n such that n≡0 or 2 (mod 5). Equivalently, n=5k or n=5k+2 for integers k with 0≤k≤404.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Calculate the total number of losing positions for Alice when n is less than or equal to 2024 using the pattern or strategy identified.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>We count n in [1..2024] that are ≡0 or 2 mod 5. Multiples of 5: floor(2024/5)=404. Those ≡2 mod 5: floor((2024-2)/5)+1=405. Sum=404+405=809.
