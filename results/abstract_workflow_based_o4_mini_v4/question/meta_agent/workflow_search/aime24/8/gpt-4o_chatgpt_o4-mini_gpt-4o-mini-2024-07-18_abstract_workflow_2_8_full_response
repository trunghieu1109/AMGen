Question: Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.

Bob plays second, so initial P-positions are those n for which Alice (first mover) loses. Compute for small n: n=0 is P (trivial); n=1: only move to 0(P) ⇒ N; n=2: move to 1(N) ⇒ P; n=3: move to 2(P) ⇒ N; n=4: moves to 3(N) or 0(P), so N; n=5: moves to 4(N) or 1(N) ⇒ P. Thus the smallest P’s (Bob wins) are n=2,5, and the smallest N’s (Bob loses) are n=1,3,4.; answer: Base losing positions for Bob (N-positions): n=1, 3, 4. Base winning positions for Bob (P-positions): n=2, 5.\nCoT-SC agent PBzU, determine recurrence relations, thinking: We use standard impartial‐game analysis: label positions N if the player to move can force a win, and P if they cannot.  From subtask 1 we have P‐positions at n=2,5 (and n=0 by convention), and N‐positions at n=1,3,4.  A position is N exactly when there is a move to a P‐position; it is P when all moves lead to N‐positions.; answer: Base cases:\nP(0)=True (losing for mover), P(1)=False, P(2)=True, P(3)=False, P(4)=False, P(5)=True.\nFor n>=6:\nP(n)=not(P(n-1) or P(n-4)),\nN(n)=P(n-1) or P(n-4).\nEquivalently, n is a losing (P) position iff both n-1 and n-4 are winning (N) positions; otherwise it is winning (N).\nCoT-SC agent KFi3, determine recurrence relations, thinking: We need to state the standard impartial‐game recurrence: a position is losing for the player about to move (a P‐position) exactly when all moves lead to winning positions (N‐positions), and winning (N) if some move leads to a P. Removals allowed are 1 or 4, and we use base cases from Sub‐task 1.; answer: For n≥1 define:  • n is a P-position (Bob wins if Alice faces it) ⇔ both n−1 and n−4 (if ≥0) are N-positions.  • n is an N-position (Alice wins if she faces it) ⇔ at least one of n−1 or n−4 (if ≥0) is a P-position.  Base cases: P: n=2,5; N: n=1,3,4.\nCoT-SC agent kuLg, determine recurrence relations, thinking: We use the definition of P-positions (previous player wins) and N-positions (next player wins). From the base cases, a position n is an N-position if there is a move (removing 1 or 4 tokens) to a P-position; otherwise it is a P-position.; answer: For n≥1: If (n−1) is a P-position or (n−4) is a P-position (when n≥4), then n is an N-position. Otherwise n is a P-position.\nEquivalently:\n• N(n)=true if [n≥1 and P(n−1)=true] or [n≥4 and P(n−4)=true].\n• P(n)=true if N(n−1)=true (for n≥1) and N(n−4)=true (for n≥4).\nReflexion CoT agent HAEJ, classify positions, thinking: Classifying all 2024 positions individually is impractical to list explicitly. Noting the recurrence P(n)=¬(P(n−1)∨P(n−4)) with base P(0)=True,P(1)=False,P(2)=True,P(3)=False,P(4)=False yields a 5-periodic pattern: P-positions (where Bob wins) occur exactly when n≡0 or 2 (mod 5). Thus a concise rule covers all n≤2024.; answer: Bob is in a winning (P) position exactly when n mod 5 ∈ {0,2}, and in a losing (N) position otherwise. [TOO_HARD]\nTo provide the full list of 2024 classifications, please confirm if a programmatic or tabulated output is acceptable, or if you need further decomposition.\nCritic agent Jo64, providing feedback, thinking: The proposed P-position classification (n mod 5 ∈ {0,2}) is correct. It matches the recurrence P(n)=¬(P(n−1)∨P(n−4)) with period 5.; answer: Yes\nReflexion CoT agent HAEJ, refining classifications, thinking: To classify 1≤n≤2024 we use the proven 5-periodic pattern: P-positions (Bob wins) occur exactly when n≡0 or 2 mod 5; N-positions (Bob loses) otherwise. Listing 2024 entries is unwieldy.; answer: Bob is in a winning position iff n mod 5 ∈ {0,2}, losing otherwise.\n[TOO_HARD]\nGenerating or displaying all 2024 classifications explicitly is impractical here; please specify if a programmatic list or a summarized residue‐class description suffices.\nCritic agent Jo64, providing feedback, thinking: The classification is accurate. With moves of size 1 or 4 the game is 5-periodic, and the P-positions (where the previous player—Bob on Alice’s turn—wins) are exactly n≡0 or 2 mod 5. Thus Bob wins iff n mod 5∈{0,2}.; answer: Yes\nReflexion CoT agent HAEJ, refining classifications, thinking: We established P-positions (Bob wins) satisfy n≡0 or 2 mod 5 by the recurrence P(n)=¬(P(n−1)∨P(n−4)), which is 5-periodic. Classifying each n from 1 to 2024 individually is unwieldy but follows this simple rule.; answer: For each n from 1 to 2024:\n- Bob wins (P-position) if n mod 5 ∈ {0, 2}.\n- Bob loses (N-position) otherwise.\n[TOO_HARD]\nPlease specify whether you would like a programmatic list of all 2024 entries or if this residue‐class description suffices.\nCritic agent Jo64, providing feedback, thinking: The classification n mod 5 ∈ {0,2} for Bob’s winning (P-)positions is exactly correct for the move set {1,4}.; answer: Yes\nReflexion CoT agent HAEJ, refining classifications, thinking: The recurrence P(n)=¬(P(n−1)∨P(n−4)) with bases P(0)=True,P(1)=False,P(2)=True,P(3)=False,P(4)=False is 5‐periodic. One checks that P(n) holds exactly when n≡0 or 2 mod 5. Thus for all n≤2024, Bob (playing second) is in a winning position (P) iff n mod 5∈{0,2}.; answer: For each n from 1 to 2024: Bob wins (P‐position) precisely when n mod 5 is 0 or 2; otherwise Bob loses (N‐position).\nDebate agent DDkD, round 0, counting positions, thinking: Bob wins for n mod 5 in {0,2}.
