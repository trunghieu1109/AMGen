Question: Find the number of triples of nonnegative integers \((a,b,c)\) satisfying \(a + b + c = 300\) and
\begin{equation*}
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.
\end{equation*}
Iteration: abstract_workflow_2_17
proposed answer: From Subtask 5 each choice of which variable equals 100 gives 201 pairs for the other two summing to 200, so 3Ã—201=603. The triple (100,100,100) is counted in all three, so we subtract 2 duplicate counts, yielding 601.
