Case 1: one variable is zero, say a=0 ⇒ bc(b+c)=6,000,000 with b+c=300 ⇒ bc=20,000 ⇒ (b,c)=(100,200) or (200,100), yielding 6 permutations by symmetry.  Case 2: a=b=c gives 6a³=6,000,000 ⇒ a=100.

A standard identity for three variables is\n  a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = (a+b+c)(ab+bc+ca) - 3abc.\nSince a+b+c=300, substitute to get 300·(ab+bc+ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.\nDividing by 3 gives 100·(ab+bc+ca) - abc = 2,000,000, so\n    abc = 100·(ab+bc+ca) - 2,000,000.\nBecause abc ≥ 0, we deduce ab+bc+ca ≥ 20,000.  On the other hand, the maximum of ab+bc+ca under a+b+c=300 occurs at a=b=c=100 giving 30,000.  Thus ab+bc+ca ∈ [20000,30000] and must satisfy abc=100·S−2,000,000.; answer: We rewrite the left side as (a+b+c)(ab+bc+ca)−3abc = 300·S −3T, where S=ab+bc+ca and T=abc.  Thus 300S−3T =6,000,000 ⇒100S −T =2,000,000 ⇒T =100S−2,000,000.  Since T≥0 we get S≥20,000; also under a+b+c=300 one has S≤30,000 (attained at a=b=c=100).  Hence ab+bc+ca must lie between 20,000 and 30,000 and satisfy abc =100·(ab+bc+ca)−2,000,000.\nCoT-SC agent bpFn, analyzing polynomial equation, thinking: We can rewrite the symmetric sum S = a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b in closed form.  Noting that b+c=300−a, one obtains S = ∑a^2(300−a) = 300(a^2+b^2+c^2) − (a^3+b^3+c^3).  Equivalently, using the identity (a+b+c)(ab+bc+ca)=∑a^2b+3abc, we get S = 300(ab+bc+ca) − 3abc.  Hence the condition S=6,000,000 becomes 300T−3P=6,000,000, or 100T−P=2,000,000, where T=ab+bc+ca and P=abc.  Solving this Diophantine relation in nonnegative integers under a+b+c=300 appears to require detailed casework or bounds on abc vs. ab+bc+ca, making a direct enumeration challenging.; answer: We have\n1) S=∑_{sym}a^2b = 300(ab+bc+ca)−3abc.\n2) Thus the condition becomes 100(ab+bc+ca)−abc=2,000,000.\n[TOO_HARD]\nSuggest decomposing the problem by setting T=ab+bc+ca and P=abc, bounding P from above, and performing casework on divisors of 2,000,000 to find all (a,b,c).\nCoT-SC agent EleU, analyzing polynomial equation, thinking: We can express the symmetric sum S = a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b in terms of the elementary symmetric sums p=a+b+c, q=ab+bc+ca, r=abc.  Note that\n  S = ab(a+b) + bc(b+c) + ca(c+a)\n    = (ab+bc+ca)(a+b+c) - 3abc\n    = p·q - 3r.\nSince p = 300 and S = 6,000,000, we get\n  300q - 3r = 6,000,000\n⇔ 100q - r = 2,000,000\n⇔ r = 100q - 2,000,000.\nThus the second condition is equivalent to r = 100q - 2,000,000.; answer: We can rewrite a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = (ab+bc+ca)(a+b+c) - 3abc  \nWith a+b+c = 300, the equation becomes 300q - 3r = 6,000,000, i.e. r = 100q - 2,000,000, where q = ab+bc+ca and r = abc.\nDebate agent UmEJ, round 0, discussing restriction from first equation, thinking: To integrate the restriction a+b+c=300 with nonnegativity, we observe that once any two of a,b,c are chosen (each between 0 and 300 and summing to at most 300), the third is fixed. Geometrically, the integer solutions lie on the 2-simplex in ℕ³. This yields the parametrization given below.; answer: The triples (a,b,c) are exactly those of the form (a,b,300−a−b) with integers a≥0, b≥0 and a+b≤300. This implies 0≤a,b,c≤300 and c is uniquely determined by a and b.\nDebate agent 7fS1, round 0, discussing restriction from first equation, thinking: The sub-task asks to synthesize how the condition a + b + c = 300 confines the possible triples. We note that this alone forces each of a, b, c to be between 0 and 300 and their sum exactly 300, so the solutions lie on a discrete 2-simplex in nonnegative integers.; answer: The restriction is that (a,b,c) must be nonnegative integers with 0≤a,b,c≤300 and a+b+c=300, i.e. all solutions lie on the integer points of the triangle (simplex) defined by that plane in ℝ³.\nDebate agent UmEJ, round 1, discussing restriction from first equation, thinking: To integrate the restriction a+b+c=300 with nonnegativity, we note that once any two of a,b,c are chosen (each between 0 and 300 with sum ≤300), the third is uniquely determined, so the solutions form a discrete 2-simplex in ℕ³.; answer: The equation a+b+c=300 with a,b,c≥0 implies that for any nonnegative a and b satisfying a+b≤300, we have c=300−a−b. Hence the solution set is the lattice points in the triangle (2-simplex) defined by 0≤a,b≤300 and a+b≤300.\nDebate agent 7fS1, round 1, discussing restriction from first equation, thinking: The sub-task asks to synthesize how the condition a + b + c = 300 confines the possible triples. We note that with nonnegativity, each variable is between 0 and 300 inclusive, and fixing any two values determines the third.; answer: The equation a + b + c = 300 together with a, b, c ≥ 0 restricts (a, b, c) to the discrete 2-simplex in ℕ³: each is between 0 and 300, their sum is 300, so choosing any two values fixes the third as 300 minus their sum.\nDebate agent UmEJ, round 2, discussing restriction from first equation, thinking: We note that the equation a+b+c=300 together with a,b,c≥0 forces the triples to lie on the discrete 2-simplex: once any two are chosen within their allowable ranges, the third is fixed.; answer: The condition restricts (a,b,c) to all nonnegative integer triples summing to 300, i.e. {(a,b,c): a,b,c∈ℕ₀, a+b+c=300}. Equivalently, choosing any a∈[0,300] and b∈[0,300−a] uniquely determines c=300−a−b.\nDebate agent 7fS1, round 2, discussing restriction from first equation, thinking: To combine the nonnegativity and a+b+c=300, note that each of a,b,c must lie between 0 and 300, and once any two are chosen (with sum ≤300) the third is forced to be 300 minus their sum. This describes all integer points on a 2‐dimensional simplex in ℕ³.; answer: The triples (a,b,c) are exactly those nonnegative integers with a+b+c=300, i.e. 0≤a,b≤300, c=300−a−b (so choosing any two with sum≤300 uniquely determines the third).\nFinal Decision agent on first restriction, thinking: The equation a+b+c=300 with nonnegativity confines (a,b,c) to the integer points on a 2‐simplex: once two variables are chosen so their sum is ≤300, the third is fixed. This yields a complete parameterization.; answer: The restriction from a+b+c=300 with a,b,c≥0 confines the solutions to nonnegative integer triples on a 2‐dimensional simplex: choose any integer a∈[0,300] and b∈[0,300−a], then c is uniquely determined by c=300−a−b.\nCoT agent lEnq, looking for polynomial symmetries, thinking: The question asks for an analysis of how symmetry in the symmetric polynomial ⋯ lets us reduce the search for solutions. We can assume an ordering on (a,b,c) and then classify orbits under the action of S₃. No numerical computation is required here, just the reduction strategy.; answer: The equation a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6 000 000 is fully symmetric in (a,b,c).  Hence:\n1. Any solution (a,b,c) yields up to 6 distinct permutations, all valid.\n2. We may impose an ordering, say a ≤ b ≤ c, to avoid redundant checks.\n3. There are three orbit-types under S₃:\n   • Triple-equal case: a = b = c = 100 (one orbit of size 1).\n   • Double-equal case: a = b ≠ c.  Then set 2a + c = 300 and substitute into 300·(ab+bc+ca)−3abc = 6 000 000 to get one equation in (a,c).  Each solution gives an orbit of size 3 under permutations.\n   • All-distinct case: a < b < c.  One must solve the two equations a+b+c=300 and 300·S−3T=6 000 000 (with S=ab+bc+ca, T=abc), yielding discrete integer candidates; each valid triple produces 6 permutations.\nBy restricting to a ≤ b ≤ c and examining these three types, one cuts the search space drastically and accounts for symmetry automatically.\nReflexion CoT agent rbvf, simplifying polynomial, thinking: We seek to exploit the full S₃‐symmetry of the polynomial a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.  The standard tool is to rewrite it in terms of the elementary symmetric polynomials e₁=a+b+c, e₂=ab+bc+ca, e₃=abc.  One uses the identity\n    ∑_{sym}a²b = e₁e₂ − 3e₃.\nSubstituting e₁=300 into the given equation yields 300·e₂ − 3·e₃ = 6 000 000, which simplifies to 100·e₂ − e₃ = 2 000 000, or equivalently e₃ = 100·e₂ − 2 000 000.  This reduces the two original equations to a single relation between e₂ and e₃, drastically cutting down the search for integer solutions under e₁=300.; answer: Express in elementary symmetric polynomials: let e₁=a+b+c=300, e₂=ab+bc+ca, e₃=abc. Then\na²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = e₁e₂ − 3e₃ = 300·e₂ − 3e₃.\nThus 300e₂ − 3e₃ = 6 000 000 ⇒ 100e₂ − e₃ = 2 000 000 ⇒ e₃ = 100e₂ − 2 000 000.\nCritic agent lbur, providing feedback, feedback: The use of the symmetric identity ∑_{sym}a²b = e₁e₂ - 3e₃ is correct, and substituting e₁ = 300 into 300e₂ - 3e₃ = 6 000 000 is valid.; correct: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = e₁e₂ - 3e₃ = 300e₂ - 3e₃, so 300e₂ - 3e₃ = 6 000 000 ⇒ 100e₂ - e₃ = 2 000 000 ⇒ e₃ = 100e₂ - 2 000 000.\nReflexion CoT agent rbvf, refining polynomial simplification, thinking: We apply the standard identity for the full symmetric sum of a^2b terms in three variables. Rewriting it in terms of elementary symmetric polynomials reduces two equations to one simple relation, drastically cutting the solution search.; answer: Let e1 = a + b + c, e2 = ab + bc + ca, e3 = abc.  Then a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = e1·e2 − 3·e3.  Since e1 = 300, the given equation becomes 300·e2 − 3·e3 = 6,000,000, or equivalently 100·e2 − e3 = 2,000,000.  Hence e3 = 100·e2 − 2,000,000, reducing the original system to a single relation between e2 and e3 under the constraint e1 = 300.\nCritic agent lbur, providing feedback, feedback: The simplification is correct: you have accurately applied the symmetric‐sum identity a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = e1·e2 − 3·e3 with e1 = 300, yielding 300·e2 − 3·e3 = 6,000,000 and hence 100·e2 − e3 = 2,000,000. This indeed reduces the problem to the constraints e1 = 300 and e3 = 100·e2 − 2,000,000.; correct: e3 = 100·e2 − 2,000,000\nReflexion CoT agent rbvf, refining polynomial simplification, thinking: We apply the standard symmetric‐sum identity to rewrite the sum of a²b‐type terms in terms of the elementary symmetric polynomials e₁,e₂,e₃ and substitute e₁=300 to collapse the two original equations into one simple relation.; answer: Let e₁=a+b+c=300, e₂=ab+bc+ca, e₃=abc.  Then a²b+a²c+b²a+b²c+c²a+c²b=e₁e₂−3e₃=300·e₂−3·e₃.  Setting this equal to 6 000 000 gives 300e₂−3e₃=6 000 000 ⇒100e₂−e₃=2 000 000 ⇒e₃=100e₂−2 000 000.\nCritic agent lbur, providing feedback, feedback: The application of the symmetric‐sum identity a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = e₁e₂ − 3e₃ is correct, and substituting e₁ = 300 to get 300\u2009e₂ − 3\u2009e₃ = 6 000 000 is valid. However, this only produces one relation between e₂ and e₃; you will need further equations or combinatorial constraints to determine specific values for e₂ and e₃ (or for a,b,c).; correct: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = e₁e₂ − 3e₃ = 300·e₂ − 3·e₃, so 300\u2009e₂ − 3\u2009e₃ = 6 000 000 ⇒ 100\u2009e₂ − e₃ = 2 000 000.\nReflexion CoT agent rbvf, refining polynomial simplification, thinking: The key identity ∑_{sym}a²b = e₁e₂ − 3e₃ with e₁=a+b+c, e₂=ab+bc+ca, e₃=abc is correctly applied in each attempt.  Substituting e₁=300 turns the original equation into 300·e₂−3·e₃=6 000 000, i.e. 100·e₂−e₃=2 000 000, or e₃=100·e₂−2 000 000.  This single relation captures the polynomial condition but does not by itself determine specific integer values for e₂ or e₃: one must still impose nonnegativity, arithmetic bounds, or combinatorial enumeration to find all valid (a,b,c).; answer: The algebraic simplification is correct: using e₁=a+b+c=300, e₂=ab+bc+ca, e₃=abc gives a²b+a²c+b²a+b²c+c²a+c²b = e₁e₂−3e₃ = 300·e₂−3·e₃, hence 300e₂−3e₃=6 000 000 ⇒100e₂−e₃=2 000 000 ⇒e₃=100e₂−2 000 000.

For clarity you could also state the implicit bounds on e₂ (and hence on a,b) or note that one can iterate over (a,b)∈[0,300]² with c=300−a−b, but the formulation as given is complete and equivalent to the original problem.; correct: a,b,c ∈ ℤ≥0; a + b + c = 300; let e₂ = ab + bc + ca, e₃ = abc; then enforce e₃ = 100·e₂ − 2 000 000.\nReflexion CoT agent z6Bf, refining constraints system, thinking: We combine the parametrization a,b≥0, c=300−a−b from subtask 3 with the symmetric‐sum identity from subtask 5, giving e₁=a+b+c=300, e₂=ab+bc+ca, e₃=abc, and the relation 300·e₂−3·e₃=6\u2009000\u2009000 ⇒ e₃=100·e₂−2\u2009000\u2009000.

This formulation is both necessary and sufficient for solving the Diophantine system.

If one variable is zero, say a=0, then the sum reduces to bc(b+c)=6,000,000 with b+c=300, so bc=20,000 giving (b,c)=(100,200) or (200,100). By symmetry this yields the 6 permutations of (0,100,200). Also the equal‐partition case (100,100,100) gives 6×1,000,000=6,000,000.
