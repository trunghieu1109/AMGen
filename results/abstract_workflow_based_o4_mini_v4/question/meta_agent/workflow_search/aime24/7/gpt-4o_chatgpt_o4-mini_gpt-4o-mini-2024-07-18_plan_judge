Question: There exist real numbers $x$ and $y$, both greater than 1, such that $\log_x\left(y^x\right)=\log_y\left(x^{4y}\right)=10$. Find $xy$.
Iteration: abstract_workflow_2_7
proposed answer: From x=22.5 and y=22.5^(4/9), we get xy = 22.5 * 22.5^(4/9) = 22.5^(1+4/9) = 22.5^(13/9).

Answer:xy = 22.5^(13/9)
Extracted answer: xy = 22.5^(13/9)
Correct answer: 025
