    <pre>Related original question:

There exist real numbers $x$ and $y$, both greater than 1, such that $\log_x\left(y^x\right)=\log_y\left(x^4y\right)=10$. Find $xy$.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 4: Make final decision on the solutions meeting the conditions. 

 ### thinking by Final Decision Agent Yzvj:
We verify that x=22.5&gt;1 and y=22.5^(4/9)&gt;1, and substituting into both logarithmic equations yields 10, so all original conditions are satisfied with no further refinement required.

### answer by Final Decision Agent Yzvj:
The solutions x=22.5 and y=22.5^(4/9) both exceed 1 and satisfy the given equations; no refinement is needed.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 5: Calculate the product xy based on validated values of x and y from Sub-task 4.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>From x=22.5 and y=22.5^(4/9), we get xy = 22.5 * 22.5^(4/9) = 22.5^(1+4/9) = 22.5^(13/9).
