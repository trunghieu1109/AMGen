This is straightforward function definition and composition.; answer: f(x)=\\bigl|\\,|x|-\\tfrac12\\bigr|, g(x)=\\bigl|\\,|x|-\\tfrac14\\bigr|. In y=4g(f(sin(2πx))) you first compute u=sin(2πx), then v=f(u)=|\u2009|u|−1/2\u2009|, then w=g(v)=|\u2009|v|−1/4\u2009| and finally y=4w. Similarly, x=4g(f(cos(3πy))) means you take u=cos(3πy), then v=f(u), w=g(v), and multiply by 4 to get x.\nCoT agent kzRd, determine domain transformations, thinking: Since f and g accept any real input and sine/cosine are defined on all ℝ, there are no further restrictions on x or y. The only bounds to note are the ranges of the inner functions: sin(2πx) and cos(3πy) both lie in [−1,1].; answer: Domain: x∈ℝ (so sin(2πx) is always defined and its values lie in [−1,1]).\nDomain: y∈ℝ (so cos(3πy) is always defined and its values lie in [−1,1]).\nReflexion CoT agent 7U3M, calculate possible values, thinking: We need the range of 4·g(f(t)) for t∈[−1,1]. First f(t)=||t|−½| gives values in [0,½]. Then g(x)=||x|−¼| on x∈[0,½] yields values in [0,¼]. Multiplying by 4 gives the range [0,1].; answer: For both expressions 4·g(f(sin(2πx))) and 4·g(f(cos(3πy))) the possible values lie in the interval [0,1].\nCritic agent D6fT, providing feedback, thinking: The reasoning is correct: f maps [–1,1] to [0,0.5], g then maps that to [0,0.25], and multiplying by 4 gives the full interval [0,1], with endpoints attained.; answer: For both 4·g(f(sin(2πx))) and 4·g(f(cos(3πy))), the possible values range over [0,1].\nReflexion CoT agent 7U3M, refining possible values, thinking: Since sin(2πx) and cos(3πy) both range over [–1,1], f(t)=||t|–½| maps [–1,1] to [0,0.5], then g(x)=||x|–¼| maps [0,0.5] to [0,0.25], and multiplying by 4 gives [0,1].; answer: The expressions 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) and 4 g(f(cos(3πy))) each take values in the interval [0,1].\nCritic agent D6fT, providing feedback, thinking: The reasoning is sound: for t in [–1,1], f(t)=||t|–½| yields [0,½], then g maps [0,½] to [0,¼], and multiplying by 4 gives the interval [0,1].; answer: The possible values of both 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) and 4 g(f(cos(3πy))) lie in [0,1].\nReflexion CoT agent 7U3M, refining possible values, thinking: Since sin(2πx) and cos(3πy) both range over [–1,1], applying f(t)=||t|–½| gives values in [0,0.5], then g(x)=||x|–¼| yields [0,0.25], and multiplying by 4 scales this to [0,1].; answer: The possible values of both 4·g(f(sin(2πx))) and 4·g(f(cos(3πy))) lie in the interval [0,1].\nCritic agent D6fT, providing feedback, thinking: The determination is correct.

Writing down the exact system\n    y=4g(f(sin(2πx))),\n    x=4g(f(cos(3πy)))\nand reducing it to a single fixed‐point equation x = B(A(x)) leads to multiple cases depending on the sign‐patterns of sin(2πx) and cos(3πy). Solving these cases in closed form is lengthy and error‐prone without further systematic decomposition.; answer: The intersections are exactly the (x,y) satisfying\ny = A(x) := 4g(f(sin(2πx)))\n and\n x = B(y) := 4g(f(cos(3πy))).\n[TOO_HARD]\nPlease decompose the problem by first forming the single equation\n    x = B(A(x))\nand then analyzing it piecewise according to the regions where sin(2πx) and cos(3πy) change sign, so that f and g simplify to linear expressions in each region.\nDebate agent f3EK, round 0, identifying intersections, thinking: The system y=4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x=4g(f(cos(3πy))) involves nested absolute‐value and trigonometric compositions, each of which is piecewise linear on several intervals determined by when |sin(2πx)| and |cos(3πy)| cross ¼ and ½. Solving simultaneously requires splitting into many cases and matching linear pieces—a lengthy case‐by‐case analysis. Without breaking it down further, it’s impractical to list all intersection points directly.; answer: [TOO_HARD]\nPlease decompose the problem by deriving the explicit piecewise‐linear formulas for 4g(f(sin(2πx))) on intervals where |sin(2πx)|∈[0,¼],[¼,½],[½,1] and similarly for x=4g(f(cos(3πy))). Then solve each resulting linear system to find all intersections.\nDebate agent 2Yao, round 1, identifying intersections, thinking: The system involves nested absolute values and trigonometric functions, each yielding piecewise linear segments depending on whether |sin(2πx)| and |cos(3πy)| cross 1/4 or 1/2.
