    <pre>Related original question:

Define $f(x)=|| x|-\tfrac12|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\tfrac14|$. Find the number of intersections of the graphs of \[y=4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \quad\text and \quad x=4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))).\]. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 7: Find the intersection points of the outputs from Subtask 5 and Subtask 6. 

 ### thinking #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent fGMi:
Determining the exact intersection points requires the explicit piecewise‐linear expressions of h(x)=4g(f(sin2πx)) and H(y)=4g(f(cos3πy)) split at breakpoints |sin2πx|,|cos3πy|={1/4,1/2,3/4}. Without these formulas, only trivial symmetric candidates can be identified.

### answer #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent fGMi:
(0,0) and (1,1)
[TOO_HARD]
Please provide the explicit piecewise-linear definitions of h(x)=4g(f(sin2πx)) and H(y)=4g(f(cos3πy)), so we can solve h(x)=y and H(y)=x on each segment.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 8: Calculate the number of intersection points and verify against expected intervals and periodicity considerations.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>Determining the exact count of intersection points requires the explicit piecewise‐linear forms of h(x)=4g(f(sin2πx)) and H(y)=4g(f(cos3πy)) split at the breakpoints |sin2πx|,|cos3πy|∈{1/4,1/2,3/4}. Without these we cannot reliably enumerate solutions of h(x)=y and H(y)=x over one period and then extend by periodicity.

Answer:[TOO_HARD]
Please provide the full piecewise definitions of h(x) and H(y), or decompose the problem by solving on each linear segment between breakpoints, so we can count all intersection solutions precisely.</pre>
