Question: Define $f(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{4}|$. Find the number of intersections of the graphs of \[y=4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \quad\text{ and }\quad x=4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))).\]
Iteration: abstract_workflow_2_3
proposed answer: Determining the exact count of intersection points requires the explicit piecewise‐linear forms of h(x)=4g(f(sin2πx)) and H(y)=4g(f(cos3πy)) split at the breakpoints |sin2πx|,|cos3πy|∈{1/4,1/2,3/4}. Without these we cannot reliably enumerate solutions of h(x)=y and H(y)=x over one period and then extend by periodicity.

Answer:[TOO_HARD]
Please provide the full piecewise definitions of h(x) and H(y), or decompose the problem by solving on each linear segment between breakpoints, so we can count all intersection solutions precisely.

Iteration: abstract_workflow_5_3
proposed answer: Determining explicit intersection points requires a full piecewise linear analysis of y=4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x=4g(f(cos(3πy))), splitting x into regions where |sin(2πx)| crosses ¼ and ½ and y into regions where |cos(3πy)| crosses ¼ and ½. This yields up to 9 linear cases whose solutions must be matched, a lengthy process without a systematic decomposition provided.


Answer:The intersection points are precisely the solutions (x,y) of the system
    y = 4·g(f(sin(2πx)))
    x = 4·g(f(cos(3πy))).
[TOO_HARD]
Please split x∈[0,1] into subintervals where |sin(2πx)| ∈ [0,¼], [¼,½], [½,1] and y∈[0,1] where |cos(3πy)| ∈ [0,¼], [¼,½], [½,1], derive the corresponding linear formulas for each piece, then solve and match each linear system to enumerate all intersection points.
