    <pre>Related original question:

Let $\triangle ABC$ have circumcenter $O$ and incenter $I$ with $\overlineIA\perp\overlineOI$, circumradius $13$, and inradius $6$. Find $AB\cdot AC$.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 6: Verify and format the final result for AB * AC to ensure consistency with geometric conditions and formats required. 

 ### thinking by Debate Agent CpG4:
We verify that for triangle ABC with circumradius R=13 and inradius r=6 under the perpendicularity condition IA⊥OI (implying OI²=R(R−2r)=13), all standard relations (Law of Sines, area formula, Euler’s Incenter–Circumcenter relation) yield AB·AC=468 consistently.

### thinking by Debate Agent flWx:
Given the circumradius R=13, inradius r=6, and the perpendicularity condition IA⊥OI implying OI²=R(R−2r)=13, all derivations consistently yield AB·AC=468 under the Law of Sines and area relations. This confirms the result is correctly formatted as a single integer.

### answer by Debate Agent CpG4:
468

### answer by Debate Agent flWx:
468

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Confirm final format and correctness of AB * AC.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
