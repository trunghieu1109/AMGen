Question: Let $\triangle ABC$ have circumcenter $O$ and incenter $I$ with $\overline{IA}\perp\overline{OI}$, circumradius $13$, and inradius $6$. Find $AB\cdot AC$.
Iteration: abstract_workflow_5_16
proposed answer: Confirming with the circumradius R=13, inradius r=6, and the condition IA⊥OI which gives OI² = R(R−2r) = 13, standard formulas (Euler’s relation, area formulas, Law of Sines) consistently yield AB·AC = 468.

Answer:468

Correct answer: 468
Question: Let $\triangle ABC$ have circumcenter $O$ and incenter $I$ with $\overline{IA}\perp\overline{OI}$, circumradius $13$, and inradius $6$. Find $AB\cdot AC$.
Iteration: abstract_workflow_2_16
proposed answer: Both derivations yield the same expression for AB·AC in terms of the semiperimeter s, namely AB·AC = 312s/(s - 2√30). Hence this is the final expression.

Answer:AB·AC = 312s/(s - 2√30)
Extracted answer: AB·AC = 312s/(s - 2√30)
Correct answer: 468
