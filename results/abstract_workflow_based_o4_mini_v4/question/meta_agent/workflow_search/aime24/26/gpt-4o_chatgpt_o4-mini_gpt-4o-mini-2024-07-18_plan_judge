Question: Alice chooses a set $A$ of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets $B$ of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of $B$ belongs to $A$. Bob's list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A.
Iteration: abstract_workflow_2_26
proposed answer: Each a in A contributes 2^{a-1} subsets. Given A={4,6,7,8,9,10,11}, sum is 4+6+7+8+9+10+11=55.

Iteration: abstract_workflow_6_26
proposed answer: From subtask 5 we have A = {4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11}. Summing these gives 4 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 = 55.
