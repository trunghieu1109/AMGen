    <pre>Related original question:

Alice chooses a set $A$ of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets $B$ of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of $B$ belongs to $A$. Bobs list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Refine possible solutions for A to ensure compliance with all conditions. 

 ### thinking #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent 0SLO:
To satisfy that the total number of nonempty subsets B with max B∈A equals 2024, we use the fact each a∈A contributes 2^{a−1} such subsets. Writing 2024 in binary: 2024 = 2^{10}+2^9+2^8+2^7+2^6+2^5+2^3, so the required a−1 exponents are {10,9,8,7,6,5,3}. Hence A = {11,10,9,8,7,6,4}, which is unique.

### answer #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent 0SLO:
A = {4,6,7,8,9,10,11}

Given the above, answer the following question: Calculate the sum of the elements of the valid set A.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
