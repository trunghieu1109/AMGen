    <pre>Related original question:

Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\tfracmn$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 5: Express the probability found in subtask 4 in the form m/n, where m and n are relatively prime, and compute m+n. 

 ### thinking #3 by Debate Agent EGmD:
From subtask 4 the probability is 1/16, so m=1 and n=16 are relatively prime, hence m+n=17.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent bEC2:
The probability is 1/16, so m=1 and n=16 are relatively prime. Therefore m+n=1+16=17.

### answer #3 by Debate Agent EGmD:
17

### answer #3 by Debate Agent bEC2:
17

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 5: Make final decision on expressing probability as m/n and finding m+n.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
