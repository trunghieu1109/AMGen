Question: Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?
Iteration: abstract_workflow_2_2
proposed answer: From subtask 4 the probability is 1/16, which is already in lowest terms (m=1, n=16), so m+n=17.

Iteration: abstract_workflow_6_2
proposed answer: The fraction obtained was 1/16, giving m=1 and n=16, so m+n=17. However, prior subtasks did not fully account for overlaps among colorings fixed by multiple rotations (inclusion–exclusion), so the probability may be incorrect without intersection counts.

Answer:17
[TOO_HARD]
Please provide the counts of colorings fixed by pairs or larger sets of rotations so we can apply inclusion–exclusion and confirm the fraction.
