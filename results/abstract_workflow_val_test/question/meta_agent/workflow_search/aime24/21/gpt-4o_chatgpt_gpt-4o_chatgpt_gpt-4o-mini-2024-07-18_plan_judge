Question: Find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon ($12$-gon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The diagram below shows three of those rectangles.

proposed answer: The problem involves counting the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon using its sides and diagonals. A regular dodecagon has 12 vertices, and a rectangle can be formed by selecting four vertices such that opposite sides are equal and parallel. In a regular dodecagon, this can be achieved by choosing vertices that are symmetric with respect to the center. Specifically, we can form a rectangle by choosing vertices V_k, V_(k+2), V_(k+6), and V_(k+8) for k = 0, 1, ..., 11. This configuration ensures that opposite sides are equal in length and parallel, as they are diagonals that skip the same number of vertices. There are 12 such configurations, one for each value of k from 0 to 11. Each configuration corresponds to a unique rectangle, and all these rectangles meet the specified conditions. Therefore, the number of valid rectangles is 12. This counting is complete and correct for the given problem, as it considers all possible configurations of rectangles that can be formed using the sides and diagonals of the dodecagon.

proposed answer: The problem involves counting the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon using its sides and diagonals. A regular dodecagon has 12 sides and 54 diagonals. Rectangles can be formed by selecting two pairs of parallel lines. There are 6 pairs of opposite sides, each forming a rectangle. Additionally, there are 5 types of diagonals based on the number of vertices they skip, and each type has 6 pairs of opposite diagonals that can form rectangles. Therefore, the total number of rectangles is 6 (from sides) + 5*6 (from diagonals) = 36. The symmetry of the dodecagon ensures that these are the only configurations possible, and the calculations have been validated to ensure no overlaps or miscounts. Thus, the final count of rectangles is 36.
