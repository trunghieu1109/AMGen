Find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon ($12$-gon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The diagram below shows three of those rectangles.
[asy] unitsize(0.6 inch); for(int i=0; i&lt;360; i+=30)  dot(dir(i), 4+black); draw(dir(i)--dir(i+30));  draw(dir(120)--dir(330)); filldraw(dir(210)--dir(240)--dir(30)--dir(60)--cycle, mediumgray, linewidth(1.5)); draw((0,0.366)--(0.366,0), linewidth(1.5)); [/asy].

 ### thinking #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent oYKb:
To count the number of valid rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon using its sides and diagonals, we need to consider the geometric properties of the dodecagon. A regular dodecagon has 12 vertices, labeled V_0, V_1, ..., V_11. A rectangle can be formed by selecting four vertices such that opposite sides are equal and parallel. In a regular dodecagon, this can be achieved by choosing vertices that are symmetric with respect to the center. Specifically, we can form a rectangle by choosing vertices V_k, V_(k+2), V_(k+6), and V_(k+8) for k = 0, 1, ..., 11. This configuration ensures that opposite sides are equal in length and parallel, as they are diagonals that skip the same number of vertices. There are 12 such configurations, one for each value of k from 0 to 11. Each configuration corresponds to a unique rectangle, and all these rectangles meet the specified conditions. Therefore, the number of valid rectangles is 12. The limitation of this counting is that it assumes the only way to form rectangles is by using this specific pattern of vertices, which is valid for a regular dodecagon. However, it does not consider other potential configurations that might arise in different polygonal structures or if the problem constraints were different. In this specific case, the counting is complete and correct for the given problem.

### answer #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent oYKb:
12

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Present the final count of rectangles as the solution to the query. 

 then justify completely and detailedly why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. Again, your task is only to answer the question Sub-task 6: Present the final count of rectangles as the solution to the query. and explaination.
If the output require generate `code`, ensure that the final output is stored in variable `result`. 
Eg: 
     
```python           
def calculator(...):
    
    return ...

result = calculator(...)
```
