    <pre>Related original question:

Alice chooses a set $A$ of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets $B$ of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of $B$ belongs to $A$. Bobs list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 4: Determine possible values of elements in set A that satisfy the condition from sub-task 3. 

 ### thinking #3 by Debate Agent Iu9i:
To solve this problem, we need to find a set A of positive integers such that the total number of sets B, which are nonempty subsets where the maximum element is in A, equals 2024. For each integer a in A, the number of such sets B is 2^a - 1. Therefore, the sum of these values for all elements a in A must equal 2024. The equation we need to satisfy is 2^a_1 + 2^a_2 + ... + 2^a_n - n = 2024, where n is the number of elements in A. Based on the sub-task solutions, the set A = {3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10} satisfies this condition. Each element contributes 2^a - 1 sets, and the sum of these contributions equals 2024. This set is confirmed to be correct, as it satisfies the equation when considering the number of elements in A.

### answer #3 by Debate Agent Iu9i:
{3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 5: Calculate the sum of the elements of set A. 

 then justify completely and detailedly why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. Again, your task is only to answer the question Sub-task 5: Calculate the sum of the elements of set A. and explaination.
If the output require generate `code`, ensure that the final output is stored in variable `result`. 
Eg: 
     
```python           
def calculator(...):
    
    return ...

result = calculator(...)

    <pre>The set A has been determined to be {3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}. To find the sum of the elements of set A, we simply add these numbers together. The sum is calculated as follows: 3 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10. This calculation gives us the total sum of the elements in set A.
