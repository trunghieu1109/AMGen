    <pre>Related original question:

Alice chooses a set $A$ of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets $B$ of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of $B$ belongs to $A$. Bobs list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 4: Use the condition from subtask_3 to determine the elements of set A. 

 ### thinking #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent CBg3:
To determine the elements of set A, we need to find a subset of positive integers such that the sum of 2^(a-1) for each element a in the subset equals 2024. From sub-task 3, we know that the binary representation of 2024 is 11111101000, which corresponds to the powers of 2: 2^3, 2^4, 2^5, 2^6, 2^7, 2^8, and 2^10. This means that the elements of A should be such that 2^(a-1) for these values of a will sum to 2024. Therefore, the elements of A are 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 10, because 2^(4-1) + 2^(5-1) + 2^(6-1) + 2^(7-1) + 2^(8-1) + 2^(10-1) = 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 + 1024 = 2024.

### answer #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent CBg3:
The elements of set A are 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 10.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 5: Calculate the sum of the elements of set A based on the elements determined in subtask_4. 

 then justify completely and detailedly why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. Again, your task is only to answer the question Sub-task 5: Calculate the sum of the elements of set A based on the elements determined in subtask_4. and explaination.
If the output require generate `code`, ensure that the final output is stored in variable `result`. 
Eg: 
     
```python           
def calculator(...):
    
    return ...

result = calculator(...)

    <pre>From sub-task 4, we have determined that the elements of set A are 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 10. To find the sum of the elements of set A, we simply add these numbers together. The sum is calculated as follows: 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 10 = 40. Therefore, the sum of the elements of set A is 40.
