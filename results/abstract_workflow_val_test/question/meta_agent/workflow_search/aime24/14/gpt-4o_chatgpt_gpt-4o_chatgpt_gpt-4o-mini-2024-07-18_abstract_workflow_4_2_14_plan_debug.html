    <pre>Related original question:

Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\fracx^220- \fracy^224 = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi..

### Sub-task 6: Calculate the greatest real number less than BD^2 for all such rhombi. 

 ### thinking by Debate Agent e7q5:
The problem involves finding the greatest real number less than BD^2 for a rhombus inscribed in the hyperbola \( \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \), with its diagonals intersecting at the origin. The maximum value of BD^2 occurs when the diagonals align with the asymptotes of the hyperbola, which are \( y = \pm \sqrt{\frac{24}{20}}x \). In this scenario, the rhombus forms a square, maximizing BD^2 to 88. Since we need the greatest real number less than this maximum, the answer is 87.

### thinking by Debate Agent GMua:
To determine the greatest real number less than BD^2 for all such rhombi inscribed in the hyperbola \( \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \), we need to consider the configuration where the diagonals of the rhombus align with the asymptotes of the hyperbola. The asymptotes for this hyperbola are given by the equations \( y = \pm \sqrt{\frac{24}{20}}x \). When the diagonals align with these asymptotes, the rhombus is maximized in size, and BD^2 reaches its maximum value of 88. However, since the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD^2, we take the integer value just below this maximum, which is 87.

### answer by Debate Agent e7q5:
87

### answer by Debate Agent GMua:
87

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Make a final decision on the greatest real number less than BD^2. 

 then justify completely and detailedly why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. Again, your task is only to answer the question Sub-task 6: Make a final decision on the greatest real number less than BD^2. and explaination.
If the output require generate `code`, ensure that the final output is stored in variable `result`. 
Eg: 
     
```python           
def calculator(...):
    
    return ...

result = calculator(...)

    <pre>The problem involves a rhombus inscribed in a hyperbola with its diagonals intersecting at the origin. The maximum value of BD^2 occurs when the diagonals align with the asymptotes of the hyperbola, which are given by the equations y = ±√(24/20)x. In this configuration, the rhombus forms a square, and BD^2 reaches its maximum value of 88. Since the problem asks for the greatest real number less than this maximum, the answer is the largest integer less than 88, which is 87.
