    <pre>Related original question:

Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overlineAD$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\fracmn$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 4: Express AP in the form m/n where m and n are relatively prime integers. 

 ### thinking #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent SlRP:
From the previous sub-tasks and feedback, we have determined that the length of segment AP is 25/4. This fraction is already in its simplest form, as 25 and 4 have no common factors other than 1. Therefore, m = 25 and n = 4 are relatively prime integers. The task is to express AP in the form m/n where m and n are relatively prime integers, which we have done. Thus, AP = 25/4. The expression is correct, and since 25 and 4 are coprime, it is in its simplest form. The calculations are based on the power of a point theorem and the properties of tangents to a circle.

### answer #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent SlRP:
25/4

### Sub-task 5: Calculate m + n from the expression of AP obtained in subtask 4. 

 ### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent RCmt (yourself):
From sub-task 4, we have determined that AP is expressed as 25/4, where 25 and 4 are relatively prime integers. Therefore, m = 25 and n = 4. To find m + n, we simply add these two integers together. Since m = 25 and n = 4, m + n = 25 + 4 = 29.

### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent RCmt (yourself):
29

### Review the calculation of m + n for accuracy and provide its limitations. 

 ### feedback #1 by Critic Agent JGwz:
The calculation of m + n is accurate. The expression for AP was given as 25/4, where 25 and 4 are relatively prime integers. Therefore, m = 25 and n = 4, and their sum is m + n = 25 + 4 = 29. There are no limitations in this calculation as it directly follows from the given expression for AP.

### Sub-task 5: Calculate m + n from the expression of AP obtained in subtask 4. 

 ### thinking #2 by Chain-of-Thought Agent RCmt (yourself):
In sub-task 4, we determined that the length of segment AP is expressed as 25/4, where 25 and 4 are relatively prime integers. This means m = 25 and n = 4. To find m + n, we simply add these two integers together. Since m = 25 and n = 4, their sum is m + n = 25 + 4 = 29. This calculation is straightforward and accurate, as it directly follows from the expression of AP given in its simplest form.

 then justify completely and detailedly why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. Again, your task is only to answer the question Sub-task 5: Calculate m + n from the expression of AP obtained in subtask 4. and explaination.
If the output require generate `code`, ensure that the final output is stored in variable `result`. 
Eg: 
     
```python           
def calculator(...):
    
    return ...

result = calculator(...)
