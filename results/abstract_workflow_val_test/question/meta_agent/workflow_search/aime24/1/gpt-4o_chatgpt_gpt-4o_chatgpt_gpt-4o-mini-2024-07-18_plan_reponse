        "response": "In sub-task 4, we found that the length of segment AP is expressed as 25/4, where 25 and 4 are relatively prime integers. This means m = 25 and n = 4. To find m + n, we simply add these two integers together. Since m = 25 and n = 4, their sum is m + n = 25 + 4 = 29. This calculation is straightforward and accurate, as it directly follows from the expression of AP given in its simplest form.\n\nAnswer:29",

        "response": "Both Debate Agents IsBK and EoNb have concluded that the length of AP is 6, which can be expressed as the fraction 6/1. In this fraction, 6 and 1 are relatively prime because their greatest common divisor is 1. Therefore, the sum m + n is 6 + 1 = 7. Since both agents agree on this conclusion and the reasoning is sound, the final decision for m + n is 7.\n\nAnswer:7",
