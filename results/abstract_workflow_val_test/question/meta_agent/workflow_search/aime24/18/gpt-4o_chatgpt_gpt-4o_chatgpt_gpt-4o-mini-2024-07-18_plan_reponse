This is consistent with the calculation provided, and since p and q are already relatively prime, no further simplification is needed.\n\nAnswer:5",

        "response": "In sub-task 4, we determined that the distance OC is 1/2, and thus OC^2 is (1/2)^2 = 1/4. The fraction 1/4 is already in its simplest form because the numerator 1 and the denominator 4 have no common factors other than 1, which means they are relatively prime. Therefore, we identify p = 1 and q = 4. To find p + q, we simply add these two numbers together, resulting in 1 + 4 = 5. This calculation is straightforward and ensures that the fraction is expressed in its simplest form, confirming that p and q are relatively prime.\n\nAnswer:5",
