    <pre>Related original question:

Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac12,0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac\sqrt32\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcalF\) be the family of segments \(\overlinePQ\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overlineAB\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcalF\) other than \(\overlineAB\). Then \(OC^2=\tfracpq\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\)..

### Sub-task 6: Calculate OC^2 and express it in the form p/q, where p and q are relatively prime integers. 

 ### thinking #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent 5Fnw:
To calculate OC^2, we need to find the square of the distance from the origin O(0,0) to the point C(1/4, sqrt(3)/4). The distance formula between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is given by sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2). Applying this to the points O(0,0) and C(1/4, sqrt(3)/4), we have OC = sqrt((1/4)^2 + (sqrt(3)/4)^2). Calculating this, we find OC^2 = (1/4)^2 + (sqrt(3)/4)^2 = 1/16 + 3/16 = 4/16 = 1/4. Therefore, OC^2 = 1/4, which is already in the form p/q where p and q are relatively prime integers. Here, p = 1 and q = 4, so p + q = 1 + 4 = 5.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 7: Find the sum p + q. 

 then justify completely and detailedly why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. Again, your task is only to answer the question Sub-task 7: Find the sum p + q. and explaination.
If the output require generate `code`, ensure that the final output is stored in variable `result`. 
Eg: 
     
```python           
def calculator(...):
    
    return ...

result = calculator(...)

    <pre>From the previous sub-task, we have determined that OC^2 = 1/4, where p = 1 and q = 4 are relatively prime integers. Therefore, the sum p + q is 1 + 4 = 5. This is consistent with the calculation provided, and since p and q are already relatively prime, no further simplification is needed.
