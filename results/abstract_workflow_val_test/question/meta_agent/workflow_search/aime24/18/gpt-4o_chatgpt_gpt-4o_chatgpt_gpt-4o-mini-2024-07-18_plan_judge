Question: Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). Then \(OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\).
Iteration: abstract_workflow_1_18
proposed answer: From the previous sub-task, we have determined that OC^2 = 1/4, where p = 1 and q = 4 are relatively prime integers. Therefore, the sum p + q is 1 + 4 = 5. This is consistent with the calculation provided, and since p and q are already relatively prime, no further simplification is needed.

Iteration: abstract_workflow_2_18
proposed answer: In sub-task 4, we determined that the distance OC is 1/2, and thus OC^2 is (1/2)^2 = 1/4. The fraction 1/4 is already in its simplest form because the numerator 1 and the denominator 4 have no common factors other than 1, which means they are relatively prime. Therefore, we identify p = 1 and q = 4. To find p + q, we simply add these two numbers together, resulting in 1 + 4 = 5. This calculation is straightforward and ensures that the fraction is expressed in its simplest form, confirming that p and q are relatively prime.
