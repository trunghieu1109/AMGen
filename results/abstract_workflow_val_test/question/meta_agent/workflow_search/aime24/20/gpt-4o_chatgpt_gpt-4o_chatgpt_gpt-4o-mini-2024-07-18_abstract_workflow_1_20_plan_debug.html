    <pre>Related original question:

Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textiteautiful\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textiteautiful\) because \(81  = \underline6 \ \underline3_13 \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt81\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textiteautiful\) integers..

### Sub-task 4: Count the number of b-beautiful numbers for each base b and identify the smallest base b for which there are more than ten such numbers. 

 ### thinking #3 by Debate Agent eIFh:
To solve Sub-task 4, we need to determine the smallest base b for which there are more than ten b-beautiful numbers. A b-beautiful number n is defined as a number that can be expressed as a two-digit number in base b, where the sum of its digits equals the square root of n. This means n = a*b + b, where 1 &lt;= a &lt; b and 0 &lt;= b &lt; b, and a + b must equal sqrt(n). We need to iterate over each base starting from b = 2, and for each base, iterate over all possible two-digit numbers in that base. For each combination, calculate n and check if it is a perfect square and if the sum of the digits equals the square root of n. We count how many such numbers exist for each base. The process involves iterating over all possible digit combinations for each base, computing n, and checking the conditions. We continue this process until we find a base where the count of b-beautiful numbers exceeds ten. From the previous analysis, there is a discrepancy between agents suggesting either base 14 or base 16. Typically, the number of possibilities increases more rapidly as the base increases, and the correct answer is more likely to be the smaller of the two proposed bases because it is the first base to reach more than ten b-beautiful numbers. Therefore, the smallest base b for which there are more than ten b-beautiful numbers is 14.

We continue this process until we find a base where the count of b-beautiful numbers exceeds ten. Based on the analysis of the problem and the outputs from the previous sub-tasks, it appears that base 14 is the smallest base for which there are more than ten b-beautiful numbers. This conclusion is drawn from the typical behavior of number systems and the rapid increase in possibilities as the base increases. Therefore, the smallest base b for which there are more than ten b-beautiful numbers is 14.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Make final decision on the smallest base b. 

 then justify completely and detailedly why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. Again, your task is only to answer the question Sub-task 4: Make final decision on the smallest base b. and explaination.
If the output require generate `code`, ensure that the final output is stored in variable `result`. 
Eg: 
     
```python           
def calculator(...):
    
    return ...

result = calculator(...)
```
