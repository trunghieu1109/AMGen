Question: Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.

In base b, a two-digit number can be written as 'ab', where a and b are the digits. The value of this number in base 10 is a*b + b. For n to be b-beautiful, the sum of the digits a and b must equal the square root of n. Therefore, the conditions are: 1) n must be expressible as a two-digit number in base b, meaning n = a*b + b where 0 <= a < b and 0 <= b < b. 2) The sum of the digits a + b must equal sqrt(n).; answer: A number n is b-beautiful if it can be expressed as a two-digit number in base b, say 'ab', where the digits a and b satisfy 0 <= a < b and 0 <= b < b, and the sum of the digits a + b equals the square root of n.\nCoT-SC agent RoMt, determining range for two-digit numbers, thinking: In base b, a two-digit number is represented as 'ab', where a is the most significant digit and b is the least significant digit. The value of this number in base 10 is a*b + b. For a two-digit number in base b, the digit a can range from 1 to b-1 (since a=0 would make it a one-digit number), and the digit b can range from 0 to b-1. Therefore, the smallest two-digit number in base b is when a=1 and b=0, which is 1*b + 0 = b. The largest two-digit number is when a=b-1 and b=b-1, which is (b-1)*b + (b-1) = b^2 - 1.

Second, the iteration over all possible two-digit numbers in base b can be computationally expensive for large bases, as the number of combinations increases. Additionally, the approach does not take into account the possibility of multiple combinations leading to the same n, which could affect the count of b-beautiful numbers.
