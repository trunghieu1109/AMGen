    <pre>Related original question:

Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textiteautiful\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textiteautiful\) because \(81  = \underline6 \ \underline3_13 \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt81\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textiteautiful\) integers..

### Sub-task 8: Derive the final answer by confirming the smallest base found in the previous stage. 

 ### thinking by Debate Agent nRfj:
The task requires confirming the smallest base from the previous analysis where more than ten b-beautiful numbers exist. A b-beautiful number is defined as a number that has exactly two digits in base b, and the sum of these digits equals the square root of the number. In the previous stages, the analysis involved iterating through bases starting from 2 and counting the number of b-beautiful numbers for each base. Base 14 was identified as the smallest base with more than ten b-beautiful numbers. This was verified by checking all possible two-digit numbers in base 14 and ensuring that the sum of the digits equals the integer square root of the number. The function used in the analysis confirmed that base 14 meets the criteria, making it the correct answer. Therefore, the final answer is 14.

A b-beautiful number in base b is defined as a number that has exactly two digits in base b, and the sum of these digits equals the square root of the number. The previous stages involved iterating over possible bases and counting the number of b-beautiful numbers for each base. It was determined that base 14 is the smallest base where the count of b-beautiful numbers exceeds ten. This was verified by a function that checked all possible two-digit combinations in each base and ensured that the digit sum equals the integer square root of the number. The analysis confirmed that base 14 meets the criteria, and this conclusion was reached consistently by multiple agents. Thus, the final answer is confirmed to be 14.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 8: Make final decision on the smallest base. 

 then justify completely and detailedly why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. Again, your task is only to answer the question Sub-task 8: Make final decision on the smallest base. and explaination.
If the output require generate `code`, ensure that the final output is stored in variable `result`. 
Eg: 
     
```python           
def calculator(...):
    
    return ...

result = calculator(...)
```

    <pre>The task is to determine the smallest base b for which there are more than ten b-beautiful numbers. A b-beautiful number is defined as a number that has exactly two digits in base b, and the sum of these digits equals the square root of the number. The analysis involved checking each base starting from 2 and counting the number of b-beautiful numbers. For each base, we consider numbers of the form &#39;ab&#39; in base b, where a and b are digits, and the number is a*b + b. The sum of the digits a + b should equal the integer square root of the number. The analysis found that base 14 is the smallest base with more than ten b-beautiful numbers. This was verified by checking all possible two-digit numbers in base 14 and ensuring that the sum of the digits equals the integer square root of the number. Therefore, the final decision is that the smallest base is 14.
