### Sub-task 6: Calculate the maximum value of the real part of the expression. 

 ### thinking by Debate Agent AjoJ:
To calculate the maximum value of the real part of the expression 300cos(θ) - 1044sin(θ) + 1.5, we recognize that the expression can be rewritten in the form Rcos(θ + φ), where R is the amplitude. The maximum value of Rcos(θ + φ) is R. The amplitude R is given by the formula R = √(a² + b²), where a = 300 and b = -1044. Therefore, we calculate R = √(300² + (-1044)²). After calculating this value, we add the constant term 1.5 to get the maximum real part of the expression. Calculating √(300² + (-1044)²) gives √(90000 + 1089536) = √1179536 = 1086. Thus, the maximum real part of the expression is 1086 + 1.5.

### thinking by Debate Agent uvk1:
To find the maximum value of the real part of the expression 300cos(θ) - 1044sin(θ) + 1.5, we must maximize the term 300cos(θ) - 1044sin(θ). This is a linear combination of cos(θ) and sin(θ), which can be rewritten in the form Rcos(θ + φ), where R is the amplitude of the resultant vector. The maximum value of Rcos(θ + φ) is R. To find R, we use the formula R = √(a² + b²), where a and b are the coefficients of cos(θ) and sin(θ) respectively. Here, a = 300 and b = -1044. Therefore, R = √(300² + (-1044)²). After calculating R, we add the constant term 1.5 to get the maximum real part of the expression. Calculating √(300² + (-1044)²) gives us √(90000 + 1089536) = √1179536 = 1086. Therefore, the maximum real part is 1086 + 1.5.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Make a final decision on the maximum real part. 

 then justify completely and detailedly why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. Again, your task is only to answer the question Sub-task 6: Make a final decision on the maximum real part. and explaination.
If the output require generate `code`, ensure that the final output is stored in variable `result`. 
Eg: 
     
```python           
def calculator(...):
    
    return ...

result = calculator(...)
```

    <pre>Both agents AjoJ and uvk1 have correctly identified the method to find the maximum real part of the expression. They both recognize that the expression 300cos(θ) - 1044sin(θ) + 1.5 can be rewritten in the form Rcos(θ + φ), where R is the amplitude. The maximum value of Rcos(θ + φ) is R, which is calculated as R = √(a² + b²) with a = 300 and b = -1044. They both calculated R = √(300² + (-1044)²) = √1179536 = 1086. Adding the constant term 1.5 gives the maximum real part as 1086 + 1.5 = 1087. Both agents agree on this calculation, and their reasoning is sound. Therefore, the final decision on the maximum real part is 1087.
