This implies n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p^2). For a prime p, if n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p^2), then n^8 ≡ 1 (mod p^2). This suggests that the order of n modulo p^2 must divide 8. However, since n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p^2), n^8 ≡ 1 (mod p^2) is automatically satisfied. The key is to find the smallest prime p such that there exists an n satisfying n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p^2). For small primes, we can test whether such an n exists by checking small values of n. The smallest prime p for which n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2 is p = 5, as for p = 5, n = 3 satisfies 3^4 + 1 = 81 + 1 = 82, which is divisible by 25 (5^2).; answer: The expression n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2 if there exists an n such that n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p^2).
