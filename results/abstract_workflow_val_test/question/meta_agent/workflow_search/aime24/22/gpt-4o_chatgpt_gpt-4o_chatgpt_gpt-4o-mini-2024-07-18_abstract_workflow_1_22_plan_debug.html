    <pre>Related original question:

A list of positive integers has the following properties:
$\bullet$ The sum of the items in the list is $30$.
$\bullet$ The unique mode of the list is $9$.
$\bullet$ The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.
Find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list..

### Sub-task 5: Calculate the sum of the squares of all the items in the constructed list. 

 ### thinking #3 by Debate Agent A9nY:
The constructed list that satisfies all the given conditions is [9, 9, 1, 2, 5, 4]. To calculate the sum of the squares of all the items in this list, we need to square each element individually and then sum those squares. The squares of the elements are: 9^2 = 81, 9^2 = 81, 1^2 = 1, 2^2 = 4, 5^2 = 25, and 4^2 = 16. Adding these squared values gives us 81 + 81 + 1 + 4 + 25 + 16 = 208. Therefore, the sum of the squares of all the items in the list is 208.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 5: Make final decision on sum of squares. 

 then justify completely and detailedly why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. Again, your task is only to answer the question Sub-task 5: Make final decision on sum of squares. and explaination.
If the output require generate `code`, ensure that the final output is stored in variable `result`. 
Eg: 
     
```python           
def calculator(...):
    
    return ...

result = calculator(...)
```

    <pre>Both agents have independently verified the list [9, 9, 1, 2, 5, 4] satisfies all the given conditions: the sum is 30, the unique mode is 9, and the median is 3, which is not in the list. They both calculated the sum of squares as 208 by squaring each element and summing them: 9^2 + 9^2 + 1^2 + 2^2 + 5^2 + 4^2 = 81 + 81 + 1 + 4 + 25 + 16 = 208. Therefore, the final decision on the sum of squares is 208.
