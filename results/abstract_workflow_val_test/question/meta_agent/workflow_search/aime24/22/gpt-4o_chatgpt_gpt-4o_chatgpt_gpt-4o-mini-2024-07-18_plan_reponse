        "response": "Both agents have independently verified the list [9, 9, 1, 2, 5, 4] satisfies all the given conditions: the sum is 30, the unique mode is 9, and the median is 3, which is not in the list. They both calculated the sum of squares as 208 by squaring each element and summing them: 9^2 + 9^2 + 1^2 + 2^2 + 5^2 + 4^2 = 81 + 81 + 1 + 4 + 25 + 16 = 208. Therefore, the final decision on the sum of squares is 208.\n\nAnswer:208",

        "response": "To calculate the sum of the squares of the numbers in the list [9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 8, 2], we need to square each element and then sum these squares. The calculations are as follows: 9^2 = 81, 9^2 = 81, 9^2 = 81, 1^2 = 1, 1^2 = 1, 8^2 = 64, and 2^2 = 4. Adding these squared values gives the total sum: 81 + 81 + 81 + 1 + 1 + 64 + 4 = 313. This confirms the correct sum of squares.\n\nAnswer:313",
