Question: A list of positive integers has the following properties:
$\bullet$ The sum of the items in the list is $30$.
$\bullet$ The unique mode of the list is $9$.
$\bullet$ The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.
Find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

proposed answer: Both agents have independently verified the list [9, 9, 1, 2, 5, 4] satisfies all the given conditions: the sum is 30, the unique mode is 9, and the median is 3, which is not in the list. They both calculated the sum of squares as 208 by squaring each element and summing them: 9^2 + 9^2 + 1^2 + 2^2 + 5^2 + 4^2 = 81 + 81 + 1 + 4 + 25 + 16 = 208. Therefore, the final decision on the sum of squares is 208.

proposed answer: To calculate the sum of the squares of the numbers in the list [9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 8, 2], we need to square each element and then sum these squares. The calculations are as follows: 9^2 = 81, 9^2 = 81, 9^2 = 81, 1^2 = 1, 1^2 = 1, 8^2 = 64, and 2^2 = 4. Adding these squared values gives the total sum: 81 + 81 + 81 + 1 + 1 + 64 + 4 = 313. This confirms the correct sum of squares.
