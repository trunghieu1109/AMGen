        "response": "Both Debate Agents oRde and lHmD have independently verified that there are 10 distinct grid configurations that satisfy the given conditions. Each configuration is a unique arrangement of digits in the 2x3 grid such that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right equals 999, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom equals 99. The conditions a + d = 9, b + e = 9, and c + f = 9 are satisfied in each configuration. Since both agents agree on the count and the configurations are distinct, the final decision on the number of valid configurations is 10.\n\nAnswer:10",

        "response": "Both agents have executed the code provided in Sub-task 4 and have independently verified that the number of valid configurations is 8. The code iterates through all possible values for the digits a, b, and c, calculates the corresponding digits d, e, and f to satisfy the row sum constraint (abc + def = 999), and checks the column sum constraint (10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99). The code ensures that def is a valid 3-digit number, and both agents have confirmed that there are 8 valid configurations that meet all the constraints. Therefore, the final decision on the number of valid configurations is 8.\n\nAnswer:8",
