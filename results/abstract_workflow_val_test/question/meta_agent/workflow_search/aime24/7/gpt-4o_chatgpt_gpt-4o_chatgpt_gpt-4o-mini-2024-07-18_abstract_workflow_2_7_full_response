To find consistent values for x and y, we substitute x = y^{9/4} into the expression for y. This gives us y = 10^{(10 \\log(y^{9/4}))/y^{9/4}}. Simplifying, \\log(y^{9/4}) = (9/4)\\log(y), so the expression becomes y = 10^{(90 \\log(y))/(4y^{9/4})}. For this to hold, the exponent must equal \\log(y), leading to the equation (90/4y^{9/4}) = 1, which simplifies to y^{9/4} = 22.5. Solving for y gives y = (22.5)^{4/9}. Then, using x = y^{9/4}, we find x = 22.5. Thus, xy = x \\cdot y = 22.5 \\cdot (22.5)^{4/9} = (22.5)^{13/9}. However, the question asks for an integer value of xy.
