Using the properties of exponents, this simplifies to xy = 9^{1 + 4/9} = 9^{13/9}. This is the correct product of x and y, as it follows directly from the values of x and y determined in the sub-tasks. The calculations are consistent with the given conditions and the rules of exponents.\n\nAnswer:9^{13/9}",

Therefore, the product xy is calculated as 100 * 10. This product satisfies both original logarithmic equations, as \\( \\log_{100}(10^{100}) = 10 \\) and \\( \\log_{10}(100^4 \\cdot 10) = 10 \\). Thus, the product xy is 1000.\n\nAnswer:1000",
