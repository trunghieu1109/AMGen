In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.",

        "response": "We start by recognizing that every resident in Aimeville already owns a candy hearts bag; hence, the only additional items we are tracking are the diamond ring, golf clubs, and garden spade. This allows us to partition the residents into four distinct groups based on how many of these three extra items they have: (1) those who own only the candy hearts bag (i.e., zero extra items), (2) those with candy hearts plus exactly one extra item, (3) those with candy hearts plus exactly two extra items, and (4) those with candy hearts plus all three extra items. According to the problem, 437 residents have exactly two overall items. Since the candy hearts bag is always included, these 437 residents possess exactly one extra item. Likewise, 234 residents have exactly three overall items, which means they possess exactly two extra items. If we let x be the number who have all three extra items (and thus own all four items), then the number of residents owning only candy hearts is the remainder: 900 - (437 + 234 + x), which simplifies to (229 - x).\n\nTo refine our calculation further, we consider the total counts for the extra items. The problem provides that 195 residents own a diamond ring, 367 own a set of golf clubs, and 562 own a garden spade. Adding these gives us a total of 1124 extra items. Alternatively, we can calculate the total extra items contributed by each group based on the number of items they add: those with one extra item contribute 1 item each (437 residents yield 437 items), those with two extra items contribute 2 items each (234 residents yield 468 items), and those with three extra items contribute 3 items each (x residents yield 3x items). Setting these equal gives the equation:\n\n\u2003\u2003437 + 468 + 3x = 1124\n\nCombining the known numbers yields 905 + 3x = 1124. Subtracting 905 from both sides leads to 3x = 219, and dividing both sides by 3 results in x = 73.\n\nThus, after meticulously accounting for each group's contribution and ensuring that our calculations match the totals provided, we conclude that 73 residents own all four items, including the candy hearts bag. This refined calculation uses the given information, partitions the residents coherently, and directly equates the contributions to the overall totals, thereby confirming that the final answer is correct.\n\nAnswer:73",
