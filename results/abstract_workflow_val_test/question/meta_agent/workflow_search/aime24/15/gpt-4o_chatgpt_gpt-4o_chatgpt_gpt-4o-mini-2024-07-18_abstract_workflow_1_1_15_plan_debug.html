    <pre>Related original question:

Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things..

### Sub-task 5: Calculate the number of residents who own all four items by considering the total number of residents and those owning all three items. 

 ### thinking #3 by Debate Agent zNwi:
To determine the number of residents who own all four items (diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and bag of candy hearts), we need to consider the relationship between those owning exactly three items and the universally owned bag of candy hearts. The problem states that 234 residents own exactly three of the four items, which includes the candy hearts. Since every resident owns a bag of candy hearts, those who own exactly three of the four items must own the diamond ring, golf clubs, and garden spade. Therefore, these 234 residents already meet the condition of owning all three specific items plus the universally owned candy hearts, meaning they own all four items. Hence, the number of residents who own all four items is 234.

To calculate the number of residents who own all four items (diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and bag of candy hearts), we need to consider the data provided. The problem states that 234 residents own exactly three of the four items, which includes the universally owned bag of candy hearts. Since every resident owns a bag of candy hearts, owning exactly three of the four items means these residents own the diamond ring, golf clubs, and garden spade.
