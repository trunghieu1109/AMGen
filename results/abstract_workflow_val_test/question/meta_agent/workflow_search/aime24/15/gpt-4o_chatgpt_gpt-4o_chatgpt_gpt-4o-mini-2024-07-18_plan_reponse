In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.",

        "response": "From Sub-task 5, we know that 234 residents own all three items: diamond ring, golf clubs, and garden spade. The problem states that every resident of Aimeville owns a bag of candy hearts. Therefore, any resident who owns the three items (diamond ring, golf clubs, and garden spade) automatically owns all four items when including the candy hearts. Thus, the number of residents who own all four items is the same as those who own the three items, which is 234.\n\nAnswer:234",

        "response": "The problem states that there are 234 residents who own exactly three of the four items, which includes the universally owned bag of candy hearts. Since every resident owns a bag of candy hearts, owning exactly three of the four items means these residents own the diamond ring, golf clubs, and garden spade. Therefore, these 234 residents already meet the condition of owning all three specific items plus the universally owned candy hearts, which means they own all four items. Thus, the number of residents who own all four items is 234.\n\nAnswer:234",
