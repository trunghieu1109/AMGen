    <pre>Related original question:

Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations:
\[\log_2\left(x \over yz\right) = 1 \over 2\]\[\log_2\left(y \over xz\right) = 1 \over 3\]\[\log_2\left(z \over xy\right) = 1 \over 4\]
Then the value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\tfracmn$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 6: Determine the values of m and n such that |log2(x^4y^3z^2)| = m/n and m and n are relatively prime. 

 ### thinking #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent P9wX:
From the previous sub-tasks, we have determined that |log2(x^4y^3z^2)| = 13/4. The fraction 13/4 is already in its simplest form, meaning that the numerator and the denominator are relatively prime. Therefore, m = 13 and n = 4. The critical evaluations confirm that the determination of m and n is correct, assuming the previous calculations were accurate. Thus, m = 13 and n = 4 is the correct answer.

### answer #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent P9wX:
m = 13, n = 4

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 7: Calculate m+n to provide the final answer to the query. 

 then justify completely and detailedly why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. Again, your task is only to answer the question Sub-task 7: Calculate m+n to provide the final answer to the query. and explaination.
If the output require generate `code`, ensure that the final output is stored in variable `result`. 
Eg: 
     
```python           
def calculator(...):
    
    return ...

result = calculator(...)
```
