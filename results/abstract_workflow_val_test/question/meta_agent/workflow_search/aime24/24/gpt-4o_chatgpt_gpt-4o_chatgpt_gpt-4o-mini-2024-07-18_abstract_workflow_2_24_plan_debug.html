    <pre>Related original question:

Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations:
\[\log_2\left(x \over yz\right) = 1 \over 2\]\[\log_2\left(y \over xz\right) = 1 \over 3\]\[\log_2\left(z \over xy\right) = 1 \over 4\]
Then the value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\tfracmn$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$..

 ### thinking #3 by Debate Agent WuAQ:
To determine the absolute value of \( \log_2(x^4y^3z^2) \), we start by using the previously calculated values for \( x, y, \) and \( z \). From the given solutions, we have \( x = 2^{1/3}, y = 2^{1/4}, \) and \( z = 2^{1/6} \). We need to calculate \( x^4y^3z^2 \). Calculating each power, we get: \( x^4 = (2^{1/3})^4 = 2^{4/3} \), \( y^3 = (2^{1/4})^3 = 2^{3/4} \), and \( z^2 = (2^{1/6})^2 = 2^{1/3} \). Thus, \( x^4y^3z^2 = 2^{4/3} \cdot 2^{3/4} \cdot 2^{1/3} \). Adding the exponents, we find: \( 4/3 + 3/4 + 1/3 \). To add these fractions, we find a common denominator, which is 12. Therefore, \( 4/3 = 16/12 \), \( 3/4 = 9/12 \), and \( 1/3 = 4/12 \). Adding these gives \( 16/12 + 9/12 + 4/12 = 29/12 \). Therefore, \( x^4y^3z^2 = 2^{29/12} \), and \( \log_2(x^4y^3z^2) = 29/12 \). Since this value is positive, its absolute value is the same, \( \left|\frac{29}{12}\right| = \frac{29}{12} \). The fraction \( \frac{29}{12} \) is already in simplest form, as 29 and 12 have no common divisors other than 1. Thus, \( m = 29 \) and \( n = 12 \), making them relatively prime. Therefore, \( m + n = 29 + 12 = 41 \).

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 7: Calculate m + n from the fraction m/n obtained in subtask 6. 

 then justify completely and detailedly why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. Again, your task is only to answer the question Sub-task 7: Calculate m + n from the fraction m/n obtained in subtask 6. and explaination.
If the output require generate `code`, ensure that the final output is stored in variable `result`. 
Eg: 
     
```python           
def calculator(...):
    
    return ...

result = calculator(...)
```

    <pre>In sub-task 6, we determined that the absolute value of \( \log_2(x^4y^3z^2) \) is \( \frac{29}{12} \), where \( m = 29 \) and \( n = 12 \). These values are relatively prime, meaning they have no common divisors other than 1. The task in sub-task 7 is to calculate \( m + n \). Since \( m = 29 \) and \( n = 12 \), we simply add these two numbers together to get \( m + n = 29 + 12 = 41 \).
