Question: Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations:
\[\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}\]\[\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}\]\[\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}\]
Then the value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.
Iteration: abstract_workflow_1_1_24
proposed answer: From the previous sub-task, we have determined that |log2(x^4y^3z^2)| = 13/4, where m = 13 and n = 4. These values are already in their simplest form, meaning that m and n are relatively prime. To find the final answer to the query, we need to calculate m + n. Therefore, m + n = 13 + 4 = 17.

proposed answer: In sub-task 6, we determined that the absolute value of \( \log_2(x^4y^3z^2) \) is \( \frac{29}{12} \), where \( m = 29 \) and \( n = 12 \). These values are relatively prime, meaning they have no common divisors other than 1. The task in sub-task 7 is to calculate \( m + n \). Since \( m = 29 \) and \( n = 12 \), we simply add these two numbers together to get \( m + n = 29 + 12 = 41 \).
