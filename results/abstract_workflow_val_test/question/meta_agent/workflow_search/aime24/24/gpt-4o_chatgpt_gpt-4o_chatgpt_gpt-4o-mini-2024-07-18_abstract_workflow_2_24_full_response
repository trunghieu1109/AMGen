From the given solutions, we have \\( x = 2^{1/3}, y = 2^{1/4}, \\) and \\( z = 2^{1/6} \\). We need to calculate \\( x^4y^3z^2 \\). Calculating each power, we get: \\( x^4 = (2^{1/3})^4 = 2^{4/3} \\), \\( y^3 = (2^{1/4})^3 = 2^{3/4} \\), and \\( z^2 = (2^{1/6})^2 = 2^{1/3} \\). Thus, \\( x^4y^3z^2 = 2^{4/3} \\cdot 2^{3/4} \\cdot 2^{1/3} \\). Adding the exponents, we find: \\( 4/3 + 3/4 + 1/3 \\). To add these fractions, we find a common denominator, which is 12. Therefore, \\( 4/3 = 16/12 \\), \\( 3/4 = 9/12 \\), and \\( 1/3 = 4/12 \\). Adding these gives \\( 16/12 + 9/12 + 4/12 = 29/12 \\). Therefore, \\( x^4y^3z^2 = 2^{29/12} \\), and \\( \\log_2(x^4y^3z^2) = 29/12 \\). Since this value is positive, its absolute value is the same, \\( \\left|\\frac{29}{12}\\right| = \\frac{29}{12} \\). The fraction \\( \\frac{29}{12} \\) is already in simplest form, as 29 and 12 have no common divisors other than 1. Thus, \\( m = 29 \\) and \\( n = 12 \\), making them relatively prime. Therefore, \\( m + n = 29 + 12 = 41 \\).\n\n### answer #3 by Debate Agent WuAQ:\n41\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 7: Calculate m + n from the fraction m/n obtained in subtask 6. \n\n then justify completely and detailedly why you think so in the "thinking" entry.
