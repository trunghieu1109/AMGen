Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: In sub-task 7, the difference r_i - r_o was simplified to sqrt(85) - 2, which was expressed as a fraction 81/9. However, this simplification is incorrect because sqrt(85) - 2 cannot be expressed as a simple fraction with integer numerator and denominator. The correct approach is to express the difference as a fraction in its simplest form. The expression sqrt(85) - 2 was incorrectly simplified to 81/9, which is not valid. The correct fraction form should be determined by rationalizing the expression. The expression sqrt(85) - 2 can be rationalized as (sqrt(85) - 2) * (sqrt(85) + 2) / (sqrt(85) + 2) = (85 - 4) / (sqrt(85) + 2) = 81 / (sqrt(85) + 2). This fraction cannot be simplified further to integers m and n that are relatively prime. Therefore, the previous answer of m = 81 and n = 9 is incorrect. The correct m and n should be determined from the simplest form of the expression. Since the expression sqrt(85) - 2 cannot be expressed as a simple fraction with integer numerator and denominator, the previous answer of m + n = 90 is incorrect. The correct m and n should be determined from the simplest form of the expression, which is not possible in this case. Therefore, the previous answer of m + n = 90 is incorrect.

Answer:The previous answer of m + n = 90 is incorrect because sqrt(85) - 2 cannot be expressed as a simple fraction with integer numerator and denominator.
Extracted answer: The previous answer of m + n = 90 is incorrect because sqrt(85) - 2 cannot be expressed as a simple fraction with integer numerator and denominator.

proposed answer: In sub-task 8, the difference in radii was expressed as a fraction 1/3. The numerator of this fraction is 1, and the denominator is 3. To find the sum of the numerator and denominator, we simply add these two numbers together: 1 + 3 = 4. Therefore, the sum of the numerator and denominator of the fraction 1/3 is 4.
