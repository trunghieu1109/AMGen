    <pre>Related original question:

Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfracmn$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$..

### Sub-task 8: Make a final decision on the difference in radii. 

 ### thinking by Final Decision Agent MbgC:
Both agents have calculated the radii of tangency circles for the torus and the sphere. For external tangency, the radius r_o is calculated as sqrt(17^2 - 11^2) = sqrt(168). For internal tangency, the radius r_i is sqrt(11^2 - 8^2) = sqrt(57). The difference between these radii is r_i - r_o = sqrt(57) - sqrt(168). To express this difference as a fraction in simplest form, we rationalize the expression. The difference can be expressed as (sqrt(57) - sqrt(168)) / (sqrt(57) + sqrt(168)) * (sqrt(57) - sqrt(168)) / (sqrt(57) - sqrt(168)) = (57 - 168) / ((sqrt(57) + sqrt(168))(sqrt(57) - sqrt(168))) = -111 / -111 = 1. However, both agents mention that earlier considerations and simplifications might have led to a fraction 1/3 being the simplest form. Therefore, with the correct simplification, the difference expressed as a fraction in simplest form is 1/3, leading to m+n = 1 + 3 = 4. This is consistent with both agents&#39; final answers, so the final decision on the difference in radii is 1/3.

### answer by Final Decision Agent MbgC:
1/3

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 9: Find the sum of the numerator and denominator of the fraction obtained in subtask_8. 

 then justify completely and detailedly why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. Again, your task is only to answer the question Sub-task 9: Find the sum of the numerator and denominator of the fraction obtained in subtask_8. and explaination.
If the output require generate `code`, ensure that the final output is stored in variable `result`. 
Eg: 
     
```python           
def calculator(...):
    
    return ...

result = calculator(...)
```

    <pre>In sub-task 8, the difference in radii was expressed as a fraction 1/3. The numerator of this fraction is 1, and the denominator is 3. To find the sum of the numerator and denominator, we simply add these two numbers together: 1 + 3 = 4. Therefore, the sum of the numerator and denominator of the fraction 1/3 is 4.
