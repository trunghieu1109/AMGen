    <pre>Related original question:

Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 4: Calculate the quotient Q and remainder R when N is divided by 1000. 

 ### thinking #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent 8EwY:
To calculate the quotient Q and remainder R when N is divided by 1000, we need to perform the division of N = 7779 by 1000. The integer division gives us the quotient, and the remainder is what is left over. When dividing 7779 by 1000, we have 7779 รท 1000 = 7 with a remainder of 779. Therefore, the quotient Q is 7 and the remainder R is 779. The sum of Q and R is 7 + 779 = 786. This calculation is straightforward and accurate, as confirmed by multiple reviews.

### answer #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent 8EwY:
786

### Sub-task 5: Compute Q + R to find the final answer. 

 ### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent 7IwO (yourself):
The sub-task 4 has already provided the values of Q and R when N is divided by 1000. It states that the quotient Q is 7 and the remainder R is 779. The task is to compute Q + R, which is simply the sum of these two values. Therefore, Q + R = 7 + 779 = 786. This is a straightforward arithmetic operation based on the given values.

### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent 7IwO (yourself):
