Question: Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.
Iteration: abstract_workflow_1_1_27
proposed answer: The sub-task 4 has already provided the values of Q and R when N is divided by 1000. It states that the quotient Q is 7 and the remainder R is 779. The task is to compute Q + R, which is simply the sum of these two values. Therefore, Q + R = 7 + 779 = 786. This is a straightforward arithmetic operation based on the given values. The computation is complete and correct, as confirmed by the review. There are no limitations in this computation as it is a simple addition of two integers.

Iteration: abstract_workflow_1_27
proposed answer: Both agents have provided consistent answers for Q + R, which is 844. They both used the results from Sub-task 3 and Sub-task 4, where Q was found to be 9 and R was found to be 835. The sum of these two values is 844. The reasoning is straightforward and involves simple addition, which is correct based on the given values for Q and R. Therefore, the final decision on Q + R is 844.
