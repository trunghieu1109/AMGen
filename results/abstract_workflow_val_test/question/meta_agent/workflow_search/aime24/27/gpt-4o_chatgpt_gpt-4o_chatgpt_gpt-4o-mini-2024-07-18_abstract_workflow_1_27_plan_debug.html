    <pre>Related original question:

Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 5: Compute Q + R using the results from subtask_3 and subtask_4. 

 ### thinking #3 by Debate Agent Xucm:
To compute Q + R, we need to use the results from Sub-task 3 and Sub-task 4. From Sub-task 3, we found that the quotient Q when N is divided by 1000 is 9. From Sub-task 4, we found that the remainder R when N is divided by 1000 is 835. Therefore, the sum Q + R is simply 9 + 835. This involves basic arithmetic addition, which is straightforward and directly follows from the given values for Q and R. The calculation is consistent with the division properties and correct based on the provided results.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent 6sHO:
To compute Q + R, we use the results from Sub-task 3 and Sub-task 4. Sub-task 3 determined the quotient Q when N is divided by 1000 to be 9. Sub-task 4 determined the remainder R when N is divided by 1000 to be 835. Therefore, Q + R is the sum of these two values: 9 + 835. This is a straightforward addition problem, and the result is 844. The calculation is consistent with the division properties and correct based on the given values for Q and R.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 5: Make final decision on Q + R. 

 then justify completely and detailedly why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. Again, your task is only to answer the question Sub-task 5: Make final decision on Q + R. and explaination.
If the output require generate `code`, ensure that the final output is stored in variable `result`. 
Eg: 
     
```python           
def calculator(...):
    
    return ...

result = calculator(...)
```

    <pre>Both agents have provided consistent answers for Q + R, which is 844. They both used the results from Sub-task 3 and Sub-task 4, where Q was found to be 9 and R was found to be 835. The sum of these two values is 844. The reasoning is straightforward and involves simple addition, which is correct based on the given values for Q and R. Therefore, the final decision on Q + R is 844.
