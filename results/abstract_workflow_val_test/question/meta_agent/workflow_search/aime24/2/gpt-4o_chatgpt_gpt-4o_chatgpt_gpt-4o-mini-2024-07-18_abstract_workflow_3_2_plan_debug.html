    <pre>Related original question:

Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\tfracmn$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?.

### Sub-task 5: Based on the output of Sub-task 4, express the probability as a fraction in simplest form and find the sum of the numerator and denominator. 

 ### thinking #3 by Debate Agent Z5hw:
In Sub-task 4, we calculated the probability of valid colorings as 70/256. We simplified this fraction to 35/128 by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2. Since 35 and 128 have no common divisors other than 1, the fraction 35/128 is already in its simplest form. Therefore, the sum of the numerator and denominator is 35 + 128 = 163. This confirms that the probability is correctly expressed in simplest form, and the sum of the numerator and denominator is accurate.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent 0SH6:
The probability of the valid colorings is given as 70/256, which simplifies to 35/128. This fraction is already in its simplest form since 35 and 128 have no common divisors other than 1. Therefore, the sum of the numerator and denominator in the simplest form is 35 + 128 = 163. This matches the output from Sub-task 4, confirming that the probability is expressed correctly and the sum is accurate.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 5: Make final decision on the sum of the numerator and denominator. 

 then justify completely and detailedly why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. Again, your task is only to answer the question Sub-task 5: Make final decision on the sum of the numerator and denominator. and explaination.
If the output require generate `code`, ensure that the final output is stored in variable `result`. 
Eg: 
     
```python           
def calculator(...):
    
    return ...

result = calculator(...)
```

    <pre>Both agents have calculated the probability of valid colorings as 70/256, which simplifies to 35/128. They both agree that 35/128 is in its simplest form because 35 and 128 have no common divisors other than 1. Therefore, the sum of the numerator and denominator is 35 + 128 = 163. Since both agents independently arrived at the same conclusion and the reasoning is sound, the final decision on the sum of the numerator and denominator is 163.
