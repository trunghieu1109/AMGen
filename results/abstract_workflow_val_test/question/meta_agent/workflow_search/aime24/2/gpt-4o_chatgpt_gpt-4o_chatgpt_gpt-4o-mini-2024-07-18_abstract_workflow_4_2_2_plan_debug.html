    <pre>Related original question:

Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\tfracmn$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 7: Make a final decision on the probability. 

 ### thinking by Final Decision Agent QI04:
Both agents have calculated the probability using Burnside&#39;s Lemma, which is a method to count the number of distinct objects under symmetry. The total number of ways to color the vertices of the octagon is 2^8 = 256. The octagon has 8 rotational symmetries. For each rotation, we determine the number of colorings that remain unchanged. The identity rotation leaves all 256 colorings unchanged. For a 45-degree rotation, only the colorings where all vertices are the same color remain unchanged, giving 2 such colorings. For a 90-degree rotation, pairs of opposite vertices must be the same color, resulting in 16 invariant colorings. The same logic applies to other rotations. By summing the invariant colorings for each rotation and averaging, we find the total number of valid colorings. Both agents agree that the probability is 1/2, which is consistent with the calculations. Therefore, the final decision on the probability is 1/2, where m = 1 and n = 2, and m+n = 3.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 8: Compute the sum m+n for the final answer. 

 then justify completely and detailedly why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. Again, your task is only to answer the question Sub-task 8: Compute the sum m+n for the final answer. and explaination.
If the output require generate `code`, ensure that the final output is stored in variable `result`. 
Eg: 
     
```python           
def calculator(...):
    
    return ...

result = calculator(...)
```

    <pre>The final decision on the probability was determined to be 1/2, which corresponds to the fraction \( \frac{m}{n} \) where \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 2 \). These values are relatively prime, meaning they have no common divisors other than 1. Therefore, the sum \( m+n \) is \( 1+2 = 3 \). This is consistent with the calculations and the use of Burnside&#39;s Lemma to determine the probability. Thus, the final answer for the sum \( m+n \) is 3.
