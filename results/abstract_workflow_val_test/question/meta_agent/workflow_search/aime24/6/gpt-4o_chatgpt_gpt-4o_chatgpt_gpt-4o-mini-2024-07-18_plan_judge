Question: Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.
Iteration: abstract_workflow_1_1_6
proposed answer: In sub-task 4, the value of r^2 was determined to be \( \frac{889}{36} \). This fraction is already in its simplest form, meaning that the numerator 889 and the denominator 36 are relatively prime. Therefore, we can directly identify p = 889 and q = 36. To find p + q, we simply add these two numbers together: 889 + 36 = 925. This matches the answer provided in sub-task 4, confirming that the calculation is correct.

Iteration: abstract_workflow_2_6
proposed answer: In sub-task 4, the square of the radius was expressed as the fraction \( \frac{549}{16} \), where \( p = 549 \) and \( q = 16 \). These values are relatively prime, meaning they have no common divisors other than 1. The problem asks for the sum of \( p \) and \( q \), which is calculated as \( 549 + 16 \). Therefore, the sum of \( p \) and \( q \) is 565.
