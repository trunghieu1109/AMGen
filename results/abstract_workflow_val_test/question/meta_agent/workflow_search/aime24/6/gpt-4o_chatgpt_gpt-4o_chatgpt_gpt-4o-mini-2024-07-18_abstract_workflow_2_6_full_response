The square of the radius is \\( r^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{137.25}}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{137.25}{4} \\). We need to express 137.25 as a fraction. Since 137.25 is equivalent to \\( \\frac{13725}{100} \\), we have \\( r^2 = \\frac{13725}{400} \\). Simplifying this fraction, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 25. This gives us \\( \\frac{549}{16} \\). Therefore, \\( p = 549 \\) and \\( q = 16 \\) are relatively prime, and the answer is \\( p + q = 549 + 16 = 565 \\). The fraction form \\( \\frac{549}{16} \\) is correct and simplified, as 549 and 16 are relatively prime.

Let the dimensions of the box be x, y, and z. The surface area is given by 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54, and the volume is given by xyz = 23. We need to find all possible sets of (x, y, z) that satisfy these equations. We can start by expressing one variable in terms of the others using the volume equation, say z = 23/(xy), and substitute this into the surface area equation to get 2(xy + y(23/(xy)) + x(23/(xy))) = 54. Simplifying this equation will help us find the possible values for x, y, and z.; answer: The dimensions of the rectangular boxes are (1, 2, 11.5) and permutations thereof.\nCoT-SC agent hoyJ, calculating diagonal, thinking: To calculate the diagonal of a rectangular box with dimensions x, y, and z, we use the formula for the space diagonal, which is given by the square root of the sum of the squares of the dimensions: d = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}. From the sub-task 1, we have the dimensions (1, 2, 11.5).
