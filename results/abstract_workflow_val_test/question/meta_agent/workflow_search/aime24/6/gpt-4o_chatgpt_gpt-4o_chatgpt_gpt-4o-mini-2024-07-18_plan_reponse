        "response": "In sub-task 4, the value of r^2 was determined to be \\( \\frac{889}{36} \\). This fraction is already in its simplest form, meaning that the numerator 889 and the denominator 36 are relatively prime. Therefore, we can directly identify p = 889 and q = 36. To find p + q, we simply add these two numbers together: 889 + 36 = 925. This matches the answer provided in sub-task 4, confirming that the calculation is correct.\n\nAnswer:925",

These values are relatively prime, meaning they have no common divisors other than 1. The problem asks for the sum of \\( p \\) and \\( q \\), which is calculated as \\( 549 + 16 \\).
