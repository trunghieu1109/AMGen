    <pre>Related original question:

Let $\mathcalB$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcalB$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\fracpq$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 4: Express the square of the radius in the form of a fraction p/q and ensure p and q are relatively prime. 

 ### thinking #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent 50s5:
To express the square of the radius in the form of a fraction \( \frac{p}{q} \), we start with the radius \( r = \frac{\sqrt{137.25}}{2} \). The square of the radius is \( r^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{137.25}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{137.25}{4} \). We need to express 137.25 as a fraction. Since 137.25 is equivalent to \( \frac{13725}{100} \), we have \( r^2 = \frac{13725}{400} \). Simplifying this fraction, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 25. This gives us \( \frac{549}{16} \). Therefore, \( p = 549 \) and \( q = 16 \) are relatively prime, and the answer is \( p + q = 549 + 16 = 565 \). The fraction form \( \frac{549}{16} \) is correct and simplified, as 549 and 16 are relatively prime. The calculation of \( r^2 = \frac{13725}{400} \) and its simplification to \( \frac{549}{16} \) is accurate.

### answer #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent 50s5:
565

### Sub-task 5: Calculate the sum of p and q from the fraction obtained in subtask 4. 

 ### thinking #2 by Debate Agent JYVF (yourself):
In sub-task 4, the square of the radius was expressed as the fraction \( \frac{549}{16} \), where \( p = 549 \) and \( q = 16 \). These values are relatively prime, meaning they have no common divisors other than 1. The problem asks for the sum of \( p \) and \( q \), which is calculated as \( 549 + 16 \). Therefore, the sum of \( p \) and \( q \) is 565.

### thinking #2 by Debate Agent CwKV:
In Sub-task 4, it was determined that the square of the radius can be expressed as the fraction \( \frac{549}{16} \), where \( p = 549 \) and \( q = 16 \). These two numbers are relatively prime. The problem asks us to find the sum of \( p \) and \( q \), which is \( 549 + 16 \). Therefore, the sum of \( p \) and \( q \) is 565.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 5: Calculate the sum of p and q from the fraction obtained in subtask 4. 

 then justify completely and detailedly why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. Again, your task is only to answer the question Sub-task 5: Calculate the sum of p and q from the fraction obtained in subtask 4. and explaination.
