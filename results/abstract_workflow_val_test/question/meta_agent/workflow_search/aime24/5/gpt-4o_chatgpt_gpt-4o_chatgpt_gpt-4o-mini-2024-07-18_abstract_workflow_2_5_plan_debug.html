    <pre>Related original question:

Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt41$, $AC=BD= \sqrt80$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt89$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\fracm \sqrt np$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$..

### Sub-task 5: Express the inradius in the form m * sqrt(n) / p and ensure m and p are relatively prime, and n is not divisible by the square of any prime. 

 ### thinking #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent REzs:
The inradius of the tetrahedron was calculated to be 5. To express this in the form m * sqrt(n) / p, we recognize that 5 can be written as 5 * sqrt(1) / 1. Here, m = 5, n = 1, and p = 1. These values satisfy the conditions: m and p are relatively prime, and n = 1 is not divisible by the square of any prime. Therefore, the expression is already in the desired form. The sum m + n + p = 5 + 1 + 1 = 7.

### answer #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent REzs:

### Sub-task 6: Calculate m + n + p from the expression obtained in subtask 5. 

 ### thinking #2 by Debate Agent cIjj (yourself):
In sub-task 5, the inradius of the tetrahedron was expressed as 5 * sqrt(1) / 1, with m = 5, n = 1, and p = 1. The task in sub-task 6 is to calculate the sum m + n + p. Since these values satisfy the conditions (m and p are relatively prime, and n is not divisible by the square of any prime), we simply add them: m + n + p = 5 + 1 + 1 = 7. This calculation is straightforward as it involves simple addition of the integers m, n, and p obtained from the expression.

### thinking #2 by Debate Agent nfr6:
In sub-task 5, the inradius of the tetrahedron was expressed as 5 * sqrt(1) / 1, where m = 5, n = 1, and p = 1. The task in sub-task 6 is to calculate the sum m + n + p using these values. Since m = 5, n = 1, and p = 1, the sum is calculated as m + n + p = 5 + 1 + 1. The calculation involves straightforward addition of these integers.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Calculate m + n + p from the expression obtained in subtask 5. 

 then justify completely and detailedly why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. Again, your task is only to answer the question Sub-task 6: Calculate m + n + p from the expression obtained in subtask 5. and explaination.
If the output require generate `code`, ensure that the final output is stored in variable `result`. 
Eg: 
     
```python           
def calculator(...):
    
    return ...

result = calculator(...)
