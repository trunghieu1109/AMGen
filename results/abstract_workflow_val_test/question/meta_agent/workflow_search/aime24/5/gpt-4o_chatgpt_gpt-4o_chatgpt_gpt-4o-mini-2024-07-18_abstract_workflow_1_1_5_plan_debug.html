    <pre>Related original question:

Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt41$, $AC=BD= \sqrt80$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt89$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\fracm \sqrt np$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 5: Express the inradius in the form m * sqrt(n) / p and ensure m and p are relatively prime, and n is square-free. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent HOJP:
The inradius of the tetrahedron has already been calculated as \( \frac{6 \sqrt{2}}{7} \). This expression is already in the form \( m \cdot \sqrt{n} / p \) where \( m = 6 \), \( n = 2 \), and \( p = 7 \). We need to ensure that \( m \) and \( p \) are relatively prime, and \( n \) is square-free. In this case, 6 and 7 are relatively prime since their greatest common divisor is 1. The number 2 is square-free because it is not divisible by the square of any prime. Therefore, the expression \( \frac{6 \sqrt{2}}{7} \) is already in the desired form, satisfying all the conditions. Thus, the values are \( m = 6 \), \( n = 2 \), and \( p = 7 \).

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent HOJP:
6 * sqrt(2) / 7

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Calculate the sum m + n + p from the expression obtained in Stage 2. 

 then justify completely and detailedly why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. Again, your task is only to answer the question Sub-task 6: Calculate the sum m + n + p from the expression obtained in Stage 2. and explaination.
If the output require generate `code`, ensure that the final output is stored in variable `result`.

```python           
def calculator(...):

    <pre>From the expression obtained in Stage 2, we have the inradius of the tetrahedron as \( \frac{6 \sqrt{2}}{7} \). This is in the form \( m \cdot \sqrt{n} / p \) where \( m = 6 \), \( n = 2 \), and \( p = 7 \). We need to calculate the sum \( m + n + p \). Substituting the values, we get \( 6 + 2 + 7 = 15 \). Therefore, the sum is 15.
