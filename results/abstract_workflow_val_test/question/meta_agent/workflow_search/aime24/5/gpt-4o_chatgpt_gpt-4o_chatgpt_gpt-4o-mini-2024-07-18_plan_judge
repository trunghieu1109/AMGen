Question: Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.

proposed answer: From the expression obtained in Stage 2, we have the inradius of the tetrahedron as \( \frac{6 \sqrt{2}}{7} \). This is in the form \( m \cdot \sqrt{n} / p \) where \( m = 6 \), \( n = 2 \), and \( p = 7 \). We need to calculate the sum \( m + n + p \). Substituting the values, we get \( 6 + 2 + 7 = 15 \). Therefore, the sum is 15.

proposed answer: In sub-task 5, the inradius of the tetrahedron was expressed as 5 * sqrt(1) / 1, with m = 5, n = 1, and p = 1. The task in sub-task 6 is to calculate the sum m + n + p. Since these values satisfy the conditions (m and p are relatively prime, and n is not divisible by the square of any prime), we simply add them: m + n + p = 5 + 1 + 1 = 7. This calculation is straightforward as it involves simple addition of the integers m, n, and p obtained from the expression.
