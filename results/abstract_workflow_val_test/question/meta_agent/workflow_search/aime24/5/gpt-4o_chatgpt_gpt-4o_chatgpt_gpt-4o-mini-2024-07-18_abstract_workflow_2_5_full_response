To find the volume of the tetrahedron, we can use the formula for the volume of a tetrahedron with given side lengths. The formula for the volume \\(V\\) of a tetrahedron with vertices \\(A, B, C, D\\) is given by \\(V = \\frac{1}{6} \\sqrt{4a^2b^2c^2 - a^2p^2 - b^2q^2 - c^2r^2 + pqr}\\), where \\(a, b, c\\) are the side lengths of one face (e.g., \\(AB, AC, BC\\)), and \\(p, q, r\\) are the sums of the squares of the opposite edges (e.g., \\(p = AD^2 + BD^2 + CD^2\\), \\(q = AB^2 + BD^2 + AD^2\\), \\(r = AB^2 + AC^2 + BC^2\\)).
