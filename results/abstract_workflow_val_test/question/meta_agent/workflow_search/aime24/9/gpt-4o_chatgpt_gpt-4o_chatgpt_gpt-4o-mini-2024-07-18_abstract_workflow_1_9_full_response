From Sub-task 5, the probability of winning the grand prize is 1/210. From Sub-task 4, the probability of winning a prize is 47/70. Therefore, the conditional probability is (1/210) / (47/70). Simplifying this, we get (1/210) * (70/47) = 1/141. Thus, the probability of winning the grand prize given that a prize is won is 1/141.
