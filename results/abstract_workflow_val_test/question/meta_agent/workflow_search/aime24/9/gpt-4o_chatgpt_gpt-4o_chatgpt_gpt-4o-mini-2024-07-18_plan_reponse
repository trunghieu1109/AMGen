The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.",

        "response": "In Sub-task 6, the probability of winning the grand prize given that a prize is won was calculated as 1/141. This fraction is already in its simplest form, as 1 and 141 have no common divisors other than 1. Therefore, the numerator m is 1 and the denominator n is 141. The sum of the numerator and denominator is m + n = 1 + 141 = 142. This matches the answer provided in Sub-task 6, confirming that the fraction is in simplest form and the sum is correct.\n\nAnswer:142",

        "response": "From Sub-task 6, we have the probability of winning the grand prize given that a prize is won as 1/141. This fraction is already in its simplest form, meaning m = 1 and n = 141. Since m and n are relatively prime, we can directly calculate m + n = 1 + 141 = 142. Therefore, the answer to Sub-task 7 is 142.\n\nAnswer:142",
