Question: Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.
Iteration: abstract_workflow_2_9
proposed answer: In Sub-task 6, the probability of winning the grand prize given that a prize is won was calculated as 1/141. This fraction is already in its simplest form, as 1 and 141 have no common divisors other than 1. Therefore, the numerator m is 1 and the denominator n is 141. The sum of the numerator and denominator is m + n = 1 + 141 = 142. This matches the answer provided in Sub-task 6, confirming that the fraction is in simplest form and the sum is correct.

proposed answer: From Sub-task 6, we have the probability of winning the grand prize given that a prize is won as 1/141. This fraction is already in its simplest form, meaning m = 1 and n = 141. Since m and n are relatively prime, we can directly calculate m + n = 1 + 141 = 142. Therefore, the answer to Sub-task 7 is 142.
