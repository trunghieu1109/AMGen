From Sub-task 4, we know that the probability of winning a prize (P(B)) is 47/70. From Sub-task 5, the probability of winning the grand prize (P(A ∩ B)) is 1/210. Therefore, the probability of winning the grand prize given that a prize is won is (1/210) / (47/70). Simplifying this gives (1/210) * (70/47) = 1/141. This fraction is already in its simplest form, so m = 1 and n = 141, making m+n = 142.\n\n### answer #3 by Debate Agent aQPr:\n142\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 7: Express the probability from subtask_6 as a fraction in simplest form and find the sum of the numerator and denominator. \n\n then justify completely and detailedly why you think so in the "thinking" entry.

Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S, and the lottery also picks 4 distinct numbers from S. She wins a prize if at least 2 of her numbers match the lottery's numbers. We can break this into cases: Case 1: Exactly 2 numbers match. Case 2: Exactly 3 numbers match. Case 3: All 4 numbers match. For each case, we calculate the number of ways it can occur. Case 1: Choose 2 numbers from Jen's 4 to match (C(4, 2)) and choose 2 non-matching numbers from the remaining 6 numbers (C(6, 2)).

The correct approach is to find the probability of winning the grand prize given that she has won a prize, which involves conditional probability.; answer: The probability of winning the grand prize given that she has won a prize is not simply 1/210. It requires considering the number of ways to win the grand prize (which is 1) and the number of ways to win a prize (which includes having at least 2 numbers match).
