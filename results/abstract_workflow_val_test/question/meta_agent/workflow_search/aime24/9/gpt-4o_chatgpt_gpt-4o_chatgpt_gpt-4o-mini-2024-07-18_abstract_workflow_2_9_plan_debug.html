    <pre>Related original question:

Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfracmn$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$..

### Sub-task 6: Based on the outputs from Sub-task 4 and Sub-task 5, calculate the probability of winning the grand prize given that a prize is won using conditional probability. 

 ### thinking #3 by Debate Agent aQPr:
To calculate the probability of winning the grand prize given that a prize is won, we use the formula for conditional probability: P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B), where A is the event of winning the grand prize, and B is the event of winning a prize. From Sub-task 4, we know that the probability of winning a prize (P(B)) is 47/70. From Sub-task 5, the probability of winning the grand prize (P(A ∩ B)) is 1/210. Therefore, the probability of winning the grand prize given that a prize is won is (1/210) / (47/70). Simplifying this gives (1/210) * (70/47) = 1/141. This fraction is already in its simplest form, so m = 1 and n = 141, making m+n = 142.

### answer #3 by Debate Agent aQPr:

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 7: Express the probability from subtask_6 as a fraction in simplest form and find the sum of the numerator and denominator. 

 then justify completely and detailedly why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. Again, your task is only to answer the question Sub-task 7: Express the probability from subtask_6 as a fraction in simplest form and find the sum of the numerator and denominator. and explaination.
If the output require generate `code`, ensure that the final output is stored in variable `result`. 
Eg: 
     
```python           
def calculator(...):
    
    return ...

result = calculator(...)
```

    <pre>In Sub-task 6, the probability of winning the grand prize given that a prize is won was calculated as 1/141. This fraction is already in its simplest form, as 1 and 141 have no common divisors other than 1. Therefore, the numerator m is 1 and the denominator n is 141. The sum of the numerator and denominator is m + n = 1 + 141 = 142. This matches the answer provided in Sub-task 6, confirming that the fraction is in simplest form and the sum is correct.
