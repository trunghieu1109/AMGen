    <pre>Related original question:

Eight circles of radius $34$ are sequentially tangent, and two of the circles are tangent to $AB$ and $BC$ of triangle $ABC$, respectively. $2024$ circles of radius $1$ can be arranged in the same manner. The inradius of triangle $ABC$ can be expressed as $\fracmn$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$..

### Sub-task 5: Make final decision on inradius. 

 ### thinking by Final Decision Agent U4E3:
Both agents have calculated the inradius of triangle ABC to be 272 by considering the arrangement of the circles. They analyzed two configurations: one with eight circles of radius 34 and another with 2024 circles of radius 1. In both cases, the total length of the chain of circles is related to the inradius. For the circles of radius 34, the total length is 8 * 34 * 2 = 544, and for the circles of radius 1, the total length is 2024 * 1 * 2 = 4048. Since the inradius is the same for both configurations, they equated these lengths to twice the inradius: 2r = 544 = 4048. Solving for r gives r = 272. Therefore, the inradius of the triangle is 272. This consistent reasoning and calculation by both agents supports the decision that the inradius is indeed 272.

### answer by Final Decision Agent U4E3:
272

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Express the inradius in the form m/n where m and n are relatively prime, and find m+n. 

 then justify completely and detailedly why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. Again, your task is only to answer the question Sub-task 6: Express the inradius in the form m/n where m and n are relatively prime, and find m+n. and explaination.
If the output require generate `code`, ensure that the final output is stored in variable `result`. 
Eg: 
     
```python           
def calculator(...):
    
    return ...

result = calculator(...)
```

    <pre>The inradius of the triangle ABC has been determined to be 272. To express this in the form m/n where m and n are relatively prime, we note that 272 is already an integer. Therefore, we can express it as 272/1, where m = 272 and n = 1. Since 272 and 1 are relatively prime (the greatest common divisor is 1), this is the simplest form. Thus, m = 272 and n = 1, and m+n = 272 + 1 = 273.
