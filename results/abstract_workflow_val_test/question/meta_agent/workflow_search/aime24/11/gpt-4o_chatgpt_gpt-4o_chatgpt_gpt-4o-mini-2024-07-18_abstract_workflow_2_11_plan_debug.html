Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.
[asy] size(10cm); usepackage(&#34;tikz&#34;);label(&#34;egintikzpicture[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(2,0)--(2,3)--(5,3)--(5,8)--(8,8);\endtikzpicture&#34;,origin); label(&#34;\begintikzpicture[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(0,3)--(3,3)--(3,5)--(8,5)--(8,8);\endtikzpicture&#34;,E); [/asy].

 ### thinking #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent 4be5:
To count the number of valid sequences that satisfy all conditions, we need to consider paths on an 8x8 grid that have exactly 4 direction changes and a total path length of 16. Each path must consist of 8 horizontal (H) moves and 8 vertical (V) moves. A direction change occurs when the path switches from H to V or V to H. With 4 direction changes, the path can be divided into 5 segments. The path can start with either horizontal or vertical moves, and the sequence of segments can be H-V-H-V-H or V-H-V-H-V. For the H-V-H-V-H sequence, let the horizontal segments be of lengths a, b, and c, and the vertical segments be of lengths d and e. We have the equations a + b + c = 8 and d + e = 8. The number of ways to partition 8 into 3 parts (a, b, c) is given by the stars and bars method as C(8+2, 2) = C(10, 2) = 45. Similarly, the number of ways to partition 8 into 2 parts (d, e) is C(8+1, 1) = C(9, 1) = 9. Therefore, the total number of valid sequences for H-V-H-V-H is 45 * 9 = 405. For the V-H-V-H-V sequence, let the vertical segments be of lengths a, b, and c, and the horizontal segments be of lengths d and e. We have the equations a + b + c = 8 and d + e = 8. The number of ways to partition 8 into 3 parts (a, b, c) is 45, and the number of ways to partition 8 into 2 parts (d, e) is 9. Therefore, the total number of valid sequences for V-H-V-H-V is also 405. Adding these two cases together, the total number of valid sequences is 405 + 405 = 810. This approach correctly accounts for all possible sequences of direction changes and ensures that the total number of moves in each direction sums to the required number of moves to traverse the grid.

### answer #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent 4be5:
810

### Sub-task 6: Compile the count of valid sequences into the final result representing the number of paths that change direction exactly four times. 

 ### thinking #2 by Debate Agent HnBZ (yourself):
The task requires compiling the count of valid sequences into the final result that represents the number of paths changing direction exactly four times. From Sub-task 5, it was determined that there are 810 valid sequences of moves on an 8x8 grid that change direction exactly four times. These sequences were counted for two patterns: H-V-H-V-H and V-H-V-H-V, each contributing 405 sequences. Therefore, the final result is the sum of these sequences, which is 810. This count includes all possible configurations of paths that satisfy the given conditions.

### thinking #2 by Debate Agent Ux5I:
The sub-task involves compiling the count of valid sequences into the final result for paths that change direction exactly four times on an 8x8 grid. From the previous calculations, it was determined that there are 810 valid sequences satisfying these conditions. This total includes paths that follow either the H-V-H-V-H or V-H-V-H-V pattern, each contributing 405 sequences. Thus, the final result for the number of paths that change direction exactly four times is simply the sum of these sequences, which is 810.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Compile the count of valid sequences into the final result representing the number of paths that change direction exactly four times. 

 then justify completely and detailedly why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. Again, your task is only to answer the question Sub-task 6: Compile the count of valid sequences into the final result representing the number of paths that change direction exactly four times. and explaination.
If the output require generate `code`, ensure that the final output is stored in variable `result`. 
Eg: 
     
```python           
def calculator(...):
    
    return ...

result = calculator(...)
```
