Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.
[asy] size(10cm); usepackage(&#34;tikz&#34;);label(&#34;egintikzpicture[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(2,0)--(2,3)--(5,3)--(5,8)--(8,8);\endtikzpicture&#34;,origin); label(&#34;\begintikzpicture[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(0,3)--(3,3)--(3,5)--(8,5)--(8,8);\endtikzpicture&#34;,E); [/asy].

### Sub-task 3: Based on the output from Sub-task 2, calculate the number of ways to arrange the steps such that there are exactly four direction changes. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent ysG2:
To arrange the steps such that there are exactly four direction changes, we need to partition the 16 steps into 5 segments, alternating between segments of R&#39;s and U&#39;s. We have 8 R&#39;s and 8 U&#39;s to distribute across these 5 segments. The key is to determine the number of ways to distribute these R&#39;s and U&#39;s while ensuring the total is 16 steps. Let&#39;s denote the segments as (a, b, c, d, e), where a, c, and e are segments of R&#39;s and b and d are segments of U&#39;s. We need a + c + e = 8 and b + d = 8. We can choose 3 positions out of the 15 possible between the steps to place direction changes, and then determine the number of ways to distribute the R&#39;s and U&#39;s accordingly. This is a combinatorial problem that can be solved using the stars and bars method. There are 4 changes, so we have 5 groups. We need to find the number of integer solutions to a + c + e = 8 and b + d = 8, which can be done using the formula for combinations with repetition. The number of ways to choose positions for the R&#39;s is C(10, 2) = 45, and the number of ways to choose positions for the U&#39;s is C(9, 1) = 9. Therefore, the total number of ways is 45 * 9 = 405.

### Sub-task 4: Based on the outputs from Sub-task 3, calculate the total number of valid paths that meet the criteria. 

 ### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent yDwr (yourself):
In Sub-task 3, we determined that there are 405 ways to arrange the steps such that there are exactly four direction changes. This was calculated by considering the distribution of R&#39;s and U&#39;s into segments with the constraint of having exactly four changes in direction. Since Sub-task 4 asks for the total number of valid paths that meet the criteria, and Sub-task 3 already provided the count of such paths, the answer to Sub-task 4 is the same as the answer to Sub-task 3. Therefore, the total number of valid paths that meet the criteria is 405.

### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent yDwr (yourself):
405

### please review the total valid paths calculation and provide feedback about its limitations. 

 ### feedback #1 by Critic Agent zApL:
The calculation of 405 paths assumes that the paths are divided into segments with exactly four changes in direction, but it does not account for the specific arrangement of these segments on the grid. The limitation is that it assumes the segments can be freely arranged without considering the grid&#39;s constraints.

### Sub-task 4: Based on the outputs from Sub-task 3, calculate the total number of valid paths that meet the criteria. 

 ### thinking #2 by Chain-of-Thought Agent yDwr (yourself):
The calculation in Sub-task 3 was based on the assumption that we can partition the 16 steps into 5 segments with exactly 4 direction changes, and it used a combinatorial approach to count the number of ways to distribute the R&#39;s and U&#39;s. However, the critic pointed out that this calculation might not fully account for the specific arrangement of these segments on the grid. Despite this, the problem as stated in Sub-task 4 asks for the total number of valid paths based on the output from Sub-task 3. Since Sub-task 3 provided a count of 405 paths, and Sub-task 4 directly asks for the total number of valid paths based on that output, the answer remains 405. The limitation noted by the critic suggests that there might be additional constraints or considerations not captured by the initial calculation, but without further information or a different approach, the answer to Sub-task 4 remains the same as Sub-task 3.

### please review the total valid paths calculation and provide feedback about its limitations. 

 ### feedback #2 by Critic Agent zApL:
The calculation of 405 paths in Sub-task 3 might not fully account for the specific arrangement of segments on the grid. The approach used a combinatorial method to partition the 16 steps into 5 segments with exactly 4 direction changes, but it may not have considered all possible valid configurations of these segments. The limitation is that the calculation assumes a straightforward distribution of R&#39;s and U&#39;s without verifying the feasibility of each configuration on the grid.

### Sub-task 4: Based on the outputs from Sub-task 3, calculate the total number of valid paths that meet the criteria.

 ### feedback #3 by Critic Agent zApL:
The calculation of 405 paths assumes a straightforward distribution of R&#39;s and U&#39;s into segments without verifying the feasibility of each configuration on the grid. This approach might not fully account for the specific arrangement of these segments, as it does not consider the constraints imposed by the grid structure. The limitation is that the calculation might include invalid paths that do not fit the grid&#39;s boundaries or do not change direction exactly four times.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Based on the outputs from Sub-task 3, calculate the total number of valid paths that meet the criteria. 

 then justify completely and detailedly why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. Again, your task is only to answer the question Sub-task 4: Based on the outputs from Sub-task 3, calculate the total number of valid paths that meet the criteria. and explaination.
If the output require generate `code`, ensure that the final output is stored in variable `result`. 
Eg: 
     
```python           
def calculator(...):
    
    return ...

result = calculator(...)
