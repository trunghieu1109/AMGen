    <pre>Related original question:

Let ABCDEF be a convex equilateral hexagon in which all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle whose sides are extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. Find the side length of the hexagon.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 5: Validate the calculated side length of the hexagon by checking consistency with all given conditions (equilateral, opposite sides parallel, and triangle side lengths). 

 ### thinking #3 by Debate Agent OdKb:
To validate the calculated side length of the hexagon, we need to confirm that it satisfies all the given conditions: the hexagon is equilateral, all pairs of opposite sides are parallel, and the extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF form a triangle with side lengths 200, 240, and 300. The side lengths of the triangle are in the ratio 5:6:7, which implies a proportional relationship with the hexagon&#39;s sides. The hexagon being a parallelohexagon means opposite sides are parallel and equal. The side length of the hexagon, deduced as 20, is a common factor of the triangle&#39;s side lengths (200, 240, and 300), which supports the proportionality and geometric configuration. This side length maintains the equilateral and parallel properties of the hexagon, thereby confirming the consistency of the solution. Therefore, the side length of 20 satisfies all the given conditions.

### answer #3 by Debate Agent OdKb:
20

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Integrate the validated side length into the final answer format. 

 then justify completely and detailedly why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. Again, your task is only to answer the question Sub-task 6: Integrate the validated side length into the final answer format. and explaination.
If the output require generate `code`, ensure that the final output is stored in variable `result`. 
Eg: 
     
```python           
def calculator(...):
    
    return ...

result = calculator(...)
```

    <pre>The validated side length of the hexagon is 20, as determined in the previous sub-task. To integrate this into the final answer format, we simply state the side length of the hexagon as the final answer. The problem asks for the side length of the hexagon, and we have confirmed that 20 satisfies all the conditions given in the problem: the hexagon is equilateral, opposite sides are parallel, and the extensions of segments form a triangle with the specified side lengths. Therefore, the final answer is the side length of the hexagon, which is 20.
