Question: There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\times5$ grid such that: 

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.
Iteration: abstract_workflow_3_29
proposed answer: The problem involves placing indistinguishable white and black chips on a 5x5 grid such that each row and column is monochromatic, and any additional chip would violate this condition. The solution requires calculating the number of ways to choose k rows and k columns to be filled with white chips, with the remaining rows and columns filled with black chips. This is done by summing the product of binomial coefficients for choosing k rows and k columns from 5, for k ranging from 0 to 5. The sum is \( \sum_{k=0}^{5} \binom{5}{k} \cdot \binom{5}{k} \), which evaluates to 252. This calculation is correct and consistent with the conditions given in the problem.

proposed answer: To determine the total number of valid configurations for placing the chips, we need to consider the constraints: each row and column must be filled entirely with one color or be empty, and the grid must be filled such that no additional chip can be added without violating these constraints. We have 25 white chips and 25 black chips, and a 5x5 grid, which means we must fill exactly half the grid with white chips and the other half with black chips. This implies that we must fill 5 rows with white chips and 5 rows with black chips, and similarly for columns. The key is to realize that the number of white rows must equal the number of white columns, and similarly for black, to ensure the grid is completely filled. We can choose any subset of k rows to be filled with white chips, and the remaining rows will be filled with black chips. Similarly, we can choose any subset of k columns to be filled with white chips, and the remaining columns will be filled with black chips. The number of ways to choose a subset of k rows to be filled with white chips is \( \binom{5}{k} \), and the number of ways to choose a subset of k columns to be filled with white chips is \( \binom{5}{k} \) for the same k, where k is the number of white rows and columns. Therefore, the total number of valid configurations is the sum of \( \binom{5}{k}^2 \) for \( k = 0 \) to \( 5 \). This gives us \( \sum_{k=0}^{5} \binom{5}{k}^2 = 1^2 + 5^2 + 10^2 + 10^2 + 5^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 25 + 100 + 100 + 25 + 1 = 252 \).
