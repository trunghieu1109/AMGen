Question: Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.

proposed answer: Both agents have correctly identified that the number of values of n where Bob can guarantee a win is determined by counting the multiples of 5 up to 2020. The sequence of multiples of 5 is an arithmetic sequence starting at 5 with a common difference of 5. The last multiple of 5 less than or equal to 2024 is 2020. Using the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence, we find that the number of terms is 404. Therefore, there are 404 values of n where Bob has a winning strategy.

Answer:404
Extracted answer: 404
Correct answer: 809

proposed answer: To synthesize the results and provide a final answer to the query, we need to ensure that the strategy and conditions have been correctly applied. The game involves Alice and Bob taking turns to remove 1 or 4 tokens, with Alice going first. Bob can guarantee a win if he can always leave Alice in a losing position. From the analysis, a losing position for Alice is when the number of tokens is a multiple of 5. Therefore, Bob can guarantee a win if the initial number of tokens is not a multiple of 5. We calculated that there are 404 multiples of 5 up to 2024, meaning there are 2024 - 404 = 1620 numbers that are not multiples of 5. Thus, there are 1620 positive integers n less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob can guarantee a win. This confirms that the strategy and conditions have been correctly applied.

Answer:1620
