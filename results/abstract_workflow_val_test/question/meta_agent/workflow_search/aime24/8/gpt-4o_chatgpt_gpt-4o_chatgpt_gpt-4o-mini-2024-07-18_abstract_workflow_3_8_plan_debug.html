    <pre>Related original question:

Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alices play..

### Sub-task 6: Derive the final answer by counting the number of values of n from the intermediate output where Bob can guarantee a win. 

 ### thinking by Debate Agent cwJd:
To determine the number of values of n where Bob can guarantee a win, we need to count the number of multiples of 5 from the intermediate output. The sequence of multiples of 5 from 5 to 2020 is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 5. The first term is 5 and the last term is 2020. We can find the number of terms in this sequence using the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence, which is a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d, where a_1 is the first term, d is the common difference, and a_n is the nth term. Solving for n, we have: 2020 = 5 + (n-1)5, which simplifies to 2020 = 5n. Solving for n gives n = 404. Therefore, there are 404 values of n where Bob has a winning strategy.

### thinking by Debate Agent 9kRT:
To find the number of values of n where Bob can guarantee a win, we need to count the multiples of 5 from the list in the intermediate output. The sequence of multiples of 5 between 5 and 2020 is an arithmetic sequence with the first term a_1 = 5 and the common difference d = 5. The nth term of this sequence is given by a_n = 5n. We need to find the number of terms n such that 5n &lt;= 2020. Solving for n, we have 2020 = 5n, which simplifies to n = 404. Therefore, there are 404 multiples of 5 from 5 to 2020 inclusive. This means there are 404 values of n where Bob has a winning strategy.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Make final decision on final answer. 

 then justify completely and detailedly why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. Again, your task is only to answer the question Sub-task 6: Make final decision on final answer. and explaination.
If the output require generate `code`, ensure that the final output is stored in variable `result`. 
Eg: 
     
```python           
def calculator(...):
    
    return ...

result = calculator(...)
```

    <pre>Both agents have correctly identified that the number of values of n where Bob can guarantee a win is determined by counting the multiples of 5 up to 2020. The sequence of multiples of 5 is an arithmetic sequence starting at 5 with a common difference of 5. The last multiple of 5 less than or equal to 2024 is 2020. Using the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence, we find that the number of terms is 404. Therefore, there are 404 values of n where Bob has a winning strategy.
