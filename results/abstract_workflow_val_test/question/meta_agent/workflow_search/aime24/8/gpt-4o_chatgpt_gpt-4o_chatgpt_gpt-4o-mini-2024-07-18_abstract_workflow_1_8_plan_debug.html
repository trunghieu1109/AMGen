    <pre>Related original question:

Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alices play..

### Sub-task 4: Count the number of positive integers n less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob can guarantee a win using the strategy developed in sub-task 3. 

 ### thinking #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent D404:
To determine the number of positive integers n less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob can guarantee a win, we need to identify the positions where Bob can force Alice into a losing position. From the strategy developed, we know that Bob can guarantee a win if the initial number of tokens is not a multiple of 5. This is because if the number of tokens is a multiple of 5, Alice can always leave Bob with a multiple of 5, putting him in a losing position. Therefore, we need to count the number of integers up to 2024 that are not multiples of 5. The multiples of 5 up to 2024 are 5, 10, 15, ..., 2020. The largest multiple of 5 less than or equal to 2024 is 2020, which is 5 times 404. Thus, there are 404 multiples of 5 up to 2024. The total number of positive integers up to 2024 is 2024. Therefore, the number of integers that are not multiples of 5 is 2024 - 404 = 1620. This means there are 1620 positions where Bob can guarantee a win.

### answer #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent D404:

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 5: Synthesize the results to provide a final answer to the query, ensuring that all conditions and strategies have been correctly applied. 

 then justify completely and detailedly why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. Again, your task is only to answer the question Sub-task 5: Synthesize the results to provide a final answer to the query, ensuring that all conditions and strategies have been correctly applied. and explaination.
If the output require generate `code`, ensure that the final output is stored in variable `result`. 
Eg: 
     
```python           
def calculator(...):
    
    return ...

result = calculator(...)

    <pre>To synthesize the results and provide a final answer to the query, we need to ensure that the strategy and conditions have been correctly applied. The game involves Alice and Bob taking turns to remove 1 or 4 tokens, with Alice going first. Bob can guarantee a win if he can always leave Alice in a losing position. From the analysis, a losing position for Alice is when the number of tokens is a multiple of 5. Therefore, Bob can guarantee a win if the initial number of tokens is not a multiple of 5. We calculated that there are 404 multiples of 5 up to 2024, meaning there are 2024 - 404 = 1620 numbers that are not multiples of 5. Thus, there are 1620 positive integers n less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob can guarantee a win. This confirms that the strategy and conditions have been correctly applied.
