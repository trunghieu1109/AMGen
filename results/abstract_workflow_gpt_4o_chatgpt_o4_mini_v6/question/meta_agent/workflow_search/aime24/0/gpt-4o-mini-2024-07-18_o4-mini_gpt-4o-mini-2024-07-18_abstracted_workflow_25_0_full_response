Question: Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.

Solve for s: distance = 9 km, so 9/s + t/60 = 4 ⇒ 9/s = 4 - t/60 ⇒ s = 9/(4 - t/60).; answer: s = 9/(4 - t/60) kilometers per hour\nCoT agent lDHK, calculating speed s + 2, thinking: Let walking times be (240−t) and (144−t) minutes. From 9/s=(240−t)/60 and 9/(s+2)=(144−t)/60 solve for s: 4s^2+8s−45=0 ⇒ s=2.5. Hence s+2=4.5 km/h.; answer: 4.5\nCoT agent mZSK, setting up equations for t, thinking: From 9/s hours walking plus t/60 hours coffee = 4 hours, we get t=60(4−9/s). From 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4 hours, we get t=60(2.4−9/(s+2)). Equating them yields 4−9/s = 2.4−9/(s+2).; answer: t = 60(4 - 9/s) and t = 60(2.4 - 9/(s+2))\nCoT agent 82aF, solving equations for s and t, thinking: We set 4 − 9/s = 2.4 − 9/(s+2). Multiply both sides by s(s+2): 1.6 = 18/(s^2+2s) ⇒ s^2+2s = 11.25 ⇒ s = (−2+7)/2 = 2.5 km/h. Then t = 60(4 − 9/2.5) = 24 minutes.; answer: s = 2.5 km/h and t = 24 minutes.\nDebate agent HGec, round 0, calculating time at s + 0.5, thinking: We already determined s = 2.5 km/h and t = 24 minutes. At speed s + 0.5 = 3 km/h, the 9 km walk takes 9/3 = 3 hours = 180 minutes. Including the 24-minute coffee break gives a total of 180 + 24 = 204 minutes.; answer: 204\nDebate agent 0uXS, round 0, calculating time at s + 0.5, thinking: From subtask 4 we have s=2.5 km/h and t=24 minutes. At speed s+0.5=3.0 km/h, walking time is 9/3=3 hours=180 minutes. Including the 24-minute coffee break gives 180+24=204 minutes.; answer: 204\nDebate agent HGec, round 1, calculating time at s + 0.5, thinking: We have s = 2.5 km/h and t = 24 min. At speed s + 0.5 = 3 km/h, walking time = 9 ÷ 3 = 3 hours = 180 minutes.
