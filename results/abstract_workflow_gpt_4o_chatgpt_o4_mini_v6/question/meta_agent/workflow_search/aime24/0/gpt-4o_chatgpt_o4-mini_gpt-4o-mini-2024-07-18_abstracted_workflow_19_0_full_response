Question: Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.

Subtracting gives 540*(1/s - 1/(s+2)) = 96, so s(s+2)=1080/96=11.25. Solve s²+2s−11.25=0 gives s=2.5 km/h.

Walking time is distance/speed, coffee time is t minutes = t/60 hours. For speed s: 9/s + t/60 = 4. For speed s+2: 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4.; answer: 9/s + t/60 = 4; 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4\nCoT agent nZOF, solving equations, thinking: We have equations 9/s + t/60 = 4 and 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4.
