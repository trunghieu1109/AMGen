    <pre>Related original question:

Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop..

### Sub-task 6: Formulate the total time T = 9/(s+0.5) + t/60 substituting the found s and t. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent bQtt:
We have s = 2.5 km/h and t = 24 minutes. Substitute into T = 9/(s+0.5) + t/60: s+0.5 = 3, so 9/3 = 3 hours, plus 24/60 = 0.4 hours, total 3.4 hours.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent bQtt:
T = 9/(2.5 + 0.5) + 24/60 = 9/3 + 0.4 = 3.4 hours.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 7: Convert the total time T from hours to minutes.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
