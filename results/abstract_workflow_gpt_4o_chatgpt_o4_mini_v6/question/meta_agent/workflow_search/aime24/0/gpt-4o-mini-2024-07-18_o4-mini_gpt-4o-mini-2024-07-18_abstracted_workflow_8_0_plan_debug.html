    <pre>Related original question:

Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 5: Set up equations based on the information from subtasks 2 and 4 to solve for s and t. 

 ### thinking #3 by Debate Agent J4j4:
From subtask 2 we have total time at speed s: walking time 9/s plus coffee time t/60 equals 4 hours. From subtask 4 we have total time at speed s+2: walking time 9/(s+2) plus t/60 equals 2.4 hours.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent M2Ks:
We use the total time equations from sub-tasks 2 and 4: walking time plus coffee‐shop time equals the given total times.

### answer #3 by Debate Agent J4j4:
Equation 1: 9/s + t/60 = 4
Equation 2: 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4

### answer #3 by Debate Agent M2Ks:
Equation 1: 9/s + t/60 = 4
Equation 2: 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 5: Make final decision on the time taken for the walk at speed s + 0.5 kilometers per hour, including the time spent in the coffee shop.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>From 9/s + t/60 = 4 and 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4, subtracting gives 540*(2/(s(s+2))) = 96 so s(s+2)=11.25, hence s=2.5 km/h. Then t=240–540/2.5=24 minutes. At speed s+0.5=3 km/h walking time is 9/3=3 h =180 min plus 24 min coffee =204 min.
