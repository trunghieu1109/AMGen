    <pre>Related original question:

Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 7: Formulate walking time when speed is s+0.5: time = 9/(s+0.5) hours. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent dPwW:
We apply the formula time = distance/speed for the walking segment at speed s + 0.5 km/h over 9 km.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent dPwW:
time = 9/(s+0.5) hours

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 8: Convert 9/(s+0.5) hours to minutes, add t, and report total minutes.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
