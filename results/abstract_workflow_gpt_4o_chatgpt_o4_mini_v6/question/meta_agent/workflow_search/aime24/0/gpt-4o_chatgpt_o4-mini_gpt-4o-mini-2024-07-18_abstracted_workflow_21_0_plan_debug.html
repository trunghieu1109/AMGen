    <pre>Related original question:

Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 5: Calculate the time taken for the walk when Aya walks at a speed of s + 1/2 km/h, using the value of s obtained from subtask 4. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent 9pyF:
We have s=2.5 km/h and t=24 minutes from sub-task 4. At speed s+0.5=3.0 km/h, walking time is 9 km ÷ 3 km/h = 3 hours = 180 minutes. Adding t=24 minutes gives a total of 204 minutes.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent 9pyF:
204

### Sub-task 4: Make final decision on the values of s and t. 

 ### thinking by Final Decision Agent N2Cg:
We solve the system 9/s + t/60 = 4 and 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4. Subtracting gives 9/s – 9/(s+2) = 1.6 ⇒ s(s+2) = 11.25 ⇒ s = 2.5 km/h. Substituting into 9/2.5 + t/60 = 4 yields t = 24 minutes.

### answer by Final Decision Agent N2Cg:
s = 2.5 km/h and t = 24 minutes.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Add the time spent in the coffee shop (t) to the walking time calculated in subtask 5 to find the total time spent.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
