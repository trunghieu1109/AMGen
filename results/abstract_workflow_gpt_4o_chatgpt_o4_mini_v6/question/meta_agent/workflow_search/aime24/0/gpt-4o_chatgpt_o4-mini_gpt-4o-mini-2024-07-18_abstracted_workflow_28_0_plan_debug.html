    <pre>Related original question:

Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 3: Determine the time t spent in the coffee shop by using the equations derived from the two scenarios. 

 ### thinking #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent 2PZX:
Let x=t/60 hours. From 9=s(4−x) and 9=(s+2)(2.4−x), eliminate s: (9/(4−x)+2)(2.4−x)=9, giving 5x²−32x+12=0. Its roots are x=0.4 or 6; discard 6 h as too large. Thus x=0.4 h ⇒ t=0.4·60=24 min.

### answer #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent 2PZX:
24

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Calculate the total time Aya takes when walking at speed s+1/2, including the time t spent in the coffee shop.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>First solve for t: from sub-task 3, t=24 minutes (x=0.4h) and s=9/(4−0.4)=2.5 km/h. For speed s+0.5=3 km/h, walking time=9/3=3 h=180 min plus t=24 min gives 204 min.
