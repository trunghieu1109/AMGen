Question: Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.

Then 9/2.5=3.6 so t/60=4−3.6=0.4 ⇒ t=24.; answer: s = 2.5, t = 24\nCritic agent xAem, feedback: The solution is correct. Substituting s=2.5\u2009km/h and t=24\u2009min gives 9/2.5+24/60=3.6+0.4=4\u2009h and 9/4.5+0.4=2+0.4=2.4\u2009h, matching both equations.; correct: Yes\nReflexion CoT agent GkTk, refining solution, thinking: Subtract the second equation from the first: 9/s – 9/(s+2) = 4 – 2.4 = 1.6. Combine fractions: 9[(s+2) – s]/[s(s+2)] = 1.6 ⇒ 18/[s(s+2)] = 1.6 ⇒ s^2 + 2s – 11.25 = 0. Solve: s = [–2 + √(4 + 45)]/2 = (–2 + 7)/2 = 2.5. Then from 9/s + t/60 = 4 ⇒ 9/2.5 + t/60 = 4 ⇒ 3.6 + t/60 = 4 ⇒ t/60 = 0.4 ⇒ t = 24.; answer: s = 2.5, t = 24\nCritic agent xAem, feedback: The values s = 2.5 km/h and t = 24 minutes satisfy both equations 9/s + t/60 = 4 and 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4, so the solution is correct.; correct: Yes\nReflexion CoT agent GkTk, refining solution, thinking: Subtracting the second equation from the first gives 9/s – 9/(s+2) = 1.6, leading to the quadratic s^2 + 2s – 11.25 = 0 and solution s = 2.5.
