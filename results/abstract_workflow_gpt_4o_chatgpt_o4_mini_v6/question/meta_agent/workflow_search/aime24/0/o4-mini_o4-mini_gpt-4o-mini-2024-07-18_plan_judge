Question: Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_0
proposed answer: To convert walking time from hours to minutes, multiply by 60: (9/(s+0.5))×60=540/(s+0.5). Then add t minutes spent in the coffee shop.

Answer:540/(s+0.5) + t
Extracted answer: 540/(s+0.5) + t
Correct answer: 204

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_6_0
proposed answer: At speed s+0.5 = 3 km/h, 9 km takes 9/3 = 3 hours = 180 minutes. Including t = 24 minutes gives 180 + 24 = 204 minutes.

Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_8_0
proposed answer: We have s=2.5 km/h and t=24 min. Walking speed s+0.5=3.0 km/h gives walking time 9/3=3 hours. Coffee shop time in hours is t/60=24/60=0.4 hours. Total time is 3+0.4=3.4 hours, which is 3.4×60=204 minutes.
