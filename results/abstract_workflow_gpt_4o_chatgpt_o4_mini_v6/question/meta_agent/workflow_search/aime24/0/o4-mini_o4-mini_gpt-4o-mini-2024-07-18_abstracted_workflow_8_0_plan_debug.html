    <pre>Related original question:

Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop..

### Sub-task 4: Solve the system 9/s + t/60 = 4 and 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4 for s and t 

 ### thinking #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent GkTk:
Subtract the second equation from the first: 9/s – 9/(s+2) = 4 – 2.4 = 1.6. Combine to get 18/[s(s+2)] = 1.6 ⇒ s^2 + 2s – 11.25 = 0 ⇒ s = (–2 + √49)/2 = 2.5. Substitute into 9/s + t/60 = 4 ⇒ 3.6 + t/60 = 4 ⇒ t/60 = 0.4 ⇒ t = 24.

### answer #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent GkTk:
s = 2.5, t = 24

### Sub-task 5: Compute the walking time 9/(s+0.5) in hours using s from previous solution 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent b4Ex:
Using s = 2.5, we have s + 0.5 = 3.0, so the walking time is 9 / 3 = 3 hours.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent b4Ex:
3

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Convert t minutes to hours (t/60), add to walking time 9/(s+0.5), then convert total hours to minutes

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>We have s=2.5 km/h and t=24 min. Walking speed s+0.5=3.0 km/h gives walking time 9/3=3 hours. Coffee shop time in hours is t/60=24/60=0.4 hours. Total time is 3+0.4=3.4 hours, which is 3.4×60=204 minutes.
