Question: Example(question="In gametogenesis, the germline undergoes two cycles of meiosis to give rise to haploid gametes. The goal of meiosis, unlike mitosis, is to separate not only the replicated sister chromatids but also the homologous chromosome pairs to form haploid cells. Fertilized gametes enter embryogenesis and ultimately develop into an organism. Meiosis is not always perfectly executed, and most such cases result in embryonic lethality. Viable events can already be detected in the karyotype of embryonic cells from the amniotic fluid. One such event results in Klinefelter's syndrome in boys. Which molecular mechanism is responsible for less prominent phenotypic consequences of Klinefelter's syndrome compared to better known Down's syndrome?", choice1='progression of the polymerase alpha in the morula/blastocyst', choice2='attachment of spindle to kinetochores in the metaphase I', choice3='chromatin methylation by histone methyltransferases in the post-zygote', choice4='chiasmata resolution by separase in diakinesis', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_96
proposed answer: The milder phenotype of Klinefelter’s compared to autosomal trisomies is due to X-chromosome inactivation, an epigenetic mechanism post‐zygotically that uses histone methyltransferases to silence one X chromosome.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_7_96
proposed answer: The extra X chromosome in Klinefelter’s syndrome is largely silenced post-zygotically by X-inactivation, which relies on recruitment of histone methyltransferases to deposit repressive marks across the supernumerary X. This chromosome-wide silencing buffers the gene dosage imbalance and leads to milder phenotypic effects compared to trisomy 21, which lacks an analogous inactivation mechanism.
