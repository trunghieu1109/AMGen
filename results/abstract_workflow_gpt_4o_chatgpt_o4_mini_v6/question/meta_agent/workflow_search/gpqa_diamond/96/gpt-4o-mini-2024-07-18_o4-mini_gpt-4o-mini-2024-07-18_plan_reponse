The goal of meiosis, unlike mitosis, is to separate not only the replicated sister chromatids but also the homologous chromosome pairs to form haploid cells. Fertilized gametes enter embryogenesis and ultimately develop into an organism. Meiosis is not always perfectly executed, and most such cases result in embryonic lethality. Viable events can already be detected in the karyotype of embryonic cells from the amniotic fluid. One such event results in Klinefelter's syndrome in boys.

This chromosome-wide silencing buffers the gene dosage imbalance and leads to milder phenotypic effects compared to trisomy 21, which lacks an analogous inactivation mechanism.\n\nAnswer:C)",
