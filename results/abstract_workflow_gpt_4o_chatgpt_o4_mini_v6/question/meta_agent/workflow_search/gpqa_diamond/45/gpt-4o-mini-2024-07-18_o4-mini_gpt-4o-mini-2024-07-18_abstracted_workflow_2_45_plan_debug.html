{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. How many possible products are there (excluding ethene)?&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;4&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;6&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;8&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;2&#39;}. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 5: Evaluate the products identified in subtask 4 to confirm their uniqueness and structural differences. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent GoWk:
The six products differ by alkene geometry (E vs Z) and by stereochemistry at the two new stereocenters. Within each geometry we have an achiral meso isomer and a pair of enantiomers (R,R and S,S), giving three distinct stereoisomers per geometry. Since E and Z are diastereomeric, all six are unique.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent GoWk:
All six are unique: 
E-meso (achiral) 
E-(R,R) and its enantiomer E-(S,S) 
Z-meso (achiral) 
Z-(R,R) and its enantiomer Z-(S,S). 
E vs Z are diastereomeric; meso vs RR/SS are diastereomers; RR and SS are enantiomers.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Summarize the total number of unique products obtained from the reaction, providing a final answer to the original query.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
