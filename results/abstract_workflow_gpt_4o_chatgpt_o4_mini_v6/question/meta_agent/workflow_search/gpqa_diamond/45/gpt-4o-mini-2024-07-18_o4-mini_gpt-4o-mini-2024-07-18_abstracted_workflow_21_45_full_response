C3 is sp3 with four different substituents (–CH2CH3, –CH2=CH–, –CH3, –H), making it a stereocenter. A racemic mixture implies equal R and S enantiomers.; answer: Structure: CH2=CH–CH(CH3)–CH2–CH3. Stereochemistry: racemic mixture of the R and S enantiomers at C3.\nCoT agent Duuc, understanding Grubbs catalyst role, thinking: The question asks for a conceptual explanation of Grubbs catalyst in olefin metathesis, which is straightforward and does not lack information, so a direct answer is appropriate.; answer: Grubbs catalyst generates a metal–carbene complex that reacts with an alkene to form a metallacyclobutane intermediate. This intermediate then fragments to give new alkene products and regenerates the metal–carbene species. In this way, the catalyst allows the exchange of alkylidene fragments between olefins (cross-metathesis), as well as ring-closing and ring-opening metathesis, with high functional-group tolerance and control over E/Z selectivity.\nCoT agent Pwel, generating products, thinking: Self-metathesis of CH2=CH–CH(CH3)–CH2–CH3 gives ethene (excluded) and the symmetrical internal alkene R*–CH=CH–R* (R* = CH(CH3)–CH2–CH3). That internal alkene exists as two stereoisomers (E and Z) and, coming from a racemic substrate, as a racemic pair for each geometry. Thus excluding ethene, there are two distinct alkene products (E and Z).; answer: E- and Z- isomers of the self-metathesis product R*–CH=CH–R* (R* = sec-butyl), i.e. two products.\nCoT agent Mj1o, evaluating products, thinking: Self-metathesis of racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene (excluding ethene) yields only the symmetrical internal alkene R*–CH=CH–R*, which exists as two distinct geometric isomers (E and Z). Despite the racemic substrate, we count only unique geometrical isomers, giving two products.; answer: 2\nCoT agent 3ZDS, computing total unique products, thinking: Sub-task 4 determined there are two unique geometrical isomers (E and Z) from self-metathesis, so the total number of unique products is 2.; answer: 2\nCoT agent Y6QE, comparing computed number with choices, thinking: Sub-task 5 concluded there are 2 unique geometrical isomers (E and Z) from self-metathesis.
