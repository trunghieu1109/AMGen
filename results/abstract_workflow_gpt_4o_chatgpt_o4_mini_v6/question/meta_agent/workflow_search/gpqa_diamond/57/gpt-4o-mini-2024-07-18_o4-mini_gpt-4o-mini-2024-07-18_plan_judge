Question: Example(question='Which of the following physical theories never requires regularization at high energies?', choice1='Superstring Theory', choice2='Quantum Electrodynamics', choice3='Quantum Chromodynamics', choice4='Classical Electrodynamics', correct_index=0)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_57
proposed answer: All reviewed analyses agree that Superstring Theory is UV finite and does not require high-energy regularization, unlike QED, QCD, and Classical Electrodynamics which all exhibit divergences.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_16_57
proposed answer: Superstring Theory is UV finite by construction and eliminates point-like divergences through the extended nature of strings, so it never requires regularization at high energies, unlike QED, QCD, or Classical Electrodynamics.
