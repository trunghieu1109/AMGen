            "Two planets have been detected orbiting a star using both the transit and radial velocity (RV) methods. The star has a mass of 1.5 times that of the Sun, a radius 1.2 times that of the Sun, and an effective temperature (Teff) of 6300 K. Planet1 has a mass equivalent to 7 Earth masses and a radius 1.7 times that of Earth, while Planet2 has a mass equivalent to 5 Earth masses and a radius 1.3 times that of Earth. Interestingly, both planets are in circular orbits. Planet1 induces a periodic shift of up to 0.03 \u00c5 in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 \u00c5, while the gravitational impact of Planet2 on the same line results in a periodic Doppler shift of up to 0.04 \u00c5. Assuming that both planets possess the same albedo, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2?",

We can estimate a1/a2 from radial velocity amplitudes: v1/v2 = \u0394\u03bb1/\u0394\u03bb2 = 0.03/0.04 = 0.75, so a1/a2 = (v2/v1)^2 \u22481.78 and a2/a1 \u22480.56 \u2192 Teq1/Teq2 \u2248\u221a0.56 \u22480.75. None of the provided choices match 0.75 exactly; the closest is ~0.53.
