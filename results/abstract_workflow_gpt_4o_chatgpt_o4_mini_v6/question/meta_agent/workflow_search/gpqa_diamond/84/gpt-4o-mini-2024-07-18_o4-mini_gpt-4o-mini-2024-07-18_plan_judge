Question: Example(question='Two planets have been detected orbiting a star using both the transit and radial velocity (RV) methods. The star has a mass of 1.5 times that of the Sun, a radius 1.2 times that of the Sun, and an effective temperature (Teff) of 6300 K. Planet1 has a mass equivalent to 7 Earth masses and a radius 1.7 times that of Earth, while Planet2 has a mass equivalent to 5 Earth masses and a radius 1.3 times that of Earth. Interestingly, both planets are in circular orbits. Planet1 induces a periodic shift of up to 0.03 Å in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å, while the gravitational impact of Planet2 on the same line results in a periodic Doppler shift of up to 0.04 Å. Assuming that both planets possess the same albedo, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2?', choice1='~ 1.05', choice2='~ 0.98', choice3='~ 0.53', choice4='~ 1.30', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: Equilibrium temperature ratio Teq1/Teq2 = √(a2/a1). We don’t have a1 and a2 directly. We can estimate a1/a2 from radial velocity amplitudes: v1/v2 = Δλ1/Δλ2 = 0.03/0.04 = 0.75, so a1/a2 = (v2/v1)^2 ≈1.78 and a2/a1 ≈0.56 → Teq1/Teq2 ≈√0.56 ≈0.75. None of the provided choices match 0.75 exactly; the closest is ~0.53. However, without explicit orbital distances, this is still an estimate.

Answer:C)
[TOO_HARD]
Please provide the semi-major axes a1 and a2 for Planet1 and Planet2 to calculate the exact temperature ratio.

proposed answer: We can infer orbital velocities from the measured Doppler shifts: v1≈(0.03 Å/6300 Å)c≈1.43 km/s, v2≈(0.04/6300)c≈1.91 km/s. The equilibrium temperature scales as Teq∝a^−1/2 and a∝1/v^2, so Teq1/Teq2=v2/v1≈1.91/1.43≈1.33. The closest choice is ~1.30.
