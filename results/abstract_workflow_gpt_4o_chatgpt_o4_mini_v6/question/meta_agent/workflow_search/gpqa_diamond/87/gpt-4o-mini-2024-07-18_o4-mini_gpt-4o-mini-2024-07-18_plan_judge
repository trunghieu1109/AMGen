Question: Example(question='You tag the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with a GFP and deliver them to mice via oral gavage. By in vivo imaging, you observe that some of the fluorescence was destroyed by the stomach acid, and some were entangled in the intestinal mucus before they reached the secondary lymphoid organs. You identify the fluorescent Peyer patches and isolate the proliferating cell population. You sequence their variable heavy chain gene and observe high variability. Which process is taking place?', choice1='somatic hypermutation', choice2='complement activation', choice3='class switching recombination', choice4='VDJ recombination', correct_index=0)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_87
proposed answer: The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes from proliferating Peyer patch B cells reflects antigen-driven diversification within germinal centers, characteristic of somatic hypermutation rather than VDJ recombination, class switching, or complement activation.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_8_87
proposed answer: The high frequency of point mutations concentrated in complementarity-determining regions with antigen-driven selection signatures indicates somatic hypermutation is occurring in germinal centers.
