Without this, I can describe the general outcome (partial quenching and denaturation) but cannot specify the exact extent. According to instructions, when missing critical quantitative information, I should flag [TOO_HARD] and request further details.; answer: Stomach acid causes partial denaturation of the GFP-tagged inner capsid proteins, leading to quenching and loss of fluorescence signal before they reach the intestines. [TOO_HARD]\nPlease provide quantitative data on fluorescence intensity before and after gastric exposure (e.g., percentage loss, pH level, exposure duration) to accurately determine the extent of fluorescence destruction.\nCoT agent xg7E, analyzing mucus interaction, thinking: The question asks how GFP-tagged proteins interact with intestinal mucus and how this affects their delivery to secondary lymphoid organs. We can describe general mechanisms—mucin entrapment slows diffusion, reduces M cell uptake, and leads to mucosal clearance—but lack specific data on mucus composition, protein size/charge, diffusion coefficients, and residence time. Without these quantitative details, we cannot fully quantify the impact.; answer: The GFP-tagged proteins become physically entangled in the mucin meshwork of the intestinal mucus layer, which increases their retention time in the lumen and reduces their diffusion to the epithelial surface. This entrapment decreases the access of proteins to M cells and dendritic cells in the Peyer’s patches, thereby lowering their uptake and delivery to secondary lymphoid organs.\n[TOO_HARD]\nPlease provide quantitative details on mucus properties (e.g., mucin concentration, viscosity), protein characteristics (size, charge), and diffusion or transit rates to accurately assess the extent of mucus-mediated entrapment.\nCoT agent fbrc, examining Peyer patches, thinking: Sub-task 3 asks for a detailed workflow to identify and sort proliferating cells from fluorescent Peyer’s patches. Designing this requires specifics about tissue digestion conditions, marker panels, cell yields, and instrumentation settings—which are not provided—so my plan is necessarily provisional.; answer: 1. Image-guided excision of fluorescent Peyer’s patches from small intestine under sterile conditions.\n2. Enzymatic digestion (e.g., collagenase D\u2009+\u2009DNase I) and mechanical dissociation to obtain a single-cell suspension.\n3. Filter cells through a 70\u2009µm mesh, wash and count viable cells.\n4. Stain with viability dye and surface markers (e.g., CD19, B220, MHC-II) plus proliferation marker (Ki-67 antibody or BrdU/EdU incorporation).\n5. Acquire on a flow cytometer or cell sorter and gate on live, fluorescent (GFP+), CD19+ B cells that are Ki-67+ (proliferating).\n6. Sort the GFP+Ki-67+ population for downstream analyses (e.g., heavy-chain sequencing, functional assays).  \n[TOO_HARD]\nPlease provide details on the digestion protocol, choice of proliferation marker (Ki-67 vs. BrdU/EdU), flow cytometry panel, expected cell numbers, and gating strategy to finalize the workflow.\nCoT agent 6GBs, sequencing heavy chain gene, thinking: Sequencing the variable heavy chain requires detailed primer design, library prep and sequencing parameters, which depend on the germline V gene database, expected cell input and desired coverage. Lacking these specifics, I provide a general workflow and note where additional details are needed.; answer: 1. Extract total RNA from the sorted GFP+Ki-67+ B cells using an RNA purification kit optimized for low input.\n2. Perform cDNA synthesis with a mix of constant-region reverse primers (e.g., IgM, IgG) and a template-switch oligo to capture full VDJ transcripts.\n3. PCR-amplify the VDJ region using leader-specific forward primers (covering all V_H families) and constant-region reverse primers; use a high-fidelity polymerase.\n4. Purify the ~350-450 bp amplicons (e.g., SPRI beads), quantify and assess size distribution.\n5. Prepare an Illumina-compatible library by adding adapters and sample indexes via a limited-cycle PCR.\n6. Sequence on a platform that yields paired-end reads covering the entire VDJ (e.g., MiSeq 2×300 bp), targeting ≥10,000 reads per cell.\n7. Process raw data: demultiplex, trim adapters, filter low-quality reads.\n8. Use IMGT/HighV-QUEST or IgBlast to assign V, D and J gene usage, align to germline and identify somatic mutations.\n9. Calculate mutation frequency (mutations/base) in framework and CDR regions, analyze CDR3 length diversity and clonotype distribution.\n10. Generate lineage trees to visualize clonal relationships and somatic hypermutation patterns.\n[TOO_HARD]\nPlease provide the germline V_H primer sequences or reference database, expected input cell number and desired per-clone read coverage to finalize PCR and sequencing parameters.\nCoT agent vYvJ, evaluating sequenced genes, thinking: The high frequency of point mutations concentrated in the complementarity-determining regions, increased replacement-to-silent mutation ratios, and evidence of antigen-driven selection in the lineage trees are hallmarks of somatic hypermutation occurring in germinal centers, rather than class switch recombination or the initial VDJ recombination event.; answer: Somatic hypermutation\nCoT agent ZOUG, determining process, thinking: The high frequency of point mutations concentrated in complementarity-determining regions with antigen-driven selection signatures indicates somatic hypermutation is occurring in germinal centers.; answer: A)', iteration_idx=-1)]
