    <pre>Related original question:

{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;You tag the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with a GFP and deliver them to mice via oral gavage. By in vivo imaging, you observe that some of the fluorescence was destroyed by the stomach acid, and some were entangled in the intestinal mucus before they reached the secondary lymphoid organs. You identify the fluorescent Peyer patches and isolate the proliferating cell population. You sequence their variable heavy chain gene and observe high variability. Which process is taking place?&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;somatic hypermutation&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;complement activation&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;class switching recombination&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;VDJ recombination&#39;}. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 5: Evaluate the sequenced variable heavy chain genes for signs of somatic hypermutation, class switching recombination, or VDJ recombination based on the observed high variability. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent vYvJ:
The high frequency of point mutations concentrated in the complementarity-determining regions, increased replacement-to-silent mutation ratios, and evidence of antigen-driven selection in the lineage trees are hallmarks of somatic hypermutation occurring in germinal centers, rather than class switch recombination or the initial VDJ recombination event.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent vYvJ:
Somatic hypermutation

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Determine which of the processes (somatic hypermutation, complement activation, class switching recombination, VDJ recombination) is most likely taking place based on the analysis from subtask 5.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
