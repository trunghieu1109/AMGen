Assumption 2 neglects final-state interactions so the struck nucleon exits as if free. Assumption 4 ignores binding forces so scattering kinematics match those of a free nucleon. Assumption 3 (non-relativistic quarks) is not required for the impulse approximation itself, which focuses on one-body current, no FSI, and no binding modifications.\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent w2TS:\nD)\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Select the correct choice from the evaluated combinations that best represents the assumptions leading to the impulse approximation.\n\nIf the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the "answer" entry and justify why you think so in the "thinking" entry'}], sub_tasks=None, agents='CoT agent NcUY, identifying assumptions, thinking: The four assumptions are explicitly listed in the original question regarding the impulse approximation.; answer: 1. The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.\n2. The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.\n3. The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.\n4. The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.\nCoT agent IXzb, analyzing assumptions, thinking: We need to explain how each of the four assumptions supports the impulse approximation by isolating the struck nucleon, neglecting medium effects, and treating it as a free particle with unmodified internal structure.; answer: 1. The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.\n   This ensures the probe couples via a one-body operator, neglecting two-body or meson-exchange currents, so that each nucleon can be treated independently.\n\n2. The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.\n   By assuming no final-state interactions (FSI) or scattering of the ejected nucleon with the residual nucleus, the struck nucleon exits as if it were free.\n\n3. The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.\n   This implies the nucleon’s internal structure and form factors remain those of a free, non-relativistic nucleon, with no medium-induced modifications.\n\n4. The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.\n   Ignoring binding potentials means the nucleon’s initial momentum and energy distributions are those of a free particle, so the reaction kinematics match free-nucleon scattering.\nCoT agent w2TS, evaluating combinations, thinking: Assumption 1 ensures the probe couples via a one-body operator (no two-body currents).
