Assumption 2 neglects final‐state interactions (the nucleus is transparent apart from the struck nucleon). Assumption 4 treats the struck nucleon as if unbound by nuclear forces. Assumption 3 concerns quark‐level relativity and is not required for the nucleonic impulse approximation. Therefore the impulse approximation follows from 1, 2, and 4, corresponding to choice D.; answer: D)\nCoT-SC agent xKiP, classifying assumptions, thinking: The impulse approximation assumes the probe interacts with a single nucleon (1), neglects interactions of the struck nucleon with the rest of the nucleus after the hit (2), and treats the nucleon as if it were free (4). Quark relativity (3) is not needed at the nucleon level, so it is neither required nor sufficient.; answer: Necessary assumptions: 1, 2, and 4. Sufficient: the combination of 1, 2, and 4. Assumption 3 is neither necessary nor sufficient.\nCoT-SC agent vDzD, classifying assumptions, thinking: Sub-task 1 identified that assumptions 1, 2, and 4 are jointly needed to enforce the one‐body, no final‐state interactions, and free‐nucleon behavior, while assumption 3 on quark non‐relativity isn’t required. Thus 1, 2, 4 are necessary and together form a sufficient set; 3 is neither.; answer: Necessary assumptions: 1, 2, 4. Sufficient assumptions: 1, 2, 4. Assumption 3 is neither necessary nor sufficient.\nCoT-SC agent RtOd, classifying assumptions, thinking: Assumptions 1, 2, and 4 are jointly what define the impulse approximation: 1 imposes a one‐body interaction current, 2 neglects nuclear transparency (no final‐state interactions), and 4 treats the struck nucleon as unbound. Assumption 3 concerns internal quark dynamics and isn’t needed for the nucleonic impulse approximation, so it’s neither necessary nor sufficient.; answer: Necessary assumptions: 1, 2, 4.
