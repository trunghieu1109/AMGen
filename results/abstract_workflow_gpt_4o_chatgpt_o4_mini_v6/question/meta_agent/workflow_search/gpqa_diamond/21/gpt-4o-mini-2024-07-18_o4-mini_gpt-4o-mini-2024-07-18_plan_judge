Question: Example(question='A student regrets that he fell asleep during a lecture in electrochemistry, facing the following incomplete statement in a test:\nThermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, oxygen reacts …… in acidic solutions.\nWhich combination of weaker/stronger and faster/slower is correct?', choice1='weaker – faster', choice2='stronger – slower', choice3='weaker - slower', choice4='stronger – faster', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_21
proposed answer: In basic solutions the standard reduction potential of O₂ shifts negatively, making it a weaker oxidant thermodynamically. In acidic solutions its four‐electron, proton‐coupled reduction is kinetically sluggish, so it reacts more slowly. This matches choice C.

Answer:C)
Extracted answer: C)
Correct answer: 2

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_5_21
proposed answer: Sub-task 5 concluded that oxygen is thermodynamically weaker in basic solution and kinetically reacts slower in acidic solution, matching the “weaker – slower” pairing, which corresponds to choice C).
