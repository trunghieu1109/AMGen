Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_61
proposed answer: None of the provided sequences actually introduces a cyclohexyl electrophile in the alkylation step. Sequence 1 has the correct reaction types but uses methyl chloride instead of cyclohexyl chloride, so itâ€™s the most promising scaffold but needs modification.

Answer:Choice1

Replace methyl chloride with cyclohexyl chloride in step 1 to install the second cyclohexyl ring.

proposed answer: Detailed analysis shows that none of the provided sequences can install both the secondary hydroxy-methyl linkage and the terminal aldehyde on the cyclohexane ring, making all options ineffective.

Answer:None of the above sequences.
