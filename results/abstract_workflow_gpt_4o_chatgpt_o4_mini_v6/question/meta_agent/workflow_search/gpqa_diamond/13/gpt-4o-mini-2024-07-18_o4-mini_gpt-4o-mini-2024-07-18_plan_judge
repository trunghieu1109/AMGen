Question: Example(question='ChIP-seq on a PFA-fixed sample with an antibody to the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells followed by next-generation sequencing and standard quality control, alignment and peak-calling steps produced ChIP peaks that disappeared when PFA+DSG fixation was used. Where are we most likely to find such disappearing peaks?', choice1='At active promoters and enhancers', choice2='At repeats', choice3='In the introns of large genes', choice4='At random locations in the genome', correct_index=0)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_16_13
proposed answer: The disappearing IKAROS ChIP-seq peaks under stronger PFA+DSG fixation map predominantly to repetitive, low-complexity regions (e.g., satellite DNA, LINE/SINE elements) without IKAROS motifs or active chromatin marks, indicating weak or indirect interactions rather than true functional binding at promoters, introns, or random sites.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_36_13
proposed answer: Based on subtasks, the disappearing peaks map to transient, open-chromatin interactions where IKAROS binds indirectly or brieflyâ€”features of active promoters and enhancers in B cells.
