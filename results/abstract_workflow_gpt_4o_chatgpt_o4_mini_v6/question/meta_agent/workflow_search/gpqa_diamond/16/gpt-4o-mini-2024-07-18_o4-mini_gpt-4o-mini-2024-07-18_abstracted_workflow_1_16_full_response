All necessary information is given, so no additional data or decomposition is needed.; answer: Key components:\n- [Ca-EDTA] initial concentration: 0.02 M\n- Formation constant KCa-EDTA: 5×10^10\n- pH: ideal (no protonation effects)\n- Temperature: 25 °C\nCoT agent cXsv, classifying chemical equilibrium, thinking: The question asks for the type of equilibrium (formation of a metal–ligand complex) and how free Ca2+ relates to the complex concentration via the formation constant. All needed parameters (Kf expression) are given.; answer: This is a metal–ligand complexation equilibrium (formation of CaEDTA2–). The formation constant is defined as Kf = [CaEDTA2–]/([Ca2+][EDTA4–]), which rearranges to [Ca2+] = [CaEDTA2–]/(Kf\u2009·\u2009[EDTA4–]).\nSC-CoT agent ERnq, deriving expression, thinking: We start from the definition of the formation constant: Kf = [CaEDTA2–]/([Ca2+][EDTA4–]).
