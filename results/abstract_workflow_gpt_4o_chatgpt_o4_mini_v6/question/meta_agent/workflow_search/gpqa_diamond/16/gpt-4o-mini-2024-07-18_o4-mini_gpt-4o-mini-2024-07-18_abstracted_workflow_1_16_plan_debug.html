    <pre>Related original question:

{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex (we assume that the pH is ideal, T = 25 °C). KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10.&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;1.0x10^-2 M &#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;5.0x10^-3 M&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;6.3x10^-7 M&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;2.0x10^-2 M &#39;}. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 5: Compute the concentration of calcium ions using the formula derived in subtask 3 and the values substituted in subtask 4. 

 ### thinking by Debate Agent UBFY:
The expression for [Ca2+] is [Ca2+] = [Ca-EDTA]/(KCa-EDTA × [EDTA]). We have [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 M and KCa-EDTA = 5×10^10, but no free [EDTA] is given, so we cannot compute a numeric value.

### thinking by Debate Agent R7k5:
The equilibrium expression for the dissociation of Ca–EDTA requires the free EDTA concentration, which has not been provided. Without [EDTA] we cannot compute a numeric value for [Ca²⁺].

### thinking by Debate Agent 5N6p:
The equilibrium expression [Ca²⁺] = [CaEDTA]/(K·[EDTA]) requires the free EDTA concentration, which has not been provided. Without [EDTA], a numerical value for [Ca²⁺] cannot be determined.

### thinking by Debate Agent 2VLf:
The free EDTA concentration is not provided, so we cannot calculate a numeric [Ca²⁺]. Without [EDTA], the expression cannot be evaluated.

### answer by Debate Agent UBFY:
[Ca2+] = 0.02 M / (5×10^10 × [EDTA])
[TOO_HARD]
Please provide the free EDTA concentration or total EDTA added to allow numerical calculation.

### answer by Debate Agent R7k5:
[Ca²⁺] = 0.02 M ⁄ (5×10¹⁰ × [EDTA])
[TOO_HARD]
Please provide the free EDTA concentration so that the numerical value of [Ca²⁺] can be determined.

### answer by Debate Agent 5N6p:
[Ca²⁺] = 0.02 M / (5×10^10 × [EDTA])
[TOO_HARD]
Please provide the free EDTA concentration or the total EDTA added to allow numerical evaluation.

### answer by Debate Agent 2VLf:
[Ca²⁺] = 0.02 M / (5×10¹⁰ × [EDTA])
[TOO_HARD]
Please provide the free EDTA concentration (or total EDTA) to compute a numerical value.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 5: Make final decision on the concentration of calcium ions.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>We have a 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca–EDTA system. Mass balances give [CaD]=0.02–[Ca2+] and [D]=[Ca2+]. The formation constant K = [CaD]/([Ca2+][D]) = 5×10^10. Substituting yields (0.02–x)/x^2 = 5×10^10. Solving the quadratic gives x ≈ 6.3×10^-7 M.
