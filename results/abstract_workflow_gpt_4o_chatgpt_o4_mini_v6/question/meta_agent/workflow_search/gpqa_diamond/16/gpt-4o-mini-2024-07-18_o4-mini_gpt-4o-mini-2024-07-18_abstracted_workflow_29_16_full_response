At equilibrium K=[CaEDTA]/([Ca2+][EDTA])≈0.02/(x^2)=5×10^10 ⇒ x^2=0.02/5×10^10=4×10^–13 ⇒ x≈6.3×10^–7 M. Total [Ca]=[Ca2+]free+[CaEDTA]≈6.3×10^–7+0.02≈0.0200006 M≈2.0×10^–2 M.; answer: Total concentration of Ca2+ = 2.0×10^-2 M\nCoT-SC agent wocx, determining free calcium concentration, thinking: Using the equilibrium expression K = [CaEDTA]/([Ca2+][EDTA]) and assuming that the amount dissociated x = [Ca2+] = [EDTA]free, we have x^2 = [CaEDTA]/K = 0.02 / (5×10^10) = 4×10^-13, so x = sqrt(4×10^-13) ≈ 6.3×10^-7 M.; answer: 6.3×10^-7 M\nCoT-SC agent ahL5, determining free calcium concentration, thinking: We use the equilibrium expression K = [CaEDTA]/([Ca2+][EDTA]). Let x = [Ca2+]free = [EDTA]free and [CaEDTA] ~ 0.02 M. So x^2 = 0.02 / (5×10^10) = 4×10^–13, giving x ≈ 6.3×10^–7 M.; answer: The concentration of free calcium ions is 6.3×10^-7 M.\nCoT-SC agent mTma, determining free calcium concentration, thinking: We use the stability constant expression K = [CaEDTA]/([Ca2+][EDTA]) ≈ 5×10^10 = 0.02/(x·x), so x^2 = 0.02/5×10^10 = 4×10^-13, hence x = √(4×10^-13) ≈ 6.3×10^-7 M.; answer: 6.3×10^-7 M\nCoT agent KANM, evaluating concentration, thinking: The free Ca2+ concentration calculated is ~6.3×10^−7 M, which corresponds to choice3 (the third option).; answer: C)\nFinal Decision agent, classifying answer, thinking: The calculated free Ca2+ concentration (≈6.3×10^−7 M) matches choice3, which corresponds to option C).; answer: C)', iteration_idx=-1)]
