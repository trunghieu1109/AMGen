proposed answer: The soft organocuprate, Me2CuLi (formed by transmetallation of MeLi with CuI), preferentially undergoes conjugate (1,4-) addition to the remaining α,β-unsaturated ketone. It does not open the epoxide under these conditions or add 1,2 to the carbonyl. After conjugate attack at the β-carbon, protonation of the enolate gives the β-methylated ketone, with the epoxide rings left intact.

Answer:Conjugate (1,4-) Michael addition of lithium dimethylcuprate (Me2CuLi) to the α,β-unsaturated ketone
Extracted answer: Conjugate (1,4-) Michael addition of lithium dimethylcuprate (Me2CuLi) to the α,β-unsaturated ketone
Correct answer: 3

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_48_94
proposed answer: The organocuprate opens the epoxide at the less hindered carbon (C6), installing a methyl there and leaving the OH at C5 while preserving the C1–C2 double bond and the ketone at C4, matching choice C.
