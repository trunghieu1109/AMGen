Here the substrate has two isolated double bonds (at C1–C2 and C5–C6), so treatment with one equivalent of mCPBA yields two epoxide isomers in roughly equal amounts.; answer: The two products are 1,2-epoxy-3,3,6-trimethylheptan-4-one and 5,6-epoxy-3,3,6-trimethylheptan-4-one.\nCoT-SC agent 5g63, analyzing product structures, thinking: The substrate has two isolated double bonds, so one equivalent of mCPBA gives two regioisomeric epoxyketones: one at C1–C2 (a terminal epoxide) and one at C5–C6 (an internal epoxide). Each is an epoxyketone (3,3,6-trimethylheptan-4-one bearing an epoxide). They are isolable, colorless liquids, with ring strain that makes them susceptible to nucleophilic ring opening (e.g., by organocuprates which attack the less substituted epoxide carbon).; answer: The two products are:\n\n1) 1,2-epoxy-3,3,6-trimethylheptan-4-one (epoxide on C1–C2, ketone at C4)\n2) 5,6-epoxy-3,3,6-trimethylheptan-4-one (epoxide on C5–C6, ketone at C4)\n\nBoth are epoxyketones: they are colorless, strained three-membered rings adjacent to a ketone, and readily undergo nucleophilic ring opening at the less hindered carbon (e.g. by Me₂CuLi) to give methyl‐substituted secondary alcohols adjacent to the original ketone.\nCoT-SC agent 8S6a, analyzing product structures, thinking: The substrate has two isolated alkenes at C1–C2 and C5–C6. One equivalent of mCPBA will epoxidize one of these double bonds at random, giving two distinct epoxides in roughly equal amounts. Both are α-epoxy ketones (the ketone at C4 is two carbons away from the epoxide). These epoxides are strained three-membered rings and will undergo nucleophilic ring opening by organocuprates at the less substituted carbon. Knowledge of their structures and ring-opening reactivity is essential for predicting products with MeLi/CuI.; answer: The two products are:\n1. 1,2-epoxy-3,3,6-trimethylheptan-4-one (epoxide on C1–C2)\n2. 5,6-epoxy-3,3,6-trimethylheptan-4-one (epoxide on C5–C6)\n\nProperties:\n• Both are three-membered ring epoxides adjacent to a ketone two carbons away.\n• They are racemic due to epoxidation of a prochiral alkene.\n• They have significant ring strain, making them electrophilic toward nucleophiles.\n• Under MeLi/CuI (Gilman reagent) conditions, they undergo regioselective ring opening at the less substituted carbon to give β- or δ-hydroxy ketones with methyl substitution at the site of attack.\nCoT-SC agent wGJb, analyzing product structures, thinking: The peracid epoxidizes each of the two isolated double bonds once, giving two isomeric α,β-epoxyketones. Both are colorless, strained three-membered ethers adjacent to a central ketone. They differ only in whether the epoxide is at C1–C2 or C5–C6. Each epoxide is activated toward nucleophilic ring opening by the adjacent carbonyl, with attack favoring the less substituted epoxide carbon.; answer: The two products are: (1) 1,2-epoxy-3,3,6-trimethylheptan-4-one and (2) 5,6-epoxy-3,3,6-trimethylheptan-4-one. Both are colorless, strained epoxyketones. The epoxide ring is highly electrophilic—especially at the less substituted carbon—and is activated for nucleophilic attack (e.g. by organocuprates) by the adjacent ketone carbonyl.\nReflexion CoT agent uZ56, analyzing reaction, thinking: The organocuprate generated from MeLi/CuI will open the epoxide at the less hindered carbon. For the 5,6-epoxide (with the C1–C2 double bond intact), attack at C6 gives a methyl substituent there and an OH at C5, retaining the C1–C2 double. This matches 5-hydroxy-3,3,6,6-tetramethylhept-1-en-4-one.; answer: C)\nDebate agent 039g, round 0, identifying final product, thinking: The organocuprate Me2CuLi generated from MeLi/CuI opens the epoxide at the less hindered carbon (C6), installing a methyl group there and yielding an alcohol at C5, while retaining the C1–C2 double bond and the ketone at C4.
