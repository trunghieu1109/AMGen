proposed answer: All debate agents agreed that 2,2-diiodoethen-1-one is the only viable reactant for the [2+2] cycloaddition with cyclohexene to yield 8,8-diiodobicyclo[4.2.0]octan-7-one, and the consensus reactivity order of the dienes from most to least is cyclopenta-1,3-diene (3) > 2,3-dimethylbuta-1,3-diene (1) > (2E,4E)-hexa-2,4-diene (2) > (2Z,4Z)-hexa-2,4-diene (4).

Answer:A = 2,2-diiodoethen-1-one; B = 3,1,2,4
Extracted answer: A = 2,2-diiodoethen-1-one; B = 3,1,2,4
Correct answer: 1

proposed answer: Based on the analysis in sub-task 3, the dienes rank in reactivity as follows: cyclopenta-1,3-diene (3) > 2,3-dimethylbuta-1,3-diene (1) > (2Z,4Z)-hexa-2,4-diene (4) > (2E,4E)-hexa-2,4-diene (2).

Answer:3 > 1 > 4 > 2
Extracted answer: 3 > 1 > 4 > 2
Correct answer: 1
