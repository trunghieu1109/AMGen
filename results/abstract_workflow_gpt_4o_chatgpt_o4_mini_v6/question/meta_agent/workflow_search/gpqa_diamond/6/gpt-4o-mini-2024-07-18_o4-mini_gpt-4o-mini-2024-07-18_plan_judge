Question: Example(question='The universe is filled with the Cosmic Microwave Background. Consider the annihilation of high energy \\gamma-rays with a photon from the CMB Radiation into electron-positron, i.e. $\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$. From what energy \\gamma-rays would have their lifetimes in the universe limited by this process? Knowing that the average photon energy of the CMB is $10^{-3}eV$.', choice1='9.5*1e4 GeV', choice2='1.8*1e5 GeV', choice3='2.6*1e5 GeV', choice4='3.9*1e5 GeV', correct_index=2)

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_6_6
proposed answer: The threshold energy for γγ→e⁺e⁻ with CMB photons (ε≈10⁻³ eV) is E_γ≈(0.511 MeV)²/ε≈2.6×10⁵ GeV, which corresponds to choice 3.
