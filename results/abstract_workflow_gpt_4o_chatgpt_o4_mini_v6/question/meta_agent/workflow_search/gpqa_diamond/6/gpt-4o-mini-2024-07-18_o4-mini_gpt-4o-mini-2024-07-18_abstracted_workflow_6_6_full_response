The threshold condition is E_γ\u2009ε ≥ (mₑc²)². Plugging in ε≈10⁻³\u2009eV and mₑc²=0.511\u2009MeV gives the minimum E_γ.; answer: The relevant process is photon–photon pair production (γ\u2009γ → e⁺e⁻).

With ε≈10⁻³\u2009eV and m_ec²=0.511\u2009MeV, we get E_γ ≥ (0.511\u2009MeV)²/(10⁻³\u2009eV) ≃2.6×10¹⁴\u2009eV ≃2.6×10⁵\u2009GeV.; answer: C)\nCritic agent moGY, providing feedback, thinking: The threshold estimate Eγ ≃ (mec2)2/ε ≃ (0.511\u2009MeV)2/(10−3\u2009eV) ≃2.6×1014\u2009eV≃2.6×105\u2009GeV is correctly obtained and matches choice 3.; answer: This simple estimate assumes a head-on collision with a monochromatic 10−3\u2009eV CMB photon. In reality, the CMB has a Planck spectrum and interactions occur under a range of angles: the true rate must integrate over the photon energy distribution and the angle-dependent cross section, which rises gradually above threshold. Moreover, the gamma‐ray lifetime is set by the optical depth through the Universe (redshift evolution of the background), not just the kinematic threshold, so 2.6×105\u2009GeV should be viewed as an order-of-magnitude limit rather than a sharp cutoff.\nReflexion CoT agent WHIk, refining threshold energy calculation, thinking: The γγ→e⁺e⁻ threshold is set by E_γ·ε ≥ (m_e c²)².
