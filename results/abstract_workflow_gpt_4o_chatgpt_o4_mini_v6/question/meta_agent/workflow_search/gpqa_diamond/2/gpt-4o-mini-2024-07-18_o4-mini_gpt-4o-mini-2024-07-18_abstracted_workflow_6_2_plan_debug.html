{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;A spin-half particle is in a linear superposition 0.5|\\uparrow\\rangle+sqrt(3)/2|\\downarrow\\rangle of its spin-up and spin-down states. If |\\uparrow\\rangle and |\\downarrow\\rangle are the eigenstates of \\sigma{z} , then what is the expectation value up to one decimal place, of the operator 10\\sigma{z}+5\\sigma_{x} ? Here, symbols have their usual meanings&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;0.85&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;1.65&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;-1.4&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;-0.7&#39;}.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 5: Make final decision on rounded output.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
