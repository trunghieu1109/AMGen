Question: Example(question='Find KE of product particles in,\nPi(+) = mu(+) + nu\nhere Pi(+) is stationary.\nRest mass of Pi(+) &  mu(+) is 139.6 MeV & 105.7 MeV respectively.', choice1='2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV', choice2='7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV', choice3='3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV', choice4='4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_8_11
proposed answer: Using two-body decay kinematics and conservation laws, all agents find KE_μ⁺≈4.12 MeV and KE_ν≈29.8 MeV, matching choice 4.

Answer:KE of μ⁺ = 4.12 MeV; KE of ν = 29.8 MeV
Extracted answer: KE of μ⁺ = 4.12 MeV; KE of ν = 29.8 MeV
Correct answer: 3

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_15_11
proposed answer: The total energy available from the decay of a stationary π+ is its rest mass energy, 139.6 MeV. The muon’s total energy is Eμ=√(p²+mμ²)≈109.84 MeV, giving KEμ≈4.14 MeV. The neutrino, treated as massless, carries away the remainder: Eν=139.6−109.84≈29.76 MeV, which equals its kinetic energy.

Answer:Kinetic energy of the neutrino ≈29.8 MeV
Extracted answer: Kinetic energy of the neutrino ≈29.8 MeV
Correct answer: 3
