### Sub-task 4: Determine the final kinetic energies of both mu(+) and nu by solving the equations derived from conservation of energy and momentum, and compare the results with the provided choices. 

 ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent IzMX:
For a π+ at rest decaying into μ+ and a massless ν, momentum magnitudes are equal: p = (m_π² – m_μ²)/(2 m_π) = (139.6² – 105.7²)/(2·139.6) ≃ 29.8 MeV. Thus KE_ν = p ≃ 29.8 MeV, E_μ = m_π – p ≃ 109.8 MeV, so KE_μ = E_μ – m_μ ≃ 109.8 – 105.7 = 4.1 MeV. This matches choice 4.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent oaG6:
In a two-body decay at rest, E_mu = (M_pi^2 + m_mu^2)/(2 M_pi) = (139.6^2 + 105.7^2)/(2*139.6) ≈ 109.83 MeV, so KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu ≈ 4.13 MeV. The neutrino energy (all kinetic) is (M_pi^2 - m_mu^2)/(2 M_pi) ≈ 29.8 MeV. These match choice 4.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent QNME:
In a two-body decay at rest, momentum magnitudes are equal: p=(mπ^2–mμ^2)/(2mπ). KEμ=Eμ–mμ=(mπ–mμ)^2/(2mπ), KEnu=p≈(mπ^2–mμ^2)/(2mπ). Substituting mπ=139.6 MeV, mμ=105.7 MeV gives KEμ≈4.12 MeV and KEnu≈29.8 MeV, corresponding to choice 4.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent Tp3r:
We use two-body decay kinematics: KE_mu = (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2)/(2 m_pi) ≃ (139.6^2 - 105.7^2)/(2 × 139.6) ≃ 29.8 MeV. Total Q = m_pi - m_mu ≃ 33.9 MeV so KE_nu = 33.9 - 29.8 ≃ 4.12 MeV. Matches choice 4 (neutrino then muon).

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 5: Make final decision on the kinetic energies of mu(+) and nu.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
