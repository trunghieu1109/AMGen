Thus KE_ν = p ≃ 29.8 MeV, E_μ = m_π – p ≃ 109.8 MeV, so KE_μ = E_μ – m_μ ≃ 109.8 – 105.7 = 4.1 MeV. This matches choice 4.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent oaG6:\nIn a two-body decay at rest, E_mu = (M_pi^2 + m_mu^2)/(2 M_pi) = (139.6^2 + 105.7^2)/(2*139.6) ≈ 109.83 MeV, so KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu ≈ 4.13 MeV. The neutrino energy (all kinetic) is (M_pi^2 - m_mu^2)/(2 M_pi) ≈ 29.8 MeV. These match choice 4.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent QNME:\nIn a two-body decay at rest, momentum magnitudes are equal: p=(mπ^2–mμ^2)/(2mπ). KEμ=Eμ–mμ=(mπ–mμ)^2/(2mπ), KEnu=p≈(mπ^2–mμ^2)/(2mπ). Substituting mπ=139.6\u2009MeV, mμ=105.7\u2009MeV gives KEμ≈4.12\u2009MeV and KEnu≈29.8\u2009MeV, corresponding to choice 4.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent Tp3r:\nWe use two-body decay kinematics: KE_mu = (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2)/(2 m_pi) ≃ (139.6^2 - 105.7^2)/(2 × 139.6) ≃ 29.8 MeV.

Plugging in m_pi=139.6 MeV and m_mu=105.7 MeV gives E_mu ≃ 109.80 MeV, so KE = E_mu − m_mu ≃ 4.10 MeV (≈4.12 MeV).; answer: KE of the muon = 4.12 MeV\nCoT-SC agent Kdyo, calculating KE of nu, thinking: The pion at rest has total energy Eₚ = mₚc² = 139.6 MeV. The muon’s total energy is E_μ = m_μc² + KE_μ = 105.7 + 4.12 = 109.82 MeV. Energy conservation gives E_ν = Eₚ – E_μ = 139.6 – 109.82 = 29.78 MeV. Since the neutrino is effectively massless, its kinetic energy equals its total energy, ≃29.8 MeV.; answer: 29.8 MeV\nCoT-SC agent fldN, calculating KE of nu, thinking: The pion at rest decays to μ+ and ν. Total energy Eπ = mπ = 139.6 MeV must equal Eμ + Eν. From sub-task 1, KEμ = 4.12 MeV, so Eμ = mμ + KEμ = 105.7 + 4.12 = 109.82 MeV. Thus Eν = 139.6 − 109.82 = 29.78 MeV. The neutrino is effectively massless, so its kinetic energy equals its total energy: KEν ≃ 29.8 MeV.; answer: KE of the neutrino = 29.8 MeV\nCoT-SC agent kLLR, calculating KE of nu, thinking: For a two-body decay at rest, total energy = m_π c² = 139.6 MeV. Muon total energy E_μ = (m_π² + m_μ²)/(2m_π) ≃ 109.80 MeV, so neutrino energy E_ν = E_total − E_μ = 139.6 − 109.8 = 29.8 MeV. Since the neutrino mass is negligible, its kinetic energy ≃ its total energy.; answer: KE of the neutrino = 29.8 MeV\nReflexion CoT agent 9Uxz, summing rest mass energies, thinking: To find the total energy available for kinetic energy distribution, we sum the rest mass energies of the pion and the muon: 139.6 MeV + 105.7 MeV = 245.3 MeV.; answer: Total rest mass energy = 139.6 MeV + 105.7 MeV = 245.3 MeV\nCritic agent qGTQ, providing feedback, thinking: While the arithmetic 139.6 + 105.7 = 245.3 MeV is correct as a raw sum of rest‐mass energies, this sum is not the quantity available as kinetic energy in the decay. Energy conservation in a two‐body decay at rest requires subtracting the total final rest‐mass energy from the initial rest‐mass energy, not adding them. Moreover, one must enforce momentum conservation and account for the (negligible) neutrino mass when dividing the available energy between the muon and neutrino. Simply summing rest masses therefore overestimates the kinetic energy that can be shared by the decay products.; answer: Energy available for kinetic energy = m_πc^2 – m_μc^2 ≈ 139.6 MeV – 105.7 MeV = 33.9 MeV.\nReflexion CoT agent 9Uxz, refining summation, thinking: Although summing the rest masses is straightforward, this result does not correspond to the kinetic energy available in the decay (one must subtract the final rest masses from the initial).
