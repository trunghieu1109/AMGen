In two-body decay π+→μ+ν (mν≈0), energy and momentum conservation give μ momentum p=(Mπ²−mμ²)/(2Mπ)≈29.8 MeV.

For stationary π+, total energy Eπ = Mπ = 139.6 MeV. Neutrino is massless, so pμ = pν = p, Eμ = √(p² + mμ²). Energy conservation: Mπ = Eμ + p ⇒ p = (Mπ² − mμ²)/(2\u2009Mπ) ≈ (139.6² − 105.7²)/(2×139.6) ≈ 29.8 MeV. Then Eμ ≈ √(29.8² + 105.7²) ≈ 109.84 MeV, so KEμ = Eμ − mμ ≈ 109.84 − 105.7 ≈ 4.14 MeV ≈ 4.12 MeV.; answer: 4.12 MeV\nCritic agent xJuY, providing feedback, thinking: The calculation correctly uses two-body decay kinematics (energy and momentum conservation) to find KEμ≈4.12 MeV. It consistently applies Eπ=Mπ=Eμ+Eν with mν=0 to solve for p and then KEμ=√(p²+mμ²)–mμ.; answer: While 4.12 MeV is accurate under ideal assumptions, the result has these limitations:\n1) Neutrino mass set to zero (a finite mν≲1 eV would shift KEμ by ≲10⁻⁵ MeV).\n2) Radiative (electromagnetic) corrections and loop effects are ignored (≈0.1% level).\n3) Pion’s finite lifetime (width) and any external fields or binding effects are neglected.\n4) Experimental resolution and detector effects can introduce additional uncertainties of order 0.01 MeV.\nReflexion CoT agent DCvz, refining KE of mu(+), thinking: For π+ at rest total energy Eπ=Mπ=139.6 MeV.
