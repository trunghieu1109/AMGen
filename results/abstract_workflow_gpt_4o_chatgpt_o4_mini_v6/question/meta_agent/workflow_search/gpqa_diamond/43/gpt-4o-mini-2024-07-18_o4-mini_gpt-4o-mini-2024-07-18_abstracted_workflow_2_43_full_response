Assays that directly report on mitochondrial bioenergetics (ATP, ΔΨm) or structure (staining) are informative.

The core aim is to probe mitochondrial role of the drug.; answer: The main focus is to investigate the effect of the new anti-diabetes drug on mitochondrial function in HEK293 cells.\nCoT agent kkSn, classifying experimental choices, thinking: We need to classify each experimental choice by whether it assesses mitochondrial function. Luciferase assay measures ATP from mitochondria, Mito-RTP staining visualizes mitochondria, JC-1 (tetrachloro carbocyanine) reports membrane potential, and glucose uptake in isolated mitochondria is not meaningful for mitochondrial function assessment.; answer: Choice1: Relevant to mitochondrial function assessment (ATP measurement).
