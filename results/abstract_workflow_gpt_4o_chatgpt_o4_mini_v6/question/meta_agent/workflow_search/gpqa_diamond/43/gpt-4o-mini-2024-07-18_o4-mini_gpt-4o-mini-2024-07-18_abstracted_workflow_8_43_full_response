Only experiment 3 is irrelevant to direct mitochondrial function.; answer: Choice1: Luciferase + luciferin luminescence assay to quantify cellular ATP (readout of mitochondrial ATP synthesis).

Choice 2 (Mito-RTP staining) visualizes mitochondrial mass and morphology via confocal microscopy. Choice 3 (Glucose Uptake Colorimetric Assay) measures whole‐cell glucose import and does not assess any mitochondrial parameter.
