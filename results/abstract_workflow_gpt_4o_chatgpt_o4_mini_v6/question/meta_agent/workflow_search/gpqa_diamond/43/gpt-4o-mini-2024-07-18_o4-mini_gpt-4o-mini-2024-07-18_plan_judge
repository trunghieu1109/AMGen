Question: Example(question='A eukaryotic cell evolved a mechanism to turn macromolecular building blocks into energy. The process occurs in mitochondria, which are cellular energy factories. In the series of redox reactions, the energy from food is stored between the phosphate groups and used as a universal cellular currency. The energy-laden molecules are shuttled out of the mitochondrion to serve in all cellular processes. You discovered a new anti-diabetes drug and want to investigate whether it has an effect on the mitochondria. You set up a range of experiments with your HEK293 cell line. Which of the experiments listed below will not help you discover the mitochondrial role of your drug:', choice1='Transformation of cells with recombinant luciferase and luminometer reading after 5 μM of luciferin addition to the supernatant', choice2='Confocal fluorescence microscopy after Mito-RTP staining of the cells', choice3='Differential centrifugation extraction of mitochondria followed by the Glucose Uptake Colorimetric Assay Kit ', choice4="Flow cytometry after labeling with 2.5 μM 5,5',6,6'-Tetrachloro-1,1',3, 3'-tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine iodide", correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_43
proposed answer: We need to identify which experiment gives the least insight into mitochondrial function. Assays measuring ATP (luciferase), membrane potential (JC-1), and mitochondrial mass/morphology (Mito-RTP) are directly informative. Measuring glucose uptake in isolated mitochondria is irrelevant because mitochondria do not import glucose directly, so this assay won’t reveal mitochondrial effects of the drug.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_8_43
proposed answer: To identify the least relevant experiment, we check which assay fails to probe mitochondrial function or energy metabolism. Choice 3 measures glucose uptake, a cytosolic process, and does not reflect mitochondrial roles. Thus it does not help elucidate the drug’s mitochondrial effects.
