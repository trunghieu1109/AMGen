Since E is defined as π²ħ²/(2mL²), this simplifies to Eₙ = n²·E.; answer: The energy levels are Eₙ = n²·E. Thus: E₁ = E, E₂ = 4E, E₃ = 9E, …\nReflexion CoT agent hioH, calculating energies, thinking: Using the result Eₙ = n²·E from sub-task 1, simply substitute n=1,2,3.; answer: Ground state energy (n=1): E; first excited state energy (n=2): 4E; second excited state energy (n=3): 9E.\nCritic agent O1KN, providing feedback, thinking: The use of Eₙ = n²E is mathematically correct for a single, non‐interacting particle in an ideal, infinitely deep 1D box. However, this approach assumes (1) no inter‐particle interactions, (2) perfect infinite potential walls, (3) nonrelativistic dynamics, and (4) neglect of spin beyond degeneracy. When extending to multiple identical fermions one must also enforce the Pauli exclusion principle in assigning particles to levels and account for spin degeneracy.; answer: Applying Pauli’s principle to four spin-½ fermions gives total energies: ground state 2·1²E + 2·2²E = 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 18E. These results still ignore interactions, finite well depth, higher-dimensional effects, and relativistic corrections.\nReflexion CoT agent hioH, refining energy calculations, thinking: Using the formula E_n = n^2·E from sub-task 1 and substituting n=1,2,3.; answer: Ground state energy (n=1): E; First excited state energy (n=2): 4E; Second excited state energy (n=3): 9E.\nCoT agent ri0f, calculating total energy for ground state, thinking: Each energy level n has E_n = n^2E and holds up to two spin-½ particles.
