{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Four identical spin-1/2 particles are placed in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. Calculate the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system in terms of energy  E.\n(Here E= pi^2 \\hbar^2 /2mL^2 )&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;4E, 10E, 50E&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;10E, 15E, 18E\n&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;4E, 10E, 15E&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;30E, 39E, 50E&#39;}. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 2: Calculate the ground state energy (n=1), first excited state energy (n=2), and second excited state energy (n=3) for a single particle using the results from subtask 1. 

 ### thinking #2 by Chain-of-Thought Agent hioH:
Using the formula E_n = n^2·E from sub-task 1 and substituting n=1,2,3.

### answer #2 by Chain-of-Thought Agent hioH:
Ground state energy (n=1): E; First excited state energy (n=2): 4E; Second excited state energy (n=3): 9E.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 3: Determine the total energy of the system of four identical spin-1/2 particles in the ground state configuration, considering the Pauli exclusion principle and the available energy states.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
