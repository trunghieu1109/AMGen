{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Four identical spin-1/2 particles are placed in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. Calculate the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system in terms of energy  E.\n(Here E= pi^2 \\hbar^2 /2mL^2 )&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;4E, 10E, 50E&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;10E, 15E, 18E\n&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;4E, 10E, 15E&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;30E, 39E, 50E&#39;}.

### Sub-task 7: Compile the calculated energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state into a final result. 

 ### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent qjmi:
Ground state: 10E; First excited state: 15E; Second excited state: 18E

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 8: Compare the calculated energies with the provided choices to determine the correct answer.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
