Question: Example(question='Four identical spin-1/2 particles are placed in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. Calculate the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system in terms of energy  E.\n(Here E= pi^2 \\hbar^2 /2mL^2 )', choice1='4E, 10E, 50E', choice2='10E, 15E, 18E\n', choice3='4E, 10E, 15E', choice4='30E, 39E, 50E', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_8_44
proposed answer: Each energy level n has E_n = n^2E and holds up to two spin-½ particles. In the ground‐state configuration, fill n=1 with 2 particles: 2×1^2E=2E; then n=2 with 2 particles: 2×2^2E=8E. Total energy=2E+8E=10E.

Answer:E_total = 10E
Extracted answer: E_total = 10E
Correct answer: 1
