        "Both products are validated. Protonation of the alkene in ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene by HBr leads to carbocation formation at C-3, which cyclizes via the aryl oxygen. A six-membered ring yields 3,3,4-trimethylchromane; a five-membered ring yields 3-isopropyl-3-methyl-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran. Their substituents and saturation levels agree with the original side chain and reaction conditions.": "95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval: (0.0%, 0.0%), Median: 0.0%"
