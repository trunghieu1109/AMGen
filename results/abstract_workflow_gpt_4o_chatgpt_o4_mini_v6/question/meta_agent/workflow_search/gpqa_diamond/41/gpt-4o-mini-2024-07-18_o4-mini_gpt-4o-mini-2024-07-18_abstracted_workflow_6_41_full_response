The equilibrium temperature ratios are stated as 1.4 between Planet1 and Planet2 and 2.3 between Planet2 and Planet3. The mass ratios are 1.15 between Planet1 and Planet2 and 1.35 between Planet2 and Planet3.; answer: Equilibrium temperature ratios: Planet1/Planet2 = 1.4; Planet2/Planet3 = 2.3. Mass ratios: Planet1/Planet2 = 1.15; Planet2/Planet3 = 1.35.\nReflexion CoT agent YwVb, calculating equilibrium temperatures, thinking: To calculate absolute equilibrium temperatures, we need the actual temperature for at least one planet as a reference. Without that, we can only express them in terms of an unknown reference T₀.; answer: [TOO_HARD]\nPlease provide the equilibrium temperature of one of the planets (e.g., Planet2) as a reference so we can compute the others.\nCritic agent wD3S, providing feedback, thinking: Critical evaluation: The equilibrium temperature estimates based solely on ratios and an unknown reference lack absolute scaling; they assume equal albedo (0.3) which may not hold across different planets. These calculations also neglect greenhouse effects, atmospheric composition, heat redistribution, emissivity variations, stellar variability, and orbital eccentricity. Uncertainties in transit timing variations (TTV)–derived masses and semi-major axes further propagate into the temperature estimates, so any absolute values would be approximate at best.; answer: [TOO_HARD]\nPlease provide the absolute equilibrium temperature of one planet (e.g., Planet2) as a reference so we can compute the actual temperatures and assess their validity properly.\nReflexion CoT agent YwVb, refining equilibrium temperature calculations, thinking: Absolute equilibrium temperatures cannot be determined without at least one known reference temperature. We can only express each planet’s temperature in terms of an unknown T_ref (e.g., Planet2’s temperature).; answer: Planet2 = T_ref\nPlanet1 = 1.4 × T_ref\nPlanet3 = T_ref ÷ 2.3\n[TOO_HARD]\nPlease provide the equilibrium temperature of one of the planets (e.g., Planet2) as a reference so we can compute the absolute equilibrium temperatures.\nCoT agent nUsZ, calculating equilibrium temperatures, thinking: Absolute equilibrium temperatures cannot be computed without a known reference temperature, stellar luminosity, or orbital distances. With only temperature ratios and identical albedo, we can express each planet’s temperature relative to an unknown reference (e.g., Planet2’s temperature).; answer: Planet2 = T_ref\nPlanet1 = 1.4 × T_ref\nPlanet3 = T_ref ÷ 2.3\n[TOO_HARD]\nPlease provide the equilibrium temperature of one planet (e.g., Planet2) or the stellar luminosity and orbital distances so we can compute absolute equilibrium temperatures.\nCoT agent X9Cd, deriving orbital periods, thinking: Kepler’s third law for circular orbits gives P ∝ a^{3/2}, and equilibrium temperature T_eq ∝ a^{-1/2} (for identical albedo and stellar properties), so a ∝ T_eq^{-2} and hence P ∝ T_eq^{-3}. With T1 = 1.4\u2009T_ref and T3 = T_ref/2.3, we get P1 ∝ (1.4\u2009T_ref)^{-3}, P3 ∝ (T_ref/2.3)^{-3}, and thus P3/P1 = (1.4*2.3)^3 ≃ 33.4.; answer: P1 ∝ (1.4\u2009T_ref)^{-3}, P2 ∝ T_ref^{-3}, P3 ∝ (T_ref/2.3)^{-3}, so P3/P1 = (1.4×2.3)^3 ≃ 33.4.\nCoT agent s2vz, determining orbital period factor, thinking: Using Kepler’s third law and the relation T_eq ∝ a^{-1/2}, we find P ∝ T_eq^{-3}.
