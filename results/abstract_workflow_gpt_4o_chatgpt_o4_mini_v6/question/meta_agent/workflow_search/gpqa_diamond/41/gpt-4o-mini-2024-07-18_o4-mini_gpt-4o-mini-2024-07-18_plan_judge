Question: Example(question='Astronomers are studying a system of three exoplanets (Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3) with circular orbits discovered through the TTV method. They have found that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 2.3. They have also found that the ratio of the masses between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.15, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 1.35. By what factor is the orbital period of Planet3 larger than that of Planet1, if the albedo for all three planets is equal to 0.3 (similar to that of Earth)?', choice1='~ 4.4', choice2='~ 33.4', choice3='~ 10.4', choice4='~ 3.2', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_6_41
proposed answer: Based on sub-task 6, we found P3/P1 ≃(1.4×2.3)^3≈33.4, which corresponds to choice 2 (≈33.4).

proposed answer: To apply Kepler’s Third Law for absolute orbital periods we need the star’s mass (or an absolute reference period or distance). Using only temperature ratios and equal albedo lets us derive the ratio of semi-major axes (a₃/a₁ ≈10.4) and thus the period ratio (P₃/P₁ ≈(a₃/a₁)^(3/2) ≈33.4), but not the individual periods.

Answer:P₃/P₁ ≈ 33.4
[TOO_HARD]
Please provide the star’s mass or at least one planet’s orbital period or orbital distance so that absolute orbital periods can be calculated.
Extracted answer: P₃/P₁ ≈ 33.4
