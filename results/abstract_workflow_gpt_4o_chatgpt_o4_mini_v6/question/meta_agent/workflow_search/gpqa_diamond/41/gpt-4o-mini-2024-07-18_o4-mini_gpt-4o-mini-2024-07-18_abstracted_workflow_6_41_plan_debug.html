    <pre>Related original question:

{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Astronomers are studying a system of three exoplanets (Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3) with circular orbits discovered through the TTV method. They have found that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 2.3. They have also found that the ratio of the masses between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.15, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 1.35. By what factor is the orbital period of Planet3 larger than that of Planet1, if the albedo for all three planets is equal to 0.3 (similar to that of Earth)?&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;~ 4.4&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;~ 33.4&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;~ 10.4&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;~ 3.2&#39;}. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 6: Determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1 based on the calculated orbital periods. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent s2vz:
Using Kepler’s third law and the relation T_eq ∝ a^{-1/2}, we find P ∝ T_eq^{-3}. Given T1/T2 = 1.4 and T2/T3 = 2.3, then P3/P1 = (1.4×2.3)^3 ≃ 33.4.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent s2vz:
B)

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 7: Select the correct answer choice based on the calculated factor from subtask 6.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
