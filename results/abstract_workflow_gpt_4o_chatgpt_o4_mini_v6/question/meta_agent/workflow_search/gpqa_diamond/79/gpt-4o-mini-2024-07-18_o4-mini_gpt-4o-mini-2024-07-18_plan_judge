Question: Example(question='You come across an algorithm that gives the following output (written as input -> output):\n\nAGG -> 115\nTGCTGA -> 176\n\nWhat value does ACAGTGACC give?', choice1='333', choice2='315', choice3='351', choice4='185', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_1_79
proposed answer: With only two input–output pairs (AGG→115 and TGCTGA→176) and four nucleotide types, we have two equations but four unknown weights (w(A), w(C), w(G), w(T)). This yields infinitely many solutions. Any chosen weights that satisfy the two given equations can produce arbitrary outputs for ACAGTGACC. Without further constraints or examples, the mapping is underdetermined and the predicted output cannot be uniquely determined.

Answer:333
[TOO_HARD]
Please provide additional input–output examples or specify the weighting scheme (per-base values or positional multipliers) so that a unique transformation rule can be derived.
Extracted answer: 333
Correct answer: 1

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_49_79
proposed answer: With only two mappings provided and no explicit rule for converting nucleotides to numbers, any prediction is speculative. The placeholder prediction for ACAGTGACC was 351, matching choice C.

Answer:C)
[TOO_HARD]
Please provide additional input–output pairs or specify the numeric encoding for each nucleotide to deduce the rule accurately.
