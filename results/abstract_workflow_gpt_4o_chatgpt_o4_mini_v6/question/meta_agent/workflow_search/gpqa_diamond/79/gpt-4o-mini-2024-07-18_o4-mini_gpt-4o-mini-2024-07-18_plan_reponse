This yields infinitely many solutions. Any chosen weights that satisfy the two given equations can produce arbitrary outputs for ACAGTGACC. Without further constraints or examples, the mapping is underdetermined and the predicted output cannot be uniquely determined.\n\nAnswer:333\n[TOO_HARD]\nPlease provide additional input\u2013output examples or specify the weighting scheme (per-base values or positional multipliers) so that a unique transformation rule can be derived.",
