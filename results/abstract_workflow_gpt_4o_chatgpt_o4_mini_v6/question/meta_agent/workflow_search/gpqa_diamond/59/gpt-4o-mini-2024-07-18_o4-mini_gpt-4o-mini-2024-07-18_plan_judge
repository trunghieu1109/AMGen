Question: Example(question='An intelligent civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud has engineered an extraordinary spacecraft capable of traveling at a substantial fraction of the speed of light. The average lifetime of these aliens is roughly 150 solar years.  Now, having Earth as their destination in mind, they are determined to travel with this spacecraft at a constant speed of 0.99999987*c, where c is the speed of light. Approximately, how long will it take for their 22 years old astronaut (from the point of view of the astronaut) to reach the Earth using this incredibly fast spacecraft?', choice1='72 years', choice2='The astronaut will die before reaching to the Earth.\n', choice3='77 years', choice4='81 years', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_6_59
proposed answer: From sub-task 5, the astronaut’s age at arrival is 105 years. Comparing to the civilization’s average lifespan of 150 solar years shows 105 < 150, so the astronaut survives the journey.

Answer:The astronaut will be 105 years old on arrival, which is less than the average lifespan of 150 years, so they will reach Earth before dying.
Extracted answer: The astronaut will be 105 years old on arrival, which is less than the average lifespan of 150 years, so they will reach Earth before dying.
Correct answer: 3

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_47_59
proposed answer: We use time = distance/speed. Distance is 163,000 light-years, speed is 0.99999987 c. Dividing gives 163,000 ly / 0.99999987 c ≈ 163,000 years.

Answer:Approximately 163,000 years.
Extracted answer: Approximately 163,000 years.
Correct answer: 3
