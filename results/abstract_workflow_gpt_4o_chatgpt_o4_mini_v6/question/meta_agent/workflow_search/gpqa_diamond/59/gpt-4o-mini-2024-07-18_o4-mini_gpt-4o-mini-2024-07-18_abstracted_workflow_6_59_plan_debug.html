    <pre>Related original question:

{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;An intelligent civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud has engineered an extraordinary spacecraft capable of traveling at a substantial fraction of the speed of light. The average lifetime of these aliens is roughly 150 solar years.  Now, having Earth as their destination in mind, they are determined to travel with this spacecraft at a constant speed of 0.99999987*c, where c is the speed of light. Approximately, how long will it take for their 22 years old astronaut (from the point of view of the astronaut) to reach the Earth using this incredibly fast spacecraft?&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;72 years&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;The astronaut will die before reaching to the Earth.\n&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;77 years&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;81 years&#39;}. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 5: Determine the astronaut&#39;s age at the end of the journey by adding the time experienced by the astronaut (from subtask 4) to their current age (22 years). 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent 2EpY:
We have the astronaut&#39;s current age of 22 years and from sub-task 4 the proper time experienced during the journey is approximately 83 years. Adding these gives the astronaut’s age at arrival.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent 2EpY:
105 years

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Evaluate the astronaut&#39;s age at the end of the journey against their average lifespan (150 solar years) to conclude whether they will reach Earth before dying.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>From sub-task 5, the astronaut’s age at arrival is 105 years. Comparing to the civilization’s average lifespan of 150 solar years shows 105 &lt; 150, so the astronaut survives the journey.

Answer:The astronaut will be 105 years old on arrival, which is less than the average lifespan of 150 years, so they will reach Earth before dying.</pre>
