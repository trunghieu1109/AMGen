Starting from |3,0,0⟩ (l=0,m=0), the first photon must take l→1 and m→{–1,0,1}. From each |2,1,m⟩ the second photon decays to |1,0,0⟩ (l=0,m=0) with Δl=–1 and Δm=–m, which for m=–1,0,+1 gives Δm=+1,0,–1 (all allowed). Thus all three m‐values are valid intermediates.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent Eu4m:\nElectric‐dipole selection rules require Δl=±1 and Δm=0,±1. Starting from |3,0,0⟩ (l=0,m=0), the only allowed intermediate states in the n=2 shell have l=1 and m=0,±1. From each |2,1,m⟩ the decay to |1,0,0⟩ again obeys Δl=–1 and Δm=∓m, so all three m‐values are allowed. Without the explicit radial matrix elements or oscillator strengths one cannot assign numerical branching ratios.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent hMyx:\nDipole selection rules require Δl=±1 and Δm=0,±1. Starting from |3,0,0⟩ (l=0, m=0), the only allowed intermediate states have l=1 and m=−1,0,+1. From each of these, a second dipole transition can bring the atom to |1,0,0⟩ (l=0, m=0) with Δl=−1 and Δm=equal to the negative of the intermediate m. Thus all three m‐channels are valid.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent KLbg:\nFor two successive electric‐dipole (E1) transitions we require Δl=±1 and Δm=0,±1. Starting from |n=3, l=0, m=0⟩ the first step must go to l=1 with m₁=–1,0,+1. From each of these |2,1,m₁⟩ states a second E1 step can reach the final |1,0,0⟩ (Δl=–1, Δm=∓m₁). Hence there are three allowed two‐step routes.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent nriT:\nThe allowed two‐step dipole transition routes are:\n1) |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n2) |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n3) |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,–1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n\n### answer by Debate Agent Eu4m:\nPossible dipole‐allowed two‐step transition routes:\n1) |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n2) |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n3) |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,–1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n[TOO_HARD]\nPlease provide the radial transition matrix elements or relative oscillator strengths so that the branching probabilities for each path can be computed.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent hMyx:\nPossible transition routes:\n|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,−1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n\n### answer by Debate Agent KLbg:\nPossible two‐step dipole transition routes from |3,0,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩:\n\n1) |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n2) |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n3) |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,–1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 3: Make final decision on the valid transition routes and their probabilities.\n\nIf the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the "answer" entry and justify why you think so in the "thinking" entry'}], sub_tasks=None, agents='CoT agent GOEk, analyzing quantum states, thinking: The question asks to identify the initial, intermediate, and final states from the listed dipole transitions.
