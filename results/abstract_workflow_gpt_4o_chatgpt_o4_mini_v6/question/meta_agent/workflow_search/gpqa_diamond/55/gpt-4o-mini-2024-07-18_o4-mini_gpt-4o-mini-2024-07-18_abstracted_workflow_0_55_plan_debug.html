### Sub-task 4: Evaluate the transition probabilities for each route and determine the correct probability for the decay process based on the quantum mechanical principles. 

 ### thinking by Debate Agent Rril:
The angular part of each dipole matrix element from |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,m⟩ has |CG|^2=1/3 for m=−1,0,+1. Assuming identical radial integrals, the branch to each |2,1,m⟩ is equally likely (1/3). The subsequent decay to |1,0,0⟩ occurs with unit probability regardless of m, so the overall probability for the |2,1,0⟩ route is 1/3.

### thinking by Debate Agent smsc:
For each two-step dipole decay from |3,0,0⟩ via an intermediate |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩, the only m-dependence comes from the angular Clebsch–Gordan coefficients, which each have |CG|^2=1/3 for m=−1,0,+1. Assuming the radial matrix elements ⟨2,1∥r∥3,0⟩ and ⟨1,0∥r∥2,1⟩ are independent of m, each route thus carries equal weight. Therefore the probability for the route |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ is 1/3.

### thinking by Debate Agent BQak:
The branching ratios depend only on the angular (Clebsch–Gordan) factors, since the radial integrals ⟨2,1‖r‖3,0⟩ and ⟨1,0‖r‖2,1⟩ are m‐independent and cancel in the relative weights. Each dipole step contributes a factor |CG|²=1/3. Hence each two‐step route via m=–1,0,+1 has weight (1/3)·(1/3)=1/9. Normalizing over the three routes gives 1/3 for each.

### thinking by Debate Agent gz2q:
The two‐step decay from |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,m⟩→|1,0,0⟩ involves two dipole emissions. Assuming the radial integrals ⟨2,1∥r∥3,0⟩ and ⟨1,0∥r∥2,1⟩ are independent of m, each angular Clebsch–Gordan coefficient squared entering both steps is 1/3. Hence each m‐route picks up a factor (1/3)·(1/3), but when normalized over the three m‐channels the branching fraction per route is 1/3.

### answer by Debate Agent Rril:
B)

### answer by Debate Agent smsc:
B)

### answer by Debate Agent BQak:
Each of the three routes
|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,–1⟩→|1,0,0⟩,
|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩,
|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,1⟩→|1,0,0⟩
each carries probability 1/3.

### answer by Debate Agent gz2q:
P(|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,1⟩→|1,0,0⟩)=1/3; P(|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩)=1/3; P(|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,−1⟩→|1,0,0⟩)=1/3

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Make final decision on the transition probabilities.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>The dipole transition rates depend only on the angular Clebsch–Gordan coefficients, which for |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,m⟩ are |CG|²=1/3 for each m=−1,0,+1. The second step to |1,0,0⟩ is m‐independent. Normalizing over the three equal angular channels gives 1/3 for each two‐step route.

Answer:P(|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,1⟩→|1,0,0⟩)=1/3; P(|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩)=1/3; P(|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,−1⟩→|1,0,0⟩)=1/3</pre>
