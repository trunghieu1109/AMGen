Assuming identical radial integrals, the branch to each |2,1,m⟩ is equally likely (1/3). The subsequent decay to |1,0,0⟩ occurs with unit probability regardless of m, so the overall probability for the |2,1,0⟩ route is 1/3.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent smsc:\nFor each two-step dipole decay from |3,0,0⟩ via an intermediate |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩, the only m-dependence comes from the angular Clebsch–Gordan coefficients, which each have |CG|^2=1/3 for m=−1,0,+1. Assuming the radial matrix elements ⟨2,1∥r∥3,0⟩ and ⟨1,0∥r∥2,1⟩ are independent of m, each route thus carries equal weight. Therefore the probability for the route |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ is 1/3.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent BQak:\nThe branching ratios depend only on the angular (Clebsch–Gordan) factors, since the radial integrals ⟨2,1‖r‖3,0⟩ and ⟨1,0‖r‖2,1⟩ are m‐independent and cancel in the relative weights. Each dipole step contributes a factor |CG|²=1/3. Hence each two‐step route via m=–1,0,+1 has weight (1/3)·(1/3)=1/9. Normalizing over the three routes gives 1/3 for each.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent gz2q:\nThe two‐step decay from |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,m⟩→|1,0,0⟩ involves two dipole emissions. Assuming the radial integrals ⟨2,1∥r∥3,0⟩ and ⟨1,0∥r∥2,1⟩ are independent of m, each angular Clebsch–Gordan coefficient squared entering both steps is 1/3. Hence each m‐route picks up a factor (1/3)·(1/3), but when normalized over the three m‐channels the branching fraction per route is 1/3.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent Rril:\nB)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent smsc:\nB)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent BQak:\nEach of the three routes\n|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,–1⟩→|1,0,0⟩,\n|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩,\n|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,1⟩→|1,0,0⟩\neach carries probability 1/3.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent gz2q:\nP(|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,1⟩→|1,0,0⟩)=1/3; P(|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩)=1/3; P(|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,−1⟩→|1,0,0⟩)=1/3\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Make final decision on the transition probabilities.\n\nIf the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the "answer" entry and justify why you think so in the "thinking" entry'}], sub_tasks=None, agents='CoT agent Zk3s, analyzing quantum states, thinking: To address Sub-task 1, I will list each state’s quantum numbers (n, l, m), note their energy ordering (depends only on n), and recall dipole selection rules Δl = ±1, Δm = 0, ±1 to show which transitions are allowed.; answer: State classifications:\n|3,0,0〉 → n=3, l=0, m=0 (third energy level, s-orbital)\n|2,1,1〉 → n=2, l=1, m=+1 (second level, p-orbital, m=+1)\n|2,1,0〉 → n=2, l=1, m=0 (second level, p-orbital, m=0)\n|2,1,−1〉 → n=2, l=1, m=−1 (second level, p-orbital, m=−1)\n|1,0,0〉 → n=1, l=0, m=0 (ground state, s-orbital)\n\nEnergy ordering: E₃ > E₂ > E₁ since Eₙ ∝ −1/n².\nDipole selection rules: Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1.\nThus from |3,0,0〉 (l=0) the only allowed one-photon transitions are to l=1 states in n=2: i.e. |2,1,±1〉 or |2,1,0〉, and then each of those can decay to |1,0,0〉 (l=0) by another dipole step.\nCoT-SC agent GBRQ, identifying dipole transitions, thinking: Dipole selection rules: Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1.

From each of these p-states (l=1, m=−1,0,+1) the only dipole-allowed transition to |1,0,0⟩ (l=0,m=0) requires Δl=−1 and Δm=−m’, which is ±1 or 0 accordingly and is allowed in all three cases.; answer: Possible dipole transitions:\n1) |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,−1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n2) |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n3) |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\nCoT-SC agent xc8m, identifying dipole transitions, thinking: Dipole transitions require Δl=±1 and Δm=0,±1.

Starting from |3,0,0〉 (l=0, m=0), allowed one-photon transitions must go to l=1 states in n=2: those are |2,1,1〉, |2,1,0〉, and |2,1,−1〉 (all satisfy Δl=+1, Δm=+1,0,−1). From each of these intermediate p-states, the second dipole transition to the ground state |1,0,0〉 (l=0, m=0) must satisfy Δl=−1 and Δm = −1,0,+1. Thus all three p-states can decay to |1,0,0〉: |2,1,1〉→|1,0,0〉 (Δm=−1), |2,1,0〉→|1,0,0〉 (Δm=0), |2,1,−1〉→|1,0,0〉 (Δm=+1).; answer: The possible allowed electric dipole transitions are:\n\nFirst step (n=3→n=2):\n|3,0,0〉 → |2,1,1〉  (Δl=+1, Δm=+1)\n|3,0,0〉 → |2,1,0〉  (Δl=+1, Δm=0)\n|3,0,0〉 → |2,1,−1〉 (Δl=+1, Δm=−1)\n\nSecond step (n=2→n=1):\n|2,1,1〉  → |1,0,0〉 (Δl=−1, Δm=−1)\n|2,1,0〉  → |1,0,0〉 (Δl=−1, Δm=0)\n|2,1,−1〉 → |1,0,0〉 (Δl=−1, Δm=+1)\nReflexion CoT agent iUyZ, assessing transition impact, thinking: Sub‐task 3 requires combining the angular‐momentum Clebsch–Gordan coefficients for each one‐photon step and the radial dipole integrals.  Without performing the full Wigner–Eckart decomposition and evaluating the radial overlap integrals, we cannot obtain the exact branching ratios.  The simple equal‐weight argument (1/3 for each m) neglects differences in radial matrix elements and the fact that the second step has its own Clebsch–Gordan factors.  To resolve these consistently, one must decompose the total two‐photon amplitude into separate angular and radial parts and compute both sets of CG coefficients.; answer: Subtask 3: The overall two‐step branching probability via an intermediate |2,1,m⟩ is given by the product of the squared angular Clebsch–Gordan coefficients for each dipole step and the squared radial dipole integrals.  A full evaluation requires:  \n1) Compute radial integrals ⟨2,1‖r‖3,0⟩ and ⟨1,0‖r‖2,1⟩ separately.  \n2) Apply the Wigner–Eckart theorem to extract the angular CG factors for m=−1,0,+1 in each step.  \n3) Multiply these squared factors to get the branching ratios for each route.  [TOO_HARD]\nPlease decompose the calculation into separate radial and angular parts and provide the explicit Clebsch–Gordan coefficients for each photon emission step so that the numerical probabilities can be obtained.\nCritic agent vXrE, providing feedback, thinking: Your answer correctly notes equal contributions from each m route under simple assumptions but also identifies the missing radial integrals and neglected level splittings.; answer: All three intermediate m = -1, 0, +1 routes contribute equally to the two-step decay |3,0,0> to |1,0,0> under the assumption of identical radial integrals and trivial Clebsch-Gordan factors, yielding probability approx 1/3 each. Limitations: radial dipole matrix elements and energy denominator effects are not computed, fine and hyperfine structure and precise CG magnitudes are neglected. [TOO_HARD]\nPlease provide the explicit radial matrix elements <2,1||r||3,0> and <1,0||r||2,1> as well as detailed Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for each emission step to obtain accurate branching ratios.\nReflexion CoT agent iUyZ, refining transition impact, thinking: Full evaluation of the two‐step branching probabilities requires both angular Clebsch–Gordan factors and radial dipole integrals. Without explicit evaluation of the radial matrix elements ⟨2,1∥r∥3,0⟩ and ⟨1,0∥r∥2,1⟩, one cannot obtain absolute numbers. However, if these radial integrals are assumed identical for all m, then the only m‐dependence comes from the angular Clebsch–Gordan coefficients, which yield equal squared magnitudes for m=−1,0,+1.; answer: Each intermediate route’s branching fraction is proportional to the product of the squared angular Clebsch–Gordan coefficients and the squared radial dipole integrals. Assuming the radial integrals ⟨2,1∥r∥3,0⟩ and ⟨1,0∥r∥2,1⟩ are independent of m, the only m-dependence comes from the angular CG factors, which all have |CG|^2=1/3.
