The strong band at 1720 cm⁻¹ corresponds to a C=O stretch, and its high frequency is more typical of an ester carbonyl rather than an amide. Together, these suggest the presence of a primary amino group and an ester functionality.; answer: Primary amine (–NH₂) indicated by the 3420 and 3325 cm⁻¹ bands; ester carbonyl (C=O) indicated by the 1720 cm⁻¹ band.\nCoT agent h6Al, analyzing 1H NMR data, thinking: The 1H NMR shows five distinct signals (t, bs, q, d, d) with integrations matching an ethyl group (3H+2H), a 2H broad singlet (NH2), and two sets of aromatic 2H doublets. This gives five unique proton environments consistent with an ethyl 4-aminobenzoate framework.; answer: Five distinct proton environments:\n1) 1.20 ppm, triplet, 3H (CH3 of an ethyl group)\n2) 4.5 ppm, quartet, 2H (CH2 of the ethyl group)\n3) 4.0 ppm, broad singlet, 2H (NH2)\n4) 7.0 ppm, doublet, 2H (aromatic H ortho to NH2)\n5) 8.0 ppm, doublet, 2H (aromatic H ortho to ester)\nCoT-SC agent dv2X, combining insights, thinking: IR data show N–H stretches (3420, 3325 cm⁻¹) → primary amine; strong C=O stretch at 1720 cm⁻¹ → ester carbonyl. ¹H NMR shows signals for an ethyl group (t, q), a 2H broad NH₂, and two aromatic 2H doublets in a para pattern. The molecular formula C₉H₁₁NO₂ fits an ethyl 4-aminobenzoate framework.; answer: Possible structural features:\n- A benzene ring with two substituents in para positions (evidenced by two aromatic 2H doublets).\n- A primary amino group (–NH₂) attached to the ring (IR N–H stretches; 4.0 ppm bs, 2H).\n- An ethyl ester group (–COOCH₂CH₃) attached to the ring (IR ester C=O at 1720 cm⁻¹; 1.20 ppm t, 3H; 4.5 ppm q, 2H).\nCoT-SC agent 5KuD, combining insights, thinking: IR data show primary amine (3420, 3325 cm⁻¹) and ester carbonyl (1720 cm⁻¹). ¹H NMR shows CH₃ triplet (1.20 ppm), CH₂ quartet (4.5 ppm), NH₂ broad singlet (4.0 ppm), and two aromatic doublets (7.0, 8.0 ppm, each 2H) indicating a para-disubstituted benzene. Together these imply an ethyl ester of a para-aminobenzoic acid.; answer: Possible structural features:\n- Aromatic (benzene) ring\n- Para-disubstitution pattern (two sets of 2H aromatic signals)\n- Primary amine group (–NH₂)\n- Ester functionality (COO–)\n- Ethyl moiety (CH₂ quartet, CH₃ triplet)\nCoT-SC agent Ep2d, combining insights, thinking: Combining the IR data (NH2 stretches at 3420/3325 cm⁻¹, ester C=O at 1720 cm⁻¹) with the 1H NMR (ethyl signals, broad NH2, two aromatic doublets each integrating to 2H) indicates an ethyl ester bearing a primary amino group on a para-disubstituted benzene ring.; answer: Possible structural features:\n1) Primary amino group (–NH2) evident from the two N–H stretches and broad 2H singlet.\n2) Ester carbonyl (C=O) indicated by the strong 1720 cm⁻¹ IR band.\n3) Ethyl moiety (CH3 triplet at 1.20 ppm, CH2 quartet at 4.5 ppm) linked to the carbonyl.\n4) Para-disubstituted aromatic ring (two sets of equivalent aromatic protons as 2H doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm).\nDebate agent SXVY, round 0, evaluating choices, thinking: The IR shows NH2 stretches and a strong ester C=O at 1720 cm⁻¹.
