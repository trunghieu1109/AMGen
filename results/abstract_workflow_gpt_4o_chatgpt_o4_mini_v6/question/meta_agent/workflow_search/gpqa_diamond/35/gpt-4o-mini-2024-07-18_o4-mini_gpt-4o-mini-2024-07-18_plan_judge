proposed answer: The observed absorption energy (~3.9 × 10⁻⁶ eV) falls in the microwave hyperfine regime close to the HI 21 cm line (5.9 μeV), which arises in cold (T∼50–150 K) atomic hydrogen. Warm or molecular phases have transitions at much higher energies, so the line traces the cold atomic interstellar medium.

proposed answer: The majority of agents (xPNG, 5YKQ, zFNZ) place high-resolution 21 cm absorption first, followed by comparative emission vs. absorption, all-sky emission surveys, and column-density mapping. These four are the strongest direct analogs for the z≈0.3 absorber, with the remaining six ranked by their descending direct relevance to optical depth, spin temperature, and foreground removal. No additional information is needed to finalize this prioritization.

Answer:1. High-resolution 21 cm absorption toward continuum sources
2. Comparative 21 cm emission vs. absorption analysis
3. All-sky 21 cm emission surveys
4. Column density mapping of cold H I
5. H I self-absorption studies
6. Velocity-resolved spectra
7. Multi-sightline absorption variability
8. Zeeman splitting in the 21 cm line
9. H I envelopes around molecular clouds
10. Joint H I/dust continuum observations
