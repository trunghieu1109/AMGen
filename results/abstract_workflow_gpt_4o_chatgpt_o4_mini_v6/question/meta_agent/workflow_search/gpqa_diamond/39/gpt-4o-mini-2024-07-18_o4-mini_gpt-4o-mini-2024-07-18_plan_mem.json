        "Summary: In synthetic organic chemistry labs, thin-layer chromatography (TLC) is used to monitor reaction progress and assess purity. When two compounds travel the same distance on the TLC plate\u2014i.e., they have nearly identical Rf values\u2014their spots overlap or appear \u201con top of each other.\u201d This overlapping indicates the compounds have similar polarities, making it difficult to distinguish or separate them by TLC. Consequently, the chemist\u2019s complaint refers to a separation failure due to close polarity profiles of the synthesized compounds.": "95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval: (0.0%, 0.0%), Median: 0.0%"
