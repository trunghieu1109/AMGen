Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_12
proposed answer: Epoxide opening of product 2 yields two C2-epimers which after esterification give (1S,2R,4R)- and (1S,2S,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate. The choice corresponding to one valid isomer of product 4 is (1S,2R,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate (choice 4).

proposed answer: Esterification with DCC/DMAP converts the C1–OH of product 3 into its propionate without altering its configuration, preserving the trans relationship with the C2–OMe and original C4–isopropyl stereochemistry. The only choice matching C1=S, C2=R, C4=R is choice 4.
