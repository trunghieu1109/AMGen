Question: Example(question='You want to create a mouse embryonic chimera with induced pluripotent stem cells from somatic cells of various tissues. You are interested in the iPSCs fate in the embryo and their co-localization with apoptotic events. The iPSC cells are labeled with a mRaspberry fused under a lineage-specific promoter for each cell type. You inject the dedifferentiated cells into the 32-cell stage blastocyst and track them over 48. Every 12 h, you prepare embryos with the TUNEL - FITC staining and observe under the confocal microscope.\n\nWhat is the first thing you notice?', choice1='green signal colocalizes with the red signal', choice2='there is no green signal', choice3='cell line-specific red signals label different organelles', choice4='cytoplasmic localization of the red signal', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_75
proposed answer: At the first 12 h time point post-injection, the only detectable signal is the red mRaspberry reporter, which is clearly localized in the cytoplasm; no green TUNELâ€“FITC signal is yet observable.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_16_75
proposed answer: At the first 12-hour time point, TUNEL-FITC staining yields negligible FITC signal, so no green apoptotic signal is detected around the injected iPSCs.
