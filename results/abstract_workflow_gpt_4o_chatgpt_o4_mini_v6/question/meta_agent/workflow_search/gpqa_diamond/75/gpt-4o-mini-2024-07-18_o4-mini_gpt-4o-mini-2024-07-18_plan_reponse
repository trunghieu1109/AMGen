            "You want to create a mouse embryonic chimera with induced pluripotent stem cells from somatic cells of various tissues. You are interested in the iPSCs fate in the embryo and their co-localization with apoptotic events. The iPSC cells are labeled with a mRaspberry fused under a lineage-specific promoter for each cell type. You inject the dedifferentiated cells into the 32-cell stage blastocyst and track them over 48. Every 12 h, you prepare embryos with the TUNEL - FITC staining and observe under the confocal microscope.\n\nWhat is the first thing you notice?",
