The formula can be seen as two terminal isopropenyl groups ((CH3)2C=CH–) linked by a –CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2– bridge.  That gives 12 carbons total and 22 hydrogens, with two C=C double bonds.  Bond counts are: C–H (22), C–C single (9), C=C double (2).; answer: The molecule is a 1,3,5-trimethyl-2,6-dimethylene-heptane skeleton (two terminal isopropenyl groups linked by CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2).  Bond types present:  • C–H sigma bonds: 22  • C–C sigma bonds: 9  • C=C bonds (each with one sigma + one pi): 2\nCoT-SC agent hwqv, counting bonds, thinking: Based on the structure from subtask 1 ((CH3)2C=CH–CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2–CH=C(CH3)2), we count all sigma and pi bonds: each CH3 contributes three C–H bonds, CH2 contributes two, CH contributes one, plus the linking C–C single bonds and the two C=C double bonds.; answer: C–H bonds: 22\nC–C single bonds: 9\nC=C double bonds: 2\nCoT-SC agent 81K0, counting bonds, thinking: Based on the structure from subtask 1, the molecule has two terminal isopropenyl groups linked by a CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2 bridge, giving a total of 12 C and 22 H atoms. Counting bonds: each H is bonded via C–H (22), the carbon skeleton has 9 C–C singles, and there are 2 C=C double bonds.; answer: C–H bonds: 22; C–C single bonds: 9; C=C double bonds: 2\nCoT-SC agent F5p3, counting bonds, thinking: Based on the structural analysis from subtask 1 (12 carbons, 22 hydrogens, two C=C double bonds), the bond count is directly obtained: each hydrogen contributes one C–H bond, the carbon framework gives the C–C singles and C=C bonds.; answer: C–H bonds: 22; C–C single bonds: 9; C=C double bonds: 2\nCoT agent HoFb, calculating total bond energy, thinking: Calculate each bond type total: C–H: 22 × 400 = 8800 kJ/mol; C–C single: 9 × 200 = 1800 kJ/mol; C=C double: 2 × 300 = 600 kJ/mol.

To form the molecule from its elements in their standard states, we first atomize 12 C atoms (12×1000=12000\u2009kJ) and 11 H₂ molecules (11×100=1100\u2009kJ), total atomization =13100\u2009kJ. Then forming 22 C–H, 9 C–C and 2 C=C bonds releases 11200\u2009kJ.
