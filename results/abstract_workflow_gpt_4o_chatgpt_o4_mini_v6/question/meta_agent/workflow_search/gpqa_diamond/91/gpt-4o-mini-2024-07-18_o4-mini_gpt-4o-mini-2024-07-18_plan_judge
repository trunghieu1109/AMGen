Question: Example(question='Calculate the enthalpy of formation of (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Given,\nEnthalpy of atomization of carbon = 1000 kJ/mol.\nBond energy of H-H = 100 kJ/mol\nBond energy of C-C = 200 kJ/mol\nBond energy of C=C = 300 kJ/mol\nBond energy of C-H = 400 kJ/mol', choice1='11200 kJ/mol', choice2='1900 kJ/g', choice3='11.44 kJ/g', choice4='67.4 kJ/mol', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_91
proposed answer: The molar mass of C₁₂H₂₂ ≈ (12×12)+(22×1)=166 g/mol. Converting 1900 kJ/mol to per gram: 1900/166 ≈ 11.45 kJ/g, matching choice3 (C).

Answer:C)

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_8_91
proposed answer: The molar mass of C12H22 is 166 g/mol. Converting 1900 kJ/mol ÷ 166 g/mol gives approximately 11.4458 kJ/g, which rounds to 11.44 kJ/g, corresponding to choice C.
