### Sub-task 4: Convert the enthalpy of formation calculated in Sub-task 3 from kJ/mol to kJ/g. 

 ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent xpNb:
The molar mass of C12H22 is approximately 12×12 + 22×1 = 166 g/mol. Converting 1900 kJ/mol to kJ/g: 1900 kJ/mol ÷ 166 g/mol ≈ 11.4458 kJ/g, which rounds to 11.44 kJ/g.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent 9rBr:
The enthalpy of formation from Sub-task 3 is 1900 kJ/mol. The molar mass of C12H22 is 12×12 + 22×1 = 166 g/mol. Converting: 1900 kJ/mol ÷ 166 g/mol ≈ 11.45 kJ/g.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent 50HK:
To convert 1900 kJ/mol to kJ/g, compute the molar mass of C12H22: 12×12 + 22×1 = 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol. Then 1900 kJ/mol ÷ 166 g/mol ≈ 11.4458 kJ/g ≈ 11.44 kJ/g.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent 6hep:
The enthalpy of formation from Sub-task 3 is 1900 kJ/mol. The molar mass of C₁₂H₂₂ is (12×12)+(22×1)=144+22=166 g/mol. Converting: 1900 kJ/mol ÷166 g/mol ≈11.45 kJ/g, rounded to two decimal places gives 11.44 kJ/g.

### answer #1 by Debate Agent xpNb:
11.44 kJ/g

### answer #1 by Debate Agent 9rBr:

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Make final decision on converted enthalpy.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
