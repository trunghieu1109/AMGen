### Sub-task 5: Convert the enthalpy of formation calculated in subtask 4 from kJ/mol to kJ/g if necessary, to match the format of the provided choices. 

 ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent U8U2:
First determine the molar mass of C12H22: (12×12)+(22×1)=166 g/mol. Then convert 1900 kJ/mol to per gram: 1900 kJ/mol÷166 g/mol≈11.45 kJ/g, matching choice 3.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent Dpgj:
The molecule is C12H22 with molar mass ≈166.3 g/mol. Converting 1900 kJ/mol to kJ/g: 1900/166.3 ≈11.42 kJ/g, matching choice3.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent qWh9:
From subtask 4 ΔHf = 1900 kJ/mol. Molar mass of C12H22 ≈ 12×12 + 22×1 = 166 g/mol. Thus per gram: 1900 kJ/mol ÷ 166 g/mol ≈ 11.45 kJ/g, matching choice C.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent cJJF:
Calculate molar mass: 12×12.01 + 22×1.008 ≃ 166.3 g/mol. Enthalpy per gram = 1900 kJ/mol ÷ 166.3 g/mol ≃ 11.44 kJ/g, which is choice 3 (C).

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 5: Make final decision on enthalpy of formation in kJ/g.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
