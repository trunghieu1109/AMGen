Adding 3 neutrons gives mass number 6. The nuclide Li-6 has charge +3e and mass ≈6.015\u2009u (≈5.615×10⁻²⁷\u2009kg).; answer: For X = Li with 3 neutrons: atomic number Z = 3, mass number A = 6; charge = +3\u2009e; mass ≈ 6.015\u2009u (≈5.615×10⁻²⁷\u2009kg).\nCoT agent Wcx8, understanding RHIC context, thinking: The question asks for a descriptive overview of RHIC’s acceleration chain and why reaching 0.96c matters, based on Li-6 properties. All needed context is standard accelerator physics, so it is answerable without extra data.; answer: The Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory is a dual‐ring synchrotron designed to accelerate and collide heavy nuclei (like Li-6) at relativistic speeds.  Starting from an ion source, Li-6 ions are first stripped and injected into a linear accelerator (LINAC), then transferred into a booster synchrotron, and finally into two opposing superconducting rings.  Radio‐frequency (RF) cavities in each stage impart successive energy “kicks,” while dipole magnets keep the beam on its curved path.  Achieving a beam velocity of 0.96 c corresponds to a Lorentz factor γ≈3.6, which: 1) ensures the ions attain sufficiently high kinetic energy to create the extreme energy densities needed to probe quark–gluon plasma; 2) introduces pronounced relativistic effects (time dilation and length contraction) that must be managed in beam timing and collision synchronization; and 3) defines the collision energy per nucleon for experiments studying nuclear interactions under extreme conditions.\nCoT-SC agent MFyw, calculating rest mass energy, thinking: We have mass of Li-6 ~6.015\u2009u and 1\u2009u corresponds to 931.494\u2009MeV/c^2. Thus E₀ = 6.015×931.494\u2009MeV ≈5607\u2009MeV (≈5.607\u2009GeV).; answer: Rest mass energy E₀ ≈6.015\u2009u ×931.494\u2009MeV/u =5607\u2009MeV (≈5.607\u2009GeV)\nCoT-SC agent sn7H, calculating rest mass energy, thinking: Using the mass from Sub-task 1, m ≈5.615×10⁻²⁷ kg, and E₀=mc² with c=2.998×10⁸ m/s:\nE₀=5.615×10⁻²⁷ kg×(2.998×10⁸ m/s)²≈5.046×10⁻¹⁰ J.  Converting to eV: 5.046×10⁻¹⁰ J/(1.602×10⁻¹⁹ J/eV)≈3.15×10⁹ eV≈3.15 GeV.; answer: Rest mass energy E₀ ≈5.05×10⁻¹⁰ J (≈3.15 GeV).\nCoT-SC agent 126o, calculating rest mass energy, thinking: Using m≈5.615×10⁻²⁷\u2009kg and c=2.998×10⁸\u2009m/s: E₀=mc²=5.615×10⁻²⁷·(2.998×10⁸)²≈5.05×10⁻¹⁰\u2009J. Converting to MeV (1\u2009MeV=1.602×10⁻¹³\u2009J): E₀≈5.05×10⁻¹⁰/1.602×10⁻¹³≈3156\u2009MeV≈3.156\u2009GeV.; answer: Rest mass energy ≈5.05×10⁻¹⁰\u2009J ≈3.156\u2009GeV\nCoT agent TxhS, determining total energy for speed 0.96c, thinking: To find the total energy E for v=0.96c, use E=γm₀c². From sub-task 3, m₀c²≈3.156 GeV. γ=1/√(1−0.96²)=1/√0.0784≈3.571.
