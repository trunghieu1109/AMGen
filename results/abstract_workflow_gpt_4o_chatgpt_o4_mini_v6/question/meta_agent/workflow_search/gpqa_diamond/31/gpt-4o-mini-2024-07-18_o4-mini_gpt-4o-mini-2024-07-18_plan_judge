Question: Example(question='What is the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c?\n\nKnowing that X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons.\n\nPS: the precision of the energy is at 1e-4.', choice1='18.475 GeV', choice2='20.132 GeV', choice3='23.069 GeV', choice4='21.419', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_1_31
proposed answer: We compared the calculated energy 11.27 GeV to each choice: |18.475−11.27|=7.205, |20.132−11.27|=8.862, |23.069−11.27|=11.799, |21.419−11.27|=10.149. Choice A has the smallest difference.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_31
proposed answer: Computed total energy E ≃ γE₀ ≃ 3.5714×5.6015 GeV ≃ 20.0054 GeV. Comparing deviations: |20.132−20.0054| ≃ 0.1266, which is the smallest among the choices, so B) is the closest match.
