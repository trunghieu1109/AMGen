The Lewis\u2010acid\u2010promoted [4+2] between 1-vinylcyclohex-1-ene and methyl hex-2-ynoate directly builds the bicyclic core with the ester at C1, and subsequent hydrogenation/isomerization installs the octahydro framework and propyl side chain efficiently.\n\nAnswer:Final decision: Adopt Route 1 \u2013 Lewis\u2010acid\u2010catalyzed intermolecular Diels\u2013Alder between 1-vinylcyclohex-1-ene (diene) and methyl hex-2-ynoate (dienophile), followed by catalytic hydrogenation (H\u2082, Pd/C) and base\u2010mediated isomerization (e.g. DBU) to furnish methyl 2-propyl-1,2,4a,5,6,7,8,8a-octahydronaphthalene-1-carboxylate.
