Question: Example(question='S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one is treated with tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride and triethylamine, forming product 1.\n\n1 is treated with Ph2CuLi at low temperature, followed by benzyl bromide, forming product 2.\n\n2 is treated with LDA and iodomethane at low temperature, forming product 3.\n\nProduct 3 is treatd with aqueous HCl, forming final product 4. what is the structure of product 4?', choice1='(2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one', choice2='(2R,3R,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one', choice3="(1S,2S,4S)-1-(benzyloxy)-2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-ol", choice4='(2S,3S,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one', correct_index=0)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_10_27
proposed answer: Product 4 is 2-benzyl-3-phenyl-4-hydroxy-6-methylcyclohexan-1-one. Among the given stereoisomers, only choice1 describes a 2-benzyl, 3-phenyl, 4-hydroxy, 6-methyl cyclohexanone, corresponding to (2S,3R,4S,6S).

proposed answer: Aqueous HCl cleaves the TBS protecting group at C4 to regenerate the free 4-OH without altering other stereocenters. The substitution pattern and stereochemistry remain (2S,3R,4S,6S), matching choice A.
