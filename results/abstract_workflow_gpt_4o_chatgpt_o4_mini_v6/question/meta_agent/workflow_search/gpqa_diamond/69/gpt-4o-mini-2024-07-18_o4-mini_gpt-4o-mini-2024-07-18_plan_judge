proposed answer: Product E is phosphine (PH₃), which has a trigonal pyramidal geometry and thus belongs to the C₃ᵥ point group. None of the provided choices (C₂, C₂ᵥ, D₄ₕ, D_∞ₕ) matches C₃ᵥ, indicating the options are incomplete.

Answer:None of the above; the correct symmetry group is C₃ᵥ
[TOO_HARD]
Please include C₃ᵥ among the choice options or provide revised options that contain the correct symmetry group.
Extracted answer: None of the above; the correct symmetry group is C₃ᵥ
Correct answer: 1

proposed answer: Chromyl chloride (CrO2Cl2) has a tetrahedral geometry with two identical oxo and two identical chloro ligands. The arrangement has a C2 rotation axis through the Cr atom bisecting the O–Cr–O and Cl–Cr–Cl angles, plus two perpendicular mirror planes—one containing the O ligands and the other containing the Cl ligands. This corresponds to the C2v point group.

Answer:C2v
Extracted answer: C2v
Correct answer: 1
