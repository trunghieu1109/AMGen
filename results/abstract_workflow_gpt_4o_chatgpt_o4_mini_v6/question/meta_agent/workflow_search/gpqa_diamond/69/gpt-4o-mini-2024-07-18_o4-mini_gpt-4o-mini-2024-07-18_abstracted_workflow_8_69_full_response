It reacts with 2\u2009equiv of gaseous HCl (D) to give the extremely hazardous chromyl chloride, CrO2Cl2 (E).; answer: Product E is chromyl chloride, CrO2Cl2, with a tetrahedral chromium center bound to two oxo and two chloro ligands.\nSC-CoT agent h74Q, determining symmetry group of E, thinking: Chromyl chloride (CrO2Cl2) is a pseudo-tetrahedral molecule with two double‐bonded oxygens and two chlorines. It has a C2 axis and two σv planes, giving it C2v symmetry.; answer: B)\nSC-CoT agent h74Q, determining symmetry group of E, thinking: Chromyl chloride (CrO2Cl2) has a central chromium bonded to two oxo and two chloro ligands in a tetrahedral arrangement. Because there are two pairs of identical ligands, the molecule belongs to the C2v point group.; answer: B)\nSC-CoT agent h74Q, determining symmetry group of E, thinking: Chromyl chloride (CrO2Cl2) has a tetrahedral geometry with two identical oxo and two identical chloro ligands. The arrangement has a C2 rotation axis through the Cr atom bisecting the O–Cr–O and Cl–Cr–Cl angles, plus two perpendicular mirror planes—one containing the O ligands and the other containing the Cl ligands. This corresponds to the C2v point group.; answer: C2v\nCoT agent F6Sf, analyzing reaction of A with B, thinking: The sub-task asks for analysis of the reaction A + 8 B → C, but the identities and structures of A and B are not specified. Without knowing what A and B actually are (organic skeleton, metal, halogen, etc.), I can only describe the stoichiometry (1:8) and general reaction type (likely a halogenation or coordination/redox process). This lack of chemical detail makes a full mechanistic or nature-of-reaction analysis impossible, so I flag it as too hard and request more information.; answer: The reaction consumes A and B in a 1:8 molar ratio to give product C.  Stoichiometry: 1 A + 8 B → C.  Nature of reaction: likely a halogenation or coordination/redox process in which B (a diatomic gas) oxidizes or adds across reactive sites of solid A, yielding a bright red halogenated or coordination complex C.  [TOO_HARD]\nPlease provide the chemical identities or structures of A and B (or more detail on the bonding changes) so that the mechanism and reaction class can be fully analyzed.\nCoT agent nZCh, investigating reaction of C with water, thinking: The sub-task asks for the mechanism and details of the hydrolysis of C to give A, F and G, but without knowing the structures of C or A (and thus what functional groups are present), we cannot pinpoint the reaction center, intermediates, or exact acid identities.  I therefore provide a generic hydrolysis outline and flag the task as too hard without specific structures.; answer: Hydrolysis of C proceeds by nucleophilic attack of water at the electrophilic site in C, leading to cleavage of the C–X bond (where X is the leaving group in C), reformation of A, and generation of two acids: F (the strong acid from the better leaving group) and G (the weaker acid from the less labile moiety).\nStoichiometry: 1 equiv C + 1 equiv H₂O → 1 equiv A + 1 equiv F + 1 equiv G\nReaction type: acid-promoted hydrolysis (nucleophilic substitution at a polar bond).\n[TOO_HARD]\nPlease provide the chemical identities or structures of C (and A, F, G) or detailed bonding changes so the specific hydrolysis mechanism and acid identities can be fully analyzed.\nCoT agent qdVD, examining reaction of D with B, thinking: Gas B and gas D react in a 1:1 ratio to give H, which is used as a solvent. A common example is ethylene (gas D) reacting with chlorine (gas B) to form 1,2-dichloroethane (ethylene dichloride), a widely used solvent. This reaction is an electrophilic addition of Cl2 across the C=C bond.; answer: H is 1,2-dichloroethane (ethylene dichloride), formed by the addition of Cl2 to ethylene.', iteration_idx=-1)]
