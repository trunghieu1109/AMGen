    <pre>Related original question:

{&#39;question&#39;: &#34;Astronomers are currently observing a star with a radius equal to that of the Sun. One  hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The star has an effective temperature (Teff) of 6000K, and the spots exhibit a temperature difference of 1000K. As only one hemisphere is spotty, photometric time-series observations will reveal periodic variations in brightness due to rotational modulation. Interestingly, this situation can closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet. To produce the same amplitude signal in the star&#39;s light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!), what should be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the radius of the host star (i.e. Rpl/Rstar)?&#34;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;~0.07&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;~0.32&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;~0.11&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;~0.39&#39;}.

### Sub-task 6: Calculate the required radius of the hypothetical exoplanet relative to the radius of the host star (Rpl/Rstar) to match the brightness variation caused by the dark spots. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent JoWY:
We equate the spot‐induced modulation amplitude ΔF_spot to the transit depth ΔF_pl=(R_pl/R_star)^2. A hemisphere of the star has 20% area at 5000 K and 80% at 6000 K, so its flux is (0.2×(5000/6000)^4+0.8)=0.8965 times that of an unspotted hemisphere. The flux drop when the spotted hemisphere rotates into view is (0.5−0.5×0.8965)/0.5≈0.102, giving R_pl/R_star=√0.102≈0.32.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent JoWY:
B)

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 7: Select the most appropriate answer choice based on the calculated radius of the hypothetical exoplanet.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
