{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Imagine a point charge q is moving with a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$, where t is time, with respect to the origin. Let $\\vec{r}$ be the field point, where the field is observed, with respect to the origin of the same reference frame, and  $\\vec{d}$ be the vector from the point where the electromagnetic field was generated at some earlier time $tr$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$. The velocity of the moving charge q at the field generating instant $tr$ is $\\vec{v}$. What are the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (\\vec{A}) at time t, satisfying $t &gt; tr$, and position $\\vec{r}$? In obtaining the expressions, use the notation of $c-&gt;$ light speed in vacuum, $\\epsilono -&gt;$ permitivity of free space and $\\mu_o$ is the permeability.&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)\n&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)\n&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}\n&#39;}.

### Sub-task 4: Compute the scalar potential V(r, t) using the charge q, distance d, and velocity v at time tr. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent PrzK:
The scalar potential for a moving point charge is given by the Liénard–Wiechert potential evaluated at the retarded time, yielding V(r,t)=qc/[4πε₀(dc–d·v)].

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent PrzK:
V(r,t) = \dfrac{q c}{4\pi\epsilon_0\bigl(d c - \vec d \cdot \vec v\bigr)}

### Sub-task 3: Calculate the velocity v of the charge at the field generating instant tr based on its trajectory s(t). 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent Ii65:
The velocity of the charge is the time derivative of its trajectory evaluated at the retarded time t_r.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent Ii65:
\vec{v} = \left.\frac{d\vec{s}(t)}{dt}\right|_{t = t_r}

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 5: Compute the vector potential A(r, t) using the scalar potential V(r, t) and the velocity v.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>Using the Liénard–Wiechert potentials at the retarded time, the vector potential is given by A = μ₀qc v / [4π(dc – d·v)], which equivalently can be written as (v/c²) times the scalar potential V.
