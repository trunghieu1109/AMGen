These are the well-known retarded potentials for a moving point charge, namely the Liénard–Wiechert potentials.; answer: Sub-task 2: The scalar potential V and vector potential A are retarded potentials, specifically the Liénard–Wiechert scalar and vector potentials.\nCoT agent YYjq, deriving scalar potential, thinking: The scalar potential for a moving point charge is given by the Liénard–Wiechert retarded potential. One solves the wave equation with a delta‐function source, evaluates at the retarded time tr satisfying |r–s(tr)|=c(t–tr), and finds V(r,t)=q/[4πε0 (|d|–d·v/c)], which can be rewritten as qc/[4πε0 (d·c–d·v)].; answer: V(r,t)=\\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0\\bigl(|d| - \\frac{d\\cdot v}{c}\\bigr)}\\Bigg|_{t_r} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0\\bigl(dc - d\\cdot v\\bigr)}\\Bigg|_{t_r}\nCoT agent 8Ic3, deriving vector potential, thinking: The vector potential follows directly from the Liénard–Wiechert potentials and is proportional to the charge’s velocity divided by the same retarded denominator that appears in the scalar potential. Using A = μ₀ v V c²/q and substituting V from Sub‐task 3 gives the standard LW result.; answer: A(r,t)=μ₀ q v/(4π (|d|−d·v/c))|_{t_r} = μ₀ c q v/[4π (c d−d·v)]|_{t_r}\nCoT agent Gzwf, calculating distance, thinking: We need the distance d from where the field was emitted at the retarded time tr (when the charge was at s(tr)) to the observation point r. The vector d is defined as r – s(tr), so the scalar distance is its magnitude.; answer: d = |r – s(tr)| = sqrt[(r – s(tr)) · (r – s(tr))]\nCoT agent NyFd, computing final expressions, thinking: We combine the results of Sub‐tasks 3, 4, and 5. The retarded time t_r is defined implicitly by |d|=c(t−t_r) with d=r−s(t_r). The standard Liénard–Wiechert potentials then give V and A as functions of d and v=d’s time‐derivative at t_r.; answer: Let d=r−s(t_r) with |d|=c(t−t_r). Then\nV(r,t)=\\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0\\bigl(|d|−\\frac{d\\cdot v}{c}\\bigr)}\\Big|_{t_r},\nA(r,t)=\\frac{\\mu_0\\,q\\,v}{4\\pi\\bigl(|d|−\\frac{d\\cdot v}{c}\\bigr)}\\Big|_{t_r}\nCoT agent hOno, evaluating derived expressions, thinking: The derived LW potentials are V = q/(4πε0(|d|−d·v/c)) = qc/(4πε0(c|d|−d·v)) and A = μ0qv/(4π(|d|−d·v/c)) = μ0qc v/(4π(c|d|−d·v)), which exactly matches choice2.; answer: B)\nCoT agent QanT, selecting correct choice, thinking: The derived Liénard–Wiechert potentials yield V = qc/(4πε₀(c|d| − d·v)) and A = μ₀qc v/(4π(c|d| − d·v)), matching choice2, which corresponds to option B).; answer: B)', iteration_idx=-1)]
