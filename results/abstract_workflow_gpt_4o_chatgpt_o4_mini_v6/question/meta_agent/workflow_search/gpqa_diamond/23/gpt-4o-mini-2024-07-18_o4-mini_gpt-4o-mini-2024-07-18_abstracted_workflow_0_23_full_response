Benzene hydrogenates to cyclohexane (C6H12) under severe conditions, and methylcyclopentane is already C6H12.

A widely used solvent C₆H₁₂ is cyclohexane. Mixture Y must be two saturated C₆H₁₂ isomers (e.g. cyclohexane + methylcyclopentane) so it does not decolorize Br₂. The catalytic ‘‘disproportionation’’ of mixture X (non‐conjugated C₆H₁₀ alkenes) over Pt gives those saturated isomers. The only plausible pair of non‐conjugated C₆H₁₀ liquids that decolorize Br₂ are cyclohexene and methylcyclopentene.; answer: Mixture X consists of the two non-conjugated alicyclic alkenes cyclohexene and methylcyclopentene (both C₆H₁₀), which decolorize bromine water and upon Pt‐catalyzed heating disproportionate to the saturated isomers (cyclohexane + methylcyclopentane).\nCoT agent FFYG, classifying liquids in mixture X, thinking: Mixture X comprises two nonconjugated cyclic alkenes (cyclohexene and methylcyclopentene). Each contains a single C=C bond, which reacts with bromine water to decolorize it. Their molecular structures are alicyclic unsaturated hydrocarbons with one double bond.; answer: Cyclohexene: non-conjugated cyclic alkene (alicyclic unsaturated hydrocarbon), decolorizes bromine water.\nMethylcyclopentene: non-conjugated cyclic alkene (alicyclic unsaturated hydrocarbon), decolorizes bromine water.\nCoT agent Cemg, assessing impact of platinum treatment, thinking: Under Pt and heat, cyclohexene and methylcyclopentene undergo transfer hydrogenation (disproportionation): one molecule dehydrogenates to benzene, the other hydrogenates to methylcyclopentane. These products are aromatic/saturated and no longer react with Br2.; answer: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of benzene and methylcyclopentane. Both are inert toward bromine water (benzene is stabilized by aromaticity; methylcyclopentane is fully saturated).\nCoT agent uNti, evaluating characteristics of mixture Y, thinking: Mixture Y results from a transfer hydrogenation (disproportionation) of the two unsaturated liquids in X over Pt/heat. One component is dehydrogenated to an aromatic (benzene) and the other is hydrogenated to a saturated cycloalkane (methylcyclopentane). Neither benzene (due to aromatic stabilization) nor methylcyclopentane (fully saturated) can add bromine, so the mixture fails to decolorize bromine water.; answer: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of benzene and methylcyclopentane. Both are inert toward bromine water—benzene’s aromatic ring is stabilized and does not undergo addition under these conditions, and methylcyclopentane is fully saturated. Mixture Y is formed by disproportionation of the two unsaturated components of X over platinum at high temperature.\nCoT agent LLSf, determining molecular formula of hydrocarbon Z, thinking: Given that hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y over platinum yields a single substance Z, and mixture Y contains benzene (C6H6) and methylcyclopentane (C6H12), both must convert to the same saturated product. Benzene hydrogenates to cyclohexane (C6H12) under severe conditions, and methylcyclopentane is already C6H12. The mass fraction of hydrogen in C6H12 is 12/(6×12+12)≈0.1429 or 14.28%, matching the given data.; answer: Molecular formula of Z is C6H12.\nCoT agent tP52, calculating total hydrogen atoms in mixture X, thinking: Mixture Y is benzene (C6H6) and methylcyclopentane (C6H12), formed by disproportionation of two C6H10 alkenes: cyclohexene and methylcyclopentene. Both are C6H10 (10 H atoms each), so the total H in the two liquids is 10 + 10 = 20.; answer: 20', iteration_idx=-1)]
