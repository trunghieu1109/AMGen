Question: Example(question='If an equimolar mixture X of two liquids, which decolorizes bromine water, is treated with platinum when heated, then an equimolar mixture Y of two other liquids is formed as a result of disproportionation, which does not decolorize bromine water. Hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y in the presence of platinum under rather severe conditions gives only one substance, a certain hydrocarbon Z (mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%), which is a constituent of mixture Y and widely used as a solvent. Substance Z does not react further with hydrogen. There are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of the compounds of mixture X.\nIndicate the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X.', choice1='22', choice2='12', choice3='16', choice4='18', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_23
proposed answer: Mixture Y is benzene (C6H6) and methylcyclopentane (C6H12), formed by disproportionation of two C6H10 alkenes: cyclohexene and methylcyclopentene. Both are C6H10 (10 H atoms each), so the total H in the two liquids is 10 + 10 = 20.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_23
proposed answer: Mixture X (cyclohexene C6H10 + 1,4-cyclohexadiene C6H8) and mixture Y (benzene C6H6 + cyclohexane C6H12) both hydrogenate fully to cyclohexane. The mass fraction of H (12/84â‰ˆ14.28%) confirms cyclohexane. Its molecular formula is C6H12, containing 12 hydrogen atoms.

Answer:Z is cyclohexane, molecular formula C6H12, total hydrogen atoms = 12.
Extracted answer: Z is cyclohexane, molecular formula C6H12, total hydrogen atoms = 12.
Correct answer: 3
