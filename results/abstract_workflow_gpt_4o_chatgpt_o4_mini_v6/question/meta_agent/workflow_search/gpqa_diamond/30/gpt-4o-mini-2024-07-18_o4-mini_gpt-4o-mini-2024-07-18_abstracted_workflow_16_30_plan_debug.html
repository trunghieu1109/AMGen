Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 3: Identify the chemical structure of product 3 formed from the reaction of product 2 with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide, focusing on aldol condensation reactions. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent NZFj:
A base-catalyzed aldol condensation between p-nitrobenzaldehyde and acetone gives the α,β-unsaturated ketone (a chalcone derivative) in the trans (E) configuration.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent NZFj:
Product 3 is (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)-3-buten-2-one (p-nitrobenzalacetone), the α,β-unsaturated ketone formed by aldol condensation of p-nitrobenzaldehyde with acetone.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Analyze the molecular symmetry of product 3 to determine its symmetry group, considering symmetry elements and classification.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>Product 3, (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)-3-buten-2-one, is a fully planar molecule but lacks any proper rotation axes or inversion center: the only symmetry element is the mirror plane coinciding with the molecular plane. This corresponds to the Cs point group.
