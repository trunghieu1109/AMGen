Under typical conditions, the main isolable product is para-nitrotoluene (4-nitrotoluene).; answer: Product 1 is p-nitrotoluene (4-nitrotoluene), a benzene ring bearing a methyl group at C1 and a nitro group at C4.\nCoT-SC agent pXa2, determining product 2 structure, thinking: Starting from p-nitrotoluene (product 1), treatment with MnO₂ (a mild oxidant active at benzylic positions) in acidic media selectively oxidizes the benzylic methyl group to an aldehyde rather than a full carboxylic acid. Thus the methyl substituent at C1 becomes a –CHO group, while the nitro remains at C4.; answer: Product 2 is p-nitrobenzaldehyde (4-nitrobenzaldehyde): a benzene ring bearing a nitro group at C4 and an aldehyde at C1.\nCoT-SC agent 6lk7, determining product 2 structure, thinking: MnO2 in acidic conditions oxidizes the benzylic methyl of p-nitrotoluene to a carboxylic acid. The nitro substituent remains unchanged. Thus product 2 is p-nitrobenzoic acid.; answer: Product 2 is p-nitrobenzoic acid, i.e. a benzene ring with a COOH group at C1 and a NO2 group at C4.\nCoT-SC agent wYa9, determining product 2 structure, thinking: Oxidation of the benzylic methyl group on p-nitrotoluene under strong acidic conditions converts the –CH₃ into a –COOH. Thus product 2 is the corresponding benzoic acid derivative.; answer: Product 2 is 4-nitrobenzoic acid (a benzene ring bearing a carboxyl at C1 and a nitro at C4).\nCoT agent NZFj, identifying product 3 structure, thinking: A base-catalyzed aldol condensation between p-nitrobenzaldehyde and acetone gives the α,β-unsaturated ketone (a chalcone derivative) in the trans (E) configuration.; answer: Product 3 is (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)-3-buten-2-one (p-nitrobenzalacetone), the α,β-unsaturated ketone formed by aldol condensation of p-nitrobenzaldehyde with acetone.\nCoT agent J8J1, analyzing symmetry of product 3, thinking: Product 3, (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)-3-buten-2-one, is a fully planar molecule but lacks any proper rotation axes or inversion center: the only symmetry element is the mirror plane coinciding with the molecular plane.
