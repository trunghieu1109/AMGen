Question: Example(question='toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid, forming product 1.\n\n1 is treated with MnO2 and H2SO4, forming product 2.\n\n2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide, forming product 3.\n\nwhat is the molecular symmetry group of 3?', choice1='cs', choice2='c2h', choice3='c3', choice4='d2h', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_16_30
proposed answer: Product 3, (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)-3-buten-2-one, is a fully planar molecule but lacks any proper rotation axes or inversion center: the only symmetry element is the mirror plane coinciding with the molecular plane. This corresponds to the Cs point group.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_36_30
proposed answer: Product 3 has only a single mirror plane and no other symmetry elements, corresponding to point group Cs, which is choice A.
