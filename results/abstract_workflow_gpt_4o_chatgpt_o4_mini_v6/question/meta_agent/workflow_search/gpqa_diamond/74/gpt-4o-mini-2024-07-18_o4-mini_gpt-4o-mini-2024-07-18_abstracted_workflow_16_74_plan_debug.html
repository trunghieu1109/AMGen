    <pre>Related original question:

{&#39;question&#39;: &#34;You want to study the role of the GADD45G protein in a mouse model. You are highly interested in whether the IL-2-induced protein has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. You decide to create a transgenic mouse model with the inducible overexpression of the coding sequence for the GADD45G gene. You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus. For that purpose, you will modify the gene&#39;s coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein. You genetically engineer the plasmid and, aided by LipofectamineÂ®, transfect it into the Chinese hamster ovary cells. You select the antibiotic-resistant cell colonies to test the expression level of your construct. Once you begin, you observe that you are unable to overexpress your protein as you expected. In the series of tests you undertake to identify the cause, you realize that the sequence of the plus strand of your construct reads:\n\n\n5&#39;ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3&#39;\n\nYou annoyingly notice the reason.&#34;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;The ribosome terminated the translation early&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse&#39;}. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 5: Make final decision on the cause of the inability to overexpress the GADD45G protein. 

 ### thinking by Final Decision Agent IHlR:
Sub-tasks identified an unintended in-frame TGA stop codon immediately after the HA epitope, causing premature termination of translation and preventing full-length GADD45G expression.

### answer by Final Decision Agent IHlR:
B)

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Formulate a plan to address the identified issue, whether it involves modifying the construct, changing the expression system, or other strategies.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>We identified an unintended in-frame TGA stop codon immediately after the HA epitope causing premature translation termination. We need to remove or alter this stop codon and ensure proper reading frame and tag spacing to restore full-length expression.

Answer:1) Use site-directed mutagenesis to change the in-frame TGA stop codon following the HA tag to a sense codon (e.g. TGG for tryptophan) or restore the native GADD45G sequence. 2) Insert a short flexible linker (e.g. GGGGS)n between the HA epitope and GADD45G to improve folding and reduce steric hindrance. 3) Resequence the entire insert to confirm removal of premature stop codons and correct in-frame junctions. 4) Transfect the corrected construct into CHO cells and assess full-length GADD45G expression by Western blot using anti-HA and anti-GADD45G antibodies. 5) If expression is still suboptimal, consider alternative epitope tags or expression systems (viral vectors or different cell lines) to enhance protein stability and yield.</pre>
