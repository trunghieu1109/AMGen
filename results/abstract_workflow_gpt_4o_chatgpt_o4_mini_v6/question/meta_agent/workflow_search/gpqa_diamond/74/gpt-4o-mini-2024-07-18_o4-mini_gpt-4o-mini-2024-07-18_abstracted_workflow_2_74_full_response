In viral infection contexts, these functions could influence infected-cell fate and the host immune response. SARS-CoV-2 triggers strong cytokine responses and can dysregulate apoptosis and cell cycle; thus GADD45G may impact viral replication or infected-cell clearance. IL-2, a key T-cell growth factor, upregulates GADD45G expression in T lymphocytes, affecting their proliferation and survival. Because IL-2 levels and T‐cell responses are critical in COVID-19 pathogenesis, GADD45G could link IL-2 signaling to antiviral immunity or immunopathology.; answer: GADD45G is induced by IL-2 in T cells and other immune cells, where it functions in MAPK pathway modulation (p38/JNK), DNA repair, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. In the setting of SARS-CoV-2 infection, GADD45G may influence: 1) infected‐cell apoptosis, potentially limiting viral spread; 2) T‐cell proliferation and survival, affecting adaptive immunity; 3) cytokine signaling cascades that contribute to hyperinflammation. By coupling IL-2‐driven GADD45G expression with these antiviral and immunomodulatory actions, this protein could be a critical node in host defense against SARS-CoV-2 or a contributor to immunopathology.\nCoT agent tQRx, classifying transgenic model components, thinking: To classify the components of the transgenic mouse model, we must identify the genetic elements (the GADD45G coding sequence and the HA epitope tag), the vector and selection system used for modification in cells, the method of introducing the transgene into mice, and the strategy for inducible expression and detection of the recombinant protein.; answer: Components of the transgenic mouse model:\n1) GADD45G gene: The coding sequence of the mouse GADD45G gene serves as the gene-of-interest, inserted downstream of an inducible promoter (e.g. Tet-On system) to allow controlled overexpression in vivo.\n2) Influenza hemagglutinin (HA) antigenic determinant: A single HA epitope tag fused at the N-terminus of GADD45G for immunodetection and affinity purification of the recombinant protein using anti-HA antibodies.\n3) Gene modification vector and selection marker: A plasmid backbone containing the inducible promoter, HA-GADD45G fusion cassette, and an antibiotic resistance gene (e.g. neomycin) for selection of stable clones in CHO cells.\n4) In vitro validation: Lipofectamine®-mediated transfection of CHO cells with the HA-GADD45G plasmid, antibiotic selection of resistant colonies, and screening by anti-HA Western blot or immunofluorescence to confirm expression and tag integrity.\n5) Generation of transgenic mice: Introduction of the validated HA-GADD45G construct into mouse zygotes by pronuclear injection (or embryonic stem cell targeting), followed by implantation into pseudopregnant females to establish founder lines carrying the inducible HA-GADD45G transgene.\n6) Induction and protein expression in vivo: Administration of the inducer (e.g. doxycycline) to activate the Tet-On promoter, leading to expression of the HA-tagged GADD45G protein in target tissues, and subsequent detection/purification via anti-HA affinity methods.\nDebate agent blLv, round 0, transforming GADD45G gene, thinking: To engineer an N-terminal HA‐tagged GADD45G and anticipate why the construct might fail, one must describe the cloning strategy (PCR with HA‐tag primers, inclusion of linkers, vector choice, frame checks) and then scan the resulting sequence for common pitfalls: out‐of‐frame junctions, premature stop codons in the tag or at the tag–GADD45G junction, absence of a flexible linker leading to rapid degradation, suboptimal codons for mammalian expression, or cryptic splice/polyadenylation signals that truncate transcript. In this case, inspection of the provided plus‐strand reveals an in‐frame UAA stop codon immediately after the HA epitope, prematurely terminating translation before GADD45G is synthesized.; answer: 1) Cloning strategy:\n   • Design forward PCR primer to amplify mouse GADD45G ORF, appending at its 5′ end the HA epitope sequence (YPYDVPDYA) plus a short flexible linker (e.g. GSG) in frame.  \n   • Verify the primer adds no internal stop codons and places GADD45G in frame with the tag.  \n   • Clone the HA‐linker‐GADD45G PCR product into an inducible expression vector (e.g. Tet‐On) containing a mammalian Kozak sequence and an antibiotic resistance marker.  \n   • Sequence‐verify the junctions and full insert.  \n\n2) Sequence and expression evaluation:\n   • Frame check: confirm the HA codons (TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCT) align with the vector’s start codon without shifting.  \n   • Premature stop scan: the motif “TAA” (UAA) appears immediately after the HA tag, causing early termination before GADD45G.  \n   • Linker absence: without a flexible linker, the tag–protein junction may be sterically hindered or proteolyzed.  \n   • Codon usage: HA sequence and nearby GADD45G codons should be optimized for mouse to ensure efficient translation.  \n   \n3) Remediation:\n   • Remove the in‐frame UAA by silent mutagenesis or primer redesign so that the HA tag seamlessly fuses to the GADD45G start.  \n   • Introduce a short glycine‐serine linker between HA and GADD45G.  \n   • Re‐sequence the final construct, re‐transfect into CHO or mouse cells, and confirm full‐length expression by anti‐HA Western blot.\nDebate agent WtWJ, round 0, transforming GADD45G gene, thinking: To address sub-task 3, I need to describe how to fuse the HA epitope to the GADD45G coding region and then list potential pitfalls in the engineered construct—issues such as frame shifts, unintended stop codons, proteolytic sites, codon usage, and regulatory elements that could disrupt expression or function.; answer: 1) Designing the fusion:  \n   • Append the HA-tag nucleotide sequence (encoding YPYDVPDYA) immediately upstream (5') of the GADD45G start codon, ensuring that the HA tag and GADD45G ORFs are in the same reading frame.  \n   • Include a short flexible linker (e.g. GGGGS) between the HA sequence and GADD45G to reduce steric hindrance and protect against proteolytic cleavage.  \n   • Remove the native GADD45G start codon if you supply a single ATG at the HA tag to avoid dual initiation.  \n2) Cloning strategy:  \n   • PCR‐amplify the HA-GADD45G fusion using high-fidelity polymerase with primers that introduce necessary restriction sites (or homology arms for Gibson assembly).  \n   • Insert the PCR product into your inducible expression vector downstream of the chosen promoter (e.g. Tet-On).  \n   • Verify by restriction digest mapping and Sanger sequencing across the HA-GADD45G junction.  \n3) In silico evaluation for pitfalls:  \n   • Check for unintended in-frame stop codons (e.g. UAA, UAG, UGA) introduced by cloning scars or tag sequence that would truncate the protein.  \n   • Scan the fusion junction for cryptic splice sites, ribosomal pause sites, or secondary structures in the mRNA that could reduce translation efficiency.  \n   • Analyze codon usage in the HA tag and first 20 codons of GADD45G for rare codons in mouse/CHO cells; perform codon optimization if necessary.  \n   • Ensure no new internal restriction sites conflict with downstream subcloning steps.  \n   • Model the fusion protein to predict whether the HA tag might disrupt GADD45G folding or function; consider adding or repositioning linkers.  \n4) Experimental validation:  \n   • Transfect CHO cells and induce expression; use anti-HA Western blot to confirm full-length protein of expected MW.  \n   • If you observe lower-MW bands or no expression, map the precise N-terminal sequence to detect premature stops or proteolysis sites.  \n   • Confirm in vivo in transgenic mice by dosing inducer and performing anti-HA immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry to verify tag integrity and binding partners.  \n5) Common pitfalls seen here:  \n   • A UAA codon in the tag region inadvertently acts as a stop, causing early termination.  \n   • Absence of a flexible linker leads to rapid degradation of the nascent fusion.  \n   • Frame-shift at the tag-gene junction abolishes correct protein translation.  \n\nBy following these design checks and validations, you can detect and correct issues—such as unintended stop codons or proteolytic vulnerability—in your HA-GADD45G construct before moving into the mouse model.\nDebate agent usze, round 0, transforming GADD45G gene, thinking: To address Sub-task 3, I need to describe how to engineer the HA‐tagged GADD45G construct and then list possible problems introduced by that modification.  The answer must cover the cloning strategy (primer design, reading‐frame maintenance, linker inclusion, sequencing), in‐cell expression tests, and the troubleshooting of issues like premature stops, mRNA instability, proteolysis or misfolding due to the tag.; answer: 1) Cloning strategy:\n   a. Design forward PCR primer that fuses an ATG start codon, the 9-aa HA epitope (YPYDVPDYA) in frame, and a short flexible linker (e.g. GGGGS) upstream of the GADD45G coding sequence.  \n   b. Amplify the HA-linker-GADD45G fragment and insert it into the inducible expression vector (e.g. Tet-On) using restriction sites or Gibson assembly.  \n   c. Sequence the entire insert to confirm the correct reading frame, absence of cryptic stop codons, splice sites or frame shifts, and optimized mammalian codon usage.\n2) In‐vitro validation in CHO cells:\n   a. Transfect CHO cells with the HA-GADD45G vector using Lipofectamine®.  \n   b. Select antibiotic‐resistant clones and screen for expression by anti-HA Western blot and anti-GADD45G blot.  \n   c. Confirm mRNA levels by RT-qPCR to rule out transcriptional or mRNA stability issues.\n3) Potential issues and troubleshooting:\n   • Premature translation termination: ensure no inadvertent TAA/TAG/TGA codons are introduced in the tag or linker.  \n   • Proteolytic cleavage: without a flexible linker, the HA tag may be cleaved off; include a Gly-Ser linker of 5–10 residues.  \n   • Protein misfolding/instability: verify steady‐state protein half‐life (cycloheximide chase) and, if unstable, try C-terminal tagging or internal insertion.  \n   • mRNA secondary structure or cryptic splice sites: redesign codons to minimize strong stem–loops and eliminate AT-rich motifs that may trigger cryptic splicing.  \n   • Codon bias: optimize the HA-GADD45G sequence for murine preferred codons to maximize translation efficiency.  \n\nBy following these steps and checking each potential pitfall, you can generate a stable, HA-tagged GADD45G construct and identify why your initial construct failed to overexpress (e.g. missing linker led to proteolysis).\nDebate agent W4NK, round 0, transforming GADD45G gene, thinking: To transform GADD45G with the HA epitope we must fuse the 9-aa HA tag (YPYDVPDYA) in-frame at the N-terminus of GADD45G, include a flexible linker to prevent steric hindrance, codon-optimize the fusion for mouse, and place it under an inducible promoter. Once cloned, we must scan the entire ORF for unintended stop codons (e.g. the internal TAG we observed), confirm the correct reading frame and Kozak context, and check for cryptic splice sites or extreme GC content that could impede expression or stability.; answer: 1. Fusion strategy:  \n  • At the 5′ end of GADD45G, insert the HA coding sequence (TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCT) encoding YPYDVPDYA.  \n  • Add a 5×Gly–Ser (GGGGS) flexible linker between HA and GADD45G to reduce proteolysis or misfolding.  \n  • Include a Kozak consensus (GCCACC) immediately upstream of the HA start codon.  \n2. Cloning:  \n  • Synthesize the HA–linker–GADD45G cassette, codon-optimize for mouse, and clone into an inducible vector (e.g. Tet-On) with a suitable antibiotic marker.  \n3. Sequence evaluation:  \n  • Verify the ORF is in-frame from the HA start codon through the GADD45G stop.  \n  • Scan for internal stop codons: our current construct contains a TAG in the HA-GADD45G fusion that must be silently mutated.  \n  • Check GC content and avoid predicted strong secondary structures or cryptic splice motifs.  \n4. Validation:  \n  • Transiently express in CHO cells, induce expression, and run anti-HA Western/blot to confirm full-length protein.  \n  • Sequence individual clones to ensure no frame shifts or premature stops.  \nPotential issues to watch for:  \n  • Internal TAG (UAG) causing early termination – requires silent mutation.  \n  • High GC regions causing poor mRNA folding or transcriptional pausing.  \n  • Lack of flexible linker may lead to proteolysis or mislocalization.  \n  • Cryptic splice sites in the synthetic gene may lead to aberrant transcripts.\nFinal Decision agent, evaluating modified construct, thinking: The engineered HA-GADD45G fusion sequence contains an in-frame UAA (stop) codon immediately after the HA tag, causing premature termination of translation before GADD45G is synthesized.; answer: B)\nCoT agent xsBn, extracting features from modified construct, thinking: The construct’s plus-strand sequence begins with ATG (Met), then the HA‐tag coding region (YPYDVPDYA), but immediately after the tag’s Asp–Tyr–Ala (GAC\u2009TAC\u2009GCC) the next codon is TAA (UAA stop) leading to premature termination. Thus the HA is expressed but GADD45G is never translated. Other possible factors include mRNA secondary structure around the tag–GADD45G junction impairing ribosome readthrough, rare codons in the GADD45G region, or cryptic splice sites—but the primary defect is the in‐frame stop.; answer: Extracted features:\n1. Start codon (ATG) at position 1.\n2. Hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag coding sequence: ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCC (encoding YPYDVPDYA).\n3. Immediately following the HA tag is TAA (UAA) stop codon in-frame.\n4. Downstream GADD45G coding region never translated due to this stop.\n\nPotential causes for lack of overexpression:\n• Premature termination of translation at the in‐frame UAA stop codon.\n• Possible mRNA secondary structures or context around the stop could further decrease readthrough efficiency.\n• Rare codon usage or mRNA instability in the downstream GADD45G region (secondary factors).\n\nPrimary corrective action: remove or mutate the in‐frame UAA to a sense codon or insert a linker to restore the full open reading frame.\nCoT agent zZwM, identifying reasons for protein overexpression failure, thinking: The provided sequence contains an in‐frame TAA stop codon immediately following the HA tag (YPYDVPDYA), causing premature translation termination and preventing GADD45G expression.; answer: B)\nCoT agent Z3UP, selecting cause of protein overexpression issue, thinking: The sequence contains an in-frame TAA stop codon immediately after the HA tag, causing premature translation termination and preventing full-length protein expression.; answer: B)", iteration_idx=-1)]
