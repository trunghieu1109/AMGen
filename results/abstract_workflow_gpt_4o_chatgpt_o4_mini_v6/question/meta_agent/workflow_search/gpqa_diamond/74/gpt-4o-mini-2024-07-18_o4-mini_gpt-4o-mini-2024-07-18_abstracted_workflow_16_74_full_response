Question: {'question': "You want to study the role of the GADD45G protein in a mouse model. You are highly interested in whether the IL-2-induced protein has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. You decide to create a transgenic mouse model with the inducible overexpression of the coding sequence for the GADD45G gene. You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus. For that purpose, you will modify the gene's coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein. You genetically engineer the plasmid and, aided by Lipofectamine®, transfect it into the Chinese hamster ovary cells. You select the antibiotic-resistant cell colonies to test the expression level of your construct. Once you begin, you observe that you are unable to overexpress your protein as you expected.

The TGA codon appears immediately after the HA tag (plus a Lys), causing early termination of translation and preventing full-length protein expression.; answer: An unintended in-frame stop codon (TGA) is present right after the HA epitope tag, leading to premature termination of translation.\nCoT agent YQZi, evaluating linker sequence, thinking: I reviewed the construct: the HA tag coding sequence is fused directly to the GADD45G coding region without any glycine-rich or flexible linker. Without a spacer, the tag can sterically interfere with GADD45G folding, expose cryptic protease sites at the junction, and reduce protein stability or activity.; answer: The construct lacks a dedicated linker between the HA tag and GADD45G. This absence may cause steric hindrance at the N-terminus, leading to misfolding, increased proteolysis, and compromised stability and functionality of the GADD45G protein.\nCoT agent 14cq, investigating termination codons, thinking: I scanned the translated sequence and found an in-frame TGA codon immediately after the HA epitope, which would terminate translation prematurely.; answer: An unintended in-frame TGA stop codon is present right after the HA tag, causing premature termination of translation.\nCoT agent u5nU, assessing codon usage, thinking: The UAA codon is one of the three standard stop codons and is not recognized by any tRNA; instead, release factors bind, terminating translation. Mice, like all eukaryotes, do not have a tRNA that pairs with UAA.; answer: Sub-task 4: The UAA codon is a stop codon for which no tRNA exists in the mouse; release factors recognize UAA and terminate translation.\nDebate agent tPzY, round 0, compiling findings, thinking: Compiling findings: Sub-task 2 noted lack of linker could affect stability but wouldn’t block initial expression. Sub-task 3 identified an unintended in-frame TGA stop codon immediately after the HA tag, causing premature termination. Sub-task 4 confirmed UAA is a stop codon recognized by release factors, but the critical premature stop is the TGA. Thus the primary cause is early translation termination.; answer: B)\nDebate agent OR80, round 0, compiling findings, thinking: From subtask 2, the fusion lacks a flexible linker, making any truncated protein susceptible to proteolysis. From subtask 3, an unintended in‐frame TGA stop codon directly after the HA tag will terminate translation prematurely. From subtask 4, UAA (and TGA) are stop codons with no corresponding tRNA, so release factors end translation. Combining these, the premature stop codon is the root cause, yielding a truncated, unstable protein that is rapidly degraded, preventing detectable overexpression.; answer: The construct contains an unintended in‐frame TGA stop codon immediately after the HA tag, causing premature translation termination (and subsequent proteolysis), which explains the failure to overexpress full‐length GADD45G.\nDebate agent vC13, round 0, compiling findings, thinking: Sub-task 2 identified only potential instability due to lack of a linker, but that wouldn’t fully prevent expression. Sub-task 3 revealed an unintended in-frame TGA stop codon immediately after the HA tag, causing premature termination. Sub-task 4 confirmed UAA is a stop codon recognized by release factors, reinforcing that translation stops early. The primary cause is premature translation termination.; answer: B)\nDebate agent HHfn, round 0, compiling findings, thinking: Subtask 2 ruled out proteolysis due to linker absence as the primary block (it would reduce yield but not abolish expression). Subtask 3 identified an in‐frame TGA stop codon immediately after the HA epitope, causing early termination. Subtask 4 confirms UAA is a stop codon, but the key premature stop is TGA. Thus, the ribosome terminates translation early.; answer: B)\nFinal Decision agent, calculating cause, thinking: Sub-tasks identified an unintended in-frame TGA stop codon immediately after the HA epitope, causing premature termination of translation and preventing full-length GADD45G expression.; answer: B)\nCoT agent BOXN, formulating plan, thinking: We identified an unintended in-frame TGA stop codon immediately after the HA epitope causing premature translation termination. We need to remove or alter this stop codon and ensure proper reading frame and tag spacing to restore full-length expression.; answer: 1) Use site-directed mutagenesis to change the in-frame TGA stop codon following the HA tag to a sense codon (e.g. TGG for tryptophan) or restore the native GADD45G sequence. 2) Insert a short flexible linker (e.g. GGGGS)n between the HA epitope and GADD45G to improve folding and reduce steric hindrance. 3) Resequence the entire insert to confirm removal of premature stop codons and correct in-frame junctions. 4) Transfect the corrected construct into CHO cells and assess full-length GADD45G expression by Western blot using anti-HA and anti-GADD45G antibodies. 5) If expression is still suboptimal, consider alternative epitope tags or expression systems (viral vectors or different cell lines) to enhance protein stability and yield.', iteration_idx=-1)]
