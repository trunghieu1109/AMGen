        "1) Use site-directed mutagenesis to change the in-frame TGA stop codon following the HA tag to a sense codon (e.g. TGG for tryptophan) or restore the native GADD45G sequence. 2) Insert a short flexible linker (e.g. GGGGS)n between the HA epitope and GADD45G to improve folding and reduce steric hindrance. 3) Resequence the entire insert to confirm removal of premature stop codons and correct in-frame junctions. 4) Transfect the corrected construct into CHO cells and assess full-length GADD45G expression by Western blot using anti-HA and anti-GADD45G antibodies. 5) If expression is still suboptimal, consider alternative epitope tags or expression systems (viral vectors or different cell lines) to enhance protein stability and yield.": "95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval: (0.0%, 0.0%), Median: 0.0%"
