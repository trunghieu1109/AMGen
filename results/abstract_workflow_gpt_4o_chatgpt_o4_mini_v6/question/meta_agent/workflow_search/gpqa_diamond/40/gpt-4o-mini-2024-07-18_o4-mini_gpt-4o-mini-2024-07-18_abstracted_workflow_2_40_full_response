This is straightforward; no missing info.; answer: Key elements:\n1. Light beam propagating through a medium (glass).\n2. Index of refraction of glass, n.\n3. Constant velocity of the glass relative to laboratory frame, v (in same direction as light toward observer).\n4. Speed of light in vacuum, c, set to 1.\n5. Observer in the laboratory frame measuring the light speed in moving glass.\nCoT agent 1yYk, classifying relationships, thinking: We need to explain how the light’s speed in the medium (c/n) combines with the medium’s velocity v via relativistic velocity addition to give the lab‐frame speed.; answer: In the glass rest frame the light travels at u₀ = c/n. To get the speed in the lab frame where the glass moves at v in the same direction, we use Einstein’s velocity addition: u = (u₀ + v)/(1 + u₀·v/c²). With c = 1 this becomes u = (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n). The moving glass thus boosts the apparent light speed toward the observer but u never exceeds c.\nCoT agent pVwc, extracting principles, thinking: The user asks to extract relevant physical principles for light in moving media. This is a direct conceptual question, not multiple-choice, and sufficient context is given, so I can answer fully without marking as too hard.; answer: Sub-task 3: The key physical principles governing light propagation in moving media are:\n1. Maxwell’s equations and dispersion relations: Determine how the medium’s permittivity and permeability set the refractive index n, giving light speed c/n in the medium’s rest frame.\n2. Snell’s law and Fermat’s principle: Describe refraction at material boundaries and the path that extremizes optical time.\n3. Fresnel drag effect: The medium’s motion partially drags the light, modifying its phase velocity by a factor proportional to 1−1/n^2.\n4. Relativistic velocity‐addition formula: Combines the light speed in the medium’s rest frame (c/n) with the medium velocity v to yield the lab‐frame light speed u=(c/n+v)/(1+v/(nc)).\n5. Lorentz transformations of frequency and wavevector: Underpin both the Doppler effect (shifts in observed frequency) and the aberration of light when source, medium, and observer are in relative motion.\n6. Relativistic Doppler effect: Relates emitter and observer frequencies and wavelengths through their relative motion and the medium’s refractive properties.\n7. Invariance of phase: Ensures that phase continuity across boundaries and frames yields consistent dispersion and refraction rules.\nCoT agent bHcA, evaluating principles, thinking: Using the relativistic velocity‐addition formula to combine the light speed in the glass’s rest frame u′=c/n (with c=1) and the glass velocity v gives u=(u′+v)/(1+u′v)=(1/n+v)/(1+v/n). This simplifies to (1+n v)/(n+v).; answer: u = (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n) = (1 + n v)/(n + v)\nCoT agent 9CMF, generating equations, thinking: We use relativistic velocity‐addition to combine the light speed in the glass’s rest frame u′=1/n and the glass velocity v: u=(u′+v)/(1+u′v)=(1/n+v)/(1+v/n) which simplifies to (1+nv)/(n+v).
