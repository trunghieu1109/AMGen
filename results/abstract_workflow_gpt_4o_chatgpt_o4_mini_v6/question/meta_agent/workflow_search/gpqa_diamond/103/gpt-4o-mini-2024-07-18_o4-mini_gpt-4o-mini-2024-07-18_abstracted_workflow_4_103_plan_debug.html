    <pre>Related original question:

{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Astronomers are searching for exoplanets around two stars with exactly the same masses. Using the RV method, they detected one planet around each star, both with masses similar to that of Neptune. The stars themselves have masses similar to that of our Sun. Both planets were found to be in circular orbits.\n\nPlanet #1 was detected from the up to 5 miliangstrom periodic shift of a spectral line at a given wavelength. The periodic wavelength shift of the same spectral line in the spectrum of the host of planet #2 was 7 miliangstrom.\n\nThe question is: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;~ 0.36&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;~ 1.40&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;~ 1.96&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;~ 0.85&#39;}.

### Sub-task 4: Select the correct answer choice based on the calculated ratio from subtask 3 and determine which choice best represents how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1. 

 ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent 1guM:
For circular orbits with equal stellar and planetary masses, RV semi‐amplitude K ∝ Δλ and P ∝ K^(-3). Thus P₂/P₁ = (Δλ₁/Δλ₂)^3 = (5 mÅ/7 mÅ)³ ≈ 0.36, which matches choice A).

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent XPsc:
For circular orbits with equal masses, RV semi‐amplitude K∝P^(−1/3), so P∝K^(−3). The wavelength shifts Δλ are proportional to K, hence P2/P1=(Δλ1/Δλ2)^3=(5 mÅ/7 mÅ)^3≈0.36. This matches choice 1.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent a0tP:
For circular orbits and equal masses, RV amplitude K ∝ P^(−1/3) and Δλ ∝ K, so P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3 = (Δλ1/Δλ2)^3 = (5 mÅ/7 mÅ)^3 ≈ 0.36, corresponding to choice1.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent AzOL:
For circular orbits around equal-mass stars, RV amplitude K ∝ P^(-1/3), so P ∝ K^(-3). Measured Δλ ∝ K, thus P2/P1 = (Δλ1/Δλ2)^3 = (5 mÅ/7 mÅ)^3 ≈ 0.36, matching choice A).
