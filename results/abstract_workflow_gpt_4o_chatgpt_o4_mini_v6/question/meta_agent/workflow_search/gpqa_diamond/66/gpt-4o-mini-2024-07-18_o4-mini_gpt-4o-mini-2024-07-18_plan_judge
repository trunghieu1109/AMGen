Question: Example(question='Consider two electrons are in p orbital angular momentum state. Ignoring there spin angular momentum, the coupled angular momentum state of the 2-electron system is represented by $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1,1, 2, -1>. Here, $l_1, l_2$ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of particles 1 and 2 respectively. And, $l, m$ are the total angular momentum quantum number and the corresponding Z component of the 2-electron system respectively. If measurement is made of the orbital angular momentum components $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, what is the joint probability of getting the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$?\n', choice1='1', choice2='1/2', choice3='0', choice4='2/3', correct_index=2)

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_66
proposed answer: The coupled state |1,1;2,−1⟩ only includes uncoupled components |1,m₁;1,m₂⟩ with m₁+m₂=−1. The combination m₁=m₂=−1 gives m₁+m₂=−2, so its Clebsch–Gordan coefficient is zero and thus the joint probability is 0, which corresponds to choice C).
