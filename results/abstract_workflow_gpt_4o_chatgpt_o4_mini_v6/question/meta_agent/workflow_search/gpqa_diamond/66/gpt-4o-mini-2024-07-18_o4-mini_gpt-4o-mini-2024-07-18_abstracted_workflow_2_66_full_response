Thus the possible eigenvalues of L1z and L2z are m1ħ and m2ħ respectively, with m1,m2∈{-1,0,1}.; answer: Possible eigenvalues of L1z: -ħ, 0, +ħ; Possible eigenvalues of L2z: -ħ, 0, +ħ.\nCoT-SC agent v6rE, determining eigenvalues, thinking: Each electron has orbital quantum number l=1, so its magnetic quantum number m can be −1, 0, or +1, giving eigenvalues mħ for Lz.; answer: Eigenvalues of L1z: m1ħ with m1 ∈ {−1, 0, +1}, i.e. −ħ, 0, +ħ; Eigenvalues of L2z: m2ħ with m2 ∈ {−1, 0, +1}, i.e. −ħ, 0, +ħ\nCoT-SC agent rPx5, determining eigenvalues, thinking: Given l1 = 1 and l2 = 1, each orbital angular momentum has magnetic quantum numbers m1 and m2 that range from -l to +l in integer steps. Hence m1, m2 ∈ {-1, 0, +1}, and the corresponding eigenvalues of L_{1z} and L_{2z} are m1ħ and m2ħ respectively.; answer: Possible eigenvalues of L1z: -ħ, 0, +ħ; Possible eigenvalues of L2z: -ħ, 0, +ħ\nReflexion CoT agent lDWc, calculating joint probability, thinking: We need the joint probability that L1z and L2z both yield -ħ when the system is in the coupled state |1,1;2,-1>. In the uncoupled basis this state expands as Σ_{m1,m2} C(1,1,m1,m2|2,-1)|1,m1;1,m2>. Nonzero terms must satisfy m1 + m2 = -1. But m1 = -1 and m2 = -1 gives m1 + m2 = -2 ≠ -1, so the corresponding Clebsch–Gordan coefficient is zero. Hence the probability is zero.; answer: 0\nCritic agent 0jkn, providing feedback, thinking: The calculation correctly finds that the Clebsch–Gordan coefficient ⟨1,–1;1,–1|2,–1⟩ vanishes, so the joint probability of finding m₁ = m₂ = –1 is zero. However, this analysis has several limitations: it neglects the electrons’ spin and the requirement that the total two-electron wavefunction be antisymmetric; it assumes an ideal, noninvasive measurement of L₁z and L₂z; and it ignores possible perturbations or coupling to external fields. In a real two-electron system, spin–orbit coupling, exchange symmetry, and measurement backaction may redistribute amplitudes among the m₁,m₂ components and alter the observed probabilities.; answer: 0\nReflexion CoT agent lDWc, refining joint probability calculation, thinking: We expand the coupled state |1,1;2,-1> in the uncoupled basis |1,m1;1,m2> with m1+m2 = -1. The term m1 = -1, m2 = -1 gives m1+m2 = -2 ≠ -1, so its Clebsch–Gordan coefficient ⟨1,–1;1,–1|2,–1⟩ = 0.
