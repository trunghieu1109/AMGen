The only allowed pairs are (−1,0) and (0,−1), with equal Clebsch–Gordan coefficients of 1/√2. Measurement of L₁z and L₂z projects onto one of these product states with probabilities given by the squares of these coefficients.; answer: Both electrons are in l=1 (p) orbitals. The total state |l₁=1, l₂=1; l=2, m=−1⟩ expands as:\n|2,−1⟩ = (1/√2)|m₁=−1, m₂=0⟩ + (1/√2)|m₁=0, m₂=−1⟩.\nMeasuring L₁z and L₂z collapses the system onto one of these two uncoupled states. Each outcome (m₁=−1, m₂=0) or (m₁=0, m₂=−1) occurs with probability |1/√2|² = 1/2. The outcome (m₁=−1, m₂=−1) has zero probability.\nCoT agent Lepj, determining eigenvalues, thinking: For angular momentum quantum number l, the magnetic quantum number m runs from -l to +l in integer steps. Here l1 = 1 and l2 = 1, so m1 and m2 each can be -1, 0, or +1.; answer: Possible eigenvalues of L1z: m1ħ with m1 = -1, 0, +1, i.e. -ħ, 0, +ħ; Possible eigenvalues of L2z: m2ħ with m2 = -1, 0, +1, i.e. -ħ, 0, +ħ.\nCoT agent h7ld, establishing relationships, thinking: The total m = -1 requires m1 + m2 = -1. If both m1 and m2 were -1, their sum would be -2, which cannot contribute to the |2, −1⟩ state. Hence the Clebsch–Gordan coefficient is zero and the measurement probability is zero.; answer: C)\nCoT agent F483, calculating joint probability, thinking: Since the total m = -1 and m1+m2 must equal -1, the combination m1 = -1 and m2 = -1 (sum = -2) cannot contribute to the |1,1,2,−1> state. The corresponding Clebsch–Gordan coefficient is zero, so the joint probability is zero.; answer: C)\nCoT agent 0WIc, evaluating joint probability, thinking: The computed joint probability is 0, which corresponds to choice3 ('0') in the provided options, i.e., option C).; answer: C)", iteration_idx=-1)]
