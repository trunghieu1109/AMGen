    <pre>Related original question:

{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Consider two electrons are in p orbital angular momentum state. Ignoring there spin angular momentum, the coupled angular momentum state of the 2-electron system is represented by $|l_1, l_2, l, m&gt; = |1,1, 2, -1&gt;. Here, $l_1, l_2$ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of particles 1 and 2 respectively. And, $l, m$ are the total angular momentum quantum number and the corresponding Z component of the 2-electron system respectively. If measurement is made of the orbital angular momentum components $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, what is the joint probability of getting the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$?\n&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;1&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;1/2&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;0&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;2/3&#39;}. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 5: Calculate the joint probability of obtaining the eigenvalues -ħ for both L1z and L2z using the derived relationships from the previous subtasks. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent F483:
Since the total m = -1 and m1+m2 must equal -1, the combination m1 = -1 and m2 = -1 (sum = -2) cannot contribute to the |1,1,2,−1&gt; state. The corresponding Clebsch–Gordan coefficient is zero, so the joint probability is zero.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent F483:
C)

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Evaluate the computed joint probability against the provided choices to determine which choice corresponds to the calculated probability.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
