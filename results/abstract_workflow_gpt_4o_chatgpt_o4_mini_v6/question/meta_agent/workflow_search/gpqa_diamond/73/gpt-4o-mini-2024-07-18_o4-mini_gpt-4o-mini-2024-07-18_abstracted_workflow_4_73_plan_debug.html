    <pre>Related original question:

{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.\nSo far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? &#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;52%&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;48%&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;44%&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;40%&#39;}. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 5: Make final decision on the probability of decay occurring in the next 150 minutes. 

 ### thinking by Final Decision Agent WfUQ:
We apply the memoryless property of exponential decay. Given P(decay≤100)=0.32, so λ=−ln(0.68)/100. The probability of decay in the next 150 min is 1−exp(−λ·150)=1−0.68^{1.5}≈0.44 or 44%, corresponding to choice C).

### answer by Final Decision Agent WfUQ:
C)

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Select the closest answer choice from the provided options (52%, 48%, 44%, 40%) based on the calculated probability.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
