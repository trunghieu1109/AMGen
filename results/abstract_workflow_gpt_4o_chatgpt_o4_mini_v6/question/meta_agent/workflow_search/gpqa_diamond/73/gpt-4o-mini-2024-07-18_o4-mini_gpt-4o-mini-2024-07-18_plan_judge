Question: Example(question='We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.\nSo far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? ', choice1='52%', choice2='48%', choice3='44%', choice4='40%', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_4_73
proposed answer: We use the memoryless property of exponential decay. Given P(decay≤100)=0.32 -> λ=−ln(0.68)/100. Then P(decay in next 150)=1−exp(−λ·150)=1−0.68^{1.5}≈0.44.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_11_73
proposed answer: Using the exponential decay model P(decay≤100)=0.32 implies λ=−ln(0.68)/100. Memoryless property gives P(decay in next 150 min)=1−e^{−λ·150}=1−0.68^{1.5}≈0.439≈44%.
