{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.\nSo far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? &#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;52%&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;48%&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;44%&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;40%&#39;}. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 5: Derive the final probability of decay in the next 150 minutes based on the calculations from subtask 4 and compare it with the provided choices. 

 ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent 3uOa:
We use the exponential decay model: P(decay≤100 min)=0.32 ⇒ survival S(100)=0.68 ⇒ λ=−ln(0.68)/100. The process is memoryless, so P(decay in next 150 min|survival to 50 min)=1−e^{−λ·150}=1−0.68^{1.5}≈0.439≈44%. This matches choice C).

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent sbB1:
From sub-task 4 we found the decay constant λ by solving 1−e^(−λ·100)=0.32 ⇒ e^(−λ·100)=0.68 ⇒ λ≈0.0038566 min⁻¹. Memorylessness gives P(decay in next 150 min)=1−e^(−λ·150)=1−0.68^1.5≈0.439≈44%. Among the choices, 44% corresponds to option C).

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent 3P0D:
From subtask 4: P(decay≤100)=0.32 ⇒ survival e^(−λ·100)=0.68 ⇒ λ=−ln(0.68)/100. By memorylessness, conditional P(decay in next 150 min)=1−e^(−λ·150)=1−0.68^(150/100)=1−0.68^1.5≈0.439≈44%. This matches choice C).

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent fCSn:
From subtask 4 we found λ=−ln(0.68)/100 and by memorylessness P(decay in next 150 min | survival to 50 min)=1–e^{−λ·150}≈0.439≈44%. This matches choice3.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 5: Make final decision on the derived probability.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
