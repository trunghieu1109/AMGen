No extra data is needed to identify these relationships.; answer: Key parameters:\n1) Proper lifetime τ₀ = 8×10⁻¹⁶ s\n2) Lab energy E = 27 GeV\n3) Rest mass m = 3.41 GeV/c²\nRelationships:\n• Lorentz factor γ = E/(m c²)\n• Dilated lifetime in lab frame τ = γ τ₀\n• Mean decay length L = β c τ ≃ γ c τ₀\nCoT-SC agent HVjD, classifying decay process, thinking: We identify that the proper lifetime (8×10⁻¹⁶ s) is typical of electromagnetic decays (e.g. π⁰→γγ has τ≈8×10⁻¹⁷ s). At 27 GeV the Lorentz factor γ=E/m≈27/3.41≈7.9 dilates the lifetime, giving a mean decay length L=γcτ₀≈2.1×10⁻⁶ m. To observe 30% of decays one needs a detector resolution on the order of d=−L\u2009ln(0.7)≈0.7×10⁻⁶ m, i.e. sub‐micron precision. This classification and resolution requirement underscores the need for high-precision tracking to study short‐lived resonances and their interactions.; answer: Classification: An electromagnetic decay of a neutral particle with a very short proper lifetime (8×10⁻¹⁶ s). Time dilation at 27 GeV (γ≈7.9) gives a mean lab decay length of ≈2.1 μm, so observing ~30% of decays requires sub-micron (≈0.7 μm) spatial resolution. This high resolution is essential for identifying short-lived resonances and probing fundamental interaction dynamics.\nCoT-SC agent 12GX, classifying decay process, thinking: The sub-task asks to classify the decay based on its lifetime scale and discuss how the Lorentz‐dilated lifetime at 27\u2009GeV leads to a micron‐scale decay length, which in turn sets the detector resolution requirements. These points can be addressed with the parameters already identified: τ₀, E, m, γ, and L.; answer: Classification: With a proper lifetime of 8×10⁻¹⁶\u2009s (≫10⁻²³\u2009s but ≲10⁻¹⁰\u2009s), X⁰’s decay X⁰→Y⁺Z⁻ occurs on an electromagnetic‐interaction timescale rather than via the strong or weak force. Significance: In the laboratory frame at E=27\u2009GeV, time dilation (γ≈E/mc²≈27/3.41≈7.9) extends the lifetime to τ≈γτ₀≈6.3×10⁻¹⁵\u2009s, yielding a mean decay length L≈cτ≈2×10⁻⁶\u2009m. To detect at least 30% of decays within the detector, spatial resolution must be on the order of 10⁻⁶\u2009m. Achieving micron‐scale resolution is therefore essential for observing such short‐lived particles and for precise vertex reconstruction in modern tracking detectors.\nCoT-SC agent HQYe, classifying decay process, thinking: The lifetime of 8×10⁻¹⁶ s is much longer than typical strong‐interaction lifetimes (~10⁻²³ s) but much shorter than weak decays (~10⁻¹⁰ s), placing it squarely in the electromagnetic category. The high lab energy (27 GeV) compared to the rest mass (3.41 GeV) gives a Lorentz factor γ≈E/m≈7.9, so the mean decay length is boosted by γ\u2009c\u2009τ₀ to a scale of order 10⁻⁴–10⁻³ m. Observing a significant fraction of these decays therefore requires a detector spatial resolution on the order of 10⁻⁴–10⁻³ m.; answer: Classification: Electromagnetic decay (τ₀≈8×10⁻¹⁶ s).\nSignificance: With high γ≈7.9 the lab‐frame decay length is L≈γ\u2009c\u2009τ₀∼10⁻⁴–10⁻³ m, so detectors need sub‐millimeter resolution to observe ~30% of decays. This enables study of short‐lived particles and tests of electromagnetic interaction dynamics.\nCoT agent QBap, calculating distance traveled, thinking: Compute β from E and m: β = sqrt(1 – (m/E)^2) = sqrt(1 – (3.41/27)^2) ≈ 0.992. Then v ≈ 0.992c ≈ 2.976×10^8 m/s.
