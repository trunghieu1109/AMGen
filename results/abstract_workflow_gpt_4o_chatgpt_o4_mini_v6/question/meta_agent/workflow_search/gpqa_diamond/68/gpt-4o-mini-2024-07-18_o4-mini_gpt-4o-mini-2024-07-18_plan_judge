Question: Example(question='In the CERN Bubble Chamber a decay occurs, $X^{0}\\rightarrow Y^{+}Z^{-}$ in \\tau_{0}=8\\times10^{-16}s, i.e. the proper lifetime of X^{0}. What minimum resolution is needed to observe at least 30% of the decays? Knowing that the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27GeV, and the mass of X^{0} is 3.41GeV.', choice1='2.08*1e-1 m', choice2='2.08*1e-9 m', choice3='2.08*1e-6 m', choice4='2.08*1e-3 m', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_68
proposed answer: The decay length needed is ≈8.6×10⁻⁸ m. Among the options, only 2.08×10⁻⁹ m (choice2) is sufficiently small to resolve ≥30% of decays.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_27_68
proposed answer: The required minimum resolution is approximately 8.6×10⁻⁸ m, so the only provided choice with finer resolution is 2.08×10⁻⁹ m, which corresponds to choice B).
