In the lab frame the particle’s mean lifetime is dilated by γ, giving a decay length βγcτ₀, and the probability to decay within a length L is P=1–exp(–L/(βγcτ₀)). Solving for L at P=0.3 yields the minimum resolution.; answer: Relevant principles and equations:\n1. Time dilation (special relativity): τ_lab = γ\u2009τ₀, where γ = E/m.\n2. Decay kinematics: decay length L_0 = β\u2009c\u2009τ_lab = β\u2009γ\u2009c\u2009τ₀.\n3. Exponential decay law in lab frame: P(decay within L) = 1 – exp(–L/(β\u2009γ\u2009c\u2009τ₀)).\n4. For at least 30% of decays, set P ≥ 0.30 and solve L = –β\u2009γ\u2009c\u2009τ₀\u2009ln(1–0.30).\nCoT-SC agent p6KN, calculating distance, thinking: The sub-task asks for the distance traveled during the proper lifetime, using d = c⋅τ₀. With τ₀ = 8×10⁻¹⁶ s and c ≈ 3×10⁸ m/s, we get d ≈ 3×10⁸ m/s × 8×10⁻¹⁶ s = 2.4×10⁻⁷ m.; answer: 2.4×10⁻⁷ m\nCoT-SC agent rNIK, calculating distance, thinking: We compute the distance in the particle’s rest frame (proper lifetime) by multiplying c by τ₀: L₀ = c·τ₀ = (3×10^8 m/s)·(8×10^(–16) s) = 2.4×10^(–7) m.; answer: 2.4×10^(-7) m\nCoT-SC agent HpOf, calculating distance, thinking: We use d = c·τ₀. With c ≃ 3×10^8 m/s and τ₀ = 8×10^−16 s, d = 3×10^8 m/s × 8×10^−16 s = 2.4×10^−7 m.; answer: Distance traveled during the proper lifetime = 2.4×10^−7 m.\nCoT agent 9RzH, determining minimum resolution, thinking: We use the exponential decay law: P(decay within d)=1–e^(–d/λ). We want 1–e^(–d/d₀)=0.3, where d₀ from subtask 2 is 2.4×10⁻⁷ m. Solve e^(–d/d₀)=0.7 ⇒ d=–d₀\u2009ln(0.7)=2.4×10⁻⁷×0.357≈8.6×10⁻⁸ m.; answer: Minimum resolution ≃8.6×10⁻⁸ m\nDebate agent Q2Et, round 0, evaluating choices, thinking: The calculated minimum resolution is ~8.6×10⁻⁸ m.
