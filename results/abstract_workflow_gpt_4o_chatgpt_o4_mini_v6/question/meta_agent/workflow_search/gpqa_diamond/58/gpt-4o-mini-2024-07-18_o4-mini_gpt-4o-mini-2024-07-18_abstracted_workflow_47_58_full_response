However, this simple approach assumes volumes are strictly additive, complete and independent dissociation of all species, and neglects that each mole of Ba(OH)₂ provides two moles of OH⁻. It also ignores activity coefficients, ionic strength effects, and any volume changes upon mixing.; answer: Moles of CH₃COOH = 0.05 mol; HCl = 0.08 mol; Ba(OH)₂ = 0.09 mol (equivalent to 0.18 mol OH⁻)\nReflexion CoT agent 6GP5, refining total moles calculation, thinking: We use n = M × V (L). For CH3COOH: 0.1 M × 0.500 L = 0.05 mol. For HCl: 0.2 M × 0.400 L = 0.08 mol. For Ba(OH)₂: 0.3 M × 0.300 L = 0.09 mol.; answer: Moles of CH3COOH = 0.05 mol; Moles of HCl = 0.08 mol; Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = 0.09 mol\nDebate agent fUHO, round 0, identifying acids and bases, thinking: HCl fully dissociates in water, making it a strong acid.
