Moles HA remaining=0.00100–0.00025=0.00075\u2009mol, moles A– formed=0.00025\u2009mol. [HA]=0.00075/0.04250=0.01765\u2009M, [A–]=0.00025/0.04250=0.00588\u2009M. pKa=–log\u2009(1.85×10⁻⁵)=4.732. By Henderson–Hasselbalch, pH=4.732+log(0.00588/0.01765)=4.732–0.4771≈4.26.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent AVqA:\nInitial moles HA = 0.00100 mol; 25% titration adds 0.00025 mol NaOH ➔ moles HA=0.00075, A–=0.00025; total volume ≈42.5 mL → [HA]=0.01765 M, [A–]=0.00588 M; pKa=–log(1.85×10⁻⁵)=4.732; pH=4.732+log(0.00588/0.01765)=4.732+log(0.3333)=4.732–0.477=4.255≈4.26\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent YtXB:\nInitial moles CH3COOH = 0.0500 M × 0.02000 L = 0.00100 mol, diluted to 0.040 L → [HA]0 = 0.0250 M. At 25% titration, nOH- = 0.00025 mol → nHA = 0.00075, nA- = 0.00025 in total volume 0.0425 L → [HA] = 0.01765 M, [A-] = 0.00588 M. pKa = -log(1.85×10-5) = 4.732; pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]) = 4.732 + log(0.00588/0.01765) ≈ 4.26.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent AscY:\n4.26\n\n### answer by Debate Agent gtYT:\npH ≈4.26\n\n### answer by Debate Agent AVqA:\npH at 25% titration = 4.26\n\n### answer by Debate Agent YtXB:\npH at 25% titration = 4.26\n\n### Sub-task 5: Determine the pH at the equivalence point of the titration, considering the dissociation of the acetate ion formed. \n\n ### thinking by Debate Agent mCAG:\nAt equivalence, moles CH₃COO⁻ = 0.00100 mol in V_total = 40.00 mL + 10.00 mL = 50.00 mL gives [CH₃COO⁻] = 0.00100/0.05000 = 0.0200 M. Kb = Kw/Ka = 1.0×10⁻¹⁴/1.85×10⁻⁵ = 5.405×10⁻¹⁰. [OH⁻] ≈ √(Kb·C) = √(5.405×10⁻¹⁰·0.0200) ≈ 1.04×10⁻⁵ M, so pOH ≈ 4.98 and pH ≈ 9.02.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent VZDM:\nAt the equivalence point all acetic acid has been converted to acetate.

Kb for acetate = Kw/Ka = 1e–14/1.85e–5 = 5.405×10–10. For A– + H2O ⇌ OH– + HA, [OH–] = √(Kb·C) = √(5.405×10–10·0.0200) = 1.04×10–5 M, so pOH = 4.98 and pH = 14–4.98 ≈ 9.02.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent dZmJ:\nAt equivalence, all 0.00100 mol CH₃COOH is converted to CH₃COO⁻.
