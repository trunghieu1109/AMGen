Question: Example(question='We dilute 20.00 cm3 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm3 water, then titrate the resulting solution with 0.1M NaOH (25 °C). What will be the value of pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point? The Ka of acetic acid is 1.85x10^-5.', choice1='4.57; 6.92  ', choice2='4.26; 8.52', choice3='4.73; 7.00', choice4='3.17; 6.73  ', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_6_82
proposed answer: We use the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation at 25% titration to get pH ≃4.26. At the equivalence point, treating the acetate as a weak base gives pH ≃8.52. These match choice 2.

Answer:pH at 25% titration = 4.26; pH at equivalence point = 8.52
Extracted answer: pH at 25% titration = 4.26; pH at equivalence point = 8.52
Correct answer: 1
