Question: Example(question='Your colleague has devised a new quantum field theory on four-dimensional spacetime, and is exploring the regularization of certain higher-order loop diagrams in that theory. On their desk you spy a scribbled note: a Feynman diagram, and next to it, the words "size estimate" followed by a string of physical constants, numbers, and ratios between what appear to be energy scales. The symbols read: alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2.\n\nThe diagram, unfortunately, has been rendered unreadable by a spilled coffee. How many loops did it contain?', choice1='3', choice2='1', choice3='2', choice4='6', correct_index=0)

proposed answer: In four dimensions each loop integral typically yields a factor of 1/(4π)^2. The presence of (1/(4π))^6 therefore corresponds to three such loop integrals (2×3=6), so the diagram has three loops; the coupling powers and scale ratio don’t alter that count.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_6_49
proposed answer: In perturbative QFT each loop yields a factor of (1/(4π)^2), so (1/(4π)^6) = (1/(4π)^2)^3 implies 3 loops, consistent with the α^3 factor.
