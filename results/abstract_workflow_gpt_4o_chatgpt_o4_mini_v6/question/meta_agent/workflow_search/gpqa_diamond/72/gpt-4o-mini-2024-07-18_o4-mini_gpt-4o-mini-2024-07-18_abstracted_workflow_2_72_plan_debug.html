{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Two astronauts of masses 2m and 3m travel at relativistic speeds of 0.6 c and 0.5 c, respectively, in the positive x-direction. Here, c is the speed of light. What will be the relative speed and the total energy of the system?&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2&#39;}. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 7: Compare the calculated relative speed and total energy with the provided choices to determine the correct answer. 

 ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent yEYH:
We computed the relative speed ≈0.143c (&lt;c) and total energy ≈5.964 mc^2, which matches choice1&#39;s values of 0.14c and 5.96 mc^2.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent R6hT:
The computed relative speed ~0.143c matches 0.14c and the total energy ~5.96 mc^2 matches the first choice, so choice A) is correct.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent XMTt:
We have calculated the relative speed v_rel ≈0.143c (&lt;c) and the total energy E ≈5.964 mc². Among the given options, only choice1 (v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc²) matches these results.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent gjZE:
The computed relative speed is ~0.143c (≈0.14c) and total energy is ~5.964 mc² (≈5.96 mc²), which matches choice1.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 7: Make final decision on the correct answer.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
