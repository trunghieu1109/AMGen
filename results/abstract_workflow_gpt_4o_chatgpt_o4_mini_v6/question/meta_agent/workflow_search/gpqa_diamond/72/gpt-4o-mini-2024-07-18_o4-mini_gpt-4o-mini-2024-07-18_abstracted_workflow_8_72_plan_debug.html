{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Two astronauts of masses 2m and 3m travel at relativistic speeds of 0.6 c and 0.5 c, respectively, in the positive x-direction. Here, c is the speed of light. What will be the relative speed and the total energy of the system?&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2&#39;}. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 4: Evaluate the provided choices against the calculated values from subtask 3 to determine which choice is correct. This involves comparing the calculated relative speed and total energy with the options given. 

 ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent dVMJ:
Computed relative speed v_rel ≈0.14c and total energy E_total ≈5.96 mc² match choice1.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent EjL6:
We computed the relative speed v_rel≈0.14c using the relativistic velocity addition formula and the total energy E_total≈5.96 m c² by summing each astronaut’s γmc². Among the provided options, only choice1 matches both the relative speed and total energy, corresponding to A).

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent F0Qk:
We compare the computed values v_rel≈0.14c and E_total≈5.96mc² with the four choices. Only choice1 matches both the relative speed and total energy.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent Yk6j:
Calculated v_rel = 0.14c and E_total ≈ 5.96 m c^2, which matches choice1.

### answer #1 by Debate Agent dVMJ:
A)

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 5: Make final decision on the correct choice based on evaluations.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
