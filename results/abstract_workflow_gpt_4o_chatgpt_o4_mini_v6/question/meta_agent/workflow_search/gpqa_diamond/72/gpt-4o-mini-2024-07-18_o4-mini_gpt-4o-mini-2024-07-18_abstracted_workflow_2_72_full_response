To find their relative speed and total energy we use special relativity: the relativistic velocity addition formula for relative speed and the energy formula E=γmc² for total energy.; answer: Mass of astronaut A: 2m; speed: 0.6c. Mass of astronaut B: 3m; speed: 0.5c. Relevant principles: special relativity (relativistic velocity addition for relative speed, relativistic energy E=γmc² for total energy).\nCoT-SC agent qcws, classifying calculations, thinking: The question asks to classify the calculation types needed for sub-task 2. One is computing the relative speed between two velocities in special relativity, which uses the relativistic velocity addition formula. The other is finding the total energy of moving masses, which uses the relativistic energy formula E=γmc².; answer: Calculation 1: Relative speed calculation using the relativistic velocity addition formula. Calculation 2: Total energy calculation using the relativistic energy formula E = γmc².\nCoT-SC agent 3Jot, classifying calculations, thinking: The problem requires applying the relativistic velocity addition formula to compute the relative speed, and the relativistic energy formula E=γmc^2 to compute each astronaut’s total energy and summing them.; answer: 1) Relative speed calculation using the relativistic velocity addition formula. 2) Total energy calculation using the relativistic energy formula E=γmc^2 for each astronaut, then summing.\nCoT-SC agent G9qx, classifying calculations, thinking: The question asks to classify the two calculation types: one for finding relative speed and one for finding total energy, based on special relativity formulas.; answer: Relative speed calculation: use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Total energy calculation: use the relativistic energy formula E = γ m c².\nCoT agent Fssv, calculating relative speed, thinking: To find the relative speed between the two astronauts moving in the same direction, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula for difference: v_rel = (v1 – v2) / (1 – v1*v2/c^2). Substituting v1=0.6c, v2=0.5c gives v_rel = 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.143c.; answer: v_rel = (0.6c – 0.5c) / (1 – 0.6×0.5) = 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.143c\nCoT agent GdD1, calculating total energy, thinking: Calculate each astronaut’s energy using E=γmc² and sum:\nγ₁=1/√(1–0.6²)=1.25 ⇒ E₁=2m·1.25c²=2.5 mc²\nγ₂=1/√(1–0.5²)≈1.1547 ⇒ E₂=3m·1.1547c²≈3.464 mc²\nTotal E=E₁+E₂≈5.964 mc²≈5.96 mc²; answer: E_total ≈5.96 m\u2009c²\nCoT agent YgWC, evaluating relative speed, thinking: We computed v_rel ≈ 0.143c using the relativistic velocity subtraction formula. Since 0.143c is clearly less than the speed of light c, the result respects relativity’s speed limit.; answer: The relative speed is approximately 0.143c, which is less than c and thus physically valid.\nCoT agent jPrh, evaluating total energy, thinking: The total energy sum E₁+E₂ ≈2.5 mc²+3.464 mc²≈5.964 mc² matches 5.96 mc².
