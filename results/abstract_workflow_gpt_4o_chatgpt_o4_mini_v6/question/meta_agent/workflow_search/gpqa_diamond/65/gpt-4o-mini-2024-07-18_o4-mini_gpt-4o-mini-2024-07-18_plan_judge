proposed answer: The SMEFT is built as a local, unitary, Lorentz‐invariant effective field theory. This enforces invariance under the full Poincaré group (translations + Lorentz) and, by the CPT theorem, CPT invariance. CP symmetry need not be assumed generally. Thus the required symmetries are 1, 2, and 4.

proposed answer: We assess each choice against the requirement that SMEFT operators obey full Poincaré invariance (translations + Lorentz) and CPT (ensured by locality, unitarity, Lorentz). CP is optional. Choices omitting Poincaré or CPT fail; inclusion of CP is overly restrictive but not required.

Answer:Choice 1 (1,3,4): invalid – lacks full Poincaré (translations).
Choice 2 (3,4): invalid – lacks Lorentz/Poincaré.
Choice 3 (1,2): invalid – omits CPT invariance.
Choice 4 (1,2,4): valid – enforces Poincaré, Lorentz, and CPT, as required by SMEFT.
Extracted answer: Choice 1 (1,3,4): invalid – lacks full Poincaré (translations).
Correct answer: 3
