### Sub-task 4: Make final decision on the combinations of symmetries. 

 ### thinking by Final Decision Agent iRcm:
In SMEFT, all operators must respect Poincaré invariance (which subsumes Lorentz symmetry) and CPT invariance by the CPT theorem. CP symmetry is not required and may be violated by higher-dimensional operators. Thus the minimal fundamental set is {Lorentz, Poincaré, CPT}. Imposing CP yields an extended set but is not mandatory.

### answer by Final Decision Agent iRcm:
The minimal mandatory symmetry set is {Lorentz, Poincaré, CPT}. CP symmetry may be imposed optionally but is not required.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 5: Compute the validity of each evaluated combination based on theoretical principles and existing literature on SMEFT.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>We assess each choice against the requirement that SMEFT operators obey full Poincaré invariance (translations + Lorentz) and CPT (ensured by locality, unitarity, Lorentz). CP is optional. Choices omitting Poincaré or CPT fail; inclusion of CP is overly restrictive but not required.

Answer:Choice 1 (1,3,4): invalid – lacks full Poincaré (translations).
Choice 2 (3,4): invalid – lacks Lorentz/Poincaré.
Choice 3 (1,2): invalid – omits CPT invariance.
Choice 4 (1,2,4): valid – enforces Poincaré, Lorentz, and CPT, as required by SMEFT.</pre>
