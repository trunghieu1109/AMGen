CP symmetry is not required and may be violated by higher-dimensional operators. Thus the minimal fundamental set is {Lorentz, Poincaré, CPT}. Imposing CP yields an extended set but is not mandatory.\n\n### answer by Final Decision Agent iRcm:\nThe minimal mandatory symmetry set is {Lorentz, Poincaré, CPT}.

To answer sub-task 1, we identify each symmetry’s nature and whether SMEFT construction enforces it.; answer: Key symmetries mentioned and their relevance to SMEFT:\n1. Lorentz Symmetry: Continuous spacetime rotations and boosts. All SMEFT operators must be Lorentz-invariant because the underlying theory respects special relativity.\n2. Poincare Symmetry: Extends Lorentz by including translations. SMEFT inherits full Poincare invariance (translations + Lorentz) to maintain energy–momentum conservation and spacetime uniformity.\n3. CP Symmetry: Discrete charge conjugation and parity. The Standard Model violates CP in the weak sector, and SMEFT allows CP-violating operators, so CP is not a mandatory symmetry.\n4. CPT Symmetry: Fundamental theorem of local, unitary, Lorentz-invariant QFTs. All SMEFT operators must respect CPT invariance.\nCoT-SC agent TQ0l, classifying symmetries, thinking: We need to classify each symmetry by definition and SMEFT implications: whether it’s continuous vs. discrete, whether SMEFT enforces it (mandatory) or allows violation. Lorentz and Poincare are continuous spacetime invariances required by special relativity and quantum field theory; CPT is a discrete theorem-guaranteed symmetry in any local, unitary Lorentz-invariant QFT; CP is a discrete symmetry that is known to be violated in the SM and thus not obligatory in SMEFT.; answer: Lorentz Symmetry: Continuous spacetime rotations and boosts; mandatory invariance in SMEFT.\nPoincare Symmetry: Continuous spacetime translations plus Lorentz; mandatory invariance in SMEFT.\nCP Symmetry: Discrete charge conjugation and parity; not required and can be violated in SMEFT.\nCPT Symmetry: Discrete charge–parity–time reversal; theorem-guaranteed and mandatory in SMEFT.\nCoT-SC agent 4jjA, classifying symmetries, thinking: To classify symmetries in SMEFT, note that Lorentz and Poincare are continuous spacetime symmetries that must be exactly preserved to maintain relativity and energy–momentum conservation; CP is a discrete internal symmetry that the SM already violates and thus SMEFT operators may break; CPT is a fundamental discrete symmetry guaranteed in any local, unitary, Lorentz-invariant QFT and so is enforced.; answer: Lorentz: continuous spacetime rotations/boosts – exact symmetry in SMEFT\nPoincare: Lorentz + translations – exact symmetry in SMEFT\nCP: discrete charge conjugation\u2009+\u2009parity – not required (SMEFT allows CP violation)\nCPT: discrete charge conjugation\u2009+\u2009parity\u2009+\u2009time reversal – must be respected in SMEFT\nCoT-SC agent uVPd, classifying symmetries, thinking: We need to classify each symmetry by type (continuous spacetime vs. discrete internal), whether it is required or optional in SMEFT, and its underlying reason. This is straightforward given standard QFT and SMEFT construction.; answer: Classification of symmetries in SMEFT:\n\n1. Lorentz Symmetry\n   - Type: Continuous spacetime symmetry (rotations and boosts)\n   - Implication: All operators must form Lorentz-invariant combinations of fields and derivatives to respect special relativity.\n   - Status: Mandatory.\n\n2. Poincare Symmetry\n   - Type: Continuous spacetime symmetry (Lorentz transformations + translations)\n   - Implication: Ensures energy–momentum conservation and uniformity of spacetime; operators must be invariant under both boosts/rotations and translations.\n   - Status: Mandatory.\n\n3. CP Symmetry\n   - Type: Discrete internal symmetry (charge conjugation × parity)\n   - Implication: SMEFT allows CP-violating operators (e.g., higher-dimensional sources of new CP violation); CP is not imposed as a universal symmetry.\n   - Status: Optional (can be broken).\n\n4. CPT Symmetry\n   - Type: Discrete fundamental symmetry (combined charge, parity, and time reversal)\n   - Implication: Guaranteed by locality, unitarity, and Lorentz invariance (CPT theorem); all operators must respect CPT.\n   - Status: Mandatory.\nCoT agent PmQe, generating combinations, thinking: Based on SMEFT construction, Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT are mandatory; CP is optional. Therefore any SMEFT operator must respect the three mandatory symmetries, with CP either respected or violated, yielding two possible symmetry sets.; answer: Possible symmetry combinations for SMEFT operators:\n1) {Lorentz, Poincare, CPT}\n2) {Lorentz, Poincare, CP, CPT}\nDebate agent XBC2, round 0, evaluating combinations, thinking: In SMEFT all operators must respect Poincaré invariance (which includes Lorentz symmetry) and CPT by the general principles of local relativistic quantum field theory. CP invariance is not required and can be violated by higher-dimensional operators. Thus the minimal allowed set is {Lorentz, Poincaré, CPT}, while {Lorentz, Poincaré, CP, CPT} is also consistent if one imposes CP conservation.; answer: Both combinations are valid under SMEFT: 1) {Lorentz, Poincaré, CPT} is the minimal mandatory set, and 2) {Lorentz, Poincaré, CP, CPT} is the extended set when CP symmetry is additionally imposed.\nDebate agent KVIQ, round 0, evaluating combinations, thinking: In quantum field theory, the Poincaré group (which includes Lorentz) and CPT invariance are guaranteed by locality, unitarity, and Lorentz symmetry (CPT theorem). CP symmetry, however, is not a required fundamental symmetry in the SMEFT—SM interactions can violate CP. Thus the minimal mandatory set is {Poincaré, CPT} (implying Lorentz).; answer: Evaluation of generated combinations:\n1) {Lorentz, Poincaré, CPT}: This is the minimal, required symmetry set for all SMEFT operators (Poincaré invariance subsumes Lorentz symmetry and CPT follows from the CPT theorem).\n2) {Lorentz, Poincaré, CP, CPT}: This set is a valid possibility but goes beyond the fundamental requirements by imposing CP invariance, which is not mandatory in SMEFT (CP can be violated in higher-dimensional operators).\nDebate agent YZlR, round 0, evaluating combinations, thinking: In SMEFT all operators must respect Lorentz, Poincare (which includes translations and Lorentz), and CPT symmetries. CP is not required and can be violated by higher‐dimensional operators. Therefore the first set is the minimal fundamental requirement; adding CP yields a stronger restriction but isn’t mandatory. No missing information prevents evaluation.; answer: Sub‐task 4 Evaluation:\n1) {Lorentz, Poincare, CPT}: This set comprises the essential, mandatory symmetries in any quantum field theory and in SMEFT in particular. It is the minimal correct symmetry set.\n2) {Lorentz, Poincare, CP, CPT}: This set satisfies all mandatory requirements plus imposes CP conservation. While permissible, CP conservation is not fundamental in SMEFT and can be violated by higher‐dimensional operators.\nDebate agent SAsm, round 0, evaluating combinations, thinking: Evaluation rests on recognizing which symmetries are truly fundamental (always respected) in a local, unitary QFT such as the SMEFT and which are optional. Poincaré invariance (including Lorentz) and CPT are guaranteed by the basic QFT framework, whereas CP may or may not be conserved depending on the operator. Both of the generated sets therefore correctly capture either the minimal required symmetries or the minimal plus optional CP symmetry.; answer: Evaluation of the generated combinations:\n1) {Lorentz, Poincare, CPT}: This is the minimal fundamental symmetry set required by any local, unitary QFT (Poincaré invariance already implies Lorentz symmetry, and CPT follows from those assumptions).\n2) {Lorentz, Poincare, CP, CPT}: This extends the minimal set by including CP invariance, which is not mandatory in SMEFT operators and can be violated. Both combinations are consistent with SMEFT symmetry criteria.\nFinal Decision agent, evaluating combinations, thinking: In SMEFT, all operators must respect Poincaré invariance (which subsumes Lorentz symmetry) and CPT invariance by the CPT theorem. CP symmetry is not required and may be violated by higher-dimensional operators. Thus the minimal fundamental set is {Lorentz, Poincaré, CPT}. Imposing CP yields an extended set but is not mandatory.; answer: The minimal mandatory symmetry set is {Lorentz, Poincaré, CPT}. CP symmetry may be imposed optionally but is not required.\nCoT agent KYoI, computing validity, thinking: We assess each choice against the requirement that SMEFT operators obey full Poincaré invariance (translations + Lorentz) and CPT (ensured by locality, unitarity, Lorentz). CP is optional. Choices omitting Poincaré or CPT fail; inclusion of CP is overly restrictive but not required.; answer: Choice 1 (1,3,4): invalid – lacks full Poincaré (translations).\nChoice 2 (3,4): invalid – lacks Lorentz/Poincaré.\nChoice 3 (1,2): invalid – omits CPT invariance.\nChoice 4 (1,2,4): valid – enforces Poincaré, Lorentz, and CPT, as required by SMEFT.', iteration_idx=-1)]
