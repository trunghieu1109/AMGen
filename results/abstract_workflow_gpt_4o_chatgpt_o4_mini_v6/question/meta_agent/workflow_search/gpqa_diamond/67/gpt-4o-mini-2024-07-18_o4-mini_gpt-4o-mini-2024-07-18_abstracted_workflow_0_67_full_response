Its magnetic moment is μ = γS. In a magnetic field B, it experiences the Zeeman interaction H = –μ·B = –γ S·B, causing energy splitting and Larmor precession at frequency ω = γB.; answer: The spin-1/2 particle has spin operator S = ħ/2·σ, magnetic moment μ = γS, and interacts with a magnetic field via the Zeeman Hamiltonian H = –μ·B = –γ S·B, leading to Larmor precession at frequency ω = γB.\nCoT agent JTtU, classifying magnetic field states, thinking: The sub-task asks for the orientations of the magnetic field before and after the switch. Initially the field points along +Z, so the particle is in the Sz=+½ eigenstate (spin‐up along Z). After the switch the field points along +Y, so the new quantization axis is Y and the initial Sz=+ state becomes a superposition of Sy eigenstates.; answer: Initial state: Magnetic field B along +Z; spin in Sz=+½ (spin‐up along Z).\nFinal state: Magnetic field B along +Y; quantization axis is Y, and the original Sz=+½ state is now a superposition of Sy eigenstates.\nCoT agent wCJ7, assessing impact of turning off +Z field, thinking: Turning off the +Z field instantaneously is just a sudden change in the Hamiltonian; it does not perform any measurement or unitary rotation by itself. The spin state immediately before and after the switch is identical—it remains the |Sz=+½〉 eigenstate of the former Hamiltonian. Only when the new +Y field is applied does this unchanged state begin evolving (and appear as a superposition of Sy eigenstates).; answer: At the moment the +Z field is turned off, the spin remains in the |Sz=+½⟩ state (spin-up along Z), since an instantaneous removal of the field does not alter the quantum state.\nCoT agent jwzs, evaluating effect of +Y field, thinking: When the B-field is switched to +Y, the Hamiltonian becomes H=−γB\u2009S_y. The initial |S_z=+½⟩ state is an equal superposition of S_y eigenstates, so under H it precesses about the y‐axis. This gives ⟨S_z⟩(t)=½\u2009cos(γBt), i.e. the z‐component oscillates sinusoidally at angular frequency ω=γB.; answer: The +Y field causes the spin to precess about the y‐axis, so the z‐component of the magnetic moment oscillates as ⟨μ_z⟩(t)=μ\u2009cos(γBt), i.e. at angular frequency γ\u2009B.\nCoT agent abCR, deriving oscillation frequency expression, thinking: With the B‐field along +Y the Hamiltonian is H=−γB\u2009S_y. The initial |S_z=+½⟩ state precesses about the y‐axis, giving ⟨S_z⟩(t)=(ħ/2)cos(ωt). The precession (angular) frequency ω follows from Schrödinger evolution under H, namely ω=γB.; answer: The oscillation angular frequency of μ_z is ω=γB.\nCoT agent F2yZ, identifying correct oscillation frequency, thinking: The derived expression for the oscillation angular frequency is ω=γB, which matches choice B).; answer: B)\nCoT agent AV8b, combining frequency with constants, thinking: The derived angular frequency ω equals γB, so combining with the constants gives ω = γ B.; answer: ω = γ B\nCoT agent NsYj, transforming final expression, thinking: To match ω=γB with the provided options, we see that choice2 is γB.; answer: B)', iteration_idx=-1)]
