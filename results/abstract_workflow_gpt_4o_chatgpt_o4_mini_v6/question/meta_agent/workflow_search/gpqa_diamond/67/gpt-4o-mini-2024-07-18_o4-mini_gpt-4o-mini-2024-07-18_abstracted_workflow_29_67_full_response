With B along +Z the Hamiltonian H=−μ·B=−γBS_z, giving stationary opposite energy levels and no transverse precession.; answer: Initial conditions: The spin-½ particle is in the spin-up eigenstate of S_z, so its magnetic moment is μ=γS_z pointing along +Z. With the magnetic field B aligned in +Z, the Hamiltonian H=−μ·B=−γB\u2009S_z, and the spin state remains aligned (no transverse precession).\nCoT-SC agent M0Ha, determining effects of magnetic field change, thinking: With B now along +Y, the Hamiltonian becomes H = -γB S_y, so the spin initially in |+z⟩ will rotate about the y-axis at Larmor frequency ω = γB.; answer: When the field switches to +Y, the spin undergoes Larmor precession about the y-axis.  Starting from the initial |+z⟩ state, the time‐evolved state is\n|ψ(t)⟩ = exp(−iγB S_y t/ħ)|+z⟩ = cos(γB t/2)|+z⟩ + sin(γB t/2)|−z⟩\nso the spin vector rotates in the x–z plane at angular frequency γB.\nCoT-SC agent 5JBC, determining effects of magnetic field change, thinking: The initial state is the eigenstate |↑_z〉. When B_z is turned off and B_y turned on, the Hamiltonian becomes H=−γB S_y, whose eigenstates |↑_y〉,|↓_y〉 differ from |↑_z〉. Thus |↑_z〉 is a superposition of S_y eigenstates and will evolve nontrivially, i.e. it will precess about the Y-axis at the Larmor frequency ω=γB.; answer: Sub-task 2: When the +Z field is switched off and a field B along +Y is applied, the initial |↑_z〉 state (spin up along Z) is no longer an energy eigenstate. It must be written as |↑_z〉 = (|↑_y〉 + |↓_y〉)/√2, where |↑_y〉 and |↓_y〉 are eigenstates of S_y with energies ∓(γBħ/2). Under H=−γB S_y the two components acquire phase factors e^{±i(γB/2)t}, so the spin state precesses about the Y-axis at angular frequency ω=γB, remaining a time-dependent superposition of |↑_z〉 and |↓_z〉.\nCoT-SC agent JWtA, determining effects of magnetic field change, thinking: When the field is switched from +Z to +Y, the Hamiltonian changes from H = –γB S_z to H = –γB S_y. The initial |+z> eigenstate is no longer an energy eigenstate and will evolve by rotating about the Y-axis. This time evolution generates oscillations in the expectation value of S_z (and thus μ_z).; answer: The new Hamiltonian is H = –γB S_y, so the initial |+z> state evolves as |ψ(t)⟩ = exp(–iγB S_y t/ħ)|+z〉, i.e., it precesses about the Y-axis at angular frequency ω = γB, causing μ_z to oscillate as μ_z(t) = μ cos(γB t).\nReflexion CoT agent 6Q5N, analyzing dynamics, thinking: After the field switches to +Y, the state |+z〉 precesses about the Y‐axis under H=−γB\u2009S_y. Writing |ψ(t)〉=exp(−iγB\u2009S_y\u2009t/ħ)|+z〉 and evaluating ⟨S_z⟩ gives ⟨S_z⟩=(ħ/2)\u2009cos(γB\u2009t). Since μ_z=γ⟨S_z⟩, μ_z(t) oscillates as μ\u2009cos(γB\u2009t). Thus the oscillation angular frequency is ω=γB.; answer: The z–component of the magnetic moment oscillates as μ_z(t)=μ\u2009cos(γB\u2009t), i.e. at angular frequency ω=γB.\nCritic agent tW1Y, providing feedback, thinking: The analysis correctly identifies Larmor precession about the Y–axis and finds ω=γB, but it assumes an idealized, instantaneous field switch with no transient dynamics, perfect alignment of the magnetic field, no decoherence or relaxation, and neglects any additional interactions or higher-order corrections that could modify the oscillation.; answer: gamma*B\nReflexion CoT agent 6Q5N, refining dynamics analysis, thinking: After the field switches to +Y, the Hamiltonian becomes H=−γB S_y. The initial |+z⟩ state evolves as |ψ(t)⟩=e^(−iγB S_y t/ħ)|+z⟩, which describes Larmor precession about the Y-axis. Calculating ⟨S_z⟩ for this state gives (ħ/2)cos(γB t). Since μ_z=γ⟨S_z⟩, it follows that μ_z(t)=μ cos(γB t), i.e. the oscillation angular frequency is ω=γB.; answer: The z-component of the magnetic moment oscillates as μ_z(t)=μ cos(γB t), with angular frequency ω=γB.\nCoT agent tede, calculating oscillation frequency, thinking: Based on the time evolution of the |+z> state under H = -γB S_y and calculating ⟨S_z⟩(t) = (ħ/2) cos(γB t), the z-component of the magnetic moment oscillates with angular frequency ω = γB.; answer: γB\nDebate agent R5zW, round 0, evaluating frequency, thinking: The time evolution yields ⟨S_z⟩(t)∝cos(γB t), so the oscillation angular frequency is ω=γB, matching choice2.; answer: B)\nDebate agent BvTM, round 0, evaluating frequency, thinking: From the time evolution ⟨S_z⟩(t) ∝ cos(γB t) we identify the oscillation angular frequency ω = γB.
