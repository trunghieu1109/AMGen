Iteration: abstracted_workflow_8_60
proposed answer: Heating the diazonium salt leads to loss of N₂ and formation of an aryl radical/cation that couples via Gomberg–Bachmann with anisole at its para position. The bromine remains at the 3-position of the original ring, giving 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_10_60
proposed answer: Heating the 3-bromobenzenediazonium salt with anisole triggers a Gomberg–Bachmann aryl–aryl coupling at the para position of anisole, yielding 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl, which corresponds to choice 2.
