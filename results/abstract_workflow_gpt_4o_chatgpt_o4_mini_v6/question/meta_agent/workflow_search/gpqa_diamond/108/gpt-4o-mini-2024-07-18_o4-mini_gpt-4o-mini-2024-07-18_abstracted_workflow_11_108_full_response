The problem statement gives the intrinsic parity of X as –1.; answer: Initial NN state 1S0: S=0, L=0, J=0; intrinsic parity of X = –1.\nCoT agent Qr05, extracting and analyzing Pauli statistics, thinking: The Pauli condition T = S + L + 1 (mod 2) with T=0 implies S+L+1≡0⇒S+L≡1 (mod 2), so the sum of spin and orbital angular momentum in the final NN state must be odd.; answer: For T(NN)=0, the condition S(NN)+L(NN)+1≡0 (mod 2) gives S(NN)+L(NN)≡1 (mod 2). Thus allowed final NN states must have S+L odd.\nCoT agent ZiTx, listing possible final NN states, thinking: The Pauli requirement for T=0 implies S+L≡1 mod 2. Hence either S=0 with L odd or S=1 with L even. The term symbols follow (2S+1)L_J with J arising from coupling S and L.; answer: Possible final NN states (2S+1)L_J satisfying S+L odd for T=0:\n\nS=0, L odd → singlet odd-L states:\n  • 1P1  (L=1, J=1)\n  • 1F3  (L=3, J=3)\n  • 1H5  (L=5, J=5)\n  … and higher singlet states with odd L.\n\nS=1, L even → triplet even-L states:\n  • 3S1  (L=0, J=1)\n  • 3D1, 3D2, 3D3  (L=2, J=1,2,3)\n  • 3G3, 3G4, 3G5  (L=4, J=3,4,5)\n  … and higher triplet states with even L.\nCoT agent LKhW, analyzing choices for conservation laws, thinking: We require that the final NN state satisfy both the Pauli constraint T=0 ⇒ S+L odd and that total J and parity are conserved when emitting X.  Checking each choice:\n\n1) 1S0 → 3P0 + s:  here S=1, L_NN=1 ⇒ S+L=2 (even), so T=0 is violated.  Parity and J conservation separately would be fine, but the Pauli (isospin–spin–orbital) rule fails.\n2) 1S0 → 7D1 + p:  this state would require S=3 (impossible for two nucleons).\n3) 1S0 → 3D3 + f:  S=1, L_NN=2 ⇒ S+L=3 (odd), and J_NN=3 can couple to ℓ_X=3 to give J=0, parity OK.\n4) 1S0 → 3S1 + p:  S=1, L_NN=0 ⇒ S+L=1 (odd), J_NN=1 with ℓ_X=1 can give J=0, parity OK.\n\nThus the only listed transition that fails the required Pauli (isospin–spin–orbital) rule is 1S0 → 3P0 + s.; answer: A)\nCoT agent gjPj, evaluating choices, thinking: Checking each transition for total angular momentum and intrinsic parity conservation: \n\nA) 1S0 → 3P0 + s: J_initial=0, J_NN=0, ℓ_X=0 can couple to J=0; parity_initial = +1, parity_final = (-1)^L_NN * [intrinsic X * (-1)^ℓ_X] = (-1)^1 * [(-1)*1] = +1.
