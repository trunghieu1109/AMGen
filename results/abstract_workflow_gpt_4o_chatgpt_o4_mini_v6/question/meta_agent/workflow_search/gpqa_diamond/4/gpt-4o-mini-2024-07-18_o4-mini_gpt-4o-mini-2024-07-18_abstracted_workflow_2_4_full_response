Specifically, P_x = (ħ/2)σ_x, P_y = (ħ/2)σ_y, and P_z = (ħ/2)σ_z. These matrices obey the SU(2) algebra and serve to generate rotations and define spin measurements along the x, y, and z axes. To find the eigenvector along an arbitrary direction n in the x–z plane, one forms the combination n·P = P_x\u2009sinθ + P_z\u2009cosθ, diagonalizes it, and obtains the spinor whose components are functions of θ (and φ if y were involved). This analysis shows that the basic building blocks are the Pauli matrices and that the eigenvector will involve simple trigonometric half‐angles of θ.; answer: P_x = (ħ/2)[[0,1],[1,0]], P_y = (ħ/2)[[0,-i],[i,0]], P_z = (ħ/2)[[1,0],[0,-1]]; they are Pauli matrices that generate the spinor eigenvector along any direction.\nCoT-SC agent wCan, classifying eigenvalue and direction vector, thinking: From sub-task 1 we know P·n = (ħ/2)(σx\u2009sinθ + σz\u2009cosθ). Its eigenvalues are ±ħ/2, corresponding to spin‐½ up or down along n. The given eigenvalue +ħ/2 is thus the “spin up” state along the direction n, which in the x–z plane is parametrized by the polar angle θ.; answer: Eigenvalue: +ħ/2 ⇒ spin-up along n\nDirection vector n: (sinθ, 0, cosθ)\nCoT-SC agent OOE7, classifying eigenvalue and direction vector, thinking: In a spin-1/2 system like the muon, the operator P·n has two eigenvalues ±ħ/2. The given eigenvalue +ħ/2 corresponds to the spin-up (parallel) state along the chosen axis. Since n lies in the x–z plane, we parametrize it by the polar angle θ as n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ). Thus measuring the spin projection along n yields +ħ/2 for the spin-up eigenstate.; answer: Eigenvalue: +ħ/2 (spin-up state)\nDirection vector n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ) (unit vector in the x–z plane)\nCoT-SC agent Dt0q, classifying eigenvalue and direction vector, thinking: The eigenvalue in question is +ħ/2, which in spin-½ quantum mechanics denotes the “spin-up” state along the chosen axis. The arbitrary direction n lying in the x–z plane can be parameterized by a polar angle θ (with φ=0), giving n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ). Thus the muon’s spin operator n·P has eigenvalue +ħ/2 for the spin-up eigenvector along n.; answer: Eigenvalue: +ħ/2 (spin-up)\nDirection vector n in x–z plane: n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ)\nDebate agent 56D6, round 0, transforming matrices, thinking: To find the spin‐operator along an arbitrary unit vector n in the x–z plane, with n=(sinθ,0,cosθ), form the linear combination P·n = P_x\u2009sinθ + P_z\u2009cosθ. Substituting P_x=(ħ/2)σ_x and P_z=(ħ/2)σ_z gives P·n=(ħ/2)(sinθ\u2009σ_x+cosθ\u2009σ_z), whose 2×2 matrix representation is straightforward to write down.; answer: P·n = sinθ\u2009P_x + cosθ\u2009P_z = (ħ/2)[sinθ\u2009σ_x + cosθ\u2009σ_z] = (ħ/2)⎡⎣[cosθ, sinθ]; [sinθ, -cosθ]⎤⎦\nDebate agent YWUl, round 0, transforming matrices, thinking: We construct the operator along direction n in the x–z plane, n·P = P_x\u2009sinθ + P_z\u2009cosθ.

Expressing the Pauli matrices yields a 2×2 matrix that can be diagonalized to find the +ħ/2 eigenvector.; answer: P_n = n·P = P_x\u2009sinθ + P_z\u2009cosθ = (ħ/2)(sinθ\u2009σ_x + cosθ\u2009σ_z) = (ħ/2) [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, –cosθ]]\nDebate agent kOjg, round 0, transforming matrices, thinking: To find the operator along the direction n in the x–z plane (n=(sinθ,0,cosθ)), we form the linear combination P·n = P_x\u2009sinθ + P_z\u2009cosθ.
