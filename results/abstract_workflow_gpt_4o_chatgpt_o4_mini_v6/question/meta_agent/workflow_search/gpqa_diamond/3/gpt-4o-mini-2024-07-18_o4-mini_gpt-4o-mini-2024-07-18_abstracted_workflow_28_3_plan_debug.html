 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent bapV:
Magnetic monopoles introduce a nonzero magnetic charge density ρ_m, so Gauss’s law for magnetism (∇·B) is modified. The accompanying magnetic current J_m also alters Faraday’s law (∇×E). The other two Maxwell equations remain unchanged.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent bapV:
The equations for the divergence of the magnetic field (Gauss’s law for magnetism) and the curl of the electric field (Faraday’s law).

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Evaluate the implications of the modified equations on the behavior of electric and magnetic fields in this parallel universe, and compare them to the original Maxwell&#39;s equations.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>The modifications introduce nonzero magnetic charge density and current, altering Gauss’s law for magnetism and Faraday’s law. These changes allow magnetic field lines to begin and end on monopoles and add a source term to the curl of E, yielding new field behaviors. 

Answer:In this parallel universe, Gauss’s law for magnetism becomes ∇·B=ρ_m (allowing magnetic field lines to originate and terminate on monopoles) and Faraday’s law becomes ∇×E=−∂B/∂t−J_m (so moving monopoles produce nonconservative electric fields). Compared to the original Maxwell equations (∇·B=0 and ∇×E=−∂B/∂t), these imply: 
1) Magnetic charges act as true sources and sinks of B, giving radial B fields around monopoles analogous to E fields around electric charges. 
2) Magnetic currents generate electric circulation independent of changing B, so E is no longer curl-free in the absence of time-varying B. 
3) The equations become fully symmetric under electric–magnetic duality. 
Overall, field topologies and induction phenomena are richer: magnetic monopoles and their currents behave like electric charges and currents, leading to mirror EM dynamics not present in the original formulation.</pre>
