This is a straightforward recall of the four classical Maxwell equations.; answer: The standard Maxwell’s equations in differential form are:\n1. Gauss’s law for electricity (divergence of E): ∇·E = ρ/ε₀\n2. Gauss’s law for magnetism (divergence of B): ∇·B = 0\n3. Faraday’s law of induction (curl of E): ∇×E = -∂B/∂t\n4.

Gauss’s law for magnetism (divergence of B) is no longer zero but equals ρ_m, and Faraday’s law (curl of E) picks up an extra −J_m term.
