Introducing magnetic charge density ρm and magnetic current Jm makes ∇·B=μ0ρm and adds −μ0Jm to ∇×E. Thus the equations for the divergence of B and the curl of E change.; answer: With monopoles, Gauss’s law for magnetism becomes ∇·B = μ₀\u2009ρm, and Faraday’s law becomes ∇×E = −∂B/∂t − μ₀\u2009Jm.\nCoT agent bD3a, determining changed equations, thinking: Magnetic monopoles introduce a magnetic charge density ρm into Gauss’s law for magnetism and a magnetic current density Jm into Faraday’s law, so those two equations change.; answer: The equations that change are Gauss’s law for magnetism (∇·B=0 → ∇·B=μ₀\u2009ρm) and Faraday’s law (∇×E=−∂B/∂t → ∇×E=−∂B/∂t − μ₀\u2009Jm).\nCoT agent ynm6, evaluating implications, thinking: Magnetic monopoles introduce a magnetic charge density into Gauss’s law for magnetism (∇·B) and a magnetic current density into Faraday’s law (∇×E), so the equations for divergence of B and circulation of E change.; answer: C)", iteration_idx=-1)]
