        "response": "The modifications introduce nonzero magnetic charge density and current, altering Gauss\u2019s law for magnetism and Faraday\u2019s law. These changes allow magnetic field lines to begin and end on monopoles and add a source term to the curl of E, yielding new field behaviors. \n\nAnswer:In this parallel universe, Gauss\u2019s law for magnetism becomes \u2207\u00b7B=\u03c1_m (allowing magnetic field lines to originate and terminate on monopoles) and Faraday\u2019s law becomes \u2207\u00d7E=\u2212\u2202B/\u2202t\u2212J_m (so moving monopoles produce nonconservative electric fields). Compared to the original Maxwell equations (\u2207\u00b7B=0 and \u2207\u00d7E=\u2212\u2202B/\u2202t), these imply: \n1) Magnetic charges act as true sources and sinks of B, giving radial B fields around monopoles analogous to E fields around electric charges. \n2) Magnetic currents generate electric circulation independent of changing B, so E is no longer curl-free in the absence of time-varying B. \n3) The equations become fully symmetric under electric\u2013magnetic duality. \nOverall, field topologies and induction phenomena are richer: magnetic monopoles and their currents behave like electric charges and currents, leading to mirror EM dynamics not present in the original formulation.",
