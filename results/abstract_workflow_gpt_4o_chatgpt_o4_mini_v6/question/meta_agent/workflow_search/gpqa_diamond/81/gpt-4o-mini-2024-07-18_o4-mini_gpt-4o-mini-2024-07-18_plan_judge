proposed answer: In the cycloaddition of product 2 (a bicyclo[4.4.0]deca-2,8-diene diester) with cyclopentadiene, two stereochemical outcomes are possible at the newly formed bicyclo[2.2.1] framework: the endo adduct (both ester groups syn to the methano bridge) or the exo adduct (one or both esters anti). Secondary orbital interactions (so‐called “endo rule”) favor the endo transition state, placing the π* orbitals of the ester groups in overlap with the diene’s π system, and leading to a lower-energy pathway. Steric repulsion between the bridgehead protons and ester substituents is modest compared to the stabilizing orbital effects, so the endo-syn isomer predominates. Exo isomers lack these favorable interactions and are formed only in minor amounts.

Answer:The major isomer of product 3 is the endo-syn adduct (choice A), in which both ester substituents are oriented syn to the newly formed methano bridgehead, reflecting the favored secondary orbital interactions in the Diels–Alder transition state.
Extracted answer: The major isomer of product 3 is the endo-syn adduct (choice A), in which both ester substituents are oriented syn to the newly formed methano bridgehead, reflecting the favored secondary orbital interactions in the Diels–Alder transition state.

proposed answer: The endo Diels–Alder addition of cyclopentadiene to the alkene in product 2 directs the new bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene bridge syn to the ester groups. Three of four agents (pLm8, 1E7d, ODcR) agree that only choice 1 (A) matches the required stereochemistry (both esters and the bridge on the same face). Thus the major isomer is choice A.
