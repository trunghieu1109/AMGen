The most deshielded proton is the one sandwiched between two C=O’s; it couples to two diastereotopic CH2’s (2\u2009H each) with two different J’s, giving a triplet of triplets.; answer: B)\nCoT agent z2gj, determining structure of product 3, thinking: The sequence: 1,3-dibromoadamantane → KOH (240 °C) gives an exocyclic methylene ketone (product 1); Al(OiPr)₃ catalyzes Oppenauer isomerization to the endocyclic α,β-unsaturated ketone (product 2); ozonolysis of that enone cleaves the C=C to give two adjacent C=O groups.  In principle this yields a vicinal diketone derived from the former enone carbons within the adamantane cage.  However, without additional spectroscopic data the precise ring‐opening vs. cage‐retention pattern and exact connectivity of the two new carbonyl positions cannot be assigned unambiguously.; answer: Proposed structure of product 3: the vicinal diketone obtained by ozonolysis of the cyclic enone in product 2 – i.e. a bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane‐2,3‐dione framework (the former α and β carbons of the enone now bear C=O groups).\n[TOO_HARD]\nPlease provide high-resolution 13C NMR (DEPT, HSQC, HMBC) and mass spectrometric data to confirm the connectivity and whether the adamantane cage remains intact or partially opens upon ozonolysis.\nCoT agent oxKq, evaluating coupling patterns, thinking: The proposed product 3 is a bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-2,3-dione, giving a bridgehead proton adjacent to two carbonyls.
