Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_88
proposed answer: Although the exact structure and NMR data of product 3 are not provided, the most deshielded non‐exchangeable proton is likely an aldehydic hydrogen. Aldehyde protons typically couple to two equivalent methylene protons, giving a triplet. However, without J‐values or structure, this remains a best‐guess.

Answer:D)
[TOO_HARD]
Please provide the 1H NMR spectrum data (chemical shifts, integration, coupling constants) or the detailed structure of product 3 so the coupling pattern can be confirmed.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_29_88
proposed answer: The most deshielded bridgehead proton couples with two distinct sets of two methylene protons, each splitting it into a triplet. This yields an overall triplet of triplets pattern.
