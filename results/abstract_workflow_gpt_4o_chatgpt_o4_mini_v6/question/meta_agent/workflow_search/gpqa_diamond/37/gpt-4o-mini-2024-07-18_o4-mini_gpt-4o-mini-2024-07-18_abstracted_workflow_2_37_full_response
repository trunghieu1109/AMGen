Deprotonation by LDA at the α‐position generates the enamine anion (step i), which is then alkylated with ethyl iodide in DME (step ii). Subsequent hydrolysis (H₃O⁺, step iii) regenerates the carbonyl. Thus the enamine derived from pentan-2-one is α‐ethylated to give heptan-4-one via an enamine alkylation followed by hydrolysis.; answer: Reactants: (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium (an enamine) and LDA, CH₃CH₂I, H₃O⁺ (reagent sequence). Product: heptan-4-one. Reaction type: enamine alkylation (nucleophilic enamine reacts with alkyl halide) followed by hydrolysis to regenerate the ketone.\nCoT-SC agent HjcM, classifying reaction types, thinking: The reaction involves an enamine acting as an enolate equivalent: after deprotonation, it attacks an alkyl halide, which is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) on the alkyl iodide. Enamine formation itself is a condensation (secondary amine + carbonyl). Electrophilic additions would involve addition to C=C by an electrophile, which is not the case here.; answer: Nucleophilic substitutions: reactions where a nucleophile replaces a leaving group (e.g., enamine alkylation with alkyl halide). Electrophilic additions: additions of electrophiles to unsaturated bonds (e.g., protonation of alkenes). Condensation: joining two molecules with loss of a small molecule (e.g., enamine formation from a ketone and secondary amine). The given reaction (enamine alkylation followed by hydrolysis) is a nucleophilic substitution.\nCoT-SC agent GJzD, classifying reaction types, thinking: The enamine acts as a nucleophile, attacking the alkyl halide in an SN2‐type step; acid workup hydrolyzes the enamine to the ketone. Thus among the listed reaction types, it is a nucleophilic substitution.; answer: Nucleophilic substitution\nCoT-SC agent yfHh, classifying reaction types, thinking: The enamine alkylation sequence involves deprotonation and SN2 attack on an alkyl halide, then hydrolysis. This fits under nucleophilic substitution rather than electrophilic addition or condensation.; answer: Reactions mentioned: nucleophilic substitutions, electrophilic additions, condensation. The given enamine alkylation/hydrolysis is a nucleophilic substitution.\nCoT agent iE6k, extracting reagents, thinking: The enamine is first deprotonated at the α‐position by LDA in DME, forming a nucleophilic enamine anion. This anion then undergoes alkylation with ethyl iodide (CH3CH2I) to install an ethyl group. Finally, the acidic workup with H3O+ hydrolyzes the enamine back to the ketone, yielding the α‐ethylated product heptan-4-one.; answer: Reagent sequence: (i) LDA in DME – deprotonates the enamine to form the enamine anion; (ii) CH3CH2I – alkylating agent that adds an ethyl group at the α‐position; (iii) H3O+ – acid workup that hydrolyzes the enamine to regenerate the ketone.\nDebate agent hW3g, round 0, selecting product, thinking: The enamine derived from pentan-2-one is deprotonated by LDA in DME to form the enolate equivalent, which is then alkylated by ethyl iodide (CH3CH2I) at the α-position.
