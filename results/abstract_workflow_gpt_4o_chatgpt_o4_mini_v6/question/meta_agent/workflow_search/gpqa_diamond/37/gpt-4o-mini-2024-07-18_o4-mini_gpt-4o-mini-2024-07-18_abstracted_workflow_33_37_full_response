Limitations include the strict requirement for low temperatures and anhydrous conditions to avoid competing enolate side reactions, potential over‐alkylation if stoichiometry isn’t tightly controlled, possible O-alkylation competing with C-alkylation, and the need for careful pH control during hydrolysis to prevent further condensations.\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Confirm the correct sequence of reagents (A) that leads to the identified product (B).

Competing enolate chemistry—direct enolate formation can lead to side products if reaction conditions are not tightly controlled. \n4.
