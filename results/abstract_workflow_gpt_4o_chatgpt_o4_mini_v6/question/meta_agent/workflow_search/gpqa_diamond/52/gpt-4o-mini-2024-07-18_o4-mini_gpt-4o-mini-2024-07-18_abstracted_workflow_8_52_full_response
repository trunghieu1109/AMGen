Ester C=O stretches appear around 1735–1750 cm⁻¹, and C–O stretches around 1200–1300 cm⁻¹. These are characteristic and unambiguous, so we can confirm the ester without missing information.; answer: The FTIR spectrum shows a strong carbonyl stretch at ~1735 cm⁻¹ and prominent C–O stretches at ~1250 cm⁻¹ and ~1150 cm⁻¹, confirming the presence of an ester group.\nCoT agent hb4W, interpreting 1H NMR data, thinking: The NMR shows exactly six distinct 1H signals: two in the aromatic region (each integrating to two protons), two in the olefinic region (one a simple doublet, the other a doublet of quartets), and two methyl signals (each integrating to three protons). There are no –CH₂ signals. This matches the presence of an aromatic di-substituted ring, a vinyl fragment, and two methyl groups (one as an ester methyl).; answer: Aromatic-H: two separate multiplets (each 2H) in the 6.8–7.3 ppm range Vinyl-H: one doublet (1H, J≈16 Hz) and one doublet of quartets (1H, J≈16, 6 Hz) CH₃ groups: two singlets (each 3H), one at ~3.7 ppm (ester-OCH₃), one at ~2.3 ppm (aryl-CH₃) No –CH₂ signals are observed.\nCoT agent v2Kj, calculating total atoms, thinking: The 1H NMR integrations sum to 4\u2009H (aromatic) + 2\u2009H (vinyl) + 6\u2009H (two CH₃) = 12\u2009H.
