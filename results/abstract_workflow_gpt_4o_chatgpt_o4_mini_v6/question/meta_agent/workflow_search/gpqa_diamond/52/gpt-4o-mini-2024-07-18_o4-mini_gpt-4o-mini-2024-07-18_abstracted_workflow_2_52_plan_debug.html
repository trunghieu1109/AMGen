    <pre>Related original question:

{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;You have prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The FTIR spectrum of this compound shows absorption peaks indicating the presence of an ester group. The 1H NMR spectrum shows six signals: two signals corresponding to aromatic-H, two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups. There are no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups. Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, or C12H14O2.&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;C12H14O2&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;C12H12O2&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;C11H14O2&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;C11H12O2&#39;}.

### Sub-task 3: Based on the analysis from the FTIR and 1H NMR spectra, deduce the possible structural features of the compound, including the arrangement of the aromatic ring and the ester group. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent VE5F:
The IR confirms an ester. The NMR shows two aromatic signals (each 2H), indicating a symmetric disubstitution pattern (para). The alkene protons (d, J≈16; dq, J≈16,7) imply a trans-CH=CH–Me substituent. The methyl signals (s for OCH3 and d for CH3 on the alkene) complete the picture. Thus the ring bears a methyl ester and a trans-propenyl group in para positions.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent VE5F:
A para-disubstituted benzene carrying a methyl ester (–CO2Me) and a trans-propenyl (E-CH=CH–Me) group; i.e. methyl (E)-4-(prop-1-enyl)benzoate.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Evaluate the possible chemical formulas (C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2) against the deduced structural features and the number of hydrogen atoms indicated by the NMR analysis to select the correct formula.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
