Question: Example(question='You have prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The FTIR spectrum of this compound shows absorption peaks indicating the presence of an ester group. The 1H NMR spectrum shows six signals: two signals corresponding to aromatic-H, two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups. There are no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups. Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, or C12H14O2.', choice1='C12H14O2', choice2='C12H12O2', choice3='C11H14O2', choice4='C11H12O2', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_52
proposed answer: Counting the atoms in methyl (E)-4-(prop-1-enyl)benzoate: ring C6H4 + ester –CO2Me (C2H3O2) + propenyl CH=CH–Me (C3H5) gives C11H12O2.

Answer:C11H12O2
Extracted answer: C11H12O2
Correct answer: 3
