    <pre>Related original question:

{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;You have prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The FTIR spectrum of this compound shows absorption peaks indicating the presence of an ester group. The 1H NMR spectrum shows six signals: two signals corresponding to aromatic-H, two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups. There are no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups. Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, or C12H14O2.&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;C12H14O2&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;C12H12O2&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;C11H14O2&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;C11H12O2&#39;}. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 3: Calculate the total number of carbon (C) and hydrogen (H) atoms based on the signals identified in the 1H NMR spectrum, considering the structure of the compound and the presence of the ester group. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent v2Kj:
The 1H NMR integrations sum to 4 H (aromatic) + 2 H (vinyl) + 6 H (two CH₃) = 12 H. Carbons: 6 in the benzene ring + 2 in the vinyl group + 1 ester carbonyl + 2 methyl carbons = 11 C.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent v2Kj:
Total carbons: 11; total hydrogens: 12

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Compare the calculated chemical formula with the provided options (C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2) to identify the correct formula for the compound.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
