Question: Example(question='A textile dye containing an extensively conjugated pi-electrons emits light with energy of 2.3393 eV. What color of light is absorbed by the organic compound?', choice1='Blue', choice2='Yellow', choice3='Red', choice4='Violet', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_29
proposed answer: The calculated wavelength is approximately 530 nm, which falls in the green region of the visible spectrum. However, none of the provided choices (Blue, Yellow, Red, Violet) correspond to green, so the question’s answer choices are incomplete.

Answer:Green (~530 nm)
[TOO_HARD]
Please provide color options that include green or clarify how 530 nm should map to the given choices.
Extracted answer: Green (~530 nm)
Correct answer: 2

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_6_29
proposed answer: Energy 2.3393 eV corresponds to λ≈530 nm (green). The dye absorbs green, so its complementary color is red.

Answer:C)
