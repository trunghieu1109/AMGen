In dyes, the absorbed light is typically the complementary color to the emitted light. The complement of green is red.; answer: The dye emits green light (λ ≈ 530 nm), so it absorbs red light (the complementary color).\nCoT-SC agent Ehfa, classifying energy value, thinking: First, convert the photon energy to wavelength using λ (nm) = 1240 eV·nm / E (eV) = 1240 / 2.3393 ≈ 530 nm, which lies in the green region of the visible spectrum.; answer: It corresponds to approximately 530 nm, which is green light.\nCoT-SC agent Zf78, classifying energy value, thinking: To classify an energy of 2.3393 eV, convert to wavelength via λ(nm)≈1240 eV·nm/E(eV) → λ≈1240/2.3393≈530 nm, which lies in the green region of the visible spectrum.; answer: Energy 2.3393 eV corresponds to a wavelength of ≈530 nm, i.e. green light.\nCoT-SC agent UBrz, classifying energy value, thinking: We convert energy (eV) to wavelength (nm) via λ(nm)=1240/E(eV).
