A carbonyl stretch in the IR suggests an acetophenone moiety, and the aromatic–halogen bond indicates a halo group on the ring. With two substituents, the simplest symmetrical pattern (para) will give four aromatic protons as two equivalent pairs (2H each), appearing as two doublets, and the acetyl methyl as a singlet. This matches a para-chloroacetophenone structure.; answer: The compound is p-chloroacetophenone (4-chlorophenyl ethanone).\nDebate agent DI59, round 0, identifying chemical shifts, thinking: Based on the structure of p-chloroacetophenone (para‐substituted acetophenone), the aromatic ring has two sets of equivalent protons (2H each) split into doublets by ortho coupling.
