        "response": "We confirm that the compound is para-bromoacetophenone (C6H4BrCOCH3). In a para-disubstituted benzene, the four aromatic protons split into two equivalent sets (2H each) that couple ortho to each other, giving two doublets. The electron-withdrawing carbonyl group (\u2013CO\u2013) and bromine atom both deshield these protons, shifting them downfield to around 7.6\u20137.8 ppm. The methyl group attached to the carbonyl appears as a singlet around 2.3 ppm because it has no neighboring protons.\n\nAnswer:The two aromatic doublets at 7.8 ppm (2H, d) and 7.6 ppm (2H, d) arise from the para-disubstituted benzene protons deshielded by both the carbonyl and bromine substituents. The singlet at 2.3 ppm (3H, s) corresponds to the acetyl methyl group adjacent to the carbonyl. This pattern matches choice 4.",

        "response": "All proposed 1H NMR patterns reflect the expected two aromatic doublets (2H each) and one methyl singlet (3H). The most representative values in CDCl\u2083 are around \u03b4 7.8 and 7.6 for the aromatic protons (J \u2248 8.5 Hz) and \u03b4 2.4 for the acetyl methyl. This closely matches both literature and the original multiple-choice option (7.8, 7.6, 2.3). Therefore, the SKSX Set 1 is the best choice.\n\nAnswer:\u03b4 7.85 (2H, d, J = 8.5 Hz), \u03b4 7.60 (2H, d, J = 8.5 Hz), \u03b4 2.40 (3H, s)",
