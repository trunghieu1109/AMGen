It matches the mathematical derivation and physical expectations.\n\nAnswer:The expression U = -\u00bd k q\u00b2 R/(d\u00b2 - R\u00b2) is fully consistent with the underlying physical principles (grounded boundary condition, method of images) and the mathematical derivation for the potential energy of the system.",
