proposed answer: Since no specific numerical values for q, d, and R were provided, we cannot compute a numerical result. We can, however, present the final symbolic expression and indicate that further information is needed.

Answer:Potential Energy:
U = -\u00bd k q^2 R/(d^2 - R^2)

proposed answer: The chosen expression U = -½ k q² R/(d² - R²) was obtained by applying the method of images to enforce the zero-potential boundary of the grounded sphere, computing the interaction energy as ½ q φ_image, and yields the correct limiting behaviors (U→0 as d→∞, U→-∞ as d→R⁺) consistent with attraction between charge and induced charges. It matches the mathematical derivation and physical expectations.

Answer:The expression U = -½ k q² R/(d² - R²) is fully consistent with the underlying physical principles (grounded boundary condition, method of images) and the mathematical derivation for the potential energy of the system.
