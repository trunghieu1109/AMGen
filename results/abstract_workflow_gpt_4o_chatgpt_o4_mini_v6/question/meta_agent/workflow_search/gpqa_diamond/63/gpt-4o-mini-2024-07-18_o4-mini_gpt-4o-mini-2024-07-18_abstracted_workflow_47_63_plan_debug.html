    <pre>Related original question:

{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;An equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 g was heated to 200°C without air. In this case, only a mixture of gases was formed, which, without cooling, was passed successively through tubes filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 (№1), Ca(OH)2 (№2) solution, and red-hot copper (№3). Results: the weights of tubes №1 and №3 increased by 3.60 g and 0.80 g, respectively (CuO formed in tube №3). The weight of the second tube has not changed. As a result, only 2.24 liters of gas C (standard temperature and pressure) remained.\nIndicate the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;15&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;13&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;17&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;19&#39;}. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 3: Identify the chemical formulas of salts A and B based on the moles calculated and the reactions that occurred in the tubes. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent 1UK8:
The data given (moles of H₂O, O₂, CO₂, and N₂ evolved and the total mass of an equimolar mixture) are insufficient to unambiguously assign specific salt formulas. Multiple salt pairs (including nitrates, carbonates, ammonium salts, etc.) could fit these gas outputs and mass changes without additional compositional or reaction-path information.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent 1UK8:
[TOO_HARD]
Please provide the elemental composition (cations and anions) or detailed decomposition reactions for salts A and B so their formulas can be determined.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Count the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of salts A and B to answer the original question.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
