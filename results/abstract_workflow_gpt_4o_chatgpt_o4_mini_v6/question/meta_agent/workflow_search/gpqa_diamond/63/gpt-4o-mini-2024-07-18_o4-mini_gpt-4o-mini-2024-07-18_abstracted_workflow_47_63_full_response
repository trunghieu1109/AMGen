Question: {'question': 'An equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 g was heated to 200°C without air. In this case, only a mixture of gases was formed, which, without cooling, was passed successively through tubes filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 (№1), Ca(OH)2 (№2) solution, and red-hot copper (№3). Results: the weights of tubes №1 and №3 increased by 3.60 g and 0.80 g, respectively (CuO formed in tube №3). The weight of the second tube has not changed. As a result, only 2.24 liters of gas C (standard temperature and pressure) remained.\nIndicate the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.', 'choice1': '15', 'choice2': '13', 'choice3': '17', 'choice4': '19'}

Without knowing what gases come from which salt (hydration water vs. decomposition water, O₂ yield per mole of salt, identity and amount of gas C), there are too many unknowns. Hence, the molar masses of A and B cannot be determined from the given data alone.; answer: Cannot determine molar masses of A and B without knowing their chemical formulas or decomposition equations.[TOO_HARD]\nPlease provide the chemical identities or decomposition stoichiometries of salts A and B so their molar masses can be calculated.\nCoT agent znMp, calculating total moles of gases, thinking: Tube №1 mass gain (3.60 g) is H₂O: n(H₂O)=3.60/18=0.20 mol. Tube №3 mass gain (0.80 g O) corresponds to O₂ consumed: n(O atoms)=0.80/16=0.05 mol, so n(O₂)=0.05/2=0.025 mol. Remaining gas C volume 2.24 L at STP is 0.10 mol. Total gases = 0.20+0.025+0.10=0.325 mol.; answer: Total moles of gases produced = 0.325 mol.\nCoT agent 1UK8, identifying chemical formulas, thinking: The data given (moles of H₂O, O₂, CO₂, and N₂ evolved and the total mass of an equimolar mixture) are insufficient to unambiguously assign specific salt formulas.
