    <pre>Related original question:

{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;An equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 g was heated to 200°C without air. In this case, only a mixture of gases was formed, which, without cooling, was passed successively through tubes filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 (№1), Ca(OH)2 (№2) solution, and red-hot copper (№3). Results: the weights of tubes №1 and №3 increased by 3.60 g and 0.80 g, respectively (CuO formed in tube №3). The weight of the second tube has not changed. As a result, only 2.24 liters of gas C (standard temperature and pressure) remained.\nIndicate the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;15&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;13&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;17&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;19&#39;}. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 5: Calculate the total number of atoms in salts A and B based on the moles calculated in subtask 3 and the chemical formulas from subtask 1. 

 ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent W2QW:
Sub-task 5 requires the actual formulas of salts A and B and the moles of each salt calculated in sub-task 3. Neither the identities (chemical formulas) nor the individual mole amounts of A and B were provided, so we cannot determine the total number of atoms without that information.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent HRB5:
Subtask 5 depends on the chemical formulas of salts A and B (from subtask 1) and their molar amounts (from subtask 3), which have not been provided. Without those key data, the total number of atoms cannot be calculated.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent 49pn:
To calculate the total number of atoms in salts A and B, I need the chemical formulas of A and B from subtask 1 and the moles of each salt from subtask 3. Neither the formulas nor the moles were provided in the user’s prompt, so I cannot compute the atom counts.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent MwyV:
The chemical formulas and mole quantities of salts A and B from subtask 1 and subtask 3 are not given, so I cannot determine how many atoms are in each. Without knowing their formulas or moles, the total atom count cannot be calculated.

### answer #1 by Debate Agent W2QW:
[TOO_HARD]
Please provide the chemical formulas of salts A and B and the number of moles of each (from sub-task 3) so we can compute the total number of atoms.

### answer #1 by Debate Agent HRB5:
Cannot determine total atoms in A and B with the given information.
[TOO_HARD]
Please provide the chemical formulas of salts A and B (subtask 1) and their mole amounts (subtask 3).

### answer #1 by Debate Agent 49pn:
[TOO_HARD]
Please provide the chemical formulas of salts A and B (from subtask 1) and the number of moles of each salt (from subtask 3) so I can determine the total number of atoms.

### answer #1 by Debate Agent MwyV:
[TOO_HARD]
Please provide the chemical formulas of salts A and B and the mole amounts determined in subtask 3.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 5: Make final decision on total number of atoms.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
