One salt must yield only N2\u2009+\u2009H2O on heating (NH4NO2 → N2\u2009+\u20092H2O), the other only O2 (M(NO3)2 → M(NO2)2\u2009+\u2009O2). However, without knowing the metal cation (and the exact stoichiometric mass balance), B cannot be uniquely identified, nor can the molar mass of A match the mixture mass. Thus the problem as stated lacks sufficient information to pinpoint unique formulas.; answer: A = NH4NO2; B = M(NO3)2  \n[TOO_HARD]  \nPlease specify the metal cation in salt B or provide additional mass/composition data to determine its formula.\nReflexion CoT agent V83n, determining molar masses, thinking: Without knowing the metal cation in B, we cannot compute its numerical molar mass. We can only express it symbolically.; answer: Molar mass of A (NH₄NO₂) = 64 g/mol\nMolar mass of B (M(NO₃)₂) = M(metal) + 124 g/mol\n[TOO_HARD]\nPlease specify the identity of the metal cation in salt B to calculate its molar mass.\nCritic agent N4Od, providing feedback, thinking: The molar mass of salt A (NH4NO2) is correctly calculated as 64 g/mol. For salt B (M(NO3)2), expressing its molar mass as “M + 124 g/mol” is formally correct but leaves it undetermined numerically because the atomic mass of the metal cation M is not specified. \nLimitations:\n- The identity (and atomic mass) of the metal M is missing, so B’s molar mass cannot be pinned down.\n- Any hydration or other ligands are not accounted for.\n- No experimental data were provided to fix the value of M.; answer: Molar mass of A = 64 g/mol; molar mass of B = (M + 124) g/mol. [TOO_HARD]\nPlease specify the identity of the metal cation in salt B to calculate its numeric molar mass.\nReflexion CoT agent V83n, refining molar mass determination, thinking: We have formulas for salts A and B, but B’s molar mass depends on an unspecified metal cation M. Without knowing the atomic mass of M, we cannot compute a numeric value for B.; answer: Molar mass of A (NH₄NO₂) = 64 g/mol\nMolar mass of B (M(NO₃)₂) = M + 124 g/mol\n[TOO_HARD]\nPlease specify the identity (atomic mass) of the metal cation M in salt B to determine its numeric molar mass.\nCoT agent V7Ak, calculating moles, thinking: The molar mass of salt B depends on the unknown atomic mass M of the metal cation. Without that, we can only express the moles in terms of M. Since it’s an equimolar mixture, let n be the moles of each. Then n·64 + n·(M+124) = 7.20 ⇒ n·(M+188)=7.20 ⇒ n=7.20/(M+188).; answer: n_A = n_B = 7.20/(M + 188) mol\n[TOO_HARD]\nPlease specify the atomic mass of the metal cation M to calculate numeric values.\nCoT agent UYuL, analyzing gas reactions, thinking: Tube №1 absorbed 3.60 g H₂O → 0.20 mol H₂O. Tube №2 absorbed no CO₂. Red‐hot Cu gained 0.80 g CuO. Reaction 2 NO₂+2 Cu→N₂+2 CuO gives Δm(CuO–Cu)=16 g per mol NO₂, so 0.80 g corresponds to 0.05 mol NO₂. Total gas passing through was 0.20+0.05=0.25 mol; 0.10 mol remained as inert gas C, which must be N₂.; answer: Gas C is N₂.\nDebate agent W2QW, round 0, calculating total atoms, thinking: Sub-task 5 requires the actual formulas of salts A and B and the moles of each salt calculated in sub-task 3.
