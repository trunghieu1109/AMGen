Question: Example(question='Identify the EXO product of the following [4+2] cycloaddition reaction.\n2,5-dimethylthiophene + Furan-2,5-dione + Heat ---> ?', choice1='(3aR,4R,7S,7aS)-4,7-dimethyl-3a,4,7,7a-tetrahydro-4,7-epithioisobenzofuran-1,3-dione', choice2='(3aR,4S,7R,7aS)-4,7-dimethyl-3a,4,7,7a-tetrahydro-4,7-epoxybenzo[c]thiophene-1,3-dione', choice3='(3aR,4R,7S,7aS)-4,7-dimethyl-3a,4,7,7a-tetrahydro-4,7-epoxybenzo[c]thiophene-1,3-dione', choice4='(3aR,4S,7R,7aS)-4,7-dimethyl-3a,4,7,7a-tetrahydro-4,7-epithioisobenzofuran-1,3-dione', correct_index=0)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_32
proposed answer: The exo cycloadduct places both methyl groups pointing away from the anhydride bridge, corresponding to the (3aR,4R,7S,7aS) configuration, which matches choice A.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_8_32
proposed answer: The major exo product from the thermal Dielsâ€“Alder of 2,5-dimethylthiophene with maleic anhydride is the epoxybenzo[c]thiophene-1,3-dione with configuration (3aR,4R,7S,7aS). Among the choices, only choice 3 matches this structure and stereochemistry.
