The Diels–Alder adduct retains the thiophene sulfur and the anhydride oxygen bridge, giving an epoxybenzo[c]thiophene-1,3-dione core. The EXO stereochemistry places the 4,7-dimethyl substituents anti to the oxygen bridge, which corresponds to the (3aR,4R,7S,7aS) configuration.; answer: C)\nCoT agent RjW0, analyzing mechanism, thinking: In a thermal Diels–Alder between 2,5-dimethylthiophene (diene) and maleic anhydride (dienophile), the bicyclic epoxybenzo[c]thiophene-1,3-dione framework forms via concerted cycloaddition. Two stereochemical outcomes arise: endo (secondary orbital overlap) and exo (minimized steric clash). Maleic anhydride is symmetric, so regioselectivity is fixed. Under heat, the exo product is favored for this heterodiene due to relief of steric strain near the sulfur and anhydride bridge.; answer: Possible products: Endo adduct: (3aR,4S,7R,7aS)-4,7-dimethyl-3a,4,7,7a-tetrahydro-4,7-epoxybenzo[c]thiophene-1,3-dione; Exo adduct: (3aR,4R,7S,7aS)-4,7-dimethyl-3a,4,7,7a-tetrahydro-4,7-epoxybenzo[c]thiophene-1,3-dione (major).\nCoT agent 3GRV, evaluating products, thinking: The major exo product from the thermal Diels–Alder of 2,5-dimethylthiophene with maleic anhydride is the epoxybenzo[c]thiophene-1,3-dione with configuration (3aR,4R,7S,7aS).
