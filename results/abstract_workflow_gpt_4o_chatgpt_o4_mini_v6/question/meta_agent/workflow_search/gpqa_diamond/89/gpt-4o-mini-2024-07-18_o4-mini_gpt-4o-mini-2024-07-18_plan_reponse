        "response": "The correct product arises from ozonolysis of the C4=C5 bond in 1-ethyl-2,3-dimethylcyclopent-4-en-1-one. Cleavage gives a linear pentane chain (former C4\u2013C3\u2013C2\u2013C1\u2013C5) with ketones at former C4 (new C1), the original C1 (new C4), and former C5 (new C5). The ethyl at C1 becomes a substituent at new C4, and the methyls at C2 and C3 become new C3 and new C2 substituents. Thus the product is 4-ethyl-2,3-dimethylpentane-1,4,5-trione.\n\nAnswer:4-ethyl-2,3-dimethylpentane-1,4,5-trione",
