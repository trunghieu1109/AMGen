Assuming LTE and using the EW method, astronomers have determined the elemental abundances of these two stars: [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex, and [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. Consider the following photospheric composition for the Sun: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 and 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7. Calculate the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2.\n",

These depend on the solar silicon abundance (12\u2009+\u2009log\u2081\u2080(nSi/nH)) to convert [Si/Fe]\u2081 and [Mg/Si]\u2082 into absolute nSi values. Since that solar Si abundance or the absolute nSi for one of the stars is missing, we cannot derive the ratio.\n\nAnswer:[TOO_HARD]\nPlease provide the solar silicon abundance (12 + log\u2081\u2080(nSi/nH) for the Sun) or an absolute nSi for at least one of the stars so we can compute the ratio.",
