For Star_2: nSi2 = nMg_star2/(nMg/nSi)_star2 = nSi_sun×10^-0.3.

From subtask 3: nSi₁ = nSi_sun *10^{0.3}. From subtask 4: nSi₂ = nSi_sun *10^{-0.3}.

Assuming nH=1 as the reference, nFe ≃ 3.16×10^−5.; answer: nFe/nH = 10^(7.5−12) = 10^(−4.5) ≃ 3.16×10^−5\nCoT agent ctX7, calculating nMg, thinking: We have 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7.5.
