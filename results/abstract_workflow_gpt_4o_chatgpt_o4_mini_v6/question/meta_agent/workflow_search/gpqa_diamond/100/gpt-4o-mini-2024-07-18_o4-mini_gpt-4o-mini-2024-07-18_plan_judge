Question: Example(question='A student performed an acid-catalyzed reaction of 3-methylpyrrolidine with compound A, the final product of the reaction is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. Select the suitable reagent (A) and catalyst (B) for the reaction.\n3-methylpyrrolidine + A (B, Heat, solvent) ---> 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine', choice1='A = vinylcyclohexane, B = TsOH', choice2='A = cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, B = TsOH', choice3='A = vinylcyclohexane, B = Acetic acid', choice4='A = cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, B = Acetic acid', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_100
proposed answer: Subtask 3 shows cyclohexanecarbaldehyde is required for imine formation with 3-methylpyrrolidine, and Subtask 4 indicates p-TsOH is the stronger, more effective acid catalyst. Combining these yields cyclohexanecarbaldehyde with TsOH as the optimal pair.
