Question: Example(question='A chemist performed two reactions by taking two unknown compounds and treated them separately with two different reducing agents. Select the proper starting material for both of the reactions.\nA + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\nB + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one', choice1='A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, B = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid', choice2='A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid , B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid', choice3='A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid , B = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid', choice4='A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_85
proposed answer: All logic threads agree that LiBH₄ reduction yields the (R)-lactone from the (R)-acid and BH₃ reduction yields the (S)-lactone from the (S)-acid, matching choice 4 (D).
