    <pre>Related original question:

{&#39;question&#39;: &#34;You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control’s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control’s resistance; 0% ‒ all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes&#39; interaction can you draw from this experiment?\n&#34;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3&#39;}. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 4: Evaluate the results of the analysis to draw conclusions about the roles of G1, G2, and G3, including identifying which gene is likely a transcription factor and how the other genes interact with it. 

 ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent DGcJ:
The complete loss of resistance in the g2 mutant and all double mutants containing g2 (g1g2, g2g3) indicates G2 functions upstream and is epistatic to G1 and G3. The partial losses in g1 (75%) and g3 (50%), with a strong loss in the g1g3 double (10%), reveal that G1 and G3 operate in parallel, partially redundant pathways downstream of G2.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent valg:
The g2 knockout and all double mutants containing g2 show complete loss of resistance, indicating G2 acts upstream and is epistatic. The partial resistance of g1 and g3 single mutants, but near-total loss in g1g3, implies G1 and G3 function in parallel, partially redundant pathways downstream of G2.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent Hc50:
The complete loss of resistance in the g2 single mutant and in all double mutants that include g2 indicates that G2 functions upstream of the other genes and is epistatic to G1 and G3. The partial resistance observed in g1 (75%) and g3 (50%), combined with the severe loss in the g1g3 double mutant (10%), shows that G1 and G3 act in parallel, partially redundant pathways downstream of G2. Therefore G2 is the likely transcription factor controlling expression of both G1 and G3.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent 6t49:
The complete loss of resistance in the g2 mutant and in all double mutants containing g2 indicates G2 acts upstream and is epistatic to both G1 and G3. The partial losses in g1 and g3 single mutants, combined with the near‐total loss in the g1g3 double mutant, show that G1 and G3 function in parallel, partially redundant pathways downstream of G2. Thus G2 is the transcription factor, epistatic to G1 and G3, and G1 and G3 act redundantly to confer resistance.

### answer #1 by Debate Agent DGcJ:
G2 is likely the transcription factor acting upstream, and is epistatic to both G1 and G3. G1 and G3 function downstream of G2 in parallel, partially redundant pathways contributing to anthracnose resistance.

### answer #1 by Debate Agent valg:
G2 is the transcription factor acting upstream and is epistatic to G1 and G3; G1 and G3 function in parallel, partially redundant pathways downstream of G2.

### answer #1 by Debate Agent Hc50:
G2 is likely the transcription factor acting upstream; it is epistatic to both G1 and G3 (its loss abolishes resistance). G1 and G3 function in parallel, partially redundant pathways downstream of G2.

### answer #1 by Debate Agent 6t49:
G2 is the transcription factor acting upstream (epistatic to G1 and G3); G1 and G3 function in parallel, partially redundant pathways downstream of G2.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Make final decision on gene interactions.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
