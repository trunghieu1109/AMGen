    <pre>Related original question:

{&#39;question&#39;: &#34;You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control’s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control’s resistance; 0% ‒ all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes&#39; interaction can you draw from this experiment?\n&#34;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3&#39;}.

### Sub-task 3: Evaluate the interactions between the genes based on the resistance data, focusing on identifying potential epistatic relationships and redundancy among the genes. 

 ### thinking by Debate Agent xHe8:
The mutants g2, g1g2, and g2g3 all show 0% resistance, indicating loss of function of G2 abolishes resistance regardless of G1 or G3 status. This means G2 acts upstream (epistatic) to both G1 and G3. Single g1 and g3 mutants retain partial resistance and the g1g3 double mutant shows a more severe phenotype than either single, indicating G1 and G3 contribute additively and have partial redundancy.

### thinking by Debate Agent EazU:
The data show that knocking out G2 abolishes resistance entirely (g2, g1g2, g2g3 all 0%), indicating G2 acts upstream and is epistatic to both G1 and G3 (likely the transcription factor). G1 and G3 single mutants retain partial resistance (75%, 50%), but the g1g3 double mutant drops to nearly zero (10%), revealing functional redundancy between G1 and G3.

### thinking by Debate Agent tUVo:
The complete loss of resistance in g2, g1g2, and g2g3 indicates G2 acts upstream (epistatic) of both G1 and G3. The partial resistance of g1 (75%) and g3 (50%), but severe drop in g1g3 (10%), shows G1 and G3 function in parallel (redundant) pathways. Thus G2 is epistatic to and likely regulates G1 and G3, which are redundant.

### thinking by Debate Agent 8b1F:
Based on the data, g2 alone gives 0% resistance and both g1g2 and g2g3 also give 0%, so G2’s mutation masks the effects of G1 and G3 (G2 is epistatic to both). g1 and g3 individually give partial loss (75% and 50%), but the double mutant g1g3 gives a severe loss (10%), indicating overlapping (redundant) roles in resistance.

### answer by Debate Agent xHe8:
G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3 (acts upstream, likely a transcription factor); G1 and G3 have partially redundant/additive roles in resistance.

### answer by Debate Agent EazU:
G2 acts as the upstream transcription factor and is epistatic to both G1 and G3; G1 and G3 function redundantly downstream of G2.

### answer by Debate Agent tUVo:
G1 and G3 show functional redundancy; G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, acting upstream

### answer by Debate Agent 8b1F:
G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3; G1 and G3 act redundantly

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 3: Make a final decision on the gene interactions based on the resistance data.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>The complete loss of resistance in g2, g1g2, and g2g3 mutants indicates G2 acts upstream and is epistatic to both G1 and G3. The partial resistance in g1 and g3 single mutants, coupled with the near-complete loss in the g1g3 double mutant, shows that G1 and G3 function redundantly downstream of G2.

Answer:G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3 (acts upstream, likely as a transcription factor); G1 and G3 function redundantly downstream of G2.</pre>
