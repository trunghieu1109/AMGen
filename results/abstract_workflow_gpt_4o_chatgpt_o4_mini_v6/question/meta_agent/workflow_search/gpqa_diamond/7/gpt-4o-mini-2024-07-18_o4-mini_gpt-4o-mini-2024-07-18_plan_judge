Question: Example(question="You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control’s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control’s resistance; 0% ‒ all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?\n", choice1='G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3', choice2='G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1', choice3='G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1', choice4='G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3', correct_index=0)

proposed answer: The g2 knockout and all double mutants containing g2 show complete loss of resistance, indicating G2 functions upstream and is epistatic to G1 and G3. The partial resistance of g1 and g3 single mutants, but near-total loss in the g1g3 double, implies G1 and G3 operate in parallel, partially redundant pathways downstream of G2.

Answer:G2 is the transcription factor acting upstream and is epistatic to both G1 and G3; G1 and G3 function in parallel, partially redundant pathways downstream of G2.
Extracted answer: G2 is the transcription factor acting upstream and is epistatic to both G1 and G3; G1 and G3 function in parallel, partially redundant pathways downstream of G2.

proposed answer: The complete loss of resistance in g2, g1g2, and g2g3 mutants indicates G2 acts upstream and is epistatic to both G1 and G3. The partial resistance in g1 and g3 single mutants, coupled with the near-complete loss in the g1g3 double mutant, shows that G1 and G3 function redundantly downstream of G2.

Answer:G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3 (acts upstream, likely as a transcription factor); G1 and G3 function redundantly downstream of G2.
