This means G2 acts upstream (epistatic) to both G1 and G3. Single g1 and g3 mutants retain partial resistance and the g1g3 double mutant shows a more severe phenotype than either single, indicating G1 and G3 contribute additively and have partial redundancy.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent EazU:\nThe data show that knocking out G2 abolishes resistance entirely (g2, g1g2, g2g3 all 0%), indicating G2 acts upstream and is epistatic to both G1 and G3 (likely the transcription factor). G1 and G3 single mutants retain partial resistance (75%, 50%), but the g1g3 double mutant drops to nearly zero (10%), revealing functional redundancy between G1 and G3.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent tUVo:\nThe complete loss of resistance in g2, g1g2, and g2g3 indicates G2 acts upstream (epistatic) of both G1 and G3. The partial resistance of g1 (75%) and g3 (50%), but severe drop in g1g3 (10%), shows G1 and G3 function in parallel (redundant) pathways. Thus G2 is epistatic to and likely regulates G1 and G3, which are redundant.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent 8b1F:\nBased on the data, g2 alone gives 0% resistance and both g1g2 and g2g3 also give 0%, so G2’s mutation masks the effects of G1 and G3 (G2 is epistatic to both). g1 and g3 individually give partial loss (75% and 50%), but the double mutant g1g3 gives a severe loss (10%), indicating overlapping (redundant) roles in resistance.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent xHe8:\nG2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3 (acts upstream, likely a transcription factor); G1 and G3 have partially redundant/additive roles in resistance.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent EazU:\nG2 acts as the upstream transcription factor and is epistatic to both G1 and G3; G1 and G3 function redundantly downstream of G2.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent tUVo:\nG1 and G3 show functional redundancy; G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, acting upstream\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 8b1F:\nG2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3; G1 and G3 act redundantly\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 3: Make a final decision on the gene interactions based on the resistance data.\n\nIf the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the "answer" entry and justify why you think so in the "thinking" entry'}], sub_tasks=None, agents='CoT agent yF88, analyzing resistance levels, thinking: We compare each mutant’s resistance level to wild-type (100%). g1 at 75% indicates G1 contributes partially; g3 at 50% indicates G3 has a stronger partial contribution; g2 at 0% indicates G2 is essential for any resistance. The double mutant g1g3 at 10% shows an additive or synergistic effect of losing both partial contributors, while g1g2 and g2g3 both at 0% mirror the g2 single mutant, reinforcing G2’s essential role.; answer: g1: 75% resistance → G1 contributes moderately to resistance\ng2: 0% resistance → G2 is essential for resistance\ng3: 50% resistance → G3 contributes substantially but not completely\ng1g3: 10% resistance → combined loss of both partial contributors has an additive/synergistic effect\ng1g2: 0% resistance → reflects the essential nature of G2\ng2g3: 0% resistance → reflects the essential nature of G2\nReflexion CoT agent MOxJ, identifying resistance levels, thinking: We categorize mutants based on their resistance levels: 0% indicates complete loss of resistance; any value between 0% and 100% indicates partial resistance. From the data: g2 = 0%, g1g2 = 0%, g2g3 = 0% ⇒ complete loss. g1 = 75%, g3 = 50%, g1g3 = 10% ⇒ partial resistance.; answer: Complete loss: g2, g1g2, g2g3; Partial resistance: g1, g3, g1g3\nCritic agent OmFh, providing feedback, thinking: The simple binary classification based solely on 0% versus >0% resistance is clear but has several limitations:\n1. Lack of Replication and Statistical Support: No error bars or replicate data are provided, so we cannot assess whether differences (e.g. 10% vs 0%) are statistically significant or within experimental noise.\n2. Arbitrary Thresholds: Defining ‘complete loss’ strictly at 0% does not account for low but nonzero background resistance or measurement limits.\n3. Phenotyping Bias: Scoring disease resistance by percent of control may be subjective without a standardized scoring rubric or blinded assessment.\n4. Dynamic Range and Sensitivity: The assay’s dynamic range isn’t specified; small differences may reflect assay sensitivity rather than biology.\n5. Temporal Resolution: A single timepoint may miss transient resistance or delayed symptoms.\n6. Genetic Background and Off-Target Effects: Knockouts could have unintended pleiotropic effects or compensation by other genes, skewing resistance levels.\n7. Environmental Variation: Growth conditions, inoculum concentration, and microenvironmental factors can influence infection severity but aren’t described.\n\nOverall, while the categorization is a useful starting point, robust conclusions require replicates with statistical analysis, clear scoring criteria, and controls for environmental and genetic background effects.; answer: Complete loss: g2, g1g2, g2g3; Partial resistance: g1, g3, g1g3\nReflexion CoT agent MOxJ, refining identification of resistance levels, thinking: We categorize mutants based on their reported resistance levels: those at 0% show complete loss of resistance, while those between 0% and 100% show partial resistance.; answer: Complete loss: g2, g1g2, g2g3; Partial resistance: g1, g3, g1g3\nDebate agent xHe8, round 0, evaluating gene interactions, thinking: The mutants g2, g1g2, and g2g3 all show 0% resistance, indicating loss of function of G2 abolishes resistance regardless of G1 or G3 status.
