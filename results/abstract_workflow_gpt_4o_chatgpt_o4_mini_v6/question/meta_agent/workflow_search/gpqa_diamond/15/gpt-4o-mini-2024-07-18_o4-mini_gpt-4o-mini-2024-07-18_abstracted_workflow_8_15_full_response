None of the data is missing for this subtask, so a direct description suffices.; answer: 1) (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: no sp3 carbon with four different substituents (only an sp2 alkene), no chiral centers, achiral.\n\n2) (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: two defined stereocenters (3aR,7aS) and a fixed E-double bond; lacks an internal mirror plane; chiral and optically active.\n\n3) (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: two stereocenters of opposite configuration; molecule is meso (has an internal mirror plane), overall achiral.\n\n4) (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: two stereocenters of same configuration; no internal mirror plane; chiral and optically active.\n\n5) (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: one sp3 stereocenter at C-1 bearing OH, no compensating symmetry; chiral and optically active.\n\n6) (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: three stereocenters but the all-cis 1,3,5 arrangement gives a mirror plane through the ring; overall meso and achiral.\n\n7) 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: one sp3 carbon at C-3 bearing methyl, ethyl, CH2CO-cyclopentyl and H; no symmetry; chiral center present, optically active.\nCoT agent bm0K, determining chiral centers and symmetry, thinking: We identified each compound’s stereogenic (sp3) centers and checked for internal symmetry (mirror planes) determining meso vs chiral.
