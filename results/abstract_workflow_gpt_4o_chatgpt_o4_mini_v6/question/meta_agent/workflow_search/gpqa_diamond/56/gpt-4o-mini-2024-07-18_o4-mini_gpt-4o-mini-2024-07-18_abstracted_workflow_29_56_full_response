Each degree value is multiplied by π/180.; answer: δ₀ = 90° = π/2 ≈ 1.5708 rad\nδ₁ = 67° = 67·π/180 ≈ 1.1694 rad\nδ₂ = 55° = 55·π/180 ≈ 0.9599 rad\nδ₃ = 30° = 30·π/180 = π/6 ≈ 0.5236 rad\nδ₄ = 13° = 13·π/180 ≈ 0.2269 rad\nCoT agent 0Q2M, identifying principles, thinking: To relate phase shifts to the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude, one uses the partial-wave expansion of the scattering amplitude and the optical theorem. In partial waves, f(θ)=(1/2ik)∑_{l=0}^∞(2l+1)(e^{2iδ_l}−1)P_l(cosθ). At θ=0, P_l(1)=1, and the imaginary part follows from Im[(e^{2iδ_l}−1)/(2i)]=(sin²δ_l). Equivalently, using f(0)=(1/k)∑(2l+1)e^{iδ_l}sinδ_l gives Im\u2009f(0)=(1/k)∑(2l+1)sin²δ_l.; answer: Relevant principles: 1) Partial-wave expansion of scattering amplitude, 2) Optical theorem. Key equations:\n\nf(θ) = (1/2ik) ∑_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) [e^{2iδ_l} − 1] P_l(cosθ)\nFor forward scattering (θ=0):\nIm\u2009f(0) = (1/k) ∑_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) sin²δ_l\nCoT agent dcoZ, calculating total phase shift, thinking: To find the total phase shift needed for the scattering amplitude, we sum the individual δₗ. Converting each to radians (as found earlier) and adding gives δ_total.; answer: The total phase shift δ_total = δ₀+δ₁+δ₂+δ₃+δ₄ = 90°+67°+55°+30°+13° = 255° ≈ 4.4506 rad.\nCoT agent v1tS, computing imaginary part of scattering amplitude, thinking: To compute Im\u2009f(0) one needs the partial‐wave expansion: Im\u2009f(0) = (1/k)∑ₗ(2l+1)sin²δₗ.
