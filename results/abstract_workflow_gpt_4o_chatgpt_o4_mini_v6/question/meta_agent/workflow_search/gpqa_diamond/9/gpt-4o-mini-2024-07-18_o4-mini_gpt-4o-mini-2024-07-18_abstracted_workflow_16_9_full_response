For options with Earth's composition (ρ≈5.51\u2009g/cm³), R scales as M^(1/3). For the explicit ρ≈5.5\u2009g/cm³ case, same calculation applies.; answer: Option a: mass = 1 Earth mass, radius = 1 Earth radius\nOption b: mass = 2 Earth masses, radius ≈ (2)^(1/3) ≈ 1.26 Earth radii\nOption c: mass = 5 Earth masses, radius ≈ (5)^(1/3) ≈ 1.71 Earth radii\nOption d: mass = 0.5 Earth masses, radius ≈ (0.5)^(1/3) ≈ 0.79 Earth radii\nCoT agent EQ5I, summarizing findings, thinking: All four exoplanets share the same density (~5.5 g/cm³), so no individual planet stands out as having a higher density than the others.; answer: All options (a, b, c, d) have equal density (~5.5 g/cm³), so no planet has the highest density.", iteration_idx=-1)]
