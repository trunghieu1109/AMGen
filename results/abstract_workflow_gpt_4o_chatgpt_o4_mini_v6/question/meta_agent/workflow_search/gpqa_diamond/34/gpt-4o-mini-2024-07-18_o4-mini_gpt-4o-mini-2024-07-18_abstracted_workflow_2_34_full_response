S is one of the Pauli matrices (σ_y), which is Hermitian and squares to the identity. Therefore its eigenvalues are ±1. Multiplying by c shifts these to ±c = ±h/(4π). The eigenvalue problem (cS – λI)φ = 0 then gives λ = ±h/(4π) and corresponding normalized eigenvectors (1/√2)(1,±i)^T.; answer: Sub-task 1 Answer: Ay = (h/4π)·σ_y. Since σ_y is Hermitian with σ_y^2 = I, its eigenvalues are ±1. Hence Ay has eigenvalues λ = ±h/4π. The normalized eigenvectors (eigenfunctions) of Ay are φ_+ = (1/√2)(1, i)^T for λ = +h/4π and φ_– = (1/√2)(1, –i)^T for λ = –h/4π.\nCoT-SC agent 8VMI, identifying eigenvalue equation, thinking: We need to state the eigenvalue equation Ay\u2009φ = a\u2009φ and explain that φ is the nonzero vector (spinor) that is mapped to a scalar multiple of itself by Ay, and a is that scalar (the measured spin‐y component). This is standard linear algebra for Hermitian operators in a two‐dimensional spin space.; answer: The eigenvalue equation is\nAy\u2009φ = a\u2009φ\nwhere Ay = (h/4π)·σy. Here φ is an eigenfunction (a 2-component spinor) on which the operator acts, and a is the corresponding eigenvalue (a scalar), giving the allowed outcomes of a spin‐y measurement. Specifically, φ₊ and φ₋ are the nonzero solutions (eigenvectors) satisfying Ay\u2009φ₊ = (+h/4π)\u2009φ₊ and Ay\u2009φ₋ = (–h/4π)\u2009φ₋, so φ labels the spin state and a labels its spin‐angular‐momentum projection along y.\nCoT-SC agent t30D, identifying eigenvalue equation, thinking: The question asks to write down the eigenvalue equation for Ay and explain the meaning of φ and a in that equation, which follows directly from the definition of an eigenvalue problem for a linear operator.; answer: The eigenvalue equation for the operator Ay is\nAy\u2009φ = a\u2009φ\nHere, φ is the eigenfunction (eigenspinor) of Ay—a two-component spinor that, when acted on by Ay, returns the same spinor up to a scalar factor. The scalar a is the eigenvalue, representing the measurable value of the y-component of intrinsic angular momentum for that eigenfunction (in this case a = +h/4π or –h/4π).\nCoT-SC agent nPT9, identifying eigenvalue equation, thinking: The question asks to state the eigenvalue equation Ay(φ)=a(φ) and explain what φ and a represent. This follows directly from the definition of eigenvalue problems in linear algebra: φ is an eigenvector (eigenfunction) and a is its eigenvalue under Ay.; answer: The eigenvalue equation is Ay\u2009φ\u2009=\u2009a\u2009φ. Here φ is an eigenfunction (a two‐component spinor) of the operator Ay, and a is the corresponding eigenvalue (the measured value of the y–component of intrinsic angular momentum). Specifically, Ayφ₊=+(h/4π)φ₊ and Ayφ₋=−(h/4π)φ₋, where φ₊=(1/√2)(1,i)^T and φ₋=(1/√2)(1,−i)^T.\nCoT agent HGnf, evaluating matrix S, thinking: The matrix S given by rows (0, –i) and (i, 0) is the Pauli σ_y matrix, which is Hermitian and satisfies σ_y^2 = I. Hence its eigenvalues are ±1. Multiplying by the constant c = h/(4π) gives Ay eigenvalues ±h/(4π). The eigenvectors follow from solving (σ_y – λ/c)φ = 0, yielding normalized forms (1/√2)(1, ±i)^T.; answer: Sub-task 3 Answer: The matrix S is the Pauli-y matrix, S = [[0, –i], [i, 0]], which is Hermitian and squares to the identity. Therefore S has eigenvalues ±1. Since Ay = (h/4π)·S, the eigenvalues of Ay are λ = ±h/(4π). The corresponding normalized eigenvectors of Ay are φ_+ = (1/√2)(1, i)^T for λ = +h/(4π) and φ_– = (1/√2)(1, –i)^T for λ = –h/(4π).\nCoT agent GNTj, reviewing angular momentum properties, thinking: The muon is a spin-½ particle, so each component of its intrinsic angular momentum operator has eigenvalues ±ħ/2. The operators satisfy the usual commutation relations [S_i,S_j]=iħε_{ijk}S_k. For Ay=c·S with c=h/4π=ħ/2, the eigenvalue problem Ayφ= aφ yields a=±ħ/2 and two orthonormal spinors φ₊,φ₋. This directly reflects the physical fact that a spin-½ measurement along any axis can only give ±ħ/2.; answer: For a spin-½ muon, the y–component operator Ay has eigenvalues a=±ħ/2, with eigenfunctions φ₊=(1/√2)(1,i)^T and φ₋=(1/√2)(1,−i)^T reflecting the two possible measured spin projections along y.\nDebate agent w5gp, round 0, calculating eigenvalues, thinking: Matrix S has eigenvalues ±1.
