{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Consider the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, A of a muon be represented by a 2×2 matrix Ay satisfying the eigenvalue equation Ay(φ) = a(φ). Here, a is the eigenvalue, φ is the eigenfunction. The matrix operator has the form Ay = c∙S; where the constant c=h/4π and S being a 2×2 matrix. The first row of the matrix S is (0   -i) and the second row is (i  0). You are asked to calculate the eigenvalue and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. During the calculation, which statement below will you consider to be correct? &#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A^2, but not of the Z-component, Az.&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;The imaginary part of the eigenvalue of Ay are +1/2 or –1/2, and the real part of that are +1 or –1. &#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;The imaginary part of the eigenvalue of Ay are +2πh or –2πh, and the real part of that are +h/4π or –h/4π. &#39;}.

### Sub-task 5: Calculate the eigenvalues of the operator Ay using the eigenvalue equation and the structure of the matrix S. 

 ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent w5gp:
Matrix S has eigenvalues ±1. Since Ay = (h/4π)·S = ħ/2 · S, its eigenvalues are (h/4π)·(±1) = ±h/4π = ±ħ/2.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent c1QK:
The matrix S given is the Pauli-y matrix with eigenvalues ±1. Since Ay = c·S with c = h/4π, its eigenvalues are c·(±1) = ±h/4π, which is equivalent to ±ħ/2.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent CqKR:
The matrix S=[[0,-i],[i,0]] has eigenvalues ±1. Since Ay=c·S with c=h/4π, its eigenvalues are ±c=±h/4π (i.e. ±ħ/2).

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent XkMQ:
The operator Ay=c·S with c=h/4π=ħ/2 and S=[[0,-i],[i,0]] has eigenvalues ±1 for S; thus Ay’s eigenvalues are c·(±1)=±ħ/2.

### answer #1 by Debate Agent w5gp:
The eigenvalues of Ay are +ħ/2 and –ħ/2.

### answer #1 by Debate Agent c1QK:
The eigenvalues of Ay are +h/4π and –h/4π (i.e. ±ħ/2).

### answer #1 by Debate Agent CqKR:
Eigenvalues of Ay are +h/4π and –h/4π (equivalently ±ħ/2).

### answer #1 by Debate Agent XkMQ:
The eigenvalues of Ay are +ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 5: Make final decision on the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of Ay.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
