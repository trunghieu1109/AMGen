{&#39;question&#39;: &#34;Astronomers are studying a star with a 1.5 solar radius and 1.1 solar masses. When the star&#39;s surface is not covered by dark spots, its Teff is 6000K. However, when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. In the stellar photosphere, when examining the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2), astronomers have observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. What is the factor by which this ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots? Note that the transition between the energy levels under consideration corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 1448 Å. Assume that the stellar photosphere is in LTE.&#34;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;~2.9&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;~4.5&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;~7.8&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;~1.1&#39;}.

### Sub-task 4: Calculate the factor by which the ratio of neutral Ti atoms changes when the star has spots compared to when it does not have spots. 

 ### thinking by Debate Agent BuOd:
We compute the ratio of level populations under LTE: (n2/n1)_no_spots/(n2/n1)_spots = exp[-ΔE/k (1/T_no - 1/T_spot)]. With ΔE = hc/λ ≃8.57 eV and T_no =6000 K, T_spot =5500 K, we get exponent = 8.57 eV/(8.617×10^-5 eV K^-1)×(1/5500–1/6000) ≃1.507, so factor ≃exp(1.507) ≃4.5.

### thinking by Debate Agent Ocdo:
Under LTE the ratio n₂/n₁ ∝ exp(−ΔE/(kT)), so the factor = exp[−ΔE/k*(1/6000−1/5500)]⁻¹ = exp[ΔE/k*(1/5500−1/6000)]. With ΔE≈8.56 eV and k≈8.617×10⁻⁵ eV/K: exponent ≃(8.56/8.617e−5)*(1/5500−1/6000) ≃1.506, so factor ≃e^{1.506} ≃4.5.

### thinking by Debate Agent 1Vqa:
Under LTE the level‐population ratio is n₂/n₁∝exp(−ΔE/(kT)), so the ratio change factor is exp[−ΔE/k·(1/6000−1/5500)] with ΔE≃8.56 eV.  Evaluating gives exp(1.5)≃4.5, independent of g₂/g₁.

### thinking by Debate Agent q5Ie:
We need the factor by which the level‐population ratio n₂/n₁ changes from no spots (T=6000 K) to spots (T=5500 K). Under LTE and Boltzmann’s law, n₂/n₁∝exp(−ΔE/kT), so the degeneracy ratio g₂/g₁ cancels in the ratio of two states: ratio = exp[−ΔE/k·(1/T₁−1/T₂)] = exp[ΔE/k·(1/5500−1/6000)]. With ΔE≃8.56 eV and k=8.617×10⁻⁵ eV/K, ΔE/k≃9.94×10⁴ K. Then (1/5500−1/6000)=500/(5500·6000)≃1.515×10⁻⁵ K⁻¹ so exponent ≃1.506 yielding exp(1.506)≃4.51.
