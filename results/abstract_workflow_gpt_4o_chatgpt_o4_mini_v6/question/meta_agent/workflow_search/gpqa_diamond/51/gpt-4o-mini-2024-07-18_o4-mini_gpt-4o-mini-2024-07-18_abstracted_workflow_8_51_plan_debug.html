    <pre>Related original question:

{&#39;question&#39;: &#34;Astronomers are studying a star with a 1.5 solar radius and 1.1 solar masses. When the star&#39;s surface is not covered by dark spots, its Teff is 6000K. However, when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. In the stellar photosphere, when examining the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2), astronomers have observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. What is the factor by which this ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots? Note that the transition between the energy levels under consideration corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 1448 Å. Assume that the stellar photosphere is in LTE.&#34;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;~2.9&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;~4.5&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;~7.8&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;~1.1&#39;}.

### Sub-task 4: Analyze the computed ratio change to determine the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots. 

 ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent J809:
Using the Boltzmann distribution under LTE, the ratio n2/n1 at 6000 K is ≃6.4×10⁻⁸ and at 5500 K is ≃1.4×10⁻⁸. Dividing gives a factor ≃4.6, corresponding to choice ~4.5.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent rQA2:
From Sub-task 3 we have n2/n1 ≃6.4×10⁻⁸ at 6000 K (no spots) and ≃1.4×10⁻⁸ at 5500 K (with spots). Dividing gives 6.4×10⁻⁸/1.4×10⁻⁸≃4.6, so the ratio is about 4.6 times larger without spots.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent Mz60:
Using the Boltzmann distribution under LTE, we found n2/n1 ≃6.4×10⁻⁸ at 6000 K and ≃1.4×10⁻⁸ at 5500 K. The ratio of these two populations (6.4×10⁻⁸/1.4×10⁻⁸) is ≃4.6, which corresponds to choice ~4.5.

### thinking #1 by Debate Agent EAzz:
Using the Boltzmann equation under LTE, we computed n2/n1 ≃6.4×10⁻⁸ at 6000 K (unspotted) and ≃1.4×10⁻⁸ at 5500 K (spotted). Dividing these gives 6.4×10⁻⁸ / 1.4×10⁻⁸ ≃ 4.6.

### answer #1 by Debate Agent J809:
B)

### answer #1 by Debate Agent rQA2:
The ratio changes by a factor of about 4.6 when comparing the unspotted star to the spotted star.

### answer #1 by Debate Agent Mz60:
B)

### answer #1 by Debate Agent EAzz:
~4.6

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Make final decision on the factor of ratio change.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
