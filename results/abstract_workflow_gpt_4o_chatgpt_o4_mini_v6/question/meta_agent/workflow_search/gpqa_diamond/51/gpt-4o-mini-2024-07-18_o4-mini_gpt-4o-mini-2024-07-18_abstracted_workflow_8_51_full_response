Assuming g2/g1≈1 and ΔE=hc/λ with λ=1448Å → ΔE≈8.56eV. Using k_B=8.617e-5eV/K gives ΔE/k≈99355\u2009K. Thus at T=6000\u2009K: n2/n1≈exp(-99355/6000)=exp(-16.56)≈6.4×10^-8. At T=5500\u2009K: exp(-99355/5500)=exp(-18.07)≈1.4×10^-8.; answer: Sub-task 2: For the star without spots (T=6000\u2009K): n2/n1 ≈6.4×10^-8; For the star with spots (T=5500\u2009K): n2/n1 ≈1.4×10^-8\nCoT-SC agent oicI, determining Ti atom ratio, thinking: To compute the level‐population ratio we need the Boltzmann factor R = (g₂/g₁)\u2009exp(–ΔE/(kT)). The energy difference ΔE = hc/λ ≃ 8.56\u2009eV. We don’t know the statistical weights g₂/g₁, so we can only give the ratio assuming g₂/g₁=1. Without that, precise values aren’t possible.; answer: At 6000\u2009K: R₁₂ ≃ exp(–8.56\u2009eV/(k·6000\u2009K)) ≃ exp(–8.56/0.517) ≃ 6.4×10⁻⁸\nAt 5500\u2009K: R₁₂ ≃ exp(–8.56\u2009eV/(k·5500\u2009K)) ≃ exp(–8.56/0.473) ≃ 1.4×10⁻⁸\n[TOO_HARD]\nNeed the statistical weights g₂/g₁ to compute the exact ratios.\nCoT-SC agent KTMC, determining Ti atom ratio, thinking: We use the Boltzmann equation in LTE: n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp(–ΔE/kT). The energy gap ΔE = hc/λ with λ=1448\u2009Å ⇒ ΔE≈8.56\u2009eV. kT in eV =8.617×10⁻⁵\u2009eV/K×T. For T=6000\u2009K, kT≈0.517\u2009eV ⇒ n2/n1≈exp(–8.56/0.517)≈6.4×10⁻⁸.

The change factor comparing no‐spot to spot case is 6.4×10^−8 / 1.4×10^−8≈4.57, i.e. ≃4.6.; answer: Sub-task 3: The ratio of neutral Ti atoms in the two levels is about 4.6 times larger in the unspotted star than in the spotted star.\nCritic agent OZre, providing feedback, thinking: The computed change–a factor of about 4.6–correctly reflects the Boltzmann‐Saha population shift between 6000 K and 5500 K under LTE. However, this estimate rests on simplified assumptions: 1) strict LTE may not hold in a real photosphere, especially in cooler spot regions; 2) the model assumes uniform spot temperature and coverage, while real spots have temperature gradients and complex geometry; 3) non‐LTE effects, magnetic fields, and line‐blending can all modify the true level populations and observed line strengths; 4) uncertainties in atomic transition probabilities and ionization potentials propagate into the ratio. Thus, the factor ~4.6 should be taken as a rough order‐of‐magnitude indicator rather than a definitive value.; answer: The ratio of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels is about 4.6 times larger in the unspotted photosphere than in the spotted photosphere.\nReflexion CoT agent qiaA, refining change in Ti atom ratio, thinking: Using the Boltzmann equation under LTE, we found n2/n1 ≃6.4×10⁻⁸ at 6000 K and ≃1.4×10⁻⁸ at 5500 K.
