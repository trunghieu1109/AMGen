Question: Example(question='You have prepared an unknown compound. To identify the product, you have used the following characterisation techniques: FTIR and 1H NMR. The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers. A strong absorption peak is also observed at 1700 wavenumbers. Several peaks were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum, none of which are correspond to vinyl-hydrogens. One of the signals in the 1H NMR is a doublet of triplets of quartets whilst a different signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Identify the compound as either, CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH, CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH, CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH, or CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH', choice1='CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH', choice2='CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH', choice3='CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH', choice4='CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: FTIR indicates a carboxylic acid (broad O–H stretch ~3000 cm⁻¹, strong C=O at ~1700 cm⁻¹). ¹H NMR shows two distinct methine (CH) signals: one as a doublet of triplets of quartets (coupled to CH, CH₂, CH₃) and another as a doublet of triplets of triplets (coupled to CH, two CH₂). Only CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH (choice C) has two inequivalent CH centers with those exact neighboring groups.
