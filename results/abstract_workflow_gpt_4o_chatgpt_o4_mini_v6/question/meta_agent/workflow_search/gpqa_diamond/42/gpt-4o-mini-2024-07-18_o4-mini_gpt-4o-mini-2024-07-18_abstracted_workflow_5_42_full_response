Hydroxyl and dimethylamino are ortho to the carboxylic acid. Methoxy is para to the carboxylic acid. Both methoxy and hydroxyl are ortho to the cyano group.\nCoT-SC agent GL6F, classifying features, thinking: The carboxylic acid is chosen as C-1. The carbaldehyde and cyano are at C-3 and C-5 so that all three are mutually meta. Ortho to C-1 are C-2 and C-6; these carry the dimethylamino and hydroxyl groups, respectively. Para to C-1 is C-4, bearing the methoxy. The cyano at C-5 has ortho positions C-4 and C-6, consistent with methoxy and hydroxyl there.; answer: Functional group positions on the benzene ring (COOH as C-1):\n- C-1: carboxylic acid\n- C-2: dimethylamino (ortho to COOH)\n- C-3: carbaldehyde (meta to COOH and CN)\n- C-4: methoxy (para to COOH; ortho to CN)\n- C-5: cyano (meta to COOH and CHO)\n- C-6: hydroxyl (ortho to COOH; ortho to CN)\nKey relationships:\n- COOH, CHO, CN are mutually meta.\n- OH and NMe2 are ortho to COOH.\n- OMe is para to COOH.\n- OMe and OH are ortho to CN.\nCoT-SC agent 5tKM, classifying features, thinking: I assigned the carboxylic acid as the principal group at position 1. Using lowest locants, I placed the ortho, meta, and para substituents accordingly and noted their mutual relationships.; answer: Carboxylic acid at C-1; hydroxyl at C-2 (ortho to COOH and ortho to cyano); formyl at C-3 (meta to COOH); methoxy at C-4 (para to COOH and ortho to cyano); cyano at C-5 (meta to COOH); dimethylamino at C-6 (ortho to COOH).\nCoT-SC agent fkpq, classifying features, thinking: Assigning the carboxylic acid as position 1 gives a clear numbering. The three meta relationships (COOH–CHO–CN) place CHO at 5 and CN at 3. Ortho to COOH are positions 2 and 6, and para is position 4. Additional ortho relationships to the nitrile (at 3) fix OH at 2 and OMe at 4, leaving NMe2 at 6.; answer: COOH at C-1; OH at C-2 (ortho to COOH and ortho to CN); CN at C-3 (meta to COOH and CHO); OMe at C-4 (para to COOH and ortho to CN); CHO at C-5 (meta to COOH and CN); NMe2 at C-6 (ortho to COOH, meta to CN).\nCoT agent Rhmf, numbering benzene ring, thinking: According to IUPAC the carboxyl group is highest priority and assigned C-1. Then proceeding around the ring to give the lowest set of locants to substituents: dimethylamino at C-2, formyl at C-3, methoxy at C-4, cyano at C-5, and hydroxy at C-6.; answer: Numbering of the benzene ring:\nC-1: –COOH\nC-2: –N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)\nC-3: –CHO (formyl)\nC-4: –OCH3 (methoxy)\nC-5: –CN (cyano)\nC-6: –OH (hydroxy)\nDebate agent dDIA, round 0, generating IUPAC names, thinking: According to IUPAC the carboxyl is C-1. The substituents at C-2 through C-6 are dimethylamino, formyl, methoxy, cyano and hydroxy. Substituents are listed alphabetically (ignoring multiplicative prefixes) to give the preferred name.; answer: Potential IUPAC names:\n1) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid\n2) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid\nDebate agent pMgk, round 0, generating IUPAC names, thinking: Based on IUPAC rules the carboxyl is C-1. The substituents at C-2 (N,N-dimethylamino), C-3 (formyl), C-4 (methoxy), C-5 (cyano) and C-6 (hydroxy) give the following parent name. Substituents should be cited in alphabetical order when writing the preferred name.; answer: Potential IUPAC names:\n1) 2-(Dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid\n2) Preferred (alphabetical citation): 5-Cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid\nDebate agent sBmO, round 0, generating IUPAC names, thinking: We use benzoic acid as the parent (COOH at C-1) and assign C-2 N,N-dimethylamino, C-3 formyl, C-4 methoxy, C-5 cyano, C-6 hydroxy. IUPAC rules require substituents listed alphabetically (cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy), giving 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid. An alternate (non-alphabetical) locant-ordered listing also exists.; answer: Potential IUPAC names:\n1) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid\n2) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid\nDebate agent qDXP, round 0, generating IUPAC names, thinking: The carboxylic acid is C-1 (suffix), with substituents at C-2 N,N-dimethylamino, C-3 formyl, C-4 methoxy, C-5 cyano, C-6 hydroxy. IUPAC names list prefixes alphabetically ignoring multiplier prefixes. Thus treat cyano (C), dimethylamino (D), formyl (F), hydroxy (H), methoxy (M) to give the single correct systematic name.; answer: 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid\nFinal Decision agent on generating IUPAC names, thinking: According to IUPAC rules the parent is benzoic acid with COOH at C-1.
