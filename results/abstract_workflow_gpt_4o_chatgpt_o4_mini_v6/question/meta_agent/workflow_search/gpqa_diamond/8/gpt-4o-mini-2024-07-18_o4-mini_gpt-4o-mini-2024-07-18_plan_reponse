        "response": "To confirm C3h symmetry one needs to generate realistic 3D geometries and run a point\u2010group analysis. Triisopropyl borate is the only candidate flagged as C3h in Sub\u2010task 2, so the workflow focuses on it.\n\nAnswer:1. Build or retrieve a 3D model of triisopropyl borate (e.g. in GaussView or Avogadro).\n2. Optimize its geometry with a quantum\u2010chemistry package (e.g. DFT/B3LYP with a suitable basis set).\n3. Use the software\u2019s point\u2010group determination tool: it should identify a C3 principal axis through B and three equivalent O\u2013C axes, plus a horizontal \u03c3h plane through the oxygens.\n4. Visually inspect the optimized structure to verify three identical isopropyl groups spaced at 120\u00b0 around boron and lying symmetrically above/below the BO3 plane.\n\nConclusion: Triisopropyl borate is confirmed to belong to point group C3h.",
