Triisopropyl borate is trigonal at B but its bulky isopropyl groups are not in a common plane, so no σh (point group C3). Quinuclidine is a bicyclic amine with no C3 axis (point group C2 or lower). The two hexaone-fused macrocycles derive from triply fused rings. The triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran hexaone retains all dihedral vertical mirrors of triphenylene, giving D3h, not just C3h. In contrast, benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran hexaone lacks those vertical mirror planes but retains the threefold axis and a horizontal plane through the ring system, yielding C3h symmetry.; answer: Choice 3\nCoT-SC agent dzzT, classifying molecules for C3h symmetry, thinking: I reviewed the symmetry elements of each molecule: triisopropyl borate has a threefold axis but no horizontal mirror plane (C3), quinuclidine lacks a C3 axis (C2 or lower), benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone retains a C3 axis plus a horizontal plane (C3h), and triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone has D3h symmetry.; answer: Symmetry classification:\n- Triisopropyl borate: C3\n- Quinuclidine: C2 (or lower)\n- Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone: C3h\n- Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone: D3h\n\nMolecule exhibiting C3h symmetry:\nBenzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone\nCoT-SC agent tmsD, classifying molecules for C3h symmetry, thinking: We determine point groups by looking for symmetry elements: triisopropyl borate has a three‐fold axis but no horizontal mirror (C3); quinuclidine is bicyclic with at most C2; benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone retains C3 and a σh (C3h); triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone has D3h.; answer: triisopropyl borate: C3 point group\nquinuclidine: C2 (or lower) point group\nbenzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone: C3h point group (exhibits C3h symmetry)\ntriphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone: D3h point group\nCoT-SC agent 6XrI, classifying molecules for C3h symmetry, thinking: We evaluate each molecule’s symmetry: quinuclidine is a bicyclic amine lacking a threefold axis (at best C2), triisopropyl borate has a threefold axis but no horizontal mirror plane (C3), benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone retains a C3 axis plus a horizontal σ plane (C3h), and the triphenyleno analog has D3h symmetry.
