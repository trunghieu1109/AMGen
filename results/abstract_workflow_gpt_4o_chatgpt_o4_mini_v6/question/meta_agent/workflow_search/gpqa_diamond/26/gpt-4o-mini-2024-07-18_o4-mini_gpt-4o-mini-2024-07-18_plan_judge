Question: Example(question='"Oh, I know you," the ribonucleoprotein particle says to the nascent chain as they meet. "Pause there for a minute. Let me show you in; you really need some sugar."\n"It seems somewhat rough. I guess this is goodbye; I need to be on my way", the chain replies. Where did they meet, and where is the chain heading?', choice1='membrane to the nucleus', choice2='ribosome to the proteasome', choice3='Golgi to the mitochondrion', choice4='cytosol to the extracellular space', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_26
proposed answer: The signal recognition particle, a ribonucleoprotein, binds the nascent chain at the ribosome in the cytosol, pauses translation, and directs it into the secretory pathway for glycosylation and eventual secretion outside the cell.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_16_26
proposed answer: The signal recognition particle (SRP) binds the nascent chain at the ribosome on the cytosolic face of the rough ER, pauses translation, and directs it into the ER for glycosylation. From there the protein follows the secretory pathway to be secreted extracellularly.
