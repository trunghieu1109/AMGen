Question: Example(question='Astronomers are studying a system of five exoplanets with circular orbits, discovered through the TTV method. The planets (designated as Planet_1 through Planet_5), which are in orbital resonance, have orbital periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Assuming these planets possess the same albedo, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2?', choice1='~0.75', choice2='~0.83', choice3='~0.69', choice4='~0.57', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_11_70
proposed answer: The calculated ratio T4/T2 ≈0.83, which directly matches choice B) ~0.83.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_16_70
proposed answer: Using the equilibrium temperature scaling Teq ∝ P^(−1/3), we compute Teq4/Teq2 = (P4/P2)^(−1/3) = (3.5/2)^(−1/3) = 1.75^(−1/3) ≈ 1/1.205 ≈ 0.83.
