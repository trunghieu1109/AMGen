For planets around the same star with identical albedo A, Teq ∝ d^(–1/2). By Kepler’s third law, d ∝ P^(2/3), so Teq ∝ P^(–1/3). We know P2=2\u2009units and P4=3.5\u2009units, so Teq2 ∝ 2^(–1/3) and Teq4 ∝ 3.5^(–1/3). However, without the star’s luminosity L* and the actual albedo A, we cannot compute absolute temperatures.; answer: Teq,2 ∝ 2^(–1/3)  and  Teq,4 ∝ 3.5^(–1/3)\n[TOO_HARD]\nTo obtain numerical equilibrium temperatures, please provide the star’s luminosity (L*) and the common planetary albedo (A).\nCritic agent MU3n, providing feedback, thinking: The agent correctly applied Teq ∝ d⁻¹ᐟ² and, via Kepler’s law d ∝ P²ᐟ³, obtained Teq ∝ P⁻¹ᐟ³. However, the result remains only proportional since L* and A are unspecified. The simple model also omits atmospheric greenhouse effects, planetary emissivity, heat redistribution, and assumes perfect blackbody emission and uniform temperature.; answer: Using identical albedo and circular orbits gives Teq,2 ∝ 2⁻¹ᐟ³ and Teq,4 ∝ 3.5⁻¹ᐟ³. Absolute equilibrium temperatures cannot be computed without the star’s luminosity L* and the planets’ bond albedo A. Additional limitations include neglecting greenhouse warming, emissivity variations, heat redistribution across the surface, and non–blackbody effects. [TOO_HARD]\nPlease provide the stellar luminosity and a representative albedo (and any redistribution factor) to compute numerical values.\nReflexion CoT agent AXCS, refining equilibrium temperature calculations, thinking: The equilibrium temperature Teq for planets with identical albedo and in circular orbits scales as Teq ∝ d⁻¹ᐟ². By Kepler’s third law, orbital distance d ∝ P²ᐟ³, so Teq ∝ P⁻¹ᐟ³. For Planet_2 (P=2) and Planet_4 (P=3.5), we get proportional temperatures Teq,2 ∝ 2^(–1/3) and Teq,4 ∝ 3.5^(–1/3). Absolute values require the star’s luminosity (L*) and the planets’ albedo (A).; answer: Teq,2 ∝ 2^(–1/3) and Teq,4 ∝ 3.5^(–1/3)\n[TOO_HARD]\nRequest the star’s luminosity L* and the common albedo A to compute absolute equilibrium temperatures.\nDebate agent p93T, round 0, determining temperature ratio, thinking: For circular orbits with identical albedo, Teq ∝ P^(–1/3).
