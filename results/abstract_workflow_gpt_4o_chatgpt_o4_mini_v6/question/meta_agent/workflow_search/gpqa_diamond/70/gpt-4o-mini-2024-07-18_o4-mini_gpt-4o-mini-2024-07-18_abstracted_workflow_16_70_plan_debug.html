{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Astronomers are studying a system of five exoplanets with circular orbits, discovered through the TTV method. The planets (designated as Planet_1 through Planet_5), which are in orbital resonance, have orbital periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Assuming these planets possess the same albedo, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2?&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;~0.75&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;~0.83&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;~0.69&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;~0.57&#39;}. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 3: Determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for Planet_4 and Planet_2. 

 ### thinking by Debate Agent p93T:
For circular orbits with identical albedo, Teq ∝ P^(–1/3). Thus Teq4/Teq2 = (3.5/2)^(–1/3) = (1.75)^(–1/3) ≈ 1/(1.75^(1/3)) ≈ 1/1.21 ≈ 0.83.

### thinking by Debate Agent rrjK:
The equilibrium temperature scales as Teq ∝ P^(–1/3). Thus
the ratio Teq,4/Teq,2 = (P4/P2)^(–1/3) = (3.5/2)^(–1/3) = 1.75^(–1/3) ≈ 1/1.205 ≈ 0.83.

### thinking by Debate Agent ng3q:
Using the relation Teq ∝ P^(-1/3), the ratio T4/T2 = (P4/P2)^(-1/3) = (3.5/2)^(-1/3) ≈ (1.75)^(-1/3) ≈ 1/1.205 ≈ 0.83.

### thinking by Debate Agent Miri:
Using Teq ∝ P^(–1/3), the ratio T4/T2 = (3.5^(–1/3))/(2^(–1/3)) = (2/3.5)^(1/3) = (0.5714)^(1/3) ≈ 0.83.

### answer by Debate Agent p93T:
B)

### answer by Debate Agent rrjK:
~0.83

### answer by Debate Agent ng3q:
B)

### answer by Debate Agent Miri:
B)

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 3: Make a final decision on the temperature ratio.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
