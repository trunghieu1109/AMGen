To resolve both, the level spacing must exceed the larger linewidth ≈6.6×10⁻⁷\u2009eV.

For τ₁=10⁻⁹\u2009s, ΔE₁≈ħ/τ₁≈6.6×10⁻⁷\u2009eV; for τ₂=10⁻⁸\u2009s, ΔE₂≈6.6×10⁻⁸\u2009eV. To clearly resolve the two levels, their separation must exceed the larger linewidth (~10⁻⁶\u2009eV).; answer: ΔE must be ≳ħ/τ≈10⁻⁶\u2009eV, so only an energy difference significantly above this (e.g. 10⁻⁴\u2009eV) can be clearly resolved.\nCoT agent BWyY, classifying energy levels, thinking: Based on the energy–time uncertainty relation ΔE ≳ ħ/τ: for τ1 = 10^-9 s, ΔE1 ≈ ħ/τ1 ≈ 6.6×10^-7 eV; for τ2 = 10^-8 s, ΔE2 ≈ 6.6×10^-8 eV. The shorter-lived state E1 thus has a larger energy uncertainty (broader linewidth) while the longer-lived state E2 has a smaller uncertainty (narrower linewidth). A broader linewidth makes an energy level harder to resolve.; answer: State E1 (τ = 10^-9 s) is short-lived and has a broad linewidth (ΔE ≈ 6.6×10^-7 eV), making it less sharply defined. State E2 (τ = 10^-8 s) is longer-lived with a narrower linewidth (ΔE ≈ 6.6×10^-8 eV), hence more sharply defined. To clearly distinguish them, the energy separation must exceed the broader linewidth of E1.\nCoT agent gTpr, evaluating energy differences, thinking: The energy–time uncertainty gives ΔE1≈ħ/τ1≈6.6×10⁻⁷\u2009eV and ΔE2≈6.6×10⁻⁸\u2009eV.
