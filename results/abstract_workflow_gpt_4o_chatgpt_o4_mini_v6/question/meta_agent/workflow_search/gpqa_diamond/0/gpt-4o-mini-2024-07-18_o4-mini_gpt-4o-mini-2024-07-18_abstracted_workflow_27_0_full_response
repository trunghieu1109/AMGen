Using ħ = 6.58×10⁻¹⁶ eV·s and τ as the lifetime, ΔE ≈ ħ/(2τ).; answer: Sub-task 1:\nΔE₁ ≈ ħ/(2τ₁) = (6.58×10⁻¹⁶ eV·s)/(2×10⁻⁹ s) ≃ 3.3×10⁻⁷ eV\nΔE₂ ≈ ħ/(2τ₂) = (6.58×10⁻¹⁶ eV·s)/(2×10⁻⁸ s) ≃ 3.3×10⁻⁸ eV\nCoT-SC agent vBZF, identifying minimum energy difference, thinking: From the lifetimes τ₁=10⁻⁹ s and τ₂=10⁻⁸ s, we found ΔE₁ ≃ħ/(2τ₁) ≃3.3×10⁻⁷ eV and ΔE₂ ≃3.3×10⁻⁸ eV. To clearly resolve the two levels, the energy separation must exceed the larger uncertainty, i.e. ΔE₁.; answer: Minimum energy difference ≃3.3×10⁻⁷ eV\nCoT-SC agent 91ht, identifying minimum energy difference, thinking: To resolve two levels, their separation must exceed the larger of their natural widths: ΔE₁≈3.3×10⁻⁷ eV and ΔE₂≈3.3×10⁻⁸ eV. Therefore the minimum difference is about 3.3×10⁻⁷ eV.; answer: 3.3×10⁻⁷ eV\nCoT-SC agent bTb2, identifying minimum energy difference, thinking: To distinguish two levels their separation must exceed the larger of their intrinsic uncertainties (≈3.3×10⁻⁷ eV for the shorter‐lived state). Thus the minimum energy difference is set by that uncertainty.; answer: ≈3.3×10⁻⁷ eV\nCoT agent iMkA, evaluating options for energy differences, thinking: Given the minimum required energy difference of approximately 3.3×10^-7 eV, only the 10^-4 eV option exceeds this threshold; the others are smaller and thus cannot be clearly resolved.; answer: D)\nDebate agent 9v6F, round 0, selecting energy difference, thinking: Sub-task 3 concluded that only an energy difference exceeding approximately 3.3×10^-7\u2009eV allows clear resolution.
