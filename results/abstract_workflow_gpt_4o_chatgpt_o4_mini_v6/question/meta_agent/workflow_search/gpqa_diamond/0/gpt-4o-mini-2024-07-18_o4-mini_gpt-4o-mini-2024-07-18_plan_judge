Question: Example(question='Two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10^-9 sec and 10^-8 sec, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which one of the following options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?\n', choice1='10^-9 eV', choice2='10^-11 eV', choice3='10^-8 eV\n', choice4='10^-4 eV', correct_index=3)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_0
proposed answer: The energy–time uncertainty gives linewidths ΔE1≈ħ/τ1≈6.6×10⁻⁷ eV and ΔE2≈6.6×10⁻⁸ eV. To resolve both levels the spacing must exceed the larger linewidth (~6.6×10⁻⁷ eV). Among the choices only 10⁻⁴ eV≫6.6×10⁻⁷ eV.

Answer:D)

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_27_0
proposed answer: The minimum resolvable energy difference is approximately 3.3×10⁻⁷ eV, and among the provided choices only 10⁻⁴ eV exceeds this threshold, so D) is the correct selection.
