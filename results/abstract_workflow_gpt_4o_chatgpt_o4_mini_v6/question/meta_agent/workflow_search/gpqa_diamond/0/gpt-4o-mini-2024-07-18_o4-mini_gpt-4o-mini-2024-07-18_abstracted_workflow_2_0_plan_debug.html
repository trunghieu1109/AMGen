    <pre>Related original question:

{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10^-9 sec and 10^-8 sec, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which one of the following options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?\n&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;10^-9 eV&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;10^-11 eV&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;10^-8 eV\n&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;10^-4 eV&#39;}. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 3: Evaluate the energy difference options provided (10^-9 eV, 10^-11 eV, 10^-8 eV, 10^-4 eV) against the lifetimes of the quantum states to determine which energy difference allows for clear resolution of the states. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent gTpr:
The energy–time uncertainty gives ΔE1≈ħ/τ1≈6.6×10⁻⁷ eV and ΔE2≈6.6×10⁻⁸ eV. To resolve both, the level spacing must exceed the larger linewidth ≈6.6×10⁻⁷ eV. Among the choices only 10⁻⁴ eV≫6.6×10⁻⁷ eV.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent gTpr:
D)

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Select the most appropriate energy difference from the evaluated options that meets the criteria for distinguishability based on the lifetimes of the quantum states.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
