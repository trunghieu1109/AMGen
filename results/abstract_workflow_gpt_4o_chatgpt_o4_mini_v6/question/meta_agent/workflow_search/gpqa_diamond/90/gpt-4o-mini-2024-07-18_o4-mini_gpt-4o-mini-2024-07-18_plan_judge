Question: Example(question='cyclohexanone is treated with LDA at low temperature, followed by benzaldehyde. the reaction mixture is then acidified, forming product 1.\n\n1 is then treated with an excess of diethylaminosulfur trifluoride, forming product 2. what is the structure of prodcut 2?', choice1='(S)-2-((R)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one', choice2='((R)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene', choice3='(2R)-1-fluoro-2-((S)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-ol', choice4='((S)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_90
proposed answer: DAST deoxofluorination of the Î²-hydroxy ketone converts the ketone into a geminal difluoride on the cyclohexane ring and replaces the secondary alcohol with fluoride, yielding a difluorocyclohexyl group and a benzylic fluoride. Only choice 2 matches this structure.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_16_90
proposed answer: The DAST-mediated conversion of the benzylic alcohol to a fluoride and the ketone to a geminal difluoride yields 2-(fluoro(phenyl)methyl)-1,1-difluorocyclohexane. Only choice 2 matches this structure.
