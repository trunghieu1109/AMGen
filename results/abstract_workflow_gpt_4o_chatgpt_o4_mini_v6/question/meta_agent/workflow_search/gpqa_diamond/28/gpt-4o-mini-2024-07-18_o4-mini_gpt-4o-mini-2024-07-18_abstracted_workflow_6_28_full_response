Silent changes won’t disrupt function, missense may weaken it, and a premature stop will abolish it. Only the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 introduces a stop codon very early, truncating the enzyme and eliminating its function.; answer: Sub-task 2: Analysis of mutation impact:\n• Mutant 1 (silent Phe→Phe & Leu→Tyr): likely retains nearly full enzyme activity, so anti-nutrient still produced.\n• Mutant 2 (Leu→Stop at codon 3): premature stop truncates protein, abolishes enzyme function, so anti-nutrient synthesis eliminated.\n• Mutant 3 (Leu→Tyr & Gly→Val) and Mutant 4 (Leu→Tyr & Gly→Thr): two missense substitutions may alter but not fully abolish activity, so anti-nutrient likely still synthesized (perhaps at reduced levels).\nCoT-SC agent 7W9I, analyzing mutations' impact, thinking: We must evaluate how each mutation affects the protein’s ability to synthesize the anti-nutritional compound. Silent mutations (no amino acid change) usually have no effect; missense mutations may alter activity but often do not fully abolish function unless in critical residues; a premature stop codon (nonsense) early in the coding sequence will truncate the protein, most likely causing loss of function and preventing synthesis of the compound.; answer: Mutant 1: One silent Phe→Phe and one missense Leu→Tyr; likely retains most enzyme function, so compound still produced.\nMutant 2: One silent Phe→Phe and a nonsense Leu→Stop at codon 3; yields a severely truncated protein, almost certainly a loss-of-function allele, abolishing synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\nMutant 3: Two missense changes (Leu→Tyr, Gly→Val); may slightly alter activity but unlikely to fully inactivate the enzyme.\nMutant 4: Two missense changes (Leu→Tyr, Gly→Thr); similar to mutant 3, likely retains substantial function.\nCoT-SC agent buy7, analyzing mutations' impact, thinking: Based on the codon changes identified in Sub-task 1, only Mutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon (nonsense) in exon 1, which would truncate the enzyme and likely abolish its activity, preventing synthesis of the anti‐nutritional compound. The other mutants carry either silent or missense changes, which are less likely to completely eliminate enzyme function.; answer: Mutant 2\nCoT agent H3f3, evaluating mutants, thinking: Based on subtask 2, only Mutant 2 carries a nonsense codon in the first exon, leading to early truncation and likely complete loss of enzyme function. The others have only missense or silent changes and are unlikely to abolish compound synthesis fully.; answer: Mutant 1: unlikely to eliminate the compound (silent + conservative missense).\nMutant 2: very likely to eliminate the compound (nonsense mutation → truncation).\nMutant 3: unlikely to eliminate (missense changes only).\nMutant 4: unlikely to eliminate (missense changes only).\nDebate agent EgKB, round 0, selecting promising mutant, thinking: Mutant 2 carries a nonsense mutation in the first exon that introduces a premature stop codon, leading to truncated and nonfunctional enzyme.
