Counting atoms: phenyl C6 + 3 more carbons in the chain + 1 Me = C10; H count gives H12; one O from the OH.; answer: Structure: trans-Ph–CH=CH–CH(OH)–Me (i.e. (E)-3-phenyl-1-methylprop-2-en-1-ol). Molecular formula: C10H12O.\nCoT-SC agent 2vga, identifying product 2, thinking: Product 1 is trans-Ph–CH=CH–CH(OH)–Me (C10H12O). PCC oxidizes the secondary alcohol to a ketone without touching the alkene, giving trans-Ph–CH=CH–CO–Me. Removing two H atoms gives C10H10O.; answer: Structure: trans-Ph–CH=CH–CO–Me (i.e. (E)-3-phenyl-2-butenone). Molecular formula: C10H10O.\nCoT-SC agent oZtn, identifying product 2, thinking: PCC oxidizes the secondary allylic alcohol (Ph–CH=CH–CH(OH)–Me) to the corresponding ketone without touching the alkene. This gives the α,β-unsaturated ketone trans‐Ph–CH=CH–C(=O)–Me. Counting carbons: C6 (phenyl) + 3 in the chain + 1 methyl = C10; hydrogens: 5 on phenyl + 1 on α‐alkene C + 1 on β‐alkene C + 3 on methyl = H10; one O in the carbonyl.; answer: Structure: trans‐Ph–CH=CH–C(=O)–Me (an α,β‐unsaturated ketone). Molecular formula: C10H10O.\nCoT-SC agent E6Fv, identifying product 2, thinking: PCC selectively oxidizes the secondary allylic alcohol in product 1 (Ph–CH=CH–CH(OH)–Me) to the corresponding α,β‐unsaturated ketone. The Me group remains on the carbonyl carbon, giving Ph–CH=CH–CO–Me.; answer: Structure: (E)-1-phenylbut-2-en-1-one (Ph–CH=CH–CO–CH₃). Molecular formula: C₁₀H₈O.\nCoT agent g4h3, analyzing product 3, thinking: The reagent dimethyl(oxo)-λ6-sulfaneylidene)methane is the Corey–Chaykovsky sulfoxonium ylide, which reacts with the ketone of (E)-3-phenyl-2-butenone to give an epoxide at the former carbonyl, adding one CH₂ unit and leaving the alkene intact.
