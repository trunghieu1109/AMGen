The conjugated alkene geometry (E) is retained. Counting C6 (phenyl) + C3 (alkene + carbinol) + C1 (methyl) gives C10; H12 + O1.; answer: Product 1 is the allylic secondary alcohol Ph–CH=CH–CH(OH)–Me (E-configuration on the alkene), formed by Me– addition to the aldehyde to give a Mg alkoxide then acid workup, with molecular formula C10H12O.\nCoT agent wmGl, determining product 2 structure, thinking: PCC selectively oxidizes the secondary allylic alcohol in product 1 to the corresponding ketone, leaving the C=C intact. Thus Ph–CH=CH–CH(OH)–Me (C10H12O) is converted to Ph–CH=CH–C(=O)–Me (C10H10O), an α,β‐unsaturated ketone.; answer: Product 2 is the conjugated enone Ph–CH=CH–C(=O)–Me (an α,β-unsaturated ketone, C10H10O).\nCoT agent wHTj, analyzing product 3 structure, thinking: The reagent dimethyl(oxo)-λ6-sulfaneylidene)methane (a sulfoxonium ylide) can either epoxidize the carbonyl (Corey–Chaykovsky epoxidation) or cyclopropanate the conjugated C=C (Michael addition followed by ring closure).
