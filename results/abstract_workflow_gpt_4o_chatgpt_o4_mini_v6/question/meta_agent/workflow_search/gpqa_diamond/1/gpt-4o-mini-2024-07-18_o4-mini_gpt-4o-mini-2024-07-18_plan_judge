Question: Example(question='trans-cinnamaldehyde was treated with methylmagnesium bromide, forming product 1.\n\n1 was treated with pyridinium chlorochromate, forming product 2.\n\n3 was treated with (dimethyl(oxo)-l6-sulfaneylidene)methane in DMSO at elevated temperature, forming product 3.\n\nhow many carbon atoms are there in product 3?', choice1='10', choice2='12', choice3='11', choice4='14', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_8_1
proposed answer: trans-cinnamaldehyde has 9 C; addition of MeMgBr gives a 10-C alcohol; PCC oxidation retains 10 C; reaction with sulfoxonium ylide (Corey–Chaykovsky) adds one CH2 → 11 C total

Answer:C)
Extracted answer: C)
Correct answer: 2
