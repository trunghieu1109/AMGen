The SARS-CoV-2 programmed ribosomal frameshifting mostly has the same conformation as the SARS-CoV programmed ribosomal frameshifting.', choice2='SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14-ExoN operates as heterodimers in a mismatch repair mechanism. The N-terminal ExoN domain of nsp14 could bind to nsp10 making an active exonuclease complex that prevents the breakdown of dsRNA.

Caspase-8 activation is recognized as a characteristic feature of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway via death receptors, while Bcl-2 plays a crucial role in initiating the mitochondrial pathway. This suggests that the mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a induces apoptosis is via the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.\n', choice4='The rate of frameshifting in vitro is linearly correlated with the number of conformations that a pseudoknot can adopt.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_10
proposed answer: Based on the sub-task analyses, statements 1, 3, and 4 accurately describe SARS-CoV-2 molecular features, whereas statement 2 mischaracterizes the nsp14/nsp10 ExoN complex as dsRNA-stabilizing rather than a 3′–5′ proofreading exonuclease. Therefore the incorrect statement is choice B.

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_2_10
proposed answer: Statement 2 mischaracterizes the exonuclease activity of nsp14–nsp10: ExoN actually degrades mismatched RNA rather than preventing dsRNA breakdown. The other statements align with current structural and functional data for SARS-CoV-2.
