Claim: The SARS-CoV-2 frameshift element adopts a conformation nearly identical to that of SARS-CoV. Implication: Conservation of FSE structure suggests shared mechanisms of translation regulation and potential antiviral targeting.\n\nStatement 2: Key features: nsp14’s N-terminal ExoN domain associates with nsp10 to form a heterodimeric exonuclease complex; involved in mismatch excision during viral RNA synthesis. Claim: The nsp10/nsp14-ExoN complex prevents breakdown of double-stranded RNA through a repair mechanism. Implication: Proofreading by ExoN is critical for replication fidelity and a candidate for antiviral intervention.\n\nStatement 3: Key features: ORF3a protein activates caspase-8 cleavage without altering Bcl-2 levels. Claim: ORF3a induces apoptosis via the extrinsic (death receptor–linked) pathway rather than the mitochondrial (intrinsic) pathway. Implication: ORF3a-mediated cell death contributes to pathogenesis and immune modulation.\n\nStatement 4: Key features: In vitro frameshifting efficiency is proposed to correlate linearly with the number of distinct pseudoknot conformations under mechanical tension; both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 FSEs reportedly exhibit two tension-dependent conformers.

Programmed –1 ribosomal frameshifting at the 5′ end uses a slippery sequence and a downstream pseudoknot; the SARS-CoV-2 FSE structure closely resembles SARS-CoV. 2. nsp14 N-terminal ExoN must bind nsp10 to form the active proofreading complex, but ExoN catalyzes excision of misincorporated nucleotides in nascent RNA (i.e. promotes RNA breakdown), not prevents dsRNA degradation. 3. ORF3a induces caspase-8 activation without changing Bcl-2 levels, consistent with extrinsic apoptosis. 4.
