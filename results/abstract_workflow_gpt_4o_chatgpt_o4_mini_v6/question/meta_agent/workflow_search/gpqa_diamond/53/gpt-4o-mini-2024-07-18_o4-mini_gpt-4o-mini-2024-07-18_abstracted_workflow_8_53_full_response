RCM requires a linear diene with terminal alkenes that, upon closure, form the six‐membered ring and place substituents correctly. Thus the precursor must be an octa‐1,6‐diene bearing the same substituents on C3, C4, C5 of the eventual ring.; answer: Structure: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene. Necessary features for RCM precursor: a linear 1,6-diene (octa-1,6-diene) with methyl groups on C3 and C4 and an isopropyl on C5 of the chain so that ring closure between C1 and C6 yields the desired substituted cyclohexene.\nCoT agent 5Uio, analyzing starting materials, thinking: The RCM precursor must be an octa-1,6-diene bearing methyl groups on C3 and C4 and an isopropyl on C5 so that ring closure between the terminal alkenes yields the substituted cyclohexene.
