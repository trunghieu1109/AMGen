Dimethyl fumarate is achiral (trans alkene with symmetry).; answer: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nCoT-SC agent 89ko, determining optical isomerism, thinking: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (methyl lactate) has a stereogenic center at the carbon bearing –OH, –CH3, –H, and –COOCH3, making it chiral and optically active. Dimethyl fumarate, with a trans C=C between identical substituents, has E/Z geometry but no chiral centers and thus is not optically active.; answer: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nCoT-SC agent BRbZ, determining optical isomerism, thinking: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (the methyl ester of lactic acid) has a stereogenic center at the carbon bearing the OH and CH₃ groups, making it chiral and capable of optical isomerism. Dimethyl fumarate is an achiral trans-alkene diester with no stereogenic centers.; answer: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nReflexion CoT agent kFnH, compiling results, thinking: Benzoquinone cannot undergo keto–enol tautomerism without losing aromaticity, whereas cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can tautomerize to phloroglucinol. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and is optically active; dimethyl fumarate is not.
