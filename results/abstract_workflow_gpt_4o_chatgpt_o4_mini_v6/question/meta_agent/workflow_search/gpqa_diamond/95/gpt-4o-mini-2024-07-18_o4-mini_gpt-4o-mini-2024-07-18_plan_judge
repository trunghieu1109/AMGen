Question: Example(question='The angular size of the event horizon of a supermassive black hole in the centre of a galaxy at a distance of d=10^10 parsecs is measured to be θ=10^-17 degrees. Find the order of magnitude of the entropy of the blackhole.', choice1='10^59 J/K', choice2='10^65 J/K', choice3='10^62 J/K', choice4='10^66 J/K', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_4_95
proposed answer: From sub-task 6 we found S≈4×10^62 J/K, so the closest provided choice is 10^62 J/K, which corresponds to option C).

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_25_95
proposed answer: All debate agents consistently compute the entropy using S = kA/(4l_p^2) with r ≃5×10^7 m, yielding S ≃4×10^62 J/K, so the order of magnitude is 10^62 J/K.
