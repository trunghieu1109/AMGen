Question: Alice chooses a set $A$ of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets $B$ of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of $B$ belongs to $A$. Bob's list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_26
proposed answer: We have found the set A = {4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11} such that the sum of 2^{a-1} for a in A equals 2024. To find the sum of the elements of A, we simply add these integers: 4 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 = 55. This sum is the required answer.

Answer:55
Extracted answer: 55
Correct answer: 055
