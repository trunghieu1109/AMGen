Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Final Decision Agent Gkjj', content='From the given logarithmic equations, we define a = log2(x), b = log2(y), and c = log2(z). The system transforms into linear equations: a - b - c = 1/2, b - a - c = 1/3, c - a - b = 1/4. Solving these simultaneously yields a = -7/24, b = -3/8, and c = -5/12. We need to find |4a + 3b + 2c|. Converting all to a common denominator 24: a = -7/24, b = -9/24, c = -10/24. Calculate each term: 4a = -28/24, 3b = -27/24, 2c = -20/24. Summing: -28/24 - 27/24 - 20/24 = -75/24. Taking absolute value: 75/24. Simplify by dividing numerator and denominator by 3: 25/8. Since 25 and 8 are coprime, m = 25, n = 8, so m + n = 33.

The solutions satisfy the original system and the positivity constraints since x = 2^a, y = 2^b, z = 2^c are positive real numbers.

First, convert all fractions to a common denominator to add easily. The denominators are 24, 8, and 12. The least common denominator is 24. Express each term with denominator 24: a = -7/24, b = -3/8 = -9/24, c = -5/12 = -10/24. Now compute: 4a = 4*(-7/24) = -28/24, 3b = 3*(-9/24) = -27/24, 2c = 2*(-10/24) = -20/24.
