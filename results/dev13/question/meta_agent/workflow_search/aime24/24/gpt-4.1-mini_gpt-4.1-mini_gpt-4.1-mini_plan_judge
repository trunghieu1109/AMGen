Question: Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations:
\[\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}\]\[\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}\]\[\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}\]
Then the value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: From the given logarithmic equations, we define a = log2(x), b = log2(y), and c = log2(z). The system transforms into linear equations: a - b - c = 1/2, b - a - c = 1/3, c - a - b = 1/4. Solving these simultaneously yields a = -7/24, b = -3/8, and c = -5/12. We need to find |4a + 3b + 2c|. Converting all to a common denominator 24: a = -7/24, b = -9/24, c = -10/24. Calculate each term: 4a = -28/24, 3b = -27/24, 2c = -20/24. Summing: -28/24 - 27/24 - 20/24 = -75/24. Taking absolute value: 75/24. Simplify by dividing numerator and denominator by 3: 25/8. Since 25 and 8 are coprime, m = 25, n = 8, so m + n = 33. This matches the consensus from multiple solutions.
