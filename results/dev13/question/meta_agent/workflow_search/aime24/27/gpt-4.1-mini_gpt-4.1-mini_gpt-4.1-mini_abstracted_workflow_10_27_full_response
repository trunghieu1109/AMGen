Extract and Summarize Given Information:\n- N is a four-digit positive integer (i.e., 1000 ≤ N ≤ 9999).\n- N has the property: if any one digit of N is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7.\n- Q and R are defined by the division N ÷ 1000, where Q is the quotient and R is the remainder.\n- The task is to find Q + R.\n\n2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:\n- Changing one digit of N to 1 creates a new number divisible by 7. This implies that for each digit position, replacing that digit with 1 yields a multiple of 7.\n- Since N is four-digit, it has digits d_1 d_2 d_3 d_4 (thousands to units).\n- For each position i, the number formed by replacing d_i with 1 must be divisible by 7.\n- This creates a system of divisibility conditions linking the digits of N.\n- The problem asks for the greatest such N, so among all numbers satisfying these conditions, the maximum is sought.\n- Q and R come from dividing N by 1000, so Q = floor(N/1000) (the thousands digit) and R = N mod 1000 (the last three digits).\n\n3. Identify the Field of Study:\n- Number theory (divisibility, modular arithmetic).\n- Elementary algebra (digit manipulation, modular conditions).\n- Possibly combinatorics (searching digit combinations).\n- Such problems are common in mathematical competitions and recreational mathematics.\n\n4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:\n- The problem does not explicitly state whether digits can be zero except the leading digit (which must be nonzero for a four-digit number).\n- It is assumed that only one digit is changed at a time to 1, not multiple digits simultaneously.\n- The exact method to find N is not requested, only the analysis.\n- Potential complexity arises from multiple divisibility conditions and digit constraints.\n- Reasonable assumptions: digits are from 0 to 9, leading digit ≥ 1, and only one digit changed at a time.\n\nOverall, the problem involves analyzing digit-wise modular conditions to find the maximal four-digit number N with a special divisibility property, then computing Q + R from its division by 1000..These are just pieces of information related to the question.

The original number N can be expressed as N = 1000*d1 + 100*d2 + 10*d3 + d4. When we replace the i-th digit d_i with 1, the new number is divisible by 7. Let the number formed by replacing d_i with 1 be denoted as N_i. Then for each i in {1,2,3,4}, N_i is divisible by 7.\n\nExpress N_i in terms of digits:\n- For i=1 (thousands digit): N_1 = 1000*1 + 100*d2 + 10*d3 + d4\n- For i=2 (hundreds digit): N_2 = 1000*d1 + 100*1 + 10*d3 + d4\n- For i=3 (tens digit): N_3 = 1000*d1 + 100*d2 + 10*1 + d4\n- For i=4 (units digit): N_4 = 1000*d1 + 100*d2 + 10*d3 + 1\n\nSince N_i ≡ 0 (mod 7), we have:\n\n(1) 1000*1 + 100*d2 + 10*d3 + d4 ≡ 0 (mod 7)\n(2) 1000*d1 + 100*1 + 10*d3 + d4 ≡ 0 (mod 7)\n(3) 1000*d1 + 100*d2 + 10*1 + d4 ≡ 0 (mod 7)\n(4) 1000*d1 + 100*d2 + 10*d3 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 7)\n\nNext, reduce coefficients modulo 7:\n- 1000 mod 7: 7*142=994, remainder 6, so 1000 ≡ 6 (mod 7)\n- 100 mod 7: 7*14=98, remainder 2, so 100 ≡ 2 (mod 7)\n- 10 mod 7: 7*1=7, remainder 3, so 10 ≡ 3 (mod 7)\n\nSubstitute:\n(1) 6*1 + 2*d2 + 3*d3 + d4 ≡ 0 (mod 7)\n(2) 6*d1 + 2*1 + 3*d3 + d4 ≡ 0 (mod 7)\n(3) 6*d1 + 2*d2 + 3*1 + d4 ≡ 0 (mod 7)\n(4) 6*d1 + 2*d2 + 3*d3 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 7)\n\nRearranged:\n(1) 2*d2 + 3*d3 + d4 ≡ 1 (mod 7) (since 6*1=6, 0-6 ≡ 1 mod 7)\n(2) 6*d1 + 3*d3 + d4 ≡ 5 (mod 7) (0 - 2 = -2 ≡ 5 mod 7)\n(3) 6*d1 + 2*d2 + d4 ≡ 4 (mod 7) (0 - 3 = -3 ≡ 4 mod 7)\n(4) 6*d1 + 2*d2 + 3*d3 ≡ 6 (mod 7) (0 - 1 = -1 ≡ 6 mod 7)\n\nThus, the modular constraints are:\n- 2*d2 + 3*d3 + d4 ≡ 1 (mod 7)\n- 6*d1 + 3*d3 + d4 ≡ 5 (mod 7)\n- 6*d1 + 2*d2 + d4 ≡ 4 (mod 7)\n- 6*d1 + 2*d2 + 3*d3 ≡ 6 (mod 7)\n\nThese four congruences must hold simultaneously for digits d1 (1-9), d2, d3, d4 (0-9). This formulation expresses the divisibility conditions in modular arithmetic terms. We do not assume these conditions are sufficient to find N without further checking, but they are necessary conditions derived directly from the problem statement.; answer: Let N = d1 d2 d3 d4, with digits d1 (1-9), d2, d3, d4 (0-9).

The modular conditions used to generate these candidates are necessary but not sufficient, so explicit verification is mandatory. The verification process is: for each candidate N = d1 d2 d3 d4, replace d1 with 1, check divisibility by 7; replace d2 with 1, check divisibility by 7; replace d3 with 1, check divisibility by 7; replace d4 with 1, check divisibility by 7.
