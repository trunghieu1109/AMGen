Question: Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_15
proposed answer: From the previous step, we have the equation 1124 = 437 + 468 + 3 * x4, where x4 is the number of residents owning all four items (D, G, S, and C). Simplifying, 1124 = 905 + 3 * x4, so 3 * x4 = 219, which gives x4 = 219 / 3 = 73. This means 73 residents own all four items. This solution is consistent with the given data and the assumption that candy hearts is counted as one of the items in the totals for exactly two and exactly three items. Therefore, the number of residents owning all four items is 73.
