The expression inside the product can be rewritten as \\( f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2 \\) evaluated at \\( x = \\omega^k \\).

To simplify or rewrite it in a more revealing form, we can try to express it as a perfect square or factor it. Notice that f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2. The quadratic x^2 - 2x + 2 can be rewritten by completing the square: x^2 - 2x + 1 + 1 = (x - 1)^2 + 1. This form is simpler and more revealing because it shows that the polynomial is always positive (since (x - 1)^2 ≥ 0 and adding 1 makes it strictly positive). This simplification is important for later analysis because it helps us understand the nature of the values f(ω^k) takes for roots of unity ω^k, and it may help in factoring or evaluating the product over all roots of unity.

However, the product explicitly runs from \\( k=0 \\) to \\( 12 \\), so it includes the root 1 in the product.

Setting f(x) = 0 gives (x - 1)^2 = -1, so the roots are x = 1 + i and x = 1 - i. These roots have magnitude sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2), which is greater than 1, so they do not lie on the unit circle. The 13th roots of unity, ω^k for k=0 to 12, lie on the unit circle (magnitude 1). Therefore, none of the roots of f(x) coincide with any 13th root of unity. This implies that for all k, f(ω^k) ≠ 0, so none of the factors in the product ∏_{k=0}^{12} f(ω^k) are zero. Hence, the product is nonzero and there are no zero factors or trivial simplifications arising from root coincidences. This is crucial for evaluating the product since it guarantees all terms are nonzero and the product can be analyzed multiplicatively without concern for zero factors.

This is because the resultant of two polynomials f and g equals the product of f evaluated at all roots of g (counted with multiplicity), multiplied by the leading coefficient of g raised to the degree of f. Here, both f and x^{13} - 1 are monic, so the resultant equals the product of f(ω^k) over all 13th roots of unity ω^k. The polynomial x^{13} - 1 factors as (x - 1)Φ_{13}(x), where Φ_{13}(x) is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial whose roots are the primitive 13th roots of unity. Using the multiplicativity property of resultants, Res(f, x^{13} - 1) = Res(f, x - 1) * Res(f, Φ_{13}(x)). Evaluating Res(f, x - 1) is straightforward as it equals f(1). Thus, the product can be expressed as f(1) times the resultant of f and Φ_{13}(x).

The product we want to analyze is \\( \\prod_{k=0}^{12} f(\\omega^k) \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a 13th root of unity, so \\( \\omega^{13} = 1 \\). The \\( \\omega^k \\) for k=0,...,12 are all the roots of \\( x^{13} - 1 = 0 \\).

This product can be expressed in terms of the resultant of the polynomials f(x) and \\( x^{13} - 1 \\). Specifically, the resultant Res(f, x^{13} - 1) is equal to the product of f evaluated at all roots of \\( x^{13} - 1 \\), up to a factor depending on the leading coefficients of the polynomials. Since f(x) is quadratic with leading coefficient 1, and \\( x^{13} - 1 \\) is monic, the resultant is exactly \\( \\prod_{k=0}^{12} f(\\omega^k) \\).

Therefore, the product \\( \\prod_{k=0}^{12} f(\\omega^k) \\) equals the resultant Res(f, x^{13} - 1), which is the product of f(x) over all 13th roots of unity.

The problem states \\( \\omega \\neq 1 \\) to specify that \\( \\omega \\) is not the trivial root 1, i.e., \\( \\omega \\) is a primitive 13th root of unity or one of its powers other than 1. However, the product explicitly runs from \\( k=0 \\) to \\( 12 \\), so it includes the root 1 in the product. Therefore, the set of roots over which the product is taken is the entire set of 13th roots of unity, including 1. The condition \\( \\omega \\neq 1 \\) serves to clarify the nature of \\( \\omega \\) used to generate the roots but does not exclude 1 from the product. This distinction avoids conflating the specific root \\( \\omega \\) with the roots in the product, which collectively include 1. The assumption made is that \\( \\omega \\) is a primitive 13th root of unity, and the product is over all roots \\( \\omega^k \\) for \\( k=0,1,\\ldots,12 \\), including 1.; answer: The product is taken over the entire set of 13th roots of unity, which includes all complex numbers \\( \\omega^k \\) for \\( k=0,1,\\ldots,12 \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a primitive 13th root of unity.

The condition \\( \\omega \\neq 1 \\) in the problem statement specifies that \\( \\omega \\) is not the trivial root 1 but a primitive 13th root of unity; it does not exclude 1 from the product.

To determine its roots, we set f(x) = 0, which gives (x - 1)^2 + 1 = 0. This implies (x - 1)^2 = -1, so x - 1 = ±i, where i is the imaginary unit. Therefore, the roots of f(x) are x = 1 + i and x = 1 - i. Both roots are complex numbers with real part 1 and imaginary parts ±1. These roots are not on the unit circle since |1 ± i| = sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2) ≠ 1. The 13th roots of unity lie on the unit circle in the complex plane, with magnitude 1. Hence, none of the roots of f(x) coincide with any 13th root of unity. Since none of the factors f(ω^k) are zero, there are no zero factors in the product, so the product is nonzero. This also means there is no simplification due to zero factors. This fact is crucial for evaluating the product because it guarantees all terms are nonzero complex numbers, and the product can be analyzed multiplicatively without concern for zero factors.; answer: The polynomial f(x) = (x - 1)^2 + 1 has roots x = 1 + i and x = 1 - i, both of which are not 13th roots of unity since they do not lie on the unit circle. Therefore, none of the values f(ω^k) for k=0 to 12 equals zero, implying no zero factors in the product. This ensures the product over all 13th roots of unity is nonzero and no simplifications arise from zero factors.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent whMf, analyze roots of f(x) and intersection with 13th roots, thinking: The polynomial f(x) = (x - 1)^2 + 1 has no real roots because (x - 1)^2 ≥ 0 and adding 1 makes it strictly positive. To find roots, set f(x) = 0, which implies (x - 1)^2 = -1. So, x - 1 = ±i, giving roots x = 1 ± i. These roots are complex numbers not lying on the unit circle since |1 ± i| = sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2) ≠ 1. The 13th roots of unity lie on the unit circle (|ω^k| = 1), so none of the roots of f(x) coincide with any 13th root of unity. Therefore, for all k, f(ω^k) ≠ 0, meaning the product over all k of f(ω^k) has no zero factors. This implies no trivial zero product and no simplifications arising from roots coinciding. This is important because it ensures the product is nonzero and can be evaluated or simplified without concern for zero factors. Assumption: The polynomial roots are considered over the complex numbers, and the 13th roots of unity are on the unit circle, so no overlap occurs.; answer: The polynomial f(x) = (x - 1)^2 + 1 has two complex roots x = 1 + i and x = 1 - i, neither of which lie on the unit circle. Since all 13th roots of unity lie on the unit circle, none of the roots of f(x) coincide with any 13th root of unity.

To find its complex roots, set f(x) = 0, which gives (x - 1)^2 = -1, so x - 1 = ±i, and hence the roots are x = 1 + i and x = 1 - i. These roots are not on the unit circle since their magnitude is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2), which is greater than 1. The 13th roots of unity lie on the unit circle in the complex plane, so none of the roots of f(x) coincide with any 13th root of unity. This means f(ω^k) ≠ 0 for any k = 0, 1, ..., 12, where ω^k are the 13th roots of unity. Therefore, none of the factors in the product ∏_{k=0}^{12} f(ω^k) are zero, so the product does not vanish. Moreover, since f(x) does not share roots with x^{13} - 1, the product can be analyzed further using resultant or factorization techniques without concern for zero factors.; answer: The polynomial f(x) = (x - 1)^2 + 1 has two distinct complex roots x = 1 + i and x = 1 - i, neither of which is a 13th root of unity. Therefore, f(x) has no roots coinciding with the 13th roots of unity, implying that none of the factors f(ω^k) in the product are zero.

This is because the resultant Res(f, g) equals the product of f(α) over all roots α of g(x), up to leading coefficient factors, and both polynomials have leading coefficient 1 here. Since x^{13} - 1 factors as (x - 1)Φ_{13}(x), where Φ_{13}(x) is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, the resultant can be expressed using the multiplicativity property of resultants: Res(f, x^{13} - 1) = Res(f, x - 1) * Res(f, Φ_{13}(x)). Evaluating Res(f, x - 1) is straightforward as it is f(1). Thus, the product can be expressed as the product of f evaluated at 1 times the resultant of f and Φ_{13}(x). This expression avoids direct numeric substitution and leverages polynomial factorization and resultant properties to express the product algebraically in terms of f, Φ_{13}, and (x - 1).

The polynomial x^{13} - 1 factorizes as (x - 1) * Φ_{13}(x), where Φ_{13}(x) is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial whose roots are the primitive 13th roots of unity. The resultant is multiplicative over polynomial factorization, so Res(f, x^{13} - 1) = Res(f, x - 1) * Res(f, Φ_{13}(x)). Since f(x) is quadratic and monic in the highest degree term, and x^{13} - 1 is monic, the resultant equals the product of f evaluated at all roots of x^{13} - 1. Thus, the product \\prod_{k=0}^{12} f(\\omega^k) = Res(f, x^{13} - 1) = Res(f, x - 1) * Res(f, Φ_{13}(x)). This expresses the product as a product of two resultants involving f(x), Φ_{13}(x), and (x - 1).

The product over all roots of unity of f evaluated at these roots is the resultant Res(f, x^{13} - 1), because the resultant of two polynomials f and g is the product of f evaluated at all roots of g (counted with multiplicity) multiplied by the leading coefficient of g raised to the degree of f. Here, both polynomials have leading coefficient 1, so the resultant equals the product. Since x^{13} - 1 factors as (x-1)Φ_{13}(x), where Φ_{13}(x) is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, the resultant can be factorized accordingly using the multiplicativity of resultants: Res(f, x^{13} - 1) = Res(f, x-1) * Res(f, Φ_{13}(x)). This expresses the product as a product of two resultants. Thus, the product ∏_{k=0}^{12} f(ω^k) = Res(f, x^{13} - 1) = Res(f, x-1) * Res(f, Φ_{13}(x)).
