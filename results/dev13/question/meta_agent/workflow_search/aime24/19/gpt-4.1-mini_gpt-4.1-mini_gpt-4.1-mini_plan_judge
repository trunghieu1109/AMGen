Question: Let $\omega\neq 1$ be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\]
is divided by 1000.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_5_19
proposed answer: From the previous sub-task, we found that the exact value of the product \( \prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) \) is 289. The problem now asks for the remainder when this product is divided by 1000. Since 289 is less than 1000, the remainder when 289 is divided by 1000 is simply 289. Therefore, the remainder modulo 1000 is 289.

Question: Let $\omega\neq 1$ be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\]
is divided by 1000.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_5_19
proposed answer: The verified numeric product from the previous step is 8065. To find the remainder when 8065 is divided by 1000, we perform modular reduction: 8065 mod 1000 equals 65 because 8065 = 8*1000 + 65. Therefore, the remainder is 65. This step ensures correctness in modular arithmetic by straightforward division and taking the remainder.
