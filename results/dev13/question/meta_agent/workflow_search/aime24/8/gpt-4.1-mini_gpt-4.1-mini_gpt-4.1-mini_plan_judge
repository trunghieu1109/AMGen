Question: Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.

proposed answer: The losing positions are those where n mod 5 = 0 or n mod 5 = 2. To find the number of losing positions for n ≤ 2024, we count how many integers from 1 to 2024 satisfy these conditions. The integers from 1 to 2024 can be divided into groups of 5 consecutive numbers: each group has exactly two losing positions (those congruent to 0 mod 5 and 2 mod 5). The number of complete groups of 5 in 2024 is 2024 // 5 = 404. Each group contributes 2 losing positions, so 404 * 2 = 808 losing positions from complete groups. Now, consider the remainder: 2024 % 5 = 4, so the last partial group includes numbers 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024. Among these, numbers congruent to 0 mod 5 or 2 mod 5 are 2022 (since 2022 mod 5 = 2) and 2025 (which is beyond 2024). So only 2022 is an additional losing position. Therefore, total losing positions = 808 + 1 = 809. Hence, there are 809 values of n ≤ 2024 for which Bob has a guaranteed winning strategy.
