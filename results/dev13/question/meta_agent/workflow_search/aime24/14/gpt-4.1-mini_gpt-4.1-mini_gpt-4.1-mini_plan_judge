Question: Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.

proposed answer: We start from the condition that the rhombus ABCD has diagonals intersecting at the origin, with points A, B, C, D on the hyperbola x^2/20 - y^2/24 = 1. The diagonals are vectors 2a and 2b, with a and b on the hyperbola and satisfying a · b = 0 (perpendicular diagonals). Parametrizing points on the hyperbola as (sqrt(20) cosh u, sqrt(24) sinh u), the orthogonality condition leads to tanh u * tanh v = 5/6. The squared length of diagonal BD is BD^2 = 4(20 cosh^2 v + 24 sinh^2 v) = 4(20 + 24 t^2)/(1 - t^2), where t = tanh v. Since |t| > 5/6, BD^2 is minimized at t = 5/6, giving BD^2 = 400. As t approaches 1, BD^2 grows without bound, so BD^2 is unbounded above. Therefore, the greatest real number less than or equal to BD^2 for all such rhombi is the minimal value 400. This means BD^2 ≥ 400 for all rhombi with the given conditions, and 400 is the greatest lower bound. The assumptions made include the rhombus being convex and planar, and the diagonals intersecting at the origin as midpoints. The final answer is consistent with the geometric and algebraic constraints and is complete.

proposed answer: We start from the problem of finding the minimal value of BD^2 for rhombi inscribed in the hyperbola x^2/20 - y^2/24 = 1 with diagonals intersecting at the origin. The rhombus condition implies the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other at the origin, so vectors a and b representing points A and B satisfy a · b = 0. Parametrizing points on the hyperbola as (sqrt(20) cosh t, sqrt(24) sinh t), the perpendicularity condition leads to a relation between parameters s and t: coth s = (6/5) tanh t. Using hyperbolic identities, we find that the minimal BD^2 corresponds to tanh t = 5/6, which gives cosh^2 t = 36/11. Substituting into BD^2 = 4|b|^2 = 4(20 cosh^2 t - 24 sinh^2 t) and simplifying using sinh^2 t = cosh^2 t - 1, we get BD^2 = 176 cosh^2 t - 96. Plugging cosh^2 t = 36/11 yields BD^2 = 176*(36/11) - 96 = 576 - 96 = 480. This value is the infimum of BD^2 for all such rhombi, meaning BD^2 cannot be less than 480. Since the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD^2 for all such rhombi, this corresponds to 480. The numeric consistency is confirmed by careful substitution and use of hyperbolic identities. The assumption is that the rhombus is convex and planar, and the parametrization is valid. No contradictions arise, and the minimal BD^2 is exactly 480. Therefore, the greatest real number less than or equal to BD^2 for all such rhombi is 480.
