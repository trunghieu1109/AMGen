Question: Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.

proposed answer: We are given a set of rectangular boxes with dimensions (x, y, z) such that the surface area 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 and volume xyz = 23. We want to find the minimal squared diagonal d^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 among such boxes. The radius r of the smallest sphere containing the box is half the diagonal, so r^2 = d^2 / 4. Using symmetry and Lagrange multipliers, assume y = z = t and x = s. From volume: s t^2 = 23 => s = 23 / t^2. From surface area: 2(st + t^2 + st) = 54 => 4 s t + 2 t^2 = 54. Substitute s: 4 * (23 / t^2) * t + 2 t^2 = 54 => 92 / t + 2 t^2 = 54. Multiply both sides by t: 92 + 2 t^3 = 54 t => 2 t^3 - 54 t + 92 = 0 => t^3 - 27 t + 46 = 0. Testing t=2: 8 - 54 + 46 = 0, so t=2 is a root. Then s = 23 / 4 = 5.75. Calculate diagonal squared: d^2 = s^2 + 2 t^2 = (5.75)^2 + 2*(2)^2 = 33.0625 + 8 = 41.0625. Express 41.0625 as a fraction: 41 + 1/16 = (41*16 + 1)/16 = 657/16. Therefore, r^2 = d^2 / 4 = (657/16)/4 = 657/64. Since 657 = 3^2 * 73 and 64 = 2^6, the fraction is in lowest terms. Hence, p = 657, q = 64, and p + q = 721. This confirms the fraction for r^2 is 657/64 and the sum p+q is 721.
