proposed answer: Given the system of equations y^x = x^{10} and x^{4y} = y^{10} with x > 1 and y > 1, we start by expressing y in terms of x from the first equation: y = x^{10/x}. Substituting this into the second equation gives x^{4y} = y^{10} => x^{4 * x^{10/x}} = (x^{10/x})^{10} = x^{100/x}. Since x > 1, the exponential function is injective, so the exponents must be equal: 4 * x^{10/x} = 100 / x. Multiplying both sides by x yields 4x * x^{10/x} = 100, or equivalently 4 * x^{1 + 10/x} = 100. Dividing both sides by 4 gives x^{1 + 10/x} = 25. The product xy = x * y = x * x^{10/x} = x^{1 + 10/x} = 25. This satisfies the constraints and is consistent with the given equations. Hence, the exact numeric value of the product xy is 25.
