The second equation becomes x^{4y} = y^{10} => x^{4y} = (x^{10/x})^{10} = x^{100/x}. Taking logarithm base x on both sides, we get 4y = 100/x. Substitute y = x^{10/x} into this: 4 * x^{10/x} = 100/x.

But t = 10/x, so the exponent is 1 + 10/x. This is a transcendental equation in x. Now, recall y = x^{10/x}, so the product xy = x * y = x * x^{10/x} = x^{1 + 10/x}. From above, x^{1 + 10/x} = 25.

Substitute y = x^{10/x} into the second equation x^{4y} = y^{10} to analyze the relationship. Replacing y, the second equation becomes x^{4 * x^{10/x}} = (x^{10/x})^{10} = x^{(10/x)*10} = x^{100/x}. Now the equation is x^{4 * x^{10/x}} = x^{100/x}. Since x > 1, the function f(t) = x^t is one-to-one, so the exponents must be equal: 4 * x^{10/x} = 100 / x. Multiply both sides by x: 4x * x^{10/x} = 100. Note that x * x^{10/x} = x^{1 + 10/x} = x^{(x + 10)/x}. So we have 4 * x^{(x + 10)/x} = 100, or x^{(x + 10)/x} = 25. Taking natural logs: ((x + 10)/x) * ln x = ln 25. Define S = ln x > 0 (since x > 1). Then ((x + 10)/x) * S = ln 25. But (x + 10)/x = 1 + 10/x. So (1 + 10/x) * S = ln 25. Rearranged: S + 10 * S / x = ln 25. Since S = ln x, and x > 1, this is a transcendental equation in x. Alternatively, consider the product xy. Recall y = x^{10/x}, so xy = x * x^{10/x} = x^{1 + 10/x} = x^{(x + 10)/x}. From the previous step, x^{(x + 10)/x} = 25. Thus, xy = 25. This gives an explicit expression for the product xy.
