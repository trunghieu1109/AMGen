Question: A list of positive integers has the following properties:
$\bullet$ The sum of the items in the list is $30$.
$\bullet$ The unique mode of the list is $9$.
$\bullet$ The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.
Find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

proposed answer: The problem requires a list of positive integers with sum 30, unique mode 9, and median a positive integer not in the list. The median condition implies the list length is even, and the median is the average of the two middle elements, which is an integer not present in the list. The unique mode 9 means 9 appears more times than any other number. After thorough analysis and attempts with various list lengths, no list of positive integers exactly satisfies all conditions with sum 30. The closest candidate list is [1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 9], which sums to 29 (off by 1), has unique mode 9, and median 4 (not in the list). Given the instructions to make an assumption if cases are not defined, we assume this closest candidate list to compute the sum of squares. The sum of squares is 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 5^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 = 1 + 4 + 9 + 25 + 81 + 81 = 201.

proposed answer: The problem states that the list consists of positive integers summing to 30, with a unique mode of 9, and the median is a positive integer not in the list. Since the median is not in the list and is a positive integer, the list length must be even, and the median is the average of the two middle elements. The unique mode 9 means 9 appears more times than any other number. Testing the smallest even length, 4, and including two 9s (to ensure mode 9 is unique), the other two numbers must sum to 12 (30 - 18 = 12). Possible pairs are (5,7), (6,6), (4,8), etc. Checking the median condition: for the list [5,7,9,9], the median is (7+9)/2 = 8, which is a positive integer not in the list. The mode 9 appears twice, others once, so the unique mode condition holds. The sum is 30. The sum of squares is 25 + 49 + 81 + 81 = 236. Other pairs fail the median or mode condition. Larger list lengths are less feasible due to sum and median constraints. Therefore, the unique valid list is [5,7,9,9], and the sum of squares is 236.
