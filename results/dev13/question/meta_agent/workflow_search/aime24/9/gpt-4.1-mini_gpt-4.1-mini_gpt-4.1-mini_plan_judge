Question: Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: To find the sum m + n where m/n is the simplified conditional probability that Jen wins the grand prize given she won a prize, we start by noting the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is C(10,4) = 210. The probability of winning the grand prize (all 4 chosen numbers match the drawn numbers) is 1/210. The probability of winning a prize (at least 2 matches) is given as 23/42. The conditional probability is therefore (1/210) divided by (23/42), which equals (1/210) * (42/23) = 42 / (210*23). Simplifying 42/210 to 1/5 gives (1/5)*(1/23) = 1/115. The fraction 1/115 is in lowest terms, so m = 1 and n = 115. Hence, m + n = 116.
