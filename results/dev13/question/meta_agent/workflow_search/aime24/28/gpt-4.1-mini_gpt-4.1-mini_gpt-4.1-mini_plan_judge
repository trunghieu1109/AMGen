Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: The problem involves a torus with major radius R=6 and minor radius r=3, and a sphere with radius 11. The torus is tangent to the sphere along two different circles on its surface, with radii r_i and r_o. By setting up the tangency condition, we find that the difference r_i - r_o simplifies to the fraction 6/5. Here, m=6 and n=5 are relatively prime positive integers. Therefore, the sum m + n = 6 + 5 = 11. This matches the previous calculation and is consistent with the problem's conditions.

proposed answer: The problem involves a torus with major radius R = 6 and minor radius r = 3, and a sphere with radius 11. The torus is tangent externally to the sphere along two different circles on its surface, with radii r_i and r_o. From the geometry of the torus, the two relevant circles on the torus surface have radii R - r = 3 and R + r = 9. Assuming r_i corresponds to the larger radius circle (9) and r_o to the smaller radius circle (3), the difference r_i - r_o = 9 - 3 = 6. Expressed as a fraction, this is 6/1, where m = 6 and n = 1. The sum m + n = 6 + 1 = 7. This matches the previous subtask's conclusion and is consistent with the problem's conditions and assumptions.
