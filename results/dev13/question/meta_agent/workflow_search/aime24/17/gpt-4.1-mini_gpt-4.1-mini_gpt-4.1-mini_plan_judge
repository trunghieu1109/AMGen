Question: Find the number of triples of nonnegative integers \((a,b,c)\) satisfying \(a + b + c = 300\) and
\begin{equation*}
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.
\end{equation*}
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_16_17
proposed answer: The problem requires counting the number of triples (a,b,c) of nonnegative integers summing to 300 that satisfy the nonlinear equation a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000. By rewriting the nonlinear equation in terms of symmetric sums and analyzing the constraints, it becomes clear that no such triples exist. The balanced triple (100,100,100) does not satisfy the equation, and the strictness of the nonlinear constraint implies no other triples can satisfy it exactly. Since the problem does not specify otherwise, permutations of triples are considered distinct, but since no solutions exist, the total count remains zero. Therefore, the most consistent count of valid triples is 0.

proposed answer: From the previous sub-tasks and analysis, the nonlinear constraint can be rewritten as 100*(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000 given a + b + c = 300. Testing the balanced triple (100,100,100) satisfies this exactly. Also, considering cases where one variable is zero, say c=0, the equation reduces to 100*ab = 2,000,000, so ab = 20,000. With a + b = 300, the quadratic x^2 - 300x + 20,000 = 0 has integer roots 100 and 200, yielding solutions (0,100,200) and (0,200,100). By symmetry, all permutations of these triples are solutions. No other integer solutions arise from other values due to the constraints and the quadratic discriminant conditions. Since permutations are considered distinct (as clarified in Sub-task 4), the total solutions include the triple (100,100,100) and all permutations of (0,100,200). The triple (100,100,100) counts as one solution. The triple (0,100,200) has 3 distinct elements, so it has 3! = 6 permutations. Therefore, the total number of solutions is 1 + 6 = 7. Enumerating explicitly, the solutions are: (100,100,100), (0,100,200), (0,200,100), (100,0,200), (100,200,0), (200,0,100), (200,100,0). This counting is strictly based on validated enumerations and respects the distinctness of permutations.
