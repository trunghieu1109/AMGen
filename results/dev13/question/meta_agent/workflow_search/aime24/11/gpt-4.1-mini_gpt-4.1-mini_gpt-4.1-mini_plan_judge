Question: Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.

proposed answer: The final count obtained is 294 paths with exactly four direction changes on an 8x8 grid. To verify this, consider the combinatorial structure of the problem: each path consists of 16 steps (8 rights and 8 ups), and exactly four direction changes imply the path is composed of five runs alternating between R and U. The runs must sum to 8 for R and 8 for U steps respectively, with all run lengths positive integers. The problem reduces to counting the number of compositions of 8 into either 3 or 2 parts depending on the starting direction (since there are 5 runs total, starting with R means 3 R runs and 2 U runs, and vice versa). The number of compositions of an integer n into k positive parts is C(n-1, k-1). For starting with R, the count is C(7,2)*C(7,1) = 21*7=147; similarly for starting with U, the count is also 147. Summing these gives 294. This matches the known combinatorial identities for compositions and run counts in lattice paths. The result is consistent with the problem constraints and the combinatorial reasoning. Potential errors could arise if zero-length runs were allowed or if the starting direction was fixed, but the assumption here is that the starting direction can be either R or U and all runs have positive length. Thus, the count 294 is a valid and consistent answer for the number of paths with exactly four direction changes on the 8x8 grid.

Answer:The total number of paths with exactly four direction changes on the 8x8 grid is 294. This result is consistent with combinatorial identities related to compositions and run counts in lattice path enumeration, confirming the correctness of the count.
