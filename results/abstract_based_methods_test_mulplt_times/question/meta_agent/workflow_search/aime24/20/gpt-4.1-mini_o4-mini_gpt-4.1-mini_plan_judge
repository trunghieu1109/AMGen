Question: Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.

proposed answer: We need the smallest integer base b≥2 for which there are more than ten b-beautiful numbers.  A positive integer n is b-beautiful exactly when it has two base-b digits x,y summing to √n.  Writing s=x+y and n=s² gives the congruence s²≡s mod(b−1), i.e. s(s−1)≡0 mod(b−1).  For each prime factor p of d=b−1, s≡0 or 1 mod p^k, so there are 2^ω(d) residue classes mod d satisfying the condition, where ω(d) is the number of distinct primes dividing d.  Excluding the trivial small cases s=0,1 leaves roughly 2^ω(d)−2 valid positive s up to d.  We require 2^ω(d)−2>10 ⇒2^ω(d)>12 ⇒ω(d)≥4.  The smallest d with four distinct prime factors is 2·3·5·7=210, so b=d+1=211.  Thus b=211 is the least base giving more than ten b-beautiful integers.
