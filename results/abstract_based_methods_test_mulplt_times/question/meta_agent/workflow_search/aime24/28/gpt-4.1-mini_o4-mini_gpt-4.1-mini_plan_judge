Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.
Iteration: Test_multiple_times_28
proposed answer: From earlier results we found the inner‐tangent circle radius r_i=33/4 and the outer‐tangent radius r_o=33/7.  Their difference is Δr=r_i−r_o=33/4−33/7=33·(7−4)/28=99/28.  Since gcd(99,28)=1, we have m=99 and n=28, giving m+n=99+28=127.
