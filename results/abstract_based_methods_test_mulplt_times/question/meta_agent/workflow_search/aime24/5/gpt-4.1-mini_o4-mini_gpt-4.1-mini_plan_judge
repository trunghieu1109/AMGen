Question: Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.
Iteration: Test_multiple_times_5
proposed answer: From sub-task 8 we obtained the simplified form of the inradius as \(\frac{20\sqrt{21}}{63}\). Here m=20, n=21, and p=63. Summing gives m+n+p = 20 + 21 + 63 = 104.
