Question: Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.
Iteration: Test_multiple_times_14
proposed answer: We have determined in Sub-task 8 that the infimum of the range of the function f(t), which corresponds to BD^2 over all such rhombi, is 480. Since the question explicitly asks for the integer value of this infimum and requires returning only the integer, the correct response is 480.

Answer:480
Extracted answer: 480
Correct answer: 480
