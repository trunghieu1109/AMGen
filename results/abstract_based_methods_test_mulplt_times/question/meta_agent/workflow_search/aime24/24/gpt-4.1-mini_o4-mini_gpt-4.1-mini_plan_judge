Question: Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations:
\[\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}\]\[\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}\]\[\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}\]
Then the value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.
Iteration: Test_multiple_times_24
proposed answer: From Sub-task 5 we found 4a+3b+2c = -25/8. In lowest terms thatâ€™s -25/8, so m=25 and n=8 (relatively prime positive). Hence m+n = 25+8 = 33.
