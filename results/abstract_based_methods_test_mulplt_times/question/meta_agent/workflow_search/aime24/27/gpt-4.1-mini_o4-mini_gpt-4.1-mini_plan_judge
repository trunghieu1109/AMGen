Question: Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.
Iteration: Test_multiple_times_27
proposed answer: From Sub-task 7 we have N=5694. Dividing by 1000 gives quotient Q=5 and remainder R=694. Therefore Q+R = 5 + 694 = 699.

Answer:699
