Question: There exist real numbers $x$ and $y$, both greater than 1, such that $\log_x\left(y^x\right)=\log_y\left(x^{4y}\right)=10$. Find $xy$.
Iteration: Test_multiple_times_7
proposed answer: To solve 10/x = 2y/5 for the product xy:
1. Multiply both sides by x: 10 = (2y/5)Â·x.
2. Multiply both sides by 5: 50 = 2yx.
3. Divide both sides by 2: 25 = yx. Hence, xy = 25.

Answer:xy = 25
Extracted answer: xy = 25
Correct answer: 025
