Question: Let $\omega\neq 1$ be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\]
is divided by 1000.
Iteration: Test_multiple_times_19
proposed answer: From sub-task 8, we computed P = 8321. Dividing by 1000 gives a quotient of 8 and a remainder of 321. Hence the integer remainder is 321.

Answer:321
Extracted answer: 321
Correct answer: 321
