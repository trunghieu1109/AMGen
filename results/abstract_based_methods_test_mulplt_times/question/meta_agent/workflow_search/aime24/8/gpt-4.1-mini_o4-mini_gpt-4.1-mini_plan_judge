Question: Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.
Iteration: Test_multiple_times_8
proposed answer: We know that Bob wins exactly when n mod 5 is 0 or 2. Among positive integers ≤2024, there are floor(2024/5)=404 numbers with n≡0 mod 5 (i.e. 5,10,…,2020) and 405 numbers with n≡2 mod 5 (i.e. 2,7,…,2022). Summing gives 404+405=809.

Answer:809
Extracted answer: 809
Correct answer: 809
