Question: Find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid so that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is $999$, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is $99$. The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$.
\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\ \hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\ \hline \end{array}\]
Iteration: Test_multiple_times_23
proposed answer: We need the number of nonnegative integer solutions to t1 + t2 + t3 = 8, which by stars and bars is C(8+3−1, 3−1) = C(10,2) = 45. Therefore the count is 45.

Answer:45
Extracted answer: 45
