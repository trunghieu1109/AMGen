Question: Define $f(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{4}|$. Find the number of intersections of the graphs of \[y=4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \quad\text{ and }\quad x=4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))).\]
Iteration: Test_multiple_times_3
proposed answer: We found 8 distinct solutions in the fundamental cell [0,1)×[0,2/3). Because the functions are periodic in x with period 1 and in y with period 2/3, each of those 8 solutions gives rise to solutions at (x+m, y+n·(2/3)) for all integers m,n. Hence there are infinitely many intersection points in the plane.

Answer:Infinitely many
Extracted answer: Infinitely many
Correct answer: 385
