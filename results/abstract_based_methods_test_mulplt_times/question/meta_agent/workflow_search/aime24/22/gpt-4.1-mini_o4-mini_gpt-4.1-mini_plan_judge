Question: A list of positive integers has the following properties:
$\bullet$ The sum of the items in the list is $30$.
$\bullet$ The unique mode of the list is $9$.
$\bullet$ The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.
Find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

proposed answer: We need a list of positive integers summing to 30, with unique mode 9 and median a positive integer not in the list. To have the median be an integer not among the list and to control the mode, the list length must be even; the simplest is 4. Denote the sorted list [a,b,c,d]. For 9 to be the unique mode, exactly two entries must be 9, say c=d=9, and no other value repeats twice. Then a+b+9+9=30 ⇒ a+b=12 with a≤b≤9. The median is (b+c)/2 = (b+9)/2, which must be an integer m not equal to any list entry. Hence b must be odd, and m=(b+9)/2 must differ from a, b, and 9. The only pair (a,b) with a+b=12, a≤b<9, and b odd is (5,7). That yields the list [5,7,9,9], sum 30, mode 9, median (7+9)/2=8 not in the list. No other list satisfies all conditions. Summing squares: 5²+7²+9²+9² = 25+49+81+81 = 236.
