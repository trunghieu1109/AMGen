Question: Rectangles $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are drawn such that $D,E,C,F$ are collinear. Also, $A,D,H,G$ all lie on a circle. If $BC=16$,$AB=107$,$FG=17$, and $EF=184$, what is the length of $CE$?
Iteration: Test_multiple_times_10
proposed answer: We have CE1 = |C_x - E_x| = |108 - √8481|. Since √8481 = 92.092..., CE1 ≈ 108 - 92.092 = 15.9079. The sub-task asks for the integer value of CE1, so we take the integer part (floor) of 15.9079, which is 15.

Answer:15
