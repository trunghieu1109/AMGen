Question: Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.
Iteration: Test_multiple_times_15
proposed answer: First, we note that our candidate value is E4=73. This is clearly a nonnegative integer. Next, we recompute the relevant sums with E4=73:  
1. Pairwise intersections sum: 1139 + 6·73 = 1139 + 438 = 1577.  
2. Triple intersections sum: 234 + 4·73 = 234 + 292 = 526.  
3. Sum of sizes of the four single‐possession sets: 195 + 367 + 562 + 900 = 2024.  
Applying inclusion–exclusion:  2024 (sum of singles) – 1577 (sum of pairwise) + 526 (sum of triples) – 73 (quadruple) = (2024–1577)=447; 447+526=973; 973–73=900, which matches the total population.  
Thus E4=73 is nonnegative and yields the correct total when plugged back into the inclusion–exclusion formula.

Answer:E4=73 is a nonnegative integer and, upon substitution into the pairwise and triple sums and the inclusion–exclusion formula, reproduces the total of 900 residents, confirming its consistency.
Extracted answer: E4=73 is a nonnegative integer and, upon substitution into the pairwise and triple sums and the inclusion–exclusion formula, reproduces the total of 900 residents, confirming its consistency.
