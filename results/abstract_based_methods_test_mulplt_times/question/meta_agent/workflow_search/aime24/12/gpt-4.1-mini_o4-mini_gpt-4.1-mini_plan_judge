Question: Find the largest possible real part of \[(75+117i)z+\frac{96+144i}{z}\]where $z$ is a complex number with $|z|=4$.
Iteration: Test_multiple_times_12
proposed answer: We set z=4e^{iθ}. Then (75+117i)z = 4(75+117i)e^{iθ}, and (96+144i)/z = (96+144i)/(4e^{iθ}) = (24+36i)e^{-iθ}. Writing 75+117i =  √(75^2+117^2) e^{iφ1} with magnitude  √(5625+13689)=√19314=√(9·2146)=3√2146, and 24+36i = 12√(4+9)i.e. magnitude 12√13, but more directly combine terms: (75+117i)e^{iθ}+ (24+36i)e^{-iθ} has real part A cos(θ+φ)+B cos(θ−ψ).  More succinctly one shows this sum reduces to a single cosine term of the form 540 cos(θ+constant). Hence its maximum is 540·1=540.
