Question: Let $\triangle ABC$ have circumcenter $O$ and incenter $I$ with $\overline{IA}\perp\overline{OI}$, circumradius $13$, and inradius $6$. Find $AB\cdot AC$.
Iteration: Test_multiple_times_16
proposed answer: We know from Sub‐task 11 that the area Δ of triangle ABC is 36√30, and from Sub‐task 7 that sin A = (2√30)/13. The relation Δ = ½·b·c·sin A gives b·c = 2Δ/sin A. Substituting in, we get b·c = 2·(36√30)/((2√30)/13) = 72√30·(13/(2√30)) = (72·13)/2 = 36·13 = 468. Hence the product AB·AC = 468.
