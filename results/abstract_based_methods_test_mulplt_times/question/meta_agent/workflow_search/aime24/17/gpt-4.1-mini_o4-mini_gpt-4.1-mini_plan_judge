Question: Find the number of triples of nonnegative integers \((a,b,c)\) satisfying \(a + b + c = 300\) and
\begin{equation*}
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.
\end{equation*}
Iteration: Test_multiple_times_17
proposed answer: We derived that the condition 300(ab+ac+bc)−3abc=6,000,000 is equivalent to 100·s2 −s3=2,000,000, which leads to the factorization yielding that a triple (a,b,c) with a+b+c=300 satisfies E=6,000,000 exactly when at least one of a,b,c equals 100.  Counting ordered nonnegative solutions with sum 300 and at least one coordinate = 100: 
  • For each fixed position (say a=100), there are b+c=200 ⇒ 201 solutions.  Three positions give 3×201=603.  
  • Subtract overlaps where two positions are 100: there are 3 such overlaps but each is the single triple (100,100,100).  Add back the triple‐overlap once.  
So total =603−3+1=601 ordered triples.
