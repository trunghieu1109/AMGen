Question: Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.

proposed answer: From the analysis, the losing positions for the first player (Alice) are those where n mod 7 equals 2 or 5. These are the positions where Bob has a winning strategy. We need to count the number of positive integers n ≤ 2024 such that n mod 7 = 2 or n mod 7 = 5. The integers modulo 7 cycle every 7 numbers. For each residue class (2 and 5), the count of numbers up to 2024 is floor((2024 - residue) / 7) + 1. For residue 2: count_2 = floor((2024 - 2)/7) + 1 = floor(2022/7) + 1 = 288 + 1 = 289. For residue 5: count_5 = floor((2024 - 5)/7) + 1 = floor(2019/7) + 1 = 288 + 1 = 289. Total count = 289 + 289 = 578. Therefore, there are 578 positive integers n ≤ 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy.

proposed answer: From the previous validation step, we know the losing positions for the game are those where n mod 5 equals 0 or 2. This means the losing positions are numbers n such that n % 5 == 0 or n % 5 == 2. We need to count how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 satisfy this condition. For every block of 5 consecutive integers, exactly 2 of them are losing positions (those congruent to 0 or 2 modulo 5). The number of complete blocks of 5 in 2024 is 2024 // 5 = 404. Each block contributes 2 losing positions, so 404 * 2 = 808 losing positions from these complete blocks. Now, consider the remainder when dividing 2024 by 5: 2024 % 5 = 4. The numbers in the last partial block are 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024 with remainders 1, 2, 3, 4 respectively. Among these, only the number with remainder 2 (2022) is a losing position. So we add 1 more losing position. Total losing positions = 808 + 1 = 809. Therefore, there are 809 positive integers n ≤ 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy regardless of Alice's play.
