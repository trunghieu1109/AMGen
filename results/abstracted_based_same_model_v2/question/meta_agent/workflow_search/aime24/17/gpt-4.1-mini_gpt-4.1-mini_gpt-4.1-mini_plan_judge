Question: Find the number of triples of nonnegative integers \((a,b,c)\) satisfying \(a + b + c = 300\) and
\begin{equation*}
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.
\end{equation*}
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_1_17
proposed answer: The problem requires finding the number of triples (a, b, c) of nonnegative integers such that a + b + c = 300 and the polynomial expression a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b equals 6,000,000. From the previous sub-tasks and analysis, it was determined that the only triple satisfying both conditions is (100, 100, 100). This is because the polynomial expression is symmetric and the sum constraint is fixed, and the value 6,000,000 matches exactly when a = b = c = 100. No other triples meet both conditions simultaneously. Therefore, the count of such triples is exactly one.

proposed answer: The problem requires counting the number of nonnegative integer triples (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 and the polynomial condition a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000 holds. From the previous sub-tasks, the only solutions found are the six permutations of (0, 100, 200) and the triple (100, 100, 100). The six permutations arise because the triple (0, 100, 200) can be arranged in 3! = 6 ways, each distinct. The triple (100, 100, 100) is unique. No other triples satisfy both conditions. This conclusion is based on thorough case analysis covering all possibilities: one zero variable, two equal variables, and all distinct variables. Therefore, the total number of valid triples is 6 + 1 = 7.
