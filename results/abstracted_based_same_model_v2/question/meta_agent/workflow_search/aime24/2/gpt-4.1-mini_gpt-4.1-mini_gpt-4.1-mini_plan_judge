Question: Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?

proposed answer: From Sub-task 7, the simplified fraction representing the probability is 423/2048, where 423 and 2048 are relatively prime. Therefore, m = 423 and n = 2048. The problem asks for the sum m + n. Adding these gives 423 + 2048 = 2471. This sum is the final answer as requested.

proposed answer: From Sub-task 8, the simplified fraction representing the probability is 623/2048, where 623 and 2048 are relatively prime. Therefore, m = 623 and n = 2048. The problem asks for the sum m + n, which is 623 + 2048 = 2671. This is the final answer.
