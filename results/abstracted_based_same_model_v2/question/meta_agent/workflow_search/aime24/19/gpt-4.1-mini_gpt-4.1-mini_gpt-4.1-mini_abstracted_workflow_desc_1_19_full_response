Define \\( f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2 \\). The product is \\( \\prod_{k=0}^{12} f(\\omega^k) \\). Since \\( \\omega^k \\) are roots of \\( x^{13} - 1 = 0 \\), the product equals the resultant \\( \\mathrm{Res}(x^{13} - 1, f(x)) \\). The roots of \\( f(x) = 0 \\) are \\( 1 + i \\) and \\( 1 - i \\). The resultant can be computed as \\( P(1+i) P(1 - i) \\) where \\( P(x) = x^{13} - 1 \\). Calculating \\( (1+i)^{13} \\) and \\( (1 - i)^{13} \\) using polar form and simplifying yields \\( (1+i)^{13} = -64 - 64i \\) and \\( (1 - i)^{13} = -64 + 64i \\). Then \\( ((1+i)^{13} - 1)((1 - i)^{13} - 1) = (-65 - 64i)(-65 + 64i) = 8321 \\). Thus, the product is 8321. The remainder when divided by 1000 is 321. The previous answer 679 came from a sign error in the calculation of the product involving \\( P(i) \\) and \\( P(-i) \\). The correct approach is to use the roots of \\( f(x) \\) and evaluate \\( P \\) at these roots, which yields 8321.
