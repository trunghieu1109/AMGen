Question: Let $\omega\neq 1$ be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\]
is divided by 1000.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_1_19
proposed answer: The computed product value from the previous step is 8321. To find the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000, we take 8321 mod 1000. This is simply the last three digits of 8321, which is 321. Since 321 is between 0 and 999, it is the correct remainder.

Answer:321
Extracted answer: 321
Correct answer: 321
