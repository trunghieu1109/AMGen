Question: There exist real numbers $x$ and $y$, both greater than 1, such that $\log_x\left(y^x\right)=\log_y\left(x^{4y}\right)=10$. Find $xy$.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_1_7
proposed answer: From the previous sub-tasks, we derived the relationship y = 25 / x. Since both x and y are greater than 1 and satisfy the given logarithmic equations, the product xy simplifies to x * (25 / x) = 25. This result is exact and does not depend on the individual values of x and y, confirming that the product xy is precisely 25.

Answer:The product xy is exactly 25.
Extracted answer: The product xy is exactly 25.
Correct answer: 025
