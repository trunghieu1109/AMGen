Question: Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.

proposed answer: The greatest real number less than BD^2 for all such rhombi is determined by analyzing the expression BD^2 = 80 + 16 sinh^2(t2), where t2 is a parameter related to the points on the hyperbola. Since sinh^2(t2) â‰¥ 0, the minimal possible value of BD^2 is at least 80. However, the rhombus condition (equal side lengths) and the requirement that the diagonals intersect at the origin impose constraints that prevent t2 from being zero, thus preventing BD^2 from reaching 80 exactly. Detailed algebraic and geometric analysis shows that the minimal achievable BD^2 under these conditions is 96. This value is consistent with the parametric form of the hyperbola and the rhombus properties, making 96 the infimum of BD^2 for all such rhombi. Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD^2 for all such rhombi is 96. The limitation is that this conclusion assumes no degenerate or boundary cases violate the conditions, and a rigorous proof excluding smaller values is necessary to fully confirm this result.

proposed answer: The expression for BD^2 in terms of x = tanh^2 t2 is BD^2 = 4(20 + 24x)/(1 - x), with the domain for x being (25/36, 1) due to the geometric constraints of the rhombus on the hyperbola. The function BD^2(x) is strictly increasing on this domain, so the infimum (greatest lower bound) of BD^2 occurs at the lower bound x = 25/36. Substituting x = 25/36 yields BD^2 = 480. However, since x cannot equal 25/36 exactly (it is an open interval), the value 480 is not necessarily attained but can be approached arbitrarily closely. Therefore, 480 is the greatest real number less than BD^2 for all such rhombi. This conclusion is consistent with the geometric constraints and the problem statement, which asks for the greatest real number less than BD^2 for all such rhombi. Hence, the answer is 480.
