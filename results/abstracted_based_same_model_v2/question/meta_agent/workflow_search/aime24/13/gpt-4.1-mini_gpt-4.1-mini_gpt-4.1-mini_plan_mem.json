        "The derived inradius r_in = 68/3 is validated by substituting it back into the distance formulas for both configurations of tangent circles. This confirms that the total lengths along the sides, given by the number of circles times their radius, match the expected distances derived from the inradius and the angle at vertex B. The ratio consistency and the simplest form of the fraction are properly checked, ensuring the solution's correctness. Hence, the final answer m + n = 71 is correct.": "95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval: (0.0%, 0.0%), Median: 0.0%"
