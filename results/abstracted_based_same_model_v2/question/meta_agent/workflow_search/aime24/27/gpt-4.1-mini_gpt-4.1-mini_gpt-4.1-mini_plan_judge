Question: Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.

proposed answer: Both sub-task answers agree that the greatest four-digit number N satisfying the problem's conditions is 9651. Dividing 9651 by 1000 yields a quotient Q = 9 and a remainder R = 651. The sum Q + R is therefore 9 + 651 = 660. Since both independent answers match and the calculations are straightforward and verified, the final answer is confidently 660.

proposed answer: From Sub-task 7, we have Q = 5 and R = 694, where Q is the quotient and R is the remainder when N = 5694 is divided by 1000. The problem asks for the sum Q + R. Adding these values gives 5 + 694 = 699. This sum represents the final answer as requested.
