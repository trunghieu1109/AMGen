Question: Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations:
\[\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}\]\[\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}\]\[\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}\]
Then the value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: From the previous sub-task, the absolute value of log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) was found to be 25/8. This fraction is already in simplest form because 25 and 8 share no common divisors other than 1. The problem asks for the sum m + n where the fraction is m/n. Here, m = 25 and n = 8, so m + n = 25 + 8 = 33. Therefore, the final answer to the query is 33.

proposed answer: From Sub-task 5, the reduced fraction representing the absolute value of log2(x^4 y^3 z^2) is 25/4, where m = 25 and n = 4. These are relatively prime positive integers. The problem asks for the sum m + n, which is 25 + 4 = 29.
