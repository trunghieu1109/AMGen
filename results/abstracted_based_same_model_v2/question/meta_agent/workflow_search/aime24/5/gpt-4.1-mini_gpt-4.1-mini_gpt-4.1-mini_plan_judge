Question: Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_2_5
proposed answer: From Sub-task 8, the simplified form of the common distance is (30 sqrt(61)) / 61, where m=30, n=61, and p=61. These values satisfy the conditions: m and p are coprime (gcd(30,61)=1), and n=61 is square-free since 61 is a prime number. Therefore, the sum m + n + p = 30 + 61 + 61 = 152. This sum is the final answer requested in Sub-task 9.

proposed answer: From Sub-task 9, the distance is expressed as (4âˆš546)/123, where m=4, n=546, and p=123. These values satisfy the conditions: m and p are coprime, and n is square-free. The problem asks for the sum m + n + p. Calculating this sum: 4 + 546 + 123 = 673.
