Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: The difference r_i - r_o was simplified to the fraction 36/11, where 36 and 11 are relatively prime positive integers. The problem asks for the sum m + n, where m = 36 and n = 11. Adding these gives 36 + 11 = 47. Both previous agents agree on this result, and the fraction is in simplest form, so the final answer is 47.

proposed answer: From the previous sub-tasks, the difference r_i - r_o was found to be 6/1, where 6 and 1 are relatively prime positive integers. The problem asks for the sum m + n where m/n is the simplified fraction representing the difference. Since m = 6 and n = 1, the sum m + n = 6 + 1 = 7. This satisfies all the problem's requirements.
