proposed answer: From Sub-task 3, we know that the least prime p for which there exists a positive integer n such that p^2 divides n^4 + 1 is p = 41. We want to find the least positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 41^2 = 1681. Since 41 is congruent to 1 modulo 8, -1 is a quartic residue modulo 41, so there exists an integer n such that n^4 ≡ -1 (mod 41). By Hensel's lemma, this solution can be lifted to modulo 41^2. The problem reduces to finding the smallest positive integer m such that m^4 ≡ -1 (mod 1681). The solutions modulo 41 are known to be m ≡ 6, 35, 6^{-1}, or 35^{-1} (mod 41), where 6^4 ≡ -1 (mod 41). We check the smallest such m modulo 41, which is 6. Using Hensel's lemma, we lift the solution from modulo 41 to modulo 1681. The lifting process shows that the solution modulo 1681 is congruent to 6 modulo 41, and the smallest positive integer solution m is 6. Therefore, the least positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 41^2 is 6.

proposed answer: From Sub-task 3b, the lifted solutions modulo 289 (which is 17^2) are m = 2, 38, 251, 257, 287. These are all positive integers less than 289. Among these, the least positive integer is 2. Since 2^4 + 1 = 16 + 1 = 17, and 17 divides 2^4 + 1, and by Hensel's lemma, this solution lifts uniquely to modulo 289, it follows that 289 divides m^4 + 1 for m = 2. Therefore, the least positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 17^2 is m = 2.
