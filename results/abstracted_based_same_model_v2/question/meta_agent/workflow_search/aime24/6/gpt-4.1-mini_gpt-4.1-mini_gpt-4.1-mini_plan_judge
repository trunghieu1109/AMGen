Question: Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_1_6
proposed answer: From the previous sub-task, we have r^2 = 43/4, where 43 and 4 are relatively prime positive integers. Therefore, p = 43 and q = 4. The problem asks for p + q, which is 43 + 4 = 47.

proposed answer: From the previous sub-task, we have r^2 = 657/64, where p = 657 and q = 64. These are relatively prime integers. The problem asks for p + q. So, p + q = 657 + 64 = 721.
