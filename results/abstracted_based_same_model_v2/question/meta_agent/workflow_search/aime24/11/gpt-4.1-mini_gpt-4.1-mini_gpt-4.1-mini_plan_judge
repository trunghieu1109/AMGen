Question: Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.
[asy] size(10cm); usepackage("tikz");label("\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(2,0)--(2,3)--(5,3)--(5,8)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}",origin); label("\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(0,3)--(3,3)--(3,5)--(8,5)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}",E); [/asy]

proposed answer: The final count of 294 paths with exactly four direction changes on an 8x8 grid is consistent with the problem constraints and the combinatorial reasoning. The problem requires paths from the lower left to the upper right corner, consisting of 8 right moves and 8 up moves, totaling 16 moves. Exactly four direction changes mean the path is divided into 5 segments alternating between right and up moves. There are two possible starting directions: right or up. For each starting direction, the number of ways to partition the 8 moves into the required segments with positive lengths matches the compositions counted (21 and 7). Multiplying these and summing for both starting directions yields 294. This matches the detailed combinatorial analysis and respects the problem's conditions, confirming the correctness and consistency of the final count.

Answer:The final count of 294 valid paths with exactly four direction changes is correct and consistent with the problem constraints.
