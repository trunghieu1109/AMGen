Question: A list of positive integers has the following properties:
$\bullet$ The sum of the items in the list is $30$.
$\bullet$ The unique mode of the list is $9$.
$\bullet$ The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.
Find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

proposed answer: After thorough analysis and attempts to construct lists that satisfy all the given conditions—sum of items equals 30, unique mode is 9, and the median is a positive integer not present in the list—no such list can be found. Lists that satisfy the sum and median conditions either have multiple modes (including 9) or the median is present in the list. Lists with 9 as a unique mode fail the median condition or the sum condition. Therefore, no valid list exists that meets all the criteria simultaneously, and thus the sum of the squares of all items in such a list cannot be computed.

proposed answer: The only valid list identified that satisfies all constraints is [5,7,9,9]. The sum of the squares of its items is calculated as follows: 5^2 + 7^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 = 25 + 49 + 81 + 81 = 236. Since no other valid lists exist, this is the unique sum of squares.
