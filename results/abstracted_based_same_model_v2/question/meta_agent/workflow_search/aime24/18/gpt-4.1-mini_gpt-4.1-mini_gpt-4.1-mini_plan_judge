Question: Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). Then \(OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\).

proposed answer: The point C lies on the segment AB, which is parameterized as C = (1/2 - t/2, t * sqrt(3)/2) for t in (0,1). The family F consists of unit segments PQ with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis in the first quadrant. We want the unique point C on AB, distinct from A and B, that does not lie on any other segment in F except AB itself. By setting up the condition that C lies on some segment PQ in F other than AB, and analyzing the parametric equations, we find that the only such point C is the midpoint of AB, corresponding to t = 1/2. At t = 1/2, C = (1/4, sqrt(3)/4). Calculating OC^2 gives (1/4)^2 + (sqrt(3)/4)^2 = 1/16 + 3/16 = 4/16 = 1/4. Thus, OC^2 = 1/4, which is p/q with p=1 and q=4, relatively prime. Therefore, p + q = 5. This matches the detailed algebraic and geometric reasoning and is consistent with the problem's uniqueness condition.

proposed answer: Both agents XPsX and OIMK agree that the simplified fraction for OC^2 is 7/16, where 7 and 16 are relatively prime positive integers. Therefore, p = 7 and q = 16. The problem asks for the sum p + q, which is 7 + 16 = 23. Since both agents independently arrived at the same conclusion and the fraction is simplified, the final answer is confidently 23.
