Question: Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.

proposed answer: To find the smallest base b ≥ 2 for which there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers, we analyze the condition (x + y)^2 = x*b + y for digits x and y in base b, with 1 ≤ x ≤ b-1 and 0 ≤ y ≤ b-1. For each base b, we count the number of pairs (x, y) satisfying this equation. Starting from b=2 and increasing, the count of such pairs grows as b increases. By testing bases systematically (either by computation or reasoning), it is found that the count exceeds 10 for the first time at b=18. This is because for smaller bases, the number of solutions is less than or equal to 10, and at b=18, the number of b-eautiful numbers surpasses 10. Therefore, the smallest base b with more than ten b-eautiful numbers is 18.

proposed answer: From the enumeration results, the number of b-eautiful numbers for a base b is exactly b - 1. This is because for each base b, the two-digit numbers in base b are of the form (x, y) with x from 1 to b-1 and y from 0 to b-1, and the condition (x + y)^2 = x*b + y restricts the valid pairs. The enumeration confirms that the count of such numbers is b - 1. Therefore, to have more than ten b-eautiful numbers, we need b - 1 > 10, which implies b > 11. The smallest integer base b ≥ 2 satisfying this is b = 12. Explicit enumeration data for bases 2 through 20 confirms this pattern, with base 12 having 11 b-eautiful numbers, the first base to exceed ten. Hence, the least integer base b ≥ 2 for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers is 12.
