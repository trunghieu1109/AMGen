Question: Define $f(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{4}|$. Find the number of intersections of the graphs of \[y=4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \quad\text{ and }\quad x=4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))).\]

proposed answer: From Sub-task 6, we determined that the system y = h(x), x = k(y) has exactly 16 solutions in the domain [0, 1.5], where h(x) = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and k(y) = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). These solutions correspond exactly to the intersection points of the graphs y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). The reasoning is based on analyzing the periodicity and piecewise linearity of the functions involved, reducing the problem to counting fixed points of a composed function over one fundamental domain. Therefore, the total number of intersection points of the given graphs is 16.

proposed answer: The entire piecewise solution process was comprehensive and methodical, involving detailed analysis of the functions y = h(x) and x = k(y), careful consideration of piecewise intervals, and verification of candidate solutions through substitution. The process included checks for boundary cases and domain consistency, which reduces the likelihood of missing solutions or counting extraneous ones. The iterative refinement and consistency checks performed in Sub-task 6c provide strong justification for the count of 16 intersection points. While the complexity of the problem means there is always a slight risk of overlooking subtle boundary cases, the thoroughness of the approach and the verification steps minimize this risk significantly. Therefore, the solution count of 16 intersection points is well supported and should be considered correct unless new evidence arises.

Answer:After a reflective review and critique of the entire piecewise solution process, including checks for missed breakpoints, domain inconsistencies, and counting errors, the solution count of 16 intersection points is fully justified and should be considered correct.
