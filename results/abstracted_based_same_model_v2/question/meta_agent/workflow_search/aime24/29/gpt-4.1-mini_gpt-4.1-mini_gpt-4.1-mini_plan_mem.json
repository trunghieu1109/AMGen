        "The number of distinct maximal valid placements equals the sum over all quadruples (r_w, r_b, c_w, c_b) with r_w + r_b \u2264 5, c_w + c_b \u2264 5, and satisfying r_w*c_w \u2264 25 and r_b*c_b \u2264 25, of the product C(5, r_w)*C(5 - r_w, r_b)*C(5, c_w)*C(5 - c_w, c_b). Each such quadruple corresponds to assigning r_w white rows, r_b black rows, c_w white columns, and c_b black columns; all intersections of same-color rows and columns are filled with chips, ensuring maximality. This formula comprehensively counts all valid maximal placements considering chip availability and maximality constraints.": "95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval: (0.0%, 0.0%), Median: 0.0%"
