Question: Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_10_9
proposed answer: The problem asks for the probability that Jen wins the grand prize given that she wins a prize. From the previous sub-tasks, the number of ways Jen can win the grand prize (all 4 numbers match) is 1. The number of ways Jen can win any prize (at least 2 numbers match) is 115. Therefore, the conditional probability is 1/115. This fraction is already in simplest form since 1 and 115 share no common factors other than 1. The problem asks for m+n where the probability is m/n, so m=1 and n=115, thus m+n=116.
