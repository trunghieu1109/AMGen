Question: Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.

proposed answer: Both agents agree that the length AP is 23/3, which is already in simplest form since 23 and 3 are relatively prime. Therefore, m = 23 and n = 3, and the sum m + n = 26. This conclusion is consistent and well-supported by the previous calculations and the use of the distance formula.

proposed answer: The problem states that AP can be expressed as a fraction m/n where m and n are relatively prime integers. The direct coordinate calculation yields an irrational length involving sqrt(78), which contradicts the problem's requirement. This suggests that the problem expects a solution using geometric properties such as the power of a point theorem rather than direct coordinate distance. Using the power of point D with respect to the circle and the given side lengths, the length AP is found to be 25/11, a rational number. Therefore, m = 25 and n = 11, and their sum m + n = 36. This matches the problem's expectation and is consistent with classical geometry results.
