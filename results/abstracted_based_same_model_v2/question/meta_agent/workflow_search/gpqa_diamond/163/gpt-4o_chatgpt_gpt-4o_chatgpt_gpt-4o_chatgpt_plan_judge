Question: Example(question='Astronomers are studying two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2. Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.', choice1='~ 0.4', choice2='~ 0.7', choice3='~ 0.6\n', choice4='~ 1.2', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_6_163
proposed answer: All agents agree that the total mass of system_1 is approximately 1.2 solar masses and the total mass of system_2 is approximately 2.0 solar masses. The factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2 is calculated as 1.2 / 2.0 = 0.6. This matches the choice labeled as C), which is '~ 0.6'. Therefore, the correct choice based on the calculated factor is C).

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_6_163
proposed answer: The sub-task 6 analysis concluded that system_1 is approximately 0.6 times as massive as system_2. This means that system_1 is less massive than system_2 by a factor of 0.6. All the debate agents agree on this conclusion, and the choice that corresponds to this factor is C) ~ 0.6. The justification is based on the calculated relative masses using the radial velocity amplitudes and orbital periods provided in the problem statement.
