The concentration of Co(SCN)₂ can be calculated using the formula [Co(SCN)₂] = β2 * [Co²⁺] * [SCN-]^2. Given that β2 is 40 and [SCN-] is 0.1 M, we substitute these values along with the free Co²⁺ concentration into the equation.

The concentration of Co(SCN)₂ is given by [Co(SCN)₂] = β2 * [Co²⁺] * [SCN-]^2.

Using β2 = 40 and [SCN-] = 0.1 M, we calculate [Co(SCN)₂]. After calculating the concentrations of all cobalt-containing species, we sum them to get the total concentration.
