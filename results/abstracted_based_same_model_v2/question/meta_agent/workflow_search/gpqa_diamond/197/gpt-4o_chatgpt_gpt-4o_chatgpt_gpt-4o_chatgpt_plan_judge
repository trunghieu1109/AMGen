proposed answer: The task is to determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, Co(SCN)2, among all cobalt-containing species in the solution. The total concentration of cobalt species is given as 10^-2 M. The concentration of Co(SCN)2 is calculated using the stability constant β2 = 40 and the concentration of SCN- = 0.1 M. The formula used is [Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co2+] * [SCN-]^2. The percentage of Co(SCN)2 is then calculated as ([Co(SCN)2] / total cobalt concentration) * 100%. From the previous analysis and calculations, the percentage of Co(SCN)2 was found to be 42.3%. All agents agree on this calculation, and it corresponds to choice B). Therefore, the final decision on the percentage calculation is 42.3%, which is choice B).

proposed answer: The task is to determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex (Co(SCN)₂) among all cobalt-containing species. The concentration of Co(SCN)₂ is calculated using the stability constant β2 = 40 and the concentrations of Co²⁺ and SCN⁻. The total concentration of cobalt species includes all complexes and free Co²⁺. The percentage is found by dividing the concentration of Co(SCN)₂ by the total concentration of cobalt species and multiplying by 100. Based on the sub-task answers, two agents (7CVD and vUtZ) agree on choice C) 25.6%, while the other two agents (1tFB and JySp) suggest 42.3%. The reasoning provided by agents 7CVD and vUtZ is more detailed and considers the mass balance and equilibrium conditions, leading to a more accurate calculation. Therefore, the final decision is to go with choice C) 25.6%.
