proposed answer: The task is to select the correct expression for the mass of the pseudo-Goldstone boson H_2 through radiative corrections. The expression should account for contributions from various particles, such as the Higgs boson (h_1), W and Z bosons, charged and neutral scalars (H^±, H^0, A^0), and singlet fermions (N_i). These contributions are typically proportional to the fourth power of the masses of these particles and divided by the symmetry breaking scale (x^2 + v^2). The correct expression should have the appropriate coefficients and signs for each contribution. The analysis indicates that choice A) matches the expected structure, as it includes the relevant mass terms and the correct overall factor. It also has the appropriate signs, with positive contributions from the W, Z, Higgs, and other scalars, and a negative contribution from the singlet fermions. Therefore, choice A) is the correct expression for the mass of the pseudo-Goldstone boson H_2.

proposed answer: The mass of the pseudo-Goldstone boson H_2 is derived from the one-loop effective potential, which includes contributions from various particles and fields. The potential is calculated using the Coleman-Weinberg formula, which involves the masses of particles that couple to the field associated with H_2. These contributions are typically proportional to the fourth power of the masses of these particles, divided by 8π^2. The contributions include those from the singlet fermions N_{iR}, the scalar-doublet S, the top quark, and other particles such as W and Z bosons. The top quark's contribution is significant and negative due to its large Yukawa coupling. The mass of H_2 is determined by the second derivative of the effective potential with respect to H_2. Comparing the given choices, we need to identify the correct terms that match the expected contributions from the effective potential. Choice 2 includes the negative contribution from the top quark, which aligns with the expected significant negative contribution due to its large Yukawa coupling. Therefore, choice 2 is the correct expression for the mass of the pseudo-Goldstone boson H_2.
