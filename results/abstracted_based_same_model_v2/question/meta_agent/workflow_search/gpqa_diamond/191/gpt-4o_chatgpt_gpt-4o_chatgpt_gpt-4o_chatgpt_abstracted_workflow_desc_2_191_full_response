Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Final Decision Agent r8fx', content='The problem involves a charge +q placed inside a cavity within a spherical conductor.

The presence of a charge inside the cavity will induce a charge distribution on the inner surface of the cavity, but this will not affect the outer surface of the conductor. The outer surface of the conductor will have a charge distribution that ensures the electric field outside the conductor is as if the entire charge were at the center of the conductor. This is due to the principle of superposition and the fact that the conductor will redistribute its charges to maintain electrostatic equilibrium.

According to electrostatic shielding, the electric field inside a conductor is zero, and the conductor redistributes its surface charge to maintain electrostatic equilibrium. The field outside the conductor behaves as if the entire charge were at the center of the conductor. Therefore, the electric field at a point outside the conductor is determined by the charge +q being effectively at the center, leading to an electric field magnitude of E = (1/(4 \\pi \\epsilon_0)) (q/L^2) at a distance L from the center of the conductor.
