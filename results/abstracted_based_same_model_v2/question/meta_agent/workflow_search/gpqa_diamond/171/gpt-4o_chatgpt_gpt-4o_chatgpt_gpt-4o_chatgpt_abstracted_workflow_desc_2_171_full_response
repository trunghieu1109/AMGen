The Boltzmann distribution relates the population of atoms in different energy states to the temperature of the system. The ratio of the number of atoms in two different energy states is given by the Boltzmann factor, which depends on the energy difference between the states and the temperature. The formula is: N_2/N_1 = (g_2/g_1) * exp(-ΔE/kT), where N_2 and N_1 are the populations of the excited and lower energy states, g_2 and g_1 are the statistical weights of these states, ΔE is the energy difference, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.

According to the Boltzmann distribution: N_2/N_1 = exp(-ΔE/kT), where k is the Boltzmann constant. Therefore, we have 2 = exp(-ΔE/kT_1) / exp(-ΔE/kT_2).

Using the Boltzmann distribution, the ratio of the number of atoms in the excited state for star_1 to star_2 is given by: N_2/N_1 = exp(-ΔE/kT_1) / exp(-ΔE/kT_2). This ratio is equal to 2, as stated. Thus, 2 = exp(-ΔE/kT_1) / exp(-ΔE/kT_2). This can be rewritten as: 2 = exp[(ΔE/k)(1/T_2 - 1/T_1)]. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides gives: ln(2) = (ΔE/k)(1/T_2 - 1/T_1).

The Boltzmann distribution gives the ratio of the number of atoms in two different energy states as N_2/N_1 = (g_2/g_1) * exp(-ΔE/kT), where ΔE is the energy difference between the states, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature. In this problem, we are given that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2 for a specific energy level, which means the ratio of the populations of the excited states is 2. Therefore, we have: N_2_star1/N_2_star2 = 2. Assuming the statistical weights (g_2/g_1) are the same for both stars, the ratio simplifies to exp(-ΔE/kT_1) / exp(-ΔE/kT_2) = 2. This can be rewritten as exp(-ΔE/kT_1 + ΔE/kT_2) = 2. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides gives: -ΔE/kT_1 + ΔE/kT_2 = ln(2). Rearranging terms, we find: ln(2) = ΔE/k * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1).

The equation ln(2) = (ΔE/k) * [(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)] is derived from the assumption that the photospheres are in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) and that the energy difference ΔE is known. The limitation of this equation is that it assumes LTE and that the only factor affecting the excitation of iron atoms is the temperature difference, without considering other possible factors such as pressure or magnetic fields.; answer: The correct equation is ln(2) = [(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)], which matches choice 4.\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent RSST, refining translation, thinking: From sub-task 2, we derived the relationship ln(2) = (ΔE/k)(1/T_2 - 1/T_1) using the Boltzmann distribution.
