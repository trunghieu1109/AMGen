The given choices are: A) ℏ, B) ℏ/2, C) ℏ/√2, and D) √2ℏ. Comparing the calculated value with the choices, the correct match is C) ℏ/√2.; answer: C)\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent Gg1H, round 0, comparing uncertainty ΔP_z, thinking: The calculated uncertainty ΔP_z from the previous sub-task is ℏ/√2. Comparing this value with the given choices, we have: Choice 1: ℏ, Choice 2: ℏ/2, Choice 3: ℏ/√2, and Choice 4: √2ℏ. The calculated value matches exactly with Choice 3 (ℏ/√2). Therefore, the correct answer is Choice 3.; answer: C)\n<SEPERATOR>\nFinal Decision agent, determining correct answer, thinking: The calculated uncertainty ΔP_z is ℏ/√2, as determined from the expectation values <P_z> = 0 and <P_z^2> = ℏ^2/2. This matches exactly with choice C) ℏ/√2. All agents agree on this calculation and comparison, confirming that the correct answer is C).; answer: C)", iteration_idx=-1)]
