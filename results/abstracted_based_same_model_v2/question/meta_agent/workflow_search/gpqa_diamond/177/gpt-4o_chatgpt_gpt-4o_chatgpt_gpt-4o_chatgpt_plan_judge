proposed answer: In quantum field theory, a theory is considered renormalizable if the coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. This is because non-negative mass dimensions ensure that the divergences can be absorbed by a finite number of counterterms. In the given Lagrangian, the mass dimension of \(\kappa\) is \(-1\), which is negative. A negative mass dimension indicates that the coupling constant grows with energy, leading to non-renormalizable behavior. Therefore, the theory is not renormalizable.
