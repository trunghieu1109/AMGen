This is because only terms with non-negative mass dimensions can lead to a finite number of divergences that can be absorbed by a finite number of counterterms. In this problem, the mass dimension of \\(\\kappa\\) is \\(-1\\), which is negative. This implies that the interaction term with \\(\\kappa\\) introduces non-renormalizable divergences, as it requires an infinite number of counterterms to absorb these divergences. Therefore, the theory is not renormalizable.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent fkqX:\nIn quantum field theory, a theory is considered renormalizable if the mass dimension of the coupling constant in the interaction term is non-negative. This is because a non-negative mass dimension ensures that the coupling constant does not introduce divergences that cannot be absorbed by a finite number of counterterms. In this problem, the mass dimension of \\(\\kappa\\) is found to be -1. A negative mass dimension indicates that the coupling constant grows with energy, leading to non-renormalizable behavior. Therefore, the theory is not renormalizable.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent uRWG:\nIn quantum field theory, a theory is considered renormalizable if the coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. The mass dimension of the coupling constant \\(\\kappa\\) was determined to be \\(-1\\). A negative mass dimension for a coupling constant indicates that the theory is non-renormalizable because it implies that the coupling becomes stronger at higher energies, leading to divergences that cannot be absorbed by a finite number of counterterms. Therefore, since \\(\\kappa\\) has a mass dimension of \\(-1\\), the theory is not renormalizable.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent C4UB:\nIn quantum field theory, a theory is considered renormalizable if all the coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. This is because, in a renormalizable theory, the divergences that appear at higher orders in perturbation theory can be absorbed by a finite number of counterterms. In the given Lagrangian, the mass dimension of \\(\\kappa\\) is -1, as determined in the previous sub-task. A negative mass dimension for a coupling constant indicates a non-renormalizable theory because it suggests that new divergences will appear at each order of perturbation theory, requiring an infinite number of counterterms to absorb them.
