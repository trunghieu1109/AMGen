It is widely used in organic synthesis to form carbon-carbon bonds. However, the reaction has some limitations. One limitation is that the reaction conditions must be carefully controlled to avoid side reactions, such as polymerization or over-addition. Additionally, the choice of nucleophile and electrophile can greatly affect the reaction outcome, and not all combinations will lead to successful Michael additions. Steric and electronic factors can also influence the reactivity and selectivity of the reaction.; answer: The Michael addition is a useful reaction for forming carbon-carbon bonds, but it requires careful control of reaction conditions and choice of reactants to avoid side reactions and ensure successful addition.\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent VPC3, refining Michael addition, thinking: In a Michael addition, the nucleophile attacks the β-carbon of an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound.
