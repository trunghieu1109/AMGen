Question: Example(question='You identified a new quorum-sensing peptide in the bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus. You are highly interested if its role in intercellular communication is conserved among the eukaryotes. You treat yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with the peptide and interestingly observe the formation of the shmoo. You want to learn about the proteome of the active chromatin in the shmoo and recover it by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. The least of proteins from which complex below will you observe in your assay?', choice1='pre-initiation complex', choice2='pre-replication complex', choice3='enhancer protein complex', choice4='nucleosome histone complex', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_2_151
proposed answer: The task is to determine which protein complex is least likely to be observed in an assay focused on the proteome of active chromatin in the shmoo structure of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The shmoo formation is associated with mating and involves transcriptional activation. Therefore, protein complexes involved in transcription, such as the pre-initiation complex and enhancer protein complexes, are expected to be present. The nucleosome histone complex is a fundamental component of chromatin and will be present in both active and inactive chromatin. The pre-replication complex, however, is involved in DNA replication, not transcription, and is not directly relevant to the transcriptional changes associated with shmoo formation. Thus, the pre-replication complex is the least likely to be observed in the assay.
