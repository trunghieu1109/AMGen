The minimum energy configuration for the 12 charges on the sphere is likely a regular icosahedral configuration, because it is known to be one of the most stable configurations for distributing equal charges on a sphere, minimizing the potential energy. The pairwise distances between the charges in an icosahedral configuration are not all the same, but they are optimized to minimize the energy. The potential energy between two charges is given by U = k * q1 * q2 / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, q1 and q2 are the charges, and r is the distance between them. With 12 charges, there are 66 pairwise interactions. We calculate the energy for each pair and sum them up to find the total potential energy. The energy is minimized due to the symmetry of the icosahedral configuration.
