Question: Example(question='Consider an aperture, which shapes like a N-sided polygon. All the apothems are of the same length a. When a monochromatic light (of wavelength \\lambda), travelling along z-axis, falls vertically on this aperture, it creates a series of intensity maxima and minima in the far field region. What is the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large ? Assume that the related angles are small so that tan theta = theta approximation can be taken.', choice1='1.220 \\lambda /a ', choice2='0.610 \\lambda / a', choice3='0.500 \\lambda / a', choice4='0.506 \\lambda / a', correct_index=4)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_5_159
proposed answer: The calculated angular distance between the first two minima for a circular aperture, when N is infinitely large, is 1.22 * λ / a. This matches the choice '1.220 \lambda /a' given in the original question. Therefore, the correct answer is choice A).

Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_5_159
proposed answer: The calculated angular distance between the first two minima for a circular aperture is Δθ = 1.22 * λ / (2a). This matches choice A) 1.220 λ / a, as the calculation shows that the angular distance is half of 1.22 λ / a, which is consistent with the given choice A). Therefore, the correct answer is A).
