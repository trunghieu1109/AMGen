Question: Example(question='Compound X, which has the following IR and NMR data, reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Identify the final product.\nIR: 3400â€“2500 cm-1, 1720 cm-1, 1610 cm-1, 1450 cm-1\n1H NMR: 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H), 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H), 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).', choice1='1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene', choice2='4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid', choice3='2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid', choice4='1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_5_196
proposed answer: All agents agree that the reaction of Compound X with red phosphorus and HI results in the reduction of the carboxylic acid group to a methyl group, forming 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. The IR and NMR data suggest the presence of a carboxylic acid group, which is consistent with 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. The reduction reaction specifically targets the carboxylic acid group, converting it to a methyl group while leaving the aromatic structure intact. This matches choice A) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.
