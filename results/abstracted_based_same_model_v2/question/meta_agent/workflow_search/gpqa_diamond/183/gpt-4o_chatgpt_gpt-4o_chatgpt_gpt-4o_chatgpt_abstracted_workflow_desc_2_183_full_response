In the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, the tert-butyl group is introduced first. It is a strong ortho/para director due to its electron-donating nature through hyperconjugation. This means that when the tert-butyl group is on the benzene ring, it will direct incoming electrophiles to the ortho and para positions relative to itself. The nitro group is introduced next, and it is a strong meta director because it is electron-withdrawing through resonance and inductive effects. However, since the tert-butyl group is already present, the nitro group will be directed to the position that is ortho to the tert-butyl group, which is consistent with the target structure. Finally, the ethoxy group is introduced, which is also an ortho/para director due to its electron-donating resonance effect. The ethoxy group will occupy the position that is ortho to the nitro group, which is the 1-position in the target compound. The sequence of introducing the tert-butyl group first, followed by the nitro group, and finally the ethoxy group, ensures that the substituents are in the correct positions for the target compound. However, the evaluation should also consider steric effects, especially with bulky groups like tert-butyl, which might influence the substitution pattern.

The tert-butyl group is a strong ortho/para director due to its electron-donating nature through hyperconjugation.

The nitro group, on the other hand, is a strong meta director because it is electron-withdrawing through resonance and inductive effects.
