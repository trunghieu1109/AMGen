Question: Example(question='In the lab, a chemist discovers an unnamed bottle with a white solid inside. He gathers the following spectral information in order to identify the liquid. Make a reasonable structural suggestion for the unidentified drug using the information provided.\nMass: molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 (100%)\na peak at m/z = 158 (32%)\nIR : broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1, strong sharp peak at 1720 cm-1\n1H NMR: 11.0 ppm (s, 1H), 8.02 ppm (d, 2H), 7.72 (d, 2H)', choice1='4-chlorobenzoic acid', choice2='2-chlorobenzoic acid', choice3='3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde\n', choice4='Phenyl chloroformate', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: The spectral data provided includes mass spectrometry, IR, and 1H NMR data. The mass spectrometry data shows a molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 and a peak at m/z = 158, indicating the presence of a chlorine atom due to its isotopic pattern. The IR spectrum shows a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1, which is characteristic of an O-H stretch, likely from a carboxylic acid, and a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1, consistent with a C=O stretch. The 1H NMR data shows a singlet at 11.0 ppm, indicative of a carboxylic acid proton, and two doublets at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm, suggesting an aromatic system, particularly a para-substituted benzene ring. Among the given choices, 4-chlorobenzoic acid fits all these criteria: it has a molecular weight of 156, contains a chlorine atom, has a carboxylic acid group (explaining both the IR and NMR data), and the aromatic protons would show the NMR pattern observed. Therefore, the best match is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.
