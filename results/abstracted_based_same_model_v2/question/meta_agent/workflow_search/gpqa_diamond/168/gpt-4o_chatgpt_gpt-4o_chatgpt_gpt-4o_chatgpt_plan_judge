Question: Example(question='You are studying a nuclear decay which converts two heavy nucleons of flavor A to another flavor B, while simultaneously emitting two much lighter particles E and V. In short, 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V. It is known that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous, with some endpoint value Q.\n\nA variant of this decay emits one exotic, massless particle M instead of the 2V. In this case, how does the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles compare to that of the original decay?', choice1='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint increases.', choice2='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases.', choice3='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.', choice4='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint decreases.', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: In the original decay, the energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous because the two V particles can share the energy in various ways, leading to a continuous distribution. The endpoint Q is determined by the maximum energy the E particles can have when the V particles carry the least energy. In the variant decay, a single massless particle M replaces the 2V particles. The energy spectrum remains continuous because the energy distribution can still vary between the E particles and M. However, since there is less energy being carried away by the single massless particle M compared to the two V particles, the endpoint of the spectrum increases. Therefore, the correct choice is that the spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.
