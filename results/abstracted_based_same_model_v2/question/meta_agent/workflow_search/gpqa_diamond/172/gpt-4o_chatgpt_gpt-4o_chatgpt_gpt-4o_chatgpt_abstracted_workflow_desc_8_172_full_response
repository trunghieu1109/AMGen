We are given Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 * 10^(-9) m. The reduced Planck's constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718 * 10^(-34) J·s.

The uncertainty in momentum (Δp) was given as 5.27 * 10^(-25) kg·m/s, and the velocity (v) of the electron is 2 * 10^8 m/s. Multiplying these gives ΔE ≈ 1.054 * 10^(-16) J, which matches choice C) ~10^(-16) J. The limitation of this calculation is that it assumes the uncertainty in energy is directly related to the uncertainty in momentum through the velocity, which is a simplification.
