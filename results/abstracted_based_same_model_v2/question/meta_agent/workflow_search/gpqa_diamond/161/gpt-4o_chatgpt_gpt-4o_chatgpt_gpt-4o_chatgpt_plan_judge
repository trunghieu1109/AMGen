proposed answer: The metric given describes a pseudosphere, which is a surface of constant negative curvature. The area of such a surface can be calculated by integrating the area element over the region defined by the metric. However, due to the singularity at the boundary where x^2 + y^2 = 4, the integral diverges, leading to an infinite area. Therefore, the correct choice that represents this infinite area is A) +âˆž.
