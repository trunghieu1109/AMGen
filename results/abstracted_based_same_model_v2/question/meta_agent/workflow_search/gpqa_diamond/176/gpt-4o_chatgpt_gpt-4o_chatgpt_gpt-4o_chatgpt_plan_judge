Question: Example(question='Astronomers are interested in the luminosities of two stars. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2. The mass of Star_1 is also larger by the same factor (1.5 times). Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same. Astronomers also calculated the radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:', choice1='~2.25', choice2='~2.35', choice3='~2.32', choice4='~2.23\n', correct_index=4)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_57_176
proposed answer: The luminosity of a star is determined by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law: L = 4πR²σT⁴. Since both stars have the same peak wavelength, they have the same temperature. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, so its luminosity is (1.5)^2 = 2.25 times greater than that of Star_2. The radial velocity does not affect the intrinsic luminosity. Therefore, the factor by which Star_1's luminosity is greater is 2.25, which corresponds to choice A).

proposed answer: The luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law: L = 4πR²σT⁴. Since both stars have the same peak wavelength, they have the same temperature. The only factor that affects their luminosity is their radius. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2. Therefore, the luminosity of Star_1 is (1.5)² = 2.25 times that of Star_2. The radial velocity does not affect the intrinsic luminosity, as it only affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. Thus, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of 2.25. This matches choice A).
