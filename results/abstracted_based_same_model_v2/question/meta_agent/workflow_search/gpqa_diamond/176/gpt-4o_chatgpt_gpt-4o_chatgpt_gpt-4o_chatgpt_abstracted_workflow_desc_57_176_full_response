This implies that any Doppler shift for Star_2 has been accounted for, or is negligible, meaning the intrinsic wavelengths are the same for both stars.

For black bodies, the luminosity L is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law: L = 4πR^2σT^4, where R is the radius, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature. Since the temperatures of the stars are the same, the luminosity ratio depends only on the square of the radius ratio.

The temperature T is the same for both stars as they have the same peak wavelength, implying the same temperature. Therefore, the luminosity depends on the square of the radius. Since the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2, the luminosity due to radius is (1.5)^2 = 2.25 times. The mass-luminosity relationship is not directly relevant here because it is not given how mass affects luminosity in this context. The problem focuses on radius and temperature, not mass.

Since the stars have the same peak wavelength, they have the same temperature (T). Therefore, the luminosity depends on the square of the radius. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2. Thus, the luminosity of Star_1 is (1.5)² = 2.25 times that of Star_2. The mass does not directly affect the luminosity in this context, as the problem focuses on radius and temperature.

Luminosity is a measure of the total energy output of a star per unit time and is determined by the star's radius and temperature, as given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law: L = 4πR²σT⁴. In this problem, the radial velocity of Star_2 is 700 km/s, which means it is moving relative to the observer, but this does not change its intrinsic luminosity. The problem states that the stars have the same peak wavelength, indicating they have the same temperature. Therefore, the radial velocity does not impact the luminosity calculation. The factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 is determined solely by the ratio of their radii, which is 1.5, leading to a luminosity factor of 2.25.

This directly implies a simple multiplicative relationship between the corresponding parameters of the two stars. Specifically, if the radius of Star_2 is R, then the radius of Star_1 is 1.5R. Similarly, if the mass of Star_2 is M, then the mass of Star_1 is 1.5M. This means that both the radius and mass of Star_1 are 1.5 times those of Star_2.; answer: The radius and mass of Star_1 are both 1.5 times those of Star_2.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent stJl, determining relationship, thinking: The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2, and the mass of Star_1 is also 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2. This means that if we denote the radius of Star_2 as R_2 and the mass of Star_2 as M_2, then the radius of Star_1, R_1, is 1.5 * R_2, and the mass of Star_1, M_1, is 1.5 * M_2. Therefore, the relationship between the radius and mass of Star_1 and Star_2 is that both the radius and the mass of Star_1 are 1.5 times those of Star_2.; answer: The radius and mass of Star_1 are both 1.5 times larger than those of Star_2.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent aUzN, determining relationship, thinking: The problem states that both the radius and mass of Star_1 are 1.5 times larger than those of Star_2.

For Star_2, which has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, the observed peak wavelength might be shifted due to this velocity. However, the problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same, indicating that any Doppler shift has already been accounted for in the observation. This implies that the intrinsic wavelengths, and thus the temperatures, of the two stars are the same. Since the peak wavelengths are the same, according to Wien's Law, the stars have the same temperature.; answer: The stars have the same temperature.\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent S08D, round 0, applying Doppler corrections, thinking: The Doppler effect relates the observed wavelength \\( \\lambda_{obs} \\) to the intrinsic wavelength \\( \\lambda_{rest} \\) through the equation \\( \\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{rest} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}} \\), where \\( v \\) is the radial velocity and \\( c \\) is the speed of light. For Star_1, with a radial velocity of 0 km/s, the observed wavelength equals the intrinsic wavelength. For Star_2, with a radial velocity of 700 km/s, the observed wavelength is slightly shifted. However, the problem states that the peak wavelengths observed for both stars are the same, which implies that the intrinsic wavelengths must also be the same. This indicates that both stars have the same temperature according to Wien's Law, which relates peak wavelength to temperature.; answer: The intrinsic wavelengths are the same, indicating the same temperature for both stars.\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent if00, round 0, applying Doppler corrections, thinking: The Doppler effect causes shifts in the observed wavelength of light from a star depending on its radial velocity. The formula for the Doppler shift is λ_observed = λ_rest * (1 + v/c), where v is the radial velocity and c is the speed of light. For Star_1, with a radial velocity of 0 km/s, the observed wavelength is the same as the intrinsic wavelength. For Star_2, with a radial velocity of 700 km/s, we calculate the shift: λ_observed = λ_rest * (1 + 700/300,000). However, the problem states that the peak wavelengths observed are the same for both stars. This implies that any Doppler shift for Star_2 is negligible in terms of affecting the peak wavelength significantly, or it has been accounted for in the observations. Therefore, the intrinsic wavelengths are effectively the same, suggesting the stars have the same temperature according to Wien's Law.; answer: The stars have the same temperature, as any Doppler shift is negligible or accounted for, keeping the peak wavelengths effectively the same.\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent Vgtt, round 0, applying Doppler corrections, thinking: The Doppler effect is used to correct the observed wavelengths based on the radial velocity of the stars. The formula for the Doppler shift in wavelength is given by \\( \\lambda' = \\lambda (1 + \\frac{v}{c}) \\), where \\( \\lambda' \\) is the observed wavelength, \\( \\lambda \\) is the intrinsic wavelength, \\( v \\) is the radial velocity, and \\( c \\) is the speed of light. For Star_1, with a radial velocity of 0 km/s, the observed wavelength is the same as the intrinsic wavelength. For Star_2, with a radial velocity of 700 km/s, the wavelength correction would be \\( \\lambda' = \\lambda (1 + \\frac{700}{299792}) \\approx \\lambda (1 + 0.00234) \\). This small correction indicates that the intrinsic wavelength for Star_2 is slightly shorter than the observed wavelength. However, since the difference is very small, and the problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same, we can conclude that the temperatures are effectively the same for practical purposes. Therefore, the stars have the same temperature.; answer: The stars have the same temperature.\n<SEPERATOR>\nFinal Decision agent, verifying temperature, thinking: The problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same.

For black bodies, the luminosity L is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law: L = 4πR^2σT^4, where R is the radius, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature. Since the temperatures of the stars are the same, the luminosity ratio depends only on the square of the radius ratio.

According to the Stefan-Boltzmann Law, the luminosity L of a star is proportional to the surface area (4πR^2) and the fourth power of its temperature (T^4). Since the stars have the same temperature, the luminosity depends on the surface area, which is proportional to the square of the radius. Therefore, the luminosity ratio due to radius is (1.5)^2 = 2.25. The mass-luminosity relationship is not directly relevant here because the problem focuses on black body radiation, which depends on radius and temperature, not mass. The mass affects the star's structure and evolution but not the immediate black body luminosity calculation.

Here, L is the luminosity, R is the radius, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature. Since both stars have the same temperature (as they peak at the same wavelength), the luminosity depends on the radius squared. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2, so the luminosity of Star_1 is (1.5)^2 = 2.25 times that of Star_2.
