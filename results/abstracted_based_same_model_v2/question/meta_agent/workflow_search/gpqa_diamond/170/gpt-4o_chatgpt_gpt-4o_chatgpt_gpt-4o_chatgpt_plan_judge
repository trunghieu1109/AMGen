proposed answer: To determine the order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer, we need to consider both the directing effects of the substituents and their reactivity towards electrophilic substitution. Activating groups like CH3 and C2H5 are ortho/para-directing and increase the yield of para-isomers. Deactivating groups like NO2, COOH, and COOC2H5 are meta-directing, reducing the yield of para-isomers. Cl is ortho/para-directing but is a deactivating group. Based on the reactivity order (5 > 1 > 3 > 6 > 2 > 4) and directing effects, the para-isomer yield will be highest for activating ortho/para-directors (5, 1), followed by less activating ortho/para-directors (3), and lowest for meta-directors (6, 2, 4). Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is: 4 (NO2, meta-directing, least para) < 2 (COOC2H5, meta-directing) < 6 (COOH, meta-directing) < 3 (Cl, ortho/para-directing) < 1 (CH3, ortho/para-directing, more activating) < 5 (C2H5, ortho/para-directing, most activating). This matches the order given by agents px4o, rGHL, and W2rL, which is 4<2<6<3<1<5.
