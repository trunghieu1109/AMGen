proposed answer: The Hamiltonian operator H = ε σ.n has eigenvalues ±ε, as determined by the properties of the Pauli matrices and the unit vector n. The eigenvalues of the operator σ.n are ±1, and since the Hamiltonian is H = ε σ.n, the eigenvalues of H are ε times the eigenvalues of σ.n, which results in ±ε. Comparing this with the given choices: Choice 1 is '+ ε, -ε', which matches the calculated eigenvalues. Choice 2 is '+ε ħ/2, - ε ħ/2', which does not match. Choice 3 is '+1, -1', which does not match. Choice 4 is '+ħ/2, -ħ/2', which does not match. Therefore, the correct choice is A).
