proposed answer: The task is to determine how many stars are detectable using the ESPRESSO spectrograph. According to the analysis, Canopus and Polaris are very bright and easily detectable. Star c, with an apparent magnitude of 15, is within the detectable range. Star e, with an apparent magnitude of 13.495, is also detectable. However, Star d and Star f are too faint with apparent magnitudes of 21.505 and 18.495, respectively, and are not detectable. Therefore, the total number of detectable stars is 4, which matches choice A).

proposed answer: Based on the analysis, Canopus, Polaris, Star c, and Star e are detectable with the ESPRESSO spectrograph. Canopus and Polaris are very bright stars, and Star c and Star e have apparent magnitudes that allow them to achieve the required signal-to-noise ratio. Stars d and f are too faint. Therefore, 4 stars meet the detectability criteria.
