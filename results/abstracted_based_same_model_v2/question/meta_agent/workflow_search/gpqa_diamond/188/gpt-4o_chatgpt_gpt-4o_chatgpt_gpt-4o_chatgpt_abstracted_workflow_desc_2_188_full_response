In physics, this often leads to the emergence of 'effective particles' or quasiparticles that are associated with the broken symmetry. For example, magnons are associated with the breaking of spin rotational symmetry in magnets, pions are associated with the breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics, and phonons are associated with the breaking of translational symmetry in crystals.

Pions are associated with the breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics, as they are the Goldstone bosons of this broken symmetry.

Skyrmions are indeed topological solitons and are not directly linked to the concept of spontaneously-broken symmetry like magnons, pions, and phonons are. The limitation of this determination is that it assumes a specific context where Skyrmions are not considered as arising from symmetry breaking, which might not cover all theoretical frameworks or interpretations.
