proposed answer: The pp-III branch of the solar proton-proton chain is responsible for producing high-energy neutrinos, typically in the MeV range, which is much higher than the 700-900 keV range. The neutrinos in the 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV bands are primarily produced by the pp-I and pp-II branches. Since the pp-III branch does not contribute to the flux in these energy bands, stopping it would not affect the flux ratio between these two bands. Therefore, the flux ratio between the 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV bands remains unchanged. The most logical choice for the flux ratio, given that the pp-III branch does not contribute to these bands, is 1.

proposed answer: The pp-III branch of solar fusion reactions primarily produces high-energy neutrinos, typically above 1 MeV. The neutrinos in the 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV energy bands are more likely from the pp-II branch, particularly from the decay of beryllium-7. Since the pp-III branch does not significantly contribute to the neutrino flux in these energy bands, stopping the pp-III branch would have a negligible impact on the overall neutrino flux in these bands. Therefore, the ratio of flux (band 1) / flux (band 2) is primarily determined by the pp-II branch and remains largely unchanged. The flux ratio between the two bands is approximately 1, as the pp-III branch does not affect these bands.
