The probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue is given by the square of the absolute value of the projection of the state vector onto the corresponding eigenvector. First, we find the eigenvalues of P by solving the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0. The matrix P is symmetric, so it has real eigenvalues. Solving the characteristic equation, we find the eigenvalues are λ1 = √2, λ2 = 0, and λ3 = -√2. The eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 is v2 = (1/√2, 0, -1/√2). The initial state vector is (-1, 2, 1). We project this state onto the eigenvector v2 and calculate the probability. The projection is given by the dot product: projection = ((-1, 2, 1) • (1/√2, 0, -1/√2)) = (-1/√2 - 1/√2) = -√2/√2 = -1.
