Question: Example(question='There has been an outbreak of an viral infectious disease in your city. You have been asked to design a molecular diagnostic kit for quick detection of this retrovirus. How would you go about designing this kit?', choice1='First you identify the virus by performing DNA sequencing. You then develop a PCR kit for  quick and accurate diagnosis', choice2='First you identify the IgG antibodies for the infection. You then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG antibodies for quick \n and accurate diagnosis.', choice3='First you identify the virus using the information about the symptoms, provided by the affected patients. You then design a nested PCR kit based on the information for quick diagnosis.', choice4='First you identify the virus by performing cDNA sequencing.  You then develop a real time PCR kit for quick and accurate diagnosis.', correct_index=4)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_10_156
proposed answer: The final decision on the PCR kit design should be based on the most effective method for detecting a retrovirus, which is an RNA virus that reverse transcribes into DNA. The original question provides four choices for designing a diagnostic kit. Choice 4 involves identifying the virus by performing cDNA sequencing and then developing a real-time PCR kit. This approach is appropriate for retroviruses because it involves converting the viral RNA into cDNA, which can then be amplified and detected using real-time PCR. This method is known for its high sensitivity and specificity, making it suitable for quick and accurate diagnosis. The sub-task responses from the debate agents consistently support choice D, which aligns with the use of cDNA sequencing and real-time PCR. Therefore, the final decision should be to proceed with this method, as it is well-suited for detecting retroviruses and has been refined based on evaluation results to ensure optimal performance.
