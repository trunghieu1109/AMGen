proposed answer: The derived expression for the maximum speed of a relativistic harmonic oscillator is v_max = c sqrt(1 - (1/(1 + kA^2/(2mc^2))^2)). This expression is obtained by equating the potential energy at maximum amplitude, (1/2)kA^2, with the relativistic kinetic energy at maximum speed, mc^2/sqrt{1-v_max^2/c^2}. Solving for v_max gives the expression that matches choice 2. All agents agree that this matches choice 2, which is B). Therefore, the correct option is choice B).
