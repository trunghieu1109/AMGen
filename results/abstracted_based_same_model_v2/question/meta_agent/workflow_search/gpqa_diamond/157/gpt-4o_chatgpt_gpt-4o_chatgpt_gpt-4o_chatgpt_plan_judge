Question: Example(question='In an inactive state, a transcription factor subunit awaits an activation signal from the membrane phosphorylation cascade. Upon phosphorylation on the Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, shuttles into the nucleus, and serves in gene transcription. A missense mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. You observe that a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Which of the following molecular phenotypes is most likely observed in the presence of mutation Y?', choice1='loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype', choice2='protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype', choice3='protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele', choice4='change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: The question describes a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain that acts as a dominant-negative mutation. This means that the mutant protein can interfere with the function of the wild-type protein. Since the transcription factor requires dimerization for its function, the presence of mutation Y likely disrupts the formation of functional dimers. A common result of dominant-negative mutations is that the mutant protein can still bind to the wild-type protein, but the resulting complex is non-functional, leading to a loss-of-function phenotype. This often results in protein aggregation, as the mutant protein forms aggregates with the wild-type protein that are non-functional. Therefore, the most consistent molecular phenotype with a dominant-negative effect in this context is 'protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype', which matches choice B).
