The (E)-alkene will form an epoxide where the oxygen is added syn to the original double bond, resulting in a single stereoisomer. The stereochemistry of the epoxide will be such that the two substituents on the original double bond are on opposite sides of the epoxide ring, leading to a trans-epoxide. Therefore, the epoxide formed from (E)-oct-4-ene will be a trans-epoxide.; answer - The epoxide formed from (E)-oct-4-ene is a trans-epoxide.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - The epoxide formed from (E)-oct-4-ene is a trans-epoxide. When this trans-epoxide is treated with aqueous acid, it undergoes anti-dihydroxylation, which means the opening of the epoxide ring occurs in an anti fashion. This results in the formation of a diol where the hydroxyl groups are added to opposite sides of the original double bond plane. Therefore, the diol product from the trans-epoxide will be a meso compound, as the two hydroxyl groups will be on opposite sides, leading to internal symmetry.; answer - The diol product from the trans-epoxide is a meso compound.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - When (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equivalent of mCPBA, it undergoes syn epoxidation to form an epoxide. The (Z)-alkene has the substituents on the same side, so the epoxidation will occur from the same side, leading to a cis-epoxide.

When this epoxide is treated with aqueous acid, it undergoes anti-opening to form a diol. Anti-opening means that the nucleophile (water, in this case) attacks the less hindered carbon of the epoxide from the opposite side of the epoxide ring. Since the epoxide is cis, the anti-opening will result in a trans-diol.
