Question: Example(question='An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. A spontaneous fission occurs in which it splits into two fragments (and nothing else), such that one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other (in terms of their rest-masses). The sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. \n\nKinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?\n\n(Ignore the electrons.)', choice1='10 MeV.', choice2='5 MeV.', choice3='2 MeV.', choice4='20 MeV.', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_47_173
proposed answer: In sub-task 6, the calculated difference between the relativistic T1 value and the classical T1 value was found to be 0 MeV. However, none of the provided options (10 MeV, 5 MeV, 2 MeV, 20 MeV) match this result. The Chain-of-Thought Agent tNMZ suggested that the closest reasonable choice, assuming a small error in the classical approximation or the problem setup, would be 2 MeV. Therefore, based on the reasoning provided, the selected choice is C).

proposed answer: In sub-task 7, the difference between the relativistic kinetic energy and the classical kinetic energy of the more massive fragment was calculated to be 10 MeV. This matches choice A) 10 MeV. Therefore, the correct choice for sub-task 8, based on the calculated difference, is A).
