Assuming the rest wavelength of the peak is in the optical range, let's consider a typical emission line such as the Lyman-alpha line, which has a rest wavelength of 121.6 nm. The redshift z can be calculated using the formula: z = (observed wavelength / rest wavelength) - 1. If we assume the rest wavelength is 121.6 nm, then z = (790 / 121.6) - 1 ≈ 5.5.

For z ≈ 5.5, this integral can be numerically evaluated. Typically, for high redshifts like z ≈ 5.5, the comoving distance is several gigaparsecs.

The universe is flat, so Ωk = 0. The comoving distance D_C can be calculated using the formula: D_C = c/H0 * integral from 0 to z of dz'/E(z'), where E(z) = sqrt(Ωm(1+z)^3 + ΩΛ). For z ≈ 5.5, this integral can be numerically evaluated to find the comoving distance. Typically, for high redshifts like z ≈ 5.5, the comoving distance is several gigaparsecs.

The method involves integrating the inverse of the Hubble parameter over redshift, which is standard for determining comoving distances in cosmology. However, the limitation is that the exact value of the comoving distance depends on the precise numerical integration of the function E(z) = sqrt(Ωm(1+z)^3 + ΩΛ), and small errors in the integration can lead to different results. Additionally, the redshift value z ≈ 5.5 is an approximation, and any uncertainty in the redshift will affect the calculated distance. The choice of 8 Gpc is reasonable given the parameters, but without performing the exact numerical integration, it is difficult to confirm the precise value.; answer: The comoving distance is approximately 8 Gpc for z ≈ 5.5 in a Lambda-CDM universe with the given parameters.\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent ftH3, refining comoving distance, thinking: To determine the comoving distance of the quasar from Earth, we use the redshift z ≈ 5.5 and the Lambda-CDM model parameters: Hubble constant H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc, matter density parameter Ωm = 0.3, and dark energy density parameter ΩΛ = 0.7.
