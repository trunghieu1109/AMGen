    <pre>Related original question:

Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$..

### Sub-task 4: Based on the output of sub-task 3, simplify the expression for the difference and find the sum of the numerator and denominator when expressed as a fraction in simplest form. 

 ### thinking by Debate Agent pAsJ:
The previous sub-task derivation suggested an answer of 300 for the difference, expressed as a fraction. However, because the full derivation (solving (6+3cosθ)² + (3sinθ)² = 121 together with the collinearity condition) is incomplete, this answer is based on an earlier best guess. Therefore, additional work is needed to fully justify the result. Given the incomplete derivation, I provide 300 as the best answer while marking the response [TOO_HARD] and suggesting further decomposition.

### thinking by Debate Agent jhTm:
The available derivation led to a best guess of 300 for m+n, but the full justification is incomplete. A rigorous derivation would require solving (6+3cosθ)² + (3sinθ)² = 121 and enforcing that the vector from the sphere&#39;s center to the torus is parallel to the torus generating circle’s radial vector. Without these additional steps, 300 remains our best available answer albeit with insufficient justification. Therefore, I mark it as [TOO_HARD] and recommend further decomposition of the problem.

### answer by Debate Agent pAsJ:
300
[TOO_HARD]
Suggestion: Develop a full algebraic derivation by explicitly solving (6+3cosθ)²+(3sinθ)² = 121 and enforcing the collinearity between (6+3cosθ, 3sinθ) and (3cosθ, 3sinθ) to determine the exact values of r_i and r_o, and then simplify r_i - r_o as a fraction.

Suggestion: Further decompose by explicitly solving (6+3cosθ)² + (3sinθ)² = 121 and enforcing collinearity between (6+3cosθ, 3sinθ) and (3cosθ, 3sinθ) to extract the values of r_i and r_o, then express r_i - r_o in simplest fractional form.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Based on the output of sub-task 3, simplify the expression for the difference and find the sum of the numerator and denominator when expressed as a fraction in simplest form.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry (for example, 300
[TOO_HARD]
Suggestion:...) and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>The original derivation was incomplete, and the best guess from the previous sub-tasks was that m+n equals 300. Since the full algebraic steps (including solving (6+3cosθ)²+(3sinθ)² = 121 and enforcing collinearity between (6+3cosθ, 3sinθ) and (3cosθ, 3sinθ)) are not fully developed, the simplified fractional expression has not been rigorously confirmed. Nonetheless, based on the available output, the answer 300 is the best available estimate.

Answer:300
[TOO_HARD]
Suggestion: Develop a complete derivation by explicitly solving (6+3cosθ)²+(3sinθ)² = 121 and enforcing the collinearity condition to determine the exact values of the inner and outer tangency circles, and verify that the difference r_i - r_o simplifies to a fraction with m+n = 300.</pre>
