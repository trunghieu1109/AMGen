Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: The original derivation was incomplete, and the best guess from the previous sub-tasks was that m+n equals 300. Since the full algebraic steps (including solving (6+3cosθ)²+(3sinθ)² = 121 and enforcing collinearity between (6+3cosθ, 3sinθ) and (3cosθ, 3sinθ)) are not fully developed, the simplified fractional expression has not been rigorously confirmed. Nonetheless, based on the available output, the answer 300 is the best available estimate.

[TOO_HARD]
Suggestion: Develop a complete derivation by explicitly solving (6+3cosθ)²+(3sinθ)² = 121 and enforcing the collinearity condition to determine the exact values of the inner and outer tangency circles, and verify that the difference r_i - r_o simplifies to a fraction with m+n = 300.
Extracted answer: 300
