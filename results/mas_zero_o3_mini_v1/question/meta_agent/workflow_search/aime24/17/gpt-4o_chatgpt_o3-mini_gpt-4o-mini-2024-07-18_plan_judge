Question: Find the number of triples of nonnegative integers \((a,b,c)\) satisfying \(a + b + c = 300\) and
\begin{equation*}
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.
\end{equation*}
Iteration: MAS-ZERO Workflow 17_Iteration_0
proposed answer: By testing the fully symmetric case and the boundary case when one variable is 0, we derived that (100, 100, 100) works, and when one variable is 0 the equation reduces to 300ab = 6000000 which gives ab = 20000. This produces the pair (100, 200) (up to order) for the remaining two variables. Permuting these values among a, b, and c, the only solutions are (100, 100, 100) and the six permutations of (0, 100, 200). This reasoning confirms the filtered list of triples.

Answer:(100, 100, 100), (0, 100, 200), (0, 200, 100), (100, 0, 200), (100, 200, 0), (200, 0, 100), (200, 100, 0)
Extracted answer: (100, 100, 100), (0, 100, 200), (0, 200, 100), (100, 0, 200), (100, 200, 0), (200, 0, 100), (200, 100, 0)
Correct answer: 601
