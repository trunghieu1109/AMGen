    <pre>Related original question:

Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice&#39;s play.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 2: Based on the losing positions for Alice from Sub-task 1, determine the winning positions for Bob. 

 ### thinking by CoT-SC Agent EFa7:
Since losing positions for the player whose turn it is occur when n ≡ 0 or 2 (mod 5), and Alice starts the game, whenever the initial token count is congruent to 0 or 2 modulo 5, Alice begins in a losing position. This means Bob can guarantee a win if the initial count of tokens is 0 or 2 modulo 5. Thus, the winning positions for Bob are exactly those positions.

### answer by CoT-SC Agent EFa7:
Winning positions for Bob are those cases where n is congruent to 0 or 2 modulo 5.

### Sub-task 3: Based on the winning positions for Bob from Sub-task 2, count the number of such positions up to 2024. 

 ### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent gpJA (yourself):
We first note that Bob wins when n ≡ 0 or 2 (mod 5). For numbers congruent to 0 mod 5, the sequence starts from 5 and goes up to 2020. There are 2020/5 = 404 such numbers. For numbers congruent to 2 mod 5, the sequence starts from 2 and goes up to 2017. The count is ((2017 - 2) / 5) + 1 = (2015/5) + 1 = 403 + 1 = 404. The total number of winning positions for Bob is 404 + 404 = 808.

### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent gpJA (yourself):
808

### feedback #1 by Critic Agent IkQa:
The winning positions for Bob are those where n is congruent to 0 or 2 modulo 5. There are 404 numbers up to 2024 that are 0 modulo 5 and 404 numbers that are 2 modulo 5, resulting in a total of 808 winning positions.

### Given previous attempts and feedback, refine the count of winning positions for Bob. 

 ### thinking #2 by Chain-of-Thought Agent gpJA (yourself):
On re-examination, the winning positions for Bob occur when n ≡ 0 or 2 (mod 5). For n ≡ 0 (mod 5), the positive integers up to 2024 are 5, 10, …, 2020. There are floor(2024/5) = 404 numbers. For n ≡ 2 (mod 5), the sequence is 2, 7, 12, …, and the largest term ≤2024 is 2022 (since 2 + 5*404 = 2022). The count for this sequence is ((2022 - 2) / 5) + 1 = (2020/5) + 1 = 404 + 1 = 405. Thus, the total number of winning positions for Bob is 404 + 405 = 809.

### answer #2 by Chain-of-Thought Agent gpJA (yourself):
809

### Sub-task 3: Based on the winning positions for Bob from Sub-task 2, count the number of such positions up to 2024. 

 ### feedback #2 by Critic Agent IkQa:
After analyzing the positions modulo 5, we see that Bob wins when the number of tokens n is such that n ≡ 0 or 2 (mod 5). For n ≡ 0 (mod 5), the numbers are 5, 10, 15, …, 2020. There are 2024/5 = 404 numbers. For n ≡ 2 (mod 5), the numbers are 2, 7, 12, …, 2022. This sequence contains ((2022 - 2) / 5) + 1 = 404 + 1 = 405 numbers. Thus, the total winning positions for Bob is 404 + 405 = 809.

### Given previous attempts and feedback, refine the count of winning positions for Bob. 

 ### thinking #3 by Chain-of-Thought Agent gpJA (yourself):
Based on the analysis, winning positions for Bob occur when n ≡ 0 or 2 (mod 5). For n ≡ 0 mod 5, the numbers are 5, 10, 15, ..., 2020, which gives 404 numbers (floor(2024/5) = 404). For n ≡ 2 mod 5, the numbers are 2, 7, 12, ..., 2022, and the count is ((2022-2)/5)+1 = 404+1 = 405. Summing these gives 404 + 405 = 809.

### answer #3 by Chain-of-Thought Agent gpJA (yourself):
809

### Sub-task 3: Based on the winning positions for Bob from Sub-task 2, count the number of such positions up to 2024. 

 ### feedback #3 by Critic Agent IkQa:
The winning positions for Bob occur when n is congruent to 0 or 2 modulo 5. There are 404 numbers for n ≡ 0 (mod 5) and 405 numbers for n ≡ 2 (mod 5) up to 2024, which sums to 809.

Given the above, answer the following question: Given previous attempts and feedback, refine the count of winning positions for Bob.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry (for example, 300

    <pre>After reviewing the sequences, for n ≡ 0 mod 5, we have 404 numbers (5, 10, ..., 2020). For n ≡ 2 mod 5, the sequence runs from 2 to 2022, which gives 405 numbers. Therefore, the refined count of winning positions for Bob is 404 + 405 = 809.
