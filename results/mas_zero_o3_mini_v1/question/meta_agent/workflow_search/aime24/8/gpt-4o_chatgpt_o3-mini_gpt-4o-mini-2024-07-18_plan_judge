Question: Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.

proposed answer: After reviewing the sequences, for n ≡ 0 mod 5, we have 404 numbers (5, 10, ..., 2020). For n ≡ 2 mod 5, the sequence runs from 2 to 2022, which gives 405 numbers. Therefore, the refined count of winning positions for Bob is 404 + 405 = 809.
