On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.",
