Question: Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.

This means Bob can guarantee a win if the initial count of tokens is 0 or 2 modulo 5. Thus, the winning positions for Bob are exactly those positions.\n\n### answer by CoT-SC Agent EFa7:\nWinning positions for Bob are those cases where n is congruent to 0 or 2 modulo 5.\n\n### Sub-task 3: Based on the winning positions for Bob from Sub-task 2, count the number of such positions up to 2024. \n\n ### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent gpJA (yourself):\nWe first note that Bob wins when n ≡ 0 or 2 (mod 5). For numbers congruent to 0 mod 5, the sequence starts from 5 and goes up to 2020. There are 2020/5 = 404 such numbers. For numbers congruent to 2 mod 5, the sequence starts from 2 and goes up to 2017. The count is ((2017 - 2) / 5) + 1 = (2015/5) + 1 = 403 + 1 = 404.

For n ≡ 0 (mod 5), the positive integers up to 2024 are 5, 10, …, 2020. There are floor(2024/5) = 404 numbers. For n ≡ 2 (mod 5), the sequence is 2, 7, 12, …, and the largest term ≤2024 is 2022 (since 2 + 5*404 = 2022). The count for this sequence is ((2022 - 2) / 5) + 1 = (2020/5) + 1 = 404 + 1 = 405.

For n ≡ 0 mod 5, the numbers are 5, 10, 15, ..., 2020, which gives 404 numbers (floor(2024/5) = 404). For n ≡ 2 mod 5, the numbers are 2, 7, 12, ..., 2022, and the count is ((2022-2)/5)+1 = 404+1 = 405.

With n=0 as a losing position, we have: n=1 is winning (move to 0), n=2 is losing (only move to 1, which is winning), n=3 is winning (move to 2), n=4 is winning (move to 0), and n=5 is losing (moves to 4 or 1, both winning). Continuing this process, a pattern emerges: losing positions occur when n is either 0 or 2 modulo 5 (i.e. n ≡ 0 or 2 (mod 5)). In these positions, any move (removing 1 or 4 tokens) forces a move into a winning position for Bob. This is the characterization of the losing positions for the player whose turn it is, and thus for Alice in her opening move if n has one of these residues.; answer: Losing positions for Alice occur when the number of tokens n is congruent to 0 or 2 modulo 5.\nCoT-SC agent EFa7, on the purpose of determining winning positions for Bob, thinking: Since losing positions for the player whose turn it is occur when n ≡ 0 or 2 (mod 5), and Alice starts the game, whenever the initial token count is congruent to 0 or 2 modulo 5, Alice begins in a losing position.
