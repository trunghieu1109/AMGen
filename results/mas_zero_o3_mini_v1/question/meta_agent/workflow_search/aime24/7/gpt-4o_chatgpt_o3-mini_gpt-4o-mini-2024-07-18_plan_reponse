        "response": "By analyzing the equations log_x(y^x) = 10 and log_y(x^(4y)) = 10, we obtained expressions for ln(y) in terms of ln(x): ln(y) = (10/x) ln(x) from the first equation and ln(y) = (2y/5) ln(x) from the second. Equating these gives 10/x = 2y/5, leading directly to xy = 25. This result is additionally confirmed by substituting y = 25/x into the equations and verifying consistency, hence multiple reasoning paths result in the same product.\n\nAnswer:25",
