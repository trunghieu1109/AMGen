Equating these expressions gives (10/x) = (2y/5), hence xy = 25. With y = 25/x, substituting back into ln(y) = (10/x)·ln(x) produces ln(25/x) = (10/x)·ln(x), which rearranges to ln 25 = (1 + 10/x)·ln(x).

Alternatively, applying the power rule of logarithms gives x * log_x(y) = 10. Similarly, for log_y(x^(4y)) = 10, we rewrite it as x^(4y) = y^10 or equivalently 4y * log_y(x) = 10. These are the equations in terms of x and y derived from the given logarithmic conditions.; answer: The equations are: (1) y^x = x^10 (alternatively, x·log_x(y) = 10) and (2) x^(4y) = y^10 (alternatively, 4y·log_y(x) = 10).\nCoT agent LGeS, on the purpose of solving equations, thinking: We start by rewriting the given equations using logarithm properties. From log_x(y^x)=10 we have y^x=x^10. Taking natural logarithms gives x·ln(y)=10·ln(x). Similarly, from log_y(x^(4y))=10 we obtain x^(4y)=y^10 so that 4y·ln(x)=10·ln(y). Dividing the first equation by the second (and assuming ln(x) and ln(y) are nonzero, which is true since x,y>1) yields (x·ln(y))/(4y·ln(x))= (10·ln(x))/(10·ln(y)) giving after cancellation  (x)/(4y)= (ln(x))/(ln(y))^2. A more straightforward approach is to solve each equation for ln(y) in terms of ln(x):\n\n• From x·ln(y)=10·ln(x) we get ln(y)= (10/x)·ln(x).\n• From 4y·ln(x)=10·ln(y) we get ln(y)= (4y/10)·ln(x)=(2y/5)·ln(x).\n\nSetting the two expressions for ln(y) equal (and provided ln(x)≠0) gives:\n\n(10/x)·ln(x) = (2y/5)·ln(x) → 10/x = 2y/5.\n\nMultiplying both sides by 5x we have 50 = 2xy, so:\n\nxy = 25.\n\nThus the product of x and y is determined to be 25. We now substitute y = 25/x into one of our earlier equations. Using ln(y)= (10/x)·ln(x), we get:\n\nln(25/x) = (10/x)·ln(x).\n\nWriting ln(25/x)= ln 25 - ln x, the equation becomes:\n\nln 25 - ln x = (10/x)·ln x.\n\nThat is equivalent to\n\nln 25 = ln x · (1 + 10/x).\n\nThis equation does not simplify to an elementary closed‐form expression for x, so one must find x (and hence y=25/x) numerically. Searching for a solution among numbers greater than 1, one finds by trial that x is approximately 1.532 (since for x≈1.532, (1+10/x)·ln x is very close to ln25≈3.2189) and consequently y≈25/1.532≈16.312. These approximate values satisfy both original equations.\n\nThus, the solution to the system (with x,y>1) is characterized by:\n1. xy = 25, and\n2. x satisfies ln 25 = (1 + 10/x)·ln x (with x≈1.532), with y = 25/x ≈ 16.312.\n\nThis is the best answer in closed form and numerical approximations since no further elementary simplification is available.; answer: The solution is given by xy = 25 and ln 25 = (1 + 10/x) ln x, so that x and y (with y = 25/x) are uniquely determined. Numerically, x ≈ 1.532 and y ≈ 16.312\nCritic agent xgSn, on the purpose of reviewing solutions, thinking: The solution attempt is mostly correct. The chain-of-thought successfully rewrites the logarithmic equations to derive ln(y) in terms of ln(x) and equates them to obtain xy = 25, which is a key insight. However, the initial method of dividing the equations introduced an unnecessary complication. A more straightforward approach is to set ln(y) = (10/x) ln(x) from the first equation and ln(y) = (2y/5) ln(x) from the second, then equate them to obtain 10/x = 2y/5, leading directly to xy = 25. The subsequent substitution and numerical approximation (x ≈ 1.532, y ≈ 16.312) are correct and well explained.; answer: The correct solution is that xy = 25, with the additional relation ln(25) = (1 + 10/x) ln(x) determining x (and hence y = 25/x). Numerically, x ≈ 1.532 and y ≈ 16.312.\nCoT agent LGeS, on the purpose of solving equations, thinking: We combine the two logarithmic equations to derive expressions for ln(y) in terms of ln(x). Specifically, from log_x(y^x)=10 we obtain x·ln(y)=10·ln(x) so that ln(y)=(10/x)·ln(x), and from log_y(x^(4y))=10 we obtain 4y·ln(x)=10·ln(y) so that ln(y)=(2y/5)·ln(x). Equating these two expressions gives (10/x)=(2y/5), which simplifies to xy=25. Therefore y=25/x. Substituting back, we get ln25=(1+10/x)·ln(x), a transcendental equation in x. While this equation does not have a simple closed‐form solution, numerical methods yield a unique solution with x≈1.532 and hence y≈25/1.532≈16.312, which satisfy both original conditions.; answer: The solution is given by xy = 25, with x and y satisfying ln25 = (1 + 10/x) ln x (and y = 25/x). Numerically, x ≈ 1.532 and y ≈ 16.312.\nCritic agent xgSn, on the purpose of reviewing solutions, thinking: The solution attempt is sound. It correctly derives the relationship ln(y) = (10/x) ln(x) from the first equation and ln(y) = (2y/5) ln(x) from the second, then equates these to obtain xy = 25. It properly deduces that y = 25/x and acknowledges that substituting back into the logarithmic relation produces a transcendental equation that must be solved numerically. The numerical estimates given (x ≈ 1.532 and y ≈ 16.312) are consistent with this approach. One improvement could be to clarify that the numerical solution is obtained via methods like iteration or graphical analysis, as the transcendental equation does not have a closed-form solution.; answer: The solution is correct. The derivations show that xy = 25, and given x > 1 and y > 1, the derived expressions lead to numerical approximations x ≈ 1.532 and y ≈ 16.312 which satisfy the original equations.\nCoT agent LGeS, on the purpose of solving equations, thinking: We start by converting the logarithmic equations to natural logs. From log_x(y^x)=10, we obtain x ln(y) = 10 ln(x), hence ln(y) = (10/x) ln(x). From log_y(x^(4y))=10, we get 4y ln(x) = 10 ln(y), which gives ln(y) = (2y/5) ln(x). Equating the two expressions for ln(y) leads to (10/x) = (2y/5), so that xy = 25. Therefore, y = 25/x. Substituting this back into ln(y) = (10/x) ln(x) produces ln(25/x) = (10/x) ln(x), or equivalently ln 25 - ln x = (10/x) ln x, giving ln 25 = (1 + 10/x) ln x. This transcendental equation does not have an elementary closed-form solution, but using numerical methods we find that x ≈ 1.532 and consequently y ≈ 25/1.532 ≈ 16.312. Thus, the system is solved by xy = 25 with the additional condition ln 25 = (1 + 10/x) ln x.; answer: xy = 25, with ln 25 = (1 + 10/x) ln x (and y = 25/x); numerically, x ≈ 1.532 and y ≈ 16.312.\nCritic agent xgSn, on the purpose of reviewing solutions, thinking: The solution correctly identifies that equating the two expressions for ln(y) leads to (10/x) = (2y/5) and hence xy = 25. The reasoning is sound in showing that substituting y = 25/x into the logarithmic equation produces a transcendental equation for x, which justifies the need for numerical methods to approximate x and y. However, the explanation could be strengthened by elaborating on the numerical approach used and any potential limitations of this method.; answer: The final result xy = 25 is correct, and the derived relationship ln 25 = (1 + 10/x) ln x along with the approximations x ≈ 1.532 and y ≈ 16.312 are consistent with the given equations.\nCoT agent LGeS, on the purpose of solving equations, thinking: We start with the equations derived in Sub-task 1: from log_x(y^x) = 10 we obtain x·ln(y) = 10·ln(x) so that ln(y) = (10/x)·ln(x), and from log_y(x^(4y)) = 10 we get 4y·ln(x) = 10·ln(y) so that ln(y) = (2y/5)·ln(x).

Multiplying both sides by x and simplifying shows that xy = 25.
