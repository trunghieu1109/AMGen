Question: Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.

proposed answer: The error in the original answer comes from misinterpreting the question's request. In the reals, there is no largest number that is strictly less than 960 because for any number chosen below 960, another number closer to 960 (but still less than it) can be found. Therefore, stating that 959 is the greatest real number less than 960 is incorrect.

Answer:There is no largest real number less than 960
[TOO_HARD]
Suggestion: Please clarify whether the problem requires a supremum (which would be 960) or a different notion of 'greatest real number less than BD^2' in the context of the problem.
Extracted answer: There is no largest real number less than 960
Correct answer: 480
