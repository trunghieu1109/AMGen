Question: Alice chooses a set $A$ of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets $B$ of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of $B$ belongs to $A$. Bob's list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A.
Iteration: MAS-ZERO Workflow 26_Iteration_0
proposed answer: We determined in sub-task 2 that A = {4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11}. Summing the elements gives 4+6+7+8+9+10+11 = 55.

Answer:55
Extracted answer: 55
