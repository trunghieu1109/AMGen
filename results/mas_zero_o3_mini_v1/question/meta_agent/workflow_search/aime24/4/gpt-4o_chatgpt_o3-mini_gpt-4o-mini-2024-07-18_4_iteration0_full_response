Since the multiplicative group modulo an odd prime p is cyclic of order p – 1, a necessary condition for the congruence n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p) to have a solution is that –1 be a fourth power in the field Z/pZ. This implies that the equation x^4 ≡ -1 (mod p) is soluble only when the number of fourth powers (which is (p – 1)/4) is at least large enough to include –1. In fact, one can show that aside from the trivial case p = 2 (which in this problem does not work because n^4 + 1 is always 1 or 2 mod 4), the prime p must satisfy 8 | (p – 1). The smallest prime with p ≡ 1 (mod 8) is 17. In checking modulo 17 we see that 2^4 = 16 ≡ -1 (mod 17). Moreover, the nonvanishing of the derivative 4*2^3 (mod 17) allows a Hensel lift to a solution modulo 17^2 = 289. Thus 17 is indeed the least prime with the property that there exists a positive integer n (for example n = 2) with n^4 + 1 divisible by p^2.\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent DWDk:\n17\n\n### Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1, find the smallest positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2. \n\n ### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent vA3b (yourself):\nWe know from sub-task 1 that p = 17 and therefore p^2 = 289. We need to find the smallest positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 289 (i.e. m^4 ≡ -1 (mod 289)). There are 4 solutions modulo 17 to x^4 ≡ -1 (mod 17). In fact, because the multiplicative group modulo 17 is cyclic of order 16, writing x = g^k (where g is a primitive root modulo 17) the equation x^4 ≡ -1 becomes g^(4k) ≡ g^8 so 4k ≡ 8 (mod 16), i.e. k ≡ 2 (mod 4). For example, if we take a primitive root such as 3 modulo 17 then the solutions are x ≡ 3^2 = 9, 3^6 = 15, 3^10 = 8, and 3^14 = 2 (mod 17). Using Hensel’s lemma we can uniquely lift each solution modulo 17 to a solution modulo 289 provided that f(x) = x^4 + 1 has f ′(x) = 4x^3 not congruent to 0 modulo 17 at the given solution. All four solutions work. Our goal is to find the smallest positive m among the 4 lifts. \n\nFor any solution x0 modulo 17 the lift will be of the form m = x0 + 17t, with t chosen so that (x0 + 17t)^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 289). Because higher terms in the binomial expansion are divisible by 289, we have\n\u2003\u2003(x0 + 17t)^4 ≡ x0^4 + 4x0^3·17t (mod 289).\nThus the congruence becomes:\n\u2003\u2003x0^4 + 1 + 68x0^3 t ≡ 0 (mod 289).\nSince x0^4 ≡ -1 (mod 17) we may write x0^4 + 1 = 17C for some integer C. Then the congruence reduces to\n\u2003\u200317C + 68x0^3 t ≡ 0 (mod 289).\nDividing by 17 (which is valid because 289 = 17^2) gives\n\u2003\u2003C + 4x0^3 t ≡ 0 (mod 17)\nor\n\u2003\u20034x0^3 t ≡ -C (mod 17).\n\nWe now illustrate the process with one of the solutions. It turns out that when starting with the solution x0 ≡ 8 (mod 17) (one of the four solutions), the corresponding lift is smallest.\n\nStep 1. With x0 = 8, we have x0^4 = 8^4 = 4096 and so x0^4 + 1 = 4097. Compute C by writing 4097 = 17·C. Since 17·241 = 4097, we have C = 241. \n\nStep 2. Compute 4x0^3. Now x0^3 = 8^3 = 512, so 4*512 = 2048. We need to solve\n\u2003\u20032048 t ≡ -241 (mod 17).\nReduce 2048 modulo 17. Since 17*120 = 2040, 2048 ≡ 8 (mod 17). Also, 241 modulo 17: 17*14 = 238 so 241 ≡ 3 (mod 17). Thus the congruence becomes\n\u2003\u20038t ≡ -3 (mod 17).\nThe inverse of 8 modulo 17 is 15 (because 8*15 = 120 ≡ 1 mod 17). Multiplying both sides,\n\u2003\u2003t ≡ -3*15 ≡ -45 ≡ -45 + 51 = 6 (mod 17).\nTaking the least nonnegative t = 6, the lifted solution is\n\u2003\u2003m = 8 + 17*6 = 8 + 102 = 110.\n\nStep 3. For the other lifts the numbers turn out to be m = 155, 134, and 179. Among these, 110 is the smallest.\n\nThus the least positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 289 is 110.\n\n### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent vA3b (yourself):\n110\n\n### Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1, provide feedback on the current guess for m and correct it if necessary. \n\n ### feedback #1 by Critic Agent RT7s:\nThe provided reasoning successfully uses Hensel’s lemma to lift the solution and shows that m = 110 is indeed the smallest positive integer such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 289.
