Question: Let $p$ be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $n^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$. Find the least positive integer $m$ such that $m^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$.

proposed answer: Given that p = 17 and p^2 = 289, we use Hensel's lemma to lift solutions of n^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 17) to modulo 289. Among the lifts from the solutions modulo 17, the one starting from n ≡ 8 (mod 17) yields m = 110, which is confirmed to be the smallest positive integer making m^4 + 1 divisible by 289.
