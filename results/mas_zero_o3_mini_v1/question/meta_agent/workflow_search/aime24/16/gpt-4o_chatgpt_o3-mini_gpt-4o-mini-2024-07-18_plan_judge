proposed answer: We use the condition IA ⟂ OI to obtain additional information. First, note that OI^2 = R^2 - 2Rr. With R = 13 and r = 6, OI^2 = 169 - 156 = 13 so that OI = √13. In triangle AIO (right‐angled at I) we have OA^2 = IA^2 + OI^2, so 13^2 = IA^2 + 13, which gives IA^2 = 169 - 13 = 156 and IA = 2√39. Since IA = r/sin(A/2), we have sin(A/2) = 6/(2√39) = 3/√39, so sin^2(A/2) = 9/39 = 3/13. Then cos(A/2) = √(1 - 3/13) = √(10/13) so that sinA = 2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2) = 2(√(3/13))(√(10/13)) = 2√30/13. This gives side a = BC = 2R sinA = 2 × 13 × (2√30/13) = 4√30. Next, the area Δ can be expressed two ways: Δ = (1/2)(AB·AC) sin A and Δ = r·s. Equate (1/2)(AB·AC) sinA = 6s, so that AB·AC = (12s)/sinA = (12s)/(2√30/13) = (78s)/√30. To find s, we use the identity tan(A/2) = r/(s − a) which gives s − a = r cot(A/2). Since cot(A/2) = cos(A/2)/sin(A/2) = (√(10/13))/(√(3/13)) = √(10/3), we have s = a + 6√(10/3) = 4√30 + 6√(10/3). Notice that 6√(10/3) = 6√10/√3 = 2√30. Therefore, s = 4√30 + 2√30 = 6√30. Finally, AB·AC = (78 × 6√30)/√30 = 468.
