        "response": "We use the condition IA \u27c2 OI to obtain additional information. First, note that OI^2 = R^2 - 2Rr. With R = 13 and r = 6, OI^2 = 169 - 156 = 13 so that OI = \u221a13. In triangle AIO (right\u2010angled at I) we have OA^2 = IA^2 + OI^2, so 13^2 = IA^2 + 13, which gives IA^2 = 169 - 13 = 156 and IA = 2\u221a39. Since IA = r/sin(A/2), we have sin(A/2) = 6/(2\u221a39) = 3/\u221a39, so sin^2(A/2) = 9/39 = 3/13. Then cos(A/2) = \u221a(1 - 3/13) = \u221a(10/13) so that sinA = 2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2) = 2(\u221a(3/13))(\u221a(10/13)) = 2\u221a30/13. This gives side a = BC = 2R sinA = 2 \u00d7 13 \u00d7 (2\u221a30/13) = 4\u221a30. Next, the area \u0394 can be expressed two ways: \u0394 = (1/2)(AB\u00b7AC) sin A and \u0394 = r\u00b7s. Equate (1/2)(AB\u00b7AC) sinA = 6s, so that AB\u00b7AC = (12s)/sinA = (12s)/(2\u221a30/13) = (78s)/\u221a30. To find s, we use the identity tan(A/2) = r/(s \u2212 a) which gives s \u2212 a = r cot(A/2). Since cot(A/2) = cos(A/2)/sin(A/2) = (\u221a(10/13))/(\u221a(3/13)) = \u221a(10/3), we have s = a + 6\u221a(10/3) = 4\u221a30 + 6\u221a(10/3). Notice that 6\u221a(10/3) = 6\u221a10/\u221a3 = 2\u221a30. Therefore, s = 4\u221a30 + 2\u221a30 = 6\u221a30. Finally, AB\u00b7AC = (78 \u00d7 6\u221a30)/\u221a30 = 468.\n\nAnswer:468",
