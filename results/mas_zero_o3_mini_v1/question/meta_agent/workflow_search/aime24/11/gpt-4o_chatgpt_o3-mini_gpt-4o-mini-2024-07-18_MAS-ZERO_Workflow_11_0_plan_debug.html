    <pre>Related original question:

Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.
[asy] size(10cm); usepackage(&#34;tikz&#34;);label(&#34;egin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(2,0)--(2,3)--(5,3)--(5,8)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}&#34;,origin); label(&#34;\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(0,3)--(3,3)--(3,5)--(8,5)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}&#34;,E); [/asy].

### Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1, calculate the number of valid paths for each configuration of direction changes. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent gbD7:
For the R, U, R, U, R configuration: We need to partition the 8 right moves into 3 parts (each at least 1), and the 8 up moves into 2 parts (each at least 1). The number of ways to partition 8 into 3 parts is C(8-1, 3-1) = C(7, 2) = 21, and the number of ways to partition 8 into 2 parts is C(8-1, 2-1) = C(7, 1) = 7. Multiplying these gives 21 Ã— 7 = 147 valid paths. The same argument applies to the U, R, U, R, U configuration (with roles of R and U reversed), yielding another 147 valid paths. Thus, total valid paths = 147 + 147 = 294.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent gbD7:
For the R, U, R, U, R configuration: 147 valid paths; For the U, R, U, R, U configuration: 147 valid paths; Total valid paths: 294.

### Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 2, aggregate the results to find the total number of paths that change direction exactly four times. 

 ### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent yfti (yourself):
From sub-task 2, each configuration (R, U, R, U, R and U, R, U, R, U) yields 147 valid paths. Aggregating these gives 147 + 147 = 294 valid paths that change direction exactly four times.

### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent yfti (yourself):
294

### feedback #1 by Critic Agent DV4L:
The aggregated total of valid paths from both configurations, R, U, R, U, R and U, R, U, R, U, is 147 + 147 = 294.

### thinking #2 by Chain-of-Thought Agent yfti (yourself):
The two valid configurations (R, U, R, U, R and U, R, U, R, U) each yield 147 valid paths, so adding them gives 294 total paths. This follows directly from the aggregation in Sub-task 2.

### answer #2 by Chain-of-Thought Agent yfti (yourself):
294

### feedback #2 by Critic Agent DV4L:
Based on sub-task 2, the two configurations (R, U, R, U, R and U, R, U, R, U) yield 147 paths each, so aggregating them gives a total of 294 paths.

### thinking #3 by Chain-of-Thought Agent yfti (yourself):
Aggregating the two configurations from sub-task 2, each yielding 147 valid paths, we have 147 + 147 = 294 total paths.

### answer #3 by Chain-of-Thought Agent yfti (yourself):
294

### feedback #3 by Critic Agent DV4L:
Aggregating the two configurations from sub-task 2, each contributing 147 paths, the total number of paths that change direction exactly four times is 147 + 147 = 294.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 2, aggregate the results to find the total number of paths that change direction exactly four times.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry (for example, 300
[TOO_HARD]
Suggestion:...) and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
