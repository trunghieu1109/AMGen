Question: Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.

proposed answer: We begin by writing any two‐digit number in base b as n = ab + c with 1 ≤ a ≤ b−1 and 0 ≤ c ≤ b−1. The b‐beautiful condition is that √n is an integer and equals a + c. Writing k = a + c we have n = k², and noting also that the base‐b representation gives n = a*b + (k − a), we equate k² = a*b + (k − a), which rearranges to a*(b − 1) = k*(k − 1). Hence a = k*(k − 1)/(b − 1) must be an integer between 1 and b − 1. Also, because n must be a two‐digit number in base b, we have b ≤ n = k² < b². This implies that k lies in the interval [ceil(√b), b − 1]. In summary, for each base b (with b − 1 = d), the candidate b‐beautiful numbers are the perfect squares n = k² (with k in [ceil(√(d+1)), d]) for which d divides k*(k − 1). When b is large enough so that ceil(√b) > 1, note that every integer k in the complete set {1, 2, ..., d} is uniquely represented modulo d. In that complete system the equation d | k*(k−1) forces, by checking the congruence modulo each prime factor of d, that for each prime factor p dividing d the possibilities are k ≡ 0 or 1 (mod p). Thus, by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, there are exactly 2^(ω(d)) solutions modulo d (where ω(d) is the number of distinct prime factors of d). However, since our range is k in [ceil(√b), d], and for b > 4 we have ceil(√b) > 1 (so the solution corresponding to k ≡ 1, namely k = 1, is omitted), the number of b‐beautiful numbers is 2^(ω(b−1)) − 1. To have more than ten b‐beautiful numbers we need:

  2^(ω(b−1)) − 1 > 10  ⇒  2^(ω(b−1)) > 11.

The smallest integer m for which 2^m > 11 is m = 4 because 2^3 = 8 and 2^4 = 16. Thus we require ω(b − 1) ≥ 4. To minimize b, we choose b − 1 as the smallest positive integer that is square‐free with four distinct prime factors. The smallest such number is 2 × 3 × 5 × 7 = 210, which gives b = 211. In that case the number of b‐beautiful integers is 2^4 − 1 = 16 − 1 = 15, which is indeed more than 10.

Therefore, the least integer b ≥ 2 for which there are more than ten b‐beautiful integers is 211.
