        "response": "We begin by writing any two\u2010digit number in base b as n = ab + c with 1 \u2264 a \u2264 b\u22121 and 0 \u2264 c \u2264 b\u22121. The b\u2010beautiful condition is that \u221an is an integer and equals a + c. Writing k = a + c we have n = k\u00b2, and noting also that the base\u2010b representation gives n = a*b + (k \u2212 a), we equate k\u00b2 = a*b + (k \u2212 a), which rearranges to a*(b \u2212 1) = k*(k \u2212 1). Hence a = k*(k \u2212 1)/(b \u2212 1) must be an integer between 1 and b \u2212 1. Also, because n must be a two\u2010digit number in base b, we have b \u2264 n = k\u00b2 < b\u00b2. This implies that k lies in the interval [ceil(\u221ab), b \u2212 1]. In summary, for each base b (with b \u2212 1 = d), the candidate b\u2010beautiful numbers are the perfect squares n = k\u00b2 (with k in [ceil(\u221a(d+1)), d]) for which d divides k*(k \u2212 1). When b is large enough so that ceil(\u221ab) > 1, note that every integer k in the complete set {1, 2, ..., d} is uniquely represented modulo d. In that complete system the equation d | k*(k\u22121) forces, by checking the congruence modulo each prime factor of d, that for each prime factor p dividing d the possibilities are k \u2261 0 or 1 (mod p). Thus, by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, there are exactly 2^(\u03c9(d)) solutions modulo d (where \u03c9(d) is the number of distinct prime factors of d). However, since our range is k in [ceil(\u221ab), d], and for b > 4 we have ceil(\u221ab) > 1 (so the solution corresponding to k \u2261 1, namely k = 1, is omitted), the number of b\u2010beautiful numbers is 2^(\u03c9(b\u22121)) \u2212 1. To have more than ten b\u2010beautiful numbers we need:\n\n\u2003\u20032^(\u03c9(b\u22121)) \u2212 1 > 10\u2003\u2003\u21d2\u2003\u20032^(\u03c9(b\u22121)) > 11.\n\nThe smallest integer m for which 2^m > 11 is m = 4 because 2^3 = 8 and 2^4 = 16. Thus we require \u03c9(b \u2212 1) \u2265 4. To minimize b, we choose b \u2212 1 as the smallest positive integer that is square\u2010free with four distinct prime factors. The smallest such number is 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 7 = 210, which gives b = 211. In that case the number of b\u2010beautiful integers is 2^4 \u2212 1 = 16 \u2212 1 = 15, which is indeed more than 10.\n\nTherefore, the least integer b \u2265 2 for which there are more than ten b\u2010beautiful integers is 211.\n\nAnswer:211",
