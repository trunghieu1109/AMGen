        "response": "After double-checking each condition and considering potential pitfalls such as misordering the list, incorrectly computing the median (especially in an even-length list), and arithmetic errors in summing squares, I confirmed that the list [5, 7, 9, 9] is valid: its sum is 30, the unique mode is 9, and the median is (7 + 9) / 2 = 8 (which is not present in the list). Therefore, computing the sum of squares yields 5^2 + 7^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 = 25 + 49 + 81 + 81 = 236. This careful re-assessment confirms that 236 is the correct answer.\n\nAnswer:236",
