    <pre>Related original question:

There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\times5$ grid such that: 

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 1: Determine the maximum number of rows and columns that can be filled with chips of a single color without violating the conditions. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent ldjW:
The idea is that if we want a row (or column) to be completely filled with chips of a single color—meaning every cell in that row or column contains a chip of that color—we must ensure that no conflict happens with any intersecting column (or row) that might have chips of the opposite color. In the best‐case scenario we can pick one color (say, white) and fill all cells in some rows and columns with that color. Note that if we fill an entire row, then every cell of that row receives the same chip (white), and any column intersecting a fully white row must either contain no chip or be white if it contains any chip. In order to maximize the number of rows or columns completely filled with chips (i.e. every cell in that row/column receives a chip), there is no conflict if we use one color only. In a 5×5 grid we can fill at most 5 rows and 5 columns (by filling the entire grid with white, for example). This makes the grid maximal and satisfies all given conditions. Therefore, the maximum number of rows that can be filled with chips of a single color is 5 and similarly 5 for the columns.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent ldjW:
5 rows and 5 columns

### Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1, calculate the total number of chips that can be placed without violating the conditions. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent kk00:
Sub-task 1 showed that all 5 rows and all 5 columns can be filled with chips of a single color, which means placing a chip in every cell of the 5x5 grid. This completely fills the grid without any violations, and any additional chip would either require placing a second chip in an already occupied cell or conflict with the uniform color rule. Therefore, the total number of chips placed is 5x5 = 25.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent kk00:
25

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 3: Based on the outputs of sub-task 1 and 2, verify that the placement is optimal and any additional chip would violate the conditions.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry (for example, 300
[TOO_HARD]
Suggestion:...) and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>The verification is straightforward: sub-task 1 showed that by using one color, we can fill all 5 rows and 5 columns, and sub-task 2 confirmed that this results in 25 chips filling all cells of the grid. Since each cell can hold at most one chip, every cell is occupied. Placing any additional chip would therefore violate the rule that prohibits placing more than one chip per cell. Additionally, any chip placed in a row or column already containing a chip that defines the row/column’s color would risk mixing colors, breaking the uniform color condition. Hence, the configuration is optimal and maximal.

Answer:The placement is optimal because all 25 cells are filled, and adding any extra chip would either require placing it in an already occupied cell or force a row or column to have chips of different colors, violating the conditions.</pre>
