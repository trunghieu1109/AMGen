Question: There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\times5$ grid such that: 

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.

proposed answer: The verification is straightforward: sub-task 1 showed that by using one color, we can fill all 5 rows and 5 columns, and sub-task 2 confirmed that this results in 25 chips filling all cells of the grid. Since each cell can hold at most one chip, every cell is occupied. Placing any additional chip would therefore violate the rule that prohibits placing more than one chip per cell. Additionally, any chip placed in a row or column already containing a chip that defines the row/columnâ€™s color would risk mixing colors, breaking the uniform color condition. Hence, the configuration is optimal and maximal.

Answer:The placement is optimal because all 25 cells are filled, and adding any extra chip would either require placing it in an already occupied cell or force a row or column to have chips of different colors, violating the conditions.
Extracted answer: The placement is optimal because all 25 cells are filled, and adding any extra chip would either require placing it in an already occupied cell or force a row or column to have chips of different colors, violating the conditions.
Correct answer: 902
