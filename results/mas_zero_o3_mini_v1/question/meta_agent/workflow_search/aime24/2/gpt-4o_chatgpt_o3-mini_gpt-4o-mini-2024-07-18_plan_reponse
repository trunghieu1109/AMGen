        "problem": "Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?",

        "response": "The given output of Sub-task 3 produced a fraction of 300/256, which simplifies by dividing numerator and denominator by 4, yielding 75/64. Interpreting this result gives m = 75 and n = 64, with m+n = 139. However, since 75/64 is greater than 1 and does not represent a valid probability, this indicates an inconsistency in the counting process. Therefore, while 139 is the simplified sum based solely on the provided outputs, a correct approach would require a detailed decomposition by the number of blue vertices, along with an application of Burnside's lemma to properly account for rotational symmetries.\n\nAnswer:139\n[TOO_HARD]\nSuggestion: Please provide a detailed breakdown of the counting process by considering cases for the number of blue vertices and applying Burnside's lemma to correctly handle rotational symmetries.",
