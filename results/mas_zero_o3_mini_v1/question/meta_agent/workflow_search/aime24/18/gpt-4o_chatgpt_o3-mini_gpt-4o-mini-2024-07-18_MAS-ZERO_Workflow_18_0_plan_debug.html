    <pre>Related original question:

Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). Then \(OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\).. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 4: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1, 2, and 3, calculate OC^2 and express it in the form of \(rac{p}{q}\) where p and q are relatively prime positive integers. 

 ### thinking by Debate Agent 1btC:
We computed the coordinates of C as (1/8, 3√3/8). Then OC^2 = (1/8)^2 + (3√3/8)^2 = 1/64 + 27/64 = 28/64 = 7/16, where 7 and 16 are relatively prime. The question asks for p+q, so 7+16 = 23.

### thinking by Debate Agent A780:
We use the previously identified coordinates of C = (1/8, 3√3/8). Then, OC² = (1/8)² + (3√3/8)² = 1/64 + 27/64 = 28/64 which simplifies to 7/16, where 7 and 16 are relatively prime.

### answer by Debate Agent 1btC:
23

### answer by Debate Agent A780:
7/16

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1, 2, and 3, calculate OC^2 and express it in the form of \(rac{p}{q}\) where p and q are relatively prime positive integers.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry (for example, 300
[TOO_HARD]
Suggestion:...) and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>Based on the debated computations, C is determined to be at (1/8, 3√3/8) which yields OC^2 = (1/8)^2 + (3√3/8)^2 = 1/64 + 27/64 = 28/64 = 7/16, which is already in reduced form.
