Let $\omega\neq 1$ be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\]
is divided by 1000..

### Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1, compute the product of all terms. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent WdXw:
We rewrite 2 - 2ω^k + ω^(2k) as ω^(2k) - 2ω^k + 2, which factors as (ω^k - (1+i)) (ω^k - (1-i)). Since ω ranges over all 13th roots of unity, the product ∏[k=0 to 12] (ω^k - (1+i)) equals –[(1+i)^13 - 1] (because ∏ (X-ω^k)=X^13-1, evaluated at X = 1+i, and a factor of (-1)^13 = -1 appears) and similarly for (1-i). Therefore, the overall product equals ((1+i)^13 - 1) ((1-i)^13 - 1). Noting that 1+i = √2 cis(π/4), we have (1+i)^13 = 2^(13/2) cis(13π/4). Since 13π/4 = 3π + π/4, we find cis(13π/4) = -cis(π/4) = - (√2/2 + i√2/2), so (1+i)^13 = -64(1+i) (because 2^(13/2)·(√2/2) = 2^7 = 128, and the overall factor becomes 128/2 = 64). Similarly, (1-i)^13 = -64(1-i). Thus, ((1+i)^13 - 1) = -64(1+i) - 1 = -65 - 64i and ((1-i)^13 - 1) = -65 + 64i. Multiplying these gives (-65-64i)(-65+64i) = 65^2 + 64^2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321. Hence, the product of all the terms is 8321.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent WdXw:
8321

### Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 2, find the remainder when the product is divided by 1000. 

 ### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent loz1 (yourself):
We use the result of sub-task 2, which is 8321. To find the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000, we compute 8321 modulo 1000. Since 8321 = 8*1000 + 321, the remainder is 321.

### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent loz1 (yourself):
321

### Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 2, review the remainder calculation and refine if necessary. 

 ### feedback #1 by Critic Agent tIXf:
The remainder calculation is correct. Dividing 8321 by 1000 gives 8321 = 8*1000 + 321, so the remainder is indeed 321. No further refinements are needed.

### Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 2, find the remainder when the product is divided by 1000. 

 ### thinking #2 by Chain-of-Thought Agent loz1 (yourself):
The product from sub-task 2 is 8321. Dividing 8321 by 1000 gives 8321 = 8*1000 + 321, so the remainder is 321.

### answer #2 by Chain-of-Thought Agent loz1 (yourself):
321

### Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 2, review the remainder calculation and refine if necessary. 

 ### feedback #2 by Critic Agent tIXf:
After re-evaluating the calculation, the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000 is indeed 321. The division 8321 = 8*1000 + 321 confirms that the remainder is correct.

### Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 2, find the remainder when the product is divided by 1000. 

 ### thinking #3 by Chain-of-Thought Agent loz1 (yourself):
We computed the product to be 8321 in sub-task 2, and then calculated 8321 modulo 1000, which gives 321.

### answer #3 by Chain-of-Thought Agent loz1 (yourself):
321

### Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 2, review the remainder calculation and refine if necessary. 

 ### feedback #3 by Critic Agent tIXf:
Upon reviewing the calculation, if we accept the product computed in sub-task 2 as 8321, then the modulo operation 8321 mod 1000 indeed correctly yields 321. Therefore, no refinement is necessary.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 2, find the remainder when the product is divided by 1000.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry (for example, 300
