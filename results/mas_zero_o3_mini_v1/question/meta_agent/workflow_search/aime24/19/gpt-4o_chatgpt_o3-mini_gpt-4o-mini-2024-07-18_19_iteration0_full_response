Since ω ranges over all 13th roots of unity, the product ∏[k=0 to 12] (ω^k - (1+i)) equals –[(1+i)^13 - 1] (because ∏ (X-ω^k)=X^13-1, evaluated at X = 1+i, and a factor of (-1)^13 = -1 appears) and similarly for (1-i). Therefore, the overall product equals ((1+i)^13 - 1) ((1-i)^13 - 1). Noting that 1+i = √2 cis(π/4), we have (1+i)^13 = 2^(13/2) cis(13π/4). Since 13π/4 = 3π + π/4, we find cis(13π/4) = -cis(π/4) = - (√2/2 + i√2/2), so (1+i)^13 = -64(1+i) (because 2^(13/2)·(√2/2) = 2^7 = 128, and the overall factor becomes 128/2 = 64). Similarly, (1-i)^13 = -64(1-i). Thus, ((1+i)^13 - 1) = -64(1+i) - 1 = -65 - 64i and ((1-i)^13 - 1) = -65 + 64i. Multiplying these gives (-65-64i)(-65+64i) = 65^2 + 64^2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321. Hence, the product of all the terms is 8321.\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent WdXw:\n8321\n\n### Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 2, find the remainder when the product is divided by 1000. \n\n ### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent loz1 (yourself):\nWe use the result of sub-task 2, which is 8321.

In particular, for each k the value is 2 - 2 exp(2πik/13) + exp(4πik/13). Notably, when k = 0 we get 2 - 2*1 + 1 = 1, and for k = 1,2,...,12 the value is the corresponding complex number given by that formula. This is essentially as “calculated” as possible in closed form since further “simplification” would simply restate the same using the exponential form of the 13th roots of unity.; answer: k = 0: 2 - 2·1 + 1 = 1\nk = 1: 2 - 2 exp(2πi/13) + exp(4πi/13)\nk = 2: 2 - 2 exp(4πi/13) + exp(8πi/13)\nk = 3: 2 - 2 exp(6πi/13) + exp(12πi/13)\nk = 4: 2 - 2 exp(8πi/13) + exp(16πi/13)\nk = 5: 2 - 2 exp(10πi/13) + exp(20πi/13)\nk = 6: 2 - 2 exp(12πi/13) + exp(24πi/13)\nk = 7: 2 - 2 exp(14πi/13) + exp(28πi/13)\nk = 8: 2 - 2 exp(16πi/13) + exp(32πi/13)\nk = 9: 2 - 2 exp(18πi/13) + exp(36πi/13)\nk = 10: 2 - 2 exp(20πi/13) + exp(40πi/13)\nk = 11: 2 - 2 exp(22πi/13) + exp(44πi/13)\nk = 12: 2 - 2 exp(24πi/13) + exp(48πi/13)\nCoT agent uLJn, on the purpose of computing product, thinking: To compute ∏ₖ₌₀¹² (2 - 2ωᵏ + ω^(2k)) (with ω a 13th root of unity) we first rewrite the expression. Note that 2 - 2ωᵏ + ω^(2k) = ω^(2k) - 2ωᵏ + 2, so if we define f(x) = x² - 2x + 2 then our product is ∏₍ω¹³=1₎ f(ω). A standard method is to compute this product as the resultant Res(x¹³ - 1, f(x)). There is an alternative method by relating the product to the values of the polynomial f at the roots of unity. In particular, one can show that:\n\n\u2003\u2003∏₍ω¹³=1₎ f(ω) = ∏₍r: f(r)=0₎ ((r)¹³ - 1).\n\nThe quadratic f(x) = x² - 2x + 2 factors as having roots r = 1 ± i. Write (1 + i) in polar form: |1 + i| = √2 and its argument is π/4. Then\n\n\u2003\u2003(1 + i)¹³ = (√2)¹³ exp(i·13π/4) = 2^(13/2) exp(i·(13π/4)).\n\nSince 13π/4 = 3π + π/4 = π + 2π + π/4 (and exp(i2π)=1), we have exp(i·13π/4) = exp(i3π)·exp(iπ/4) = -exp(iπ/4). Thus\n\n\u2003\u2003(1 + i)¹³ = -2^(13/2) exp(iπ/4) = -2^6 √2 exp(iπ/4) = -64(1 + i)\u2003\u2003\u2003(since (1 + i) = √2 exp(iπ/4)).\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)¹³ = -64(1 - i).\n\nNow compute for r = 1 + i:\n\n\u2003\u2003(1 + i)¹³ - 1 = -64(1 + i) - 1 = -65 - 64i,\n\nand for r = 1 - i:\n\n\u2003\u2003(1 - i)¹³ - 1 = -64(1 - i) - 1 = -65 + 64i.\n\nThus the resultant/product is:\n\n\u2003\u2003(-65 - 64i)(-65 + 64i) = (-65)² + (64)² = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nThe product over all 13 roots is therefore 8321. Since the original question asks for the remainder when this product is divided by 1000, we compute 8321 mod 1000 = 321. However, sub-task 2 is asking only for the product and not the final remainder mod 1000. Based on the wording of sub-task 2, the computed product is 8321.; answer: 8321\nCoT agent WdXw, on the purpose of computing product, thinking: We rewrite 2 - 2ω^k + ω^(2k) as ω^(2k) - 2ω^k + 2, which factors as (ω^k - (1+i)) (ω^k - (1-i)). Since ω ranges over all 13th roots of unity, the product ∏[k=0 to 12] (ω^k - (1+i)) equals –[(1+i)^13 - 1] (because ∏ (X-ω^k)=X^13-1, evaluated at X = 1+i, and a factor of (-1)^13 = -1 appears) and similarly for (1-i). Therefore, the overall product equals ((1+i)^13 - 1) ((1-i)^13 - 1). Noting that 1+i = √2 cis(π/4), we have (1+i)^13 = 2^(13/2) cis(13π/4). Since 13π/4 = 3π + π/4, we find cis(13π/4) = -cis(π/4) = - (√2/2 + i√2/2), so (1+i)^13 = -64(1+i) (because 2^(13/2)·(√2/2) = 2^7 = 128, and the overall factor becomes 128/2 = 64). Similarly, (1-i)^13 = -64(1-i). Thus, ((1+i)^13 - 1) = -64(1+i) - 1 = -65 - 64i and ((1-i)^13 - 1) = -65 + 64i. Multiplying these gives (-65-64i)(-65+64i) = 65^2 + 64^2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321. Hence, the product of all the terms is 8321.; answer: 8321\nCoT agent dY1j, on the purpose of computing product, thinking: We can rewrite each term as (ω^k)^2 - 2ω^k + 2, and note that the 13th roots of unity ω^k (for k = 0,...,12) are all the roots of x^13 - 1 = 0. A useful approach is to apply the identity ∏(g(ω^k)) = ∏_α((α)^13 - 1) where α runs through the roots of g(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2. The roots of g(x) are 1 + i and 1 - i. Since (1 + i) has magnitude √2 and argument 45°, we have (1 + i)^13 = (√2)^13 exp(i·13·45°) = 2^(13/2) exp(i·585°). Noting that 585° = 585 – 360 = 225° and exp(i·225°) = - (√2/2)(1 + i), we deduce (1 + i)^13 = -64(1 + i) (since 2^(13/2)·(√2/2) = 2^6 = 64). Hence, (1 + i)^13 - 1 = -64(1 + i) - 1 = -65 - 64i. Similarly, (1 - i)^13 - 1 = -65 + 64i. Their product is (-65 - 64i)(-65 + 64i) = 65^2 + 64^2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.
