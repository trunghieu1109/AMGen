Question: Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations:
\[\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}\]\[\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}\]\[\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}\]
Then the value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 0Vb5', content='We reexamined the original problem by setting a = log2(x), b = log2(y), and c = log2(z), which transforms the given equations into a - b - c = 1/2, b - a - c = 1/3, and c - a - b = 1/4. Adding these yields -(a+b+c) = 13/12, so a+b+c = -13/12. Then, by expressing a = 1/2 + b + c and substituting into the sum, we derive a = -7/24. Similarly, we compute b = -3/8 and c = -5/12. Calculating log2(x^4y^3z^2) results in 4a + 3b + 2c = -25/8, whose absolute value is 25/8. This shows m = 25 and n = 8, so m+n = 33.

Then the equations become: a - b - c = 1/2, b - a - c = 1/3, and c - a - b = 1/4. Adding all three equations gives -(a+b+c) = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 = 13/12, so a+b+c = -13/12. Now, from the first equation, a = 1/2 + b + c, and substituting into the sum gives 1/2 + 2b + 2c = -13/12 → b+c = -19/24. Next, using the second equation substituting a yields b - (1/2+b+c) - c = -1/2 - 2c = 1/3, so 2c = - (1/3+1/2) = -5/6, and hence c = -5/12. Then b = (b+c) - c = -19/24 + 5/12 = -3/8. Finally, a = 1/2 + b + c = 1/2 - 3/8 - 5/12 = -7/24. The expression to compute is log2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = 4a + 3b + 2c = 4(-7/24) + 3(-9/24) + 2(-10/24) = (-28 - 27 - 20)/24 = -75/24 = -25/8.
