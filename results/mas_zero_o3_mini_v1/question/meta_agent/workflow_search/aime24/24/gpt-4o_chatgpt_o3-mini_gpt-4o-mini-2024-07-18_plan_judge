Question: Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations:
\[\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}\]\[\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}\]\[\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}\]
Then the value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: We reexamined the original problem by setting a = log2(x), b = log2(y), and c = log2(z), which transforms the given equations into a - b - c = 1/2, b - a - c = 1/3, and c - a - b = 1/4. Adding these yields -(a+b+c) = 13/12, so a+b+c = -13/12. Then, by expressing a = 1/2 + b + c and substituting into the sum, we derive a = -7/24. Similarly, we compute b = -3/8 and c = -5/12. Calculating log2(x^4y^3z^2) results in 4a + 3b + 2c = -25/8, whose absolute value is 25/8. This shows m = 25 and n = 8, so m+n = 33. This refined verification confirms the original solution.
