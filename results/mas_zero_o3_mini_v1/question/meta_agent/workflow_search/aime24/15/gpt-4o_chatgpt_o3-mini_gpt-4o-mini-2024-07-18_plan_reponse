In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.",
        "correct_answer": "073",
        "n": "MAS-ZERO Workflow 15_Iteration_0",
        "response": "The refined calculation partitions the 900 residents into four groups: those with only candy hearts (a = 156), those owning candy hearts plus exactly one additional item (437 residents), those owning candy hearts plus exactly two additional items (234 residents), and those owning all four items (x). The equation is a + 437 + 234 + x = 900. By substituting a = 156, we obtain x = 900 - (156 + 437 + 234) = 73, confirming the refined calculation with the feedback taken into account.\n\nAnswer:73",
