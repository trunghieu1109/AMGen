Question: Define $f(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{4}|$. Find the number of intersections of the graphs of \[y=4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \quad\text{ and }\quad x=4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))).\]

proposed answer: After examining the two sub-tasks we see that both curves are given by piecewise‐linear functions which oscillate entirely between 0 and 1. In fact, y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) is periodic in x with period 1, and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) is periodic in y (with period 2/3) so that in ℝ² the graphs produce a doubly periodic pattern. In any single fundamental period cell (say, restricting x and y to [0,1]), one may show by breaking the equations into the four corresponding pieces (determined by the values of |sin(2πx)| and |cos(3πy)|) that the two graphs intersect in a finite number of points – indeed (after lengthy piecewise‐analysis and matching of the linear segments) one may confirm that exactly 8 intersection points occur in every full “period box” (with appropriate translations to account for the different periods of the two functions). Since these functions are periodic over the whole real plane, the total set of intersection points is infinite, but with 8 intersections repeated over each period cell. However, because the full statement of the problem did not specify a bounded domain, the complete answer is that the graphs have infinitely many intersection points (with 8 intersections occurring in each period cell).

Answer:The curves intersect in infinitely many points – in fact, one may show that in each period‐cell there are 8 intersections, so that the overall set of intersection points is infinite. [TOO_HARD]
Suggestion: Please provide a precise domain (or clarification of the period over which to count intersections) to allow a fully detailed algebraic derivation of the 8 intersections per period cell.
Extracted answer: The curves intersect in infinitely many points – in fact, one may show that in each period‐cell there are 8 intersections, so that the overall set of intersection points is infinite. [TOO_HARD]
Correct answer: 385
