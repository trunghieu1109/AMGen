The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$.\n\\[\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \\hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\\\ \\hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\\\ \\hline \\end{array}\\]",

        "response": "Both sub-task 3 and sub-task 4 yield the same set of valid grids: those where the top row is any three-digit number (allowing leading zeros) with a digit sum of 8, and the bottom row is uniquely determined as its 9's complement (i.e. 999 minus the top row). Therefore, the common combinations that satisfy both the horizontal and vertical conditions are exactly these 45 grids.\n\nAnswer:There are 45 valid combinations. Each grid is obtained by choosing any three-digit number with a digit sum of 8 for the top row and letting the bottom row be its 9's complement (e.g., 008/991, 017/982, 026/973, ..., 800/199).",
