Question: Find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid so that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is $999$, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is $99$. The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$.
\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\ \hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\ \hline \end{array}\]

proposed answer: Both sub-task 3 and sub-task 4 yield the same set of valid grids: those where the top row is any three-digit number (allowing leading zeros) with a digit sum of 8, and the bottom row is uniquely determined as its 9's complement (i.e. 999 minus the top row). Therefore, the common combinations that satisfy both the horizontal and vertical conditions are exactly these 45 grids.

Answer:There are 45 valid combinations. Each grid is obtained by choosing any three-digit number with a digit sum of 8 for the top row and letting the bottom row be its 9's complement (e.g., 008/991, 017/982, 026/973, ..., 800/199).
Extracted answer: There are 45 valid combinations. Each grid is obtained by choosing any three-digit number with a digit sum of 8 for the top row and letting the bottom row be its 9's complement (e.g., 008/991, 017/982, 026/973, ..., 800/199).
Correct answer: 045
