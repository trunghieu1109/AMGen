The maximum occurs when cos(θ + φ) = 1, which is when θ + φ = 2πk, for any integer k. This gives θ = 2πk - φ. Using k = 1 yields the principal value θ = 2π - arctan(4/3) which is equivalent to the answer from k = 0 expressed as θ = - arctan(4/3) modulo 2π.

This representation captures all complex numbers with modulus 4.; answer: z = 4e^(iθ) with θ ∈ [0, 2π)\nCoT agent 0AFn, on substituting and simplifying, thinking: We start with the original expression (75+117i)z + (96+144i)/z and substitute z = 4e^(iθ). The first term becomes 4(75+117i)e^(iθ). The second term becomes (96+144i)/(4e^(iθ)) = (24+36i)e^(-iθ). To extract the real parts, note that e^(iθ) = cosθ + i sinθ and e^(-iθ) = cosθ - i sinθ. For the first term, multiplying out gives 4(75 cosθ - 117 sinθ) as the real part. For the second term, the multiplication gives 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ as the real part. Adding both yields: 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ + 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. Hence, the real part expressed as a function of θ is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.; answer: Real part: 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ\nCritic agent MTgt, on reviewing simplification, feedback: The derivation is correct. The substitution of z with 4e^(iθ) was done properly and the resulting real part 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ is accurate.; correct: True\nDebate agent giFx, round 0, on maximizing real part, thinking: We start with the expression from sub-task 2: 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. Writing it in the form R cos(θ + φ) makes the maximization straightforward. Here, R = sqrt(324^2 + 432^2) = 540, and we match coefficients: 540 cosφ = 324 and 540 sinφ = 432, so tanφ = 432/324 = 4/3, i.e. φ = arctan(4/3). The cosine function is maximized when its argument is 0 mod 2π, i.e. when θ + φ = 2πk for some integer k. Solving this gives θ = - arctan(4/3) + 2πk. Typically, one writes the principal value as θ = 2π - arctan(4/3) (for k = 1).; answer: θ = -arctan(4/3) (mod 2π)\nDebate agent Wu9W, round 0, on maximizing real part, thinking: We have the real part expressed as 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ, which takes the form A cosθ + B sinθ with A = 324 and B = -432. This can be rewritten as R cos(θ - φ), where R = √(324² + 432²) = 540 and φ satisfies cosφ = 324/540 and sinφ = (432/540) but with a negative sign for the sine term, namely φ = arctan(432/324) = arctan(4/3). Because the sine term is negative in our expression, we have φ = -arctan(4/3). The maximum value of the cosine function, 1, is reached when θ - φ = 0, so the maximizing angle is θ = φ. Therefore, the value of θ that maximizes the real part is θ = -arctan(4/3) (mod 2π).; answer: θ = -arctan(4/3) (mod 2π)\nDebate agent giFx, round 1, on maximizing real part, thinking: We express the real part as 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ, which can be rewritten in the form R cos(θ + α) by factoring R = √(324² + 432²) = 540 and α = arctan(432/324) = arctan(4/3). This gives 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ = 540 cos(θ + arctan(4/3)). The cosine function attains its maximum value of 1 when its argument is 0 (mod 2π), so we require θ + arctan(4/3) = 0 (mod 2π). Thus, the maximum is achieved when θ = -arctan(4/3) (mod 2π).; answer: θ = -arctan(4/3) (mod 2π)\nDebate agent Wu9W, round 1, on maximizing real part, thinking: We rewrote the real part expression 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ in the form R cos(θ + φ) where R = sqrt(324^2 + 432^2) = 540 and φ satisfies tan φ = 432/324 = 4/3. The maximum of cos(θ + φ) is 1, which is achieved when θ + φ = 2πk (with k an integer). Thus the maximizing values of θ are given by θ = 2πk - φ.
