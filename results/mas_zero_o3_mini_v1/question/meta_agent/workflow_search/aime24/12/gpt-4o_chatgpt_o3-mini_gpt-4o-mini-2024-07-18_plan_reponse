They rewrote the expression 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8 in the form 540 cos(\u03b8 + \u03c6) with \u03c6 = arctan(432/324) = arctan(4/3). The maximum occurs when cos(\u03b8 + \u03c6) = 1, which is when \u03b8 + \u03c6 = 2\u03c0k, for any integer k. This gives \u03b8 = 2\u03c0k - \u03c6. Using k = 1 yields the principal value \u03b8 = 2\u03c0 - arctan(4/3) which is equivalent to the answer from k = 0 expressed as \u03b8 = - arctan(4/3) modulo 2\u03c0. Thus, adopting the principal (positive angle) form, the final decision is \u03b8 = 2\u03c0 - arctan(4/3).\n\nAnswer:\u03b8 = 2\u03c0 - arctan(4/3)",
