proposed answer: Both Debate Agent giFx and Wu9W essentially reached the same conclusion. They rewrote the expression 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ in the form 540 cos(θ + φ) with φ = arctan(432/324) = arctan(4/3). The maximum occurs when cos(θ + φ) = 1, which is when θ + φ = 2πk, for any integer k. This gives θ = 2πk - φ. Using k = 1 yields the principal value θ = 2π - arctan(4/3) which is equivalent to the answer from k = 0 expressed as θ = - arctan(4/3) modulo 2π. Thus, adopting the principal (positive angle) form, the final decision is θ = 2π - arctan(4/3).

Answer:θ = 2π - arctan(4/3)
Extracted answer: θ = 2π - arctan(4/3)
Correct answer: 540
