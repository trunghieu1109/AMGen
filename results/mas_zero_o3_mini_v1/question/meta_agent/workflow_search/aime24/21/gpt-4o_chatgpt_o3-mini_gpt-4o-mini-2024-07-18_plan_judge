Question: Find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon ($12$-gon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The diagram below shows three of those rectangles.
[asy] unitsize(0.6 inch); for(int i=0; i<360; i+=30) { dot(dir(i), 4+black); draw(dir(i)--dir(i+30)); } draw(dir(120)--dir(330)); filldraw(dir(210)--dir(240)--dir(30)--dir(60)--cycle, mediumgray, linewidth(1.5)); draw((0,0.366)--(0.366,0), linewidth(1.5)); [/asy]

proposed answer: Both debate agents concluded with a candidate count of 783 rectangles. However, they acknowledged that a comprehensive vertex-by-vertex analysis was necessary to fully confirm that every pair of chords indeed forms a closed rectangle. While the answer remains 783 based on the preliminary debate, the [TOO_HARD] mark is included due to the need for further detailed confirmation.

Answer:783
[TOO_HARD]
Suggestion: Provide a detailed vertex-based geometric breakdown that explicitly lists the chord connections and intersection points to confirm that each pair yields a closed rectangle.
Extracted answer: 783
Correct answer: 315
