    <pre>Related original question:

Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$..

 ### thinking by Debate Agent BzYD:
Based on the provided sub-tasks, we obtained m = 1, n = 1, and p = 4. Their sum is 1 + 1 + 4 = 6.

### thinking by Debate Agent 1nuB:
The provided inputs and sub-task solutions indicate that m = 1, n = 1, and p = 4. Their sum is 1 + 1 + 4 = 6.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Based on the outputs of sub-task 1, 2, and 3, sum m, n, and p to get the final answer.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry (for example, 300
[TOO_HARD]
Suggestion:...) and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
