However, due to ambiguities regarding the exact ordering of points D, E, C, F and the orientation of the rectangles with respect to the circle, a fully rigorous derivation is not possible without additional clarification. Thus, while the best available answer is based on previous estimates, further details are necessary for complete confirmation.\n\nAnswer:107\n[TOO_HARD]\nSuggestion: Please clarify the exact ordering of the collinear points D, E, C, F and detail the orientation of the rectangles relative to the circle for a rigorous solution.",
