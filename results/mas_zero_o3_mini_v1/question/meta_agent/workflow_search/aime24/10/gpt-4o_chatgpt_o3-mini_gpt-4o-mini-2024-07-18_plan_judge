Question: Rectangles $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are drawn such that $D,E,C,F$ are collinear. Also, $A,D,H,G$ all lie on a circle. If $BC=16$,$AB=107$,$FG=17$, and $EF=184$, what is the length of $CE$?
Iteration: MAS-ZERO Workflow 10_Iteration_0
proposed answer: The analysis from sub-task outputs converges on 107 for the value of CE. However, due to ambiguities regarding the exact ordering of points D, E, C, F and the orientation of the rectangles with respect to the circle, a fully rigorous derivation is not possible without additional clarification. Thus, while the best available answer is based on previous estimates, further details are necessary for complete confirmation.

Answer:107
[TOO_HARD]
Suggestion: Please clarify the exact ordering of the collinear points D, E, C, F and detail the orientation of the rectangles relative to the circle for a rigorous solution.
Extracted answer: 107
Correct answer: 104
