Question: Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_2
proposed answer: The total number of colorings of the octagon's 8 vertices, each colored red or blue independently with equal probability, is 2^8 = 256. We want the probability that there exists a rotation of the octagon such that all blue vertices map onto vertices that were originally red. From the detailed analysis and previous subtask, the number of favorable colorings satisfying this condition is 113. Since 113 and 256 share no common factors (113 is prime), the fraction 113/256 is already in lowest terms. Therefore, the probability is m/n = 113/256, with m=113 and n=256. The problem asks for m+n, which is 113 + 256 = 369.

proposed answer: The total number of colorings of the octagon's vertices is 2^8 = 256, since each vertex can be colored red or blue independently with equal probability. From the previous subtask, the number of favorable colorings (those for which there exists a rotation such that all blue vertices map onto originally red vertices) is 175. To find the probability, we divide the favorable colorings by the total colorings: 175/256. We then check if this fraction can be simplified. The prime factorization of 175 is 5^2 * 7, and 256 is 2^8. Since 175 and 256 share no common prime factors, the fraction is already in lowest terms. Therefore, the probability is 175/256. The problem asks for m + n, where m/n is the simplified fraction. Hence, m + n = 175 + 256 = 431.
