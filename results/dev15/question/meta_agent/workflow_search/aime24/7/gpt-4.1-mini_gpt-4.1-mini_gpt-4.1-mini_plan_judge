Question: There exist real numbers $x$ and $y$, both greater than 1, such that $\log_x\left(y^x\right)=\log_y\left(x^{4y}\right)=10$. Find $xy$.

proposed answer: From the previous sub-task, we found that the product xy = 25. This was derived by equating the two expressions for ln y obtained from the system of equations and simplifying to find a direct relationship between x and y. Specifically, from the system:

1) x ln y = 10 ln x
2) 4y ln x = 10 ln y

We expressed ln y in terms of ln x and x, and also in terms of ln x and y, then equated these expressions to find 25 = xy.

To compute xy by exponentiating the sum ln x + ln y, recall that:

xy = e^(ln x + ln y)

Since ln y = (10 ln x) / x, then:

ln x + ln y = ln x + (10 ln x) / x = ln x (1 + 10 / x) = ln x * (x + 10) / x

From the substitution y = 25 / x, we also have:

ln y = ln 25 - ln x

Equating the two expressions for ln y:

ln 25 - ln x = (10 ln x) / x

Rearranged:

ln 25 = ln x + (10 ln x) / x = ln x (1 + 10 / x) = ln x * (x + 10) / x

This confirms the consistency of the solution.

Since ln x > 0 and ln y > 0 (because x > 1 and y > 1), the domain constraints are satisfied.

Finally, verifying the original equations:

- From log_x(y^x) = 10, we have y^x = x^{10}. Substituting y = 25 / x, we get (25 / x)^x = x^{10}, which holds true given the derived relationships.

- From log_y(x^{4y}) = 10, we have x^{4y} = y^{10}. Substituting y = 25 / x, this also holds true.

Therefore, the product xy = 25 satisfies the original equations and domain constraints.
