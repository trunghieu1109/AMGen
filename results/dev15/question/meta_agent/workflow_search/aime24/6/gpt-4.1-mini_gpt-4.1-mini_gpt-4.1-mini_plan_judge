Question: Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.

proposed answer: The problem requires finding the minimal squared radius r^2 of the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box with dimensions x, y, z > 0, given the constraints surface area 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 and volume xyz = 23. The radius r is half the space diagonal d = sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2), so r^2 = d^2 / 4. Minimizing r^2 is equivalent to minimizing d^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 under the given constraints. To simplify the problem, we assume symmetry y = z = t, which is a common approach in symmetric optimization problems. This reduces the constraints to: 2(x t + t^2 + x t) = 54, or 2 x t + t^2 = 27, and volume x t^2 = 23. From the volume constraint, x = 23 / t^2. Substituting into the surface area constraint gives 2 * (23 / t^2) * t + t^2 = 27, which simplifies to 46 / t + t^2 = 27. Multiplying both sides by t yields the cubic equation t^3 - 27 t + 46 = 0. Testing integer roots, t=2 satisfies the cubic. Then x = 23 / 4 = 5.75. Checking constraints confirms they are satisfied. The squared diagonal is d^2 = x^2 + 2 t^2 = (23/4)^2 + 2 * 4 = 529/16 + 8 = 657/16. Therefore, r^2 = d^2 / 4 = (657/16) / 4 = 657/64. Since 657 and 64 share no common factors, the fraction is in lowest terms. Hence, p = 657, q = 64, and p + q = 721. This solution is consistent, satisfies constraints, and is minimal by symmetry and reasoning. Thus, the final answer is 721.
