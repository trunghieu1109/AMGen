Question: Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.

proposed answer: To determine for which values of n ≤ 2024 Bob has a guaranteed winning strategy, we analyze the game states as winning or losing positions. Since Alice moves first, Bob can guarantee a win if the initial position is losing for Alice. A losing position is one where any move leads to a winning position for the opponent. The allowed moves are removing 1 or 4 tokens. Starting from the base case: n=0 is losing (no moves possible). For n=1, Alice can remove 1 token and win immediately, so n=1 is winning. For n=2, Alice can only remove 1 token leaving n=1 (winning for opponent), so n=2 is losing. Continuing this analysis, the pattern of losing positions emerges as those where n mod 5 equals 0 or 2. This pattern repeats every 5 integers. To count how many n ≤ 2024 satisfy n mod 5 = 0 or 2, we count multiples of 5 up to 2024 and numbers congruent to 2 mod 5 up to 2024. The number of multiples of 5 ≤ 2024 is floor(2024/5) = 404. The numbers congruent to 2 mod 5 are of the form 5k + 2. The largest k satisfies 5k + 2 ≤ 2024 → k ≤ 404, giving 405 such numbers (k=0 to 404). Total losing positions = 404 + 405 = 809. Therefore, there are 809 positive integers n ≤ 2024 for which Bob can guarantee a win. This reasoning is consistent with the pattern of losing positions and the counting of residues modulo 5.
