Question: Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.

proposed answer: The problem states that the inradius r of the tetrahedron can be expressed in the form (m√n)/p, where m, n, p are positive integers, m and p are coprime, and n is square-free. From the previous sub-task, the inradius was found to be (216√2)/110. To simplify this, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 216 and 110, which is 2. Dividing numerator and denominator by 2, we get (108√2)/55. Next, we check if 108 and 55 are coprime. The prime factors of 108 are 2^2 * 3^3, and for 55 are 5 * 11, so they share no common factors, confirming they are coprime. The number under the square root is 2, which is prime and thus square-free. Therefore, the simplified form of the inradius is (108√2)/55, with m=108, n=2, and p=55. The problem asks for the sum m + n + p, which is 108 + 2 + 55 = 165. This step-by-step simplification and verification ensure the answer is correct and consistent with the problem's requirements.

proposed answer: From sub-task 13, the inradius r of the tetrahedron was found using the formula r = (3V)/S, where V is the volume and S is the total surface area. The tetrahedron has four congruent faces, each with sides √41, √80, and √89. Using Heron's formula, the area of one face A was calculated as 13/√2, which rationalizes to (13√2)/2. The total surface area S = 4A = 4 * (13/√2) = 52/√2, which rationalizes to 26√2. The volume V was given as 60√2. Substituting these values into the inradius formula gives r = (3 * 60√2) / (26√2) = 180√2 / 26√2 = 180 / 26 = 90 / 13. This is a rational number and can be expressed as (90√1)/13, where m = 90, n = 1, and p = 13. The conditions are satisfied: m and p are coprime (since 90 and 13 share no common factors), and n = 1 is square-free. Therefore, the sum m + n + p = 90 + 1 + 13 = 104. This sum is the final answer, justified by the correct application of geometric formulas, simplification, and verification of the conditions on m, n, and p.
