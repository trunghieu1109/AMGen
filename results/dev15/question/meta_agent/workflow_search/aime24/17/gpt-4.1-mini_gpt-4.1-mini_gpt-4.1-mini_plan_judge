Question: Find the number of triples of nonnegative integers \((a,b,c)\) satisfying \(a + b + c = 300\) and
\begin{equation*}
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.
\end{equation*}

proposed answer: We are asked to count the total number of triples (a,b,c) of nonnegative integers summing to 300 that satisfy the polynomial constraint a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000. From the detailed analysis, the polynomial can be rewritten as 100S2 - S3 = 2,000,000, where S1 = a + b + c = 300, S2 = ab + bc + ca, and S3 = abc. We found that the triple (100,100,100) satisfies the equation exactly. Testing other cases, including when two variables are equal or fixing one variable and solving for the others, yields no other integer solutions. Since (100,100,100) is the only solution, and all permutations of this triple are identical (because all three numbers are equal), the number of distinct triples counting permutations is 1. Therefore, the total number of such triples is 1.

proposed answer: The problem requires finding all nonnegative integer triples (a,b,c) such that a + b + c = 300 and a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000. By rewriting the polynomial constraint using symmetric sums, we find it equals (a+b+c)(ab+bc+ca) - 3abc. Given a+b+c=300, the constraint becomes 300*(ab+bc+ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000, or equivalently 100q - r = 2,000,000 where q = ab+bc+ca and r = abc. We analyze cases: (1) symmetric triple a=b=c=100 satisfies the equation; (2) two equal variables lead to a cubic equation with only the symmetric solution; (3) boundary cases with one variable zero reduce to ab*300=6,000,000, so ab=20,000, and solving a+b=300, ab=20,000 yields (100,200) and (200,100) pairs, giving 6 ordered triples with zero in each position. No other solutions are found after checking the cubic and constraints. The counting is consistent with ordered triples, so total solutions are 7. The algebraic manipulations, discriminant checks, and symmetry considerations confirm no solutions are missed. Thus, the solution set is complete and correct.
