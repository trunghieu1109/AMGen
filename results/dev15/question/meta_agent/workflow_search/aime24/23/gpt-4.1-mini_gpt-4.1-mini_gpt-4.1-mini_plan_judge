Question: Find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid so that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is $999$, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is $99$. The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$.
\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\ \hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\ \hline \end{array}\]

proposed answer: The problem reduces to finding all digit assignments to the 2x3 grid such that the sum of the two row-formed numbers is 999 and the sum of the three column-formed numbers is 99. By analyzing the problem, we let the top row digits be (a,b,c) and the bottom row digits be (d,e,f). The conditions imply that d=9-a, e=9-b, f=9-c, and a+b+c=8. Since each digit must be between 0 and 9, and the sum a+b+c=8, we count the number of nonnegative integer solutions to this equation with each digit â‰¤ 9. Using the stars and bars theorem, the number of solutions is C(8+3-1,3-1) = C(10,2) = 45. For each such triple (a,b,c), the corresponding (d,e,f) is uniquely determined and valid. Therefore, there are 45 valid digit assignments to the grid that satisfy all constraints. This count includes all possible assignments without duplicates, as each (a,b,c) uniquely determines (d,e,f). Hence, the total number of valid digit assignments is 45.
