To ensure this fraction is in lowest terms, we check if the numerator and denominator share any common factors other than 1. The numerator is 1, which is relatively prime to any positive integer, so the fraction 1/115 is already in simplest form. The reasoning behind this fraction comes from the ratio of the probability of winning the grand prize (1/210) to the probability of winning any prize (23/42). Simplifying (1/210) / (23/42) = (1/210) * (42/23) = 42 / (210 * 23) = (42/210) * (1/23) = (1/5) * (1/23) = 1/115. Since 1 and 115 share no common factors, the fraction is simplified correctly. Therefore, the fraction m/n = 1/115 with m=1 and n=115 is the correct simplified form.\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 2: Compute the sum m + n of the numerator and denominator of the simplified fraction as required by the problem.Given previous attempts and feedback, carefully consider where you could go wrong in your latest attempt.

Since the order of selection does not matter and the subsets must be distinct, this is a combination problem. The number of ways to choose k elements from a set of n elements is given by the binomial coefficient C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n-k)!). Here, n = 10 and k = 4. Therefore, the total number of 4-element subsets is C(10, 4). Calculating C(10, 4) = 10! / (4! * 6!) = (10 * 9 * 8 * 7) / (4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = 210.

We want to find the number of 4-element subsets of S that have exactly k elements in common with Jen\'s chosen subset, for k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. To do this, consider the following: Jen\'s chosen subset has 4 elements, and the remaining elements in S are 10 - 4 = 6 elements. For a subset to have exactly k elements in common with Jen\'s subset, we must choose k elements from Jen\'s 4 chosen elements and (4 - k) elements from the remaining 6 elements. The number of ways to do this is the product of the combinations: C(4, k) * C(6, 4 - k). We calculate this for each k from 0 to 4. For k=0: C(4,0)*C(6,4) = 1*15 = 15.

Therefore, the probability is 115 / 210. This fraction can be simplified by dividing numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 5, resulting in 23 / 42.
