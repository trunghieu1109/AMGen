Question: Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_12_9
proposed answer: We are given the simplified fraction m/n = 1/115 representing the probability of winning the grand prize given that Jen won a prize. To find m + n, we simply add the numerator and denominator of the fraction. Since the fraction is already in lowest terms (1 and 115 share no common factors other than 1), the sum is 1 + 115 = 116. This is straightforward because the numerator is 1, which is relatively prime to any positive integer, and the denominator is 115. Therefore, the sum m + n = 116.
