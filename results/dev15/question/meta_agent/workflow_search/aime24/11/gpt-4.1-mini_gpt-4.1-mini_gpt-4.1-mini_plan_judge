Question: Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.
[asy] size(10cm); usepackage("tikz");label("\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(2,0)--(2,3)--(5,3)--(5,8)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}",origin); label("\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(0,3)--(3,3)--(3,5)--(8,5)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}",E); [/asy]

proposed answer: The problem asks for the total number of lattice paths from (0,0) to (8,8) with exactly four direction changes. Each path consists of 16 steps: 8 rights (R) and 8 ups (U). A direction change occurs when the path switches from R to U or U to R. Exactly four direction changes mean the path has exactly five runs (segments) alternating between R and U. The runs have positive lengths and must sum to 8 for the R moves and 8 for the U moves. There are two possible patterns for the runs: starting with R (R-U-R-U-R) or starting with U (U-R-U-R-U). For the pattern starting with R, there are 3 R runs and 2 U runs; for the pattern starting with U, there are 3 U runs and 2 R runs. The number of positive integer solutions to x1 + x2 + ... + xk = n is C(n-1, k-1). Thus, for 3 runs summing to 8, the number of solutions is C(7,2) = 21, and for 2 runs summing to 8, the number of solutions is C(7,1) = 7. For the pattern starting with R, the total number of run length distributions is 21 * 7 = 147. For the pattern starting with U, it is also 21 * 7 = 147. Since these two cases are mutually exclusive and cover all possibilities, the total number of such paths is 147 + 147 = 294. This reasoning is consistent and complete, accounting for both starting directions and all valid run length partitions, and matches the combinatorial formula for positive integer partitions and the problem's conditions exactly.
