Question: Alice chooses a set $A$ of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets $B$ of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of $B$ belongs to $A$. Bob's list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_26
proposed answer: We are given the set A = {4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11} from the previous step, which corresponds to the powers of two that sum to 2024 as 2^(m-1) for each m in A. To find the sum of the elements of A, we simply add all the elements in the set. The sum is 4 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11. Adding these step-by-step: 4 + 6 = 10, 10 + 7 = 17, 17 + 8 = 25, 25 + 9 = 34, 34 + 10 = 44, 44 + 11 = 55. Therefore, the sum of the elements of A is 55. This sum is the final answer to the problem, as it directly answers the question asked. The reasoning is straightforward and consistent with the problem's conditions and the previous step's conclusion about the set A.
