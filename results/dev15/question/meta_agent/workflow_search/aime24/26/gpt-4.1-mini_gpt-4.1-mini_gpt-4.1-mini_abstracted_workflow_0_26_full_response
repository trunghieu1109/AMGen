The largest power of two less than or equal to 2024 is 2^10 = 1024. Subtracting 1024 from 2024 leaves 1000. Next, 2^9 = 512 fits into 1000, leaving 488. Then 2^8 = 256 fits into 488, leaving 232. Next, 2^7 = 128 fits into 232, leaving 104. Then 2^6 = 64 fits into 104, leaving 40. Next, 2^5 = 32 fits into 40, leaving 8. Finally, 2^3 = 8 fits exactly into 8, leaving 0. So, 2024 = 2^{10} + 2^{9} + 2^{8} + 2^{7} + 2^{6} + 2^{5} + 2^{3}. The exponents where the binary representation has 1s are {10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 3}. According to the problem, each element m in A corresponds to 2^{m-1}, so m = exponent + 1. Adding 1 to each exponent, we get the set A = {11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 4}. Sorting in ascending order, A = {4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11}. This set A is consistent with the problem\'s condition that the sum over m in A of 2^{m-1} equals 2024.

Since the sets B with different maximum elements are disjoint, the total number of sets B is the sum over all m in A of 2^(m-1). Given that the total number of such sets B is 2024, we have the equation sum_{m in A} 2^(m-1) = 2024. This means that 2024 can be expressed as a sum of distinct powers of two, where the exponents are (m-1) for m in A. Since powers of two are unique in their binary representation, this corresponds exactly to representing 2024 in binary form and identifying which powers of two sum to 2024.
