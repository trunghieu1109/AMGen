We need to find the absolute value of log2(x^4 y^3 z^2), which can be expressed using logarithm properties as 4a + 3b + 2c. Substituting the values, we get 4*(-7/24) + 3*(-3/8) + 2*(-5/12). Calculating each term: 4*(-7/24) = -28/24 = -7/6, 3*(-3/8) = -9/8, 2*(-5/12) = -10/12 = -5/6. To add these fractions, we find a common denominator, which is 24. Converting each fraction: -7/6 = -28/24, -9/8 = -27/24, -5/6 = -20/24. Summing these: (-28 - 27 - 20)/24 = -75/24. Simplifying -75/24 by dividing numerator and denominator by 3 gives -25/8. Taking the absolute value yields 25/8. Since 25 and 8 share no common factors other than 1, the fraction is already in lowest terms. Therefore, m = 25 and n = 8, and m + n = 33. This step-by-step simplification ensures no errors in fraction addition or reduction, confirming the final answer.\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Calculate the sum m + n from the reduced fraction obtained and present the final answer.Given previous attempts and feedback, carefully consider where you could go wrong in your latest attempt.
