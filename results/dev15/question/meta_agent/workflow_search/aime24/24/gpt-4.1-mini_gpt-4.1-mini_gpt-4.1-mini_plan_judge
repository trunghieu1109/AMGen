Question: Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations:
\[\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}\]\[\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}\]\[\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}\]
Then the value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_24
proposed answer: From the previous sub-task, we have the reduced fraction for |log2(x^4 y^3 z^2)| as 25/8. This fraction is already in lowest terms since 25 and 8 share no common factors other than 1. The problem asks for the sum m + n where the fraction is m/n. Here, m = 25 and n = 8. Therefore, m + n = 25 + 8 = 33. This is a straightforward addition of the numerator and denominator of the simplified fraction, and no further reduction is possible. Hence, the final answer is 33.
