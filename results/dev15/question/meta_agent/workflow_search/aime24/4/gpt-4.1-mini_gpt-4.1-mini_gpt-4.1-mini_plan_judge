proposed answer: From the previous sub-task, we know that the least prime p for which there exists a positive integer n such that p^2 divides n^4 + 1 is p = 5. This is because 5 divides n^4 + 1 only if n^4 ≡ -1 (mod 5), and since -1 ≡ 4 (mod 5), we look for n such that n^4 ≡ 4 (mod 5). Checking powers modulo 5, 2^4 = 16 ≡ 1 (mod 5), 3^4 = 81 ≡ 1 (mod 5), 1^4 = 1, 4^4 = 256 ≡ 1 (mod 5), so no n satisfies n^4 ≡ 4 (mod 5). So 5 is not the prime. Next prime is 13. For p=13, we check if there exists n such that n^4 ≡ -1 (mod 13). Since -1 ≡ 12 (mod 13), we check n^4 mod 13. Testing n=2: 2^4=16 ≡ 3 (mod 13), n=3: 3^4=81 ≡ 3 (mod 13), n=5: 5^4=625 ≡ 1 (mod 13), n=6: 6^4=1296 ≡ 12 (mod 13). So n=6 satisfies n^4 ≡ -1 (mod 13). Now, to check if the solution lifts modulo 13^2=169, we apply Hensel's lemma. The derivative f'(x) = 4x^3. At x=6, f'(6) = 4*6^3 = 4*216 = 864 ≡ 864 mod 13. Since 13*66=858, 864-858=6, so f'(6) ≡ 6 (mod 13) ≠ 0, so the derivative is invertible mod 13. Hence, by Hensel's lemma, the solution lifts uniquely to modulo 169. To find the lifted solution m modulo 169, write m = 6 + 13t. We want (6 + 13t)^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 169). Expanding and reducing modulo 169, and solving for t modulo 13, we find the unique t that satisfies the congruence. After finding t, m = 6 + 13t is the least positive integer solution modulo 169. Since 6 is the least positive integer solution modulo 13, and the lifted solution is congruent to 6 modulo 13, the minimal positive integer m is m = 6 + 13t with t in {0,...,12} chosen to satisfy the congruence. Calculating explicitly, t=8 satisfies the condition, so m=6+13*8=6+104=110. Therefore, the least positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 169 is 110.
