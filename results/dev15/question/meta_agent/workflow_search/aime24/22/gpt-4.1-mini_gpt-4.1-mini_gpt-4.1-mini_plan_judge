Question: A list of positive integers has the following properties:
$\bullet$ The sum of the items in the list is $30$.
$\bullet$ The unique mode of the list is $9$.
$\bullet$ The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.
Find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

proposed answer: To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given conditions: the list consists of positive integers, the sum of the list is 30, the unique mode is 9, and the median is a positive integer not present in the list. The median not being in the list implies the list length is even, as the median is the average of the two middle numbers in a sorted list. The unique mode 9 means 9 appears more times than any other number. We try the smallest even length, 4, for simplicity. Let the list be [a, b, 9, 9] sorted in ascending order. The sum condition gives a + b + 18 = 30, so a + b = 12. The median is (b + 9)/2, which must be a positive integer not in the list. Testing values for b, b=7 gives median = 8, which is not in the list [5, 7, 9, 9]. This list satisfies all conditions: sum is 30, unique mode is 9, median is 8 (not in the list), and all elements are positive integers. Calculating the sum of squares: 5^2 + 7^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 = 25 + 49 + 81 + 81 = 236. No other list meets all these constraints simultaneously, so the final answer is 236.
