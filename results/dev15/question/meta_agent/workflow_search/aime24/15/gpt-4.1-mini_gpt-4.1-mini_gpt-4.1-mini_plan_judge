Question: Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_0_15
proposed answer: We start with the system of equations and variables defined in the previous step:

Variables:
- x = number owning all three items besides candy hearts (D ∩ G ∩ S)
- b = number owning exactly D and G
- c = number owning exactly D and S
- d = number owning exactly G and S
- e = number owning exactly D
- f = number owning exactly G
- g = number owning exactly S
- only_candy_hearts = number owning only candy hearts

Equations:
1) e + f + g = 437 (exactly two items including candy hearts, meaning candy hearts + exactly one of D, G, S)
2) b + c + d = 234 (exactly three items including candy hearts, meaning candy hearts + exactly two of D, G, S)
3) e + b + c + x = 195 (total owning diamond ring)
4) f + b + d + x = 367 (total owning golf clubs)
5) g + c + d + x = 562 (total owning garden spade)
6) e + f + g + b + c + d + x + only_candy_hearts = 900 (total residents)

From (1) and (2), we know sums of variables representing exactly one and exactly two of the three items (excluding candy hearts).

We want to find x, the number owning all four items (since everyone owns candy hearts).

Step 1: Add equations (3), (4), and (5):
(e + b + c + x) + (f + b + d + x) + (g + c + d + x) = 195 + 367 + 562 = 1124

Left side:
e + f + g + 2b + 2c + 2d + 3x = 1124

Step 2: From (1) and (2), we have:
e + f + g = 437
b + c + d = 234

Multiply (2) by 2:
2b + 2c + 2d = 468

Substitute into the sum:
437 + 468 + 3x = 1124

Combine:
905 + 3x = 1124

Subtract 905:
3x = 219

Divide by 3:
x = 73

Step 3: Verify consistency.

We have x = 73.

This means 73 residents own all four items.

This value is consistent with the total counts and the sums of exactly two and exactly three items.

Therefore, the number of residents owning all four items is 73.
