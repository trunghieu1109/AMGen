Question: Alice chooses a set $A$ of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets $B$ of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of $B$ belongs to $A$. Bob's list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A.

proposed answer: The set A from Sub-task 1.2 is {4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11}. To find the sum of the elements of A, we add each element together step-by-step. Start by adding the smallest elements: 4 + 6 = 10. Then add the next element: 10 + 7 = 17. Next, add 8: 17 + 8 = 25. Add 9: 25 + 9 = 34. Add 10: 34 + 10 = 44. Finally, add 11: 44 + 11 = 55. Therefore, the sum of the elements of A is 55. This calculation is straightforward addition of integers in the set A, ensuring no element is missed or counted twice.
