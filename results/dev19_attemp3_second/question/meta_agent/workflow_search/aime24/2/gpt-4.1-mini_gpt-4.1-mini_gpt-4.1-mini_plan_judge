Question: Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?

proposed answer: The total number of ways to color the vertices of a regular octagon, each vertex independently colored red or blue with equal probability, is 2^8 = 256. From Sub-task 3, the total number of valid colorings (those that can be rotated so that all blue vertices map onto originally red vertices) without double counting is 46. Therefore, the probability that a randomly chosen coloring satisfies the condition is 46/256. To express this probability in lowest terms, we find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of 46 and 256. The gcd of 46 and 256 is 2. Dividing numerator and denominator by 2, the fraction reduces to 23/128. Thus, the probability in lowest terms is m/n = 23/128. Finally, we compute m + n = 23 + 128 = 151.

proposed answer: The total number of ways to color the vertices of a regular octagon with two colors (red or blue) independently and with equal probability is 2^8 = 256. From the previous sub-task, the number of valid colorings (those for which there exists a rotation such that all blue vertices map onto originally red vertices) is 255. Therefore, the probability is the ratio of valid colorings to total colorings, which is 255/256. To ensure the fraction is in lowest terms, we check the greatest common divisor (gcd) of 255 and 256. Since 255 factors as 3 * 5 * 17 and 256 is 2^8, they share no common factors other than 1, so the fraction is already in simplest form. Finally, we compute m + n where the fraction is m/n = 255/256, so m + n = 255 + 256 = 511.
