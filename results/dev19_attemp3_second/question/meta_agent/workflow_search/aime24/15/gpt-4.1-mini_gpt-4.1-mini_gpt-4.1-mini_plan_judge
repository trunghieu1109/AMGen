Question: Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.

proposed answer: The problem involves four items: diamond rings (D), golf clubs (G), garden spades (S), and candy hearts (C). Every one of the 900 residents owns candy hearts, so candy hearts are universally owned. The counts given are: 195 own D, 367 own G, 562 own S, and 900 own C. Additionally, 437 residents own exactly two items, and 234 own exactly three items. The key question is whether the counts of exactly two and exactly three items include candy hearts or not. If candy hearts are excluded, the numbers lead to contradictions or impossible negative values when trying to reconcile the total owners of each item with the counts of exactly one, two, and three items. Including candy hearts as one of the items in these counts resolves these contradictions. Under this interpretation: - Exactly one item means owning candy hearts only. - Exactly two items means owning candy hearts plus exactly one of the other three items. - Exactly three items means owning candy hearts plus exactly two of the other three items. - Exactly four items means owning candy hearts plus all three other items. Using the total owners of each item (195 + 367 + 562 + 900 = 2024) and the counts of residents owning exactly two (437) and exactly three (234) items, we set variables: x1 = number owning exactly one item (candy hearts only), x4 = number owning all four items. The total residents equation is: 900 = x1 + 437 + 234 + x4. The sum of owners equation is: 2024 = x1 + 2*437 + 3*234 + 4*x4 = x1 + 874 + 702 + 4*x4 = x1 + 1576 + 4*x4. Substituting x1 from the first equation into the second gives: 2024 = (229 - x4) + 1576 + 4*x4 = 1805 + 3*x4. Solving for x4 yields: 3*x4 = 219, so x4 = 73. Then x1 = 229 - 73 = 156. This distribution is consistent with all given data and resolves contradictions. Therefore, the number of residents owning all four items (diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spades, and candy hearts) is 73. This conclusion is supported by multiple agents' detailed algebraic analyses and is the most consistent interpretation of the problem data.
