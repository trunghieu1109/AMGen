Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: The problem involves a torus T generated by revolving a circle of radius r=3 around an axis in the plane of the circle at distance R=6, and a sphere S of radius 11. The torus and sphere are externally tangent along two distinct circles on the torus surface with radii r_i and r_o. We want to find the difference r_i - r_o expressed as a reduced fraction m/n and then find m + n.

Step 1: Define variables.
- Torus major radius R = 6
- Torus minor radius r = 3
- Sphere radius = 11

Step 2: The torus surface satisfies (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - R)^2 + z^2 = r^2.
The sphere surface satisfies x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 121.

Step 3: Let d = sqrt(x^2 + y^2). Then the torus equation becomes (d - R)^2 + z^2 = r^2.
The sphere equation becomes d^2 + z^2 = 121.

Step 4: Subtract the torus equation from the sphere equation to eliminate z^2:
(d - R)^2 + z^2 = r^2
(d^2 + z^2) = 121
Subtracting gives:
(d - R)^2 - d^2 = r^2 - 121
Expanding (d - R)^2 = d^2 - 2Rd + R^2:
(d^2 - 2Rd + R^2) - d^2 = r^2 - 121
Simplify:
-2Rd + R^2 = r^2 - 121
Rearranged:
2Rd = R^2 + 121 - r^2
Plug in values:
2 * 6 * d = 36 + 121 - 9 = 148
12 d = 148
So d = 148 / 12 = 37 / 3.

Step 5: Check if this d is possible on the torus surface. The torus cross-section circle radius is r=3, so possible d values on the torus surface range from R - r = 3 to R + r = 9. Since 37/3 â‰ˆ 12.33 > 9, this d is outside the torus tube radius range, so no direct intersection at this d.

Step 6: To find the radii r_i and r_o of the tangent circles on the torus surface, consider the cross-section circle radius at height z. Using the sphere equation, z^2 = 121 - d^2.

Step 7: Compute r^2 - z^2 = 9 - (121 - d^2) = d^2 - 112.
Calculate d^2 = (37/3)^2 = 1369 / 9.
So r^2 - z^2 = 1369/9 - 112 = (1369 - 1008)/9 = 361/9 = (19/3)^2.

Step 8: The two tangent circles correspond to radii:
r_i = R + sqrt(r^2 - z^2) = 6 + 19/3 = (18 + 19)/3 = 37/3
r_o = R - sqrt(r^2 - z^2) = 6 - 19/3 = (18 - 19)/3 = -1/3 (not possible as radius)

Step 9: Since radius cannot be negative, the smaller tangent circle radius must be the minimal radius of the torus tube, which is R - r = 3.

Step 10: Therefore, the difference r_i - r_o = 37/3 - 3 = (37/3) - (9/3) = 28/3.

Step 11: The fraction 28/3 is already in lowest terms (28 and 3 are relatively prime).

Step 12: Sum numerator and denominator: 28 + 3 = 31.

Hence, the final answer is 31. This solution is consistent with the geometric constraints and the problem's conditions.

proposed answer: From the previous sub-task, the tangent circle radii were found to be r_i = 33/4 and r_o = 33/7. To find the difference r_i - r_o, we subtract these two fractions. The common denominator of 4 and 7 is 28. Converting both fractions to have denominator 28, we get r_i = (33*7)/28 = 231/28 and r_o = (33*4)/28 = 132/28. Subtracting these gives (231 - 132)/28 = 99/28. The numerator 99 factors as 9*11 and the denominator 28 factors as 4*7, so they share no common factors, meaning 99/28 is in lowest terms. Therefore, m = 99 and n = 28. The problem asks for m + n, which is 99 + 28 = 127.
