Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Final Decision Agent COkg', content='From the previous sub-task, the tangent circle radii were found to be r_i = 33/4 and r_o = 33/7. To find the difference r_i - r_o, we subtract these two fractions. The common denominator of 4 and 7 is 28. Converting both fractions to have denominator 28, we get r_i = (33*7)/28 = 231/28 and r_o = (33*4)/28 = 132/28. Subtracting these gives (231 - 132)/28 = 99/28.

The torus surface satisfies (r - 6)^2 + z^2 = 9. The sphere S has radius 11. When the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, the tangency occurs along a circle on the torus surface. The vertical shifts h1 = 2 sqrt(7) and h2 = 4 sqrt(10) correspond to two possible positions of the torus relative to the sphere where tangency occurs. For each h_k, the radius r_k of the tangent circle on the torus surface in the xy-plane is found by substituting h_k into the torus parametrization. From previous derivations, the radius r_k is given by r_k = 336 / (36 + h_k^2) + 3. Substituting h1^2 = 28, we get r1 = 336 / 64 + 3 = 5.25 + 3 = 8.25. Substituting h2^2 = 160, we get r2 = 336 / 196 + 3 ≈ 1.714 + 3 = 4.714. Both values lie within the valid range [3, 9] for the torus cross-section radius, confirming geometric feasibility. Since the problem states that r_i and r_o are the radii of the tangent circles when the torus rests on the outside of the sphere in two different ways, and given that r1 > r2, it is natural to assign r_i = 8.25 and r_o = 4.714. This synthesis finalizes the tangent circle radii as r_i = 8.25 and r_o = 4.714, accurately reflecting the geometry and tangency conditions of the problem.\n\n### answer by Final Decision Agent HgUV:\n{\'r_i\': 8.25, \'r_o\': 4.714}\n\n### Stage 2 Sub-task 1: Calculate the difference r_i - r_o between the two tangent circle radii obtained in Stage 1. Express this difference as a reduced fraction m/n where m and n are relatively prime positive integers, and compute the sum m + n as the final answer. Ensure the fraction is fully simplified and consistent with geometric constraints. \n\n ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent 37Fz:\nGiven r_i = 8.25 and r_o = 4.714, we calculate the difference r_i - r_o = 8.25 - 4.714 = 3.536. To express these decimals as fractions, note that 8.25 = 33/4 and 4.714 = 33/7. Since 4.714 was approximated, let\'s verify its exact fraction from the provided formula: r_k = 336 / (36 + h_k^2) + 3. For h2^2 = 160, denominator = 196, so 336/196 = 12/7, hence r_o = 12/7 + 3 = 12/7 + 21/7 = 33/7. Therefore, r_o = 33/7 exactly. Similarly, r_i = 33/4 exactly. Then, r_i - r_o = 33/4 - 33/7 = 33*(7 - 4)/(4*7) = 33*3/28 = 99/28. The fraction 99/28 is already in lowest terms since 99 = 9*11 and 28 = 4*7, no common factors. Finally, m + n = 99 + 28 = 127.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent KPVZ:\nWe are given r_i = 8.25 and r_o = 4.714 from the synthesis. First, express these decimal values as fractions. 8.25 = 33/4 because 8.25 = 8 + 0.25 = 8 + 1/4 = 33/4. For 4.714, which is 4 + 0.714, note that 0.714 is approximately 5/7 (since 5/7 ≈ 0.7142857). From the previous steps, r_o was given as 336/196 + 3 = (336/196) + 3. Simplify 336/196: 336/196 = (336 ÷ 28)/(196 ÷ 28) = 12/7 = 1.714. Adding 3 gives 1.714 + 3 = 4.714 = 4 + 5/7 = 33/7. So r_o = 33/7. Now, calculate r_i - r_o = (33/4) - (33/7). Find common denominator: 4*7=28. Convert fractions: (33/4) = (33*7)/28 = 231/28, (33/7) = (33*4)/28 = 132/28. Subtract: 231/28 - 132/28 = (231 - 132)/28 = 99/28. The fraction 99/28 is already in lowest terms since 99 = 9*11 and 28 = 4*7, no common factors. So m = 99, n = 28. Finally, m + n = 99 + 28 = 127.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent eYMg:\nFrom the previous sub-task, we have r_i = 8.25 and r_o = 4.714. First, convert these decimals to fractions. 8.25 = 33/4 since 8 = 32/4 and 0.25 = 1/4. For 4.714, note that 4.714 = 4 + 5/7 = 33/7 (since 4*7=28 and 28+5=33). Now, calculate the difference r_i - r_o = 33/4 - 33/7. To subtract, find the common denominator: 4*7=28. Convert fractions: 33/4 = (33*7)/28 = 231/28, 33/7 = (33*4)/28 = 132/28. Subtract: 231/28 - 132/28 = 99/28. The fraction 99/28 is in lowest terms since 99 = 9*11 and 28 = 4*7, and they share no common factors other than 1. Therefore, m = 99 and n = 28.

For external tangency along a circle, the two surfaces must intersect in a circle and have matching tangent planes at every point on this circle. This means the intersection curve satisfies both surface equations simultaneously, and the gradients (normals) of the two surfaces at each point on the circle are parallel (∇F = λ ∇G for some scalar λ). By defining F and G as the implicit functions of the torus and sphere respectively, and computing their gradients, we find the conditions for tangency. The gradients lead to the relations λ = (r - 6)/r and (z - h) = λ z, where r = sqrt(x^2 + y^2). From these, we derive z = (h/6) r. Substituting into the sphere and torus equations yields two equations in r and h, which can be combined into a quadratic in A = 36 + h^2.

The external tangency condition implies the surfaces intersect along a circle where their gradients are parallel. Introducing r = sqrt(x^2 + y^2), the gradient condition gives z = (h/6) r. Substituting z into the sphere equation yields r^2 (1 + h^2/36) = 121, or r^2 = 4356 / (36 + h^2). Substituting z and r^2 into the torus equation leads to (r - 6)^2 + (z - h)^2 = 9. Replacing z by (h/6) r, the torus equation becomes (r - 6)^2 + h^2 (r/6 - 1)^2 = 9, which simplifies to (r - 6)^2 (1 + h^2/36) = 9. Defining A = 36 + h^2, this is (r - 6)^2 * (A/36) = 9, or (r - 6)^2 = 324 / A. Using the sphere substitution r^2 = 4356 / A, expand (r - 6)^2 = r^2 - 12r + 36 = 324 / A. Substitute r^2 to get 4356 / A - 12r + 36 = 324 / A, rearranged to -12r = (324 - 4356)/A - 36 = -4032 / A - 36. Solving for r gives r = 336 / A + 3. Squaring r and equating to r^2 from the sphere yields (336 / A + 3)^2 = 4356 / A. Expanding and clearing denominators leads to a quadratic in A: 3 A^2 - 780 A + 37632 = 0. Solving this quadratic gives two positive roots A = 64 and A = 196, corresponding to h^2 = A - 36, so h^2 = 28 and h^2 = 160. Thus, h1 = 2 sqrt(7) and h2 = 4 sqrt(10).

The torus cross-section circle has radius 3 and is centered at (6, h) in the (r, z) plane, where r = sqrt(x^2 + y^2). The valid range for the radius r on the torus cross-section is between 3 and 9 because the torus is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 centered at radius 6 from the axis, so the cross-section radius r must satisfy 3 ≤ r ≤ 9.\n\nFrom the previous derivation, we have r^2 = 4356 / (36 + h^2) and r = 336 / (36 + h^2) + 3.

The torus implicit equation is ((sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6)^2 + (z - h)^2 = 9). The fixed sphere S has radius 11 and is centered at the origin, so its equation is x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 121. For external tangency along a circle, the two surfaces must intersect in a circle and have matching tangent planes at every point on this circle. This means the intersection curve satisfies both surface equations simultaneously, and the gradients (normals) of the two surfaces at each point on the circle are parallel (∇F = λ ∇G for some scalar λ). By defining F and G as the implicit functions of the torus and sphere respectively, and computing their gradients, we find the conditions for tangency. The gradients lead to the relations λ = (r - 6)/r and (z - h) = λ z, where r = sqrt(x^2 + y^2). From these, we derive z = (h/6) r. Substituting into the sphere and torus equations yields two equations in r and h, which can be combined into a quadratic in A = 36 + h^2. This formulation fully encodes the external tangency conditions, including the requirement that the surfaces touch along a circle and their normals match at tangent points.

Let r = √(x^2 + y^2). The gradients matching condition gave us the relation z = (h/6) r. Substituting z = (h/6) r into the sphere equation gives r^2 + (h^2/36) r^2 = 121, or r^2 (1 + h^2/36) = 121. This simplifies to r^2 = 121 / (1 + h^2/36) = 121 * 36 / (36 + h^2). Define A = 36 + h^2, so r^2 = 4356 / A. Similarly, substitute z into the torus equation: (r - 6)^2 + ((h/6) r - h)^2 = 9. Expand the second term: ((h/6) r - h)^2 = h^2 (r/6 - 1)^2 = h^2 ( (r^2/36) - (r/3) + 1 ). So the torus equation becomes (r - 6)^2 + h^2 (r^2/36 - r/3 + 1) = 9. Expanding (r - 6)^2 = r^2 - 12r + 36, the equation is r^2 - 12r + 36 + h^2 (r^2/36 - r/3 + 1) = 9. Multiply through to combine terms: r^2 + (h^2/36) r^2 - 12r - (h^2/3) r + 36 + h^2 = 9. Group r^2 terms: r^2 (1 + h^2 / 36) - r (12 + h^2 / 3) + (36 + h^2 - 9) = 0. Recall A = 36 + h^2, so 1 + h^2 / 36 = A / 36. The equation becomes (A / 36) r^2 - r (12 + h^2 / 3) + (27 + h^2) = 0. We already have r^2 = 4356 / A from the sphere substitution. Substitute r^2 into this quadratic in r: (A / 36) * (4356 / A) - r (12 + h^2 / 3) + (27 + h^2) = 0. Simplify: 4356 / 36 - r (12 + h^2 / 3) + (27 + h^2) = 0. Note 4356 / 36 = 121. So 121 - r (12 + h^2 / 3) + (27 + h^2) = 0, or - r (12 + h^2 / 3) + (148 + h^2) = 0. Solve for r: r = (148 + h^2) / (12 + h^2 / 3) = (148 + h^2) / ((36 + h^2)/3) = 3 (148 + h^2) / (36 + h^2) = 3 (148 + h^2) / A. But from above, r^2 = 4356 / A. Square the expression for r: r^2 = [3 (148 + h^2) / A]^2 = 9 (148 + h^2)^2 / A^2. Equate this to 4356 / A: 9 (148 + h^2)^2 / A^2 = 4356 / A. Multiply both sides by A^2: 9 (148 + h^2)^2 = 4356 A. Divide both sides by 9: (148 + h^2)^2 = 484 A. Recall A = 36 + h^2. Substitute: (148 + h^2)^2 = 484 (36 + h^2). Expand left side: (h^2 + 148)^2 = h^4 + 2*148 h^2 + 148^2 = h^4 + 296 h^2 + 21,904. Expand right side: 484*36 + 484 h^2 = 17,424 + 484 h^2. Set equation: h^4 + 296 h^2 + 21,904 = 17,424 + 484 h^2. Rearrange: h^4 + 296 h^2 - 484 h^2 + 21,904 - 17,424 = 0, or h^4 - 188 h^2 + 4,480 = 0. Let X = h^2, then X^2 - 188 X + 4,480 = 0. Solve quadratic: Discriminant D = 188^2 - 4*4,480 = 35,344 - 17,920 = 17,424. sqrt(D) = 132 (since 132^2 = 17,424). Solutions: X = (188 ± 132)/2. So X1 = (188 + 132)/2 = 320/2 = 160, X2 = (188 - 132)/2 = 56/2 = 28. Thus h^2 = 160 or h^2 = 28. Both positive, so h = ±√160 = ±4√10 and h = ±√28 = ±2√7. Since the problem involves vertical shifts, take positive values h1 = 2√7 and h2 = 4√10 (the order can be chosen by magnitude). These two distinct real values correspond to the two vertical shifts positioning the torus tangent externally to the sphere.

After algebraic manipulation, the condition for tangency reduces to a quadratic equation in A: A^2 - 1584 A + 11664 = 0. Solving this quadratic yields two positive values of A, and hence two values of h = ±sqrt(A - 36). Both correspond to distinct vertical shifts h1 and h2, positioning the torus tangent externally to the sphere. Since the quadratic discriminant is positive, two real and geometrically feasible solutions exist. This confirms the existence of two distinct external tangent positions. This reasoning rigorously uses the substitution from the gradient condition, the sphere and torus equations, and the derived quadratic condition to find the two vertical shifts.

The external tangency condition implies the surfaces intersect along a circle where their gradients are parallel. Introducing r = sqrt(x^2 + y^2), the gradient condition gives z = (h/6) r. Substituting z into the sphere equation yields r^2 (1 + h^2/36) = 121, or r^2 = 4356 / (36 + h^2). Substituting z and r^2 into the torus equation leads to (r - 6)^2 + (z - h)^2 = 9. Replacing z by (h/6) r, the torus equation becomes (r - 6)^2 + h^2 (r/6 - 1)^2 = 9, which simplifies to (r - 6)^2 (1 + h^2/36) = 9. Defining A = 36 + h^2, this is (r - 6)^2 * (A/36) = 9, or (r - 6)^2 = 324 / A. Using the sphere substitution r^2 = 4356 / A, expand (r - 6)^2 = r^2 - 12r + 36 = 324 / A. Substitute r^2 to get 4356 / A - 12r + 36 = 324 / A, rearranged to -12r = (324 - 4356)/A - 36 = -4032 / A - 36. Solving for r gives r = 336 / A + 3. Squaring r and equating to r^2 from the sphere yields (336 / A + 3)^2 = 4356 / A. Expanding and clearing denominators leads to a quadratic in A: 3 A^2 - 780 A + 37632 = 0. Solving this quadratic gives two positive roots A = 64 and A = 196, corresponding to h^2 = A - 36, so h^2 = 28 and h^2 = 160. Thus, h1 = 2 sqrt(7) and h2 = 4 sqrt(10). Both values are positive and yield real, geometrically feasible vertical shifts positioning the torus tangent externally to the sphere.

For each h, the tangent circle on the torus corresponds to a radius r in the cross-section circle of the torus. The torus cross-section circle has radius 3 and is centered at (6, h) in the (r, z) plane, where r = sqrt(x^2 + y^2). The valid range for the radius r on the torus cross-section is between 3 and 9 because the torus is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 centered at radius 6 from the axis, so the cross-section radius r must satisfy 3 ≤ r ≤ 9.\n\nFrom the previous derivation, we have r^2 = 4356 / (36 + h^2) and r = 336 / (36 + h^2) + 3. We can check these values for h1 and h2:\n\nFor h1 = 2 sqrt(7), h1^2 = 28, so A = 36 + 28 = 64.\n- r^2 = 4356 / 64 = 68.0625\n- r = 336 / 64 + 3 = 5.25 + 3 = 8.25\n- Check r^2 = 8.25^2 = 68.0625, consistent.\n- Since 3 ≤ 8.25 ≤ 9, r is within the valid range.\n\nFor h2 = 4 sqrt(10), h2^2 = 160, so A = 36 + 160 = 196.\n- r^2 = 4356 / 196 = 22.2245\n- r = 336 / 196 + 3 ≈ 1.714 + 3 = 4.714\n- Check r^2 = 4.714^2 ≈ 22.2245, consistent.\n- Since 3 ≤ 4.714 ≤ 9, r is within the valid range.\n\nThus, for both h1 and h2, the corresponding tangent circles lie within the valid range of the torus cross-section radii (3 to 9). This confirms the geometric feasibility of both solutions and excludes any spurious or physically impossible tangent circles. The step-by-step substitution and verification ensure no errors in the range check, and the consistency of r and r^2 values confirms the correctness of the calculations.; answer: Both solutions h1 = 2 sqrt(7) and h2 = 4 sqrt(10) yield tangent circles with radii r = 8.25 and r = 4.714 respectively, both within the valid range [3, 9] of the torus cross-section.

The torus surface points satisfy (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6)^2 + z^2 = 3^2 = 9. For each vertical shift h_k (k=1,2), we want to find the radius r_k of the circle of tangency on the torus surface in the xy-plane. The vertical shifts given are h1 = 2 sqrt(7) and h2 = 4 sqrt(10). From the previous step, we know the corresponding radii in the cross-section are r1 = 8.25 and r2 = 4.714, which lie within the valid cross-section radius range [3,9]. To find the radius r_k of the tangent circle on the torus surface in the xy-plane, we substitute h_k back into the torus parametrization. The torus parametrization in the xy-plane radius is r = sqrt(x^2 + y^2). Given the cross-section circle center at (6, h_k) and radius 3, the distance from the axis is r_k = 6 + s_k, where s_k is the horizontal offset from 6. Since the cross-section radius is 3, the possible r values range from 6-3=3 to 6+3=9. Using the formulas derived, r_k = 336 / (36 + h_k^2) + 3. For h1 = 2 sqrt(7), h1^2 = 28, so r1 = 336 / (36 + 28) + 3 = 336 / 64 + 3 = 5.25 + 3 = 8.25. For h2 = 4 sqrt(10), h2^2 = 160, so r2 = 336 / (36 + 160) + 3 = 336 / 196 + 3 ≈ 1.714 + 3 = 4.714. These radii correspond to the radii of the tangent circles on the torus surface in the xy-plane, ensuring accurate determination of r_i and r_o based on the correct tangency positions. This step is crucial because it links the vertical shift h_k, which determines the height of tangency, to the radius r_k of the tangent circle on the torus in the xy-plane, thus fully characterizing the circle of tangency between the torus and the sphere.; answer: {'r_1': 8.25, 'r_2': 4.714}\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent pGnn, computing tangent circle radii, thinking: The torus is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 centered at (6, 0) in the (r, z) plane, where r = sqrt(x^2 + y^2). The vertical shifts h_k = h_1 = 2 sqrt(7) and h_2 = 4 sqrt(10) correspond to the vertical displacement of the center of the cross-section circle of the torus from the xy-plane. For each h_k, the radius r_k of the tangent circle on the torus surface in the xy-plane is given by the distance from the z-axis to the point on the torus where it is tangent to the sphere. This radius r_k can be found by substituting h_k back into the torus parametrization and using the relation r = 3 + 336/(36 + h_k^2), which was derived from the conditions of tangency and the geometry of the torus and sphere. For h_1 = 2 sqrt(7), h_1^2 = 28, so r_1 = 3 + 336/(36 + 28) = 3 + 336/64 = 3 + 5.25 = 8.25. For h_2 = 4 sqrt(10), h_2^2 = 160, so r_2 = 3 + 336/(36 + 160) = 3 + 336/196 = 3 + 1.7142857 = 4.7142857. These values correspond to the radii of the tangent circles on the torus surface in the xy-plane for the two vertical shifts. This step is crucial because it ensures that the tangency points are correctly located on the torus surface and that the radii r_i and r_o are accurately determined based on the exact geometry of the problem. The values r_1 = 8.25 and r_2 ≈ 4.714 are consistent with the torus geometry (between 3 and 9) and confirm the correctness of the tangency positions.; answer: {'r_1': 8.25, 'r_2': 4.7142857}\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent Ibya, computing tangent circle radii, thinking: The torus T is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 centered at (6, 0) in the (r, z) plane, where r = sqrt(x^2 + y^2). The vertical shifts h1 = 2 sqrt(7) and h2 = 4 sqrt(10) represent the vertical displacement of the center of the circle cross-section of the torus when it is tangent externally to the sphere S. To find the radius r_k of the tangent circle on the torus surface in the xy-plane for each h_k, we substitute h_k back into the parametric form of the torus. The torus parametrization in the (r, z) plane for the cross-section circle is given by the circle equation: (r - 6)^2 + z^2 = 9. For each h_k, the corresponding radius r_k satisfies (r_k - 6)^2 + h_k^2 = 9. Solving for r_k, we have r_k = 6 ± sqrt(9 - h_k^2). Since the torus cross-section radius must be between 3 and 9, and given the values of h_k, we take the appropriate root that yields r_k in this range. For h1 = 2 sqrt(7), h1^2 = 28, so r1 = 6 ± sqrt(9 - 28) is not real. This suggests a need to revisit the equation or use the previously derived formulas for r in terms of h. From previous derivations, r_k can be computed as r_k = 336 / (36 + h_k^2) + 3. Substituting h1^2 = 28, we get r1 = 336 / (36 + 28) + 3 = 336 / 64 + 3 = 5.25 + 3 = 8.25. Similarly, for h2 = 4 sqrt(10), h2^2 = 160, r2 = 336 / (36 + 160) + 3 = 336 / 196 + 3 ≈ 1.714 + 3 = 4.714. These values match the previously verified valid radii within [3, 9]. Thus, the tangent circles on the torus surface in the xy-plane have radii r1 = 8.25 and r2 = 4.714 for h1 and h2 respectively. This ensures accurate determination of r_i and r_o based on the correct tangency positions.

The torus surface satisfies (r - 6)^2 + z^2 = 9. The sphere S has radius 11. When the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, the tangency occurs along a circle on the torus surface. The vertical shifts h1 = 2 sqrt(7) and h2 = 4 sqrt(10) correspond to two possible positions of the torus relative to the sphere where tangency occurs. For each h_k, the radius r_k of the tangent circle on the torus surface in the xy-plane is found by substituting h_k into the torus parametrization. From previous derivations, the radius r_k is given by r_k = 336 / (36 + h_k^2) + 3. Substituting h1^2 = 28, we get r1 = 336 / 64 + 3 = 5.25 + 3 = 8.25. Substituting h2^2 = 160, we get r2 = 336 / 196 + 3 ≈ 1.714 + 3 = 4.714. Both values lie within the valid range [3, 9] for the torus cross-section radius, confirming geometric feasibility. Since the problem states that r_i and r_o are the radii of the tangent circles when the torus rests on the outside of the sphere in two different ways, and given that r1 > r2, it is natural to assign r_i = 8.25 and r_o = 4.714.

To express these decimals as fractions, note that 8.25 = 33/4 and 4.714 = 33/7. Since 4.714 was approximated, let's verify its exact fraction from the provided formula: r_k = 336 / (36 + h_k^2) + 3. For h2^2 = 160, denominator = 196, so 336/196 = 12/7, hence r_o = 12/7 + 3 = 12/7 + 21/7 = 33/7. Therefore, r_o = 33/7 exactly. Similarly, r_i = 33/4 exactly.

First, express these decimal values as fractions. 8.25 = 33/4 because 8.25 = 8 + 0.25 = 8 + 1/4 = 33/4. For 4.714, which is 4 + 0.714, note that 0.714 is approximately 5/7 (since 5/7 ≈ 0.7142857). From the previous steps, r_o was given as 336/196 + 3 = (336/196) + 3. Simplify 336/196: 336/196 = (336 ÷ 28)/(196 ÷ 28) = 12/7 = 1.714. Adding 3 gives 1.714 + 3 = 4.714 = 4 + 5/7 = 33/7.
