Question: Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_0_6
proposed answer: From Sub-task 1, we have the reduced fraction for r^2 as 657/64, where p = 657 and q = 64. Both 657 and 64 are positive integers and relatively prime, as 657 factors into 3^2 * 73 and 64 is 2^6, sharing no common factors. The problem asks for the sum p + q. Therefore, we simply add 657 and 64 to get 721. This sum represents the final answer for Sub-task 2.
