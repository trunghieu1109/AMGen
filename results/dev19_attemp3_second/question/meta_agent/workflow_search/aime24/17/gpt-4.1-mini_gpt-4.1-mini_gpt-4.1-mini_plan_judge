Question: Find the number of triples of nonnegative integers \((a,b,c)\) satisfying \(a + b + c = 300\) and
\begin{equation*}
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.
\end{equation*}

proposed answer: We are asked to aggregate and count the total number of valid triples (a,b,c) of nonnegative integers satisfying the two constraints: a + b + c = 300 and a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000. From Sub-task 3, the problem was simplified and analyzed thoroughly. The key steps are: 1. The polynomial expression was rewritten as (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000. Since a + b + c = 300, this becomes 300 * S2 - 3 * S3 = 6,000,000, where S2 = ab + bc + ca and S3 = abc. Dividing by 3 gives 100 * S2 - S3 = 2,000,000. 2. Case 1: One variable is zero, say c=0. Then a + b = 300 and the polynomial reduces to 300 * ab = 6,000,000, so ab = 20,000. Solving a(300 - a) = 20,000 gives roots a=100 and a=200, so the pairs (100,200) and (200,100) satisfy the condition. With c=0, the triples are (100,200,0) and (200,100,0). By symmetry, the zero can be in any of the three positions, and the other two numbers can be swapped, giving 6 permutations: (100,200,0), (200,100,0), (100,0,200), (200,0,100), (0,100,200), (0,200,100). 3. Case 2: All three variables equal, a = b = c = 100. Then S2 = 3*100*100 = 30,000 and S3 = 100*100*100 = 1,000,000. Substituting gives 100*30,000 - 1,000,000 = 2,000,000, satisfying the condition. So (100,100,100) is a solution. 4. Case 3: Two variables equal and the third different was checked but yielded no integer solutions within the constraints. 5. Since the problem and polynomial are symmetric in a,b,c, and the found solutions satisfy the equation exactly, these are all solutions. 6. Counting the solutions: - One unique triple (100,100,100) - Six permutations of (100,200,0) as explained above. Total number of valid triples = 1 + 6 = 7. Therefore, the total number of valid triples (a,b,c) satisfying both constraints, considering ordering as distinct triples, is 7.

proposed answer: From the verified solution set in subtask 6, we have exactly seven valid triples (a,b,c) of nonnegative integers summing to 300 that satisfy the polynomial constraint: six triples where one variable is zero and the other two are 100 and 200 in some order, and one triple where all three variables are equal to 100. These are: (200, 100, 0), (100, 200, 0), (0, 200, 100), (0, 100, 200), (200, 0, 100), (100, 0, 200), and (100, 100, 100). Each triple is distinct considering ordering as distinct triples, and no duplicates exist in this list. The aggregation is straightforward as these are all the solutions found and verified through algebraic and computational methods. Counting these solutions yields a total of 7 valid triples. This count aligns perfectly with the verified solution set from subtask 6, confirming completeness and correctness of the enumeration and verification process.
