Question: Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations:
\[\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}\]\[\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}\]\[\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}\]
Then the value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: The problem involves finding the value of |log2(x^4 y^3 z^2)| given the system of logarithmic equations. From previous sub-tasks, the values of a = log2(x), b = log2(y), and c = log2(z) were found as a = -7/24, b = -3/8, and c = -5/12 respectively. The expression to evaluate is 4a + 3b + 2c. Converting all fractions to a common denominator of 24, we get b = -9/24 and c = -10/24. Calculating each term: 4a = 4*(-7/24) = -28/24, 3b = 3*(-9/24) = -27/24, and 2c = 2*(-10/24) = -20/24. Summing these yields (-28 - 27 - 20)/24 = -75/24, which simplifies to -25/8 after dividing numerator and denominator by 3. Taking the absolute value gives 25/8. Since 25 and 8 are relatively prime, the fraction is in simplest form with m = 25 and n = 8. The problem asks for m + n, which is 25 + 8 = 33. Multiple independent agents have confirmed this calculation, ensuring its correctness and consistency. Therefore, the final answer is 33.
