Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Final Decision Agent NAbm', content='The problem involves finding the value of |log2(x^4 y^3 z^2)| given the system of logarithmic equations. From previous sub-tasks, the values of a = log2(x), b = log2(y), and c = log2(z) were found as a = -7/24, b = -3/8, and c = -5/12 respectively. The expression to evaluate is 4a + 3b + 2c. Converting all fractions to a common denominator of 24, we get b = -9/24 and c = -10/24. Calculating each term: 4a = 4*(-7/24) = -28/24, 3b = 3*(-9/24) = -27/24, and 2c = 2*(-10/24) = -20/24. Summing these yields (-28 - 27 - 20)/24 = -75/24, which simplifies to -25/8 after dividing numerator and denominator by 3. Taking the absolute value gives 25/8. Since 25 and 8 are relatively prime, the fraction is in simplest form with m = 25 and n = 8. The problem asks for m + n, which is 25 + 8 = 33. Multiple independent agents have confirmed this calculation, ensuring its correctness and consistency.

The expression is 4a + 3b + 2c. To add these fractions, we first convert all to a common denominator, which is 24. We rewrite b = -3/8 as -9/24 and c = -5/12 as -10/24. Then, 4a = 4*(-7/24) = -28/24, 3b = 3*(-9/24) = -27/24, and 2c = 2*(-10/24) = -20/24. Summing these gives (-28 - 27 - 20)/24 = -75/24. Simplifying by dividing numerator and denominator by 3 yields -25/8. Taking the absolute value results in 25/8. Since 25 and 8 are relatively prime, m = 25 and n = 8, so m + n = 33.

The system derived from the logarithmic equations is: a - b - c = 1/2, b - a - c = 1/3, c - a - b = 1/4. Rearranging the second and third equations to have coefficients aligned with variables a, b, c, we get: -a + b - c = 1/3 and -a - b + c = 1/4. This leads to the coefficient matrix A = [[1, -1, -1], [-1, 1, -1], [-1, -1, 1]] and vector d = [1/2, 1/3, 1/4]. This matrix form is standard, compact, and facilitates solving the system using linear algebra techniques such as matrix inversion or Gaussian elimination.
