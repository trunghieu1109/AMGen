Question: Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.

proposed answer: We have established that the losing positions for Alice (and thus winning positions for Bob) are those positive integers n ≤ 2024 for which n mod 5 = 0 or n mod 5 = 2. To find the count of such integers, we consider the integers from 1 to 2024 and count how many satisfy these modular conditions. The integers modulo 5 cycle every 5 numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 0, then repeat. For every block of 5 consecutive integers, exactly two integers satisfy the condition (those congruent to 0 or 2 mod 5). The number of complete blocks of 5 in 2024 is floor(2024/5) = 404. Each block contributes 2 such integers, so 404 * 2 = 808 integers. Now, consider the remainder: 2024 mod 5 = 4, so the last partial block is numbers 2020+1=2021 to 2024. The residues of these numbers mod 5 are: 2021 mod 5 = 1, 2022 mod 5 = 2, 2023 mod 5 = 3, 2024 mod 5 = 4. Among these, only 2022 (mod 5 = 2) satisfies the condition. So we add 1 more to the count, making the total 808 + 1 = 809. Therefore, there are 809 positive integers n ≤ 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy. This count is consistent with the modular pattern and the problem's conditions, confirming its correctness.
