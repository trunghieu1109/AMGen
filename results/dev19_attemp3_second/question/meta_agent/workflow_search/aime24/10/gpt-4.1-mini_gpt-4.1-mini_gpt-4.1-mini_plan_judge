Question: Rectangles $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are drawn such that $D,E,C,F$ are collinear. Also, $A,D,H,G$ all lie on a circle. If $BC=16$,$AB=107$,$FG=17$, and $EF=184$, what is the length of $CE$?

proposed answer: We start by placing rectangle ABCD on the coordinate plane with A at (0,0), B at (107,0), C at (107,16), and D at (0,16), consistent with AB=107 and BC=16. Since points D, E, C, F are collinear and D and C lie on y=16, E and F must also lie on y=16. Let E = (x,16) and F = (x+184,16) because EF=184. Rectangle EFGH has sides EF=184 and FG=17, so G = (x+184,33) and H = (x,33). The points A(0,0), D(0,16), H(x,33), and G(x+184,33) lie on the same circle. The center of this circle lies at the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of chords AD and HG. The midpoint of AD is (0,8), and since AD is vertical, its perpendicular bisector is horizontal at y=8. The midpoint of HG is (x+92,33), and since HG is horizontal, its perpendicular bisector is vertical at x+92. Thus, the center is at (x+92,8). The radius squared from the center to A is (x+92)^2 + 8^2 = (x+92)^2 + 64. The radius squared from the center to H is (-92)^2 + 25^2 = 8464 + 625 = 9089. Equating these gives (x+92)^2 + 64 = 9089, so (x+92)^2 = 9025. Taking square roots, x+92 = Â±95, so x = 3 or x = -187. The value x=3 is valid as it places E and F near ABCD, consistent with the rectangles' relative positions and collinearity. With x=3, E is at (3,16) and C is at (107,16). The length CE is the horizontal distance between these points, |107 - 3| = 104. Therefore, the length of segment CE is 104.
