Question: Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.

proposed answer: From the previous sub-task, we determined that the length AP can be expressed as a simplified fraction m/n where m and n are coprime integers. The calculation involved finding the parameter t_p corresponding to point P on line AD intersecting the circle again, which was found to be 36/7. The direction vector length of line AD was simplified to 7/12. Multiplying these gives AP = (36/7) * (7/12) = 3. Expressing 3 as a fraction gives 3/1, where m=3 and n=1. Since 3 and 1 are coprime, the fraction is in lowest terms. Therefore, m + n = 3 + 1 = 4.

proposed answer: From the previous sub-task, the length AP was derived through a detailed geometric and algebraic process involving the parameterization of line AD and its intersection with the circumcircle Ï‰. The key steps included: 1) Expressing the coordinates of points A, B, C, and D, 2) Parameterizing the line AD and substituting into the circle equation to find the second intersection point P, 3) Solving the resulting quadratic equation to find the parameter t corresponding to P, 4) Calculating the length AP as the product of |t| and the magnitude of the direction vector AD, 5) Simplifying the resulting expression symbolically to obtain a fraction in lowest terms. The final simplified fraction for AP was found to be 36/7, where 36 and 7 share no common factors other than 1, confirming it is in lowest terms. Therefore, the sum m + n, where AP = m/n, is 36 + 7 = 43. This result is consistent with the numeric approximations and the geometric constraints of the problem, confirming its correctness.
