Question: Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: Jen chooses 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1, 2, ..., 10}. The total number of 4-element subsets of S is C(10,4) = 210. She wins a prize if at least two of her chosen numbers are among the 4 randomly chosen numbers, and she wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers are the randomly chosen numbers. We want the conditional probability that she wins the grand prize given that she wins a prize. 

Step 1: Calculate the number of subsets that intersect Jen's chosen subset J in exactly k elements.
- Exactly 2 elements: C(4,2)*C(6,2) = 6*15 = 90
- Exactly 3 elements: C(4,3)*C(6,1) = 4*6 = 24
- Exactly 4 elements: C(4,4)*C(6,0) = 1*1 = 1

Step 2: Number of subsets intersecting J in at least 2 elements = 90 + 24 + 1 = 115.

Step 3: Probability of winning the grand prize given winning a prize = P(intersection=4) / P(intersection >= 2) = 1 / 115.

Thus, the fraction m/n = 1/115, and the sum m + n = 1 + 115 = 116. This is the most consistent and correct final answer based on the combinatorial calculations and the problem conditions.
