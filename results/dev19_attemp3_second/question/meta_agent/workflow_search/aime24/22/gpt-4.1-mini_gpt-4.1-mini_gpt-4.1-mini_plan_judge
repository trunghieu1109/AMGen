Question: A list of positive integers has the following properties:
$\bullet$ The sum of the items in the list is $30$.
$\bullet$ The unique mode of the list is $9$.
$\bullet$ The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.
Find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

proposed answer: From Sub-task 3, the valid list that satisfies all the conditions is [5, 7, 9, 9]. The conditions are: the sum of the list is 30, the unique mode is 9, and the median is a positive integer not in the list. The median of this list is (7 + 9)/2 = 8, which is not in the list, fulfilling the median condition. The mode is 9, appearing twice, which is more than any other number, making it the unique mode. The sum is 5 + 7 + 9 + 9 = 30, satisfying the sum condition. To find the sum of the squares of all items, we calculate 5^2 + 7^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 = 25 + 49 + 81 + 81 = 236. Therefore, the sum of the squares of all items in the valid list is 236.
