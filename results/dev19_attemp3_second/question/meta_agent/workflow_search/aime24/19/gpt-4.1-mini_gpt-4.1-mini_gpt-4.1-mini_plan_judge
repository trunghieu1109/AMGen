is divided by 1000.

proposed answer: The problem requires finding the remainder when the product \( \prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) \) is divided by 1000, where \( \omega \) is a primitive 13th root of unity (\( \omega^{13} = 1 \), \( \omega \neq 1 \)). First, rewrite the factor inside the product as a polynomial in \( x \): \( f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2 \). The roots of \( f(x) \) are \( 1 + i \) and \( 1 - i \), which are not 13th roots of unity, so none of the terms in the product vanish. The product over all 13th roots of unity of \( f(\omega^k) \) equals the resultant \( \mathrm{Res}(f,g) \), where \( g(x) = x^{13} - 1 \). The resultant is the product of \( g(\beta) \) over the roots \( \beta \) of \( f \). Evaluating \( g(x) = x^{13} - 1 \) at \( 1+i \) and \( 1 - i \) requires complex exponentiation. Express \( 1+i = \sqrt{2} e^{i\pi/4} \). Then \( (1+i)^{13} = 2^{6.5} e^{i 13\pi/4} \). Since \( 13\pi/4 = 3\pi + \pi/4 \) and \( e^{i3\pi} = -1 \), we get \( (1+i)^{13} = -64(1+i) \). Similarly, \( (1 - i)^{13} = -64(1 - i) \). Subtracting 1, \( g(1+i) = -65 - 64i \) and \( g(1 - i) = -65 + 64i \). Multiplying these conjugates yields \( (-65)^2 + 64^2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321 \). Therefore, the product equals 8321. The remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000 is \( 8321 \mod 1000 = 321 \). This step-by-step reasoning uses polynomial root properties, the concept of resultants, complex number exponentiation in polar form, and modular arithmetic to find the final remainder.
