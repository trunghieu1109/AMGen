proposed answer: The problem is to find the number of lattice paths from the lower-left corner to the upper-right corner of an 8x8 grid that have exactly four direction changes. Each path consists of 16 steps: 8 horizontal and 8 vertical. A direction change occurs when the path switches from moving horizontally to vertically or vice versa. Having exactly four direction changes means the path is divided into 5 segments alternating between horizontal and vertical moves. There are two possible patterns for these segments: Pattern 1 (H-V-H-V-H) and Pattern 2 (V-H-V-H-V).

From Sub-task 2.2, we know the valid segment length distributions for each pattern. For Pattern 1, the horizontal segments h1, h2, h3 sum to 8, and the vertical segments v1, v2 sum to 8, with all segments positive integers. The number of positive integer solutions for h1+h2+h3=8 is C(7,2)=21, and for v1+v2=8 is C(7,1)=7. Thus, the total number of valid 5-tuples for Pattern 1 is 21*7=147.

Similarly, for Pattern 2, the vertical segments v1, v2, v3 sum to 8, and the horizontal segments h1, h2 sum to 8, with all positive integers. The count is the same: 147 valid 5-tuples.

Each valid 5-tuple corresponds to exactly one unique path with exactly four direction changes because the order of segments and their directions is fixed, and within each segment, the steps are all in the same direction and indistinguishable. Therefore, the total number of such paths is the sum of valid 5-tuples for both patterns: 147 + 147 = 294.

Hence, the final total count of paths with exactly four direction changes is 294.
