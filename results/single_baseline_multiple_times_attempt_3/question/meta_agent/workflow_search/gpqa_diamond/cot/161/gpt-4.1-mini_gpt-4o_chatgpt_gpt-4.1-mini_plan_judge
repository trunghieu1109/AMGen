proposed answer: The given metric is ds^{2}=\frac{32}{\left(4-x^{2}-y^{2}\right)}\left(dx^{2}+dy^{2}\right). This is a metric for a surface with constant negative curvature, resembling a pseudosphere. The metric is singular at the boundary where 4-x^{2}-y^{2}=0, which is a circle of radius 2. The area of a pseudosphere is related to its Gaussian curvature and the boundary condition. As the radius approaches the boundary, the area of the pseudosphere becomes infinite because the metric becomes singular. Therefore, the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2 is +\infty.
