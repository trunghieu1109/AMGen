Question: Example(question='Consider a system of three spins S1, S2 and S3. Each of which can take spin +1 and -1. The energy of the system is given by, E= -J[ S1S2 +S1S3+S2S3 ].\nFind the partition function Z of the system. (\\beta = 1/kT , k= boltzmann constant and T= temperature)', choice1='Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)', choice2='Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)', choice3='Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)', choice4='Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: We enumerate all 2^3=8 spin configurations. The energy is E=−J(S1S2+S1S3+S2S3). If all three spins are aligned (all +1 or all −1), each pair contributes +1, so the sum is 3 and E=−3J, giving two states with e^(−βE)=e^(3Jβ). In configurations with two spins up and one down (or two down, one up), there are 6 such states; each has two aligned pairs (+1) and one antialigned pair (−1), summing to −1, so E=+J and e^(−βE)=e^(−Jβ). Thus Z=2e^(3Jβ)+6e^(−Jβ), matching choice A).
