Question: Example(question='While designing a high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating at an accelerating voltage of 1000 kV, Mike connected vacuum pumps to create an ultra-high vacuum state (< 10^-9 Torr) in the sample compartment, aiming to minimize the presence of gas molecules for improved electron microscopy. However, as expected, some gas particles remained inside the compartment, as detected by the mass spectrometer. Mike accurately determined the mean free path of these gas molecules in the vacuum state (< 10^-9 Torr) to be λ1, based on factors such as sample compartment volume, pressure, and temperature. However, upon initiating the electron beam, he made an intriguing observation concerning the mean free path based on electron scattering with the gas molecules. He found that the mean free path was no longer equal to λ1; rather, it was λ2, even though the sample compartment temperature remained the same.\n\nWhat can we conclude about λ2 based on the aforementioned scenario?', choice1="λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation", choice2='λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1', choice3='λ2 < λ1', choice4='λ2 >= 1.22*λ1', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The mean free path λ1 is determined based on the conditions of the gas molecules in the vacuum, considering their interactions with each other. However, when an electron beam is introduced, the mean free path λ2 is related to the scattering of electrons by the gas molecules. The electrons typically have a much longer mean free path due to their small size and high energy compared to the gas molecules. Therefore, λ2 is expected to be longer than λ1, as electrons will scatter less frequently than gas molecules. This means λ2 > λ1.
