Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent fBw6', content="The reaction of an alkene with mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid) forms an epoxide. For (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene, epoxidation will give different stereoisomers of the epoxide due to the different starting alkene geometries. Specifically, (E)-alkene epoxidation gives one pair of enantiomers (because the epoxide can be formed on either face, producing enantiomers), and (Z)-alkene epoxidation gives a different pair of enantiomers. Since the starting alkenes are stereoisomers, their epoxides are diastereomers to each other. Therefore, the product mixture contains two diastereomers, each existing as a pair of enantiomers. \n\nOn a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column, enantiomers co-elute (they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment), but diastereomers separate. Thus, we expect 2 peaks corresponding to the 2 diastereomers.\n\nOn a chiral HPLC column, enantiomers are separated. So each diastereomer's enantiomers will be resolved, resulting in 4 peaks total (2 diastereomers Ã— 2 enantiomers each).\n\nHence, the chemist observes 2 peaks on the standard HPLC and 4 peaks on the chiral HPLC.\n\nAnswer:B)", prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
