Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The reactions described involve epoxidation of alkenes followed by acid-catalyzed ring opening. Reaction 1 with (E)-oct-4-ene and Reaction 2 with (Z)-oct-4-ene both lead to the formation of diols. For Reaction 1, the epoxide formed from (E)-oct-4-ene is meso, leading to a single diol product upon hydrolysis. For Reaction 2, the epoxide formed from (Z)-oct-4-ene is chiral, leading to a pair of enantiomeric diols upon hydrolysis. In total, the mixture contains three distinct diols: one meso diol and one pair of enantiomeric diols. On a standard HPLC column, which does not separate enantiomers, the meso diol and the racemic pair of enantiomers will appear as two peaks. On a chiral HPLC column, the enantiomeric pair will be separated, resulting in three peaks: one for the meso diol and two for the enantiomers. Therefore, the chemist will observe 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC.

proposed answer: In Reaction 1, (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with mCPBA, forming an epoxide, and then acid is added to open the epoxide to form a diol. The (E)-alkene will lead to a trans-epoxide, which upon acid-catalyzed opening, gives a trans-diol. In Reaction 2, (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated similarly, leading to a cis-epoxide and then a cis-diol. The products from both reactions are diastereomers: one is a trans-diol and the other is a cis-diol. On a standard HPLC, which doesn't separate enantiomers, only diastereomers, we expect to see two peaks corresponding to the two different diastereomers. However, on a chiral HPLC, which can separate enantiomers, we expect to see four peaks, as each diastereomer is composed of a pair of enantiomers. Therefore, the chemist will observe 2 peaks on the standard HPLC and 4 peaks on the chiral HPLC.
