Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent fBw6', content='The epoxidation of (E)-oct-4-ene (trans alkene) gives the trans epoxide, which is chiral and formed as a racemic pair. Acid‚Äêcatalyzed opening of this epoxide gives a racemic anti diol (two enantiomers). The epoxidation of (Z)-oct-4-ene (cis alkene) gives the cis epoxide, which is achiral (meso). Opening yields the meso diol (one achiral product). Mixing the two reactions thus gives three stereoisomers: one meso, plus two enantiomers. On an achiral HPLC column enantiomers coelute (same retention), so you see two peaks (meso + racemate). On a chiral column the enantiomers separate, giving three peaks.\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
