    <pre>The reaction of an alkene with mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid) forms an epoxide. For (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene, epoxidation will give different stereoisomers of the epoxide due to the different starting alkene geometries. Specifically, (E)-alkene epoxidation gives one pair of enantiomers (because the epoxide can be formed on either face, producing enantiomers), and (Z)-alkene epoxidation gives a different pair of enantiomers. Since the starting alkenes are stereoisomers, their epoxides are diastereomers to each other. Therefore, the product mixture contains two diastereomers, each existing as a pair of enantiomers. 

On a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column, enantiomers co-elute (they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment), but diastereomers separate. Thus, we expect 2 peaks corresponding to the 2 diastereomers.

On a chiral HPLC column, enantiomers are separated. So each diastereomer&#39;s enantiomers will be resolved, resulting in 4 peaks total (2 diastereomers Ã— 2 enantiomers each).

Hence, the chemist observes 2 peaks on the standard HPLC and 4 peaks on the chiral HPLC.
