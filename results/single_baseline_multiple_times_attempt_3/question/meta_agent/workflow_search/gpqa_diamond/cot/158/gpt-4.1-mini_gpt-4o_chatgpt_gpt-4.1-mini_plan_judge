Question: Example(question='Observations of a quasar across the electromagnetic spectrum are being carried out. Focusing on the near infrared and optical spectrum, there is a peak at wavelength of about 790 nm, and at shorter wavelengths < 790 nm the flux drops significantly.\n\nIf we lived in a universe defined by Lambda-CDM model such that the current Hubble constant is 70 km s^-1 Mpc^-1, matter density parameter is 0.3, dark energy density parameter is 0.7, and universe is flat,\nwhat can be assumed about the value of the comoving distance (for scale factor a=1) of this quasar from the Earth?', choice1='8 Gpc', choice2='9 Gpc', choice3='7 Gpc', choice4='6 Gpc', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The observed peak wavelength of 790 nm suggests a redshifted emission line, likely from hydrogen's Lyman-alpha line, which is originally at 121.6 nm. The redshift z can be estimated as z = (790 - 121.6) / 121.6. Using the Lambda-CDM model with H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc, Omega_m = 0.3, Omega_lambda = 0.7, and a flat universe, we can calculate the comoving distance using cosmological calculators or analytical approximations. For a typical quasar with such redshift, the comoving distance is around 8 Gpc.
