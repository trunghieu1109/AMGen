proposed answer: We need to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. The target molecule has a tert-butyl group at position 2, an ethoxy group at position 1, and a nitro group at position 3. 

Step 1: Introduce the tert-butyl group via Friedel-Crafts alkylation using tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3. This directs further substitution to the ortho and para positions relative to the tert-butyl group, which is an ortho/para director.

Step 2: Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4) to introduce the nitro group, which is meta-directing relative to the tert-butyl group, so nitration occurs at position 3.

Step 3: Introduce the ethoxy group. Since direct ethoxylation is not straightforward, a common approach is to first introduce a hydroxyl group (via sulfonation and then hydrolysis), then convert to ethoxy via Williamson ether synthesis (NaOH/EtBr).

Looking at the choices:
Choice 1: tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 -> HNO3/H2SO4 -> Fe/HCl (reduction) -> HNO3/H2SO4 -> NaNO2/HCl -> H3O+, H2O/Heat -> NaOH/EtBr -> SO3/H2SO4 -> dilute H2SO4

This sequence seems convoluted and includes multiple nitrations and reductions.

Choice 2: tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 -> HNO3/H2SO4 -> SO3/H2SO4 -> NaNO2/HCl -> dilute H2SO4 -> H3O+, H2O/Heat -> NaOH/EtBr -> Fe/HCl -> HNO3/H2SO4

Again, multiple nitrations and sulfonations and reductions, possibly not the most straightforward.

Choice 3: tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 -> SO3/H2SO4 -> HNO3/H2SO4 -> Fe/HCl -> NaNO2/HCl -> HNO3/H2SO4 -> H3O+, H2O/Heat -> dilute H2SO4 -> NaOH/EtBr

This sequence includes sulfonation after tert-butylation, then nitration, reduction, diazotization, nitration again, hydrolysis and then ether formation. This is complex but seems to follow the logical steps of introducing groups and converting OH to OEt.

Choice 4: HNO3/H2SO4 -> Fe/HCl -> tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 -> HNO3/H2SO4 -> NaNO2/HCl -> SO3/H2SO4 -> dilute H2SO4 -> H3O+, H2O/Heat -> NaOH/EtBr

This starts with nitration before tert-butylation, which is not ideal because nitro groups are deactivating and meta-directing, making Friedel-Crafts alkylation difficult.

Therefore, the best sequence is Choice 3, which starts with tert-butylation, then sulfonation, nitration, reduction, diazotization, nitration, hydrolysis, and finally ether formation, leading to the desired product.
