Question: Example(question='There has been an outbreak of an viral infectious disease in your city. You have been asked to design a molecular diagnostic kit for quick detection of this retrovirus. How would you go about designing this kit?', choice1='First you identify the virus by performing DNA sequencing. You then develop a PCR kit for  quick and accurate diagnosis', choice2='First you identify the IgG antibodies for the infection. You then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG antibodies for quick \n and accurate diagnosis.', choice3='First you identify the virus using the information about the symptoms, provided by the affected patients. You then design a nested PCR kit based on the information for quick diagnosis.', choice4='First you identify the virus by performing cDNA sequencing.  You then develop a real time PCR kit for quick and accurate diagnosis.', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The virus is a retrovirus, which means its genetic material is RNA, not DNA. Therefore, DNA sequencing (choice 1) is not the best first step. Instead, the viral RNA should be converted to complementary DNA (cDNA) first. Hence, cDNA sequencing (choice 4) is more appropriate. Identifying IgG antibodies (choice 2) can be useful but is indirect and may not be as quick or accurate in early infection. Using symptoms alone to design a nested PCR (choice 3) is not precise. Real-time PCR after cDNA sequencing (choice 4) allows for quick and accurate detection of retroviral RNA.
