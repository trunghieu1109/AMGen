Question: {'question': 'There has been an outbreak of an viral infectious disease in your city. You have been asked to design a molecular diagnostic kit for quick detection of this retrovirus. How would you go about designing this kit?', 'choice1': 'First you identify the virus by performing DNA sequencing. You then develop a PCR kit for  quick and accurate diagnosis', 'choice2': 'First you identify the IgG antibodies for the infection. You then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG antibodies for quick \n and accurate diagnosis.', 'choice3': 'First you identify the virus using the information about the symptoms, provided by the affected patients. You then design a nested PCR kit based on the information for quick diagnosis.', 'choice4': 'First you identify the virus by performing cDNA sequencing.  You then develop a real time PCR kit for quick and accurate diagnosis.'}\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent dzzT', content="To design a molecular diagnostic kit for a retrovirus, we need to identify the virus's genetic material. Retroviruses have RNA genomes, which are reverse transcribed into DNA in the host. Therefore, the appropriate step would be to perform cDNA sequencing to identify the viral genetic material. Once the viral sequence is known, a real-time PCR kit can be developed for quick and accurate diagnosis by targeting specific viral sequences.\n\nAnswer:D)", prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
