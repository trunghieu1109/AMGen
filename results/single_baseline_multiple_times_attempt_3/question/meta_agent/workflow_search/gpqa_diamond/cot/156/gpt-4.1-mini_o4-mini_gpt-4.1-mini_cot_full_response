Question: {'question': 'There has been an outbreak of an viral infectious disease in your city. You have been asked to design a molecular diagnostic kit for quick detection of this retrovirus. How would you go about designing this kit?', 'choice1': 'First you identify the virus by performing DNA sequencing. You then develop a PCR kit for  quick and accurate diagnosis', 'choice2': 'First you identify the IgG antibodies for the infection. You then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG antibodies for quick \n and accurate diagnosis.', 'choice3': 'First you identify the virus using the information about the symptoms, provided by the affected patients. You then design a nested PCR kit based on the information for quick diagnosis.', 'choice4': 'First you identify the virus by performing cDNA sequencing.  You then develop a real time PCR kit for quick and accurate diagnosis.'}\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent dzzT', content='To detect a retrovirus, you need to start from its RNA genome. That means you first reverse-transcribe the viral RNA into cDNA and sequence it to identify specific viral gene targets. With those sequences in hand, you can design primers and probes for a quantitative real-time PCR assay, which offers rapid, sensitive, and specific detection. Options based on DNA sequencing (without reverse transcription) wonâ€™t work for an RNA virus, antibody detection is slower and indirect, and symptom-based identification is neither molecular nor precise. Therefore, choice D is correct.\n\nAnswer:D', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
