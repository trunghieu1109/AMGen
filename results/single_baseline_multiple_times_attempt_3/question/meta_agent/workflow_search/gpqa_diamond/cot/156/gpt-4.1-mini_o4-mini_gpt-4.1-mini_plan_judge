Question: Example(question='There has been an outbreak of an viral infectious disease in your city. You have been asked to design a molecular diagnostic kit for quick detection of this retrovirus. How would you go about designing this kit?', choice1='First you identify the virus by performing DNA sequencing. You then develop a PCR kit for  quick and accurate diagnosis', choice2='First you identify the IgG antibodies for the infection. You then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG antibodies for quick \n and accurate diagnosis.', choice3='First you identify the virus using the information about the symptoms, provided by the affected patients. You then design a nested PCR kit based on the information for quick diagnosis.', choice4='First you identify the virus by performing cDNA sequencing.  You then develop a real time PCR kit for quick and accurate diagnosis.', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: To detect a retrovirus, you need to start from its RNA genome. That means you first reverse-transcribe the viral RNA into cDNA and sequence it to identify specific viral gene targets. With those sequences in hand, you can design primers and probes for a quantitative real-time PCR assay, which offers rapid, sensitive, and specific detection. Options based on DNA sequencing (without reverse transcription) wonâ€™t work for an RNA virus, antibody detection is slower and indirect, and symptom-based identification is neither molecular nor precise. Therefore, choice D is correct.
