Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent ckaO', content='We need the fraction of Co(SCN)2 among all cobalt species. Using β values, species concentrations: [Co]0 = C0, [Co]1 = β1 C0 [SCN], [Co]2 = β2 C0 [SCN]^2, etc. Approximate [SCN]free≈0.1\u2009M, since Co total is only 0.01\u2009M. Then the total cobalt: C0(1+9·0.1+40·0.01+63·0.001+16·0.0001)=0.01 ⇒ C0≈0.004228\u2009M. So [Co(SCN)2]=β2·C0·[SCN]^2=40·0.004228·0.01≈0.001691\u2009M. Therefore the percentage of the dithiocyanato species is (0.001691/0.01)·100≈16.9%.\n\nAnswer:A)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
