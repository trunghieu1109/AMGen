Question: Example(question='We have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate, where the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M and the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16. What will be the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species in the solution? ', choice1='16.9%', choice2='42.3%', choice3='25.6%', choice4='38.1%', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: To find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes, we need to calculate the equilibrium concentrations of all cobalt species. The cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are Co(SCN)+, Co(SCN)2, Co(SCN)3-, and Co(SCN)42-. The stability constants are given as β1 = 9, β2 = 40, β3 = 63, and β4 = 16. We are particularly interested in Co(SCN)2, which is the dithiocyanato complex. The total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M and [SCN-] = 0.1 M. The formation of Co(SCN)2 can be described by the equilibrium: Co2+ + 2SCN- ⇌ Co(SCN)2 with β2 = 40. The concentration of Co(SCN)2 is given by [Co(SCN)2] = β2[Co2+][SCN-]^2. To find [Co2+], we need to consider all equilibria and the total cobalt concentration: [Co2+] + [Co(SCN)+] + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3-] + [Co(SCN)42-] = c(Co). Solving these equations, we find the concentration of Co(SCN)2 and divide it by the total cobalt concentration to get the percentage. After solving, the percentage of Co(SCN)2 is 42.3%.
