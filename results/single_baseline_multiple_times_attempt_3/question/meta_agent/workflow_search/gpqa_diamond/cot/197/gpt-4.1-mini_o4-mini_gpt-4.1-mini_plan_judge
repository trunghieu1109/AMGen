Question: Example(question='We have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate, where the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M and the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16. What will be the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species in the solution? ', choice1='16.9%', choice2='42.3%', choice3='25.6%', choice4='38.1%', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: We need the fraction of Co(SCN)2 among all cobalt species. Using β values, species concentrations: [Co]0 = C0, [Co]1 = β1 C0 [SCN], [Co]2 = β2 C0 [SCN]^2, etc. Approximate [SCN]free≈0.1 M, since Co total is only 0.01 M. Then the total cobalt: C0(1+9·0.1+40·0.01+63·0.001+16·0.0001)=0.01 ⇒ C0≈0.004228 M. So [Co(SCN)2]=β2·C0·[SCN]^2=40·0.004228·0.01≈0.001691 M. Therefore the percentage of the dithiocyanato species is (0.001691/0.01)·100≈16.9%.
