Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent ckaO', content="Given the total cobalt concentration c(Co) = 10^-2 M and SCN- concentration = 0.1 M, we want to find the fraction of the blue dithiocyanato complex Co(SCN)2 among all cobalt species. The stability constants (β) are cumulative formation constants for complexes: β1 = 9 for Co(SCN), β2 = 40 for Co(SCN)2, β3 = 63 for Co(SCN)3, and β4 = 16 for Co(SCN)4. Here, the values seem unusual as β values typically increase with more ligands, but we'll use them as given. The total concentration of cobalt is distributed among free Co2+ and its complexes. Let [Co2+] = x. Then, concentrations of complexes are: [Co(SCN)] = β1 * x * [SCN-], [Co(SCN)2] = β2 * x * [SCN-]^2, [Co(SCN)3] = β3 * x * [SCN-]^3, [Co(SCN)4] = β4 * x * [SCN-]^4. The mass balance for cobalt: c(Co) = x + β1 * x * [SCN-] + β2 * x * [SCN-]^2 + β3 * x * [SCN-]^3 + β4 * x * [SCN-]^4 = x (1 + β1*[SCN-] + β2*[SCN-]^2 + β3*[SCN-]^3 + β4*[SCN-]^4). Substituting [SCN-] = 0.1 M: sum = 1 + 9*0.1 + 40*(0.1)^2 + 63*(0.1)^3 + 16*(0.1)^4 = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646. So, x = c(Co) / 2.3646 = 0.01 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.00423 M. Then, [Co(SCN)2] = β2 * x * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.00423 * 0.01 = 0.001692 M. The fraction of Co(SCN)2 among total Co is 0.001692 / 0.01 = 0.1692 or 16.9%. So, the percentage is approximately 16.9%.\n\nAnswer:A)", prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
