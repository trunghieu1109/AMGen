proposed answer: The spin state is given as (3i, 4). We can write this as a column vector: |psi> = [3i, 4]. The Pauli matrix sigma_y is given by [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. To find the expectation value of S_y, we use the formula <S_y> = (hbar/2) * <psi|sigma_y|psi>, where <psi| is the conjugate transpose of |psi>.

First, write |psi>:
|psi> = [3i, 4]

Then, <psi| = [conj(3i), conj(4)] = [-3i, 4]

Calculate sigma_y|psi>:
[[0, -i], [i, 0]] * [3i, 4] = [0*3i + (-i)*4, i*3i + 0*4] = [-4i, 3i^2] = [-4i, 3*(-1)] = [-4i, -3]

Now calculate <psi|sigma_y|psi>:
[-3i, 4] * [-4i, -3] = (-3i)*(-4i) + 4*(-3) = ( -3i * -4i ) + (4 * -3)

Calculate each term:
-3i * -4i = 12 * i * i = 12 * (-1) = -12
4 * -3 = -12

Sum: -12 + (-12) = -24

Therefore, <S_y> = (hbar/2) * (-24) = -12 * hbar

Check the choices:
-25*hbar/2
-12*hbar/25
12*hbar/25
25*hbar/2

None exactly matches -12*hbar, but the closest is -12*hbar/25, which is much smaller in magnitude. So it seems there might be a normalization issue.

Check normalization of |psi|:
Norm^2 = |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = 9 + 16 = 25

Normalized |psi> = (1/5) * [3i, 4]

Recalculate with normalized state:
|psi> = [3i/5, 4/5]

<psi| = [-3i/5, 4/5]

sigma_y|psi> = [0, -i; i, 0] * [3i/5, 4/5] = [-4i/5, 3i^2/5] = [-4i/5, -3/5]

<psi|sigma_y|psi> = (-3i/5)*(-4i/5) + (4/5)*(-3/5) = (12/25)*i*i + (-12/25) = (12/25)*(-1) + (-12/25) = -12/25 - 12/25 = -24/25

Therefore, <S_y> = (hbar/2) * (-24/25) = -12*hbar/25

This matches choice B).
