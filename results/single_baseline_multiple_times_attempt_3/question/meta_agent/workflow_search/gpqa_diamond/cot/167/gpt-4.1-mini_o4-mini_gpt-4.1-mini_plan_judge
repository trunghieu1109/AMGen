Question: Example(question='Which of the following issues are the most common sources of difficult-to-spot erroneous results generated in genomics data analysis:\n\n- Mutually incompatible data formats\n- The "chr" / "no chr" confusion\n- Reference assembly mismatch\n- Incorrect ID conversion', choice1='3 and 4', choice2='2 and 3', choice3='All of the above', choice4='2, 3 and 4', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: Mutually incompatible data formats usually cause immediate errors or obvious failures, so they are less likely to be ‘silent’ mistakes. In contrast, inconsistencies like “chr”/“no chr” prefixes, reference assembly mismatches, and incorrect ID conversions often pass through pipelines unnoticed and result in subtly erroneous outputs. Therefore the issues most commonly causing difficult-to-spot errors are 2, 3, and 4.
