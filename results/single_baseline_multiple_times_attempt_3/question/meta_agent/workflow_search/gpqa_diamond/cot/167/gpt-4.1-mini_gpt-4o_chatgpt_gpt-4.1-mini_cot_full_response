Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 2cpG', content="To determine which issues are the most common sources of difficult-to-spot erroneous results in genomics data analysis, we need to evaluate each option. Mutually incompatible data formats can lead to errors if data from different sources are not properly integrated. The 'chr' / 'no chr' confusion refers to differences in chromosome naming conventions, which can cause errors in data alignment or analysis. Reference assembly mismatch occurs when data is analyzed against an incorrect reference genome, leading to erroneous conclusions. Incorrect ID conversion can result in misinterpretation of data due to wrong mapping of identifiers. All these issues are known to cause problems in genomics data analysis, and each can be difficult to spot. The choice 'All of the above' includes all these issues, suggesting it is the most comprehensive answer.\n\nAnswer:C)", prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
