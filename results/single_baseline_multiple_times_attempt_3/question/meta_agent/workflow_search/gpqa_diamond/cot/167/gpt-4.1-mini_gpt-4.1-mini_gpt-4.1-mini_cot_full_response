Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 2cpG', content='The question asks about the most common sources of difficult-to-spot erroneous results in genomics data analysis. The options listed are: 1) Mutually incompatible data formats, 2) The "chr" / "no chr" confusion, 3) Reference assembly mismatch, and 4) Incorrect ID conversion. Each of these can cause errors, but mutually incompatible data formats (1) are often more immediately noticeable because they typically cause outright failures or errors. The other issues (2, 3, and 4) can subtly cause incorrect results without obvious errors, making them difficult to spot. Therefore, the most common sources of difficult-to-spot errors are 2, 3, and 4. Option 4 corresponds to this choice.\n\nAnswer:D)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
