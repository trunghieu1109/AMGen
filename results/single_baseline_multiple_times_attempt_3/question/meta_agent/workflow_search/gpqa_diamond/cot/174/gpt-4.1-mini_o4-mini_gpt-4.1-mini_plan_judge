Question: Example(question='Consider an oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis). Because it oscillates, it would radiate at a wavelength \\lambda. In the radiation zone, the radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of \\lambda and the angle \\theta (with z-axis), along which the power is measured. If the maximum power thus radiated is A, the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle \\theta = 30^0 and a possible form of f are, respectively,', choice1='1/2, \\lambda^(-4)', choice2='3/4, \\lambda^(-6)', choice3='1/4, \\lambda^(-4)', choice4='1/4, \\lambda^(-3)', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The oscillating spheroidal charge distribution has no dipole moment but a time-varying quadrupole moment. Quadrupole radiation scales as k^6 ∝ λ^(-6), and the angular distribution is ∝ sin^2θ cos^2θ. The maximum occurs at θ=45°, and at θ=30° the fraction is (sin^2 30° cos^2 30°)/(sin^2 45° cos^2 45°) = (1/4·3/4)/(1/2·1/2) = 3/4.
