Question: Example(question='Consider an oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis). Because it oscillates, it would radiate at a wavelength \\lambda. In the radiation zone, the radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of \\lambda and the angle \\theta (with z-axis), along which the power is measured. If the maximum power thus radiated is A, the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle \\theta = 30^0 and a possible form of f are, respectively,', choice1='1/2, \\lambda^(-4)', choice2='3/4, \\lambda^(-6)', choice3='1/4, \\lambda^(-4)', choice4='1/4, \\lambda^(-3)', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: The problem describes a spheroidal oscillating charge distribution radiating electromagnetic waves. The radiation pattern of such a distribution depends on the angle \theta with respect to the symmetry axis. For a dipole-like radiation pattern, the power radiated per unit solid angle is proportional to sin^2(\theta). At \theta = 90^0, sin^2(90^0) = 1, which is the maximum power per unit solid angle, denoted as A. At \theta = 30^0, sin^2(30^0) = (1/2)^2 = 1/4. Thus, the fraction of the maximum power radiated at \theta = 30^0 is 1/4. The power radiated by an oscillating electric dipole is proportional to \lambda^(-4), which matches with the functional form given in choice 3.
