    <pre>To determine how many stars are detectable using the ESPRESSO spectrograph, we need to consider the apparent magnitude of each star as seen from Earth. The apparent magnitude is influenced by the absolute magnitude and the distance to the star. The formula to calculate the apparent magnitude (m) from the absolute magnitude (M) and distance (d, in parsecs) is: m = M + 5 * (log10(d) - 1). 

Let&#39;s calculate the apparent magnitudes:

- a) Canopus: Canopus is a very bright star with an apparent magnitude of about -0.74. It is easily detectable.
- b) Polaris: Polaris has an apparent magnitude of about 1.98. It is detectable.
- c) Star with M = 15 mag and d = 10 pc: m = 15 + 5 * (log10(10) - 1) = 15 + 5 * 0 = 15. This is faint but potentially detectable.
- d) Star with M = 15 mag and d = 200 pc: m = 15 + 5 * (log10(200) - 1) = 15 + 5 * (2.301 - 1) = 15 + 5 * 1.301 = 21.505. This is too faint and likely not detectable.
- e) Star with M = 15 mag and d = 5 pc: m = 15 + 5 * (log10(5) - 1) = 15 + 5 * (0.699 - 1) = 15 + 5 * -0.301 = 15 - 1.505 = 13.495. This is faint but potentially detectable.
- f) Star with M = 15 mag and d = 50 pc: m = 15 + 5 * (log10(50) - 1) = 15 + 5 * (1.699 - 1) = 15 + 5 * 0.699 = 15 + 3.495 = 18.495. This is faint and likely not detectable.

Considering the signal-to-noise ratio requirement, stars a, b, c, and e are potentially detectable. Therefore, the number of detectable stars is 4.
