Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent A3AB', content='Estimate the ESPRESSO 1-UT limit at S/N=10 in 1h as V≈16. Canopus (V≈–0.7) and Polaris (V≈2) are detectable. A M=15 star has m=15 at 10pc and m≈13.5 at 5pc (both <16), but m≈18.5 at 50pc and ≈21.5 at 200pc (both >16). Thus a, b, c, e are detectable → 4 stars.\n\nAnswer:A)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
