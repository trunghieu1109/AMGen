    <pre>First, we need to determine the apparent magnitude of each star to assess if it can achieve a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure with the ESPRESSO spectrograph on an 8m VLT telescope. The detectability is linked to the star&#39;s apparent magnitude and the instrument&#39;s limiting magnitude for S/N=10 in 1 hour. 

Given the ESPRESSO spectrograph&#39;s capabilities, it can detect stars roughly down to V~16 magnitude with S/N=10 in 1 hour exposure on an 8m telescope (from ESPRESSO documentation and typical performance).

Let&#39;s analyze each star:

a) Canopus: Apparent magnitude approx -0.72 (very bright), definitely detectable.
b) Polaris: Apparent magnitude approx 2.0 (bright), definitely detectable.
c) Star with Absolute V mag = 15 at 10 pc: Apparent magnitude = Absolute magnitude + 5*log10(distance/10pc) = 15 + 5*log10(10/10) = 15 + 0 = 15. This is at the limit but likely detectable.
d) Star with Absolute V mag = 15 at 200 pc: Apparent magnitude = 15 + 5*log10(200/10) = 15 + 5*log10(20) = 15 + 5*1.3010 = 15 + 6.505 = 21.5, too faint to detect.
e) Star with Absolute V mag = 15 at 5 pc: Apparent magnitude = 15 + 5*log10(5/10) = 15 + 5*(-0.3010) = 15 - 1.505 = 13.5, detectable.
f) Star with Absolute V mag = 15 at 50 pc: Apparent magnitude = 15 + 5*log10(50/10) = 15 + 5*0.6990 = 15 + 3.495 = 18.5, too faint to detect.

Detectable stars: a) Canopus, b) Polaris, c) Star at 10 pc (V=15), e) Star at 5 pc (V=13.5). That&#39;s 4 stars.

So, the answer is 4.
