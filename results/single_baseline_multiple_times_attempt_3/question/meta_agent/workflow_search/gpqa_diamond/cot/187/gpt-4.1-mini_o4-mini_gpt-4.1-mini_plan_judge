Question: Example(question='Consider a rhombohedral crystal, with the interatomic distance of 10 Angstrom and the angles $\\quad\\alpha=\\beta=\\gamma=30^{0}$. What is the interplanar distance of the (111) plane of the crystal?\n', choice1='9.54 Angstrom', choice2='8.95 Angstrom', choice3='9.08 Angstrom', choice4='10.05 Angstrom', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: We have a rhombohedral cell with a = 10 Å and α = β = γ = 30°. The direct metric G has elements G_ij = a^2 (δ_ij + (1−δ_ij) cosα) with cos30° = 0.8660. Its inverse G* = G^−1 = (1/a^2) M^−1 where M = [[1, c, c],[c,1,c],[c,c,1]]. Solving for M^−1 gives diagonal x ≈5.099 and off-diagonal y ≈−2.366. Then 1/d^2 = (h k l)·G*·(h k l)^T = (1/a^2)[x(h^2+k^2+l^2) + 2y(hk+kl+hl)]. For (111): h^2+k^2+l^2=3, hk+kl+hl=3 so 1/d^2=(1/100)[3×5.099 +6×(−2.366)]≈1.101/100. Hence d=10/√1.101≈9.53 Å, matching choice 1.
