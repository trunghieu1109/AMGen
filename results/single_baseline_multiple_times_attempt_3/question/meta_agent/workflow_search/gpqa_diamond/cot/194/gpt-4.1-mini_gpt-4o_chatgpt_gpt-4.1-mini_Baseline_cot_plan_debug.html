    <pre>To determine the maximum orbital period of the second planet that will exhibit both transit and occultation events, we need to consider the geometry of the system. The key is the shared orbital plane and the transit impact parameter. The transit impact parameter of the first planet is 0.2, meaning it passes close enough to the center of the star to produce a transit. For the second planet to also transit, it must have a similar or smaller impact parameter. The maximum impact parameter for a transit is when the planet just grazes the star, i.e., the planet&#39;s path is tangent to the star&#39;s disk. Since the second planet is in the same orbital plane, it will have the same impact parameter of 0.2. The impact parameter is related to the inclination of the orbit and the size of the star. For a circular orbit, the inclination angle i is given by cos(i) = b/R_star, where b is the impact parameter and R_star is the star&#39;s radius. The maximum orbital period corresponds to the largest semi-major axis that still allows for a transit, which is when the planet&#39;s orbit is tangent to the star&#39;s disk. The semi-major axis a is related to the orbital period P by Kepler&#39;s third law: P^2 ∝ a^3 / M_star. The gravitational parameter M_star is constant for the system. The ratio of the periods of the second and first planet is (P2/P1)^2 = (a2/a1)^3. Since the impact parameter is the same, the ratio of the semi-major axes is a2/a1 = (R_star + R_planet2) / (R_star + R_planet1). The radius of the star is 1.5 times the Sun&#39;s radius, and the radii of the planets are given in Earth radii. The first planet&#39;s radius is 1 Earth radius, and the second planet&#39;s radius is 2.5 Earth radii. Therefore, the ratio of the semi-major axes is a2/a1 = (1.5*R_sun + 2.5*R_earth) / (1.5*R_sun + 1*R_earth). We can approximate R_sun &gt;&gt; R_earth, so a2/a1 ≈ 1. Therefore, the maximum orbital period of the second planet is approximately the same as the first planet, which is 3 days. However, we must also consider the occultation condition, which requires the planet to pass behind the star. This condition is satisfied for all orbits that allow transits, as the planet will naturally pass behind the star if it transits in a circular orbit. Therefore, we are looking for the choice that is closest to the calculated maximum period, which is approximately 3 days. However, considering the choices given, it seems the correct interpretation of the problem leads to a choice that is larger than 3 days but still satisfies the transit condition. Re-evaluating the possible answers, the closest one that makes sense given the constraints is choice C) ~ 37.5, which is a plausible maximum period considering the geometric constraints and the fact that it is larger than 3 days but still within a reasonable range for the given system.
