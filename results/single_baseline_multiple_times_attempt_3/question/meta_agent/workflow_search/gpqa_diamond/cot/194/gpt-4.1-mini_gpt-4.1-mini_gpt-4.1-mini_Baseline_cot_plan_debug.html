    <pre>First, let&#39;s understand the problem: We have a star with radius 1.5 times the Sun&#39;s radius, and a first planet with radius 1 Earth radius, orbiting with a period of 3 days and an impact parameter of 0.2. A second planet with radius 2.5 Earth radii is in the same system and orbital plane. We want the maximum orbital period of the second planet so that it still exhibits both transit and occultation events.

Key points:
- Both planets have circular orbits and share the same orbital plane.
- Transit occurs when the planet passes in front of the star (from our viewpoint).
- Occultation occurs when the planet passes behind the star.
- For both transit and occultation to occur, the planet&#39;s orbit must be aligned such that the impact parameter b satisfies b &lt; 1 + (Rp/Rs) for transit and occultation, where Rp is planet radius and Rs is star radius.

Given the first planet&#39;s impact parameter b1 = 0.2 and period P1 = 3 days, and radius Rp1 = 1 Earth radius, star radius Rs = 1.5 Solar radii.

The impact parameter is b = (a/Rs) * cos(i), where a is orbital radius and i is inclination.

Since both planets share the same orbital plane, the inclination i is the same for both.

For the first planet:
- b1 = (a1/Rs) * cos(i) = 0.2

For the second planet:
- b2 = (a2/Rs) * cos(i)

Since cos(i) = b1 * (Rs / a1), then
- b2 = (a2/Rs) * cos(i) = (a2/Rs) * b1 * (Rs / a1) = b1 * (a2 / a1)

For transit and occultation to occur, the maximum impact parameter b_max is approximately 1 + (Rp/Rs) (to account for planet radius). Since the planet radius is much smaller than star radius, b_max ~ 1 + (Rp/Rs).

Calculate Rp2/Rs:
- Rp2 = 2.5 Earth radii
- Rs = 1.5 Solar radii

Earth radius = 6371 km
Solar radius = 696,340 km

Rp2 in km = 2.5 * 6371 = 15927.5 km
Rs in km = 1.5 * 696,340 = 1,044,510 km

Rp2/Rs = 15927.5 / 1,044,510 ≈ 0.01525

So b_max = 1 + 0.01525 = 1.01525

We want b2 &lt;= b_max for transit and occultation.

From above, b2 = b1 * (a2 / a1) &lt;= 1.01525

=&gt; (a2 / a1) &lt;= 1.01525 / b1 = 1.01525 / 0.2 = 5.07625

So a2 &lt;= 5.07625 * a1

Using Kepler&#39;s third law, P^2 ∝ a^3

Given P1 = 3 days, a1 known, then

P2 = P1 * (a2 / a1)^{3/2} &lt;= 3 * (5.07625)^{3/2}

Calculate (5.07625)^{3/2}:
- sqrt(5.07625) ≈ 2.253
- (2.253)^3 ≈ 11.43

So P2 &lt;= 3 * 11.43 ≈ 34.3 days

Looking at the choices, the closest is 33.5 days.

Therefore, the maximum orbital period is approximately 33.5 days.
