Question: Example(question='Astronomers are observing a planet with a radius of 1 Earth radius in a circular orbit, with a transit impact parameter of 0.2, around a star that has a radius 1.5 times that of the Sun. This planet has an orbital period of 3 days. What is the maximum orbital period of a second planet, with a radius of 2.5 times that of Earth, in the same system that will exhibit both transit and occultation events? Assume that the second planet also has a circular orbit and shares the same orbital plane as the previously mentioned transiting planet.', choice1='~ 7.5', choice2='~ 33.5', choice3='~ 37.5', choice4='~ 12.5', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: First, derive the orbital inclination from the first planet’s transit impact parameter b1=0.2. Let a1/R* be the scaled semi-major axis. From Kepler’s third law and noting that the ratio P∝a3/2, the exact stellar mass cancels in the ratio computations. We have b1=(a1/R*)cos i so cos i=b1/(a1/R*). The maximum a/R* for the second planet so that it still transits and occults is given by (a2/R*)cos i≤1+Rp2/R*. Combining these gives a2/a1=(1+Rp2/R*)/b1. Numerically Rp2/R*=2.5 Re/(1.5 R☉)=0.0153 so (1+Rp2/R*)/b1≈1.0153/0.2=5.076. Then P2=3 d×(a2/a1)3/2≈3×5.0761.5≈34.3 d, i.e. choice ~33.5 days.
