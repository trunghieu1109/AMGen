Question: {'question': 'Which of the following (effective) particles is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry?', 'choice1': 'Magnon', 'choice2': 'Skyrmion', 'choice3': 'Pion', 'choice4': 'Phonon'}\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent BWyY', content='Magnons are quasiparticles associated with spin waves in a magnetically ordered system, arising due to spontaneous breaking of spin rotational symmetry. Pions can be viewed as Nambu-Goldstone bosons resulting from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics. Phonons are quanta of lattice vibrations and are associated with the spontaneous breaking of continuous translational symmetry in the crystal lattice. Skyrmions, however, are topological solitons representing stable field configurations and are not directly associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry in the same sense as the other particles listed. Therefore, the particle not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry is the Skyrmion.\n\nAnswer:B)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
