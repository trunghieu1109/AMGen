Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent BWyY', content='Magnons arise as Goldstone bosons from spontaneously broken spin-rotation symmetry in magnets. Pions are Goldstone bosons from spontaneously broken chiral symmetry in QCD. Phonons are Goldstone bosons from spontaneously broken translational symmetry in crystals. Skyrmions, however, are topological solitons rather than Goldstone bosons and are not directly associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry.\n\nAnswer:B)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
