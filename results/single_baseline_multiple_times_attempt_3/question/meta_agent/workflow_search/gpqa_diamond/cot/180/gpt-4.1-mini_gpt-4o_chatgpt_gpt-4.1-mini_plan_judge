Question: Example(question='Very large number of neutrinos produced by the Sun reach the Earth (very large flux of neutrinos, defined as the number of neutrinos per cm^2, per second).\n\nLet us assume that, hypothetically, the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the core of the Sun about 8 and a half minutes ago, while all other reactions remained as they were.\n\nWhat would be the approximate ratio of the flux between two bands of neutrino energies of 700-800 KeV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). \n\nFlux (band 1) / flux (band 2) is:\n\n(Note: we are talking about stopping the pp-III branch, not pp-II, pp-I or any other. Itâ€™s not a typo or something like that.)\n(Note 2: solar neutrino flavor changes happen, but do not play a role here.)', choice1='0.1 (10^-1).', choice2='10.', choice3='1.', choice4='0.01 (10^-2).', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The pp-III branch in the Sun's core is responsible for producing certain neutrinos, particularly from the decay of boron-8, which results in neutrinos with energies typically above 800 keV. The pp-I and pp-II chains produce neutrinos in the lower energy range, often below 800 keV. If the pp-III branch stops, the flux of neutrinos in the 800-900 keV range (band 2) would decrease significantly because this band is primarily populated by neutrinos from the pp-III branch. However, the 700-800 keV range (band 1) would be less affected because it is less reliant on the pp-III branch and more on pp-I and pp-II. Therefore, the ratio of flux (band 1) to flux (band 2) would increase significantly because the denominator (flux in band 2) decreases more than the numerator (flux in band 1). Hence, the ratio would be much greater than 1.
