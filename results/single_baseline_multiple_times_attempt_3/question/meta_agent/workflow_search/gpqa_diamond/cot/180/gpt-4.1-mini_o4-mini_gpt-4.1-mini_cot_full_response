Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent bD3a', content='Stopping the pp-III branch eliminates almost all neutrinos in both bands except the small B8 continuum. Band\u20092 still has the strong 862\u2009keV Be-7 line, while band\u20091 has virtually no lines and only a tiny B8 tail. That makes flux1/flux2 ≪1, closest choice ~10⁻².\n\nAnswer:D)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
