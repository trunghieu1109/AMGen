    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;The reaction of an electron pair donor, nucleophile (Nu) with an electron pair acceptor is called nucleophilic substitution reaction. An sp3-hybridized electrophile needs to have a leaving group to proceed with the reaction. Substitution reactions have the following two types. One is SN1 and the other is the SN2 reaction. In contrast to the substitution reaction, the elimination reaction involves the removal of a pair or groups of atoms from a molecule. These are chemical reactions in which single carbon-carbon bonded organic compounds are converted to compounds containing double/triple bonds (unsaturated compounds).\nArrange the following nucleophiles more reactive to the poorest reactive in the aqueous solution.\n\n1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate\n2. Hydroxide\n3. Propionate\n4. Methanol\n5.

    <pre>In aqueous solution, nucleophilicity depends on several factors including charge, electronegativity, steric hindrance, and solvation effects. Generally, negatively charged species are better nucleophiles than neutral ones. Among the given nucleophiles: 1) 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (alkoxide), 2) Hydroxide (OH-), 3) Propionate (carboxylate), 4) Methanol (neutral alcohol), 5) Ethanethiolate (RS-). Thiolates (RS-) are generally more nucleophilic than alkoxides (RO-) because sulfur is larger and less electronegative, making it more polarizable and better nucleophile. Hydroxide is a strong nucleophile but less than ethanethiolate. Alkoxides are also good nucleophiles but less than thiolates. Carboxylates are resonance stabilized, so less nucleophilic than alkoxides. Methanol is neutral and least nucleophilic. Therefore, the order is: Ethanethiolate (5) &gt; Hydroxide (2) &gt; 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (1) &gt; Propionate (3) &gt; Methanol (4). This matches choice3: &#39;5, 2, 3, 1 and 4&#39; except that 3 and 1 are swapped. But between propionate and 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate, alkoxides (1) are more nucleophilic than carboxylates (3) due to resonance stabilization in carboxylates. So the correct order is 5, 2, 1, 3, 4 which matches choice1. Hence, choice1 is correct.
