proposed answer: First, analyze the mass dimensions of each component in the interaction Lagrangian \( \mathcal{L}_{int} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu} \).

In 4-dimensional spacetime, the Lagrangian density has mass dimension 4.

- The fermion field \( \psi \) has mass dimension \( \frac{3}{2} \).
- \( \bar{\psi} \) has the same mass dimension as \( \psi \), which is \( \frac{3}{2} \).
- \( \sigma_{\mu\nu} \) is constructed from gamma matrices, which are dimensionless.
- The field strength tensor \( F^{\mu\nu} \) has mass dimension 2.

Putting these together:
\[
[\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}] = [\bar{\psi}] + [\sigma_{\mu\nu}] + [\psi] + [F^{\mu\nu}] = \frac{3}{2} + 0 + \frac{3}{2} + 2 = 3 + 2 = 5.
\]

Since the Lagrangian density has dimension 4, and the operator part has dimension 5, the coupling constant \( \kappa \) must have dimension:
\[
[\kappa] = 4 - 5 = -1.
\]

A coupling constant with negative mass dimension indicates a non-renormalizable interaction.

Therefore, \( [\kappa]_M = -1 \) and the theory is not renormalizable.
