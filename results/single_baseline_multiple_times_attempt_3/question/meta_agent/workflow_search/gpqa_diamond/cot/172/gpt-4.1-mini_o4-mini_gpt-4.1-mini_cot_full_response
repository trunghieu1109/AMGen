Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent zrGJ', content='We estimate ΔE from the uncertainty in kinetic energy of a free electron. Kinetic energy E = p²/(2m), so for small uncertainties: ΔE ≈ |dE/dp| Δp = (p/m) Δp = v Δp, since p ≈ m v. From Heisenberg: Δx Δp ≈ ħ/2 ⇒ Δp ≈ ħ/(2 Δx). Therefore ΔE ≈ v ħ/(2 Δx). Plug in values: ħ ≃ 1.05×10⁻³⁴ J·s, v = 2×10⁸ m/s, Δx = 0.1 nm = 1×10⁻¹⁰ m. So ΔE ≃ (2×10⁸ m/s × 1.05×10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (2 × 1×10⁻¹⁰ m) ≃ (2.1×10⁻²⁶ J·m)/(2×10⁻¹⁰ m) ≃ 1.05×10⁻¹⁶ J ≃ 10⁻¹⁶ J.\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
