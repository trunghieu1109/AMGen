Question: Example(question="If uncertainty in space of electron's location, which is travelling with speed v= 2* 10^8 m/s along x-direction is Δx=0.1 nm . Based on the infromation estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of electron.", choice1='~10^(-19) J', choice2='~10^(-18) J', choice3='~10^(-16) J', choice4='~10^(-17) J', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: Given: Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 × 10^-9 m = 10^-10 m, v = 2 × 10^8 m/s. We need to find the minimum uncertainty in energy ΔE. Using Heisenberg's uncertainty principle for position and momentum: Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2. ħ (reduced Planck's constant) = h/(2π) ≈ 1.054 × 10^-34 Js. Calculate Δp: Δp ≥ ħ/(2Δx) = 1.054 × 10^-34 / (2 × 10^-10) = 5.27 × 10^-25 kg m/s. The uncertainty in kinetic energy ΔE can be approximated as ΔE = v * Δp (since E = p^2/2m and ΔE ~ v Δp for small uncertainties). So, ΔE ≈ (2 × 10^8) * (5.27 × 10^-25) = 1.054 × 10^-16 J. This corresponds to choice C) ~10^(-16) J.
