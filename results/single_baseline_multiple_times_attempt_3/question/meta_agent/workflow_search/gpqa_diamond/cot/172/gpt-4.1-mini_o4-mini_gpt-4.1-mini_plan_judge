Question: Example(question="If uncertainty in space of electron's location, which is travelling with speed v= 2* 10^8 m/s along x-direction is Δx=0.1 nm . Based on the infromation estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of electron.", choice1='~10^(-19) J', choice2='~10^(-18) J', choice3='~10^(-16) J', choice4='~10^(-17) J', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: We estimate ΔE from the uncertainty in kinetic energy of a free electron. Kinetic energy E = p²/(2m), so for small uncertainties: ΔE ≈ |dE/dp| Δp = (p/m) Δp = v Δp, since p ≈ m v. From Heisenberg: Δx Δp ≈ ħ/2 ⇒ Δp ≈ ħ/(2 Δx). Therefore ΔE ≈ v ħ/(2 Δx). Plug in values: ħ ≃ 1.05×10⁻³⁴ J·s, v = 2×10⁸ m/s, Δx = 0.1 nm = 1×10⁻¹⁰ m. So ΔE ≃ (2×10⁸ m/s × 1.05×10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (2 × 1×10⁻¹⁰ m) ≃ (2.1×10⁻²⁶ J·m)/(2×10⁻¹⁰ m) ≃ 1.05×10⁻¹⁶ J ≃ 10⁻¹⁶ J.
