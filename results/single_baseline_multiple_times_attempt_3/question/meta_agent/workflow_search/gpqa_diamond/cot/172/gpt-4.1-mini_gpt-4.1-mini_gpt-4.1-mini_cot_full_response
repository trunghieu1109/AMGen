Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent zrGJ', content="Given: Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 × 10^-9 m = 10^-10 m, v = 2 × 10^8 m/s. We need to find the minimum uncertainty in energy ΔE. Using Heisenberg's uncertainty principle for position and momentum: Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2. ħ (reduced Planck's constant) = h/(2π) ≈ 1.054 × 10^-34 Js. Calculate Δp: Δp ≥ ħ/(2Δx) = 1.054 × 10^-34 / (2 × 10^-10) = 5.27 × 10^-25 kg m/s. The uncertainty in kinetic energy ΔE can be approximated as ΔE = v * Δp (since E = p^2/2m and ΔE ~ v Δp for small uncertainties). So, ΔE ≈ (2 × 10^8) * (5.27 × 10^-25) = 1.054 × 10^-16 J. This corresponds to choice C) ~10^(-16) J.\n\nAnswer:C)", prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
