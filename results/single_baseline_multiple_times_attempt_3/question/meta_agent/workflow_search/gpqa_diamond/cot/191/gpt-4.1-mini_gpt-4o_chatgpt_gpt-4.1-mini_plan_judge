Question: Example(question='Imagine an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ having a small spherical cavity inside. The centre of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the centre of the spherical conductor. The radius of the cavity is $r$, and $r<R$. Now consider a small amount of positive charge $+q$ is somehow placed somewhere inside the cavity. What is the magnitude of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at a point P (outside the spherical conductor) of distance $L$ from the centre of the spherical conductor? Note, the distance of the point P from the centre of the cavity is $l$. Here, l, L > R. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\\theta$\n', choice1='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n', choice2='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n', choice3='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\n', choice4='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: The problem involves a charge +q inside a cavity of a spherical conductor. By Gauss's Law, the electric field inside the conductor material is zero, and the conductor itself will have an induced charge distribution such that the electric field outside the conductor is as if the entire charge +q is at the center of the conductor. This is because the conductor redistributes its charges to maintain electrostatic equilibrium. Outside the conductor, the electric field will be equivalent to that of a point charge +q located at the center of the conductor. Therefore, the electric field at a point P outside the conductor, at a distance L from the center of the conductor, is as if there is a point charge +q at the center of the conductor. Thus, the magnitude of the electric field at point P is given by the expression for the electric field due to a point charge, which is $E = \dfrac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_o} \dfrac{q}{L^2}$.
