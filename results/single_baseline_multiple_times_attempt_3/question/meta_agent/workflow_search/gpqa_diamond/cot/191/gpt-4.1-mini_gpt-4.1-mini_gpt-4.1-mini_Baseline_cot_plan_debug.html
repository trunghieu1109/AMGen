    <pre>The spherical conductor is uncharged and has a cavity inside it with a positive charge +q placed inside the cavity. Since the conductor is a perfect conductor and uncharged, the charge +q inside the cavity will induce charges on the inner surface of the cavity and on the outer surface of the conductor such that the net charge on the conductor remains zero. The conductor shields the outside from any electric field generated by the charge inside the cavity. Therefore, the electric field outside the spherical conductor (at a distance L &gt; R from the center of the conductor) will be zero, as if there is no charge inside. However, if the conductor is isolated and uncharged, the induced charges on the outer surface will cancel the effect of the charge inside, so the external field is zero. But here, the problem asks for the magnitude of the electric field at a point P outside the conductor due to the charge +q inside the cavity. Since the conductor shields the field, the field outside is zero. But if the conductor is grounded or isolated, the field outside is as if the conductor is neutral. The problem&#39;s options suggest a Coulomb field with distances l, L, and terms involving s and theta. The key is that the conductor shields the field outside, so the field outside is zero. But none of the options say zero. Alternatively, if the conductor is neutral and isolated, the induced charges on the outer surface will cancel the effect of the charge inside, so the external field is zero. But if the conductor is just a shell with a cavity and a charge inside, the outside field is as if the charge is at the center of the conductor. So the field outside is equivalent to a point charge +q at the center of the conductor, meaning E = (1/4πε₀)(q/L^2). Therefore, the correct formula for the field outside at distance L is E = (1/4πε₀)(q/L^2). Hence, the correct choice is choice4: E = (1/4πε₀)(q/L^2).
