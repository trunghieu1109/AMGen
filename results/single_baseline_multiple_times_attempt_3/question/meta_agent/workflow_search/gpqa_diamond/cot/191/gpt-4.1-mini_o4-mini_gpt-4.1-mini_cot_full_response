Question: {'question': 'Imagine an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ having a small spherical cavity inside. The centre of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the centre of the spherical conductor. The radius of the cavity is $r$, and $r<R$. Now consider a small amount of positive charge $+q$ is somehow placed somewhere inside the cavity. What is the magnitude of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at a point P (outside the spherical conductor) of distance $L$ from the centre of the spherical conductor? Note, the distance of the point P from the centre of the cavity is $l$. Here, l, L > R.

Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent fldN', content='When a charge +q is placed inside the cavity of an uncharged conducting sphere, it induces –q on the cavity wall and +q on the outer surface. By Gauss’s law (or uniqueness theorem), the field outside the conductor is as if the net charge +q were concentrated at the centre of the conductor. Thus at a distance L\u2009>\u2009R from the centre, E = (1/4πε₀)(q/L²).\n\nAnswer:D)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
