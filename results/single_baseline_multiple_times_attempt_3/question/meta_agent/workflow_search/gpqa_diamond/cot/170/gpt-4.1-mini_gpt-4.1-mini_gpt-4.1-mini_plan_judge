proposed answer: We are dealing with electrophilic substitution on monosubstituted benzene derivatives. The substituents influence the orientation and distribution of the substitution products (ortho, meta, para). Electron-donating groups (EDGs) generally direct to ortho and para positions, with para often favored due to steric reasons. Electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) generally direct to meta positions, resulting in lower para substitution yields.

Let's analyze each substituent:
1) C6H5-CH3 (toluene): methyl is an EDG, ortho/para directing, high para yield.
2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (ethyl benzoate): ester group is an EWG, meta directing, low para yield.
3) C6H5-Cl (chlorobenzene): Cl is a deactivating but ortho/para directing substituent, moderate para yield.
4) C6H5-NO2 (nitrobenzene): strong EWG, meta directing, very low para yield.
5) C6H5-C2H5 (ethylbenzene): alkyl group, EDG, ortho/para directing, high para yield.
6) C6H5-COOH (benzoic acid): carboxyl group, EWG, meta directing, low para yield.

Order of increasing para isomer yield should be from strong meta directors (lowest para) to strong ortho/para directors (highest para):

Lowest para yield: 4 (NO2) < 2 (COOC2H5) < 6 (COOH) < 3 (Cl) < 1 (CH3) < 5 (C2H5) Highest para yield

Comparing with the options:
Choice 2: 4<2<6<3<1<5 matches exactly.

Therefore, the correct answer is B).
