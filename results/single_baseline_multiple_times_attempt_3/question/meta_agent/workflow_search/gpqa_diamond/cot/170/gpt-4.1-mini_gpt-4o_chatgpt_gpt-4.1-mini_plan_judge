proposed answer: The question asks for the order of substances in terms of the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer in an electrophilic substitution reaction with bromine. Electrophilic substitution reactions on benzene rings are influenced by the substituents present. Activating groups (e.g., -CH3, -C2H5) direct ortho/para, while deactivating groups (e.g., -NO2, -COOH) direct meta. The order of para-isomer formation is determined by the relative activating/deactivating nature of the substituents. Strongly activating groups like alkyl groups will favor para isomer formation more than weakly activating or deactivating groups. For the given compounds: 1) C6H5-CH3 (toluene) is an ortho/para director with high para yield. 2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (ester) is a weakly deactivating group, meta director. 3) C6H5-Cl (chloro) is a weakly deactivating ortho/para director. 4) C6H5-NO2 (nitro) is a strongly deactivating meta director. 5) C6H5-C2H5 (ethylbenzene) is an ortho/para director with high para yield. 6) C6H5-COOH (carboxylic acid) is a deactivating meta director. The order of increasing para-isomer yield would be from the most deactivating meta directors to the least deactivating or activating ortho/para directors. Therefore, the order is 4<6<2<1<5<3.
