Question: Example(question='Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are\nconstrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system\ncorrect to three decimals?', choice1='2.822 x 10^-26', choice2='5.645 x 10^-26', choice3='7.056 x 10^-27', choice4='122.330', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: We have 13 charges of Q=2e each. One at center, 12 on sphere of radius 2 m at vertices of a regular icosahedron. Total energy U = U_cp + U_pp. U_cp = 12·kQ²/(2) ≃5.539×10⁻²⁷ J. For the 12 on sphere, distances come in 30 edges of length s=2.1036 m, 30 of length 3.236 m, and 6 antipodal pairs of length 4 m. Summing U_pp = kQ²·∑(1/r_ij) ≃9.232×10⁻²⁸·(30/2+30/3.236+6/3.804)/2 ≃2.269×10⁻²⁶ J. Hence U_total ≃2.822×10⁻²⁶ J, matching choice A).
