    <pre>There are 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e, where e is the elementary charge (approximately 1.6 x 10^-19 C). One charge is fixed at point P, and the other 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from point P. We need to find the minimum energy of the system. The energy here refers to the electrostatic potential energy of the system. The potential energy between two point charges q1 and q2 separated by distance r is given by U = k * q1 * q2 / r, where k = 8.99 x 10^9 Nm^2/C^2. The 13th charge at P interacts with each of the 12 charges at distance 2 m. Each interaction energy is: U_single = k * (2e) * (2e) / 2 = k * 4e^2 / 2 = 2k e^2. Total energy due to interactions of the central charge with the 12 charges: U_center = 12 * 2k e^2 = 24 k e^2. Next, consider interactions among the 12 charges on the circle of radius 2 m. To minimize energy, the 12 charges will be evenly spaced on the circle. The distance between charges on a circle depends on the chord length: d = 2r sin(pi * n / 12), where n is the number of steps between charges (from 1 to 6, as beyond 6 is symmetric). The total potential energy among these 12 charges is sum over all pairs: U_ring = k * (2e)^2 * sum_{i&lt;j} 1 / r_ij = 4 k e^2 * sum_{i&lt;j} 1 / r_ij. Since the charges are evenly spaced, sum over pairs can be calculated using symmetry. The pairwise distances are d_n = 2 * 2 * sin(pi * n / 12) = 4 sin(pi n / 12). Number of pairs at distance d_n is 12 * n_pairs / 2 (since each pair counted once). Actually, for 12 charges, the number of pairs is 12*11/2=66. The sum over pairs can be expressed as sum_{n=1 to 6} (number of pairs at distance d_n) * 1/d_n. The number of pairs at distance d_n is 12 (each charge has one neighbor at distance d_n, total 12 such pairs). So total sum is sum_{n=1 to 6} 12 / d_n = 12 * sum_{n=1 to 6} 1 / (4 sin(pi n / 12)) = (12 / 4) * sum_{n=1 to 6} 1 / sin(pi n / 12) = 3 * sum_{n=1 to 6} 1 / sin(pi n / 12). Calculate sum_{n=1 to 6} 1 / sin(pi n / 12): n=1: sin(pi/12)=sin(15°)=0.2588 =&gt; 1/0.2588=3.8637 n=2: sin(30°)=0.5 =&gt; 2 n=3: sin(45°)=0.7071 =&gt; 1.4142 n=4: sin(60°)=0.8660 =&gt; 1.1547 n=5: sin(75°)=0.9659 =&gt; 1.0353 n=6: sin(90°)=1 =&gt; 1 Sum = 3.8637 + 2 + 1.4142 + 1.1547 + 1.0353 + 1 = 10.4679 Then U_ring = 4 k e^2 * 3 * 10.4679 = 12 k e^2 * 10.4679 = 125.615 k e^2. Total energy U_total = U_center + U_ring = 24 k e^2 + 125.615 k e^2 = 149.615 k e^2. Now plug in values: k = 8.99 x 10^9 Nm^2/C^2, e = 1.6 x 10^-19 C, e^2 = 2.56 x 10^-38 C^2. So U_total = 149.615 * 8.99 x 10^9 * 2.56 x 10^-38 = 149.615 * 8.99 * 2.56 x 10^-29. Calculate 8.99 * 2.56 = 23.0144. Then U_total = 149.615 * 23.0144 x 10^-29 = 3441.8 x 10^-29 = 3.4418 x 10^-26 J. Among the choices, 2.822 x 10^-26 and 5.645 x 10^-26 are close. Our value is closer to 2.822 x 10^-26. Considering approximations, the closest choice is 2.822 x 10^-26 J.
