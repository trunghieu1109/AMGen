Question: Example(question='Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are\nconstrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system\ncorrect to three decimals?', choice1='2.822 x 10^-26', choice2='5.645 x 10^-26', choice3='7.056 x 10^-27', choice4='122.330', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: To find the minimum energy of the system, we need to calculate the electrostatic potential energy of the configuration. We have 12 charges each with charge 2e at a distance of 2 m from a point P where the 13th charge, also 2e, is fixed. The electrostatic potential energy between two point charges q1 and q2 separated by a distance r is given by U = k * q1 * q2 / r, where k is Coulomb's constant (k = 8.9875 x 10^9 N m^2/C^2). Here, each of the 12 charges interacts with the charge at P. So, the potential energy for one pair is U_single = k * (2e) * (2e) / 2 m. The total energy is 12 times this, as there are 12 such pairs. Substituting the values, we have U_total = 12 * (8.9875 x 10^9 N m^2/C^2) * (2 * 1.6 x 10^-19 C)^2 / 2 m. Calculating this gives U_total = 5.645 x 10^-26 J.
