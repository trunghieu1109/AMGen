proposed answer: The Mott-Gurney equation describes the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) in a semiconductor device. It assumes a trap-free, single-carrier device with Ohmic contacts, meaning there is no injection barrier for carriers. Also, diffusion current is negligible compared to drift current. Therefore, the equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with Ohmic contacts and negligible diffusion current. Choice 1 mentions 'no carrier injection barrier' which is equivalent to Ohmic contact, and 'negligible diffusion current', so it fits the conditions. Choice 2 mentions negligible drift current, which contradicts the SCLC regime where drift current dominates. Choice 3 mentions two-carrier device, which is not the assumption in the Mott-Gurney equation. Choice 4 mentions Schottky contact, which introduces a barrier and is not valid for the Mott-Gurney equation. Hence, choice 1 is correct.
