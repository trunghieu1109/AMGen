proposed answer: First, normalize the state vector |ψ> = (-1, 2, 1). The norm is sqrt((-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(1 + 4 + 1) = sqrt(6). So the normalized state is |ψ> = (-1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6)).

The operator P is given by the matrix:
P = [[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0],
     [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)],
     [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]]

We want the probability that the measurement yields 0. This means we need the projection onto the eigenspace of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0.

Find eigenvalues of P:
Let’s denote a = 1/sqrt(2).

The matrix is:
[0, a, 0]
[a, 0, a]
[0, a, 0]

Solve det(P - λI) = 0:
| -λ, a, 0 |
| a, -λ, a |
| 0, a, -λ | = 0

Calculate determinant:
= -λ [(-λ)(-λ) - a^2] - a [a(-λ) - a*0] + 0
= -λ (λ^2 - a^2) - a ( -aλ )
= -λ^3 + λ a^2 + a^2 λ
= -λ^3 + 2 a^2 λ

Set equal to zero:
-λ^3 + 2 a^2 λ = 0
λ (-λ^2 + 2 a^2) = 0

So eigenvalues are λ = 0, and λ^2 = 2 a^2 = 2 * (1/2) =1, so λ = ±1.

Eigenvalues: -1, 0, 1.

Now find eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0:
Solve P v = 0.

From the first row:
a v_2 = 0 => v_2 = 0.
From second row:
a v_1 + a v_3 = 0 => v_1 = -v_3.
From third row:
a v_2 = 0 => already v_2 = 0.

So eigenvector for 0 eigenvalue is v = (1, 0, -1) up to normalization.

Normalize v:
Norm = sqrt(1^2 + 0 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2).
Normalized eigenvector |φ> = (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

Probability = |<φ|ψ>|^2.

Calculate inner product <φ|ψ>:
= (1/sqrt(2))*(-1/sqrt(6)) + 0*(2/sqrt(6)) + (-1/sqrt(2))*(1/sqrt(6))
= (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) + 0 - (1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6))
= -2 / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(6))

Simplify denominator:
sqrt(2)*sqrt(6) = sqrt(12) = 2*sqrt(3)

So <φ|ψ> = -2 / (2 sqrt(3)) = -1 / sqrt(3).

Probability = |<φ|ψ>|^2 = (1 / sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.

Thus, the probability that the measurement yields 0 is 1/3.
