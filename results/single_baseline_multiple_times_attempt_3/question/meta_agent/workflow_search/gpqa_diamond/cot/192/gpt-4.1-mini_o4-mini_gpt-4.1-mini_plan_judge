Question: Example(question='In a specific region of the sky, astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?', choice1='~ r^2', choice2='~ r^4', choice3='~ r^3', choice4='~ r^5', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: We know parallax plx=1/r, so N(plx) ∝1/plx^5 =r^5. To get N per unit r, multiply by |d(plx)/dr|=1/r^2, giving N(r) ∝r^5·(1/r^2)=r^3.
