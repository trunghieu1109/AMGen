Question: {'question': 'Astronomers are studying two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2. Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.', 'choice1': '~ 0.4', 'choice2': '~ 0.7', 'choice3': '~ 0.6\n', 'choice4': '~ 1.2'}\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent MasV', content='We need the total mass of each binary system, which for circular orbits is given by (M1+M2)∝P(v1+v2)^3 (with P in consistent units and velocities v in same units), since constants cancel when taking a ratio. For system_1: P1=2\u2009yr, v1+v2=10+5=15\u2009km/s; for system_2: P2=1\u2009yr, v1+v2=15+10=25\u2009km/s. Thus the mass ratio M1+2 / M2+2 = [2*(15)^3] / [1*(25)^3] = 2*3375 / 15625 = 6750/15625 ≈0.43 ≈0.4.\n\nAnswer:A)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
