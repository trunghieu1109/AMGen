Question: Example(question='Astronomers are studying two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2. Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.', choice1='~ 0.4', choice2='~ 0.7', choice3='~ 0.6\n', choice4='~ 1.2', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: To solve this problem, we need to use Kepler's third law and the information about radial velocity amplitudes. The period of system_1 is 2 years, and system_2 is 1 year. The radial velocity amplitudes give us information about the masses of the stars in each system. For system_1, the radial velocity amplitudes are 10 km/s and 5 km/s, and for system_2, they are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. The ratio of the total masses of the systems can be found using the formula for the mass function and Kepler's third law. The mass function is proportional to (K1 + K2)^3 / P, where K1 and K2 are the radial velocity amplitudes and P is the period. For system_1, (10 + 5)^3 / 2 = 3375 / 2 = 1687.5. For system_2, (15 + 10)^3 / 1 = 25^3 = 15625. The ratio of the masses is 1687.5 / 15625 = 0.108. This ratio does not match any of the given options, so let's reconsider the problem. The key is to compare the total mass using the radial velocities and periods. The period ratio is 2:1, and the velocity amplitude ratios are 15:10 and 10:5. The total mass ratio can be estimated by considering the cube of the velocity ratio times the inverse of the period ratio, which gives us (15/10)^3 / 2 = 1.5^3 / 2 = 3.375 / 2 = 1.6875. This suggests that the systems are approximately equal in mass, but system_1 is slightly less massive than system_2. The closest choice is ~0.6.
