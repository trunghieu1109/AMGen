    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Astronomers are studying two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2. Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;~ 0.4&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;~ 0.7&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;~ 0.6\n&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;~ 1.2&#39;}

    <pre>The orbital period (P) for system_1 is 2 years and for system_2 is 1 year. The total mass of a binary system (M) is related to the orbital period and the semi-major axis (a) by Kepler&#39;s third law: P^2 ∝ a^3 / M. Also, the radial velocity amplitudes (K1 and K2) relate to the masses through the mass function and the mass ratio. The ratio of masses can be found by comparing the parameters of the two systems. Given the radial velocity amplitudes for system_1 are 10 km/s and 5 km/s, the mass ratio M1/M2 = K2/K1 = 5/10 = 0.5 (mass of star 1 is twice mass of star 2). Similarly, for system_2, K1=15 km/s and K2=10 km/s, mass ratio M1/M2 = 10/15 = 2/3. The total mass M = M1 + M2. Using Kepler&#39;s third law, M_total ∝ a^3 / P^2. The radial velocity amplitudes relate to the orbital velocity and hence to the semi-major axis. The semi-major axis a can be derived from the velocity amplitudes and period. For circular orbits, a1 = K1 * P / (2π), a2 = K2 * P / (2π). Total semi-major axis a = a1 + a2 = (K1 + K2)*P/(2π). Therefore, total mass M ∝ a^3 / P^2 = ((K1 + K2)*P/(2π))^3 / P^2 = (K1 + K2)^3 * P / (2π)^3. So, the mass ratio M1/M2 of the systems is: M1/M2 = ((K1_1 + K2_1)^3 * P1) / ((K1_2 + K2_2)^3 * P2). Plugging in the values: For system_1: (10 + 5) = 15 km/s, P1 = 2 years. For system_2: (15 + 10) = 25 km/s, P2 = 1 year. M1/M2 = (15^3 * 2) / (25^3 * 1) = (3375 * 2) / (15625) = 6750 / 15625 ≈ 0.432. So system_1 is approximately 0.4 times as massive as system_2.
