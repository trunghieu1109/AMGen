Question: Example(question='In an inactive state, a transcription factor subunit awaits an activation signal from the membrane phosphorylation cascade. Upon phosphorylation on the Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, shuttles into the nucleus, and serves in gene transcription. A missense mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. You observe that a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Which of the following molecular phenotypes is most likely observed in the presence of mutation Y?', choice1='loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype', choice2='protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype', choice3='protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele', choice4='change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: Mutation Y is a dominant-negative mutation in the dimerization domain. Dominant-negative mutations typically result in a mutant protein that interferes with the function of the wild-type protein. In the context of a transcription factor that requires dimerization, a dominant-negative mutation in the dimerization domain would likely interfere with the dimerization process. This would prevent the formation of functional dimers, leading to a loss-of-function phenotype. Therefore, the most likely molecular phenotype would be protein aggregation or misfolding, preventing proper dimerization and leading to a loss-of-function phenotype.

proposed answer: Mutation Y is a heterozygous mutation in the dimerization domain that acts as a dominant-negative mutation. A dominant-negative mutation typically means that the mutant protein interferes with the function of the wild-type protein. Since Y is in the dimerization domain, it likely affects the ability of the protein to dimerize properly. This would lead to a loss-of-function phenotype because the mutant protein can still bind to the wild-type protein, preventing it from functioning correctly. The most likely molecular phenotype is protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype, as the mutant protein might cause improper dimerization or aggregation, leading to a loss of function.
