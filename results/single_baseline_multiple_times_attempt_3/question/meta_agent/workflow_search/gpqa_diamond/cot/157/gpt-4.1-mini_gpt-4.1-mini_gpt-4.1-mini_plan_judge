Question: Example(question='In an inactive state, a transcription factor subunit awaits an activation signal from the membrane phosphorylation cascade. Upon phosphorylation on the Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, shuttles into the nucleus, and serves in gene transcription. A missense mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. You observe that a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Which of the following molecular phenotypes is most likely observed in the presence of mutation Y?', choice1='loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype', choice2='protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype', choice3='protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele', choice4='change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The question describes a transcription factor that functions as a dimer. Mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation, meaning that one functional copy is enough for normal function. Mutation Y in the dimerization domain is dominant-negative, implying that the mutant protein interferes with the function of the wild-type protein. Dominant-negative mutations in dimerization domains usually cause the mutant protein to dimerize with the wild-type protein but render the dimer non-functional, leading to a loss-of-function phenotype despite the presence of a wild-type allele. This suggests that the mutant protein still dimerizes but the resulting dimers are non-functional, resulting in a dominant-negative effect. Therefore, the molecular phenotype is likely loss of function due to defective dimerization, not complete loss of dimerization or protein degradation. Among the choices, 'protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype' best fits the dominant-negative effect since mutant proteins often form non-functional aggregates with wild-type proteins, leading to loss of function. The other options either imply no effect (wild-type phenotype), gain-of-function, or degradation which is less likely for dominant-negative mutations in dimerization domains.
