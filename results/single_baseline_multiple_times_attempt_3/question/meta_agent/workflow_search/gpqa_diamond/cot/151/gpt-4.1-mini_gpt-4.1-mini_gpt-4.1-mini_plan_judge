Question: Example(question='You identified a new quorum-sensing peptide in the bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus. You are highly interested if its role in intercellular communication is conserved among the eukaryotes. You treat yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with the peptide and interestingly observe the formation of the shmoo. You want to learn about the proteome of the active chromatin in the shmoo and recover it by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. The least of proteins from which complex below will you observe in your assay?', choice1='pre-initiation complex', choice2='pre-replication complex', choice3='enhancer protein complex', choice4='nucleosome histone complex', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The question involves identifying which protein complex would be least observed in an assay targeting the proteome of active chromatin in the shmoo of yeast after treatment with a quorum-sensing peptide. Active chromatin is generally associated with transcriptionally active regions of DNA. The pre-initiation complex is involved in the initiation of transcription, so it would be present in active chromatin. The enhancer protein complex also plays a role in regulating transcription by enhancing the activity of promoters, so it would be present as well. The nucleosome histone complex is a fundamental component of chromatin structure, present throughout chromatin, including active regions. The pre-replication complex, however, is involved in DNA replication initiation during the S phase of the cell cycle and is not typically associated with active transcriptional chromatin. Since the assay targets active chromatin associated with transcriptional activity (shmoo formation is a response involving gene expression changes), the pre-replication complex proteins would be least observed.
