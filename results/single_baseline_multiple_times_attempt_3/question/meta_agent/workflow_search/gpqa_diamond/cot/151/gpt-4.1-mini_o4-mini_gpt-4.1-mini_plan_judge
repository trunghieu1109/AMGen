Question: Example(question='You identified a new quorum-sensing peptide in the bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus. You are highly interested if its role in intercellular communication is conserved among the eukaryotes. You treat yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with the peptide and interestingly observe the formation of the shmoo. You want to learn about the proteome of the active chromatin in the shmoo and recover it by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. The least of proteins from which complex below will you observe in your assay?', choice1='pre-initiation complex', choice2='pre-replication complex', choice3='enhancer protein complex', choice4='nucleosome histone complex', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The assay captures proteins bound to active chromatin (transcriptionally engaged regions in shmoo-forming yeast). We expect to see nucleosomes (histones), enhancer-binding factors, and components of the transcription pre-initiation complex at active promoters. The pre-replication complex, involved in origin licensing in preparation for DNA replication rather than transcription, will least associate with actively transcribed chromatin and thus be underrepresented in our ChIP–MS of active chromatin.
