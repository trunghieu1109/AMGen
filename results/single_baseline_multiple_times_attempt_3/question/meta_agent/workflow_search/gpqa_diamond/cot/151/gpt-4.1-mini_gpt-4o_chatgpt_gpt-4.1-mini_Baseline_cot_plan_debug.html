    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;You identified a new quorum-sensing peptide in the bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus. You are highly interested if its role in intercellular communication is conserved among the eukaryotes. You treat yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with the peptide and interestingly observe the formation of the shmoo.

    <pre>The task involves understanding which protein complex is least likely to be observed in an assay of active chromatin in yeast forming a shmoo. The shmoo is a projection formed during yeast mating, a process involving gene expression but not DNA replication. The pre-initiation complex is involved in transcription initiation, the enhancer protein complex is involved in transcription regulation, and the nucleosome histone complex is part of chromatin structure. The pre-replication complex is involved in DNA replication, which is not active during mating and shmoo formation. Therefore, the least likely complex to be observed is the pre-replication complex.
