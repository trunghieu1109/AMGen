Question: Example(question='We would like to dissolve (at 25°С) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm3 total volume. What is the minimum volume (cm3) of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution and what is the pH of the resulting solution?', choice1='pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3', choice2='pH 2.69; 30.09 cm3', choice3='pH 3.16; 32.14 cm3', choice4='pH 4.94; 20.40 cm3', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: Calculate moles Fe(OH)3: 0.1 g /106.85 g/mol = 9.36×10⁻⁴ mol. It consumes 3 H+ per mol: 2.808×10⁻³ mol H+. If V (L) of 0.1 M acid is added, moles H+ added =0.1·V. Remaining H+ =0.1V–2.808×10⁻³. Total volume =0.1 L, so [H+]=(0.1V–2.808×10⁻³)/0.1. Check choices: A) V=0.02805 L gives added H+ 2.805×10⁻³<2.808×10⁻³ insufficient. B) V=0.03009 L gives added 3.009×10⁻³, rem=2.01×10⁻⁴, [H+]=2.01×10⁻³ M, pH=2.70≈2.69. C and D don’t match. Thus answer is B).
