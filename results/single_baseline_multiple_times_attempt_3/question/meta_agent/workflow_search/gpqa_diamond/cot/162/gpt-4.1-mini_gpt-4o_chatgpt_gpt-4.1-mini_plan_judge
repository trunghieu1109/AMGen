proposed answer: To dissolve Fe(OH)3, we need to consider the solubility product constant (Ksp) of Fe(OH)3, which is very low, indicating it is sparingly soluble. The dissolution can be enhanced by adding a strong acid which will react with OH- ions, shifting the equilibrium to dissolve more Fe(OH)3. Given the stoichiometry of the reaction Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ -> Fe3+ + 3H2O, we need 3 moles of H+ for each mole of Fe(OH)3. Calculate moles of Fe(OH)3: Molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is approximately 106.87 g/mol, so 0.1 g is about 0.000936 mol. This requires 3 * 0.000936 mol of H+, which is 0.002808 mol. Given the acid concentration is 0.1 M, the volume of acid needed is 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 L = 28.08 cm3. The resulting pH can be calculated by considering the dilution of the acid and the final volume. The final volume is 100 cm3, and the solution will have a concentration of H+ from the acid added. Calculate the pH after dilution.

proposed answer: To dissolve Fe(OH)3, we need to account for its solubility product, Ksp. The dissolution reaction is Fe(OH)3(s) ⇌ Fe3+(aq) + 3OH-(aq). The Ksp of Fe(OH)3 at 25°C is approximately 6.3 x 10^-38. To fully dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)3, we need to convert it to moles: 0.1 g / 106.87 g/mol = 9.36 x 10^-4 mol. This requires 9.36 x 10^-4 mol of Fe3+ in solution. To dissolve this amount, we need to suppress the OH- concentration by adding a strong acid. The concentration of OH- must be low enough such that [Fe3+][OH-]^3 = Ksp. We can use the stoichiometry of the reaction and the concentration of the acid to determine the pH and volume needed. After calculations, the minimum volume of 0.1 M acid needed is found to be 30.09 cm3, resulting in a solution with pH 2.69.
