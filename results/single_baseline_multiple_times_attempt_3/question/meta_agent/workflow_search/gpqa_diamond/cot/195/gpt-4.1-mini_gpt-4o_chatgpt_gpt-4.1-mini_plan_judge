proposed answer: To find the maximum speed of a relativistic harmonic oscillator, we need to consider the relativistic energy-momentum relation. The total energy E of the system is given by E = T + V, where T is the kinetic energy and V is the potential energy. For a relativistic particle, the kinetic energy is given by T = ( - 1)mc^2, where  is the Lorentz factor  = 1/(1 - v^2/c^2). The potential energy for a harmonic oscillator is V = (1/2)kx^2. At maximum amplitude A, all the energy is potential, so E = (1/2)kA^2. At maximum speed, all the energy is kinetic, so E = ( - 1)mc^2. Setting these equal gives ( - 1)mc^2 = (1/2)kA^2. Solving for  gives  = 1 + kA^2/(2mc^2). The Lorentz factor  is related to the speed by  = 1/(1 - v^2/c^2), so 1/(1 - v^2/c^2) = 1 + kA^2/(2mc^2). Solving for v^2/c^2 gives v^2/c^2 = 1 - 1/(1 + kA^2/(2mc^2))^2. Therefore, v_max = c(1 - 1/(1 + kA^2/(2mc^2))^2). This corresponds to choice B.
