Question: Example(question='You are studying a nuclear decay which converts two heavy nucleons of flavor A to another flavor B, while simultaneously emitting two much lighter particles E and V. In short, 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V. It is known that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous, with some endpoint value Q.\n\nA variant of this decay emits one exotic, massless particle M instead of the 2V. In this case, how does the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles compare to that of the original decay?', choice1='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint increases.', choice2='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases.', choice3='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.', choice4='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint decreases.', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: In the original decay 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V, the energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous because the energy is shared among the particles E and V, with V being neutrinos which can take a range of energies, leading to a continuous spectrum up to the endpoint Q. In the variant decay 2A -> 2B + 2E + M, the massless particle M takes a fixed amount of energy, leaving the remaining energy to be shared between the two E particles. This still results in a continuous spectrum for the E particles, but the maximum energy available for the E particles is larger since M is massless and less energy is carried away compared to two neutrinos. Therefore, the spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.
