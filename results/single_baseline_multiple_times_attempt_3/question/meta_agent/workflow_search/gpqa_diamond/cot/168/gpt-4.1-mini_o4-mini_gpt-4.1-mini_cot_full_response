Question: {'question': 'You are studying a nuclear decay which converts two heavy nucleons of flavor A to another flavor B, while simultaneously emitting two much lighter particles E and V. In short, 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V. It is known that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous, with some endpoint value Q.\n\nA variant of this decay emits one exotic, massless particle M instead of the 2V. In this case, how does the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles compare to that of the original decay?', 'choice1': 'The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint increases.', 'choice2': 'The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases.', 'choice3': 'The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.', 'choice4': 'The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint decreases.'}\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent Kygp', content='The original four-body decay (2E+2V) gives a continuous electron spectrum up to Q. Replacing the two neutrinos with one massless exotic still leaves a three-body final state (2E+M), so the sum‐electron spectrum remains continuous but with a different shape. Since the exotic is massless, the maximum electron energy now reaches the full Q (whereas with two neutrinos the endpoint is slightly reduced by their nonzero masses), so the endpoint increases relative to the original.\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
