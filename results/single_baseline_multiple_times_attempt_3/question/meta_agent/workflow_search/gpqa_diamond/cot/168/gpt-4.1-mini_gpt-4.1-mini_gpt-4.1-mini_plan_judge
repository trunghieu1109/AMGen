Question: Example(question='You are studying a nuclear decay which converts two heavy nucleons of flavor A to another flavor B, while simultaneously emitting two much lighter particles E and V. In short, 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V. It is known that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous, with some endpoint value Q.\n\nA variant of this decay emits one exotic, massless particle M instead of the 2V. In this case, how does the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles compare to that of the original decay?', choice1='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint increases.', choice2='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases.', choice3='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.', choice4='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint decreases.', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: In the original decay, 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V, the presence of multiple light particles (E and V) sharing the available energy results in a continuous energy spectrum for the E particles, with an endpoint Q. When the decay variant emits one exotic, massless particle M instead of the 2V, the total number of particles sharing the energy changes, but since M is massless and only one particle replaces two V particles, the energy distribution among the E particles will still be continuous but altered. Because fewer particles are sharing the energy (only one M instead of two V), the maximum possible energy carried by the E particles can increase, shifting the endpoint higher. The spectrum remains continuous because the energy can still be shared in various ways between the E particles and the single M particle.
