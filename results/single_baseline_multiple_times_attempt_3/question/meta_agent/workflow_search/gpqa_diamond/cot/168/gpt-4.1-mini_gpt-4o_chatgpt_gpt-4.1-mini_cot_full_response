Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent Kygp', content='In the original decay 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V, the energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous because the energy is shared among the particles E and V, with V being neutrinos which can take a range of energies, leading to a continuous spectrum up to the endpoint Q. In the variant decay 2A -> 2B + 2E + M, the massless particle M takes a fixed amount of energy, leaving the remaining energy to be shared between the two E particles. This still results in a continuous spectrum for the E particles, but the maximum energy available for the E particles is larger since M is massless and less energy is carried away compared to two neutrinos. Therefore, the spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
