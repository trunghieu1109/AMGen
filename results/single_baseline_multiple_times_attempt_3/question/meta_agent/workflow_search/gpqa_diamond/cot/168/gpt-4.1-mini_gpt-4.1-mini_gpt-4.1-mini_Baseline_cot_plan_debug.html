    <pre>In the original decay, 2A -&gt; 2B + 2E + 2V, the presence of multiple light particles (E and V) sharing the available energy results in a continuous energy spectrum for the E particles, with an endpoint Q. When the decay variant emits one exotic, massless particle M instead of the 2V, the total number of particles sharing the energy changes, but since M is massless and only one particle replaces two V particles, the energy distribution among the E particles will still be continuous but altered. Because fewer particles are sharing the energy (only one M instead of two V), the maximum possible energy carried by the E particles can increase, shifting the endpoint higher. The spectrum remains continuous because the energy can still be shared in various ways between the E particles and the single M particle.
