Question: Example(question='What is the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product obtained when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess of HI?', choice1='1', choice2='3', choice3='0', choice4='5', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The given compound is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. The reaction with red phosphorus and excess HI typically reduces aldehyde and carboxylic acid groups to alkyl groups, and also removes double bonds if possible by hydrogenation or reduction. The original compound has a cyclohexene ring (one double bond) plus an aldehyde and a carboxylic acid group. The index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) or degree of unsaturation is calculated as: IHD = (2C + 2 - H + N - X)/2. Initially, the compound has 1 double bond in the ring and 2 carbonyl groups (aldehyde and carboxylic acid), each contributing one degree of unsaturation. So initial IHD is 3. After reaction with red phosphorus and excess HI, aldehyde and carboxylic acid groups are reduced to alkyl groups (removing 2 IHD), and the double bond might remain or be reduced. Usually, the double bond in the ring remains, so one double bond remains, so IHD = 1. Therefore, the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.
