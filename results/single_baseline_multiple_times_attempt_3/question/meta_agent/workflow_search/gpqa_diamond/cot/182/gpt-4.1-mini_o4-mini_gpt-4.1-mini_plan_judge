Question: Example(question='What is the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product obtained when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess of HI?', choice1='1', choice2='3', choice3='0', choice4='5', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: Red P/HI reduces COOH to CH3 substituent, CHO to CH3, and hydrogenates C=C and vinyl. Starting material becomes fully saturated cyclohexane ring with methyls at C1 and C2 and ethyl at C5 (1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane). Only unsaturation is the ring (IHD=1).
