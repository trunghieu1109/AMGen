Question: Example(question='Calculate the amount of non-Gaussianity(nG) in the Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy measure. The state is defined as,\n|psi> =( cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> )/ N;\nHere, alpha is the amplitude, phi is the phase and N is the normalisation constant.\nN = sqrt(1+ sin(2*phi)*exp(-2*alpha^2)).\nThe relative entropy measure is given as,\ndel_b = [trace(rho* ln(rho))-trace(tau* ln(tau))]\nwhere tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state and rho is the density matrix of the above non-Gaussian state.\nCalculate the nG for phi =-pi /4 and alpha= 0.5.', choice1='2.48', choice2='0', choice3='1.38', choice4='0.25', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: We need the relative entropy measure δ=Tr(ρ lnρ)–Tr(τ lnτ)=S(τ)–S(ρ). For the pure odd cat (φ=−π/4, α=0.5) S(ρ)=0. Compute the Gaussian reference τ with the same first/second moments: its symplectic eigenvalue ν=√(Var(X)Var(P))=√(0.75·0.5)=0.612. Then S(τ)=(ν+½)ln(ν+½)−(ν−½)ln(ν−½)≈0.36 nats, nearest choice is 0.25.
