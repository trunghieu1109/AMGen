proposed answer: The Schrödinger cat state is given by |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N, where N = sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi)*exp(-2*alpha^2)). For phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5, we first calculate N. sin(2*phi) = sin(-pi/2) = -1, and exp(-2*alpha^2) = exp(-2*0.25) = exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065. Thus, N = sqrt(1 - 1 * 0.6065) = sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275. The state is a superposition with normalization constant approximately 0.6275. The relative entropy of non-Gaussianity (nG) is defined as del_b = Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau), where tau is the Gaussian reference state closest to rho. For phi = -pi/4, the state reduces to an equal superposition with a negative sign, which is known to be a non-Gaussian state with a small amplitude alpha=0.5. The relative entropy measure of non-Gaussianity for such a small amplitude cat state is known to be close to zero because the state is almost Gaussian. Therefore, among the given options, the value 0 (choice2) is the most reasonable answer for nG at phi = -pi/4 and alpha=0.5.
