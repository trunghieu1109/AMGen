Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent Vr9h', content='We need the relative entropy measure δ=Tr(ρ lnρ)–Tr(τ lnτ)=S(τ)–S(ρ). For the pure odd cat (φ=−π/4, α=0.5) S(ρ)=0. Compute the Gaussian reference τ with the same first/second moments: its symplectic eigenvalue ν=√(Var(X)Var(P))=√(0.75·0.5)=0.612. Then S(τ)=(ν+½)ln(ν+½)−(ν−½)ln(ν−½)≈0.36\u2009nats, nearest choice is 0.25.\n\nAnswer:D', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
