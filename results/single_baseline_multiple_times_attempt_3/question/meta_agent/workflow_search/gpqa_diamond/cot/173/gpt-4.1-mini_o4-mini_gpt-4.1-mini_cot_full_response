Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent MGzN', content='We have a nucleus at rest with rest mass M (300 GeV) which fissions into two fragments of rest masses m and 2m such that 3m=0.99M, so m≈0.33M (99 GeV). The mass defect ΔM=0.01M gives Q=3 GeV total kinetic energy. In the CM frame, the two momenta are equal (|p|), and relativistic energy conservation gives: √(4m²c⁴+p²c²)+√(m²c⁴+p²c²) =3m c²+Q. Expanding for small p (since Q≪m), one finds p²≈0.0404 m²c². The exact kinetic energy of the heavier fragment (mass 2m) is T₁_exact=√(4m²c⁴+p²c²)−2m c²≈0.01008m c²≈0.998 GeV. The non‐relativistic approximation gives T₁_classical=p²/(2·2m)=0.01010m c²≈1.000 GeV. Their difference ≃2 MeV.\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
