Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent MGzN', content='The initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus is 300 GeV. After fission, the rest-mass energy is 99% of the initial, so the rest-mass energy of the fragments is 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV. The energy released in the fission process is 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV. Let the rest mass of the lighter fragment be m, then the rest mass of the heavier fragment is 2m. The sum of their rest masses is 3m = 0.99M, so m = 0.33M. The heavier fragment has rest mass 2m = 0.66M. The kinetic energy is shared between the fragments, and the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV. In the center of mass frame, momentum is conserved, and the velocities are such that the momentum of the heavier fragment is equal and opposite to the momentum of the lighter fragment. Using the relativistic energy-momentum relation, the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment can be calculated. Classically, the kinetic energy would be calculated using T = (1/2)mv^2. The difference between the relativistic and classical kinetic energies is the answer we are looking for.\n\nAnswer:A)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
