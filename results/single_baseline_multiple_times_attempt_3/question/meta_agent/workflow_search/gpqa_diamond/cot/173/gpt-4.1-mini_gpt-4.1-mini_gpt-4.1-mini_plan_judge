proposed answer: Let the initial nucleus have mass M and rest energy 300 GeV. After fission, it splits into two fragments with rest masses m1 and m2 such that m1 = 2m2 and m1 + m2 = 0.99M.

From m1 = 2m2, we have m1 + m2 = 3m2 = 0.99M, so m2 = 0.33M and m1 = 0.66M.

Since the initial nucleus is at rest, momentum conservation implies the two fragments have equal and opposite momenta: p1 = -p2.

Using relativistic energy-momentum relation:
E_i^2 = (m_i c^2)^2 + (p c)^2

The total energy before fission is E = M c^2 = 300 GeV.

The sum of rest masses after fission is 0.99M, so the mass defect is 0.01M, which converts to kinetic energy of the fragments (total kinetic energy T_total = 0.01M c^2 = 3 GeV).

Let the kinetic energies be T1 and T2 for masses m1 and m2, respectively.

From momentum conservation: p1 = p2, so their momenta have the same magnitude p.

Relativistic kinetic energy for each fragment:
T_i = sqrt((m_i c^2)^2 + (p c)^2) - m_i c^2

We want to find T1 (more massive fragment) and compare it with classical kinetic energy approximation:
Classical kinetic energy: T1_classical = p^2/(2 m1)

Calculate p from total kinetic energy:
Total energy after fission = E1 + E2 = 300 GeV

E1 = sqrt((0.66M c^2)^2 + (p c)^2)
E2 = sqrt((0.33M c^2)^2 + (p c)^2)

Sum E1 + E2 = 300 GeV

Solve for p c:
Let x = p c

E1 = sqrt((0.66 * 300)^2 + x^2) = sqrt( (198)^2 + x^2 )
E2 = sqrt((0.33 * 300)^2 + x^2) = sqrt( (99)^2 + x^2 )

E1 + E2 = 300

Try to solve for x numerically:
At x=0, E1 + E2 = 198 + 99 = 297 < 300
At x=30 GeV, E1 = sqrt(198^2 + 30^2) ≈ sqrt(39204 + 900) = sqrt(40104) ≈ 200.26
E2 = sqrt(99^2 + 30^2) = sqrt(9801 + 900) = sqrt(10701) ≈ 103.44
Sum ≈ 303.7 > 300

So p c is between 0 and 30 GeV.
Try x=20 GeV:
E1 ≈ sqrt(39204 + 400) = sqrt(39604) ≈ 198.99
E2 ≈ sqrt(9801 + 400) = sqrt(10201) ≈ 101.0
Sum = 299.99 ≈ 300 GeV

So p c ≈ 20 GeV.

Now kinetic energies:
T1 = E1 - m1 c^2 = 198.99 - 198 = 0.99 GeV = 990 MeV
T2 = 101.0 - 99 = 2.0 MeV

Check total kinetic energy: 0.99 GeV + 2.0 MeV = 992 MeV (close to 1% of 300 GeV = 3 GeV, seems inconsistent, re-check calculations).

Re-examine the total kinetic energy:
Initial rest energy = 300 GeV
Final rest masses sum = 0.99 M = 0.99 * 300 = 297 GeV
Difference = 3 GeV is the total kinetic energy.

But above calculation gives T1 ~ 0.99 GeV, T2 ~ 2 MeV, total ~ 0.992 GeV, which is less than 3 GeV.

Try x=30 GeV:
E1 = 200.26 GeV
T1 = 200.26 - 198 = 2.26 GeV
E2 = 103.44 GeV
T2 = 103.44 - 99 = 4.44 GeV
Sum T = 6.7 GeV > 3 GeV

Try x=25 GeV:
E1 = sqrt(198^2 + 25^2) = sqrt(39204 + 625) = sqrt(39829) ≈ 199.57 GeV
T1 = 1.57 GeV
E2 = sqrt(99^2 + 25^2) = sqrt(9801 + 625) = sqrt(10426) ≈ 102.1 GeV
T2 = 3.1 GeV
Sum T = 4.68 GeV > 3 GeV

Try x=22 GeV:
E1 ≈ sqrt(39204 + 484) = sqrt(39688) ≈ 199.22 GeV
T1 = 1.22 GeV
E2 ≈ sqrt(9801 + 484) = sqrt(10285) ≈ 101.4 GeV
T2 = 2.4 GeV
Sum T = 3.62 GeV > 3 GeV

Try x=21 GeV:
E1 ≈ sqrt(39204 + 441) = sqrt(39645) ≈ 199.1 GeV
T1 = 1.1 GeV
E2 ≈ sqrt(9801 + 441) = sqrt(10242) ≈ 101.2 GeV
T2 = 2.2 GeV
Sum T = 3.3 GeV > 3 GeV

Try x=20.5 GeV:
E1 ≈ sqrt(39204 + 420) = sqrt(39624) ≈ 199.05 GeV
T1 = 1.05 GeV
E2 ≈ sqrt(9801 + 420) = sqrt(10221) ≈ 101.1 GeV
T2 = 2.1 GeV
Sum T = 3.15 GeV > 3 GeV

Try x=20.2 GeV:
E1 ≈ sqrt(39204 + 408) = sqrt(39612) ≈ 199.02 GeV
T1 = 1.02 GeV
E2 ≈ sqrt(9801 + 408) = sqrt(10198) ≈ 101.0 GeV
T2 = 2.0 GeV
Sum T = 3.02 GeV ~ 3 GeV

So p c ≈ 20.2 GeV

Now calculate classical kinetic energy for the more massive fragment:
T1_classical = p^2 / (2 m1)

p = 20.2 GeV / c
m1 c^2 = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV

T1_classical = (20.2)^2 / (2 * 198) GeV = 408.04 / 396 = 1.03 GeV = 1030 MeV

Relativistic T1 = 1.02 GeV = 1020 MeV
Difference = 1030 - 1020 = 10 MeV

Therefore, the difference between the classical and relativistic kinetic energy for the more massive fragment is about 10 MeV.

The correct choice is 10 MeV.
