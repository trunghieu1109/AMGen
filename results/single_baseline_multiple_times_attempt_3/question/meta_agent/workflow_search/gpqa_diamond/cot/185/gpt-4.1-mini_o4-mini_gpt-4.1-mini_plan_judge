Question: Example(question='Identify the possible product when (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene undergoes Cope rearrangement.', choice1='4,4a,7,7a-tetrahydro-1H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine', choice2='4,4a,5,7a-tetrahydro-3H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine', choice3='4,6,7,7a-tetrahydro-3H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine', choice4='4,4a,5,6-tetrahydro-1H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: We consider the 3,3‐sigmatropic aza‐Cope between the N-vinyl and the norbornene endo‐alkene, which gives the enamine tautomer of a cyclopenta[c]pyridine bearing a C2–C3 and a C6–C7 double bond.  In the enamine product (3H tautomer) the sp3 centers are at C4, C4a, C5 and C7a, i.e. 4,4a,5,7a‐tetrahydro‐3H‐cyclopenta[c]pyridine, which is choice B.

Answer:B)
