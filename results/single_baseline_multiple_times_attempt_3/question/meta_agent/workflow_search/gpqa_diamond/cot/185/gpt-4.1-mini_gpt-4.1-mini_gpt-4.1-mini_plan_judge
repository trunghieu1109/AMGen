Question: Example(question='Identify the possible product when (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene undergoes Cope rearrangement.', choice1='4,4a,7,7a-tetrahydro-1H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine', choice2='4,4a,5,7a-tetrahydro-3H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine', choice3='4,6,7,7a-tetrahydro-3H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine', choice4='4,4a,5,6-tetrahydro-1H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The Cope rearrangement is a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement that typically involves 1,5-dienes. The given compound is (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene, which contains a bicyclic system with a vinyl group and a nitrogen atom. Upon undergoing Cope rearrangement, the positions of the double bonds and the ring structure will change, leading to a cyclopenta[c]pyridine derivative. The nomenclature of the product depends on which bonds shift and how the ring saturations change. Based on known Cope rearrangements of similar azabicyclic systems, the product is typically 4,4a,5,7a-tetrahydro-3H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine, corresponding to choice 2.
