    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1), and the operators of two observables P and Q of the system are represented by two square matrices. The matrix corresponding to operator P has the elements in first row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0), elements in the second row as (1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}) and that in third row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0). The matrix operator for Q is represented by the square matrix having elements in the first row as (1, 0, 0), second row as (0, 0, 0) and third row as (0, 0, -1). Now, if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P, what is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements?&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;1/2&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;1/6&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;1/3&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;2/3&#39;}

    <pre>Normalize initial state psi = (-1,2,1)/√6. Operator P has eigenvalue 0 eigenvector (1,0,-1)/√2, so P=0 probability = |⟨ψ0|ψ⟩|^2 = (1/3). Post‐P0 state is ψ0. Then Q measurement: probability of Q=−1 (state e3) = |⟨e3|ψ0⟩|^2 = 1/2. Joint probability = 1/3×1/2 = 1/6.
