Question: Example(question='The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1), and the operators of two observables P and Q of the system are represented by two square matrices. The matrix corresponding to operator P has the elements in first row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0), elements in the second row as (1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}) and that in third row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0). The matrix operator for Q is represented by the square matrix having elements in the first row as (1, 0, 0), second row as (0, 0, 0) and third row as (0, 0, -1). Now, if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P, what is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements?', choice1='1/2', choice2='1/6', choice3='1/3', choice4='2/3', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: Step 1: Identify the given state vector |ψ⟩ = (-1, 2, 1). Step 2: Operator P is given by the matrix P = [[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]. Step 3: Operator Q is given by the matrix Q = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -1]]. Step 4: We want the probability of measuring 0 for P and then -1 for Q. Step 5: Find eigenvectors of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0. Solve P|φ⟩ = 0|φ⟩. Step 6: Solving (P - 0I)|φ⟩ = 0, we get the system: (1/√2)φ2 = 0, (1/√2)φ1 + (1/√2)φ3 = 0, (1/√2)φ2 = 0. From first and third equations, φ2=0. From second, φ1 = -φ3. So eigenvector for eigenvalue 0 is |φ⟩ = (1, 0, -1) up to normalization. Step 7: Normalize |φ⟩: norm = sqrt(1^2 + 0 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2), so |φ⟩ = (1/√2, 0, -1/√2). Step 8: Probability of measuring 0 for P is |⟨φ|ψ⟩|^2. Compute ⟨φ|ψ⟩ = (1/√2)(-1) + 0*2 + (-1/√2)(1) = (-1/√2) - (1/√2) = -2/√2 = -√2. Step 9: Probability = | -√2 |^2 = (√2)^2 = 2. But this is >1, so we must normalize |ψ⟩ first. Step 10: Normalize |ψ⟩: norm = sqrt((-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(1 + 4 + 1) = sqrt(6). So normalized |ψ⟩ = (-1/√6, 2/√6, 1/√6). Step 11: Recalculate ⟨φ|ψ⟩ = (1/√2)(-1/√6) + 0 + (-1/√2)(1/√6) = (-1/(√2√6)) - (1/(√2√6)) = -2/(√2√6) = -2/√12 = -2/(2√3) = -1/√3. Step 12: Probability of measuring 0 for P is |⟨φ|ψ⟩|^2 = (1/√3)^2 = 1/3. Step 13: After measuring 0 for P, the state collapses to |φ⟩ = (1/√2, 0, -1/√2). Step 14: Now measure Q. Q has eigenvalues 1, 0, -1 with eigenvectors |e1⟩ = (1,0,0), |e2⟩ = (0,1,0), and |e3⟩ = (0,0,1). Step 15: Probability of measuring -1 for Q is |⟨e3|φ⟩|^2 = |(0,0,1) · (1/√2, 0, -1/√2)|^2 = |-1/√2|^2 = 1/2. Step 16: The total probability is the product of the two measurement probabilities: (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.
