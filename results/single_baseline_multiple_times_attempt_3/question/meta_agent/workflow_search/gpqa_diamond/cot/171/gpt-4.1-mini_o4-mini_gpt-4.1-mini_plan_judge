Question: Example(question='Two stars are being studied. It has been observed that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2. In fact, the energy difference between the considered energy levels was determined to be approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J. Assuming that the stellar photospheres are in LTE, which of these equations for the effective temperatures of the stars (T_1 and T_2) is correct?', choice1='ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]\n', choice2='ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]\n', choice3='ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n', choice4='ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: Under LTE the excited‐level population follows a Boltzmann factor ∝e^{–ΔE/(kT)}. The ratio of populations between stars gives e^{–ΔE/(kT1)}/e^{–ΔE/(kT2)}=2 ⇒ –ΔE/k(1/T1–1/T2)=ln2 ⇒ ln2=(ΔE/k)(1/T2–1/T1). Noting 1/T2–1/T1=(T1–T2)/(T1T2), the correct relation matches choice D.
