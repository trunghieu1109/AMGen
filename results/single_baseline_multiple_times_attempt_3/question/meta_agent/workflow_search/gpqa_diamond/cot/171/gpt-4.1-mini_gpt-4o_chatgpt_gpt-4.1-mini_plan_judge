Question: Example(question='Two stars are being studied. It has been observed that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2. In fact, the energy difference between the considered energy levels was determined to be approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J. Assuming that the stellar photospheres are in LTE, which of these equations for the effective temperatures of the stars (T_1 and T_2) is correct?', choice1='ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]\n', choice2='ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]\n', choice3='ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n', choice4='ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: The problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2, which implies a difference in population levels according to the Boltzmann distribution. The Boltzmann factor for a population ratio is given by exp(-ΔE/kT), where ΔE is the energy difference and T is the temperature. The ratio of the populations (N1/N2) is given by exp(-ΔE/kT_2) / exp(-ΔE/kT_1) = exp(ΔE(1/T_2 - 1/T_1)). Given that N1/N2 = 2, we have 2 = exp(ΔE(1/T_2 - 1/T_1)). Taking the natural logarithm of both sides gives ln(2) = ΔE(1/T_2 - 1/T_1). Therefore, the correct equation relating T_1 and T_2 should match this form. The only choice that matches this form is D) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)].
