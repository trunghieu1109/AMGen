Question: Example(question='Two stars are being studied. It has been observed that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2. In fact, the energy difference between the considered energy levels was determined to be approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J. Assuming that the stellar photospheres are in LTE, which of these equations for the effective temperatures of the stars (T_1 and T_2) is correct?', choice1='ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]\n', choice2='ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]\n', choice3='ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n', choice4='ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: The excitation of atoms in a specific energy level in LTE follows the Boltzmann distribution: n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE / (kT)), where ΔE is the energy difference between levels, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature. Given that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in that energy level compared to star_2, we have n2_1 / n2_2 = 2. Assuming the degeneracy factors (g2/g1) are the same for both stars, the ratio of populations is governed by the exponential term. So, 2 = exp(-ΔE / (kT1)) / exp(-ΔE / (kT2)) = exp[ΔE / k * (1/T2 - 1/T1)]. Taking natural logs, ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1). Rearranging, ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (T1 - T2) / (T1*T2). Since ΔE/k is a constant, the general form is ln(2) proportional to (T1 - T2)/(T1*T2). Among the options, choice4 matches this form: ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1*T2).
