Question: Example(question='Imagine an operator $\\vec{P}$ of a system have components $P_x, P_y$ and $P_z$. The matrix form of the  operator $P_x$ has components in the first row as $(0, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,\\hbar/\\sqrt{2},0)$.  The matrix form of the  operator $P_y$ has components in the first row as $(0, -i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0, -i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2},0)$. Similarly, matrix form of the  operator $P_z$ has components in the first row as $(\\hbar, 0, 0)$, that in the second row as $(0, 0, 0)$ and that in the third row as $(0,0, -\\hbar)$. The basis vectors here are the eigenvectors of $P_z$. The system is found in the eigenstate of $P_x$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$. To be more specific, the explicit form of the state of the system is given by the column vector having elements $(-1/2, 1/\\sqrt{2}, -1/2)$. What is the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z $ of $P_z$', choice1='\\hbar\n', choice2='\\hbar/2', choice3='\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}\n', choice4='\\sqrt{2}\\hbar', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: The state vector is given as |psi> = (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2), which is an eigenstate of Px with eigenvalue -ħ. We need to find the uncertainty ΔPz in this state. The operator Pz is diagonal with eigenvalues ħ, 0, and -ħ corresponding to the basis vectors. First, calculate the expectation value <Pz> = <psi|Pz|psi> = sum_i |psi_i|^2 * eigenvalue_i = (1/4)*ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ) = (1/4)ħ - (1/4)ħ = 0. Next, calculate <Pz^2> = sum_i |psi_i|^2 * (eigenvalue_i)^2 = (1/4)*ħ^2 + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*ħ^2 = (1/4 + 1/4)ħ^2 = (1/2)ħ^2. Then, the variance (ΔPz)^2 = <Pz^2> - <Pz>^2 = (1/2)ħ^2 - 0 = (1/2)ħ^2. Therefore, ΔPz = sqrt(1/2) ħ = ħ / sqrt(2).
