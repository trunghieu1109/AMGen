Question: {'question': 'Consider an aperture, which shapes like a N-sided polygon. All the apothems are of the same length a. When a monochromatic light (of wavelength \\lambda), travelling along z-axis, falls vertically on this aperture, it creates a series of intensity maxima and minima in the far field region. What is the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large ? Assume that the related angles are small so that tan theta = theta approximation can be taken.', 'choice1': '1.220 \\lambda /a ', 'choice2': '0.610 \\lambda / a', 'choice3': '0.500 \\lambda / a', 'choice4': '0.506 \\lambda / a'}\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent QXBy', content='For N → ∞ the aperture becomes circular with diameter D = 2a. The minima occur at angles given by zeros of J1: θ_n ≈ x_n λ/(πD). The first two zeros x1≈3.832, x2≈7.016. Thus their angular difference Δθ = (x2 – x1) λ/(πD) = (7.016–3.832)λ/(2πa) ≈ 0.506λ/a.\n\nAnswer:D)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
