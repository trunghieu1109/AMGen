Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent ScY8', content='The original decay 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V involves two light particles E and two light particles V, with the total energy spectrum of the E particles being continuous due to the distribution of energy among multiple particles. When replacing the two V particles with one massless exotic particle M, the number of emitted particles decreases, but the total available energy Q remains the same. Since M is massless, it can carry away varying amounts of energy, allowing the energy spectrum of E to remain continuous. However, with fewer particles sharing the energy, the shape of the spectrum will adjust, and the endpoint energy of the E particles can increase because less energy is partitioned among particles. Therefore, the spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
