Question: Example(question='You are studying a nuclear decay which converts two heavy nucleons of flavor A to another flavor B, while simultaneously emitting two much lighter particles E and V. In short, 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V. It is known that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous, with some endpoint value Q.\n\nA variant of this decay emits one exotic, massless particle M instead of the 2V. In this case, how does the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles compare to that of the original decay?', choice1='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint increases.', choice2='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases.', choice3='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.', choice4='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint decreases.', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: In the original decay 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V, the energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous because the neutrinos V carry away variable amounts of energy, allowing the Es to have a range of energies up to an endpoint value Q. In the variant decay, 2A -> 2B + 2E + M, the massless particle M takes away a fixed amount of energy since it is massless and there is only one of it. This means the remaining energy is distributed between the two E particles in a way that is not fixed, but the total energy available to them is less than in the original decay, as M takes some of the energy that would have gone to the neutrinos. Therefore, the spectrum remains continuous, but the endpoint is lower because M takes away a fixed amount of energy.
