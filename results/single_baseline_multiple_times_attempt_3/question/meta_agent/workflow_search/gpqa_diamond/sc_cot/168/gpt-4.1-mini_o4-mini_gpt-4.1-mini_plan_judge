Question: Example(question='You are studying a nuclear decay which converts two heavy nucleons of flavor A to another flavor B, while simultaneously emitting two much lighter particles E and V. In short, 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V. It is known that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous, with some endpoint value Q.\n\nA variant of this decay emits one exotic, massless particle M instead of the 2V. In this case, how does the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles compare to that of the original decay?', choice1='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint increases.', choice2='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases.', choice3='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.', choice4='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint decreases.', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The original 2β decay (2A→2B+2E+2V) has a three‐body final state (two electrons + nucleus) plus two neutrinos, so the summed electron energy spectrum is continuous up to endpoint Q (when the neutrinos take zero energy). Replacing the two neutrinos with a single massless Majoron (M) still leaves a three‐body final state (2E + M), so the summed electron energy spectrum remains continuous. There’s no new mechanism to push electrons beyond Q, and the shape is modified by the single massless particle carrying off energy, effectively reducing the maximum electron energy relative to the two‐neutrino case. Hence the spectrum stays continuous with an adjusted shape, and the maximum (endpoint) electron sum energy is reduced.
