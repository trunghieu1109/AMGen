Question: Example(question='You are studying a nuclear decay which converts two heavy nucleons of flavor A to another flavor B, while simultaneously emitting two much lighter particles E and V. In short, 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V. It is known that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous, with some endpoint value Q.\n\nA variant of this decay emits one exotic, massless particle M instead of the 2V. In this case, how does the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles compare to that of the original decay?', choice1='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint increases.', choice2='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases.', choice3='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.', choice4='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint decreases.', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The original decay 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V involves two light particles E and two light particles V, with the total energy spectrum of the E particles being continuous due to the distribution of energy among multiple particles. When replacing the two V particles with one massless exotic particle M, the number of emitted particles decreases, but the total available energy Q remains the same. Since M is massless, it can carry away varying amounts of energy, allowing the energy spectrum of E to remain continuous. However, with fewer particles sharing the energy, the shape of the spectrum will adjust, and the endpoint energy of the E particles can increase because less energy is partitioned among particles. Therefore, the spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.
