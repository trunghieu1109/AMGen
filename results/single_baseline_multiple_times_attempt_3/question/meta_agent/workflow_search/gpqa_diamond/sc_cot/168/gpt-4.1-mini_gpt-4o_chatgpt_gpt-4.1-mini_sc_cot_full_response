Question: {'question': 'You are studying a nuclear decay which converts two heavy nucleons of flavor A to another flavor B, while simultaneously emitting two much lighter particles E and V.

Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent ScY8', content='In the original decay 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V, the energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous because the neutrinos V carry away variable amounts of energy, allowing the Es to have a range of energies up to an endpoint value Q. In the variant decay, 2A -> 2B + 2E + M, the massless particle M takes away a fixed amount of energy since it is massless and there is only one of it. This means the remaining energy is distributed between the two E particles in a way that is not fixed, but the total energy available to them is less than in the original decay, as M takes some of the energy that would have gone to the neutrinos. Therefore, the spectrum remains continuous, but the endpoint is lower because M takes away a fixed amount of energy.\n\nAnswer:B)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
