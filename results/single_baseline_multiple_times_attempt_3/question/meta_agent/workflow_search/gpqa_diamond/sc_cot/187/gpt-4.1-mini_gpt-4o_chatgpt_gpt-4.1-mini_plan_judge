Question: Example(question='Consider a rhombohedral crystal, with the interatomic distance of 10 Angstrom and the angles $\\quad\\alpha=\\beta=\\gamma=30^{0}$. What is the interplanar distance of the (111) plane of the crystal?\n', choice1='9.54 Angstrom', choice2='8.95 Angstrom', choice3='9.08 Angstrom', choice4='10.05 Angstrom', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To find the interplanar distance of the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal, we use the formula for the interplanar spacing d_hkl for a rhombohedral lattice. The formula involves the lattice parameter a (interatomic distance) and the angles between the axes. For a rhombohedral crystal, the formula is: d_hkl = a / sqrt(h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2hk cos(alpha) + 2kl cos(beta) + 2hl cos(gamma)). Given the interatomic distance a = 10 Angstroms and the angles alpha = beta = gamma = 30 degrees, we calculate d_111. Substitute h = k = l = 1 and the given values into the formula, and compute the result.
