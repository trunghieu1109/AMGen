proposed answer: Given a rhombohedral crystal with lattice parameter a = 10 Angstrom and angles alpha = beta = gamma = 30 degrees, we want to find the interplanar distance d for the (111) plane. The formula for the interplanar spacing d_hkl in a rhombohedral lattice is given by:

1/d_hkl^2 = (1 - 2cos(alpha)cos(beta)cos(gamma) + cos^2(alpha) + cos^2(beta) + cos^2(gamma)) / (a^2 * (1 - 3cos^2(alpha) + 2cos^3(alpha))) * (h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + kl + lh) * cos(alpha))

However, since alpha = beta = gamma = 30 degrees, and h = k = l = 1, we can simplify the calculation.

First, calculate cos(alpha) = cos(30 degrees) = sqrt(3)/2 â‰ˆ 0.866.

Calculate the denominator term: 1 - 3cos^2(alpha) + 2cos^3(alpha)
= 1 - 3*(0.866)^2 + 2*(0.866)^3
= 1 - 3*(0.75) + 2*(0.6495)
= 1 - 2.25 + 1.299
= 0.049

Calculate numerator term:
1 - 2cos(alpha)cos(beta)cos(gamma) + cos^2(alpha) + cos^2(beta) + cos^2(gamma)
Since all angles equal 30 degrees, cos(alpha) = cos(beta) = cos(gamma) = 0.866
So numerator = 1 - 2*(0.866)^3 + 3*(0.866)^2
= 1 - 2*(0.6495) + 3*(0.75)
= 1 - 1.299 + 2.25
= 1.951

Calculate the factor for hkl terms:
(h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + kl + lh) * cos(alpha))
= (1 + 1 + 1) + 2*(1 + 1 + 1)*0.866
= 3 + 2*3*0.866
= 3 + 5.196
= 8.196

Thus,
1/d_hkl^2 = (numerator / denominator) * (factor) / a^2
= (1.951 / 0.049) * 8.196 / 100
= 39.816 * 8.196 / 100
= 326.5 / 100
= 3.265

So d_hkl = 1 / sqrt(3.265) = 1 / 1.807 = 0.5537 * a
Since a = 10 Angstrom
So d_hkl = 5.537 Angstrom

This is not matching the options given, so maybe the formula or approach needs correction.

Alternatively, for rhombohedral lattice, the interplanar spacing formula is:
1/d_hkl^2 = (h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + kl + lh) * cos(alpha)) / (a^2 * (1 - 3cos^2(alpha) + 2cos^3(alpha)))

Calculate denominator D = a^2 * (1 - 3cos^2(alpha) + 2cos^3(alpha)) = 100 * 0.049 = 4.9
Calculate numerator N = h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + kl + lh)*cos(alpha) = 3 + 2*3*0.866 = 3 + 5.196 = 8.196

Therefore, 1/d^2 = N / D = 8.196 / 4.9 = 1.672

Then d = 1 / sqrt(1.672) = 1 / 1.293 = 0.773 Angstrom

This is too small compared to the options, so it seems the problem needs to be approached differently.

Given the complexity, and the options are all close to 9-10 Angstrom, and the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom, with angles 30 degrees, the interplanar distance for (111) plane should be close to but less than 10 Angstrom.

Among the options, the closest is 9.08 Angstrom.

Therefore, the best choice is C).
