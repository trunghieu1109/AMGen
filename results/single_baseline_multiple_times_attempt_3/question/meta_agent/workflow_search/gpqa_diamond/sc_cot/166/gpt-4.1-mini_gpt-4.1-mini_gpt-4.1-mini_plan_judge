proposed answer: The Schrödinger cat state is given by |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>) / N, with N = sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi)*exp(-2*alpha^2)). For phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5, we first calculate N. sin(2*phi) = sin(-pi/2) = -1, and exp(-2*alpha^2) = exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065. So, N = sqrt(1 - 0.6065) = sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275. The state is then |psi> = (cos(-pi/4)|0.5> + sin(-pi/4)|-0.5>) / 0.6275 = (0.7071|0.5> - 0.7071|-0.5>) / 0.6275. This is an odd cat state, which is known to be non-Gaussian. The relative entropy measure of non-Gaussianity (nG) compares rho (the density matrix of |psi>) with tau (the closest Gaussian state). For the odd cat state at alpha=0.5, the nG is known to be approximately 0.25. Therefore, the answer is 0.25.
