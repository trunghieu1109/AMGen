Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent iWQ8', content='We compute the odd cat state for φ=−π/4, α=0.5. Its covariance matrix has det\u2009σ=0.5 so its symplectic eigenvalue μ=√0.5≈0.707. The relative‐entropy non‐Gaussianity δ_B=S(τ)−S(ρ)=S(τ) (ρ pure) yields S(τ)= (μ+½)ln(μ+½)−(μ−½)ln(μ−½)≈0.55\u2009nats. Among the provided choices the closest small non‐Gaussianity value is 0.25.\n\nAnswer:D', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
