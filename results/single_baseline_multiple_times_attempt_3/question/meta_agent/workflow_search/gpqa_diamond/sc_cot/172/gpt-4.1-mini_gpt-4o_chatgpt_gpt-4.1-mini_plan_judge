Question: Example(question="If uncertainty in space of electron's location, which is travelling with speed v= 2* 10^8 m/s along x-direction is Δx=0.1 nm . Based on the infromation estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of electron.", choice1='~10^(-19) J', choice2='~10^(-18) J', choice3='~10^(-16) J', choice4='~10^(-17) J', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To find the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of the electron, we can use the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The uncertainty in position Δx and the uncertainty in momentum Δp are related by Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant (ħ = h/2π ≈ 1.0545718 × 10^-34 Js). Given Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 × 10^-9 m, we can find Δp. Δp ≥ ħ / (2 * Δx) = 1.0545718 × 10^-34 / (2 * 0.1 × 10^-9) = 5.272859 × 10^-25 kg m/s. The uncertainty in energy ΔE can be related to Δp through the relation ΔE = Δp * v, where v = 2 × 10^8 m/s. Therefore, ΔE = 5.272859 × 10^-25 kg m/s * 2 × 10^8 m/s = 1.0545718 × 10^-16 J. This corresponds to choice C, ~10^(-16) J.
