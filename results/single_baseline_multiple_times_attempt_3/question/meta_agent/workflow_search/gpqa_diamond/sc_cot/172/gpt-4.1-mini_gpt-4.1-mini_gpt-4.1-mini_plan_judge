Question: Example(question="If uncertainty in space of electron's location, which is travelling with speed v= 2* 10^8 m/s along x-direction is Δx=0.1 nm . Based on the infromation estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of electron.", choice1='~10^(-19) J', choice2='~10^(-18) J', choice3='~10^(-16) J', choice4='~10^(-17) J', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: Given: Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 × 10^-9 m = 1 × 10^-10 m, v = 2 × 10^8 m/s. Using Heisenberg's uncertainty principle: Δx Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ = h/(2π) ≈ 1.054 × 10^-34 J·s. Calculate Δp: Δp ≥ ħ/(2Δx) = 1.054 × 10^-34 / (2 × 1 × 10^-10) = 5.27 × 10^-25 kg·m/s. Now, the uncertainty in kinetic energy ΔE can be approximated as ΔE ≈ v Δp (since E = p^2/2m, small change in p gives ΔE ≈ v Δp). So, ΔE ≈ 2 × 10^8 × 5.27 × 10^-25 = 1.054 × 10^-16 J. This corresponds to choice3: ~10^(-16) J.
