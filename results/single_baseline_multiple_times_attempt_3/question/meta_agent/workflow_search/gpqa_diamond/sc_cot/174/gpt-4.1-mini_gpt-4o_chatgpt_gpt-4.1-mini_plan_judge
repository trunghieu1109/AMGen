Question: Example(question='Consider an oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis). Because it oscillates, it would radiate at a wavelength \\lambda. In the radiation zone, the radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of \\lambda and the angle \\theta (with z-axis), along which the power is measured. If the maximum power thus radiated is A, the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle \\theta = 30^0 and a possible form of f are, respectively,', choice1='1/2, \\lambda^(-4)', choice2='3/4, \\lambda^(-6)', choice3='1/4, \\lambda^(-4)', choice4='1/4, \\lambda^(-3)', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The problem involves a spheroidal oscillating charge distribution radiating power. The power radiated by an oscillating dipole is proportional to sin^2(theta), where theta is the angle with the z-axis. The maximum power is radiated at theta = 90 degrees. At theta = 30 degrees, the power is proportional to sin^2(30) = (1/2)^2 = 1/4. Therefore, the fraction of maximum power radiated at theta = 30 degrees is 1/4. The power radiated by an oscillating dipole is also proportional to lambda^(-4), which is a characteristic of dipole radiation. Thus, the correct choice is the one with 1/4 and lambda^(-4).
