Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent VWWJ', content='For an oscillating charge distribution with spheroidal symmetry along the z-axis, the radiation pattern typically depends on the angle θ with respect to the symmetry axis. The angular dependence of the radiated power per unit solid angle often follows a sin^2(θ) pattern for dipole-like radiation. At θ = 30°, sin^2(30°) = (1/2)^2 = 1/4. This suggests that the fraction of the maximum power A radiated at 30° is 1/4. Regarding the wavelength dependence, the power radiated by an oscillating dipole generally scales as λ^(-4) (since power is proportional to the square of the frequency, and frequency is inversely proportional to wavelength). Therefore, the function f should be proportional to λ^(-4). Combining these, the correct choice is the one with fraction 1/4 and λ^(-4).\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
