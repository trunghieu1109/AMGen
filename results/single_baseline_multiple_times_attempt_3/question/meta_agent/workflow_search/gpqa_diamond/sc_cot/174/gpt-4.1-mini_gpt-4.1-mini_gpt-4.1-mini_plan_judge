Question: Example(question='Consider an oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis). Because it oscillates, it would radiate at a wavelength \\lambda. In the radiation zone, the radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of \\lambda and the angle \\theta (with z-axis), along which the power is measured. If the maximum power thus radiated is A, the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle \\theta = 30^0 and a possible form of f are, respectively,', choice1='1/2, \\lambda^(-4)', choice2='3/4, \\lambda^(-6)', choice3='1/4, \\lambda^(-4)', choice4='1/4, \\lambda^(-3)', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: For an oscillating charge distribution with spheroidal symmetry along the z-axis, the radiation pattern typically depends on the angle θ with respect to the symmetry axis. The angular dependence of the radiated power per unit solid angle often follows a sin^2(θ) pattern for dipole-like radiation. At θ = 30°, sin^2(30°) = (1/2)^2 = 1/4. This suggests that the fraction of the maximum power A radiated at 30° is 1/4. Regarding the wavelength dependence, the power radiated by an oscillating dipole generally scales as λ^(-4) (since power is proportional to the square of the frequency, and frequency is inversely proportional to wavelength). Therefore, the function f should be proportional to λ^(-4). Combining these, the correct choice is the one with fraction 1/4 and λ^(-4).
