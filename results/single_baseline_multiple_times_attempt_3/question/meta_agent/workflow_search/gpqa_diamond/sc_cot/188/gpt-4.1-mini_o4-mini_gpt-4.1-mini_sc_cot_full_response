Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 6D6Y', content='We examine each particle and its relation to spontaneously broken symmetries:\n\n1) Magnon: In a ferromagnet or antiferromagnet, spin rotational symmetry is spontaneously broken, producing magnons as the associated Nambuâ€“Goldstone bosons.\n2) Pion: In quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the approximate chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken, and pions are the resulting (pseudo-)Goldstone bosons.\n3) Phonon: In a crystal, continuous translational symmetry is spontaneously broken by the lattice structure, giving rise to phonons as Goldstone modes.\n4) Skyrmion: A skyrmion is a topological soliton solution in a nonlinear sigma model; it is not itself a Goldstone boson or directly tied to a spontaneously broken continuous symmetry.\n\nTherefore, only the skyrmion is not associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry.\n\nAnswer:B)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
