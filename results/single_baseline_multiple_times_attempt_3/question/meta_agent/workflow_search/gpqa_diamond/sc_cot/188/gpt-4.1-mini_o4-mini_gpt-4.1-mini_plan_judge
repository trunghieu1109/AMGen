Question: Example(question='Which of the following (effective) particles is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry?', choice1='Magnon', choice2='Skyrmion', choice3='Pion', choice4='Phonon', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: We examine each particle and its relation to spontaneously broken symmetries:

1) Magnon: In a ferromagnet or antiferromagnet, spin rotational symmetry is spontaneously broken, producing magnons as the associated Nambuâ€“Goldstone bosons.
2) Pion: In quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the approximate chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken, and pions are the resulting (pseudo-)Goldstone bosons.
3) Phonon: In a crystal, continuous translational symmetry is spontaneously broken by the lattice structure, giving rise to phonons as Goldstone modes.
4) Skyrmion: A skyrmion is a topological soliton solution in a nonlinear sigma model; it is not itself a Goldstone boson or directly tied to a spontaneously broken continuous symmetry.

Therefore, only the skyrmion is not associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry.
