Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 56D6', content='A spontaneously-broken symmetry in physics leads to the emergence of Nambu-Goldstone bosons, which are massless or nearly massless excitations. Magnons are spin waves in magnets and arise due to the spontaneous breaking of spin rotational symmetry. Pions are pseudo-Goldstone bosons resulting from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in QCD. Phonons are quanta of lattice vibrations and can be considered as arising from the spontaneous breaking of continuous translational symmetry in crystals. Skyrmions, however, are topological solitons or particle-like configurations in a field theory and are not themselves Nambu-Goldstone bosons or excitations directly associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry. Therefore, the particle not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry is the Skyrmion.\n\nAnswer:B)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
