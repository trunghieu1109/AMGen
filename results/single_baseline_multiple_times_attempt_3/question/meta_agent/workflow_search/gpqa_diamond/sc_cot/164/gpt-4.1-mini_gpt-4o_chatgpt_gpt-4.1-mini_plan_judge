Question: Example(question='In an industrial research lab, a scientist performs ethylene polymerization with a homogeneous organometallic catalyst system, generating a polymer of high density. He intends to add a second catalyst system to introduce regular branches in the polymer backbone, also only using ethylene as the reactant. He consults a senior scientist, who gives the following statements. “Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US. One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators. Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step. Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.”\nWhich of these four statements is correct regarding the formation of a polymer with regular branches using only ethylene as the monomer and a dual catalyst system?', choice1='Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.', choice2='Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.', choice3='One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.', choice4='Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The question is about polymerizing ethylene to create a polymer with regular branches using a dual catalyst system. The senior scientist provides four statements about this process. We need to determine which statement is correct. Statement 1 suggests such systems are already used industrially in the US. This is plausible, as similar systems like metallocene catalysts are known. Statement 2 claims aluminum-based activators do not work for the additional reaction step. This seems incorrect because aluminum alkyls are commonly used as cocatalysts in polymerization. Statement 3 suggests using a group VIa transition metal catalyst. This is unlikely because group VIa metals are not typically used for ethylene polymerization. Statement 4 mentions noble metal catalysts, which are indeed expensive and not commonly used industrially for this purpose. Thus, Statement 1 is most likely correct.
