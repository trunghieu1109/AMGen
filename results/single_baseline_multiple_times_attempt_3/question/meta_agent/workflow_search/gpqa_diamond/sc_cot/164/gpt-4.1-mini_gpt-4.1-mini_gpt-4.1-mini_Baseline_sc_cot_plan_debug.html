    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;In an industrial research lab, a scientist performs ethylene polymerization with a homogeneous organometallic catalyst system, generating a polymer of high density. He intends to add a second catalyst system to introduce regular branches in the polymer backbone, also only using ethylene as the reactant. He consults a senior scientist, who gives the following statements. “Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US. One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators. Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step. Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.”\nWhich of these four statements is correct regarding the formation of a polymer with regular branches using only ethylene as the monomer and a dual catalyst system?&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.&#39;}

    <pre>The question involves ethylene polymerization using a dual catalyst system to produce a polymer with regular branches from only ethylene. The senior scientist&#39;s statements are: 1) Such combined systems are already implemented industrially in the US. 2) Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step. 3) Catalysts of group VIa transition metals can be used with specific activators. 4) Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive. From industrial practice, dual catalyst systems are indeed used to produce branched polyethylene, such as combining Ziegler-Natta or metallocene catalysts with other catalysts. Group VIa metals (like chromium) are known for ethylene polymerization, but their use in this specific dual catalyst system is less common. Aluminum-based activators (like MAO) are typically effective in activating organometallic catalysts, so the claim that they do not work for the additional reaction step is likely false. Noble metal catalysts are generally expensive and not used industrially for this purpose, so that statement is true but does not directly address the question about the formation of polymer with regular branches using a dual catalyst system. The key point is that such combined systems are already implemented industrially (statement 1), which is correct. Therefore, the correct statement regarding the formation of polymer with regular branches using only ethylene and a dual catalyst system is choice A) Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.
