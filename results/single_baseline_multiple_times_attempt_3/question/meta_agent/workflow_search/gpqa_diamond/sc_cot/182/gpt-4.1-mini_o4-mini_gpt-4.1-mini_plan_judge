Question: Example(question='What is the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product obtained when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess of HI?', choice1='1', choice2='3', choice3='0', choice4='5', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The HI/red P combination acts like a Clemmensen reduction: it reduces the aldehyde (–CHO) and the carboxylic acid (–COOH) to methylene/alkyl groups, but does not saturate existing C=C bonds. Starting material has a cyclohexene ring (1 ring + 1 C=C) and a vinyl substituent (1 C=C). After reduction, the two C=O groups become CH2/CH3 substituents, but the ring C=C and the vinyl C=C remain. IHD = ring (1) + ring double bond (1) + vinyl double bond (1) = 3.
