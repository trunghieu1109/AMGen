Question: Example(question='What is the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product obtained when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess of HI?', choice1='1', choice2='3', choice3='0', choice4='5', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The compound 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid has a cyclohexene ring, a formyl group, a vinyl group, and a carboxylic acid group. The structure has several degrees of unsaturation due to the ring, double bonds, and functional groups. When reacted with red phosphorus and excess HI, this is a typical reducing condition that will saturate double bonds and reduce functional groups to alkanes. The cyclohexene ring will become cyclohexane, the formyl group will be reduced to a methyl group, the vinyl group will become ethyl, and the carboxylic acid will be reduced to a methyl group. The resulting compound will be a fully saturated cyclohexane with additional alkyl groups, having no double bonds or rings, so the index of hydrogen deficiency will be 0.
