proposed answer: The given compound is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. It contains a cyclohexene ring (one double bond), an aldehyde group (formyl), a vinyl group (another double bond), and a carboxylic acid group. The index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) or degree of unsaturation is calculated by counting the number of rings and pi bonds. Initially, the compound has: - One ring (cyclohexene) = 1 - One double bond in the ring = 1 - One double bond in the vinyl group = 1 - One aldehyde group (C=O) = 1 - One carboxylic acid group (C=O) = 1 Total IHD initially = 1 (ring) + 1 (ring double bond) + 1 (vinyl double bond) + 1 (aldehyde) + 1 (carboxylic acid) = 5. Now, the reaction with red phosphorus and excess HI reduces the aldehyde and carboxylic acid groups to corresponding hydrocarbons, removing the double bonds in these groups. So the aldehyde and carboxylic acid groups lose their C=O double bonds, reducing the IHD by 2. The vinyl group double bond and the ring double bond remain intact. The ring is still present. So, after reaction, IHD = 1 (ring) + 1 (ring double bond) + 1 (vinyl double bond) = 3. Therefore, the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 3.
