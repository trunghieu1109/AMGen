Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent DQVo', content='The reaction of an alkene with mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid) forms an epoxide. For (E)- and (Z)-oct-4-ene, the stereochemistry of the double bond affects the stereochemistry of the epoxide formed. The (E)-alkene will give one diastereomeric epoxide, and the (Z)-alkene will give a different diastereomeric epoxide. Each epoxide can exist as a pair of enantiomers because the epoxidation creates chiral centers. Therefore, from (E)-oct-4-ene, we get a pair of enantiomers (2 stereoisomers), and from (Z)-oct-4-ene, we get another pair of enantiomers (2 stereoisomers). In total, there are 4 stereoisomers (2 diastereomeric pairs of enantiomers). On a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column, enantiomers are not resolved, so each pair of enantiomers appears as a single peak. Since there are two diastereomers, the standard HPLC will show 2 peaks. On a chiral HPLC column, enantiomers are resolved, so each pair of enantiomers will give 2 peaks. Therefore, the chiral HPLC will show 4 peaks. Thus, the chemist observes 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC.\n\nAnswer:B)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
