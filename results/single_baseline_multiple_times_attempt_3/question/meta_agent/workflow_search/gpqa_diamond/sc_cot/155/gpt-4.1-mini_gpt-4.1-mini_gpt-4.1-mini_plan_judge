Question: Example(question='A chemist performs two reactions:\n\nReaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. \n\nReaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.\n\nBoth reactions go to 100% completion. The chemist combines the products of both reactions, and then runs the product mixture on both a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column and a chiral HPLC column.\n\nAssuming that the chromatographic resolution is as high as theoretically possible in both cases, what does the chemist observe in each of these chromatograms?', choice1='4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', choice2='3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice3='2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice4='2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: The reaction of an alkene with mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid) forms an epoxide. For (E)- and (Z)-oct-4-ene, the stereochemistry of the double bond affects the stereochemistry of the epoxide formed. The (E)-alkene will give one diastereomeric epoxide, and the (Z)-alkene will give a different diastereomeric epoxide. Each epoxide can exist as a pair of enantiomers because the epoxidation creates chiral centers. Therefore, from (E)-oct-4-ene, we get a pair of enantiomers (2 stereoisomers), and from (Z)-oct-4-ene, we get another pair of enantiomers (2 stereoisomers). In total, there are 4 stereoisomers (2 diastereomeric pairs of enantiomers). On a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column, enantiomers are not resolved, so each pair of enantiomers appears as a single peak. Since there are two diastereomers, the standard HPLC will show 2 peaks. On a chiral HPLC column, enantiomers are resolved, so each pair of enantiomers will give 2 peaks. Therefore, the chiral HPLC will show 4 peaks. Thus, the chemist observes 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC.
