Question: Example(question='A chemist performs two reactions:\n\nReaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. \n\nReaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.\n\nBoth reactions go to 100% completion. The chemist combines the products of both reactions, and then runs the product mixture on both a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column and a chiral HPLC column.\n\nAssuming that the chromatographic resolution is as high as theoretically possible in both cases, what does the chemist observe in each of these chromatograms?', choice1='4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', choice2='3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice3='2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice4='2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: Reaction 1 involves treating (E)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA, which forms an epoxide. When followed by aqueous acid, this results in a diol. The stereochemistry of the starting alkene affects the stereochemistry of the diol. (E)-oct-4-ene will lead to a trans-diol. Reaction 2 involves (Z)-oct-4-ene, which will lead to a cis-diol. Both reactions produce diastereomers due to the different stereochemistry of the starting alkenes. In standard HPLC, diastereomers can often be separated, but enantiomers cannot. Therefore, we expect 2 peaks in standard HPLC, corresponding to the trans-diol and the cis-diol. In chiral HPLC, enantiomers can be separated, so we expect 3 peaks: one for each enantiomer of the cis-diol (which are enantiomers of each other) and one for the trans-diol (which is meso and thus not chiral).
