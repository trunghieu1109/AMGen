Question: {'question': 'A chemist performs two reactions:\n\nReaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. \n\nReaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.\n\nBoth reactions go to 100% completion. The chemist combines the products of both reactions, and then runs the product mixture on both a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column and a chiral HPLC column.\n\nAssuming that the chromatographic resolution is as high as theoretically possible in both cases, what does the chemist observe in each of these chromatograms?', 'choice1': '4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', 'choice2': '3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC', 'choice3': '2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC', 'choice4': '2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC'}\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 2cpG', content='Epoxidation of symmetric oct-4-ene: (E)-alkene → racemic epoxide (two enantiomers); (Z)-alkene → meso epoxide. Combined gives three stereoisomers. Achiral HPLC: enantiomers coelute (1 peak), meso separate (1 peak) → 2 peaks. Chiral HPLC: racemate resolves (2 peaks), meso (1 peak) → 3 peaks.\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
