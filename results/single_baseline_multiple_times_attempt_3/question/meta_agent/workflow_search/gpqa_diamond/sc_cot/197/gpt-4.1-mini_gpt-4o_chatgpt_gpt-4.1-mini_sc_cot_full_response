Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent VrPK', content='To find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes, we need to calculate the concentrations of all cobalt-containing species in the solution. The stability constants are given for the formation of Co(SCN)+, Co(SCN)2, Co(SCN)3-, and Co(SCN)4^2-. The total concentration of cobalt is 0.01 M, and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. We use the stability constants to set up equilibrium expressions for each complex: [Co(SCN)+] = β1[Co2+][SCN-], [Co(SCN)2] = β2[Co2+][SCN-]^2, [Co(SCN)3-] = β3[Co2+][SCN-]^3, [Co(SCN)4^2-] = β4[Co2+][SCN-]^4. The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all these species. We need to find the concentration of Co(SCN)2 and divide it by the total cobalt concentration to get the percentage. Solving these equations will give us the concentrations, and then we can calculate the percentage of Co(SCN)2.\n\nAnswer:B)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
