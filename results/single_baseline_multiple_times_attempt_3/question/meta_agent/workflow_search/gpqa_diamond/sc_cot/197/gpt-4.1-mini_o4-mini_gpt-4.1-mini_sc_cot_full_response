Question: {'question': 'We have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate, where the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M and the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16. What will be the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species in the solution?

Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent rPKz', content='We have Co(II) + SCN− forming 4 complexes with cumulative β values. Total [Co]T=0.01\u2009M, [SCN]T=0.1\u2009M. Let S=[SCN] free. Complex concentrations: [Co]=C0/(1+9S+40S2+63S3+16S4), [Co(SCN)2]=40\u2009S2\u2009[Co]. Use mass balance on SCN: S + Σ\u2009i[Co(SCN)i]=0.1. Guess S≈0.0925\u2009M satisfies this. Then [Co(SCN)2]≈0.00154\u2009M, so fraction=0.00154/0.01≈0.154≈15.4%, close to 16.9%.\n\nAnswer:A)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
