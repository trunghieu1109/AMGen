Question: Example(question='We have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate, where the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M and the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16. What will be the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species in the solution?

proposed answer: Given the total cobalt concentration c(Co) = 10^-2 M and thiocyanate concentration [SCN-] = 0.1 M, we have the stability constants for the complexes: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. These correspond to the stepwise formation constants for Co(SCN)+, Co(SCN)2, Co(SCN)3-, and Co(SCN)4^2-, respectively. However, the values given seem to be cumulative stability constants (β), but the order of magnitude and values are unusual. Assuming β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16 are cumulative stability constants, then the concentration of each species can be calculated as follows: Let [Co^2+] = x. Then, total cobalt concentration is: [Co]_total = x + β1*x*[SCN-] + β2*x*[SCN-]^2 + β3*x*[SCN-]^3 + β4*x*[SCN-]^4. Plug in values: [SCN-] = 0.1 M, c(Co) = 0.01 M. Calculate each term: β1*[SCN-] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9 β2*[SCN-]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4 β3*[SCN-]^3 = 63 * (0.1)^3 = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063 β4*[SCN-]^4 = 16 * (0.1)^4 = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016 Sum of terms = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646 So, 0.01 = x * 2.3646 => x = 0.01 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.00423 M The concentration of Co(SCN)2 complex is: [Co(SCN)2] = β2 * x * [SCN-]^2 = 40 * 0.00423 * 0.01 = 0.001692 M The percentage of Co(SCN)2 among all cobalt species is: (0.001692 / 0.01) * 100% = 16.92% The closest answer choice is 16.9%.
