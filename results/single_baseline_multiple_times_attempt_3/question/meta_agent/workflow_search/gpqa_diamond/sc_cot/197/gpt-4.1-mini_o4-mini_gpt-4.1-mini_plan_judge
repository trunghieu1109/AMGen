Question: Example(question='We have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate, where the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M and the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16. What will be the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species in the solution? ', choice1='16.9%', choice2='42.3%', choice3='25.6%', choice4='38.1%', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: We have Co(II) + SCN− forming 4 complexes with cumulative β values. Total [Co]T=0.01 M, [SCN]T=0.1 M. Let S=[SCN] free. Complex concentrations: [Co]=C0/(1+9S+40S2+63S3+16S4), [Co(SCN)2]=40 S2 [Co]. Use mass balance on SCN: S + Σ i[Co(SCN)i]=0.1. Guess S≈0.0925 M satisfies this. Then [Co(SCN)2]≈0.00154 M, so fraction=0.00154/0.01≈0.154≈15.4%, close to 16.9%.
