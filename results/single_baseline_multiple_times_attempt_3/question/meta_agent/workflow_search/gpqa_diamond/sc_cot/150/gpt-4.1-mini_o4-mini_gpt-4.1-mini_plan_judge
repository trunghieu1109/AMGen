Question: Example(question='The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1). An observable of the system is represented by the matrix operator P having elements in the first row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0),  in the second row as (1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}) and in the third row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0). Calculate the probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 at time t.', choice1='1/3\n', choice2='2/3\n', choice3='\\sqrt{2/3}\n', choice4='1', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: First, normalize the given state |\psi\rangle = (-1,2,1)^T/√6. The observable’s matrix P = [ [0,a,0];[a,0,a];[0,a,0] ] with a=1/√2. Its eigenvalues are 1,0,−1. The zero‐eigenvalue eigenvector (unnormalized) is (1,0,−1), normalized to |v_0\rangle=(1/√2)(1,0,−1)^T. The probability of measuring 0 is |⟨v_0|\psi⟩|^2 = |(1/√2,0,−1/√2)·(−1/√6,2/√6,1/√6)|^2 = |(−1 −1)/√12|^2 = (2/√12)^2 = 1/3.
