    <pre>The question is about the flux of neutrinos from the Sun, specifically from the pp-III branch of the proton-proton chain reaction. The pp-III branch is responsible for producing high-energy neutrinos, particularly those associated with the decay of beryllium-7 and boron-8. The neutrinos from the boron-8 decay are high-energy neutrinos, and if the pp-III branch stopped, the flux of these high-energy neutrinos would be significantly affected. The energy range of 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2) are both relatively low compared to the typical energies of neutrinos from the pp-III branch, which are generally higher. However, the stopping of the pp-III branch would primarily affect the higher energy neutrinos more than the lower energy ones. Therefore, the flux in band 2 (800-900 keV) would be reduced more than the flux in band 1 (700-800 keV), leading to a higher ratio of flux in band 1 to band 2 after the pp-III branch stops. Thus, the flux ratio would be greater than 1.
