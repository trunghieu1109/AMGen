Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent c5zy', content='We stop the pp-III branch eliminating ^8B neutrinos. In the 700–800 keV band there are then essentially no neutrinos (pp ends at 420 keV, ^7Be line at 861 keV), while in 800–900 keV we get the ^7Be line at 862 keV (flux ~5×10^9 cm^–2 s^–1). So flux1/flux2≈0, well below any other neutrino source. Of the given options the smallest is 10^–2.\n\nAnswer:D)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
