Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent BWyY', content='First, calculate moles of Fe(OH)3: MW ≈ 106.87 g/mol, so n ≈ 0.1/106.87 = 9.36×10^–4 mol. Dissolution reaction consumes 3 mol H+ per mol Fe(OH)3, so required H+ moles ≈ 3×9.36×10^–4 = 2.81×10^–3 mol. Using 0.1 M acid, volume V = n/C = (2.81×10^–3)/(0.1) = 0.0281 L = 28.05 mL. Then [Fe3+] ≈ 9.36×10^–4/0.1 L = 9.36×10^–3 M. Fe3+ hydrolyzes: Fe3+ + H2O ⇌ FeOH2+ + H+ with Ka1 ≈ 8×10^–3. Approximating x^2/(C – x) = Ka1 gives x ≈ sqrt(Ka1·C) ≈ sqrt(8×10^–3·9.36×10^–3) ≈ 9.1×10^–3 M, so pH ≈ –log(9.1×10^–3) ≈ 2.04.
