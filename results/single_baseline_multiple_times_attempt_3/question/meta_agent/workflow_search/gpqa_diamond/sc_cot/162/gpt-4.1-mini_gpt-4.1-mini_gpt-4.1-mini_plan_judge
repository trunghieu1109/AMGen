Question: Example(question='We would like to dissolve (at 25°С) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm3 total volume. What is the minimum volume (cm3) of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution and what is the pH of the resulting solution?', choice1='pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3', choice2='pH 2.69; 30.09 cm3', choice3='pH 3.16; 32.14 cm3', choice4='pH 4.94; 20.40 cm3', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: First, calculate the moles of Fe(OH)3 to be dissolved. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is approximately 106.87 g/mol (Fe = 55.85, O = 16*3=48, H=1*3=3). Moles of Fe(OH)3 = 0.1 g / 106.87 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 mol. Fe(OH)3 is a base and will react with the strong acid (monobasic, so 1 mole H+ per mole acid) to dissolve. The dissolution reaction consumes 3 moles of H+ per mole of Fe(OH)3: Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe3+ + 3H2O. Therefore, moles of H+ needed = 3 * 0.000936 mol = 0.002808 mol. The acid is 0.1 M, so volume needed = moles / concentration = 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 L = 28.08 cm3. The total volume is 100 cm3, but since the acid volume is part of this, the rest is water. Now, after neutralizing Fe(OH)3, the solution is acidic due to excess H+. The pH can be estimated from the concentration of excess H+. Since the acid is just enough to neutralize Fe(OH)3, there might be no excess acid, but the problem implies some pH value. Considering the volume of acid added is 28.05 cm3 (close to 28.08 cm3 calculated), and the pH is given as 2.04 in choice A, which is the most consistent with the calculations. Hence, the minimum volume of acid is about 28.05 cm3 and pH is about 2.04.
