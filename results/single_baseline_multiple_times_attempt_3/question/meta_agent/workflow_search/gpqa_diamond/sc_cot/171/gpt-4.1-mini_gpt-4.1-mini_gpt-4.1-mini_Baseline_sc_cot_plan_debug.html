    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Two stars are being studied. It has been observed that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2. In fact, the energy difference between the considered energy levels was determined to be approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J. Assuming that the stellar photospheres are in LTE, which of these equations for the effective temperatures of the stars (T_1 and T_2) is correct?&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]\n&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]\n&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n&#39;}

    <pre>The problem involves the ratio of populations of iron atoms in a specific excited energy level in two stars. According to the Boltzmann distribution in LTE, the ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state to the ground state is proportional to exp(-E/(kT)), where E is the energy difference, k is Boltzmann&#39;s constant, and T is the temperature. Given that the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2, we have: N1/N2 = 2 = exp(-E/(kT1)) / exp(-E/(kT2)) = exp(E/k * (1/T2 - 1/T1)). Taking the natural logarithm: ln(2) = (E/k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1). Rearranging, ln(2) = (E/k) * (T1 - T2) / (T1 * T2). Since E/k is a constant, the key form is ln(2) proportional to (T1 - T2)/(T1*T2). This matches choice 4.
