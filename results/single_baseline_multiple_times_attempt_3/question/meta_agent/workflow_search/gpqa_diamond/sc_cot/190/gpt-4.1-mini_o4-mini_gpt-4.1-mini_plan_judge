Question: Example(question='3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one is treated with sodium hydride, followed by benzyl bromide, forming product 1.\n\n1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide in the presence of a catalytic amount of HCl, forming product 2.\n\n2 is treated at low temperature with n-butyllithium, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride, forming product 3.\n\n3 is stirred with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere, forming product 4.\n\nWhat is the structure of product 4?', choice1='(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol', choice2="N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide", choice3='(((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene', choice4='3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The sequence is: (1) NaH/BnBr protects the 3-CH2OH as a benzyl ether. (2) TsNHNH2/HCl converts the ketone into a tosylhydrazone. (3) n-BuLi then triggers the Shapiro reaction, converting the C1 ketone to a C1â€“C2 alkene (with loss of TsNHNH2) while leaving the benzyl ether and isopropenyl intact. (4) H2/Pd removes the benzyl protecting group (restoring CH2OH) and hydrogenates both the exocyclic isopropenyl and the newly formed alkene, yielding a fully saturated cyclohexane with an exocyclic hydroxymethyl at C3 (original numbering) and an isopropyl at C5.  Renumbering so that the hydroxymethyl is at C1 gives a cyclohexane-1-methanol with an isopropyl at C3, i.e. (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.
