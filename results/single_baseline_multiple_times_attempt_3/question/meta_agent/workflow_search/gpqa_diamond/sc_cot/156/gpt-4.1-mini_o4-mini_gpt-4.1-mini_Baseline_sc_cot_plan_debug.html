    <pre>The question asks for designing a molecular diagnostic kit for quick detection of a retrovirus, which is an RNA virus. You need to reverse-transcribe the viral RNA to cDNA, sequence it to identify the virus, and then use real-time PCR for rapid and accurate detection. Choice D matches this approach.
