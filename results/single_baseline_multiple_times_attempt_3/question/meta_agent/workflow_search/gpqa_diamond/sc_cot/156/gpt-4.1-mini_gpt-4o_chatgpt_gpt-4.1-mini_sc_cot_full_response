Question: {'question': 'There has been an outbreak of an viral infectious disease in your city. You have been asked to design a molecular diagnostic kit for quick detection of this retrovirus. How would you go about designing this kit?', 'choice1': 'First you identify the virus by performing DNA sequencing. You then develop a PCR kit for  quick and accurate diagnosis', 'choice2': 'First you identify the IgG antibodies for the infection. You then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG antibodies for quick \n and accurate diagnosis.', 'choice3': 'First you identify the virus using the information about the symptoms, provided by the affected patients. You then design a nested PCR kit based on the information for quick diagnosis.', 'choice4': 'First you identify the virus by performing cDNA sequencing.  You then develop a real time PCR kit for quick and accurate diagnosis.'}\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent cXsv', content='To design a molecular diagnostic kit for a retrovirus, we need to consider the nature of retroviruses, which have RNA genomes. The most direct approach to identify a retrovirus is to sequence its RNA. However, since RNA is not stable, we typically convert it to cDNA using reverse transcription. Once we have the cDNA, we can sequence it to identify the virus. After identification, we can develop a PCR-based diagnostic kit. Real-time PCR is a common and effective method for detecting viral RNA because it is quantitative and allows for rapid detection. Therefore, the best approach is to identify the virus by performing cDNA sequencing, followed by the development of a real-time PCR kit.\n\nAnswer:D)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
