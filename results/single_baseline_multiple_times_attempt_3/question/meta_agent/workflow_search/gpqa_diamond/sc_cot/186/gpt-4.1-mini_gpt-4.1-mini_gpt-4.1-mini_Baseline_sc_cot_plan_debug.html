    <pre>First, to determine detectability with ESPRESSO on an 8m VLT, we need to consider the apparent magnitude of each star and whether it can achieve S/N &gt;= 10 in a 1-hour exposure. The stars given are: a) Canopus, b) Polaris, c) star at 10 pc with absolute magnitude 15, d) star at 200 pc with absolute magnitude 15, e) star at 5 pc with absolute magnitude 15, f) star at 50 pc with absolute magnitude 15. 

Calculate apparent magnitude (m) from absolute magnitude (M) and distance (d in parsecs) using: m = M + 5*log10(d/10).

For star c) at 10 pc: m = 15 + 5*log10(10/10) = 15 + 0 = 15.
For star d) at 200 pc: m = 15 + 5*log10(200/10) = 15 + 5*log10(20) ≈ 15 + 5*1.301 = 15 + 6.505 = 21.505.
For star e) at 5 pc: m = 15 + 5*log10(5/10) = 15 + 5*(-0.301) = 15 - 1.505 = 13.495.
For star f) at 50 pc: m = 15 + 5*log10(50/10) = 15 + 5*log10(5) ≈ 15 + 5*0.699 = 15 + 3.495 = 18.495.

Canopus and Polaris are very bright stars (Canopus V ~ -0.7, Polaris V ~ 2), so easily detectable.

ESPRESSO can reach S/N=10 for stars up to about magnitude 16 in 1 hour on an 8m telescope (approximate from instrument specs).

Thus, detectable stars are:
- Canopus (very bright)
- Polaris (bright)
- star at 5 pc (m=13.5)
- star at 10 pc (m=15)

Stars at 50 pc (m=18.5) and 200 pc (m=21.5) are too faint.

So, total detectable stars = 4.

Matching to choices: choice1 = 4, choice2 = 3, choice3 = 2, choice4 = 5. So answer is 4 (choice1).
