proposed answer: To determine which stars are detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph, we need to calculate the apparent magnitude of each star and compare it to the sensitivity limits of the spectrograph. ESPRESSO is mounted on the VLT, which has a large collecting area, allowing it to detect faint objects. A signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure is required for detection. 

Let's consider each star:

1. Canopus: Canopus is a bright star with an apparent magnitude of -0.74. It is easily detectable by ESPRESSO.

2. Polaris: Polaris has an apparent magnitude of about 1.98. It is also detectable by ESPRESSO.

3. Star at 10 pc with M_V = 15: The apparent magnitude m = M + 5(log10(d) - 1), where d is distance in parsecs. For this star, m = 15 + 5(log10(10) - 1) = 15. This is likely detectable.

4. Star at 200 pc with M_V = 15: m = 15 + 5(log10(200) - 1) = 20.5. This is too faint for ESPRESSO.

5. Star at 5 pc with M_V = 15: m = 15 + 5(log10(5) - 1) = 13.5. This is detectable.

6. Star at 50 pc with M_V = 15: m = 15 + 5(log10(50) - 1) = 19.5. This is too faint for ESPRESSO.

Detectable stars: Canopus, Polaris, star at 10 pc, and star at 5 pc. Total: 4 stars.
