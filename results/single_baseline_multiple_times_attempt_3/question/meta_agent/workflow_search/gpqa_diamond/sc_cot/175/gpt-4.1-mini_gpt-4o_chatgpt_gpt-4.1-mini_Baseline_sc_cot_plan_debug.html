The matrix operator for Q is represented by the square matrix having elements in the first row as (1, 0, 0), second row as (0, 0, 0) and third row as (0, 0, -1).

    <pre>To find the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q, we need to perform the following steps: 1) Find the eigenstates and eigenvalues of the operator P. 2) Determine the probability of measuring the eigenvalue 0 for P. 3) Determine the state of the system after measuring 0 for P. 4) Find the eigenstates and eigenvalues of the operator Q. 5) Calculate the probability of measuring -1 for Q given the state after measuring 0 for P. First, we find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P. The matrix for P is: P = [[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]]. Solving for eigenvalues, we find that 0 is an eigenvalue. The corresponding eigenvector (normalized) is v0 = [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)]. The initial state of the system is |psi&gt; = [-1, 2, 1]. The probability of measuring 0 for P is |&lt;v0|psi&gt;|^2. Calculate &lt;v0|psi&gt; = (1/sqrt(2))(-1) + (0)(2) + (-1/sqrt(2))(1) = -1/sqrt(2) - 1/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2). So, |&lt;v0|psi&gt;|^2 = (sqrt(2))^2 = 2. Normalizing gives the probability as 2/6 = 1/3. After measuring 0 for P, the system collapses to |v0&gt;. Now, measure Q. The matrix for Q is: Q = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -1]]. The eigenvalue -1 for Q has eigenvector [0, 0, 1]. The probability of measuring -1 for Q is |&lt;0,0,1|v0&gt;|^2 = |(-1/sqrt(2))|^2 = 1/2. The total probability is (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.
