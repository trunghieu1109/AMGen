    <pre>First, let&#39;s identify the given data:
- Initial state vector |ψ⟩ = (-1, 2, 1)^T
- Operator P:
  P = [[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]
- Operator Q:
  Q = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -1]]

Step 1: Normalize the initial state vector |ψ⟩.
Norm = sqrt((-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(1 + 4 + 1) = sqrt(6)
Normalized |ψ⟩ = (-1/√6, 2/√6, 1/√6)

Step 2: Find eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P to find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0.
We need the eigenvector |p_0⟩ such that P|p_0⟩ = 0|p_0⟩.

Step 3: Solve (P - 0*I)|p_0⟩ = 0
P = [[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]
Let |p_0⟩ = (x, y, z)^T
Then:
0*x + (1/√2)*y + 0*z = 0 =&gt; (1/√2)*y = 0 =&gt; y = 0
(1/√2)*x + 0*y + (1/√2)*z = 0 =&gt; (1/√2)*x + (1/√2)*z = 0 =&gt; x = -z
0*x + (1/√2)*y + 0*z = 0 =&gt; same as first, y=0
So eigenvector for eigenvalue 0 is |p_0⟩ = (x, 0, z) with x = -z
Choose z=1, then x = -1
So |p_0⟩ = (-1, 0, 1)^T
Normalize |p_0⟩:
Norm = sqrt((-1)^2 + 0 + 1^2) = sqrt(2)
Normalized |p_0⟩ = (-1/√2, 0, 1/√2)

Step 4: Probability of getting 0 for P when measuring |ψ⟩ is |⟨p_0|ψ⟩|^2
⟨p_0|ψ⟩ = (-1/√2)*(-1/√6) + 0*(2/√6) + (1/√2)*(1/√6) = (1/√2√6) + 0 + (1/√2√6) = 2/(√2√6) = 2/√12 = 2/(2*√3) = 1/√3
Therefore, probability P(0) = |1/√3|^2 = 1/3

Step 5: After measuring P and obtaining 0, the state collapses to |p_0⟩

Step 6: Now measure Q on |p_0⟩.
Eigenvalues of Q are 1, 0, -1 with eigenvectors:
- For 1: (1,0,0)
- For 0: (0,1,0)
- For -1: (0,0,1)

We want the probability of getting -1 for Q which corresponds to eigenvector |q_{-1}⟩ = (0, 0, 1)^T

Probability of getting -1 for Q after collapse to |p_0⟩ is |⟨q_{-1}|p_0⟩|^2
⟨q_{-1}|p_0⟩ = (0, 0, 1)⋅(-1/√2, 0, 1/√2) = 1/√2
Probability = |1/√2|^2 = 1/2

Step 7: The total probability of getting 0 for P and then -1 for Q is the product of the two probabilities:
(1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6

Therefore, the answer is 1/6, which corresponds to choice B).
