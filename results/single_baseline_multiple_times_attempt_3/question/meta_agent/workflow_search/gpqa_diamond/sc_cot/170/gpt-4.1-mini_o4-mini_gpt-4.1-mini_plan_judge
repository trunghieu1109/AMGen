Question: Example(question='Substances 1-6 undergo an electrophilic substitution reaction with an excess of bromine (it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed):\n1) С6H5-CH3\n2) C6H5-COOC2H5\n3) C6H5-Cl\n4) C6H5-NO2\n5) C6H5-C2H5\n6) C6H5-COOH\nC6H5 - means benzene ring\nArrange the substances in order of increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer.', choice1='3<5<1<6<2<4', choice2='4<2<6<3<1<5', choice3='6<2<4<5<1<3', choice4='4<6<2<1<5<3', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: We need the weight (mole) fraction of the para-isomer for each substrate undergoing bromination. Para fractions roughly: nitrobenzene (very meta director) ≈5%; benzoic acid ≈12%; ethyl benzoate (ester) ≈25%; toluene ≈30%; ethylbenzene ≈35%; chlorobenzene ≈60–70%. Ordering these ascending: 4 (NO2)<6 (COOH)<2 (COOR)<1 (CH3)<5 (C2H5)<3 (Cl). This matches choice 4.
