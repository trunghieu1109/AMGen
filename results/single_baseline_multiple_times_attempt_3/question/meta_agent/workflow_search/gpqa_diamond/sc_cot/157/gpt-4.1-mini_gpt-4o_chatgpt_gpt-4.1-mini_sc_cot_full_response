Question: {'question': 'In an inactive state, a transcription factor subunit awaits an activation signal from the membrane phosphorylation cascade. Upon phosphorylation on the Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, shuttles into the nucleus, and serves in gene transcription. A missense mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. You observe that a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Which of the following molecular phenotypes is most likely observed in the presence of mutation Y?', 'choice1': 'loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype', 'choice2': 'protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype', 'choice3': 'protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele', 'choice4': 'change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype'}\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent MGzN', content='The question involves a transcription factor with a transactivation domain and a dimerization domain. Mutation Y is in the dimerization domain and is a dominant-negative mutation, which means it interferes with the function of the wild-type protein, likely by affecting dimerization. The presence of mutation Y would likely result in the inability of the transcription factor to form functional dimers, leading to a loss-of-function phenotype. Dominant-negative mutations often result in a loss-of-function phenotype because the mutant protein interferes with the function of the wild-type protein. Therefore, the most likely molecular phenotype is protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype.\n\nAnswer:B)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
