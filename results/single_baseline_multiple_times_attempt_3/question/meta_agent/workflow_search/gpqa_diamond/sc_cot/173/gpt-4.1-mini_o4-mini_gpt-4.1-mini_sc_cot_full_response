Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent rkYI', content='The initial mass‐energy is 300 GeV. After fission the two fragments have rest masses m1=2m2 and m1+m2=0.99M. Hence m2=99 GeV, m1=198 GeV, and the Q‐value is 300−297=3 GeV. Classically, T1_cl=Q·m2/(m1+m2)=3 GeV·(99/297)=1 GeV=1000 MeV. Relativistically, in the CM frame E1+E2=300 GeV and E1−E2=(m1²−m2²)/(E1+E2)=29403/300≈98.01 GeV, so E1=(300+98.01)/2≈199.005 GeV giving T1_rel≈199.005−198=1.005 GeV=1005 MeV. The difference is ≈5 MeV.\n\nAnswer:B)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
