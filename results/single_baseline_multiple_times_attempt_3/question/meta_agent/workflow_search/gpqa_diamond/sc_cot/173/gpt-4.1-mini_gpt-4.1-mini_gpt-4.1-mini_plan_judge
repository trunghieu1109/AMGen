Question: Example(question='An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. A spontaneous fission occurs in which it splits into two fragments (and nothing else), such that one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other (in terms of their rest-masses). The sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. \n\nKinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?\n\n(Ignore the electrons.)', choice1='10 MeV.', choice2='5 MeV.', choice3='2 MeV.', choice4='20 MeV.', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: Let the initial mass be M with rest energy 300 GeV. The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest masses m1 and m2, where m1 = 2m2 and m1 + m2 = 0.99M. Let m2 = m, then m1 = 2m and 3m = 0.99M => m = 0.33M and m1 = 0.66M. The mass defect is 0.01M, which converts to kinetic energy. Total kinetic energy T = (M - (m1 + m2))c^2 = 0.01Mc^2 = 0.01 * 300 GeV = 3 GeV. The fragments recoil with kinetic energies T1 and T2. Momentum conservation: p1 = -p2. Using relativistic energy-momentum relation, calculate exact T1. Then calculate T1 classically (T = p^2/2m). The difference between relativistic and classical T1 is required. Since the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV, the kinetic energies are split inversely proportional to masses. The classical calculation underestimates kinetic energy for relativistic speeds. The difference comes out to approximately 5 MeV after detailed calculations.
