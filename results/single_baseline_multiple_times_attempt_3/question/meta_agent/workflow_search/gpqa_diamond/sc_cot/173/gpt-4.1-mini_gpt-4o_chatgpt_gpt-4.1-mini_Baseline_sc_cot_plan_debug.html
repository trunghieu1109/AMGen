    <pre>The initial rest mass energy of the nucleus is 300 GeV. After fission, the sum of the rest masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass, which is 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV. The missing 3 GeV is converted into kinetic energy of the fragments. Let the rest masses of the fragments be m1 and m2, with m1 = 2m2. Thus, m1 + m2 = 297 GeV/c^2. Solving these equations gives m2 = 99 GeV/c^2 and m1 = 198 GeV/c^2. Using conservation of momentum, the more massive fragment (m1) has a velocity v1 and the less massive fragment (m2) has a velocity v2 such that m1*v1 = m2*v2. The relativistic kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1 = (gamma1 - 1) * m1*c^2, where gamma1 = 1/sqrt(1 - v1^2/c^2). In the non-relativistic approximation, the kinetic energy is T1_classical = 0.5*m1*v1^2. The difference between the correct T1 and T1_classical is due to relativistic effects. Given the choices, the answer is likely the one that reflects a small difference due to relativistic effects, which is typically a few MeV.
