    <pre>Let the initial mass be M with rest energy 300 GeV. The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest masses m1 and m2, where m1 = 2m2 and m1 + m2 = 0.99M. Let m2 = m, then m1 = 2m and 3m = 0.99M =&gt; m = 0.33M and m1 = 0.66M. The mass defect is 0.01M, which converts to kinetic energy. Total kinetic energy T = (M - (m1 + m2))c^2 = 0.01Mc^2 = 0.01 * 300 GeV = 3 GeV. The fragments recoil with kinetic energies T1 and T2. Momentum conservation: p1 = -p2. Using relativistic energy-momentum relation, calculate exact T1. Then calculate T1 classically (T = p^2/2m). The difference between relativistic and classical T1 is required. Since the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV, the kinetic energies are split inversely proportional to masses. The classical calculation underestimates kinetic energy for relativistic speeds. The difference comes out to approximately 5 MeV after detailed calculations.
