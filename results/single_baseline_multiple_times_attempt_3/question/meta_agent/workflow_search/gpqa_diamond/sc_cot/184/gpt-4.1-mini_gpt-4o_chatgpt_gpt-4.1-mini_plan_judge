Question: Example(question='Consider a system with Hamiltonian operator $H = \\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n}$. Here, $\\vec{n}$ is an arbitrary unit vector, $\\varepsilon $ is a constant of dimension energy, and components of $\\vec{\\sigma}$ are the Pauli spin matrices. What are the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator?\n', choice1='+ \\varepsilon, -\\varepsilon\n', choice2='+\\varepsilon \\hbar/2, - \\varepsilon \\hbar/2', choice3='+1, -1', choice4='+\\hbar/2, -\\hbar/2', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The Hamiltonian is given as H = ε \vec{σ}.\vec{n}, where \vec{σ} are the Pauli matrices and \vec{n} is a unit vector. The dot product \vec{σ}.\vec{n} is a 2x2 matrix that can be represented as a linear combination of the Pauli matrices. The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues of +1 and -1. Therefore, the eigenvalues of \vec{σ}.\vec{n} are +1 and -1. Since the Hamiltonian is ε times this matrix, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are ε(+1) and ε(-1), which are +ε and -ε.
