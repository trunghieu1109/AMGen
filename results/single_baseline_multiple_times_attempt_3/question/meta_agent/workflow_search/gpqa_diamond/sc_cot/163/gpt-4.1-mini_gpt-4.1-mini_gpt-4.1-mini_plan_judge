Question: Example(question='Astronomers are studying two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2. Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.', choice1='~ 0.4', choice2='~ 0.7', choice3='~ 0.6\n', choice4='~ 1.2', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The period of the binary system is given, and the radial velocity amplitudes for both stars in each system are given. The total mass of a binary system can be related to the orbital period and the velocity amplitudes using Kepler's third law and the mass function.

Given:
- System 1: Period P1 = 2 years, RV amplitudes K1 = 10 km/s and K2 = 5 km/s
- System 2: Period P2 = 1 year, RV amplitudes K1 = 15 km/s and K2 = 10 km/s

Step 1: Calculate the total mass of each system.

The total mass M_total is proportional to (P * (K1 + K2)^3), assuming circular orbits and edge-on inclination (since eclipses occur).

Using the formula derived from Kepler's third law and radial velocities:
M_total ∝ P * (K1 + K2)^3

Calculate for system 1:
P1 = 2 years
K1 + K2 = 10 + 5 = 15 km/s
M1 ∝ 2 * (15)^3 = 2 * 3375 = 6750

Calculate for system 2:
P2 = 1 year
K1 + K2 = 15 + 10 = 25 km/s
M2 ∝ 1 * (25)^3 = 1 * 15625 = 15625

Step 2: Find the ratio M1 / M2:
M1 / M2 = 6750 / 15625 ≈ 0.432

Step 3: Compare with the given choices:
~0.4 is the closest to 0.432.

Therefore, system_1 is about 0.4 times as massive as system_2, meaning system_1 is less massive than system_2 by a factor of about 0.4.
