Question: {'question': 'Astronomers are studying two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2. Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.', 'choice1': '~ 0.4', 'choice2': '~ 0.7', 'choice3': '~ 0.6\n', 'choice4': '~ 1.2'}\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent fldN', content='We want the ratio of total masses M1/M2 for the two binaries. For each circular, edge‐on system, the total mass M∝a^3/P^2 with a=(P/(2π))(K1+K2). Hence M∝(K1+K2)^3P.   \nSystem_1: K1+K2=10+5=15\u2009km/s, P1=2\u2009yr.  System_2: K1+K2=15+10=25\u2009km/s, P2=1\u2009yr.  \nThus M1/M2=[(15)^3·2]/[(25)^3·1]=6750/15625≈0.432≈0.4, corresponding to choice A).\n\nAnswer:A)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
