Question: Example(question='Astronomers are studying two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2. Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.', choice1='~ 0.4', choice2='~ 0.7', choice3='~ 0.6\n', choice4='~ 1.2', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: To determine the ratio of the masses of the two systems, we need to use Kepler's third law and the information about the radial velocity amplitudes. For a binary star system, the mass function is given by f(M) = (P * (K1 + K2)^3) / (2 * pi * G), where P is the period, K1 and K2 are the radial velocity amplitudes, and G is the gravitational constant. The sum of the masses of the two stars is related to the period and the radial velocity amplitudes. For system_1, P1 = 2 years, K1_1 = 10 km/s, K2_1 = 5 km/s. For system_2, P2 = 1 year, K1_2 = 15 km/s, K2_2 = 10 km/s. The ratio of the total masses M1/M2 = (P1/P2) * ((K1_1 + K2_1)/(K1_2 + K2_2))^3. Substituting the values, we get M1/M2 = (2/1) * ((10 + 5)/(15 + 10))^3 = 2 * (15/25)^3 = 2 * (3/5)^3 = 2 * 27/125 = 54/125 = 0.432. Therefore, system_1 is approximately 0.4 times as massive as system_2.
