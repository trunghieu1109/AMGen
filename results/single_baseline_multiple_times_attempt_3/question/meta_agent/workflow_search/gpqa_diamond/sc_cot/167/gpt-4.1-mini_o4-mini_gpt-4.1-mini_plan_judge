Question: Example(question='Which of the following issues are the most common sources of difficult-to-spot erroneous results generated in genomics data analysis:\n\n- Mutually incompatible data formats\n- The "chr" / "no chr" confusion\n- Reference assembly mismatch\n- Incorrect ID conversion', choice1='3 and 4', choice2='2 and 3', choice3='All of the above', choice4='2, 3 and 4', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: We assess common insidious issues in genomics pipelines: ‘chr’/’no chr’ mismatches, reference genome assembly mismatches, and ID conversion errors (e.g. Excel auto‐convert) are notorious for silent errors. Mutually incompatible data formats can break pipelines visibly but are less likely to produce subtle, undetected errors. Thus the top three are issues 2, 3, and 4.
