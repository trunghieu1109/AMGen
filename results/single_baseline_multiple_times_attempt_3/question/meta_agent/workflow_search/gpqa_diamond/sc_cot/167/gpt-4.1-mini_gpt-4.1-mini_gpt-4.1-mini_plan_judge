Question: Example(question='Which of the following issues are the most common sources of difficult-to-spot erroneous results generated in genomics data analysis:\n\n- Mutually incompatible data formats\n- The "chr" / "no chr" confusion\n- Reference assembly mismatch\n- Incorrect ID conversion', choice1='3 and 4', choice2='2 and 3', choice3='All of the above', choice4='2, 3 and 4', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The question lists four common issues in genomics data analysis that can cause difficult-to-spot errors: incompatible data formats, 'chr' / 'no chr' confusion, reference assembly mismatch, and incorrect ID conversion. All of these are known sources of errors in genomics workflows. Therefore, the best choice is the one that includes all these issues, which is 'All of the above'.
