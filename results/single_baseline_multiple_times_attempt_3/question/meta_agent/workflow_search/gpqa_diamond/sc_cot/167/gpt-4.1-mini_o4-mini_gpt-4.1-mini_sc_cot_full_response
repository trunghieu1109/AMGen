Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent mPTt', content='We assess common insidious issues in genomics pipelines: ‘chr’/’no chr’ mismatches, reference genome assembly mismatches, and ID conversion errors (e.g. Excel auto‐convert) are notorious for silent errors. Mutually incompatible data formats can break pipelines visibly but are less likely to produce subtle, undetected errors. Thus the top three are issues 2, 3, and 4.\n\nAnswer:D)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
