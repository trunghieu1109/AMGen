Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 5Iw6', content="The spherical conductor is uncharged and has a cavity inside it. A charge +q is placed inside the cavity. Since the conductor is a perfect conductor, the charge inside the cavity induces charges on the inner surface of the cavity and the outer surface of the conductor such that the total conductor remains neutral, and the field inside the conductor's material is zero. Outside the conductor, the entire conductor with the cavity and the charge inside behaves as if all the charge +q is concentrated at the center of the spherical conductor, because the conductor shields the field inside and outside behaves as if the total charge is at the center. Therefore, the electric field at a point outside the conductor at distance L from the center of the conductor is the same as that due to a point charge +q at the center of the conductor. Hence, the magnitude of E at point P is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q / L²).\n\nAnswer:D)", prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
