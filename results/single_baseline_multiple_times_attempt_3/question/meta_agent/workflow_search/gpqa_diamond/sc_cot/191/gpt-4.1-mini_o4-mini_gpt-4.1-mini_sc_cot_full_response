Question: {'question': 'Imagine an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ having a small spherical cavity inside. The centre of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the centre of the spherical conductor. The radius of the cavity is $r$, and $r<R$. Now consider a small amount of positive charge $+q$ is somehow placed somewhere inside the cavity. What is the magnitude of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at a point P (outside the spherical conductor) of distance $L$ from the centre of the spherical conductor? Note, the distance of the point P from the centre of the cavity is $l$. Here, l, L > R.

Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent Iw6I', content='We have an isolated uncharged conductor containing an off-center cavity with charge +q inside. The induced charge on the cavity surface is –q and on the outer surface is +q. By Gauss’s law, outside the conductor the field is that of a point charge +q at the sphere’s center, regardless of the cavity’s off-center position. Thus E = (1/4πε0) q/L^2.\n\nAnswer:D)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
