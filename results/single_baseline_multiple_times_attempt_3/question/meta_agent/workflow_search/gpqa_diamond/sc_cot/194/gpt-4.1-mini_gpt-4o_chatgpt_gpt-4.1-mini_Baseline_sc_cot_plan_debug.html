    <pre>To determine the maximum orbital period of a second planet that will exhibit both transit and occultation events, we need to consider the geometry of the system. The first planet has a transit impact parameter of 0.2, meaning its orbit is slightly inclined but still transits the star. The second planet must also transit, which means its orbit must have an impact parameter less than 1. The orbital period of a planet is related to its semi-major axis by Kepler&#39;s third law, and the semi-major axis determines the impact parameter. Since the second planet shares the same orbital plane, it will have the same inclination. The maximum orbital period occurs when the impact parameter is just less than 1. The impact parameter is related to the semi-major axis and the stellar radius. Since the star&#39;s radius is 1.5 times that of the Sun, we can use the ratio of the semi-major axes to find the ratio of the orbital periods. The first planet has an orbital period of 3 days and an impact parameter of 0.2. To ensure the second planet also transits, its period must be such that its impact parameter is less than 1. Using the formula for impact parameter and the fact that the inclination is the same, we find that the maximum period is approximately 33.5 days.
