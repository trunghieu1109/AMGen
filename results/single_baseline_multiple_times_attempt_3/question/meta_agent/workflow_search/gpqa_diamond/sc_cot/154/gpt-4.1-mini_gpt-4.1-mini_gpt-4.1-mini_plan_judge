Question: Example(question='Imagine an operator $\\vec{P}$ of a system have components $P_x, P_y$ and $P_z$. The matrix form of the  operator $P_x$ has components in the first row as $(0, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,\\hbar/\\sqrt{2},0)$.  The matrix form of the  operator $P_y$ has components in the first row as $(0, -i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0, -i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2},0)$. Similarly, matrix form of the  operator $P_z$ has components in the first row as $(\\hbar, 0, 0)$, that in the second row as $(0, 0, 0)$ and that in the third row as $(0,0, -\\hbar)$. The basis vectors here are the eigenvectors of $P_z$. The system is found in the eigenstate of $P_x$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$. To be more specific, the explicit form of the state of the system is given by the column vector having elements $(-1/2, 1/\\sqrt{2}, -1/2)$. What is the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z $ of $P_z$', choice1='\\hbar\n', choice2='\\hbar/2', choice3='\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}\n', choice4='\\sqrt{2}\\hbar', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: Given the state vector |ψ> = (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2) in the P_z eigenbasis, we want to find the uncertainty ΔP_z. The operator P_z is diagonal with eigenvalues (ħ, 0, -ħ). First, compute the expectation value <P_z> = ψ† P_z ψ. Then compute <P_z^2> = ψ† P_z^2 ψ. The uncertainty is ΔP_z = sqrt(<P_z^2> - <P_z>^2). Calculating <P_z>: (-1/2)*ħ*(-1/2) + (1/√2)*0*(1/√2) + (-1/2)*(-ħ)*(-1/2) = (1/4)ħ + 0 + (1/4)(-ħ) = (1/4)ħ - (1/4)ħ = 0. Calculating <P_z^2>: eigenvalues squared are (ħ^2, 0, ħ^2), so <P_z^2> = (1/4)ħ^2 + 0 + (1/4)ħ^2 = (1/2)ħ^2. Therefore, ΔP_z = sqrt((1/2)ħ^2 - 0) = ħ/√2.
