Question: Example(question='Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are\nconstrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system\ncorrect to three decimals?', choice1='2.822 x 10^-26', choice2='5.645 x 10^-26', choice3='7.056 x 10^-27', choice4='122.330', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: To find the minimum energy of the system, we need to calculate the potential energy due to the electrostatic forces between the charges. There are 12 charges at a distance of 2 m from the 13th charge at point P. Each charge has a charge of 2e, where e is the elementary charge (e = 1.602 x 10^-19 C). The potential energy between two point charges is given by U = k * q1 * q2 / r, where k is Coulomb's constant (k = 8.988 x 10^9 N m^2/C^2), q1 and q2 are the charges, and r is the distance between them. In this case, q1 = q2 = 2e, and r = 2 m. Therefore, the potential energy between one of the 12 charges and the charge at P is U = (8.988 x 10^9) * (2 * 1.602 x 10^-19)^2 / 2. There are 12 such interactions, so the total potential energy is 12 times this value. Calculating this gives the total energy of the system.
