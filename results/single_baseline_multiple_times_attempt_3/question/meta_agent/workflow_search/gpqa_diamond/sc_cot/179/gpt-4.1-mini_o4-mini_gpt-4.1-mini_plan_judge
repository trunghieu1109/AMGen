Question: Example(question='Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are\nconstrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system\ncorrect to three decimals?', choice1='2.822 x 10^-26', choice2='5.645 x 10^-26', choice3='7.056 x 10^-27', choice4='122.330', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: We have 13 identical particles each with charge q=2e. One charge at P (center), 12 on a sphere of radius R=2 m minimizing their mutual repulsion as vertices of a regular icosahedron. Total energy U=U_center–outer + U_outer–outer. 

1) U_center–outer: 12 interactions at distance R. 
   q=2e=3.204×10^−19 C, q^2=1.0268×10^−37 C^2. 
   k=8.98755×10^9 N·m^2/C^2. 
   U_co=12·k·q^2/R=12·(8.98755×10^9·1.0268×10^−37/2)
        ≈12·4.613×10^−28=5.536×10^−27 J. 

2) U_outer–outer: 12 charges on sphere, minimal Thomson energy. For an icosahedron on unit sphere, sum over pairs ∑1/rij =30·(1/a)+30·(1/d2)+6·(1/2) ≈30·0.950+30·0.588+6·0.5=49.14. 
   Scale by k·q^2/R=4.613×10^−28 J. 
   U_oo=4.613×10^−28·49.14=2.267×10^−26 J. 

Total U≈2.267×10^−26+0.554×10^−26=2.822×10^−26 J (to three decimals: 2.822×10^−26 J).
