Question: Example(question='In a specific region of the sky, astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?', choice1='~ r^2', choice2='~ r^4', choice3='~ r^3', choice4='~ r^5', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: We have observed number of stars per parallax interval: N(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5. Parallax relates to distance as plx = 1/r (in consistent units). Therefore N(plx) ∝ (r)^5. To find the number per unit distance, use N(r) dr = N(plx) d(plx). Since d(plx)/dr = -1/r^2, we have |d(plx)| = dr/r^2. Thus N(r) ∝ r^5 × (1/r^2) = r^3. Hence the number of stars per unit distance scales as r^3.
