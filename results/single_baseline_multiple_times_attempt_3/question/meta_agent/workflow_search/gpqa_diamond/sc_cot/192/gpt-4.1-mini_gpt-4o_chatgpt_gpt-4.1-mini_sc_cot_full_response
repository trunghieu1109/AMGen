Question: {'question': 'In a specific region of the sky, astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?', 'choice1': '~ r^2', 'choice2': '~ r^4', 'choice3': '~ r^3', 'choice4': '~ r^5'}\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent QNME', content='Parallax, plx, is inversely proportional to distance, r, such that plx = 1/r. Therefore, 1/plx = r. Given that the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5, we can substitute to find that the number of stars varies as r^5. Hence, the number of stars in that region of the sky changes with distance as r^5.\n\nAnswer:D)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
