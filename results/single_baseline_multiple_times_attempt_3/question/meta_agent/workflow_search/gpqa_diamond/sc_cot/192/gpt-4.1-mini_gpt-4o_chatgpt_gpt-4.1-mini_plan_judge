Question: Example(question='In a specific region of the sky, astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?', choice1='~ r^2', choice2='~ r^4', choice3='~ r^3', choice4='~ r^5', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: Parallax, plx, is inversely proportional to distance, r, such that plx = 1/r. Therefore, 1/plx = r. Given that the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5, we can substitute to find that the number of stars varies as r^5. Hence, the number of stars in that region of the sky changes with distance as r^5.
