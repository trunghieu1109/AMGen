Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent NMET', content='We have observed number of stars per parallax interval: N(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5. Parallax relates to distance as plx = 1/r (in consistent units). Therefore N(plx) ∝ (r)^5. To find the number per unit distance, use N(r) dr = N(plx) d(plx). Since d(plx)/dr = -1/r^2, we have |d(plx)| = dr/r^2. Thus N(r) ∝ r^5 × (1/r^2) = r^3. Hence the number of stars per unit distance scales as r^3.\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
