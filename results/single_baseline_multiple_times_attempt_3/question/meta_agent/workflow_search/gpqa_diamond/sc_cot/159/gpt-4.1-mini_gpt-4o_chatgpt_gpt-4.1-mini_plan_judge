Question: Example(question='Consider an aperture, which shapes like a N-sided polygon. All the apothems are of the same length a. When a monochromatic light (of wavelength \\lambda), travelling along z-axis, falls vertically on this aperture, it creates a series of intensity maxima and minima in the far field region. What is the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large ? Assume that the related angles are small so that tan theta = theta approximation can be taken.', choice1='1.220 \\lambda /a ', choice2='0.610 \\lambda / a', choice3='0.500 \\lambda / a', choice4='0.506 \\lambda / a', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: When N is infinitely large, the N-sided polygon approaches the shape of a circle. The apothem of the polygon becomes the radius of the circle. In the context of diffraction patterns, a circular aperture produces a pattern known as the Airy disk pattern. The angular position of the first minimum in the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture is given by the formula \( \theta = 1.22 \frac{\lambda}{D} \), where \( D \) is the diameter of the aperture. However, in this problem, the apothem (which is half the diameter for a circle) is given as \( a \). Therefore, the diameter \( D = 2a \). The angular distance between the first two minima in the diffraction pattern corresponds to the distance between the first minimum and the second minimum. For a circle, the first minimum occurs at \( \theta_1 = 1.22 \frac{\lambda}{D} \) and the second minimum occurs at \( \theta_2 = 2.23 \frac{\lambda}{D} \). The angular distance between these two minima is \( \theta_2 - \theta_1 = (2.23 - 1.22) \frac{\lambda}{D} = 1.01 \frac{\lambda}{D} \). Substituting \( D = 2a \), we get \( 1.01 \frac{\lambda}{2a} = 0.505 \frac{\lambda}{a} \). However, this is not exactly matching any of the given choices. The closest choice is \( 0.506 \frac{\lambda}{a} \).
