Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent sUdM', content='As N→∞ the aperture becomes a circular aperture of diameter D=2a. The minima of the far‐field (Airy) pattern occur at angles θn satisfying J1 zeros: θn≈xn·λ/(πD). The first two zeros are x1≈3.8317 and x2≈7.0156, giving θ1≈(3.8317λ)/(π·2a)=0.610λ/a and θ2≈(7.0156λ)/(π·2a)=1.116λ/a. The angular separation Δθ=θ2−θ1≈(1.116−0.610)λ/a=0.506λ/a.\n\nAnswer:D)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
