Question: Example(question='Consider an aperture, which shapes like a N-sided polygon. All the apothems are of the same length a. When a monochromatic light (of wavelength \\lambda), travelling along z-axis, falls vertically on this aperture, it creates a series of intensity maxima and minima in the far field region. What is the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large ? Assume that the related angles are small so that tan theta = theta approximation can be taken.', choice1='1.220 \\lambda /a ', choice2='0.610 \\lambda / a', choice3='0.500 \\lambda / a', choice4='0.506 \\lambda / a', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: As N approaches infinity, the N-sided polygon approaches a circle with radius equal to the apothem a. The diffraction pattern of a circular aperture is characterized by the Airy pattern, where the first minimum occurs at an angle \theta given by 1.22 \lambda / D, where D is the diameter of the aperture. Here, the apothem a corresponds to the radius of the circle, so the diameter D = 2a. Therefore, the angular position of the first minimum is \theta_1 = 1.22 \lambda / (2a) = 0.61 \lambda / a. The question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima. For a circular aperture, the minima are given by zeros of the Bessel function, and the first minimum is at 1.22 \lambda / D, the second minimum is at about 2.23 \lambda / D. The angular distance between the first two minima is (2.23 - 1.22) \lambda / D = 1.01 \lambda / D = 1.01 \lambda / (2a) = 0.505 \lambda / a. Among the options, 0.506 \lambda / a is closest to this value.
