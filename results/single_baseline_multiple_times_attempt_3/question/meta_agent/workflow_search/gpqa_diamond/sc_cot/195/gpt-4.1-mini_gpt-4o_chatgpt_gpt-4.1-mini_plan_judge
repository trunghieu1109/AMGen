proposed answer: To find the maximum speed of a relativistic harmonic oscillator, we need to consider the energy conservation in the system. In a non-relativistic harmonic oscillator, the maximum kinetic energy is when the potential energy is zero, which is at the equilibrium position x = 0. The energy is given by E = T + V, where T is the kinetic energy and V is the potential energy. In the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is given by T = (γ - 1)mc^2, where γ = 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) is the Lorentz factor. The potential energy is V = (1/2)kA^2 at the maximum amplitude A. At the point of maximum speed, all the energy is kinetic, so (γ - 1)mc^2 = (1/2)kA^2. Solving for v_max, we find that γ = 1 + (kA^2)/(2mc^2). Therefore, 1/sqrt(1 - v_max^2/c^2) = 1 + (kA^2)/(2mc^2). Solving for v_max, we get v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA^2)/(2mc^2))^2). This corresponds to choice B.
