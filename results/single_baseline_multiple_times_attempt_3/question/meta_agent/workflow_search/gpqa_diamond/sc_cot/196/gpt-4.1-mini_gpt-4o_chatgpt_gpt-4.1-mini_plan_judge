Identify the final product.\nIR: 3400â€“2500 cm-1, 1720 cm-1, 1610 cm-1, 1450 cm-1\n1H NMR: 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H), 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H), 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).', choice1='1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene', choice2='4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid', choice3='2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid', choice4='1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The IR data shows a broad peak from 3400-2500 cm-1, which is characteristic of an O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid. The peak at 1720 cm-1 indicates a C=O stretch, also consistent with a carboxylic acid. The peak at 1610 cm-1 suggests an aromatic C=C stretch. The 1H NMR data shows a broad singlet at 10.5 ppm, which is typical for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid. The peaks at 8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm are indicative of aromatic protons, likely in a para-disubstituted benzene due to the pattern (two doublets). The peaks at 2.9 ppm, 1.7 ppm, 1.4 ppm, and 0.9 ppm suggest an alkyl side chain, possibly a sec-butyl group. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI typically reduces carboxylic acids to alkyl iodides, removing the carboxylic acid group. Choice 2, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, fits the IR and NMR data as it has a carboxylic acid and a sec-butyl group attached to a benzene ring. After reaction with red phosphorus and HI, the carboxylic acid group would be reduced to an alkane, resulting in 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.
