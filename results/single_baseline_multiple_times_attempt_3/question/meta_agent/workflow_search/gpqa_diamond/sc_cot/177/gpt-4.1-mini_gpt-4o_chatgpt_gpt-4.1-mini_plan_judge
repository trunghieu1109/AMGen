proposed answer: The Lagrangian given is \( \mathcal{L}_{int}=\kappa\bar{\psi}\sigma_{\mu\nu}\psi F^{\mu\nu} \). To find the mass dimension of \( \kappa \), we need to determine the mass dimensions of each component. \( \psi \) is a Dirac field with mass dimension \( \frac{3}{2} \). \( \bar{\psi} \) also has mass dimension \( \frac{3}{2} \). \( \sigma_{\mu\nu} \) is a combination of gamma matrices, which are dimensionless. \( F^{\mu\nu} \) is the electromagnetic field strength tensor with mass dimension 2. The Lagrangian density \( \mathcal{L} \) has mass dimension 4. Therefore, the mass dimension of the term \( \bar{\psi}\sigma_{\mu\nu}\psi F^{\mu\nu} \) must also be 4. Calculating the mass dimensions: \( [\bar{\psi}] + [\psi] + [F^{\mu\nu}] = \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} + 2 = 5 \). To compensate, \( \kappa \) must have mass dimension \( 4 - 5 = -1 \). Regarding renormalizability, a theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have positive or zero mass dimension. Since \( \kappa \) has negative mass dimension, the theory is not renormalizable.
