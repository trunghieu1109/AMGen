proposed answer: First, let's analyze the mass dimensions of the fields and terms in the Lagrangian. In 4-dimensional spacetime, the mass dimension of the Lagrangian density \mathcal{L} is 4. The fermion field \psi has mass dimension 3/2. The field strength tensor F^{\mu\nu} has mass dimension 2. The sigma matrix \sigma_{\mu\nu} is dimensionless. The term \bar{\psi}\sigma_{\mu\nu}\psi F^{\mu\nu} thus has mass dimension (3/2) + 0 + (3/2) + 2 = 7. Since the total dimension of the Lagrangian is 4, the coupling constant \kappa must have mass dimension 4 - 7 = -3. However, this contradicts the options given, so let's re-express carefully: \bar{\psi} has dimension 3/2, \psi has 3/2, so \bar{\psi}\sigma_{\mu\nu}\psi has dimension 3/2 + 3/2 = 3, and F^{\mu\nu} has dimension 2, so the product is 3 + 2 = 5. Then \kappa must have dimension 4 - 5 = -1. So \kappa has mass dimension -1. Since \kappa has negative mass dimension, this is a non-renormalizable coupling. Therefore, the correct choice is that \kappa has mass dimension -1 and the theory is not renormalizable.
