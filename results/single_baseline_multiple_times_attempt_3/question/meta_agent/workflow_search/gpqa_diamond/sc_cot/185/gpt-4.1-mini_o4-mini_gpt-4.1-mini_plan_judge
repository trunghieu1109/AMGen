Question: Example(question='Identify the possible product when (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene undergoes Cope rearrangement.', choice1='4,4a,7,7a-tetrahydro-1H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine', choice2='4,4a,5,7a-tetrahydro-3H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine', choice3='4,6,7,7a-tetrahydro-3H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine', choice4='4,4a,5,6-tetrahydro-1H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The N‐vinyl aza‐norbornene undergoes an aza‐Cope ([3,3] sigmatropic) rearrangement to open the bicyclic framework and give the cyclopenta[c]pyridine system with the cyclopentane ring fully saturated (four positions hydrogenated) and the pyridine partially unsaturated. This corresponds to the 4,5,6,7‐tetrahydro‐1H‐cyclopenta[c]pyridine skeleton, which in the given numbering is 4,4a,5,6‐tetrahydro‐1H‐cyclopenta[c]pyridine (choice D).
