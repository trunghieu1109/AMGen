Question: Example(question='Consider a rhombohedral crystal, with the interatomic distance of 10 Angstrom and the angles $\\quad\\alpha=\\beta=\\gamma=30^{0}$. What is the interplanar distance of the (111) plane of the crystal?\n', choice1='9.54 Angstrom', choice2='8.95 Angstrom', choice3='9.08 Angstrom', choice4='10.05 Angstrom', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal, we use the formula for the interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral lattice: d_hkl = a / sqrt(h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + kl + lh)cos(alpha)), where a is the lattice parameter and alpha is the angle between the axes. Here, a = 10 Angstrom and alpha = 30 degrees. For the (111) plane, h = k = l = 1. Plugging these values into the formula, we get: d_111 = 10 / sqrt(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 2(1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1)cos(30 degrees)). Cos(30 degrees) = sqrt(3)/2. So, d_111 = 10 / sqrt(3 + 3*sqrt(3)/2) = 10 / sqrt(3 + 1.5sqrt(3)). Calculating this gives approximately 9.08 Angstrom.
