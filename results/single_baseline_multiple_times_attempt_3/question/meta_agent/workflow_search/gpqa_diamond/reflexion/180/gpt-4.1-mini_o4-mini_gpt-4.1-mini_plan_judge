Question: Example(question='Very large number of neutrinos produced by the Sun reach the Earth (very large flux of neutrinos, defined as the number of neutrinos per cm^2, per second).\n\nLet us assume that, hypothetically, the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the core of the Sun about 8 and a half minutes ago, while all other reactions remained as they were.\n\nWhat would be the approximate ratio of the flux between two bands of neutrino energies of 700-800 KeV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). \n\nFlux (band 1) / flux (band 2) is:\n\n(Note: we are talking about stopping the pp-III branch, not pp-II, pp-I or any other. It’s not a typo or something like that.)\n(Note 2: solar neutrino flavor changes happen, but do not play a role here.)', choice1='0.1 (10^-1).', choice2='10.', choice3='1.', choice4='0.01 (10^-2).', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: We need neutrino fluxes in 700–800 and 800–900 keV after stopping the pp-III (^8B) branch. Band 1 gets mainly CNO neutrinos (~5×10^8 total flux spread up to ~1.7 MeV), so in a 100 keV slice around 700–800 keV we get ~3×10^7 cm⁻² s⁻¹. Band 2 gets the 7Be line at 862 keV (~4.8×10^9 cm⁻² s⁻¹) plus CNO (~3.7×10^7), so ~4.84×10^9. Ratio ≃3×10^7/4.84×10^9≃6×10^-3, i.e. ~10^-2.
