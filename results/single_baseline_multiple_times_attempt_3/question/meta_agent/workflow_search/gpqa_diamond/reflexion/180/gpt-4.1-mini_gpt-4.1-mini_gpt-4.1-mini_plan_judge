Question: Example(question='Very large number of neutrinos produced by the Sun reach the Earth (very large flux of neutrinos, defined as the number of neutrinos per cm^2, per second).\n\nLet us assume that, hypothetically, the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the core of the Sun about 8 and a half minutes ago, while all other reactions remained as they were.\n\nWhat would be the approximate ratio of the flux between two bands of neutrino energies of 700-800 KeV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). \n\nFlux (band 1) / flux (band 2) is:\n\n(Note: we are talking about stopping the pp-III branch, not pp-II, pp-I or any other. Itâ€™s not a typo or something like that.)\n(Note 2: solar neutrino flavor changes happen, but do not play a role here.)', choice1='0.1 (10^-1).', choice2='10.', choice3='1.', choice4='0.01 (10^-2).', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: The pp-III branch of the proton-proton chain in the Sun produces neutrinos with energies typically above 1 MeV, specifically from the decay of 8B (boron-8) neutrinos, which have energies up to about 15 MeV. The energy bands given are 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV, which are relatively low energy compared to the 8B neutrinos. The pp-III branch neutrinos are mostly in the higher energy range, so stopping the pp-III branch would mainly affect the high-energy neutrino flux, not the lower energy bands. The 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV bands are more likely dominated by neutrinos from the pp-I and pp-II branches, such as the pep neutrinos (~1.44 MeV) and 7Be neutrinos (~0.86 MeV). Since the pp-III branch is stopped, the flux in the 800-900 keV band (which may include some 7Be neutrinos) would remain roughly the same, and the 700-800 keV band would also remain roughly the same. Therefore, the ratio of flux (band 1) to flux (band 2) would be approximately 1. Hence, the answer is C) 1.
