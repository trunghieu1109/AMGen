proposed answer: First, let's analyze the mass dimensions of each component in the interaction Lagrangian \( \mathcal{L}_{int} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu} \).

1. The Lagrangian density \( \mathcal{L} \) in 4-dimensional spacetime has mass dimension 4.

2. The fermion field \( \psi \) has mass dimension \( \frac{3}{2} \).

3. The gamma matrices \( \gamma_\mu \) are dimensionless, so \( \sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu] \) is also dimensionless.

4. The field strength tensor \( F^{\mu\nu} \) has mass dimension 2.

Putting it all together:
- \( \bar{\psi} \) has dimension \( \frac{3}{2} \).
- \( \psi \) has dimension \( \frac{3}{2} \).
- \( \sigma_{\mu\nu} \) is dimensionless.
- \( F^{\mu\nu} \) has dimension 2.

So the product \( \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu} \) has dimension \( \frac{3}{2} + 0 + \frac{3}{2} + 2 = 3 + 2 = 5 \).

Since the Lagrangian density must have dimension 4, \( \kappa \) must have dimension \( 4 - 5 = -1 \).

A coupling constant with negative mass dimension indicates a non-renormalizable interaction.

Therefore, \( [\kappa]_M = -1 \) and the theory is not renormalizable.
