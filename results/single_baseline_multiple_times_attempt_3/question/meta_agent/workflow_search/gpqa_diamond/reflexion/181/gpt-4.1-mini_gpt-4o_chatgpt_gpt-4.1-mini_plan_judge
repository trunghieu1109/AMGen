Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The Mott-Gurney equation describes the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) in a semiconductor device. It is specifically applicable to a trap-free single-carrier device where the current is limited by the space charge of the carriers. For the equation to be valid, there should be no carrier injection barrier, meaning the contacts should be Ohmic, allowing carriers to be injected freely. Additionally, the diffusion current should be negligible compared to the drift current, which is the current described by the Mott-Gurney equation. Therefore, the correct statement should describe a trap-free single-carrier device with Ohmic contacts and negligible diffusion current.
