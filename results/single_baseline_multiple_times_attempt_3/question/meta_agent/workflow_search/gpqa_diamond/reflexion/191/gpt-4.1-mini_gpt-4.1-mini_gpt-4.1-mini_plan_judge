Question: Example(question='Imagine an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ having a small spherical cavity inside. The centre of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the centre of the spherical conductor. The radius of the cavity is $r$, and $r<R$. Now consider a small amount of positive charge $+q$ is somehow placed somewhere inside the cavity. What is the magnitude of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at a point P (outside the spherical conductor) of distance $L$ from the centre of the spherical conductor? Note, the distance of the point P from the centre of the cavity is $l$. Here, l, L > R.

proposed answer: The spherical conductor is uncharged and has a cavity inside it. A positive charge +q is placed inside the cavity. Since the conductor is uncharged and the charge is inside the cavity, the conductor will rearrange its charges on the outer surface to ensure the electric field inside the conductor's material is zero. However, outside the conductor, the conductor behaves like a neutral object with no net charge. The charge +q inside the cavity induces charges on the cavity surface, but these induced charges do not affect the field outside the conductor. From outside the conductor, the net charge enclosed is zero because the conductor is neutral and the charge +q inside is shielded by the conductor. Therefore, the electric field at a point P outside the spherical conductor (distance L > R) is zero. However, the problem asks for the magnitude of the electric field at point P outside the conductor due to the charge +q inside the cavity. Since the conductor shields the field, the field outside is zero. But if the conductor were not present, the field at point P due to charge +q located inside the cavity at a distance l from P would be E = (1/4πε₀) * q / l². But since the conductor shields the field, the field outside is zero. However, the problem seems to suggest that the field outside is as if the charge +q is at the center of the conductor or not. Actually, the conductor shields the field, so the field outside is zero. But if the conductor is uncharged and the charge +q is inside the cavity, the field outside the conductor is zero. Therefore, none of the options given match zero field. Alternatively, if the conductor is grounded or isolated, the field outside is as if the charge +q is at the center of the conductor, or the field is zero. Given the options, the only plausible answer is that the field outside is as if the charge +q is at the center of the conductor, so E = (1/4πε₀) * q / L², which is choice 4. Therefore, the answer is D).
