Question: Example(question='Observations of a quasar across the electromagnetic spectrum are being carried out. Focusing on the near infrared and optical spectrum, there is a peak at wavelength of about 790 nm, and at shorter wavelengths < 790 nm the flux drops significantly.\n\nIf we lived in a universe defined by Lambda-CDM model such that the current Hubble constant is 70 km s^-1 Mpc^-1, matter density parameter is 0.3, dark energy density parameter is 0.7, and universe is flat,\nwhat can be assumed about the value of the comoving distance (for scale factor a=1) of this quasar from the Earth?', choice1='8 Gpc', choice2='9 Gpc', choice3='7 Gpc', choice4='6 Gpc', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The sharp drop at λ_obs≈790 nm is the redshifted Lyman-α break (rest λ=121.6 nm), so z≈(790/121.6)−1≈5.5. In ΛCDM with H₀=70 km/s/Mpc, Ωₘ=0.3, Ω_Λ=0.7, the comoving distance to z=5.5 is ≈8 Gpc.
