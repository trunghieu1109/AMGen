Question: Example(question='An electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Find the expectation value of its spin along y-direction, S_y.\nNote: \\sigma_y (in latex format) is: \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & -i \\\\\ni & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}', choice1='-25*hbar/2\n\n', choice2='-12*hbar/25\n\n', choice3='12*hbar/25', choice4='25*hbar/2\n', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The spin state is |psi> = (3i, 4). The norm squared is |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = 9 + 16 = 25, so the normalized state is (3i/5, 4/5). The operator S_y = (hbar/2) * sigma_y, where sigma_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Calculate sigma_y |psi>: sigma_y * (3i, 4)^T = (-4i, 3i^2)^T = (-4i, -3)^T. Then <psi| sigma_y |psi> = (3i)* * (-4i) + 4* * (-3) = (-3i conjugate) * (-4i) + 4 * (-3) = (3i) * (-4i) - 12 = 12 - 12 = 0. Normalizing divides by 25, so expectation value remains zero. Therefore, <S_y> = (hbar/2) * 0 = 0. None of the options match zero, so none are correct. Since the question requires choosing an option, the correct physical answer is zero, but no option corresponds to zero. Hence, no correct choice is given.
