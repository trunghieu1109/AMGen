Question: Example(question='Which of the following issues are the most common sources of difficult-to-spot erroneous results generated in genomics data analysis:\n\n- Mutually incompatible data formats\n- The "chr" / "no chr" confusion\n- Reference assembly mismatch\n- Incorrect ID conversion', choice1='3 and 4', choice2='2 and 3', choice3='All of the above', choice4='2, 3 and 4', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: We need to identify which issues are the most common sources of difficult-to-spot erroneous results in genomics data analysis. Mutually incompatible data formats often cause immediate, obvious errors (e.g., program crashes or parse failures), so they are less “difficult-to-spot.” The subtler pitfalls are:
1. “chr”/“no chr” confusion — many pipelines assume or strip the “chr” prefix, leading to silent mismatches.
2. Reference assembly mismatch — using coordinates from different genome builds can silently misalign variants.
3. Incorrect ID conversion — gene or transcript IDs change over time or between databases, leading to silent misannotations.
Thus, the common subtle errors are issues 2, 3, and 4. That corresponds to choice4, which is option D).
