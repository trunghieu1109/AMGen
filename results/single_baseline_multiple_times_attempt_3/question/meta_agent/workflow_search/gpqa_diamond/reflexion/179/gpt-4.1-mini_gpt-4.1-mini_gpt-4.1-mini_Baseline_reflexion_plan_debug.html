    <pre>We have 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e (where e = 1.6 x 10^-19 C). 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from point P, and the 13th charge is fixed at P. We want the minimum energy of this system. The system consists of 12 charges on a sphere of radius 2 m around P, and one charge at P. The potential energy comes from the interactions between all pairs of charges. The total potential energy U is the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges: U = k * sum(q_i * q_j / r_ij), where k = 1/(4πε_0) ≈ 8.99 x 10^9 N·m²/C². Each charge q = 2e = 2 * 1.6 x 10^-19 C = 3.2 x 10^-19 C. The 13th charge at P interacts with each of the 12 charges at distance 2 m. The potential energy for each such pair is U_p = k * q^2 / r = 8.99 x 10^9 * (3.2 x 10^-19)^2 / 2. Calculate this: (3.2 x 10^-19)^2 = 10.24 x 10^-38 = 1.024 x 10^-37. So U_p = 8.99 x 10^9 * 1.024 x 10^-37 / 2 = (8.99 x 10^9 / 2) * 1.024 x 10^-37 = 4.495 x 10^9 * 1.024 x 10^-37 = approximately 4.6 x 10^-28 J per pair. There are 12 such pairs, so total energy from center charge interactions: 12 * 4.6 x 10^-28 = 5.52 x 10^-27 J. Next, consider the interactions among the 12 charges on the sphere. The minimum energy configuration for 12 identical charges on a sphere is the solution to the Thomson problem. The total potential energy among these 12 charges is U_sphere = k * q^2 * sum(1/r_ij) over all pairs i&lt;j. The exact sum depends on the configuration, but the average distance between charges on a sphere of radius 2 m is on the order of the chord length between points. The number of pairs among 12 charges is 12*11/2 = 66. If we approximate the average distance between charges as roughly the chord length between points on the sphere, which is about 2 m (since the sphere radius is 2 m), then the potential energy per pair is roughly U_pair = k * q^2 / r ≈ 8.99 x 10^9 * 1.024 x 10^-37 / 2 = 4.6 x 10^-28 J (same as above). Multiply by 66 pairs: 66 * 4.6 x 10^-28 = 3.036 x 10^-26 J. Total energy U_total = energy from center charge + energy from sphere charges = 5.52 x 10^-27 + 3.036 x 10^-26 = approximately 3.6 x 10^-26 J. Among the choices, 2.822 x 10^-26 and 5.645 x 10^-26 are close. Our rough estimate is closer to 2.822 x 10^-26. Therefore, the minimum energy is approximately 2.822 x 10^-26 J, choice A.
