Question: Example(question='Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are\nconstrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system\ncorrect to three decimals?', choice1='2.822 x 10^-26', choice2='5.645 x 10^-26', choice3='7.056 x 10^-27', choice4='122.330', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: We have one charge q at center P and 12 charges q on a sphere of radius R=2 m. All charges are 2e, so q=2e. Total electrostatic energy U = sum over pairs k q_i q_j/r_ij. Split into center–outer and outer–outer interactions. 1) Center–outer: 12 identical pairs at distance R, so U_co =12·k q^2/R =12·k·(2e)^2/2 =6 k (2e)^2 =6 k 4e^2 =24 k e^2. 2) Outer–outer: minimal arrangement for 12 charges on a sphere is the vertices of a regular icosahedron. Distinct pair distances: 30 edges at r1=1.05146 R, 30 second‐nearest at r2=1.704 R, and 6 opposite vertices at r3=2 R. So U_oo =k q^2[30/r1+30/r2+6/r3] =k 4e^2[30/(1.05146·2)+30/(1.704·2)+6/(2·2)] =4 k e^2·24.558 =98.232 k e^2. Summing: U_total =k e^2(24+98.232)=122.232 k e^2. With k=8.9876×10^9 N·m^2/C^2 and e=1.6022×10^−19 C, k e^2≈2.307×10^−28 J·m, so U≈122.232×2.307×10^−28≈2.82×10^−26 J. This matches 2.822×10^−26 J.
