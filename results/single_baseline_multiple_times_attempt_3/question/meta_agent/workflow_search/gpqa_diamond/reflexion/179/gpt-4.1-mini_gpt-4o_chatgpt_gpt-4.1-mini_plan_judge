Question: Example(question='Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are\nconstrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system\ncorrect to three decimals?', choice1='2.822 x 10^-26', choice2='5.645 x 10^-26', choice3='7.056 x 10^-27', choice4='122.330', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To find the minimum energy of the system, we need to calculate the electrostatic potential energy of the configuration. We have 12 charges each with charge 2e at a distance of 2 m from a point P, where the 13th charge, also 2e, is fixed. The potential energy between two point charges q1 and q2 separated by a distance r is given by U = k * q1 * q2 / r, where k is Coulomb's constant (8.9875 x 10^9 N m^2/C^2). Here, q1 = q2 = 2e = 2 * 1.602 x 10^-19 C, and r = 2 m. The potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12 charges is U = (8.9875 x 10^9) * (2 * 1.602 x 10^-19)^2 / 2. There are 12 such interactions, so the total energy is 12 * U. Calculating this gives U = 2.302 x 10^-27 J for one pair, and 12 * U = 2.7624 x 10^-26 J for all pairs. Rounding to three decimals, we get 2.822 x 10^-26 J.
