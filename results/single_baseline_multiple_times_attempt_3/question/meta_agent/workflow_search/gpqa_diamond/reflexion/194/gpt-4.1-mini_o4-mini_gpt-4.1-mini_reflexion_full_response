Question: {'question': 'Astronomers are observing a planet with a radius of 1 Earth radius in a circular orbit, with a transit impact parameter of 0.2, around a star that has a radius 1.5 times that of the Sun. This planet has an orbital period of 3 days. What is the maximum orbital period of a second planet, with a radius of 2.5 times that of Earth, in the same system that will exhibit both transit and occultation events? Assume that the second planet also has a circular orbit and shares the same orbital plane as the previously mentioned transiting planet.', 'choice1': '~ 7.5', 'choice2': '~ 33.5', 'choice3': '~ 37.5', 'choice4': '~ 12.5'}\Pattern: reflexion
