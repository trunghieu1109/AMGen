Question: {'question': 'Consider an oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis). Because it oscillates, it would radiate at a wavelength \\lambda. In the radiation zone, the radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of \\lambda and the angle \\theta (with z-axis), along which the power is measured. If the maximum power thus radiated is A, the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle \\theta = 30^0 and a possible form of f are, respectively,', 'choice1': '1/2, \\lambda^(-4)', 'choice2': '3/4, \\lambda^(-6)', 'choice3': '1/4, \\lambda^(-4)', 'choice4': '1/4, \\lambda^(-3)'}\Pattern: reflexion
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent iWQ8', content='A uniformly pulsating spheroid has no dipole moment, so its leading radiation is quadrupole. Quadrupole power scales as ω^6 ∝ λ^(-6) and its angular pattern is ∝ sin^2θ cos^2θ, which peaks at θ=45° (value 1/4) and at θ=30° gives sin^2(30°)cos^2(30°)=1/4·3/4=3/16, i.e. 3/4 of the maximum. Thus choice2.\n\nAnswer:B)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
