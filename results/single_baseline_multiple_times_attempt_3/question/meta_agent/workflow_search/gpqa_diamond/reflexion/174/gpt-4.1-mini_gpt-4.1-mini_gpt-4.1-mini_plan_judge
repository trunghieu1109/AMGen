Question: Example(question='Consider an oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis). Because it oscillates, it would radiate at a wavelength \\lambda. In the radiation zone, the radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of \\lambda and the angle \\theta (with z-axis), along which the power is measured. If the maximum power thus radiated is A, the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle \\theta = 30^0 and a possible form of f are, respectively,', choice1='1/2, \\lambda^(-4)', choice2='3/4, \\lambda^(-6)', choice3='1/4, \\lambda^(-4)', choice4='1/4, \\lambda^(-3)', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The problem involves an oscillating charge distribution shaped like a spheroid with symmetry along the z-axis. The radiated power per unit solid angle in the radiation zone depends on the wavelength \lambda and the angle \theta with respect to the z-axis. The radiation pattern for such a distribution typically follows a dipole-like pattern, where the angular dependence of the radiated power is proportional to sin^2(\theta). The maximum power A occurs at \theta = 90^\circ (perpendicular to the axis). At \theta = 30^\circ, the fraction of the maximum power radiated is sin^2(30^\circ) = (1/2)^2 = 1/4. The wavelength dependence for dipole radiation power is proportional to \lambda^{-4}. Therefore, the fraction of A at \theta = 30^\circ is 1/4, and the function f has a dependence of \lambda^{-4}. This matches choice 3: '1/4, \lambda^{-4}'.
