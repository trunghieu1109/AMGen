Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent iWQ8', content="The problem involves an oscillating charge distribution shaped like a spheroid with symmetry along the z-axis. The radiated power per unit solid angle in the radiation zone depends on the wavelength \\lambda and the angle \\theta with respect to the z-axis. The radiation pattern for such a distribution typically follows a dipole-like pattern, where the angular dependence of the radiated power is proportional to sin^2(\\theta). The maximum power A occurs at \\theta = 90^\\circ (perpendicular to the axis). At \\theta = 30^\\circ, the fraction of the maximum power radiated is sin^2(30^\\circ) = (1/2)^2 = 1/4. The wavelength dependence for dipole radiation power is proportional to \\lambda^{-4}. Therefore, the fraction of A at \\theta = 30^\\circ is 1/4, and the function f has a dependence of \\lambda^{-4}. This matches choice 3: '1/4, \\lambda^{-4}'.\n\nAnswer:C)", prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
