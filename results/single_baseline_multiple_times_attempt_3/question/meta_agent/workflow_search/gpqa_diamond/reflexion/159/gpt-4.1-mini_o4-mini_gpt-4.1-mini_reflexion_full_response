Question: {'question': 'Consider an aperture, which shapes like a N-sided polygon. All the apothems are of the same length a. When a monochromatic light (of wavelength \\lambda), travelling along z-axis, falls vertically on this aperture, it creates a series of intensity maxima and minima in the far field region. What is the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large ? Assume that the related angles are small so that tan theta = theta approximation can be taken.', 'choice1': '1.220 \\lambda /a ', 'choice2': '0.610 \\lambda / a', 'choice3': '0.500 \\lambda / a', 'choice4': '0.506 \\lambda / a'}\Pattern: reflexion
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent Kygp', content='As N→∞ the aperture becomes a circular aperture of radius a. The Fraunhofer diffraction pattern intensity follows [2J₁(kaθ)/(kaθ)]², with zeros at kaθ=xₙ (x₁≈3.8317, x₂≈7.0156). Thus θ₁=(x₁λ)/(2πa)≈0.609λ/a, θ₂=(x₂λ)/(2πa)≈1.116λ/a, so the angular separation Δθ=θ₂−θ₁≈(x₂−x₁)λ/(2πa)=3.1839λ/(2πa)≈0.506λ/a.\n\nAnswer:D)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
