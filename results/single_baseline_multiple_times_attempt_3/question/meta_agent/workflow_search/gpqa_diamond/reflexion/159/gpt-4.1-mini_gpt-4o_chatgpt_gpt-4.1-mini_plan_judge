Question: Example(question='Consider an aperture, which shapes like a N-sided polygon. All the apothems are of the same length a. When a monochromatic light (of wavelength \\lambda), travelling along z-axis, falls vertically on this aperture, it creates a series of intensity maxima and minima in the far field region. What is the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large ? Assume that the related angles are small so that tan theta = theta approximation can be taken.', choice1='1.220 \\lambda /a ', choice2='0.610 \\lambda / a', choice3='0.500 \\lambda / a', choice4='0.506 \\lambda / a', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: When N is infinitely large, the N-sided polygon becomes a circle. The apothem a becomes the radius of the circle. For a circular aperture, the angular position of the first minimum in the diffraction pattern is given by the formula theta = 1.22 * lambda / D, where D is the diameter of the circle. Since the apothem a is the radius, the diameter D = 2a. Therefore, the angular position of the first minimum is theta = 1.22 * lambda / (2a). The angular distance between the first two minima is twice this value, which is 2 * (1.22 * lambda / (2a)) = 1.22 * lambda / a.
