Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent Kygp', content='When N is infinitely large, the N-sided polygon becomes a circle. The apothem a becomes the radius of the circle. For a circular aperture, the angular position of the first minimum in the diffraction pattern is given by the formula theta = 1.22 * lambda / D, where D is the diameter of the circle. Since the apothem a is the radius, the diameter D = 2a. Therefore, the angular position of the first minimum is theta = 1.22 * lambda / (2a). The angular distance between the first two minima is twice this value, which is 2 * (1.22 * lambda / (2a)) = 1.22 * lambda / a.\n\nAnswer:A)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
