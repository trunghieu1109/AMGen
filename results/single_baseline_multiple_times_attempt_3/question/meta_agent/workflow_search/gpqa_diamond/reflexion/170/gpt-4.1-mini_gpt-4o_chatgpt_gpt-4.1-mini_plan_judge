proposed answer: To determine the order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer in electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine, we need to consider the directing effects of the substituents on the benzene ring. Activating groups, such as alkyl groups, direct electrophilic substitution to the ortho and para positions, with para often being favored due to steric reasons. Deactivating groups, such as nitro or carboxyl groups, direct substitution to the meta position, reducing the para yield. The order of directing effects from strongest activating to strongest deactivating is: alkyl groups (e.g., -CH3, -C2H5), halogens (e.g., -Cl), esters (e.g., -COOC2H5), and strong deactivators like -NO2 and -COOH. Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield should be based on the strength of the activating or deactivating effect of the substituents. The correct order is: 4 (strongly deactivating, meta-directing) < 6 (strongly deactivating, meta-directing) < 2 (moderately deactivating, meta-directing) < 1 (activating, ortho/para-directing) < 5 (activating, ortho/para-directing) < 3 (halogen, ortho/para-directing but less activating than alkyl groups).
