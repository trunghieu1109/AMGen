Question: Example(question='The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1), and the operators of two observables P and Q of the system are represented by two square matrices. The matrix corresponding to operator P has the elements in first row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0), elements in the second row as (1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}) and that in third row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0). The matrix operator for Q is represented by the square matrix having elements in the first row as (1, 0, 0), second row as (0, 0, 0) and third row as (0, 0, -1). Now, if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P, what is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements?', choice1='1/2', choice2='1/6', choice3='1/3', choice4='2/3', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: First normalize the initial state |ψ〉 = (–1,2,1)ᵀ. Its norm² = 1+4+1 = 6. Next find the zero–eigenvalue eigenvector of P: solve P|v₀〉 = 0 → v₂ = 0 and v₁ + v₃ = 0 → |v₀〉 = (1,0,–1)/√2. Probability of P=0 is |〈v₀|ψ〉|²/〈ψ|ψ〉 = ((–1–1)/√2)²/6 = (–2/√2)²/6 = 2/6 = 1/3. After measuring P=0, the state collapses to |v₀〉. For Q, the –1 eigenvector is |3〉 = (0,0,1). Probability of Q=–1 is |〈3|v₀〉|² = (–1/√2)² = 1/2. The joint probability is (1/3)*(1/2) = 1/6, which corresponds to choice B).
