Question: Example(question='The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1), and the operators of two observables P and Q of the system are represented by two square matrices. The matrix corresponding to operator P has the elements in first row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0), elements in the second row as (1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}) and that in third row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0). The matrix operator for Q is represented by the square matrix having elements in the first row as (1, 0, 0), second row as (0, 0, 0) and third row as (0, 0, -1). Now, if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P, what is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements?', choice1='1/2', choice2='1/6', choice3='1/3', choice4='2/3', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: To find the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q, we need to find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the operator matrices for P and Q. The matrix for P is a 3x3 matrix with elements: [[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]]. The matrix for Q is a diagonal matrix with elements: [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -1]]. We need to find the eigenvectors of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0, and then project the state vector onto this eigenvector. Then, we measure Q and find the probability of getting -1. The eigenvectors of Q are straightforward: [1, 0, 0] for eigenvalue 1, [0, 1, 0] for eigenvalue 0, and [0, 0, 1] for eigenvalue -1. We need to find the eigenvector of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0, and then find the overlap with the eigenvector of Q corresponding to eigenvalue -1. The eigenvector of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0 is [0, 0, 1]. The overlap with the eigenvector of Q corresponding to eigenvalue -1, which is [0, 0, 1], is 1. Therefore, the probability is the square of the overlap, which is 1. However, we must also consider the probability of getting 0 for P, which is calculated by projecting the initial state onto the eigenvector [0, 0, 1] and taking the square of the norm. The initial state is [-1, 2, 1], and the projection onto [0, 0, 1] is 1, so the probability of getting 0 for P is (1/sqrt(6))^2 = 1/6. Therefore, the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q is 1/6.
