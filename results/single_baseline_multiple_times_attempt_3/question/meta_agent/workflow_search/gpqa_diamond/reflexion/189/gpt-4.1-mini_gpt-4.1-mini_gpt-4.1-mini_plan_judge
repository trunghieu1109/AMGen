Question: Example(question='The reaction of an electron pair donor, nucleophile (Nu) with an electron pair acceptor is called nucleophilic substitution reaction. An sp3-hybridized electrophile needs to have a leaving group to proceed with the reaction. Substitution reactions have the following two types. One is SN1 and the other is the SN2 reaction. In contrast to the substitution reaction, the elimination reaction involves the removal of a pair or groups of atoms from a molecule. These are chemical reactions in which single carbon-carbon bonded organic compounds are converted to compounds containing double/triple bonds (unsaturated compounds).\nArrange the following nucleophiles more reactive to the poorest reactive in the aqueous solution.\n\n1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate\n2. Hydroxide\n3. Propionate\n4. Methanol\n5. Ethanethiolate', choice1='5, 2, 1, 3 and 4', choice2='2, 5, 1, 4 and 3', choice3='5, 2, 3, 1 and 4', choice4='2, 5, 3, 4 and 3', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: In aqueous solution, nucleophilicity generally depends on the charge, electronegativity, and solvation effects. Thiolates (like ethanethiolate) are generally more nucleophilic than hydroxides because sulfur is less electronegative and larger, making it more polarizable. Alkoxides (like 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate) are generally more nucleophilic than carboxylates (like propionate) because the negative charge is less delocalized. Methanol is neutral and thus the least nucleophilic. Considering these points, the order from most reactive to least reactive nucleophile in aqueous solution would be: ethanethiolate (5), hydroxide (2), 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (1), propionate (3), and methanol (4).
