Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent MHjR', content="The question describes a transcription factor that requires dimerization to function. Mutation Y is in the dimerization domain and acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Dominant-negative mutations typically interfere with the function of the wild-type protein, often by forming non-functional complexes. In this case, mutation Y likely causes the mutant protein to dimerize with the wild-type protein, but the resulting dimer is non-functional. This would lead to a loss-of-function phenotype, as the wild-type protein's function is inhibited by the mutant protein. Protein aggregation is a common result of dominant-negative mutations, as the mutant protein can form non-functional aggregates with the wild-type protein. Therefore, the most likely molecular phenotype is protein aggregation and a loss-of-function phenotype.\n\nAnswer:B)", prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
