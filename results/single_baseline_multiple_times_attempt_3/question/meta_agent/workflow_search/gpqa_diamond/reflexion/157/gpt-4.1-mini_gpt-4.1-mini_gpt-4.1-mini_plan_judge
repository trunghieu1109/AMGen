Question: Example(question='In an inactive state, a transcription factor subunit awaits an activation signal from the membrane phosphorylation cascade. Upon phosphorylation on the Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, shuttles into the nucleus, and serves in gene transcription. A missense mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. You observe that a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Which of the following molecular phenotypes is most likely observed in the presence of mutation Y?', choice1='loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype', choice2='protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype', choice3='protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele', choice4='change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The question describes a transcription factor that functions as a dimer. Mutation X in the transactivation domain is recessive loss-of-function, meaning that one functional copy is enough for normal function. Mutation Y is in the dimerization domain and acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Dominant-negative mutations typically produce a mutant protein that can still interact with the wild-type protein (e.g., by dimerization) but disrupts the function of the complex. This usually leads to a loss-of-function phenotype even in heterozygotes because the mutant protein poisons the function of the wild-type protein. Therefore, mutation Y likely allows dimerization but results in a nonfunctional dimer, causing a loss-of-function phenotype. Among the options, 'protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype' fits best, as dominant-negative mutations often cause abnormal complexes or aggregates that are nonfunctional. The other options either suggest a wild-type phenotype, gain-of-function, or degradation, which are less consistent with dominant-negative effects in the dimerization domain.
