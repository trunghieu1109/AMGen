Question: Example(question='In an inactive state, a transcription factor subunit awaits an activation signal from the membrane phosphorylation cascade. Upon phosphorylation on the Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, shuttles into the nucleus, and serves in gene transcription. A missense mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. You observe that a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Which of the following molecular phenotypes is most likely observed in the presence of mutation Y?', choice1='loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype', choice2='protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype', choice3='protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele', choice4='change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The question describes a transcription factor that requires dimerization to function. Mutation Y is in the dimerization domain and acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Dominant-negative mutations typically interfere with the function of the wild-type protein, often by forming non-functional complexes. In this case, mutation Y likely causes the mutant protein to dimerize with the wild-type protein, but the resulting dimer is non-functional. This would lead to a loss-of-function phenotype, as the wild-type protein's function is inhibited by the mutant protein. Protein aggregation is a common result of dominant-negative mutations, as the mutant protein can form non-functional aggregates with the wild-type protein. Therefore, the most likely molecular phenotype is protein aggregation and a loss-of-function phenotype.
