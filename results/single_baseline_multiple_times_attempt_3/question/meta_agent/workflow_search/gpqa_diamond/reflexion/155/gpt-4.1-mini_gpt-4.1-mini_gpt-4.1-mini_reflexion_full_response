Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent VApC', content='The reaction of an alkene with mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid) forms an epoxide. For (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene, the stereochemistry of the double bond affects the stereochemistry of the epoxide formed. The (E)-alkene will give one pair of enantiomers (a racemic mixture) because the epoxidation is stereospecific and the product is chiral. Similarly, the (Z)-alkene will give another pair of enantiomers (another racemic mixture) with different stereochemistry from the (E)-alkene product. Therefore, the product mixture contains two different racemic epoxides, i.e., four stereoisomers in total. On a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC, enantiomers co-elute, so each racemic mixture appears as one peak. Since there are two different racemic mixtures, there will be two peaks. On a chiral HPLC column, enantiomers are separated, so each racemic mixture gives two peaks. Since there are two racemic mixtures, there will be four peaks in total. Hence, the chemist observes 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC.\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
