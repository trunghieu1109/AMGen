Question: Example(question='A chemist performs two reactions:\n\nReaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. \n\nReaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.\n\nBoth reactions go to 100% completion. The chemist combines the products of both reactions, and then runs the product mixture on both a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column and a chiral HPLC column.\n\nAssuming that the chromatographic resolution is as high as theoretically possible in both cases, what does the chemist observe in each of these chromatograms?', choice1='4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', choice2='3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice3='2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice4='2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: The reaction of an alkene with mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid) forms an epoxide. For (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene, the stereochemistry of the double bond affects the stereochemistry of the epoxide formed. The (E)-alkene will give one pair of enantiomers (a racemic mixture) because the epoxidation is stereospecific and the product is chiral. Similarly, the (Z)-alkene will give another pair of enantiomers (another racemic mixture) with different stereochemistry from the (E)-alkene product. Therefore, the product mixture contains two different racemic epoxides, i.e., four stereoisomers in total. On a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC, enantiomers co-elute, so each racemic mixture appears as one peak. Since there are two different racemic mixtures, there will be two peaks. On a chiral HPLC column, enantiomers are separated, so each racemic mixture gives two peaks. Since there are two racemic mixtures, there will be four peaks in total. Hence, the chemist observes 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC.
