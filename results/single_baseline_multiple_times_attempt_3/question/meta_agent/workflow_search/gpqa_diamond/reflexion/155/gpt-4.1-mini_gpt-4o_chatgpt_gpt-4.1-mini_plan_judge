Question: Example(question='A chemist performs two reactions:\n\nReaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. \n\nReaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.\n\nBoth reactions go to 100% completion. The chemist combines the products of both reactions, and then runs the product mixture on both a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column and a chiral HPLC column.\n\nAssuming that the chromatographic resolution is as high as theoretically possible in both cases, what does the chemist observe in each of these chromatograms?', choice1='4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', choice2='3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice3='2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice4='2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: Reaction 1 and Reaction 2 both involve the epoxidation of an alkene followed by acid-catalyzed ring opening. Reaction 1 starts with (E)-oct-4-ene, and Reaction 2 starts with (Z)-oct-4-ene. The epoxidation of an alkene with mCPBA is stereospecific, so the (E)-alkene will give a different epoxide than the (Z)-alkene. Upon acid-catalyzed ring opening, each epoxide will give a diol. The (E)-epoxide will give a different diol than the (Z)-epoxide. The (E)-alkene will give a meso diol, while the (Z)-alkene will give a pair of enantiomers. Therefore, the product mixture will contain one meso compound and a pair of enantiomers. On a standard achiral HPLC, the meso compound and the racemic pair will co-elute, giving 2 peaks. On a chiral HPLC, the meso compound will be one peak, and the enantiomers will be resolved into two separate peaks, giving 3 peaks in total.
