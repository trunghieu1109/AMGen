Question: Example(question='A chemist performs two reactions:\n\nReaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. \n\nReaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.\n\nBoth reactions go to 100% completion. The chemist combines the products of both reactions, and then runs the product mixture on both a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column and a chiral HPLC column.\n\nAssuming that the chromatographic resolution is as high as theoretically possible in both cases, what does the chemist observe in each of these chromatograms?', choice1='4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', choice2='3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice3='2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice4='2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The mCPBA/acid sequence gives anti dihydroxylation. For the trans (E) alkene this yields a single meso diol (achiral). For the cis (Z) alkene this yields a racemic pair of enantiomeric diols. On an achiral (standard) HPLC column the meso and the racemic co-eluted enantiomers are diastereomers so give two peaks. On a chiral column the racemate resolves into two enantiomer peaks while the meso diol remains one peak, for a total of three.
