Question: Example(question='You are studying a nuclear decay which converts two heavy nucleons of flavor A to another flavor B, while simultaneously emitting two much lighter particles E and V. In short, 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V. It is known that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous, with some endpoint value Q.\n\nA variant of this decay emits one exotic, massless particle M instead of the 2V. In this case, how does the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles compare to that of the original decay?', choice1='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint increases.', choice2='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases.', choice3='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.', choice4='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint decreases.', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: Original 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V is a four‐body decay giving a continuous electron sum‐energy spectrum with endpoint Q. Replacing the two neutrinos V with a single massless M yields a three‐body final state (2E + M), which still produces a continuous spectrum (only two‐body decays give discrete lines). The distribution shape shifts, and since M is massless (while neutrinos have tiny mass), the maximum electron energy can reach slightly higher, so the endpoint increases.
