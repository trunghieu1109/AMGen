Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent A3AB', content='In the original decay 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V, the energy spectrum of the E particles is continuous because the energy is shared among multiple particles (2E and 2V), allowing a range of energy distributions. The endpoint Q corresponds to the maximum energy the E particles can have when the other particles carry minimal kinetic energy.\n\nIn the variant decay, one exotic, massless particle M replaces the 2V particles. Since M is massless and only one particle replaces two, the energy distribution among the E particles and M changes. The total available energy Q is fixed by the mass difference between initial and final nucleons.\n\nBecause there are fewer particles sharing the energy (2E + 1M instead of 2E + 2V), the energy spectrum of the E particles remains continuous but the shape changes due to different kinematics. Also, since M is massless, it can carry away less energy than the two V particles combined, so the maximum energy (endpoint) available to the E particles increases.\n\nTherefore, the spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
