Question: Example(question='Which of the following (effective) particles is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry?', choice1='Magnon', choice2='Skyrmion', choice3='Pion', choice4='Phonon', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: Magnons are Goldstone modes for broken spin rotation, phonons for broken translation in crystals, pions are pseudo-Goldstone bosons of chiral symmetry breaking. Skyrmions are topological solitons, not a mode from spontaneous symmetry breaking.

Answer:B)
Extracted answer: B)
Correct answer: 2
