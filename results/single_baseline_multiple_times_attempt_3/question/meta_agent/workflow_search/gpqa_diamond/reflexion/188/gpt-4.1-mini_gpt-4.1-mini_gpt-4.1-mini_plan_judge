Question: Example(question='Which of the following (effective) particles is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry?', choice1='Magnon', choice2='Skyrmion', choice3='Pion', choice4='Phonon', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: Magnons are quasiparticles associated with spin waves in a magnetically ordered system, which arise due to spontaneous breaking of spin rotational symmetry. Pions are pseudo-Goldstone bosons resulting from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics. Phonons are quanta of lattice vibrations and are associated with the spontaneous breaking of continuous translational symmetry in a crystal lattice. Skyrmions, on the other hand, are topological solitons or particle-like configurations in a field theory and are not directly associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry. They are stable due to topological reasons rather than symmetry breaking.
