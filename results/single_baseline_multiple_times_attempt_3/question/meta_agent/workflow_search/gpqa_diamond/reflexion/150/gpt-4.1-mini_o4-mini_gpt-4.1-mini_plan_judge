Question: Example(question='The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1). An observable of the system is represented by the matrix operator P having elements in the first row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0),  in the second row as (1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}) and in the third row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0). Calculate the probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 at time t.', choice1='1/3\n', choice2='2/3\n', choice3='\\sqrt{2/3}\n', choice4='1', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The operator P has eigenvalues 1, 0, –1, with the zero‐eigenvector proportional to (1,0,–1). Normalizing that gives |e0>=(1/√2,0,−1/√2). The state |ψ>=(-1,2,1) has norm √6. The overlap <e0|ψ>=(1/√2)(-1)+(−1/√2)(1)=−2/√2=−√2, so |<e0|ψ>|^2=2. Probability = 2/6=1/3.
