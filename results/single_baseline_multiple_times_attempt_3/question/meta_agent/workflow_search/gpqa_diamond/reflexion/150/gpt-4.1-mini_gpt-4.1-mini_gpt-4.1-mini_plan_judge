proposed answer: First, normalize the state vector |ψ> = (-1, 2, 1). The norm is sqrt((-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(1 + 4 + 1) = sqrt(6). So the normalized state is (-1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6)).

The observable P is given by the matrix:
P = [[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0],
     [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)],
     [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]]

We need to find the probability that the measurement yields 0. This means we need to find the eigenvectors of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0, then project |ψ> onto that eigenspace and find the squared magnitude of the projection.

Find eigenvalues of P:
Let’s denote a = 1/sqrt(2).

P = [[0, a, 0],
     [a, 0, a],
     [0, a, 0]]

The characteristic polynomial is det(P - λI) = 0.

Compute:
| -λ, a, 0 |
| a, -λ, a |
| 0, a, -λ |

Calculate determinant:
= -λ * det([[-λ, a], [a, -λ]]) - a * det([[a, a], [0, -λ]]) + 0
= -λ * ((-λ)*(-λ) - a*a) - a * (a*(-λ) - a*0)
= -λ * (λ^2 - a^2) - a * (-aλ)
= -λ^3 + λ a^2 + a^2 λ
= -λ^3 + 2 a^2 λ

Set equal to zero:
-λ^3 + 2 a^2 λ = 0
λ(-λ^2 + 2 a^2) = 0

So eigenvalues are λ = 0 or λ^2 = 2 a^2
Since a = 1/sqrt(2), a^2 = 1/2
So λ^2 = 2 * (1/2) = 1
λ = ±1

Eigenvalues: -1, 0, 1

Find eigenvector for λ=0:
(P - 0*I) v = 0
P v = 0

Let v = (x, y, z)

From P v = 0:
Row 1: 0*x + a*y + 0*z = 0 => a y = 0 => y = 0
Row 2: a*x + 0*y + a*z = 0 => a x + a z = 0 => x = -z
Row 3: 0*x + a*y + 0*z = 0 => a y = 0 => y = 0 (same as row 1)

So eigenvector for λ=0 is v = (x, 0, z) with x = -z
Choose z = 1, then v = (-1, 0, 1)

Normalize v:
Norm = sqrt((-1)^2 + 0 + 1^2) = sqrt(2)
Normalized eigenvector: (-1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2))

Now project |ψ> onto this eigenvector:
|ψ> = (-1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6))

Projection amplitude = <v|ψ> = (-1/sqrt(2))*(-1/sqrt(6)) + 0*(2/sqrt(6)) + (1/sqrt(2))*(1/sqrt(6))
= (1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6))) + 0 + (1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)))
= 2 / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(6))
= 2 / sqrt(12)
= 2 / (2*sqrt(3))
= 1 / sqrt(3)

Probability = |projection amplitude|^2 = (1 / sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3

Therefore, the probability that the measurement yields 0 is 1/3.
