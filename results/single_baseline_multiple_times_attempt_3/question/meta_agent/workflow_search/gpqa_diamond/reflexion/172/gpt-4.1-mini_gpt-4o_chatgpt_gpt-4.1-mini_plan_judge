Question: Example(question="If uncertainty in space of electron's location, which is travelling with speed v= 2* 10^8 m/s along x-direction is Δx=0.1 nm . Based on the infromation estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of electron.", choice1='~10^(-19) J', choice2='~10^(-18) J', choice3='~10^(-16) J', choice4='~10^(-17) J', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To find the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of the electron, we use the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The principle states that Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where Δx is the uncertainty in position and Δp is the uncertainty in momentum. We are given Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 * 10^(-9) m. The momentum p of the electron is given by p = mv, where m is the mass of the electron (approximately 9.11 * 10^(-31) kg) and v is the velocity (2 * 10^8 m/s). The uncertainty in momentum Δp can be related to the uncertainty in energy ΔE by ΔE = Δp * v, assuming the velocity is constant. First, we calculate Δp using the uncertainty principle: Δp ≥ ħ/(2 * Δx), where ħ = h/(2π) and h is Planck's constant (6.626 * 10^(-34) Js). Substituting the values, we find Δp. Then, we calculate ΔE = Δp * v. Finally, we compare the result with the given choices to find the closest match.
