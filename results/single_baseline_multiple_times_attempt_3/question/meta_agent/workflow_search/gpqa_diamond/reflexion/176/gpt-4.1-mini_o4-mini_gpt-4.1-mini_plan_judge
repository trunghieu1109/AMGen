Question: Example(question='Astronomers are interested in the luminosities of two stars. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2. The mass of Star_1 is also larger by the same factor (1.5 times). Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same. Astronomers also calculated the radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:', choice1='~2.25', choice2='~2.35', choice3='~2.32', choice4='~2.23\n', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: We have two stars radiating as black bodies. Star_1 has R1=1.5R2, M1=1.5M2, and radial velocities v1=0, v2=700 km/s. Spectroscopy shows both have the same observed peak wavelength λ_obs. For Star_1, λ_rest1=λ_obs. For Star_2 receding at v=700 km/s, λ_obs=λ_rest2(1+v/c), so λ_rest2=λ_obs/(1+v/c). Thus λ_rest2<λ_obs, implying T2>T1 since T∝1/λ_rest. Quantitatively, 1+v/c≈1.002333, so T1/T2=1/1.002333≈0.997673. Luminosity ratio L∝R^2T^4, so L1/L2=(1.5)^2*(T1/T2)^4=2.25*(0.997673)^4≈2.228≈2.23.
