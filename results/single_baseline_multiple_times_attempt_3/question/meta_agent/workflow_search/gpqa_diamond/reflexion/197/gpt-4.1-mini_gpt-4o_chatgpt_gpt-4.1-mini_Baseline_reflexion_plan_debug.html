    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;We have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate, where the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M and the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16. What will be the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species in the solution? &#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;16.9%&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;42.3%&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;25.6%&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;38.1%&#39;}

### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent FTju (yourself):
To find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes, Co(SCN)2, among all cobalt-containing species, we need to consider the distribution of cobalt between its different thiocyanato complexes. The stability constants given are for the formation of Co(SCN)+, Co(SCN)2, Co(SCN)3-, and Co(SCN)4^2-. The total concentration of cobalt is 10^-2 M, and the concentration of SCN- is 0.1 M. We can use the stability constants to find the concentrations of each complex. The concentration of Co(SCN)2 is given by [Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co2+] * [SCN-]^2. We need to find [Co2+] using the mass balance equation for cobalt: [Co2+] + [Co(SCN)+] + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3-] + [Co(SCN)4^2-] = 10^-2 M. We can express each complex concentration in terms of [Co2+] and solve for [Co2+]. Then, we calculate [Co(SCN)2] and find its percentage among all cobalt species.

### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent FTju (yourself):
B)

### feedback #1 by Critic Agent 0Ypb:
The reasoning provided is correct in terms of the approach to solve the problem. However, the final answer choice &#39;B)&#39; which corresponds to &#39;42.3%&#39; does not match the correct calculation. The correct percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes should be calculated using the given stability constants and the concentrations. The correct answer is &#39;38.1%&#39;, which corresponds to choice &#39;D)&#39;.
