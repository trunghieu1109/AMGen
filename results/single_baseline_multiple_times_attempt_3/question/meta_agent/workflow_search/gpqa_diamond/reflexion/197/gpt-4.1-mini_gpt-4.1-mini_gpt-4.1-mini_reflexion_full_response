Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent FTju', content='Given the total cobalt concentration c(Co) = 10^-2 M and [SCN-] = 0.1 M, and the stability constants β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16 for Co(SCN)n complexes, we want to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which corresponds to n=2 (Co(SCN)2). The overall stability constants βn are cumulative: β1 = K1, β2 = K1*K2, β3 = K1*K2*K3, β4 = K1*K2*K3*K4. We can find the stepwise constants: K1 = 9, K2 = 40/9 ≈ 4.44, K3 = 63/40 = 1.575, K4 = 16/63 ≈ 0.254. The concentration of each species can be expressed as: [Co] = free Co(II), [Co(SCN)] = K1*[Co]*[SCN], [Co(SCN)2] = K1*K2*[Co]*[SCN]^2, etc. The total cobalt concentration is: c(Co) = [Co] + [Co(SCN)] + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3] + [Co(SCN)4]. Substituting: c(Co) = [Co] * (1 + K1*[SCN] + K1*K2*[SCN]^2 + K1*K2*K3*[SCN]^3 + K1*K2*K3*K4*[SCN]^4). Plugging in values: 10^-2 = [Co] * (1 + 9*0.1 + 40*0.01 + 63*0.001 + 16*0.0001) = [Co] * (1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016) = [Co] * 2.3646. So [Co] = 10^-2 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.00423 M. Then [Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co] * [SCN]^2 = 40 * 0.00423 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.00423 * 0.01 = 0.001692 M. The percentage of Co(SCN)2 among all cobalt species is (0.001692 / 0.01) * 100% = 16.92%. This matches choice1: 16.9%.\n\nAnswer:A)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
