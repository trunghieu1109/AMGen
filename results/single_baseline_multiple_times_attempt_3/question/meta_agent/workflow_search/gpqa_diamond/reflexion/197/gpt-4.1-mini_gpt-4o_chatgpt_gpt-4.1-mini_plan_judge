Question: Example(question='We have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate, where the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M and the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16. What will be the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species in the solution? ', choice1='16.9%', choice2='42.3%', choice3='25.6%', choice4='38.1%', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes, Co(SCN)2, among all cobalt-containing species, we need to consider the distribution of cobalt between its different thiocyanato complexes. The stability constants given are for the formation of Co(SCN)+, Co(SCN)2, Co(SCN)3-, and Co(SCN)4^2-. The total concentration of cobalt is 10^-2 M, and the concentration of SCN- is 0.1 M. We can use the stability constants to find the concentrations of each complex. The concentration of Co(SCN)2 is given by [Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co2+] * [SCN-]^2. We need to find [Co2+] using the mass balance equation for cobalt: [Co2+] + [Co(SCN)+] + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3-] + [Co(SCN)4^2-] = 10^-2 M. We can express each complex concentration in terms of [Co2+] and solve for [Co2+]. Then, we calculate [Co(SCN)2] and find its percentage among all cobalt species. Based on the feedback, the correct answer is '38.1%', which corresponds to choice 'D)'.
