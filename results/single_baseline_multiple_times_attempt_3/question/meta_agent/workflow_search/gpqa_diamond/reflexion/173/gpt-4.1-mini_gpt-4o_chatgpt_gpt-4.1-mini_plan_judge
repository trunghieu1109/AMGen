Question: Example(question='An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. A spontaneous fission occurs in which it splits into two fragments (and nothing else), such that one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other (in terms of their rest-masses). The sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. \n\nKinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?\n\n(Ignore the electrons.)', choice1='10 MeV.', choice2='5 MeV.', choice3='2 MeV.', choice4='20 MeV.', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The initial rest-mass energy is 300 GeV, and the rest-mass energy of the fragments is 297 GeV, so the kinetic energy released is 3 GeV. The lighter fragment has rest mass 0.33M and the heavier fragment has rest mass 0.66M. In the center of mass frame, the fragments have equal and opposite momenta. Using the relativistic energy-momentum relation, we find the kinetic energy T1 of the heavier fragment. In the classical approximation, T1_classical = p^2/(2*0.66M). The difference between the relativistic and classical T1 is due to the relativistic correction. We calculate this difference to find the answer.
