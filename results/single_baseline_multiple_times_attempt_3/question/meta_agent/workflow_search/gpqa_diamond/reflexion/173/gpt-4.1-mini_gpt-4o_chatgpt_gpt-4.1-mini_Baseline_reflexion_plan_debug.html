    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. A spontaneous fission occurs in which it splits into two fragments (and nothing else), such that one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other (in terms of their rest-masses). The sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. \n\nKinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?\n\n(Ignore the electrons.)&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;10 MeV.&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;5 MeV.&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;2 MeV.&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;20 MeV.&#39;}

### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent ERnq (yourself):
First, we need to determine the rest masses of the two fragments. Let the rest mass of the lighter fragment be m, then the rest mass of the heavier fragment is 2m. The sum of their rest masses is 3m, which is 99% of the initial mass M. Therefore, 3m = 0.99M, so m = 0.33M. The rest mass of the heavier fragment is 2m = 0.66M. The initial rest-mass energy is 300 GeV, so M = 300 GeV/c^2. The rest-mass energy of the fragments is 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV. The total energy is conserved, so the kinetic energy released is 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV. In the center of mass frame, the fragments have equal and opposite momenta. Let p be the momentum of the lighter fragment, then the momentum of the heavier fragment is -p. The relativistic energy-momentum relation gives E1^2 = (p^2c^2 + (0.66M)^2c^4) for the heavier fragment. The kinetic energy T1 is E1 - 0.66Mc^2. In the classical approximation, T1_classical = p^2/(2*0.66M). The difference between the relativistic and classical T1 is due to the relativistic correction. We calculate this difference to find the answer.

### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent ERnq (yourself):
A)

### feedback #1 by Critic Agent ckaO:
The reasoning seems correct in terms of setting up the problem and understanding the conservation of energy and momentum. However, the final step of calculating the difference between the relativistic and classical kinetic energy values is not explicitly shown, and the choice &#39;A)&#39; does not correspond to any of the given choices. The correct choice should be one of the provided options: &#39;10 MeV&#39;, &#39;5 MeV&#39;, &#39;2 MeV&#39;, or &#39;20 MeV&#39;.

Given previous attempts and feedback, carefully consider where you could go wrong in your latest attempt. Using insights from previous attempts, try to solve the task better.</pre>
