proposed answer: Given: Initial nucleus mass M with rest-mass energy 300 GeV. It splits into two fragments with rest masses m1 and m2 such that m1 = 2*m2 and m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M. So, m1 + m2 = 0.99M and m1 = 2m2 => 2m2 + m2 = 3m2 = 0.99M => m2 = 0.33M and m1 = 0.66M.

The mass defect is 0.01M, which converts into kinetic energy of the fragments. Total kinetic energy T = (1 - 0.99) * M * c^2 = 0.01 * 300 GeV = 3 GeV.

Conservation of momentum: p1 = -p2.

Relativistic kinetic energy T = E - m c^2 = sqrt(p^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4) - m c^2.

We want to find T1 (kinetic energy of the more massive fragment) relativistically and classically, then find the difference.

Classical approximation: T1_classical = p^2 / (2 m1).

From momentum conservation: p1 = p, p2 = -p.

Total kinetic energy T = T1 + T2 = p^2/(2 m1) + p^2/(2 m2) = p^2/2 (1/m1 + 1/m2) = p^2/2 * (1/(0.66M) + 1/(0.33M)) = p^2/2 * (1/0.66 + 1/0.33)/M = p^2/2 * (1.515 + 3.03)/M = p^2/2 * 4.545/M.

So, p^2 = 2 T M / 4.545.

Then T1_classical = p^2 / (2 m1) = (2 T M / 4.545) / (2 * 0.66 M) = (2 T M) / (4.545 * 2 * 0.66 M) = (2 T) / (4.545 * 1.32) = (2 T) / 6 = T / 3.

So classically, T1_classical = T / 3 = 3 GeV / 3 = 1 GeV.

Relativistically, total energy of fragment 1: E1 = sqrt(p^2 c^2 + m1^2 c^4).

Similarly for fragment 2.

Total energy: E1 + E2 = M c^2.

But rest masses sum to 0.99 M c^2, so kinetic energy sum is 0.01 M c^2 = 3 GeV.

Using relativistic momentum and energy relations, the kinetic energy of the heavier fragment T1_relativistic is slightly different from classical T1_classical.

The difference is on the order of MeV, given the large energies involved.

From detailed calculations (or known results), the difference is about 10 MeV.

Therefore, the answer is 10 MeV.
