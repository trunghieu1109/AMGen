Question: Example(question='There has been an outbreak of an viral infectious disease in your city. You have been asked to design a molecular diagnostic kit for quick detection of this retrovirus. How would you go about designing this kit?', choice1='First you identify the virus by performing DNA sequencing. You then develop a PCR kit for  quick and accurate diagnosis', choice2='First you identify the IgG antibodies for the infection. You then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG antibodies for quick \n and accurate diagnosis.', choice3='First you identify the virus using the information about the symptoms, provided by the affected patients. You then design a nested PCR kit based on the information for quick diagnosis.', choice4='First you identify the virus by performing cDNA sequencing.  You then develop a real time PCR kit for quick and accurate diagnosis.', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To design a molecular diagnostic kit for a retrovirus, we need to consider the nature of retroviruses. Retroviruses have RNA genomes, which are reverse transcribed into DNA. Therefore, identifying the virus would involve sequencing its RNA or the cDNA derived from it. Once the viral sequence is known, a PCR-based method can be developed for detection. Choice 1 suggests DNA sequencing, which is not directly applicable to retroviruses since they have RNA genomes. Choice 2 involves antibody detection, which is not a molecular diagnostic method for detecting the virus itself. Choice 3 suggests using symptoms for identification, which is not reliable for molecular diagnostics. Choice 4 suggests cDNA sequencing, which is appropriate for retroviruses, followed by real-time PCR, which is a suitable method for quick and accurate diagnosis. Therefore, choice 4 is the most appropriate.
