Question: Example(question='What is the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product obtained when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess of HI?', choice1='1', choice2='3', choice3='0', choice4='5', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The compound 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid has the following structure: a cyclohexene ring with a formyl group (CHO) at position 2, a vinyl group (CH=CH2) at position 5, and a carboxylic acid group (COOH) attached to the ring. The reaction with red phosphorus and excess HI is known to reduce double bonds and convert functional groups to alkanes. The formyl group (CHO) will be reduced to a CH3 group, the vinyl group (CH=CH2) will be reduced to an ethyl group (CH2CH3), and the carboxylic acid group (COOH) will be reduced to a CH3 group. The cyclohexene ring will be reduced to a cyclohexane ring. After the reaction, the product will be a cyclohexane ring with three alkyl groups: a methyl group, an ethyl group, and another methyl group. This product is a fully saturated alkane with no double bonds or rings, so its index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) is 0.
