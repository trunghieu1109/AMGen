Question: Example(question='What is the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product obtained when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess of HI?', choice1='1', choice2='3', choice3='0', choice4='5', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The given compound is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. The reaction with red phosphorus and excess HI is a reduction reaction that typically reduces aldehydes and carboxylic acids to corresponding hydrocarbons by removing oxygen functionalities. The original compound has a cyclohexene ring (one double bond), a formyl group (aldehyde), a vinyl group (another double bond), and a carboxylic acid group. The index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) is calculated as the number of rings plus double bonds plus triple bonds. Initially, the compound has: - One ring (cyclohexene) = 1 - One double bond in the ring = 1 - One vinyl group (double bond) = 1 - Formyl group (aldehyde) = 1 double bond equivalent - Carboxylic acid group = 1 double bond equivalent (C=O) Total IHD initially = 1 (ring) + 1 (ring double bond) + 1 (vinyl double bond) + 1 (aldehyde) + 1 (carboxylic acid) = 5. After reaction with red phosphorus and excess HI, the aldehyde and carboxylic acid groups are reduced to -CH3 groups, removing their double bonds. The vinyl group double bond remains intact, and the ring double bond remains intact. So, the new IHD = 1 (ring) + 1 (ring double bond) + 1 (vinyl double bond) = 3. Therefore, the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 3.
