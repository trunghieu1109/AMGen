Question: Example(question='What is the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product obtained when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess of HI?', choice1='1', choice2='3', choice3='0', choice4='5', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: Red P/HI reduces both the aldehyde and carboxylic acid to methyl groups, leaving only the ring, the ring double bond, and the vinyl double bond intact. That gives 1 ring + 1 ring C=C + 1 vinyl C=C = 3 degrees of unsaturation.

Answer:B)
Extracted answer: B)
