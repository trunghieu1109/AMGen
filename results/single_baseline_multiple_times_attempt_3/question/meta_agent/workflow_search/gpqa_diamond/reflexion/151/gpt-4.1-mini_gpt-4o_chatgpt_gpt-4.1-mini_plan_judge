Question: Example(question='You identified a new quorum-sensing peptide in the bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus. You are highly interested if its role in intercellular communication is conserved among the eukaryotes. You treat yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with the peptide and interestingly observe the formation of the shmoo. You want to learn about the proteome of the active chromatin in the shmoo and recover it by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. The least of proteins from which complex below will you observe in your assay?', choice1='pre-initiation complex', choice2='pre-replication complex', choice3='enhancer protein complex', choice4='nucleosome histone complex', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The question involves understanding which protein complex is least likely to be observed in the active chromatin of a shmoo in yeast. The shmoo is a structure formed during yeast mating, which involves changes in gene expression but not DNA replication. The pre-initiation complex is involved in transcription initiation, the enhancer protein complex is involved in transcription regulation, and the nucleosome histone complex is part of chromatin structure. The pre-replication complex is involved in DNA replication, which is not occurring during shmoo formation. Therefore, the pre-replication complex is least likely to be observed.
