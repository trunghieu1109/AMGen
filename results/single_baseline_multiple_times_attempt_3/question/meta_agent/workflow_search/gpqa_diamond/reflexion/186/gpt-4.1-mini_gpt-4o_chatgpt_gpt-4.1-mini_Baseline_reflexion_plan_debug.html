    <pre>To determine which stars are detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph, we need to consider the apparent magnitude of each star as seen from Earth. The ESPRESSO spectrograph is capable of achieving a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel for stars with apparent magnitudes up to about 16 in a 1-hour exposure. 

Let&#39;s calculate the apparent magnitudes for the stars listed:

1. Canopus: Canopus is a very bright star with an apparent magnitude of about -0.74. It is easily detectable.

2. Polaris: Polaris has an apparent magnitude of about 1.98. It is also easily detectable.

3. Star with Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag at 10 pc: The apparent magnitude is the same as the absolute magnitude at 10 pc, so it is 15 mag. This is detectable.

4. Star with Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag at 200 pc: The apparent magnitude is 15 + 5 * log10(200/10) = 15 + 5 * log10(20) = 15 + 5 * 1.301 = 15 + 6.505 = 21.505. This is not detectable.

5. Star with Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag at 5 pc: The apparent magnitude is 15 + 5 * log10(5/10) = 15 - 5 * 0.301 = 15 - 1.505 = 13.495. This is detectable.

6. Star with Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag at 50 pc: The apparent magnitude is 15 + 5 * log10(50/10) = 15 + 5 * log10(5) = 15 + 5 * 0.699 = 15 + 3.495 = 18.495. This is not detectable.

Therefore, the detectable stars are Canopus, Polaris, the star at 10 pc, and the star at 5 pc. This makes a total of 4 detectable stars.
