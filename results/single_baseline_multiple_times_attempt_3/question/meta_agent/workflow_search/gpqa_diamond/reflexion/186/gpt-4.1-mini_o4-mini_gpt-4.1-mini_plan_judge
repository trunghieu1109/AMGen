Question: Example(question='How many of the stars listed below would be detectable using the ESPRESSO spectrograph, when it is coupled with one of the 8m VLT telescopes at the Paranal Observatory? A star is considered detectable if a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure is achieved.\n\nFor more details about the ESPRESSO spectrograph, please refer to the following link:\nhttps://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/instruments/espresso/overview.html\n\na) Canopus\nb) Polaris\nc) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 10 pc distance from us.\nd) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 200 pc distance from us.\ne) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 5 pc distance from us.\nf) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 50 pc distance from us.', choice1='4', choice2='3', choice3='2', choice4='5', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: We need the apparent magnitudes of each star and compare to ESPRESSO’s limit for S/N≥10 in 1 h on an 8 m telescope (~V≈16). Canopus (V≈–0.7) and Polaris (V≈2) are easily detectable. For the absolute V=15 stars:
• at 10 pc: m=15+5 log(10/10)=15 ✓
• at 5 pc: m=15+5 log(5/10)=13.5 ✓
• at 50 pc: m=15+5 log(50/10)=18.5 ✗
• at 200 pc: m=15+5 log(200/10)=21.5 ✗
Thus 4 stars (a, b, c, e) meet S/N≥10 in 1 h → 4.
