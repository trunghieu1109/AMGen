proposed answer: First, we need to determine the apparent magnitude of each star to assess if ESPRESSO can detect it with S/N >= 10 in 1 hour. The detection limit of ESPRESSO on an 8m VLT is roughly around V ~ 16 mag for S/N=10 in 1 hour exposure. 

For stars a) Canopus and b) Polaris, both are very bright stars (Canopus ~ -5.5 mag, Polaris ~ 2 mag), so they are easily detectable.

For stars c) to f), all have absolute magnitude Mv = 15 mag. We calculate apparent magnitude m using the distance modulus formula: m = M + 5*log10(d) - 5, where d is distance in parsecs.

c) d=10 pc: m = 15 + 5*log10(10) - 5 = 15 + 5*1 - 5 = 15 + 5 - 5 = 15

d) d=200 pc: m = 15 + 5*log10(200) - 5 = 15 + 5*2.301 - 5 = 15 + 11.505 - 5 = 21.505

e) d=5 pc: m = 15 + 5*log10(5) - 5 = 15 + 5*0.699 - 5 = 15 + 3.495 - 5 = 13.495

f) d=50 pc: m = 15 + 5*log10(50) - 5 = 15 + 5*1.699 - 5 = 15 + 8.495 - 5 = 18.495

Now, compare these apparent magnitudes to the detection limit (~16 mag):
- c) 15 mag < 16 mag, detectable
- d) 21.5 mag > 16 mag, not detectable
- e) 13.5 mag < 16 mag, detectable
- f) 18.5 mag > 16 mag, not detectable

So, detectable stars are: a) Canopus, b) Polaris, c) star at 10 pc, e) star at 5 pc. Total = 4 stars.

Therefore, the answer is 4 detectable stars.
