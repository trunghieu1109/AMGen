Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent OqPs', content='The observed count distribution is given per unit parallax: n_p(p)∝1/p^5. But parallax p=1/r so dp/dr=−1/r^2. The count per distance interval is n_r(r)dr=n_p(p)|dp|=(k/p^5)(1/r^2 dr). Since p=1/r, p^5=1/r^5, so n_r(r)∝(r^5)(1/r^2)=r^3. Hence the number per unit distance scales as r^3.\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
