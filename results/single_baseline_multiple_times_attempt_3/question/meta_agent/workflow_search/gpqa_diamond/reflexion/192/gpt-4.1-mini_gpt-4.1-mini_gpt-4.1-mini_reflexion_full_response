Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent OqPs', content='Given that the number of stars varies with parallax (plx) as 1/plx^5, and parallax is inversely proportional to distance (r), i.e., plx = 1/r. Substituting plx = 1/r into the expression, the number of stars varies as 1/(1/r)^5 = r^5. Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance varies as r^5.\n\nAnswer:D)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
