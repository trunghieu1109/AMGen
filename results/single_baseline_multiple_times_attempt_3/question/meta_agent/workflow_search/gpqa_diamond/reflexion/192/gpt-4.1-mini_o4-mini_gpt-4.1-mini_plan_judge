Question: Example(question='In a specific region of the sky, astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?', choice1='~ r^2', choice2='~ r^4', choice3='~ r^3', choice4='~ r^5', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The observed count distribution is given per unit parallax: n_p(p)∝1/p^5. But parallax p=1/r so dp/dr=−1/r^2. The count per distance interval is n_r(r)dr=n_p(p)|dp|=(k/p^5)(1/r^2 dr). Since p=1/r, p^5=1/r^5, so n_r(r)∝(r^5)(1/r^2)=r^3. Hence the number per unit distance scales as r^3.
