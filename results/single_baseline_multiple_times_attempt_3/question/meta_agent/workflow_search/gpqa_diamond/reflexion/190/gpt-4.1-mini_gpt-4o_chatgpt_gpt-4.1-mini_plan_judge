Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The starting compound is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. First, it is treated with sodium hydride and benzyl bromide, which likely results in the formation of a benzyl ether at the hydroxymethyl group, giving 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Next, treatment with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide and HCl likely forms a tosylhydrazone, replacing the ketone group. Then, treatment with n-butyllithium and aqueous ammonium chloride likely results in a Shapiro reaction, which removes the tosylhydrazone and forms an alkene, specifically reducing the ketone to an alkane, resulting in 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexane. Finally, hydrogenation with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere would reduce any remaining double bonds, but since the only double bond was already reduced, the main effect would be to remove the benzyl protecting group, resulting in (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.
