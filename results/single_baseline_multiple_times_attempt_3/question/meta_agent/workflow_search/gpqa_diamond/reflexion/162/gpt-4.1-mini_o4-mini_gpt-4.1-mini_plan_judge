Question: Example(question='We would like to dissolve (at 25°С) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm3 total volume. What is the minimum volume (cm3) of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution and what is the pH of the resulting solution?', choice1='pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3', choice2='pH 2.69; 30.09 cm3', choice3='pH 3.16; 32.14 cm3', choice4='pH 4.94; 20.40 cm3', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To prevent re‐precipitation of Fe(OH)₃, the free [H⁺] must be high enough so that [Fe³⁺]=0.00936 M does not exceed Ksp/[OH⁻]³. Using pKsp≈36, one finds pH≈2.69 and V≈(3nFe + nH⁺,free)/0.1≈30.09 mL.
