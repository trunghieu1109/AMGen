Question: Example(question='We would like to dissolve (at 25°С) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm3 total volume. What is the minimum volume (cm3) of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution and what is the pH of the resulting solution?', choice1='pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3', choice2='pH 2.69; 30.09 cm3', choice3='pH 3.16; 32.14 cm3', choice4='pH 4.94; 20.40 cm3', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: First, calculate the moles of Fe(OH)3 to be dissolved. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is approximately 106.87 g/mol. Moles of Fe(OH)3 = 0.1 g / 106.87 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 mol. Fe(OH)3 is a base and will react with the strong acid (H+) in a 1:3 molar ratio because each Fe(OH)3 has 3 OH- groups. So, moles of H+ needed = 3 * 0.000936 mol = 0.002808 mol. The acid concentration is 0.1 M, so volume of acid needed = moles / concentration = 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 L = 28.08 cm3. The total volume is 100 cm3, so the remaining volume is water. The pH is determined by the excess H+ after neutralizing Fe(OH)3. Since all H+ is consumed to dissolve Fe(OH)3, the pH will be determined by the concentration of H+ in the final solution. The total volume after mixing is 100 cm3, and the acid volume is 28.08 cm3, so the final concentration of H+ is (0.1 M * 28.08 cm3) / 100 cm3 = 0.02808 M. pH = -log(0.02808) ≈ 1.55. However, the choices have pH values higher than this, so considering the hydrolysis and equilibrium, the pH will be slightly higher. Among the options, the closest volume is 28.05 cm3 with pH 2.04, which is reasonable considering the approximations.
