Question: Example(question='Imagine an operator $\\vec{P}$ of a system have components $P_x, P_y$ and $P_z$. The matrix form of the  operator $P_x$ has components in the first row as $(0, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,\\hbar/\\sqrt{2},0)$.  The matrix form of the  operator $P_y$ has components in the first row as $(0, -i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0, -i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2},0)$. Similarly, matrix form of the  operator $P_z$ has components in the first row as $(\\hbar, 0, 0)$, that in the second row as $(0, 0, 0)$ and that in the third row as $(0,0, -\\hbar)$. The basis vectors here are the eigenvectors of $P_z$. The system is found in the eigenstate of $P_x$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$. To be more specific, the explicit form of the state of the system is given by the column vector having elements $(-1/2, 1/\\sqrt{2}, -1/2)$. What is the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z $ of $P_z$', choice1='\\hbar\n', choice2='\\hbar/2', choice3='\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}\n', choice4='\\sqrt{2}\\hbar', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The P_z eigenvalues are ħ,0,−ħ. The state amplitudes in this basis are a1=−1/2, a2=1/√2, a3=−1/2 giving probabilities p1=1/4, p2=1/2, p3=1/4. Then ⟨P_z⟩=ħ(p1−p3)=ħ(1/4−1/4)=0 and ⟨P_z^2⟩=ħ^2(p1+p3)=ħ^2/2. Thus ΔP_z=√(⟨P_z^2⟩−⟨P_z⟩^2)=ħ/√2.
