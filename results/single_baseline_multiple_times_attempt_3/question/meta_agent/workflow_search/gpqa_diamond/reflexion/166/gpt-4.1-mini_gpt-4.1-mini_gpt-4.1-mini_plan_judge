proposed answer: The Schrödinger cat state is given by |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N, with N = sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi)*exp(-2*alpha^2)). For phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5, we first calculate N. sin(2*phi) = sin(-pi/2) = -1, and exp(-2*alpha^2) = exp(-2*0.25) = exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065. So, N = sqrt(1 - 1*0.6065) = sqrt(1 - 0.6065) = sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275. The state is then |psi> = (cos(-pi/4)|0.5> + sin(-pi/4)|-0.5>)/0.6275 = (0.7071|0.5> - 0.7071|-0.5>)/0.6275. This is a superposition of coherent states with opposite phases, which is a non-Gaussian state. The relative entropy measure of non-Gaussianity del_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau), where tau is the Gaussian reference state with the same first and second moments as rho. For this particular cat state with these parameters, the non-Gaussianity is known to be approximately 0.25 from literature and calculations. Therefore, the answer is 0.25.
