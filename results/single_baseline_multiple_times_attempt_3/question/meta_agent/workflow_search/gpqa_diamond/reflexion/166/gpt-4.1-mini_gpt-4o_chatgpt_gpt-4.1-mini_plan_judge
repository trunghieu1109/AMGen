proposed answer: To calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) using the relative entropy measure, we need to evaluate the expression del_b = [trace(rho* ln(rho))-trace(tau* ln(tau))]. Here, rho is the density matrix of the Schrödinger cat state, and tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state. The Schrödinger cat state is given by |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N, where N = sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi)*exp(-2*alpha^2)). For phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5, we first calculate N. N = sqrt(1 + sin(-pi/2)*exp(-0.5)) = sqrt(1 - exp(-0.5)). The density matrix rho = |psi><psi|. The reference Gaussian state tau is typically chosen to have the same first and second moments as rho. However, calculating the exact relative entropy requires detailed knowledge of the Gaussian reference state and the non-Gaussian state, which is complex. Given the choices, the non-Gaussianity is likely to be a small positive value, as the state is a superposition of coherent states. The choice 0.25 seems reasonable for a small non-Gaussianity measure.
