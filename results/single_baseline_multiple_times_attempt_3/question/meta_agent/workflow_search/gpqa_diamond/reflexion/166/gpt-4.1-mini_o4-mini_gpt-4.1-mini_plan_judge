proposed answer: We need the non-Gaussianity of the pure cat state for φ=–π/4, α=0.5, using the relative-entropy measure: δ_b = Tr(ρ lnρ) – Tr(τ lnτ). Since ρ is pure, Tr(ρ lnρ)=0, so δ_b = –Tr(τ lnτ)=S(τ), the von Neumann entropy of the Gaussian reference τ with the same first and second moments as ρ. For φ=–π/4 the cat is the odd cat state |ψ->=(|α>–|–α>)/√(2(1–e^{-2α^2})). Its first moments vanish; the second moments give n̄=<a†a>=α^2(1+e^{-2α^2})/(1–e^{-2α^2}) ≈1.0208, and ⟨a^2⟩=α^2=0.25. From these we get ⟨x²⟩=(2α²+2n̄+1)/2≈1.7708 and ⟨p²⟩=(–2α²+2n̄+1)/2≈1.2708, giving detV≈2.249 and symplectic eigenvalue ν≈1.4997. Thus S(τ)=(ν+½)ln(ν+½)–(ν–½)ln(ν–½)≈1.385. This matches choice C).
