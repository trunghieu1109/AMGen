Ratio ≃10^7/4×10^9≈2×10⁻³–10⁻², so ≃10⁻².\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent 3IcK:\nThe pp-III branch produces the high‐energy B8 neutrinos (continuous up to ~14\u2009MeV). Stopping pp‐III removes essentially all B8 in both bands. What remains in 700–800\u2009keV is only the small CNO continuum (N13+O15) of order ~3×10^7\u2009cm⁻²\u2009s⁻¹. In 800–900\u2009keV the dominant flux is the monoenergetic 0.862\u2009MeV Be7 line (~4.8×10^9\u2009cm⁻²\u2009s⁻¹) plus a small CNO tail (~3×10^7), so ~4.8×10^9\u2009cm⁻²\u2009s⁻¹. Ratio ≃3×10^7/4.8×10^9≈6×10⁻³ ~10⁻².\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent NcUY:\nStopping the pp-III (8B) branch removes all neutrinos in both the 700–800 keV and 800–900 keV windows, so their absolute fluxes drop to zero but their ratio remains the same as set by the shape of the 8B spectrum. Near these low energies the 8B spectrum varies slowly, so ∫700–800 keV\u2009dφ ≃ ∫800–900 keV\u2009dφ and the ratio ≃1.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent eOCo:\nWe compare neutrino sources in 700–800 keV vs 800–900 keV. pp neutrinos end at 420 keV, pep at 1.44 MeV. In 800–900 keV the dominant flux is the Be7 line (862 keV) ≃5×10^9 cm⁻²s⁻¹; in 700–800 keV only CNO (N13+O15) plus a tiny B8 tail, total ≃5×10^8. So flux1/flux2≈0.1. Stopping pp-III removes B8 neutrinos, a negligible contribution here, so ratio stays ≃0.1.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent q69j:\nD)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 3IcK:\nD)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent NcUY:\nC)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent eOCo:\nA)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
