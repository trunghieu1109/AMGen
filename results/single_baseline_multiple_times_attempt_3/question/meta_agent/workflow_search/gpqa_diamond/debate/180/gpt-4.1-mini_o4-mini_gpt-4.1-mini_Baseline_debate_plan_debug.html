    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Very large number of neutrinos produced by the Sun reach the Earth (very large flux of neutrinos, defined as the number of neutrinos per cm^2, per second).\n\nLet us assume that, hypothetically, the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the core of the Sun about 8 and a half minutes ago, while all other reactions remained as they were.\n\nWhat would be the approximate ratio of the flux between two bands of neutrino energies of 700-800 KeV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). \n\nFlux (band 1) / flux (band 2) is:\n\n(Note: we are talking about stopping the pp-III branch, not pp-II, pp-I or any other. It’s not a typo or something like that.)\n(Note 2: solar neutrino flavor changes happen, but do not play a role here.)&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;0.1 (10^-1).&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;10.&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;1.&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;0.01 (10^-2).&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent q69j:
The pp-III branch (B-8 neutrinos) is cut off, so neutrino flux in 700–800 keV comes only from CNO sources (~10^7 cm⁻² s⁻¹), whereas 800–900 keV gets the monoenergetic 862 keV Be-7 line (~4×10^9) plus minor CNO. Ratio ≃10^7/4×10^9≈2×10⁻³–10⁻², so ≃10⁻².

### thinking by Debate Agent 3IcK:
The pp-III branch produces the high‐energy B8 neutrinos (continuous up to ~14 MeV). Stopping pp‐III removes essentially all B8 in both bands. What remains in 700–800 keV is only the small CNO continuum (N13+O15) of order ~3×10^7 cm⁻² s⁻¹. In 800–900 keV the dominant flux is the monoenergetic 0.862 MeV Be7 line (~4.8×10^9 cm⁻² s⁻¹) plus a small CNO tail (~3×10^7), so ~4.8×10^9 cm⁻² s⁻¹. Ratio ≃3×10^7/4.8×10^9≈6×10⁻³ ~10⁻².

### thinking by Debate Agent NcUY:
Stopping the pp-III (8B) branch removes all neutrinos in both the 700–800 keV and 800–900 keV windows, so their absolute fluxes drop to zero but their ratio remains the same as set by the shape of the 8B spectrum. Near these low energies the 8B spectrum varies slowly, so ∫700–800 keV dφ ≃ ∫800–900 keV dφ and the ratio ≃1.

### thinking by Debate Agent eOCo:
We compare neutrino sources in 700–800 keV vs 800–900 keV. pp neutrinos end at 420 keV, pep at 1.44 MeV. In 800–900 keV the dominant flux is the Be7 line (862 keV) ≃5×10^9 cm⁻²s⁻¹; in 700–800 keV only CNO (N13+O15) plus a tiny B8 tail, total ≃5×10^8. So flux1/flux2≈0.1. Stopping pp-III removes B8 neutrinos, a negligible contribution here, so ratio stays ≃0.1.

    <pre>The 700–800 keV window has only CNO neutrinos (~2×10^8 cm⁻²s⁻¹) once B-8 is removed. The 800–900 keV window includes the 0.861 MeV Be 7 line (~5×10^9) plus a small CNO tail (~1×10^8), total ~5.1×10^9. Ratio ≃2×10^8/5.1×10^9≈4×10^−2, so of order 10^−2.
