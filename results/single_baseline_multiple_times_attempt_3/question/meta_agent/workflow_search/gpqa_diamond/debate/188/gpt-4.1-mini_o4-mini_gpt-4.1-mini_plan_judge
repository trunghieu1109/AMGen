Question: Example(question='Which of the following (effective) particles is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry?', choice1='Magnon', choice2='Skyrmion', choice3='Pion', choice4='Phonon', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: Magnons are Goldstone bosons from broken spin-rotation symmetry, pions are (pseudo-)Goldstone bosons from broken chiral symmetry, phonons are Goldstone bosons from broken translational symmetry. A skyrmion is a topological soliton, not a Goldstone mode of a spontaneously broken symmetry.

Answer:B)
Extracted answer: B)
Correct answer: 2
