### thinking by Debate Agent ctX7:
Magnons are quasiparticles associated with spin waves in a magnetically ordered system, which arise due to spontaneous breaking of spin rotational symmetry. Pions are pseudo-Goldstone bosons resulting from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics. Phonons are quanta of lattice vibrations and are associated with the breaking of continuous translational symmetry in a crystal lattice. Skyrmions, however, are topological solitons representing stable, particle-like spin textures, but they are not themselves Goldstone modes arising from a spontaneously broken continuous symmetry. Instead, they are topological excitations. Therefore, the effective particle not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry is the Skyrmion.

### thinking by Debate Agent g2dS:
Magnons are quasiparticles associated with spin waves in a magnetically ordered system, arising due to spontaneously broken spin rotational symmetry. Pions are pseudo-Goldstone bosons resulting from the spontaneously broken chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics. Phonons are quasiparticles representing quantized lattice vibrations and are associated with the spontaneously broken continuous translation symmetry in a crystal lattice. Skyrmions, however, are topological solitons or particle-like excitations in certain field theories and magnetic systems, but they are not Goldstone bosons associated with spontaneously broken continuous symmetries. Instead, they are stable topological configurations. Therefore, the effective particle not associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry is the Skyrmion.

### thinking by Debate Agent bA1y:
A spontaneously-broken symmetry leads to the emergence of Nambu-Goldstone bosons, which are collective excitations or effective particles associated with the broken symmetry. Magnons are spin wave excitations due to broken spin rotational symmetry. Pions are pseudo-Goldstone bosons from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in QCD. Phonons arise from the spontaneous breaking of continuous translational symmetry in a crystal lattice. Skyrmions, however, are topological solitons and not Goldstone bosons; they are stable field configurations rather than excitations corresponding to spontaneously broken symmetries. Therefore, the particle not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry is the Skyrmion.

Magnons are quasiparticles associated with the spontaneous breaking of spin rotational symmetry in magnets. Pions are pseudo-Goldstone bosons arising from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics. Phonons are quasiparticles associated with the spontaneous breaking of continuous translational symmetry in crystals. Skyrmions, however, are topological solitons representing stable field configurations and are not themselves Goldstone bosons or quasiparticles arising from a spontaneously broken symmetry. Therefore, the effective particle not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry is the Skyrmion.

    <pre>Magnons, pions, and phonons are all associated with spontaneously broken symmetries, as they are Goldstone bosons or pseudo-Goldstone bosons arising from such symmetry breaking. Magnons come from broken spin rotational symmetry, pions from broken chiral symmetry, and phonons from broken translational symmetry. Skyrmions, on the other hand, are topological solitons and do not arise as Goldstone bosons from spontaneously broken continuous symmetries. Therefore, the effective particle not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry is the Skyrmion.
