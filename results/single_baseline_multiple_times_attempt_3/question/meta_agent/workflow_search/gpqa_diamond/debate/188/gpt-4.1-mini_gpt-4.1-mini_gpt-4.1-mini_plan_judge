Question: Example(question='Which of the following (effective) particles is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry?', choice1='Magnon', choice2='Skyrmion', choice3='Pion', choice4='Phonon', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: Magnons, pions, and phonons are all associated with spontaneously broken symmetries, as they are Goldstone bosons or pseudo-Goldstone bosons arising from such symmetry breaking. Magnons come from broken spin rotational symmetry, pions from broken chiral symmetry, and phonons from broken translational symmetry. Skyrmions, on the other hand, are topological solitons and do not arise as Goldstone bosons from spontaneously broken continuous symmetries. Therefore, the effective particle not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry is the Skyrmion.
