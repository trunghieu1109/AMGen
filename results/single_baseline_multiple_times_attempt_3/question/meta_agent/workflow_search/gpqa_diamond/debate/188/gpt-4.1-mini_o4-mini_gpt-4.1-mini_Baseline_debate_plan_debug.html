### thinking by Debate Agent ctX7:
Magnons are Goldstone bosons from broken spin-rotation symmetry in magnets. Pions are Goldstone bosons from broken chiral symmetry in QCD. Phonons are Goldstone bosons from broken translational symmetry in crystals. Skyrmions are topological solitons, not Goldstone modes from spontaneously broken symmetry.

### thinking by Debate Agent g2dS:
We look for which excitation is not a Goldstone mode of a spontaneously broken symmetry. Magnons arise from broken spin rotational symmetry in magnets. Pions are (approximate) Goldstone bosons of broken chiral symmetry in QCD. Phonons are Goldstone bosons of broken continuous translational symmetry in crystals. Skyrmions, by contrast, are topological solitons, not Goldstone modes of a broken symmetry.

### thinking by Debate Agent bA1y:
We examine each candidate:
A) Magnon: a Goldstone boson of spontaneously broken spin rotational symmetry in magnets.
B) Skyrmion: a topological soliton in a non-linear sigma model, not itself arising as a Goldstone mode of a broken symmetry.
C) Pion: a (pseudo-)Goldstone boson of spontaneously broken chiral symmetry in QCD.
D) Phonon: a Goldstone boson of spontaneously broken continuous translational symmetry in a crystal lattice.
Thus the skyrmion is not associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking in the sense of Goldstone bosons.

### thinking by Debate Agent 5SLk:
We consider which effective particles arise as Goldstone bosons of spontaneously broken symmetries. Magnons are spin-wave excitationsâ€”Goldstone modes of broken spin-rotational symmetry in a magnet. Pions arise as (pseudo-)Goldstone bosons from spontaneously broken chiral symmetry in QCD. Phonons are Goldstone modes due to broken continuous translational symmetry in a crystal lattice. Skyrmions, by contrast, are topological solitons, not Goldstone bosons of a broken symmetry. Thus the correct answer is Skyrmion.
