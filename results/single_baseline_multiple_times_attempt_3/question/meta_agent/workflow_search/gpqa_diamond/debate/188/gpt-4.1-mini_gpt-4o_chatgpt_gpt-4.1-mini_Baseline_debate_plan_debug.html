### thinking by Debate Agent ctX7:
To solve this question, we need to determine which of the particles listed is not typically associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry. A magnon is a quasiparticle associated with the collective excitation of spins in a crystal lattice, related to the breaking of spin rotational symmetry. A skyrmion is a topological soliton used to describe certain configurations in field theories, often associated with spontaneously broken symmetries. A pion is a meson that arises as a result of the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics. A phonon is a quasiparticle representing quantized lattice vibrations, which is not typically associated with spontaneously-broken symmetry in the same way as the others. Therefore, the correct answer is the one that is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry, which is the phonon.

### thinking by Debate Agent g2dS:
To determine which particle is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry, let&#39;s analyze each option. A magnon is a quasiparticle representing a collective excitation in a periodic magnetic system, typically associated with the breaking of spin rotational symmetry. A skyrmion is a topological soliton solution that can arise in certain field theories, often associated with broken symmetries, especially in magnetic systems. A pion is a meson associated with the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). A phonon is a quasiparticle associated with lattice vibrations and is not directly linked to spontaneously-broken symmetry in the same way the others are. Therefore, the phonon is the particle not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry.

### thinking by Debate Agent bA1y:
In physics, certain particles are associated with spontaneously broken symmetries. Magnons are quasiparticles associated with the collective excitation of electron spins in a lattice, related to the breaking of spin rotational symmetry. Skyrmions are topological solitons that can occur in certain magnetic systems and are not directly associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry in the same way as Goldstone bosons. Pions are considered Goldstone bosons resulting from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics. Phonons are quasiparticles representing quantized lattice vibrations, typically associated with the breaking of translational symmetry. Among these, Skyrmions are not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry in the traditional sense like the others.

### thinking by Debate Agent 5SLk:
To determine which particle is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry, let&#39;s examine each option: A) Magnon is associated with spin waves in magnetic systems and involves spontaneously broken symmetry. B) Skyrmion is a topological soliton but not typically associated with spontaneously-broken symmetry in the same way as other particles here. C) Pion is a Goldstone boson from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics. D) Phonon is associated with lattice vibrations and involves spontaneously broken translational symmetry. Skyrmion, being a topological object, is not directly tied to spontaneously-broken symmetry in the same manner as the others.

    <pre>The question asks which particle is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry. Magnons are associated with the breaking of spin rotational symmetry, and pions are Goldstone bosons from the breaking of chiral symmetry. Phonons are related to lattice vibrations and are not typically associated with spontaneously-broken symmetry in the same way as Goldstone bosons. Skyrmions are topological solitons and are not directly tied to spontaneously-broken symmetry like Goldstone bosons. The debate agents are split between phonons and skyrmions. However, phonons are indeed related to broken translational symmetry, while skyrmions are more of a topological nature and not directly associated with spontaneously-broken symmetry in the traditional sense. Therefore, the correct answer is skyrmion.
