For electron–gas collisions, the cross section is πd^2 (no √2 factor), so λ2=1/(nσ_e)=√2·λ1≈1.414λ1, which is ≥1.22λ1.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent Cubc:\nThe mean free path λ1 was calculated for molecule–molecule collisions using λ1=1/(√2 nπd^2). For an electron beam scattering off stationary gas molecules, λ2=1/(nπd^2)=√2 λ1≈1.414 λ1. Since 1.414>1.22, λ2≥1.22 λ1.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent wmGl:\nMean free path for gas molecules λ1 = 1/(√2 nσ) due to molecular collisions with relative speed √2 v; for electrons, relative speed ≈ electron speed ≫ molecular thermal speed so λ2 = 1/(nσ_e). Since σ_e (electron–gas cross section) is much smaller than σ, λ2 ≫ λ1, certainly ≥1.22 λ1.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent mPTt:\nThe mean free path λ is inversely proportional to the scattering cross section times number density, λ = 1/(nσ). For gas molecules colliding among themselves, relative velocity gives an extra √2 in the denominator, so λ1 = 1/(√2\u2009nσ). For fast electrons scattering off stationary gas molecules, λ2 = 1/(nσ). Hence λ2 = √2\u2009λ1 ≈1.414\u2009λ1, which certainly exceeds 1.22\u2009λ1.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent g2Xu:\nD)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent Cubc:\nD)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent wmGl:\nD)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent mPTt:\nD)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
