Question: Example(question='While designing a high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating at an accelerating voltage of 1000 kV, Mike connected vacuum pumps to create an ultra-high vacuum state (< 10^-9 Torr) in the sample compartment, aiming to minimize the presence of gas molecules for improved electron microscopy. However, as expected, some gas particles remained inside the compartment, as detected by the mass spectrometer. Mike accurately determined the mean free path of these gas molecules in the vacuum state (< 10^-9 Torr) to be λ1, based on factors such as sample compartment volume, pressure, and temperature. However, upon initiating the electron beam, he made an intriguing observation concerning the mean free path based on electron scattering with the gas molecules. He found that the mean free path was no longer equal to λ1; rather, it was λ2, even though the sample compartment temperature remained the same.\n\nWhat can we conclude about λ2 based on the aforementioned scenario?', choice1="λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation", choice2='λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1', choice3='λ2 < λ1', choice4='λ2 >= 1.22*λ1', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The mean free path λ1 is the average distance gas molecules travel before colliding with each other under ultra-high vacuum conditions. When the electron beam is introduced, the mean free path λ2 refers to the average distance electrons travel before scattering off gas molecules. Electron scattering cross-sections are typically smaller than molecular collision cross-sections, meaning electrons can travel further on average before scattering. Empirical and theoretical data suggest that λ2 is approximately 1.22 times or greater than λ1. Since temperature and pressure remain constant, the difference arises from the nature of electron scattering versus molecular collisions. Therefore, λ2 ≥ 1.22*λ1 is the correct conclusion.
