proposed answer: The system has three spins S1, S2, and S3, each can be +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). There are 2^3 = 8 possible configurations. Calculating the energy for each configuration, we find that the energy is either -3J (when all spins are the same) or J (when one spin differs). Specifically, there are 2 configurations with energy -3J and 6 configurations with energy J. The partition function Z is the sum over all states of e^(-beta * E), which equals 2 * e^{3J beta} + 6 * e^{-J beta}. This matches choice A exactly.
