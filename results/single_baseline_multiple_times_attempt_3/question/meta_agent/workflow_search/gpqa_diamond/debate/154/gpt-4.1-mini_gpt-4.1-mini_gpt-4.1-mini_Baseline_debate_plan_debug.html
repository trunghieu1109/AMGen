### thinking by Debate Agent cXsv:
Given the operators P_x, P_y, and P_z with their matrix forms, and the system is in the eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ, specifically the state vector |ψ⟩ = (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2)^T in the P_z eigenbasis. We want to find the uncertainty ΔP_z for this state. The uncertainty ΔP_z is given by ΔP_z = sqrt(&lt;P_z^2&gt; - &lt;P_z&gt;^2). First, we calculate &lt;P_z&gt; = ⟨ψ|P_z|ψ⟩. P_z is diagonal with entries (ħ, 0, -ħ). So, &lt;P_z&gt; = (-1/2)*ħ*(-1/2) + (1/√2)*0*(1/√2) + (-1/2)*(-ħ)*(-1/2) = |c1|^2*ħ + |c2|^2*0 + |c3|^2*(-ħ). The coefficients are c1 = -1/2, c2 = 1/√2, c3 = -1/2. Their squares are (1/4), (1/2), (1/4), sum to 1 as expected. So &lt;P_z&gt; = (1/4)*ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ) = (1/4)ħ - (1/4)ħ = 0. Next, &lt;P_z^2&gt; = ⟨ψ|P_z^2|ψ⟩. Since P_z^2 is diagonal with entries ħ^2, 0, ħ^2, we have &lt;P_z^2&gt; = (1/4)*ħ^2 + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*ħ^2 = (1/4 + 1/4)ħ^2 = (1/2)ħ^2. Therefore, ΔP_z = sqrt(&lt;P_z^2&gt; - &lt;P_z&gt;^2) = sqrt((1/2)ħ^2 - 0) = ħ/√2.

### thinking by Debate Agent Gp5k:
We are given a quantum state vector |ψ⟩ in the P_z eigenbasis: |ψ⟩ = (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). The operator P_z is diagonal in this basis with eigenvalues corresponding to the basis vectors: (ħ, 0, -ħ). We need to find the uncertainty ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²).

Step 1: Compute ⟨P_z⟩ = ⟨ψ|P_z|ψ⟩.

|ψ⟩ = 
  (-1/2)
  (1/√2)
  (-1/2)

P_z = diag(ħ, 0, -ħ)

⟨P_z⟩ = (-1/2)* ħ * (-1/2) + (1/√2)*0*(1/√2) + (-1/2)*(-ħ)*(-1/2)
= ħ*(-1/2)^2 + 0 + (-ħ)*(-1/2)^2
= ħ*(1/4) + 0 + (-ħ)*(1/4)
= ħ/4 - ħ/4 = 0

Step 2: Compute ⟨P_z²⟩ = ⟨ψ|P_z²|ψ⟩.

P_z² = diag(ħ², 0, ħ²)

⟨P_z²⟩ = (-1/2)* ħ² * (-1/2) + (1/√2)*0*(1/√2) + (-1/2)* ħ² * (-1/2)
= ħ²*(1/4) + 0 + ħ²*(1/4) = ħ²/4 + ħ²/4 = ħ²/2

Step 3: Calculate uncertainty

ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²) = sqrt(ħ²/2 - 0) = ħ/√2

Therefore, the uncertainty ΔP_z = ħ/√2.

### thinking by Debate Agent zrGJ:
Given the operator P_z with matrix form diagonal as diag(ħ, 0, -ħ), and the state vector |ψ&gt; = (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2) which is an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ, we need to find the uncertainty ΔP_z. The uncertainty ΔP_z is given by sqrt(&lt;P_z^2&gt; - &lt;P_z&gt;^2). First, calculate &lt;P_z&gt; = &lt;ψ|P_z|ψ&gt; and &lt;P_z^2&gt; = &lt;ψ|P_z^2|ψ&gt;. Since P_z is diagonal with eigenvalues ħ, 0, -ħ, P_z^2 will have eigenvalues ħ^2, 0, ħ^2. Compute &lt;P_z&gt; = (-1/2)*ħ*(-1/2) + (1/√2)*0*(1/√2) + (-1/2)*(-ħ)*(-1/2) = (-1/2)^2*ħ + 0 + (-1/2)^2*(-ħ) = (1/4)ħ - (1/4)ħ = 0. Compute &lt;P_z^2&gt; = (1/4)ħ^2 + 0 + (1/4)ħ^2 = (1/2)ħ^2. Therefore, ΔP_z = sqrt(&lt;P_z^2&gt; - &lt;P_z&gt;^2) = sqrt((1/2)ħ^2 - 0) = ħ/√2.

### thinking by Debate Agent MGzN:
First, identify the given state vector in the Pz eigenbasis: |ψ⟩ = (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2)^T. The eigenvalues of Pz are ħ, 0, and -ħ corresponding to basis vectors (1,0,0), (0,1,0), and (0,0,1) respectively.

Calculate ⟨Pz⟩ = ⟨ψ|Pz|ψ⟩:
⟨Pz⟩ = (-1/2)*ħ*(-1/2) + (1/√2)*0*(1/√2) + (-1/2)*(-ħ)*(-1/2) = (-1/2)^2 * ħ + 0 + (-1/2)^2 * (-ħ) = (1/4)ħ + 0 - (1/4)ħ = 0.

Calculate ⟨Pz²⟩ = ⟨ψ|Pz²|ψ⟩. Since eigenvalues squared are ħ², 0, and ħ² respectively:
⟨Pz²⟩ = (1/4)ħ² + 0 + (1/4)ħ² = (1/4 + 1/4)ħ² = (1/2)ħ².

The variance is ΔPz² = ⟨Pz²⟩ - ⟨Pz⟩² = (1/2)ħ² - 0 = (1/2)ħ².

Therefore, the uncertainty ΔPz = sqrt(1/2) ħ = ħ/√2.
