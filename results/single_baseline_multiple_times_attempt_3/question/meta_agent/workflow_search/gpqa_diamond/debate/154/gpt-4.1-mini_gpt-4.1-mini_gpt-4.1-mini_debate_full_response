We want to find the uncertainty ΔP_z for this state. The uncertainty ΔP_z is given by ΔP_z = sqrt(<P_z^2> - <P_z>^2). First, we calculate <P_z> = ⟨ψ|P_z|ψ⟩. P_z is diagonal with entries (ħ, 0, -ħ). So, <P_z> = (-1/2)*ħ*(-1/2) + (1/√2)*0*(1/√2) + (-1/2)*(-ħ)*(-1/2) = |c1|^2*ħ + |c2|^2*0 + |c3|^2*(-ħ). The coefficients are c1 = -1/2, c2 = 1/√2, c3 = -1/2. Their squares are (1/4), (1/2), (1/4), sum to 1 as expected. So <P_z> = (1/4)*ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ) = (1/4)ħ - (1/4)ħ = 0. Next, <P_z^2> = ⟨ψ|P_z^2|ψ⟩. Since P_z^2 is diagonal with entries ħ^2, 0, ħ^2, we have <P_z^2> = (1/4)*ħ^2 + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*ħ^2 = (1/4 + 1/4)ħ^2 = (1/2)ħ^2. Therefore, ΔP_z = sqrt(<P_z^2> - <P_z>^2) = sqrt((1/2)ħ^2 - 0) = ħ/√2.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent Gp5k:\nWe are given a quantum state vector |ψ⟩ in the P_z eigenbasis: |ψ⟩ = (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). The operator P_z is diagonal in this basis with eigenvalues corresponding to the basis vectors: (ħ, 0, -ħ). We need to find the uncertainty ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²).\n\nStep 1: Compute ⟨P_z⟩ = ⟨ψ|P_z|ψ⟩.\n\n|ψ⟩ = \n  (-1/2)\n  (1/√2)\n  (-1/2)\n\nP_z = diag(ħ, 0, -ħ)\n\n⟨P_z⟩ = (-1/2)* ħ * (-1/2) + (1/√2)*0*(1/√2) + (-1/2)*(-ħ)*(-1/2)\n= ħ*(-1/2)^2 + 0 + (-ħ)*(-1/2)^2\n= ħ*(1/4) + 0 + (-ħ)*(1/4)\n= ħ/4 - ħ/4 = 0\n\nStep 2: Compute ⟨P_z²⟩ = ⟨ψ|P_z²|ψ⟩.\n\nP_z² = diag(ħ², 0, ħ²)\n\n⟨P_z²⟩ = (-1/2)* ħ² * (-1/2) + (1/√2)*0*(1/√2) + (-1/2)* ħ² * (-1/2)\n= ħ²*(1/4) + 0 + ħ²*(1/4) = ħ²/4 + ħ²/4 = ħ²/2\n\nStep 3: Calculate uncertainty\n\nΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²) = sqrt(ħ²/2 - 0) = ħ/√2\n\nTherefore, the uncertainty ΔP_z = ħ/√2.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent zrGJ:\nGiven the operator P_z with matrix form diagonal as diag(ħ, 0, -ħ), and the state vector |ψ> = (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2) which is an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ, we need to find the uncertainty ΔP_z. The uncertainty ΔP_z is given by sqrt(<P_z^2> - <P_z>^2). First, calculate <P_z> = <ψ|P_z|ψ> and <P_z^2> = <ψ|P_z^2|ψ>. Since P_z is diagonal with eigenvalues ħ, 0, -ħ, P_z^2 will have eigenvalues ħ^2, 0, ħ^2. Compute <P_z> = (-1/2)*ħ*(-1/2) + (1/√2)*0*(1/√2) + (-1/2)*(-ħ)*(-1/2) = (-1/2)^2*ħ + 0 + (-1/2)^2*(-ħ) = (1/4)ħ - (1/4)ħ = 0. Compute <P_z^2> = (1/4)ħ^2 + 0 + (1/4)ħ^2 = (1/2)ħ^2. Therefore, ΔP_z = sqrt(<P_z^2> - <P_z>^2) = sqrt((1/2)ħ^2 - 0) = ħ/√2.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent MGzN:\nFirst, identify the given state vector in the Pz eigenbasis: |ψ⟩ = (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2)^T.

Since eigenvalues squared are ħ², 0, and ħ² respectively:\n⟨Pz²⟩ = (1/4)ħ² + 0 + (1/4)ħ² = (1/4 + 1/4)ħ² = (1/2)ħ².\n\nThe variance is ΔPz² = ⟨Pz²⟩ - ⟨Pz⟩² = (1/2)ħ² - 0 = (1/2)ħ².\n\nTherefore, the uncertainty ΔPz = sqrt(1/2) ħ = ħ/√2.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent cXsv:\nC)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent Gp5k:\nC)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent zrGJ:\nC)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent MGzN:\nC)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
