State components squared: |c1|^2=1/4, |c2|^2=1/2, |c3|^2=1/4. Eigenvalues p1=ħ,p2=0,p3=−ħ. So ⟨P_z⟩=(1/4)ħ+(1/2)·0+(1/4)(−ħ)=0. ⟨P_z^2⟩=(1/4)ħ^2+(1/2)·0+(1/4)ħ^2=½ħ^2. Thus ΔP_z=√(⟨P_z^2⟩−⟨P_z⟩^2)=ħ/√2.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent Gp5k:\nThe given state is in the P_z basis with components (−1/2,1/√2,−1/2). 〈P_z〉=ℏ[(1/4)−(1/4)]=0. 〈P_z^2〉=ℏ^2[(1/4)+(1/4)]=ℏ^2/2.  Thus ΔP_z=√(〈P_z^2〉−〈P_z〉^2)=ℏ/√2.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent zrGJ:\nWe have the state |ψ⟩ in the Pz‐basis as (a1,a2,a3) with a1=−1/2, a2=1/√2, a3=−1/2. Check normalization: |a1|^2+|a2|^2+|a3|^2=1/4+1/2+1/4=1.\nEigenvalues of Pz are ħ,0,−ħ. Compute ⟨Pz⟩=∑|ai|^2 m_i ħ = (1/4)(+ħ)+(1/2)(0)+(1/4)(−ħ)=0.\nCompute ⟨Pz^2⟩=∑|ai|^2 (m_i ħ)^2 = (1/4)(ħ^2)+(1/2)(0)+(1/4)(ħ^2)=ħ^2/2.\nVariance = ⟨Pz^2⟩−⟨Pz⟩^2 = ħ^2/2 ⇒ ΔPz=ħ/√2.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent MGzN:\nWe need ΔP_z = sqrt(<P_z^2> − <P_z>^2). The state ψ = (−1/2,1/√2,−1/2) is normalized. P_z has eigenvalues (ħ,0,−ħ). Compute <P_z> = (1/4)ħ + (1/2)0 + (1/4)(−ħ) = 0. Then <P_z^2> = (1/4)ħ^2 + (1/2)0 + (1/4)ħ^2 = ħ^2/2. Hence ΔP_z = ħ/√2.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent cXsv:\nC)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent Gp5k:\nC)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent zrGJ:\nC)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent MGzN:\nC)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
