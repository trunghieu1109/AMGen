Active chromatin will include the transcription pre-initiation complex, enhancer-binding factors (yeast UAS proteins), and nucleosome histone complexes with active marks. The pre-replication complex (loaded at origins for DNA synthesis) is not part of actively transcribed chromatin regions, especially under pheromone-induced G1 arrest. Hence, its proteins are least likely to be observed.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent dzzT:\nChromatin immunoprecipitation of active chromatin will pull down histones (nucleosome complex), transcription machinery (pre-initiation complex), and enhancer complexes bound at active genes. The pre-replication complex assembles at origins for DNA replication initiation, not at transcriptionally active loci, so it will be least represented in active chromatin proteome.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent tmsD:\nThe Shmoo is a pheromone‐arrested G1 cell engaging in active transcription to induce mating genes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation of active chromatin will recover transcriptional machinery (pre-initiation complex, enhancer proteins, histones). The pre-replication complex functions to license DNA replication origins in late M/G1, not specifically enriched on active chromatin during transcription, so its proteins will be least observed.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent 6XrI:\nActive chromatin in the shmoo is undergoing transcription. In a ChIP–MS assay targeting active chromatin you’d recover histones (nucleosome complex), general transcription machinery (pre-initiation complex), and likely transcription activators (enhancer protein complexes). The pre-replication complex assembles at replication origins in G1 but is not a feature of actively transcribed chromatin regions, so it would be least represented.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent fBw6:\nB)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent dzzT:\nB)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent tmsD:\nB)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 6XrI:\nB)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
