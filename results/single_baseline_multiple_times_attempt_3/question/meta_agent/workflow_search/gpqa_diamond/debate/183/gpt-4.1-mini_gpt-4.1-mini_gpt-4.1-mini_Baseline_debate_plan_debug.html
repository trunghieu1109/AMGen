### thinking by Debate Agent Xlyw:
We want to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. The target molecule has three substituents on the benzene ring: a tert-butyl group (an alkyl group), an ethoxy group (an ether), and a nitro group (-NO2). The numbering indicates the tert-butyl is at position 2, ethoxy at position 1, and nitro at position 3. The steps should be planned to introduce these substituents in the correct order, considering directing effects and reaction conditions.

Step 1: Introduce tert-butyl group by Friedel-Crafts alkylation using tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3. This is an ortho/para director.

Step 2: Introduce the nitro group by nitration (HNO3/H2SO4). Nitro is a meta director and deactivating.

Step 3: Introduce the ethoxy group. Since ethoxy is an electron-donating group, it can be introduced via nucleophilic aromatic substitution or via phenol intermediate followed by Williamson ether synthesis.

Given the options, the ethoxy group introduction is via NaOH/EtBr (Williamson ether synthesis) which requires a phenol intermediate.

To get phenol, diazotization and hydrolysis of an aniline group is a common route. So, reduction of nitro group to amine (Fe/HCl), then diazotization (NaNO2/HCl), then hydrolysis (H3O+, heat) to phenol, then alkylation with NaOH/EtBr to get ethoxy group.

The sequence should be:
1) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 (introduce tert-butyl)
2) nitration (HNO3/H2SO4)
3) reduction (Fe/HCl) to amine
4) diazotization (NaNO2/HCl)
5) hydrolysis (H3O+, heat) to phenol
6) alkylation (NaOH/EtBr) to ethoxy

Check the options for this sequence:

Choice 1: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; ... This has an extra nitration after reduction, which is unnecessary.

Choice 2: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ; v) dilute H2SO4 ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) Fe/HCl ; ix) HNO3/H2SO4

Here, sulfonation (SO3/H2SO4) is introduced unnecessarily, and Fe/HCl reduction is late.

Choice 3: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; viii) dilute H2SO4 ; ix) NaOH/EtBr

Again sulfonation and extra nitration steps are unnecessary.

Choice 4: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) SO3/H2SO4 ; vii) dilute H2SO4 ; viii) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; ix) NaOH/EtBr

Here, nitration is first, then reduction, then tert-butylation. But tert-butylation is Friedel-Crafts alkylation which does not work well on strongly deactivated rings (like nitrobenzene). So tert-butylation should be first. Also, sulfonation is unnecessary.

Therefore, the best choice is Choice 1, as it follows the logical sequence (tert-butylation, nitration, reduction, diazotization, hydrolysis, alkylation) with minimal unnecessary steps (though it has an extra nitration at iv), but the rest matches best.

Hence, the answer is A).

We want to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. The target molecule has three substituents on the benzene ring: a tert-butyl group at position 2, an ethoxy group at position 1, and a nitro group at position 3. Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Start with benzene.
2. Introduce the tert-butyl group via Friedel-Crafts alkylation using tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3. This will direct subsequent electrophilic substitutions ortho/para to the tert-butyl group.
3. Next, introduce the nitro group via nitration (HNO3/H2SO4). The nitro group is meta-directing, but since tert-butyl is ortho/para directing and activating, nitration will occur mainly ortho and para to tert-butyl. We want the nitro at position 3 relative to the ethoxy group, which will be at position 1.

4. The ethoxy group (–OEt) is an activating, ortho/para directing substituent. To introduce ethoxy, we can first introduce a hydroxyl group (phenol) and then convert it to ethoxy by alkylation with EtBr/NaOH.

5. To get the hydroxyl group at position 1, we can introduce a diazonium salt and then hydrolyze it. The amino group can be introduced by reducing a nitro group or via Sandmeyer reaction.

6. The sequence must ensure that the tert-butyl group is introduced first to direct substitution, then nitration, then amino group introduction, then diazotization and hydrolysis to phenol, then alkylation to ethoxy.

Analyzing choices:
- Choice 1: tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → nitration → Fe/HCl (reduction of nitro to amino) → nitration again? That seems off.
- Choice 2: tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → nitration → sulfonation → diazotization → hydrolysis → alkylation → reduction → nitration. This sequence is complicated and seems off.
- Choice 3: tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → sulfonation → nitration → reduction → diazotization → nitration → hydrolysis → alkylation. This seems more consistent with protecting groups and substitution order.
- Choice 4: nitration first, then reduction, then tert-butylation, which is not ideal because tert-butylation is sensitive and best done first.

Therefore, Choice 3 best fits the logical sequence: first tert-butylation, then sulfonation (to block positions), nitration, reduction of nitro to amino, diazotization, nitration again, hydrolysis, then alkylation to ethoxy.

Answer: C)

### thinking by Debate Agent OaCI:
We want to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene in high yield. Let&#39;s analyze the target molecule and the sequence of reactions.

Target molecule features:
- A tert-butyl group at position 2
- An ethoxy group (–OEt) at position 1
- A nitro group (–NO2) at position 3

Stepwise reasoning:
1. First, introduce the tert-butyl group on benzene via Friedel-Crafts alkylation using tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3. This will give tert-butylbenzene.
2. Next, nitration with HNO3/H2SO4 to introduce the nitro group. The tert-butyl group is ortho/para directing, so nitration will mainly give substitution at ortho and para positions relative to tert-butyl. The nitro group should be at position 3 (meta to ethoxy, ortho to tert-butyl).
3. Introduce the ethoxy group. Since direct alkylation of benzene is difficult, usually the ethoxy group is introduced via nucleophilic aromatic substitution or via phenol intermediate.

From the steps given, the introduction of ethoxy group may be achieved by first converting the aromatic ring to a phenol or via diazonium salt and then substitution with ethoxide.

Looking at the sequences:
- Some sequences involve Fe/HCl which is reduction of nitro to amino, then NaNO2/HCl to diazotize, then substitution with NaOH/EtBr to introduce ethoxy group.

Therefore, the logical sequence is:
- Friedel-Crafts alkylation (tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3)
- Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4)
- Reduction of nitro to amino (Fe/HCl)
- Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl)
- Replacement of diazonium with ethoxy (NaOH/EtBr)
- Final nitration to introduce the nitro group at the correct position if needed.

Looking at the choices:
Choice 1: Has the sequence tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3, then nitration, then Fe/HCl, then nitration again, then diazotization, hydrolysis, NaOH/EtBr. This fits the logic: first tert-butyl, then nitro, then reduce nitro to amino, then diazotize and substitute with ethoxy, then nitration again to get the nitro group at the right position.
Choice 2: Has tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3, nitration, sulfonation (SO3/H2SO4), diazotization, hydrolysis, NaOH/EtBr, Fe/HCl, nitration. The order seems less logical.
Choice 3: tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3, sulfonation, nitration, Fe/HCl, diazotization, nitration, hydrolysis, NaOH/EtBr. Sulfonation before nitration is less common here.
Choice 4: nitration first, then Fe/HCl, then tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3, then nitration, diazotization, sulfonation, hydrolysis, NaOH/EtBr. Friedel-Crafts alkylation after nitration is difficult due to deactivation of ring by nitro group.

Hence, Choice 1 is the most logical sequence for high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene.

Answer: A)

### thinking by Debate Agent 2Eed:
We want to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene. Let&#39;s analyze the target molecule and the synthetic route. The target has a tert-butyl group at position 2, an ethoxy group at position 1 (which means an ethyl ether substituent), and a nitro group at position 3. Starting from benzene, the sequence should introduce these groups in a way that the directing effects of substituents favor the correct substitution pattern and avoid rearrangements or side reactions.

Step 1: Introduce tert-butyl group via Friedel-Crafts alkylation (tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3). This is an ortho/para director and activating.

Step 2: Introduce nitro group via nitration (HNO3/H2SO4). Nitro group is meta-directing and deactivating.

Step 3: Introduce ethoxy group. Since ethoxy is an ether, it can be introduced by nucleophilic aromatic substitution or by first introducing a suitable leaving group and then substituting with ethoxide.

However, direct alkylation with ethyl bromide and NaOH (to form ethoxy) is possible if we have a phenol intermediate. So, we might need to convert a nitro group to an amine (Fe/HCl reduction), then diazotize (NaNO2/HCl), then hydrolyze to phenol (H3O+, heat), then alkylate phenol with NaOH/EtBr to get ethoxy.

Also, the sulfonation step (SO3/H2SO4) is often used as a blocking group or to direct substitution.

Analyzing the choices:
- Choice 1: tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3; nitration; reduction; nitration again; diazotization; hydrolysis; alkylation; sulfonation; dilute acid. Seems complicated and has nitration twice.
- Choice 2: tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3; nitration; sulfonation; diazotization; dilute acid; hydrolysis; alkylation; reduction; nitration. Nitration last seems off.
- Choice 3: tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3; sulfonation; nitration; reduction; diazotization; nitration; hydrolysis; dilute acid; alkylation. Nitration twice again.
- Choice 4: nitration first; reduction; tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3; nitration; diazotization; sulfonation; dilute acid; hydrolysis; alkylation. Starting with nitration on benzene, then reduction to amine, then tert-butylation, then nitration again.

The best sequence is to first install the tert-butyl group (activating, ortho/para director), then nitrate (which will go meta to tert-butyl, i.e., position 3). Then reduce the nitro to amine, then diazotize and hydrolyze to phenol, then alkylate to ethoxy. Sulfonation can be used to block positions if needed.

Choice 3 matches this logic best: tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3; sulfonation (blocking); nitration; reduction; diazotization; nitration; hydrolysis; dilute acid; alkylation.

Therefore, Choice 3 is the most plausible high-yield synthetic route.
