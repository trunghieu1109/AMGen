Question: Example(question='An electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Find the expectation value of its spin along y-direction, S_y.\nNote: \\sigma_y (in latex format) is: \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & -i \\\\\ni & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}', choice1='-25*hbar/2\n\n', choice2='-12*hbar/25\n\n', choice3='12*hbar/25', choice4='25*hbar/2\n', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: The expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, is calculated using the formula <S_y> = <ψ|σ_y|ψ>, where ψ is the spin state and σ_y is the Pauli matrix for the y-direction. The given spin state is (3i, 4), and the σ_y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. First, normalize the spin state: the norm is sqrt((3i)^2 + 4^2) = sqrt(-9 + 16) = sqrt(25) = 5. The normalized state is (3i/5, 4/5). The conjugate transpose of this state is (-3i/5, 4/5). Calculate σ_y * ψ: [[0, -i], [i, 0]] * (3i/5, 4/5) = (-4i/5, 3/5). The inner product is (-3i/5, 4/5) * (-4i/5, 3/5) = (12/25) + (12i/25). The imaginary part does not contribute to the expectation value, so the real part is 12/25. Therefore, the expectation value of S_y is 12*hbar/25. This matches choice C).
