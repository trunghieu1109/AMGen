Question: Example(question='An electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Find the expectation value of its spin along y-direction, S_y.\nNote: \\sigma_y (in latex format) is: \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & -i \\\\\ni & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}', choice1='-25*hbar/2\n\n', choice2='-12*hbar/25\n\n', choice3='12*hbar/25', choice4='25*hbar/2\n', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The spin state is given as (3i, 4). We normalize it first: norm = sqrt(|3i|^2 + |4|^2) = sqrt(9 + 16) = 5. Normalized state is (3i/5, 4/5). The spin operator along y is S_y = (hbar/2) * sigma_y, where sigma_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Calculate sigma_y|psi>: sigma_y * (3i/5, 4/5)^T = (-4i/5, -3/5)^T. Then <psi|sigma_y|psi> = (-3i/5, 4/5) * (-4i/5, -3/5)^T = (-3i/5)*(-4i/5) + (4/5)*(-3/5) = (12 i^2)/25 - 12/25 = -12/25 - 12/25 = -24/25. Multiply by hbar/2 to get expectation value: <S_y> = (hbar/2)*(-24/25) = -12*hbar/25. This matches choice B).
