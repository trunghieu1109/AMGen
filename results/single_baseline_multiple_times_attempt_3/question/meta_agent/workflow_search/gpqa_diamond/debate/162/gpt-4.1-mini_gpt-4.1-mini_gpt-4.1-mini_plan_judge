Question: Example(question='We would like to dissolve (at 25°С) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm3 total volume. What is the minimum volume (cm3) of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution and what is the pH of the resulting solution?', choice1='pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3', choice2='pH 2.69; 30.09 cm3', choice3='pH 3.16; 32.14 cm3', choice4='pH 4.94; 20.40 cm3', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The problem requires dissolving 0.1 g of Fe(OH)3 in a total volume of 100 cm3 using a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid. First, calculate moles of Fe(OH)3: molar mass = 55.85 + 3*(16+1) = 106.85 g/mol, so moles = 0.1 / 106.85 ≈ 0.000936 mol. Fe(OH)3 reacts with H+ as Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe3+ + 3H2O, so moles of H+ needed = 3 * 0.000936 = 0.002808 mol. Volume of 0.1 M acid needed = 0.002808 / 0.1 = 0.02808 L = 28.08 cm3. Among the options, 28.05 cm3 matches closely. The pH after dissolution is influenced by Fe3+ hydrolysis, making the solution acidic. The pH given for 28.05 cm3 is 2.04, which is consistent with expectations. Therefore, the correct choice is A).
