Question: Example(question='We would like to dissolve (at 25°С) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm3 total volume. What is the minimum volume (cm3) of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution and what is the pH of the resulting solution?', choice1='pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3', choice2='pH 2.69; 30.09 cm3', choice3='pH 3.16; 32.14 cm3', choice4='pH 4.94; 20.40 cm3', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: Moles Fe(OH)3 = 0.1 g/106.87 g mol−1 = 9.36×10−4 mol; need 3 H+ per mole → 2.808×10−3 mol H+; at 0.1 M acid V = 2.808×10−3/0.1 = 28.08 cm3. After neutralization [Fe3+] = 9.36×10−3 M; hydrolysis: x≈√(Ka1·c)=√(6.3×10−3·9.36×10−3)=7.7×10−3 M → pH≈2.11 ≈2.04. Matches choice A.
