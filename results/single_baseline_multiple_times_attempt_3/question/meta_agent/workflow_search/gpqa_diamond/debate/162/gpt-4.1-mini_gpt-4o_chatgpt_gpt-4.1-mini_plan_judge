Question: Example(question='We would like to dissolve (at 25°С) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm3 total volume. What is the minimum volume (cm3) of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution and what is the pH of the resulting solution?', choice1='pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3', choice2='pH 2.69; 30.09 cm3', choice3='pH 3.16; 32.14 cm3', choice4='pH 4.94; 20.40 cm3', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To dissolve Fe(OH)3, we need to consider the solubility product (Ksp) and the reaction with a strong acid. The dissolution reaction is Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ -> Fe3+ + 3H2O. The moles of Fe(OH)3 are calculated as 0.1 g / 106.87 g/mol = 9.36 x 10^-4 mol. This requires 3 times the moles of H+, so 2.81 x 10^-3 mol H+ is needed. Using a 0.1 M acid, the volume required is 28.1 cm3. The pH calculation involves the concentration of H+ in the final solution, which is approximately 0.0281 M, leading to a pH of around 2.04. The closest choice that matches this calculation is choice 1: pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3.
