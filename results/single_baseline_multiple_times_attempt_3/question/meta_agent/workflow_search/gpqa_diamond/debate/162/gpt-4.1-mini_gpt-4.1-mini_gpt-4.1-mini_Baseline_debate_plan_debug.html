    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;We would like to dissolve (at 25°С) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm3 total volume. What is the minimum volume (cm3) of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution and what is the pH of the resulting solution?&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;pH 2.69; 30.09 cm3&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;pH 3.16; 32.14 cm3&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;pH 4.94; 20.40 cm3&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent clEh:
First, calculate the moles of Fe(OH)3 to be dissolved: Molar mass of Fe(OH)3 = 55.85 (Fe) + 3*(16 + 1) = 55.85 + 3*17 = 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol. Moles of Fe(OH)3 = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 mol. Fe(OH)3 is a base and will react with H+ from the acid: Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe3+ + 3H2O. So, 3 moles of H+ per mole of Fe(OH)3 are needed. Total moles of H+ required = 3 * 0.000936 = 0.002808 mol. The acid concentration is 0.1 M, so volume needed = moles / concentration = 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 L = 28.08 cm3. Among the choices, 28.05 cm3 corresponds closely. Now, the total volume is 100 cm3, so after adding 28.05 cm3 of acid, the total volume is 100 cm3 (as per the problem statement, the final volume is 100 cm3 total, so acid is added and volume adjusted). The pH will be determined by the excess H+ after neutralization. Since all H+ is consumed by Fe(OH)3, the solution is neutral or slightly acidic due to hydrolysis of Fe3+. The given pH for 28.05 cm3 is 2.04, which is consistent with the acidic solution due to Fe3+ hydrolysis. Therefore, the correct answer is choice 1: pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3.

First, calculate the moles of Fe(OH)3 to dissolve: Molar mass Fe(OH)3 ≈ 55.85 (Fe) + 3*(16 + 1) = 55.85 + 3*17 = 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol. Moles Fe(OH)3 = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 mol. Fe(OH)3 dissolves in acid by neutralizing hydroxide ions: Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe3+ + 3H2O, so 3 moles of H+ per mole of Fe(OH)3 are needed. Total moles H+ needed = 3 * 0.000936 = 0.002808 mol. Using 0.1 M monobasic acid, volume needed = moles / concentration = 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 L = 28.08 cm3. Total volume is 100 cm3, so after adding acid, the solution volume is 100 cm3. Now, calculate the pH. After neutralization, excess H+ determines pH. Since acid is just enough to dissolve Fe(OH)3, the pH will be acidic but close to the neutralization point. The closest choice with volume near 28.08 cm3 and pH around 2 is choice1: pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3.

First, calculate moles of Fe(OH)3: Molar mass Fe(OH)3 = 55.85 + 3*(16 + 1) = 55.85 + 3*17 = 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol. Moles Fe(OH)3 = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 mol. Fe(OH)3 dissolves in acid by neutralizing OH- groups: Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe3+ + 3H2O. So, moles of H+ needed = 3 * moles of Fe(OH)3 = 3 * 0.000936 = 0.002808 mol. Using 0.1 M acid: volume needed = moles / concentration = 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 L = 28.08 cm3. Total volume is 100 cm3, so after adding acid and Fe(OH)3, volume is 100 cm3. The H+ concentration after neutralization is from the excess acid. Since acid is just enough to dissolve Fe(OH)3, pH is determined by the H+ concentration: pH = -log[H+]. Because acid is monobasic strong acid and used exactly to neutralize Fe(OH)3, the pH will be close to the pH of the solution with 0.02808 L of 0.1 M acid diluted to 100 cm3. Moles of acid added = 0.1 * 0.02808 = 0.002808 mol. Moles of H+ consumed = 0.002808 mol (to neutralize Fe(OH)3). So, no excess H+ remains, pH should be neutral or slightly acidic due to Fe3+ hydrolysis. However, Fe3+ hydrolyzes to produce H+, making solution acidic. Approximate pH can be estimated from hydrolysis of Fe3+. But given options, the closest volume is 28.05 cm3 with pH 2.04. Therefore, answer is choice1.

First, calculate the moles of Fe(OH)3 to be dissolved. Molar mass of Fe(OH)3 = 55.85 (Fe) + 3*(16+1) = 55.85 + 3*17 = 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol. Moles of Fe(OH)3 = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 mol. To dissolve Fe(OH)3, the hydroxide ions must be neutralized by H+ from the acid. Each Fe(OH)3 has 3 OH- groups, so moles of H+ needed = 3 * 0.000936 = 0.002808 mol. Using 0.1 M acid, volume needed = moles / concentration = 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 L = 28.08 cm3. The total volume is 100 cm3 after dissolution. The excess H+ concentration is (moles H+ added - moles OH- neutralized) / total volume. Since all OH- are neutralized, the solution contains 0.002808 mol H+ in 0.1 L, so [H+] = 0.002808 mol / 0.1 L = 0.02808 M. pH = -log(0.02808) ≈ 1.55, but since this is a strong acid and some hydrolysis may occur, the pH would be slightly higher. Among the choices, the closest volume is 28.05 cm3 and pH 2.04 which is reasonable given approximations.

    <pre>The problem requires dissolving 0.1 g of Fe(OH)3 in a total volume of 100 cm3 using a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid. First, calculate moles of Fe(OH)3: molar mass = 55.85 + 3*(16+1) = 106.85 g/mol, so moles = 0.1 / 106.85 ≈ 0.000936 mol. Fe(OH)3 reacts with H+ as Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe3+ + 3H2O, so moles of H+ needed = 3 * 0.000936 = 0.002808 mol. Volume of 0.1 M acid needed = 0.002808 / 0.1 = 0.02808 L = 28.08 cm3. Among the options, 28.05 cm3 matches closely. The pH after dissolution is influenced by Fe3+ hydrolysis, making the solution acidic. The pH given for 28.05 cm3 is 2.04, which is consistent with expectations. Therefore, the correct choice is A).
