Question: Example(question='You are studying a nuclear decay which converts two heavy nucleons of flavor A to another flavor B, while simultaneously emitting two much lighter particles E and V. In short, 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V. It is known that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous, with some endpoint value Q.\n\nA variant of this decay emits one exotic, massless particle M instead of the 2V. In this case, how does the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles compare to that of the original decay?', choice1='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint increases.', choice2='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases.', choice3='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.', choice4='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint decreases.', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The original decay emits two lighter particles V along with two E particles, resulting in a continuous energy spectrum for the E particles due to the variable energy sharing among multiple emitted particles. When the variant decay replaces the two V particles with one massless particle M, the number of emitted particles decreases, but since M is massless and can carry variable energy, the energy spectrum of the E particles remains continuous. Additionally, because the massless M particle reduces the total mass of the emitted system, more energy is available to the E particles, increasing the endpoint of their energy spectrum. Therefore, the spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.
