    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;You are studying a nuclear decay which converts two heavy nucleons of flavor A to another flavor B, while simultaneously emitting two much lighter particles E and V. In short, 2A -&gt; 2B + 2E + 2V. It is known that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous, with some endpoint value Q.\n\nA variant of this decay emits one exotic, massless particle M instead of the 2V. In this case, how does the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles compare to that of the original decay?&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint increases.&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases.&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint decreases.&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent 9Uxz:
The original 2νββ decay (2A→2B+2e⁻+2ν) gives a continuous sum‐electron spectrum up to an endpoint Q. Replacing the two (massive) neutrinos by a single massless particle M forces the two electrons to carry away a fixed total energy (modulo negligible nuclear recoil), yielding a monoenergetic line. Moreover, since M is strictly massless, the maximum available energy to the electrons increases slightly (by the ν masses) compared to the 2ν case. Hence the spectrum becomes discrete and the endpoint increases.

### thinking by Debate Agent qGTQ:
This is the well‐known result from double‐beta decay with emission of a single massless exotic (Majoron) rather than two neutrinos: the summed electron spectrum remains continuous (it’s a 3‐body final state) but its shape (spectral index) is altered. The kinematic endpoint, however, is essentially unchanged from Q, so none of the discrete‐spectrum options apply—nearest is “continuous with adjusted shape and reduced endpoint” if forced. Here the best match is choice B.

### thinking by Debate Agent Cc5z:
The decay 2A→2B+2e+2ν is a four‐body final state giving a continuous summed‐electron spectrum up to the Q‐value. Replacing the two (nearly massless) neutrinos by a single massless majoron M yields a three‐body final state 2A→2B+2e+M, which likewise gives a continuous summed‐electron spectrum. The spectral shape is altered (different phase‐space factors) but since M is massless the maximum electron energy sum still reaches Q (in fact if one accounts for small neutrino masses it even slightly increases relative to the 2ν case). No discrete lines appear. 

### thinking by Debate Agent yai1:
Original double-beta with two neutrinos (2E+2V) gives a continuous electron sum-energy spectrum up to Q. Replacing the two neutrinos by a single exotic massless particle leaves one undetected particle, so the sum electron energy remains a continuous distribution. Since the exotic is massless, it can carry zero energy, pushing the maximum electron energy up to the full Q, slightly above the previous neutrino‐limited endpoint. Thus the spectrum stays continuous with a shifted shape and a higher endpoint.

    <pre>The original 2νββ decay (2A→2B+2e+2ν) has a four-body final state leading to a continuous summed-electron spectrum up to Q. Replacing the two (nearly massless) neutrinos with a single massless exotic M yields a three-body final state (2A→2B+2e+M), which still gives a continuous summed-electron energy spectrum. The phase-space factors change the spectral shape, and because M is massless the maximum electron energy sum can reach Q (or even slightly above if one accounts for tiny neutrino masses), so the endpoint increases relative to the 2ν case. Hence choice C applies.
