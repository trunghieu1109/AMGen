Question: Example(question='You are studying a nuclear decay which converts two heavy nucleons of flavor A to another flavor B, while simultaneously emitting two much lighter particles E and V. In short, 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V. It is known that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous, with some endpoint value Q.\n\nA variant of this decay emits one exotic, massless particle M instead of the 2V. In this case, how does the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles compare to that of the original decay?', choice1='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint increases.', choice2='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases.', choice3='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.', choice4='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint decreases.', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The original decay process involves two heavy nucleons converting into two of another flavor, along with emitting two lighter particles E and V. The continuous energy spectrum of E particles suggests that the energy is shared between E and V, with V being a neutrino-like particle. In the variant decay, instead of two neutrino-like particles V, one massless particle M is emitted. This changes the energy distribution since M is massless and carries away some energy. The energy not carried by M must be shared between the E particles, affecting the shape of their energy spectrum. Since M is massless, it can carry away more energy than two massive particles V, leading to an increase in the endpoint energy of the E spectrum. Thus, the spectrum remains continuous but with a higher endpoint energy.
