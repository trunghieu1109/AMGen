Question: Example(question='You are studying a nuclear decay which converts two heavy nucleons of flavor A to another flavor B, while simultaneously emitting two much lighter particles E and V. In short, 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V. It is known that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous, with some endpoint value Q.\n\nA variant of this decay emits one exotic, massless particle M instead of the 2V. In this case, how does the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles compare to that of the original decay?', choice1='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint increases.', choice2='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases.', choice3='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.', choice4='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint decreases.', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The original 2νββ decay (2A→2B+2e+2ν) has a four-body final state leading to a continuous summed-electron spectrum up to Q. Replacing the two (nearly massless) neutrinos with a single massless exotic M yields a three-body final state (2A→2B+2e+M), which still gives a continuous summed-electron energy spectrum. The phase-space factors change the spectral shape, and because M is massless the maximum electron energy sum can reach Q (or even slightly above if one accounts for tiny neutrino masses), so the endpoint increases relative to the 2ν case. Hence choice C applies.
