Question: Example(question='In an inactive state, a transcription factor subunit awaits an activation signal from the membrane phosphorylation cascade. Upon phosphorylation on the Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, shuttles into the nucleus, and serves in gene transcription. A missense mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. You observe that a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Which of the following molecular phenotypes is most likely observed in the presence of mutation Y?', choice1='loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype', choice2='protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype', choice3='protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele', choice4='change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: All agents agree that mutation Y is a dominant-negative mutation in the dimerization domain, which likely interferes with the normal function of the wild-type protein. Dominant-negative mutations often result in a loss-of-function phenotype by forming non-functional complexes or aggregates with the wild-type protein. Since the mutation is in the dimerization domain, it is reasonable to conclude that the mutant protein may aggregate with the wild-type protein, preventing proper dimerization and function, leading to a loss-of-function phenotype. Therefore, the most likely molecular phenotype is protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype.
