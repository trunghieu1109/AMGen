Question: Example(question='In an inactive state, a transcription factor subunit awaits an activation signal from the membrane phosphorylation cascade. Upon phosphorylation on the Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, shuttles into the nucleus, and serves in gene transcription. A missense mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. You observe that a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Which of the following molecular phenotypes is most likely observed in the presence of mutation Y?', choice1='loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype', choice2='protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype', choice3='protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele', choice4='change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The transcription factor functions as a dimer, and mutation Y is a dominant-negative mutation in the dimerization domain. Dominant-negative mutations typically interfere with the function of the wild-type protein by forming nonfunctional dimers or complexes, often leading to protein aggregation and a loss-of-function phenotype. This effect occurs even in the presence of one wild-type allele, explaining the dominant-negative nature. Other options such as loss of protein dimerization with a wild-type phenotype or gain-of-function phenotypes are inconsistent with the dominant-negative loss-of-function mutation described. Protein degradation of the wild-type allele is less typical for dominant-negative mutations. Therefore, the most likely molecular phenotype observed is protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype.
