    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;In an inactive state, a transcription factor subunit awaits an activation signal from the membrane phosphorylation cascade. Upon phosphorylation on the Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, shuttles into the nucleus, and serves in gene transcription. A missense mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. You observe that a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Which of the following molecular phenotypes is most likely observed in the presence of mutation Y?&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent gCuk:
A dominant-negative mutation in the dimerization domain would allow the mutant protein to still dimerize (or aggregate) with the wild-type subunit, but the resulting complexes are nonfunctional, leading to a loss-of-function phenotype even in heterozygotes. This fits protein aggregation (or nonfunctional dimer formation) and loss of function.

### thinking by Debate Agent A3AB:
A dominant-negative mutation in the dimerization domain produces mutant protein that still binds the wild-type subunit but inactivates the complex, often by forming nonfunctional or aggregated multimers. This inactivates both the mutant and the wild-type copies, yielding a loss-of-function phenotype even in heterozygotes.

### thinking by Debate Agent RGi4:
A dominant-negative mutation in the dimerization domain would allow mutant and wild-type subunits to interact, forming nonfunctional aggregates/complexes that sequester the wild-type protein and abolish its activity. This results in a loss-of-function phenotype despite the presence of one normal allele.

### thinking by Debate Agent BWyY:
A dominant-negative mutation in a dimerization domain typically allows the mutant subunit to bind the wild-type and form nonfunctional complexes, effectively ‘aggregating’ them into inactive forms and causing loss of function overall, even though one wild-type allele is present.

### answer by Debate Agent gCuk:
