Question: Example(question='Compound X, which has the following IR and NMR data, reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Identify the final product.\nIR: 3400â€“2500 cm-1, 1720 cm-1, 1610 cm-1, 1450 cm-1\n1H NMR: 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H), 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H), 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).', choice1='1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene', choice2='4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid', choice3='2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid', choice4='1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The IR spectrum indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid group (broad 3400-2500 cm-1 and strong 1720 cm-1 peaks) and aromatic rings (1610 and 1450 cm-1). The 1H NMR shows a carboxylic acid proton at 10.5 ppm, aromatic protons as two doublets at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm (para-substituted benzene), and aliphatic signals consistent with a sec-butyl group. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI reduces the carboxylic acid to a methyl group, converting 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid to 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. Therefore, the final product is the alkylbenzene, 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which corresponds to choice A).
