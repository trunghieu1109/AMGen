Question: Example(question='Compound X, which has the following IR and NMR data, reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Identify the final product.\nIR: 3400–2500 cm-1, 1720 cm-1, 1610 cm-1, 1450 cm-1\n1H NMR: 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H), 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H), 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).', choice1='1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene', choice2='4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid', choice3='2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid', choice4='1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The IR shows a broad 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ band and a 1720 cm⁻¹ peak, indicating a carboxylic acid. The ¹H NMR has a 10.5 ppm broad singlet (COOH) and two doublets at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm (para-disubstituted benzene). The aliphatic multiplets and doublet/triplet pattern (2.9 m, 1.7 m, 1.4 d, 0.9 t) match a sec-butyl group. Thus the starting compound is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Treatment with red phosphorus and HI reduces the carboxyl group to a methyl, giving para-sec-butyl toluene (1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene).
