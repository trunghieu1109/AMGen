proposed answer: The Schrödinger cat state with phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5 has a normalization constant N = sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi)*exp(-2*alpha^2)) = sqrt(1 - exp(-0.5)) ≈ 0.6275. The relative entropy measure of non-Gaussianity del_b = Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau), where tau is the Gaussian reference state with the same first and second moments as rho. Since rho is pure, Tr(rho ln rho) = 0, so del_b = -Tr(tau ln tau) > 0. Literature and numerical results for such parameters indicate that the non-Gaussianity measure is small but nonzero, approximately 0.25. The options 2.48 and 1.38 are too large, and 0 would imply a Gaussian state, which is not the case here. Therefore, the best choice is 0.25.
