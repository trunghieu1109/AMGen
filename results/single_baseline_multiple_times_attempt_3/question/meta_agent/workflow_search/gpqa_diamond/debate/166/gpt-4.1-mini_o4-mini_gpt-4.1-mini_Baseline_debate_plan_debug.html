### thinking by Debate Agent Dt0q:
For phi = -π/4 the state is the odd cat with α² = 0.25. The relative‐entropy nG reduces to the entropy S(τ) of the Gaussian reference (since ρ is pure). The equivalent thermal photon number n = ⟨n⟩ ≈ 0.25·tanh(0.25) ≈ 0.0612. Then S(τ) = (n+1)ln(n+1) – n ln n ≈ (1.0612)·0.0594 – 0.0612·(–2.792) ≈ 0.0630 + 0.1708 = 0.2338 nats, close to 0.25.

### thinking by Debate Agent LRYW:
We have the odd Schrödinger cat state (φ=−π/4 gives |ψ&gt;∝|α&gt;−|−α&gt;) with α=0.5. The non‐Gaussianity measure via relative entropy simplifies for pure ρ to Δ_b=S(τ), the von Neumann entropy of the Gaussian reference state τ with the same second moments. For the odd cat: &lt;a&gt;=0 and &lt;n&gt;=α^2(1+e^{−2α^2})/(1−e^{−2α^2}) ≃0.25*(1+0.6065)/(1−0.6065)≃1.0216. Thus τ is a thermal state of mean n_th≈1.0216, whose entropy is S=(n_th+1)ln(n_th+1)−n_th ln n_th ≃(2.0216)ln2.0216−1.0216ln1.0216≃1.40. This matches choice C)≈1.38.

### thinking by Debate Agent xdcT:
We have Schrödinger cat state |ψ&gt; = (cosφ|α&gt;+sinφ|−α&gt;)/N with φ=−π/4, α=0.5. Then sin2φ=−1 so N=√(1−e^(−2α^2))≈√(1−e^(−0.5))≈√0.3935≈0.6273. This is a superposition of coherent states, hence non-Gaussian. The relative entropy of non-Gaussianity for small α (0.5) is typically small. Of the choices (2.48, 0, 1.38, 0.25), zero would imply Gaussian (wrong), and the larger values are too big for α=0.5. Hence the non-Gaussianity ≈0.25.

### thinking by Debate Agent 7vBS:
For φ=−π/4 and α=0.5, the cat state becomes an odd superposition with small amplitude. The relative entropy non‐Gaussianity is small in this regime, around 0.25.

    <pre>The odd cat state (φ=−π/4) at small amplitude α=0.5 has only a modest non‐Gaussianity. Approximate evaluations of the relative‐entropy measure give a value around 0.25, matching choice D.
