Here cos30° ≈ 0.8660, so (1 + 2·0.8660)/3 ≈ 0.9107 and sqrt ≈ 0.9543. Thus d ≈ 10·0.9543 = 9.543 Å, matching choice A).\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent ABDn:\nWe have a rhombohedral lattice with a = 10 Å and α = β = γ = 30°. The reciprocal metric tensor for a rhombohedral cell (all edges a, all angles α) leads to the formula: 1/d_{hkl}^2 = (1/a^2)[(h^2+k^2+l^2−(h+k+l)^2/3)/(1−cosα) + ((h+k+l)^2/3)/(1+2cosα)]. For the (111) plane, h+k+l=3 and h^2+k^2+l^2=3, so the first term vanishes and we get 1/d^2 = (1/a^2)[3/(1+2cosα)]. With cos30°=√3/2≈0.8660, 1+2cosα≈2.732, so d = a*√((1+2cosα)/3) ≈10*0.9543 ≈9.54 Å.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent yOyK:\nWe have a rhombohedral lattice with a = 10 Å and α = 30°. We set direct lattice vectors:\n a1=(a,0,0), a2=(a cosα, a sinα,0), a3=(a cosα, a(cosα–cos²α)/sinα, a √(1+2cos³α–3cos²α)/sinα).\nCompute cosα=0.8660, sinα=0.5, so the triple‐product V=a³√(1–3cos²α+2cos³α)=1000·0.2215=221.5 Å³.  From the cross‐products we get reciprocal b1,b2,b3 and then G=h b1+ k b2+ l b3 for (111):\n G≈(0.628,0.167,0.1004) Å⁻¹, |G|≈0.6577 Å⁻¹, so d=2π/|G|≈6.283/0.6577≈9.55 Å, which matches 9.54 Å.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent Z92x:\nTo find the spacing of the (111) plane in a rhombohedral lattice, it is simplest to switch to the equivalent hexagonal description. In the hexagonal setting of a rhombohedral cell, the (111)rhom plane becomes the (003)hex plane. The hexagonal c–parameter is related to the rhombohedral edge a and angle α by\n  c_hex = a_rhom · √[3·(1 + 2\u2009cos\u2009α)]\nWith a_rhom = 10\u2009Å and α = 30°, cos\u2009α = √3/2 ≈ 0.8660, so\n  c_hex = 10\u2009Å · √[3·(1 + 2·0.8660)] = 10\u2009Å · √(8.196) ≈ 28.635\u2009Å.\nThe (003)hex plane spacing is simply c_hex/3, giving\n  d_003 = 28.635\u2009Å / 3 ≈ 9.545\u2009Å ≈ 9.54\u2009Å,\nwhich corresponds to choice A).\n\n### answer by Debate Agent ezO7:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent ABDn:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent yOyK:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent Z92x:\nA)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
