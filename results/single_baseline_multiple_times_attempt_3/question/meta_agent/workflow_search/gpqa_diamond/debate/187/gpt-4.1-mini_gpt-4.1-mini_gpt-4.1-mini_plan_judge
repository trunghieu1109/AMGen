Question: Example(question='Consider a rhombohedral crystal, with the interatomic distance of 10 Angstrom and the angles $\\quad\\alpha=\\beta=\\gamma=30^{0}$. What is the interplanar distance of the (111) plane of the crystal?\n', choice1='9.54 Angstrom', choice2='8.95 Angstrom', choice3='9.08 Angstrom', choice4='10.05 Angstrom', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The problem involves calculating the interplanar spacing d for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal with lattice parameter a = 10 Å and angles α = β = γ = 30°. Multiple formulas for rhombohedral interplanar spacing were considered, but many yielded values inconsistent with the given options. The formula d_hkl = a * sqrt(1 - 3cos^2α + 2cos^3α) / sqrt(h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + kl + lh)cosα) gives a very small value (~0.77 Å), which is not close to any options. Other attempts to calculate 1/d^2 also resulted in values too small or too large compared to the options. Considering the unusual small angle and the large lattice parameter, and the fact that the interplanar spacing should be close to the lattice parameter or slightly less, the closest option to the lattice parameter 10 Å is 9.54 Å (choice A). Therefore, the best choice given the options and the calculations is A).
