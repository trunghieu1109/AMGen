    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;α-β unsaturated carbonyls have a much more electrophilic carbon double bond. These double bonds act as a good Lewis acid and react with nucleophiles to produce enolate ions. In this case, when a nucleophile attacks the β position, it produces a resonance-stabilized intermediate. When a nucleophile attacking the β-carbon is enolate, such reaction is known as the Michael reaction.\nWhat are the reactants and major final products of the following Michael addition reactions?\ndimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --&gt;(A)\n1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H3O+) --&gt; (B)\nC + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H2O) ---&gt; 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent VApC:
We need to identify the products of three Michael additions. Step 3 uses cyclohexane-1,3-dione (active methylene between two C=O’s) adding to methyl vinyl ketone to give 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione, so C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione. Step 1: dimethyl malonate adds to methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, yielding a triester with the aryl on the central carbon: trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. Step 2: the enamine from cyclohexanone and piperidine adds to crotononitrile, upon hydrolysis giving 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile. These correspond to choice 4 (D).

### thinking by Debate Agent 6iCN:
First reaction: dimethyl malonate enolate adds to methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate at the β-carbon to give a malonate adduct bearing three ester groups and a p-tolyl at C2. That is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. Second: the cyclohexanone enamine adds to (E)-but-2-enenitrile, then hydrolysis gives an α-cyano ketone: 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile. Third: cyclohexane-1,3-dione enolate adds to methyl vinyl ketone (but-3-en-2-one) to give 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. Thus A and B match choice 4, and C must be cyclohexane-1,3-dione as in choice 4.

### thinking by Debate Agent DmaR:
We have three independent Michael additions: 
Reaction A uses a malonate enolate + methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate → the malonate α-carbon attacks the β-carbon of the ester and the original ester group remains on what becomes the middle carbon. The product is a propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate with two malonate esters at C1, one ester at C2, and the p-tolyl on C3: trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate.
Reaction B uses a cyclohexanone enamine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile; after acid work-up the enamine hydrolyzes to the enolic form of the nitrile adduct: 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile.
Reaction C uses the enolic 1,3-cyclohexanedione (2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione) as nucleophile with methyl vinyl ketone under base to give 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione, so the reactant C is 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione.  These match choice3.

### thinking by Debate Agent MasV:
First, consider A: dimethyl malonate enolate adds to methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate at the β-carbon giving a trimethyl propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate framework with p-tolyl on C-3. This matches trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate.

Second, for B: the cyclohexanone enamine of 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine adds to crotonitrile then hydrolyzes to give the ketone, i.e. 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.

Third, for C: the nucleophile is cyclohexane-1,3-dione which in base adds to methyl vinyl ketone to yield 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Matching these to the choices, only choice D (4) gives B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile and C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione, so the correct answer is D).

    <pre>We analyze three Michael additions:
Reaction A: dimethyl malonate enolate attacks methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate to give a trimethyl propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate with the p-tolyl at C-2: trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.
Reaction B: the enamine from cyclohexanone and piperidine adds to (E)-but-2-enenitrile; acid workup yields the ketonitrile 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.
Reaction C: cyclohexane-1,3-dione enolate adds to methyl vinyl ketone giving 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione, so the starting enolate donor is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.
Matching the products and reactants to the choices, only choice 4 (D) matches all: A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione.
