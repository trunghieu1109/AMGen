Question: Example(question='Consider an aperture, which shapes like a N-sided polygon. All the apothems are of the same length a. When a monochromatic light (of wavelength \\lambda), travelling along z-axis, falls vertically on this aperture, it creates a series of intensity maxima and minima in the far field region. What is the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large ? Assume that the related angles are small so that tan theta = theta approximation can be taken.', choice1='1.220 \\lambda /a ', choice2='0.610 \\lambda / a', choice3='0.500 \\lambda / a', choice4='0.506 \\lambda / a', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: As N approaches infinity, the polygonal aperture becomes a circular aperture with radius equal to the apothem a. The diffraction pattern of a circular aperture is described by the Airy pattern. The first minimum occurs at an angle theta_1 = 1.22 * (lambda / D), where D is the diameter of the aperture. Since D = 2a, theta_1 = 1.22 * lambda / (2a) = 0.61 * lambda / a. The second minimum occurs at approximately 2.233 * (lambda / D) = 2.233 * lambda / (2a) = 1.1165 * lambda / a. The angular distance between the first two minima is therefore (2.233 - 1.22) * (lambda / D) = 1.013 * (lambda / D) = 1.013 * lambda / (2a) = approximately 0.506 * lambda / a. Among the given options, 0.506 * lambda / a corresponds to choice D). Hence, the correct answer is D).
