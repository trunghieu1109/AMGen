Question: Example(question='Consider an aperture, which shapes like a N-sided polygon. All the apothems are of the same length a. When a monochromatic light (of wavelength \\lambda), travelling along z-axis, falls vertically on this aperture, it creates a series of intensity maxima and minima in the far field region. What is the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large ? Assume that the related angles are small so that tan theta = theta approximation can be taken.', choice1='1.220 \\lambda /a ', choice2='0.610 \\lambda / a', choice3='0.500 \\lambda / a', choice4='0.506 \\lambda / a', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: As N→∞ the aperture becomes circular with radius a. The far‐field pattern is the Airy pattern, whose intensity minima occur at k a θ＝j₁,n (zeros of J₁). Here k＝2π/λ, j₁,1≈3.8317 and j₁,2≈7.0156. Thus θ₁＝(3.8317λ)/(2πa)≈0.610λ/a and θ₂＝(7.0156λ)/(2πa)≈1.117λ/a. The angular separation Δθ＝θ₂−θ₁≈0.506λ/a.
