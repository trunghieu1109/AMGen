Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The problem involves a relativistic harmonic oscillator where the total energy at maximum amplitude A is the sum of rest energy and potential energy: E = mc^2 + (1/2)kA^2. At maximum speed v_max (at x=0), the potential energy is zero and kinetic energy is maximum, so total energy is E = gamma * mc^2, where gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2). Equating these energies gives gamma = 1 + (kA^2)/(2mc^2). Solving for v_max yields v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1 / (1 + (kA^2)/(2mc^2))^2). This matches choice 2 exactly.
