Question: Example(question=" Consider a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass $m$ and maximum amplitude $A$ obeying Hook's law ($F=-kx$). What is the maximum speed  $v_max$ of the mass? The speed of light is $c$.", choice1='$v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})}}$', choice2='$v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$', choice3='$v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2m})^2}}$', choice4='$v_{max}=\\sqrt{\\frac{kA^2}{m}}$', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: All agents agree that the maximum speed v_max of the relativistic harmonic oscillator can be derived from the conservation of energy. At maximum amplitude, the potential energy is (1/2)kA^2, and at maximum speed, this energy is converted into kinetic energy. The relativistic kinetic energy is given by the Lorentz factor, and solving for v_max involves using the expression for the Lorentz factor and the conservation of energy. The correct expression for v_max is derived as v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + kA^2/(2mc^2))^2), which corresponds to choice B.
