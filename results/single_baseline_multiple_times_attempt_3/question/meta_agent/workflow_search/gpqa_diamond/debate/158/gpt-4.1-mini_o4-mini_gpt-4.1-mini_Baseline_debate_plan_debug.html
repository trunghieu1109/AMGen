    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Observations of a quasar across the electromagnetic spectrum are being carried out. Focusing on the near infrared and optical spectrum, there is a peak at wavelength of about 790 nm, and at shorter wavelengths &lt; 790 nm the flux drops significantly.\n\nIf we lived in a universe defined by Lambda-CDM model such that the current Hubble constant is 70 km s^-1 Mpc^-1, matter density parameter is 0.3, dark energy density parameter is 0.7, and universe is flat,\nwhat can be assumed about the value of the comoving distance (for scale factor a=1) of this quasar from the Earth?&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;8 Gpc&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;9 Gpc&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;7 Gpc&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;6 Gpc&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent Kdyo:
The sharp drop shortward of 790 nm is the Lyman-α break at 121.6 nm rest; (1+z)=7900/1216≈6.5 ⇒ z≈5.5. In ΛCDM (H0=70, Ωm=0.3, ΩΛ=0.7) the comoving distance to z≈5.5 is ≃7.7–8 Gpc.

### thinking by Debate Agent fldN:
The observed cutoff at ~790 nm is due to the Lyman-α forest break at 121.6 nm redshifted: (1+z)=790/121.6≈6.5⇒z≈5.5. In a flat ΛCDM universe (H0=70, Ωm=0.3, ΩΛ=0.7), the comoving distance to z≈5.5 is roughly 8 Gpc (interpolating known values: ~7.7 Gpc at z=5, ~8.3 Gpc at z=6).

### thinking by Debate Agent kLLR:
The sharp drop at λobs≈790 nm is due to the Lyman-α break (λrest=121.6 nm), so 1+z=790/121.6≈6.5 ⇒ z≈5.5. In a flat ΛCDM (H0=70, Ωm=0.3, ΩΛ=0.7) the comoving distance is Dc=c/H0∫0z dz′/√[Ωm(1+z′)^3+ΩΛ]. Numerically ∫0^5.5 dz′/E(z′)≈1.87, and c/H0≈4286 Mpc, so Dc≈4286×1.87≈8000 Mpc≈8 Gpc.

### thinking by Debate Agent Fr2v:
The observed drop at 790 nm is due to Lyman-α at 121.6 nm ⇒ z ≃ 790/121.6 – 1 ≃ 5.5. In ΛCDM with H₀=70, Ωₘ=0.3, ΩΛ=0.7, the comoving distance D_C = (c/H₀)∫₀ᶻ dz&#39;/√(Ωₘ(1+z&#39;)³+ΩΛ). Numerically ∫₀⁵.⁵ dz/E(z) ≃ 2.0, so D_C ≃ 4286 Mpc×2 ≃ 8570 Mpc ≃ 8.6 Gpc, i.e. roughly 9 Gpc.
