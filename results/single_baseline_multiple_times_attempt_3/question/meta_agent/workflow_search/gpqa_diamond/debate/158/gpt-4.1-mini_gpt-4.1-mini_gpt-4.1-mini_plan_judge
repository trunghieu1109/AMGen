Question: Example(question='Observations of a quasar across the electromagnetic spectrum are being carried out. Focusing on the near infrared and optical spectrum, there is a peak at wavelength of about 790 nm, and at shorter wavelengths < 790 nm the flux drops significantly.\n\nIf we lived in a universe defined by Lambda-CDM model such that the current Hubble constant is 70 km s^-1 Mpc^-1, matter density parameter is 0.3, dark energy density parameter is 0.7, and universe is flat,\nwhat can be assumed about the value of the comoving distance (for scale factor a=1) of this quasar from the Earth?', choice1='8 Gpc', choice2='9 Gpc', choice3='7 Gpc', choice4='6 Gpc', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The quasar's observed peak at 790 nm corresponds to the redshifted Lyman-alpha line at 121.6 nm. Calculating the redshift z = (790 / 121.6) - 1 â‰ˆ 5.5. Using the Lambda-CDM cosmological parameters (H0=70 km/s/Mpc, Omega_m=0.3, Omega_Lambda=0.7, flat universe), the comoving distance for z ~ 5.5 is approximately 8 to 9 Gpc. Among the given options, 8 Gpc is the best estimate for the comoving distance to this quasar.
