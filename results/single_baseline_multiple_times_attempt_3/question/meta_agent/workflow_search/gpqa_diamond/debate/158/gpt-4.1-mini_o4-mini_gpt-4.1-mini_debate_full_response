In ΛCDM (H0=70, Ωm=0.3, ΩΛ=0.7) the comoving distance to z≈5.5 is ≃7.7–8 Gpc.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent fldN:\nThe observed cutoff at ~790 nm is due to the Lyman-α forest break at 121.6 nm redshifted: (1+z)=790/121.6≈6.5⇒z≈5.5. In a flat ΛCDM universe (H0=70, Ωm=0.3, ΩΛ=0.7), the comoving distance to z≈5.5 is roughly 8 Gpc (interpolating known values: ~7.7 Gpc at z=5, ~8.3 Gpc at z=6).\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent kLLR:\nThe sharp drop at λobs≈790 nm is due to the Lyman-α break (λrest=121.6 nm), so 1+z=790/121.6≈6.5 ⇒ z≈5.5. In a flat ΛCDM (H0=70, Ωm=0.3, ΩΛ=0.7) the comoving distance is Dc=c/H0∫0z dz′/√[Ωm(1+z′)^3+ΩΛ]. Numerically ∫0^5.5 dz′/E(z′)≈1.87, and c/H0≈4286 Mpc, so Dc≈4286×1.87≈8000 Mpc≈8 Gpc.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent Fr2v:\nThe observed drop at 790 nm is due to Lyman-α at 121.6 nm ⇒ z ≃ 790/121.6 – 1 ≃ 5.5. In ΛCDM with H₀=70, Ωₘ=0.3, ΩΛ=0.7, the comoving distance D_C = (c/H₀)∫₀ᶻ dz'/√(Ωₘ(1+z')³+ΩΛ). Numerically ∫₀⁵.⁵ dz/E(z) ≃ 2.0, so D_C ≃ 4286 Mpc×2 ≃ 8570 Mpc ≃ 8.6 Gpc, i.e. roughly 9 Gpc.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent Kdyo:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent fldN:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent kLLR:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent Fr2v:\nB)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
