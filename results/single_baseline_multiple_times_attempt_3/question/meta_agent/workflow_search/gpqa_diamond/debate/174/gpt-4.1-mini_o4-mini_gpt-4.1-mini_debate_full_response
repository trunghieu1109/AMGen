The maximum at θ=90° is A, so at θ=30° the fraction is sin^2(30°)=1/4. Dipole radiation power varies as ω^4∝λ^(-4).\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent qrA9:\nThe radiation pattern of an oscillating dipole aligned along the z–axis is proportional to sin^2θ, with maximum at θ=90°. At θ=30°, sin^2(30°)=1/4. The dipole power scales as ω^4∝λ^(−4). Thus the fraction is 1/4 and f∝λ^(−4).\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent S6HI:\nWe have an oscillating charge distribution symmetric around the z-axis. The lowest-order radiation is electric dipole. The angular distribution of dipole radiation goes as sin^2θ. The maximum occurs at θ=90° and at θ=30° the value is sin^2(30°)=(1/2)^2=1/4 of the maximum. The frequency (or wavelength) dependence of dipole radiation power is proportional to ω^4, i.e., λ^(-4). Thus the fraction is 1/4 and the λ-dependence is λ^(-4). That corresponds to choice3, i.e. option C).\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent 9lWX:\nFor a spheroidal oscillating charge distribution, the leading radiation is dipole radiation along z. The angular distribution ∝ sin^2θ, giving maximum at θ=90°. At θ=30°, sin^2(30°)=(1/2)^2=1/4 of the maximum. The wavelength dependence for dipole radiation is ∝ω^4∝(1/λ)^4. Thus f∝λ^(−4) and the fraction is 1/4.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent FXLU:\nC)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent qrA9:\nC)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent S6HI:\nC)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 9lWX:\nC)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
