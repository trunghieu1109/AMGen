    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Consider an oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis). Because it oscillates, it would radiate at a wavelength \\lambda. In the radiation zone, the radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of \\lambda and the angle \\theta (with z-axis), along which the power is measured. If the maximum power thus radiated is A, the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle \\theta = 30^0 and a possible form of f are, respectively,&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;1/2, \\lambda^(-4)&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;3/4, \\lambda^(-6)&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;1/4, \\lambda^(-4)&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;1/4, \\lambda^(-3)&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent FXLU:
The oscillating spheroid behaves as an electric dipole along the z‐axis, giving a radiation pattern proportional to sin^2θ. The maximum at θ=90° is A, so at θ=30° the fraction is sin^2(30°)=1/4. Dipole radiation power varies as ω^4∝λ^(-4).

### thinking by Debate Agent qrA9:
The radiation pattern of an oscillating dipole aligned along the z–axis is proportional to sin^2θ, with maximum at θ=90°. At θ=30°, sin^2(30°)=1/4. The dipole power scales as ω^4∝λ^(−4). Thus the fraction is 1/4 and f∝λ^(−4).

### thinking by Debate Agent S6HI:
We have an oscillating charge distribution symmetric around the z-axis. The lowest-order radiation is electric dipole. The angular distribution of dipole radiation goes as sin^2θ. The maximum occurs at θ=90° and at θ=30° the value is sin^2(30°)=(1/2)^2=1/4 of the maximum. The frequency (or wavelength) dependence of dipole radiation power is proportional to ω^4, i.e., λ^(-4). Thus the fraction is 1/4 and the λ-dependence is λ^(-4). That corresponds to choice3, i.e. option C).

### thinking by Debate Agent 9lWX:
For a spheroidal oscillating charge distribution, the leading radiation is dipole radiation along z. The angular distribution ∝ sin^2θ, giving maximum at θ=90°. At θ=30°, sin^2(30°)=(1/2)^2=1/4 of the maximum. The wavelength dependence for dipole radiation is ∝ω^4∝(1/λ)^4. Thus f∝λ^(−4) and the fraction is 1/4.

    <pre>The oscillating spheroidal charge acts like an electric dipole along z, with angular distribution ∝sin²θ. At θ=30°, sin²30°=1/4 of the maximum. Dipole radiation scales as ω⁴ ∝λ⁻⁴. Hence the fraction is 1/4 and f∝λ⁻⁴, corresponding to choice 3 (C).
