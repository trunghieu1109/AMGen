Question: Example(question='Consider an oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis). Because it oscillates, it would radiate at a wavelength \\lambda. In the radiation zone, the radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of \\lambda and the angle \\theta (with z-axis), along which the power is measured. If the maximum power thus radiated is A, the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle \\theta = 30^0 and a possible form of f are, respectively,', choice1='1/2, \\lambda^(-4)', choice2='3/4, \\lambda^(-6)', choice3='1/4, \\lambda^(-4)', choice4='1/4, \\lambda^(-3)', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The oscillating spheroidal charge acts like an electric dipole along z, with angular distribution ∝sin²θ. At θ=30°, sin²30°=1/4 of the maximum. Dipole radiation scales as ω⁴ ∝λ⁻⁴. Hence the fraction is 1/4 and f∝λ⁻⁴, corresponding to choice 3 (C).
