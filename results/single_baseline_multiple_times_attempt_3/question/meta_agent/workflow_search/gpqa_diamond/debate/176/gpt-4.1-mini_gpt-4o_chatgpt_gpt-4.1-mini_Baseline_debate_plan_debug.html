    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Astronomers are interested in the luminosities of two stars. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2. The mass of Star_1 is also larger by the same factor (1.5 times). Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same. Astronomers also calculated the radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;~2.25&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;~2.35&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;~2.32&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;~2.23\n&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent 65eB:
The luminosity of a star, assuming it radiates as a black body, is determined by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law: L = 4πR^2σT^4, where L is luminosity, R is radius, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature. The temperature can be derived from the wavelength at which the star appears brightest using Wien&#39;s Law, but since both stars have the same wavelength, they have the same temperature. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2, so R1 = 1.5R2. Substituting into the luminosity equation, L1 = 4π(1.5R2)^2σT^4 = 4π(2.25R2^2)σT^4 = 2.25 * 4πR2^2σT^4 = 2.25L2. Thus, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of 2.25.

### thinking by Debate Agent UBFY:
To determine the luminosity ratio between Star_1 and Star_2, we use the formula for luminosity L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius and T is the temperature. Since the wavelengths at which both stars appear brightest are the same, they have the same temperature due to Wien&#39;s Law. The radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2, so the ratio of their luminosities is (1.5)² = 2.25. The radial velocity does not affect luminosity, so it is irrelevant to this calculation.

### thinking by Debate Agent R7k5:
The luminosity of a star radiating as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law, L = 4πR^2σT^4, where R is the radius, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature. Since the stars appear brightest at the same wavelength, they have the same temperature due to Wien&#39;s Law. Thus, the luminosity ratio depends only on the square of the radius ratio. Given that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2, the luminosity of Star_1 is (1.5)^2 times that of Star_2, which is 2.25.

### thinking by Debate Agent 5N6p:
The luminosity of a star, assuming it radiates as a black body, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law: L = 4πR^2σT^4, where R is the radius and T is the temperature. Since the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same, their temperatures are the same (Wien&#39;s Law). Therefore, the factor by which the luminosity differs depends solely on the radius difference. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2. Thus, the luminosity of Star_1 compared to Star_2 is (1.5)^2 = 2.25 times greater.
