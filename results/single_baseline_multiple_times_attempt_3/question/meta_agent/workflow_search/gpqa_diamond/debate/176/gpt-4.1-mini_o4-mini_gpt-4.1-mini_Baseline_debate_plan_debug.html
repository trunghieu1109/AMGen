    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Astronomers are interested in the luminosities of two stars. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2. The mass of Star_1 is also larger by the same factor (1.5 times). Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same. Astronomers also calculated the radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;~2.25&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;~2.35&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;~2.32&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;~2.23\n&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent 65eB:
The observed peak wavelengths are equal, but Star_2’s recession (v=700 km/s) redshifts its observed λ_max by (1+v/c). Its true λ_em = λ_obs/(1+v/c), so T2 = (1+v/c)T1. Luminosity ratio L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2·(T1/T2)^4 = 1.5^2/(1+700/3e5)^4 ≈ 2.23.

### thinking by Debate Agent UBFY:
We have Star_1 radius R1=1.5R2, so R1/R2=1.5. Observed peak wavelengths are same, but Star_2 has radial velocity v=700 km/s, so its emitted peak λ_emit2=λ_obs/(1+v/c). Therefore T2/T1=(λ_emit1/λ_emit2)=(1+v/c)≈1.002333. Luminosity ratio L1/L2=(R1/R2)^2 (T1/T2)^4=1.5^2/(1.002333^4)≈2.25/1.00936≈2.23.

### thinking by Debate Agent R7k5:
The observed peak wavelengths are equal, but Star_2’s λ_peak is redshifted by (1+v/c). Thus T2=T1(1+v/c) and L∝R^2T^4 gives L1/L2=(1.5)^2*(1/(1+v/c))^4≈2.25*0.9907≈2.23.

### thinking by Debate Agent 5N6p:
We have two stars with equal observed peak wavelengths, but one is receding at 700 km/s, so its rest peak wavelength λ_rest2=λ_obs/(1+v/c). Thus T2=b/λ_rest2=T1(1+v/c) ≈T1×1.00233. Luminosity L∝R^2T^4, with R1=1.5R2: L1/L2=(1.5^2)/(1.00233^4)=2.25/1.00935≈2.228. Thus ≈2.23.
