    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Astronomers are interested in the luminosities of two stars. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2. The mass of Star_1 is also larger by the same factor (1.5 times). Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same. Astronomers also calculated the radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;~2.25&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;~2.35&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;~2.32&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;~2.23\n&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent 65eB:
The stars have the same peak wavelength, indicating they have the same surface temperature (from Wien&#39;s law: \( \lambda_{max} T = constant \)). Luminosity of a star is given by \( L = 4 \pi R^2 \sigma T^4 \). Since temperature is the same for both stars, the ratio of luminosities depends only on the square of their radii. Given Star_1 has radius 1.5 times that of Star_2, the luminosity ratio is \( (1.5)^2 = 2.25 \). The radial velocity difference does not affect luminosity here. Therefore, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater by a factor of approximately 2.25.

### thinking by Debate Agent UBFY:
Given that both stars have the same peak wavelength, by Wien&#39;s law, they have the same temperature. Luminosity L of a star is given by L = 4πR^2σT^4. Since T is the same for both stars, the luminosity ratio depends only on the square of the radius ratio. Star_1 has radius 1.5 times that of Star_2, so L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. The mass and radial velocities do not affect the luminosity calculation here. Therefore, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of approximately 2.25.

### thinking by Debate Agent R7k5:
Given that the stars have the same peak wavelength, by Wien&#39;s law, their temperatures are equal. Luminosity L is given by L = 4πR^2σT^4. Since T is the same for both stars, the ratio of luminosities depends on the square of the ratio of their radii. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2, so L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. Therefore, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of approximately 2.25.

### thinking by Debate Agent 5N6p:
Given that both stars have the same wavelength at which they appear brightest, by Wien&#39;s law, their temperatures are the same. The luminosity L of a star radiating as a black body is given by L = 4 * pi * R^2 * sigma * T^4. Since T is the same for both stars, the ratio of luminosities depends only on the square of the radii. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, so the luminosity ratio L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. Therefore, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of approximately 2.25.

    <pre>The stars have the same peak wavelength, indicating they have the same temperature by Wien&#39;s law. Luminosity depends on the radius squared and temperature to the fourth power. Since temperatures are equal, the luminosity ratio depends only on the square of the radius ratio. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2, so the luminosity ratio is (1.5)^2 = 2.25. The mass and radial velocities do not affect the luminosity calculation here.
