Its true λ_em = λ_obs/(1+v/c), so T2 = (1+v/c)T1. Luminosity ratio L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2·(T1/T2)^4 = 1.5^2/(1+700/3e5)^4 ≈ 2.23.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent UBFY:\nWe have Star_1 radius R1=1.5R2, so R1/R2=1.5. Observed peak wavelengths are same, but Star_2 has radial velocity v=700\u2009km/s, so its emitted peak λ_emit2=λ_obs/(1+v/c). Therefore T2/T1=(λ_emit1/λ_emit2)=(1+v/c)≈1.002333. Luminosity ratio L1/L2=(R1/R2)^2 (T1/T2)^4=1.5^2/(1.002333^4)≈2.25/1.00936≈2.23.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent R7k5:\nThe observed peak wavelengths are equal, but Star_2’s λ_peak is redshifted by (1+v/c). Thus T2=T1(1+v/c) and L∝R^2T^4 gives L1/L2=(1.5)^2*(1/(1+v/c))^4≈2.25*0.9907≈2.23.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent 5N6p:\nWe have two stars with equal observed peak wavelengths, but one is receding at 700 km/s, so its rest peak wavelength λ_rest2=λ_obs/(1+v/c). Thus T2=b/λ_rest2=T1(1+v/c) ≈T1×1.00233. Luminosity L∝R^2T^4, with R1=1.5R2: L1/L2=(1.5^2)/(1.00233^4)=2.25/1.00935≈2.228. Thus ≈2.23.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 65eB:\nD)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent UBFY:\nD)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent R7k5:\nD)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 5N6p:\nD)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
