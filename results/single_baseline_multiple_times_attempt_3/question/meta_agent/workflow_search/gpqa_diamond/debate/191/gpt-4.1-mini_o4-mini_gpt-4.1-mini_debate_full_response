Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Final Decision Agent v6F7', content='When a charge +q is placed inside an off‐center cavity in an uncharged conducting sphere, it induces –q on the inner cavity surface and +q on the outer surface. By Gauss’s law the external field depends only on the net charge on the outer surface, which is +q, and behaves as if concentrated at the sphere’s center. Hence for a point at distance L>R from the center, E = (1/4πε₀)·q/L².\n\nAnswer:D)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.

The conductor remains neutral, and outside the conductor the field is as if a point charge +q is at the centre of the sphere. Thus E = (1/4πε0)·q/L^2.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent 13vF:\nWhen a charge +q is placed inside an uncharged conducting shell, it induces –q on the inner cavity wall and +q on the outer surface. The external field outside the conductor is that of a point charge +q located at the center, independent of the cavity offset. Thus at distance L from the conductor’s center, E=1/(4πε₀)·q/L².\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent uR49:\nWe have an uncharged conducting shell with an off‐center cavity. A charge +q placed inside the cavity induces –q on the inner cavity surface and +q on the outer surface, leaving the net conductor charge zero. By Gauss’s law, the field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge on the outer surface, +q, and acts as if located at the conductor’s centre. Thus for a point outside (distance L from the conductor’s centre), E = (1/4πε0) q/L^2. This matches choice 4.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent Us29:\nFor a conductor, any internal charge induces charges on the cavity walls and the outer surface such that the field inside the conducting material is zero. The net charge on the outer surface equals +q, and the external field is identical to that of a point charge +q located at the sphere’s center, regardless of the cavity’s displacement or the charge’s position within. Therefore at a distance L (>R) from the conductor’s center, E = (1/4πε0)·q/L².\n\n### answer by Debate Agent h70z:\nD)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 13vF:\nD)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent uR49:\nD)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent Us29:\nD)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
