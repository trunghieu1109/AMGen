Question: Example(question='Imagine an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ having a small spherical cavity inside. The centre of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the centre of the spherical conductor. The radius of the cavity is $r$, and $r<R$. Now consider a small amount of positive charge $+q$ is somehow placed somewhere inside the cavity. What is the magnitude of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at a point P (outside the spherical conductor) of distance $L$ from the centre of the spherical conductor? Note, the distance of the point P from the centre of the cavity is $l$. Here, l, L > R. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\\theta$\n', choice1='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n', choice2='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n', choice3='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\n', choice4='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: The problem involves a charge +q placed inside a cavity within an uncharged spherical conductor. The conductor rearranges induced charges such that the electric field inside the conductor's material is zero. From outside the conductor, the system behaves as if the entire charge +q is concentrated at the center of the spherical conductor. Therefore, the electric field at a point P outside the conductor at distance L from its center is given by Coulomb's law for a point charge +q located at the center. The other parameters (l, s, θ) related to the cavity and charge position inside do not affect the external field. Hence, the correct expression for the electric field magnitude at point P is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L², which corresponds to choice D).
