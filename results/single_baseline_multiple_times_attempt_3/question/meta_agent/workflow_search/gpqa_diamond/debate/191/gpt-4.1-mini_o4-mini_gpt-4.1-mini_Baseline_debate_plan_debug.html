    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;Imagine an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ having a small spherical cavity inside. The centre of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the centre of the spherical conductor. The radius of the cavity is $r$, and $r&lt;R$. Now consider a small amount of positive charge $+q$ is somehow placed somewhere inside the cavity. What is the magnitude of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at a point P (outside the spherical conductor) of distance $L$ from the centre of the spherical conductor? Note, the distance of the point P from the centre of the cavity is $l$. Here, l, L &gt; R. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\\theta$\n&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\n&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent h70z:
An off‐center charge in a cavity induces –q on the inner surface and +q on the outer surface. The conductor remains neutral, and outside the conductor the field is as if a point charge +q is at the centre of the sphere. Thus E = (1/4πε0)·q/L^2.

### thinking by Debate Agent 13vF:
When a charge +q is placed inside an uncharged conducting shell, it induces –q on the inner cavity wall and +q on the outer surface. The external field outside the conductor is that of a point charge +q located at the center, independent of the cavity offset. Thus at distance L from the conductor’s center, E=1/(4πε₀)·q/L².

### thinking by Debate Agent uR49:
We have an uncharged conducting shell with an off‐center cavity. A charge +q placed inside the cavity induces –q on the inner cavity surface and +q on the outer surface, leaving the net conductor charge zero. By Gauss’s law, the field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge on the outer surface, +q, and acts as if located at the conductor’s centre. Thus for a point outside (distance L from the conductor’s centre), E = (1/4πε0) q/L^2. This matches choice 4.

### thinking by Debate Agent Us29:
For a conductor, any internal charge induces charges on the cavity walls and the outer surface such that the field inside the conducting material is zero. The net charge on the outer surface equals +q, and the external field is identical to that of a point charge +q located at the sphere’s center, regardless of the cavity’s displacement or the charge’s position within. Therefore at a distance L (&gt;R) from the conductor’s center, E = (1/4πε0)·q/L².

    <pre>When a charge +q is placed inside an off‐center cavity in an uncharged conducting sphere, it induces –q on the inner cavity surface and +q on the outer surface. By Gauss’s law the external field depends only on the net charge on the outer surface, which is +q, and behaves as if concentrated at the sphere’s center.
