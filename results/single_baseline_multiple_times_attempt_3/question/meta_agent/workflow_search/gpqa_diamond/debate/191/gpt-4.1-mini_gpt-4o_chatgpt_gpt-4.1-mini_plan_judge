Question: Example(question='Imagine an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ having a small spherical cavity inside. The centre of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the centre of the spherical conductor. The radius of the cavity is $r$, and $r<R$. Now consider a small amount of positive charge $+q$ is somehow placed somewhere inside the cavity. What is the magnitude of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at a point P (outside the spherical conductor) of distance $L$ from the centre of the spherical conductor? Note, the distance of the point P from the centre of the cavity is $l$. Here, l, L > R. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\\theta$\n', choice1='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n', choice2='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n', choice3='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\n', choice4='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: All agents agree that when a charge is placed inside a cavity within a conductor, the conductor redistributes its charges such that the electric field inside the conductor is zero. This results in an induced charge on the inner surface of the cavity and an equal and opposite charge on the outer surface of the conductor. For a point outside the conductor, the electric field is as if the entire charge is at the center of the conductor. Therefore, the electric field at a point P outside the conductor is given by Coulomb's law for a point charge located at the center of the conductor. Since point P is at a distance L from the center of the spherical conductor, the electric field at P is given by the expression for the electric field due to a point charge located at the center of the conductor, which is $E = \dfrac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_o} \dfrac{q}{L^2}$. Thus, the correct choice is D).
