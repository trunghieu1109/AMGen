Question: Example(question='What is the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product obtained when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess of HI?', choice1='1', choice2='3', choice3='0', choice4='5', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The starting compound 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid has multiple degrees of unsaturation: one ring, one double bond in the ring, one vinyl double bond, and two carbonyl groups (aldehyde and carboxylic acid), totaling 5. When reacted with red phosphorus and excess HI, the aldehyde and carboxylic acid groups are reduced to alkyl groups, removing their double bond equivalents. The double bonds in the ring and vinyl group are also reduced to single bonds. The ring remains intact. Therefore, the product has only one ring and no double bonds or carbonyls, resulting in an index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of 1. This matches the reasoning of agents wZed and w3UP, who concluded the IHD is 1.
