    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;What is the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product obtained when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess of HI?&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;1&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;3&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;0&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;5&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent lzdt:
The reaction of red phosphorus and excess HI reduces both the aldehyde (2-formyl) and carboxylic acid groups to methyl, and hydrogenates the vinyl and ring double bonds to give 1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane. This saturated cyclohexane has only the ring as a degree of unsaturation (IHD = 1).

### thinking by Debate Agent ydVS:
The reaction of red P and excess HI reduces aldehyde to methyl, decarboxylates the acid, and hydrogenates all C=C bonds (ring and vinyl). Thus the product is a saturated cyclohexane ring with one methyl and one ethyl substituent: C9H20. IHD=(2×9+2−20)/2=0.

### thinking by Debate Agent wZed:
The red P/HI reduces the CHO to CH3, the COOH to CH3, and hydrogenates both the vinyl and the ring C=C. The only remaining unsaturation is the cyclohexane ring itself, giving one degree of unsaturation.

### thinking by Debate Agent w3UP:
The reaction with Red P/HI reduces the COOH and CHO groups to methyls and the vinyl to ethyl, and hydrogenates the ring double bond. The product is a fully saturated cyclohexane with three alkyl substituents (two methyls and one ethyl). A cyclohexane ring gives one degree of unsaturation (IHD =1).
