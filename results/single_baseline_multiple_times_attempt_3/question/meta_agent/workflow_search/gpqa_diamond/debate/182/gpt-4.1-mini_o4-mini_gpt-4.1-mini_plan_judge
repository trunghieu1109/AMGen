Question: Example(question='What is the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product obtained when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess of HI?', choice1='1', choice2='3', choice3='0', choice4='5', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: Red P/HI reduces COOH→CH3, CHO→CH3, vinyl→ethyl, and the ring C=C→CH–CH. The product is 1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane (C10H20), a saturated cyclohexane (one ring = 1 IHD, no double bonds).
