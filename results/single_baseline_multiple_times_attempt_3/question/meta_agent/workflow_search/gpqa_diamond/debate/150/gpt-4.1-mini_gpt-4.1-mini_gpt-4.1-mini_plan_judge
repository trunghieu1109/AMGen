Question: Example(question='The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1). An observable of the system is represented by the matrix operator P having elements in the first row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0),  in the second row as (1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}) and in the third row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0). Calculate the probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 at time t.', choice1='1/3\n', choice2='2/3\n', choice3='\\sqrt{2/3}\n', choice4='1', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: The problem involves finding the probability that a measurement of the observable P on the state vector |ψ⟩ yields the eigenvalue 0. First, normalize the state vector |ψ⟩ = (-1, 2, 1), which has norm sqrt(6), so the normalized vector is (-1/√6, 2/√6, 1/√6). The observable P is a symmetric matrix with eigenvalues found by solving det(P - λI) = 0, yielding eigenvalues λ = -1, 0, 1. The eigenvector corresponding to λ=0 satisfies P|v⟩=0, leading to the eigenvector (1, 0, -1) normalized to (1/√2, 0, -1/√2). The probability of measuring 0 is the squared magnitude of the projection of |ψ⟩ onto this eigenvector: |⟨v|ψ⟩|^2 = (1/3). All detailed calculations confirm this result, matching choice A).
