Question: Example(question="If uncertainty in space of electron's location, which is travelling with speed v= 2* 10^8 m/s along x-direction is Δx=0.1 nm . Based on the infromation estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of electron.", choice1='~10^(-19) J', choice2='~10^(-18) J', choice3='~10^(-16) J', choice4='~10^(-17) J', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: Using Heisenberg’s principle Δx·Δp ≥ ħ/2 with Δx = 0.1 nm = 1×10⁻¹⁰ m and ħ ≈ 1.05×10⁻³⁴ J·s gives Δp ≥ 1.05×10⁻³⁴/(2×10⁻¹⁰) ≈ 5.25×10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s. The uncertainty in kinetic energy ΔE ≈ v·Δp with v = 2×10⁸ m/s yields ΔE ≈ 2×10⁸×5.25×10⁻²⁵ ≈ 1.05×10⁻¹⁶ J, so the closest choice is ~10⁻¹⁶ J.
