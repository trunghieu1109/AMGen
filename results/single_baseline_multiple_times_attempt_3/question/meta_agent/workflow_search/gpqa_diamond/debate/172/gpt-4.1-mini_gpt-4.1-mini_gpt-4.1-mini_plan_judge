Question: Example(question="If uncertainty in space of electron's location, which is travelling with speed v= 2* 10^8 m/s along x-direction is Δx=0.1 nm . Based on the infromation estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of electron.", choice1='~10^(-19) J', choice2='~10^(-18) J', choice3='~10^(-16) J', choice4='~10^(-17) J', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: All agents have used Heisenberg's uncertainty principle Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2 to find the uncertainty in momentum Δp, then converted that to uncertainty in velocity Δv, and finally estimated the uncertainty in kinetic energy ΔE ≈ m * v * Δv. The calculations consistently yield ΔE on the order of 10^-16 J. The closest choice to this value is choice3: ~10^(-16) J.
