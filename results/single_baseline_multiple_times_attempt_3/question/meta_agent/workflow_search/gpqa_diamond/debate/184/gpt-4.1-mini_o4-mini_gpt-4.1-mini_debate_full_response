The operator σ·n has eigenvalues ±1 because any Pauli matrix dot a unit vector squares to identity. Thus H’s eigenvalues are ε times ±1, i.e. +ε and −ε.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent 7Dc4:\nThe operator σ·n satisfies (σ·n)^2 = 1, so its eigenvalues are ±1. Multiplying by ε gives H eigenvalues ±ε.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent Mrcx:\nWe have H=ε σ·n where σ·n has eigenvalues ±1 (since σ are Pauli matrices and n is a unit vector). Therefore the eigenvalues of H are ε(±1)=±ε.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent jHjk:\nThe operator σ·n is a Pauli matrix in some direction, so its eigenvalues are ±1. Multiplying by ε gives eigenvalues ±ε. Thus the correct choice is A).\n\n### answer by Debate Agent OfZu:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 7Dc4:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent Mrcx:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent jHjk:\nA)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
