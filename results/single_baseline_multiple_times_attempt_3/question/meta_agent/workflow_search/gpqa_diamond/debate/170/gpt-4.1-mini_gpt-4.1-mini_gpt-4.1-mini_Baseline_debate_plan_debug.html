### thinking by Debate Agent 5cfs:
The question asks to arrange substances 1-6 based on the increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic substitution with excess bromine. The substituents on the benzene ring influence the orientation and yield of para-substituted products depending on their electron-donating or withdrawing effects.

Let&#39;s analyze each substituent:
1) C6H5-CH3 (toluene): -CH3 is an electron-donating group (activating, ortho/para directing), gives a high para yield.
2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (ethyl benzoate): -COOC2H5 is an electron-withdrawing group (deactivating, meta directing), low para yield.
3) C6H5-Cl (chlorobenzene): -Cl is electron-withdrawing but ortho/para directing due to resonance, moderate para yield.
4) C6H5-NO2 (nitrobenzene): -NO2 is strongly electron-withdrawing, meta directing, very low para yield.
5) C6H5-C2H5 (ethylbenzene): -C2H5 is electron-donating (activating, ortho/para directing), high para yield.
6) C6H5-COOH (benzoic acid): -COOH is electron-withdrawing, meta directing, low para yield.

Therefore, increasing order of para yield fraction should be:
Strongly meta directing (lowest para) - NO2 (4) &lt; COOH (6) &lt; COOC2H5 (2) &lt; Cl (3) &lt; CH3 (1) &lt; C2H5 (5)

Comparing with the options:
Choice 2: 4&lt;2&lt;6&lt;3&lt;1&lt;5 matches closely except 2 and 6 are swapped.
Choice 4: 4&lt;6&lt;2&lt;1&lt;5&lt;3 - last two are 5 and 3 swapped, but 3 (Cl) is less activating than 5 (ethyl), so para yield of 5 should be higher than 3.
Choice 1 and 3 do not match the expected order.

Between choices 2 and 4, choice 4 matches the expected trend better as 6 (COOH) is more strongly deactivating than 2 (COOC2H5) and 3 (Cl) is less activating than 5 (ethyl).

Hence, the best answer is choice 4.

### thinking by Debate Agent jowT:
The question involves electrophilic substitution on substituted benzene rings and the relative yield of the para-isomer. Electron-donating groups (EDGs) generally direct ortho/para substitution, increasing the para-isomer yield, while electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) generally direct meta substitution and reduce para-isomer yield. The groups are:
1) C6H5-CH3 (methyl, EDG, ortho/para director)
2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (ester, EWG, meta director)
3) C6H5-Cl (chloro, weak EWG but ortho/para director due to resonance)
4) C6H5-NO2 (nitro, strong EWG, meta director)
5) C6H5-C2H5 (ethyl, EDG, ortho/para director)
6) C6H5-COOH (carboxylic acid, EWG, meta director)

Para yield is higher for strong ortho/para directors and lower for meta directors. Among ortho/para directors, alkyl groups (methyl, ethyl) give higher para yields than halogens (Cl), which have steric hindrance.

Ordering from lowest to highest para-isomer yield:
Strong EWGs (NO2) &lt; moderate EWGs (COOH, COOC2H5) &lt; halogen (Cl) &lt; alkyl groups (CH3, C2H5)

Given the options, choice2: &#39;4&lt;2&lt;6&lt;3&lt;1&lt;5&#39; fits this order best:
4 (NO2) &lt; 2 (COOC2H5) &lt; 6 (COOH) &lt; 3 (Cl) &lt; 1 (CH3) &lt; 5 (C2H5)

Therefore, the correct answer is B).

### thinking by Debate Agent zqEy:
The question asks to arrange substances 1-6 based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction. The substituents on the benzene ring influence the orientation and yield of para-isomer due to their electronic effects (activating/deactivating and ortho/para or meta directing).

Let&#39;s analyze each substituent:
1) C6H5-CH3 (toluene): Methyl is an activating, ortho/para-directing group, so it favors para substitution with a relatively high para yield.
2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (ethyl benzoate): Ester is a moderately deactivating, meta-directing group, so para substitution is less favored; para yield should be low.
3) C6H5-Cl (chlorobenzene): Cl is deactivating but ortho/para-directing due to resonance, so para substitution occurs but yield is moderate.
4) C6H5-NO2 (nitrobenzene): NO2 is strongly deactivating and meta-directing, so para substitution yield is very low.
5) C6H5-C2H5 (ethylbenzene): Ethyl is activating, ortho/para-directing, similar to methyl but possibly slightly more activating, so para yield is relatively high.
6) C6H5-COOH (benzoic acid): Carboxyl is strongly deactivating and meta-directing, so para substitution yield is low.

Order of increasing para-isomer yield would be from strongly meta directing (lowest para) to strongly ortho/para directing (highest para):
NO2 (4) &lt; COOH (6) &lt; COOC2H5 (2) &lt; Cl (3) &lt; CH3 (1) &lt; C2H5 (5)

This matches choice 2: &#39;4&lt;2&lt;6&lt;3&lt;1&lt;5&#39; except COOH and ester are swapped. But COOH is more strongly deactivating than ester, so COOH should be before ester.
Choice 4 is &#39;4&lt;6&lt;2&lt;1&lt;5&lt;3&#39; but Cl (3) is last which is incorrect because Cl is ortho/para directing.
Choice 1 and 3 do not fit the expected pattern.

Hence, the correct order based on para-isomer yield increasing is choice 2: 4&lt;2&lt;6&lt;3&lt;1&lt;5, considering the question&#39;s grouping and typical directing effects.

### thinking by Debate Agent t3I8:
The problem involves electrophilic substitution on monosubstituted benzene rings, where the substituent directs the incoming electrophile to ortho/para or meta positions. We are to arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer in the monobromo derivative.

First, identify the directing effects of each substituent:
1) C6H5-CH3 (toluene) - methyl is an activating, ortho/para-directing group.
2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (ethyl benzoate) - ester is a deactivating, meta-directing group.
3) C6H5-Cl (chlorobenzene) - halogen is deactivating but ortho/para-directing.
4) C6H5-NO2 (nitrobenzene) - strongly deactivating, meta-directing.
5) C6H5-C2H5 (ethylbenzene) - alkyl is activating, ortho/para-directing.
6) C6H5-COOH (benzoic acid) - carboxyl is deactivating, meta-directing.

Next, consider the para/ortho ratio for each substituent type:
- Activating groups (alkyl): usually give a higher para fraction compared to meta groups.
- Halogens: ortho/para directing but less activating, often give a moderate para fraction.
- Deactivating meta directors: give low para substitution.

Order of increasing para fraction should start from meta directors (lowest para), then ester and acid (meta directors), then halogen (ortho/para), then alkyl groups (higher para).

Given that, the increasing order of para fraction is:
NO2 (4) &lt; COOH (6) &lt; COOC2H5 (2) &lt; Cl (3) &lt; CH3 (1) &lt; C2H5 (5)

This corresponds to choice 2: &#39;4&lt;2&lt;6&lt;3&lt;1&lt;5&#39; or choice 4: &#39;4&lt;6&lt;2&lt;1&lt;5&lt;3&#39;. Comparing 2 and 4, the difference is order of 2 and 6 and the last two.

Between 2 (ester) and 6 (acid), the acid is more strongly deactivating, so para fraction should be lower for acid than ester, so 6&lt;2.

Also, between 3 (Cl) and 1 (CH3), methyl is more activating and should have higher para fraction than Cl, so 3&lt;1.

Between 1 (CH3) and 5 (C2H5), ethyl is similar to methyl but slightly more bulky, which can increase para selectivity.

Therefore, the correct order is 4&lt;6&lt;2&lt;3&lt;1&lt;5, which matches none of the options exactly. The closest is choice 4: &#39;4&lt;6&lt;2&lt;1&lt;5&lt;3&#39;, but it places 3 last, which is inconsistent.

Choice 2 is &#39;4&lt;2&lt;6&lt;3&lt;1&lt;5&#39;, which places 2 before 6, which is less correct.

Given the options, choice 2 is the best match considering the given substituents and their directing effects.

Therefore, the answer is choice 2.

    <pre>The question requires arranging substituted benzenes in order of increasing para-isomer yield in electrophilic bromination. Electron-donating groups (EDGs) like alkyl groups (methyl, ethyl) are ortho/para directors and increase para substitution yield. Electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) like nitro, carboxyl, and ester groups are meta directors and reduce para substitution yield. Halogens are deactivating but ortho/para directing, giving moderate para yield.
