proposed answer: In electrophilic substitution reactions, the directing effects of substituents on a benzene ring determine the position of substitution. Activating groups like alkyl groups (e.g., CH3, C2H5) are ortho/para-directing, while deactivating groups like NO2, COOH, and COOC2H5 are meta-directing. Cl is ortho/para-directing but deactivating. The para-isomer yield will be higher for ortho/para-directing groups. Thus, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is determined by the strength of their directing effects and activation/deactivation nature. Considering this, the most para-directing will be alkyl groups, followed by Cl, then the deactivating groups. Therefore, the order is likely 4 (strongly meta-directing) < 2 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5. This matches the consensus of most agents.
