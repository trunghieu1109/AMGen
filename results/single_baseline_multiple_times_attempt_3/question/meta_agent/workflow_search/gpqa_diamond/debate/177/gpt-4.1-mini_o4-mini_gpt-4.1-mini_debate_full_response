A Dirac field ψ has mass dimension 3/2, F^{μν} has dimension 2, σ_{μν} is dimensionless. So L_int has dimension [κ] + 3 (from ψ and ψ̄) + 2 = [κ] + 5. Setting this equal to 4 gives [κ] = -1. A coupling with negative mass dimension is nonrenormalizable.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent xWMy:\nIn 4D, the Lagrangian density has mass dimension 4. The fermion field ψ has dimension 3/2, so the bilinear ψ̄σμνψ has dimension 3. The field strength Fμν has dimension 2. Thus the interaction term has dimension [κ]+3+2, which must equal 4. Hence [κ]=4−5=−1. A coupling with negative mass dimension is nonrenormalizable.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent 2cCZ:\nWe have the interaction Lagrangian L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. The mass dimensions are: [ψ] = 3/2, σ_{μν} is dimensionless, so ψ̄ σ ψ has dimension 3. The field strength F^{μν} has dimension 2. Thus the operator ψ̄ σ ψ F has dimension 5. The Lagrangian density must have total mass dimension 4, so κ must supply dimension 4−5 = −1. A coupling of negative mass dimension indicates a nonrenormalizable interaction.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent hSub:\nThe interaction Lagrangian L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. The fermion field ψ has mass dimension 3/2, F^{μν} has dimension 2, and σ_{μν} is dimensionless. So the operator ψ̄σψF has dimension 3/2+3/2+2 = 5. To make L_dim = 4 we need [κ] + 5 = 4 → [κ] = -1. A coupling with negative mass dimension signals a nonrenormalizable interaction.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent bapV:\nC)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent xWMy:\nC)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 2cCZ:\nC)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent hSub:\nC)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
