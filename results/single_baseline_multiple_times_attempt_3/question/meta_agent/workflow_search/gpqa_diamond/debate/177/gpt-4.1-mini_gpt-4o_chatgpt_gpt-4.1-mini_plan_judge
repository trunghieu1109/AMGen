proposed answer: To determine the mass dimension of \(\kappa\), we analyze the mass dimensions of the components in the Lagrangian. The fermion field \(\psi\) has mass dimension \(\frac{3}{2}\), and the field strength tensor \(F^{\mu\nu}\) has mass dimension 2. The \(\sigma_{\mu\nu}\) matrix is dimensionless. Therefore, the term \(\bar{\psi}\sigma_{\mu\nu}\psi F^{\mu\nu}\) has mass dimension \(2 \times \frac{3}{2} + 2 = 5\). Since the Lagrangian density must have mass dimension 4, \(\kappa\) must have mass dimension \(-1\) to make the total dimension 4. A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimension. Since \(\kappa\) has a negative mass dimension, the theory is not renormalizable.
