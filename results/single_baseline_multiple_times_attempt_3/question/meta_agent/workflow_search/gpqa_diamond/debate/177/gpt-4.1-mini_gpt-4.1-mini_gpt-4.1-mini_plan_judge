proposed answer: The Lagrangian density in 4-dimensional spacetime has mass dimension 4. The fermion field \psi has mass dimension 3/2, so \bar{\psi} \psi has dimension 3. The field strength tensor F^{\mu\nu} has mass dimension 2. The sigma matrix \sigma_{\mu\nu} is dimensionless. Therefore, the operator \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu} has mass dimension 3 + 2 = 5. To keep the Lagrangian dimension 4, the coupling constant \kappa must have mass dimension 4 - 5 = -1. A coupling with negative mass dimension indicates a non-renormalizable interaction. Hence, \kappa has mass dimension -1 and the theory is not renormalizable.
