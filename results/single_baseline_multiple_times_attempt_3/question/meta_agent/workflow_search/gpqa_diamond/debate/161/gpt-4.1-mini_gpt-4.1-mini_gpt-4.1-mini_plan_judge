proposed answer: The metric given is ds^2 = (32 / (4 - x^2 - y^2)) (dx^2 + dy^2), which is a conformal metric on the disk x^2 + y^2 < 4. The area element dA is given by the conformal factor times the Euclidean area element: dA = (32 / (4 - r^2)) dx dy, where r^2 = x^2 + y^2. Converting to polar coordinates, dx dy = r dr dθ, and the area is A = ∫_0^{2π} ∫_0^2 (32 r / (4 - r^2)) dr dθ = 2π ∫_0^2 (32 r / (4 - r^2)) dr. Substituting u = 4 - r^2, du = -2r dr, the integral becomes proportional to ∫ (1/u) du, which diverges logarithmically as u → 0 (r → 2). Therefore, the area integral diverges to infinity. Hence, the area of the pseudosphere of radius 2 under this metric is infinite.
