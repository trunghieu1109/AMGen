Question: Example(question='We have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate, where the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M and the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16. What will be the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species in the solution?

Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The problem involves calculating the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex Co(SCN)2 among all cobalt species in solution. Given total cobalt concentration c(Co) = 10^-2 M and thiocyanate concentration [SCN-] = 0.1 M, and the cumulative stability constants β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16, we express the concentrations of each complex in terms of free Co(II) concentration [Co]. Using the formula for total cobalt concentration: c(Co) = [Co] * (1 + β1[SCN] + β2[SCN]^2 + β3[SCN]^3 + β4[SCN]^4), we calculate the sum inside the parentheses as 2.3646. Solving for [Co] gives approximately 0.00423 M. The concentration of Co(SCN)2 is then β2 * [Co] * [SCN]^2 = 0.4 * [Co] = 0.00169 M. The percentage of Co(SCN)2 is (0.00169 / 0.01) * 100% = 16.9%. This matches choice1.
