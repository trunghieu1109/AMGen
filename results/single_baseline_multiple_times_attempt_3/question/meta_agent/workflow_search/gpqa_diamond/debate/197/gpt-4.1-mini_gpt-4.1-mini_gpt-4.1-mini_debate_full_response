Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Final Decision Agent xiWy', content='The problem involves calculating the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex Co(SCN)2 among all cobalt species in solution. Given total cobalt concentration c(Co) = 10^-2 M and thiocyanate concentration [SCN-] = 0.1 M, and the cumulative stability constants β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16, we express the concentrations of each complex in terms of free Co(II) concentration [Co]. Using the formula for total cobalt concentration: c(Co) = [Co] * (1 + β1[SCN] + β2[SCN]^2 + β3[SCN]^3 + β4[SCN]^4), we calculate the sum inside the parentheses as 2.3646. Solving for [Co] gives approximately 0.00423 M. The concentration of Co(SCN)2 is then β2 * [Co] * [SCN]^2 = 0.4 * [Co] = 0.00169 M. The percentage of Co(SCN)2 is (0.00169 / 0.01) * 100% = 16.9%.

The stability constants (β) for the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. These correspond to the equilibrium constants for the successive formation of Co(SCN)+, Co(SCN)2, Co(SCN)3-, and Co(SCN)4^2- complexes respectively. We want to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is the Co(SCN)2 species, among all cobalt species. \n\nStep 1: Define the species concentrations in terms of free Co(II) concentration [Co2+].\nLet [Co2+] = x.\nThen:\n[Co(SCN)]+ = β1 * x * [SCN-] = 9 * x * 0.1 = 0.9x\n[Co(SCN)2] = β2 * x * [SCN-]^2 = 40 * x * (0.1)^2 = 40 * x * 0.01 = 0.4x\n[Co(SCN)3]- = β3 * x * [SCN-]^3 = 63 * x * (0.1)^3 = 63 * x * 0.001 = 0.063x\n[Co(SCN)4]2- = β4 * x * [SCN-]^4 = 16 * x * (0.1)^4 = 16 * x * 0.0001 = 0.0016x\n\nStep 2: Total cobalt concentration is the sum of all cobalt species:\n10^-2 = x + 0.9x + 0.4x + 0.063x + 0.0016x = x (1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016) = x * 2.3646\n\nStep 3: Solve for x:\nx = 10^-2 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.00423 M\n\nStep 4: Calculate concentration of Co(SCN)2:\n[Co(SCN)2] = 0.4 * x = 0.4 * 0.00423 = 0.00169 M\n\nStep 5: Calculate percentage of Co(SCN)2 among total Co:\nPercentage = (0.00169 / 0.01) * 100% ≈ 16.9%\n\nTherefore, the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is approximately 16.9%.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent eJow:\nWe are given a solution with total cobalt concentration c(Co) = 10^-2 M and [SCN-] = 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes Co(SCN)+, Co(SCN)2, Co(SCN)3-, and Co(SCN)4-2 are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16 respectively. These β values represent cumulative formation constants: β1 = [Co(SCN)]/[Co][SCN], β2 = [Co(SCN)2]/[Co][SCN]^2, etc. We want the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex Co(SCN)2 among all cobalt species, i.e., the fraction of Co(SCN)2 relative to total Co. Let's denote free Co(II) concentration as [Co]. Then concentrations of species are: [Co(SCN)] = β1 * [Co] * [SCN], [Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co] * [SCN]^2, [Co(SCN)3] = β3 * [Co] * [SCN]^3, [Co(SCN)4] = β4 * [Co] * [SCN]^4. Total Co is sum of all species: c(Co) = [Co] + [Co(SCN)] + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3] + [Co(SCN)4]. Substitute: c(Co) = [Co] * (1 + β1[SCN] + β2[SCN]^2 + β3[SCN]^3 + β4[SCN]^4). Calculate each term: [SCN] = 0.1 M, so [SCN]^2=0.01, [SCN]^3=0.001, [SCN]^4=0.0001. Sum inside parentheses: 1 + 9*0.1 + 40*0.01 + 63*0.001 + 16*0.0001 = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646. Then [Co] = c(Co)/2.3646 = 0.01/2.3646 ≈ 0.00423 M. Now, [Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co] * [SCN]^2 = 40 * 0.00423 * 0.01 = 40 * 0.0000423 = 0.001692 M. Percentage of Co(SCN)2 = ([Co(SCN)2]/c(Co)) * 100 = (0.001692 / 0.01) * 100 = 16.92%. Among the choices, 16.9% corresponds to choice1.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent xVo6:\nWe have Co(II) ions and SCN- ions forming complexes: Co(SCN)+, Co(SCN)2, Co(SCN)3-, Co(SCN)4^2-.

The blue dithiocyanato complex is Co(SCN)2. We need to find the fraction of Co that exists as Co(SCN)2.
