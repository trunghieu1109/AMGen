The complexes Co(SCN)_n have stability constants β_n, so the concentration ratio α_n=[Co(SCN)_n]/[Co²⁺]=β_n[SCN⁻]^n. Compute:\nα₀=1\nα₁=β₁[SCN]=9×0.1=0.9\nα₂=β₂[SCN]²=40×0.01=0.40\nα₃=β₃[SCN]³=63×0.001=0.063\nα₄=β₄[SCN]⁴=16×0.0001=0.0016\nTotal factor sum Σα=1+0.9+0.4+0.063+0.0016=2.3646\nFraction of the dithiocyanato complex Co(SCN)₂=α₂/Σα=0.40/2.3646≈0.1692→16.92% ≈16.9%\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent Jowx:\nWe have Co(II) total concentration c(Co)=10^{-2} M, [SCN−]=0.1 M. Stability constants (cumulative): β1=[Co(SCN)]/[Co][SCN]=9, β2=[Co(SCN)2]/([Co][SCN]^2)=40, β3=63, β4=16. Define x1=β1[SCN]=9×0.1=0.9; x2=β2[SCN]^2=40×0.01=0.4; x3=β3[SCN]^3=63×0.001=0.063; x4=β4[SCN]^4=16×0.0001=0.0016. Total distribution denominator D=1+x1+x2+x3+x4=1+0.9+0.4+0.063+0.0016=2.3646. Fraction of Co(SCN)2 (blue dithiocyanato) = x2/D=0.4/2.3646≈0.169=16.9%.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent Vo6U:\nWe have total [Co] = 0.01 M and free [SCN–] = 0.1 M. The formation constants are β1 = 9, β2 = 40, β3 = 63, β4 = 16, defined by βn = [Co(SCN)n]/([Co2+][SCN–]n). The fraction of Co in the form Co(SCN)2 is f2 = β2[SCN–]2 / (1 + β1[SCN–] + β2[SCN–]2 + β3[SCN–]3 + β4[SCN–]4). \nSubstitute [SCN–] = 0.1 M:\nβ1[SCN] = 9·0.1 = 0.9\nβ2[SCN]^2 = 40·0.01 = 0.4\nβ3[SCN]^3 = 63·0.001 = 0.063\nβ4[SCN]^4 = 16·0.0001 = 0.0016\nDenominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\nf2 = 0.4 / 2.3646 = 0.1692 ≈ 16.9%\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent D2wx:\nWe have total Co concentration c_tot=1×10^−2 M and [SCN–]≈0.1 M (ligand in large excess so free [SCN–]≈0.1 M). The cumulative stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. The fraction of the dithiocyanato complex Co(SCN)2 is f2=β2[L]^2/(1+β1[L]+β2[L]^2+β3[L]^3+β4[L]^4). Plugging in [L]=0.1 M gives denominator ≈1+9·0.1+40·0.01+63·0.001+16·0.0001≈2.3646, and numerator=40·(0.1)^2=0.4. Thus f2≈0.4/2.3646≈0.169 or 16.9%.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 6Fve:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent Jowx:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent Vo6U:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent D2wx:\nA)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
