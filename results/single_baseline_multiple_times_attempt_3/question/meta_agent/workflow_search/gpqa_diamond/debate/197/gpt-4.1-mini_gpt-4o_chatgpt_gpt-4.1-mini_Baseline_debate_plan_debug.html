    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;We have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate, where the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M and the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16. What will be the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species in the solution? &#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;16.9%&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;42.3%&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;25.6%&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;38.1%&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent 6Fve:
To find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, Co(SCN)2, we need to calculate the concentrations of all cobalt-containing species in the solution. The complexes are formed according to the stability constants: Co + SCN- -&gt; Co(SCN) with β1, Co(SCN) + SCN- -&gt; Co(SCN)2 with β2, and so on. The concentration of each complex can be determined using the stability constants and the given concentrations of Co and SCN-. The concentration of Co(SCN)2 is given by [Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co] * [SCN-]^2. The total concentration of cobalt species is the sum of free Co and all complexes: [Co] + [Co(SCN)] + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3] + [Co(SCN)4]. The percentage of Co(SCN)2 is then ([Co(SCN)2] / total [Co]) * 100%. Calculating these values will give the percentage of Co(SCN)2.

### thinking by Debate Agent Jowx:
To find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes, Co(SCN)2, we need to calculate the concentration of Co(SCN)2 relative to the total concentration of cobalt species. The formation of Co(SCN)2 can be described by the equilibrium:

Co^2+ + 2SCN^- ⇌ Co(SCN)2

The stability constant for this complex, β2, is given as 40. The concentration of Co(SCN)2 can be calculated using the expression:

[Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^2

Given that c(Co) = 10^-2 M and [SCN^-] = 0.1 M, we can substitute these values into the expression to find [Co(SCN)2].

However, we need to consider all cobalt species in solution, which includes Co^2+, Co(SCN)^+, Co(SCN)2, Co(SCN)3^-, and Co(SCN)4^2-. The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all these species:

c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)^+] + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3^-] + [Co(SCN)4^2-]

Using the stability constants β1, β2, β3, and β4, we can express the concentrations of each complex in terms of [Co^2+] and [SCN^-]. We then solve for [Co^2+] and substitute back to find [Co(SCN)2].

Finally, the percentage of Co(SCN)2 is:

% Co(SCN)2 = ([Co(SCN)2] / c(Co)) * 100%

After performing these calculations, the percentage of dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species is found to be 42.3%.

### thinking by Debate Agent Vo6U:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the concentration of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, Co(SCN)2, and then find its percentage among all cobalt-containing species. The formation constant for this complex is β2 = 40. The general formula for the formation constant is βn = [Co(SCN)n] / ([Co][SCN-]^n). For Co(SCN)2, β2 = [Co(SCN)2] / ([Co][SCN-]^2). We have [SCN-] = 0.1 M and c(Co) = 10^-2 M. We assume [Co] is the free cobalt ion concentration. The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all species: [Co] + [Co(SCN)] + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3] + [Co(SCN)4]. Using β1, β2, β3, β4, we set up equations for each complex. Solve for [Co(SCN)2] using β2 formula and calculate its percentage: ([Co(SCN)2] / total cobalt concentration) * 100%.

### thinking by Debate Agent D2wx:
To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes, we first need to consider the formation reactions and their equilibrium constants. The formation reactions for the complexes are: Co + SCN- -&gt; Co(SCN)+ with β1 = 9, Co + 2SCN- -&gt; Co(SCN)2 with β2 = 40, Co + 3SCN- -&gt; Co(SCN)3- with β3 = 63, and Co + 4SCN- -&gt; Co(SCN)42- with β4 = 16. We are interested in the dithiocyanato complex, Co(SCN)2, which corresponds to β2 = 40. The total concentration of cobalt is 10^-2 M and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. Using the stability constants, we calculate the concentration of each complex: [Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co] * [SCN-]^2. The percentage of Co(SCN)2 is then [Co(SCN)2] / (total cobalt concentration) * 100%.
