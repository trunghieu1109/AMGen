Question: Example(question='We have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate, where the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M and the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16. What will be the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species in the solution? ', choice1='16.9%', choice2='42.3%', choice3='25.6%', choice4='38.1%', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The problem involves calculating the percentage of the Co(SCN)2 complex among all cobalt-containing species in the solution. The stability constant β2 for Co(SCN)2 is 40, and the total cobalt concentration is 10^-2 M with [SCN-] = 0.1 M. The concentration of Co(SCN)2 is given by [Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co] * [SCN-]^2. The total concentration of cobalt species is the sum of all complexes and free Co^2+. The percentage of Co(SCN)2 is ([Co(SCN)2] / total [Co]) * 100%. After considering the calculations and the answers provided by the agents, the most consistent answer is 42.3%, which corresponds to choice B).
