Question: Example(question='An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. A spontaneous fission occurs in which it splits into two fragments (and nothing else), such that one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other (in terms of their rest-masses). The sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. \n\nKinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?\n\n(Ignore the electrons.)', choice1='10 MeV.', choice2='5 MeV.', choice3='2 MeV.', choice4='20 MeV.', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The problem involves a nucleus of rest mass energy 300 GeV splitting into two fragments with mass ratio 2:1, and the sum of their rest masses is 99% of the original mass, so 1% of the mass is converted into kinetic energy (3 GeV total). The fragments recoil with equal and opposite momentum. Calculating the kinetic energy of the heavier fragment relativistically and classically, the difference between these two values is on the order of a few MeV. Detailed calculations and approximations by multiple agents show the difference is approximately 5 MeV, which corresponds to choice B). Although one agent suggested 10 MeV, the majority and more precise calculations support 5 MeV as the difference.
