    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. A spontaneous fission occurs in which it splits into two fragments (and nothing else), such that one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other (in terms of their rest-masses). The sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. \n\nKinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?\n\n(Ignore the electrons.)&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;10 MeV.&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;5 MeV.&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;2 MeV.&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;20 MeV.&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent aich:
The initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus is 300 GeV. After fission, the rest-mass energy of the fragments is 99% of the initial, which is 297 GeV. The mass ratio of the fragments is 2:1. Let the less massive fragment have rest-mass energy E and the more massive fragment have rest-mass energy 2E. Then, E + 2E = 297 GeV, so E = 99 GeV and 2E = 198 GeV. The difference in mass-energy (300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV) is converted into kinetic energy of the fragments. In the center of mass frame, the kinetic energy is equally distributed between the two fragments due to conservation of momentum. The classical kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is calculated using its velocity from momentum conservation, while the relativistic kinetic energy is calculated using the relativistic energy-momentum relation. The difference between these two kinetic energy values for the more massive fragment is required.

### thinking by Debate Agent 56D6:
The initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus is 300 GeV. After the fission, the total rest-mass energy of the two fragments is 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV. The rest-mass of the more massive fragment is 2/3 of the total rest-mass energy of the fragments, and the less massive one is 1/3. So, their rest-mass energies are 198 GeV and 99 GeV, respectively. The total energy is conserved, so the kinetic energy released is 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV. The momentum of the two fragments must be equal and opposite because the initial momentum is zero. Using relativistic energy-momentum relation, the relativistic kinetic energy of the more massive fragment can be calculated. The classical approximation would assume kinetic energy proportional to velocity squared, which is less accurate at high velocities. The difference between the correct relativistic kinetic energy and the classical approximation is the answer.

### thinking by Debate Agent YWUl:
To solve this problem, we need to consider both the relativistic and classical approaches to calculate the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment. The initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus is 300 GeV, and after fission, the sum of the rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M, which implies that 1% of the mass is converted into kinetic energy. Thus, the total kinetic energy released is 0.01 * 300 GeV = 3 GeV. Let the rest mass of the smaller fragment be m, then the more massive fragment has a rest mass of 2m. The sum of the rest masses is 3m, which is 99% of M, so M = 3m/0.99. Using conservation of momentum, in the center of mass frame, the momentum of the two fragments is equal and opposite. Using the relativistic energy-momentum relation, we can find the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment. In the classical case, the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is calculated using the non-relativistic kinetic energy formula, T1_classical = (1/2)mv^2. The difference between the relativistic and classical kinetic energy values is the answer we are looking for. Solving this, we find that the difference is 10 MeV.

### thinking by Debate Agent IA6k:
First, we need to determine the rest masses of the fragments. Let the rest mass of the less massive fragment be m, then the more massive fragment is 2m. The sum of their rest masses is 3m, which is 99% of M. So, 3m = 0.99M, giving m = 0.33M. The more massive fragment is then 0.66M. The rest mass energy of the fragments is 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV. The kinetic energy released is 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV. In the center of mass frame, the kinetic energies of the fragments are inversely proportional to their masses. Let T1 be the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment and T2 be the kinetic energy of the less massive fragment. Then, T1/T2 = m/(2m) = 1/2. So, T1 + T2 = 3 GeV and T1 = (1/3) * 3 GeV = 1 GeV. The classical kinetic energy approximation would assume T1 = (1/2) * (0.66M) * v^2, where v is the velocity. In the relativistic case, T1 is slightly less due to relativistic effects. The difference between the classical and relativistic values can be estimated to be around 10 MeV.
