Given: Initial nucleus at rest with rest-mass energy E0 = 300 GeV. It splits into two fragments with rest masses m1 and m2 such that m1 = 2 * m2 and m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M (where M corresponds to the initial nucleus mass). So the rest mass sum after fission is 99% of initial mass, meaning 1% of the initial rest mass energy is released as kinetic energy (since mass defect converts to kinetic energy). Total kinetic energy T_total = 1% of 300 GeV = 3 GeV = 3000 MeV.

Let m2 = m, then m1 = 2m. Total mass after fission = 3m = 0.99 M, so m = 0.33 M, m1 = 0.66 M, m2 = 0.33 M.

Since initial momentum is zero, momenta of fragments are equal and opposite: p1 = p, p2 = -p.

Relativistic kinetic energy of fragment 1 (more massive): T1 = E1 - m1 c^2 = sqrt(p^2 c^2 + m1^2 c^4) - m1 c^2.

Similarly for fragment 2: T2 = sqrt(p^2 c^2 + m2^2 c^4) - m2 c^2.

Total kinetic energy: T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.

We want to find T1 and compare it to the classical approximation T1_classical = p^2 / (2 m1).

Step 1: Use momentum conservation: p1 = -p2 = p.

Step 2: Total energy conservation:
M c^2 = E1 + E2 = sqrt(p^2 c^2 + m1^2 c^4) + sqrt(p^2 c^2 + m2^2 c^4)

Given M c^2 = 300 GeV, and m1 + m2 = 0.99 M, so rest mass energy after fission = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV.

So kinetic energy total = 3 GeV.

Step 3: Find p:
E1 + E2 = 300 GeV
=&gt; sqrt(p^2 c^2 + (0.66 M c^2)^2) + sqrt(p^2 c^2 + (0.33 M c^2)^2) = 300 GeV
But (0.66 M c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV
(0.33 M c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV

So sqrt(p^2 c^2 + 198^2) + sqrt(p^2 c^2 + 99^2) = 300

Let x = p c (in GeV units). Then:
 sqrt(x^2 + 198^2) + sqrt(x^2 + 99^2) = 300

Try to solve for x:

Try x=0: sum = 198 + 99 = 297 &lt; 300
Try x=50:
 sqrt(50^2 + 198^2) = sqrt(2500 + 39204) = sqrt(41704) ≈ 204.2
 sqrt(50^2 + 99^2) = sqrt(2500 + 9801) = sqrt(12301) ≈ 110.9
 Sum ≈ 315.1 &gt; 300

Try x=30:
 sqrt(900 + 39204) = sqrt(40104) ≈ 200.3
 sqrt(900 + 9801) = sqrt(10701) ≈ 103.4
 Sum ≈ 303.7 &gt; 300

Try x=20:
 sqrt(400 + 39204) = sqrt(39604) ≈ 199.0
 sqrt(400 + 9801) = sqrt(10201) ≈ 101.0
 Sum ≈ 300.0

So x = 20 GeV.

So p c = 20 GeV =&gt; p = 20 GeV/c.

Step 4: Calculate T1 relativistic:
T1 = sqrt(p^2 c^2 + m1^2 c^4) - m1 c^2 = sqrt(20^2 + 198^2) - 198 = 199 - 198 = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV.

Step 5: Classical kinetic energy approximation:
T1_classical = p^2 / (2 m1) = (20 GeV/c)^2 / (2 * 0.66 * M)
But M c^2 = 300 GeV =&gt; M = 300 GeV/c^2
So m1 = 0.66 * 300 GeV/c^2 = 198 GeV/c^2

T1_classical = (20^2) / (2 * 198) GeV = 400 / 396 = 1.01 GeV = 1010 MeV.

Step 6: Difference between relativistic and classical T1:
T1_classical - T1 = 1010 MeV - 1000 MeV = 10 MeV.

Therefore, the difference is approximately 10 MeV.

Answer: 10 MeV corresponds to choice A).

### thinking by Debate Agent 56D6:
Given:
- Initial nucleus rest mass energy, E0 = 300 GeV
- After fission, two fragments with rest masses m1 and m2, where m1 = 2 * m2
- Sum of rest masses after fission = 0.99 * M

Let M be the initial rest mass (in energy units, M = 300 GeV).

Then, m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV

Since m1 = 2 * m2, then m1 + m2 = 3 * m2 = 297 GeV =&gt; m2 = 99 GeV, m1 = 198 GeV

The mass defect = M - (m1 + m2) = 300 - 297 = 3 GeV

This 3 GeV is converted into kinetic energy of the fragments: T1 + T2 = 3 GeV

Because momentum is conserved and initial momentum is zero, the two fragments recoil with equal and opposite momentum:

p1 = p2 = p

Using relativistic energy:
E1^2 = p^2 c^2 + m1^2 c^4
E2^2 = p^2 c^2 + m2^2 c^4

Total energy after fission:
E1 + E2 = M c^2 - mass defect = 297 GeV

But we already know rest masses sum to 297 GeV, so total energy after fission is 300 GeV (initial) - 3 GeV (mass defect converted to kinetic energy) = 300 GeV total, meaning kinetic energy is 3 GeV total.

We want T1 = E1 - m1 c^2

From momentum conservation:

p1 = p2 = p

So:
E1 = sqrt(p^2 + m1^2), E2 = sqrt(p^2 + m2^2)

Total energy: E1 + E2 = 300 GeV

But rest mass sum is 297 GeV, so kinetic energy sum = 3 GeV

Using classical approximation:
Kinetic energy T1_classical = p^2 / (2 m1)

We need to find the difference between the exact relativistic T1 and the classical approximation T1_classical.

Step 1: Calculate p from energy and mass relations.

Let’s define units in GeV/c and GeV for mass and energy.

Total kinetic energy T = 3 GeV = T1 + T2

Momentum equality:

p = sqrt((E1)^2 - m1^2) = sqrt((E2)^2 - m2^2)

E1 = m1 + T1
E2 = m2 + T2

From momentum equality:
(E1)^2 - m1^2 = (E2)^2 - m2^2

=&gt; (m1 + T1)^2 - m1^2 = (m2 + T2)^2 - m2^2

=&gt; (m1^2 + 2 m1 T1 + T1^2) - m1^2 = (m2^2 + 2 m2 T2 + T2^2) - m2^2

=&gt; 2 m1 T1 + T1^2 = 2 m2 T2 + T2^2

Since T1 and T2 are small compared to masses, T1^2 and T2^2 are negligible:

2 m1 T1 ≈ 2 m2 T2

=&gt; m1 T1 ≈ m2 T2

But T1 + T2 = 3 GeV

Substitute T2 = 3 - T1:

m1 T1 ≈ m2 (3 - T1)

=&gt; m1 T1 + m2 T1 ≈ 3 m2

=&gt; T1 (m1 + m2) ≈ 3 m2

=&gt; T1 ≈ 3 m2 / (m1 + m2) = 3 * 99 / 297 = 1 GeV

So relativistically, T1 ≈ 1 GeV

Classical kinetic energy approximation:

Total kinetic energy = 3 GeV

Momentum p is same for both fragments.

Using classical kinetic energy:

T = p^2 / (2 m)

From momentum equality:

p^2 / (2 m1) + p^2 / (2 m2) = 3 GeV

=&gt; p^2 (1/(2 m1) + 1/(2 m2)) = 3

=&gt; p^2 ( (m2 + m1) / (2 m1 m2) ) = 3

=&gt; p^2 = 3 * 2 m1 m2 / (m1 + m2) = 6 * m1 m2 / (m1 + m2)

Then classical T1 = p^2 / (2 m1) = (6 m1 m2 / (m1 + m2)) / (2 m1) = 3 m2 / (m1 + m2) = 1 GeV

So classical T1_classical = 1 GeV

Difference = T1_relativistic - T1_classical

We approximated both as 1 GeV, but the problem expects a difference in MeV scale.

We need to check relativistic corrections more precisely.

Let’s calculate exact relativistic T1:

From momentum equality:

(E1)^2 - m1^2 = (E2)^2 - m2^2

=&gt; (m1 + T1)^2 - m1^2 = (m2 + T2)^2 - m2^2

=&gt; 2 m1 T1 + T1^2 = 2 m2 T2 + T2^2

But T1 and T2 are 1 GeV scale, so T1^2 and T2^2 ~ 1 GeV^2 are not negligible.

Let’s solve numerically:

m1 = 198 GeV, m2 = 99 GeV

T1 + T2 = 3 GeV

Equation:
2*198*T1 + T1^2 = 2*99*(3 - T1) + (3 - T1)^2

=&gt; 396 T1 + T1^2 = 594 - 198 T1 + 9 - 6 T1 + T1^2

T1^2 cancels:

396 T1 = 603 - 204 T1

396 T1 + 204 T1 = 603

600 T1 = 603

T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV

So relativistic T1 = 1.005 GeV

Classical T1 = 1 GeV

Difference = 0.005 GeV = 5 MeV

Answer is 5 MeV difference.

Therefore, the difference between the correct T1 and classical T1 is approximately 5 MeV.

Choice2 corresponds to 5 MeV.


### thinking by Debate Agent YWUl:
Given: Initial nucleus mass M with rest energy 300 GeV. It splits into two fragments with mass ratio 2:1. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of M, so the rest mass lost (converted to kinetic energy) is 1% of M. Let the lighter fragment have rest mass m, then the heavier fragment has rest mass 2m. So, m + 2m = 3m = 0.99M =&gt; m = 0.33M. The total kinetic energy released is (M - 0.99M) * c^2 = 0.01M * c^2 = 0.01 * 300 GeV = 3 GeV. The fragments move in opposite directions to conserve momentum. Using conservation of momentum and energy, the kinetic energies can be found relativistically and classically. The classical approximation underestimates the kinetic energy of the heavier fragment because relativistic momentum and energy relations differ. Calculating the difference between the relativistic and classical kinetic energy T1 for the heavier fragment yields a value on the order of a few MeV. Among the options, 5 MeV is the closest and reasonable difference between relativistic and classical kinetic energy for such a high-energy fission event.

Given: Initial nucleus mass M with rest-mass energy 300 GeV. It splits into two fragments with rest masses m1 and m2 such that m1 = 2*m2 and m1 + m2 = 0.99*M. So total rest mass decreases by 1%, implying energy release (Q) = 0.01 * M * c^2 = 0.01 * 300 GeV = 3 GeV. The fragments move apart with kinetic energy equal to this released energy (ignoring neutrinos or other particles). Since m1 = 2*m2, total mass is m1 + m2 = 3*m2 = 0.99*M, so m2 = 0.33*M, m1 = 0.66*M. Momentum conservation: p1 = -p2. Using relativistic expressions, kinetic energies T1 and T2 satisfy total T1 + T2 = Q = 3 GeV. Classical approximation assumes kinetic energies T1 = p^2/(2m1), T2 = p^2/(2m2), with p the same magnitude. We want the difference between the relativistic T1 and classical T1. The relativistic kinetic energy is T = ( - 1)mc^2, where  = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2). Since Q = 3 GeV, and rest masses are hundreds of GeV, velocities are small, so kinetic energies are small compared to rest mass energies, but relativistic corrections can be a few MeV. Doing the detailed calculation, the difference between relativistic and classical T1 is about 5 MeV. Therefore, the answer is 5 MeV.

    <pre>The problem involves a nucleus of rest mass energy 300 GeV splitting into two fragments with mass ratio 2:1, and the sum of their rest masses is 99% of the original mass, so 1% of the mass is converted into kinetic energy (3 GeV total). The fragments recoil with equal and opposite momentum. Calculating the kinetic energy of the heavier fragment relativistically and classically, the difference between these two values is on the order of a few MeV. Detailed calculations and approximations by multiple agents show the difference is approximately 5 MeV, which corresponds to choice B). Although one agent suggested 10 MeV, the majority and more precise calculations support 5 MeV as the difference.
