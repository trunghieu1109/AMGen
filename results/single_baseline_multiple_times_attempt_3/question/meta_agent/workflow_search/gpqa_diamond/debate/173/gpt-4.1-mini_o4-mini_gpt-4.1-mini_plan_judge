Question: Example(question='An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. A spontaneous fission occurs in which it splits into two fragments (and nothing else), such that one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other (in terms of their rest-masses). The sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. \n\nKinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?\n\n(Ignore the electrons.)', choice1='10 MeV.', choice2='5 MeV.', choice3='2 MeV.', choice4='20 MeV.', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: We have M c²=300 GeV. Fragments: m1=2m2, m1+m2=0.99M ⇒ m1=198 GeV, m2=99 GeV. Mass defect Q=0.01M c²=3 GeV → T1+T2=3 GeV. Non‐relativistic share: T1_cl=Q·m2/(m1+m2)=3·(99/297)=1.000 GeV. Exact relativistic momentum p c=√[(300²–297²)(300²–99²)]/(2·300)≈19.975 GeV, so T1_rel=√(198²+19.975²)–198≈1.006 GeV. Difference ≈0.006 GeV≈6 MeV, closest choice is 5 MeV.
