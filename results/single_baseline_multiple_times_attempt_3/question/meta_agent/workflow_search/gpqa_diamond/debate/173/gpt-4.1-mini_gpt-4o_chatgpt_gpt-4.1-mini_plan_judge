Question: Example(question='An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. A spontaneous fission occurs in which it splits into two fragments (and nothing else), such that one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other (in terms of their rest-masses). The sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. \n\nKinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?\n\n(Ignore the electrons.)', choice1='10 MeV.', choice2='5 MeV.', choice3='2 MeV.', choice4='20 MeV.', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus is 300 GeV. After fission, the rest-mass energy of the fragments is 99% of the initial, which is 297 GeV. The mass ratio of the fragments is 2:1. Let the less massive fragment have rest-mass energy E and the more massive fragment have rest-mass energy 2E. Then, E + 2E = 297 GeV, so E = 99 GeV and 2E = 198 GeV. The difference in mass-energy (300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV) is converted into kinetic energy of the fragments. In the center of mass frame, the kinetic energy is equally distributed between the two fragments due to conservation of momentum. The classical kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is calculated using its velocity from momentum conservation, while the relativistic kinetic energy is calculated using the relativistic energy-momentum relation. The difference between these two kinetic energy values for the more massive fragment is required. All agents agree that the difference is 10 MeV.
