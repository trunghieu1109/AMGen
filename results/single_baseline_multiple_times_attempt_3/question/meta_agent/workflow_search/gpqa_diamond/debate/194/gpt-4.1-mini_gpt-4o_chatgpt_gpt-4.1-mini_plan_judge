Question: Example(question='Astronomers are observing a planet with a radius of 1 Earth radius in a circular orbit, with a transit impact parameter of 0.2, around a star that has a radius 1.5 times that of the Sun. This planet has an orbital period of 3 days. What is the maximum orbital period of a second planet, with a radius of 2.5 times that of Earth, in the same system that will exhibit both transit and occultation events? Assume that the second planet also has a circular orbit and shares the same orbital plane as the previously mentioned transiting planet.', choice1='~ 7.5', choice2='~ 33.5', choice3='~ 37.5', choice4='~ 12.5', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The problem involves determining the maximum orbital period of a second planet that can still exhibit both transit and occultation events. The first planet has a known orbital period of 3 days and a transit impact parameter of 0.2. The second planet is larger, with a radius of 2.5 Earth radii, and must also transit and be occulted. The key is to use the impact parameter and the star's radius to determine the maximum allowable semi-major axis for the second planet's orbit, which will give us the maximum period using Kepler's third law. The star's radius is 1.5 times that of the Sun, and the second planet's larger size allows for a slightly larger impact parameter while still ensuring transits and occultations. The calculations suggest that the maximum period is around 12.5 days, as the larger planet can have a slightly larger orbit while still meeting the conditions for both events.
