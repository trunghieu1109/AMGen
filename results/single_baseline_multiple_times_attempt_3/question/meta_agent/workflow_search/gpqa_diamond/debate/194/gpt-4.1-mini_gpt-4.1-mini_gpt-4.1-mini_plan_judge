Question: Example(question='Astronomers are observing a planet with a radius of 1 Earth radius in a circular orbit, with a transit impact parameter of 0.2, around a star that has a radius 1.5 times that of the Sun. This planet has an orbital period of 3 days. What is the maximum orbital period of a second planet, with a radius of 2.5 times that of Earth, in the same system that will exhibit both transit and occultation events? Assume that the second planet also has a circular orbit and shares the same orbital plane as the previously mentioned transiting planet.', choice1='~ 7.5', choice2='~ 33.5', choice3='~ 37.5', choice4='~ 12.5', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The problem requires finding the maximum orbital period of a second planet in the same system that will exhibit both transit and occultation events. Given the first planet's parameters and the star's radius, we use the impact parameter relation b = (a / R_star) * cos(i), where inclination i is the same for both planets. From the first planet's impact parameter (0.2), we find cos(i). For the second planet, the maximum impact parameter for both transit and occultation is approximately 1 (adjusted slightly for planet radius). Using this, we find the maximum semi-major axis ratio a2/a1, then apply Kepler's third law to find the maximum orbital period P2. Calculations show P2 is approximately 33.5 days, matching choice B).
