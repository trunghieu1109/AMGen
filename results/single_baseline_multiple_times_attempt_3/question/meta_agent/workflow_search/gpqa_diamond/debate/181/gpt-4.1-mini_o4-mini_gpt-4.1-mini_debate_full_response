That matches statement A.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent vYeA:\nThe Mott–Gurney law is derived for space-charge-limited current in a trap-free single-carrier device with ohmic (i.e., no injection barrier) contacts and drift-dominated transport (negligible diffusion). Thus statement 1 exactly matches these conditions.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent vBZF:\nThe Mott–Gurney law assumes a trap-free single-carrier semiconductor, with barrier-free (Ohmic) injection so that space-charge limited drift current dominates and diffusion is negligible. That corresponds exactly to choice 1.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent 91ht:\nThe Mott–Gurney law applies under space-charge-limited conditions: a trap-free, single-carrier device with ideal (Ohmic) injection (no barrier) and negligible diffusion. Choices 2–4 introduce either a barrier, diffusion, or multiple carriers. Only choice 1 matches all requirements.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent DIHY:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent vYeA:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent vBZF:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 91ht:\nA)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
