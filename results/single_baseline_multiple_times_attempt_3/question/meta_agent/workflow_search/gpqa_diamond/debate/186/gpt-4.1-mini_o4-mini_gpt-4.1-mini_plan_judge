Question: Example(question='How many of the stars listed below would be detectable using the ESPRESSO spectrograph, when it is coupled with one of the 8m VLT telescopes at the Paranal Observatory? A star is considered detectable if a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure is achieved.\n\nFor more details about the ESPRESSO spectrograph, please refer to the following link:\nhttps://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/instruments/espresso/overview.html\n\na) Canopus\nb) Polaris\nc) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 10 pc distance from us.\nd) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 200 pc distance from us.\ne) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 5 pc distance from us.\nf) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 50 pc distance from us.', choice1='4', choice2='3', choice3='2', choice4='5', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: First, estimate the faintest V magnitude ESPRESSO on one 8 m UT can reach at S/N≈10 in 1 h: about V≈16.3. Now compute apparent magnitudes:
– Canopus: V≈–0.7 → detectable.
– Polaris: V≈2.0 → detectable.
– M_V=15 star at 10 pc: m=15 → detectable.
– M_V=15 at 200 pc: m≈21.5 → too faint.
– M_V=15 at 5 pc: m≈13.5 → detectable.
– M_V=15 at 50 pc: m≈18.5 → too faint.
Thus four stars (a, b, c, e) are detectable.
