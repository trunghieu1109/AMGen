Question: Example(question='Which of the following issues are the most common sources of difficult-to-spot erroneous results generated in genomics data analysis:\n\n- Mutually incompatible data formats\n- The "chr" / "no chr" confusion\n- Reference assembly mismatch\n- Incorrect ID conversion', choice1='3 and 4', choice2='2 and 3', choice3='All of the above', choice4='2, 3 and 4', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: All the debate agents have evaluated the issues listed in the question and concluded that each of them can lead to difficult-to-spot erroneous results in genomics data analysis. The issues include mutually incompatible data formats, the 'chr' / 'no chr' confusion, reference assembly mismatch, and incorrect ID conversion. Each of these issues is common and can independently cause errors in genomics analysis. Therefore, the choice that includes all these issues is the most accurate. All agents agree that the correct answer is the one that includes all of the above issues.
