Question: Example(question='Which of the following issues are the most common sources of difficult-to-spot erroneous results generated in genomics data analysis:\n\n- Mutually incompatible data formats\n- The "chr" / "no chr" confusion\n- Reference assembly mismatch\n- Incorrect ID conversion', choice1='3 and 4', choice2='2 and 3', choice3='All of the above', choice4='2, 3 and 4', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: Mutually incompatible data formats often cause errors that are easier to detect because data may fail to load or process correctly. The 'chr' / 'no chr' confusion, reference assembly mismatch, and incorrect ID conversion are subtle issues that can lead to difficult-to-spot erroneous results in genomics data analysis. These three issues are commonly recognized as the main sources of such errors. Therefore, the best choice is the one that includes 2, 3, and 4.
