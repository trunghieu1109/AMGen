Question: Example(question='Which of the following issues are the most common sources of difficult-to-spot erroneous results generated in genomics data analysis:\n\n- Mutually incompatible data formats\n- The "chr" / "no chr" confusion\n- Reference assembly mismatch\n- Incorrect ID conversion', choice1='3 and 4', choice2='2 and 3', choice3='All of the above', choice4='2, 3 and 4', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: While incompatible data formats often surface errors immediately, subtle differences—like coordinate conventions (0-based vs 1-based), chromosome naming conventions (‘chr’ vs no ‘chr’), genome build mismatches, and gene/ID conversion mistakes—all can silently misalign or mislabel data, leading to hard-to-spot errors. Hence, all listed issues are common culprits.
