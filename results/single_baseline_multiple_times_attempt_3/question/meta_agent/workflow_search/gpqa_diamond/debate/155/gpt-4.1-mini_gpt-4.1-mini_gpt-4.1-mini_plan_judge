Question: Example(question='A chemist performs two reactions:\n\nReaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. \n\nReaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.\n\nBoth reactions go to 100% completion. The chemist combines the products of both reactions, and then runs the product mixture on both a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column and a chiral HPLC column.\n\nAssuming that the chromatographic resolution is as high as theoretically possible in both cases, what does the chemist observe in each of these chromatograms?', choice1='4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', choice2='3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice3='2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice4='2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The reaction of (E)- and (Z)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA forms epoxides with stereochemistry dependent on the alkene geometry: (E)-alkene gives trans-epoxide enantiomers, and (Z)-alkene gives cis-epoxide enantiomers. Each set is a pair of enantiomers, so there are two pairs of enantiomers total (4 stereoisomers). On a standard (achiral) HPLC column, enantiomers co-elute, so each pair appears as one peak, resulting in 2 peaks (one for each diastereomeric pair). On a chiral HPLC column, enantiomers are separated, so each pair splits into two peaks, resulting in 4 peaks total. Therefore, the chemist observes 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC.
