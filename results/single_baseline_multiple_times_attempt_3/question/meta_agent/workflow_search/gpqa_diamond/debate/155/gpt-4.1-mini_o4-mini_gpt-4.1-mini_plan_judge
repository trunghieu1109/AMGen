Question: Example(question='A chemist performs two reactions:\n\nReaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. \n\nReaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.\n\nBoth reactions go to 100% completion. The chemist combines the products of both reactions, and then runs the product mixture on both a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column and a chiral HPLC column.\n\nAssuming that the chromatographic resolution is as high as theoretically possible in both cases, what does the chemist observe in each of these chromatograms?', choice1='4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', choice2='3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice3='2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice4='2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: Epoxidation of (E)-oct-4-ene gives the trans epoxide, which is chiral and formed as a racemic mixture; after acid opening, this yields a racemic pair of anti diols (R,R and S,S). Epoxidation of (Z)-oct-4-ene gives the cis epoxide, which is achiral (meso); after opening, it gives the meso anti diol. The combined mixture has three stereoisomers: one meso and one enantiomeric pair. On a standard (achiral) HPLC enantiomers coelute, giving two peaks (meso vs racemate). On a chiral column the enantiomers separate, giving three peaks.
