    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;A chemist performs two reactions:\n\nReaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. \n\nReaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.\n\nBoth reactions go to 100% completion. The chemist combines the products of both reactions, and then runs the product mixture on both a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column and a chiral HPLC column.\n\nAssuming that the chromatographic resolution is as high as theoretically possible in both cases, what does the chemist observe in each of these chromatograms?&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent xMjR:
The key is that oct-4-ene is symmetrical (R1=R2 on both sides). Epoxidation of (E) gives the trans-epoxide as a racemic pair; epoxidation of (Z) gives the cis-epoxide as a single meso compound. Acidic opening preserves the meso or racemate character: the meso epoxide → meso diol (one achiral species) and the racemic epoxide → racemic diol (one enantiomeric pair). On an achiral column enantiomers coelute, so you see 2 peaks (meso + racemate); on a chiral column the racemate splits into 2, but the meso stays 1 → total 3 peaks.

### thinking by Debate Agent xKiP:
Epoxidation of E‐alkene gives trans epoxide (racemic, since trans epoxide is chiral), which upon acidic opening (anti addition) gives the syn diol (two OH on same side) as a racemic pair (R,R and S,S). Epoxidation of Z‐alkene gives cis epoxide (meso, achiral), which opens to the anti diol (OH on opposite sides) – the meso diol (R,S). So in the combined mixture there are three stereoisomers: a meso diol and a racemic enantiomer pair. On an achiral HPLC column the enantiomers coelute, giving two peaks (meso vs enantiomeric pair). On a chiral column the enantiomers separate, giving three distinct peaks.

### thinking by Debate Agent vDzD:
Epoxidation + acid gives anti diol. Anti dihydroxylation of trans (E) alkenes gives the meso diol (achiral, one compound); of cis (Z) alkenes gives the racemic pair (two enantiomers). Combined: three stereoisomers (one meso + two enantiomers). On achiral RP‐HPLC the enantiomers coelute, so two peaks (meso vs racemate); on a chiral column all three separate, so three peaks.

### thinking by Debate Agent RtOd:
Epoxidation followed by acid gives anti dihydroxylation. From (E)- (trans) oct-4-ene we get the meso diol (achiral). From (Z)- (cis) oct-4-ene we get the racemic pair of enantiomeric diols. Combining: three stereoisomers total. On an achiral (standard) HPLC, enantiomers coelute, so you see two peaks (one for meso, one for racemate). On a chiral HPLC, the enantiomers separate, so you see three peaks (one meso, two enantiomers).

    <pre>Epoxidation of (E)-oct-4-ene gives the trans epoxide, which is chiral and formed as a racemic mixture; after acid opening, this yields a racemic pair of anti diols (R,R and S,S). Epoxidation of (Z)-oct-4-ene gives the cis epoxide, which is achiral (meso); after opening, it gives the meso anti diol. The combined mixture has three stereoisomers: one meso and one enantiomeric pair. On a standard (achiral) HPLC enantiomers coelute, giving two peaks (meso vs racemate). On a chiral column the enantiomers separate, giving three peaks.
