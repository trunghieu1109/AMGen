Question: Example(question='3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one is treated with sodium hydride, followed by benzyl bromide, forming product 1.\n\n1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide in the presence of a catalytic amount of HCl, forming product 2.\n\n2 is treated at low temperature with n-butyllithium, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride, forming product 3.\n\n3 is stirred with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere, forming product 4.\n\nWhat is the structure of product 4?', choice1='(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol', choice2="N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide", choice3='(((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene', choice4='3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The sequence benzylates the hydroxymethyl, forms a tosylhydrazone at the ketone, and undergoes a Shapiro elimination to give an alkene. Catalytic hydrogenation saturates both the ring and exocyclic double bonds and cleaves the benzyl ether, regenerating the CH₂OH and converting the prop-1-en-2-yl to isopropyl. The result is cyclohexane with a CH₂OH at one carbon and an isopropyl at the 3-position: (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.
