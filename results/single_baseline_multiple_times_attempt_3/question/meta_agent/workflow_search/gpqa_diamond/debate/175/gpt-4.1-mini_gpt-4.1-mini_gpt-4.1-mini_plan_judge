Question: Example(question='The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1), and the operators of two observables P and Q of the system are represented by two square matrices. The matrix corresponding to operator P has the elements in first row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0), elements in the second row as (1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}) and that in third row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0). The matrix operator for Q is represented by the square matrix having elements in the first row as (1, 0, 0), second row as (0, 0, 0) and third row as (0, 0, -1). Now, if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P, what is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements?', choice1='1/2', choice2='1/6', choice3='1/3', choice4='2/3', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The problem involves measuring two observables P and Q sequentially on a quantum system initially in state |ψ⟩ = (-1, 2, 1). The operator P has eigenvalues 1, 0, -1, and we are interested in the eigenvalue 0. The eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0 of P is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2). The probability of measuring 0 for P is the squared modulus of the projection of |ψ⟩ onto this eigenvector, normalized by the norm of |ψ⟩. Normalizing |ψ⟩ gives norm sqrt(6). The projection amplitude is -1/√3, so the probability is 1/3. After measuring P=0, the state collapses to the eigenvector (1/√2, 0, -1/√2). Next, measuring Q, which has eigenvalues 1, 0, -1 with eigenvectors (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1), the probability of measuring -1 is the squared modulus of the projection of the collapsed state onto (0,0,1), which is (1/√2)^2 = 1/2. The combined probability is the product: (1/3)*(1/2) = 1/6. This matches choice B).
