Question: Example(question='The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1), and the operators of two observables P and Q of the system are represented by two square matrices. The matrix corresponding to operator P has the elements in first row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0), elements in the second row as (1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}) and that in third row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0). The matrix operator for Q is represented by the square matrix having elements in the first row as (1, 0, 0), second row as (0, 0, 0) and third row as (0, 0, -1). Now, if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P, what is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements?', choice1='1/2', choice2='1/6', choice3='1/3', choice4='2/3', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The problem involves calculating the probability of obtaining specific measurement outcomes for two observables P and Q, represented by matrices, given an initial state vector. The process involves finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrices, projecting the state vector onto the eigenvectors, and calculating the probabilities. All agents agree that the probability of measuring 0 for P and -1 for Q is 1/6, which corresponds to choice B).
