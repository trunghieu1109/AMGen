    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;There has been an outbreak of an viral infectious disease in your city. You have been asked to design a molecular diagnostic kit for quick detection of this retrovirus. How would you go about designing this kit?&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;First you identify the virus by performing DNA sequencing. You then develop a PCR kit for  quick and accurate diagnosis&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;First you identify the IgG antibodies for the infection. You then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG antibodies for quick \n and accurate diagnosis.&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;First you identify the virus using the information about the symptoms, provided by the affected patients. You then design a nested PCR kit based on the information for quick diagnosis.&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;First you identify the virus by performing cDNA sequencing.  You then develop a real time PCR kit for quick and accurate diagnosis.&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent bD3a:
Retroviruses have RNA genomes, so we first generate cDNA and sequence it to design specific primers. Real-time PCR (RT-PCR) provides rapid, sensitive, and quantitative detection, making it the optimal molecular diagnostic approach. Nested PCR is slower and prone to contamination, antibody detection is too slow for early diagnosis, and direct DNA sequencing ignores the RNA genome.

### thinking by Debate Agent Ge1Q:
To detect a retrovirus (an RNA virus) you must first reverse-transcribe its RNA to cDNA for sequencing. Once you know the viral genome, you can design primers and develop a sensitive, rapid real-time (quantitative) PCR assay. Options A and C assume DNA sequencing or symptom-based primer design, which ignores the need to reverse-transcribe RNA. Option B targets IgG antibodies, which appear late, delaying diagnosis. Hence option D is correct.

### thinking by Debate Agent UPac:
Retroviruses have RNA genomes, so initial identification requires reverse transcription to cDNA and sequencing to characterize the virus. With that sequence data, specific primers and probes can be designed for a real-time PCR assay, providing rapid and sensitive detection. Options relying on DNA sequencing without cDNA, serology (IgG), or symptom-based primer design are less appropriate for quick, molecular-level diagnosis of a retrovirus.

### thinking by Debate Agent M92R:
Retroviruses have RNA genomes, so molecular diagnostics require reverse transcription to cDNA. While antibody-based ELISA (choice B) detects immune response rather than the virus itself and is slower, and nested PCR (choice C) lacks initial viral sequence confirmation, and DNA sequencing (choice A) isnâ€™t applicable for an RNA virus. The proper approach is to perform cDNA sequencing from viral RNA to identify specific sequences, then design a real-time PCR assay for rapid, sensitive, and specific detection.

Based on that sequence data, you can design primers and probes for a sensitive and rapid real-time PCR assay, which is the most appropriate molecular diagnostic method for quick and accurate detection of a retrovirus.
