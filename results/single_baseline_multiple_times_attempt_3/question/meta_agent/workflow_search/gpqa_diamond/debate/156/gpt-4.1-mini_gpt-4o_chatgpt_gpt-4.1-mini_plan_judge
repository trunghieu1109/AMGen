Question: Example(question='There has been an outbreak of an viral infectious disease in your city. You have been asked to design a molecular diagnostic kit for quick detection of this retrovirus. How would you go about designing this kit?', choice1='First you identify the virus by performing DNA sequencing. You then develop a PCR kit for  quick and accurate diagnosis', choice2='First you identify the IgG antibodies for the infection. You then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG antibodies for quick \n and accurate diagnosis.', choice3='First you identify the virus using the information about the symptoms, provided by the affected patients. You then design a nested PCR kit based on the information for quick diagnosis.', choice4='First you identify the virus by performing cDNA sequencing.  You then develop a real time PCR kit for quick and accurate diagnosis.', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: All agents agree that the most appropriate method for designing a molecular diagnostic kit for a retrovirus involves identifying the virus's genetic material. Retroviruses have RNA genomes, which need to be reverse transcribed into cDNA for sequencing. Once the viral sequence is identified, a real-time PCR kit can be developed for rapid and accurate detection. This approach is more direct and reliable than antibody detection, which may not be present in early infection stages. Therefore, the choice that involves cDNA sequencing followed by the development of a real-time PCR kit is the most suitable.
