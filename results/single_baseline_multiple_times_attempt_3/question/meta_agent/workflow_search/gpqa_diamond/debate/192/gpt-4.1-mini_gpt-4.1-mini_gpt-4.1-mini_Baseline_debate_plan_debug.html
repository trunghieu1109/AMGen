    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;In a specific region of the sky, astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;~ r^2&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;~ r^4&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;~ r^3&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;~ r^5&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent 79YQ:
Given that the number of stars varies with parallax (plx) as 1/plx^5. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance (r), i.e., plx ~ 1/r. Therefore, plx^5 ~ 1/r^5, so 1/plx^5 ~ r^5. Hence, the number of stars varies as r^5 with distance. Thus, the number of stars per unit range of distance r is proportional to r^5.

### thinking by Debate Agent jaKR:
Given that the number of stars varies with parallax (plx) as 1/plx^5, and knowing that parallax is inversely proportional to distance (r), i.e., plx ~ 1/r, we can substitute plx with 1/r. Therefore, the number of stars varies as 1/(1/r)^5 = r^5. Hence, the number of stars per unit range of distance r varies as r^5.

### thinking by Debate Agent 6GRO:
The parallax p is inversely proportional to the distance r, i.e., p = 1/r. Given that the number of stars varies as 1/p^5, substitute p = 1/r to get number of stars ~ 1/(1/r)^5 = r^5. Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance r varies as r^5.

### thinking by Debate Agent mN8g:
Given that the number of stars varies with parallax (plx) as 1/plx^5, and knowing that parallax is inversely proportional to distance (r), i.e., plx = 1/r, we can substitute plx = 1/r into the expression. This gives the number of stars as proportional to 1/(1/r)^5 = r^5. Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance r varies as r^5.
