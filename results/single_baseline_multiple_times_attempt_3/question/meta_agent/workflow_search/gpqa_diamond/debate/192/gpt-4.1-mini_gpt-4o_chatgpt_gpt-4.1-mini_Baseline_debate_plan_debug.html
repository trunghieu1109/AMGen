    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;In a specific region of the sky, astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;~ r^2&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;~ r^4&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;~ r^3&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;~ r^5&#39;}

### thinking by Debate Agent 9YQj:
Parallax (plx) is inversely related to distance (r), as plx = 1/r. Therefore, if the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5, it can be rewritten as (1/(1/r)^5) = r^5. Thus, the number of stars varies with distance as r^5.

### thinking by Debate Agent aKR6:
Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance (r), i.e., plx ‚àù 1/r. Given that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5, we can substitute plx = 1/r into this relationship. Thus, the number of stars varies as (1/(1/r)^5) = r^5. Therefore, the number of stars changes with distance as r^5.

### thinking by Debate Agent GROm:
Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance (r), meaning plx = 1/r. The number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5, which implies it varies with (1/(1/r)^5) = r^5. Therefore, the number of stars changes with distance as r^5.

### thinking by Debate Agent N8gQ:
Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance (r), i.e., plx ~ 1/r. Given that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5, we can substitute plx ~ 1/r into this relationship. Therefore, the number of stars varies as 1/(1/r)^5 = r^5. Thus, the number of stars changes with distance as ~ r^5.

    <pre>The parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to the distance (r), meaning plx = 1/r. The problem states that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. Substituting plx = 1/r into this relationship gives us 1/(1/r)^5 = r^5. Therefore, the number of stars varies with distance as r^5. All agents agree on this reasoning, and the correct choice is D) ~ r^5.
