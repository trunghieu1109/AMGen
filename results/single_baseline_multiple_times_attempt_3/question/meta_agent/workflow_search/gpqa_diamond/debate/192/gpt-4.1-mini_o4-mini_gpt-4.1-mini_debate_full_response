With parallax p = 1/r, dp/dr = -1/r^2, so |dN/dr| ∝ p^(-5)·(1/r^2) = (r^5)·(1/r^2) = r^3.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent aKR6:\nWe have dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since parallax plx ∝ 1/r, we get dN/d(plx) ∝ r^5. To find number per unit distance, compute dN/dr = (dN/d(plx))*(d(plx)/dr). Because plx = k/r, d(plx)/dr ∝ -1/r^2, so |dN/dr| ∝ r^5*(1/r^2) = r^3.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent GROm:\nLet parallax p ∝ 1/r. Given dN/dp ∝ 1/p^5. We want dN/dr = (dN/dp)·|dp/dr|. Since p=k/r, |dp/dr|=k/r^2 and 1/p^5=(r^5/k^5). Thus dN/dr ∝ (r^5/k^5)·(k/r^2)=r^3/k^4∝r^3.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent N8gQ:\nWe have dN/d(plx) ∝ plx^(–5). Since plx ∝ 1/r, plx = 1/r ⇒ d(plx)/dr = –1/r^2 = –plx^2. Then dN/dr = (dN/d(plx))·|d(plx)/dr| ∝ plx^(–5)·plx^2 = plx^(–3) ∝ (1/r)^(–3) = r^3. So number per unit distance ∝ r^3, i.e. choice C).\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 9YQj:\nC)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent aKR6:\nC)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent GROm:\nC)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent N8gQ:\nC)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
