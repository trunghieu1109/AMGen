For system_1: K_sum=15\u2009km/s, P=2\u2009yr; system_2: K_sum=25\u2009km/s, P=1\u2009yr. Ratio=(15^3·2)/(25^3·1)=6750/15625≈0.43≈0.4.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent TOTF:\nWe model each binary as circular and edge-on. The observed RV amplitudes K1,K2 give the stellar orbital radii a1,a2 via a1=K1P/(2π), a2=K2P/(2π). The total separation a=a1+a2 so that total mass M_tot=4π^2a^3/(GP^2). Combining yields M_tot∝(K1+K2)^3P. Thus the mass ratio\nM1/M2 = [(K1+K2)_1^3 P1]/[(K1+K2)_2^3 P2] = (15^3·2)/(25^3·1)=6750/15625≈0.43≈0.4.\nTherefore choice A) is correct.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent 1hOh:\nFor binary stars with circular, edge‐on orbits, the total mass M∝(K1+K2)^3P. \nSystem₁: K₁+K₂=10+5=15\u2009km/s, P=2\u2009yr ⇒ M₁∝15^3×2=3375×2=6750\nSystem₂: K₁+K₂=15+10=25\u2009km/s, P=1\u2009yr ⇒ M₂∝25^3×1=15625\nRatio M₁/M₂=6750/15625≈0.432≈0.4 → choice A)\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent TwPR:\nWe want the ratio of total masses M1/M2. For each binary, from RV amplitudes K1,K2 and period P we get total semimajor axis a = (P/2π)(K1+K2). By Kepler: M_tot∝a^3/P^2. So ratio R=(a1^3/P1^2)/(a2^3/P2^2) = [(P1(K1+K2))^3/P1^2]/[(P2(K1'+K2'))^3/P2^2]·(1/(2π))^3 cancels to R=(P1/P2)*( (K1+K2)/(K1'+K2') )^3. For system1: P1=2\u2009yr, sum K=10+5=15. System2: P2=1\u2009yr, sum K=15+10=25. So R=2*(15/25)^3=2*(0.6)^3=2*0.216=0.432≈0.4.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent gTpr:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent TOTF:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 1hOh:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent TwPR:\nA)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
