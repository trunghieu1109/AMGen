Question: Example(question='Astronomers are studying two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2. Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.', choice1='~ 0.4', choice2='~ 0.7', choice3='~ 0.6\n', choice4='~ 1.2', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: All agents agree that the mass of a binary star system can be estimated using Kepler's third law and the radial velocity amplitudes. The mass function is proportional to the cube of the sum of the radial velocity amplitudes divided by the period. For system_1, the period is 2 years and the radial velocity amplitudes are 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, the period is 1 year and the amplitudes are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. The ratio of the masses of the systems can be approximated by the ratio of (P1 * (K1_1 + K2_1)^3) / (P2 * (K1_2 + K2_2)^3). Calculating this gives (2 * 15^3) / (1 * 25^3) = 6750 / 15625 â‰ˆ 0.432, which is closest to choice A) ~ 0.4. Therefore, system_1 is approximately 0.4 times as massive as system_2.
