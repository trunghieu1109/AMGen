Question: Example(question='Astronomers are studying two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2. Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.', choice1='~ 0.4', choice2='~ 0.7', choice3='~ 0.6\n', choice4='~ 1.2', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The total mass of a binary star system can be estimated using the orbital period and the sum of the radial velocity amplitudes of the two stars. The formula for total mass (ignoring constants and assuming similar inclination) is proportional to P * (K1 + K2)^3. For system_1, P1 = 2 years and K1 + K2 = 15 km/s, so mass ∝ 2 * 15^3 = 6750. For system_2, P2 = 1 year and K1 + K2 = 25 km/s, so mass ∝ 1 * 25^3 = 15625. The ratio of masses M1 / M2 = 6750 / 15625 ≈ 0.432, which is approximately 0.4. Therefore, system_1 is about 0.4 times as massive as system_2.
