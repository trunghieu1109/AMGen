Question: Example(question='Astronomers are studying two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2. Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.', choice1='~ 0.4', choice2='~ 0.7', choice3='~ 0.6\n', choice4='~ 1.2', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: Using circular, edge‐on orbits and Kepler’s third law, total mass M ∝ (K1+K2)^3·P. For system1: K_sum=10+5=15 km/s, P=2 yr ⇒ M1∝15^3×2=6750. For system2: K_sum=15+10=25 km/s, P=1 yr ⇒ M2∝25^3×1=15625. Ratio M1/M2=6750/15625≈0.432≈0.4.
