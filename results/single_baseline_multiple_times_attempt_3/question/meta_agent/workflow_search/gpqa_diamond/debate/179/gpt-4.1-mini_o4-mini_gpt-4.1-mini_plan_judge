Question: Example(question='Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are\nconstrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system\ncorrect to three decimals?', choice1='2.822 x 10^-26', choice2='5.645 x 10^-26', choice3='7.056 x 10^-27', choice4='122.330', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: Compute total electrostatic energy U = k·q^2·Σ1/r_ij. Here q=2e=3.204×10^-19 C, k=8.988×10^9 N·m^2/C^2. Twelve charges on a sphere of radius R=2 m arrange as an icosahedron (Thomson problem). Sum over outer–outer pairs gives Σ_shell–shell 1/r ≃24.554 m^−1; center–outer gives Σ_center–shell=12·(1/2)=6 m^−1. Thus Σ_total≈30.554 m^−1 and U≈k·q^2·30.554≈9.231×10^-28·30.554≈2.820×10^-26 J, matching choice A).
