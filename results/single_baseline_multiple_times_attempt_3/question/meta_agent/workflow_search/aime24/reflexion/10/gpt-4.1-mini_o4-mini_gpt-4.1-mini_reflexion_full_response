Question: Rectangles $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are drawn such that $D,E,C,F$ are collinear. Also, $A,D,H,G$ all lie on a circle. If $BC=16$,$AB=107$,$FG=17$, and $EF=184$, what is the length of $CE$?\Pattern: reflexion
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent SSGB', content='We repositioned rectangle ABCD so that BC is horizontal and CD vertical: B=(0,0), C=(16,0), D=(16,107), A=(0,107). Then EF lies on line DC (x=16), with E between D and C and F beyond C, so EF is vertical downward of length 184. We set E=(16,y), F=(16,y−184), FG horizontal of length 17 (to the right). Then H=(33,y), G=(33,y−184). We impose that A,D,H,G are concyclic. The circle through A=(0,107) and D=(16,107) has center on the perpendicular bisector x=8. Equating distances to H and G yields a quadratic in y. Imposing E between D and C (0<y<107) picks y=104. Hence CE=|104−0|=104.\n\nAnswer:104', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
