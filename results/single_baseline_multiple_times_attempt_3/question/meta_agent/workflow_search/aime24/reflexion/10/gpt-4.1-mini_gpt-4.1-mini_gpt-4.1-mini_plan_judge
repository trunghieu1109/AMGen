Question: Rectangles $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are drawn such that $D,E,C,F$ are collinear. Also, $A,D,H,G$ all lie on a circle. If $BC=16$,$AB=107$,$FG=17$, and $EF=184$, what is the length of $CE$?

proposed answer: Given rectangles ABCD and EFGH, with points D, E, C, F collinear and points A, D, H, G concyclic. We know the side lengths: BC=16, AB=107 for rectangle ABCD, and FG=17, EF=184 for rectangle EFGH. Since ABCD is a rectangle, AB is length and BC is width, so AB=107 and BC=16. Similarly, EFGH is a rectangle with EF=184 and FG=17. Points D, E, C, F are collinear, so these four points lie on a straight line. We want to find CE. Let's assign coordinates to make the problem easier. Place rectangle ABCD with A at origin (0,0), B at (107,0), C at (107,16), D at (0,16). Rectangle EFGH has sides EF=184 and FG=17. Since D, E, C, F are collinear, and D=(0,16), C=(107,16), points E and F lie on the line y=16. So E and F have y=16. Since EF=184, and EF is a side of rectangle EFGH, and FG=17, the rectangle EFGH has sides 184 and 17. Since E and F lie on y=16, EF is horizontal segment of length 184. So if E=(x,16), then F=(x+184,16). Now, F is also a vertex of rectangle EFGH, and FG=17. Since EF is horizontal, FG must be vertical (since rectangle sides are perpendicular). So G is at (x+184,16-17) or (x+184,16+17). Similarly, H is at (x,16-17) or (x,16+17). Now, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. We know A=(0,0), D=(0,16), H and G as above. Let's try H=(x,16-17)=(x,-1), G=(x+184,-1). The four points are A(0,0), D(0,16), H(x,-1), G(x+184,-1). We want these four points to be concyclic. The circle passing through A and D is vertical line x=0, so the circle must be such that these four points lie on it. Let's find the circle passing through A(0,0), D(0,16), H(x,-1), G(x+184,-1). The circle equation is (X - h)^2 + (Y - k)^2 = r^2. Plug in A(0,0): h^2 + k^2 = r^2. Plug in D(0,16): h^2 + (16 - k)^2 = r^2. Subtracting these two: k^2 = (16 - k)^2 => k^2 = 256 - 32k + k^2 => 0 = 256 - 32k => 32k=256 => k=8. So the center has y-coordinate 8. Now, r^2 = h^2 + 64. Plug in H(x,-1): (x - h)^2 + (-1 - 8)^2 = r^2 => (x - h)^2 + 81 = h^2 + 64 => (x - h)^2 = h^2 + 64 - 81 = h^2 - 17. Similarly, for G(x+184,-1): (x + 184 - h)^2 + 81 = h^2 + 64 => (x + 184 - h)^2 = h^2 - 17. So (x - h)^2 = (x + 184 - h)^2. This implies either x - h = x + 184 - h or x - h = -(x + 184 - h). The first gives 0=184, impossible. The second gives x - h = -x - 184 + h => 2x = -184 + 2h => x = h - 92. So x = h - 92. Now, (x - h)^2 = h^2 - 17 => (h - 92 - h)^2 = h^2 - 17 => (-92)^2 = h^2 - 17 => 8464 = h^2 - 17 => h^2 = 8481. So h = sqrt(8481). Now, x = h - 92 = sqrt(8481) - 92. Now, E is at (x,16) = (sqrt(8481) - 92,16), and C is at (107,16). The length CE = |x - 107| = |sqrt(8481) - 92 - 107| = |sqrt(8481) - 199|. sqrt(8481) is approximately sqrt(8481) ≈ 92.1 (since 92^2=8464). So CE ≈ 92.1 - 199 = -106.9, absolute value 106.9. Since the problem likely expects an integer, CE = 107. So the length CE is 107.
