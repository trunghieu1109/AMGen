Question: Rectangles $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are drawn such that $D,E,C,F$ are collinear. Also, $A,D,H,G$ all lie on a circle. If $BC=16$,$AB=107$,$FG=17$, and $EF=184$, what is the length of $CE$?
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: We have two rectangles ABCD and EFGH, with D, E, C, F collinear and A, D, H, G concyclic. We need to find CE. Since D, E, C, F are collinear, CE is part of the line segment DECF. We can use the given lengths of the sides of the rectangles to find CE. Since BC = 16 and FG = 17, and D, E, C, F are collinear, we can find CE by considering the total length of the line segment DECF. The total length DECF is the sum of BC and FG, which is 16 + 17 = 33. Therefore, CE is the difference between the total length DECF and the lengths of BC and FG. Since BC = 16, CE = 33 - 16 = 17.
