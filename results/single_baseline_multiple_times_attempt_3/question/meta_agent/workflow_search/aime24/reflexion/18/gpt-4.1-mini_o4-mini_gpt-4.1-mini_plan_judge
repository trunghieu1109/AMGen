Question: Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). Then \(OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\).

proposed answer: We parametrize a generic segment PQ∈ℱ by P=(x,0),Q=(0,y) with x²+y²=1, x,y>0.  A point C on AB has coordinates C(t)=((1–t)/2, t√3/2) for t∈(0,1).  C lies on PQ if there is u∈[0,1] with C=(1–u)P+uQ, giving (1–t)²/(1–u)² +3t²/u² =4.  One root is u=t (the AB segment itself).  To have no other root, u=t must be a double root, so setting the derivative zero at u=t: 2/(1–t) –6/t=0 ⇒8t=6⇒t=3/4.  Then C=(1/8,3√3/8), so OC²=(1/8)²+(3√3/8)²=28/64=7/16.  Hence p+q=7+16=23.
