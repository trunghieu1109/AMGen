    <pre>We are given points O=(0,0), A=(1/2,0), and B=(0, sqrt(3)/2). The segment AB has length 1 because the distance between A and B is sqrt((1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2) = sqrt(1/4 + 3/4) = sqrt(1) = 1. The family F consists of all segments PQ of length 1 with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis, both in the first quadrant. We want to find a unique point C on AB (other than A and B) that does not lie on any segment from F except AB itself. Then we want OC^2 in simplest form and find p+q where OC^2 = p/q.

Step 1: Parameterize the segment AB.

Let C be a point on AB. Since A and B are given, we can write C = A + t(B - A) for t in (0,1).

A = (1/2, 0), B = (0, sqrt(3)/2)

So,
C = (1/2, 0) + t(-1/2, sqrt(3)/2) = (1/2 - t/2, t*sqrt(3)/2)

Step 2: The family F consists of segments PQ where P = (x,0), Q = (0,y), x &gt; 0, y &gt; 0, and length PQ = 1.

Length PQ = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = 1 =&gt; y = sqrt(1 - x^2)

So each segment in F is from (x,0) to (0, sqrt(1 - x^2)) for x in (0,1).

Step 3: We want to find if C lies on any segment PQ in F other than AB.

A segment PQ in F is the line segment between (x,0) and (0, sqrt(1 - x^2)).

The parametric form of PQ is:
R(s) = (x,0) + s(-x, sqrt(1 - x^2)) = (x(1 - s), s*sqrt(1 - x^2)) for s in [0,1].

Step 4: For C to lie on PQ, there must be s in [0,1] such that

C_x = x(1 - s)
C_y = s*sqrt(1 - x^2)

From the first equation, s = 1 - C_x / x
From the second, s = C_y / sqrt(1 - x^2)

Equate:
1 - C_x / x = C_y / sqrt(1 - x^2)

Rearranged:
1 - C_y / sqrt(1 - x^2) = C_x / x

Step 5: Substitute C_x and C_y from the parameterization of C:

C_x = 1/2 - t/2 = (1 - t)/2
C_y = t*sqrt(3)/2

So:
1 - (t*sqrt(3)/2) / sqrt(1 - x^2) = ((1 - t)/2) / x

Multiply both sides by x:
x - x * (t*sqrt(3)/2) / sqrt(1 - x^2) = (1 - t)/2

Step 6: Rearranged:
2x - 2x * (t*sqrt(3)/2) / sqrt(1 - x^2) = 1 - t

Simplify the middle term:
2x - x * t * sqrt(3) / sqrt(1 - x^2) = 1 - t

Step 7: Rearranged:
2x - 1 = t (x * sqrt(3) / sqrt(1 - x^2) - 1)

So:
t = (2x - 1) / (x * sqrt(3) / sqrt(1 - x^2) - 1)

Step 8: For C to lie on PQ, s must be in [0,1]. Recall s = 1 - C_x / x = 1 - (1 - t)/2 / x = 1 - (1 - t)/(2x)

We want to find if for some x in (0,1), t in (0,1), and s in [0,1], the above holds.

Step 9: The problem states there is a unique point C on AB (other than A and B) that does not lie on any segment from F except AB itself.

This means for all x in (0,1), the point C lies on PQ only if PQ = AB.

Note that AB corresponds to P = A = (1/2, 0), Q = B = (0, sqrt(3)/2), so x = 1/2.

Step 10: So for x = 1/2, the segment PQ is AB.

We want to find C such that for all x in (0,1), x != 1/2, C does not lie on PQ.

Step 11: So for x != 1/2, the equation for t above should not yield t in (0,1) with s in [0,1].

Step 12: To find such C, consider the function:

f(x) = t = (2x - 1) / (x * sqrt(3) / sqrt(1 - x^2) - 1)

We want to find t in (0,1) such that for some x != 1/2, C lies on PQ.

Step 13: The unique C that does not lie on any PQ other than AB corresponds to the value of t where the function f(x) does not hit (0,1) for any x != 1/2.

Step 14: The critical point is when the numerator and denominator vanish or the function is undefined.

Step 15: Let&#39;s analyze the function f(x) for x in (0,1), x != 1/2.

Step 16: The denominator is:
D = x * sqrt(3) / sqrt(1 - x^2) - 1

Set D = 0 to find singularities:
x * sqrt(3) / sqrt(1 - x^2) = 1

Square both sides:
3x^2 / (1 - x^2) = 1

3x^2 = 1 - x^2

4x^2 = 1

x^2 = 1/4

x = 1/2 (since x &gt; 0)

So denominator zero at x=1/2, which corresponds to AB.

Step 17: For x near 1/2, f(x) tends to infinity or minus infinity.

Step 18: We want to find t such that for all x != 1/2, t is not in (0,1).

Step 19: Consider the limits of f(x) as x approaches 0+ and 1-.

As x -&gt; 0+, numerator -&gt; -1, denominator -&gt; 0 - 1 = -1, so f(x) -&gt; (-1)/(-1) = 1.

As x -&gt; 1-, numerator -&gt; 2*1 - 1 = 1, denominator -&gt; 1 * sqrt(3) / sqrt(0) - 1 -&gt; infinity - 1 = infinity, so f(x) -&gt; 0.

Step 20: So f(x) maps (0,1) \\ {1/2} to values between 0 and 1, with a singularity at x=1/2.

Step 21: The unique t for which C does not lie on any PQ other than AB is the value of t where the range of f(x) excludes t for x != 1/2.

Step 22: The problem is symmetric, so the unique C is the point on AB where the distance from O is minimal or maximal under the constraint.

Step 23: Let&#39;s compute OC^2:

C = ((1 - t)/2, t*sqrt(3)/2)

OC^2 = ((1 - t)/2)^2 + (t*sqrt(3)/2)^2 = (1 - t)^2 / 4 + 3t^2 / 4 = ( (1 - t)^2 + 3t^2 ) / 4

= (1 - 2t + t^2 + 3t^2) / 4 = (1 - 2t + 4t^2) / 4

= (4t^2 - 2t + 1) / 4

Step 24: We want to find t such that C is the unique point on AB not lying on any other PQ.

Step 25: From the previous analysis, the critical point is when the function f(x) equals t at x=1/2, and for other x, f(x) != t in (0,1).

Step 26: At x=1/2, denominator zero, so f(x) has a vertical asymptote.

Step 27: The function f(x) is continuous on (0,1) \\ {1/2} and tends to 1 as x-&gt;0+ and 0 as x-&gt;1-.

Step 28: The function f(x) is strictly decreasing on (0,1/2) and strictly increasing on (1/2,1) or vice versa.

Step 29: The unique t is the value where the minimum of f(x) on (0,1/2) equals the maximum of f(x) on (1/2,1), so that t is not attained anywhere else.

Step 30: To find this t, set the minimum of f(x) on (0,1/2) equal to the maximum of f(x) on (1/2,1).

Step 31: Alternatively, find the value of t where the equation

(2x - 1) / (x * sqrt(3) / sqrt(1 - x^2) - 1) = t

has exactly one solution x=1/2 in (0,1).

Step 32: This corresponds to the condition that the equation

(2x - 1) = t (x * sqrt(3) / sqrt(1 - x^2) - 1)

has a double root at x=1/2.

Step 33: Define function g(x) = (2x - 1) - t (x * sqrt(3) / sqrt(1 - x^2) - 1)

We want g(1/2) = 0 and g&#39;(1/2) = 0.

Step 34: Compute g(1/2):

2*(1/2) - 1 - t ( (1/2) * sqrt(3) / sqrt(1 - (1/2)^2) - 1 ) = 1 - 1 - t ( (1/2) * sqrt(3) / sqrt(1 - 1/4) - 1 ) = 0 - t ( (1/2) * sqrt(3) / sqrt(3/4) - 1 )

sqrt(3/4) = sqrt(3)/2

So:
(1/2) * sqrt(3) / (sqrt(3)/2) = (1/2) * sqrt(3) * (2 / sqrt(3)) = 1

Therefore:
g(1/2) = 0 - t (1 - 1) = 0

So g(1/2) = 0 for all t.

Step 35: Compute g&#39;(x):

g&#39;(x) = 2 - t * d/dx [ x * sqrt(3) / sqrt(1 - x^2) - 1 ]

Derivative of -1 is 0, so:

Let h(x) = x * sqrt(3) / sqrt(1 - x^2)

Then h&#39;(x) = sqrt(3) * d/dx [ x / sqrt(1 - x^2) ]

Compute d/dx [ x / sqrt(1 - x^2) ]:

Let u = x, v = sqrt(1 - x^2) = (1 - x^2)^{1/2}

Then d/dx (u/v) = (v * du/dx - u * dv/dx) / v^2

du/dx = 1

dv/dx = (1/2)(1 - x^2)^{-1/2} * (-2x) = -x / sqrt(1 - x^2)

So:

d/dx (x / sqrt(1 - x^2)) = ( sqrt(1 - x^2) * 1 - x * (-x / sqrt(1 - x^2)) ) / (1 - x^2)

= ( sqrt(1 - x^2) + x^2 / sqrt(1 - x^2) ) / (1 - x^2 )

= ( (1 - x^2) + x^2 ) / ( (1 - x^2) * sqrt(1 - x^2) )

= 1 / ( (1 - x^2)^{3/2} )

Therefore:

h&#39;(x) = sqrt(3) * 1 / (1 - x^2)^{3/2}

Step 36: So:

g&#39;(x) = 2 - t * sqrt(3) / (1 - x^2)^{3/2}

Step 37: Evaluate at x=1/2:

1 - (1/2)^2 = 1 - 1/4 = 3/4

(3/4)^{3/2} = (sqrt(3/4))^3 = (sqrt(3)/2)^3 = (sqrt(3))^3 / 8 = 3 * sqrt(3) / 8

So:

g&#39;(1/2) = 2 - t * sqrt(3) / (3 * sqrt(3) / 8) = 2 - t * sqrt(3) * 8 / (3 * sqrt(3)) = 2 - t * 8 / 3 = 2 - (8t)/3

Step 38: Set g&#39;(1/2) = 0:

2 - (8t)/3 = 0

(8t)/3 = 2

t = 2 * 3 / 8 = 3/4

Step 39: So t = 3/4.

Step 40: Compute OC^2 at t=3/4:

OC^2 = (4t^2 - 2t + 1)/4

= (4*(9/16) - 2*(3/4) + 1)/4

= (9/4 - 3/2 + 1)/4

= (9/4 - 3/2 + 1)/4

Convert to common denominator 4:

3/2 = 6/4

1 = 4/4

So:

(9/4 - 6/4 + 4/4)/4 = (7/4)/4 = 7/16

Step 41: So OC^2 = 7/16, p=7, q=16, p+q=23.
