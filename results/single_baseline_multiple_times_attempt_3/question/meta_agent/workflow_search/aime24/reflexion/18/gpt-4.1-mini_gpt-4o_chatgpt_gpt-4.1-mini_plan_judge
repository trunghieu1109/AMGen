Question: Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). Then \(OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\).

proposed answer: To solve this problem, we need to find the coordinates of point C on segment AB such that C does not belong to any segment PQ from the family \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). The line segment \(\overline{AB}\) has endpoints \(A = \left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right)\) and \(B = \left(0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\). The equation of line AB can be found using the slope formula. The slope of AB is \(-\sqrt{3}\), so the equation of line AB is \(y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\). A point C on AB can be parameterized as \(C = \left(\frac{1}{2}(1-t), \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t\right)\) for \(0 < t < 1\). For a segment \(\overline{PQ}\) with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis, let \(P = (x, 0)\) and \(Q = (0, y)\) with \(x^2 + y^2 = 1\). The line through P and Q has equation \(y = -\frac{y}{x}x + y\). For C to lie on this line, it must satisfy \(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t = -\frac{y}{x}\frac{1}{2}(1-t) + y\). Solving this equation for t, we find that the only solution is when C is on AB, which occurs when \(t = \frac{1}{3}\). Thus, C is at \(\left(\frac{1}{3}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}\right)\). The distance OC is \(\sqrt{\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}\right)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{9} + \frac{3}{9}} = \sqrt{\frac{4}{9}} = \frac{2}{3}\). Therefore, \(OC^2 = \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{4}{9}\). The integers p and q are 4 and 9, respectively, so p + q = 13.
