Question: Let $\triangle ABC$ have circumcenter $O$ and incenter $I$ with $\overline{IA}\perp\overline{OI}$, circumradius $13$, and inradius $6$. Find $AB\cdot AC$.
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: We are given that in triangle \( \triangle ABC \), the circumcenter is \( O \) and the incenter is \( I \). The condition \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \) implies that \( A \) lies on the circle with diameter \( OI \). The circumradius \( R \) is 13 and the inradius \( r \) is 6. We need to find \( AB \cdot AC \). We can use the formula \( OI^2 = R^2 - 2Rr \) to find \( OI \). Then, using the fact that \( A \) lies on the circle with diameter \( OI \), we can find the relation between the sides. The formula \( AB \cdot AC = c^2 + 4Rr \) is not directly applicable, but we can use the fact that \( AB \cdot AC = c^2 + 4Rr \) where \( c \) is the length of the side opposite \( A \).
