    <pre>Let $\triangle ABC$ have circumcenter $O$ and incenter $I$ with $\overline{IA}\perp\overline{OI}$, circumradius $13$, and inradius $6$. Find $AB\cdot AC$.

### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent ENh2 (yourself):
We are given that in triangle $\triangle ABC$, the circumcenter is $O$ and the incenter is $I$. The condition $\overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI}$ implies that $A$ is the excenter opposite $A$. The circumradius $R$ is 13 and the inradius $r$ is 6. We need to find $AB \cdot AC$. We can use the formula $OI^2 = R^2 - 2Rr$ to find $OI$. Then, using the fact that $IA \perp OI$, we can use the relation $IA^2 = r^2 + 2Rr$ to find $IA$. Finally, we use the formula $AB \cdot AC = c^2 + 4Rr$ to find the desired product.

### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent ENh2 (yourself):
360

### feedback #1 by Critic Agent hrjP:
The reasoning and calculations in the solution are incorrect. The condition \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \) does not imply that \( A \) is the excenter opposite \( A \). The formula \( OI^2 = R^2 - 2Rr \) is correct, but the use of \( IA^2 = r^2 + 2Rr \) is not justified. The formula \( AB \cdot AC = c^2 + 4Rr \) is also incorrect. The correct approach involves using the fact that \( IA \perp OI \) implies \( A \) lies on the circle with diameter \( OI \), and using the given circumradius and inradius to find \( AB \cdot AC \) using the formula \( AB \cdot AC = c^2 + 4Rr \) where \( c \) is the length of the side opposite \( A \).

Given previous attempts and feedback, carefully consider where you could go wrong in your latest attempt. Using insights from previous attempts, try to solve the task better.</pre>
