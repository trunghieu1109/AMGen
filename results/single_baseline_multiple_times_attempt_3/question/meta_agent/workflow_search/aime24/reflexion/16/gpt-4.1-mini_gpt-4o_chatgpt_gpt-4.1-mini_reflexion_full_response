The condition $\\overline{IA} \\perp \\overline{OI}$ implies that $A$ is the excenter opposite $A$. The circumradius $R$ is 13 and the inradius $r$ is 6. We need to find $AB \\cdot AC$. We can use the formula $OI^2 = R^2 - 2Rr$ to find $OI$. Then, using the fact that $IA \\perp OI$, we can use the relation $IA^2 = r^2 + 2Rr$ to find $IA$. Finally, we use the formula $AB \\cdot AC = c^2 + 4Rr$ to find the desired product.\n\n### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent ENh2 (yourself):\n360\n\n### feedback #1 by Critic Agent hrjP:\nThe reasoning and calculations in the solution are incorrect. The condition \\( \\overline{IA} \\perp \\overline{OI} \\) does not imply that \\( A \\) is the excenter opposite \\( A \\). The formula \\( OI^2 = R^2 - 2Rr \\) is correct, but the use of \\( IA^2 = r^2 + 2Rr \\) is not justified. The formula \\( AB \\cdot AC = c^2 + 4Rr \\) is also incorrect. The correct approach involves using the fact that \\( IA \\perp OI \\) implies \\( A \\) lies on the circle with diameter \\( OI \\), and using the given circumradius and inradius to find \\( AB \\cdot AC \\) using the formula \\( AB \\cdot AC = c^2 + 4Rr \\) where \\( c \\) is the length of the side opposite \\( A \\).\n\nGiven previous attempts and feedback, carefully consider where you could go wrong in your latest attempt.
