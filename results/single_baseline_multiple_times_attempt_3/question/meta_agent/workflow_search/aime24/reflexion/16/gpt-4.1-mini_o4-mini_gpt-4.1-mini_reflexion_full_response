Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent U81p', content='We use known facts. Let sides BC=a, CA=b, AB=c. Given circumradius R=13 and inradius r=6. Euler’s formula gives OI^2=R(R−2r)=13·1=13, hence OI=√13. The condition IA⊥OI makes triangle AIO right at I, so AI^2+OI^2=AO^2=R^2=169, giving AI^2=156 and AI=2√39. But in any triangle IA=r/ sin(A/2), so 36·csc^2(A/2)=156 ⇒sin^2(A/2)=3/13 ⇒cosA=1−2·3/13=7/13, sinA=2√30/13. Law of Sines gives a=BC=2R sinA=26·2√30/13=4√30. The area K=(1/2)bc sinA=(bc√30)/13, and also K=rs=6·(a+b+c)/2=3(a+b+c). Equating and simplifying alongside the Law of Cosines a^2=b^2+c^2−2bc cosA yields bc=468.\n\nAnswer:468', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
