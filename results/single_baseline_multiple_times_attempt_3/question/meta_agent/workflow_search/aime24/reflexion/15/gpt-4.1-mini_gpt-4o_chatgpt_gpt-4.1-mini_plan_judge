Question: Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: We need to find the number of residents who own all four items: a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, a garden spade, and a bag of candy hearts. Let's denote the number of residents who own all four items as x. We know that 437 residents own exactly two of the three items (diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade), and 234 residents own exactly three of these items. Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we can set up the equation for the union of the three sets (diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade): |A ∪ B ∪ C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ C|. We know |A ∩ B ∩ C| = 234, and the number of residents who own exactly two items is 437, which means |A ∩ B| + |A ∩ C| + |B ∩ C| - 3|A ∩ B ∩ C| = 437. Substituting |A ∩ B ∩ C| = 234, we get |A ∩ B| + |A ∩ C| + |B ∩ C| = 437 + 3*234 = 1139. Now, |A ∪ B ∪ C| = 195 + 367 + 562 - 1139 + 234 = 219. Therefore, the number of residents who own at least one of the three items is 219. Since each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, the number of residents who own all four items is 900 - 219 = 681.
