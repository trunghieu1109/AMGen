    <pre>Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.

    <pre>Let&#39;s denote the sets as follows: D = diamond ring owners, G = golf clubs owners, S = garden spade owners, C = candy hearts owners. We know: |D| = 195, |G| = 367, |S| = 562, |C| = 900 (since all own candy hearts). Total residents = 900. Let x be the number of residents who own all four items. We are given: number of residents who own exactly two items = 437, number who own exactly three items = 234. We want to find x. 

First, note that everyone owns candy hearts, so owning candy hearts is universal. Therefore, owning exactly two items means owning candy hearts plus exactly one of the other three items, or owning exactly two of the three items (D, G, S) plus candy hearts. But since candy hearts is owned by all, the number of items owned is at least 1 (candy hearts). So owning exactly two items means owning candy hearts plus exactly one of the other three items. Owning exactly three items means candy hearts plus exactly two of the other three items. Owning exactly four items means candy hearts plus all three other items.

So, the problem reduces to the three items D, G, S, with candy hearts always owned. 

Letâ€™s define:
- Number of residents owning exactly one of D, G, S = a
- Number owning exactly two of D, G, S = b
- Number owning exactly three of D, G, S = c

We know:
- Number owning exactly two items total = 437 (which corresponds to candy hearts + exactly one of D, G, S) = a
- Number owning exactly three items total = 234 (which corresponds to candy hearts + exactly two of D, G, S) = b
- Number owning all four items = x (which corresponds to candy hearts + all three of D, G, S) = c

So a = 437, b = 234, c = x.

Total residents = 900 = number owning candy hearts only + a + b + c
Number owning candy hearts only = 900 - (a + b + c) = 900 - (437 + 234 + x) = 229 - x

Now, sum of |D| + |G| + |S| = 195 + 367 + 562 = 1124

Sum of sizes of D, G, S can also be expressed as:
= 1*(number owning exactly one of D, G, S) + 2*(number owning exactly two of D, G, S) + 3*(number owning exactly three of D, G, S)
= 1*a + 2*b + 3*c
= 1*437 + 2*234 + 3*x
= 437 + 468 + 3x
= 905 + 3x

Equate the two expressions for sum of |D| + |G| + |S|:
1124 = 905 + 3x
3x = 1124 - 905 = 219
x = 219 / 3 = 73

Therefore, the number of residents who own all four items is 73.
