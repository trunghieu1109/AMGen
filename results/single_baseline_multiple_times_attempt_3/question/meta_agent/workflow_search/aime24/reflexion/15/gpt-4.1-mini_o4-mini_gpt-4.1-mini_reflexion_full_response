Question: Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.\Pattern: reflexion
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent a7qL', content='We have 900 residents, each owns candy hearts (C). Let D, G, S be the other items. Define: a = # with C+D only, b = C+G only, c = C+S only, d = C+D+G only, e = C+D+S only, f = C+G+S only, and x = C+D+G+S (all four). Then: (1) a+b+c = # exactly two = 437. (2) d+e+f = # exactly three = 234. (3) From totals: a+d+e+x = |D| =195; b+d+f+x = |G| =367; c+e+f+x = |S| =562. Summing these three gives (a+b+c) +2(d+e+f)+3x =195+367+562=1124. Substitute (1) and (2): 437 +2·234 +3x =1124 → 905+3x=1124 →3x=219 → x=73.\n\nAnswer:73', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
