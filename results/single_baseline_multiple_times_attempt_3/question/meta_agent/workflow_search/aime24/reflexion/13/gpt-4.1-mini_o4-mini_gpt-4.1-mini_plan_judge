Question: Eight circles of radius $34$ are sequentially tangent, and two of the circles are tangent to $AB$ and $BC$ of triangle $ABC$, respectively. $2024$ circles of radius $1$ can be arranged in the same manner. The inradius of triangle $ABC$ can be expressed as $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: I attempted to model both chains of circles in the ∠B wedge by placing B at the origin, AB along the x–axis, and BC at angle θ; I introduced a center‐line at angle φ for each chain and wrote down the tangency conditions of the last circle to BC.  I found that for radius 34 and k=8, and for radius 1 and k=2024, each gives an equation 2(k−1) sin(θ−φ)=2 cosθ−sinθ, with k=8 versus 2024.  These two constraints cannot both hold for any θ,φ unless sin(θ−φ)=0 (forcing θ=φ and tanθ=2), which cannot yield distinct chains of different radii inside the same wedge.  That indicates that without requiring tangency to the third side AC (which is not stated), the triangle’s size is not uniquely fixed: there is no single value of the inradius determined by the given data.
