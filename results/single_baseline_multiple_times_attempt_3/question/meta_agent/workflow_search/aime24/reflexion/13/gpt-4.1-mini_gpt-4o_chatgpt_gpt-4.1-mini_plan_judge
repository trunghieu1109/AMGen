Question: Eight circles of radius $34$ are sequentially tangent, and two of the circles are tangent to $AB$ and $BC$ of triangle $ABC$, respectively. $2024$ circles of radius $1$ can be arranged in the same manner. The inradius of triangle $ABC$ can be expressed as $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The problem involves two sets of circles tangent to the sides of a triangle, with different radii. The key is to understand how the inradius of the triangle scales with the size of the circles. The inradius scales linearly with the size of the circles. For the smaller circles of radius 1, the inradius is 1. For the larger circles of radius 34, the inradius is 34 times larger, since the configuration is similar and scales linearly. Therefore, the inradius of the triangle with the larger circles is 34.
