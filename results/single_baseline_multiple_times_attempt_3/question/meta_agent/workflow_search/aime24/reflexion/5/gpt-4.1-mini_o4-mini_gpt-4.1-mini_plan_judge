Question: Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.

proposed answer: We recognize that the tetrahedron has opposite edges equal, so all four faces are congruent triangles with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). We compute the volume via the Cayley–Menger determinant: det = 819200, so V^2 = 819200/288 = 25600/9, hence V = 160/3. Each triangular face has area by Heron’s formula: (1/4)√[(a+b+c)(-a+b+c)(a-b+c)(a+b-c)] with a^2=41, b^2=80, c^2=89 gives area = 6√21. Thus total surface area S = 24√21. The inradius r = 3V/S = (3·160/3)/(24√21) = 20/(3√21) = (20√21)/63. Hence m=20, n=21, p=63 and the sum is 20+21+63 = 104.
