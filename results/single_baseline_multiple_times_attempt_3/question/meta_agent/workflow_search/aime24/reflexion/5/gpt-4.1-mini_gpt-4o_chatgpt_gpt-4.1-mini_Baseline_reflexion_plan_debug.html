    <pre>Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.

Please think step by step and then solve the task.</pre>

    <pre>The problem involves a tetrahedron with equal face distances from a point inside it, which suggests that the tetrahedron is isosceles. The given side lengths indicate that the tetrahedron is isosceles with respect to the pairs of opposite edges. We can use the formula for the volume of a tetrahedron with given edge lengths to find the volume, and then use the formula for the inradius of a tetrahedron to find the distance from the point to the faces. The volume of a tetrahedron with vertices A, B, C, D can be found using the Cayley-Menger determinant. The inradius is given by the formula \( r = \frac{3V}{S} \), where \( V \) is the volume and \( S \) is the total surface area. We calculate the volume using the determinant and the surface area using the given side lengths. Finally, we express the inradius in the form \( \frac{m \sqrt{n}}{p} \) and find \( m+n+p \).
