Question: Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: First, we determine the total number of ways to choose 4 distinct numbers from the set S of 10 numbers: C(10,4).

Jen picks 4 distinct numbers. The winning numbers are also 4 distinct numbers chosen from S.

She wins a prize if at least 2 of her numbers are in the winning set.

We want P(grand prize | won a prize) = P(all 4 match) / P(at least 2 match).

Step 1: Total ways to choose 4 numbers from 10: C(10,4) = 210.

Step 2: Number of ways the winning numbers can be chosen such that exactly k of Jen's numbers are in the winning set:
- Jen's numbers: fixed 4 numbers.
- Winning numbers: choose k from Jen's 4 numbers, and (4-k) from the remaining 6 numbers.

Number of ways for exactly k matches = C(4,k) * C(6,4-k).

We need to find the number of winning sets with at least 2 matches:
- For k=2: C(4,2)*C(6,2) = 6*15 = 90
- For k=3: C(4,3)*C(6,1) = 4*6 = 24
- For k=4: C(4,4)*C(6,0) = 1*1 = 1

Total winning sets with at least 2 matches = 90 + 24 + 1 = 115.

Step 3: Probability of winning the grand prize (all 4 match) given that she won a prize:
= Number of winning sets with 4 matches / Number of winning sets with at least 2 matches
= 1 / 115.

So the probability is 1/115, and m+n = 1 + 115 = 116.
