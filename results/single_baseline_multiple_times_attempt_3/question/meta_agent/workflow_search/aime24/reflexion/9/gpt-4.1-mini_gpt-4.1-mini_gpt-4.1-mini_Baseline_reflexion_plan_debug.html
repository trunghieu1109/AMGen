    <pre>Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers.

    <pre>First, we determine the total number of ways to choose 4 distinct numbers from the set S of 10 numbers: C(10,4).

Jen picks 4 distinct numbers. The winning numbers are also 4 distinct numbers chosen from S.

She wins a prize if at least 2 of her numbers are in the winning set.

We want P(grand prize | won a prize) = P(all 4 match) / P(at least 2 match).

Step 1: Total ways to choose 4 numbers from 10: C(10,4) = 210.

Step 2: Number of ways the winning numbers can be chosen such that exactly k of Jen&#39;s numbers are in the winning set:
- Jen&#39;s numbers: fixed 4 numbers.
- Winning numbers: choose k from Jen&#39;s 4 numbers, and (4-k) from the remaining 6 numbers.

Number of ways for exactly k matches = C(4,k) * C(6,4-k).

We need to find the number of winning sets with at least 2 matches:
- For k=2: C(4,2)*C(6,2) = 6*15 = 90
- For k=3: C(4,3)*C(6,1) = 4*6 = 24
- For k=4: C(4,4)*C(6,0) = 1*1 = 1

Total winning sets with at least 2 matches = 90 + 24 + 1 = 115.

Step 3: Probability of winning the grand prize (all 4 match) given that she won a prize:
= Number of winning sets with 4 matches / Number of winning sets with at least 2 matches
= 1 / 115.

So the probability is 1/115, and m+n = 1 + 115 = 116.
