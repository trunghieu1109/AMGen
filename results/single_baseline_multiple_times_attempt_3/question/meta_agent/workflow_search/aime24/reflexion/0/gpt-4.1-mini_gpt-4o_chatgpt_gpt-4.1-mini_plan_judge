Question: Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: Let's first determine Aya's walking speed and the time she spends in the coffee shop. We know that when she walks at speed s, the total time is 4 hours, including t minutes in the coffee shop. The walking time is 4 hours - t minutes. Since she walks 9 km, we have the equation 9/s = 4 - t/60. When she walks at speed s+2, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which is 2.4 hours, including t minutes in the coffee shop. The walking time is 2.4 hours - t/60. We have the equation 9/(s+2) = 2.4 - t/60. Solving these two equations will give us s and t. Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get 9/s - 9/(s+2) = 1.6. Solving this gives s = 3 km/h. Substituting s = 3 into the first equation, we find t = 60 minutes. Now, if Aya walks at s + 1/2 = 3.5 km/h, the walking time is 9/3.5 hours. Converting this to minutes and adding t, we get the total time.
