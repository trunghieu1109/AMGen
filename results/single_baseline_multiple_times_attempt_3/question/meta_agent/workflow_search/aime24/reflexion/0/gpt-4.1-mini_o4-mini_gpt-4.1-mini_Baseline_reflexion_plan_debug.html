    <pre>Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.

Please think step by step and then solve the task.</pre>

    <pre>Let s be Aya’s walking speed (km/h) and t the coffee time (minutes).  
1. When she walks at speed s: total time = walking time + coffee time = 9/s hours + t/60 hours = 4 hours.  
2. When she walks at speed s+2: total time = 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4 hours.  
Subtracting: 9/s − 9/(s+2) = 4 − 2.4 = 1.6.  
Compute difference: 9*(2)/(s(s+2)) = 18/(s(s+2)) = 1.6 ⇒ s(s+2) = 18/1.6 = 11.25 ⇒ s = 2.5 km/h.  
Then 9/2.5 = 3.6 h ⇒ t/60 = 4 − 3.6 = 0.4 h ⇒ t = 24 min.  
At speed s+0.5 = 3 km/h: walking time is 9/3 = 3 hours = 180 minutes.  
Total including coffee: 180 + 24 = 204 minutes.
