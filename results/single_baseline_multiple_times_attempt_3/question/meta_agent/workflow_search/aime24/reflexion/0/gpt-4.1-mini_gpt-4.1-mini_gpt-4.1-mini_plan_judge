Question: Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: Let s be the walking speed in km/h, and t be the time spent in the coffee shop in minutes. The total time for the walk plus coffee break is given in hours and minutes. First, convert all times to hours for consistency. The first scenario: total time is 4 hours, which includes walking time plus t minutes (t/60 hours). The walking time is distance/speed = 9/s hours. So, 9/s + t/60 = 4. The second scenario: speed is s+2 km/h, total time is 2 hours 24 minutes = 2 + 24/60 = 2.4 hours. So, 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4. We have two equations: 9/s + t/60 = 4 and 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4. Subtract the second from the first: 9/s - 9/(s+2) = 4 - 2.4 = 1.6. Find s from this equation: 9/s - 9/(s+2) = 1.6. Multiply both sides by s(s+2): 9(s+2) - 9s = 1.6 s (s+2). Simplify left side: 9s + 18 - 9s = 18. So, 18 = 1.6 s^2 + 3.2 s. Rearranged: 1.6 s^2 + 3.2 s - 18 = 0. Divide by 1.6: s^2 + 2 s - 11.25 = 0. Solve quadratic: s = [-2 ± sqrt(4 + 45)]/2 = [-2 ± sqrt(49)]/2 = [-2 ± 7]/2. Two solutions: (5/2) = 2.5 or (-9/2) = -4.5 (discard negative speed). So s = 2.5 km/h. Find t: from 9/s + t/60 = 4, 9/2.5 + t/60 = 4, 3.6 + t/60 = 4, t/60 = 0.4, t = 24 minutes. Now, for speed s + 0.5 = 3 km/h, walking time = 9/3 = 3 hours. Total time including coffee break = walking time + t minutes = 3 hours + 24 minutes = 3 hours 24 minutes = 204 minutes.
