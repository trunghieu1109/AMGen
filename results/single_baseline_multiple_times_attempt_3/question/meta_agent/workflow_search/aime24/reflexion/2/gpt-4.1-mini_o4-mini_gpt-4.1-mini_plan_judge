Question: Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: We require that the set S of blue‐vertices satisfies S∩(S+k)=∅ for some nonzero rotation k. Equivalently, a 0–1 string of length 8 has a zero autocorrelation at some nonzero shift.  One checks that any S of size 0–3 always works (total 1+8+28+56=93).  For |S|≥5, |S|+|S|>8 so S and S+k must overlap for every k, so none of these work (sizes 5,6,7,8 give 56+28+8+1=93 bad).  For |S|=4, out of C(8,4)=70 subsets exactly 22 work (the ones admitting a collision‐free shift) and 48 do not.  Hence total good subsets =93+22=115.  Probability =115/256, so m+n=115+256=371.
