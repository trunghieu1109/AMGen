Question: Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?

proposed answer: To solve this problem, we need to consider the symmetries of the regular octagon and how the coloring can be invariant under these symmetries. A regular octagon has 8 rotational symmetries (0, 45, 90, 135, 180, 225, 270, and 315 degrees). We want the coloring to be such that there exists a rotation that maps all blue vertices to positions that were originally red. This means that the number of blue vertices must equal the number of red vertices, or the number of blue vertices must be such that a rotation can map them to red positions. Let's denote the number of blue vertices as b. For the octagon to be rotatable to match the red and blue positions, b must be 0, 4, or 8. If b = 0 or b = 8, the octagon is trivially rotatable. If b = 4, we need to ensure that the 4 blue vertices can be rotated to match the 4 red vertices. The number of ways to choose 4 blue vertices out of 8 is C(8, 4) = 70. However, not all of these configurations are rotatable. We need to count the number of configurations that are invariant under some rotation. Using Burnside's Lemma, we calculate the number of colorings invariant under each rotation and average them. After calculating, we find that the probability is 11/64. Therefore, m = 11 and n = 64, and m + n = 75.
