Question: Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.\Pattern: reflexion

Let's denote N as \\( abcd \\), where \\( a, b, c, d \\) are its digits. We need to check the divisibility by 7 for the numbers obtained by changing each digit to 1: \\( 1bcd, a1cd, ab1d, abc1 \\). We start with the largest four-digit number, 9999, and check if it satisfies the condition. If not, we decrement and check again. Once we find such an N, we calculate \\( Q \\) and \\( R \\) when N is divided by 1000, and then find \\( Q + R \\).\n\n### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent X0Js (yourself):\n1008\n\n### feedback #1 by Critic Agent NBAo:\nThe solution approach is correct, but the final answer needs verification. The greatest four-digit number satisfying the condition is 9996, not 9999. When divided by 1000, 9996 gives Q = 9 and R = 996, so Q + R = 1005.\n\nGiven previous attempts and feedback, carefully consider where you could go wrong in your latest attempt.
