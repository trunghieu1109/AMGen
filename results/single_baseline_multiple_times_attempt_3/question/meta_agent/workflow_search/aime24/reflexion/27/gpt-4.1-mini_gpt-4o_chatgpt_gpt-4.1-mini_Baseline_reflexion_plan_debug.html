    <pre>Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.

### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent X0Js (yourself):
To solve this problem, we need to find the greatest four-digit number N such that changing any of its digits to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. Let&#39;s denote N as \( abcd \), where \( a, b, c, d \) are its digits. We need to check the divisibility by 7 for the numbers obtained by changing each digit to 1: \( 1bcd, a1cd, ab1d, abc1 \). We start with the largest four-digit number, 9999, and check if it satisfies the condition. If not, we decrement and check again. Once we find such an N, we calculate \( Q \) and \( R \) when N is divided by 1000, and then find \( Q + R \).

### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent X0Js (yourself):
1008

### feedback #1 by Critic Agent NBAo:
The solution approach is correct, but the final answer needs verification. The greatest four-digit number satisfying the condition is 9996, not 9999. When divided by 1000, 9996 gives Q = 9 and R = 996, so Q + R = 1005.

Given previous attempts and feedback, carefully consider where you could go wrong in your latest attempt. Using insights from previous attempts, try to solve the task better.</pre>
