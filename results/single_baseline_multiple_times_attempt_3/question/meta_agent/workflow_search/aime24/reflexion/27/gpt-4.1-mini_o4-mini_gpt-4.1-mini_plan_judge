Question: Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.

proposed answer: We seek the largest 4‐digit N=1000w+100x+10y+z (1≤w≤9,0≤x,y,z≤9) such that replacing any one digit by 1 yields a multiple of 7. Let M₁ when w→1, M₂ when x→1, M₃ when y→1, M₄ when z→1.  

Mod 7 arithmetic gives:  
M₁≡N+1000(1−w)≡N+6(1−w)≡0 ⇒ N≡6(w−1)  
M₂≡N+2(1−x)≡0 ⇒ N≡2(x−1)  
M₃≡N+3(1−y)≡0 ⇒ N≡3(y−1)  
M₄≡N+(1−z)≡0 ⇒ N≡z−1  
Also N≡6w+2x+3y+z.  
Equate the first four to each other and to the last, reduce mod 7, and solve:  
(1) 6w−6≡2x−2 ⇒ x≡3w+5  
(2) 6w−6≡3y−3 ⇒ y≡2w−1  
(3) 6w−6≡z−1   ⇒ z≡6w−5  
(4) 6w−6≡6w+2x+3y+z ⇒ 2x+3y+z≡1  
Substitute x,y,z in (4): 2(3w+5)+3(2w−1)+(6w−5)≡1 ⇒18w+2≡1 ⇒4w+2≡1⇒4w≡6⇒w≡5 (mod 7), so w=5.  
Then x≡3·5+5=20≡6 (mod 7) ⇒ x=6;  
y≡2·5−1=9 (mod 7) ⇒ y=9;  
z≡6·5−5=25≡4 (mod 7) ⇒ z=4.  
Thus N=5694.  
Check: replacing each digit by 1 gives 1694,5194,5614,5691, all divisible by 7.  
No larger w works, so N=5694 is the greatest.  
Finally, Q=N÷1000=5, R=N mod 1000=694, so Q+R=5+694=699.
