Question: Find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon ($12$-gon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The diagram below shows three of those rectangles.
[asy] unitsize(0.6 inch); for(int i=0; i<360; i+=30) { dot(dir(i), 4+black); draw(dir(i)--dir(i+30)); } draw(dir(120)--dir(330)); filldraw(dir(210)--dir(240)--dir(30)--dir(60)--cycle, mediumgray, linewidth(1.5)); draw((0,0.366)--(0.366,0), linewidth(1.5)); [/asy]

proposed answer: We model all chords of the regular 12‐gon as lines in 12 equally spaced orientations (multiples of 15°). Any rectangle must have its sides in two perpendicular directions φ and φ+90°, both available among these 12. For each such direction there are exactly 3 parallel chords (solutions to 2m+s≡const), so choosing 2 of the 3 in direction φ and 2 of the 3 in φ+90° yields C(3,2)×C(3,2)=9 rectangles for that orientation pair. There are 12 possible φ’s but each φ+90° pair is counted twice, giving 6 distinct perpendicular‐direction pairs, and hence 6×9=54 rectangles.
