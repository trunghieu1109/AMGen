Question: Find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon ($12$-gon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The diagram below shows three of those rectangles.
[asy] unitsize(0.6 inch); for(int i=0; i<360; i+=30) { dot(dir(i), 4+black); draw(dir(i)--dir(i+30)); } draw(dir(120)--dir(330)); filldraw(dir(210)--dir(240)--dir(30)--dir(60)--cycle, mediumgray, linewidth(1.5)); draw((0,0.366)--(0.366,0), linewidth(1.5)); [/asy]

proposed answer: To find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon, we need to consider the vertices of the dodecagon. A regular dodecagon has 12 vertices. A rectangle is determined by choosing two pairs of opposite sides. In a regular dodecagon, opposite sides are not directly across from each other, but rather, they are separated by 5 other sides. Therefore, to form a rectangle, we need to choose two pairs of opposite vertices. We can label the vertices of the dodecagon as 0, 1, 2, ..., 11. A rectangle is formed by choosing two pairs of opposite vertices, say (i, i+6) and (j, j+6), where i and j are distinct and range from 0 to 5. For each choice of i, there are 5 possible choices for j, leading to a total of 6 * 5 = 30 rectangles. However, each rectangle is counted twice (once for each pair of opposite vertices), so we divide by 2 to get the final count.
