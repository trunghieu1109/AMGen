    <pre>Find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon ($12$-gon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The diagram below shows three of those rectangles.

### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent aRdZ (yourself):
We observe that any rectangle inscribed in a circle must have its diagonals pass through the center, so each diagonal is a diameter of the circumcircle.  In a regular 12‐gon there are 6 diameters (each joining a pair of opposite vertices).  Any two distinct diameters intersect at the center and their four endpoints form a rectangle.  Thus the number of such rectangles is the number of ways to choose 2 of the 6 diameters, namely C(6,2)=15.

### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent aRdZ (yourself):
15

### feedback #1 by Critic Agent NxCp:
The submitted solution assumes every rectangle must be cyclic with its four vertices on the circle so that its diagonals are diameters.  However, the problem only requires each rectangle side to lie along some side or diagonal of the 12-gon; its vertices can occur at interior intersections of diagonals, not just at the circle’s boundary.  Hence there are many more rectangles than the 15 counted, and the reasoning is incomplete.

Given previous attempts and feedback, carefully consider where you could go wrong in your latest attempt. Using insights from previous attempts, try to solve the task better.</pre>

    <pre>We model all chords of the regular 12‐gon as lines in 12 equally spaced orientations (multiples of 15°). Any rectangle must have its sides in two perpendicular directions φ and φ+90°, both available among these 12. For each such direction there are exactly 3 parallel chords (solutions to 2m+s≡const), so choosing 2 of the 3 in direction φ and 2 of the 3 in φ+90° yields C(3,2)×C(3,2)=9 rectangles for that orientation pair. There are 12 possible φ’s but each φ+90° pair is counted twice, giving 6 distinct perpendicular‐direction pairs, and hence 6×9=54 rectangles.
