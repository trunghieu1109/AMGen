Question: Find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon ($12$-gon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The diagram below shows three of those rectangles.

Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent gtz1', content='To find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon, we need to consider the vertices of the dodecagon. A regular dodecagon has 12 vertices. A rectangle is determined by choosing two pairs of opposite sides. In a regular dodecagon, opposite sides are not directly across from each other, but rather, they are separated by 5 other sides. Therefore, to form a rectangle, we need to choose two pairs of opposite vertices. We can label the vertices of the dodecagon as 0, 1, 2, ..., 11. A rectangle is formed by choosing two pairs of opposite vertices, say (i, i+6) and (j, j+6), where i and j are distinct and range from 0 to 5. For each choice of i, there are 5 possible choices for j, leading to a total of 6 * 5 = 30 rectangles. However, each rectangle is counted twice (once for each pair of opposite vertices), so we divide by 2 to get the final count.\n\nAnswer:15', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
