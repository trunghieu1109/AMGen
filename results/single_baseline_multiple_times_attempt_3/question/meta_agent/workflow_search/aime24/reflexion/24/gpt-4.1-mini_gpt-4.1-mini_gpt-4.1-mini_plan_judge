Question: Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations:
\[\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}\]\[\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}\]\[\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}\]
Then the value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: Given the system:
log2(x/(yz)) = 1/2
log2(y/(xz)) = 1/3
log2(z/(xy)) = 1/4

Rewrite each equation in terms of logs:
Let a = log2(x), b = log2(y), c = log2(z).

Then:
log2(x/(yz)) = a - (b + c) = 1/2
log2(y/(xz)) = b - (a + c) = 1/3
log2(z/(xy)) = c - (a + b) = 1/4

We have the system:
a - b - c = 1/2
b - a - c = 1/3
c - a - b = 1/4

Add all three equations:
(a - b - c) + (b - a - c) + (c - a - b) = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4
Left side simplifies:
a - b - c + b - a - c + c - a - b = (-a) + (-b) + (-c) = -(a + b + c)
Right side:
1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 = (6/12 + 4/12 + 3/12) = 13/12

So:
-(a + b + c) = 13/12
=> a + b + c = -13/12

We want to find |log2(x^4 y^3 z^2)| = |4a + 3b + 2c|

From the system:
1) a - b - c = 1/2
2) b - a - c = 1/3
3) c - a - b = 1/4

Rewrite:
1) a - b - c = 1/2
2) -a + b - c = 1/3
3) -a - b + c = 1/4

Add (1) and (2):
(a - b - c) + (-a + b - c) = 1/2 + 1/3
=> -2c = 5/6
=> c = -5/12

Add (1) and (3):
(a - b - c) + (-a - b + c) = 1/2 + 1/4
=> -2b = 3/4
=> b = -3/8

Add (2) and (3):
(-a + b - c) + (-a - b + c) = 1/3 + 1/4
=> -2a = 7/12
=> a = -7/24

Check sum:
a + b + c = -7/24 - 3/8 - 5/12
Convert to common denominator 24:
-7/24 - 9/24 - 10/24 = -26/24 = -13/12 (matches earlier)

Now compute 4a + 3b + 2c:
4*(-7/24) + 3*(-3/8) + 2*(-5/12)
= -28/24 - 9/8 - 10/12
Convert all to denominator 24:
-28/24 - (9/8)*(3/3) = -28/24 - 27/24 - (10/12)*(2/2) = -28/24 - 27/24 - 20/24
= (-28 - 27 - 20)/24 = -75/24
Simplify:
75/24 = 25/8

Absolute value:
|4a + 3b + 2c| = 25/8

m = 25, n = 8, relatively prime.
m + n = 25 + 8 = 33
