Question: A list of positive integers has the following properties:
$\bullet$ The sum of the items in the list is $30$.
$\bullet$ The unique mode of the list is $9$.
$\bullet$ The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.
Find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: We need a list of positive integers summing to 30, with unique mode 9 and an even number of terms so the median (the average of the two middle terms) is an integer not in the list. Let the list have 2k terms. For k=1 (2 terms) there is no mode; for k=2 (4 terms), try two 9's (sum 18) plus two distinct positives summing to 12. Possible pairs summing to 12 with distinct positives not equal to 9 are (5,7) and (4,8). The list [5,7,9,9] has median (7+9)/2=8, an integer not in the list, and 9 is the unique mode. Sum of squares is 5²+7²+9²+9²=25+49+81+81=236. Longer lists (6 terms) fail to give an integer median or a unique mode 9.
