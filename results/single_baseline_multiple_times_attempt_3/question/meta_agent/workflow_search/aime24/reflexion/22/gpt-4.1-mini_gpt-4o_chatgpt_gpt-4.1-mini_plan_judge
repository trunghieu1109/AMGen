Question: A list of positive integers has the following properties:
$\bullet$ The sum of the items in the list is $30$.
$\bullet$ The unique mode of the list is $9$.
$\bullet$ The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.
Find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To solve the problem, we need to construct a list of positive integers that satisfies all the given conditions: the sum of the items is 30, the unique mode is 9, and the median is a positive integer not in the list. Let's denote the list as a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where a_1 <= a_2 <= ... <= a_n. Since 9 is the unique mode, it must appear more frequently than any other number. Let's assume 9 appears k times, where k >= 2. The median condition implies that the list has an odd number of elements, so the median is the middle element, which is not in the list. Let's try constructing a list with 7 elements, so the median is the 4th element. If the median is 8, the list could be 6, 6, 7, 9, 9, 9, 9. The sum is 30, the mode is 9, and the median is 8, which is not in the list. Now, let's find the sum of the squares: 6^2 + 6^2 + 7^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 = 36 + 36 + 49 + 81 + 81 + 81 + 81 = 366.
