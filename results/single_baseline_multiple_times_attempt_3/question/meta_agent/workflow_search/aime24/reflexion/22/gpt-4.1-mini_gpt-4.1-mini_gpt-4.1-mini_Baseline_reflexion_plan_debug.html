    <pre>Let&#39;s analyze the problem step by step.

1. The list consists of positive integers.
2. The sum of the items in the list is 30.
3. The unique mode of the list is 9, meaning 9 appears more times than any other number.
4. The median is a positive integer that does not appear in the list.

Step 1: Determine the length of the list.
- The median is a positive integer not in the list. For the median to be an integer not in the list, the list must have an even number of elements (because the median of an odd-length list is the middle element, which must be in the list).
- So, the list length n is even.

Step 2: Let the list be sorted: a_1 &lt;= a_2 &lt;= ... &lt;= a_n.
- The median is (a_{n/2} + a_{n/2 + 1}) / 2.
- This median is an integer not in the list, so (a_{n/2} + a_{n/2 + 1}) must be even, and the median integer is not equal to either a_{n/2} or a_{n/2 + 1}.

Step 3: The mode is 9 and unique.
- So 9 appears more times than any other number.

Step 4: Try to find a list that satisfies all conditions.

Try n=4:
- Median = (a_2 + a_3)/2.
- Median is integer not in list.
- Let&#39;s try to find such a list.

Try to have 9 appear twice (to be mode), and two other numbers.
- Sum is 30.
- So 9 + 9 + x + y = 30 =&gt; x + y = 12.
- The list is sorted: a_1 &lt;= a_2 &lt;= a_3 &lt;= a_4.
- Since 9 appears twice, and is mode, no other number appears twice.
- So x and y are distinct and appear once each.

Median = (a_2 + a_3)/2.
- The list sorted is: a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4.
- 9 appears twice, so 9 must be at positions 2 and 3 to be the mode and to have median between them.
- So a_2 = 9, a_3 = 9.
- Then median = (9 + 9)/2 = 9.
- But median must not be in the list, so median cannot be 9.
- So 9 cannot be at positions 2 and 3.

Try 9 at positions 3 and 4:
- Then a_3 = 9, a_4 = 9.
- Median = (a_2 + a_3)/2 = (a_2 + 9)/2.
- Median is integer not in list.
- So median != a_2 and median != 9.

Sum: a_1 + a_2 + 9 + 9 = 30 =&gt; a_1 + a_2 = 12.

Try a_1 = 3, a_2 = 9:
- Then median = (9 + 9)/2 = 9, which is in the list.
- Not allowed.

Try a_1 = 4, a_2 = 8:
- Median = (8 + 9)/2 = 8.5, not integer.
- Not allowed.

Try a_1 = 5, a_2 = 7:
- Median = (7 + 9)/2 = 8, integer.
- Is 8 in the list? No.
- So median = 8, which is not in the list.
- The list is [5,7,9,9].
- Sum = 5 + 7 + 9 + 9 = 30.
- Mode is 9 (appears twice), others appear once.
- Median is 8, integer not in list.
- All conditions satisfied.

Step 5: Calculate sum of squares:
5^2 + 7^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 = 25 + 49 + 81 + 81 = 236.

Answer: 236.
