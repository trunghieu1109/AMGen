Question: Alice chooses a set $A$ of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets $B$ of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of $B$ belongs to $A$. Bob's list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A.

proposed answer: Let's analyze the problem step by step. Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B such that the maximum element of B is in A. We need to find the sum of the elements of A given that Bob's list has 2024 sets.

For each element a in A, the number of sets B where the maximum element is a is 2^(a-1). This is because we can choose any subset of {1, 2, ..., a-1} to be in B, and then include a as the maximum element.

Therefore, the total number of sets B is the sum of 2^(a-1) for all a in A. We are given that this total is 2024.

Let's find the possible values of a such that 2^(a-1) contributes to this sum. We note that 2024 can be expressed as a sum of powers of 2:

2024 = 2^0 + 2^3 + 2^4 + 2^5 + 2^6 + 2^7 + 2^8 + 2^9.

This corresponds to the binary representation of 2024, which is 11111110000.

Thus, the elements of A are 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

The sum of these elements is 1 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 = 50.
