Question: Alice chooses a set $A$ of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets $B$ of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of $B$ belongs to $A$. Bob's list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A.\Pattern: reflexion
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent ufc4', content='We need sum of A given that sum_{m in A}2^(m-1)=2024. Write 2024 in binary (powers of 2): 1024+512+256+128+64+32+8, corresponding to exponents m-1=10,9,8,7,6,5,3 so m=11,10,9,8,7,6,4.
