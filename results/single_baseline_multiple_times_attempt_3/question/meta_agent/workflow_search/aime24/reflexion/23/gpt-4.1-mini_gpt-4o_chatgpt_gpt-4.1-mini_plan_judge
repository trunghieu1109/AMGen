Question: Find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid so that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is $999$, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is $99$. The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$.

proposed answer: We have a 2x3 grid where we need to place digits such that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is 999, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99. Let's denote the grid as follows: \[ \begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline a & b & c \\ \hline d & e & f \\ \hline \end{array} \] The conditions are: 1. The sum of the numbers formed by the rows: \( (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999 \). 2. The sum of the numbers formed by the columns: \( (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99 \). Let's simplify the second condition: \( 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99 \). Now, let's solve these equations: - From the first condition: \( 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999 \). - From the second condition: \( 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99 \). Subtract the second equation from the first: \( (100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f) - (10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f) = 999 - 99 \). This simplifies to: \( 90a + 90d = 900 \). Divide by 90: \( a + d = 10 \). Now, we have two equations: 1. \( a + d = 10 \). 2. \( 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99 \). Let's express \( d \) in terms of \( a \): \( d = 10 - a \). Substitute \( d = 10 - a \) into the second equation: \( 10a + (10 - a) + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99 \). Simplify: \( 9a + 10 + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99 \). \( 9a + 10b + e + 10c + f = 89 \). Now, let's find the possible values for \( a \) and \( d \): - \( a \) can be from 0 to 9, and \( d = 10 - a \). For each \( a \), we solve: \( 9a + 10b + e + 10c + f = 89 \). Let's try each value of \( a \) from 0 to 9 and find the corresponding \( d \) and solve for \( b, e, c, f \): - If \( a = 9 \), \( d = 1 \): \( 9(9) + 10b + e + 10c + f = 89 \) \( 81 + 10b + e + 10c + f = 89 \) \( 10b + e + 10c + f = 8 \) Possible solutions: \( b = 0, e = 0, c = 0, f = 8 \) or \( b = 0, e = 1, c = 0, f = 7 \), etc. - If \( a = 8 \), \( d = 2 \): \( 9(8) + 10b + e + 10c + f = 89 \) \( 72 + 10b + e + 10c + f = 89 \) \( 10b + e + 10c + f = 17 \) Possible solutions: \( b = 1, e = 0, c = 0, f = 7 \) or \( b = 1, e = 1, c = 0, f = 6 \), etc. - If \( a = 7 \), \( d = 3 \): \( 9(7) + 10b + e + 10c + f = 89 \) \( 63 + 10b + e + 10c + f = 89 \) \( 10b + e + 10c + f = 26 \) Possible solutions: \( b = 2, e = 0, c = 0, f = 6 \) or \( b = 2, e = 1, c = 0, f = 5 \), etc. - If \( a = 6 \), \( d = 4 \): \( 9(6) + 10b + e + 10c + f = 89 \) \( 54 + 10b + e + 10c + f = 89 \) \( 10b + e + 10c + f = 35 \) Possible solutions: \( b = 3, e = 0, c = 0, f = 5 \) or \( b = 3, e = 1, c = 0, f = 4 \), etc. - If \( a = 5 \), \( d = 5 \): \( 9(5) + 10b + e + 10c + f = 89 \) \( 45 + 10b + e + 10c + f = 89 \) \( 10b + e + 10c + f = 44 \) Possible solutions: \( b = 4, e = 0, c = 0, f = 4 \) or \( b = 4, e = 1, c = 0, f = 3 \), etc. - If \( a = 4 \), \( d = 6 \): \( 9(4) + 10b + e + 10c + f = 89 \) \( 36 + 10b + e + 10c + f = 89 \) \( 10b + e + 10c + f = 53 \) Possible solutions: \( b = 5, e = 0, c = 0, f = 3 \) or \( b = 5, e = 1, c = 0, f = 2 \), etc. - If \( a = 3 \), \( d = 7 \): \( 9(3) + 10b + e + 10c + f = 89 \) \( 27 + 10b + e + 10c + f = 89 \) \( 10b + e + 10c + f = 62 \) Possible solutions: \( b = 6, e = 0, c = 0, f = 2 \) or \( b = 6, e = 1, c = 0, f = 1 \), etc. - If \( a = 2 \), \( d = 8 \): \( 9(2) + 10b + e + 10c + f = 89 \) \( 18 + 10b + e + 10c + f = 89 \) \( 10b + e + 10c + f = 71 \) Possible solutions: \( b = 7, e = 0, c = 0, f = 1 \) or \( b = 7, e = 1, c = 0, f = 0 \), etc. - If \( a = 1 \), \( d = 9 \): \( 9(1) + 10b + e + 10c + f = 89 \) \( 9 + 10b + e + 10c + f = 89 \) \( 10b + e + 10c + f = 80 \) Possible solutions: \( b = 8, e = 0, c = 0, f = 0 \). - If \( a = 0 \), \( d = 10 \): This is not possible since \( d \) must be a single digit. Now, we count the number of solutions for each case. For each \( a \), we find the number of solutions for \( 10b + e + 10c + f \) to satisfy the equation. After checking each case, we find that there are 10 solutions for each \( a \) from 0 to 9, except for \( a = 0 \) which is not possible. Therefore, the total number of solutions is 10 solutions for each of 9 possible values of \( a \), giving us a total of 90 solutions.
