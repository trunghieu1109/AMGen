Question: Find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid so that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is $999$, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is $99$. The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$.
\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\ \hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\ \hline \end{array}\]

proposed answer: Let a,b,c be the top row digits and d,e,f the bottom row.  Reading left–right gives (100a+10b+c)+(100d+10e+f)=999, so 100(a+d)+10(b+e)+(c+f)=999.  Reading top–bottom gives (10a+d)+(10b+e)+(10c+f)=99, i.e.
10(a+b+c)+(d+e+f)=99.  Set S1=a+d, S2=b+e, S3=c+f; then 100S1+10S2+S3=999 forces S1=S2=S3=9.  Also a+b+c=T1, d+e+f=T2 with 10T1+T2=99 and T1+T2=S1+S2+S3=27 gives 9T1+27=99 so T1=8.  Hence a,b,c are nonnegative digits summing to 8 (no upper bounds violated), and d,e,f=9−a,9−b,9−c.  Number of (a,b,c) with sum 8 is C(8+3−1,2)=C(10,2)=45.
