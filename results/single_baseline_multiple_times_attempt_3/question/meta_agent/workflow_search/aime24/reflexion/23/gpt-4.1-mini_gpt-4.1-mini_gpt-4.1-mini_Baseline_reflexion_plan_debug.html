    <pre>Let&#39;s denote the digits in the 2x3 grid as:

| a | b | c |
| d | e | f |

The problem states:
1. The sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right (rows) is 999.
   That is, the two numbers are abc and def, and abc + def = 999.

2. The sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom (columns) is 99.
   That is, the three numbers are ad and be and cf, and ad + be + cf = 99.

Note that each cell contains a single digit (0-9).

From the example given:
| 0 | 0 | 8 |
| 9 | 9 | 1 |

Row sums: 008 + 991 = 999
Column sums: 09 + 09 + 81 = 99

Let&#39;s analyze the problem step by step:

Step 1: Define variables:
a,b,c,d,e,f are digits from 0 to 9.

Step 2: Row sum equation:
100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999
=&gt; 100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999

Step 3: Column sum equation:
10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99
=&gt; 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99

Step 4: From Step 2, since 999 = 900 + 90 + 9,
we can write:
100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 900 + 90 + 9
So,
a + d = 9
b + e = 9
c + f = 9

Step 5: From Step 3:
10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99
Using the sums from Step 4:
(a + d) + (b + e) + (c + f) = 9 + 9 + 9 = 27
So,
d + e + f = 27 - (a + b + c)

Substitute into Step 3:
10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99
=&gt; 10(a + b + c) + 27 - (a + b + c) = 99
=&gt; 9(a + b + c) + 27 = 99
=&gt; 9(a + b + c) = 72
=&gt; a + b + c = 8

Step 6: Since a + d = 9, b + e = 9, c + f = 9, and a + b + c = 8,
then d + e + f = 27 - 8 = 19

Step 7: Now, a,b,c are digits from 0 to 9, sum to 8.
Similarly, d,e,f are digits from 0 to 9, sum to 19, and each pair sums to 9:
- d = 9 - a
- e = 9 - b
- f = 9 - c

Step 8: Check if d,e,f are digits (0-9):
Since a,b,c are digits 0-9, and d=9-a, e=9-b, f=9-c, d,e,f will be digits 0-9.

Step 9: Count the number of triples (a,b,c) with digits 0-9 summing to 8.
This is a classic stars and bars problem:
Number of solutions to a + b + c = 8 with 0 ≤ a,b,c ≤ 9.
Since 8 ≤ 9, no upper bound restriction is violated.
Number of solutions = C(8+3-1,3-1) = C(10,2) = 45.

Step 10: For each such triple (a,b,c), the corresponding (d,e,f) is uniquely determined as (9-a, 9-b, 9-c).

Therefore, the total number of ways to fill the grid is 45.

Step 11: Verify with the example:
Example: a=0,b=0,c=8 =&gt; sum=8
Then d=9-0=9, e=9-0=9, f=9-8=1
Matches the example given.

Hence, the answer is 45.
