Question: Find the largest possible real part of \[(75+117i)z+\frac{96+144i}{z}\]where $z$ is a complex number with $|z|=4$.
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: We want to maximize Re[(75+117i)z + (96+144i)/z] for |z|=4. Write z=4e^{iθ}. Then the expression becomes 4(75+117i)e^{iθ} + (96+144i)/(4e^{iθ}) = (300+468i)e^{iθ} + (24+36i)e^{-iθ}. Its real part is 324 cosθ – 432 sinθ, whose maximum is √(324²+432²)=540.
