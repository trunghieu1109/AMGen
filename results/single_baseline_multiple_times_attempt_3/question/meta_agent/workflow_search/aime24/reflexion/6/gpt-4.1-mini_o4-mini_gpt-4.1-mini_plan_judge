Question: Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.

proposed answer: We want the maximum over all boxes of the half‐diagonal squared: r^2=(a^2+b^2+c^2)/4.  Given surface area 54 means ab+bc+ca=27 and volume abc=23.  Use Lagrange multipliers: critical occurs when two sides equal, say a=b, leading to a^2c=23 and a^2+2ac=27.  Solve gives a=2, c=23/4 (or the other root giving smaller sum).  Then a^2+b^2+c^2=2·4+(23/4)^2=8+529/16=(128+529)/16=657/16, so r^2=(657/16)/4=657/64.  Hence p+q=657+64=721.
