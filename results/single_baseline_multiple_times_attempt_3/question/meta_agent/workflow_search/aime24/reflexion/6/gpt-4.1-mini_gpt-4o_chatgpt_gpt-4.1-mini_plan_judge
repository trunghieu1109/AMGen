Question: Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.

proposed answer: To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest sphere that can contain a rectangular box with given surface area and volume. Let the dimensions of the box be $x$, $y$, and $z$. The surface area is given by $2(xy + yz + zx) = 54$, and the volume is $xyz = 23$. The smallest sphere that can contain the box will have a radius equal to half the length of the box's diagonal, which is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$. We need to minimize this diagonal. We use the Lagrange multipliers method to find the minimum of $x^2 + y^2 + z^2$ subject to the constraints $2(xy + yz + zx) = 54$ and $xyz = 23$. Solving these equations, we find that the minimum occurs when $x = y = \frac{3}{2}$ and $z = \frac{46}{9}$. The diagonal is then $\sqrt{\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{46}{9}\right)^2}$. Calculating this gives $r^2 = \frac{169}{36}$. Therefore, $p = 169$ and $q = 36$, and $p + q = 205$.
