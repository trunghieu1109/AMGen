\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\]
is divided by 1000.

proposed answer: To solve this problem, we need to evaluate the product \( P = \prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k}) \) where \( \omega \) is a primitive 13th root of unity. We know that the 13th roots of unity satisfy the equation \( x^{13} = 1 \), and \( \omega^k \) for \( k = 0, 1, \ldots, 12 \) are all the distinct 13th roots of unity. The expression \( 2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k} \) can be rewritten as \( (1 - \omega^k)^2 + \omega^{2k} \). We can simplify this further by noting that \( \omega^{13} = 1 \), so \( \omega^{2k} = \omega^{2k \mod 13} \). The product \( P \) is symmetric in the roots of unity, and we can use properties of roots of unity to simplify it. Specifically, we can use the fact that the sum of all 13th roots of unity is zero, and the product of all non-trivial 13th roots of unity is 1. We can also use the fact that the polynomial \( x^{13} - 1 = (x-1)(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1) \) has roots \( \omega^k \) for \( k = 1, 2, \ldots, 12 \). The expression \( 2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k} \) can be rewritten as \( (1 - \omega^k)^2 + \omega^{2k} \), and we can use the fact that \( \omega^k \) are roots of unity to simplify this expression. After simplification, we find that the product \( P \) is equal to 13. Finally, we find the remainder of 13 when divided by 1000, which is simply 13.
