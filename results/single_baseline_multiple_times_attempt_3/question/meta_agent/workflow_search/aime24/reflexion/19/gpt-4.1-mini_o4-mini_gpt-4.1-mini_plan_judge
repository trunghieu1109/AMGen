\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\]
is divided by 1000.

proposed answer: We wish to compute P=∏_{k=0}^{12}(2−2ω^k+ω^{2k}) where ω runs over all 13th roots of unity.  Rewrite the factor as f(z)=z^2−2z+2.  Then P=∏ f(ζ) over ζ^13=1 = resultant(z^13−1,f(z)).  Equivalently P=∏_{f(α)=0}(α^13−1).  The roots of f are α=1±i.  Compute (1+i)^13 and (1−i)^13 via polar form: 1+i=√2 e^{iπ/4} ⇒(1+i)^13=2^{13/2}e^{i13π/4}=2^6√2 e^{i5π/4}=−64(1+i).  Thus (1+i)^13−1=−65−64i.  Its conjugate for 1−i is (1−i)^13−1=−65+64i.  Their product is (−65−64i)(−65+64i)=65^2+64^2=4225+4096=8321.  Finally 8321 mod 1000=321.
