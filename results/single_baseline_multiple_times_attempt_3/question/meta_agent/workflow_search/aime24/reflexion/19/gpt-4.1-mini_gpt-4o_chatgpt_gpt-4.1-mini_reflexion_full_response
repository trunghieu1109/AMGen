Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent XGp2', content='To solve this problem, we need to evaluate the product \\( P = \\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\\omega^k+\\omega^{2k}) \\) where \\( \\omega \\) is a primitive 13th root of unity.

Specifically, we can use the fact that the sum of all 13th roots of unity is zero, and the product of all non-trivial 13th roots of unity is 1.

However, the simplification step is not fully detailed, and the conclusion that the product is 13 is not justified. The product should be evaluated more carefully, considering the symmetry and properties of roots of unity. The final answer might be incorrect due to a lack of detailed calculation.\n\nGiven previous attempts and feedback, carefully consider where you could go wrong in your latest attempt.
