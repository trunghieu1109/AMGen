Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: The torus T is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis that is 6 units away from the center of the circle. This means the torus has a 'tube radius' of 3 and a 'central radius' of 6. The sphere S has a radius of 11. When the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 11 + 6 = 17. The radius of the circle of tangency, r_i, is 17 - 6 = 11. When the torus is internally tangent to the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 11 - 6 = 5. The radius of the circle of tangency, r_o, is 5 + 6 = 11. The difference r_i - r_o is 11 - 11 = 0. Therefore, the correct answer is 0, which can be written as 0/1, so m = 0 and n = 1. Therefore, m + n = 1.
