Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.\Pattern: reflexion
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent YsuA', content="The torus T is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis in the plane of the circle, at a distance 6 from the center of the circle. This means the torus has a major radius R = 6 and a minor radius r = 3.\n\nThe sphere S has radius 11.\n\nWhen the torus rests on the outside of the sphere and is tangent along a circle, the circle of tangency lies on the torus. The torus is tangent to the sphere externally along a circle of radius r_i in one position and radius r_o in another position.\n\nThe torus can be thought of as a set of points at a distance r = 3 from a circle of radius R = 6 in the xy-plane.\n\nThe sphere has radius 11, and the torus is tangent to it externally. The torus can be placed so that the circle of revolution is at a distance d from the center of the sphere.\n\nThe torus is tangent to the sphere along a circle. The radius of this circle of tangency on the torus is the radius of the circle on the torus where the sphere touches it.\n\nThe torus is defined by points at distance r = 3 from a circle of radius R = 6 centered at the origin.\n\nThe sphere has radius 11.\n\nWhen the torus is tangent to the sphere externally, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus's generating circle is d.\n\nThe torus's generating circle center is at distance d from the sphere center.\n\nThe sphere and torus are tangent along a circle on the torus. The radius of this circle on the torus is the radius of the circle of points on the torus at a fixed distance from the axis.\n\nThe torus has two circles of latitude where the sphere can be tangent: the inner circle (closer to the axis) and the outer circle (farther from the axis).\n\nThe radius of the circle of tangency on the torus is given by the distance from the axis of revolution to the circle of tangency minus or plus the minor radius r = 3.\n\nThe sphere radius is 11.\n\nThe distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus's generating circle is d.\n\nThe sphere and torus are tangent externally, so the distance between the centers is equal to the sum of the sphere radius and the distance from the torus center to the point of tangency.\n\nThe torus is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 centered at (6,0) around the z-axis.\n\nThe torus surface points satisfy (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6)^2 + z^2 = 9.\n\nThe sphere is centered at the origin with radius 11.\n\nThe torus is tangent to the sphere along a circle where the distance from the origin to the torus surface is 11.\n\nThe distance from the origin to a point on the torus is sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2).\n\nOn the torus, sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = R + r cos(theta) = 6 + 3 cos(theta), and z = r sin(theta) = 3 sin(theta).\n\nSo the distance from the origin to a point on the torus is sqrt((6 + 3 cos(theta))^2 + (3 sin(theta))^2) = sqrt((6 + 3 cos(theta))^2 + 9 sin^2(theta))\n\nSimplify inside the sqrt:\n(6 + 3 cos(theta))^2 + 9 sin^2(theta) = 36 + 36 cos(theta) + 9 cos^2(theta) + 9 sin^2(theta) = 36 + 36 cos(theta) + 9 (cos^2(theta) + sin^2(theta)) = 36 + 36 cos(theta) + 9 = 45 + 36 cos(theta)\n\nSo the distance from the origin to a point on the torus is sqrt(45 + 36 cos(theta)).\n\nWe want this distance to be equal to the sphere radius 11:\n\nsqrt(45 + 36 cos(theta)) = 11\n\nSquare both sides:\n45 + 36 cos(theta) = 121\n\n36 cos(theta) = 76\n\ncos(theta) = 76 / 36 = 19 / 9 > 1, which is impossible.\n\nSo the torus cannot be tangent to the sphere at points on the torus surface where the distance from the origin is 11.\n\nWait, this suggests a problem with the initial assumption.\n\nActually, the torus is tangent to the sphere along a circle, so the sphere and torus surfaces touch along a circle.\n\nThe torus is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 centered at (6,0) around the z-axis.\n\nThe sphere is centered at the origin with radius 11.\n\nThe torus is tangent to the sphere externally along a circle.\n\nThe circle of tangency lies on the torus, and the radius of this circle on the torus is r_i or r_o.\n\nThe circle of tangency is a circle of latitude on the torus, i.e., a circle obtained by fixing the angle theta in the generating circle.\n\nThe radius of such a circle is the distance from the z-axis to the point on the generating circle, which is R + r cos(theta) = 6 + 3 cos(theta).\n\nThe sphere radius is 11.\n\nThe distance from the origin to the point on the torus is sqrt((6 + 3 cos(theta))^2 + (3 sin(theta))^2) = sqrt(45 + 36 cos(theta)) as above.\n\nThe sphere radius is 11.\n\nThe torus is tangent to the sphere externally along a circle, so the distance from the origin to the circle of tangency is equal to the sphere radius plus or minus the minor radius 3.\n\nWait, the torus is the set of points at distance 3 from the circle of radius 6 in the xy-plane.\n\nThe sphere is centered at the origin with radius 11.\n\nThe torus is tangent to the sphere externally along a circle.\n\nThe circle of tangency is a circle on the torus at radius R + r cos(theta) = 6 + 3 cos(theta).\n\nThe distance from the origin to the center of this circle is 6 + 3 cos(theta).\n\nThe sphere radius is 11.\n\nThe torus is tangent to the sphere externally along this circle, so the distance from the origin to the center of the circle plus the radius of the circle of tangency on the torus equals the sphere radius.\n\nThe radius of the circle of tangency on the torus is the minor radius times sin(phi), but since the circle of tangency is a circle of latitude, its radius is r sin(phi) = 3 sin(phi).\n\nBut the problem states the torus is tangent to the sphere along a circle with radius r_i or r_o.\n\nThe radius of the circle of tangency on the torus is the radius of the circle of latitude, which is r sin(phi).\n\nBut the problem gives the torus as generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis at distance 6.\n\nThe torus has two special circles: the inner circle (radius R - r = 3) and the outer circle (radius R + r = 9).\n\nWhen the torus rests on the outside of the sphere, it is tangent along a circle with radius r_i (inner) and r_o (outer).\n\nThe difference r_i - r_o is what we want.\n\nThe sphere radius is 11.\n\nThe torus is tangent to the sphere externally along a circle of radius r_i or r_o.\n\nThe distance from the origin to the center of the torus's generating circle is d.\n\nThe torus is tangent to the sphere externally, so the distance from the origin to the center of the generating circle plus or minus the minor radius equals the sphere radius.\n\nSo for the inner tangent circle:\n\nDistance from origin to center of generating circle - minor radius = sphere radius\n\nFor the outer tangent circle:\n\nDistance from origin to center of generating circle + minor radius = sphere radius\n\nBut the generating circle is at distance 6 from the origin.\n\nSo:\n\nFor inner tangent circle:\n6 - 3 = 3, which is less than 11, so no.\n\nFor outer tangent circle:\n6 + 3 = 9, which is less than 11, so no.\n\nSo the torus must be shifted vertically to be tangent to the sphere.\n\nLet the torus be shifted vertically by h.\n\nThen the distance from the origin to the center of the generating circle is sqrt(6^2 + h^2) = sqrt(36 + h^2).\n\nThe torus is tangent to the sphere externally along a circle of radius r_i or r_o.\n\nThe sphere radius is 11.\n\nThe torus is tangent to the sphere along a circle where the distance from the origin to the center of the generating circle plus or minus the minor radius equals 11.\n\nSo:\n\nsqrt(36 + h^2) + 3 = 11  (outer tangent)\n\nsqrt(36 + h^2) - 3 = 11  (inner tangent)\n\nSolve for h in each case:\n\n1) sqrt(36 + h^2) + 3 = 11\nsqrt(36 + h^2) = 8\n36 + h^2 = 64\nh^2 = 28\nh = sqrt(28) = 2 sqrt(7)\n\n2) sqrt(36 + h^2) - 3 = 11\nsqrt(36 + h^2) = 14\n36 + h^2 = 196\nh^2 = 160\nh = 4 sqrt(10)\n\nThe radius of the circle of tangency on the torus is the radius of the circle of latitude, which is R + r cos(theta) = distance from z-axis to the circle of tangency.\n\nBut the radius of the circle of tangency is the radius of the circle on the torus where the sphere touches it.\n\nThe radius of the circle of tangency is the radius of the circle of latitude, which is the distance from the z-axis to the point on the torus.\n\nThe radius of the circle of tangency is the distance from the z-axis to the circle of latitude, which is R + r cos(theta).\n\nBut the vertical shift h corresponds to the angle theta in the generating circle:\n\nh = r sin(theta)\n\nSo sin(theta) = h / r\n\nFor the two cases:\n\n1) h = 2 sqrt(7), r = 3\nsin(theta) = 2 sqrt(7) / 3\n\n2) h = 4 sqrt(10), r = 3\nsin(theta) = 4 sqrt(10) / 3 > 1, impossible.\n\nSo only the first case is possible.\n\nThen cos(theta) = sqrt(1 - sin^2(theta)) = sqrt(1 - (4*7)/9) = sqrt(1 - 28/9) = sqrt((9 - 28)/9) = sqrt(-19/9), impossible.\n\nSo this approach is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, the problem is a classic one where the torus is tangent to the sphere externally along two circles, one inner and one outer.\n\nThe radii of these circles are R - r and R + r, i.e., 3 and 9.\n\nThe sphere radius is 11.\n\nThe difference r_i - r_o is (R + r) - (R - r) = 2r = 6.\n\nBut the problem says the difference can be written as m/n.\n\nSo the difference is 6.\n\nTherefore, m = 6, n = 1, m + n = 7.\n\nAnswer:7", prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
