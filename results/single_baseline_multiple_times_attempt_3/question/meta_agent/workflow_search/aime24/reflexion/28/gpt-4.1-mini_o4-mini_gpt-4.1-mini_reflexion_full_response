Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.\Pattern: reflexion
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent uALX', content='Place the torus axis along the z–axis, with its center at (0,0,h).  Write the torus as (√(x²+y²)−6)²+(z−h)²=9 and the sphere as x²+y²+z²=121.  At a tangency circle we require the two surfaces intersect and have parallel normals.  From the normals we get z=(ρh)/6 where ρ=√(x²+y²).  Substituting into the sphere gives ρ²(h²+36)=4356, and into the torus gives a quadratic that reduces to h⁴−188h²+4480=0.  Hence h²=28 or 160.  Then ρ=(3h²+444)/(h²+36) is 33/4 for h²=28 (torus inside) and 33/7 for h²=160 (torus outside).  Thus r_i−r_o=33/4−33/7=99/28, so m+n=99+28=127.\n\nAnswer:127', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
