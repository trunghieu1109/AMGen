Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: The torus T is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis in the plane of the circle, at a distance 6 from the center of the circle. This means the torus has a major radius R = 6 and a minor radius r = 3.

The sphere S has radius 11.

When the torus rests on the outside of the sphere and is tangent along a circle, the circle of tangency lies on the torus. The torus is tangent to the sphere externally along a circle of radius r_i in one position and radius r_o in another position.

The torus can be thought of as a set of points at a distance r = 3 from a circle of radius R = 6 in the xy-plane.

The sphere has radius 11, and the torus is tangent to it externally. The torus can be placed so that the circle of revolution is at a distance d from the center of the sphere.

The torus is tangent to the sphere along a circle. The radius of this circle of tangency on the torus is the radius of the circle on the torus where the sphere touches it.

The torus is defined by points at distance r = 3 from a circle of radius R = 6 centered at the origin.

The sphere has radius 11.

When the torus is tangent to the sphere externally, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus's generating circle is d.

The torus's generating circle center is at distance d from the sphere center.

The sphere and torus are tangent along a circle on the torus. The radius of this circle on the torus is the radius of the circle of points on the torus at a fixed distance from the axis.

The torus has two circles of latitude where the sphere can be tangent: the inner circle (closer to the axis) and the outer circle (farther from the axis).

The radius of the circle of tangency on the torus is given by the distance from the axis of revolution to the circle of tangency minus or plus the minor radius r = 3.

The sphere radius is 11.

The distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus's generating circle is d.

The sphere and torus are tangent externally, so the distance between the centers is equal to the sum of the sphere radius and the distance from the torus center to the point of tangency.

The torus is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 centered at (6,0) around the z-axis.

The torus surface points satisfy (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6)^2 + z^2 = 9.

The sphere is centered at the origin with radius 11.

The torus is tangent to the sphere along a circle where the distance from the origin to the torus surface is 11.

The distance from the origin to a point on the torus is sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2).

On the torus, sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = R + r cos(theta) = 6 + 3 cos(theta), and z = r sin(theta) = 3 sin(theta).

So the distance from the origin to a point on the torus is sqrt((6 + 3 cos(theta))^2 + (3 sin(theta))^2) = sqrt((6 + 3 cos(theta))^2 + 9 sin^2(theta))

Simplify inside the sqrt:
(6 + 3 cos(theta))^2 + 9 sin^2(theta) = 36 + 36 cos(theta) + 9 cos^2(theta) + 9 sin^2(theta) = 36 + 36 cos(theta) + 9 (cos^2(theta) + sin^2(theta)) = 36 + 36 cos(theta) + 9 = 45 + 36 cos(theta)

So the distance from the origin to a point on the torus is sqrt(45 + 36 cos(theta)).

We want this distance to be equal to the sphere radius 11:

sqrt(45 + 36 cos(theta)) = 11

Square both sides:
45 + 36 cos(theta) = 121

36 cos(theta) = 76

cos(theta) = 76 / 36 = 19 / 9 > 1, which is impossible.

So the torus cannot be tangent to the sphere at points on the torus surface where the distance from the origin is 11.

Wait, this suggests a problem with the initial assumption.

Actually, the torus is tangent to the sphere along a circle, so the sphere and torus surfaces touch along a circle.

The torus is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 centered at (6,0) around the z-axis.

The sphere is centered at the origin with radius 11.

The torus is tangent to the sphere externally along a circle.

The circle of tangency lies on the torus, and the radius of this circle on the torus is r_i or r_o.

The circle of tangency is a circle of latitude on the torus, i.e., a circle obtained by fixing the angle theta in the generating circle.

The radius of such a circle is the distance from the z-axis to the point on the generating circle, which is R + r cos(theta) = 6 + 3 cos(theta).

The sphere radius is 11.

The distance from the origin to the point on the torus is sqrt((6 + 3 cos(theta))^2 + (3 sin(theta))^2) = sqrt(45 + 36 cos(theta)) as above.

The sphere radius is 11.

The torus is tangent to the sphere externally along a circle, so the distance from the origin to the circle of tangency is equal to the sphere radius plus or minus the minor radius 3.

Wait, the torus is the set of points at distance 3 from the circle of radius 6 in the xy-plane.

The sphere is centered at the origin with radius 11.

The torus is tangent to the sphere externally along a circle.

The circle of tangency is a circle on the torus at radius R + r cos(theta) = 6 + 3 cos(theta).

The distance from the origin to the center of this circle is 6 + 3 cos(theta).

The sphere radius is 11.

The torus is tangent to the sphere externally along this circle, so the distance from the origin to the center of the circle plus the radius of the circle of tangency on the torus equals the sphere radius.

The radius of the circle of tangency on the torus is the minor radius times sin(phi), but since the circle of tangency is a circle of latitude, its radius is r sin(phi) = 3 sin(phi).

But the problem states the torus is tangent to the sphere along a circle with radius r_i or r_o.

The radius of the circle of tangency on the torus is the radius of the circle of latitude, which is r sin(phi).

But the problem gives the torus as generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis at distance 6.

The torus has two special circles: the inner circle (radius R - r = 3) and the outer circle (radius R + r = 9).

When the torus rests on the outside of the sphere, it is tangent along a circle with radius r_i (inner) and r_o (outer).

The difference r_i - r_o is what we want.

The sphere radius is 11.

The torus is tangent to the sphere externally along a circle of radius r_i or r_o.

The distance from the origin to the center of the torus's generating circle is d.

The torus is tangent to the sphere externally, so the distance from the origin to the center of the generating circle plus or minus the minor radius equals the sphere radius.

So for the inner tangent circle:

Distance from origin to center of generating circle - minor radius = sphere radius

For the outer tangent circle:

Distance from origin to center of generating circle + minor radius = sphere radius

But the generating circle is at distance 6 from the origin.

So:

For inner tangent circle:
6 - 3 = 3, which is less than 11, so no.

For outer tangent circle:
6 + 3 = 9, which is less than 11, so no.

So the torus must be shifted vertically to be tangent to the sphere.

Let the torus be shifted vertically by h.

Then the distance from the origin to the center of the generating circle is sqrt(6^2 + h^2) = sqrt(36 + h^2).

The torus is tangent to the sphere externally along a circle of radius r_i or r_o.

The sphere radius is 11.

The torus is tangent to the sphere along a circle where the distance from the origin to the center of the generating circle plus or minus the minor radius equals 11.

So:

sqrt(36 + h^2) + 3 = 11  (outer tangent)

sqrt(36 + h^2) - 3 = 11  (inner tangent)

Solve for h in each case:

1) sqrt(36 + h^2) + 3 = 11
sqrt(36 + h^2) = 8
36 + h^2 = 64
h^2 = 28
h = sqrt(28) = 2 sqrt(7)

2) sqrt(36 + h^2) - 3 = 11
sqrt(36 + h^2) = 14
36 + h^2 = 196
h^2 = 160
h = 4 sqrt(10)

The radius of the circle of tangency on the torus is the radius of the circle of latitude, which is R + r cos(theta) = distance from z-axis to the circle of tangency.

But the radius of the circle of tangency is the radius of the circle on the torus where the sphere touches it.

The radius of the circle of tangency is the radius of the circle of latitude, which is the distance from the z-axis to the point on the torus.

The radius of the circle of tangency is the distance from the z-axis to the circle of latitude, which is R + r cos(theta).

But the vertical shift h corresponds to the angle theta in the generating circle:

h = r sin(theta)

So sin(theta) = h / r

For the two cases:

1) h = 2 sqrt(7), r = 3
sin(theta) = 2 sqrt(7) / 3

2) h = 4 sqrt(10), r = 3
sin(theta) = 4 sqrt(10) / 3 > 1, impossible.

So only the first case is possible.

Then cos(theta) = sqrt(1 - sin^2(theta)) = sqrt(1 - (4*7)/9) = sqrt(1 - 28/9) = sqrt((9 - 28)/9) = sqrt(-19/9), impossible.

So this approach is invalid.

Alternatively, the problem is a classic one where the torus is tangent to the sphere externally along two circles, one inner and one outer.

The radii of these circles are R - r and R + r, i.e., 3 and 9.

The sphere radius is 11.

The difference r_i - r_o is (R + r) - (R - r) = 2r = 6.

But the problem says the difference can be written as m/n.

So the difference is 6.

Therefore, m = 6, n = 1, m + n = 7.
