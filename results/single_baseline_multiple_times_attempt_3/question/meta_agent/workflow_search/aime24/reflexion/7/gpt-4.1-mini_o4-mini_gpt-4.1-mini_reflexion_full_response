Question: There exist real numbers $x$ and $y$, both greater than 1, such that $\log_x\left(y^x\right)=\log_y\left(x^{4y}\right)=10$. Find $xy$.\Pattern: reflexion
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent tSEE', content='We set log_x(y^x)=10 => x ln y=10 ln x, and log_y(x^{4y})=10 =>4y ln x=10 ln y. From these, ln y =10 ln x /x and ln y = (2/5)y ln x. Equating gives y=25/x, so xy=25.\n\nAnswer:25', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
