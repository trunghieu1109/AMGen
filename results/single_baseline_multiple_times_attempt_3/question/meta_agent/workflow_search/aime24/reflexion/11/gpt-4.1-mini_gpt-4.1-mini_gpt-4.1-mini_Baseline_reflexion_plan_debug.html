    <pre>We are considering paths from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an 8x8 grid. Each path consists of 16 steps: 8 steps to the right (R) and 8 steps up (U). We want to count the number of such paths that change direction exactly 4 times. A change of direction means switching from R to U or from U to R. Since the path has 16 steps, and exactly 4 changes of direction, the path is divided into 5 segments (because the number of segments = number of changes + 1). Each segment consists of steps all in the same direction (either all R or all U). The path must start at the lower left corner and end at the upper right corner, so the total number of R steps is 8 and total number of U steps is 8. The segments alternate directions, so if the first segment is R, the second is U, the third is R, the fourth is U, and the fifth is R; or if the first segment is U, the second is R, the third is U, the fourth is R, and the fifth is U. But since the total number of R steps is 8 and total number of U steps is 8, and there are 5 segments, the segments must be arranged so that the total R steps sum to 8 and total U steps sum to 8. The number of segments is 5, so the segments alternate directions. The number of segments of each direction depends on whether the path starts with R or U. If the path starts with R, the segments are R-U-R-U-R, so there are 3 R segments and 2 U segments. If the path starts with U, the segments are U-R-U-R-U, so there are 3 U segments and 2 R segments. We must consider both cases. For the first case (start with R): We have 3 R segments summing to 8 steps, and 2 U segments summing to 8 steps. The number of positive integer solutions to x1 + x2 + x3 = 8 is C(8-1,3-1) = C(7,2) = 21. The number of positive integer solutions to y1 + y2 = 8 is C(8-1,2-1) = C(7,1) = 7. So the number of ways for the first case is 21 * 7 = 147. For the second case (start with U): We have 3 U segments summing to 8 steps, and 2 R segments summing to 8 steps. By the same calculation, the number of ways is also 21 * 7 = 147. Total number of paths with exactly 4 changes of direction is 147 + 147 = 294.
