Question: Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.
[asy] size(10cm); usepackage("tikz");label("\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(2,0)--(2,3)--(5,3)--(5,8)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}",origin); label("\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(0,3)--(3,3)--(3,5)--(8,5)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}",E); [/asy]

proposed answer: We need the number of monotonic paths from (0,0) to (8,8) with exactly 4 direction changes. A change count of 4 implies the path is made of 5 alternating runs of rights (R) and ups (U). The path may start with R or U. If it starts with R, there are 3 R‐runs summing to 8 steps (compositions of 8 into 3 positive parts: C(7,2)=21) and 2 U‐runs summing to 8 (compositions into 2 positive parts: C(7,1)=7), giving 21·7=147. The same count holds if starting with U. Total = 147·2 = 294.
