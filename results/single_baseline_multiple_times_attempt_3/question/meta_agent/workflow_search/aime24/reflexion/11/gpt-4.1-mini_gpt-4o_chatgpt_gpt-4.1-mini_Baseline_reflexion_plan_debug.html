    <pre>To solve this problem, we need to find the number of paths from the lower left corner to the upper right corner of an 8x8 grid that change direction exactly four times. A path from (0,0) to (8,8) consists of 8 right (R) moves and 8 up (U) moves, totaling 16 moves. Changing direction means switching from R to U or from U to R. If a path changes direction exactly four times, it can be broken into five segments, each consisting of consecutive R&#39;s or U&#39;s. We need to distribute 8 R&#39;s and 8 U&#39;s into these five segments. The segments can be of the form R-U-R-U-R or U-R-U-R-U. We can choose the number of R&#39;s in the first segment (k1), the number of U&#39;s in the second segment (k2), the number of R&#39;s in the third segment (k3), the number of U&#39;s in the fourth segment (k4), and the number of R&#39;s in the fifth segment (k5). The constraints are k1 + k3 + k5 = 8 and k2 + k4 = 8, with each k_i being positive. The number of solutions to k1 + k3 + k5 = 8 with k1, k3, k5 &gt; 0 is the number of solutions to x1 + x2 + x3 = 5 with x1, x2, x3 &gt;= 0, which is C(5+2, 2) = C(7, 2) = 21. Similarly, the number of solutions to k2 + k4 = 8 with k2, k4 &gt; 0 is the number of solutions to y1 + y2 = 6 with y1, y2 &gt;= 0, which is C(6+1, 1) = C(7, 1) = 7. Therefore, the total number of paths is 21 * 7 = 147. Since the path can start with either R or U, we multiply by 2, giving 2 * 147 = 294.
