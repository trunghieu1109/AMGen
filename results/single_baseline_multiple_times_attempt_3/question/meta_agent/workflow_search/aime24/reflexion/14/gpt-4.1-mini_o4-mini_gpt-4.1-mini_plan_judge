Question: Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.

proposed answer: We parametrize the rhombus with vertices A, B, C, D on the hyperbola x^2/20 - y^2/24 =1 so that diagonals intersect at the origin.  Then C = -A, D = -B, and side equality |B-A|=|A+B| ⇒ A·B=0.  For a given B=(u,v), existence of A requires the line through the origin perpendicular to B (u x + v y=0) to meet the hyperbola, giving the condition 6v^2>5u^2.  We seek the minimal BD^2 =4(u^2+v^2) under u^2/20 - v^2/24=1 and 6v^2>5u^2.  No interior stationary point exists, so the minimum occurs when the line is tangent: 6v^2=5u^2.  Solving u^2/20 - v^2/24=1 with v^2=(5/6)u^2 yields u^2=720/11, v^2=600/11, so u^2+v^2=1320/11=120 and BD^2=4·120=480.  For all rhombi BD^2>480, so the greatest real number less than every BD^2 is 480.
