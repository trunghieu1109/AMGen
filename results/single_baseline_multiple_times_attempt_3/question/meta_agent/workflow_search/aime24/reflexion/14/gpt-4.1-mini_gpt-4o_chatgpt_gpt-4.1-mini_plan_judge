Question: Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.

proposed answer: The hyperbola is given by \( \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \). The diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola. The diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. The points on the hyperbola can be parameterized as \( (x, y) = (\sqrt{20} \cosh(t), \sqrt{24} \sinh(t)) \). The diagonals are along the asymptotes of the hyperbola, which are \( y = \pm \sqrt{1.2} x \). The length of the diagonal \( AC \) is \( 2\sqrt{20} \cosh(t) \) and the length of the diagonal \( BD \) is \( 2\sqrt{24} \sinh(t) \). The product of the lengths of the diagonals is constant for a rhombus, so \( 2\sqrt{20} \cosh(t) \cdot 2\sqrt{24} \sinh(t) = 2 \times 2 \times \sqrt{20 \times 24} \). We want to maximize \( BD^2 = (2\sqrt{24} \sinh(t))^2 = 96 \sinh^2(t) \). Using the identity \( \cosh^2(t) - \sinh^2(t) = 1 \), we have \( \cosh(t) = \sqrt{1 + \sinh^2(t)} \). The maximum value of \( \sinh^2(t) \) occurs when \( \cosh(t) \) is minimized, which is when \( \cosh(t) = \sqrt{2} \). Therefore, the maximum value of \( \sinh^2(t) \) is 1, and the maximum value of \( BD^2 \) is 96. The greatest real number less than this is 95.
