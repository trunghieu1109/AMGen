    <pre>Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice&#39;s play.

    <pre>We have a game where two players, Alice and Bob, take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens from a stack of n tokens. Alice goes first. The player who takes the last token wins. We want to find the number of positive integers n ≤ 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy regardless of Alice&#39;s moves. This means that for these values of n, the position is losing for the first player (Alice) at the start of the game. Let&#39;s analyze the game using the concept of winning and losing positions in combinatorial game theory. A position is losing if the player to move has no winning moves, and winning if there is at least one move to a losing position. Define: - W(n): position with n tokens is winning for the player to move. - L(n): position with n tokens is losing for the player to move. Base case: - n=0: no tokens to remove, so the player to move loses. So L(0) = losing position. For n &gt; 0: - W(n) if there exists a move removing 1 or 4 tokens to a losing position. - L(n) if all moves lead to winning positions. Let&#39;s compute the first few values: n=0: L(0) = losing (no tokens) n=1: moves: remove 1 → n=0 (L) → W(1) = winning n=2: moves: remove 1 → n=1 (W), remove 4 not possible → all moves lead to W → L(2) n=3: moves: remove 1 → n=2 (L), remove 4 not possible → W(3) n=4: moves: remove 1 → n=3 (W), remove 4 → n=0 (L) → W(4) n=5: moves: remove 1 → n=4 (W), remove 4 → n=1 (W) → all moves lead to W → L(5) n=6: moves: remove 1 → n=5 (L), remove 4 → n=2 (L) → W(6) n=7: moves: remove 1 → n=6 (W), remove 4 → n=3 (W) → all moves lead to W → L(7) n=8: moves: remove 1 → n=7 (L), remove 4 → n=4 (W) → W(8) n=9: moves: remove 1 → n=8 (W), remove 4 → n=5 (L) → W(9) n=10: moves: remove 1 → n=9 (W), remove 4 → n=6 (W) → all moves lead to W → L(10) Let&#39;s list the losing positions found: 0, 2, 5, 7, 10 ... Let&#39;s check the pattern: 0, 2, 5, 7, 10. Differences: 2-0=2, 5-2=3, 7-5=2, 10-7=3. Pattern of differences alternates between 2 and 3. Let&#39;s check more values to confirm: n=11: remove 1 → 10(L), remove 4 → 7(L) → W(11) n=12: remove 1 → 11(W), remove 4 → 8(W) → L(12) no, wait, 8 is W, 11 is W, so all moves lead to W → L(12) Wait, that contradicts the previous pattern. Let&#39;s carefully check n=12: remove 1 → 11(W), remove 4 → 8(W), both W → L(12) So losing positions are: 0, 2, 5, 7, 10, 12. Differences: 2,3,2,3,2. Pattern seems to be losing positions at n where n mod 5 is 0 or 2. Let&#39;s check that: 0 mod 5 = 0 (losing) 2 mod 5 = 2 (losing) 5 mod 5 = 0 (losing) 7 mod 5 = 2 (losing) 10 mod 5 = 0 (losing) 12 mod 5 = 2 (losing) So losing positions are those where n mod 5 = 0 or 2. Since Alice moves first, if the initial position is losing for the first player, Bob has a winning strategy. So Bob wins if n mod 5 = 0 or 2. We want to count positive integers n ≤ 2024 such that n mod 5 = 0 or 2. Count of n ≤ 2024 with n mod 5 = 0: numbers divisible by 5 up to 2024 is floor(2024/5) = 404 Count of n ≤ 2024 with n mod 5 = 2: numbers of the form 5k + 2 ≤ 2024. Max k satisfies 5k + 2 ≤ 2024 → 5k ≤ 2022 → k ≤ 404.4 → k=404 So count is 405 (k=0 to 404) Total count = 404 + 405 = 809
