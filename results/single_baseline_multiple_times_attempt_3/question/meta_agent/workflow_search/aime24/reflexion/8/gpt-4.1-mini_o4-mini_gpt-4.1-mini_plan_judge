Question: Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: We identify losing (P-)positions for the first player (Alice) with tokens n as those where no move (removing 1 or 4) goes to another P-position. 0 is P, and for n≥1, n is P iff both n−1 and n−4 (if ≥0) are N. Computing small values shows P-positions form the arithmetic progression mod 5: n≡0 or 2 (mod 5). Thus for 1≤n≤2024, the count of n≡0 mod 5 is ⌊2024/5⌋=404, and of n≡2 mod 5 is also 405, totaling 809. Hence Bob (second player) wins exactly for these 809 values.
