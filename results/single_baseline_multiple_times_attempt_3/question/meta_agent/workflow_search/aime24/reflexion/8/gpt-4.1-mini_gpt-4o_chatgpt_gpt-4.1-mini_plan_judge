Question: Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.

proposed answer: To solve this problem, we need to determine the losing positions for Alice, which are the positions where Bob can guarantee a win regardless of Alice's moves. A position is losing if every move from that position leads to a winning position for the opponent. Conversely, a position is winning if there is at least one move that leads to a losing position for the opponent. We start by identifying the base cases: if n = 0, Alice cannot make a move, so she loses, making n = 0 a losing position. For n = 1, Alice can take 1 token and win, so n = 1 is a winning position. For n = 2, Alice can take 1 token, leaving 1 token for Bob, which is a winning position for Bob, so n = 2 is a losing position. For n = 3, Alice can take 1 token, leaving 2 tokens for Bob, which is a losing position for Bob, so n = 3 is a winning position. For n = 4, Alice can take 4 tokens and win, so n = 4 is a winning position. For n = 5, Alice can take 4 tokens, leaving 1 token for Bob, which is a winning position for Bob, so n = 5 is a losing position. We continue this process to find a pattern. We observe that the losing positions are those where n is congruent to 2 mod 3. Therefore, we need to count the number of integers n <= 2024 that are congruent to 2 mod 3. The sequence of losing positions is 2, 5, 8, ..., which is an arithmetic sequence with the first term 2 and common difference 3. The general term of this sequence is 2 + 3k, where k is a non-negative integer. We need to find the largest k such that 2 + 3k <= 2024. Solving 2 + 3k <= 2024 gives k <= (2024 - 2) / 3 = 674. Therefore, k ranges from 0 to 674, inclusive, giving us 675 values of n that are losing positions for Alice and winning positions for Bob.
