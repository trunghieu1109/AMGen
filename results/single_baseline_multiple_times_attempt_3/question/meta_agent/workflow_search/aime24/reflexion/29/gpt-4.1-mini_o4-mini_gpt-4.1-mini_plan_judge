Question: There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\times5$ grid such that: 

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: Label each of the 5 rows and 5 columns with a color (white or black).  Then place a chip in exactly those cells where the row-color and column-color agree; leave the other cells empty.  In any empty cell, the row and column have opposite colors, so neither a white nor a black chip can be added without violating uniformity.  Conversely every maximal arrangement arises this way.  There are 2^5 choices for the row‐colors and 2^5 for the column‐colors, giving 2^5·2^5=1024.
