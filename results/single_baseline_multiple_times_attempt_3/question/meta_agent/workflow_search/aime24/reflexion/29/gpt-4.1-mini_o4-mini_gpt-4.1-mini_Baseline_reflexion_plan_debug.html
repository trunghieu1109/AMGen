    <pre>There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\times5$ grid such that: 

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.

### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent FoK8 (yourself):
We need maximal placements so that every row and column that ‘‘has’’ a color assignment actually places at least one chip, and no empty cell can accept a chip without conflict.  One shows that a maximal configuration is determined by assigning each of the 5 rows and each of the 5 columns a color (white or black), with the requirement that if any rows are assigned white then some columns must also be white (and vice versa), and similarly for black.  Equivalently, let r_W=# white rows and c_W=# white columns.  We must have either (r_W,c_W) both zero (all black) or both 5 (all white) or both in {1,…,4}.  For each valid (r_W,c_W) the number of choices is C(5,r_W)·C(5,c_W), and summing over the valid pairs (including (0,0) and (5,5)) gives
∑_{i=1..4}
∑_{j=1..4}C(5,i)C(5,j)
+ C(5,0)^2 + C(5,5)^2
=30^2 + 1 + 1 = 902

### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent FoK8 (yourself):
902

### feedback #1 by Critic Agent kAJo:
The solution wrongly assumes that having white rows forces at least one white column (and similarly for black). In fact, any subset of rows can be white (the rest black) and independently any subset of columns can be white (the rest black), yielding 2^5·2^5=1024 maximal placements. The restriction to i=j or extremes is incorrect.

Given previous attempts and feedback, carefully consider where you could go wrong in your latest attempt. Using insights from previous attempts, try to solve the task better.</pre>

    <pre>Label each of the 5 rows and 5 columns with a color (white or black).  Then place a chip in exactly those cells where the row-color and column-color agree; leave the other cells empty.  In any empty cell, the row and column have opposite colors, so neither a white nor a black chip can be added without violating uniformity.  Conversely every maximal arrangement arises this way.  There are 2^5 choices for the row‐colors and 2^5 for the column‐colors, giving 2^5·2^5=1024.
