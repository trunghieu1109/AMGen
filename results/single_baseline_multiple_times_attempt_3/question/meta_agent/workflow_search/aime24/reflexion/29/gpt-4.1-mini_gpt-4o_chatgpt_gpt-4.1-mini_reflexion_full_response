Question: There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\times5$ grid such that: 

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.\Pattern: reflexion
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent jOXK', content='To solve this problem, we need to place chips in a 5x5 grid such that each row and each column contains chips of only one color, and we cannot add any more chips without violating this condition. This means that each row and each column must be either completely filled with white chips or completely filled with black chips. Since there are 5 rows and 5 columns, we can choose any number of rows to be filled with white chips, and the remaining rows will be filled with black chips. Similarly, we can choose any number of columns to be filled with white chips, and the remaining columns will be filled with black chips. The number of ways to choose k rows to be white is \\( \\binom{5}{k} \\), and the number of ways to choose k columns to be white is also \\( \\binom{5}{k} \\). For each choice of k, there are \\( \\binom{5}{k}^2 \\) ways to choose the rows and columns. We sum this over all possible values of k from 0 to 5.\n\nAnswer:252', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
