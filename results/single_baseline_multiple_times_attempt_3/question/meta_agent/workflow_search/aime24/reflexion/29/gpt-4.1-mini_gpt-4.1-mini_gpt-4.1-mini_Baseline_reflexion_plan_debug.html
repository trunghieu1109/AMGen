    <pre>We have a 5x5 grid with 25 cells. We want to place some chips (white or black) in these cells with the following conditions:

1. Each cell contains at most one chip.
2. All chips in the same row have the same color.
3. All chips in the same column have the same color.
4. We cannot add any more chips without violating the above conditions.

Since each row&#39;s chips are all the same color and each column&#39;s chips are all the same color, the color of the chip in cell (i, j) must be the same as the color of row i and column j. This means the color of the chip in cell (i, j) is determined by the intersection of the row color and the column color.

For a chip to be placed in cell (i, j), the row i color and column j color must be the same. If they differ, no chip can be placed there.

Therefore, the grid&#39;s chip placement corresponds to choosing a color for each row and each column, and placing chips only in cells where the row and column colors match.

We have 5 rows and 5 columns, each can be colored either white or black. So there are 2^5 ways to color the rows and 2^5 ways to color the columns, total 2^5 * 2^5 = 2^{10} = 1024 ways.

However, the problem states that any additional chip placed would violate the conditions. This means the placement is maximal: no empty cell can be filled without breaking the rules.

Given the coloring, the chips are placed exactly in the cells where row and column colors match. The empty cells are those where row and column colors differ.

To be maximal, we cannot add any chip in an empty cell. Adding a chip in an empty cell would mean placing a chip where row and column colors differ, violating condition 2 or 3.

So all such placements are maximal.

But we have a constraint on the number of chips: we have only 25 white and 25 black chips available. Since the grid has 25 cells, and each cell can have at most one chip, the maximum number of chips placed is 25.

In the maximal placement, the number of chips placed is the number of cells where row and column colors match.

We must ensure that the number of white chips placed does not exceed 25, and the number of black chips placed does not exceed 25. Since total chips placed is at most 25, and we have 25 chips of each color, this is always satisfied.

Therefore, the number of valid maximal placements is the number of ways to color rows and columns with black or white, i.e., 1024.

But we must consider the case where no chips are placed (all rows and columns colored differently so no cell matches). The problem says &#39;some of these chips&#39;, so empty placement is allowed?

The problem does not forbid empty placement, but condition 4 says any additional chip placed would violate the conditions. If no chips are placed, we can add a chip anywhere, so it&#39;s not maximal.

Therefore, empty placement is not allowed.

So we exclude the case where no chips are placed.

Is it possible to have zero chips placed? Yes, if for every cell, row and column colors differ.

Is it possible to have zero chips placed? Yes, for example, if all rows are white and all columns are black, then no cell matches in color.

So we exclude this case.

Hence, total valid maximal placements = 1024 - 1 = 1023.

Therefore, the answer is 1023.
