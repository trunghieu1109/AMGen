Question: Let $p$ be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $n^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$. Find the least positive integer $m$ such that $m^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$.
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: We test primes p=2,3,5,7,11,13 and find no solution mod p. For p=17 there are solutions to n^4≡-1 mod17, which by Hensel’s lemma lift to mod 17^2=289. The lifts of n≡±2,±8 mod17 yield m=155,151,110,179. The smallest positive m is 110.
