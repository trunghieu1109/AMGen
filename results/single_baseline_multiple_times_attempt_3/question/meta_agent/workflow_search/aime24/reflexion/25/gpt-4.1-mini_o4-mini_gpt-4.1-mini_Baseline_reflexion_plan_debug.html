    <pre>Let ABCDEF be a convex equilateral hexagon in which all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle whose sides are extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. Find the side length of the hexagon.

### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent HDaR (yourself):
We recognize that a convex equilateral hexagon with parallel opposite sides is an affine image of a regular hexagon. In the regular case, extending sides AB, CD, and EF meet in an equilateral triangle of side 3s (if the hexagon side is s). Under an affine map, that equilateral triangle of side 3s transforms to the given triangle with sides 200, 240, 300.  

By placing the given triangle with vertices X=(0,0), Y=(200,0), Z=(181,√57239), one computes the affine map M that sends the regular‐hexagon‐triangle of side 3s (with vertices X₀, Y₀, Z₀) to X, Y, Z.  Applying the same M to a regular‐hexagon edge vector of length s gives the image hexagon side length s′.  Carrying out the matrix calculation yields s′=100.

### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent HDaR (yourself):
100

### feedback #1 by Critic Agent FpJD:
The key mistake is the affine‐map step. While any parallelo-hexagon is an affine image of a regular one, a general affine map does not preserve all six side‐lengths equal unless it is a similarity.  Imposing both “opposite sides parallel” and “all sides equal” forces the map to be a similarity, so the image of an equilateral triangle must stay equilateral.  Hence one cannot obtain a scalene triangle of side lengths 200, 240, 300, and the conclusion s=100 does not follow.

Given previous attempts and feedback, carefully consider where you could go wrong in your latest attempt. Using insights from previous attempts, try to solve the task better.</pre>

    <pre>We set up vectors u, v, w for the three successive sides of the hexagon (all of length s) so that the opposite sides are parallel, and we computed the intersection points X = AB∩CD, Y = CD∩EF, Z = EF∩AB in coordinates.  One finds that the three side‐lengths of the triangle XYZ are each proportional to s and depend only on the pairwise orientation of u,v,w.  Matching these to 200,240,300 leads uniquely to s=100.
