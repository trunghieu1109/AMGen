Question: Let ABCDEF be a convex equilateral hexagon in which all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle whose sides are extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. Find the side length of the hexagon.

proposed answer: The hexagon ABCDEF is equilateral and has pairs of opposite sides parallel, which means it is a symmetric hexagon. The triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. This triangle is the excentral triangle of the hexagon, meaning its sides are equal to the differences in lengths of the parallel sides of the hexagon. Since the hexagon is equilateral, all its sides are equal, and the differences in lengths of the parallel sides are equal to the side length of the hexagon. The side length of the hexagon is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the side lengths of the triangle, which is 200, 240, and 300.
