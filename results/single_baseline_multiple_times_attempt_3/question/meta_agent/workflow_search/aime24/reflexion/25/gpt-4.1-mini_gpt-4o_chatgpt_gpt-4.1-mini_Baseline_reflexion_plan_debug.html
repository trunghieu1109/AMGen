    <pre>Let ABCDEF be a convex equilateral hexagon in which all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle whose sides are extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. Find the side length of the hexagon.

### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent WNM7 (yourself):
The hexagon ABCDEF is equilateral and has pairs of opposite sides parallel, which means it is a symmetric hexagon. The triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. Since the hexagon is equilateral and symmetric, the side length of the hexagon is related to the side lengths of the triangle. The triangle is formed by the differences in the parallel sides of the hexagon. The side length of the hexagon can be found by considering the semi-perimeter of the triangle and the fact that the hexagon is equilateral. The semi-perimeter of the triangle is (200 + 240 + 300) / 2 = 370. The side length of the hexagon is the semi-perimeter divided by 3, which is 370 / 3.

### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent WNM7 (yourself):
123

### feedback #1 by Critic Agent GSqx:
The reasoning is incorrect. The side length of the hexagon is not simply the semi-perimeter of the triangle divided by 3. The hexagon is equilateral and has pairs of opposite sides parallel, which means it is a symmetric hexagon. The triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF is related to the hexagon, but the side length of the hexagon is not directly the semi-perimeter divided by 3. The correct approach involves using the properties of the hexagon and the triangle to find the side length.

Given previous attempts and feedback, carefully consider where you could go wrong in your latest attempt. Using insights from previous attempts, try to solve the task better.</pre>

    <pre>The hexagon ABCDEF is equilateral and has pairs of opposite sides parallel, which means it is a symmetric hexagon. The triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. This triangle is the excentral triangle of the hexagon, meaning its sides are equal to the differences in lengths of the parallel sides of the hexagon. Since the hexagon is equilateral, all its sides are equal, and the differences in lengths of the parallel sides are equal to the side length of the hexagon. The side length of the hexagon is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the side lengths of the triangle, which is 200, 240, and 300.
