Question: Let ABCDEF be a convex equilateral hexagon in which all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle whose sides are extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. Find the side length of the hexagon.\Pattern: reflexion
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent rAnB', content='Given a convex equilateral hexagon ABCDEF with all pairs of opposite sides parallel, the hexagon is a parallelogon. The sides AB, CD, EF are equal in length (say s) and parallel in pairs. The triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. These lengths correspond to the distances between the lines containing AB, CD, and EF. Since the hexagon is equilateral and opposite sides are parallel, the hexagon can be seen as the Minkowski sum of three vectors corresponding to the directions of AB, CD, and EF. The triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF is the triangle formed by the intersection of the three pairs of parallel lines. The side lengths of this triangle correspond to the sums of the lengths of the hexagon sides projected onto the directions perpendicular to AB, CD, and EF. Using the properties of the hexagon and the given triangle side lengths, the side length s of the hexagon can be found by solving the system derived from the triangle side lengths and the hexagon side length. The answer is 100.\n\nAnswer:100', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
