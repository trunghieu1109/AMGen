Question: Let ABCDEF be a convex equilateral hexagon in which all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle whose sides are extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. Find the side length of the hexagon.
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: We set up vectors u, v, w for the three successive sides of the hexagon (all of length s) so that the opposite sides are parallel, and we computed the intersection points X = AB∩CD, Y = CD∩EF, Z = EF∩AB in coordinates.  One finds that the three side‐lengths of the triangle XYZ are each proportional to s and depend only on the pairwise orientation of u,v,w.  Matching these to 200,240,300 leads uniquely to s=100.

Answer:100
Extracted answer: 100
Correct answer: 080
