Question: Find the number of triples of nonnegative integers \((a,b,c)\) satisfying \(a + b + c = 300\) and
\begin{equation*}
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.
\end{equation*}
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: We want nonnegative integer triples (a,b,c) with a+b+c=300 and ab(a+b)+bc(b+c)+ca(c+a)=6,000,000. Set s=a+b=300−c and p=ab. One finds the equation reduces to p=20000−100c, and the quadratic a+b=s, ab=p has discriminant (c−100)^2, giving exactly two solutions a,b=(100,200−c) up to order. Thus all solutions are permutations of (100,200−c,c) with 0≤c≤200. The unordered multisets are distinct for c=0..100 (101 choices), but c=100 gives (100,100,100) only one ordering, while for each of the other 100 multisets all three entries are distinct, yielding 6 orderings each. Total ordered triples =100·6 +1 =601.
