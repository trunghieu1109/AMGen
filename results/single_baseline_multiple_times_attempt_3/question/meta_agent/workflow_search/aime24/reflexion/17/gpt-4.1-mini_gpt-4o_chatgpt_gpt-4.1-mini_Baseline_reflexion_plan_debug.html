    <pre>We are given two equations: a + b + c = 300 and a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000. We need to find the number of nonnegative integer solutions (a, b, c) that satisfy both equations. First, note that the second equation is symmetric in a, b, and c. This suggests that solutions where a, b, and c are close to each other might be possible. Let&#39;s consider the case where a = b = c. Then a + b + c = 3a = 300, so a = 100, b = 100, c = 100. Plugging these into the second equation, we get 3(100^2 * 100) = 3(1,000,000) = 3,000,000, which is not equal to 6,000,000. So a = b = c = 100 is not a solution. Next, consider the case where two of the variables are equal and the third is different. Without loss of generality, assume a = b and c is different. Then 2a + c = 300, so c = 300 - 2a. Substitute into the second equation: a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 2a^3 + 2a^2c + c^2a = 2a^3 + 2a^2(300 - 2a) + (300 - 2a)^2a = 6,000,000. Simplifying, we get 2a^3 + 600a^2 - 4a^3 + (90000 - 1200a + 4a^2)a = 6,000,000. This simplifies to 90000a - 600a^2 + 2a^3 = 6,000,000. Solving this cubic equation for integer values of a, we find that a = 100 is a solution, giving c = 300 - 2*100 = 100. So (a, b, c) = (100, 100, 100) is a solution. However, we already checked that this does not satisfy the second equation. Let&#39;s try another approach. Consider a = 150, b = 150, c = 0. Then a + b + c = 300, and a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 150^2 * 150 + 150^2 * 0 + 150^2 * 150 + 150^2 * 0 + 0^2 * 150 + 0^2 * 150 = 2 * 150^3 = 2 * 3,375,000 = 6,750,000, which is not equal to 6,000,000. Let&#39;s try a = 200, b = 100, c = 0. Then a + b + c = 300, and a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 200^2 * 100 + 200^2 * 0 + 100^2 * 200 + 100^2 * 0 + 0^2 * 200 + 0^2 * 100 = 2 * 200^2 * 100 = 2 * 4,000,000 = 8,000,000, which is not equal to 6,000,000. Let&#39;s try a = 250, b = 25, c = 25. Then a + b + c = 300, and a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 250^2 * 25 + 250^2 * 25 + 25^2 * 250 + 25^2 * 25 + 25^2 * 250 + 25^2 * 25 = 2 * 250^2 * 25 + 2 * 25^2 * 250 + 2 * 25^2 * 25 = 2 * 62500 * 25 + 2 * 625 * 250 + 2 * 625 = 2 * 1562500 + 2 * 156250 + 2 * 625 = 3125000 + 312500 + 1250 = 3438750, which is not equal to 6,000,000. It seems that finding a solution by trial and error is not working well. Let&#39;s try another approach. Consider the case where one of the variables is 0. Without loss of generality, let c = 0. Then a + b = 300, and the second equation becomes a^2b + b^2a = 6,000,000. This can be factored as ab(a + b) = 6,000,000. Since a + b = 300, we have ab * 300 = 6,000,000, so ab = 20,000. We need to find pairs (a, b) such that a + b = 300 and ab = 20,000. Solving the quadratic equation a^2 - 300a + 20,000 = 0, we find the roots a = 200 and a = 100. Therefore, the pairs (a, b) are (200, 100) and (100, 200). Since c = 0, the solutions are (200, 100, 0) and (100, 200, 0). By symmetry, we also have (0, 200, 100) and (0, 100, 200), as well as (100, 0, 200) and (200, 0, 100). In total, there are 6 solutions.
