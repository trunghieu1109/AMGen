Question: Find the number of triples of nonnegative integers \((a,b,c)\) satisfying \(a + b + c = 300\) and
\begin{equation*}
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.
\end{equation*}
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: We are given the equation a + b + c = 300 with nonnegative integers a, b, c, and the condition a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000. First, rewrite the second equation: a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = a^2(b+c) + b^2(a+c) + c^2(a+b). Since a + b + c = 300, we have b + c = 300 - a, a + c = 300 - b, and a + b = 300 - c. Substitute these: a^2(300 - a) + b^2(300 - b) + c^2(300 - c) = 6,000,000. This expands to 300(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) - (a^3 + b^3 + c^3) = 6,000,000. We want to find all triples (a,b,c) of nonnegative integers summing to 300 satisfying this. Use the identity a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc = (a + b + c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - bc - ca). Since a + b + c = 300, we can write a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 3abc + 300(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - bc - ca). Substitute into the equation: 300(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) - [3abc + 300(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - bc - ca)] = 6,000,000. Simplify: 300(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) - 3abc - 300(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) + 300(ab + bc + ca) = 6,000,000. The 300(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) terms cancel, leaving 300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000. Divide both sides by 3: 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000. We want nonnegative integers a,b,c with a + b + c = 300 and 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000. Since a,b,c are nonnegative and sum to 300, try to find integer solutions. Consider the symmetry and try to find solutions by fixing one variable and solving for the others. After analysis, the solutions are (100,100,100) and permutations. Check (100,100,100): a + b + c = 300, ab + bc + ca = 100*100 + 100*100 + 100*100 = 3*10,000 = 30,000, abc = 100*100*100 = 1,000,000. Compute 100*30,000 - 1,000,000 = 3,000,000 - 1,000,000 = 2,000,000, which matches. So (100,100,100) is a solution. Check if other solutions exist. Try (150, 150, 0): sum=300, ab+bc+ca=150*150 + 150*0 + 0*150=22,500, abc=0, 100*22,500 - 0=2,250,000 > 2,000,000 no. Try (200, 50, 50): sum=300, ab+bc+ca=200*50 + 50*50 + 200*50=10,000 + 2,500 + 10,000=22,500, abc=200*50*50=500,000, 100*22,500 - 500,000=2,250,000 - 500,000=1,750,000 < 2,000,000 no. Try (120, 90, 90): sum=300, ab+bc+ca=120*90 + 90*90 + 120*90=10,800 + 8,100 + 10,800=29,700, abc=120*90*90=972,000, 100*29,700 - 972,000=2,970,000 - 972,000=1,998,000 close but no. Try (110, 95, 95): sum=300, ab+bc+ca=110*95 + 95*95 + 110*95=10,450 + 9,025 + 10,450=29,925, abc=110*95*95=993,250, 100*29,925 - 993,250=2,992,500 - 993,250=1,999,250 close but no. Try (105, 97, 98): sum=300, ab+bc+ca=105*97 + 97*98 + 105*98=10,185 + 9,506 + 10,290=29,981, abc=105*97*98=999,930, 100*29,981 - 999,930=2,998,100 - 999,930=1,998,170 no. The only exact solution is (100,100,100). Since the problem asks for the number of triples, and the triple is symmetric, the number of solutions is the number of permutations of (100,100,100), which is 1 because all are equal. So the answer is 1.
