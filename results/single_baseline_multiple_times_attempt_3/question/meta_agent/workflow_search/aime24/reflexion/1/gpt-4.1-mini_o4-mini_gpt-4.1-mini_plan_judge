Question: Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.

proposed answer: We place triangle ABC with AB=5, BC=9, AC=10 on its circumcircle ω. Let D be the intersection of the tangents at B and C. Then DB=DC because both are tangent segments, and in the isosceles triangle DBC the apex‐angle at D is ∠BDC=180°−arc BC=180°−2A. Hence
  BC = 2·DB·sin((180°−2A)/2)=2·DB·cos A,
so DB = BC/(2 cos A).  By Law of Cosines in ΔABC,
  cos A = (AB^2+AC^2−BC^2)/(2·AB·AC) = (25+100−81)/(2·5·10)=11/25.
Thus DB = 9/(2·11/25)=225/22 and DB^2 =50625/484.

Next, in ΔABD, AB=5, BD=225/22, and the interior angle at B is ∠ABD = 180°−C (since the tangent–chord angle equals C, so the triangle’s interior angle is its supplement).  By the Law of Cosines,
  AD^2 = AB^2 + BD^2 − 2·AB·BD·cos(180°−C)
          =25 + 50625/484 + 2·5·(225/22)·(13/15)
          =105625/484,
so AD =325/22.

The secant through D meets ω at P and A, so by the power of D,
  DP·DA = DB^2 =50625/484.
Since P lies between D and A, DP = DB^2/DA = (50625/484)/(325/22) =22275/3146,
and hence
  AP = DA − DP = (325/22) − (22275/3146)
           = (46475/3146) − (22275/3146)
           =24200/3146 =1100/143 =100/13.
Therefore m=100, n=13, and m+n=113.
