Question: Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To solve this problem, we use the fact that the tangents from a point to a circle are equal in length. Since D is the intersection of the tangents from B and C, we have DB = DC. Also, since AD is the symmedian of triangle ABC, we can use the symmedian property to find AP. The symmedian divides the opposite side in the ratio of the squares of the other two sides. Therefore, AP is the harmonic conjugate of AD with respect to AB and AC. We use the formula for the length of the symmedian to find AP. The correct approach involves using the power of a point and the properties of the symmedian. The correct value of AP is 6, not 14.
