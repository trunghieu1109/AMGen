Question: Define $f(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{4}|$. Find the number of intersections of the graphs of \[y=4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \quad\text{ and }\quad x=4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))).\]
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: To find the number of intersections, we need to analyze the periodicity and behavior of the functions involved. The function f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| creates a V-shape centered at x = 0.5 and x = -0.5. Similarly, g(x) = ||x| - 1/4| creates a V-shape centered at x = 0.25 and x = -0.25. The function y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) is periodic with period 1, and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) is periodic with period 2/3. We need to find the values of x and y where these two expressions are equal, which corresponds to the intersections of the graphs. By considering the periodicity and symmetry of the sine and cosine functions, and the scaling factor of 4, we can determine the number of solutions over the interval [0, 1) for x and [0, 2/3) for y.
