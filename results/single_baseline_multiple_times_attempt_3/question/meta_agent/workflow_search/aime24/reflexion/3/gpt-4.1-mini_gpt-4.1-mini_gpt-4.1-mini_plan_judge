Question: Define $f(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{4}|$. Find the number of intersections of the graphs of \[y=4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \quad\text{ and }\quad x=4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))).\]

proposed answer: The problem reduces to solving the system:

x = h(cos(3πy))

y = h(sin(2πx))

where h(t) = 4 * | |t| - 1/2 | - 1/4 |, defined on t in [-1,1].

Analyzing h(t):
- For a = |t| in [0,1],
  h(a) = 4 * | |a - 1/2| - 1/4 |.
- On [0,1/2], h(a) = 4 * |1/4 - a|, a V shape with minimum 0 at a=1/4.
- On [1/2,1], h(a) = 4 * |a - 3/4|, a V shape with minimum 0 at a=3/4.
- h(a) ranges from 0 to 1, with peaks at 0, 1/2, and 1.

The functions y = h(sin(2πx)) and x = h(cos(3πy)) map [0,1] to [0,1].

Because sin(2πx) and cos(3πy) are periodic with periods 1 and 2/3 respectively, and h has two zeros and three linear segments, the system has multiple solutions.

By examining the structure:
- For y fixed, x = h(cos(3πy)) has 3 linear segments in cos(3πy).
- For x fixed, y = h(sin(2πx)) similarly has 3 linear segments in sin(2πx).

Each of these piecewise linear segments combined with the periodicity leads to multiple intersection points.

Counting the number of solutions carefully:
- The function h composed with sin(2πx) has 4 monotonic pieces in [0,1] due to the sine wave crossing the critical points.
- Similarly, h composed with cos(3πy) has 6 monotonic pieces in [0,1] due to the cosine wave's higher frequency.

The number of intersections is the product of the number of monotonic pieces in each function, which is 4 * 6 = 24.

Therefore, the number of intersection points of the graphs is 24.
