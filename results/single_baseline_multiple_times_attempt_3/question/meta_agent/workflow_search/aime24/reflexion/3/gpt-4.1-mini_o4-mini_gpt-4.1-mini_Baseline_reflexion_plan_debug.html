    <pre>Define $f(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{4}|$. Find the number of intersections of the graphs of \[y=4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \quad\text{ and }\quad x=4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))).\]

### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent gFb2 (yourself):
We wish to count solutions (x,y)
 to
  y = 4 g(f(sin 2πx)),
  x = 4 g(f(cos 3πy)).
Set A(x)=4 g(f(sin 2πx)), B(y)=4 g(f(cos 3πy)).  Then intersections satisfy y=A(x), x=B(y), so x = B(A(x)), i.e. fixed points of h(x)=B(A(x)).  One checks that A(x) has period ½ in x and maps [0,½] back and forth over [0,1] in 7 monotonic pieces; B(t) (as function of t=A(x)) is itself a 1-to-1-on-pieces combination of |cos(3πt)| and g∘f giving 3 half‐periods in t∈[0,1].  Composing, on each of the 7 monotonic subintervals of x∈[0,½], the equation x=h(x) exhibits exactly 16 simple crossings with the line y=x.  Hence there are 7·16=112 fixed points in [0,½), and by the ½‐periodicity of h another 112 in [½,1), for a total of 224 fixed points in [0,1).  Each gives a unique y=A(x), so there are 224 intersections.

### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent gFb2 (yourself):
224

### feedback #1 by Critic Agent TaJb:
The key mistake is in the piece‐counting.  On [0,½] the map A(x)=4g(f(sin2πx)) does not break into 7 but into 8 strictly monotonic subintervals (f(sin…) has 4 pieces and g splits each into 2), and on [0,1] the map B(y)=4g(f(cos3πy)) breaks into 24 monotonic pieces (three half‐periods of |cos|, each yielding 8 pieces), not 16.  Hence the claimed 7×16×2 argument for 224 intersections is not valid.  The true number of fixed points of B∘A is different from 224.

Given previous attempts and feedback, carefully consider where you could go wrong in your latest attempt. Using insights from previous attempts, try to solve the task better.</pre>

    <pre>We want solutions of y=A(x)=4|f(sin2πx)−¼| and x=B(y)=4|f(cos3πy)−¼|, hence fixed points x=h(x)=B(A(x)) on [0,1]. Note A(x) has period ½ and is piecewise linear with 8 strictly monotonic segments on [0,½]. B(y) has period ⅓ and on [0,1] breaks into 3 periods×8 monotonic pieces per period=24 pieces. On each A‐segment, h is linear on at most 24 sub‐pieces, giving at most one fixed point per sub‐piece. Thus on [0,½] there are 8×24=192 solutions, and by ½‐periodicity another 192 on [½,1], for a total of 384 intersections.
