Question: Define $f(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{4}|$. Find the number of intersections of the graphs of \[y=4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \quad\text{ and }\quad x=4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))).\]
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: We want solutions of y=A(x)=4|f(sin2πx)−¼| and x=B(y)=4|f(cos3πy)−¼|, hence fixed points x=h(x)=B(A(x)) on [0,1]. Note A(x) has period ½ and is piecewise linear with 8 strictly monotonic segments on [0,½]. B(y) has period ⅓ and on [0,1] breaks into 3 periods×8 monotonic pieces per period=24 pieces. On each A‐segment, h is linear on at most 24 sub‐pieces, giving at most one fixed point per sub‐piece. Thus on [0,½] there are 8×24=192 solutions, and by ½‐periodicity another 192 on [½,1], for a total of 384 intersections.
