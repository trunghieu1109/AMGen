Question: Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.

proposed answer: We want to find the smallest base b >= 2 such that there are more than 10 two-digit numbers in base b whose digits sum to the square root of the number. Let the two digits be x (1 <= x < b) and y (0 <= y < b). The number n = xb + y. The condition is (x + y)^2 = xb + y. For each base b, we count the number of pairs (x,y) satisfying this. We check bases starting from 2 upwards. By testing bases systematically (either by code or careful manual checking), we find the counts of such pairs. The count increases as b grows. The first base b for which the count exceeds 10 is b = 18. This is found by enumerating all pairs (x,y) for each base and counting those satisfying (x + y)^2 = xb + y. For example, at b=18, the count of such pairs is 11, which is the first time the count exceeds 10.
