Question: Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.\Pattern: reflexion
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent sD9d', content="To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest base b such that there are more than 10 b-beautiful integers. A b-beautiful integer n is one that has exactly two digits in base b, and the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. In base b, a two-digit number can be expressed as n = ab + c, where a and c are digits (0 <= a, c < b) and a > 0. The condition for n to be b-beautiful is that a + c = sqrt(n). Therefore, n = ab + c = (a + c)^2. We need to find the number of such integers n for a given base b. Let's calculate this for different values of b, starting from b = 2, and find the smallest b for which there are more than 10 such integers. For each b, we iterate over possible values of a and c, compute n, and check if a + c = sqrt(n). We count the number of such n for each b and find the smallest b with more than 10 such integers.\n\nAnswer:14", prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
