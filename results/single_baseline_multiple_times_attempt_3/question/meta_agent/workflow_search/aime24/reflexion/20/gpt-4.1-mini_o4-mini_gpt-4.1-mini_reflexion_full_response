Question: Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.\Pattern: reflexion
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent Vg1J', content='We seek b≥2 such that there are more than ten positive integers n with exactly two digits in base b and digit‐sum equal to √n. Write n=k², with k≥2 integer. Its base‐b expansion is n=x\u2009b+y, with x+y=k, x∈[1,b−1], y∈[0,b−1]. Equivalently k(k−1)=x(b−1), so b−1 must divide k(k−1). Since gcd(k,k−1)=1, any prime factor of b−1 divides exactly one of k or k−1. Thus if b−1 has r distinct prime factors, there are 2^r choices of which primes divide k versus k−1, yielding 2^r valid k mod (b−1). Discarding the trivial k=1 case leaves 2^r−1 such k in [2,b−1], each giving a distinct two‐digit solution. We need 2^r−1>10 ⇒2^r>11⇒r≥4. The smallest integer with 4 distinct primes is 2·3·5·7=210, so b−1=210 ⇒b=211 is minimal.\n\nAnswer:211', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
