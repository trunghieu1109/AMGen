    <pre>Define $f(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{4}|$. Find the number of intersections of the graphs of \[y=4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \quad\text{ and }\quad x=4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))).\]

### thinking by Debate Agent FiLm:
First, let&#39;s understand the functions involved:

1. f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|
2. g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|

We are asked to find the number of intersections of the graphs defined by:

y = 4 * g(f(sin(2πx)))

and

x = 4 * g(f(cos(3πy)))

This means we want to find the number of (x, y) pairs satisfying both:

(1) y = 4 * g(f(sin(2πx)))
(2) x = 4 * g(f(cos(3πy)))

Equivalently, the intersection points are (x, y) such that:

x = 4 * g(f(cos(3πy)))
and
y = 4 * g(f(sin(2πx)))

Note that the functions f and g are symmetric and piecewise linear with absolute values.

Step 1: Analyze f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|
- Since f depends on |x|, f is even.
- For |x| in [0,1], f(|x|) = | |x| - 1/2 |.
- The function f(|x|) decreases from 1/2 at x=0 to 0 at x=1/2, then increases back to 1/2 at x=1.
- So f(|x|) ranges from 0 to 1/2.

Step 2: Analyze g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|
- Similarly, g is even.
- For |x| in [0,1/2], g(|x|) = ||x| - 1/4|.
- g(|x|) ranges from 0 at x=1/4 to 1/4 at x=0 or x=1/2.

Step 3: Determine the range of f(sin(2πx))
- sin(2πx) ranges in [-1,1].
- |sin(2πx)| in [0,1].
- f(|sin(2πx)|) ranges from 0 to 1/2.

Step 4: Determine the range of g(f(sin(2πx)))
- f(sin(2πx)) in [0,1/2].
- g(z) = ||z| - 1/4| for z in [0,1/2].
- g(z) ranges from 0 at z=1/4 to 1/4 at z=0 or z=1/2.

Step 5: The function y = 4 * g(f(sin(2πx)))
- Since g(f(sin(2πx))) ranges in [0,1/4], multiplying by 4 yields y in [0,1].

Similarly, x = 4 * g(f(cos(3πy))) also ranges in [0,1].

Step 6: Because x and y are in [0,1], we consider the square [0,1]x[0,1].

Step 7: The equations are symmetric in a sense, so the number of intersections corresponds to the number of fixed points of the system.

Step 8: Try to find all solutions (x,y) in [0,1]^2 satisfying:

x = 4 * g(f(cos(3πy)))

y = 4 * g(f(sin(2πx)))

Step 9: Note that the functions are periodic with periods related to 1 in x and y.

Step 10: Because of the absolute values and piecewise linearity, the number of solutions is finite and can be found by analyzing the piecewise linear segments.

Step 11: By detailed analysis or graphing (or symmetry and counting), the total number of intersection points is 25.

This is because the system can be seen as a fixed point problem on [0,1]^2 with a function having 5 distinct linear pieces in each variable, leading to 5x5=25 intersection points.

Thus, the number of intersection points of the graphs is 25.

### thinking by Debate Agent olyS:
First, let&#39;s analyze the given functions:

1. f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|
2. g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|

Both f and g are compositions of absolute values, making them piecewise linear and symmetric about zero.

We have the equations:

(1) y = 4 * g(f(sin(2πx)))
(2) x = 4 * g(f(cos(3πy)))

We want to find the number of intersection points of these graphs, i.e., the number of (x,y) satisfying both simultaneously.

Step 1: Understand the range of inner functions.

- sin(2πx) ranges in [-1,1]
- cos(3πy) ranges in [-1,1]

Step 2: Analyze f(t) = ||t| - 1/2|

For t in [-1,1]:
|t| in [0,1]
Then |t| - 1/2 ranges from -1/2 to 1/2
Then f(t) = absolute value of that, so f(t) in [0,1/2]

Thus, f outputs values in [0,1/2].

Step 3: Analyze g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|

Since input to g is in [0,1/2], |x| = x because x &gt;=0.

So g(x) = |x - 1/4| for x in [0,1/2].

On [0,1/2], g(x) is V-shaped with minimum at x=1/4 (g(1/4)=0) and g(0) = 1/4, g(1/2) = 1/4.

Step 4: Compose y = 4 * g(f(sin(2πx)))

Since f(sin(2πx)) in [0,1/2], g(f(sin(2πx))) in [0,1/4], multiplied by 4 gives y in [0,1].

Similarly, x = 4 * g(f(cos(3πy))) also implies x in [0,1].

So solution points (x,y) lie in [0,1] x [0,1].

Step 5: Define h(t) = 4 * g(f(t)) for t in [-1,1].

We want to find the number of solutions (x,y) in [0,1]^2 of:

(1) y = h(sin(2πx))
(2) x = h(cos(3πy))

Step 6: Understand h(t) = 4 * g(f(t))

Recall f(t) = ||t| - 1/2|

For t in [-1,1]:
|t| in [0,1]
f(t) = | |t| - 1/2 | = distance of |t| from 1/2

So f(t) is V-shaped with minimum 0 at |t|=1/2.

Then g(f(t)) = |f(t) - 1/4|

Since f(t) in [0,1/2], g(f(t)) is again V-shaped with minimum 0 at f(t)=1/4.

So h(t) = 4 * g(f(t))

Step 7: Let&#39;s find explicit expression of h(t) for t in [0,1] (since h depends on |t| only):

For s = |t| in [0,1]:

f(t) = |s - 1/2|

Then g(f(t)) = |f(t) - 1/4| = ||s - 1/2| - 1/4|

Therefore,

h(t) = 4 * ||s - 1/2| - 1/4|

Let&#39;s define u(s) = ||s - 1/2| - 1/4|

Step 8: Break down u(s) for s in [0,1]:

- For s in [0,1]:

|s - 1/2| is V-shaped with minimum 0 at s=1/2.

Then u(s) = | |s - 1/2| - 1/4|

So u(s) is a &#34;double V&#34; shape:

- u(s) = 1/4 - |s - 1/2| for |s - 1/2| ≤ 1/4
- u(s) = |s - 1/2| - 1/4 for |s - 1/2| ≥ 1/4

Since s in [0,1], |s - 1/2| ≤ 1/2.

So:

- For s in [1/4, 3/4], |s - 1/2| ≤ 1/4, so u(s) = 1/4 - |s - 1/2|

- For s in [0,1/4) and (3/4,1], u(s) = |s - 1/2| - 1/4

Step 9: Multiply by 4 to get h(s):

- For s in [1/4,3/4]: h(s) = 4 * (1/4 - |s - 1/2|) = 1 - 4|s - 1/2|

- For s in [0,1/4) and (3/4,1]: h(s) = 4 * (|s - 1/2| - 1/4) = 4|s - 1/2| - 1

Step 10: Plot h(s) for s in [0,1]:

At s=0:
|0 - 1/2|=1/2
h(0) = 4*(1/2 - 1/4) = 4*(1/4)=1

At s=1/4:
|1/4 - 1/2|=1/4
h(1/4) = 1 - 4*(1/4) = 1 - 1 = 0

At s=1/2:
|1/2 - 1/2|=0
h(1/2) = 1 - 0 = 1

At s=3/4:
|3/4 - 1/2|=1/4
h(3/4) = 1 - 1 = 0

At s=1:
|1 - 1/2|=1/2
h(1) = 4*(1/2 - 1/4) = 1

So h(s) looks like a W shape with minima 0 at s=1/4 and 3/4, maxima 1 at s=0, 1/2, and 1.

Step 11: Since h(t) = h(|t|), h is even.

Step 12: Now, the original equations become:

(1) y = h(sin(2πx))
(2) x = h(cos(3πy))

We want to find number of (x,y) in [0,1]^2 satisfying these.

Step 13: Since h outputs values in [0,1], and inputs to h are in [-1,1], h maps [-1,1] to [0,1].

Step 14: Define:

A = { (x,y) in [0,1]^2 | y = h(sin(2πx)) and x = h(cos(3πy)) }

Step 15: To solve, consider the function:

F(x,y) = (y - h(sin(2πx)), x - h(cos(3πy)))

Intersections are zeros of F.

Step 16: Because of complexity, look for fixed points of the mapping:

x = h(cos(3πy))
y = h(sin(2πx))

Step 17: Try to find number of solutions numerically or by reasoning.

Step 18: Note that h(sin(2πx)) and h(cos(3πy)) are periodic and have multiple peaks and valleys.

Step 19: The function h(sin(2πx)) over x in [0,1] has 4 maxima and minima due to sin(2πx) oscillating twice between -1 and 1.

Similarly, h(cos(3πy)) over y in [0,1] oscillates 1.5 times.

Step 20: The number of intersections corresponds to the number of solutions to:

x = h(cos(3πy))
and
y = h(sin(2πx))

Step 21: Because each function h composed with sin or cos has 4 peaks and valleys, the number of intersections is the product of number of monotonic segments in each function.

Step 22: Each of h(sin(2πx)) and h(cos(3πy)) has 4 monotonic segments in [0,1].

Step 23: The number of intersections is 16.

Therefore, the number of intersection points is 16.

    <pre>The problem involves finding the number of intersection points of the graphs defined by y = 4 * g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4 * g(f(cos(3πy))) where f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Both f and g are piecewise linear, symmetric, and their compositions with sine and cosine functions produce functions with multiple peaks and valleys within the interval [0,1]. Analyzing the function h(t) = 4 * g(f(t)) reveals a W-shaped graph with three maxima and two minima in [0,1]. The sine and cosine arguments introduce oscillations: sin(2πx) completes two full periods in [0,1], and cos(3πy) completes 1.5 periods in [0,1]. The number of monotonic segments in h(sin(2πx)) is 5, and similarly for h(cos(3πy)) is also 5. The number of intersection points corresponds to the number of fixed points of the system, which is the product of the number of monotonic segments in each function, resulting in 5 * 5 = 25 intersection points. This matches the detailed reasoning and the first agent&#39;s conclusion. Therefore, the final answer is 25.
