    <pre>Define $f(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{4}|$. Find the number of intersections of the graphs of \[y=4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \quad\text{ and }\quad x=4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))).\]

### thinking by Debate Agent aHcW:
We want the number of solutions (x,y) in R2 satisfying
y = 4⋅g(f(sin2πx)),  x = 4⋅g(f(cos3πy)).  Note that f(u)=||u|–½| maps [–1,1] to [0,½], and g(w)=||w|–¼| maps [–½,½] to [0,¼].  Hence both right‐hand sides lie in [0,1], forcing x,y∈[0,1].  Write Y(x)=4| | |sin2πx|–½|–¼| and X(y)=4| | |cos3πy|–½|–¼|.  On [0,1], the graph y=Y(x) is a zigzag with 8 strictly monotonic linear‐in‐|sin| pieces, and the curve x=X(y) is similarly a zigzag with 6 strictly monotonic pieces in y.  Reflecting x=X(y) across the line y=x gives y=X^{-1}(x), which also has 6 monotonic pieces.  A monotonic segment of Y(x) can intersect a monotonic segment of X^{-1}(x) at most once, and in fact in this general‐position absolute‐value situation each pair of segments does intersect exactly once.  Hence the total number of intersection points is 8⋅6 = 48.

### thinking by Debate Agent VkB2:
We seek real (x,y) with y=4g(f(sin2πx)) and x=4g(f(cos3πy)), with f(u)=||u|−½|, g(u)=||u|−¼|. Both RHS‐functions map [0,1]→[0,1], piecewise linear but periodic: Y(x)=4g(f(sin2πx)) has period ½ and two identical “humps” on [0,1], X(y)=4g(f(cos3πy)) has period ⅔ and three half-period “humps” on [0,1]. Intersections solve x=X(Y(x)), i.e. H(x)=X(Y(x))−x=0. Numerically sampling reveals in each ½-period of Y (i.e. on [0,0.5] and [0.5,1]) there are exactly two sign‐changes of H(x) in the interior, hence two distinct roots in (0,0.5) and two in (0.5,1), plus the endpoint x=1 is also a solution.  No other crossings occur.  Thus there are 2+2+1=5 intersection points.

    <pre>We seek real solutions (x,y) of y=A(x)=4g(f(sin2πx)), x=B(y)=4g(f(cos3πy)).  Restricting to [0,1], define H(x)=B(A(x)).  Solutions satisfy H(x)=x.  A(x) is piecewise‐linear with 8 monotonic pieces on [0,0.5] and similarly on [0.5,1].  On each half, among the 8 segments only the two central segments (where A swings 0→1 and 1→0 across the mid–hump) produce two sign‐changes of D(x)=H(x)−x, yielding 2 roots each.  The other segments produce D&gt;0 throughout.  On [0,0.5] this gives 4 roots, and similarly 4 more on [0.5,1].  Additionally x=1 is a fixed point.  No other crossings occur.  In total there are 4+4+1=9 intersections.
