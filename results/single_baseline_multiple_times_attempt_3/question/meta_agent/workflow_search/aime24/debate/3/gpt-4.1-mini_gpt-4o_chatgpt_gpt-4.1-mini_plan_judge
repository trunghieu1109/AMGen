Question: Define $f(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{4}|$. Find the number of intersections of the graphs of \[y=4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \quad\text{ and }\quad x=4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))).\]
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To find the number of intersections, we need to analyze the functions and their compositions. The function f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| has a 'V' shape centered at x = ±1/2 and is symmetric about the y-axis. The function g(x) = ||x| - 1/4| is similar but centered at x = ±1/4. For y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))), the sine function oscillates between -1 and 1, so |sin(2πx)| oscillates between 0 and 1. Substituting into f, we get f(sin(2πx)) = ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2|, which ranges from 0 to 1/2. Then g(f(sin(2πx))) = ||f(sin(2πx))| - 1/4| will range from 0 to 1/4, and 4g(f(sin(2πx))) will range from 0 to 1. Similarly, for x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))), the cosine function also oscillates between -1 and 1, and 4g(f(cos(3πy))) will also range from 0 to 1. The intersections occur when 4g(f(sin(2πx))) = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) and y = x. Since both functions range from 0 to 1, the intersections occur when x = y and both are in the range [0, 1]. The periodic nature of sine and cosine means they will intersect at multiple points over one period (0 to 1 for x and y). Analyzing the periodicity and symmetry, we find that there are 5 intersections.
