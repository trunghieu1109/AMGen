Question: Define $f(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{4}|$. Find the number of intersections of the graphs of \[y=4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \quad\text{ and }\quad x=4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))).\]
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: We seek real solutions (x,y) of y=A(x)=4g(f(sin2πx)), x=B(y)=4g(f(cos3πy)).  Restricting to [0,1], define H(x)=B(A(x)).  Solutions satisfy H(x)=x.  A(x) is piecewise‐linear with 8 monotonic pieces on [0,0.5] and similarly on [0.5,1].  On each half, among the 8 segments only the two central segments (where A swings 0→1 and 1→0 across the mid–hump) produce two sign‐changes of D(x)=H(x)−x, yielding 2 roots each.  The other segments produce D>0 throughout.  On [0,0.5] this gives 4 roots, and similarly 4 more on [0.5,1].  Additionally x=1 is a fixed point.  No other crossings occur.  In total there are 4+4+1=9 intersections.
