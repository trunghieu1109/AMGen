Question: Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.

proposed answer: The problem involves finding the inradius of a tetrahedron with given edge lengths. The inradius is the distance from the incenter to any of the faces. The inradius (r) of a tetrahedron with volume V and face areas A1, A2, A3, A4 is given by r = 3V / (A1 + A2 + A3 + A4). To solve this, we first calculate the volume of the tetrahedron using the Cayley-Menger determinant, and then find the areas of the faces using Heron's formula. The given edge lengths suggest a symmetric tetrahedron, possibly a regular tetrahedron in disguise. We calculate the side length a of the equivalent regular tetrahedron using the sum of the squares of the lengths of the edges. The distance from the centroid to a face of a regular tetrahedron with side length a is given by the formula (a sqrt(6))/4. Substituting the given edge lengths, we find a^2 = 140, so a = 2 sqrt(35). The distance from the centroid to a face is then (sqrt(210))/2. In the form (m sqrt(n))/p, we have m = 1, n = 210, p = 2. Therefore, m + n + p = 1 + 210 + 2 = 213.
