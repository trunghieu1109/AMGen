    <pre>Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.

### thinking by Debate Agent HzIP:
We observed that the tetrahedron is a disphenoid (opposite edges equal), so all four faces are congruent with side lengths √41,√80,√89. By Heron’s formula each face area is 6√21, hence total surface area S=24√21. Embedding the tetrahedron in coordinates (or using the Cayley–Menger simplification) yields volume V=160/3. The inradius is r=3V/S=160/(24√21)=20/(3√21)=20√21/63, so (m,n,p)=(20,21,63) and m+n+p=104.

### thinking by Debate Agent LHwA:
We have a tetrahedron ABCD with all opposite edges equal: AB=CD=√41, AC=BD=√80, AD=BC=√89. This is a disphenoid (all four faces congruent). Let Δ be the area of triangle ABC (and each face). Compute Δ² by Heron’s formula in squared form: Δ²=[2(a²b²+b²c²+c²a²)−(a^4+b^4+c^4)]/16 with a²=41,b²=80,c²=89. This gives Δ²=756, so Δ=6√21. Total surface area S=4Δ=24√21. Next find the volume V: place A at origin, B on x‐axis, C in xy‐plane, solve for coordinates of D via distances to A,B,C. The scalar triple product yields V=|det([AB,AC,AD])|/6 =2√21·z where z=distance from D to plane ABC=80/√189, so V=160/3. The insphere radius r satisfies V=(r·S)/3, so r=3V/S = (3·160/3)/(24√21)=160/(24√21)=20/(3√21) = (20√21)/63. Hence m=20,n=21,p=63 and m+n+p=20+21+63=104.

    <pre>We recognize that a tetrahedron with equal opposite edges (AB=CD, AC=BD, AD=BC) is a disphenoid, so all four faces are congruent triangles with side lengths √41, √80, √89. Compute the area Δ of one face using the formula Δ² = [2(a²b²+b²c²+c²a²) – (a⁴+b⁴+c⁴)]/16 for a, b, c = lengths of the triangle. Here a²=41, b²=80, c²=89 gives Δ² = 756, so Δ = 6√21. The total surface area S = 4Δ = 24√21. To find the inradius r, we also need the volume V. One can place three vertices to compute V explicitly or use known formulas; it works out that V = 160/3. The inradius satisfies V = r·S/3, so r = 3V/S = (3·160/3)/(24√21) = 160/(24√21) = 20/(3√21) = (20√21)/63. Thus m=20, n=21, p=63 and m+n+p = 20+21+63 = 104.
