Question: Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.\Pattern: debate
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Final Decision Agent bkiV', content="The problem involves finding the inradius of a tetrahedron with given edge lengths. The inradius is the distance from the incenter to any of the faces. The inradius (r) of a tetrahedron with volume V and face areas A1, A2, A3, A4 is given by r = 3V / (A1 + A2 + A3 + A4). To solve this, we first calculate the volume of the tetrahedron using the Cayley-Menger determinant, and then find the areas of the faces using Heron's formula. The given edge lengths suggest a symmetric tetrahedron, possibly a regular tetrahedron in disguise. We calculate the side length a of the equivalent regular tetrahedron using the sum of the squares of the lengths of the edges. The distance from the centroid to a face of a regular tetrahedron with side length a is given by the formula (a sqrt(6))/4. Substituting the given edge lengths, we find a^2 = 140, so a = 2 sqrt(35). The distance from the centroid to a face is then (sqrt(210))/2. In the form (m sqrt(n))/p, we have m = 1, n = 210, p = 2. Therefore, m + n + p = 1 + 210 + 2 = 213.\n\nAnswer:213", prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.

The inradius is the distance from the incenter to any of the faces. The inradius (r) of a tetrahedron with volume V and face areas A1, A2, A3, A4 is given by r = 3V / (A1 + A2 + A3 + A4). To solve this, we first calculate the volume of the tetrahedron using the Cayley-Menger determinant, and then find the areas of the faces using Heron's formula.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent L8RW:\nTo solve the problem, we first observe that the given conditions on the tetrahedron's edge lengths suggest that it is symmetric. Specifically, the tetrahedron is isosceles with respect to the pairs of opposite edges. This symmetry implies that the tetrahedron is likely a regular tetrahedron in disguise or has some regular properties that simplify calculations.\n\nWe are given that the distances from a point I to each face of the tetrahedron are equal. For a regular tetrahedron, this point I would be the centroid, which is equidistant from all faces. The distance from the centroid to a face of a regular tetrahedron with side length a is given by the formula \\( \\frac{a \\sqrt{6}}{4} \\).\n\nTo find the side length a of the equivalent regular tetrahedron, we use the fact that opposite edges in the tetrahedron have equal length. We compute the square of the side length a using the formula for the sum of the squares of the lengths of the edges of a regular tetrahedron:\n\n\\[ a^2 = \\frac{1}{3} (AB^2 + AC^2 + AD^2 + BC^2 + BD^2 + CD^2) \\]\n\nSubstituting the given edge lengths:\n\\[ AB^2 = CD^2 = 41, \\]\n\\[ AC^2 = BD^2 = 80, \\]\n\\[ BC^2 = AD^2 = 89. \\]\n\nThus,\n\\[ a^2 = \\frac{1}{3} (41 + 80 + 89 + 80 + 89 + 41) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 420 = 140. \\]\n\nTherefore, \\( a = \\sqrt{140} = \\sqrt{4 \\times 35} = 2 \\sqrt{35} \\).\n\nThe distance from the centroid to a face is then:\n\\[ \\frac{a \\sqrt{6}}{4} = \\frac{2 \\sqrt{35} \\sqrt{6}}{4} = \\frac{\\sqrt{210}}{2}. \\]\n\nIn the form \\( \\frac{m \\sqrt{n}}{p} \\), we have \\( m = 1 \\), \\( n = 210 \\), \\( p = 2 \\). Therefore, \\( m + n + p = 1 + 210 + 2 = 213 \\).\n\n### answer by Debate Agent cTaw:\n53\n\n### answer by Debate Agent L8RW:\n213\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
