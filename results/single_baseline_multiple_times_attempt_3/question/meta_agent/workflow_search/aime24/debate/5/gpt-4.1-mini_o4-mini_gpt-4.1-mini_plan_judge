Question: Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.

proposed answer: We recognize that a tetrahedron with equal opposite edges (AB=CD, AC=BD, AD=BC) is a disphenoid, so all four faces are congruent triangles with side lengths √41, √80, √89. Compute the area Δ of one face using the formula Δ² = [2(a²b²+b²c²+c²a²) – (a⁴+b⁴+c⁴)]/16 for a, b, c = lengths of the triangle. Here a²=41, b²=80, c²=89 gives Δ² = 756, so Δ = 6√21. The total surface area S = 4Δ = 24√21. To find the inradius r, we also need the volume V. One can place three vertices to compute V explicitly or use known formulas; it works out that V = 160/3. The inradius satisfies V = r·S/3, so r = 3V/S = (3·160/3)/(24√21) = 160/(24√21) = 20/(3√21) = (20√21)/63. Thus m=20, n=21, p=63 and m+n+p = 20+21+63 = 104.
