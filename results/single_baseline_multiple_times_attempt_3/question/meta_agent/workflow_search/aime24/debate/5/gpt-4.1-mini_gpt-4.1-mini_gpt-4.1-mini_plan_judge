Question: Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.

proposed answer: The problem describes a tetrahedron with opposite edges equal: AB=CD=√41, AC=BD=√80, BC=AD=√89. Such a tetrahedron is orthocentric, and the point I inside with equal distances to all faces is the incenter. The inradius r is given by r = 3V / S, where V is the volume and S is the total surface area. Using coordinate geometry, we placed A at the origin, B on the x-axis, C in the xy-plane, and found coordinates for D using the given distances. We computed the volume V = 2√21 * Z, where Z is the z-coordinate of D, and found Z² = 10758880 / 317709. The surface area S is 4 times the area of triangle ABC, which simplifies to 24√21. The inradius then simplifies to r = Z / 4 = (√(10758880 / 317709)) / 4. Rationalizing and simplifying, we get r = (1344√176495) / 388289, where 1344 and 388289 are coprime and 176495 is square-free. Summing m + n + p = 1344 + 176495 + 388289 = 566128. This matches the detailed and consistent calculation from the first reasoning, while the second reasoning had some computational inaccuracies and less simplification. Therefore, the final answer is 566128.
