    <pre>Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.

### thinking by Debate Agent cTaw:
The problem involves finding the inradius of a tetrahedron with given edge lengths. The inradius is the distance from the incenter to any of the faces. The inradius (r) of a tetrahedron with volume V and face areas A1, A2, A3, A4 is given by r = 3V / (A1 + A2 + A3 + A4). To solve this, we first calculate the volume of the tetrahedron using the Cayley-Menger determinant, and then find the areas of the faces using Heron&#39;s formula.

### thinking by Debate Agent L8RW:
To solve the problem, we first observe that the given conditions on the tetrahedron&#39;s edge lengths suggest that it is symmetric. Specifically, the tetrahedron is isosceles with respect to the pairs of opposite edges. This symmetry implies that the tetrahedron is likely a regular tetrahedron in disguise or has some regular properties that simplify calculations.

We are given that the distances from a point I to each face of the tetrahedron are equal. For a regular tetrahedron, this point I would be the centroid, which is equidistant from all faces. The distance from the centroid to a face of a regular tetrahedron with side length a is given by the formula \( \frac{a \sqrt{6}}{4} \).

To find the side length a of the equivalent regular tetrahedron, we use the fact that opposite edges in the tetrahedron have equal length. We compute the square of the side length a using the formula for the sum of the squares of the lengths of the edges of a regular tetrahedron:

\[ a^2 = \frac{1}{3} (AB^2 + AC^2 + AD^2 + BC^2 + BD^2 + CD^2) \]

Substituting the given edge lengths:
\[ AB^2 = CD^2 = 41, \]
\[ AC^2 = BD^2 = 80, \]
\[ BC^2 = AD^2 = 89. \]

Thus,
\[ a^2 = \frac{1}{3} (41 + 80 + 89 + 80 + 89 + 41) = \frac{1}{3} \times 420 = 140. \]

Therefore, \( a = \sqrt{140} = \sqrt{4 \times 35} = 2 \sqrt{35} \).

The distance from the centroid to a face is then:
\[ \frac{a \sqrt{6}}{4} = \frac{2 \sqrt{35} \sqrt{6}}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{210}}{2}. \]

In the form \( \frac{m \sqrt{n}}{p} \), we have \( m = 1 \), \( n = 210 \), \( p = 2 \). Therefore, \( m + n + p = 1 + 210 + 2 = 213 \).
