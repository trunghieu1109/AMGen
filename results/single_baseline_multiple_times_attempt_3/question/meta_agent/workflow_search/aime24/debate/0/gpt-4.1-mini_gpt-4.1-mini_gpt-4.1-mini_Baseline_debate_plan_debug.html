    <pre>Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.

### thinking by Debate Agent fuws:
Let s be Aya&#39;s walking speed in km/h, and t be the time spent in the coffee shop in minutes.

1. When walking at speed s, total time is 4 hours = 240 minutes, which includes walking time and coffee shop time t.
   Walking time at speed s: distance/speed = 9/s hours = 60*(9/s) minutes.
   Total time: 60*(9/s) + t = 240 minutes.

2. When walking at speed s+2, total time is 2 hours 24 minutes = 144 minutes.
   Walking time at speed s+2: 60*(9/(s+2)) minutes.
   Total time: 60*(9/(s+2)) + t = 144 minutes.

From these two equations:
   60*(9/s) + t = 240  =&gt; t = 240 - 540/s
   60*(9/(s+2)) + t = 144 =&gt; t = 144 - 540/(s+2)

Set equal:
   240 - 540/s = 144 - 540/(s+2)
   240 - 144 = 540/s - 540/(s+2)
   96 = 540*(1/s - 1/(s+2))
   96 = 540 * ( (s+2 - s) / (s*(s+2)) )
   96 = 540 * (2 / (s^2 + 2s))
   96 = 1080 / (s^2 + 2s)

Cross-multiplied:
   96*(s^2 + 2s) = 1080
   96s^2 + 192s = 1080
   Divide both sides by 12:
   8s^2 + 16s = 90

Bring all terms to one side:
   8s^2 + 16s - 90 = 0
   Divide by 2:
   4s^2 + 8s - 45 = 0

Use quadratic formula:
   s = [-8 ± sqrt(64 + 720)] / 8
   sqrt(784) = 28

So,
   s = (-8 + 28)/8 = 20/8 = 2.5 (positive speed)
   s = (-8 - 28)/8 = -36/8 = -4.5 (discard negative speed)

Therefore, s = 2.5 km/h

Find t:
   t = 240 - 540/s = 240 - 540/2.5 = 240 - 216 = 24 minutes

Now, for speed s + 0.5 = 2.5 + 0.5 = 3.0 km/h

Walking time = distance / speed = 9 / 3 = 3 hours = 180 minutes

Total time = walking time + coffee shop time = 180 + 24 = 204 minutes

Answer: 204 minutes

### thinking by Debate Agent fqK1:
Let s be the walking speed in km/h and t be the time spent in the coffee shop in minutes.

Given:
- Distance = 9 km
- When walking at speed s, total time = 4 hours (including t minutes in the coffee shop)
- When walking at speed s + 2, total time = 2 hours 24 minutes (including t minutes in the coffee shop)

Convert t minutes to hours: t/60 hours

For speed s:
Total time = walking time + coffee time
4 hours = (9 / s) + (t / 60)

For speed s + 2:
2 hours 24 minutes = 2 + 24/60 = 2.4 hours
2.4 = (9 / (s + 2)) + (t / 60)

From these two equations:
4 - t/60 = 9/s
2.4 - t/60 = 9/(s + 2)

Subtract second equation from first:
(4 - t/60) - (2.4 - t/60) = 9/s - 9/(s + 2)
4 - t/60 - 2.4 + t/60 = 9/s - 9/(s + 2)
1.6 = 9/s - 9/(s + 2)

Simplify right side:
1.6 = 9 * ((s + 2) - s) / (s * (s + 2))
1.6 = 9 * 2 / (s * (s + 2))
1.6 = 18 / (s^2 + 2s)

Multiply both sides by (s^2 + 2s):
1.6 * (s^2 + 2s) = 18
1.6s^2 + 3.2s = 18

Divide all terms by 1.6:
s^2 + 2s = 11.25

Rewrite:
s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0

Solve quadratic equation:
Using quadratic formula: s = [-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a
Here, a=1, b=2, c=-11.25
Discriminant = 4 + 45 = 49
s = [-2 ± 7] / 2

Two solutions:
s = (5)/2 = 2.5 or s = (-9)/2 = -4.5 (not possible since speed must be positive)

So, s = 2.5 km/h

Find t from first equation:
4 - t/60 = 9 / 2.5 = 3.6
4 - 3.6 = t/60
0.4 = t/60
t = 24 minutes

Now find the total time when speed = s + 0.5 = 2.5 + 0.5 = 3 km/h
Walking time = 9 / 3 = 3 hours
Total time = walking time + coffee time = 3 hours + 24 minutes = 3 hours 24 minutes
Convert 3 hours 24 minutes to minutes:
3 * 60 + 24 = 180 + 24 = 204 minutes

    <pre>Let s be Aya&#39;s walking speed in km/h and t be the time spent in the coffee shop in minutes. The total distance is 9 km. When walking at speed s, the total time is 4 hours (240 minutes), including t minutes at the coffee shop. So, walking time at speed s is 9/s hours, or 60*(9/s) minutes. Thus, 60*(9/s) + t = 240. When walking at speed s+2, total time is 2 hours 24 minutes (144 minutes), including t minutes at the coffee shop. So, 60*(9/(s+2)) + t = 144. Subtracting these equations to eliminate t gives 60*(9/s) - 60*(9/(s+2)) = 96. Simplifying leads to the quadratic equation 4s^2 + 8s - 45 = 0, which has positive root s = 2.5 km/h. Substituting back, t = 240 - 60*(9/2.5) = 24 minutes. For speed s + 0.5 = 3 km/h, walking time is 9/3 = 3 hours = 180 minutes. Total time including coffee shop is 180 + 24 = 204 minutes.
