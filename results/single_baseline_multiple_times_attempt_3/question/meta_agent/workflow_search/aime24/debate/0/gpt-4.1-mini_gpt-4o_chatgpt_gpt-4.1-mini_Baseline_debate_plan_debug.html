    <pre>Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.

### thinking by Debate Agent 4mlF:
First, we need to express the time it takes Aya to walk 9 kilometers in terms of her speed. The time taken to walk 9 kilometers at speed s is \( \frac{9}{s} \) hours. We know that the total time for the walk and coffee shop visit is 4 hours, so \( \frac{9}{s} + \frac{t}{60} = 4 \). Similarly, when her speed is \( s+2 \), the time taken to walk is \( \frac{9}{s+2} \) hours, and the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, or 2.4 hours. Thus, \( \frac{9}{s+2} + \frac{t}{60} = 2.4 \). We have two equations: \( \frac{9}{s} + \frac{t}{60} = 4 \) and \( \frac{9}{s+2} + \frac{t}{60} = 2.4 \). Subtracting the second equation from the first gives \( \frac{9}{s} - \frac{9}{s+2} = 1.6 \). Solving this equation for s, we get \( s = 3 \). Substituting \( s = 3 \) into the first equation gives \( \frac{9}{3} + \frac{t}{60} = 4 \), leading to \( t = 60 \). Now, we calculate the time taken when Aya walks at \( s + \frac{1}{2} = 3.5 \) km/h. The walking time is \( \frac{9}{3.5} \) hours. Converting this to minutes and adding the coffee shop time: \( \frac{9}{3.5} \times 60 + 60 \).

### thinking by Debate Agent VknS:
To solve this problem, we need to determine Aya&#39;s walking speed and the time spent in the coffee shop. First, we know that when she walks at speed s, the total time for the walk and coffee shop visit is 4 hours, and when she walks at speed s+2, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes. We can set up equations to express these conditions: 1) 9/s + t/60 = 4 and 2) 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4. Solving these equations will give us values for s and t. Once we have s, we can find the time it takes for Aya to walk at speed s+1/2 and add the time spent in the coffee shop to find the total time.

Now, we calculate the time taken when Aya walks at \( s + \frac{1}{2} = 3.5 \) km/h. The walking time is \( \frac{9}{3.5} \) hours, which is \( \frac{18}{7} \) hours. Converting this to minutes gives \( \frac{18}{7} \times 60 = 154.2857 \) minutes. Adding the coffee shop time of 60 minutes gives a total of \( 154.2857 + 60 = 214.2857 \) minutes, which rounds to 214 minutes.
