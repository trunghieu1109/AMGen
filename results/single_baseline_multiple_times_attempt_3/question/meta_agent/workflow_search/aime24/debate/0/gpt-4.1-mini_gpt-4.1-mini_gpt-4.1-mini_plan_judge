Question: Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: Let s be Aya's walking speed in km/h and t be the time spent in the coffee shop in minutes. The total distance is 9 km. When walking at speed s, the total time is 4 hours (240 minutes), including t minutes at the coffee shop. So, walking time at speed s is 9/s hours, or 60*(9/s) minutes. Thus, 60*(9/s) + t = 240. When walking at speed s+2, total time is 2 hours 24 minutes (144 minutes), including t minutes at the coffee shop. So, 60*(9/(s+2)) + t = 144. Subtracting these equations to eliminate t gives 60*(9/s) - 60*(9/(s+2)) = 96. Simplifying leads to the quadratic equation 4s^2 + 8s - 45 = 0, which has positive root s = 2.5 km/h. Substituting back, t = 240 - 60*(9/2.5) = 24 minutes. For speed s + 0.5 = 3 km/h, walking time is 9/3 = 3 hours = 180 minutes. Total time including coffee shop is 180 + 24 = 204 minutes.
