Question: Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To solve the problem, we need to find Aya's walking speed and the time spent in the coffee shop. We have two equations: 1) \( \frac{9}{s} + \frac{t}{60} = 4 \) and 2) \( \frac{9}{s+2} + \frac{t}{60} = 2.4 \). Subtracting the second equation from the first gives \( \frac{9}{s} - \frac{9}{s+2} = 1.6 \). Solving this equation for \( s \), we find \( s = 3 \). Substituting \( s = 3 \) into the first equation gives \( \frac{9}{3} + \frac{t}{60} = 4 \), leading to \( t = 60 \). Now, we calculate the time taken when Aya walks at \( s + \frac{1}{2} = 3.5 \) km/h. The walking time is \( \frac{9}{3.5} \) hours, which is \( \frac{18}{7} \) hours. Converting this to minutes gives \( \frac{18}{7} \times 60 = 154.2857 \) minutes. Adding the coffee shop time of 60 minutes gives a total of \( 154.2857 + 60 = 214.2857 \) minutes, which rounds to 214 minutes.
