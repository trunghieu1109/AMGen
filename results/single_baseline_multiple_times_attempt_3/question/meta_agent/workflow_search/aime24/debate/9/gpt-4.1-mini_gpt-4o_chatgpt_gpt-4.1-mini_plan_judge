Question: Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: To solve the problem, we need to calculate the probability of winning the grand prize given that a prize is won. First, calculate the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10, which is \( \binom{10}{4} = 210 \). Next, calculate the number of ways Jen can win a prize (at least 2 matches): 2 matches: \( \binom{4}{2} \binom{6}{2} = 90 \) ways, 3 matches: \( \binom{4}{3} \binom{6}{1} = 24 \) ways, 4 matches (grand prize): \( \binom{4}{4} = 1 \) way. Thus, the total ways to win a prize is \( 90 + 24 + 1 = 115 \). The probability of winning a prize is \( P(B) = \frac{115}{210} \). The probability of winning the grand prize (4 matches) is \( P(A \text{ and } B) = \frac{1}{210} \). Now apply conditional probability: \( P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \text{ and } B)}{P(B)} = \frac{\frac{1}{210}}{\frac{115}{210}} = \frac{1}{115} \). Thus, the probability is \( \frac{1}{115} \) with \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 115 \). Therefore, \( m+n = 116 \).
