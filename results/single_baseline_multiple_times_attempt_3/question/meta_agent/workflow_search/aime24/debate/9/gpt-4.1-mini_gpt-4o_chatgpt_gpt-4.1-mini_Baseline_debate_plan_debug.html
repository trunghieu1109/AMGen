    <pre>Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

### thinking by Debate Agent siwB:
To solve the problem, we need to calculate two probabilities: the probability of winning a prize (at least 2 numbers match) and the probability of winning the grand prize (all 4 numbers match) given that a prize is won. We use conditional probability: P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B). Here, A is the event of winning the grand prize, and B is the event of winning a prize. 

First, calculate the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10, which is \( \binom{10}{4} = 210 \). 

Next, calculate the number of ways Jen can win a prize (at least 2 matches):
- 2 matches: \( \binom{4}{2} \binom{6}{2} = 6 \cdot 15 = 90 \) ways.
- 3 matches: \( \binom{4}{3} \binom{6}{1} = 4 \cdot 6 = 24 \) ways.
- 4 matches (grand prize): \( \binom{4}{4} \binom{6}{0} = 1 \cdot 1 = 1 \) way.

Thus, the total ways to win a prize is \( 90 + 24 + 1 = 115 \). 

The probability of winning a prize is \( P(B) = \frac{115}{210} \). 
The probability of winning the grand prize (4 matches) is \( P(A \text{ and } B) = \frac{1}{210} \). 

Now apply conditional probability: \( P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \text{ and } B)}{P(B)} = \frac{\frac{1}{210}}{\frac{115}{210}} = \frac{1}{115} \).

Thus, the probability is \( \frac{1}{115} \) with \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 115 \). Therefore, \( m+n = 116 \).

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of Jen winning the grand prize given that she has already won a prize. First, we find the probability of winning a prize, which means at least 2 of her numbers match the randomly chosen numbers. Then, we calculate the probability of winning the grand prize, which means all 4 of her numbers match. Finally, we use conditional probability to find the probability of winning the grand prize given that she has won a prize.

1. Total ways to choose 4 numbers from S: \( \binom{10}{4} = 210 \).

2. Total ways Jen can win a prize:
   - 2 matches: \( \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{6}{2} = 6 \times 15 = 90 \)
   - 3 matches: \( \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{6}{1} = 4 \times 6 = 24 \)
   - 4 matches (grand prize): \( \binom{4}{4} = 1 \)
   Total ways to win a prize: \( 90 + 24 + 1 = 115 \).

3. Probability of winning the grand prize given a prize:
   - Total ways to win the grand prize: 1
   - Probability: \( \frac{1}{115} \)

4. The probability of winning the grand prize given that a prize is won is \( \frac{1}{115} \).

5. The fraction \( \frac{1}{115} \) is already in simplest form, so \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 115 \).
6. Therefore, \( m+n = 1+115 = 116 \).
