Question: Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.\Pattern: debate
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Final Decision Agent 6u06', content='Total ways to draw 4 numbers from 10 is C(10,4)=210. Number of draws matching exactly k of Jen’s 4 picks is C(4,k)·C(6,4−k). For k=2: 6·15=90; k=3: 4·6=24; k=4:1. So wins any prize in 90+24+1=115 cases, grand prize in 1 case. Thus P=1/115, m+n=1+115=116.\n\nAnswer:116', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.

Winning any prize means at least 2 matches: count draws with exactly k matches is C(4,k)*C(6,4−k). For k=2: 6*15 = 90; k=3: 4*6 = 24; k=4: 1. Total = 90+24+1 = 115, so P(prize) = 115/210. Hence P(grand | prize) = (1/210)/(115/210) = 1/115, in lowest terms. Thus m+n = 1+115 = 116.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent iTOS:\nTotal outcomes of draws C(10,4)=210. Jen’s prize if she matches k≥2 of her 4 picks. Number of draws with k matches is C(4,k)·C(6,4−k). For k=2:6·15=90; k=3:4·6=24; k=4:1. Total prize outcomes=90+24+1=115. Grand prize is k=4:1 outcome. So P(grand|prize)=1/115, m+n=1+115=116.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 2V4J:\n116\n\n### answer by Debate Agent iTOS:\n116\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
