    <pre>Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

### thinking by Debate Agent zpNr:
Jen chooses 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1, 2, ..., 10}. The total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is C(10,4) = 210.

The lottery draws 4 numbers from S. Jen wins a prize if at least 2 of her chosen numbers are among the drawn numbers.

We want to find the probability that Jen wins the grand prize (all 4 numbers match) given that she won a prize (at least 2 match).

Step 1: Total ways to choose 4 numbers from 10: C(10,4) = 210.

Step 2: Number of ways Jen&#39;s chosen 4 numbers match exactly k of the drawn 4 numbers (k=0 to 4).

Since Jen&#39;s numbers are fixed, the random draw is the variable. The number of 4-number draws that have exactly k matches with Jen&#39;s set is:

Number of draws with exactly k matches = C(4,k) * C(6,4-k)

Because:
- Choose k numbers from Jen&#39;s 4 numbers to be in the draw.
- Choose the remaining (4-k) numbers from the other 6 numbers (since total 10 - 4 Jen&#39;s numbers = 6).

Step 3: Calculate these values:

- k=0: C(4,0)*C(6,4) = 1 * 15 = 15
- k=1: C(4,1)*C(6,3) = 4 * 20 = 80
- k=2: C(4,2)*C(6,2) = 6 * 15 = 90
- k=3: C(4,3)*C(6,1) = 4 * 6 = 24
- k=4: C(4,4)*C(6,0) = 1 * 1 = 1

Verify sum: 15 + 80 + 90 + 24 + 1 = 210, matches total.

Step 4: Jen wins a prize if at least 2 numbers match, so number of favorable draws is:
90 (k=2) + 24 (k=3) + 1 (k=4) = 115.

Step 5: Jen wins the grand prize if all 4 numbers match, which is 1 way.

Step 6: Probability of grand prize given Jen won a prize = (Number of draws with 4 matches) / (Number of draws with at least 2 matches) = 1 / 115.

Step 7: The fraction is 1/115, m=1, n=115, so m+n=116.

### thinking by Debate Agent qjmV:
First, let&#39;s define the problem clearly:

- The set S has 10 numbers: {1, 2, 3, ..., 10}.
- Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from S.
- Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S.

Jen wins a prize if at least 2 of her chosen numbers are among the 4 randomly chosen numbers.
Jen wins the grand prize if all 4 of her numbers are among the 4 randomly chosen numbers (i.e., her 4 numbers exactly match the 4 randomly chosen numbers).

We want the probability that Jen wins the grand prize given that she wins a prize. This is a conditional probability:

P(grand prize | prize) = P(grand prize and prize) / P(prize) = P(grand prize) / P(prize) (since grand prize is a subset of prize)

Step 1: Total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from S:
Total outcomes = C(10,4) = 210

Step 2: Jen&#39;s chosen 4 numbers are fixed. Let&#39;s denote her set as J.

Step 3: Calculate P(grand prize):
The grand prize occurs if the 4 randomly chosen numbers exactly match Jen&#39;s 4 numbers.
Number of favorable outcomes = 1 (only one set matches exactly)
So, P(grand prize) = 1 / 210

Step 4: Calculate P(prize):
Prize occurs if at least 2 of Jen&#39;s numbers are in the randomly chosen 4 numbers.

We need to count the number of 4-number subsets of S that have at least 2 elements in common with J.

Letâ€™s denote:
- |J| = 4 (Jen&#39;s chosen numbers)
- |S| = 10

For k = 2, 3, 4, count the number of 4-number subsets that have exactly k elements in common with J.

Number of 4-subsets with exactly k elements from J:
= C(4, k) * C(6, 4 - k)

Calculate for k=2,3,4:
- k=2: C(4,2)*C(6,2) = 6 * 15 = 90
- k=3: C(4,3)*C(6,1) = 4 * 6 = 24
- k=4: C(4,4)*C(6,0) = 1 * 1 = 1

Total subsets with at least 2 elements from J = 90 + 24 + 1 = 115

So, P(prize) = 115 / 210

Step 5: Calculate the conditional probability:

P(grand prize | prize) = P(grand prize) / P(prize) = (1/210) / (115/210) = 1/115

Step 6: The fraction is 1/115, which is already in lowest terms.

Therefore, m = 1, n = 115, and m + n = 116.

    <pre>Jen chooses 4 distinct numbers from a set of 10 numbers. The lottery then randomly chooses 4 numbers from the same set. Jen wins a prize if at least 2 of her chosen numbers are among the 4 drawn numbers, and wins the grand prize if all 4 of her numbers match the drawn numbers. We want the probability that Jen wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. The total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is C(10,4) = 210. The number of 4-number subsets that have exactly k numbers in common with Jen&#39;s chosen set is C(4,k)*C(6,4-k). For k=2,3,4, these are 90, 24, and 1 respectively, summing to 115 subsets where Jen wins a prize. The grand prize corresponds to k=4, which is 1 subset. Therefore, the conditional probability is 1/115. The fraction is in lowest terms, so m=1 and n=115, and m+n=116.
