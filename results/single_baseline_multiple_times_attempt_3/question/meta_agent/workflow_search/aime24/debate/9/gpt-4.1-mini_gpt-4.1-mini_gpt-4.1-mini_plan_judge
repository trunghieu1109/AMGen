Question: Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: Jen chooses 4 distinct numbers from a set of 10 numbers. The lottery then randomly chooses 4 numbers from the same set. Jen wins a prize if at least 2 of her chosen numbers are among the 4 drawn numbers, and wins the grand prize if all 4 of her numbers match the drawn numbers. We want the probability that Jen wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. The total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is C(10,4) = 210. The number of 4-number subsets that have exactly k numbers in common with Jen's chosen set is C(4,k)*C(6,4-k). For k=2,3,4, these are 90, 24, and 1 respectively, summing to 115 subsets where Jen wins a prize. The grand prize corresponds to k=4, which is 1 subset. Therefore, the conditional probability is 1/115. The fraction is in lowest terms, so m=1 and n=115, and m+n=116.
