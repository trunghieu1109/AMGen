    <pre>Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

### thinking by Debate Agent 2V4J:
Total lottery draws = C(10,4) = 210 equally likely. Grand prize occurs if the 4 drawn match her 4 picks: 1 way, so P(grand) = 1/210. Winning any prize means at least 2 matches: count draws with exactly k matches is C(4,k)*C(6,4−k). For k=2: 6*15 = 90; k=3: 4*6 = 24; k=4: 1. Total = 90+24+1 = 115, so P(prize) = 115/210. Hence P(grand | prize) = (1/210)/(115/210) = 1/115, in lowest terms. Thus m+n = 1+115 = 116.

### thinking by Debate Agent iTOS:
Total outcomes of draws C(10,4)=210. Jen’s prize if she matches k≥2 of her 4 picks. Number of draws with k matches is C(4,k)·C(6,4−k). For k=2:6·15=90; k=3:4·6=24; k=4:1. Total prize outcomes=90+24+1=115. Grand prize is k=4:1 outcome. So P(grand|prize)=1/115, m+n=1+115=116.

    <pre>Total ways to draw 4 numbers from 10 is C(10,4)=210. Number of draws matching exactly k of Jen’s 4 picks is C(4,k)·C(6,4−k). For k=2: 6·15=90; k=3: 4·6=24; k=4:1. So wins any prize in 90+24+1=115 cases, grand prize in 1 case. Thus P=1/115, m+n=1+115=116.
