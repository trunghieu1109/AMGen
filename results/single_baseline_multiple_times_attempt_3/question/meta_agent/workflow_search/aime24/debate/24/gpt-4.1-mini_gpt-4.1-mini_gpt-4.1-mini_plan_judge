Question: Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations:
\[\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}\]\[\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}\]\[\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}\]
Then the value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: We start with the given system:
log2(x/(yz)) = 1/2
log2(y/(xz)) = 1/3
log2(z/(xy)) = 1/4

Let A = log2(x), B = log2(y), C = log2(z). Then the system becomes:
A - B - C = 1/2
B - A - C = 1/3
C - A - B = 1/4

Adding all three equations:
(A - B - C) + (B - A - C) + (C - A - B) = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4
Simplifies to:
(-A - B - C) = 13/12
So, A + B + C = -13/12.

Adding the first and the sum equation:
2A = 1/2 - 13/12 = -7/12 => A = -7/24
Adding the second and the sum equation:
2B = 1/3 - 13/12 = -9/12 => B = -3/8
Adding the third and the sum equation:
2C = 1/4 - 13/12 = -10/12 => C = -5/12

We want |log2(x^4 y^3 z^2)| = |4A + 3B + 2C|.
Calculate:
4A = 4 * (-7/24) = -7/6
3B = 3 * (-3/8) = -9/8
2C = 2 * (-5/12) = -5/6
Sum = -7/6 - 9/8 - 5/6
Convert to common denominator 24:
-7/6 = -28/24
-9/8 = -27/24
-5/6 = -20/24
Sum = (-28 - 27 - 20)/24 = -75/24 = -25/8
Absolute value = 25/8.

Thus, m = 25, n = 8, and m + n = 33.
