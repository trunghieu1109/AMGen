Question: Find the largest possible real part of \[(75+117i)z+\frac{96+144i}{z}\]where $z$ is a complex number with $|z|=4$.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: We want to maximize the real part of the expression (75+117i)z + (96+144i)/z where |z|=4. Let z = 4e^{iθ}. Then 1/z = (1/4)e^{-iθ}. Substitute these into the expression: (75+117i)(4e^{iθ}) + (96+144i)(1/4)e^{-iθ} = 4(75+117i)e^{iθ} + (1/4)(96+144i)e^{-iθ}. Writing e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ and e^{-iθ} = cosθ - i sinθ, we expand and separate real parts: Real part = 4(75 cosθ - 117 sinθ) + (1/4)(96 cosθ + 144 sinθ) = 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ + 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. To maximize this, write it as R cos(θ + φ) where R = sqrt(324^2 + (-432)^2) = sqrt(104976 + 186624) = sqrt(291600) = 540. The maximum value of the real part is therefore 540.
