Question: Find the largest possible real part of \[(75+117i)z+\frac{96+144i}{z}\]where $z$ is a complex number with $|z|=4$.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: Both agents correctly expressed z as 4e^{iθ} and 1/z as (1/4)e^{-iθ}, and substituted these into the expression. They simplified the expression to find the real part as 324cosθ - 432sinθ. To maximize this, they used the formula for the maximum value of acosθ + bsinθ, which is √(a^2 + b^2). They calculated this to be √(324^2 + 432^2) = √291600 = 540. Both agents arrived at the same correct maximum value for the real part.
