Question: Find the largest possible real part of \[(75+117i)z+\frac{96+144i}{z}\]where $z$ is a complex number with $|z|=4$.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: We set z = 4e^{iθ}. Then (75+117i)z = (300+468i)e^{iθ} and (96+144i)/z = (24+36i)e^{-iθ}.  The real part is 300cosθ−468sinθ +24cosθ+36sinθ = 324cosθ−432sinθ, whose maximum is √(324²+(-432)²) = 540.
