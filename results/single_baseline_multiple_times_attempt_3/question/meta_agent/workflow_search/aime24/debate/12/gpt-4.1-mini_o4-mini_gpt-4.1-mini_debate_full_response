Write z=4e^{iθ}. Then (75+117i)z = (75+117i)4e^{iθ}= (300+468i)e^{iθ}, and (96+144i)/z=(96+144i)/(4e^{iθ})=(24+36i)e^{-iθ}. Sum E=(300+468i)e^{iθ}+(24+36i)e^{-iθ}. Its real part is 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ +24 cosθ +36 sinθ =324 cosθ -432 sinθ. This attains maximum sqrt(324^2+(-432)^2)=sqrt(104976+186624)=sqrt(291600)=540.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent 1vqY:\nWe want to maximize Re[(75+117i)z + (96+144i)/z] subject to |z|=4. Write z = 4e^{iθ}. Then expression becomes 4(75+117i)e^{iθ} + (96+144i)/(4e^{iθ}) = 4(75+117i)e^{iθ} + (24+36i)e^{-iθ}. Its real part R = Re[4(a+ib)e^{iθ} + (c+id)e^{-iθ}] with a+ib =75+117i, c+id =24+36i.  Re[(a+ib)e^{iθ}] = a cosθ - b sinθ, Re[(c+id)e^{-iθ}] = c cosθ + d sinθ.  Thus R = (4a+c)cosθ + (-4b + d) sinθ = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.  Its maximum is sqrt(324^2 + (-432)^2) = 540.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent mrN6:\n540\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 1vqY:\n540\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
