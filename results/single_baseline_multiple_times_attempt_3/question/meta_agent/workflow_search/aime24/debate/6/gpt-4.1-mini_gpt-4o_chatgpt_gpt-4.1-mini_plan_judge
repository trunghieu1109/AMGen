Question: Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.

proposed answer: To find the smallest sphere that can contain a rectangular box with given surface area and volume, we need to determine the maximum possible space diagonal of the box. The space diagonal is given by sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) for a box with dimensions x, y, z. The radius of the sphere is half this diagonal, so we need to maximize x^2 + y^2 + z^2. The constraints are: 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 and xyz = 23. We use the identity (x + y + z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + zx) to express x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x + y + z)^2 - 54. We need to find x, y, z that satisfy these constraints and maximize x^2 + y^2 + z^2. By testing possible values and using the constraints, we find that the maximum value of x^2 + y^2 + z^2 is 29. Therefore, r^2 = (1/4)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) = 29/4. Thus, p = 29 and q = 4, so p + q = 33.
