    <pre>Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.

### thinking by Debate Agent nRpa:
We need the radius r of the smallest sphere that contains every rectangular box with surface area 54 and volume 23. For a box of edges a,b,c the sphere radius is half the space diagonal: r = sqrt(a^2+b^2+c^2)/2. We must choose r large enough for the worst‐case box among those satisfying ab+bc+ca = 27 and abc = 23, i.e. maximize a^2+b^2+c^2 under these constraints. By symmetry the maximum occurs when two edges are equal, say b = c = y and a = x. Then constraints: 2xy + y^2 = 27 and x y^2 = 23. From the second x = 23/y^2; substitute into the first gives y^3 − 27y + 46 = 0, whose positive roots are y = 2 and y = −1 + 2√6. For y = 2, x = 23/4 = 5.75 and a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 5.75^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 = 33.0625 + 4 + 4 = 41.0625, so r^2 = 41.0625/4 = 657/64 ≈ 10.266. For the other root y ≈ 3.898, x ≈ 1.513 gives a smaller r^2 ≈ 8.174. Thus the maximal r^2 = 657/64, so p = 657, q = 64 and p+q = 721.

### thinking by Debate Agent 8e87:
We need the maximal half‐diagonal over all boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23.  If the edges are x,y,z then SA gives xy+yz+zx=27 and V gives xyz=23.  The sphere radius is r=½√(x²+y²+z²), so r²=(x²+y²+z²)/4.  By symmetry, extrema occur when two edges are equal, say x=y=a and z=b.  Then constraints are a²+2ab=27 and a²b=23.  Solving gives (a,b)=(2,23/4) or the other root; the largest x²+y²+z² occurs at (2,2,23/4).  Then x²+y²+z²=2·2²+(23/4)²=657/16, so r²=(657/16)/4=657/64.  Hence p+q=657+64=721.

    <pre>We want the radius r of the smallest sphere that encloses any box with surface area 54 and volume 23. For a box with edges a,b,c, surface area gives ab+bc+ca=27 and volume gives abc=23. The sphere radius is half the space diagonal: r=½√(a²+b²+c²), so r²=(a²+b²+c²)/4. To maximize a²+b²+c² under the two constraints, by symmetry we set two edges equal: b=c=y, a=x. Then xy²=23 and y²+2xy=27. From xy²=23 ⇒ x=23/y²; plugging into y²+2(23/y)=27 gives y³−27y+46=0 whose positive roots are y=2 and y=−1+2√6. For y=2, x=23/4=5.75, so a²+b²+c²=2·2²+(23/4)²=657/16 ⇒ r²=(657/16)/4=657/64. The other root gives a smaller r². Thus the maximal r²=657/64, so p+q=657+64=721.
