Question: Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.

proposed answer: Let the dimensions of the box be x, y, z. Given surface area 54, we have 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 => xy + yz + zx = 27. Given volume 23, xyz = 23. The smallest sphere containing the box has radius r = (1/2) * sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2), so r^2 = (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)/4. Using the identity (x + y + z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + zx), we get x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x + y + z)^2 - 2*27 = (x + y + z)^2 - 54. Let S = x + y + z. We want to minimize r^2 = (S^2 - 54)/4 subject to xyz = 23 and xy + yz + zx = 27. By AM-GM, S/3 >= (xyz)^{1/3} => S >= 3 * 23^{1/3} â‰ˆ 8.53. By Cauchy-Schwarz, xy + yz + zx <= S^2 / 3 => 27 <= S^2 / 3 => S^2 >= 81 => S >= 9. Since 9 > 8.53, the minimal S satisfying both is 9. Check if S=9 is possible: the cubic t^3 - 9 t^2 + 27 t - 23 = 0 has three positive roots (verified by sign changes and Descartes' rule). Therefore, minimal S = 9. Then x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 81 - 54 = 27, so r^2 = 27/4. Thus, r^2 = 27/4, with p=27 and q=4, so p+q=31.
