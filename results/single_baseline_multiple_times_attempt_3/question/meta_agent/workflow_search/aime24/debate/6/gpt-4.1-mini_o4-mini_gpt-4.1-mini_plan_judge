Question: Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.

proposed answer: We want the radius r of the smallest sphere that encloses any box with surface area 54 and volume 23. For a box with edges a,b,c, surface area gives ab+bc+ca=27 and volume gives abc=23. The sphere radius is half the space diagonal: r=½√(a²+b²+c²), so r²=(a²+b²+c²)/4. To maximize a²+b²+c² under the two constraints, by symmetry we set two edges equal: b=c=y, a=x. Then xy²=23 and y²+2xy=27. From xy²=23 ⇒ x=23/y²; plugging into y²+2(23/y)=27 gives y³−27y+46=0 whose positive roots are y=2 and y=−1+2√6. For y=2, x=23/4=5.75, so a²+b²+c²=2·2²+(23/4)²=657/16 ⇒ r²=(657/16)/4=657/64. The other root gives a smaller r². Thus the maximal r²=657/64, so p+q=657+64=721.
