Question: Eight circles of radius $34$ are sequentially tangent, and two of the circles are tangent to $AB$ and $BC$ of triangle $ABC$, respectively. $2024$ circles of radius $1$ can be arranged in the same manner. The inradius of triangle $ABC$ can be expressed as $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: Let AC=L. For n circles of radius r in a row tangent to AC, first to AB, last to BC, one shows L=2r(n−1)+r[cot(A/2)+cot(C/2)]. Equating for (r,n)=(34,8) and (1,2024) gives
476+34S=4046+S ⇒33S=3570 ⇒S=cot(A/2)+cot(C/2)=1190/11.
Then L=4046+S=45696/11. In any triangle cot(A/2)+cot(C/2)= (b=L)/r_in, so r_in=L/S=(45696/11)/(1190/11)=45696/1190=192/5. Hence m+n=192+5=197.
