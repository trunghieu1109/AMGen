    <pre>Eight circles of radius $34$ are sequentially tangent, and two of the circles are tangent to $AB$ and $BC$ of triangle $ABC$, respectively. $2024$ circles of radius $1$ can be arranged in the same manner. The inradius of triangle $ABC$ can be expressed as $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

### thinking by Debate Agent 5N7Y:
Interpret the eight radius‐34 circles as a row of 8 equal circles each tangent to the base AC and sequentially tangent to each other, with the first touching AB and the last touching BC.  If M circles of radius r sit on AC (length b=AC), then the centers lie on the line y=r and span a horizontal length (M–1)·2r, leaving end gaps so that the first and last circles touch the sides.  One finds
   first‐gap = r cot(∠A/2),  last‐gap = r cot(∠C/2),
so b = 2r[(M–1) + cot(A/2)+cot(C/2)].
Given (r,M) = (34,8) and (1,2024) give the same b, equate
   68[7 + C] = 2[2023 + C],  where C = cot(A/2)+cot(C/2).
Solve 68·7 + 68C = 4046 + 2C ⇒ 66C = 3570 ⇒ C = 595/11.
But standard in‐triangle formulas give
   cot(A/2)+cot(C/2) = b/r_in,
so r_in = b/C.  From the second data b = 2[2023 + C] = 45696/11, hence
   r_in = (45696/11)/(595/11) = 45696/595 = 384/5.
Thus m+n = 384+5 = 389.

### thinking by Debate Agent K3au:
We interpret the eight circles of radius 34 and the 2024 circles of radius 1 as two chains of equal tangent circles all touching the base AC of triangle ABC; the first circle of each chain also touches AB, the last also touches BC.  Label the base AC as a horizontal line, with A at x=0 and C at x=L.  A chain of n circles of radius R has centers at (x_k,R) with x_{k+1}-x_k=2R, x_1 determined by tangency to AB, and x_n determined by tangency to BC.  Denote tan(A)=s&gt;0 for ∠A at A, and tan(C)=w&gt;0 for ∠C at C.  One finds x_1=R*(1+√{1+s^2})/s and L−x_n=R*(1+√{1+w^2})/w, so for n and R these give L=R[α+B+2(n−1)] where α=(1+√{1+s^2})/s=cot(A/2), B=(1+√{1+w^2})/w=cot(C/2).  Equating L for (n,R)=(8,34) and (2024,1) yields 34[α+B+14]=1[α+B+4046], so α+B=cot(A/2)+cot(C/2)=1190/11.  A direct area‐and‐semiperimeter calculation gives the inradius r=L·sin(A/2)·sin(C/2)/sin[(A+C)/2], which simplifies via sin[(A+C)/2]=(cot(A/2)+cot(C/2))·sin(A/2)·sin(C/2) to r=L/(cot(A/2)+cot(C/2)).  Since L=45696/11 and cot(A/2)+cot(C/2)=1190/11, we get r=(45696/11)/(1190/11)=45696/1190=192/5.  Hence m+n=192+5=197.

    <pre>Let AC=L. For n circles of radius r in a row tangent to AC, first to AB, last to BC, one shows L=2r(n−1)+r[cot(A/2)+cot(C/2)]. Equating for (r,n)=(34,8) and (1,2024) gives
476+34S=4046+S ⇒33S=3570 ⇒S=cot(A/2)+cot(C/2)=1190/11.
Then L=4046+S=45696/11. In any triangle cot(A/2)+cot(C/2)= (b=L)/r_in, so r_in=L/S=(45696/11)/(1190/11)=45696/1190=192/5. Hence m+n=192+5=197.
