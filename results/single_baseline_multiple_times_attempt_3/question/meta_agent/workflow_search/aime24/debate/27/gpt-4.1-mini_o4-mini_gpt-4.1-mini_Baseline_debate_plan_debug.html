    <pre>Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.

### thinking by Debate Agent EbIk:
We need the largest 4-digit N=ABCD such that replacing any one digit by 1 gives a multiple of 7. Let x=N mod7. For each position i, f_i≡N+weight_i·(1−digit_i)≡0 mod7, where weight for thousands=1000≡–1, hundreds=100≡2, tens=10≡3, ones=1. This gives the congruences x≡1−A, x≡2B−2, x≡3C−3, x≡D−1 (mod7). Solving these for digits 1≤A≤9, 0≤B,C,D≤9 integer and checking N mod7=x, the maximal solution is A=5, B=6, C=9, D=4, so N=5694. Then Q=⌊5694/1000⌋=5, R=694, and Q+R=699.

### thinking by Debate Agent Ntkk:
We want the largest 4-digit N=abcd such that replacing any single digit by 1 yields a multiple of 7. Working mod 7 with 1000≡6,100≡2,10≡3 gives four linear congruences. Solving them yields a≡5,b≡6,c≡2,d≡4 mod 7 with digits 0–9. The only possibilities are (a,b,c,d)=(5,6,2,4) or (5,6,9,4), i.e. N=5624 or 5694. The larger is 5694. Dividing by 1000 gives Q=5, R=694, so Q+R=699.

    <pre>Let N=abcd. Replacing digit in place with 1 adds (1–digit)·place‐weight. Mod 7 weights are 1000≡–1,100≡2,10≡3,1≡1. Requiring each replaced number ≡0 mod 7 gives a system of congruences for N mod 7. Solving yields N=5694 as the greatest 4-digit solution. Then dividing by 1000 gives Q=5 and R=694, so Q+R=699.
