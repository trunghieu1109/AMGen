Question: Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: Let N=abcd. Replacing digit in place with 1 adds (1–digit)·place‐weight. Mod 7 weights are 1000≡–1,100≡2,10≡3,1≡1. Requiring each replaced number ≡0 mod 7 gives a system of congruences for N mod 7. Solving yields N=5694 as the greatest 4-digit solution. Then dividing by 1000 gives Q=5 and R=694, so Q+R=699.
