Question: Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The problem requires finding the greatest four-digit number N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d such that changing any one digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. By analyzing the modular conditions and testing values for digits, the first approach found N=9400 with Q+R=409, but this failed to satisfy all conditions upon rechecking. The second approach, more thorough, found N=5624 satisfies all divisibility conditions when any digit is changed to 1, and yields Q=5, R=624, so Q+R=629. Verifying the divisibility for N=5624 confirms all conditions hold, making 5624 the greatest such number. Therefore, the correct answer is 629.
