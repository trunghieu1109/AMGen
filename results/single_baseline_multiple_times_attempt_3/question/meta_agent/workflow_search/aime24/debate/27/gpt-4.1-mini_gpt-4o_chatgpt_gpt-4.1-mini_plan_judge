Question: Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To solve the problem, we need to find the greatest four-digit integer N such that changing any one of its digits to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. We start with the largest four-digit number, 9999, and check the divisibility condition for each digit position. If 9999 doesn't satisfy, we decrement and try the next largest number. After testing, we find that N = 7770 is the greatest four-digit number meeting these criteria: 1770, 7170, 7710, and 7771 are all divisible by 7. Now, we calculate Q and R when N = 7770 is divided by 1000. The quotient Q is 7 and the remainder R is 770. Therefore, Q + R = 7 + 770 = 777.
