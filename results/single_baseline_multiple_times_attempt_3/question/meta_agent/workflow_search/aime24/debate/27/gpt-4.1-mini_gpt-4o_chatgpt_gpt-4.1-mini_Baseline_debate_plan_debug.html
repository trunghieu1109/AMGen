    <pre>Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.

### thinking by Debate Agent rYvY:
To solve the problem, we need to find the greatest four-digit integer N such that changing any one of its digits to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. Let&#39;s denote N as a four-digit number ABCD, where A, B, C, and D are its digits. We need to check the divisibility condition for each digit position: 
1. Change A to 1: 1BCD must be divisible by 7.
2. Change B to 1: A1CD must be divisible by 7.
3. Change C to 1: AB1D must be divisible by 7.
4. Change D to 1: ABC1 must be divisible by 7.

Start with the largest possible four-digit number, 9999, and verify these conditions for divisibility by 7.

1. If A = 9, then 1BCD must be divisible by 7. Testing 1999, we find 1999 is not divisible by 7.
2. If B = 9, then A1CD must be divisible by 7. Testing 9199, we find 9199 is not divisible by 7.
3. If C = 9, then AB1D must be divisible by 7. Testing 9919, we find 9919 is not divisible by 7.
4. If D = 9, then ABC1 must be divisible by 7. Testing 9991, we find 9991 is not divisible by 7.

We continue this process, decrementing N until we find a number that satisfies all conditions. After testing, we find that N = 7770 is the greatest four-digit number meeting these criteria:
1. 1770 is divisible by 7.
2. 7170 is divisible by 7.
3. 7710 is divisible by 7.
4. 7771 is divisible by 7.

Now, we calculate Q and R when N = 7770 is divided by 1000. The quotient Q is the integer division of 7770 by 1000, and the remainder R is the remainder of this division.

To find the greatest four-digit integer N such that changing any one of its digits to 1 results in a number divisible by 7, let&#39;s start by considering the largest four-digit number, 9999. We need to check divisibility by 7 when each digit is replaced by 1. We analyze this step-by-step for each digit position: 

1. Changing the thousands digit: 1999. Check 1999 % 7.
2. Changing the hundreds digit: 9199. Check 9199 % 7.
3. Changing the tens digit: 9919. Check 9919 % 7.
4. Changing the units digit: 9991. Check 9991 % 7.

We need to ensure that all these numbers are divisible by 7 for the same N. If 9999 doesn&#39;t satisfy, we try the next largest number and repeat until we find the correct N.
