Question: A list of positive integers has the following properties:
$\bullet$ The sum of the items in the list is $30$.
$\bullet$ The unique mode of the list is $9$.
$\bullet$ The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.
Find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: We need a list of positive integers summing to 30, unique mode 9, and an even-length list so the median is the average of two middle terms and is an integer not in the list. Trying length 4 with two 9s and two other numbers gives 9+9+a+b=30 so a+b=12. Sorted list [a,b,9,9] has median (b+9)/2. This must be an integer not equal to a, b, or 9. Checking pairs (1,11),(2,10),(3,9),(4,8),(5,7),(6,6) shows only (5,7) yields median (7+9)/2=8 which is not in the list and 9 remains the unique mode. Thus list is [5,7,9,9] and sum of squares is 25+49+81+81=236.
