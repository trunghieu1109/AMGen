    <pre>A list of positive integers has the following properties:
$\bullet$ The sum of the items in the list is $30$.
$\bullet$ The unique mode of the list is $9$.
$\bullet$ The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.
Find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

### thinking by Debate Agent CJVO:
Let&#39;s denote the list as a sorted list of positive integers. The sum of the items is 30. The unique mode is 9, so 9 appears more times than any other number. The median is a positive integer that does not appear in the list.

Step 1: Since the median is not in the list, the list must have an even number of elements (because for an odd number of elements, the median is the middle element, which is in the list). For an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle elements. Since the median is a positive integer not in the list, the two middle elements must be two consecutive integers whose average is an integer not in the list.

Step 2: Let the list have 2n elements. The two middle elements are the nth and (n+1)th elements. Their average is the median, which is an integer not in the list.

Step 3: Since the median is not in the list, the two middle elements must be consecutive integers m and m+1, so their average is m + 0.5, which is not an integer. So this can&#39;t be the case.

Alternatively, if the two middle elements are equal integers m, the median is m, which is in the list. So that can&#39;t be the case either.

Step 4: So the median is an integer not in the list, so the two middle elements must be two integers whose average is an integer not in the list. For example, the two middle elements could be a and b, with (a + b)/2 = median, median integer, and median not in the list. So a and b must be two integers such that their average is an integer not in the list.

Step 5: For the average to be an integer, a and b must have the same parity (both even or both odd). Since the median is not in the list, median ≠ a and median ≠ b.

Step 6: Let&#39;s try to find a simple example. Suppose the list length is 6 elements (even number). The median is the average of the 3rd and 4th elements.

Step 7: The list is sorted: x1 ≤ x2 ≤ x3 ≤ x4 ≤ x5 ≤ x6.

The median = (x3 + x4)/2, and median is integer not in the list.

Step 8: The unique mode is 9, so 9 appears more times than any other number.

Step 9: Let&#39;s try to construct such a list.

Try the list: [a, b, c, d, e, f], sum = 30, mode = 9 unique, median integer not in list.

Try 9 appears twice (minimum to be mode), others appear once.

Try list: [x, y, 9, 9, z, w], sorted.

Sum: x + y + 9 + 9 + z + w = 30.

Median = (3rd + 4th)/2 = (9 + 9)/2 = 9, but 9 appears in list, so median is 9 in list, contradicts condition.

Try 9 appears three times: [x, 9, 9, 9, y, z].

Sorted: x ≤ 9 ≤ 9 ≤ 9 ≤ y ≤ z.

Median = (3rd + 4th)/2 = (9 + 9)/2 = 9, again median in list.

Try 9 appears four times: [9, 9, 9, 9, x, y].

Median = (3rd + 4th)/2 = (9 + 9)/2 = 9 in list.

Try 9 appears once: can&#39;t be mode.

Try 9 appears twice but not adjacent.

Try list with length 5 (odd), median is middle element, which is in list, so median not in list impossible.

Try length 4:

Median = (2nd + 3rd)/2.

Try list: [a, b, c, d], sum=30.

Mode is 9 unique.

Try 9 appears twice: [a, 9, 9, d], sorted.

Median = (9 + 9)/2 = 9 in list.

Try 9 appears once: no mode.

Try 9 appears thrice: impossible with 4 elements.

Try length 7.

Median is 4th element.

Median in list, so median not in list impossible.

Try length 8.

Median = (4th + 5th)/2.

Try 9 appears twice.

Try list: [a, b, c, 9, 9, d, e, f], sum=30.

Median = (9 + 9)/2 = 9 in list.

Try 9 appears thrice: [a, b, 9, 9, 9, c, d, e], median = (9 + 9)/2 = 9 in list.

Try 9 appears once: no mode.

Try 9 appears four times: [9, 9, 9, 9, a, b, c, d], median = (9 + a)/2.

Wait, 4th and 5th elements: 9 and a.

Median = (9 + a)/2.

Median integer not in list.

Try a &lt; 9, so list sorted: a &lt; 9, so 5th element is 9 or a?

Sorted list: a ≤ b ≤ c ≤ d ≤ e ≤ f ≤ g ≤ h.

Try 9 appears four times: positions 2,3,4,5.

Then median = (4th + 5th)/2 = (9 + 9)/2 = 9 in list.

Try 9 appears three times at positions 3,4,5: median = (4th + 5th)/2 = (9 + 9)/2=9 in list.

Try 9 appears two times at positions 4 and 5: median = (4th + 5th)/2 = (9 + 9)/2=9 in list.

Try 9 appears once: no mode.

Try length 9.

Median is 5th element, in list.

Try length 10.

Median = (5th + 6th)/2.

Try 9 appears twice at 5th and 6th positions.

Median = (9 + 9)/2 = 9 in list.

Try 9 appears twice at 4th and 5th positions.

Median = (4th + 5th)/2 = (9 + 9)/2 = 9 in list.

Try 9 appears once: no mode.

Try 9 appears thrice at 4th, 5th, 6th.

Median = (5th + 6th)/2 = (9 + 9)/2=9 in list.

Try 9 appears four times at 4th,5th,6th,7th.

Median = (5th + 6th)/2 = (9 + 9)/2=9 in list.

Try 9 appears five times at 3rd to 7th.

Median = (5th + 6th)/2 = (9 + 9)/2=9 in list.

Try 9 appears six times at 3rd to 8th.

Median = (5th + 6th)/2=9 in list.

Try 9 appears seven times at 2nd to 8th.

Median = (5th + 6th)/2=9 in list.

Try 9 appears eight times at 2nd to 9th.

Median = (5th + 6th)/2=9 in list.

Try 9 appears nine times at 1st to 9th.

Median = (5th + 6th)/2=9 in list.

Try 9 appears ten times.

Sum would be at least 90, too big.

Step 10: Try median between two numbers not equal to 9.

Try median = 7.5, between 7 and 8, but median must be integer.

Try median = 8, but 8 not in list.

Try median = 8, median not in list, so 8 not in list.

Then middle elements are 7 and 9, average = 8.

So middle elements are 7 and 9.

Try list length even, median = (7 + 9)/2 = 8.

Median = 8, not in list.

Step 11: So middle elements are 7 and 9.

Step 12: Since 9 is mode, 9 appears more times than any other number.

Step 13: Try list length 6: [x, y, 7, 9, a, b], sorted.

Sum = x + y + 7 + 9 + a + b = 30.

9 appears more times than any other number, so 9 appears at least twice.

So 9 appears twice, so 9 appears in positions 4 and another position.

Try list: [x, 7, 9, 9, a, b], sorted.

Median = (3rd + 4th)/2 = (9 + 9)/2 = 9 in list.

No.

Try [7, 9, 9, a, b, c], median = (3rd + 4th)/2 = (9 + a)/2 = 8.

So (9 + a)/2 = 8 → 9 + a = 16 → a = 7.

So a = 7.

List: [7, 7, 9, 9, b, c], sorted.

Sum = 7 + 7 + 9 + 9 + b + c = 30 → 32 + b + c = 30 → b + c = -2, impossible.

Try length 8: [w, x, y, 7, 9, z, u, v], median = (4th + 5th)/2 = (7 + 9)/2 = 8.

Sum = w + x + y + 7 + 9 + z + u + v = 30.

9 appears more times than any other number.

Try 9 appears twice: positions 5 and another.

Try list: [w, x, y, 7, 9, 9, u, v], sorted.

Sum = w + x + y + 7 + 9 + 9 + u + v = 30.

Sum of known numbers: 7 + 9 + 9 = 25.

So w + x + y + u + v = 5.

Try to minimize other numbers to 1.

Try w = x = y = u = v = 1.

Sum = 5 + 25 = 30.

Check mode: 9 appears twice, 1 appears 5 times.

Mode is 1, not 9.

Try 9 appears three times.

List: [w, x, y, 7, 9, 9, 9, v], sum = 30.

Sum known: 7 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 34.

Sum w + x + y + v = -4, impossible.

Try 9 appears twice, 7 appears twice.

List: [w, x, 7, 7, 9, 9, u, v], sum=30.

Sum known: 7+7+9+9=32.

Sum others: w+x+u+v = -2, impossible.

Try 9 appears twice, 6 appears twice.

Sum known: 6+6+9+9=30.

Sum others: w+x+u+v=0.

### thinking by Debate Agent 1FYS:
Let&#39;s analyze the problem step by step.

1. The list consists of positive integers.
2. The sum of the list items is 30.
3. The unique mode of the list is 9, meaning 9 appears more times than any other number.
4. The median is a positive integer that does not appear in the list.

First, let&#39;s consider the mode condition. The mode is 9, so 9 must appear at least twice (to be unique mode).

Since the median is a positive integer not in the list, the list must have an odd number of elements (so the median is the middle element) or an even number of elements (median is average of two middle elements).

If the median is an integer not in the list, and the median is the middle element (odd length), then that median value is not in the list.

If the list length is odd, median is the middle element. Since median is not in the list, the median value must be between two numbers in the sorted list.

If the list length is even, median is average of two middle numbers. The median is an integer not in the list, so the average of the two middle numbers is an integer not in the list.

Let&#39;s try to find the list.

Assume the list length is odd, say n=5 or 7.

Try n=5:
Sorted list: a1 &lt;= a2 &lt;= a3 &lt;= a4 &lt;= a5
Median = a3
Median not in the list, so a3 is not in the list, which is impossible because median is a3.

So median cannot be a3 if median not in list.

So n cannot be odd.

Try n=6 (even):
Median = (a3 + a4)/2
Median is integer not in list.

So (a3 + a4)/2 = median (integer), median not in list.

We want to find 6 positive integers summing to 30, with mode 9, median integer not in list.

Mode 9 means 9 appears more times than any other number.

Try 9 appears twice (minimum for unique mode).

Let&#39;s try to find such 6 numbers:

Let the list be sorted: a1 &lt;= a2 &lt;= a3 &lt;= a4 &lt;= a5 &lt;= a6
Median = (a3 + a4)/2 = m (integer), m not in list.

Try 9 appears twice, so 9 is a5 and a6 (since 9 is large).

Sum of list = 30
So a1 + a2 + a3 + a4 + 9 + 9 = 30
=&gt; a1 + a2 + a3 + a4 = 12

Median = (a3 + a4)/2 = m
m is integer not in list.

Try some pairs (a3, a4) with average integer not in list.

Try a3=5, a4=7, median=6 (6 not in list)
Sum a1 + a2 + 5 + 7 = 12 =&gt; a1 + a2 = 0 (impossible as positive integers)

Try a3=4, a4=8, median=6 (6 not in list)
Sum a1 + a2 + 4 + 8 = 12 =&gt; a1 + a2 = 0 (impossible)

Try a3=3, a4=9, median=6 (but 9 is in list, so median is in list, no)

Try a3=3, a4=5, median=4 (4 not in list)
Sum a1 + a2 + 3 + 5 = 12 =&gt; a1 + a2 = 4
Try a1=1, a2=3 (3 already chosen as a3), so can&#39;t have duplicate 3 more than twice.

Mode is 9 twice, 3 appears twice, so mode not unique.

Try a1=1, a2=3
List: 1,3,3,5,9,9
Sum=1+3+3+5+9+9=30
Median=(3+5)/2=4 (integer, not in list)
Mode: 3 appears twice, 9 appears twice, mode not unique.

Try a1=1, a2=2
List:1,2,3,5,9,9
Sum=1+2+3+5+9+9=29 (less than 30)
Try a1=2, a2=2
List:2,2,3,5,9,9
Sum=2+2+3+5+9+9=30
Median=(3+5)/2=4 (integer not in list)
Mode: 2 appears twice, 9 appears twice, mode not unique.

Try a3=2, a4=6, median=4 (integer not in list)
Sum a1+a2+2+6=12 =&gt; a1+a2=4
Try a1=1, a2=3
List: 1,3,2,6,9,9 sorted is 1,2,3,6,9,9
Sum=1+2+3+6+9+9=30
Median=(3+6)/2=4.5 (not integer)
No.

Try a3=3, a4=7, median=5 (integer not in list)
Sum a1+a2+3+7=12 =&gt; a1+a2=2
Try a1=1, a2=1

We see that with 6 elements it is hard to find such a list.

Try 4 elements:
Sum=30
Median=(a2+a3)/2 integer not in list
Mode=9 unique
Try list: 9,9,x,y sum 30
So x+y=12
Median=(a2+a3)/2
Sorted list: a1 &lt;= a2 &lt;= a3 &lt;= a4
a1, a2, a3, a4
a2 and a3 average is median
Try a1=1, a2=4, a3=8, a4=9
Sum=1+4+8+9=22 no
Try a1=1, a2=3, a3=8, a4=9 sum=21 no
Try a1=1, a2=3, a3=9, a4=9 sum=22 no
Try a1=1, a2=2, a3=9, a4=9 sum=21 no
Try a1=3, a2=3, a3=9, a4=9 sum=24 no
Try a1=2, a2=4, a3=9, a4=9 sum=24 no
Try a1=1, a2=5, a3=9, a4=9 sum=24 no
Try a1=3, a2=6, a3=9, a4=9 sum=27 no
Try a1=3, a2=7, a3=9, a4=9 sum=28 no
Try a1=4, a2=7, a3=9, a4=9 sum=29 no
Try a1=5, a2=7, a3=9, a4=9 sum=30 median=(7+9)/2=8 (not in list)
Mode=9 appears twice, 7 once, 5 once, 9 unique mode
Median=8 not in list
Sum=5+7+9+9=30
Check mode: 9 twice, others once
Median=(7+9)/2=8 integer not in list
All conditions met.

Now find sum of squares:
5^2=25
7^2=49
9^2=81
9^2=81
Sum=25+49+81+81=236

    <pre>The list must have a sum of 30, unique mode 9, and median an integer not in the list. The median not in the list implies an even number of elements, so the median is the average of the two middle elements. For the median to be an integer not in the list, the two middle elements must be two integers whose average is an integer not in the list. Trying various lengths and combinations, the only suitable list found is [5, 7, 9, 9]. The sum is 30, the unique mode is 9 (appearing twice), and the median is (7+9)/2 = 8, which is an integer not in the list. The sum of squares is 5^2 + 7^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 = 25 + 49 + 81 + 81 = 236.
