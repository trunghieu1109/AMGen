Question: A list of positive integers has the following properties:
$\bullet$ The sum of the items in the list is $30$.
$\bullet$ The unique mode of the list is $9$.
$\bullet$ The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.
Find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To solve the problem, we need to construct a list of positive integers that satisfies all the given conditions: the sum of the list is 30, the unique mode is 9, and the median is a positive integer not in the list. The list must have an even number of elements for the median to be a number not in the list. Let's try with 6 elements: [9, 9, 9, a, b, c] where a + b + c = 3. However, this doesn't work as the median would be in the list. Let's try 10 elements: [1, 2, 3, 9, 9, 9, 9, 2, 2, 2]. The sum is 30, the mode is 9, and the median is (9 + 2)/2 = 5.5, which is not in the list. This satisfies all conditions. The sum of squares is 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 = 1 + 4 + 9 + 81 + 81 + 81 + 81 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 350.
