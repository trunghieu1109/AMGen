Question: A list of positive integers has the following properties:
$\bullet$ The sum of the items in the list is $30$.
$\bullet$ The unique mode of the list is $9$.
$\bullet$ The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.
Find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The list must have a sum of 30, unique mode 9, and median an integer not in the list. The median not in the list implies an even number of elements, so the median is the average of the two middle elements. For the median to be an integer not in the list, the two middle elements must be two integers whose average is an integer not in the list. Trying various lengths and combinations, the only suitable list found is [5, 7, 9, 9]. The sum is 30, the unique mode is 9 (appearing twice), and the median is (7+9)/2 = 8, which is an integer not in the list. The sum of squares is 5^2 + 7^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 = 25 + 49 + 81 + 81 = 236.
