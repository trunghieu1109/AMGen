    <pre>A list of positive integers has the following properties:
$\bullet$ The sum of the items in the list is $30$.
$\bullet$ The unique mode of the list is $9$.
$\bullet$ The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.
Find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

### thinking by Debate Agent qVQo:
We need a list of positive integers summing to 30, with unique mode 9 and an even-length list so that the median (the average of the two middle terms) can be an integer not in the list.

Let f9 be the frequency of 9. If f9≥3 then 9s alone contribute ≥27, leaving at most 3 to distribute among other terms. One can check that either another number ties 9 in frequency or the median fails. So f9=2.

Write the list in nondecreasing order. There are 2 nines and two other positive integers summing to 12 (since 30−18=12) when n=4. Call them x≤y with x+y=12. Sorted list is [x,y,9,9], so the median is (y+9)/2, which must be an integer m not in the list.

Possible pairs (x,y): (1,11),(2,10),(3,9),(4,8),(5,7),(6,6). We need y&lt;9 (otherwise y becomes one of the 9s when sorted) and y odd so that y+9 is even. The only suitable pair is (5,7), giving the list [5,7,9,9]. Then median=(7+9)/2=8, which is not in the list, and 9 is the unique mode.

Sum of squares =5^2+7^2+9^2+9^2=25+49+81+81=236.

### thinking by Debate Agent sN8X:
We look for a list of positive integers summing to 30, unique mode 9, and median an integer not in the list. An odd-length list would have the median equal to an element of the list, so the list must have even length. Try length 4: let the list be [9,9,a,b] with a+b=12 and a&lt;b≠9. The median is (the 2nd+3rd entries)/2. Sorting gives [a,b,9,9], so median=(b+9)/2 must be an integer k not equal to any list element. The only solution is a=5,b=7 giving list [5,7,9,9], median=(7+9)/2=8 not in the list. Sum of squares =5²+7²+9²+9²=25+49+81+81=236.

    <pre>We need a list of positive integers summing to 30, unique mode 9, and an even-length list so the median is the average of two middle terms and is an integer not in the list. Trying length 4 with two 9s and two other numbers gives 9+9+a+b=30 so a+b=12. Sorted list [a,b,9,9] has median (b+9)/2. This must be an integer not equal to a, b, or 9. Checking pairs (1,11),(2,10),(3,9),(4,8),(5,7),(6,6) shows only (5,7) yields median (7+9)/2=8 which is not in the list and 9 remains the unique mode. Thus list is [5,7,9,9] and sum of squares is 25+49+81+81=236.
