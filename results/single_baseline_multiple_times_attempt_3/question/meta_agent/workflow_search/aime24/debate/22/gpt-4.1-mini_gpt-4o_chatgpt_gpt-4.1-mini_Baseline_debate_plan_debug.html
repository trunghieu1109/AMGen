    <pre>A list of positive integers has the following properties:
$\bullet$ The sum of the items in the list is $30$.
$\bullet$ The unique mode of the list is $9$.
$\bullet$ The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.
Find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

### thinking by Debate Agent 0sya:
To satisfy the conditions, we first need to determine the number of elements in the list. The median is a positive integer not in the list, so the list must have an even number of elements since with an odd number, the median would be an element of the list. Let the number of elements be 2n. The sum of the elements is 30, and the mode is 9, meaning 9 appears more frequently than any other number. Let&#39;s assume there are at least 3 nines, as having 2 nines could be tied with another number, which would not make 9 the unique mode. Assume the list has 6 elements (2n = 6), which makes it possible to have a median not in the list. Thus, the list could be [a, b, 9, 9, 9, c] where a, b, and c are integers, a &lt; b &lt; 9 &lt; c, and the median is (9 + b)/2, which is not an integer. If we try 8 elements, we have [a, b, 9, 9, 9, 9, c, d] with a &lt; b &lt; 9 &lt; c &lt; d, and the median is (9 + 9)/2 = 9, which is not allowed. Therefore, try 10 elements: [a, b, c, 9, 9, 9, 9, d, e, f] with a &lt; b &lt; c &lt; 9 &lt; d &lt; e &lt; f. The median is (9 + d)/2, which must not be an integer. So d must be 10 or higher. Try 12 elements: [a, b, c, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, d, e, f, g] with a &lt; b &lt; c &lt; 9 &lt; d &lt; e &lt; f &lt; g. The median is (9 + d)/2, which is not an integer. If d = 10, the median is 9.5, which works. So, assume a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, d = 10, e = 2, f = 2, g = 2, then 1 + 2 + 3 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 10 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 30. The list is [1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 9, 9, 9, 9, 10]. The sum of squares is: 1^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 + 10^2 = 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 9 + 81 + 81 + 81 + 81 + 100 = 446.

### thinking by Debate Agent Mi73:
To solve this problem, we need to construct a list of positive integers that meets all the given conditions. Let&#39;s break down each condition: 

1. The sum of the list is 30.
2. The unique mode of the list is 9. This means 9 appears more times than any other number in the list.
3. The median is a positive integer not in the list. This implies the list has an even number of elements, as an odd number would mean the median is in the list.

Let&#39;s start by assuming the list has 6 elements (an even number), which is a reasonable starting point since the sum is 30 and we need to have a median that is not in the list. 

If the list has 6 elements, the median would be the average of the 3rd and 4th elements. Since the median is not in the list, it suggests that the 3rd and 4th elements are different numbers.

To satisfy the mode condition, let&#39;s assume 9 appears at least 3 times (since it must be the unique mode). We can start with [9, 9, 9] and then add other numbers to make the sum 30.

If we have [9, 9, 9, a, b, c] where a, b, and c are other numbers, the sum is 27 + a + b + c = 30, so a + b + c = 3.

Since the median must be a positive integer not in the list, and we have 3 numbers to adjust, let&#39;s try to make a + b + c = 3 with distinct values for a, b, and c.

One possible combination is [9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 1]. This meets the sum condition, but the median would be 1, which is in the list, so this doesn&#39;t work.

Another combination to try is [9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 2]. The sum is still 30, and the median would be (1 + 2) / 2 = 1.5, which is not an integer. So, this doesn&#39;t work either.

Let&#39;s try [9, 9, 9, 1, 2, 0]. Here, the sum is 30, and the median is (1 + 2) / 2 = 1.5, which is not an integer either.

Finally, let&#39;s try [9, 9, 9, 1, 2, 0]. The sum is 30, and the median is (1 + 2) / 2 = 1.5, which again doesn&#39;t satisfy the conditions.

Let&#39;s adjust the approach: we need the sum of squares, so let&#39;s ensure the list meets all conditions. We try [9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 1]. The median is 5, which is not in the list, but the mode is not unique.

Let&#39;s add another 9 to ensure a unique mode: [9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 2]. The sum is 39, which doesn&#39;t fit.

Let&#39;s try [9, 9, 9, 2, 2, 2]. The median is 2, which is not in the list, and the sum is 33, which doesn&#39;t fit.

Finally, let&#39;s try [9, 9, 9, 1, 2, 0]. The sum is 30, and the median is 5, which is not in the list. This fits the conditions.

Now calculate the sum of squares: 9^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 + 1^2 + 2^2 + 0^2 = 81 + 81 + 81 + 1 + 4 + 0 = 248.
