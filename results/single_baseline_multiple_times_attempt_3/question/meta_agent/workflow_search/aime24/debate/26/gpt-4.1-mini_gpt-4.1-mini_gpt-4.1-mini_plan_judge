Question: Alice chooses a set $A$ of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets $B$ of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of $B$ belongs to $A$. Bob's list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: We are given a set A of positive integers. Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers such that the maximum element of B is in A. The total number of such sets B is 2024. For each a in A, the number of sets B with max(B) = a is the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., a} that contain a. This is equal to 2^(a-1). Since these sets are disjoint for different a, the total number of sets is the sum over a in A of 2^(a-1) = 2024. We express 2024 as a sum of powers of 2: 2024 = 2^10 + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^3. Therefore, the exponents (a-1) are {10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 3}, so A = {11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 4}. The sum of elements of A is 11 + 10 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 4 = 55.
