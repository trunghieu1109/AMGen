Question: Alice chooses a set $A$ of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets $B$ of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of $B$ belongs to $A$. Bob's list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To solve the problem, we need to find a set A such that the sum of 2^(a-1) for each a in A equals 2024. This is because for each element a in A, there are 2^(a-1) sets B with maximum element a. We express 2024 in binary: 2024 = 111111001000_2, which is 2^10 + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^3. This suggests that A should be {11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 4}, as each element a corresponds to a power of 2 in the binary representation of 2024. The sum of the elements of A is 11 + 10 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 4 = 49.
