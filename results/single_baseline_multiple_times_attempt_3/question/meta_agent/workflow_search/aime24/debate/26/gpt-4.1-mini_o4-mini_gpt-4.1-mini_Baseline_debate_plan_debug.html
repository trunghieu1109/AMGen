    <pre>Alice chooses a set $A$ of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets $B$ of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of $B$ belongs to $A$. Bob&#39;s list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A.

### thinking by Debate Agent BeI7:
We need to count all nonempty finite sets B of positive integers whose maximum lies in A. For a given m, the number of B with max(B)=m is 2^{m-1} (choose any subset of {1,…,m−1} and include m). Hence the total number of such sets is ∑_{m∈A}2^{m−1}, which equals 2024. Writing 2024 in binary yields 2024 = 2^{10}+2^9+2^8+2^7+2^6+2^5+2^3. Thus the exponents m−1 where 2^{m−1} appears are 10,9,8,7,6,5,3, giving m ∈ {11,10,9,8,7,6,4}. Therefore A={4,6,7,8,9,10,11} and its sum is 4+6+7+8+9+10+11=55.

### thinking by Debate Agent gcrH:
Let A = {a1 &lt; a2 &lt; … &lt; ak}. For each a in A, the number of nonempty finite sets B with max(B)=a is the number of subsets of {1,…,a−1}, namely 2^(a−1). Thus the total count is ∑_{a∈A} 2^(a−1)=2024. Write 2024 in binary: 2024_{10}=11111101000_2, so the 1–bits occur at positions 10,9,8,7,6,5,3 (counting from 0). Hence A = { (position)+1 } = {11,10,9,8,7,6,4}. Their sum is 11+10+9+8+7+6+4=55.

    <pre>We need to count all nonempty finite sets B of positive integers whose maximum element lies in A. For a given m, the number of such sets B with max(B)=m is the number of choices of the other elements from {1,…,m−1}, namely 2^{m−1}. Therefore the total number of sets Bob lists is S = ∑_{m∈A} 2^{m−1}, and we are given S = 2024. We express 2024 in binary to find which powers of 2 appear: 2024 = 1024 + 512 + 256 + 128 + 64 + 32 + 8 = 2^{10} + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^3. Hence the exponents m−1 are 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 3, so m ∈ {11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 4}. The sum of these elements is 11+10+9+8+7+6+4 = 55.
