Question: Alice chooses a set $A$ of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets $B$ of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of $B$ belongs to $A$. Bob's list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: We need to count all nonempty finite sets B of positive integers whose maximum element lies in A. For a given m, the number of such sets B with max(B)=m is the number of choices of the other elements from {1,…,m−1}, namely 2^{m−1}. Therefore the total number of sets Bob lists is S = ∑_{m∈A} 2^{m−1}, and we are given S = 2024. We express 2024 in binary to find which powers of 2 appear: 2024 = 1024 + 512 + 256 + 128 + 64 + 32 + 8 = 2^{10} + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^3. Hence the exponents m−1 are 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 3, so m ∈ {11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 4}. The sum of these elements is 11+10+9+8+7+6+4 = 55.
