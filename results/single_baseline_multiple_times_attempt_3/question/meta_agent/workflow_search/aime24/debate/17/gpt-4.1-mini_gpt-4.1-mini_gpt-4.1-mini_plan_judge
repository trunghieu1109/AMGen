Question: Find the number of triples of nonnegative integers \((a,b,c)\) satisfying \(a + b + c = 300\) and
\begin{equation*}
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.
\end{equation*}

proposed answer: The problem reduces to finding the number of nonnegative integer triples (a,b,c) with a + b + c = 300 satisfying 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000. By analyzing the equation, we find that all solutions are of the form (k, 100, 200 - k) for k = 0 to 200. For each k, the triple sums to 300 and satisfies the equation. We then count the number of ordered triples considering permutations. When k = 100, the triple is (100, 100, 100) with all equal elements, so only 1 permutation. For k â‰  100, the triple has three distinct elements, so 6 permutations each. There are 201 values of k (0 to 200 inclusive). Thus, total number of ordered triples is 1 (for k=100) + 200 * 6 = 1 + 1200 = 1201.
