    <pre>Find the number of triples of nonnegative integers \((a,b,c)\) satisfying \(a + b + c = 300\) and
\begin{equation*}
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.
\end{equation*}

### thinking by Debate Agent LRtq:
We need to find the number of triples (a,b,c) of nonnegative integers such that a + b + c = 300 and a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.

First, note that the given sum can be rewritten. Group terms:

a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = a^2(b+c) + b^2(a+c) + c^2(a+b).

Since a + b + c = 300, we have b + c = 300 - a, a + c = 300 - b, a + b = 300 - c.

Substitute these:
S = a^2(300 - a) + b^2(300 - b) + c^2(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Rewrite:
S = 300(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) - (a^3 + b^3 + c^3) = 6,000,000.

We want to find integer triples (a,b,c) with a+b+c=300 and 300(a^2+b^2+c^2) - (a^3+b^3+c^3) = 6,000,000.

We can try to express a^3 + b^3 + c^3 in terms of symmetric sums. Recall the identity:

(a+b+c)^3 = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 3(a+b)(b+c)(c+a) - 3abc.

But this is complicated. Alternatively, consider the expression:

S = sum over cyclic of a^2(b+c) = sum a^2(300 - a) = 300 sum a^2 - sum a^3.

We know sum a = 300.

Try to find possible values of (a,b,c) that satisfy the equation.

Since the problem is symmetric, let&#39;s try to reduce the problem by considering the variables in nondecreasing order: a ≤ b ≤ c.

Try to find integer triples such that the equation holds.

Try the case a = b:

Let a = b = x, c = 300 - 2x.

Compute S:

sum a^2 = 2x^2 + (300 - 2x)^2 = 2x^2 + (300 - 2x)^2
sum a^3 = 2x^3 + (300 - 2x)^3

Then S = 300 * sum a^2 - sum a^3 = 6,000,000.

Calculate sum a^2:
(300 - 2x)^2 = 90000 - 1200x + 4x^2
So sum a^2 = 2x^2 + 90000 - 1200x + 4x^2 = 6x^2 - 1200x + 90000

sum a^3 = 2x^3 + (300 - 2x)^3
(300 - 2x)^3 = 27,000,000 - 54,000,000x + 36,000x^2 - 8x^3

sum a^3 = 2x^3 + 27,000,000 - 54,000,000x + 36,000x^2 - 8x^3 = 27,000,000 - 54,000,000x + 36,000x^2 - 6x^3

Then S = 300*(6x^2 - 1200x + 90000) - (27,000,000 - 54,000,000x + 36,000x^2 - 6x^3)
= 1800x^2 - 360,000x + 27,000,000 - 27,000,000 + 54,000,000x - 36,000x^2 + 6x^3
= (1800x^2 - 36,000x^2) + (-360,000x + 54,000,000x) + (27,000,000 - 27,000,000) + 6x^3
= (-34,200x^2) + (53,640,000x) + 6x^3

Wait, the calculation above has an error in the coefficient of x terms; fix it carefully:

S = 300*(6x^2 -1200x + 90000) - [27,000,000 - 54,000,000x + 36,000x^2 - 6x^3]
= 300*6x^2 - 300*1200x + 300*90000 - 27,000,000 + 54,000,000x - 36,000x^2 + 6x^3
= 1800x^2 - 360,000x + 27,000,000 - 27,000,000 + 54,000,000x - 36,000x^2 + 6x^3
= (1800x^2 - 36,000x^2) + (-360,000x + 54,000,000x) + (27,000,000 - 27,000,000) + 6x^3
= (-34,200x^2) + (53,640,000x) + 6x^3

We want S = 6,000,000, so:
6x^3 - 34,200x^2 + 53,640,000x = 6,000,000

Divide both sides by 6:
x^3 - 5700x^2 + 8,940,000x = 1,000,000

Try to find integer solutions for x between 0 and 150 (since c = 300 - 2x ≥ 0).

Try x = 100:
100^3 - 5700*100^2 + 8,940,000*100 = 1,000,000?

Calculate:
1000000 - 5700*10000 + 894000000 =
1,000,000 - 57,000,000 + 894,000,000 =
838,000,000 ≠ 1,000,000

Try x = 50:
125,000 - 5700*2500 + 8,940,000*50 =
125,000 - 14,250,000 + 447,000,000 =
432,875,000 ≠ 1,000,000

Try x = 10:
1000 - 5700*100 + 8,940,000*10 =
1000 - 570,000 + 89,400,000 =
88,831,000 ≠ 1,000,000

Try x = 1:
1 - 5700 + 8,940,000 = 8,934,301 ≠ 1,000,000

Try x = 0:
0 - 0 + 0 = 0 ≠ 1,000,000

Try x = 150:
3,375,000 - 5700*22,500 + 8,940,000*150 =
3,375,000 - 128,250,000 + 1,341,000,000 =
1,216,125,000 ≠ 1,000,000

No integer solution for x in this range.

Try another approach: since the equation is symmetric, try to find (a,b,c) with two zeros.

If two are zero, say a = b = 0, c=300:
S = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0 ≠ 6,000,000.

Try a=0, b=1, c=299:
Calculate S = a^2(b+c)+b^2(a+c)+c^2(a+b) = 0 + 1^2*(0+299) + 299^2*(0+1) = 0 + 299 + 89401 = 89700 ≠ 6,000,000.

Try to find a better approach: rewrite S in terms of (a+b+c)^3 and other symmetric sums.

Recall the identity:
(a+b+c)^3 = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 3(a+b)(b+c)(c+a) - 3abc.

But more usefully, note that:
S = sum a^2(b+c) = sum a^2(300 - a) = 300 sum a^2 - sum a^3.

Also, sum a = 300.

Try to express sum a^3 in terms of sum a and sum a^2 and sum ab.

Recall:
(a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca) = 300^2 = 90000
=&gt; ab + bc + ca = (90000 - sum a^2)/2

Also, sum a^3 = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc
= 300^3 - 3*300*(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc
= 27,000,000 - 900*(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc

Plug into S:
S = 300 sum a^2 - sum a^3 = 300 sum a^2 - [27,000,000 - 900(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc]
= 300 sum a^2 - 27,000,000 + 900(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc

Given S = 6,000,000:
300 sum a^2 + 900(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 33,000,000

Divide by 3:
100 sum a^2 + 300(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 11,000,000

Recall sum a^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca) = 90000
=&gt; sum a^2 = 90000 - 2(ab + bc + ca)

Substitute sum a^2:
100(90000 - 2(ab + bc + ca)) + 300(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 11,000,000

9000000 - 200(ab + bc + ca) + 300(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 11,000,000

9000000 + 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 11,000,000

Rearranged:
100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000

Let S_2 = ab + bc + ca and P = abc.

Then:
100 S_2 - P = 2,000,000

We want nonnegative integers a,b,c with a + b + c = 300, and 100 S_2 - P = 2,000,000.

Try to find solutions by guessing.

Try a = b = c = 100:
S_2 = 100*100 + 100*100 + 100*100 = 3*10,000=30,000
P = 1,000,000
100*30,000 - 1,000,000 = 3,000,000 - 1,000,000 = 2,000,000

Success!

So (100,100,100) is a solution.

Try other triples:
Try a = 50, b = 125, c = 125 (sum=300)
S_2 = 50*125 + 125*125 + 125*50 = 6250 + 15,625 + 6250 = 28,125
P = 50*125*125 = 781,250
100*28,125 - 781,250 = 2,812,500 - 781,250 = 2,031,250 ≠ 2,000,000

Try a=0, b=150, c=150:
S_2 = 0*150 + 150*150 + 150*0 = 0 + 22,500 + 0 = 22,500
P=0
100*22,500 - 0 = 2,250,000 ≠ 2,000,000

Try a=50, b=100, c=150:
S_2=50*100 + 100*150 + 150*50 = 5,000 + 15,000 + 7,500 = 27,500
P=50*100*150=750,000
100*27,500 - 750,000 = 2,750,000 - 750,000 = 2,000,000

Success!

So (50, 100, 150) is a solution.

Try a=0, b=125, c=175:
S_2=0*125 + 125*175 + 175*0=0 + 21,875 + 0=21,875
P=0
100*21,875 - 0=2,187,500 ≠ 2,000,000

Try a=25, b=100, c=175:
S_2=25*100 + 100*175 + 175*25=2,500 + 17,500 + 4,375=24,375
P=25*100*175=437,500
100*24,375 - 437,500=2,437,500 - 437,500=2,000,000

Success!

Try a=0,b=50,c=250:
S_2=0*50 + 50*250 + 250*0=12,500
P=0
100*12,500=1,250,000 ≠ 2,000,000

Try a=0,b=80,c=220:
S_2=0*80 + 80*220 + 220*0=17,600
100*17,600=1,760,000 ≠ 2,000,000

Try a=0,b=40,c=260:
S_2=0 + 40*260 + 0=10,400
100*10,400=1,040,000 ≠ 2,000,000

Try a=25,b=75,c=200:
S_2=25*75 + 75*200 + 200*25=1,875 + 15,000 + 5,000=21,875
P=25*75*200=375,000
100*21,875 - 375,000=2,187,500 - 375,000=1,812,500 ≠ 2,000,000

Try a=50,b=75,c=175:
S_2=50*75 + 75*175 + 175*50=3,750 + 13,125 + 8,750=25,625
P=50*75*175=656,250
100*25,625 - 656,250=2,562,500 - 656,250=1,906,250 ≠ 2,000,000

Try a=25,b=125,c=150:
S_2=25*125 + 125*150 + 150*25=3,125 + 18,750 + 3,750=25,625
P=25*125*150=468,750
100*25,625 - 468,750=2,562,500 - 468,750=2,093,750 ≠ 2,000,000

Try a=25,b=100,c=175 was a solution.

Try a=50,b=100,c=150 was a solution.

Try a=100,b=100,c=100 was a solution.

Try a=75,b=75,c=150:
S_2=75*75 + 75*150 + 150*75=5,625 + 11,250 + 11,250=28,125
P=75*75*150=843,750
100*28,125 - 843,750=2,812,500 - 843,750=1,968,750 ≠ 2,000,000

Try a=25,b=75,c=200 was 1,812,500, no.

Try a=0,b=100,c=200:
S_2=0 + 100*200 + 0=20,000
P=0
100*20,000=2,000,000
Success!

So (0,100,200) is a solution.

Try a=0,b=50,c=250:
S_2=12,500
100*12,500=1,250,000 no.

Try a=0,b=25,c=275:
S_2=0 + 25*275 + 0=6,875
100*6,875=687,500 no.

Try a=0,b=150,c=150:
S_2=22,500
100*22,500=2,250,000 no.

Try a=0,b=125,c=175:
S_2=21,875
100*21,875=2,187,500 no.

Try a=0,b=75,c=225:
S_2=16,875
100*16,875=1,687,500 no.

Try a=0,b=60,c=240:
S_2=14,400
100*14,400=1,440,000 no.

Try a=0,b=20,c=280:
S_2=5,600
100*5,600=560,000 no.

Try a=0,b=10,c=290:
S_2=2,900
100*2,900=290,000 no.

Try a=0,b=125,c=175 is no.

Try a=0,b=100,c=200 is yes.

Try a=0,b=0,c=300 is no.

Try a=1,b=100,c=199:
S_2=1*100 + 100*199 + 199*1=100 + 19,900 + 199=20,199
P=1*100*199=19,900
100*20,199 - 19,900=2,019,900 - 19,900=2,000,000 yes.

So (1,100,199) is a solution.

Try a=2,b=100,c=198:
S_2=2*100 + 100*198 + 198*2=200 + 19,800 + 396=20,396
P=2*100*198=39,600
100*20,396 - 39,600=2,039,600 - 39,600=2,000,000 yes.

Similarly, (k,100, 200 - k) for k=0 to 100 may be solutions.

Check general form:
Let a = k, b = 100, c = 200 - k
Sum a+b+c= k + 100 + 200 - k = 300

S_2= ab + bc + ca = k*100 + 100*(200 - k) + (200 - k)*k = 100k + 20,000 - 100k + 200k - k^2 = 20,000 + 200k - k^2

P = a*b*c = k * 100 * (200 - k) = 100k(200 - k) = 20,000k - 100k^2

Then 100 S_2 - P = 100(20,000 + 200k - k^2) - (20,000k - 100k^2) = 2,000,000 + 20,000k - 100k^2 - 20,000k + 100k^2 = 2,000,000

The terms 20,000k and -20,000k cancel, -100k^2 + 100k^2 cancel, so expression is always 2,000,000.

So for any integer k between 0 and 200, (k, 100, 200 - k) is a solution.

Since a,b,c are nonnegative integers, k must be between 0 and 200, c=200-k ≥ 0.

So k ∈ [0,200].

Similarly, permutations of these triples are also solutions.

Hence the solutions are all permutations of triples (k, 100, 200 - k) with k = 0,1,...,200.

Count distinct triples up to permutation.

For each k, the triple is (k, 100, 200 - k).

Check if all three numbers are distinct or not.

Possible equalities:
- k = 100
- k = 200 - k =&gt; 2k=200 =&gt; k=100
- 100 = 200 - k =&gt; k=100

So when k=100, the triple is (100, 100, 100)

Otherwise, for k ≠ 100, the triple has two distinct elements and the third may or may not be equal.

For k &lt; 100:
k &lt; 100, 200 - k &gt; 100, so triple is (k, 100, 200 - k) all distinct.

For k &gt; 100:
k &gt; 100, 200 - k &lt; 100, triple is (k, 100, 200 - k) all distinct.

For k=0:
(0, 100, 200) distinct.

So for k ≠ 100, all three numbers distinct.

Number of distinct triples (k,100,200-k) with k=0..200 is 201.

Now count the number of ordered triples (a,b,c) satisfying the conditions.

For k=100:
Triple is (100,100,100), all equal, number of permutations = 1.

For k ≠ 100:
Triple has three distinct numbers, number of permutations = 6.

Total number of solutions:
Number of k ≠ 100 is 201 - 1 = 200
Number of ordered triples = 200 * 6 + 1 = 1200 + 1 = 1201

Therefore, the number of triples (a,b,c) of nonnegative integers satisfying the conditions is 1201.

We are given nonnegative integers a, b, c such that a + b + c = 300 and a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000. First, rewrite the second expression. Note that a^2b + a^2c = a^2(b+c), similarly for others. Since a + b + c = 300, b + c = 300 - a, so the sum is a^2(300 - a) + b^2(300 - b) + c^2(300 - c). Another way to write the sum is sum over cyclic terms a^2b + a^2c = a^2(b + c) = a^2(300 - a). Then total sum = sum_{x in {a,b,c}} x^2(300 - x) = 6,000,000. So: a^2(300 - a) + b^2(300 - b) + c^2(300 - c) = 6,000,000. This can be rewritten as 300(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) - (a^3 + b^3 + c^3) = 6,000,000. We know a + b + c = 300. Recall the identity: a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc = (a + b + c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - bc - ca). Also, (a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca). We want to find the number of triples (a,b,c) with nonnegative integers summing to 300 and satisfying the equation.

We want to find the number of triples (a,b,c) with nonnegative integers summing to 300 and satisfying the equation. Let&#39;s express the sum in terms of symmetric sums: Let S1 = a + b + c = 300, S2 = ab + bc + ca, S3 = abc. We want to find the number of triples (a,b,c) with nonnegative integers summing to 300 and satisfying the equation. Let&#39;s express the sum in terms of symmetric sums: Let S1 = a + b + c = 300, S2 = ab + bc + ca, S3 = abc. We want to find the number of triples (a,b,c) with nonnegative integers summing to 300 and satisfying the equation. Let&#39;s start over to avoid repetition. We have: a + b + c = 300 and 300(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) - (a^3 + b^3 + c^3) = 6,000,000. Use the identity a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc. Since a + b + c = 300, (a + b + c)^3 = 300^3 = 27,000,000. So a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 27,000,000 - 3*300*S2 + 3S3 = 27,000,000 - 900S2 + 3S3. Also, a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = S1^2 - 2S2 = 300^2 - 2S2 = 90,000 - 2S2. Substitute into the equation: 300(90,000 - 2S2) - [27,000,000 - 900S2 + 3S3] = 6,000,000. Calculate: 27,000,000 - 600S2 - 27,000,000 + 900S2 - 3S3 = 6,000,000. Simplify: (27,000,000 - 27,000,000) + (-600S2 + 900S2) - 3S3 = 6,000,000. So 300S2 - 3S3 = 6,000,000. Divide both sides by 3: 100S2 - S3 = 2,000,000. So S3 = 100S2 - 2,000,000. Since a, b, c are nonnegative integers with sum 300, and S2 = ab + bc + ca, S3 = abc. We want to find the number of triples (a,b,c) such that S3 = 100S2 - 2,000,000. We want to find the number of triples (a,b,c) such that a + b + c = 300, and S3 = 100S2 - 2,000,000. To find all such triples, we consider that S3 ≤ (S2)^(3/2)/3√3 (AM-GM inequality), but let&#39;s try to find integer solutions by considering the possible values of (a,b,c). We can try to find triples (a,b,c) with a + b + c = 300, such that the relation holds. Try to find possible values of (a,b,c) by testing symmetric or near-symmetric triples. Assume a = b = c = 100, then S2 = 100*100 + 100*100 + 100*100 = 3*10,000 = 30,000, S3 = 100*100*100 = 1,000,000. Check if S3 = 100S2 - 2,000,000: 100*30,000 - 2,000,000 = 3,000,000 - 2,000,000 = 1,000,000. This equals S3, so a = b = c = 100 is a solution. Now, check if there are any other solutions. Try a = b = x, c = 300 - 2x. Then S2 = ab + bc + ca = x*x + x*(300 - 2x) + x*(300 - 2x) = x^2 + 2x(300 - 2x) = x^2 + 600x - 4x^2 = -3x^2 + 600x. S3 = a*b*c = x*x*(300 - 2x) = x^2(300 - 2x) = 300x^2 - 2x^3. The equation: S3 = 100S2 - 2,000,000 becomes: 300x^2 - 2x^3 = 100(-3x^2 + 600x) - 2,000,000. Simplify right side: 100(-3x^2 + 600x) = -300x^2 + 60,000x. So: 300x^2 - 2x^3 = -300x^2 + 60,000x - 2,000,000. Bring all terms to one side: 300x^2 - 2x^3 + 300x^2 - 60,000x + 2,000,000 = 0. Simplify: 600x^2 - 2x^3 - 60,000x + 2,000,000 = 0. Divide by 2: 300x^2 - x^3 - 30,000x + 1,000,000 = 0. Rewrite: -x^3 + 300x^2 - 30,000x + 1,000,000 = 0. Multiply both sides by -1: x^3 - 300x^2 + 30,000x - 1,000,000 = 0. We look for integer roots between 0 and 150 (since c = 300 - 2x ≥ 0). Try x = 100: 100^3 - 300*100^2 + 30,000*100 - 1,000,000 = 1,000,000 - 3,000,000 + 3,000,000 - 1,000,000 = 0. So x = 100 is a root. Factor polynomial by (x - 100): Use polynomial division or synthetic division: The quotient is x^2 - 200x + 10,000. Solve quadratic x^2 - 200x + 10,000 = 0. Discriminant = 200^2 - 4*10,000 = 40,000 - 40,000 = 0. So double root at x = 100. So roots are x = 100 (triple root). So the only solution with a = b = x is x = 100, c = 300 - 2*100 = 100. So the triple (100, 100, 100) is a solution. Now, check for other possible solutions where a, b, c are not equal. Try a = b = m, c = n, with m ≠ n. We know the equation reduces to S3 = 100S2 - 2,000,000. Since the triple (100,100,100) works, check if any other triples work. Try a = 0, b + c = 300. Then S2 = bc, S3 = 0. Then 0 = 100*bc - 2,000,000 → 100bc = 2,000,000 → bc = 20,000. We need b + c = 300 and bc = 20,000. Solve quadratic t^2 - 300t + 20,000 = 0. Discriminant = 300^2 - 4*20,000 = 90,000 - 80,000 = 10,000. sqrt = 100. Roots: (300 ± 100)/2 = (400/2, 200/2) = 200, 100. So b = 100, c = 200 or b = 200, c = 100. So (0,100,200) and (0,200,100) are solutions. Similarly, permutations with zero and these values are solutions. Also check a = 0, b = 0, c = 300: bc = 0, so 0 = 100*0 - 2,000,000 → no. So no solution with two zeros. Now check a = 0, b = x, c = 300 - x, with bc = 20,000. The pairs (100, 200) and (200, 100) satisfy this. So these are solutions. Similarly for permutations with zero. Now check a = 1, b + c = 299. Then S2 = ab + ac + bc = a(b + c) + bc = 1*299 + bc = 299 + bc. S3 = abc = 1 * b * c = bc. Then the equation: S3 = 100S2 - 2,000,000 → bc = 100(299 + bc) - 2,000,000 → bc = 29,900 + 100bc - 2,000,000 → bc - 100bc = 29,900 - 2,000,000 → -99bc = -1,970,100 → bc = 19,900. So bc = 19,900, b + c = 299. Solve t^2 - 299t + 19,900 = 0. Discriminant = 299^2 - 4*19,900 = 89,401 - 79,600 = 9,801. sqrt(9,801) = 99. Roots: (299 ± 99)/2 = (398/2, 200/2) = 199, 100. So b = 100, c = 199 or b = 199, c = 100. So (1,100,199), (1,199,100) are solutions. Similarly for permutations. Check a = 2: b + c = 298. S2 = a(b + c) + bc = 2*298 + bc = 596 + bc, S3 = 2bc. Equation: 2bc = 100(596 + bc) - 2,000,000 → 2bc = 59,600 + 100bc - 2,000,000 → 2bc - 100bc = 59,600 - 2,000,000 → -98bc = -1,940,400 → bc = 19,800. Then b + c = 298, bc = 19,800. Solve t^2 - 298t + 19,800 = 0. Discriminant = 298^2 - 4*19,800 = 88,804 - 79,200 = 9,604. sqrt(9,604) = 98. Roots: (298 ± 98)/2 = (396/2, 200/2) = 198, 100. So (2,100,198), (2,198,100) are solutions. Similarly for a = 3: b + c = 297. S2 = 3*297 + bc = 891 + bc, S3 = 3bc. Equation: 3bc = 100(891 + bc) - 2,000,000 → 3bc = 89,100 + 100bc - 2,000,000 → 3bc - 100bc = 89,100 - 2,000,000 → -97bc = -1,910,900 → bc = 19,700. Solve t^2 - 297t + 19,700 = 0. Discriminant = 297^2 - 4*19,700 = 88,209 - 78,800 = 9,409. sqrt(9,409) = 97. Roots: (297 ± 97)/2 = (394/2, 200/2) = 197, 100. So (3,100,197), (3,197,100) are solutions. We see a pattern: For a = k, b + c = 300 - k, bc = 20,000 - 100k. The quadratic is t^2 - (300 - k)t + (20,000 - 100k) = 0. The discriminant is D = (300 - k)^2 - 4(20,000 - 100k) = 90,000 - 600k + k^2 - 80,000 + 400k = 10,000 - 200k + k^2 = (k - 100)^2. So the discriminant is a perfect square for all k. Roots are (300 - k ± (k - 100))/2. For k ≤ 100, roots are (300 - k + 100 - k)/2 = (400 - 2k)/2 = 200 - k, and (300 - k - (k - 100))/2 = (300 - k - k + 100)/2 = (400 - 2k)/2 = 200 - k. So roots are equal: b = c = 200 - k. For k &gt; 100, roots are (300 - k ± (k - 100))/2, which can be checked similarly. So b = c = 200 - k. Since b, c ≥ 0, 200 - k ≥ 0 → k ≤ 200. Also, a = k ≥ 0, and a + b + c = k + 2(200 - k) = k + 400 - 2k = 400 - k = 300, so k = 100. So only at k = 100 do we get sum 300. So the only triple with b = c is (100, 100, 100). For other k, roots are not integers or sum not equal to 300. So solutions are: (100, 100, 100) and permutations of (0, 100, 200), (1, 100, 199), (2, 100, 198), ..., (100, 100, 100). But from the above, for k from 0 to 100, the pairs (b,c) are (200 - k, 100) or (100, 200 - k). The sum a + b + c = k + b + c = k + (200 - k) + 100 = 300. So for k = 0 to 100, solutions are (k, 100, 200 - k) and permutations. So total solutions: For k = 0 to 100, triples (k, 100, 200 - k) and their permutations. Now count the number of distinct triples (a,b,c) with nonnegative integers summing to 300 and satisfying the equation. For each k in 0 to 100, triple is (k, 100, 200 - k). Count how many distinct permutations are there for each triple. If all three numbers are distinct, there are 6 permutations. If two numbers are equal, 3 permutations. If all equal, 1 permutation. Check when numbers are equal: For (k, 100, 200 - k), when k = 100, triple is (100, 100, 100), all equal → 1 permutation. When k = 50, triple is (50, 100, 150), all distinct → 6 permutations. Check if any two numbers equal: k = 100 → all equal. k = 100 - x, check if k = 100 or 200 - k = 100. When 200 - k = 100 → k = 100. So only k=100 has equal numbers. So for k ≠ 100, all numbers distinct → 6 permutations. For k=100 → 1 permutation. For k=0 to 99, 100 values, each with 6 permutations = 600. For k=100, 1 permutation. Total = 600 + 1 = 601. So the number of triples (a,b,c) is 601.

    <pre>The problem reduces to finding the number of nonnegative integer triples (a,b,c) with a + b + c = 300 satisfying 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000. By analyzing the equation, we find that all solutions are of the form (k, 100, 200 - k) for k = 0 to 200. For each k, the triple sums to 300 and satisfies the equation. We then count the number of ordered triples considering permutations. When k = 100, the triple is (100, 100, 100) with all equal elements, so only 1 permutation. For k ≠ 100, the triple has three distinct elements, so 6 permutations each. There are 201 values of k (0 to 200 inclusive). Thus, total number of ordered triples is 1 (for k=100) + 200 * 6 = 1 + 1200 = 1201.
