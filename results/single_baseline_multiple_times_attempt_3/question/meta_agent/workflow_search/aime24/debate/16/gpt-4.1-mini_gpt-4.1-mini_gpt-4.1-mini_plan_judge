Question: Let $\triangle ABC$ have circumcenter $O$ and incenter $I$ with $\overline{IA}\perp\overline{OI}$, circumradius $13$, and inradius $6$. Find $AB\cdot AC$.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: Given triangle ABC with circumcenter O and incenter I, we know the circumradius R = 13 and inradius r = 6. The condition IA ⟂ OI implies a geometric relationship between these points. Using the Euler formula for the distance between the incenter and circumcenter, we have OI^2 = R(R - 2r) = 13(13 - 12) = 13. Placing O at the origin and A on the circle of radius 13, the perpendicularity condition leads to the equation x_I cos θ + y_I sin θ = 1, where (x_I, y_I) are coordinates of I. Using trigonometric identities and known formulas for the product of sides adjacent to angle A, and the relation between cosines of angles and inradius/circumradius, we find that AB * AC = 156. This matches the result obtained by both vector and trigonometric approaches, confirming the answer.
