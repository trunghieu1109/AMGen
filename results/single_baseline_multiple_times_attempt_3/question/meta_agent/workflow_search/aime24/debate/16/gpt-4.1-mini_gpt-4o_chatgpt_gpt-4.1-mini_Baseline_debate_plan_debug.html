    <pre>Let $\triangle ABC$ have circumcenter $O$ and incenter $I$ with $\overline{IA}\perp\overline{OI}$, circumradius $13$, and inradius $6$. Find $AB\cdot AC$.

### thinking by Debate Agent beZi:
We are given a triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with circumcenter \( O \) and incenter \( I \), where \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \). The circumradius \( R = 13 \) and the inradius \( r = 6 \). We need to find \( AB \cdot AC \).

The condition \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \) implies that \( A \) is the excenter of \( \triangle OI \). This is a known configuration where \( OI^2 = R^2 - 2Rr \). Calculating gives:

\[ OI^2 = 13^2 - 2 \times 13 \times 6 = 169 - 156 = 13. \]

Thus, \( OI = \sqrt{13} \).

We also know the identity \( OI^2 = R^2 - 2Rr = R^2 - 2R \cdot r \). We already calculated \( OI^2 = 13 \).

In a triangle, the relation \( OI^2 = R^2 - 2Rr \) holds. We have \( OI^2 = 13 \) and \( R = 13 \), \( r = 6 \). Therefore, the product \( AB \cdot AC \) can be found using the relation for \( R \) and \( r \):

The identity \( AB \cdot AC = c^2 + r^2 - 4Rr \) can be used, where \( c = BC \). Substituting known values into the expression for \( AB \cdot AC \) using the relation \( OI^2 = R^2 - 2Rr \), we get:

\[ AB \cdot AC = c^2 + 6^2 - 4 \times 13 \times 6. \]

However, this is incorrect without knowing \( c \). Instead, we use the identity \( ab = 4Rr \sin A \) for \( \triangle ABC \) directly, which simplifies to:

\[ AB \cdot AC = 4Rr \sin A. \]

Given that \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), which implies \( \sin A = 1 \), we have:

\[ AB \cdot AC = 4 \times 13 \times 6 = 312. \]

Thus, \( AB \cdot AC = 312. \)

### thinking by Debate Agent ZhVn:
We are given that the inradius (r) is 6 and the circumradius (R) is 13. We also know that IA is perpendicular to OI, which implies a special relationship between the incenter and circumcenter. In a triangle, the relation between the circumradius R, inradius r, and the distance between the incenter and circumcenter d is given by Euler&#39;s formula: d^2 = R^2 - 2Rr. We can use this to find the distance d. Then we can use the fact that IA is perpendicular to OI to find the product AB * AC.
