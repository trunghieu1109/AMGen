We also know that IA is perpendicular to OI, which implies a special relationship between the incenter and circumcenter. In a triangle, the relation between the circumradius R, inradius r, and the distance between the incenter and circumcenter d is given by Euler's formula: d^2 = R^2 - 2Rr. We can use this to find the distance d. Then we can use the fact that IA is perpendicular to OI to find the product AB * AC.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent beZi:\n312\n\n### answer by Debate Agent ZhVn:\n168\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
