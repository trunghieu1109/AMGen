    <pre>Let $p$ be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $n^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$. Find the least positive integer $m$ such that $m^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$.

### thinking by Debate Agent fGwi:
We seek the smallest prime p for which n^4+1≡0 mod p^2 has a solution with p∤n. Mod p this gives n^4≡−1, so −1 is a 4th power ⇒4|p−1 and also ord(n)=8 ⇒8|p−1 ⇒p≡1 mod 8. The smallest such prime is p=17. We then solve n^4+1≡0 mod 17^2(=289) by lifting the four roots mod 17 (n≡±2,±8) via Hensel’s lemma. The unique lifts in [1,288] are n=155,151,42,264. The least positive is 42.

### thinking by Debate Agent XfKK:
We seek the least prime p for which ∃n&gt;0 with p^2∣n^4+1. Test small primes: for p=2,5,13 no solution mod p^2. For p=17 we find n^4≡–1 mod 17 has solutions n≡2,8,9,15 mod 17. By Hensel lifting each to mod 17^2=289 we get four m values: 2+17·9=155, 8+17·6=110, 9+17·10=179, 15+17·7=134. The least positive is 110, and indeed 110^4+1≡0 mod 289. Hence p=17 and the minimal m is 110.

### answer by Debate Agent fGwi:
42

### answer by Debate Agent XfKK:
110
