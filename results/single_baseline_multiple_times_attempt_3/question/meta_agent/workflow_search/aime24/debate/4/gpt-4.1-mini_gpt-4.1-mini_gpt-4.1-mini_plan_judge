proposed answer: We are asked to find the least prime p such that there exists a positive integer n with p^2 dividing n^4 + 1, and then find the least positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2. From number theory, if p divides n^4 + 1, then n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p), so the order of n modulo p is 8, implying p ≡ 1 (mod 8). The smallest primes congruent to 1 mod 8 are 17, 41, 73, 89, 97, etc. Checking p=17 and p=41 shows no n such that p^2 divides n^4 + 1. For p=97, there exists n=50 such that 97 divides 50^4 + 1, and by Hensel's lemma, this solution can be lifted to modulo 97^2 = 9409. The lifted solution is n = 50 + 97 * 350 = 34000, which satisfies n^4 + 1 ≡ 0 mod 9409. Therefore, the least prime p is 97, and the least positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 97^2 is 34000.
