proposed answer: To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest prime number p such that there exists a positive integer n for which n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2. This means n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p^2). We start by considering small prime numbers. For p = 2, n^4 + 1 cannot be divisible by 4 because n^4 is always 0 or 1 mod 4. For p = 3, n^4 + 1 cannot be divisible by 9 because n^4 is 0, 1, 4, or 7 mod 9. For p = 5, n^4 + 1 cannot be divisible by 25 because n^4 is 0, 1, 6, 16, or 21 mod 25. For p = 7, n^4 + 1 cannot be divisible by 49 because n^4 is 0, 1, 16, 24, 29, 32, 36, or 48 mod 49. For p = 13, n^4 + 1 can be divisible by 169 because n = 5 gives n^4 = 625 ≡ 168 ≡ -1 (mod 169). Therefore, p = 13 is the smallest prime. Now, we need to find the smallest m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 169. Since n = 5 works, m = 5 is the smallest such integer.
