Question: Let $p$ be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $n^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$. Find the least positive integer $m$ such that $m^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: We seek the least prime p such that n^4+1≡0 mod p^2 has a solution. Mod p this requires n^4≡−1, forcing p≡1 mod 8; the smallest is p=17. We then lift the four roots n≡2,8,9,15 (mod 17) via Hensel’s lemma to mod 17^2=289, yielding m=155,110,179,134. The least positive is 110.
