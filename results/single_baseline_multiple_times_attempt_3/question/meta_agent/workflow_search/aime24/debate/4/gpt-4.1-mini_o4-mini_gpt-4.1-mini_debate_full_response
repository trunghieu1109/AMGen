Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Final Decision Agent DNP7', content='We seek the least prime p such that n^4+1≡0 mod p^2 has a solution. Mod p this requires n^4≡−1, forcing p≡1 mod\u20098; the smallest is p=17. We then lift the four roots n≡2,8,9,15 (mod\u200917) via Hensel’s lemma to mod\u200917^2=289, yielding m=155,110,179,134.

Mod p this gives n^4≡−1, so −1 is a 4th power ⇒4|p−1 and also ord(n)=8 ⇒8|p−1 ⇒p≡1 mod 8. The smallest such prime is p=17. We then solve n^4+1≡0 mod 17^2(=289) by lifting the four roots mod 17 (n≡±2,±8) via Hensel’s lemma. The unique lifts in [1,288] are n=155,151,42,264. The least positive is 42.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent XfKK:\nWe seek the least prime p for which ∃n>0 with p^2∣n^4+1. Test small primes: for p=2,5,13 no solution mod\u2009p^2. For p=17 we find n^4≡–1 mod\u200917 has solutions n≡2,8,9,15 mod\u200917. By Hensel lifting each to mod\u200917^2=289 we get four m values: 2+17·9=155, 8+17·6=110, 9+17·10=179, 15+17·7=134. The least positive is 110, and indeed 110^4+1≡0 mod\u2009289. Hence p=17 and the minimal m is 110.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent fGwi:\n42\n\n### answer by Debate Agent XfKK:\n110\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
