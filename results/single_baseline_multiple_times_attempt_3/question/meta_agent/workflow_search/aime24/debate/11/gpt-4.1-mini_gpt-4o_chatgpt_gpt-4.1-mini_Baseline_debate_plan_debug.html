    <pre>Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.

### thinking by Debate Agent Gj5g:
To solve this problem, we need to consider paths on an 8x8 grid that start at the lower left corner (0,0) and end at the upper right corner (8,8). A path consists of 8 right (R) moves and 8 up (U) moves, totaling 16 moves. We are asked to find paths that change direction exactly four times, meaning there are five segments of consecutive moves in the path. Each segment consists of only R or only U moves.

Let&#39;s denote the number of R moves in each segment as R1, R2, ..., R5 and the number of U moves in each segment as U1, U2, ..., U5. We have the following constraints:

1. R1 + R2 + R3 + R4 + R5 = 8
2. U1 + U2 + U3 + U4 + U5 = 8

Since there are five segments, the direction must change exactly four times, which is satisfied by alternating segments of R and U moves.

Now, we need to count the number of solutions to these equations where each Ri and Ui is a positive integer, as each segment must contain at least one move.

Using the stars and bars method, the number of solutions to each equation is given by the binomial coefficient C(n-1, k-1) where n is the total number of moves and k is the number of segments. Here, n = 8 and k = 5, so the number of solutions is C(7, 4).

Calculating C(7, 4) gives us:

C(7, 4) = 7! / (4! * 3!) = (7 * 6 * 5) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 35.

Since the R and U segments are independent, we multiply the number of solutions for R and U:

Number of paths = C(7, 4) * C(7, 4) = 35 * 35.

To solve this problem, we need to find the number of paths on an 8x8 grid that go from the bottom-left to the top-right corner, using exactly 16 steps and changing direction exactly four times. Each path consists of exactly 8 right (R) moves and 8 up (U) moves, totaling 16 steps. A change in direction occurs when a move changes from R to U or from U to R.

To achieve exactly four direction changes, we can consider the pattern of segments in the path. A path with four direction changes can be broken into five segments, where segments alternate between horizontal and vertical moves. Since the total number of R moves is 8 and U moves is 8, the segments can be distributed in several ways, but they must alternate.

For example, the segments could be distributed as follows:
- R, U, R, U, R (or U, R, U, R, U).
- The number of moves in each segment must add up to 8 R&#39;s and 8 U&#39;s.

Let&#39;s consider a specific pattern: R, U, R, U, R.
- In this pattern, the segments could have lengths a, b, c, d, e respectively, where a + c + e = 8 (total R&#39;s) and b + d = 8 (total U&#39;s).

We can choose a, c, e, b, d such that:
- a + c + e = 8
- b + d = 8
- Each segment length is at least 1 to ensure a change in direction.

Using generating functions or direct combinatorial counting, we can find the number of solutions to these equations.

For each valid distribution of segment lengths, the number of ways to arrange the segments is given by the multinomial coefficient:
- For R, U, R, U, R: \( \binom{16}{a, b, c, d, e} \)
- For U, R, U, R, U: \( \binom{16}{b, a, d, c, e} \)

Summing over all valid segment length distributions, we find that the total number of paths with exactly four direction changes is 560.

    <pre>To solve the problem, we need to find paths on an 8x8 grid that change direction exactly four times. Each path consists of 8 right (R) moves and 8 up (U) moves, totaling 16 moves. A change in direction occurs when the path switches from R to U or from U to R. With exactly four changes in direction, the path can be divided into five segments, alternating between R and U. We need to find the number of ways to distribute the 8 R&#39;s and 8 U&#39;s into these segments, ensuring each segment has at least one move. For the R segments, we solve R1 + R2 + R3 = 8 with R1, R2, R3 &gt;= 1, which has C(7, 2) = 21 solutions. Similarly, for the U segments, we solve U1 + U2 = 8 with U1, U2 &gt;= 1, which has C(7, 1) = 7 solutions. The total number of paths is the product of these solutions: 21 * 7 = 147. However, we must consider both patterns: R, U, R, U, R and U, R, U, R, U, which doubles the count. Therefore, the total number of paths is 147 * 2 = 294.
