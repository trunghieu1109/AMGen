Question: Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.
[asy] size(10cm); usepackage("tikz");label("\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(2,0)--(2,3)--(5,3)--(5,8)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}",origin); label("\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(0,3)--(3,3)--(3,5)--(8,5)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}",E); [/asy]

proposed answer: We need paths from (0,0) to (8,8) with 8 east and 8 north steps (16 steps) that change direction exactly 4 times. A change of direction occurs at each boundary between runs of identical steps, so exactly 4 changes means exactly 5 runs. There are two patterns of runs (starting with E or starting with N), each of length 5. 

Case 1: Start with E: runs are E–N–E–N–E (3 E-runs, 2 N-runs). The number of ways to choose positive lengths summing to 8 is C(8−1,3−1)=C(7,2)=21 for the E-runs and C(8−1,2−1)=C(7,1)=7 for the N-runs, giving 21×7=147.
Case 2: Start with N: similarly 3 N-runs and 2 E-runs give another 21×7=147.

Total = 147 + 147 = 294.
