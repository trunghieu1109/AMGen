    <pre>Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.
[asy] size(10cm); usepackage(&#34;tikz&#34;);label(&#34;\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(2,0)--(2,3)--(5,3)--(5,8)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}&#34;,origin); label(&#34;\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(0,3)--(3,3)--(3,5)--(8,5)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}&#34;,E); [/asy]

### thinking by Debate Agent AV9T:
We are looking at paths from the lower-left corner to the upper-right corner on an 8x8 grid. Each path consists of 16 steps: 8 steps right (R) and 8 steps up (U). The total number of such paths without restriction is \( \binom{16}{8} \). The problem asks for the number of paths with exactly 4 direction changes. A direction change occurs when the path switches from moving right to moving up, or vice versa.

Let&#39;s analyze the problem step-by-step:

1. The path is composed of exactly 16 steps: 8 R and 8 U.
2. The path changes direction exactly 4 times, meaning the path consists of 5 segments (because the number of segments is one more than the number of direction changes).
3. Each segment consists of steps all in the same direction (either all R or all U).
4. The path starts at the lower-left corner and ends at the upper-right corner, so the first segment can be either R or U.
5. The direction segments alternate between R and U.

Let’s denote the number of segments as 5, and the number of direction changes as 4.

We have two cases depending on the first move:

- Case 1: The path starts with R. Then the segments alternate as R, U, R, U, R (3 R segments and 2 U segments).
- Case 2: The path starts with U. Then the segments alternate as U, R, U, R, U (3 U segments and 2 R segments).

Since the total number of R steps is 8 and total U steps is 8, in Case 1:
- Sum of lengths of 3 R segments = 8
- Sum of lengths of 2 U segments = 8

In Case 2:
- Sum of lengths of 3 U segments = 8
- Sum of lengths of 2 R segments = 8

Each segment must have at least 1 step (since changing direction implies a segment length of at least 1).

We want to count the number of integer solutions to these equations:

For Case 1:
- R segments: r1 + r2 + r3 = 8, with each r_i &gt;= 1
- U segments: u1 + u2 = 8, with each u_i &gt;= 1

Number of positive integer solutions:
- For R: \( \binom{8-1}{3-1} = \binom{7}{2} = 21 \)
- For U: \( \binom{8-1}{2-1} = \binom{7}{1} = 7 \)

Total for Case 1 = 21 * 7 = 147

For Case 2:
- U segments: u1 + u2 + u3 = 8, each &gt;= 1
- R segments: r1 + r2 = 8, each &gt;= 1

Number of positive integer solutions:
- For U: \( \binom{8-1}{3-1} = \binom{7}{2} = 21 \)
- For R: \( \binom{8-1}{2-1} = \binom{7}{1} = 7 \)

Total for Case 2 = 21 * 7 = 147

Adding both cases: 147 + 147 = 294

Therefore, the number of paths with exactly 4 direction changes is 294.

We are considering paths from the lower-left corner to the upper-right corner on an 8x8 grid. Each path consists of 16 steps: 8 steps right (R) and 8 steps up (U). The total number of such paths without any restriction is \( \binom{16}{8} \). We need to count the number of paths that change direction exactly 4 times. A change of direction means switching from moving right to moving up or from moving up to moving right. Since the path consists of 16 steps, and the number of direction changes is 4, the path can be broken into 5 segments (because the number of segments is one more than the number of changes). Each segment is a sequence of steps all in the same direction (either all R or all U). Since the path starts at the lower-left corner, the first segment can be either right or up. We need to consider both cases separately and then sum the results: Case 1: The path starts with right (R). Then the segments alternate R, U, R, U, R (5 segments, 3 R segments and 2 U segments). Case 2: The path starts with up (U). Then the segments alternate U, R, U, R, U (5 segments, 3 U segments and 2 R segments). For each case, we need to find the number of ways to distribute the 8 steps of each direction into the respective number of segments, with each segment having at least 1 step (since a segment with zero steps would not count as a segment). For Case 1: 3 R segments summing to 8 steps, each ≥ 1; 2 U segments summing to 8 steps, each ≥ 1. The number of positive integer solutions to \( x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 8 \) is \( \binom{8-1}{3-1} = \binom{7}{2} = 21 \). Similarly, for the 2 U segments: \( \binom{8-1}{2-1} = \binom{7}{1} = 7 \). So total for Case 1 is \( 21 \times 7 = 147 \). For Case 2: 3 U segments summing to 8 steps, each ≥ 1; 2 R segments summing to 8 steps, each ≥ 1. Using the same reasoning: 3 segments: 21 ways; 2 segments: 7 ways. Total for Case 2 is also 147. Adding both cases: 147 + 147 = 294. Therefore, the number of paths that change direction exactly 4 times is 294.

    <pre>The problem asks for the number of paths from the lower-left corner to the upper-right corner on an 8x8 grid that change direction exactly 4 times. Each path consists of 16 steps: 8 right (R) and 8 up (U). A direction change means switching from R to U or U to R. With exactly 4 direction changes, the path is divided into 5 segments alternating between R and U. The path can start with either R or U. If it starts with R, the segments are R, U, R, U, R (3 R segments and 2 U segments). If it starts with U, the segments are U, R, U, R, U (3 U segments and 2 R segments). Each segment must have at least one step. We count the number of positive integer solutions to the sums of segment lengths equaling 8 for each direction. For 3 segments summing to 8, the number of positive solutions is C(7,2) = 21. For 2 segments summing to 8, the number of positive solutions is C(7,1) = 7. For each starting direction case, the total number of ways is 21 * 7 = 147. Summing both cases gives 147 + 147 = 294. Therefore, the number of such paths is 294.
