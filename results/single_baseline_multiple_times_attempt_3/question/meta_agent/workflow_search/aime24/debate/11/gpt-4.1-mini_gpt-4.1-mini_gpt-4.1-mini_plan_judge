Question: Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.

proposed answer: The problem asks for the number of paths from the lower-left corner to the upper-right corner on an 8x8 grid that change direction exactly 4 times. Each path consists of 16 steps: 8 right (R) and 8 up (U). A direction change means switching from R to U or U to R. With exactly 4 direction changes, the path is divided into 5 segments alternating between R and U. The path can start with either R or U. If it starts with R, the segments are R, U, R, U, R (3 R segments and 2 U segments). If it starts with U, the segments are U, R, U, R, U (3 U segments and 2 R segments). Each segment must have at least one step. We count the number of positive integer solutions to the sums of segment lengths equaling 8 for each direction. For 3 segments summing to 8, the number of positive solutions is C(7,2) = 21. For 2 segments summing to 8, the number of positive solutions is C(7,1) = 7. For each starting direction case, the total number of ways is 21 * 7 = 147. Summing both cases gives 147 + 147 = 294. Therefore, the number of such paths is 294.
