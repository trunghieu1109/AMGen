Question: Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.

proposed answer: To solve the problem, we need to find paths on an 8x8 grid that change direction exactly four times. Each path consists of 8 right (R) moves and 8 up (U) moves, totaling 16 moves. A change in direction occurs when the path switches from R to U or from U to R. With exactly four changes in direction, the path can be divided into five segments, alternating between R and U. We need to find the number of ways to distribute the 8 R's and 8 U's into these segments, ensuring each segment has at least one move. For the R segments, we solve R1 + R2 + R3 = 8 with R1, R2, R3 >= 1, which has C(7, 2) = 21 solutions. Similarly, for the U segments, we solve U1 + U2 = 8 with U1, U2 >= 1, which has C(7, 1) = 7 solutions. The total number of paths is the product of these solutions: 21 * 7 = 147. However, we must consider both patterns: R, U, R, U, R and U, R, U, R, U, which doubles the count. Therefore, the total number of paths is 147 * 2 = 294.
