    <pre>Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.
[asy] size(10cm); usepackage(&#34;tikz&#34;);label(&#34;\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(2,0)--(2,3)--(5,3)--(5,8)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}&#34;,origin); label(&#34;\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(0,3)--(3,3)--(3,5)--(8,5)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}&#34;,E); [/asy]

### thinking by Debate Agent XYY5:
We want paths from (0,0) to (8,8) with 8 East (E) and 8 North (N) steps, total 16 steps, that change direction exactly 4 times. Each change of direction corresponds to a boundary between runs of consecutive identical steps. Thus exactly 5 runs (segments) of E’s or N’s, alternating in direction. There are two possibilities: the path starts with E or with N.

Case 1: Starts with E. Then runs 1,3,5 are E-runs whose lengths (a1,a3,a5) are positive integers summing to 8, and runs 2,4 are N-runs whose lengths (a2,a4) are positive summing to 8. The number of positive solutions to a1+a3+a5=8 is C(8-1,3-1)=C(7,2)=21, and to a2+a4=8 is C(8-1,2-1)=C(7,1)=7. So 21·7=147 sequences.
Case 2: Starts with N. Similarly, runs 1,3,5 are N-runs summing to 8 (21 ways) and runs 2,4 are E-runs summing to 8 (7 ways), giving another 147 sequences.

Total paths = 147+147 = 294.

### thinking by Debate Agent 70UB:
To go from (0,0) to (8,8) on the grid you need 8 east steps (E) and 8 north steps (N), for a total of 16 steps. A change in direction occurs whenever you switch from E to N or N to E. Having exactly 4 changes means the path consists of 5 runs (blocks) of consecutive steps in the same direction.

Case 1: Path starts with E. Then the run pattern is E–N–E–N–E, giving 3 E-runs and 2 N-runs. Positive integer compositions:
- 3 E-runs summing to 8 steps: C(8−1, 3−1)=C(7,2)=21.
- 2 N-runs summing to 8 steps: C(8−1, 2−1)=C(7,1)=7.
Total for this case: 21×7=147.

Case 2: Path starts with N. Then the pattern is N–E–N–E–N, giving 3 N-runs and 2 E-runs. Similarly:
- 3 N-runs summing to 8: C(7,2)=21.
- 2 E-runs summing to 8: C(7,1)=7.
Total: 21×7=147.

Summing both cases: 147+147=294.

    <pre>We need paths from (0,0) to (8,8) with 8 east and 8 north steps (16 steps) that change direction exactly 4 times. A change of direction occurs at each boundary between runs of identical steps, so exactly 4 changes means exactly 5 runs. There are two patterns of runs (starting with E or starting with N), each of length 5. 

Case 1: Start with E: runs are E–N–E–N–E (3 E-runs, 2 N-runs). The number of ways to choose positive lengths summing to 8 is C(8−1,3−1)=C(7,2)=21 for the E-runs and C(8−1,2−1)=C(7,1)=7 for the N-runs, giving 21×7=147.
Case 2: Start with N: similarly 3 N-runs and 2 E-runs give another 21×7=147.

Total = 147 + 147 = 294.
