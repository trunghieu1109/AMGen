    <pre>There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\times5$ grid such that: 

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.

### thinking by Debate Agent dxbb:
We need maximal patterns on a 5×5 grid where at most one chip per cell, rows and columns are monochromatic, and no further chip can be added.  Label rows by colors r(i)∈{W,B} and columns by c(j).  A cell (i,j) holds a chip iff r(i)=c(j), colored accordingly.  Maximality requires every row i has some j with c(j)=r(i), and every column j has some i with r(i)=c(j).  Equivalently the set of colors used by r and by c must coincide: either both use only W or only B (giving the all‐white or all‐black full grid), or both use both colors.  There are 2 choices for the single‐color case, and (2^5−2)^2=30^2=900 choices for r and c each using both colors.  Total = 900+2 = 902.

### thinking by Debate Agent nVlv:
We need maximal placements: no empty cell is fillable. An empty cell at row i and column j is unfillable exactly if both row i and column j are nonempty and their assigned colors differ (so any color you add violates uniformity). To make every empty cell unfillable, every row and every column must have at least one chip (otherwise an empty row or column would allow a placement). Assign each of the 5 rows and 5 columns independently a color (white or black): 2^5·2^5=1024 choices. Then fill exactly those cells where row and column colors agree (placing the common color); leave cells where they differ empty. One checks these are all maximal and use at most 25 chips of each color. Hence the total is 1024.

### answer by Debate Agent dxbb:
902

### answer by Debate Agent nVlv:
1024

Given all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer. Put your thinking process in the &#39;thinking&#39; field and the final answer in the &#39;answer&#39; field.</pre>

    <pre>We model each maximal placement by assigning to each nonempty row i a colour r_i∈{W,B} and to each nonempty column j a colour c_j, and then placing exactly those chips at (i,j) with r_i=c_j. Maximality forces every row and every column to be nonempty, and hence the sets of colours used by r and c must coincide and be nonempty. The common support S⊆{W,B} can be {W}, {B} or {W,B}. If |S|=1 there is exactly 1 choice for r and 1 for c; if S={W,B} there are 2^5−2=30 choices for each of r and c. Thus total =2·1·1+1·30·30=2+900=902.
