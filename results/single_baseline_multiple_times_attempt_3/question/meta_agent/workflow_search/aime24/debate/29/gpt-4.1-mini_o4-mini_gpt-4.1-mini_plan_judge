Question: There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\times5$ grid such that: 

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: We model each maximal placement by assigning to each nonempty row i a colour r_i∈{W,B} and to each nonempty column j a colour c_j, and then placing exactly those chips at (i,j) with r_i=c_j. Maximality forces every row and every column to be nonempty, and hence the sets of colours used by r and c must coincide and be nonempty. The common support S⊆{W,B} can be {W}, {B} or {W,B}. If |S|=1 there is exactly 1 choice for r and 1 for c; if S={W,B} there are 2^5−2=30 choices for each of r and c. Thus total =2·1·1+1·30·30=2+900=902.
