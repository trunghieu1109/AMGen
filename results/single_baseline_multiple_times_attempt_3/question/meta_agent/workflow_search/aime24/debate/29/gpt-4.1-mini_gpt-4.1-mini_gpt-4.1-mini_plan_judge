Question: There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\times5$ grid such that: 

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The problem requires placing chips on a 5x5 grid with constraints that each row and column with chips is monochromatic, and the placement is maximal (no additional chip can be added without violating the monochromatic row/column condition). Each cell can have at most one chip, and chips are either white or black. The key insight is that the color of a chip in cell (i,j) must match both the color assigned to row i and column j. If the row and column colors differ, the cell is empty. Maximality means all cells where row and column colors match must be occupied. Rows and columns can also be empty (no chips). Thus, each row and column can be assigned one of three states: white, black, or empty. The sets of white and black rows (and columns) are disjoint. The number of ways to assign colors to rows is 3^5 (each row: white, black, or empty), similarly for columns 3^5. Total assignments = 3^5 * 3^5 = 3^{10} = 59049. Each assignment corresponds to a unique maximal placement. The initial answer of 1024 considered only two colors per row/column (white or black), ignoring the possibility of empty rows/columns, which is necessary for maximality and chip availability constraints. Therefore, the correct count is 59049.
