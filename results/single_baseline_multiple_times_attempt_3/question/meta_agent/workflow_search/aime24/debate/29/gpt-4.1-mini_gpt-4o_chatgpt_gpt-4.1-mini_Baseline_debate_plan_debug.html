    <pre>There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\times5$ grid such that: 

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.

### thinking by Debate Agent KDDS:
To solve this problem, we need to consider how to place the chips such that each row and each column contains chips of only one color, and any additional chip would violate this condition. Since there are 25 cells and 25 chips of each color, the grid must be completely filled. If we place chips of one color in a row, then all the columns that intersect with this row must also contain chips of the same color. This means that either all rows and columns are filled with one color, or there is a division such that rows and columns are filled with different colors in a consistent manner. The possible configurations are: 1) All chips in the grid are of one color (either all white or all black). 2) A square sub-grid of white chips and the rest black, or vice versa. The valid configurations are: a) All 25 cells are filled with white chips. b) All 25 cells are filled with black chips. c) A k x k sub-grid is filled with white chips, and the remaining (5-k) x (5-k) sub-grid is filled with black chips. The possible values of k range from 0 to 5. For each value of k, there are 2 choices (either the k x k sub-grid is white, or it is black). Therefore, the number of ways is 2 (for all white or all black) plus 2 for each k from 1 to 4, which gives 2 + 2*4 = 10 ways.

### thinking by Debate Agent gRlh:
We need to fill the 5x5 grid with chips such that each row and column contains chips of the same color and any additional chip would violate this condition. This implies that each row and column must be filled entirely with either white chips or black chips. Since there are 25 chips of each color and 25 cells, each row and column must be filled with exactly one color. Therefore, the problem reduces to selecting which rows (and consequently columns) will be filled with white chips and which with black chips. Since there are 5 rows, we can choose any number of them to be filled with white chips, and the remaining will automatically be filled with black chips. The same applies to columns. The number of ways to choose k rows to be filled with white chips is given by the binomial coefficient C(5, k). Similarly, the number of ways to choose k columns to be filled with white chips is C(5, k). Thus, for each k, the number of ways to fill the grid is (C(5, k))^2. We sum this over all possible k from 0 to 5 to get the total number of ways.
