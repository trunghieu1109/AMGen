Question: There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\times5$ grid such that: 

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To solve this problem, we need to place the chips such that each row and each column contains chips of only one color, and any additional chip would violate this condition. This means that each row and column must be filled entirely with either white chips or black chips. Since there are 25 chips of each color and 25 cells, the grid must be completely filled. The problem reduces to selecting which rows (and consequently columns) will be filled with white chips and which with black chips. For each row, we can choose to fill it with either white or black chips, and the same applies to columns. Therefore, we can choose k rows to be filled with white chips and the remaining 5-k rows with black chips. The same applies to columns. The number of ways to choose k rows to be filled with white chips is given by the binomial coefficient C(5, k). Similarly, the number of ways to choose k columns to be filled with white chips is C(5, k). Thus, for each k, the number of ways to fill the grid is (C(5, k))^2. We sum this over all possible k from 0 to 5 to get the total number of ways. This gives us the sum: (C(5,0))^2 + (C(5,1))^2 + (C(5,2))^2 + (C(5,3))^2 + (C(5,4))^2 + (C(5,5))^2 = 1^2 + 5^2 + 10^2 + 10^2 + 5^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 25 + 100 + 100 + 25 + 1 = 252.
