Question: Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: Since every resident owns candy hearts, owning exactly two things means owning candy hearts plus exactly one of the other three items (diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade). Owning exactly three things means candy hearts plus exactly two of the other three items, and owning exactly four things means candy hearts plus all three other items. Let the number of residents owning all four items be x. Given: exactly two things = 437, exactly three things = 234, total residents = 900, and the sizes of the sets D=195, G=367, S=562. Using inclusion-exclusion and the given data, we set up equations and solve for x, resulting in x = 73.
