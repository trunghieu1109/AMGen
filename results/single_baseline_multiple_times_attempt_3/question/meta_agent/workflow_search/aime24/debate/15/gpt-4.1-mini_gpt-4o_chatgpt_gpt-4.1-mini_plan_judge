Question: Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: To solve this problem, we need to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. We have three sets: D for diamond ring owners, G for golf club owners, and S for garden spade owners. We know |D| = 195, |G| = 367, |S| = 562, and the total number of residents is 900. We are given that 437 residents own exactly two of these items, and 234 residents own all three items. We need to find the number of residents who own all four items, including candy hearts. Since everyone owns candy hearts, the number of residents who own all four items is the same as the number who own all three of the other items, which is 234. Therefore, the number of residents who own all four items is 234.
