    <pre>Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.

### thinking by Debate Agent BFmW:
Let&#39;s denote the sets as follows: D = diamond ring owners, G = golf clubs owners, S = garden spade owners, C = candy hearts owners. We know: |D| = 195, |G| = 367, |S| = 562, |C| = 900 (since all residents own candy hearts). The total number of residents is N = 900. We are given: number of residents owning exactly two of these things = 437, number owning exactly three of these things = 234. We want to find the number of residents owning all four things, which is |D ∩ G ∩ S ∩ C| = x. Since everyone owns candy hearts, the problem reduces to the intersection of the other three items plus candy hearts. Let&#39;s define: Let A = {D, G, S} sets and C is always present. So owning exactly two things means owning candy hearts plus exactly one of the other three items, or owning exactly two of the other three items plus candy hearts. But since candy hearts is owned by all, the number of things owned is at least one (candy hearts). Owning exactly two things means owning candy hearts plus exactly one of the other three items. Owning exactly three things means candy hearts plus exactly two of the other three items. Owning exactly four things means candy hearts plus all three other items. So: - Exactly two things: candy hearts + exactly one of {D, G, S} = number of residents who own exactly one of {D, G, S} = 437 - Exactly three things: candy hearts + exactly two of {D, G, S} = number of residents who own exactly two of {D, G, S} = 234 - Exactly four things: candy hearts + all three of {D, G, S} = x (to find) Total residents = 900. Let&#39;s denote: Let n1 = number of residents owning exactly one of {D, G, S}, n2 = number owning exactly two of {D, G, S}, n3 = number owning all three of {D, G, S}. We have: n1 = 437, n2 = 234, n3 = x. Also, some residents own none of {D, G, S}, but all own candy hearts. So total residents: n0 + n1 + n2 + n3 = 900, where n0 is number owning none of {D, G, S}. So n0 = 900 - (437 + 234 + x) = 229 - x. Now, sum of sizes: |D| + |G| + |S| = 195 + 367 + 562 = 1124. Using inclusion-exclusion for three sets: |D ∪ G ∪ S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - sum of pairwise intersections + |D ∩ G ∩ S|. Also, |D ∪ G ∪ S| = number of residents owning at least one of {D, G, S} = n1 + n2 + n3 = 437 + 234 + x = 671 + x. From inclusion-exclusion, sum of pairwise intersections = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D ∪ G ∪ S| + |D ∩ G ∩ S| = 1124 - (671 + x) + x = 1124 - 671 = 453. So sum of pairwise intersections = 453. Now, the number of residents owning exactly two of {D, G, S} is n2 = 234. But the number of residents owning exactly two sets is sum of pairwise intersections minus 3 times the triple intersection (since triple intersection counted thrice in pairwise intersections). So: n2 = sum of pairwise intersections - 3*n3. Therefore, 234 = 453 - 3x =&gt; 3x = 453 - 234 = 219 =&gt; x = 73. So, the number of residents who own all four things (candy hearts plus all three other items) is 73.

Let&#39;s define the sets as follows: D = diamond ring owners, G = golf clubs owners, S = garden spade owners, and C = candy hearts owners. We know: |D| = 195, |G| = 367, |S| = 562, and |C| = 900 (since every resident owns candy hearts). The total number of residents is 900. Also given: 437 own exactly two of these items, and 234 own exactly three of these items. We want to find how many own all four items.

Let x be the number of residents who own all four items.

We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion and the given data about exactly two and three items.

Every resident owns candy hearts, so candy hearts is a universal set here. The problem essentially reduces to the three other items plus candy hearts always owned.

Let&#39;s consider the number of residents owning exactly one item (among D, G, S, since C is owned by all).

We have:
- Number of residents owning exactly one of the three items (D, G, S) = a
- Number owning exactly two of the three items = 437
- Number owning exactly three of the three items = 234
- Number owning all four items = x

But the problem says 437 own exactly two of these things (including candy hearts), and 234 own exactly three of these things (including candy hearts).

Since candy hearts is owned by all, owning exactly two items means owning candy hearts plus exactly one of the other three items.
Owning exactly three items means owning candy hearts plus exactly two of the other three items.
Owning exactly four items means owning candy hearts plus all three other items.

Therefore:
- Exactly two items: candy hearts + exactly one of D, G, S = 437
- Exactly three items: candy hearts + exactly two of D, G, S = 234
- Exactly four items: candy hearts + all three items = x

Let’s define:
- Number owning only D (and candy hearts) = d
- Number owning only G (and candy hearts) = g
- Number owning only S (and candy hearts) = s

So, d + g + s = 437

Number owning exactly two of D, G, S (and candy hearts) = 234

Number owning all three D, G, S (and candy hearts) = x

Total residents = 900

Sum of owners:
- Total owning D = 195 = d + (number owning D and G only) + (number owning D and S only) + x
- Total owning G = 367 = g + (number owning D and G only) + (number owning G and S only) + x
- Total owning S = 562 = s + (number owning D and S only) + (number owning G and S only) + x

Let’s denote:
- Number owning D and G only = a
- Number owning D and S only = b
- Number owning G and S only = c

We have:
d + g + s = 437

a + b + c = 234

From the totals:
195 = d + a + b + x
367 = g + a + c + x
562 = s + b + c + x

Adding these three equations:
195 + 367 + 562 = (d + g + s) + 2(a + b + c) + 3x
1124 = 437 + 2*234 + 3x
1124 = 437 + 468 + 3x
1124 = 905 + 3x
3x = 1124 - 905 = 219
x = 73

So, the number of residents who own all four things is 73.

    <pre>Since every resident owns candy hearts, owning exactly two things means owning candy hearts plus exactly one of the other three items (diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade). Owning exactly three things means candy hearts plus exactly two of the other three items, and owning exactly four things means candy hearts plus all three other items. Let the number of residents owning all four items be x. Given: exactly two things = 437, exactly three things = 234, total residents = 900, and the sizes of the sets D=195, G=367, S=562.
