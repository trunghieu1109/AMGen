Question: Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: Let f1,f2,f3,f4 be the numbers of residents owning exactly 1,2,3,4 items respectively. We know f2=437 and f3=234, and f1+f2+f3+f4=900, so f1=900−437−234−f4=229−f4. The total item-ownership count is 195+367+562+900=2024, which also equals f1+2f2+3f3+4f4. Substituting gives 2024=(229−f4)+2·437+3·234+4f4=1805+3f4, hence 219=3f4 and f4=73.
