    <pre>Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.

### thinking by Debate Agent dfcp:
To solve this problem, we need to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let&#39;s define sets: D for diamond ring owners, G for golf club owners, S for garden spade owners, and C for candy heart owners. We are given that all residents own candy hearts, so we focus on D, G, and S. The total number of residents is 900. We know |D| = 195, |G| = 367, |S| = 562, |D ∪ G ∪ S| = 900 (since everyone owns candy hearts), |D ∩ G ∩ S| = 234, and |D ∩ G| + |D ∩ S| + |G ∩ S| = 437 (since these are residents owning exactly two of the three items). We need to find |D ∩ G ∩ S ∩ C|. Since everyone owns candy hearts, |D ∩ G ∩ S ∩ C| = |D ∩ G ∩ S|. Therefore, the number of residents who own all four items, including candy hearts, is equal to the number of residents who own all three of the other items, which is 234.

To find the number of residents who own all four items, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let A be the set of residents who own a diamond ring, B be the set of residents who own a set of golf clubs, C be the set of residents who own a garden spade, and D be the set of residents who own a bag of candy hearts (which is all 900 residents). We know |A| = 195, |B| = 367, |C| = 562, |D| = 900, |A ∩ B ∩ C| = 234, and |(A ∩ B) ∪ (B ∩ C) ∪ (A ∩ C)| = 437. We need to find |A ∩ B ∩ C ∩ D|. By the principle of inclusion-exclusion for three sets A, B, and C: |A ∪ B ∪ C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A ∩ B| - |B ∩ C| - |A ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ C|. Since all own D, we have |A ∪ B ∪ C ∪ D| = 900. Also, |A ∩ B| + |B ∩ C| + |A ∩ C| = 437. Plugging in the values: |A ∪ B ∪ C| = 195 + 367 + 562 - 437 + 234. Solving this gives |A ∪ B ∪ C| = 921. However, since all residents own D, we adjust: |A ∩ B ∩ C ∩ D| = 900 - |A ∪ B ∪ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ C| = 900 - 921 + 234 = 213.
