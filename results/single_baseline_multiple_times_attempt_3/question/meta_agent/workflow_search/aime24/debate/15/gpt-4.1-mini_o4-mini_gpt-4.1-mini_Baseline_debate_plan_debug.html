    <pre>Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.

### thinking by Debate Agent 3jGt:
Let x_k be the number of residents owning exactly k items (out of D, G, S, C). We have x_2 = 437, x_3 = 234 and x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 = 900, so x_1 + x_4 = 900 - 437 - 234 = 229. Also the total count of item-owners is N(D)+N(G)+N(S)+N(C) = 195 + 367 + 562 + 900 = 2024, which equals 1·x_1 + 2·x_2 + 3·x_3 + 4·x_4. Substituting x_2 and x_3 gives x_1 + 874 + 702 + 4x_4 = 2024 ⇒ x_1 + 4x_4 = 448. Subtracting x_1 + x_4 = 229 yields 3x_4 = 219, so x_4 = 73.

### thinking by Debate Agent q7x9:
We have four items: diamond rings (D), golf clubs (G), garden spades (S), and candy hearts (C). There are 900 residents total, and everyone owns candy hearts, so |C|=900. Given |D|=195, |G|=367, |S|=562, and |C|=900. Also given: f2 = 437 residents own exactly two items, and f3 = 234 own exactly three items. Let f1 be the number owning exactly one, and f4 the number owning all four. Then total residents: 900 = f1 + f2 + f3 + f4. (1) The total count of item-ownerships is N1 = |D|+|G|+|S|+|C| = 195+367+562+900 = 2024. But also N1 = f1·1 + f2·2 + f3·3 + f4·4. (2) From (1): f1 = 900 - 437 - 234 - f4 = 229 - f4. Substitute into (2): 2024 = (229 - f4) + 2·437 + 3·234 + 4·f4 = 229 - f4 + 874 + 702 + 4f4 = 1805 + 3f4. Hence 2024 - 1805 = 3f4, so 219 = 3f4, giving f4 = 73.

    <pre>Let f1,f2,f3,f4 be the numbers of residents owning exactly 1,2,3,4 items respectively. We know f2=437 and f3=234, and f1+f2+f3+f4=900, so f1=900−437−234−f4=229−f4. The total item-ownership count is 195+367+562+900=2024, which also equals f1+2f2+3f3+4f4. Substituting gives 2024=(229−f4)+2·437+3·234+4f4=1805+3f4, hence 219=3f4 and f4=73.
