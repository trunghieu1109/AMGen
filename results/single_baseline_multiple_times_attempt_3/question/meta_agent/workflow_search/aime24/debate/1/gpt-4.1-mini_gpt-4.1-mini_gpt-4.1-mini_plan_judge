Question: Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.

proposed answer: The problem involves a triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω, with tangents at B and C intersecting at D. The line AD intersects ω again at P. Given side lengths AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10, we want to find AP in simplest fractional form. Using the property of tangents and poles, D is the pole of line BC, and the points A and P lie on ω such that (B,C;A,P) form a harmonic division. A well-known result in this configuration is that AP = (AB * AC) / BC. Substituting the given lengths, AP = (5 * 10) / 9 = 50/9. Therefore, m=50 and n=9, and m+n=59.
