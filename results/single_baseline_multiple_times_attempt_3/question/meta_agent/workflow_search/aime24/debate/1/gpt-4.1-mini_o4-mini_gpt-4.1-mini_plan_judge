Question: Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: We place B=(0,0), C=(9,0) and find A by distances AB=5 and AC=10, giving A=(1/3,4√14/3). The tangents at B and C meet at D, and line AD meets the circumcircle again at P. By power of point at D: DA·DP=DB². With DA=325/22 and DB=225/22, we get DP=88/169·DA so AP=100/13. Thus m=100, n=13 and m+n=113.
