Question: Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.\Pattern: debate
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Final Decision Agent wRI0', content='We place B=(0,0), C=(9,0) and find A by distances AB=5 and AC=10, giving A=(1/3,4√14/3). The tangents at B and C meet at D, and line AD meets the circumcircle again at P. By power of point at D: DA·DP=DB². With DA=325/22 and DB=225/22, we get DP=88/169·DA so AP=100/13. Thus m=100, n=13 and m+n=113.\n\nAnswer:113', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.

Compute tangents at B and C: slopes ±84/(11√14), intersect at D=(4.5,−27√14/11). Parametrize line AD: A+tv, v=D−A=(12.5/3,−125√14/33). Use the fact that the circumcircle centered at O satisfies |A−O|²=R² and also |A−O +tv|²=R² for the second intersection P. Expanding gives t(2(A−O)·v +t|v|²)=0, so the nonzero root is t=−2(A−O)·v/|v|². We compute (A−O)·v=−625/11, |v|²=105625/484, hence t=968/1859. Then AP=|v|·t=(325/22)·(968/1859)=100/13. Thus m=100, n=13, so m+n=113.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent lsbD:\nWe place B=(0,0), C=(9,0), find A by solving x^2+y^2=25, (x−9)^2+y^2=100 → A=(1/3,4√14/3). Compute circumcenter O via perpendicular bisectors → O=(4.5,33/(4√14)), R=75/(4√14). Tangent at B has slope −6√14/11, at C slope 6√14/11; they meet at D=(4.5,−27√14/11). The line AD meets the circle again at P. Use power of point at D: DA·DP=DB^2. We compute DA=325/22, DB=225/22, so t_p=AP/AD=1−(DB/AD)^2=1−(9/13)^2=88/169. Hence AP=(88/169)·(325/22)=100/13, so m+n=100+13=113.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent N0Ch:\n113\n\n### answer by Debate Agent lsbD:\n113\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
