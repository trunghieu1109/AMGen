Question: Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: We seek positive integers n with two base-b digits x,y (x>0) satisfying x+y=√n=m and n=xb+y=m².  Substituting y=m−x into xb+y gives x(b−1)=m(m−1).  Thus denoting d=b−1, we need d∣m(m−1), and m< b so m≤d.  The congruence m(m−1)≡0 mod d has exactly 2^ω(d) solutions modulo d, of which one is m=1 (too small) and the rest give valid two-digit squares n=m²≥b.  Hence the number of b-eautiful n is 2^ω(b−1)−1.  We want 2^ω(b−1)−1>10 ⇒2^ω(b−1)>11 ⇒ω(b−1)≥4.  The smallest integer with 4 distinct prime factors is 2·3·5·7=210, so b−1=210 ⇒b=211.
