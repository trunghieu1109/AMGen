Question: Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.

proposed answer: To determine the smallest base b for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers, we need to consider the condition that a number n is b-eautiful if it has exactly two digits in base b and the sum of these digits equals the square root of n. A two-digit number in base b can be expressed as n = ab + c, where a and c are digits from 0 to b-1, and a is non-zero. The condition is that a + c = sqrt(n), which implies n = (a + c)^2. We need to find the number of such n for each base b. For b = 2, there are 2 numbers: 10_2 = 2 and 11_2 = 3. For b = 3, there are 6 numbers: 10_3 = 3, 11_3 = 4, 12_3 = 5, 20_3 = 6, 21_3 = 7, 22_3 = 8. For b = 4, there are 12 numbers: 10_4 = 4, 11_4 = 5, 12_4 = 6, 13_4 = 7, 20_4 = 8, 21_4 = 9, 22_4 = 10, 23_4 = 11, 30_4 = 12, 31_4 = 13, 32_4 = 14, 33_4 = 15. Since b = 4 gives us more than 10 b-eautiful numbers, it is the smallest b that satisfies the condition.
