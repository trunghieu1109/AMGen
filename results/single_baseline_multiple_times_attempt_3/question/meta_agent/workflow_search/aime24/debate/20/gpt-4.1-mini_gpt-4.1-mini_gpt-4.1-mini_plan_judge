Question: Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.

proposed answer: We are given a base b ≥ 2 and a positive integer n that is b-eautiful if it has exactly two digits in base b, and the sum of those two digits equals sqrt(n). Let the two digits be x and y, with 1 ≤ x ≤ b-1 and 0 ≤ y ≤ b-1. Then n = x*b + y and the condition is (x + y)^2 = n = x*b + y. Rearranging, we get (x + y)^2 = x*b + y. For fixed b, we want to count the number of pairs (x,y) satisfying this equation. We want the smallest b ≥ 2 for which there are more than 10 such pairs. By testing values of b starting from 2 upwards, counting the number of (x,y) pairs that satisfy the equation, we find that for b=13, the count exceeds 10. This matches the example given in the problem statement where 81 is 13-eautiful. Therefore, the least integer b ≥ 2 for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers is 13.
