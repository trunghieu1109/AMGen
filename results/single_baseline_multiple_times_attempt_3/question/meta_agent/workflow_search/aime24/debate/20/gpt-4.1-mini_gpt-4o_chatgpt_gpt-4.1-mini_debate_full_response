Question: Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.\Pattern: debate
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Final Decision Agent ztak', content='To determine the smallest base b for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers, we need to consider the condition that a number n is b-eautiful if it has exactly two digits in base b and the sum of these digits equals the square root of n. A two-digit number in base b can be expressed as n = ab + c, where a and c are digits from 0 to b-1, and a is non-zero. The condition is that a + c = sqrt(n), which implies n = (a + c)^2. We need to find the number of such n for each base b. For b = 2, there are 2 numbers: 10_2 = 2 and 11_2 = 3. For b = 3, there are 6 numbers: 10_3 = 3, 11_3 = 4, 12_3 = 5, 20_3 = 6, 21_3 = 7, 22_3 = 8. For b = 4, there are 12 numbers: 10_4 = 4, 11_4 = 5, 12_4 = 6, 13_4 = 7, 20_4 = 8, 21_4 = 9, 22_4 = 10, 23_4 = 11, 30_4 = 12, 31_4 = 13, 32_4 = 14, 33_4 = 15. Since b = 4 gives us more than 10 b-eautiful numbers, it is the smallest b that satisfies the condition.\n\nAnswer:4', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.

In base b, a two-digit number can be expressed as ab + c, where a and c are digits from 0 to b-1, and a is non-zero. The condition is that a + c = sqrt(n). We want to find the smallest b such that there are more than 10 such numbers.\n\nTo find the smallest b, we need to determine how many numbers n fit the criteria for each b. For a given b, valid n are those where n = (a * b + c)^2 and a + c = sqrt(n), which means n = (a * b + c) and a + c = sqrt(n) = a + c.\n\nLet's calculate for different values of b:\n\nFor b = 2, the possible numbers are: 10_2 = 2, 11_2 = 3. These give us 2 numbers.\n\nFor b = 3, the numbers are: 10_3 = 3, 11_3 = 4, 12_3 = 5, 20_3 = 6, 21_3 = 7, 22_3 = 8. These give us 6 numbers.\n\nFor b = 4, the numbers are: 10_4 = 4, 11_4 = 5, 12_4 = 6, 13_4 = 7, 20_4 = 8, 21_4 = 9, 22_4 = 10, 23_4 = 11, 30_4 = 12, 31_4 = 13, 32_4 = 14, 33_4 = 15. These give us 12 numbers.\n\nSince b = 4 gives us more than 10 b-eautiful numbers, it is the smallest b that satisfies the condition.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent TPJg:\nTo find the least integer b for which there are more than ten b-beautiful integers, we start by expressing a two-digit number in base b as \\( n = ab + c \\), where a and c are digits in base b. The condition for n to be b-beautiful is that the sum of the digits (a + c) equals the square root of n, i.e., \\( \\sqrt{n} = a + c \\). Therefore, \\( n = (a + c)^2 \\). Substituting for n gives us the equation \\( (ab + c) = (a + c)^2 \\). We rearrange and simplify to find possible values of a and c that satisfy this equation for a given b. We repeat this process for increasing values of b, counting the number of valid (a, c) pairs for each b. We continue until we find a b with more than ten such pairs.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent KEFl:\n4\n\n### answer by Debate Agent TPJg:\n10\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
