    <pre>Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.

### thinking by Debate Agent KEFl:
A number n is b-eautiful if it has exactly two digits in base b, and these digits sum to the square root of n. In base b, a two-digit number can be expressed as ab + c, where a and c are digits from 0 to b-1, and a is non-zero. The condition is that a + c = sqrt(n). We want to find the smallest b such that there are more than 10 such numbers.

To find the smallest b, we need to determine how many numbers n fit the criteria for each b. For a given b, valid n are those where n = (a * b + c)^2 and a + c = sqrt(n), which means n = (a * b + c) and a + c = sqrt(n) = a + c.

Let&#39;s calculate for different values of b:

For b = 2, the possible numbers are: 10_2 = 2, 11_2 = 3. These give us 2 numbers.

For b = 3, the numbers are: 10_3 = 3, 11_3 = 4, 12_3 = 5, 20_3 = 6, 21_3 = 7, 22_3 = 8. These give us 6 numbers.

For b = 4, the numbers are: 10_4 = 4, 11_4 = 5, 12_4 = 6, 13_4 = 7, 20_4 = 8, 21_4 = 9, 22_4 = 10, 23_4 = 11, 30_4 = 12, 31_4 = 13, 32_4 = 14, 33_4 = 15. These give us 12 numbers.

Since b = 4 gives us more than 10 b-eautiful numbers, it is the smallest b that satisfies the condition.

### thinking by Debate Agent TPJg:
To find the least integer b for which there are more than ten b-beautiful integers, we start by expressing a two-digit number in base b as \( n = ab + c \), where a and c are digits in base b. The condition for n to be b-beautiful is that the sum of the digits (a + c) equals the square root of n, i.e., \( \sqrt{n} = a + c \). Therefore, \( n = (a + c)^2 \). Substituting for n gives us the equation \( (ab + c) = (a + c)^2 \). We rearrange and simplify to find possible values of a and c that satisfy this equation for a given b. We repeat this process for increasing values of b, counting the number of valid (a, c) pairs for each b. We continue until we find a b with more than ten such pairs.

Since b = 4 gives us more than 10 b-eautiful numbers, it is the smallest b that satisfies the condition.
