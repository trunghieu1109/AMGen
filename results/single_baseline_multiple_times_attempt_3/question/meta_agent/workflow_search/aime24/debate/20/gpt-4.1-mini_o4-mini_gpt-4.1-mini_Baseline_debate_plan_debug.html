    <pre>Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.

### thinking by Debate Agent 5GRK:
We seek positive integers n=db+c (two-digit in base b) satisfying d+c=√n.  Equivalently letting s=√n, we have s integer, n=s², and digits d,c satisfying d+c=s, db+c=s².  Solving gives d=s(s−1)/(b−1), c=s(b−s)/(b−1), so integral solutions correspond to integers s∈[2,b−1] with (b−1)∣s(s−1).  Writing m=b−1, the count of such s is 2^{ω(m)}−1 (all solutions mod m except s≡1).  We need this count &gt;10, so 2^{ω(m)}−1&gt;10 ⇒2^{ω(m)}&gt;11 ⇒ω(m)≥4.  The least m with 4 distinct prime factors is 2⋅3⋅5⋅7=210, giving b=m+1=211.

We need to count, for each integer base b≥2, the number of positive integers n that when written in base b have exactly two digits x and y (with x&gt;0) and satisfy x+y=√n (so n is a square m²). Writing n=xb+y gives x·b+y=m² and x+y=m, so x(b−1)=m(m−1). Let d=b−1. Then x exists integer ⇔ d∣m(m−1). Also two‐digit means m&lt; b ⇒ m ≤d. Also m≥√b so we count m∈[⌈√b⌉,d] with m(m−1)≡0 mod d. The congruence m(m−1)≡0 mod d has exactly 2^k solutions mod d, where k=number of distinct primes dividing d. In the range [1,…,d] there are 2^k such m; excluding m&lt;⌈√b⌉ removes at least m=1, so count ≤2^k−1. We want &gt;10, so need 2^k−1&gt;10 ⇒2^k&gt;11 ⇒k≥4. Thus b−1 must have at least 4 distinct prime factors. The smallest product of 4 distinct primes is 2·3·5·7=210, so the least b is 210+1=211, which indeed yields 2^4−1=15 such integers.

    <pre>We seek positive integers n with two base-b digits x,y (x&gt;0) satisfying x+y=√n=m and n=xb+y=m².  Substituting y=m−x into xb+y gives x(b−1)=m(m−1).  Thus denoting d=b−1, we need d∣m(m−1), and m&lt; b so m≤d.  The congruence m(m−1)≡0 mod d has exactly 2^ω(d) solutions modulo d, of which one is m=1 (too small) and the rest give valid two-digit squares n=m²≥b.  Hence the number of b-eautiful n is 2^ω(b−1)−1.  We want 2^ω(b−1)−1&gt;10 ⇒2^ω(b−1)&gt;11 ⇒ω(b−1)≥4.  The smallest integer with 4 distinct prime factors is 2·3·5·7=210, so b−1=210 ⇒b=211.
