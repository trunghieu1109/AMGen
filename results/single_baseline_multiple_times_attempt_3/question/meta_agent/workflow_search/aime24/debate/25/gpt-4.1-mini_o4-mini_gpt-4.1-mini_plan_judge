Question: Let ABCDEF be a convex equilateral hexagon in which all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle whose sides are extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. Find the side length of the hexagon.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: Let the three edge‐directions of the hexagon be given by vectors u, v, w of common length s, with BC∥EF, CD∥FA and DE∥AB so that opposite sides are parallel.  One computes that the ‘‘big’’ triangle formed by extending AB, CD, EF is partitioned on each side into three collinear segments whose lengths are proportional to s:

– Along the CD‐line one finds segment lengths proportional to b·s, s, (b/a)·s,
– Along the EF‐line one finds lengths a·s,     s, (a/b)·s,
– Along the AB‐line one finds lengths (ab)·s, s, (1/(ab))·s,

where v=a u+b w.  Thus the three side‐lengths L₁,L₂,L₃ of the triangle satisfy

L₁ = s·(b+1+b/a),
L₂ = s·(a+1+a/b),
L₃ = s·(ab+1+1/(ab)).

Given {L₁,L₂,L₃}={200,240,300}, one finds that the only positive solution is s=400.
