Question: Let ABCDEF be a convex equilateral hexagon in which all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle whose sides are extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. Find the side length of the hexagon.

proposed answer: The problem describes a convex equilateral hexagon ABCDEF with all pairs of opposite sides parallel. Such a hexagon can be viewed as the intersection of three strips bounded by pairs of parallel lines. The triangle formed by the extensions of sides AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. These sides correspond to the distances between the pairs of parallel lines. The hexagon's side length s equals the inradius of this triangle because the hexagon is the intersection of three strips of width s around the triangle. To find s, we calculate the inradius r of the triangle with sides 200, 240, and 300. Using Heron's formula, the semi-perimeter p = (200+240+300)/2 = 370. The area A = sqrt(p(p-200)(p-240)(p-300)) = sqrt(370*170*130*70) ≈ 75,600. The inradius r = 2A / (a+b+c) = 2*75,600 / 740 ≈ 204.32. Therefore, the side length of the hexagon is approximately 204. The previous answer of 160 was based on an incorrect harmonic mean approach, while the inradius method aligns with the geometric interpretation of the hexagon as the intersection of strips around the triangle.
