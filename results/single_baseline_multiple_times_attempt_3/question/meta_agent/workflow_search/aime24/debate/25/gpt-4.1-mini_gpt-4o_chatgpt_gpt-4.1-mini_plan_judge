Question: Let ABCDEF be a convex equilateral hexagon in which all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle whose sides are extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. Find the side length of the hexagon.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The hexagon ABCDEF is a special type of hexagon where all opposite sides are parallel and equal in length, making it a symmetric hexagon. The triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. This triangle is related to the hexagon's geometry, and its side lengths are proportional to the differences in the hexagon's side lengths. The key to solving this problem is recognizing that the side lengths of the triangle are proportional to the hexagon's side length. The greatest common divisor of the triangle's side lengths (200, 240, 300) is 20, which suggests that the side length of the hexagon is 20. This is because the triangle's side lengths are integer multiples of the hexagon's side length, and the GCD gives the smallest possible integer side length for the hexagon that maintains the proportionality.
