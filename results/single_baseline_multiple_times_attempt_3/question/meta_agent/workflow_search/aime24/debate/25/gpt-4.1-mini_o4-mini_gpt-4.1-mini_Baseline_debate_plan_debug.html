    <pre>Let ABCDEF be a convex equilateral hexagon in which all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle whose sides are extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. Find the side length of the hexagon.

### thinking by Debate Agent jrg1:
We recognize that for a regular hexagon of side length s with opposite sides parallel, the three lines containing sides AB, CD, and EF meet in an equilateral triangle of side length 3s.  In any affine image of such a regular hexagon (which preserves parallelism and equilateral‐side property of the hexagon), the triangle formed by those lines will be an affine image of the equilateral triangle of side 3s, hence its three side‐lengths will be some permutation of 3s, 3s, and 3s.  Here the given triangle has sides 200, 240, 300, so one of these must equal 3s; the only one divisible by 3 is 300.  Therefore 3s=300 and s=100.

### thinking by Debate Agent BBnt:
We model the convex equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel via vectors u,v,w in the plane with |u|=|v|=|w|=s and u+v+w−u−v−w=0.  Lines AB, CD, EF correspond to directions u,w,−v through points A,C,E.  Computing their pairwise intersections along these lines shows the triangle’s side lengths are l1=N s/|b|, l2=N s/(|a b|), l3=N s/|a|, where a,b satisfy w=a u+b v and N=|a(b+1)−b|.  Matching (l1,l2,l3)=(200,240,300) gives |a|=200/240=5/6, |b|=300/240=5/4, N=5/8.  Then s=l1|b|/N=200·(5/4)/(5/8)=400.

    <pre>Let the three edge‐directions of the hexagon be given by vectors u, v, w of common length s, with BC∥EF, CD∥FA and DE∥AB so that opposite sides are parallel.  One computes that the ‘‘big’’ triangle formed by extending AB, CD, EF is partitioned on each side into three collinear segments whose lengths are proportional to s:

– Along the CD‐line one finds segment lengths proportional to b·s, s, (b/a)·s,
– Along the EF‐line one finds lengths a·s,     s, (a/b)·s,
– Along the AB‐line one finds lengths (ab)·s, s, (1/(ab))·s,

where v=a u+b w.  Thus the three side‐lengths L₁,L₂,L₃ of the triangle satisfy

L₁ = s·(b+1+b/a),
L₂ = s·(a+1+a/b),
L₃ = s·(ab+1+1/(ab)).

Given {L₁,L₂,L₃}={200,240,300}, one finds that the only positive solution is s=400.
