    <pre>Let ABCDEF be a convex equilateral hexagon in which all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle whose sides are extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. Find the side length of the hexagon.

### thinking by Debate Agent pgco:
Given the hexagon ABCDEF with all opposite sides parallel, we recognize that the hexagon can be decomposed into three pairs of parallel sides: AB || DE, BC || EF, and CD || FA. The triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF has sides 200, 240, and 300. This triangle is known as a triangle of cevians, and its sides correspond to the differences in lengths of the parallel sides of the hexagon. If we denote the side length of the hexagon as x, then the side pairs contribute differences of x, x, and x to the triangle&#39;s sides. Using the triangle&#39;s side lengths, we solve for x. The triangle sides are actually the sums of the differences of the hexagon&#39;s opposite sides. Therefore, set up equations based on the triangle&#39;s side lengths: 200 = |x - x| = 0, 240 = |x - x| = 0, 300 = |x - x| = 0, which suggests a misinterpretation. Instead, consider the known property of such hexagons: the triangle&#39;s sides are proportional to the hexagon&#39;s sides. The side length x of the hexagon is related to the sides of the triangle by a factor of the triangle&#39;s perimeter to the hexagon&#39;s perimeter. Given the triangle&#39;s sides are 200, 240, and 300, the perimeter is 740, and the hexagon&#39;s perimeter is 6x. The side length of the hexagon is obtained from the ratio of these perimeters.

### thinking by Debate Agent 8NO9:
Given that ABCDEF is a convex equilateral hexagon with all pairs of opposite sides parallel, it is a special type of hexagon known as a &#39;regular hexagon&#39;. The triangle formed by the extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. The key here is to note that the opposite sides of the hexagon are parallel and equal in length, and the triangle formed by the extensions of these sides is related to the hexagon&#39;s geometry. The side lengths 200, 240, and 300 suggest that this triangle is a scaled version of the hexagon&#39;s geometry. The triangle&#39;s side lengths can be associated with the differences in the coordinates of the hexagon&#39;s vertices, considering their parallelism and equal lengths. By applying the triangle inequality and properties of parallel sides, we can deduce the side length of the hexagon. The hexagon&#39;s side length is determined by the greatest common divisor of the triangle&#39;s side lengths, which is 20.

    <pre>The hexagon ABCDEF is a special type of hexagon where all opposite sides are parallel and equal in length, making it a symmetric hexagon. The triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. This triangle is related to the hexagon&#39;s geometry, and its side lengths are proportional to the differences in the hexagon&#39;s side lengths. The key to solving this problem is recognizing that the side lengths of the triangle are proportional to the hexagon&#39;s side length. The greatest common divisor of the triangle&#39;s side lengths (200, 240, 300) is 20, which suggests that the side length of the hexagon is 20. This is because the triangle&#39;s side lengths are integer multiples of the hexagon&#39;s side length, and the GCD gives the smallest possible integer side length for the hexagon that maintains the proportionality.
