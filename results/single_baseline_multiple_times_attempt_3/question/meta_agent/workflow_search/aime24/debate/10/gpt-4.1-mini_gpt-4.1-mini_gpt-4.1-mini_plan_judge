Question: Rectangles $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are drawn such that $D,E,C,F$ are collinear. Also, $A,D,H,G$ all lie on a circle. If $BC=16$,$AB=107$,$FG=17$, and $EF=184$, what is the length of $CE$?
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: We have two rectangles ABCD and EFGH with given side lengths. Points D, E, C, F are collinear, and points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. By placing ABCD on the coordinate plane with A at (0,0), B at (107,0), C at (107,16), and D at (0,16), the line through D and C is y=16. Since D, E, C, F are collinear, E and F lie on y=16. Let E = (x,16), then F = (x+184,16) because EF=184. Since EFGH is a rectangle and FG=17, FG is vertical, so G = (x+184, -1) and H = (x, -1). Points A(0,0), D(0,16), H(x,-1), and G(x+184,-1) lie on a circle. Using the circle condition, we find the center y-coordinate k=8, and relate h and x to satisfy the circle equation. Solving the resulting quadratic equation for x gives two solutions, and the reasonable one is approximately x=0.1. The length CE is then |107 - 0.1| = 106.9, which rounds to 107. Therefore, the length CE is 107.
