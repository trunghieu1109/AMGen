Question: Rectangles $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are drawn such that $D,E,C,F$ are collinear. Also, $A,D,H,G$ all lie on a circle. If $BC=16$,$AB=107$,$FG=17$, and $EF=184$, what is the length of $CE$?
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: We have two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH, with D, E, C, F collinear and A, D, H, G on a circle. We need to find CE. Since D, E, C, F are collinear, CE is the distance between C and E along the line. Given BC = 16 and EF = 184, and assuming the line is horizontal, CE is the difference between EF and AD (since AD = BC = 16). Therefore, CE = EF - AD = 184 - 16 = 168.
