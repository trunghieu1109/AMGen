Question: Rectangles $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are drawn such that $D,E,C,F$ are collinear. Also, $A,D,H,G$ all lie on a circle. If $BC=16$,$AB=107$,$FG=17$, and $EF=184$, what is the length of $CE$?
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: Place rectangle ABCD with A=(0,0), B=(107,0), C=(107,16), D=(0,16).  Since D,E,C,F are collinear on y=16 and EF=184, write E=(e,16), F=(e+184,16).  Rectangle EFGH has FG⊥EF of length 17, so G=(e+184,33), H=(e,33).  Requiring A,D,H,G to lie on a common circle leads to the condition e^2+184e+16·33−33^2=0, whose integer root is e=3.  Hence CE=|107−3|=104.
