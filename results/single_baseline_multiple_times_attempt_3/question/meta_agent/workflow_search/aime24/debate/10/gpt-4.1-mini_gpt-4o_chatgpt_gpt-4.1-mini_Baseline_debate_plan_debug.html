    <pre>Rectangles $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are drawn such that $D,E,C,F$ are collinear. Also, $A,D,H,G$ all lie on a circle. If $BC=16$,$AB=107$,$FG=17$, and $EF=184$, what is the length of $CE$?

### thinking by Debate Agent 9r3H:
We are given two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH, with certain conditions. The points D, E, C, and F are collinear, and A, D, H, G lie on a circle. The lengths of BC, AB, FG, and EF are given. We need to find the length of CE. Since D, E, C, F are collinear, CE is the distance between points C and E along the line that includes these points. We can use the given lengths of the sides of the rectangles to determine the relative positions of the points. Since ABCD is a rectangle, AD = BC = 16. Since EFGH is a rectangle, EH = FG = 17. The collinearity of D, E, C, F suggests that the line is horizontal or vertical. Since rectangles are typically aligned with coordinate axes, assume the line is horizontal. Therefore, CE = EF - AD = 184 - 16.

### thinking by Debate Agent 5WWE:
We are given two rectangles, $ABCD$ and $EFGH$, with certain sides parallel and some points collinear or on a circle. We need to find the length of $CE$. Since $D,E,C,F$ are collinear, $CE$ is the distance between $C$ and $E$. We know $BC=16$ and $EF=184$. The key is to use the properties of the rectangles and the given lengths. Since $B$ and $C$ are on rectangle $ABCD$, and $E$ and $F$ are on rectangle $EFGH$, the line $CE$ will be part of the line $CF$, which is parallel to $BE$. The length $BE$ is equal to $BC + EF$ because $E$ is directly above $B$ on the same vertical line, and $F$ is directly above $C$. Thus, $CE = EF - BC = 184 - 16 = 168$.

Since D, E, C, F are collinear, CE is the distance between C and E along the line. Given BC = 16 and EF = 184, and assuming the line is horizontal, CE is the difference between EF and AD (since AD = BC = 16). Therefore, CE = EF - AD = 184 - 16 = 168.
