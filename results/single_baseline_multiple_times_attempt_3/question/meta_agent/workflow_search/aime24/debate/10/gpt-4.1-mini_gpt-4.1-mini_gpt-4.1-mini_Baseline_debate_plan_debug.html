    <pre>Rectangles $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are drawn such that $D,E,C,F$ are collinear. Also, $A,D,H,G$ all lie on a circle. If $BC=16$,$AB=107$,$FG=17$, and $EF=184$, what is the length of $CE$?

### thinking by Debate Agent uTsp:
Let&#39;s analyze the problem step-by-step:

1. We have two rectangles ABCD and EFGH.
2. Points D, E, C, F are collinear.
3. Points A, D, H, G lie on a circle.
4. Given side lengths: BC = 16, AB = 107 for rectangle ABCD, and FG = 17, EF = 184 for rectangle EFGH.

Since ABCD is a rectangle, AB and BC are adjacent sides, so AB = 107 (width), BC = 16 (height).
Similarly, EFGH is a rectangle with EF = 184 and FG = 17.

Let&#39;s place ABCD in coordinate plane for convenience:
- Let A = (0,0)
- Then B = (107,0)
- C = (107,16)
- D = (0,16)

Now, D = (0,16).

We know D, E, C, F are collinear.
C = (107,16)
D = (0,16)
So line through D and C is y = 16.

Since D, E, C, F are collinear, E and F lie on y=16.

EFGH is a rectangle with EF = 184 and FG = 17.
EF is along y=16.

Let E = (x,16)
Then F = (x + 184,16)

Since EFGH is a rectangle, FG is perpendicular to EF.
EF is horizontal (along y=16), so FG is vertical.

Therefore:
- G = (x + 184, 16 - 17) = (x + 184, -1)
- H = (x, -1)

Points A, D, H, G lie on a circle.
Coordinates:
- A = (0,0)
- D = (0,16)
- H = (x, -1)
- G = (x + 184, -1)

We need to find x such that these four points are concyclic.

The circle passing through A, D, H, G implies:
The points satisfy the circle equation.

Let&#39;s find the circle passing through A(0,0), D(0,16), H(x,-1).

General circle equation:
(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2

Substitute points:
1) (0 - h)^2 + (0 - k)^2 = r^2 =&gt; h^2 + k^2 = r^2
2) (0 - h)^2 + (16 - k)^2 = r^2 =&gt; h^2 + (16 - k)^2 = r^2
3) (x - h)^2 + (-1 - k)^2 = r^2

From 1) and 2):
 h^2 + k^2 = h^2 + (16 - k)^2
=&gt; k^2 = (16 - k)^2
=&gt; k^2 = 256 - 32k + k^2
=&gt; 0 = 256 - 32k
=&gt; 32k = 256
=&gt; k = 8

So center y-coordinate is 8.

From 1): h^2 + 64 = r^2
From 3): (x - h)^2 + (-1 - 8)^2 = r^2
=&gt; (x - h)^2 + (-9)^2 = r^2
=&gt; (x - h)^2 + 81 = r^2

Equate with 1):
 h^2 + 64 = (x - h)^2 + 81
=&gt; h^2 + 64 - 81 = (x - h)^2
=&gt; h^2 - 17 = (x - h)^2

Expand right side:
 h^2 - 17 = x^2 - 2hx + h^2
=&gt; -17 = x^2 - 2hx
=&gt; 0 = x^2 - 2hx + 17

This is a quadratic in x.

Now, G = (x + 184, -1) lies on the same circle:
 (x + 184 - h)^2 + (-1 - 8)^2 = r^2
=&gt; (x + 184 - h)^2 + 81 = r^2

From 1): r^2 = h^2 + 64

So:
 (x + 184 - h)^2 + 81 = h^2 + 64
=&gt; (x + 184 - h)^2 = h^2 - 17

But from earlier:
 h^2 - 17 = (x - h)^2

Therefore:
 (x + 184 - h)^2 = (x - h)^2

Take square roots:
 |x + 184 - h| = |x - h|

Two cases:
Case 1: x + 184 - h = x - h
=&gt; 184 = 0 (impossible)

Case 2: x + 184 - h = -(x - h)
=&gt; x + 184 - h = -x + h
=&gt; x + 184 - h + x - h = 0
=&gt; 2x + 184 - 2h = 0
=&gt; 2x - 2h = -184
=&gt; x - h = -92

Recall from quadratic:
 0 = x^2 - 2hx + 17

Substitute h = x + 92:
 0 = x^2 - 2(x + 92)x + 17
=&gt; 0 = x^2 - 2x^2 - 184x + 17
=&gt; 0 = -x^2 - 184x + 17
=&gt; x^2 + 184x - 17 = 0

Solve quadratic for x:
 x = [-184 ± sqrt(184^2 - 4*1*(-17))]/2
 184^2 = 33856
 Discriminant = 33856 + 68 = 33924
 sqrt(33924) ≈ 184.2

So:
 x = [-184 ± 184.2]/2

Two solutions:
 x1 = (-184 + 184.2)/2 = 0.2/2 = 0.1
 x2 = (-184 - 184.2)/2 = -368.2/2 = -184.1

We take x = 0.1 (since x is near D at x=0).

Now, E = (0.1,16), C = (107,16)

We want length CE:
 CE = |107 - 0.1| = 106.9

Since the problem likely expects an integer, CE ≈ 107.

Final answer is 107.

### thinking by Debate Agent WOLT:
We have two rectangles ABCD and EFGH. Given that D, E, C, F are collinear and A, D, H, G lie on a circle. The side lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107 for rectangle ABCD, and FG = 17, EF = 184 for rectangle EFGH. We want to find CE.

Step 1: Identify the sides of the rectangles.
- Rectangle ABCD has sides AB = 107 and BC = 16.
- Rectangle EFGH has sides EF = 184 and FG = 17.

Step 2: Since ABCD is a rectangle, AB is parallel and equal to DC, and BC is parallel and equal to AD.
Similarly for EFGH.

Step 3: Points D, E, C, F are collinear.
- So points D and C are on ABCD, E and F on EFGH.

Step 4: Points A, D, H, G lie on a circle.
- This implies that quadrilateral ADHG is cyclic.

Step 5: We want CE. Since D, E, C, F are collinear, and rectangles are involved, we can try to find coordinates for the points to find CE.

Step 6: Assign coordinates.
- Place rectangle ABCD with A at origin (0,0), B at (107,0), C at (107,16), D at (0,16).

Step 7: Since D, E, C, F are collinear, and D is at (0,16), C at (107,16), the line D-C is horizontal at y=16.
- So points E and F lie on the line y=16.

Step 8: Rectangle EFGH has EF = 184 and FG = 17.
- EF is horizontal (since E and F are on y=16), so E at (x,16), F at (x+184,16).

Step 9: Since EFGH is a rectangle, FG is vertical.
- So G is at (x+184,16-17) = (x+184,-1).
- H is at (x, -1).

Step 10: A, D, H, G lie on a circle.
- Points: A(0,0), D(0,16), H(x,-1), G(x+184,-1).

Step 11: The points A, D, H, G are cyclic.
- Use the property that the points lie on the same circle.

Step 12: The four points lie on the same circle if the distance from the center to each point is the same.
- Let center = (h,k), radius = r.

Step 13: Write equations for the distances:
  (h - 0)^2 + (k - 0)^2 = r^2
  (h - 0)^2 + (k - 16)^2 = r^2
  (h - x)^2 + (k + 1)^2 = r^2
  (h - (x+184))^2 + (k + 1)^2 = r^2

Step 14: From first two equations:
  h^2 + k^2 = h^2 + (k - 16)^2
  k^2 = (k - 16)^2
  k^2 = k^2 - 32k + 256
  0 = -32k + 256
  32k = 256
  k = 8

Step 15: So k = 8.

Step 16: Using the first and third equations:
  h^2 + 8^2 = (h - x)^2 + (8 + 1)^2
  h^2 + 64 = (h - x)^2 + 81

Step 17: Expand and simplify:
  h^2 + 64 = h^2 - 2hx + x^2 + 81
  64 = -2hx + x^2 + 81
  -2hx = 64 - 81 - x^2
  -2hx = -17 - x^2
  2hx = 17 + x^2

Step 18: Using the third and fourth equations:
  (h - x)^2 + 81 = (h - (x+184))^2 + 81
  (h - x)^2 = (h - x - 184)^2

Step 19: Expand:
  (h - x)^2 = (h - x - 184)^2
  h^2 - 2hx + x^2 = h^2 - 2h(x + 184) + (x + 184)^2

Step 20: Simplify:
  h^2 - 2hx + x^2 = h^2 - 2hx - 368h + x^2 + 368x + 184^2

Step 21: Cancel h^2 and x^2:
  -2hx = -2hx - 368h + 368x + 33856

Step 22: Cancel -2hx from both sides:
  0 = -368h + 368x + 33856

Step 23: Rearrange:
  368h = 368x + 33856
  h = x + 92

Step 24: Recall from step 17:
  2hx = 17 + x^2
  Substitute h = x + 92:
  2(x + 92)x = 17 + x^2
  2x^2 + 184x = 17 + x^2

Step 25: Simplify:
  2x^2 + 184x - 17 - x^2 = 0
  x^2 + 184x - 17 = 0

Step 26: Solve quadratic equation:
  x^2 + 184x - 17 = 0

Step 27: Use quadratic formula:
  x = [-184 ± sqrt(184^2 - 4*1*(-17))]/2
  = [-184 ± sqrt(33856 + 68)]/2
  = [-184 ± sqrt(33924)]/2

Step 28: sqrt(33924) ≈ 184.22

Step 29: Solutions:
  x1 = (-184 + 184.22)/2 ≈ 0.22/2 = 0.11
  x2 = (-184 - 184.22)/2 ≈ -368.22/2 = -184.11

Step 30: Since E lies between D(0,16) and F(x+184,16), x ≈ 0.11 is reasonable.

Step 31: Coordinates:
  E = (0.11, 16)
  C = (107, 16)

Step 32: Length CE = |107 - 0.11| = 106.89

Step 33: Since the problem likely expects an integer, round to 107.

    <pre>We have two rectangles ABCD and EFGH with given side lengths. Points D, E, C, F are collinear, and points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. By placing ABCD on the coordinate plane with A at (0,0), B at (107,0), C at (107,16), and D at (0,16), the line through D and C is y=16. Since D, E, C, F are collinear, E and F lie on y=16. Let E = (x,16), then F = (x+184,16) because EF=184. Since EFGH is a rectangle and FG=17, FG is vertical, so G = (x+184, -1) and H = (x, -1). Points A(0,0), D(0,16), H(x,-1), and G(x+184,-1) lie on a circle. Using the circle condition, we find the center y-coordinate k=8, and relate h and x to satisfy the circle equation. Solving the resulting quadratic equation for x gives two solutions, and the reasonable one is approximately x=0.1. The length CE is then |107 - 0.1| = 106.9, which rounds to 107. Therefore, the length CE is 107.
