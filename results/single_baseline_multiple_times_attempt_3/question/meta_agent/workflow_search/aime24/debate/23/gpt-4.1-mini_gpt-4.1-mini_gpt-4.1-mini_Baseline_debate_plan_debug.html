    <pre>Find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid so that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is $999$, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is $99$. The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$.
\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 8 \\ \hline 9 &amp; 9 &amp; 1 \\ \hline \end{array}\]

### thinking by Debate Agent LSrh:
Let&#39;s denote the digits in the 2x3 grid as:

| a | b | c |
| d | e | f |

Each cell contains a digit from 0 to 9.

1. The sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is 999.
   That is, the two numbers are abc and def (each three-digit numbers), and abc + def = 999.

2. The sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99.
   That is, the three numbers are ad, be, cf (each two-digit numbers), and ad + be + cf = 99.

We need to find the number of ways to assign digits a,b,c,d,e,f (each 0-9) satisfying these conditions.

Step 1: From the first condition:
abc + def = 999
=&gt; 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999
=&gt; 100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999

Since 999 = 9*100 + 9*10 + 9,
we have:
100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 100*9 + 10*9 + 9

So,
a + d = 9
b + e = 9
c + f = 9

Step 2: From the second condition:
ad + be + cf = 99

Note that ad, be, cf are two-digit numbers formed by the digits in the columns.
So:
ad = 10a + d
be = 10b + e
cf = 10c + f

Sum:
(10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99
=&gt; 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99

Step 3: Using the relations from step 1:
We know:\na + d = 9
b + e = 9
c + f = 9

Sum these three:
(a + d) + (b + e) + (c + f) = 9 + 9 + 9 = 27

So,
(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 27

Step 4: Substitute (d + e + f) = 27 - (a + b + c) into the sum from step 2:

10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99
=&gt; 10(a + b + c) + 27 - (a + b + c) = 99
=&gt; 9(a + b + c) + 27 = 99
=&gt; 9(a + b + c) = 72
=&gt; a + b + c = 8

Step 5: From step 3:
(d + e + f) = 27 - 8 = 19

Step 6: Recall from step 1:
 a + d = 9
 b + e = 9
 c + f = 9

So,
 d = 9 - a
 e = 9 - b
 f = 9 - c

Sum d + e + f = 19
=&gt; (9 - a) + (9 - b) + (9 - c) = 19
=&gt; 27 - (a + b + c) = 19
=&gt; a + b + c = 8 (which matches step 4)

Step 7: So the problem reduces to finding the number of triples (a,b,c) such that:
- a,b,c are digits 0-9
- a + b + c = 8
- For each digit, d = 9 - a, e = 9 - b, f = 9 - c (also digits 0-9, automatically satisfied since a,b,c ≤ 9)

Step 8: But note that the numbers abc and def are three-digit numbers formed left to right.
Usually, a and d should not be zero to be three-digit numbers.
Similarly, for the numbers ad, be, cf (two-digit numbers), a,b,c,d,e,f should be digits 0-9, but the leading digit shouldn&#39;t be zero.

Check leading digit constraints:
- abc is three-digit number, so a ≠ 0
- def is three-digit number, so d ≠ 0
- ad is two-digit number, so a ≠ 0
- be is two-digit number, so b ≠ 0
- cf is two-digit number, so c ≠ 0

From a + d = 9, and d = 9 - a
If a ≠ 0, then d = 9 - a
Similarly, d ≠ 0 =&gt; 9 - a ≠ 0 =&gt; a ≠ 9
So a ∈ {1,2,...,8}

Similarly, b ≠ 0 and b ≠ 9
c ≠ 0 and c ≠ 9

Step 9: So a,b,c ∈ {1,...,8} and a + b + c = 8

Step 10: Count the number of triples (a,b,c) with a,b,c ∈ {1,...,8} and a + b + c = 8

Since a,b,c ≥ 1, define new variables:
a&#39; = a - 1 ≥ 0
b&#39; = b - 1 ≥ 0
c&#39; = c - 1 ≥ 0

Then:
a&#39; + b&#39; + c&#39; = 8 - 3 = 5

Now a&#39;,b&#39;,c&#39; ≥ 0 and ≤ 7 (since a ≤ 8 =&gt; a&#39; ≤ 7)

Count the number of non-negative integer solutions to a&#39; + b&#39; + c&#39; = 5 with each ≤ 7.
Since 5 ≤ 7, the upper bound doesn&#39;t restrict the count.

Number of solutions is C(5+3-1,3-1) = C(7,2) = 21

Step 11: For each such triple (a,b,c), we get d = 9 - a, e = 9 - b, f = 9 - c
Since a,b,c ∈ {1,...,8}, d,e,f ∈ {1,...,8}

So all digits satisfy the leading digit constraints.

Step 12: Therefore, the number of ways is 21.

Check example given:
Example grid:
0 0 8
9 9 1

Sum left to right:
008 + 991 = 999
Sum top to bottom:
09 + 09 + 81 = 99

But in example, a=0, b=0, c=8, which contradicts our leading digit condition a ≠ 0.

But in the problem, the example has a=0 and d=9, so abc=008 (which is 8), def=991, sum=999.

So the problem allows leading zeros in the three-digit numbers.

Similarly for two-digit numbers, leading zeros allowed (09 is 9).

Therefore, leading zeros are allowed.

Step 13: So a,b,c,d,e,f ∈ {0,...,9} with a + d = 9, b + e = 9, c + f = 9
And a + b + c = 8

No restriction on a,b,c being nonzero.

Step 14: Count number of triples (a,b,c) with a,b,c ∈ {0,...,9}, a + b + c = 8

Number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c = 8 is C(8+3-1,3-1) = C(10,2) = 45

Step 15: For each triple (a,b,c), define d=9 - a, e=9 - b, f=9 - c
Since a,b,c ≤ 9, d,e,f ≥ 0
Also, since a,b,c ≤ 8 (because sum is 8), a,b,c ≤ 8
So d,e,f ≥ 1

Wait, if a,b,c ≤ 8, then d,e,f = 9 - a,b,c ≥ 1
But a,b,c can be 0, so d,e,f ≤ 9

Therefore, digits are valid.

Step 16: So total number of ways is 45.

Step 17: Confirm with example: a=0,b=0,c=8 satisfies a+b+c=8
Then d=9-0=9,e=9-0=9,f=9-8=1
Matches example.

Therefore, the answer is 45 ways.


### thinking by Debate Agent lE8H:
Let the grid be:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
 a &amp; b &amp; c \\
\hline
 d &amp; e &amp; f \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]
where each letter is a digit (0-9).

From the problem:
1) The sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right (i.e., the two rows) is 999:
   (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999

2) The sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom (i.e., the three columns) is 99:
   (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99

Rewrite the equations:
Equation 1:
100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999
Equation 2:
(10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99

Simplify Equation 2:
10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99
Group terms:
10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99

Let S1 = a + b + c and S2 = d + e + f
Then:
10S1 + S2 = 99

From Equation 1:
100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999
Group terms:
100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999

Let A = a + d, B = b + e, C = c + f
Then:
100A + 10B + C = 999

Since digits are 0 to 9, A, B, C can range from 0 to 18 (sum of two digits)

Now, 999 in base 10 is 9*100 + 9*10 + 9 = 999
So 100A + 10B + C = 999 means A=9, B=9, C=9

So:
A = a + d = 9
B = b + e = 9
C = c + f = 9

Recall from earlier:
10S1 + S2 = 99

But S1 = a + b + c
S2 = d + e + f
So:
10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99

Since a + d = 9, b + e = 9, c + f = 9,
Add these three:
(a + d) + (b + e) + (c + f) = 9 + 9 + 9 = 27
But (a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 27
So S1 + S2 = 27

From 10S1 + S2 = 99 and S1 + S2 = 27, solve for S1 and S2:
From S1 + S2 = 27 =&gt; S2 = 27 - S1
Substitute into 10S1 + S2 = 99:
10S1 + (27 - S1) = 99
9S1 + 27 = 99
9S1 = 72
S1 = 8
Then S2 = 27 - 8 = 19

So:
a + b + c = 8
d + e + f = 19

Recall:
a + d = 9
b + e = 9
c + f = 9

We want to find the number of digit assignments (a,b,c,d,e,f) with digits 0-9 satisfying:
- a + d = 9
- b + e = 9
- c + f = 9
- a + b + c = 8
- d + e + f = 19

From a + d = 9 =&gt; d = 9 - a
Similarly e = 9 - b, f = 9 - c
Substitute into d + e + f = 19:
(9 - a) + (9 - b) + (9 - c) = 19
27 - (a + b + c) = 19
27 - 8 = 19 (checks out)

So the only constraints are:
a,b,c in 0..9, d = 9 - a, e = 9 - b, f = 9 - c
and a + b + c = 8

We need to count the number of triples (a,b,c) with digits 0-9 summing to 8.

Number of nonnegative integer solutions to a + b + c = 8 with 0 ≤ a,b,c ≤ 9 is the number of integer solutions to a+b+c=8.
Since 8 ≤ 9, no upper bound restriction is violated.

Number of solutions = C(8+3-1,3-1) = C(10,2) = 45

For each such triple (a,b,c), d,e,f are uniquely determined as 9 - a, 9 - b, 9 - c, which are digits (since a,b,c ≤ 9).

Therefore, total number of ways = 45.

    <pre>Let the digits in the 2x3 grid be:
| a | b | c |
| d | e | f |
Each digit is from 0 to 9.

From the problem:
1) The sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right (the two rows) is 999:
   (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999
2) The sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom (the three columns) is 99:
   (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99

Rewrite the equations:
Equation 1:
100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999
Equation 2:
10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99

Group terms:
Equation 1:
100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999
Equation 2:
10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99

Let A = a + d, B = b + e, C = c + f
Then from Equation 1:
100A + 10B + C = 999
Since 999 = 9*100 + 9*10 + 9, we get:
A = 9, B = 9, C = 9

From Equation 2:
10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99

Also, sum of A, B, C:
A + B + C = (a + d) + (b + e) + (c + f) = (a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 9 + 9 + 9 = 27

Let S1 = a + b + c, S2 = d + e + f
Then:
S1 + S2 = 27
and
10S1 + S2 = 99

Subtracting the first from the second:
(10S1 + S2) - (S1 + S2) = 99 - 27
9S1 = 72
S1 = 8
Then S2 = 27 - 8 = 19

From A = a + d = 9, we get d = 9 - a
Similarly, e = 9 - b, f = 9 - c

Since a,b,c,d,e,f are digits 0-9, and a,b,c sum to 8, and d,e,f sum to 19, with d,e,f defined as above, all digits are valid.

Therefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of triples (a,b,c) with digits 0-9 such that a + b + c = 8.

Number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c = 8 is C(8+3-1,3-1) = C(10,2) = 45.

For each such triple, d,e,f are uniquely determined and valid.

Hence, the total number of ways to fill the grid is 45.
