Question: Find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid so that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is $999$, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is $99$. The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$.
\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\ \hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\ \hline \end{array}\]

proposed answer: Let the digits in the 2x3 grid be:
| a | b | c |
| d | e | f |
Each digit is from 0 to 9.

From the problem:
1) The sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right (the two rows) is 999:
   (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999
2) The sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom (the three columns) is 99:
   (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99

Rewrite the equations:
Equation 1:
100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999
Equation 2:
10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99

Group terms:
Equation 1:
100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999
Equation 2:
10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99

Let A = a + d, B = b + e, C = c + f
Then from Equation 1:
100A + 10B + C = 999
Since 999 = 9*100 + 9*10 + 9, we get:
A = 9, B = 9, C = 9

From Equation 2:
10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99

Also, sum of A, B, C:
A + B + C = (a + d) + (b + e) + (c + f) = (a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 9 + 9 + 9 = 27

Let S1 = a + b + c, S2 = d + e + f
Then:
S1 + S2 = 27
and
10S1 + S2 = 99

Subtracting the first from the second:
(10S1 + S2) - (S1 + S2) = 99 - 27
9S1 = 72
S1 = 8
Then S2 = 27 - 8 = 19

From A = a + d = 9, we get d = 9 - a
Similarly, e = 9 - b, f = 9 - c

Since a,b,c,d,e,f are digits 0-9, and a,b,c sum to 8, and d,e,f sum to 19, with d,e,f defined as above, all digits are valid.

Therefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of triples (a,b,c) with digits 0-9 such that a + b + c = 8.

Number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c = 8 is C(8+3-1,3-1) = C(10,2) = 45.

For each such triple, d,e,f are uniquely determined and valid.

Hence, the total number of ways to fill the grid is 45.
