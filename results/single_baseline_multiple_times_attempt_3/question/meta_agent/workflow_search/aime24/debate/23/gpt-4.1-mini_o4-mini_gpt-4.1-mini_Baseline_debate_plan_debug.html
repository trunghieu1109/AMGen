    <pre>Find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid so that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is $999$, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is $99$. The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$.
\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 8 \\ \hline 9 &amp; 9 &amp; 1 \\ \hline \end{array}\]

Label the grid entries as
 a b c
 d e f
Reading rows gives 100(a+d)+10(b+e)+(c+f)=999 ⇒ a+d=b+e=c+f=9. Reading columns gives 10(a+b+c)+(d+e+f)=99. But (d+e+f)=(a+d)+(b+e)+(c+f)−(a+b+c)=27−(a+b+c), so 10S+(27−S)=99 ⇒ 9S=72 ⇒ S=a+b+c=8. Once (a,b,c) is any nonnegative solution to a+b+c=8 (with each ≤9 automatically), we set d=9−a, e=9−b, f=9−c, which lie in 0..9. The number of nonnegative solutions to a+b+c=8 is C(8+3−1,3−1)=C(10,2)=45.

### thinking by Debate Agent 1aQo:
We need digits a,b,c,d,e,f (0–9) in a 2×3 grid so that the two 3-digit row-sums equal 999 and the three 2-digit column-sums equal 99.  Writing abc + def = 999 and ad + be + cf = 99, one finds by analyzing carries that a+d=9, b+e=9, c+f=9 and additionally a+b+c=8.  Thus (a,b,c) is any nonnegative triple summing to 8 (each ≤8&lt;9) and then d,e,f are forced as 9−a,9−b,9−c.  The number of nonnegative solutions to a+b+c=8 is C(8+3−1,2)=C(10,2)=45.

Reading the rows gives the two 3-digit numbers abc and def; their sum is 999. That forces a+d=9, b+e=9, c+f=9. Reading the columns gives the three 2-digit numbers ad, be, cf; their sum is 99. Writing that sum as 10(a+b+c)+(d+e+f)=99 and substituting d+e+f=(9−a)+(9−b)+(9−c)=27−(a+b+c) yields
10S+(27−S)=99 ⇒9S=72 ⇒S=a+b+c=8.
Thus (a,b,c) is any nonnegative triple summing to 8, and then (d,e,f)=(9−a,9−b,9−c) are valid digits 0–9. The number of nonnegative solutions to a+b+c=8 is C(8+3−1,2)=C(10,2)=45.
