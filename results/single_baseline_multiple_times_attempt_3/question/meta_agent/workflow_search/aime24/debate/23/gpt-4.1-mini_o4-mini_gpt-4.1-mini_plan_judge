Question: Find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid so that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is $999$, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is $99$. The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$.
\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\ \hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\ \hline \end{array}\]
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: Label the grid entries as
a b c
d e f
Reading the rows gives the two 3-digit numbers abc and def; their sum is 999. That forces a+d=9, b+e=9, c+f=9. Reading the columns gives the three 2-digit numbers ad, be, cf; their sum is 99. Writing that sum as 10(a+b+c)+(d+e+f)=99 and substituting d+e+f=(9−a)+(9−b)+(9−c)=27−(a+b+c) yields
10S+(27−S)=99 ⇒9S=72 ⇒S=a+b+c=8.
Thus (a,b,c) is any nonnegative triple summing to 8, and then (d,e,f)=(9−a,9−b,9−c) are valid digits 0–9. The number of nonnegative solutions to a+b+c=8 is C(8+3−1,2)=C(10,2)=45.
