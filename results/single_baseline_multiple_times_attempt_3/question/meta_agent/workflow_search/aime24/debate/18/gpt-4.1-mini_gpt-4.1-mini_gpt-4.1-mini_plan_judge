Question: Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). Then \(OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\).

proposed answer: The problem involves finding a unique point C on segment AB such that C does not lie on any other unit segment PQ with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis in the first quadrant, except for AB itself. Parameterizing AB and the family F of segments PQ, we set up equations to determine when C lies on such a segment. By analyzing these equations, we find that the unique point C corresponds to a parameter t = 3/4 on AB. Calculating the coordinates of C and then OC^2 yields OC^2 = 7/16. Since 7 and 16 are coprime, p=7 and q=16, so p+q=23.
