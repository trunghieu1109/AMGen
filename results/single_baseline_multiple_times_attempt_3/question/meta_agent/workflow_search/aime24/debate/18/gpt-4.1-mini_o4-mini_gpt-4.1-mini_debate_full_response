Question: Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). Then \(OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\).\Pattern: debate
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Final Decision Agent hEyA', content='We seek C on AB so that the only unit‐length segment from the axes passing through C is AB itself.  Parameterize a general segment PQ of length 1 with P=(a,0), Q=(0,b), a²+b²=1.  A point (x,y) lies on PQ iff x/a+y/b=1.  Restricting (x,y) to lie on AB and requiring there be only one real solution for (a,b) forces a double‐root condition when the slope equals that of AB.  Solving these equations yields C=(1/8,3√3/8).  Then OC²=(1/8)²+(3√3/8)²=1/64+27/64=28/64=7/16, so p+q=7+16=23.\n\nAnswer:23', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.

Points on AB have coordinates (x,y)=((1−u)/2, u√3/2). Substituting gives equation f(θ)=(1−u) sinθ + u√3 cosθ − sin2θ=0, which always has θ=π/3 as a root. To ensure it has no other root in (0,π/2), θ=π/3 must be a double root: f′(π/3)=0 ⇒ u=3/4. Then C has coordinates (1/8,3√3/8), so OC^2=(1/8)^2+(3√3/8)^2=1/64+27/64=28/64=7/16. Thus p+q=7+16=23.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent tsiJ:\nWe need the unique point C on segment AB (from A=(1/2,0) to B=(0,√3/2)) so that the only unit‐length segment with endpoints on the axes passing through C is AB itself.  A line through a point C=(x₀,y₀) that meets the axes at (α,0) and (0,β) has length √(α²+β²)=1 exactly when x₀ and y₀ satisfy a certain quartic in the slope m.  Requiring that the only real solution for m be the slope of AB (m=–√3) forces that quartic and its derivative both vanish at m=–√3.  Imposing those two conditions plus that C lie on AB (y₀=–√3 x₀+√3/2) yields x₀=1/8, y₀=3√3/8.  Hence OC²=x₀²+y₀²=1/64+27/64=28/64=7/16, so p+q=7+16=23.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 6t7M:\n23\n\n### answer by Debate Agent tsiJ:\n23\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
