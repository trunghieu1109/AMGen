Question: Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). Then \(OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\).

proposed answer: To solve the problem, we need to find the unique point C on the segment AB that does not belong to any segment PQ of unit length, except for the segment AB itself. The segment AB is parameterized as C(t) = ((1-t)/2, t*sqrt(3)/2) for 0 <= t <= 1. For C(t) to lie on a segment PQ, there must exist x and y such that x^2 + y^2 = 1 and ((1-t)/2)^2 + (t*sqrt(3)/2)^2 = x^2 + y^2. Solving ((1-t)^2 + 3t^2)/4 = 1 gives us 4t^2 - 2t - 3 = 0. Solving this quadratic equation, we find t = (3/4) and t = -1 (discarding the negative value as it is outside the range). Thus, C(3/4) is the point we are looking for. Substituting t = 3/4 into the parametric equation gives C(3/4) = (1/8, 3sqrt(3)/8). Now, we find OC^2 = (1/8)^2 + (3sqrt(3)/8)^2. This simplifies to OC^2 = 1/64 + 27/64 = 28/64 = 7/16. Hence, OC^2 = 7/16, where p = 7 and q = 16. Therefore, p + q = 23.
