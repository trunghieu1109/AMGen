    <pre>Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). Then \(OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\).

### thinking by Debate Agent Oyin:
To solve this problem, we need to find the unique point C on the segment AB that does not belong to any segment PQ of unit length, except for the segment AB itself. We start by parametrizing the line segment AB. Since A = (1/2, 0) and B = (0, sqrt(3)/2), the line segment AB can be parametrized as C(t) = ((1-t)/2, t*sqrt(3)/2) for 0 &lt;= t &lt;= 1. We need to ensure that the point C(t) does not belong to any unit length segment PQ, where P is on the x-axis and Q is on the y-axis. The coordinates of P and Q can be given by P = (x, 0) and Q = (0, y) such that the distance between P and Q is 1, i.e., sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = 1. This implies x^2 + y^2 = 1. The point C(t) must satisfy the condition that it lies on the line segment AB and not on any other line segment PQ of unit length. For C(t) = ((1-t)/2, t*sqrt(3)/2) to lie on a segment PQ, there must exist x and y such that x^2 + y^2 = 1 and ((1-t)/2)^2 + (t*sqrt(3)/2)^2 = x^2 + y^2. By simplifying, we find that ((1-t)^2 + 3t^2)/4 = 1. Solving this equation will give us the value of t for which C(t) does not lie on any other segment except AB. Solving ((1-t)^2 + 3t^2)/4 = 1 gives us 1 - 2t + t^2 + 3t^2 = 4, leading to 4t^2 - 2t - 3 = 0. Solving this quadratic equation, we find t = (3/4) and t = -1 (discarding the negative value as it is outside the range). Thus, C(3/4) is the point we are looking for. Substituting t = 3/4 into the parametric equation gives C(3/4) = (1/8, 3sqrt(3)/8). Now, we find OC^2 = (1/8)^2 + (3sqrt(3)/8)^2. This simplifies to OC^2 = 1/64 + 27/64 = 28/64 = 7/16. Hence, OC^2 = 7/16, where p = 7 and q = 16. Therefore, p + q = 23.

### thinking by Debate Agent kRuo:
To solve this problem, we first need to understand the setup. The segment \( \overline{AB} \) has endpoints \( A = \left( \frac{1}{2}, 0 \right) \) and \( B = \left( 0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \right) \). The line segment \( \overline{AB} \) can be parameterized as \( C(t) = \left( \frac{1-t}{2}, \frac{t \sqrt{3}}{2} \right) \) for \( t \in [0, 1] \). We need to find a point \( C \) on \( \overline{AB} \) such that it does not lie on any segment \( \overline{PQ} \) from the family \( \mathcal{F} \) except \( \overline{AB} \) itself. A segment \( \overline{PQ} \) is defined by \( P = (x, 0) \) and \( Q = (0, y) \) with \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \). The condition for \( C(t) \) to lie on \( \overline{PQ} \) is that \( \frac{1-t}{2} + \frac{t \sqrt{3}}{2} = 1 \). Solving this equation gives \( \frac{1-t}{2} = \frac{t \sqrt{3}}{2} \), leading to \( 1-t = t \sqrt{3} \), or \( t(1+\sqrt{3}) = 1 \). Thus, \( t = \frac{1}{1+\sqrt{3}} \). Rationalizing gives \( t = \frac{\sqrt{3}-1}{2} \). Substituting \( t \) back into \( C(t) \), we find \( C = \left( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}, \frac{3-\sqrt{3}}{4} \right) \). The distance \( OC \) is \( \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{3-\sqrt{3}}{4} \right)^2 } \). Simplifying, \( OC^2 = \frac{3}{16} + \frac{9 - 6\sqrt{3} + 3}{16} = \frac{12 - 6\sqrt{3}}{16} = \frac{6 - 3\sqrt{3}}{8} \). Further simplification gives \( OC^2 = \frac{6 - 3\sqrt{3}}{8} = \frac{(6 - 3\sqrt{3})(6 + 3\sqrt{3})}{8(6 + 3\sqrt{3})} = \frac{36 - 27}{48} = \frac{9}{48} = \frac{3}{16} \). Thus, \( p = 3 \) and \( q = 16 \), so \( p + q = 3 + 16 = 19 \).
