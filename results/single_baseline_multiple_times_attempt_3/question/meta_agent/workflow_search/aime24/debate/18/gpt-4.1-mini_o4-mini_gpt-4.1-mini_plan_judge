Question: Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). Then \(OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\).

proposed answer: We seek C on AB so that the only unit‐length segment from the axes passing through C is AB itself.  Parameterize a general segment PQ of length 1 with P=(a,0), Q=(0,b), a²+b²=1.  A point (x,y) lies on PQ iff x/a+y/b=1.  Restricting (x,y) to lie on AB and requiring there be only one real solution for (a,b) forces a double‐root condition when the slope equals that of AB.  Solving these equations yields C=(1/8,3√3/8).  Then OC²=(1/8)²+(3√3/8)²=1/64+27/64=28/64=7/16, so p+q=7+16=23.
