Question: Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The problem involves points on the hyperbola \( \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \) forming a rhombus \(ABCD\) with diagonals intersecting at the origin. Since the diagonals bisect each other, the points satisfy \( A = -C \) and \( B = -D \). The points \(A=(x_1,y_1)\) and \(B=(x_2,y_2)\) lie on the hyperbola, so \( \frac{x_1^2}{20} - \frac{y_1^2}{24} = 1 \) and \( \frac{x_2^2}{20} - \frac{y_2^2}{24} = 1 \). The rhombus condition requires all sides equal, which leads to an equation relating \( (x_1,y_1) \) and \( (x_2,y_2) \). Using the parametric form \( x = \sqrt{20} \cosh t, y = \sqrt{24} \sinh t \), the side equality condition can be expressed in terms of \( t_1 \) and \( t_2 \). The diagonal \( BD \) length squared is \( BD^2 = 4(x_2^2 + y_2^2) = 4(20 \cosh^2 t_2 + 24 \sinh^2 t_2) = 4(20 + 44 \sinh^2 t_2) \). Maximizing \( BD^2 \) under the rhombus condition yields the supremum value. The two different analyses gave 64 and 104 as maximum values, but the more detailed parametric and algebraic approach suggests the maximum \( BD^2 \) is 104. Therefore, the greatest real number less than \( BD^2 \) for all such rhombi is 103.
