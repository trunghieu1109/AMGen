Question: Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.

proposed answer: The problem involves finding the greatest real number less than BD^2 for a rhombus inscribed in a hyperbola with diagonals intersecting at the origin. The hyperbola is given by \( \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \). The diagonals of the rhombus are perpendicular and intersect at the origin, meaning the vertices are symmetric about the origin. Let the vertices be A = (x_1, y_1), B = (x_2, y_2), C = (-x_1, -y_1), D = (-x_2, -y_2). The condition for the points to lie on the hyperbola gives \( \frac{x_1^2}{20} - \frac{y_1^2}{24} = 1 \) and \( \frac{x_2^2}{20} - \frac{y_2^2}{24} = 1 \). The diagonals are perpendicular, so \( x_1x_2 + y_1y_2 = 0 \). We need to maximize BD^2 = 4(x_2^2 + y_2^2). Solving the constraint \( \frac{x_2^2}{20} - \frac{y_2^2}{24} = 1 \) for x_2^2 gives \( x_2^2 = 20 + \frac{20}{24}y_2^2 \). Substituting into x_2^2 + y_2^2 gives \( 20 + \frac{44}{24}y_2^2 \). To maximize x_2^2 + y_2^2, y_2^2 should be minimized, ideally y_2^2 = 0, giving x_2^2 = 20. Thus, x_2^2 + y_2^2 = 20, and BD^2 = 4 * 20 = 80. The greatest real number less than 80 is 79.
