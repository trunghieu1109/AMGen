    <pre>Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.

### thinking by Debate Agent z0Wv:
We seek all rhombi ABCD with vertices on the hyperbola x^2/20–y^2/24=1 whose diagonals meet at O.  Label the vertices so that A+C=0 and B+D=0, so A=(x1,y1), C=–A, B=(x2,y2), D=–B.  Then AB=BC gives |A–B|^2=|B–C|^2 ⇒ x1x2+y1y2=0, so A·B=0.  Thus A lies at an intersection of the hyperbola with the line through O perpendicular to OB.  Parametrizing that line by A=s(–y2,x2) and substituting in the hyperbola yields s^2·(y2^2/20–x2^2/24)=1.  But from B∈hyperbola, x2^2/20–y2^2/24=1 ⇒ y2^2/20–x2^2/24=(11x2^2–720)/600.  Hence real solutions exist iff 11x2^2–720&gt;0 ⇔ x2^2&gt;720/11.  In that case A is real and one obtains a rhombus.  Meanwhile BD^2=4(x2^2+y2^2)=4(2.2x2^2–24)=8.8x2^2–96.  As x2^2→720/11 from above, BD^2→8.8·(720/11)–96=576–96=480, and BD^2&gt;480 for every rhombus.  Hence the greatest real number strictly less than every BD^2 is 480.

### thinking by Debate Agent GJ66:
We note that in any such rhombus with vertices A=(x1,y1), B=(x2,y2), C=(-x1,-y1), D=(-x2,-y2), the diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin and are perpendicular, giving x1 x2 + y1 y2 = 0. Points A and B lie on the hyperbola x^2/20 - y^2/24 = 1. For a given B=(x,y) on the hyperbola with y≠0, the perpendicular line through the origin intersects the hyperbola in real points A,C iff the discriminant is nonnegative, leading to x^2 &gt; 720/11. Then BD^2 = 4(x^2+y^2) = (44/5)x^2 -96, which is strictly greater than (44/5)*(720/11) -96 = 480. As x^2→720/11+, BD^2→480+, so the infimum of BD^2 is 480, and BD^2 &gt; 480 for all such rhombi. The greatest real number less than every BD^2 is therefore 480.

    <pre>Label the vertices so that A=(x1,y1),C=–A and B=(x2,y2),D=–B lie on x^2/20−y^2/24=1 and ABCD is a rhombus with diagonals crossing at the origin. The rhombus condition AB=BC implies A·B=0, so A lies on the line through O perpendicular to OB. Substituting A=s(−y2,x2) into the hyperbola and using B’s equation leads to the requirement x2^2&gt;720/11 for A to be real. Then BD^2=4(x2^2+y2^2)=(44/5)x2^2−96, and as x2^2→720/11+, BD^2→(44/5)(720/11)−96=480. Thus BD^2&gt;480 for all such rhombi, and the greatest real number less than every BD^2 is 480.
