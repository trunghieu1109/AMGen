    <pre>Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.

### thinking by Debate Agent ZElq:
To solve this problem, we need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD^2 for all rhombuses ABCD where the diagonals intersect at the origin. The equation of the hyperbola is given by \( \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \). The diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin, so they are perpendicular bisectors of each other. Let the vertices of the rhombus be A, B, C, D such that the diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin. Assume A = (x_1, y_1), B = (x_2, y_2), C = (-x_1, -y_1), D = (-x_2, -y_2). The condition that A and C are on the hyperbola gives \( \frac{x_1^2}{20} - \frac{y_1^2}{24} = 1 \) and \( \frac{x_2^2}{20} - \frac{y_2^2}{24} = 1 \). The diagonals are perpendicular, so \( x_1x_2 + y_1y_2 = 0 \). We need to find the maximum possible value of BD^2 = 4(x_2^2 + y_2^2). We can use Lagrange multipliers or other optimization techniques to find this maximum, but first, note that the hyperbola&#39;s asymptotes are \( y = \pm \sqrt{\frac{24}{20}}x \). The points on the hyperbola that maximize the distance from the origin lie on the conjugate axis, where \( x = 0 \). Substituting into the hyperbola equation yields \( -\frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \), which is not possible, so we consider the transverse axis, where \( y = 0 \). Substituting into the equation gives \( \frac{x^2}{20} = 1 \) or \( x^2 = 20 \). Therefore, the points (\( \sqrt{20}, 0 \)) and (\( -\sqrt{20}, 0 \)) lie on the hyperbola. For these points, BD^2 = 4(20) = 80. However, we seek the greatest real number less than BD^2, which is 80. Therefore, the answer is 79.

### thinking by Debate Agent RqoH:
The hyperbola given is \( \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \). The diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin, meaning the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. The diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular bisectors of each other. Let \( A = (x_1, y_1) \), \( B = (x_2, y_2) \), \( C = (-x_1, -y_1) \), and \( D = (-x_2, -y_2) \). The diagonals \( AC \) and \( BD \) are perpendicular, and their intersection at the origin implies symmetry. The length of diagonal \( AC \) is \( 2\sqrt{x_1^2 + y_1^2} \) and the length of diagonal \( BD \) is \( 2\sqrt{x_2^2 + y_2^2} \). Since \( A \) and \( C \) are on the hyperbola, \( \frac{x_1^2}{20} - \frac{y_1^2}{24} = 1 \) and similarly for \( B \) and \( D \), \( \frac{x_2^2}{20} - \frac{y_2^2}{24} = 1 \). We need to maximize \( BD^2 = 4(x_2^2 + y_2^2) \). Using the constraint \( \frac{x_2^2}{20} - \frac{y_2^2}{24} = 1 \), we express \( x_2^2 \) in terms of \( y_2^2 \) and substitute back to find the maximum of \( x_2^2 + y_2^2 \). Solving the constraint equation for \( x_2^2 \) gives \( x_2^2 = 20 + \frac{20}{24}y_2^2 \). Substituting in \( x_2^2 + y_2^2 \) gives \( 20 + \frac{44}{24}y_2^2 \). To maximize this, note that \( y_2^2 \) must be minimized. Since \( y_2^2 \) is positive, the smallest value is 0, giving \( x_2^2 = 20 \). Therefore, \( x_2^2 + y_2^2 = 20 \) is the maximum, and thus \( BD^2 = 4 \times 20 = 80 \).

    <pre>The problem involves finding the greatest real number less than BD^2 for a rhombus inscribed in a hyperbola with diagonals intersecting at the origin. The hyperbola is given by \( \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \). The diagonals of the rhombus are perpendicular and intersect at the origin, meaning the vertices are symmetric about the origin. Let the vertices be A = (x_1, y_1), B = (x_2, y_2), C = (-x_1, -y_1), D = (-x_2, -y_2). The condition for the points to lie on the hyperbola gives \( \frac{x_1^2}{20} - \frac{y_1^2}{24} = 1 \) and \( \frac{x_2^2}{20} - \frac{y_2^2}{24} = 1 \). The diagonals are perpendicular, so \( x_1x_2 + y_1y_2 = 0 \). We need to maximize BD^2 = 4(x_2^2 + y_2^2). Solving the constraint \( \frac{x_2^2}{20} - \frac{y_2^2}{24} = 1 \) for x_2^2 gives \( x_2^2 = 20 + \frac{20}{24}y_2^2 \). Substituting into x_2^2 + y_2^2 gives \( 20 + \frac{44}{24}y_2^2 \). To maximize x_2^2 + y_2^2, y_2^2 should be minimized, ideally y_2^2 = 0, giving x_2^2 = 20. Thus, x_2^2 + y_2^2 = 20, and BD^2 = 4 * 20 = 80. The greatest real number less than 80 is 79.
