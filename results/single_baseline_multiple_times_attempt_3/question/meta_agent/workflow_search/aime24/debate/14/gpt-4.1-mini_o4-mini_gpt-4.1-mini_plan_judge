Question: Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: Label the vertices so that A=(x1,y1),C=–A and B=(x2,y2),D=–B lie on x^2/20−y^2/24=1 and ABCD is a rhombus with diagonals crossing at the origin. The rhombus condition AB=BC implies A·B=0, so A lies on the line through O perpendicular to OB. Substituting A=s(−y2,x2) into the hyperbola and using B’s equation leads to the requirement x2^2>720/11 for A to be real. Then BD^2=4(x2^2+y2^2)=(44/5)x2^2−96, and as x2^2→720/11+, BD^2→(44/5)(720/11)−96=480. Thus BD^2>480 for all such rhombi, and the greatest real number less than every BD^2 is 480.
