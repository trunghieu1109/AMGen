proposed answer: We are given two equations involving logarithms with bases x and y, both greater than 1: log_x(y^x) = 10 and log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. From the first equation, y^x = x^{10}. From the second, x^{4y} = y^{10}. Taking natural logarithms, we get x ln(y) = 10 ln(x) and 4y ln(x) = 10 ln(y). From the first, ln(y) = (10 ln(x)) / x. Substitute into the second: 4y ln(x) = 10 * (10 ln(x) / x). Dividing both sides by ln(x) (nonzero since x > 1), 4y = 100 / x. Multiply both sides by x: 4xy = 100, so xy = 25. This satisfies the original equations and the conditions x > 1, y > 1. Therefore, the product xy is 25.
