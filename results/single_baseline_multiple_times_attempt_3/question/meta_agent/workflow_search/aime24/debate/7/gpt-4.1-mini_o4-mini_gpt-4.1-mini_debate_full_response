Question: There exist real numbers $x$ and $y$, both greater than 1, such that $\log_x\left(y^x\right)=\log_y\left(x^{4y}\right)=10$. Find $xy$.\Pattern: debate
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Final Decision Agent ryHE', content='We have two equations: log_x(y^x)=10 gives x·(ln y/ln x)=10 ⇒ ln y/ln x=10/x ⇒ y=x^{10/x}. The second: log_y(x^{4y})=10 gives 4y·(ln x/ln y)=10 ⇒ ln x/ln y=5/(2y) ⇒ x=y^{5/(2y)}. Substituting y from the first into the second yields the exponent relation 1=25/(xy), so xy=25.\n\nAnswer:25', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.

From the first, log_x(y^x)=x·log_x(y)=10 ⇒ log_x(y)=10/x ⇒ y=x^{10/x}.\nFrom the second, log_y(x^{4y})=4y·log_y(x)=10 ⇒ log_y(x)=10/(4y)=5/(2y) ⇒ x=y^{5/(2y)}.\nSubstitute y into x: x=[x^{10/x}]^{5/(2y)}=x^{(10/x)(5/(2y))}=x^{25/(xy)}. Since x>1, we equate exponents: 1=25/(xy) ⇒ xy=25.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent puTp:\nWe have x>1,y>1 and need xy. Let A=ln x, B=ln y (both positive). Then log_x(y^x)=x·(ln y/ln x)=x·B/A=10 ⇒ e^A·(B/A)=10 ⇒ B/A=10e^{-A}. Also log_y(x^{4y})=4y·(ln x/ln y)=4e^B·A/B=10 ⇒ A/B=10/(4e^B)=5/(2e^B). But A/B=1/(B/A). So 1/(10e^{-A})=5/(2e^B) ⇒ e^A/10=5/(2e^B) ⇒2e^{A+B}=50 ⇒ e^{A+B}=25. Hence xy=e^{A+B}=25.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent vJqu:\n25\n\n### answer by Debate Agent puTp:\n25\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer. Put your thinking process in the 'thinking' field and the final answer in the 'answer' field."}], sub_tasks=None, agents=None, iteration_idx=-1)]
