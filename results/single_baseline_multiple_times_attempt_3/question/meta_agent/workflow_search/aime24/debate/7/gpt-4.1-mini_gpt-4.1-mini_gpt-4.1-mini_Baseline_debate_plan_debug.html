    <pre>There exist real numbers $x$ and $y$, both greater than 1, such that $\log_x\left(y^x\right)=\log_y\left(x^{4y}\right)=10$. Find $xy$.

### thinking by Debate Agent XMnC:
Given the equations \( \log_x(y^x) = 10 \) and \( \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 \) with \(x &gt; 1\) and \(y &gt; 1\), we want to find \(xy\).

Step 1: Rewrite the logarithmic equations using the definition of logarithms.

From \( \log_x(y^x) = 10 \), we get:
\[ y^x = x^{10} \]

From \( \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 \), we get:
\[ x^{4y} = y^{10} \]

Step 2: Express these equations in terms of logarithms with a common base (e.g., natural logarithm \(\ln\)) to handle the exponents.

From \( y^x = x^{10} \):
\[ x \ln y = 10 \ln x \]

From \( x^{4y} = y^{10} \):
\[ 4y \ln x = 10 \ln y \]

Step 3: Introduce variables \(a = \ln x\) and \(b = \ln y\), both positive since \(x, y &gt; 1\).

The equations become:
\[
 x b = 10 a \quad \Rightarrow \quad e^a b = 10 a \quad (1)
\]
\[
 4 y a = 10 b \quad \Rightarrow \quad 4 e^b a = 10 b \quad (2)
\]

Step 4: From equation (1), express \(b\) in terms of \(a\):
\[
 b = \frac{10 a}{e^a}
\]

Step 5: Substitute \(b\) into equation (2):
\[
 4 e^b a = 10 b \Rightarrow 4 e^b a = 10 \cdot \frac{10 a}{e^a} \Rightarrow 4 e^b a = \frac{100 a}{e^a}
\]

Divide both sides by \(a\) (nonzero since \(x &gt; 1 \Rightarrow a = \ln x &gt; 0\)):
\[
 4 e^b = \frac{100}{e^a} \Rightarrow e^b = \frac{25}{e^a}
\]

Step 6: Recall that \(b = \frac{10 a}{e^a}\), so:
\[
 e^b = e^{\frac{10 a}{e^a}} = \frac{25}{e^a}
\]

Multiply both sides by \(e^a\):
\[
 e^{a + \frac{10 a}{e^a}} = 25
\]

Step 7: Let \(t = e^a = x\), so \(a = \ln t\). Then:
\[
 e^{\ln t + \frac{10 \ln t}{t}} = 25 \Rightarrow t \cdot e^{\frac{10 \ln t}{t}} = 25
\]

Rewrite:
\[
 t \cdot e^{10 \frac{\ln t}{t}} = 25
\]

Note that \(e^{10 \frac{\ln t}{t}} = (e^{\ln t})^{\frac{10}{t}} = t^{\frac{10}{t}}\), so:
\[
 t \cdot t^{\frac{10}{t}} = t^{1 + \frac{10}{t}} = 25
\]

Step 8: Simplify the exponent:
\[
 1 + \frac{10}{t} = \frac{t + 10}{t}
\]

So:
\[
 t^{\frac{t + 10}{t}} = 25 \Rightarrow t^{t + 10} = 25^{t}
\]

Step 9: Recall that \(25 = 5^2\), so:
\[
 t^{t + 10} = (5^2)^t = 5^{2t}
\]

Rewrite \(t^{t + 10} = 5^{2t}\).

Step 10: Try to find integer or simple rational solutions for \(t = x\).

Try \(t = 5\):
\[
 5^{5 + 10} = 5^{15} \quad \text{and} \quad 5^{2 \cdot 5} = 5^{10}
\]
No equality.

Try \(t = 25\):
\[
 25^{25 + 10} = 25^{35} \quad \text{and} \quad 5^{2 \cdot 25} = 5^{50}
\]
Rewrite \(25 = 5^2\):
\[
 (5^2)^{35} = 5^{70} \neq 5^{50}
\]
No equality.

Try \(t = 2\):
\[
 2^{2 + 10} = 2^{12} = 4096 \quad \text{and} \quad 5^{2 \cdot 2} = 5^4 = 625
\]
No.

Try \(t = 10\):
\[
 10^{10 + 10} = 10^{20} \quad \text{and} \quad 5^{2 \cdot 10} = 5^{20}
\]
No equality.

Step 11: Instead, take logarithm base 5 on both sides of \(t^{t+10} = 5^{2t}\):
\[
 (t + 10) \log_5 t = 2 t
\]

Step 12: Define \(f(t) = (t + 10) \log_5 t - 2 t\).

Check values:
- For \(t=1\), \(f(1) = 11 \cdot 0 - 2 = -2\) (negative)
- For \(t=5\), \(f(5) = 15 \cdot 1 - 10 = 5\) (positive)

So root between 1 and 5.

Try \(t=2\), \(\log_5 2 \approx 0.43\):
\[
 (2 + 10) \times 0.43 - 4 = 12 \times 0.43 - 4 = 5.16 - 4 = 1.16 &gt; 0
\]

Try \(t=1.5\), \(\log_5 1.5 \approx 0.26\):
\[
 11.5 \times 0.26 - 3 = 2.99 - 3 = -0.01 &lt; 0
\]

Root near 1.5 to 2.

Step 13: Approximate solution for \(t\) around 1.52.

Step 14: Recall from step 4 that \(b = \frac{10 a}{e^a} = \frac{10 \ln t}{t}\).

Step 15: Find \(xy = e^{a + b} = t \cdot e^b\).

From step 6, \(e^b = \frac{25}{t}\).

Thus:
\[
 xy = t \cdot \frac{25}{t} = 25
\]

Step 16: Therefore, \(xy = 25\).

Check consistency:
\[
 \log_x(y^x) = 10 \Rightarrow y^x = x^{10} \Rightarrow (y)^x = x^{10}
\]

Since \(xy=25\), \(y = \frac{25}{x}\).

Substitute:
\[
 \left(\frac{25}{x}\right)^x = x^{10} \Rightarrow 25^x x^{-x} = x^{10} \Rightarrow 25^x = x^{10 + x}
\]

Taking \(\log_5\) both sides:
\[
 x \log_5 25 = (10 + x) \log_5 x \Rightarrow x \cdot 2 = (10 + x) \log_5 x \Rightarrow 2x = (10 + x) \log_5 x
\]

This matches the earlier equation in step 11, confirming the solution.

Answer: \(xy = 25\).

### thinking by Debate Agent bKXM:
We are given two equations involving logarithms with bases x and y, both greater than 1:

1) log_x(y^x) = 10
2) log_y(x^{4y}) = 10

From the first equation:
log_x(y^x) = 10
By definition of logarithm, this means:
y^x = x^{10}

From the second equation:
log_y(x^{4y}) = 10
By definition:
x^{4y} = y^{10}

So we have the system:
(1) y^x = x^{10}
(2) x^{4y} = y^{10}

Take natural logarithm (ln) on both sides of each equation:

From (1):
x ln(y) = 10 ln(x)

From (2):
4y ln(x) = 10 ln(y)

We want to find xy.

From the first equation:
ln(y) = (10 ln(x)) / x

Substitute ln(y) into the second equation:
4y ln(x) = 10 * (10 ln(x) / x)

Simplify:
4y ln(x) = (100 ln(x)) / x

Since ln(x) â‰  0 (because x &gt; 1), divide both sides by ln(x):
4y = 100 / x

Multiply both sides by x:
4xy = 100

Divide both sides by 4:
xy = 25

So the product xy is 25.
