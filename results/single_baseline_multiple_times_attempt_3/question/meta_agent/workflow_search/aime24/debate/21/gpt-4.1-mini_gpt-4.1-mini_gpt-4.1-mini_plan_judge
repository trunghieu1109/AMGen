Question: Find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon ($12$-gon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The diagram below shows three of those rectangles.

proposed answer: The problem asks for the number of rectangles inside a regular dodecagon where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The vertices of the dodecagon lie on a circle, equally spaced every 30 degrees. Rectangles inscribed in a circle must have vertices that are pairs of opposite points (180 degrees apart). There are 6 such pairs in a 12-gon. Each rectangle corresponds to choosing two pairs of opposite vertices, which gives C(6,2) = 15 rectangles. However, for the rectangle to have sides along sides or diagonals of the dodecagon, the sides must be chords connecting these vertices. Since all chords between vertices are either sides or diagonals, all these 15 rectangles satisfy the condition. The alternative reasoning that only 3 rectangles exist comes from considering only pairs of opposite vertices whose chords are perpendicular (differ by 90 degrees), but this is a misunderstanding: any two pairs of opposite vertices define a rectangle inscribed in the circle, and the sides are chords of the polygon. Therefore, the correct count is 15 rectangles.
