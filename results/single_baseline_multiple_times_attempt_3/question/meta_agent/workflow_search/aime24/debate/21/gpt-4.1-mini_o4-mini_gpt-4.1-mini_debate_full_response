Question: Find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon ($12$-gon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The diagram below shows three of those rectangles.

Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Final Decision Agent udgX', content='We need rectangles whose sides lie along diagonals (or sides) of the regular 12-gon.  A rectangle is determined by two directions of parallel supporting lines that are perpendicular.  The diagonals lie on 12 possible directions indexed by the sum of the endpoint labels mod 12; family s has m_s diagonals, where m_s=5 if s even and m_s=6 if s odd.  Perpendicular families are s and s+6, for s=0,…,5.  From family s we choose 2 lines, and from s+6 another 2, yielding C(m_s,2)·C(m_{s+6},2) rectangles for that pair.  Summing over s=0…5 gives 3·C(5,2)² + 3·C(6,2)² = 3·100 + 3·225 = 975.\n\nAnswer:975', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.

In any rectangle inscribed in a circle the diagonals are equal and bisect each other, hence must both be diameters.  A regular 12‐gon has 6 pairs of opposite vertices (diameters).  Choosing any 2 of these 6 diameters gives a unique rectangle whose vertices are those 4 endpoints.  Thus the total number is C(6,2)=15.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent s6BM:\nLabel the 12 vertices 0,…,11 around the circle.  Any chord joining i to i+k (mod 12) is parallel to all other chords with the same difference k (or 12−k), so there are families k=1,2,3,4,5 of parallel sides/diagonals each of size 12.  (The k=6 “diagonals” are diameters but are not parallel to one another, so they cannot form two parallel sides of a rectangle.)  The direction of family k differs from family m by (k−m)×15°, so families k and m are perpendicular exactly when k−m≡6 (mod 12).  This yields only the unordered pairs (1,5) and (2,4).  In each pair we choose any 2 chords from the first family and any 2 chords from the perpendicular family to be the 4 sides of a rectangle.  Each of those families has 12 chords, so there are C(12,2)=66 ways to pick 2 in each.  Therefore for each perpendicular pair there are 66×66=4356 rectangles, and with 2 such pairs the total is 2×4356=8712.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 9UuB:\n15\n\n### answer by Debate Agent s6BM:\n8712\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
