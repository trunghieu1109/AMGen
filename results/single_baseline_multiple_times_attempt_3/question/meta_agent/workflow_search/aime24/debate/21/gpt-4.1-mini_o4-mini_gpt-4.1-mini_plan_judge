Question: Find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon ($12$-gon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The diagram below shows three of those rectangles.

proposed answer: We need rectangles whose sides lie along diagonals (or sides) of the regular 12-gon.  A rectangle is determined by two directions of parallel supporting lines that are perpendicular.  The diagonals lie on 12 possible directions indexed by the sum of the endpoint labels mod 12; family s has m_s diagonals, where m_s=5 if s even and m_s=6 if s odd.  Perpendicular families are s and s+6, for s=0,…,5.  From family s we choose 2 lines, and from s+6 another 2, yielding C(m_s,2)·C(m_{s+6},2) rectangles for that pair.  Summing over s=0…5 gives 3·C(5,2)² + 3·C(6,2)² = 3·100 + 3·225 = 975.
