Question: Find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon ($12$-gon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The diagram below shows three of those rectangles.

proposed answer: To find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon, we need to consider the vertices and diagonals of the dodecagon. A regular dodecagon has 12 vertices. A rectangle can be formed by choosing two pairs of parallel sides. In a regular dodecagon, each pair of opposite sides are parallel. Additionally, diagonals can also be used as sides of the rectangles if they are parallel to each other. We need to consider all possible pairs of parallel lines among the sides and diagonals in the dodecagon. Each pair of parallel lines will form the opposite sides of a rectangle. The number of ways to choose 2 pairs out of 6 pairs of parallel lines (including sides and diagonals) is given by the combination formula C(6, 2) = 15. Therefore, the number of rectangles is 15.
