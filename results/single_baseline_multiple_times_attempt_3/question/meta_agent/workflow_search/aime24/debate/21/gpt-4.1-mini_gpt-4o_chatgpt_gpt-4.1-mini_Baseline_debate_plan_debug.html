    <pre>Find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon ($12$-gon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The diagram below shows three of those rectangles.

### thinking by Debate Agent 177M:
To find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon, we need to consider the vertices of the dodecagon. A rectangle is determined by choosing two pairs of parallel sides. In a regular dodecagon, there are 12 vertices, and we can choose any two opposite vertices to form one pair of parallel sides of the rectangle. The dodecagon can be divided into 6 pairs of opposite sides (diameters), each corresponding to a pair of parallel sides for a rectangle. For each such pair, we can choose another pair of opposite sides from the remaining 5 pairs to form the other pair of parallel sides of the rectangle. Therefore, the number of rectangles is given by the combinations of these pairs. The number of ways to choose 2 pairs out of 6 pairs is given by the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!).

### thinking by Debate Agent LGED:
To find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon, we need to consider the vertices of the dodecagon and the diagonals that can form the sides of the rectangles. A regular dodecagon has 12 vertices. A rectangle can be formed by choosing two pairs of parallel sides. In a regular dodecagon, each pair of opposite sides are parallel. Additionally, diagonals can also be used as sides of the rectangles if they are parallel to each other. We need to consider all possible pairs of parallel lines among the sides and diagonals in the dodecagon. Each pair of parallel lines will form the opposite sides of a rectangle. We will count how many such pairs can be formed.
