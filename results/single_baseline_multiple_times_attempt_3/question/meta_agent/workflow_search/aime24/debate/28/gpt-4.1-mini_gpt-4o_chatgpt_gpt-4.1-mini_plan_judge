Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine the radii of the circles of tangency when the torus is externally and internally tangent to the sphere. The torus has a major radius of 6 and a minor radius of 3. The sphere has a radius of 11. When the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 11 + 6 = 17. The radius of the circle of tangency is 17 - 3 = 14. When the torus is internally tangent to the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 11 - 6 = 5. The radius of the circle of tangency is 5 - 3 = 2. The difference between these radii is 14 - 2 = 12. This can be expressed as the fraction 12/1, where m = 12 and n = 1. Therefore, m + n = 13.
