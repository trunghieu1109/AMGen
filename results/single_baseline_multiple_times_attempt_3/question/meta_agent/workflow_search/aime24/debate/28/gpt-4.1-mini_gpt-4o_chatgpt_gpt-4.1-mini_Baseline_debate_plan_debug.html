    <pre>Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

### thinking by Debate Agent goHU:
To solve the problem, we need to understand the geometry of the torus and the sphere. The torus is formed by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis that is 6 units away from the circle&#39;s center. This gives the torus a &#39;tube&#39; radius of 3 and a &#39;central&#39; radius (from the center of the hole to the center of the tube) of 6. The sphere has a radius of 11.

When the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is the sum of the sphere&#39;s radius and the torus&#39;s central radius, which is 11 + 6 = 17.

The inner tangency occurs when the torus is inside the sphere and tangent to it. In this case, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is the difference between the sphere&#39;s radius and the torus&#39;s central radius, which is 11 - 6 = 5.

The radii of the tangent circles are the distances from the center of the torus to the points of tangency. For external tangency, this distance is the torus&#39;s tube radius, which is 3. For internal tangency, the distance is also 3.

Therefore, the radii of the tangent circles are found by subtracting the tube radius from the distances calculated for tangency: for external tangency, the radius is 17 - 3 = 14, and for internal tangency, the radius is 5 - 3 = 2.

The difference between these radii is 14 - 2 = 12. We express this as a fraction \(\frac{12}{1}\), where \(m = 12\) and \(n = 1\). Thus, \(m + n = 13\).

To solve this problem, we first need to understand the geometry of the torus and the sphere. The torus is formed by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis that is 6 units away from the center of the circle. This means the major radius (distance from the center of the torus to the center of the tube) is 6, and the minor radius (radius of the tube) is 3. The sphere has a radius of 11. When the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 11 + 3 = 14 (since the tube of the torus has radius 3). The circle of tangency on the torus has a radius of 6 - 3 = 3, so r_i = 3. When the torus is internally tangent to the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 11 - 3 = 8. The circle of tangency on the torus has a radius of 6 + 3 = 9, so r_o = 9. The difference r_i - r_o is 3 - 9 = -6. However, the problem asks for the positive difference, so we take the absolute value, which is 6. The fraction 6/1 is already in simplest form, so m = 6 and n = 1. Therefore, m + n = 7.
