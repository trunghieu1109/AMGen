    <pre>Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

### thinking by Debate Agent KLbN:
We model the torus of major radius R=6 and minor radius a=3 and a sphere of radius S=11.  In a meridional cross‐section the torus tube is a circle of radius a centered at (R,0).  If the torus rests on the sphere from above, the sphere center lies at (0,−d) and the distance from it to a point (R+a cos θ, a sin θ) on the tube isf(θ)=(R+a cos θ)^2+(a sin θ+d)^2.  Critical points satisfy tan θ=d/R, giving two solutions in [0,2π): one with θ in QIII (inner‐tube contact) and one with θ in QI (outer‐tube contact).  In each case the circle‐center–sphere‐center separation D_0=√(R^2+d^2) must equal S±a.  For the inner contact (near side of the tube) D_0=S+a=14, hence the contact‐circle radiusr_i=R(1−a/D_0)=6(1−3/14)=33/7.  For the outer contact (far side) D_0=S−a=8, hencer_o=R(1+a/D_0)=6(1+3/8)=33/4.  Thus the (positive) difference isr_o−r_i=33/4−33/7=99/28, so m=99,n=28 and m+n=127.

### thinking by Debate Agent Ve7W:
We model the torus of major radius R=6 and minor radius a=3 centered on the z‐axis, with its central circle in the plane z=h.  The sphere of radius 11 is centered at the origin.  Lower the torus along z until it is tangent to the sphere.  By rotational symmetry, a point of contact can be taken at φ=0 on the torus tube, with coordinates (ρ,0,z)=(6+3cosθ,0,h+3sinθ).  Tangency requires two equations:
1) Distance to sphere center equals 11: (6+3cosθ)²+(h+3sinθ)²=121.
2) The contact is a critical point so derivative wrt θ vanishes: h=6 tanθ.
Substituting gives (6+3cosθ)²/cos²θ=121, so (6+3cosθ)/cosθ=±11.  The “+11” case yields cosθ=3/4, giving contact‐circle radius r₁=6+3·(3/4)=33/4.  The “−11” case yields cosθ=−3/7, giving r₂=6+3·(−3/7)=33/7.  Thus the two tangency circles have radii 33/4 and 33/7, and their difference is 33/4−33/7=99/28, so m+n=99+28=127.

    <pre>We model the torus of major radius R=6 and minor radius a=3, and a sphere of radius 11. By symmetry, the torus can touch the sphere in two ways—on the near side (“inner”) and far side (“outer”). In a meridional cross‐section the torus tube is the circle of radius a centered at (R,0), and the sphere of radius S=11 has center at (0,−d) when the torus rests above it by distance d. Tangency requires that the distance from the sphere center to the torus tube center equals S±a, namely d₁=14 for the inner contact and d₂=8 for the outer. The contact circle radius in each case is r=R(1∓a/d), giving r_i=6(1–3/14)=33/7 and r_o=6(1+3/8)=33/4. Their positive difference is |r_o−r_i|=33/4−33/7=99/28, so m=99, n=28 and m+n=127.
