Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: The torus T has major radius R = 6 and minor radius r = 3. The sphere S has radius 11. The torus is tangent to the sphere along circles of radius r_i and r_o. By analyzing the geometry, the circle of tangency lies at a radius rho from the axis, where rho = R + r cos v for some angle v. The sphere radius equals the radius of curvature of the torus at the point of tangency, leading to two possible values of cos v: 3/4 and 3/7. Corresponding radii of the circles of tangency on the torus are rho_o = 6 + 3*(3/4) = 33/4 and rho_i = 6 + 3*(3/7) = 51/7. The difference r_i - r_o = (51/7) - (33/4) = (204 - 231)/28 = -27/28, taking absolute value 27/28. Thus, m = 27, n = 28, and m + n = 55.
