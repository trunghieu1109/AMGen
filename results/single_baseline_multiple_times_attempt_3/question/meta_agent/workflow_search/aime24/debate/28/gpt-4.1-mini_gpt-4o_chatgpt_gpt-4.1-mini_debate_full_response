Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.\Pattern: debate
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Final Decision Agent D4I4', content='To solve the problem, we need to determine the radii of the circles of tangency when the torus is externally and internally tangent to the sphere. The torus has a major radius of 6 and a minor radius of 3. The sphere has a radius of 11. When the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 11 + 6 = 17. The radius of the circle of tangency is 17 - 3 = 14. When the torus is internally tangent to the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 11 - 6 = 5. The radius of the circle of tangency is 5 - 3 = 2. The difference between these radii is 14 - 2 = 12. This can be expressed as the fraction 12/1, where m = 12 and n = 1. Therefore, m + n = 13.\n\nAnswer:13', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.

The torus is formed by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis that is 6 units away from the circle's center. This gives the torus a 'tube' radius of 3 and a 'central' radius (from the center of the hole to the center of the tube) of 6. The sphere has a radius of 11.\n\nWhen the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is the sum of the sphere's radius and the torus's central radius, which is 11 + 6 = 17.\n\nThe inner tangency occurs when the torus is inside the sphere and tangent to it. In this case, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is the difference between the sphere's radius and the torus's central radius, which is 11 - 6 = 5.\n\nThe radii of the tangent circles are the distances from the center of the torus to the points of tangency. For external tangency, this distance is the torus's tube radius, which is 3. For internal tangency, the distance is also 3.\n\nTherefore, the radii of the tangent circles are found by subtracting the tube radius from the distances calculated for tangency: for external tangency, the radius is 17 - 3 = 14, and for internal tangency, the radius is 5 - 3 = 2.\n\nThe difference between these radii is 14 - 2 = 12. We express this as a fraction \\(\\frac{12}{1}\\), where \\(m = 12\\) and \\(n = 1\\). Thus, \\(m + n = 13\\).\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent t8r0:\nTo solve this problem, we first need to understand the geometry of the torus and the sphere. The torus is formed by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis that is 6 units away from the center of the circle. This means the major radius (distance from the center of the torus to the center of the tube) is 6, and the minor radius (radius of the tube) is 3. The sphere has a radius of 11. When the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 11 + 3 = 14 (since the tube of the torus has radius 3). The circle of tangency on the torus has a radius of 6 - 3 = 3, so r_i = 3. When the torus is internally tangent to the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 11 - 3 = 8. The circle of tangency on the torus has a radius of 6 + 3 = 9, so r_o = 9. The difference r_i - r_o is 3 - 9 = -6. However, the problem asks for the positive difference, so we take the absolute value, which is 6. The fraction 6/1 is already in simplest form, so m = 6 and n = 1. Therefore, m + n = 7.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent goHU:\n13\n\n### answer by Debate Agent t8r0:\n7\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
