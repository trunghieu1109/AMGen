Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: We model the torus of major radius R=6 and minor radius a=3, and a sphere of radius 11. By symmetry, the torus can touch the sphere in two ways—on the near side (“inner”) and far side (“outer”). In a meridional cross‐section the torus tube is the circle of radius a centered at (R,0), and the sphere of radius S=11 has center at (0,−d) when the torus rests above it by distance d. Tangency requires that the distance from the sphere center to the torus tube center equals S±a, namely d₁=14 for the inner contact and d₂=8 for the outer. The contact circle radius in each case is r=R(1∓a/d), giving r_i=6(1–3/14)=33/7 and r_o=6(1+3/8)=33/4. Their positive difference is |r_o−r_i|=33/4−33/7=99/28, so m=99, n=28 and m+n=127.
