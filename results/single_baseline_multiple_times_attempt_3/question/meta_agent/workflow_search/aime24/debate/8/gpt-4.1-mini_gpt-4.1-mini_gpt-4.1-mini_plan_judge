Question: Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The game is a take-away game where each player can remove either 1 or 4 tokens from a stack. Alice goes first, and the player who removes the last token wins. We want to find the number of positive integers n ≤ 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy regardless of Alice's moves. By analyzing the game positions as winning (W) or losing (L) for the player to move, we find that losing positions occur when n mod 5 is 0 or 2. Since Alice moves first, Bob wins if the initial position is losing for Alice, i.e., n mod 5 = 0 or 2. Counting such n ≤ 2024: numbers divisible by 5 are 404, and numbers congruent to 2 mod 5 are 405, totaling 809. Therefore, there are 809 positive integers n ≤ 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy.
