Question: Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: Consider the subtraction game where on each move a player removes 1 or 4 tokens.  The losing positions (P‐positions) satisfy that neither of the positions reachable by removing 1 or 4 tokens is losing.  By computing small values or using the recurrence, one finds that P‐positions occur exactly when n≡0 or 2 (mod 5).  We count positive n≤2024 with n≡0 mod5: ⌊2024/5⌋=404, and with n≡2 mod5: ⌊(2024−2)/5⌋+1=405.  Thus there are 404+405=809 such n.
