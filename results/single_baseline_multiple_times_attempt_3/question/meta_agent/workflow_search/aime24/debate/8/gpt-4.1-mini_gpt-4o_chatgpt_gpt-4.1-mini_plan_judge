Question: Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.

proposed answer: To determine the winning and losing positions, we need to analyze the game for small values of n and identify a pattern. A position is losing if every move leaves the opponent in a winning position, and winning if there is at least one move that leaves the opponent in a losing position. Starting from n = 1, we find that n = 1 is a winning position for Alice. For n = 2, Alice can only leave n = 1 for Bob, which is winning for Bob, so n = 2 is losing for Alice. Similarly, n = 3 is losing for Alice because she can only leave n = 2 for Bob, which is winning for Bob. For n = 4, Alice can take all 4 tokens and win, so n = 4 is winning for Alice. For n = 5, Alice can take 4 tokens, leaving 1 for Bob, which is winning for Bob, so n = 5 is losing for Alice. Continuing this pattern, we find that the losing positions for Alice (winning for Bob) are n = 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18, 20, 21, 23, 24, ... These positions are of the form 4k + 2 and 4k + 3. To count how many such positions exist for n <= 2024, we calculate the number of integers of the form 4k + 2 and 4k + 3 up to 2024. For 4k + 2, k ranges from 0 to 505, giving 506 numbers. For 4k + 3, k ranges from 0 to 505, giving another 506 numbers. Therefore, there are 506 + 506 = 1012 such numbers.
