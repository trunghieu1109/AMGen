    <pre>Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice&#39;s play.

### thinking by Debate Agent owbL:
We have a subtraction game where each move removes 1 or 4 tokens from a single pile. P-positions (previous-player win) satisfy Grundy(n)=0. Compute small values:
 n: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...
 G: 0 1 0 1 2 0 1 0 1 2 0 ...
 We see G(n)=0 precisely when n mod 5 in {0,2}. For positive n, those are n≡0 or 2 mod5. We count n≤2024 with n≡0 mod5: 5,10,…,2020 gives 2020/5=404 values; with n≡2 mod5: 2,7,…,2022 gives (2022−2)/5+1=405 values. Total=404+405=809.

### thinking by Debate Agent ixu7:
We have a subtraction game where each turn a player removes 1 or 4 tokens.  Positions where the next player loses (P‐positions) satisfy dp[n]=P if neither dp[n−1] nor dp[n−4] is P, with dp[0]=P.  Computing small values shows P‐positions occur exactly when n≡0 or 2 (mod 5).  For n≤2024 and n&gt;0, the counts are:  n≡0 mod 5 gives ⌊2024/5⌋=404 values; n≡2 mod 5 gives ⌊(2024−2)/5⌋+1=405 values.  Thus there are 404+405=809 starting positions for which Alice (first player) is in a losing position and Bob can force a win.

    <pre>Consider the subtraction game where on each move a player removes 1 or 4 tokens.  The losing positions (P‐positions) satisfy that neither of the positions reachable by removing 1 or 4 tokens is losing.  By computing small values or using the recurrence, one finds that P‐positions occur exactly when n≡0 or 2 (mod 5).  We count positive n≤2024 with n≡0 mod5: ⌊2024/5⌋=404, and with n≡2 mod5: ⌊(2024−2)/5⌋+1=405.  Thus there are 404+405=809 such n.
