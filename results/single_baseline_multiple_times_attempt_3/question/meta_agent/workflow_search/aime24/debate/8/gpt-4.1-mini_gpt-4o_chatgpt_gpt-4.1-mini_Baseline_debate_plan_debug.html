    <pre>Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice&#39;s play.

### thinking by Debate Agent QDgJ:
To determine the winning and losing positions, consider the base cases first. If n = 1, Alice can take the token and win. If n = 2, Alice takes 1 token, leaving n = 1 for Bob, who then loses. Similarly, if n = 3, Alice takes 1 token, leaving n = 2 for Bob, who then loses. If n = 4, Alice can take all 4 tokens and win. For n = 5, Alice can take 4 tokens, leaving 1 for Bob, who then loses. Now generalize the pattern: A position is a losing position if every possible move leaves the opponent in a winning position. Conversely, a position is a winning position if there&#39;s at least one move that leaves the opponent in a losing position. By analyzing, we find that the positions n = 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18, 20, 21, 23, 24, ... are losing positions for the first player (Alice). Notice the pattern: these are numbers of the form 4k + 2 or 4k + 3. For these values, Bob can force Alice into a losing position on her next move, ensuring his win. We need to count how many such numbers are there up to 2024. For 4k + 2, k ranges from 0 to 505, giving 506 numbers. For 4k + 3, k ranges from 0 to 505, giving another 506 numbers. Therefore, there are 506 + 506 = 1012 such numbers.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the losing positions for Alice, which are the winning positions for Bob. A position is losing if every move from it leaves the opponent in a winning position. Conversely, a position is winning if there is at least one move from it that leaves the opponent in a losing position. We can analyze the positions starting from small values of n:

- n = 1: Alice takes 1 token and wins. So, n = 1 is a winning position for Alice.
- n = 2: Alice takes 1 token, leaving 1 token for Bob, who wins. So, n = 2 is a losing position for Alice.
- n = 3: Alice takes 1 token, leaving 2 tokens for Bob, who wins. So, n = 3 is a losing position for Alice.
- n = 4: Alice can take all 4 tokens and win. So, n = 4 is a winning position for Alice.
- n = 5: Alice can take 4 tokens, leaving 1 token for Bob, who wins. So, n = 5 is a losing position for Alice.

Continuing this pattern, we notice that the positions n = 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15, ... are losing positions for Alice (winning for Bob). The pattern shows that these losing positions occur in groups of 3 consecutive numbers, starting at n = 2. Specifically, the losing positions are of the form 2 + 3k, 3 + 3k, and 5 + 3k for non-negative integers k.

To find how many such positions exist for n &lt;= 2024, we calculate the maximum k such that 5 + 3k &lt;= 2024. Solving for k, we get 3k &lt;= 2019, so k &lt;= 673.

For each k from 0 to 673, there are 3 losing positions: 2 + 3k, 3 + 3k, and 5 + 3k. Therefore, the total number of losing positions (winning for Bob) is 3 * (673 + 1) = 3 * 674 = 2022.

    <pre>To determine the winning and losing positions, we need to analyze the game for small values of n and identify a pattern. A position is losing if every move leaves the opponent in a winning position, and winning if there is at least one move that leaves the opponent in a losing position. Starting from n = 1, we find that n = 1 is a winning position for Alice. For n = 2, Alice can only leave n = 1 for Bob, which is winning for Bob, so n = 2 is losing for Alice. Similarly, n = 3 is losing for Alice because she can only leave n = 2 for Bob, which is winning for Bob. For n = 4, Alice can take all 4 tokens and win, so n = 4 is winning for Alice. For n = 5, Alice can take 4 tokens, leaving 1 for Bob, which is winning for Bob, so n = 5 is losing for Alice. Continuing this pattern, we find that the losing positions for Alice (winning for Bob) are n = 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18, 20, 21, 23, 24, ... These positions are of the form 4k + 2 and 4k + 3. To count how many such positions exist for n &lt;= 2024, we calculate the number of integers of the form 4k + 2 and 4k + 3 up to 2024. For 4k + 2, k ranges from 0 to 505, giving 506 numbers. For 4k + 3, k ranges from 0 to 505, giving another 506 numbers. Therefore, there are 506 + 506 = 1012 such numbers.
