    <pre>Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice&#39;s play.

### thinking by Debate Agent 8kOF:
The game is a variation of a classic take-away game where each player can remove either 1 or 4 tokens from the stack. Alice goes first, and the player who removes the last token wins. We want to find the number of positive integers n ≤ 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy regardless of Alice&#39;s moves.

Let&#39;s define the positions as winning (W) or losing (L) for the player about to move:
- A position is losing if there is no move from it to a losing position.
- A position is winning if there is at least one move from it to a losing position.

We analyze the game from the end:
- n=0: no tokens left, so the player to move loses (L).
- n=1: can remove 1 token and win immediately, so W.
- n=2: can remove 1 token to get to n=1 (W), or 4 tokens (not possible), so all moves lead to W positions, so n=2 is L.
- n=3: remove 1 to n=2 (L), so W.
- n=4: remove 4 to n=0 (L), so W.
- n=5: remove 1 to n=4 (W) or 4 to n=1 (W), all moves lead to W, so L.

Summarizing:
- n=0: L
- n=1: W
- n=2: L
- n=3: W
- n=4: W
- n=5: L

We see a pattern emerging:
Positions n where the player to move loses (L) are 0,2,5, and let&#39;s check further:
- n=6: remove 1 to 5 (L), so W
- n=7: remove 1 to 6 (W), remove 4 to 3 (W), all moves lead to W, so L
- n=8: remove 1 to 7 (L), so W
- n=9: remove 1 to 8 (W), remove 4 to 5 (L), so W
- n=10: remove 1 to 9 (W), remove 4 to 6 (W), all moves lead to W, so L

L positions: 0,2,5,7,10

Let&#39;s look at the differences:
From 0 to 2: +2
2 to 5: +3
5 to 7: +2
7 to 10: +3

Pattern suggests L positions occur at n where n mod 5 is 0 or 2.
Check n mod 5:
- n=0 mod 5: n=0,5,10,... L
- n=2 mod 5: n=2,7,... L
Check n=12 (2 mod 5): remove 1 to 11, remove 4 to 8
We need to verify more positions to confirm this pattern.

Check n=11 (1 mod 5): remove 1 to 10 (L), so W
n=12 (2 mod 5): remove 1 to 11 (W), remove 4 to 8 (W), all moves lead to W, so L

So the losing positions are those where n mod 5 is 0 or 2.

Since Alice goes first, Bob wins if and only if the starting position is losing for Alice (the first player), i.e., if n is losing.

Therefore, the values of n ≤ 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy are those with n mod 5 = 0 or 2.

Count the number of such n:
- Total numbers ≤ 2024 divisible by 5: floor(2024/5) = 404
- Numbers ≤ 2024 where n mod 5 = 2: numbers of the form 5k + 2 ≤ 2024
The largest k satisfies 5k + 2 ≤ 2024 =&gt; 5k ≤ 2022 =&gt; k ≤ 404
So k = 0 to 404, total 405 numbers.

Total numbers with n mod 5 = 0 or 2 = 404 + 405 = 809

Therefore, there are 809 positive integers n ≤ 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy.

### thinking by Debate Agent lFRD:
We have a game where Alice and Bob alternate removing either 1 or 4 tokens from a stack of n tokens. Alice goes first. The player who removes the last token wins. We want to find how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy regardless of Alice&#39;s moves.

Step 1: Define winning (W) and losing (L) positions.
- A position is losing if the player to move cannot force a win.
- A position is winning if the player to move can force a win.

Step 2: Base cases:
- If there are 0 tokens left when it&#39;s your turn, you lose (no moves).

Step 3: Calculate the status for small n:
- n=0: L (no moves)
- n=1: can remove 1 → leads to n=0 (L), so n=1 is W
- n=2: can remove 1 → n=1 (W), remove 4 (not possible), since all moves lead to W, n=2 is L
- n=3: remove 1 → n=2 (L), so n=3 is W
- n=4: remove 1 → n=3 (W), remove 4 → n=0 (L), since a move to L exists, n=4 is W
- n=5: remove 1 → n=4 (W), remove 4 → n=1 (W), all moves lead to W, so n=5 is L

Step 4: Pattern so far:
- n=0: L
- n=1: W
- n=2: L
- n=3: W
- n=4: W
- n=5: L

Step 5: Continue a bit more:
- n=6: remove 1 → n=5 (L), so W
- n=7: remove 1 → n=6 (W), remove 4 → n=3 (W), all W → L
- n=8: remove 1 → n=7 (L), so W
- n=9: remove 1 → n=8 (W), remove 4 → n=5 (L), so W
- n=10: remove 1 → n=9 (W), remove 4 → n=6 (W), all W → L

Step 6: Observing losing positions (L):
- n=0,2,5,7,10

Step 7: Check if there&#39;s a pattern in losing positions:
List of losing positions found: 0, 2, 5, 7, 10
Check differences:
2 - 0 = 2
5 - 2 = 3
7 - 5 = 2
10 - 7 = 3

Try to find a pattern modulo 5:
- 0 mod 5 = 0 (L)
- 2 mod 5 = 2 (L)
- 5 mod 5 = 0 (L)
- 7 mod 5 = 2 (L)
- 10 mod 5 = 0 (L)

So losing positions are those where n mod 5 is 0 or 2.

Step 8: Verify for more values:
- n=12: 12 mod 5 = 2, predict L
  remove 1 → 11 (?), remove 4 → 8 (?)
  Need to check 8 and 11
- n=8: W (from above)
- n=11: 11 mod 5 = 1, probably W
So moves from 12 lead to W, so 12 is L.

Step 9: Conclusion: Losing positions are those where n mod 5 = 0 or 2.

Step 10: Since Alice goes first, Bob wins if the starting position is losing for Alice, i.e., the initial n is a losing position.

Step 11: Count how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 satisfy n mod 5 = 0 or 2.
- For n mod 5 = 0: numbers are 5, 10, 15, ..., up to 2020 (since 2020 mod 5=0)
  Number of such numbers = 2020/5 = 404
- For n mod 5 = 2: numbers are 2, 7, 12, ..., up to the largest ≤ 2024
  Largest number ≤ 2024 with mod 5 = 2 is 2022 (since 2022 mod 5 = 2)
  Number of such numbers = ((2022 - 2)/5) + 1 = (2020/5) + 1 = 404 + 1 = 405

Step 12: Total numbers where Bob wins = 404 + 405 = 809

Therefore, there are 809 such positive integers n ≤ 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy.
