Question: Let $\omega\neq 1$ be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\]
is divided by 1000.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The problem asks for the remainder when the product \( \prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) \) is divided by 1000, where \( \omega \) is a 13th root of unity different from 1. We rewrite the term inside the product as \( (\omega^k)^2 - 2\omega^k + 2 = (\omega^k - 1)^2 + 1 \). Letting \( x = \omega^k \), the product becomes \( \prod_{k=0}^{12} P(\omega^k) \) where \( P(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2 \). Since the \( \omega^k \) are roots of \( x^{13} - 1 = 0 \), the product equals the resultant \( \text{Res}(x^{13} - 1, P(x)) \). Using the property of resultants, \( \text{Res}(f,g) = a_m^n \prod g(\alpha_i) = a_n^m \prod f(\beta_j) \), where \( \alpha_i \) are roots of \( f \) and \( \beta_j \) roots of \( g \), we compute \( \text{Res}(x^{13} - 1, P(x)) = \prod_{P(\beta)=0} f(\beta) \) since leading coefficients are 1. The roots of \( P(x) \) are \( 1 \pm i \). Evaluating \( f(1+i) = (1+i)^{13} - 1 \) and \( f(1 - i) = (1 - i)^{13} - 1 \), we express \( 1 \pm i \) in polar form and compute powers, simplifying to \( -65 - 64i \) and \( -65 + 64i \) respectively. Their product is \( (-65)^2 + (64)^2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321 \). Thus, the product is 8321. Taking modulo 1000, the remainder is 321.
