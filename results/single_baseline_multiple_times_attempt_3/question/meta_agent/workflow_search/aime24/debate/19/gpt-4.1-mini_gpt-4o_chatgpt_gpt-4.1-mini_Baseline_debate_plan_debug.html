    <pre>Let $\omega\neq 1$ be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\]
is divided by 1000.

### thinking by Debate Agent ISRB:
To solve this problem, we need to evaluate the product \( \prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k}) \) where \( \omega \) is a 13th root of unity. First, note that \( \omega^k \) are the distinct 13th roots of unity, and \( \omega^{13} = 1 \). The expression \( 2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k} \) can be rewritten using the identity \( \omega^{2k} = (\omega^k)^2 \). Consider the expression \( 2 - 2x + x^2 \) where \( x = \omega^k \). This can be rewritten as \( (x-1)^2 + 1 \). 

Next, substitute \( x = \omega^k \), we have \( (\omega^k - 1)^2 + 1 = \omega^{2k} - 2\omega^k + 2 \). Hence, the product is \( \prod_{k=0}^{12} ((\omega^k - 1)^2 + 1) \).

To evaluate this, note that the polynomial \( x^{13} - 1 = (x-1)(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1) \) has roots \( \omega^k \) for \( k = 0, 1, \ldots, 12 \). The polynomial \( x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1 \) is the minimal polynomial for these roots. Thus, the product \( \prod_{k=0}^{12} (x - \omega^k) = x^{13} - 1 \). By symmetry and properties of roots of unity, the product \( \prod_{k=0}^{12} ((\omega^k - 1)^2 + 1) \) evaluates to a constant value. Specifically, this product is a value that doesn&#39;t depend on the specific \( \omega^k \) but rather on the structure of the polynomial.

To find the specific remainder when divided by 1000, we can evaluate the product modulo 13 and use the Chinese Remainder Theorem. Since \( \omega \) is a 13th root of unity, we have \( \omega^k \equiv 1 \pmod{13} \) for all \( k \), making the expression \( 2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k} \equiv 1 \pmod{13} \). Thus, the product modulo 13 is \( 1^{13} \equiv 1 \pmod{13} \). 

For modulo 8, consider the expression \( 2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k} \equiv 2 - 2 \cdot 1 + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{8} \) as \( \omega^k \equiv 1 \pmod{8} \). Therefore, the product modulo 8 is \( 1^{13} \equiv 1 \pmod{8} \).

Finally, applying the Chinese Remainder Theorem, since the product is congruent to 1 modulo both 13 and 8, it must be congruent to 1 modulo 104. Therefore, the remainder when divided by 1000 is 1.

### thinking by Debate Agent uiq9:
We start by recognizing that \( \omega \) is a 13th root of unity, meaning \( \omega^{13} = 1 \) and the roots are \( 1, \omega, \omega^2, \ldots, \omega^{12} \). We need to evaluate the product \( \prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k}) \). First, simplify the expression inside the product: \( 2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k} = (1 - \omega^k)^2 + \omega^{2k} \). Since \( \omega^k \) are roots of unity, we know that \( 1 - \omega^k \) are roots of the polynomial \( x^{13} - 1 = 0 \). Thus, the polynomial \( (1-x)^2 + x^2 \) evaluated at each \( \omega^k \) will yield the same result for each \( k \). Therefore, the product simplifies to a constant value raised to the 13th power. We need to find this constant and then compute the remainder when divided by 1000. Let \( P(x) = 2 - 2x + x^2 \). The product becomes \( P(1)P(\omega)P(\omega^2)\ldots P(\omega^{12}) \). Notice that for any root \( \omega^k \), \( P(\omega^k) = (1-\omega^k)^2 + \omega^{2k} = (1 - \omega^k)^2 + \omega^{2k} \). Since \( \omega^{13} = 1 \), the expression simplifies to a constant value for each \( k \), and the product of these values is a power of the constant. Calculating the constant value and raising it to the 13th power, then finding the remainder modulo 1000, gives the solution.
