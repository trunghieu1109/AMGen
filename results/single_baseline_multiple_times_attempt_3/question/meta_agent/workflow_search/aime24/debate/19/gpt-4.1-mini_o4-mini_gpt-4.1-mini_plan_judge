Question: Let $\omega\neq 1$ be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\]
is divided by 1000.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: We want ∏_{k=0}^{12}(2−2ω^k+ω^{2k}) where ω runs over 13th roots of unity. Note 2−2x+x^2=x^2−2x+2, whose roots are 1±i. The product over all 13th roots of unity ζ of f(ζ)=Res(x^13−1,f(x))=∏_{α}(α^13−1) where α=1±i. Compute (1+i)^13=(√2 e^{iπ/4})^{13}=2^{6.5}e^{i13π/4}=64·(−1−i)=−64(1+i), so (1+i)^13−1=−65−64i; its conjugate is −65+64i. The product is |−65−64i|^2=65^2+64^2=4225+4096=8321. Therefore the remainder mod 1000 is 8321 mod 1000=321.
