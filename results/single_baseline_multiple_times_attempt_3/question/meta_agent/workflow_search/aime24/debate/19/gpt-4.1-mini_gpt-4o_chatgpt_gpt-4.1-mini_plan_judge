proposed answer: To solve this problem, we need to evaluate the product \( \prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k}) \) where \( \omega \) is a 13th root of unity. First, note that \( \omega^k \) are the distinct 13th roots of unity, and \( \omega^{13} = 1 \). The expression \( 2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k} \) can be rewritten using the identity \( \omega^{2k} = (\omega^k)^2 \). Consider the expression \( 2 - 2x + x^2 \) where \( x = \omega^k \). This can be rewritten as \( (x-1)^2 + 1 \). Next, substitute \( x = \omega^k \), we have \( (\omega^k - 1)^2 + 1 = \omega^{2k} - 2\omega^k + 2 \). Hence, the product is \( \prod_{k=0}^{12} ((\omega^k - 1)^2 + 1) \). To evaluate this, note that the polynomial \( x^{13} - 1 = (x-1)(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1) \) has roots \( \omega^k \) for \( k = 0, 1, \ldots, 12 \). The polynomial \( x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1 \) is the minimal polynomial for these roots. Thus, the product \( \prod_{k=0}^{12} (x - \omega^k) = x^{13} - 1 \). By symmetry and properties of roots of unity, the product \( \prod_{k=0}^{12} ((\omega^k - 1)^2 + 1) \) evaluates to a constant value. Specifically, this product is a value that doesn't depend on the specific \( \omega^k \) but rather on the structure of the polynomial. To find the specific remainder when divided by 1000, we can evaluate the product modulo 13 and use the Chinese Remainder Theorem. Since \( \omega \) is a 13th root of unity, we have \( \omega^k \equiv 1 \pmod{13} \) for all \( k \), making the expression \( 2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k} \equiv 1 \pmod{13} \). Thus, the product modulo 13 is \( 1^{13} \equiv 1 \pmod{13} \). For modulo 8, consider the expression \( 2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k} \equiv 2 - 2 \cdot 1 + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{8} \) as \( \omega^k \equiv 1 \pmod{8} \). Therefore, the product modulo 8 is \( 1^{13} \equiv 1 \pmod{8} \). Finally, applying the Chinese Remainder Theorem, since the product is congruent to 1 modulo both 13 and 8, it must be congruent to 1 modulo 104. Therefore, the remainder when divided by 1000 is 1.
