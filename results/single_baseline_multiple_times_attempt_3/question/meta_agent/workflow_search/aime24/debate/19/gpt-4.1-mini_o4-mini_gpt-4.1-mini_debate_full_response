Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Final Decision Agent iQRb', content='We want ∏_{k=0}^{12}(2−2ω^k+ω^{2k}) where ω runs over 13th roots of unity. Note 2−2x+x^2=x^2−2x+2, whose roots are 1±i. The product over all 13th roots of unity ζ of f(ζ)=Res(x^13−1,f(x))=∏_{α}(α^13−1) where α=1±i.

Set Q(x)=x^2−2x+2 and observe the product over all 13th roots ζ of unity is Res(x^13−1, Q(x)).  Since the resultant is unchanged by swapping factors when the product of degrees is even, Res(x^13−1,Q)=Res(Q,x^13−1).  For Q(x) with roots α=1±i, Res(Q,x^13−1)=∏_{α}(α^13−1).  Now (1+i)^13=(√2 e^{iπ/4})^{13}=2^{6.5} e^{i13π/4}=64·(−1−i)=−64(1+i), so (1+i)^13−1=−64(1+i)−1=−65−64i.  Its conjugate gives the other factor, so the product is |−65−64i|^2=65^2+64^2=4225+4096=8321.  Hence the remainder mod 1000 is 8321 mod 1000=321.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent KMuD:\nWe need P=∏_{k=0..12}(2−2ω^k+ω^{2k}) where ω runs over the 13th roots of unity. Note 2−2x+x^2=f(x) where f(x)=x^2−2x+2 has roots r=1±i. Then P=∏_{ζ^13=1}f(ζ)=∏(ζ−r_1)(ζ−r_2)=g(r_1)g(r_2) where g(x)=x^13−1. Compute (1+i)^13=−64−64i ⇒g(1+i)=(−64−64i)−1=−65−64i. Similarly (1−i)^13=−64+64i ⇒g(1−i)=−65+64i. Thus P=(−65−64i)(−65+64i)=(-65)^2+(64)^2=4225+4096=8321. Finally 8321 mod 1000=321.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent 22Fx:\n321\n\n### answer by Debate Agent KMuD:\n321\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
