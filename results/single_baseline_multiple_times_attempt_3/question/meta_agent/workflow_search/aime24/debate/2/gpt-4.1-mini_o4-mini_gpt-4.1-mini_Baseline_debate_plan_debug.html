    <pre>Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?

### thinking by Debate Agent apQ9:
We need the probability that a random subset B⊆ℤ/8ℤ of “blue” vertices satisfies ∃ nonzero rotation r (1≤r≤7) with B∩(B+r)=∅. Equivalently, letting |B|=t, one shows by casework on t that all subsets of size t≤3 qualify, none of size t≥7 qualify, and for t=4,5,6 exactly 8 of the C(8,t) fail.  Counting qualifiers:
 t=0:1, t=1:8, t=2:28, t=3:56,
 t=4:70−8=62, t=5:56−8=48, t=6:28−8=20, t=7:0, t=8:0;
 total=1+8+28+56+62+48+20=223.  Thus probability=223/256, so m+n=223+256=479.

### thinking by Debate Agent 1N2P:
We need the probability that a random red/blue coloring of the 8 vertices admits a rotation k (including k=0) such that all blue vertices land on originally red positions. Equivalently: for some k, B∩(B+k)=∅, where B is the set of blue vertices. Total colorings =2^8=256. We count “good” colorings by size of B. For |B|=s:– s=0:1 coloring (vacuously good).– s=1:8 (any nonzero k works).– s=2:28. For any pair the forbidden shifts are just the differences, so always at least 5 allowed shifts. – s=3:56. Max 6 forbidden shifts, so ≥1 allowed. – s=4: total C(8,4)=70. We must subtract “bad” 4‐sets whose difference multiset covers all 7 nonzero shifts, giving no allowed k. These are exactly the cyclic difference sets of size 4 in Z/8: there are 4 inequivalent seeds ({0,1,3,7},{2,4,5,6},{0,1,5,7},{2,3,4,6}), each under 8 rotations giving 32 bad sets. Thus good at s=4:70−32=38. By color‐swap symmetry, |B|≥5 contributes same as ≤3: 56+28+8. Summing:1+8+28+56+38+56+28+8+0=223 good. Probability =223/256 in lowest terms, so m+n=223+256=479.

    <pre>We need the probability that a random coloring of the 8 vertices (blue set B) admits a nonzero rotation k such that B and B+k are disjoint. Total colorings = 2^8 = 256. By counting “good” subsets B by size: for |B|=0:1; 1:8; 2:28; 3:56. For |B|=4, total C(8,4)=70. The “bad” 4‐sets (those whose differences cover all nonzero shifts) number 32, so good at size 4:70−32=38. By symmetry, sizes 5,6,7,8 mirror 3,2,1,0 (but 7 and 8 give zero new good). Summing good =1+8+28+56+38+56+28+8 =223. Probability =223/256, so m+n=223+256=479.
