Question: Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: We need the probability that a random coloring of the 8 vertices (blue set B) admits a nonzero rotation k such that B and B+k are disjoint. Total colorings = 2^8 = 256. By counting “good” subsets B by size: for |B|=0:1; 1:8; 2:28; 3:56. For |B|=4, total C(8,4)=70. The “bad” 4‐sets (those whose differences cover all nonzero shifts) number 32, so good at size 4:70−32=38. By symmetry, sizes 5,6,7,8 mirror 3,2,1,0 (but 7 and 8 give zero new good). Summing good =1+8+28+56+38+56+28+8 =223. Probability =223/256, so m+n=223+256=479.
