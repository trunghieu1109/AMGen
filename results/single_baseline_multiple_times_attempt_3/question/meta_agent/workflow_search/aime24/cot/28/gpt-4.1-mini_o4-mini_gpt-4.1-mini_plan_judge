Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: We place the torus so its axis is the z–axis and the sphere is centered at the origin.  The torus is given by (√(x²+y²)−6)²+(z−c)²=9 for some height c, and the sphere by x²+y²+z²=121.  Their external tangency along a circle of radius ρ at height z requires that both equations hold and that their normals be parallel: ∇_torus=λ∇_sphere.  Writing in cylindrical coords (ρ,z) gives
(ρ−6)²+(z−c)²=9,
ρ²+z²=121,
(ρ−6)=λ ρ,
(z−c)=λ z.
From (z−c)=λz and (ρ−6)=λρ we get c=6z/ρ.  Plugging into the torus eqn leads to
(ρ−6)²[1+z²/ρ²]=9⇒(ρ−6)²·(121/ρ²)=9⇒|ρ−6|=(3/11)ρ.
Thus ρ−6=(3/11)ρ⇒ρ=33/4 or ρ−6=−(3/11)ρ⇒ρ=33/7.  The larger radius corresponds to r_i, the smaller to r_o, so
r_i−r_o=33/4−33/7=33·3/28=99/28,
m=99,n=28⇒m+n=127.
