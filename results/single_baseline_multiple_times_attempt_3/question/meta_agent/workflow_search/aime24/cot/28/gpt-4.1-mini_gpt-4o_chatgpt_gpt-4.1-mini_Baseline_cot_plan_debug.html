    <pre>Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

Please think step by step and then solve the task.</pre>

    <pre>To solve the problem, we need to find the radii of the circles along which the torus $T$ is externally tangent to the sphere $S$. The torus $T$ is defined by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis that is 6 units away from the center of the circle. This creates a torus with a major radius (distance from the center of the torus to the center of the tube) of 6 and a minor radius (radius of the tube) of 3. The sphere $S$ has a radius of 11. First, consider the scenario where the torus is tangent to the sphere along an internal circle. The distance from the center of the torus to the center of the sphere is $11 - 3 = 8$. The internal radius $r_i$ is the radius of the smaller circle formed by this tangency, which is the difference between the major radius of the torus and the distance from the center of the torus to the center of the sphere: $r_i = 6 - 8 = -2$, but since a radius can&#39;t be negative, we take the absolute value: $r_i = 2$. Now consider the scenario where the torus is tangent to the sphere along an external circle. The distance from the center of the torus to the center of the sphere is $11 + 3 = 14$. The external radius $r_o$ is the radius of the larger circle formed by this tangency, which is the sum of the major radius of the torus and the distance from the center of the torus to the center of the sphere: $r_o = 14 - 6 = 8$. The difference $r_i - r_o = 2 - 8 = -6$. In the problem, $r_i - r_o$ is given as $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Therefore, $m = -6$ and $n = 1$, but we need positive integers, so we take $m = 6$ and $n = 1$. The sum $m + n = 6 + 1 = 7$.
