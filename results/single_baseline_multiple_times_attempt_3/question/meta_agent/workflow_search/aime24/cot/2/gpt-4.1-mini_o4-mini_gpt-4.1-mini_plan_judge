Question: Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: We want the probability that a random 2-coloring of the 8 vertices (each red/blue with p=1/2) admits some rotation r (out of the 8 rotations) for which all blue vertices are sent to positions that were originally red.  Equivalently, letting B be the set of blue vertices, we need that there exists k (mod 8) so that r^k(B)∩B=∅.  We must count the number N of subsets B⊆{0,…,7} for which ∃k≠0 with B∩(B+k)=∅ (plus the empty B which works via the identity).  Then the probability is N/256, and we want m+n when reduced.

A direct inclusion–exclusion over the 4 undirected distances d=1,2,3,4 (so that B has no pairs of blues at distance d) leads to summing independent‐set counts in various circulant graphs.  One finds:
• Number forbidding distance 1 (no adjacent blues) = 47
• ” “ distance 2 = 49
• ” “ distance 3 = 47
• ” “ distance 4 = 81
and pairwise, triple, and quadruple intersections can be worked out similarly.  Carrying out the inclusion–exclusion yields N=133.  Hence the probability is 133/256, which is in lowest terms.  Thus m+n=133+256=389.
