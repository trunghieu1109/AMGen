    <pre>Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?

Please think step by step and then solve the task.</pre>

    <pre>To solve this problem, we need to consider the symmetries of the octagon and the coloring of its vertices. A regular octagon has 8 vertices, and each can be independently colored red or blue. There are 2^8 total ways to color the octagon.

We are interested in the probability that the octagon can be rotated such that all blue vertices occupy positions that were originally red. This means that the set of blue vertices must be able to match the set of red vertices under some rotation.

Let&#39;s consider the possible rotations. The octagon can be rotated by 0, 45, 90, 135, 180, 225, 270, or 315 degrees, which correspond to 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 positions (in terms of vertices).

For the coloring of the octagon to be invariant under a rotation by k positions, the coloring must be such that every vertex i has the same color as vertex (i+k) mod 8. This is a strict condition, and it implies that the number of blue vertices must equal the number of red vertices.

A key observation is that for the octagon to be able to be rotated such that the blue vertices match the positions of the red vertices, the number of blue and red vertices must be equal. This is because if there is a rotation that maps blue vertices to red positions, then the number of blue vertices must equal the number of red vertices.

Let&#39;s compute the number of colorings where the number of blue vertices equals the number of red vertices. There are 8 vertices, so we need to choose 4 of them to be blue (and the remaining 4 will be red). The number of ways to choose 4 vertices out of 8 to be blue is given by the binomial coefficient C(8, 4).

C(8, 4) = 70.

Now, we need to consider how many of these colorings allow for a rotation that maps blue vertices to red positions. We note that if a coloring is invariant under a rotation, then the number of blue and red vertices must be equal, and the coloring must be such that it can be rotated into itself. This is a very strict condition and implies that the coloring must be uniform in some way.

For a coloring to be invariant under rotation, it must be a repeating pattern that fits within the 8 positions. For example, a pattern like RBRBRBRB (alternating red and blue) is invariant under a 2-position rotation (90 degrees), but not under a 1-position rotation (45 degrees) or any other rotation.

Let&#39;s count the number of colorings that are invariant under each possible rotation:
- 0-position (identity): Any coloring is invariant.
- 1-position: No coloring is invariant (since it requires all vertices to be the same color).
- 2-position: Colorings like RBRBRBRB are invariant.
- 3-position: No coloring is invariant (since it requires all vertices to be the same color).
- 4-position: Colorings like RRRRBBBB are invariant.
- 5-position: No coloring is invariant (since it requires all vertices to be the same color).
- 6-position: Colorings like RBRBRBRB are invariant.
- 7-position: No coloring is invariant (since it requires all vertices to be the same color).

We see that the only non-trivial invariant colorings are for 2-position and 6-position rotations, which correspond to 4 blue and 4 red vertices alternating. There are 2 such patterns: RBRBRBRB and BRBRBRBR.

Thus, out of the 70 colorings where we have 4 blue and 4 red vertices, only 2 allow for a rotation that maps blue vertices to red positions.

The probability is therefore 2/256 (since there are 256 total colorings of the octagon).

This simplifies to 1/128.

Thus, m = 1, n = 128, and m + n = 129.
