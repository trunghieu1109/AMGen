    <pre>We have a list of positive integers with sum 30, unique mode 9, and the median is a positive integer not in the list. Let&#39;s analyze these conditions step-by-step.

1. The sum of the list is 30.
2. The unique mode is 9, meaning 9 appears more times than any other number.
3. The median is a positive integer not in the list.

Since the median is not in the list, the list must have an even number of elements (otherwise the median is an element of the list). Let the list have 2n elements.

The median is the average of the n-th and (n+1)-th elements when the list is sorted.

Since the median is an integer not in the list, the average of the two middle elements is an integer that does not appear in the list.

Letâ€™s try to find such a list with these properties.

Try to find the smallest possible list length.

Try length = 4:
- Median is average of 2nd and 3rd elements.
- Median integer not in list.
- Mode is 9.

If 9 is the mode, it must appear at least twice.

Try example: [a, 9, 9, b], sorted.

Median = (9 + 9)/2 = 9, but 9 is in the list, so median is in the list, violating condition.

Try length = 6:
- Median is average of 3rd and 4th elements.
- Median integer not in list.

Try to arrange list so that median is integer not in list.

Since median = (x + y)/2, x and y are 3rd and 4th elements.

Try to find x and y such that median is integer and median not in list.

Try x=8, y=10, median=9 (integer, not in list if 9 is not in list).

But 9 must be the mode, so 9 must appear more times than any other number.

So 9 appears more times than any other number, but 9 is not in positions 3 or 4.

Try list: [7, 9, 8, 10, 9, 7]
Sorted: [7, 7, 8, 9, 9, 10]
Median = (8 + 9)/2 = 8.5 (not integer), so no.

Try x=9, y=11, median=10 (integer)

Try list: [9, 9, 9, 11, 7, 7]
Sorted: [7, 7, 9, 9, 9, 11]
Median = (9 + 9)/2 = 9 (in list), no.

Try x=8, y=10, median=9
Try list: [9, 9, 8, 10, 1, 3]
Sorted: [1, 3, 8, 9, 9, 10]
Median=(8+9)/2=8.5 no.

Try length = 5:
Median is 3rd element.
Median is integer not in list, so median cannot be an element in the list, so length cannot be odd.

Try length=8:
Median is average of 4th and 5th elements.
Try 4th=8, 5th=10, median=9 (integer), not in list.

So 9 is not in the list at positions 4 or 5.
But 9 must be the mode, so 9 appears more than any other number.

Try list: [9, 9, 9, 8, 10, 1, 1, 2]

Try median=7 (not in list)
So 3rd element=7, but 7 not in list, so 7 is median but not in list, so 7 is not in list.
So 3rd element cannot be 7, contradiction.

Try list length 4 with median not in list
Try list: [9,9,5,7]
Sum=30
Sorted: [5,7,9,9]
Median=(7+9)/2=8 not in list
Mode: 9 twice, others once
Median=8 not in list
This fits all conditions!

Check conditions:
Sum=5+7+9+9=30
Mode=9 unique (appears twice, others once)
Median=(7+9)/2=8 integer not in list
All conditions satisfied.

Now find sum of squares:
5^2=25
7^2=49
9^2=81
9^2=81
Sum=25+49+81+81=236

Answer is 236.
