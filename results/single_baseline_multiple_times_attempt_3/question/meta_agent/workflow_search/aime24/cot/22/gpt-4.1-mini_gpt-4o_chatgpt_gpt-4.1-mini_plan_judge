Question: A list of positive integers has the following properties:
$\bullet$ The sum of the items in the list is $30$.
$\bullet$ The unique mode of the list is $9$.
$\bullet$ The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.
Find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

proposed answer: To solve the problem, we need to construct a list of positive integers that satisfy the given conditions. Let's break down the conditions:

1. The sum of the items in the list is 30.
2. The unique mode of the list is 9, meaning 9 appears more frequently than any other number.
3. The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.

Let's start by considering the mode condition. Since 9 is the mode, it must appear more frequently than any other number. Let's assume 9 appears k times.

For the median to be a positive integer not in the list, the list must have an even number of elements (say 2n elements) so that the median is the average of the two middle numbers. If the list had an odd number of elements, the median would be one of the numbers in the list, which would violate the condition.

Let's try constructing the list step by step:
- Assume 9 appears 3 times (k = 3). This is a reasonable starting point for the mode.
- Let the list have 6 elements (2n = 6) so that the median is the average of the 3rd and 4th elements.

The list is: 9, 9, 9, a, b, c (sorted in non-decreasing order).

The sum is 30: 9 + 9 + 9 + a + b + c = 30, so a + b + c = 3.

The median is (9 + a)/2, which should not be an integer in the list. Since a, b, c must be positive integers, a = 1, b = 1, c = 1 is a possible choice.

So the list is: 1, 1, 1, 9, 9, 9.

The median is (1 + 9)/2 = 5, which is not in the list, satisfying the median condition.

Now, we calculate the sum of the squares of the items in the list:
1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 81 + 81 + 81 = 246.
