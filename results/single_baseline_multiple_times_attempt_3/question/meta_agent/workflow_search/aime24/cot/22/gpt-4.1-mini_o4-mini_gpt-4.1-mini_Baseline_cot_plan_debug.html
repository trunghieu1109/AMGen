    <pre>A list of positive integers has the following properties:
$\bullet$ The sum of the items in the list is $30$.
$\bullet$ The unique mode of the list is $9$.
$\bullet$ The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.
Find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

    <pre>We need a list of positive integers summing to 30, with even length (so the median is the average of the two middle terms), a unique mode of 9, and a median m that is an integer not in the list. Try the smallest even length n=4. Let the list have two 9â€™s (so 9 is the unique mode with count 2&gt; others), and two other distinct positive integers x,y summing to 12 (so total is 18+12=30). The only choice that makes the two middle terms x&lt;y&lt;9 or x&lt;9&lt;y yield an integer median m not in the list is {5,7,9,9}: then the sorted list is 5,7,9,9, the median is (7+9)/2=8 (an integer not in the list), 9 is the unique mode, and the sum is 30. Compute squares sum: 5^2+7^2+9^2+9^2=25+49+81+81=236.
