    <pre>We need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular 12-gon (dodecagon) such that each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Since the dodecagon is regular, its vertices lie on a circle, and the sides and diagonals create a complete graph K_12 on the vertices. Rectangles inscribed in a regular polygon correspond to sets of four vertices forming a rectangle, which means the four vertices must form two pairs of parallel chords of equal length.

Key observations:
1. The dodecagon is regular and inscribed in a circle.
2. All sides and diagonals are chords of the circumcircle.
3. Rectangles inscribed in a circle must be cyclic quadrilaterals with right angles.
4. In a circle, a quadrilateral is a rectangle if and only if its vertices are endpoints of two pairs of chords that are perpendicular.

Since the polygon is regular with 12 vertices, the vertices are at angles 0°, 30°, 60°, ..., 330° around the circle.

A rectangle inscribed in the circle must have vertices such that the arcs between opposite vertices sum to 180°. In other words, the opposite vertices are diametrically opposite or the quadrilateral is a rectangle inscribed in the circle.

More concretely, a rectangle inscribed in a circle is a quadrilateral whose vertices come in pairs of points separated by 180° on the circle. However, in a 12-gon, the vertices are spaced by 30°, so the diametrically opposite vertices are separated by 6 steps (because 6 * 30° = 180°).

Therefore, for a rectangle:
- The two pairs of opposite vertices must be separated by 6 vertices.
- The four vertices are (v, v+k, v+6, v+6+k), where indices are modulo 12, and k is the number of steps between the two vertices on one side of the rectangle.

To form a rectangle, the sides must be perpendicular, which means the chords corresponding to k and 6 must be perpendicular. Since the polygon is regular, the chord from v to v+k makes an angle k * 30°.

For the sides to be perpendicular, the difference in their directions must be 90° modulo 180°.

Check which values of k satisfy this:
- The side from v to v+k is at angle k*30°
- The side from v+k to v+6+k is also at angle 6*30° = 180°, but the direction is reversed, so the sides are parallel.

Actually, the sides of the rectangle are chords of length k and 6 (steps along the polygon).

The rectangle&#39;s sides correspond to chords of lengths k and 6 steps.

The condition for perpendicularity is that the chord corresponding to k steps and the chord corresponding to 6 steps are perpendicular.

In a regular 12-gon, the chord directions are multiples of 30°. The chord of length 6 steps corresponds to the diameter (180°), so it&#39;s along some line, say horizontal.

The chord of length k steps corresponds to angle k*30°.

For sides to be perpendicular, k*30° must be 90° or 270° modulo 360°, so k*30° ≡ 90° (mod 180°).

Solve for k:
- k*30° ≡ 90° (mod 180°)
- k*30° = 90° + 180°m
- k = (90° + 180°m)/30° = 3 + 6m

For m=0, k=3
For m=1, k=9

Since k must be between 1 and 5 (since k and 12-k represent the same chord length), valid values are k=3 and k=9 (which is equivalent to k=3 because 9 steps forward is 3 steps backward).

Therefore, the only valid k is 3.

Now, for each vertex v (0 to 11), the rectangle vertices are:
- v
- v+3
- v+6
- v+9

These 4 vertices form a rectangle.

Since v runs from 0 to 11, but rectangles formed by the same set of vertices are counted once, we must count unique rectangles.

Since shifting v by 12 brings the same rectangle, and shifting by 3 steps cycles through the rectangle vertices, the number of unique rectangles is the number of distinct sets {v, v+3, v+6, v+9} modulo 12.

How many distinct rectangles are there?

The sets are:
- v=0: {0,3,6,9}
- v=1: {1,4,7,10}
- v=2: {2,5,8,11}
- v=3: {3,6,9,0} same as v=0
- v=4: {4,7,10,1} same as v=1
- v=5: {5,8,11,2} same as v=2

So only v=0,1,2 give distinct rectangles.

Hence, there are 3 rectangles formed by vertices.

Are there other rectangles formed by sides and diagonals that do not correspond to vertices only? The problem states that each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon, so the rectangle vertices must be vertices of the polygon (since sides must lie on sides or diagonals connecting vertices).

Therefore, the total number of rectangles is 3.

The diagram shows three such rectangles, confirming the answer.
