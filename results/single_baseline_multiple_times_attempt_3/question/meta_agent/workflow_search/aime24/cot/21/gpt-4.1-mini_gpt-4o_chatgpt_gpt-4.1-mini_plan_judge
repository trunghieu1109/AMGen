Question: Find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon ($12$-gon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The diagram below shows three of those rectangles.
[asy] unitsize(0.6 inch); for(int i=0; i<360; i+=30) { dot(dir(i), 4+black); draw(dir(i)--dir(i+30)); } draw(dir(120)--dir(330)); filldraw(dir(210)--dir(240)--dir(30)--dir(60)--cycle, mediumgray, linewidth(1.5)); draw((0,0.366)--(0.366,0), linewidth(1.5)); [/asy]

proposed answer: To find the number of rectangles that can be formed, we need to consider the vertices of the dodecagon. A rectangle is defined by choosing two pairs of opposite sides or diagonals. The dodecagon has 12 vertices. Each diagonal connects two vertices that are not adjacent, and each side connects two adjacent vertices. We need to count the number of ways to select two pairs of opposite vertices that form the corners of a rectangle. A regular dodecagon has symmetry, and the vertices are evenly spaced. By considering the symmetry and the requirement that opposite sides or diagonals form the rectangle, we can determine the possible configurations of rectangles.
