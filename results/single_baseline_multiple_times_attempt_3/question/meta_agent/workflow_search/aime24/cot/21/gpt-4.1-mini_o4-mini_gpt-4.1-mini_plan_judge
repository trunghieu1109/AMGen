Question: Find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon ($12$-gon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The diagram below shows three of those rectangles.
[asy] unitsize(0.6 inch); for(int i=0; i<360; i+=30) { dot(dir(i), 4+black); draw(dir(i)--dir(i+30)); } draw(dir(120)--dir(330)); filldraw(dir(210)--dir(240)--dir(30)--dir(60)--cycle, mediumgray, linewidth(1.5)); draw((0,0.366)--(0.366,0), linewidth(1.5)); [/asy]

proposed answer: Label the 12 vertices around the circle 0–11.  Any rectangle inscribed in a circle has its diagonals intersecting at the center, so both diagonals must be diameters of the circle.  Thus the four vertices of the rectangle form two antipodal pairs.  There are 6 antipodal pairs among 12 points, and we must choose 2 of them to be the rectangle’s pairs.  Hence the number of rectangles is C(6,2)=15.
