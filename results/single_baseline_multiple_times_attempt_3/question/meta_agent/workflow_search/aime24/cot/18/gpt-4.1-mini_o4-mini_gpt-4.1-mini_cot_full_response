Question: Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). Then \(OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\).\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent qBcE', content='We parameterize each segment in F by its x‐intercept t≥0 and y‐intercept u≥0 satisfying t^2+u^2=1, so the line is x/t+y/u=1.  The fixed segment AB has endpoints A=(1/2,0), B=(0,√3/2), corresponding to t=1/2, u=√3/2.  A point C on AB (with 2x+2y/√3=1) lies also on some other segment iff the equation x/t+y/√(1−t^2)=1 has a second solution t≠1/2.  Uniqueness occurs exactly when t=1/2 is a double root, i.e. f(t)=x/t+y/(√(1−t^2)) satisfies f(1/2)=1 and f′(1/2)=0.  Computing f′(t)=−x/t^2 + y t/(1−t^2)^(3/2), setting t=1/2 gives −4x + (4y)/(3√3)=0 ⇒ x=y/(3√3).  Together with 2x+2y/√3=1 yields y=3√3/8, x=1/8.  Hence OC^2=(1/8)^2+(3√3/8)^2=7/16, so p+q=7+16=23.\n\nAnswer:23', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
