Question: Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). Then \(OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\).

proposed answer: To solve this problem, we need to find the unique point C on segment \(\overline{AB}\) such that \(C\) is not on any segment \(\overline{PQ}\) from the family \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). The line segment \(\overline{AB}\) has endpoints \(A = \left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right)\) and \(B = \left(0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\). The equation of line \(\overline{AB}\) is found using the two-point form: \(y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\). A point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\) can be parameterized as \(C = \left(\frac{1}{2}(1-t), \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t\right)\) for \(0 < t < 1\). For \(C\) to lie on a segment \(\overline{PQ}\), we must have \(P = (a, 0)\) and \(Q = (0, b)\) such that \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\) and \(C\) satisfies \(x_C = a\) and \(y_C = b\). Substituting \(x_C = \frac{1}{2}(1-t)\) and \(y_C = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t\), we get \(\left(\frac{1}{2}(1-t)\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t\right)^2 = 1\). Simplifying, this equation becomes \(\frac{1}{4}(1-t)^2 + \frac{3}{4}t^2 = 1\). Solving for \(t\), we get \(1 - t + t^2 = 1\), which simplifies to \(t(t-1) = 0\). The solutions are \(t = 0\) or \(t = 1\), but these correspond to points \(A\) and \(B\), respectively. Thus, the unique point \(C\) that satisfies the requirement is \(C = \left(\frac{1}{4}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}\right)\). Now, we compute \(OC^2 = \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{16} + \frac{3}{16} = \frac{4}{16} = \frac{1}{4}\). Therefore, \(OC^2 = \frac{1}{4}\), and \(p = 1\) and \(q = 4\), so \(p + q = 5\).
