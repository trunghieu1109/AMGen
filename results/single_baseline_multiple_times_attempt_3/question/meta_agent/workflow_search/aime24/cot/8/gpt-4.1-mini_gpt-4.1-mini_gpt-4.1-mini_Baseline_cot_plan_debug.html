    <pre>Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice&#39;s play.

    <pre>We have a game where two players, Alice and Bob, alternate removing either 1 or 4 tokens from a stack of n tokens. Alice goes first. The player who takes the last token wins. We want to find the number of positive integers n ≤ 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy regardless of Alice&#39;s moves. This means that the initial position is losing for Alice (the first player).

Let&#39;s analyze the game using the concept of winning and losing positions:
- A losing position is one where the player to move has no winning strategy (i.e., any move leads to a winning position for the opponent).
- A winning position is one where the player to move can force a win.

Define positions by the number of tokens remaining:
- n = 0: losing position (no tokens to take, so the player to move loses)

For n &gt; 0:
- A position is winning if there exists a move to a losing position.
- Otherwise, it is losing.

Let&#39;s compute the positions for small n:

n=0: losing (L)

n=1: can remove 1 token to reach n=0 (L), so n=1 is winning (W)

n=2: moves:
  - remove 1 -&gt; n=1 (W)
  - remove 4 -&gt; not possible
All moves lead to W, so n=2 is losing (L)

n=3:
  - remove 1 -&gt; n=2 (L)
  - remove 4 -&gt; not possible
At least one move to L, so n=3 is winning (W)

n=4:
  - remove 1 -&gt; n=3 (W)
  - remove 4 -&gt; n=0 (L)
At least one move to L, so n=4 is winning (W)

n=5:
  - remove 1 -&gt; n=4 (W)
  - remove 4 -&gt; n=1 (W)
All moves lead to W, so n=5 is losing (L)

n=6:
  - remove 1 -&gt; n=5 (L)
  - remove 4 -&gt; n=2 (L)
At least one move to L, so n=6 is winning (W)

n=7:
  - remove 1 -&gt; n=6 (W)
  - remove 4 -&gt; n=3 (W)
All moves lead to W, so n=7 is losing (L)

n=8:
  - remove 1 -&gt; n=7 (L)
  - remove 4 -&gt; n=4 (W)
At least one move to L, so n=8 is winning (W)

n=9:
  - remove 1 -&gt; n=8 (W)
  - remove 4 -&gt; n=5 (L)
At least one move to L, so n=9 is winning (W)

n=10:
  - remove 1 -&gt; n=9 (W)
  - remove 4 -&gt; n=6 (W)
All moves lead to W, so n=10 is losing (L)

From this, the losing positions are:
0, 2, 5, 7, 10

Let&#39;s check if there&#39;s a pattern. The losing positions are:
0, 2, 5, 7, 10

Check differences:
2 - 0 = 2
5 - 2 = 3
7 - 5 = 2
10 - 7 = 3

It seems the losing positions alternate between adding 2 and 3.
Let&#39;s continue:

n=11:
  - remove 1 -&gt; n=10 (L)
  - remove 4 -&gt; n=7 (L)
At least one move to L, so n=11 is winning (W)

n=12:
  - remove 1 -&gt; n=11 (W)
  - remove 4 -&gt; n=8 (W)
All moves lead to W, so n=12 is losing (L)

n=13:
  - remove 1 -&gt; n=12 (L)
  - remove 4 -&gt; n=9 (W)
At least one move to L, so n=13 is winning (W)

n=14:
  - remove 1 -&gt; n=13 (W)
  - remove 4 -&gt; n=10 (L)
At least one move to L, so n=14 is winning (W)

n=15:
  - remove 1 -&gt; n=14 (W)
  - remove 4 -&gt; n=11 (W)
All moves lead to W, so n=15 is losing (L)

Losing positions so far: 0, 2, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15

Check differences:
2-0=2
5-2=3
7-5=2
10-7=3
12-10=2
15-12=3

So losing positions follow the pattern:
start at 0, then add 2, then add 3, then add 2, then add 3, and so on.

This sequence can be described as losing positions:
0, 2, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, 17, 20, 22, ...

Since the pattern is +2, +3 alternately, the losing positions are numbers congruent to 0 or 2 modulo 5, shifted appropriately.

Check modulo 5 for losing positions:
0 mod 5 = 0
2 mod 5 = 2
5 mod 5 = 0
7 mod 5 = 2
10 mod 5 = 0
12 mod 5 = 2
15 mod 5 = 0
17 mod 5 = 2
20 mod 5 = 0
22 mod 5 = 2

So losing positions are exactly those where n mod 5 is 0 or 2.

Since the initial position is losing for the first player (Alice) if n mod 5 = 0 or 2, Bob has a winning strategy if and only if n mod 5 = 0 or 2.

We want to count positive integers n ≤ 2024 such that n mod 5 = 0 or 2.

Count numbers ≤ 2024 congruent to 0 mod 5:
These are 5, 10, 15, ..., 2020
Number of terms = floor(2024/5) = 404

Count numbers ≤ 2024 congruent to 2 mod 5:
These are 2, 7, 12, ..., up to the largest number ≤ 2024 with remainder 2.
The largest number ≤ 2024 with remainder 2 mod 5 is 2022 (since 2022 mod 5 = 2).
Number of terms = floor((2022 - 2)/5) + 1 = floor(2020/5) + 1 = 404 + 1 = 405

Total numbers for which Bob has a winning strategy = 404 + 405 = 809.
