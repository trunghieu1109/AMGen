Question: Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: We have a game where two players, Alice and Bob, alternate removing either 1 or 4 tokens from a stack of n tokens. Alice goes first. The player who takes the last token wins. We want to find the number of positive integers n ≤ 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy regardless of Alice's moves. This means that the initial position is losing for Alice (the first player).

Let's analyze the game using the concept of winning and losing positions:
- A losing position is one where the player to move has no winning strategy (i.e., any move leads to a winning position for the opponent).
- A winning position is one where the player to move can force a win.

Define positions by the number of tokens remaining:
- n = 0: losing position (no tokens to take, so the player to move loses)

For n > 0:
- A position is winning if there exists a move to a losing position.
- Otherwise, it is losing.

Let's compute the positions for small n:

n=0: losing (L)

n=1: can remove 1 token to reach n=0 (L), so n=1 is winning (W)

n=2: moves:
  - remove 1 -> n=1 (W)
  - remove 4 -> not possible
All moves lead to W, so n=2 is losing (L)

n=3:
  - remove 1 -> n=2 (L)
  - remove 4 -> not possible
At least one move to L, so n=3 is winning (W)

n=4:
  - remove 1 -> n=3 (W)
  - remove 4 -> n=0 (L)
At least one move to L, so n=4 is winning (W)

n=5:
  - remove 1 -> n=4 (W)
  - remove 4 -> n=1 (W)
All moves lead to W, so n=5 is losing (L)

n=6:
  - remove 1 -> n=5 (L)
  - remove 4 -> n=2 (L)
At least one move to L, so n=6 is winning (W)

n=7:
  - remove 1 -> n=6 (W)
  - remove 4 -> n=3 (W)
All moves lead to W, so n=7 is losing (L)

n=8:
  - remove 1 -> n=7 (L)
  - remove 4 -> n=4 (W)
At least one move to L, so n=8 is winning (W)

n=9:
  - remove 1 -> n=8 (W)
  - remove 4 -> n=5 (L)
At least one move to L, so n=9 is winning (W)

n=10:
  - remove 1 -> n=9 (W)
  - remove 4 -> n=6 (W)
All moves lead to W, so n=10 is losing (L)

From this, the losing positions are:
0, 2, 5, 7, 10

Let's check if there's a pattern. The losing positions are:
0, 2, 5, 7, 10

Check differences:
2 - 0 = 2
5 - 2 = 3
7 - 5 = 2
10 - 7 = 3

It seems the losing positions alternate between adding 2 and 3.
Let's continue:

n=11:
  - remove 1 -> n=10 (L)
  - remove 4 -> n=7 (L)
At least one move to L, so n=11 is winning (W)

n=12:
  - remove 1 -> n=11 (W)
  - remove 4 -> n=8 (W)
All moves lead to W, so n=12 is losing (L)

n=13:
  - remove 1 -> n=12 (L)
  - remove 4 -> n=9 (W)
At least one move to L, so n=13 is winning (W)

n=14:
  - remove 1 -> n=13 (W)
  - remove 4 -> n=10 (L)
At least one move to L, so n=14 is winning (W)

n=15:
  - remove 1 -> n=14 (W)
  - remove 4 -> n=11 (W)
All moves lead to W, so n=15 is losing (L)

Losing positions so far: 0, 2, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15

Check differences:
2-0=2
5-2=3
7-5=2
10-7=3
12-10=2
15-12=3

So losing positions follow the pattern:
start at 0, then add 2, then add 3, then add 2, then add 3, and so on.

This sequence can be described as losing positions:
0, 2, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, 17, 20, 22, ...

Since the pattern is +2, +3 alternately, the losing positions are numbers congruent to 0 or 2 modulo 5, shifted appropriately.

Check modulo 5 for losing positions:
0 mod 5 = 0
2 mod 5 = 2
5 mod 5 = 0
7 mod 5 = 2
10 mod 5 = 0
12 mod 5 = 2
15 mod 5 = 0
17 mod 5 = 2
20 mod 5 = 0
22 mod 5 = 2

So losing positions are exactly those where n mod 5 is 0 or 2.

Since the initial position is losing for the first player (Alice) if n mod 5 = 0 or 2, Bob has a winning strategy if and only if n mod 5 = 0 or 2.

We want to count positive integers n ≤ 2024 such that n mod 5 = 0 or 2.

Count numbers ≤ 2024 congruent to 0 mod 5:
These are 5, 10, 15, ..., 2020
Number of terms = floor(2024/5) = 404

Count numbers ≤ 2024 congruent to 2 mod 5:
These are 2, 7, 12, ..., up to the largest number ≤ 2024 with remainder 2.
The largest number ≤ 2024 with remainder 2 mod 5 is 2022 (since 2022 mod 5 = 2).
Number of terms = floor((2022 - 2)/5) + 1 = floor(2020/5) + 1 = 404 + 1 = 405

Total numbers for which Bob has a winning strategy = 404 + 405 = 809.
