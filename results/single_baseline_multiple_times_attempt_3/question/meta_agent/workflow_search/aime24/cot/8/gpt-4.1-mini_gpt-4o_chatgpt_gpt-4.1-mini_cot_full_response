Question: Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent CN4I', content='In combinatorial games like this one, we determine winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the player whose turn it is can force a win with optimal play. A losing position is one where no matter what the player whose turn it is does, the opponent can force a win. We start by analyzing small values of n. If n = 1, Alice wins by taking 1 token. If n = 2, Alice takes 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob, and Alice wins. If n = 3, Alice takes 1 token, leaving 2 for Bob, and Alice wins. If n = 4, Alice can take all 4 tokens and win. If n = 5, Alice can take 4 tokens, leaving 1 for Bob, and Alice wins. This pattern suggests that positions 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are winning for Alice. Now, consider n = 6. If Alice takes 1 token, n becomes 5, which is winning for Alice, so Bob wins. If Alice takes 4 tokens, n becomes 2, which is also winning for Alice, so Bob wins. Thus, 6 is a losing position for Alice, and a winning position for Bob. Continuing this process, we find that positions 6, 11, 16, 21, etc., are losing positions for Alice and winning for Bob. These positions are of the form 6 + 5k for k = 0, 1, 2, ... To find how many such positions are less than or equal to 2024, we solve 6 + 5k <= 2024, which gives k <= 405. Thus, there are 406 such positions.\n\nAnswer:406', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
