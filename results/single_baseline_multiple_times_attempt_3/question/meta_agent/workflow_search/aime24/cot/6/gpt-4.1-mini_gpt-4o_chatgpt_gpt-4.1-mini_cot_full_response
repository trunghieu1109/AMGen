Question: Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent qihk', content='To find the value of r^2, we need to determine the dimensions of the box that maximizes the diagonal, as the sphere must contain the entire box. Given the constraints of surface area and volume, we can express the dimensions in terms of variables and solve for the maximum diagonal. Then, we find the radius of the sphere that encloses this diagonal, which is half the diagonal length. Finally, we square this radius and express it as a fraction in simplest terms, summing the numerator and denominator to get the final result.\n\nAnswer:77', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
