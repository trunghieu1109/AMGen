Question: Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.

proposed answer: We want the smallest sphere radius r that can contain any box with surface area S=54 and volume V=23. A box with edges a,b,c has surface area 2(ab+bc+ca)=54 ⇒ ab+bc+ca=27 and abc=23. Its circumscribing sphere has radius r =½√(a²+b²+c²), so r²=(a²+b²+c²)/4. To cover all such boxes we take the maximum of (a²+b²+c²)/4 under the constraints.  For fixed s2=ab+bc+ca and s3=abc, the maximum of s1=a+b+c occurs when two variables are equal (double root of the cubic), say a=b=x, c=y. From x²y=23 and x²+2xy=27 we get x³−27x+46=0 with positive roots x=2 or x=−1+2√6≈3.898. The larger s1 arises from x=2 giving y=23/4=5.75 and s1=2·2+5.75=39/4. Then a²+b²+c²=s1²−2s2=(39/4)²−54=(1521/16−864/16)=657/16, so r²=(657/16)/4=657/64. Thus p+q=657+64=721.
