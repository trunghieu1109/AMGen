Question: Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: To solve the problem, we start by considering the greatest four-digit integer, which is 9999. We need to find the greatest such number N where changing any one of its digits to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. Let's consider N = 9999 and change each digit to 1 one by one:

1. Change the thousands digit: 1999
2. Change the hundreds digit: 9199
3. Change the tens digit: 9919
4. Change the units digit: 9991

We need to check which of these numbers are divisible by 7. We calculate the remainder of each when divided by 7:

1. 1999 mod 7 = 2
2. 9199 mod 7 = 5
3. 9919 mod 7 = 1
4. 9991 mod 7 = 0

Only 9991 is divisible by 7.

Therefore, the greatest four-digit integer N is 9991. Now, we need to find Q and R where N = 9991, and N = 1000Q + R. Here, Q is the quotient and R is the remainder when N is divided by 1000.

9991 divided by 1000 gives a quotient of 9 and a remainder of 991.

Thus, Q = 9 and R = 991. We need to find Q + R = 9 + 991.

Answer:1000
Extracted answer: 1000
Correct answer: 699
