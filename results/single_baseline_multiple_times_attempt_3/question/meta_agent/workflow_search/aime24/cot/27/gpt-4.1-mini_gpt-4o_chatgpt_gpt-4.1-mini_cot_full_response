Question: Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent YjIF', content="To solve the problem, we start by considering the greatest four-digit integer, which is 9999. We need to find the greatest such number N where changing any one of its digits to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. Let's consider N = 9999 and change each digit to 1 one by one:\n\n1. Change the thousands digit: 1999\n2. Change the hundreds digit: 9199\n3. Change the tens digit: 9919\n4. Change the units digit: 9991\n\nWe need to check which of these numbers are divisible by 7. We calculate the remainder of each when divided by 7:\n\n1. 1999 mod 7 = 2\n2. 9199 mod 7 = 5\n3. 9919 mod 7 = 1\n4. 9991 mod 7 = 0\n\nOnly 9991 is divisible by 7.\n\nTherefore, the greatest four-digit integer N is 9991. Now, we need to find Q and R where N = 9991, and N = 1000Q + R. Here, Q is the quotient and R is the remainder when N is divided by 1000.\n\n9991 divided by 1000 gives a quotient of 9 and a remainder of 991.\n\nThus, Q = 9 and R = 991. We need to find Q + R = 9 + 991.\n\nAnswer:1000", prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
