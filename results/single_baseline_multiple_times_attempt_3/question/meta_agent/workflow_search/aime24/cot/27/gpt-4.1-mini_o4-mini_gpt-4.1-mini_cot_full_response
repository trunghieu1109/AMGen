Question: Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent SW5e', content='We need the greatest four‐digit N=abcd such that replacing any one digit by 1 yields a multiple of 7. Write the four resulting numbers M1…M4 and impose those ≡0 mod 7. One finds congruences N≡6(a–1)≡2(b–1)≡3(c–1)≡(d–1)=k mod 7. Solving gives base digits depending on k=0…6, then we can add 7 where possible (since adding 7 to any digit shifts N by a multiple of 7 and preserves the divisibility conditions) to maximize N. The maximal candidate is N=9437 (k=6). Then dividing by 1000 gives quotient Q=9 and remainder R=437, so Q+R=446.\n\nAnswer:446', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
