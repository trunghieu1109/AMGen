Question: Let $p$ be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $n^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$. Find the least positive integer $m$ such that $m^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$.\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent cnsP', content='We seek the smallest prime p for which n^4+1≡0 mod p^2 has a solution. First p must divide some n^4+1 so (−1) is a 4th power mod p, forcing p≡1 mod8. Testing in order: p=17 works (one finds solutions mod17 and shows they lift via Hensel’s lemma to mod17^2). Smaller primes fail. Thus p=17. Next we lift the four solutions a≡2,15,8,9 (mod17) to solutions N≡a−17·u·(4a^3)^{-1} (mod289) where u=(a^4+1)/17 mod17. These lifts are N=155,134,110,179 (mod289). The least positive is 110.\n\nAnswer:110', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
