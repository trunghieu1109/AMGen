Question: Find the number of triples of nonnegative integers \((a,b,c)\) satisfying \(a + b + c = 300\) and
\begin{equation*}
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.
\end{equation*}\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent KYb7', content='We rewrite the symmetric sum as ∑_{i≠j} i^2j = S∑i^2 − ∑i^3 with S=a+b+c=300.  Setting this equal to 6,000,000 and using ∑i^2=S^2−2P and ∑i^3=S^3−3SP+3Q (where P=ab+bc+ca, Q=abc) leads to 100P−Q=2,000,000.  Substitute a=100−A, etc., so that A+B+C=0.  One finds the condition reduces to ABC=0.  Thus one of A,B,C is zero and the other two are opposite integers t,−t with |t|≤100.  Each choice of which coordinate is zero gives 201 ordered triples, for 3⋅201=603, but the triple (100,100,100) is counted three times, so there are 603−2=601 distinct ordered solutions.\n\nAnswer:601', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
