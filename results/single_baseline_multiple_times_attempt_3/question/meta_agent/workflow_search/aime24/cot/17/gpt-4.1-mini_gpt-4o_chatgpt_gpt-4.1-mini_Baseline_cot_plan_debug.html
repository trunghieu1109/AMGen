    <pre>We need to find the number of nonnegative integer triples (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 and a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000. Let&#39;s analyze the conditions. The first condition, a + b + c = 300, defines a plane in the space of nonnegative integers. The second condition is symmetric in a, b, and c. If we consider the expression a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b, it can be rewritten as a^2(b+c) + b^2(a+c) + c^2(a+b). Using the first condition, we have b+c = 300-a, a+c = 300-b, and a+b = 300-c. Substituting these into the expression, we get a^2(300-a) + b^2(300-b) + c^2(300-c) = 6,000,000. This is a complex equation to solve directly, but we can try specific values for a, b, and c to see if they satisfy both conditions. One approach is to test symmetric solutions where a = b = c, or where two of the variables are equal. Let&#39;s start by testing a = b = c, which gives 3a = 300, so a = b = c = 100. Substituting into the second condition, we get 100^2(200) + 100^2(200) + 100^2(200) = 3 * 100^2 * 200 = 6,000,000, which satisfies the equation. So, (100, 100, 100) is a solution. Now, let&#39;s check if there are other solutions by considering cases where two of the variables are equal and the third is different. For example, let a = b = x and c = 300 - 2x. Substituting into the second condition, we get x^2(300-x) + x^2(300-x) + (300-2x)^2x = 6,000,000. Simplifying, we find 2x^2(300-x) + (300-2x)^2x = 6,000,000. This is a cubic equation in x, which is generally difficult to solve analytically, but we can test integer values of x. Since a = b = 100 gives a solution, we should test values around 100. Testing x = 100, we already found a solution. Testing x = 99, we get 2*99^2(201) + (300-2*99)^2*99 = 2*9801*201 + 102^2*99 = 3942180 + 10201*99 = 3942180 + 1009899 = 4952079, which does not satisfy the equation. Similarly, testing x = 101, we find it does not satisfy the equation either. Due to the symmetry and the specific nature of the problem, it is likely that (100, 100, 100) is the only solution. Therefore, the number of solutions is 1.
