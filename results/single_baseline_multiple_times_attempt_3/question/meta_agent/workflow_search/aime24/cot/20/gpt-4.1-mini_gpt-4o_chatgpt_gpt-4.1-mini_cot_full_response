Question: Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent i2yg', content="To solve this problem, we need to find a base b such that there are more than 10 positive integers n that are b-beautiful. A b-beautiful integer n has two digits in base b, say d1 and d0, such that n = d1*b + d0 and d1 + d0 = sqrt(n). The condition for n to be b-beautiful is that d1 and d0 are digits in base b, i.e., 0 <= d0 < b and 1 <= d1 < b. Also, n must be a perfect square because sqrt(n) must be an integer. We need to count how many such n exist for a given b. Let's start by considering b = 10 and increase b until we find a base with more than 10 b-beautiful integers.\n\nAnswer:13", prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
