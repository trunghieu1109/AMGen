Question: Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent Zkgl', content='We need count of s in [ceil(sqrt(b)),b-1] with (b-1)|s(s-1).  Writing m=b-1, for each prime power dividing m, s must be ≡0 or1 mod that prime power.  By CRT there are 2^{(#prime powers)} residue‐classes mod m.  All but the two trivial classes (s≡0 or1 mod m) give valid s≥ceil(√(m+1)).  To exceed 10 solutions we need 2^{d}−2>10 ⇒2^{d}>12⇒d≥4.  The smallest m with at least 4 prime‐power factors is m=2·3·5·7=210, so b=m+1=211.\n\nAnswer:211', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
