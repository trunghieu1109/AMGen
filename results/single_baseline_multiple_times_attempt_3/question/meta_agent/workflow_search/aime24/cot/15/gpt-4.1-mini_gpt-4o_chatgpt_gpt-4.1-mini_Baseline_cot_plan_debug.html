    <pre>We are given that there are 900 residents in Aimeville, and each owns a bag of candy hearts. Let&#39;s denote the sets as follows: D for diamond ring owners, G for golf club owners, and S for garden spade owners. We have the following information: |D| = 195, |G| = 367, |S| = 562, |D ∩ G ∩ S| = 234 (those who own all three items). There are 437 residents who own exactly two of the items, and we need to find the number who own all four items, including the candy hearts. Since each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, the problem simplifies to finding the number who own all three of the other items. We use the principle of inclusion-exclusion and the given numbers to find this. Let x be the number of people who own all three items (D, G, S). We have the equation: 195 + 367 + 562 - (sum of those owning exactly two) - 2x = 900 - 234. The sum of those owning exactly two items is 437, and those owning exactly three is 234. Therefore, the equation becomes: 195 + 367 + 562 - 437 - 2x = 666. Solving for x gives x = 234. However, we need to find those owning all four things, which is the same as those owning all three since everyone owns the candy hearts. Thus, the number of residents who own all four things is 234.
