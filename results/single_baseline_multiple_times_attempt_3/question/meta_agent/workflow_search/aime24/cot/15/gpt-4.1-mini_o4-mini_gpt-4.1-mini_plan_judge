Question: Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: Let the four items be D (diamond), G (golf), S (spade), C (candy). Every resident has C, so C=900. Given: |D|=195, |G|=367, |S|=562, |C|=900. Let x_k be number owning exactly k items. We know x_2=437, x_3=234, x_4=N (unknown). Then x_1 = 900 - (x_2+x_3+x_4) = 900 - (437+234+N) = 229 - N.

Sum of item-ownership counts =195+367+562+900=2024. But also equals ∑(k * x_k) =1*(229−N)+2*437+3*234+4N = (229−N)+874+702+4N =1805+3N.  
Set 1805+3N =2024 ⇒3N=219 ⇒N=73.
