Question: Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: Let's denote the sets as follows:
D = set of residents who own a diamond ring = 195
G = set of residents who own golf clubs = 367
S = set of residents who own a garden spade = 562
C = set of residents who own a bag of candy hearts = 900 (since every resident owns candy hearts)

We are given:
- Total residents, N = 900
- Number of residents who own exactly two of these things = 437
- Number of residents who own exactly three of these things = 234

We want to find the number of residents who own all four things.

Since every resident owns candy hearts, owning candy hearts is universal. So every resident owns at least one thing (candy hearts).

Let's consider the number of things owned by each resident:
- Exactly 1 thing
- Exactly 2 things = 437
- Exactly 3 things = 234
- Exactly 4 things = x (unknown)

Since total residents = 900,
Number with exactly 1 thing = 900 - (437 + 234 + x) = 900 - 671 - x = 229 - x

Now, let's count the total number of 'ownerships' of items. Each person with exactly 1 thing contributes 1 ownership, with exactly 2 things contributes 2 ownerships, with exactly 3 things contributes 3 ownerships, and with exactly 4 things contributes 4 ownerships.

Total ownerships = (1)*(229 - x) + (2)*437 + (3)*234 + (4)*x
= 229 - x + 874 + 702 + 4x
= (229 + 874 + 702) + (-x + 4x)
= 1805 + 3x

On the other hand, the total ownerships can also be calculated by summing the numbers of owners of each item:
D + G + S + C = 195 + 367 + 562 + 900 = 2024

Equating both expressions for total ownerships:
1805 + 3x = 2024
3x = 2024 - 1805 = 219
x = 219 / 3 = 73

Therefore, the number of residents who own all four things is 73.

Answer:73
Extracted answer: 73
Correct answer: 073
