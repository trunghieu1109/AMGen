Question: Rectangles $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are drawn such that $D,E,C,F$ are collinear. Also, $A,D,H,G$ all lie on a circle. If $BC=16$,$AB=107$,$FG=17$, and $EF=184$, what is the length of $CE$?
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: Let’s place rectangle ABCD with A=(0,0), B=(107,0), C=(107,16), D=(0,16). Since D,E,C,F are collinear and BC∥AD is vertical, that line is horizontal y=16.  Rectangle EFGH has EF=184 on that line, so let E=(x,16), F=(x+184,16).  FG=17 vertical, so H=(x,16±17).  The circle through A,D,H must also pass through G=(x+184,16±17).  Writing the circle equation x²+y²+ax−16y=0 (c=0, b=−16), imposing H and then G lead to a=−2x−184 and x²+184x−561=0.  The positive-integer solution with E between D(0) and C(107) is x=3.  Thus CE=107−3=104.
