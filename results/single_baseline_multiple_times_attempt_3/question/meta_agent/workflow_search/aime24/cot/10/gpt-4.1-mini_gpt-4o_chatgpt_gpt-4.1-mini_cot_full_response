Question: Rectangles $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are drawn such that $D,E,C,F$ are collinear. Also, $A,D,H,G$ all lie on a circle. If $BC=16$,$AB=107$,$FG=17$, and $EF=184$, what is the length of $CE$?\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent BLVz', content='We are given two rectangles ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear and the points A, D, H, G are on a circle. We need to find the length of CE. Since D, E, C, F are collinear, CE is the distance between points C and E along the line that contains D, E, C, F. We have the lengths BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. The rectangles are positioned such that the sides are either parallel or perpendicular to each other. Since BC = 16 and EF = 184, and these are sides of the rectangles parallel to each other, the total length of CE, which spans from C to E, can be found by adding these lengths together. Hence, CE = BC + EF = 16 + 184 = 200.\n\nAnswer:200', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
