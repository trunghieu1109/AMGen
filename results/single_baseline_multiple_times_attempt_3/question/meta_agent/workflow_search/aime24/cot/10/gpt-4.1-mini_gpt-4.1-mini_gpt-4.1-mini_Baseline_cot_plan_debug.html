    <pre>We have two rectangles ABCD and EFGH. Given that D, E, C, F are collinear and A, D, H, G lie on a circle. We know the dimensions of the rectangles: AB = 107, BC = 16 for rectangle ABCD and EF = 184, FG = 17 for rectangle EFGH. Since ABCD is a rectangle, AB is length and BC is width. Similarly, EF is length and FG is width. The points D, E, C, F are collinear. Let&#39;s place rectangle ABCD in the coordinate plane for clarity. Let A = (0,0), B = (107,0), C = (107,16), D = (0,16). Now, rectangle EFGH has EF = 184 and FG = 17. Since D, E, C, F are collinear, and points D and C are at (0,16) and (107,16) respectively, the line containing D, E, C, F must be horizontal at y=16. So points E and F lie on the line y=16. Since EF = 184, and E and F lie on y=16, the x-coordinates of E and F differ by 184. Also, FG is vertical because EFGH is a rectangle. So if F = (x_F,16), then G = (x_F, 16 - 17) = (x_F, -1). Similarly, H is at (x_E, -1). Given that A, D, H, G lie on a circle. We have: A = (0,0), D = (0,16), H = (x_E, -1), G = (x_F, -1). We want to find CE = distance between C(107,16) and E(x_E,16) = |107 - x_E|. Since D, E, C, F are collinear and on y=16, and EF=184, so |x_F - x_E| = 184. Also, F and C are on y=16, so x_F and x_C=107. So F is at (x_F,16) and C is at (107,16). Since D, E, C, F are collinear (on y=16), and points D(0,16), C(107,16), E(x_E,16), F(x_F,16) are on the same line, their x-coordinates are along the real line. EF=184 means |x_F - x_E|=184. Also, FG=17 means G is 17 units vertically below F, so G=(x_F, -1). H is vertically below E, H=(x_E, -1). Now, A(0,0), D(0,16), H(x_E, -1), G(x_F, -1) lie on a circle. Let&#39;s find the circle passing through these four points. The circle passes through A(0,0) and D(0,16). The center must lie on the perpendicular bisector of AD. The midpoint of AD is (0,8). The segment AD is vertical, so its perpendicular bisector is horizontal line y=8. So the center is at (h,8) for some h. The circle passes through A(0,0), so distance from center (h,8) to A is sqrt((0 - h)^2 + (0 - 8)^2) = sqrt(h^2 + 64). Similarly, the circle passes through H(x_E, -1), so distance from center (h,8) to H is sqrt((x_E - h)^2 + (-1 - 8)^2) = sqrt((x_E - h)^2 + 81). Since both distances are equal (radius), we have: h^2 + 64 = (x_E - h)^2 + 81. Expand: h^2 + 64 = x_E^2 - 2h x_E + h^2 + 81. Subtract h^2 from both sides: 64 = x_E^2 - 2h x_E + 81. Rearranged: x_E^2 - 2h x_E + 17 = 0. Similarly, the circle passes through G(x_F, -1), so: distance from center (h,8) to G: sqrt((x_F - h)^2 + (-1 - 8)^2) = sqrt((x_F - h)^2 + 81). This must equal radius sqrt(h^2 + 64), so: h^2 + 64 = (x_F - h)^2 + 81. Similarly: 64 = x_F^2 - 2h x_F + h^2 + 81 - h^2. So: 64 = x_F^2 - 2h x_F + 81. Rearranged: x_F^2 - 2h x_F + 17 = 0. So both x_E and x_F satisfy the quadratic: t^2 - 2h t + 17 = 0. The roots are x_E and x_F. The sum of roots = 2h, product = 17. Also, |x_F - x_E| = 184. The difference between roots of quadratic t^2 - 2h t + 17 = 0 is sqrt((2h)^2 - 4*17) = sqrt(4h^2 - 68). This difference equals 184. So: sqrt(4h^2 - 68) = 184. Square both sides: 4h^2 - 68 = 184^2. 184^2 = 33856. So: 4h^2 = 33856 + 68 = 33924. h^2 = 33924 / 4 = 8481. Now sum of roots = 2h, so the roots are: x_E = h - 92, x_F = h + 92 (since difference is 184). Now product of roots = 17: x_E * x_F = 17. Substitute: (h - 92)(h + 92) = 17. h^2 - 92^2 = 17. h^2 - 8464 = 17. h^2 = 8481 (consistent). So h = sqrt(8481). Now x_E = h - 92, x_F = h + 92. We want CE = |107 - x_E| = |107 - (h - 92)| = |107 - h + 92| = |199 - h|. Since h = sqrt(8481), approximate h: sqrt(8481) is between sqrt(8464=92^2) and sqrt(8649=93^2), so h ≈ 92.1. So CE ≈ 199 - 92.1 = 106.9, approximately 107. Since the problem likely expects an exact value, CE = 199 - sqrt(8481).
