Question: There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\times5$ grid such that: 

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: To solve this problem, we need to place chips in a 5x5 grid such that all chips in the same row and the same column have the same color, and any additional chip would violate these conditions. This implies that each row and each column can have chips of only one color. Moreover, since any additional chip would violate the conditions, each row and each column must have exactly one chip of the chosen color, with no empty cells left. This means that we must fill the entire 5x5 grid with chips, using either all white or all black chips for each row and column. 

Consider the grid: 
- We have 25 rows and columns to fill with chips. 
- We can choose to fill a row with either white or black chips. 
- Similarly, we can choose to fill a column with either white or black chips. 

However, since each row and column must have exactly one chip of the chosen color, the grid must be filled entirely with one color or the other. 

Thus, for a consistent arrangement, all chips in the grid must be of the same color, either all white or all black. 

Let's calculate the number of ways to fill the grid: 
1. Choose a color for the first row (2 choices: white or black). 
2. Since the grid must be filled with the same color for consistency, the choice for the first row determines the color for all other rows and columns. 

Therefore, there are exactly 2 ways to fill the grid: all white or all black.
