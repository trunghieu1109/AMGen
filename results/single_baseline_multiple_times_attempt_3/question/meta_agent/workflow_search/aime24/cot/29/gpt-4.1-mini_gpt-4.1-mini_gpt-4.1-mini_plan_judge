Question: There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\times5$ grid such that: 

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: We have a 5x5 grid (25 cells) and 25 white + 25 black indistinguishable chips. We want to place some chips under these conditions:

1. Each cell contains at most one chip.
2. All chips in the same row have the same color.
3. All chips in the same column have the same color.
4. The placement is maximal: adding any chip would violate the above conditions.

Step 1: Understand the constraints.
- Since all chips in a row have the same color, each row is either all white chips or all black chips (or empty, but since chips are placed, empty rows have no chips).
- Similarly, each column is either all white chips or all black chips.

Step 2: Analyze the color pattern on the grid.
- Because each row is monochromatic and each column is monochromatic, the color of the chip in cell (i,j) depends on the color assigned to row i and column j.
- For a cell to have a chip, the row color and column color must match.

Step 3: Maximality condition.
- We want to place chips so that adding any chip would violate the conditions.
- This means that for any empty cell, placing a chip there would break either the row or column color uniformity.

Step 4: Define variables.
- Assign to each row a color: W or B.
- Assign to each column a color: W or B.

Step 5: Placement rule.
- A cell (i,j) contains a chip if and only if the row i and column j have the same color.
- So the chip positions are the intersection of rows and columns of the same color.

Step 6: Maximality check.
- Suppose there is an empty cell (i,j).
- Since no chip is placed there, row i and column j have different colors.
- If we add a chip at (i,j), then either row i or column j will have two colors, violating the monochromatic condition.
- So maximality is ensured by the definition of the placement.

Step 7: Count the number of possible placements.
- Each row is assigned a color (W or B): 2^5 possibilities.
- Each column is assigned a color (W or B): 2^5 possibilities.
- Total: 2^5 * 2^5 = 2^{10} = 1024.

Step 8: Check the chip count does not exceed available chips.
- Number of white chips used = number of cells where row and column are both white = (number of white rows) * (number of white columns).
- Number of black chips used = (number of black rows) * (number of black columns).

Since we have 25 white and 25 black chips available, the number of chips placed cannot exceed 25 of each color.

Step 9: Check feasibility of each assignment.
- Let r_w = number of white rows, r_b = 5 - r_w.
- Let c_w = number of white columns, c_b = 5 - c_w.

- White chips used = r_w * c_w <= 25
- Black chips used = r_b * c_b <= 25

- Since maximum is 25, no combination exceeds the limit.

Step 10: Conclusion.
- All 1024 assignments are valid and maximal.
