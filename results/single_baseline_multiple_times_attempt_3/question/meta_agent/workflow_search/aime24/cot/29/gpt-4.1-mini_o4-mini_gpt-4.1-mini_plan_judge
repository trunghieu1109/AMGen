Question: There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\times5$ grid such that: 

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: We need maximal placements where each row/column has a single color (white or black) and no further chip can be added. This forces every row and column to contain at least one chip of its color. Assign each of the 5 rows a color and each of the 5 columns a color so that for each color either it appears on both rows and columns or on neither. Counting these assignments: Case 1: both colors appear on rows (30 choices) and on columns (30), giving 900. Case 2: only black (1 choice). Case 3: only white (1 choice). Total 902.
