    <pre>Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.

Please think step by step and then solve the task.</pre>

    <pre>Let the time spent walking at speed s be T1 hours and the time spent walking at speed s+2 be T2 hours. The total time includes t minutes in the coffee shop. Convert t minutes to hours as t/60. 

From the problem:
T1 + t/60 = 4 hours
T2 + t/60 = 2 hours 24 minutes = 2.4 hours

Since distance is 9 km:
T1 = 9/s
T2 = 9/(s+2)

From the equations:
9/s + t/60 = 4  =&gt; t/60 = 4 - 9/s
9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4 =&gt; t/60 = 2.4 - 9/(s+2)

Set the two expressions for t/60 equal:
4 - 9/s = 2.4 - 9/(s+2)

Solve for s:
4 - 2.4 = 9/s - 9/(s+2)
1.6 = 9/s - 9/(s+2)
1.6 = 9((s+2) - s) / (s(s+2))
1.6 = 9 * 2 / (s^2 + 2s)
1.6 = 18 / (s^2 + 2s)
Multiply both sides by (s^2 + 2s):
1.6(s^2 + 2s) = 18
1.6s^2 + 3.2s = 18
Divide by 1.6:
s^2 + 2s = 11.25

Rewrite:
s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0

Solve quadratic:
s = [-2 ± sqrt(4 + 45)] / 2 = [-2 ± sqrt(49)] / 2 = [-2 ± 7]/2

Two solutions:
s = (-2 + 7)/2 = 5/2 = 2.5 or s = (-2 - 7)/2 = -9/2 = -4.5 (discard negative speed)

So s = 2.5 km/h

Find t:
t/60 = 4 - 9/2.5 = 4 - 3.6 = 0.4 hours

Convert t to minutes:
t = 0.4 * 60 = 24 minutes

Now find the total time when speed is s + 0.5 = 3 km/h:
Walking time = 9/3 = 3 hours
Total time = walking time + t/60 = 3 + 24/60 = 3 + 0.4 = 3.4 hours

Convert 3.4 hours to minutes:
3.4 * 60 = 204 minutes

Answer: 204 minutes
