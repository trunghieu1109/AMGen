    <pre>Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.

Please think step by step and then solve the task.</pre>

    <pre>Let s be Aya’s walking speed. At speed s: walking time = 9/s hours = (540/s) minutes, plus t minutes shop time equals total 240 minutes. At speed s+2: walking time = 9/(s+2) hours = (540/(s+2)) minutes, plus t = 144 minutes. 
Set 540/s + t = 240 and 540/(s+2) + t = 144. Eliminating t gives:
240 − 540/s = 144 − 540/(s+2)
96 = 540(1/s − 1/(s+2)) = 1080/(s(s+2))
So s(s+2) = 1080/96 = 11.25 ⇒ s = 2.5 km/h (positive root).
Then t = 240 − 540/2.5 = 24 minutes.
For speed s+0.5 = 3.0 km/h, walking time = 9/3 = 3 hours = 180 minutes, plus t = 24 minutes gives 204 minutes.
