    <pre>Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.

Please think step by step and then solve the task.</pre>

    <pre>First, let&#39;s determine Aya&#39;s walking speed and the time she spends in the coffee shop. When she walks at speed s, the walking time is 4 hours minus t minutes (converted to hours). The walking time is 9/s hours. Thus, 9/s + t/60 = 4. When she walks at speed s+2, the walking time is 9/(s+2) hours. The total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which is 2.4 hours. So, 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4. We have two equations: 9/s + t/60 = 4 and 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4. Subtract the second equation from the first to find s. 9/s - 9/(s+2) = 1.6. Solve this to find s. Multiply both sides by s(s+2) to get 9(s+2) - 9s = 1.6s(s+2). Simplify to get 18 = 1.6s^2 + 3.2s. Solve the quadratic equation 1.6s^2 + 3.2s - 18 = 0. Use the quadratic formula: s = [-3.2 ± sqrt((3.2)^2 - 4*1.6*(-18))]/(2*1.6). Calculate the discriminant: (3.2)^2 + 4*1.6*18 = 10.24 + 115.2 = 125.44. The square root of 125.44 is 11.2. Thus, s = [-3.2 ± 11.2]/3.2. The positive root is s = 2.5. Now, substitute s = 2.5 into 9/s + t/60 = 4 to find t. 9/2.5 + t/60 = 4. 3.6 + t/60 = 4. t/60 = 0.4. t = 24. So, t = 24 minutes. Now, find the time for s + 1/2 = 3 km/h. The walking time is 9/3 = 3 hours. Including t = 24 minutes, the total time is 3 hours and 24 minutes.
