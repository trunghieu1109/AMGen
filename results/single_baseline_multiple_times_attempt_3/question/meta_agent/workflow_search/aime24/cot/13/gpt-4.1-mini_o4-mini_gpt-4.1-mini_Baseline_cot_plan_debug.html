    <pre>Eight circles of radius $34$ are sequentially tangent, and two of the circles are tangent to $AB$ and $BC$ of triangle $ABC$, respectively. $2024$ circles of radius $1$ can be arranged in the same manner. The inradius of triangle $ABC$ can be expressed as $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

Please think step by step and then solve the task.</pre>

    <pre>The problem describes two chains of equal circles packed tangent‐to‐tangent between two sides of triangle ABC, with one chain of 8 circles of radius 34 and another of 2024 circles of radius 1.  The triangle’s inradius must be just large enough so that each chain exactly spans from AB to BC.  One shows that the inradius R satisfies a functional equation linking R, the radius r, and the number of circles n.  Plugging in (r,n)=(34,8) and (1,2024) yields a single solution R as a reduced fraction m/n, and one computes m+n.
