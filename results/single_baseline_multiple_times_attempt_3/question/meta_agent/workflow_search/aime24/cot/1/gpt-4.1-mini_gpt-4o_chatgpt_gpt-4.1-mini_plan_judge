Question: Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.

proposed answer: We are given a triangle $ABC$ inscribed in circle $	riangle$. The tangents at $B$ and $C$ intersect at $D$, and $AD$ intersects the circle again at $P$. The given side lengths are $AB = 5$, $BC = 9$, and $AC = 10$. We need to find the length $AP$ in the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are coprime integers, and then find $m + n$.

To solve this, we use the Power of a Point theorem and properties of tangents and secants. Since $D$ is the intersection of the tangents at $B$ and $C$, $D$ is the exsimilicenter of the circle with respect to the points $B$ and $C$. By the Power of a Point theorem, $AD \cdot DP = DB^2 = DC^2$.

The tangents $DB$ and $DC$ are equal, so $DB = DC = \sqrt{BD \cdot DC}$. We can find these lengths using the fact that $D$ is the exsimilicenter of the tangents, which implies $DB = DC = \frac{AB \cdot AC}{BC}$. Substituting the known values, we have $DB = \frac{5 \cdot 10}{9} = \frac{50}{9}$.

Thus, $AD \cdot DP = \left(\frac{50}{9}\right)^2$. Since $AD$ and $DP$ are segments along the line $AD$, we can express $AD = AP + PD$. Let $AP = x$, then $PD = AP + DP = x + y$, and $AD = x + y$. By the Power of a Point, $x(x+y) = \left(\frac{50}{9}\right)^2$.

This simplifies to $x^2 + xy = \frac{2500}{81}$. Using the fact that $AD \cdot DP = DB^2$, we can substitute $AD = x + y$ and $DP = y$, leading to $x(x+y) = \frac{2500}{81}$. Solving this quadratic equation for $x$ gives us $x = \frac{50}{9}$.

Therefore, $AP = \frac{50}{9}$, and $m = 50$, $n = 9$. The sum $m + n = 50 + 9 = 59$.
