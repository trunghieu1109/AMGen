Question: Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent y7Hs', content='We are given a triangle $ABC$ inscribed in circle $\triangle$. The tangents at $B$ and $C$ intersect at $D$, and $AD$ intersects the circle again at $P$. The given side lengths are $AB = 5$, $BC = 9$, and $AC = 10$. We need to find the length $AP$ in the form $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are coprime integers, and then find $m + n$.\n\nTo solve this, we use the Power of a Point theorem and properties of tangents and secants. Since $D$ is the intersection of the tangents at $B$ and $C$, $D$ is the exsimilicenter of the circle with respect to the points $B$ and $C$. By the Power of a Point theorem, $AD \\cdot DP = DB^2 = DC^2$.\n\nThe tangents $DB$ and $DC$ are equal, so $DB = DC = \\sqrt{BD \\cdot DC}$. We can find these lengths using the fact that $D$ is the exsimilicenter of the tangents, which implies $DB = DC = \\frac{AB \\cdot AC}{BC}$. Substituting the known values, we have $DB = \\frac{5 \\cdot 10}{9} = \\frac{50}{9}$.\n\nThus, $AD \\cdot DP = \\left(\\frac{50}{9}\\right)^2$. Since $AD$ and $DP$ are segments along the line $AD$, we can express $AD = AP + PD$. Let $AP = x$, then $PD = AP + DP = x + y$, and $AD = x + y$. By the Power of a Point, $x(x+y) = \\left(\\frac{50}{9}\\right)^2$.\n\nThis simplifies to $x^2 + xy = \\frac{2500}{81}$. Using the fact that $AD \\cdot DP = DB^2$, we can substitute $AD = x + y$ and $DP = y$, leading to $x(x+y) = \\frac{2500}{81}$. Solving this quadratic equation for $x$ gives us $x = \\frac{50}{9}$.\n\nTherefore, $AP = \\frac{50}{9}$, and $m = 50$, $n = 9$. The sum $m + n = 50 + 9 = 59$.\n\nAnswer:59', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
