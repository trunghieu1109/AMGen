Question: Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: We place B=(0,0), C=(9,0), and solve for A from AB=5, AC=10: A=(1/3,4√14/3).  The circumcenter is O=(9/2,33/(4√14)) with R^2=5625/224.  The tangents at B and C meet at D=(9/2,−27√14/11).  Parametrize line AD: A+t(D−A), find its second intersection P with the circumcircle (root t=88/169).  Then AP=t·|D−A| with |D−A|=325/22 gives AP=(88/169)(325/22)=100/13.  Hence m+n=100+13=113.
