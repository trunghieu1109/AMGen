proposed answer: We are given a hyperbola \( \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \) and points \( A, B, C, D \) on this hyperbola forming a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin. The diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles. Let's assume \( A = (x_1, y_1) \), \( B = (x_2, y_2) \), \( C = (-x_1, -y_1) \), and \( D = (-x_2, -y_2) \). The diagonals \( AC \) and \( BD \) intersect at the origin, so \( AC \) is along the line \( y = \frac{y_1}{x_1} x \) and \( BD \) is along the line \( y = \frac{y_2}{x_2} x \). The lengths of the diagonals are \( AC = 2\sqrt{x_1^2 + y_1^2} \) and \( BD = 2\sqrt{x_2^2 + y_2^2} \). We need to find \( BD^2 = 4(x_2^2 + y_2^2) \). Since \( A \) and \( C \) are on the hyperbola, we have \( \frac{x_1^2}{20} - \frac{y_1^2}{24} = 1 \). Similarly, for \( B \) and \( D \), \( \frac{x_2^2}{20} - \frac{y_2^2}{24} = 1 \). The condition for the diagonals intersecting at the origin and being perpendicular implies \( \frac{y_1}{x_1} \cdot \frac{y_2}{x_2} = -1 \). Let's express \( y_1 \) and \( y_2 \) in terms of \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \) using the hyperbola equation: \( y_1^2 = \frac{24}{20} x_1^2 - 24 \) and \( y_2^2 = \frac{24}{20} x_2^2 - 24 \). Substituting these into the perpendicular condition gives \( \frac{\sqrt{\frac{24}{20} x_1^2 - 24}}{x_1} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{\frac{24}{20} x_2^2 - 24}}{x_2} = -1 \). Simplifying, \( \frac{24}{20} x_1^2 x_2^2 - 24(x_1^2 + x_2^2) + 576 = 0 \). We want to maximize \( BD^2 = 4(x_2^2 + y_2^2) = 4(x_2^2 + \frac{24}{20} x_2^2 - 24) = \frac{44}{5} x_2^2 - 96 \). Set \( x_1 = x_2 = x \) to simplify, then \( \frac{44}{5} x^2 - 96 \) is maximized subject to \( \frac{24}{20} x^4 - 48x^2 + 576 = 0 \). Solving this quadratic in \( x^2 \), we find the maximum value of \( BD^2 \) is \( 80 \). Therefore, the greatest real number less than \( BD^2 \) for all such rhombi is 79.
