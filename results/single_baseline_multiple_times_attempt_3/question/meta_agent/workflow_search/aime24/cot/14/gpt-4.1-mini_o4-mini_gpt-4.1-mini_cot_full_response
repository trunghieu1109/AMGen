Question: Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent LjCp', content='We seek rhombi ABCD inscribed in the hyperbola x^2/20 – y^2/24 = 1 with diagonals crossing at O.  Let A=(x1,y1), C=(–x1,–y1), B=(x2,y2), D=(–x2,–y2).  Being a parallelogram with perpendicular diagonals (a rhombus) gives x1x2 + y1y2 = 0.  Both A and B lie on the hyperbola:\n  x1^2/20 – y1^2/24 = 1,  x2^2/20 – y2^2/24 = 1.\nParametrize (x1,y1) ⟂ (x2,y2) by (x1,y1)=k(–y2,x2).  Substituting into A’s hyperbola equation yields\n  k^2[y2^2/20 – x2^2/24] = 1,  so we need y2^2/20 – x2^2/24 > 0 for real k.\nBut on the hyperbola y2^2 = (24/20)x2^2 –24 = 1.2 x2^2 –24, so\ny2^2/20 – x2^2/24 = (1.2/20 –1/24)x2^2 –24/20 = (11/600)x2^2 –6/5 > 0 ⇒ x2^2 > 720/11.\nThe side BD has length^2 = 4(x2^2+y2^2) = 4[(x2^2 +1.2x2^2 –24)] = 4[(11/5)x2^2 –24].  This increases with x2^2, so its infimum occurs at x2^2→720/11, giving x2^2 + y2^2→120 and BD^2→4·120=480.  No rhombus attains equality, but BD^2>480 always, and 480 is the greatest lower bound.\n\nAnswer:480', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
