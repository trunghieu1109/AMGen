Question: There exist real numbers $x$ and $y$, both greater than 1, such that $\log_x\left(y^x\right)=\log_y\left(x^{4y}\right)=10$. Find $xy$.
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: We start by analyzing the given equations: \( \log_x(y^x) = 10 \) and \( \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 \). For the first equation, \( \log_x(y^x) = 10 \) implies \( y^x = x^{10} \). For the second equation, \( \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 \) implies \( x^{4y} = y^{10} \). Now, we have the system of equations: 1) \( y^x = x^{10} \) and 2) \( x^{4y} = y^{10} \). We can express \( y \) and \( x \) in terms of each other from these equations. From equation 1, \( y = x^{10/x} \). Substitute this into equation 2: \( x^{4(x^{10/x})} = (x^{10/x})^{10} \). Simplifying, we get \( x^{4x^{10/x}} = x^{100/x} \). Equating the exponents gives \( 4x^{10/x} = 100/x \). Solving this equation for \( x \), we find \( x = 10 \). Substituting \( x = 10 \) back into \( y = x^{10/x} \), we get \( y = 10^{10/10} = 10 \). Therefore, \( x = 10 \) and \( y = 10 \), so \( xy = 10 \times 10 = 100 \).
