Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent lQ2S', content='We start by analyzing the given equations: \\( \\log_x(y^x) = 10 \\) and \\( \\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 \\). For the first equation, \\( \\log_x(y^x) = 10 \\) implies \\( y^x = x^{10} \\). For the second equation, \\( \\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 \\) implies \\( x^{4y} = y^{10} \\). Now, we have the system of equations: 1) \\( y^x = x^{10} \\) and 2) \\( x^{4y} = y^{10} \\). We can express \\( y \\) and \\( x \\) in terms of each other from these equations. From equation 1, \\( y = x^{10/x} \\). Substitute this into equation 2: \\( x^{4(x^{10/x})} = (x^{10/x})^{10} \\). Simplifying, we get \\( x^{4x^{10/x}} = x^{100/x} \\). Equating the exponents gives \\( 4x^{10/x} = 100/x \\). Solving this equation for \\( x \\), we find \\( x = 10 \\). Substituting \\( x = 10 \\) back into \\( y = x^{10/x} \\), we get \\( y = 10^{10/10} = 10 \\). Therefore, \\( x = 10 \\) and \\( y = 10 \\), so \\( xy = 10 \\times 10 = 100 \\).\n\nAnswer:100', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
