Question: There exist real numbers $x$ and $y$, both greater than 1, such that $\log_x\left(y^x\right)=\log_y\left(x^{4y}\right)=10$. Find $xy$.\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent SXSi', content='We have two equations: log_x(y^x)=10 implies y^x=x^{10}. Taking natural logs gives x·ln y=10·ln x, so ln y=(10/x)·ln x. Similarly log_y(x^{4y})=10 implies 4y·ln x=10·ln y, so ln y=(2y/5)·ln x. Equate the two expressions for ln y: (10/x)·ln x=(2y/5)·ln x. Since ln x>0 (x>1), divide by ln x to get 10/x=2y/5. Multiply by x and 5: 50=2yx, hence yx=25. Thus xy=25.\n\nAnswer:25', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
