proposed answer: We are given two equations involving logarithms with bases x and y, both greater than 1:

1) \( \log_x(y^x) = 10 \)
2) \( \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 \)

From the first equation:
\[ \log_x(y^x) = 10 \implies y^x = x^{10} \]

From the second equation:
\[ \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 \implies x^{4y} = y^{10} \]

We have two equations:
\[ y^x = x^{10} \]
\[ x^{4y} = y^{10} \]

Rewrite the first equation:
\[ y^x = x^{10} \implies (y)^x = (x)^{10} \]

Rewrite the second equation:
\[ x^{4y} = y^{10} \]

Take natural logarithms (ln) on both sides of each:

From the first:
\[ x \ln y = 10 \ln x \]

From the second:
\[ 4y \ln x = 10 \ln y \]

We have the system:
\[
\begin{cases}
 x \ln y = 10 \ln x \\
 4 y \ln x = 10 \ln y
\end{cases}
\]

Let \( a = \ln x \) and \( b = \ln y \). Since x > 1 and y > 1, \( a > 0 \) and \( b > 0 \).

Rewrite the system:
\[
\begin{cases}
 x b = 10 a \\
 4 y a = 10 b
\end{cases}
\]

Recall \( x = e^a \) and \( y = e^b \).

Substitute:
\[
\begin{cases}
 e^a b = 10 a \\
 4 e^b a = 10 b
\end{cases}
\]

From the first:
\[ b = \frac{10 a}{e^a} \]

Substitute into the second:
\[ 4 e^b a = 10 \cdot \frac{10 a}{e^a} \implies 4 e^b a = \frac{100 a}{e^a} \]

Divide both sides by a (a > 0):
\[ 4 e^b = \frac{100}{e^a} \implies 4 e^b e^a = 100 \implies 4 e^{a + b} = 100 \implies e^{a + b} = 25 \]

Since \( e^{a + b} = e^a e^b = x y \), we have:
\[ x y = 25 \]

Hence, the value of \( x y \) is 25.
