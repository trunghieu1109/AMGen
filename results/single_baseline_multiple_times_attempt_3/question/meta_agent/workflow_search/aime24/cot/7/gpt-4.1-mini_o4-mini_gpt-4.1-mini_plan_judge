Question: There exist real numbers $x$ and $y$, both greater than 1, such that $\log_x\left(y^x\right)=\log_y\left(x^{4y}\right)=10$. Find $xy$.
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: We have two equations: log_x(y^x)=10 implies y^x=x^{10}. Taking natural logs gives x·ln y=10·ln x, so ln y=(10/x)·ln x. Similarly log_y(x^{4y})=10 implies 4y·ln x=10·ln y, so ln y=(2y/5)·ln x. Equate the two expressions for ln y: (10/x)·ln x=(2y/5)·ln x. Since ln x>0 (x>1), divide by ln x to get 10/x=2y/5. Multiply by x and 5: 50=2yx, hence yx=25. Thus xy=25.
