    <pre>To find the number of paths that change direction exactly four times on an 8x8 grid, we need to consider the structure of such paths. A path from (0,0) to (8,8) on the grid consists of 8 right moves (R) and 8 up moves (U). Changing direction exactly four times means the path switches between segments of R and U exactly four times. A valid sequence with four changes of direction could be RR...U...RR...U...RR...U...RR...U..., where each segment of R and U is non-empty. Thus, we have 5 segments: 3 segments of R and 2 segments of U. We need to distribute 8 R&#39;s into 3 non-empty segments and 8 U&#39;s into 2 non-empty segments. The number of ways to partition 8 into 3 positive parts is given by the number of solutions to x1 + x2 + x3 = 8, where x1, x2, x3 &gt; 0, which is C(7,2). The number of ways to partition 8 into 2 positive parts is given by the number of solutions to y1 + y2 = 8, where y1, y2 &gt; 0, which is C(7,1). Therefore, the total number of such paths is the product of these two combinations.
