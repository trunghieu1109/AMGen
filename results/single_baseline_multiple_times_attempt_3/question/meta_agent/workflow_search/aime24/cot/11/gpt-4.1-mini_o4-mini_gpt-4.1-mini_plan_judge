Question: Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.
[asy] size(10cm); usepackage("tikz");label("\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(2,0)--(2,3)--(5,3)--(5,8)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}",origin); label("\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(0,3)--(3,3)--(3,5)--(8,5)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}",E); [/asy]

proposed answer: We need the number of monotonic paths from (0,0) to (8,8) with exactly four direction changes. Such a path consists of 16 moves: 8 east (E) and 8 north (N). A change in direction occurs at each adjacent pair where the move letter changes. If there are k runs (maximal blocks of identical moves), then there are k−1 changes; we want k−1=4, so k=5 runs.

Each path is a sequence of 5 runs alternating between E and N. There are two cases:
1) Start with E: runs sequence E,N,E,N,E gives 3 E-runs and 2 N-runs.  Partition 8 E’s into 3 positive parts in C(7,2)=21 ways and 8 N’s into 2 positive parts in C(7,1)=7 ways, for 21×7=147.
2) Start with N: runs sequence N,E,N,E,N gives 3 N-runs and 2 E-runs, similarly 21×7=147.

Total =147+147=294.
