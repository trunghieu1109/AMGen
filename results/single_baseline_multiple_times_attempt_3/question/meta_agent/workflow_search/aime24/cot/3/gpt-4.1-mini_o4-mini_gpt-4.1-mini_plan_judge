Question: Define $f(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{4}|$. Find the number of intersections of the graphs of \[y=4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \quad\text{ and }\quad x=4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))).\]
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: We need number of intersections of curves y=A(x)=4g(f(sin2πx)) and x=B(y)=4g(f(cos3πy)).  One shows A(x) and B(y) are continuous piecewise‐linear‐in‐t composed with sin and cos, each segment strictly monotonic in x.  In x∊[0,1], |sin2πx| has two full humps, and on each hump A has 8 monotonic linear pieces, so A has 16 pieces total.  In y∊[0,1], |cos3πy| has three humps, and on each B has 8 monotonic pieces, so B has 24 pieces total.  The composite C(x)=B(A(x)) thus splits into 16·24=384 monotonic segments.  The equation C(x)=x has exactly one solution in each segment where C(x)−x changes sign, which occurs in all segments (alternating above/below the diagonal at each boundary).  Hence there are 384 solutions (x∊[0,1]) and corresponding y=A(x), giving 384 intersection points.
