Question: Define $f(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{4}|$. Find the number of intersections of the graphs of \[y=4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \quad\text{ and }\quad x=4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))).\]
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: To solve the problem, we need to analyze the functions involved and find the intersections of the graphs. 

1. Consider the function $f(x) = ||x| - \frac{1}{2}|$. The function $|x|$ takes non-negative values, so $|x| - \frac{1}{2}$ can be either positive or negative. The function $||x| - \frac{1}{2}|$ is symmetric about $x = 0$ and has a minimum value of 0 when $|x| = \frac{1}{2}$.

2. The function $g(x) = ||x| - \frac{1}{4}|$ is similar. It is symmetric about $x = 0$ and has a minimum value of 0 when $|x| = \frac{1}{4}$.

3. Consider $4g(f(\sin(2\pi x)))$. Since $\sin(2\pi x)$ has a range $[-1, 1]$, $|\sin(2\pi x)|$ ranges from 0 to 1. We calculate $f(\sin(2\pi x)) = ||\sin(2\pi x)| - \frac{1}{2}|$. This function has a minimum value of 0 when $|\sin(2\pi x)| = \frac{1}{2}$.

4. For $g(f(\sin(2\pi x)))$, we have $g(y) = ||y| - \frac{1}{4}|$. The minimum value is 0 when $|y| = \frac{1}{4}$.

5. Thus $4g(f(\sin(2\pi x)))$ will be 0 when $|f(\sin(2\pi x))| = \frac{1}{4}$. So, we need $||\sin(2\pi x)| - \frac{1}{2}| = \frac{1}{4}$.

6. Solving for $\sin(2\pi x)$, we get $|\sin(2\pi x)| = \frac{3}{4}$ or $\frac{1}{4}$.

7. Similarly, for $x = 4g(f(\cos(3\pi y)))$, we find $|\cos(3\pi y)| = \frac{3}{4}$ or $\frac{1}{4}$.

8. Find the values of $x$ and $y$ that satisfy both equations.

9. $\sin(2\pi x) = \pm \frac{3}{4}, \pm \frac{1}{4}$ and $\cos(3\pi y) = \pm \frac{3}{4}, \pm \frac{1}{4}$.

10. For each pair $(x, y)$, check if they satisfy both equations.

11. Count the number of solutions.
