    <pre>Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

    <pre>To solve this problem, we need to calculate two probabilities: the probability of Jen winning a prize and the probability of her winning the grand prize. First, calculate the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from the set S, which is \( \binom{10}{4} = 210 \). Jen wins a prize if at least 2 of her chosen numbers are among the 4 randomly chosen numbers. To calculate this, we consider the complement: the number of ways she does not win a prize, which means at most 1 of her numbers is among the 4 chosen numbers. If exactly 1 of her numbers is among the chosen numbers, there are \( \binom{4}{1} \cdot \binom{6}{3} = 80 \) ways (choose 1 of her 4 numbers and 3 from the remaining 6). If none of her numbers is among the chosen numbers, there are \( \binom{6}{4} = 15 \) ways (choose all 4 from the 6 not chosen by her). Thus, there are \( 80 + 15 = 95 \) ways she does not win a prize, so there are \( 210 - 95 = 115 \) ways she wins a prize. For the grand prize, all 4 of her numbers must be among the 4 chosen numbers, which is 1 way. Therefore, the probability of winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is \( \frac{1}{115} \). Since 1 and 115 are relatively prime, \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 115 \), so \( m+n = 116 \).
