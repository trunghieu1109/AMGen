    <pre>First, the total number of ways to choose 4 distinct numbers from the set S of 10 numbers is C(10,4) = 210.

Jen picks 4 distinct numbers, call this set J.

The winning numbers are 4 distinct numbers chosen randomly from S.

She wins a prize if at least 2 of her numbers match the winning numbers.

She wins the grand prize if all 4 of her numbers match the winning numbers.

We want the probability of winning the grand prize given that she won a prize.

Step 1: Calculate the probability of winning the grand prize.
This is the probability that the winning numbers are exactly J.
Since the winning numbers are chosen uniformly at random from all C(10,4) sets, the probability is 1/210.

Step 2: Calculate the probability of winning a prize (at least 2 numbers match).
We need to find the number of 4-number subsets W of S such that |W ∩ J| ≥ 2.

Let k = |W ∩ J|. Since both W and J have size 4, k can be 0 to 4.
We want k ≥ 2.

Number of subsets W with exactly k matches with J is:
C(4, k) * C(6, 4 - k)
Because from the 4 numbers in J, choose k to be in W, and from the 6 numbers not in J, choose the remaining 4-k numbers.

Calculate for k = 2, 3, 4:
- k=2: C(4,2)*C(6,2) = 6 * 15 = 90
- k=3: C(4,3)*C(6,1) = 4 * 6 = 24
- k=4: C(4,4)*C(6,0) = 1 * 1 = 1

Total = 90 + 24 + 1 = 115

So the probability of winning a prize is 115/210.

Step 3: The conditional probability of winning the grand prize given winning a prize is:
P(grand prize | prize) = P(grand prize and prize) / P(prize) = P(grand prize) / P(prize) = (1/210) / (115/210) = 1/115.

Therefore, the fraction is 1/115, so m=1 and n=115.

m + n = 1 + 115 = 116.
