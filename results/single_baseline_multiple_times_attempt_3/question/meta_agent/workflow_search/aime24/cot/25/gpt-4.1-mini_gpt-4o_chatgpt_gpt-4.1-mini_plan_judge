Question: Let ABCDEF be a convex equilateral hexagon in which all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle whose sides are extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. Find the side length of the hexagon.
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The hexagon ABCDEF is equilateral and has opposite sides parallel, making it a special type of hexagon known as a 'regular' hexagon. However, in this problem, the hexagon is not necessarily regular, but it has the property that opposite sides are parallel and equal in length. This type of hexagon is known as a 'parallelogrammatic' hexagon. The key to solving this problem lies in understanding the triangle formed by the extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF. Let's denote the sides of this triangle as a = 200, b = 240, and c = 300. Since the hexagon is equilateral and opposite sides are parallel, it is symmetric, and the triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF is related to the hexagon's geometry. The side lengths of the triangle correspond to the differences in position between points where the extensions intersect. By using the triangle inequality and the fact that the hexagon is equilateral, we can determine the side length of the hexagon. Specifically, the side length of the hexagon is the semiperimeter of the triangle formed by the extensions, divided by 3. Therefore, the side length of the hexagon is (200 + 240 + 300) / 3.
