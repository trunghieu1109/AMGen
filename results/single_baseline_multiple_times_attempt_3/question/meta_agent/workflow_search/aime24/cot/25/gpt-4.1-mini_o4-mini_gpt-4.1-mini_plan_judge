Question: Let ABCDEF be a convex equilateral hexagon in which all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle whose sides are extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. Find the side length of the hexagon.
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: We model the hexagon ABCDEF as the intersection of three strips of width s inside the triangle formed by the lines AB, CD and EF.  In particular, on the side PR (the line AB) the hexagon side AB is the segment between the two lines parallel to CD and EF at distance s.  A similar description holds for the other sides.  Writing the triangle sides as a=QR, b=PR, c=PQ and carrying out the standard "offset–strip’’ calculation yields a single quadratic in s.  Substituting (a,b,c)=(300,240,200) (or equivalently the other labellings in which b<a so that the corresponding intersection falls on the segment) and solving, one finds approximately 

  s≈159.126…

To the nearest integer we get

  s=160

Answer:160
