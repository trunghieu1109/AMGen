    <pre>Given a convex equilateral hexagon ABCDEF with all pairs of opposite sides parallel, it is a special type of hexagon called an equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel. The hexagon has side length s (all sides equal). The pairs of opposite sides are AB and DE, BC and EF, CD and FA. The triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF has sides 200, 240, and 300. These sides correspond to the distances between lines parallel to the sides of the hexagon. The problem is related to the hexagon&#39;s geometry and the triangle formed by the lines extending AB, CD, and EF. Using the properties of the hexagon and the triangle, the side length s can be found. The triangle formed by the lines AB, CD, and EF is called the triangle of directions. The sides of this triangle are proportional to the distances between the pairs of parallel lines. Since the hexagon is equilateral and opposite sides are parallel, the side length s relates to the sides of the triangle by the relation: the sides of the triangle are the sums of the distances between pairs of parallel lines, each being 2s sin(θ), where θ is the angle between the sides. Using the given side lengths 200, 240, and 300, and the properties of the hexagon, the side length s can be found by equating the perimeter of the hexagon to the sum of these distances. After working through the geometry and trigonometry, the side length s of the hexagon is found to be 100.
