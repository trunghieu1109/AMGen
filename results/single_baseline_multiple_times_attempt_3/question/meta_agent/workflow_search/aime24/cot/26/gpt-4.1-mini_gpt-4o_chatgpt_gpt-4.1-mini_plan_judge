Question: Alice chooses a set $A$ of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets $B$ of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of $B$ belongs to $A$. Bob's list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A.

proposed answer: Let's analyze the problem step by step. Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers such that the maximum element of B belongs to A. We know that Bob's list contains 2024 sets. 

For each element a in A, the number of nonempty sets B with maximum element a is 2^(a-1). This is because we can choose any subset of {1, 2, ..., a-1} to be included in B, and then we include a to ensure it is the maximum. 

Therefore, the total number of sets B is the sum of 2^(a-1) for each a in A. We have:

sum_{a in A} 2^(a-1) = 2024.

Let's express 2024 as a sum of powers of 2: 2024 = 2^10 - 8 = 2^10 - 2^3 = 1024 + 512 + 256 + 128 + 64 + 32 + 8.

This can be rewritten as a sum of the form 2^(a-1): 2^10 corresponds to a = 11, 2^9 corresponds to a = 10, 2^8 corresponds to a = 9, 2^7 corresponds to a = 8, 2^6 corresponds to a = 7, 2^5 corresponds to a = 6, and 2^3 corresponds to a = 4.

Thus, A = {4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11}.

The sum of the elements of A is 4 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 = 55.
