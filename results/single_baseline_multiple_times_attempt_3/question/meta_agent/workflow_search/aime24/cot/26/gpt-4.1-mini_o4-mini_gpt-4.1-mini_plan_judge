Question: Alice chooses a set $A$ of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets $B$ of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of $B$ belongs to $A$. Bob's list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A.
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: We need all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers whose maximum m lies in Alice’s set A.  For a given m, there are 2^(m–1) choices for B (each subset of {1,…,m–1}, together with m).  Thus
   ∑_{m∈A} 2^(m–1) = 2024.
Write 2024 in binary gives
   2024 = 2^10 + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^3.
Hence the exponents m–1 are 10,9,8,7,6,5,3, so A = {11,10,9,8,7,6,4}.  The sum of these is 4+6+7+8+9+10+11 = 55.
