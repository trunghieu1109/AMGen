Question: Let $\omega\neq 1$ be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\]
is divided by 1000.
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: We want P = ∏_{k=0}^{12}(2−2ω^k+ω^{2k}), where ω runs over the 13th roots of unity. Note that f(x)=x^2−2x+2 has roots 1±i. By properties of resultants,
P = ∏_{ω^13=1}f(ω) = Res(x^13−1,f(x)) = ∏_{r:f(r)=0}(r^13−1).
Compute r=1+i: (1+i)^13 = (√2·e^{iπ/4})^13 =2^{6.5}e^{i13π/4} =64√2·e^{i5π/4} =64√2·(−√2/2−i√2/2)=−64(1+i). Thus (1+i)^13−1=−64(1+i)−1=−65−64i. Likewise for 1−i gives −65+64i. Their product is (−65−64i)(−65+64i)=65^2+64^2=4225+4096=8321. Hence P=8321. Modulo 1000 gives 8321≡321.
