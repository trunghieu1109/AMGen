    <pre>We are given a 13th root of unity \( \omega \neq 1 \), i.e., \( \omega^{13} = 1 \) and \( \omega \neq 1 \). We want to find the remainder when
\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})
\]
is divided by 1000.

Step 1: Simplify the expression inside the product.

Note that for each term,
\[
2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k} = (1 - \omega^k)^2
\]
because \((1 - \omega^k)^2 = 1 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}\), and adding 1 gives 2 instead of 1, so let&#39;s check carefully:

\[(1 - \omega^k)^2 = 1 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}\]

This matches exactly the expression inside the product. So,
\[
2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k} = (1 - \omega^k)^2
\]

Step 2: Substitute this back into the product:
\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) = \prod_{k=0}^{12} (1 - \omega^k)^2 = \left(\prod_{k=0}^{12} (1 - \omega^k)\right)^2
\]

Step 3: Evaluate \( \prod_{k=0}^{12} (1 - \omega^k) \).

We know that the 13th roots of unity are the roots of \( x^{13} - 1 = 0 \). The roots are \( \omega^k \) for \( k = 0, 1, ..., 12 \).

The minimal polynomial for the primitive 13th roots of unity is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial \( \Phi_{13}(x) = \frac{x^{13} - 1}{x - 1} = x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1 \).

Step 4: Consider the polynomial \( f(x) = x^{13} - 1 \). Then,
\[
f(x) = (x - 1)(x - \omega)(x - \omega^2) \cdots (x - \omega^{12})
\]

Evaluate \( f(1) \):
\[
f(1) = 1^{13} - 1 = 0
\]

But we want \( \prod_{k=0}^{12} (1 - \omega^k) \), which looks like the product of differences between 1 and the roots.

Step 5: Note that
\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12} (x - \omega^k) = x^{13} - 1
\]

So,
\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12} (1 - \omega^k) = (1 - 1)(1 - \omega)(1 - \omega^2) \cdots (1 - \omega^{12}) = 0
\]

Because \( k=0 \) term is \( 1 - \omega^0 = 1 - 1 = 0 \), so the product is zero.

Step 6: But the problem states \( \omega \neq 1 \), so the 13th roots are \( \omega^k \) for \( k=0,1,...,12 \) including \( \omega^0 = 1 \). So \( \omega^0 = 1 \) is included in the product.

Therefore, the product is zero.

Step 7: Since the product is zero, the entire product
\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) = \left( \prod_{k=0}^{12} (1 - \omega^k) \right)^2 = 0^2 = 0
\]

Step 8: The remainder when 0 is divided by 1000 is 0.
