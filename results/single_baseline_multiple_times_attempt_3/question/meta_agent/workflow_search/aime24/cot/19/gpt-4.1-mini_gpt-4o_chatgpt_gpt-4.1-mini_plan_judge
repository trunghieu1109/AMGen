proposed answer: The given expression involves the 13th roots of unity. First, note that the 13th roots of unity satisfy the equation \( x^{13} = 1 \), and they are given by \( 1, \omega, \omega^2, \ldots, \omega^{12} \). We are given \( rac{x^{13} - 1}{x - 1} = x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1 = 0 \) for \( x = \omega^k \) where \( k = 1, 2, \ldots, 12 \). The expression inside the product is \( 2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k} = (1 - \omega^k)^2 + 1 \). For each \( k \), this simplifies to \( (1 - \omega^k)^2 + 1 = (1 - \omega^k)(1 - \omega^k) + 1 \). The product over all \( k \) from 0 to 12 is a symmetric polynomial in the roots of unity. By Vieta's formulas and properties of roots of unity, this product equals \( P(1) \), where \( P(x) = (x - \omega^0)(x - \omega^1)\cdots(x - \omega^{12}) \). Since \( \omega^k \) are the roots of \( x^{13} - 1 = 0 \), we have \( P(x) = \frac{x^{13} - 1}{x - 1} \) evaluated at \( x = 2 \). Therefore, the product is \( P(2) = \frac{2^{13} - 1}{2 - 1} = 2^{13} - 1 \). Calculate \( 2^{13} = 8192 \), so \( P(2) = 8192 - 1 = 8191 \). Finally, find the remainder when 8191 is divided by 1000. The remainder is 191.
