Question: Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.

proposed answer: We recognize the tetrahedron as a disphenoid (isosceles tetrahedron) with opposite edges equal: AB=CD=√41, AC=BD=√80, AD=BC=√89.  All four faces are congruent triangles with side‐lengths √41, √80, √89.  Using the formula
  area² = (1/16)[2(a²b² + b²c² + c²a²) − (a⁴ + b⁴ + c⁴)],
we find the area of one face =6√21, so the total surface area S=24√21.

To get the volume V, we compute the Cayley–Menger determinant for the six edge‐lengths, which yields
  288 V² = det(CM) = 703712,
so V² =703712/288 =21991/9 and thus V =√21991/3.

The inradius r (distance from the incenter to each face) satisfies r =3V/S = (√21991/3*3)/(24√21) =√21991/(24√21).  Rationalizing the denominator,
  r =√21991·√21/(24·21) =√461811/504.
This is of the form m√n/p with m=1, n=461811, p=504, gcd(m,p)=1, and n squarefree.  Hence m+n+p = 1+461811+504 = 462316.
