Question: Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent pqBh', content="To solve this problem, we need to find the distance from the point $I$ to each face of the tetrahedron $ABCD$. The condition that these distances are equal implies that $I$ is the incenter of the tetrahedron. The formula for the inradius $r$ of a tetrahedron is given by $r = \\frac{3V}{S}$, where $V$ is the volume of the tetrahedron and $S$ is the total surface area.\n\nFirst, we find the volume $V$ of the tetrahedron using the Cayley-Menger determinant. The sides of the tetrahedron are given by $AB = CD = \\sqrt{41}$, $AC = BD = \\sqrt{80}$, and $BC = AD = \\sqrt{89}$. We apply the Cayley-Menger determinant:\n\n\\[\n288V^2 = -1 \\begin{vmatrix} 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 41 & 80 & 89 \\\\\n1 & 41 & 0 & 89 & 80 \\\\\n1 & 80 & 89 & 0 & 41 \\\\\n1 & 89 & 80 & 41 & 0 \\end{vmatrix}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this determinant, we find it equals $-921600$. Therefore, $288V^2 = 921600$, and $V^2 = 3200$, so $V = \\sqrt{3200} = 40\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nNext, we calculate the surface area $S$. Each face of the tetrahedron is a triangle. The area of a triangle with side lengths $a$, $b$, and $c$ is given by Heron's formula: \\( \\text{Area} = \\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} \\), where $s = \\frac{a+b+c}{2}$ is the semi-perimeter.\n\nFor face $ABC$, the side lengths are $AB = \\sqrt{41}$, $BC = \\sqrt{89}$, $CA = \\sqrt{80}$. The semi-perimeter $s = \\frac{\\sqrt{41} + \\sqrt{89} + \\sqrt{80}}{2}$. Calculating the area using Heron's formula, we find the area of $\\triangle ABC = 20$.\n\nSimilarly, we calculate the areas of $\\triangle ABD$, $\\triangle ACD$, and $\\triangle BCD$ and find each area to be $20$.\n\nThus, the total surface area $S = 4 \\times 20 = 80$.\n\nFinally, the inradius $r$ is given by \\( r = \\frac{3V}{S} = \\frac{3 \\times 40\\sqrt{2}}{80} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\).\n\nThis is in the form \\( \\frac{m\\sqrt{n}}{p} \\), where $m = 3$, $n = 2$, and $p = 2$. The numbers $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime.\n\nThus, $m+n+p = 3 + 2 + 2 = 7$.\n\nAnswer:7", prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
