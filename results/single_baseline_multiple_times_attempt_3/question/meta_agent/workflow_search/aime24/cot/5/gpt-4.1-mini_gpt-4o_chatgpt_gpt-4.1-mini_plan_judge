Question: Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.

proposed answer: To solve this problem, we need to find the distance from the point $I$ to each face of the tetrahedron $ABCD$. The condition that these distances are equal implies that $I$ is the incenter of the tetrahedron. The formula for the inradius $r$ of a tetrahedron is given by $r = \frac{3V}{S}$, where $V$ is the volume of the tetrahedron and $S$ is the total surface area.

First, we find the volume $V$ of the tetrahedron using the Cayley-Menger determinant. The sides of the tetrahedron are given by $AB = CD = \sqrt{41}$, $AC = BD = \sqrt{80}$, and $BC = AD = \sqrt{89}$. We apply the Cayley-Menger determinant:

\[
288V^2 = -1 \begin{vmatrix} 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 41 & 80 & 89 \\
1 & 41 & 0 & 89 & 80 \\
1 & 80 & 89 & 0 & 41 \\
1 & 89 & 80 & 41 & 0 \end{vmatrix}
\]

Calculating this determinant, we find it equals $-921600$. Therefore, $288V^2 = 921600$, and $V^2 = 3200$, so $V = \sqrt{3200} = 40\sqrt{2}$.

Next, we calculate the surface area $S$. Each face of the tetrahedron is a triangle. The area of a triangle with side lengths $a$, $b$, and $c$ is given by Heron's formula: \( \text{Area} = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} \), where $s = \frac{a+b+c}{2}$ is the semi-perimeter.

For face $ABC$, the side lengths are $AB = \sqrt{41}$, $BC = \sqrt{89}$, $CA = \sqrt{80}$. The semi-perimeter $s = \frac{\sqrt{41} + \sqrt{89} + \sqrt{80}}{2}$. Calculating the area using Heron's formula, we find the area of $\triangle ABC = 20$.

Similarly, we calculate the areas of $\triangle ABD$, $\triangle ACD$, and $\triangle BCD$ and find each area to be $20$.

Thus, the total surface area $S = 4 \times 20 = 80$.

Finally, the inradius $r$ is given by \( r = \frac{3V}{S} = \frac{3 \times 40\sqrt{2}}{80} = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} \).

This is in the form \( \frac{m\sqrt{n}}{p} \), where $m = 3$, $n = 2$, and $p = 2$. The numbers $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime.

Thus, $m+n+p = 3 + 2 + 2 = 7$.
