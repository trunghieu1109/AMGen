Question: Let $\triangle ABC$ have circumcenter $O$ and incenter $I$ with $\overline{IA}\perp\overline{OI}$, circumradius $13$, and inradius $6$. Find $AB\cdot AC$.
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: We are given that in triangle ABC, the circumcenter is O, the incenter is I, the circumradius is R = 13, and the inradius is r = 6. We also have the condition that IA is perpendicular to OI. We need to find the product AB * AC.

Using the condition IA \perp OI, this implies that A is the exsimilicenter of the circumcircle and incircle, meaning A lies on the radical axis of the two circles. This gives us the relation:

\( R^2 - AI^2 = OI^2 - r^2 \).

We also know that \( OI^2 = R^2 - 2Rr \) from the formula for the distance between the circumcenter and incenter.

Substituting this into our radical axis equation gives:

\( R^2 - AI^2 = (R^2 - 2Rr) - r^2 \).

Simplifying, we get:

\( AI^2 = 2Rr - r^2 \).

Substitute R = 13 and r = 6:

\( AI^2 = 2(13)(6) - 6^2 = 156 - 36 = 120 \).

So, \( AI = \sqrt{120} = 2\sqrt{30} \).

Now, we use the formula for AI in terms of the sides of the triangle:

\( AI = \frac{\Delta}{s} \),

where \( \Delta \) is the area of the triangle and \( s \) is the semi-perimeter.

We also know that \( \Delta = rs = 6s \), so \( AI = \frac{6s}{s} = 6 \).

But we found \( AI = 2\sqrt{30} \), so equating gives:

\( 2\sqrt{30} = 6 \), which is incorrect.

We need to use another approach. Using the fact that \( AI^2 = 120 \), we can find the product \( AB \cdot AC \) using the identity:

\( AI^2 = \frac{bc(s-a)}{s} \), where \( a = BC, b = CA, c = AB \).

Since \( AI^2 = 120 \), we have:

\( 120 = \frac{bc(s-a)}{s} \).

But this approach is complicated without more information. Instead, we use the fact that:

\( OI^2 = R^2 - 2Rr \) gives us:

\( OI^2 = 169 - 156 = 13 \).

But this does not help directly. Return to the relation:

\( AI^2 = 2Rr - r^2 \), which we found is true.

The identity we need is:

\( AB \cdot AC = c^2 \), where \( c \) is the length of the side opposite angle A. We have:

\( c^2 = 4Rr \), so:

\( AB \cdot AC = 4 \times 13 \times 6 = 312 \).

Thus, the result is 312.
