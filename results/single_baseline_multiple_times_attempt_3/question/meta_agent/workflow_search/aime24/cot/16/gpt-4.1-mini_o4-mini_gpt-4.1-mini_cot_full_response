Question: Let $\triangle ABC$ have circumcenter $O$ and incenter $I$ with $\overline{IA}\perp\overline{OI}$, circumradius $13$, and inradius $6$. Find $AB\cdot AC$.\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 3RbF', content='We use the perpendicularity IA⊥OI and Euler’s formula OI^2=R(R−2r) to find IA^2=R^2−OI^2=169−13=156, so IA=r/ sin(A/2) gives sin(A/2)=6/√156=3/√39 and hence cosA=1−2sin^2(A/2)=7/13, sinA=2√30/13, so a=BC=2R sinA=4√30.  Next use b=2R sinB, c=2R sinC and express bc=4R^2 sinB sinC; with B+C=π−A and the value of sin(B/2)sin(C/2)=r/(4R sin(A/2)), one finds cos(B−C)=143/169.  Then sinB sinC=½[cos(B−C)+cosA]=(91+143)/(2·169)=234/169, so bc=4·169·234/169=4·234=936?  But wait careful: bc=4R^2 sinB sinC =4·169·(234/169)/2? Oops, sinB sinC= (cos(B−C)+cosA)/2 so bc=4·169·(234/169)/2=2·234=468.\n\nAnswer:468', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
