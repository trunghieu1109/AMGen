Question: Find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid so that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is $999$, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is $99$. The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$.
\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\ \hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\ \hline \end{array}\]
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: Label the grid entries as a,b,c in the top row and d,e,f in the bottom. The horizontal sum gives (100a+10b+c)+(100d+10e+f)=100(a+d)+10(b+e)+(c+f)=999, so a+d=9, b+e=9, c+f=9. The vertical sum gives (10a+d)+(10b+e)+(10c+f)=10(a+b+c)+(d+e+f)=99, so a+b+c=m, d+e+f=99-10m. But d+e+f=(9-a)+(9-b)+(9-c)=27-m, so 27-m=99-10m ⇒9m=72⇒m=8. Hence a+b+c=8, and then d,e,f are determined by d=9-a, etc. The number of nonnegative solutions to a+b+c=8 with 0≤a,b,c≤9 is C(8+3-1,2)=C(10,2)=45.
