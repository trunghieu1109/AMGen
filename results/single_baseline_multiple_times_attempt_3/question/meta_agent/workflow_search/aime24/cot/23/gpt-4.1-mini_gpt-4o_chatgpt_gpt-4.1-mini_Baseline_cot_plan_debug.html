    <pre>We are given a 2x3 grid where each cell contains a digit. We need to satisfy two conditions: the sum of the two numbers formed by reading the rows from left to right is 999, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading the columns from top to bottom is 99. Let&#39;s denote the digits in the grid as follows:

\[ \begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline a &amp; b &amp; c \\ \hline d &amp; e &amp; f \\ \hline \end{array} \]

The first condition gives us:
1. \(100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999\)

The second condition gives us:
2. \(a + d = 9\)
3. \(b + e = 9\)
4. \(c + f = 81\)

From equation (2), we have \(d = 9 - a\).
From equation (3), we have \(e = 9 - b\).
From equation (4), we have \(f = 81 - c\).

Substitute these into equation (1):
\[ 100a + 10b + c + 100(9-a) + 10(9-b) + (81-c) = 999 \]
Simplify:
\[ 100a + 10b + c + 900 - 100a + 90 - 10b + 81 - c = 999 \]
\[ 900 + 90 + 81 = 999 \]
This is true, so any choice of \(a, b, c\) such that \(a + d = 9\), \(b + e = 9\), \(c + f = 81\) will work.

Now, determine the number of solutions:
- For \(a + d = 9\): \(a\) can be any digit from 0 to 9, giving 10 choices.
- For \(b + e = 9\): \(b\) can be any digit from 0 to 9, giving 10 choices.
- For \(c + f = 81\): \(c\) must be 0, 1, or 2, since \(f\) must be a single digit and \(c + f = 81\). This gives 3 choices.

Therefore, the total number of ways is \(10 \times 10 \times 3 = 300\).
