    <pre>Let the grid be:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
A &amp; B &amp; C \\
\hline
D &amp; E &amp; F \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

The two numbers formed by reading left to right are ABC and DEF, and their sum is 999:
\[ ABC + DEF = 999 \]

The three numbers formed by reading top to bottom are AD, BE, CF, and their sum is 99:
\[ AD + BE + CF = 99 \]

Where each letter represents a digit (0-9).

Expressing these in terms of digits:

ABC = 100A + 10B + C
DEF = 100D + 10E + F

Sum left to right:
100A + 10B + C + 100D + 10E + F = 999

AD = 10A + D
BE = 10B + E
CF = 10C + F

Sum top to bottom:
(10A + D) + (10B + E) + (10C + F) = 99
10A + D + 10B + E + 10C + F = 99

Rewrite the two equations:

1) 100A + 10B + C + 100D + 10E + F = 999
2) 10A + D + 10B + E + 10C + F = 99

Group terms:
1) (100A + 100D) + (10B + 10E) + (C + F) = 999
2) (10A + D) + (10B + E) + (10C + F) = 99

Let x = A + D, y = B + E, z = C + F

Rewrite equations in terms of x, y, z:

1) 100A + 100D + 10B + 10E + C + F = 100x + 10y + z = 999
2) 10A + D + 10B + E + 10C + F = 10A + 10B + 10C + D + E + F = 10(A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = 99

But from the definition of x, y, z:
D = x - A
E = y - B
F = z - C

Substitute D, E, F into the second equation:

10A + (x - A) + 10B + (y - B) + 10C + (z - C) = 99
(10A - A) + (10B - B) + (10C - C) + x + y + z = 99
9A + 9B + 9C + x + y + z = 99

Recall from first equation:
100x + 10y + z = 999

From this, z = 999 - 100x - 10y

Substitute z into the second equation:
9A + 9B + 9C + x + y + (999 - 100x - 10y) = 99
9A + 9B + 9C + x + y + 999 - 100x - 10y = 99
9A + 9B + 9C + 999 + x - 100x + y - 10y = 99
9A + 9B + 9C + 999 - 99x - 9y = 99

Bring constants to right:
9A + 9B + 9C - 99x - 9y = 99 - 999 = -900
Divide both sides by 9:
A + B + C - 11x - y = -100

Recall x = A + D, y = B + E, z = C + F

Rewrite:
A + B + C - 11(A + D) - (B + E) = -100
A + B + C - 11A - 11D - B - E = -100
(A - 11A) + (B - B) + C - 11D - E = -100
-10A + C - 11D - E = -100

This is complicated; try to find integer solutions for x, y, z first.

From 100x + 10y + z = 999
x, y, z are sums of digits of two digits, so x, y, z in [0,18]

Try to find x, y, z such that 100x + 10y + z = 999

Try x = 9:
100*9 = 900
Then 10y + z = 99
Try y = 9:
10*9 = 90
Then z = 9

So x=9, y=9, z=9

Now check second equation:
9A + 9B + 9C + x + y + z = 99
9A + 9B + 9C + 9 + 9 + 9 = 99
9A + 9B + 9C + 27 = 99
9A + 9B + 9C = 72
A + B + C = 8

Recall x = A + D = 9
y = B + E = 9
z = C + F = 9

So D = 9 - A
E = 9 - B
F = 9 - C

Digits must be between 0 and 9, so A, B, C must be between 0 and 8 (since D, E, F must be &gt;= 0).

Also A + B + C = 8

Number of non-negative integer solutions to A + B + C = 8 with A, B, C &lt;= 8 is the number of partitions of 8 into 3 parts where each part &lt;= 8. Since 8 &lt;= 8, no restriction.

Number of solutions = C(8+3-1, 3-1) = C(10,2) = 45

For each solution (A,B,C), D=9-A, E=9-B, F=9-C are determined and valid digits.

Therefore, total number of ways = 45

Check example given:
A=0, B=0, C=8
D=9, E=9, F=1
Sum left to right: 008 + 991 = 999
Sum top to bottom: 09 + 09 + 81 = 99

Matches the example.
