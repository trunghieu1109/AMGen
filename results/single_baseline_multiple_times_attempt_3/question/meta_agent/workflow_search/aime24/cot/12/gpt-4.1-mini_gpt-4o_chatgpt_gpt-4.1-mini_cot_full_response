Question: Find the largest possible real part of \[(75+117i)z+\frac{96+144i}{z}\]where $z$ is a complex number with $|z|=4$.\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent g4O4', content='Let z be a complex number such that |z| = 4. We write z = 4e^{iθ} where θ is a real number. Then the expression becomes (75 + 117i)z + \\frac{96 + 144i}{z}. Substituting z = 4e^{iθ}, we get (75 + 117i)(4e^{iθ}) + \\frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{iθ}}. This simplifies to 300e^{iθ} + 468ie^{iθ} + \\frac{24}{e^{iθ}} + \\frac{36i}{e^{iθ}}. We can write e^{iθ} = cosθ + isinθ and \\frac{1}{e^{iθ}} = cosθ - isinθ. So the expression becomes 300(cosθ + isinθ) + 468i(cosθ + isinθ) + 24(cosθ - isinθ) + 36i(cosθ - isinθ). Simplifying, we get (300cosθ - 24cosθ) + i(300sinθ + 468cosθ - 24sinθ + 36cosθ). The real part is 276cosθ + 0sinθ = 276cosθ. The maximum value of 276cosθ is 276, which occurs when cosθ = 1. Therefore, the largest possible real part is 276.\n\nAnswer:276', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
