Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 61Ga', content='We want to maximize Re[(75+117i)z + (96+144i)/z] subject to |z|=4. Write z=4e^{iθ}. Then the expression becomes 4(75+117i)e^{iθ} + (96+144i)/(4e^{iθ}) = 4A e^{iθ} + (B/4)e^{-iθ}. Its real part f(θ)=4·Re(Ae^{iθ})+(1/4)·Re(Be^{-iθ}). Compute A=75+117i, B=96+144i:\nRe(Ae^{iθ})=75cosθ−117sinθ →4×→300cosθ−468sinθ; Re(Be^{-iθ})=96cosθ+144sinθ →¼×→24cosθ+36sinθ. Summing gives f(θ)=324cosθ−432sinθ, whose maximum is sqrt(324²+(-432)²)=√291600=540.\n\nAnswer:540', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
