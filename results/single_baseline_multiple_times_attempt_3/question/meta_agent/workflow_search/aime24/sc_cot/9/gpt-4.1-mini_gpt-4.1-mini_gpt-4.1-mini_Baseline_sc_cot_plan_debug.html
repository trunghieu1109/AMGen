    <pre>Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

    <pre>First, determine the total number of ways to choose 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1, 2, ..., 10}. This is C(10,4).

Jen picks 4 distinct numbers. The winning numbers are also 4 distinct numbers chosen from S.

She wins a prize if at least 2 of her numbers match the winning numbers.

Let A = event that Jen wins the grand prize (all 4 numbers match).
Let B = event that Jen wins a prize (at least 2 numbers match).

We want P(A|B) = P(A and B)/P(B) = P(A)/P(B), because A is a subset of B.

Step 1: Total number of possible winning sets = C(10,4) = 210.

Step 2: Number of ways for Jen to pick her 4 numbers is fixed (she picks one set).

Step 3: Compute P(A): probability that the winning set exactly matches Jen&#39;s set = 1/210.

Step 4: Compute P(B): probability that the winning set has at least 2 numbers in common with Jen&#39;s set.

We can count the number of winning sets that have exactly k elements in common with Jen&#39;s set for k=0,1,2,3,4.

- Exactly 0 in common: choose all 4 from the 6 numbers not in Jen&#39;s set = C(6,4) = 15
- Exactly 1 in common: choose 1 from Jen&#39;s 4 numbers, and 3 from the 6 not in Jen&#39;s set = C(4,1)*C(6,3) = 4*20=80
- Exactly 2 in common: C(4,2)*C(6,2) = 6*15=90
- Exactly 3 in common: C(4,3)*C(6,1) = 4*6=24
- Exactly 4 in common: C(4,4)*C(6,0) = 1*1=1

Total number of winning sets = 210.

Number of winning sets with at least 2 in common = 90 + 24 + 1 = 115.

So P(B) = 115/210.

Therefore, P(A|B) = P(A)/P(B) = (1/210) / (115/210) = 1/115.

So m/n = 1/115, m+n = 1+115 = 116.
