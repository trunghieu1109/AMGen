Question: Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: To solve this problem, we need to calculate two probabilities: the probability of winning a prize and the probability of winning the grand prize. Jen wins a prize if at least 2 of her chosen numbers are among the 4 numbers drawn from the set S. She wins the grand prize if all 4 of her chosen numbers are drawn. We need to find the probability of winning the grand prize given that she won a prize.

Let's first find the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from S, which is C(10, 4).

Next, we find the number of ways Jen can win a prize:
1. She chooses exactly 2 winning numbers: C(4, 2) ways to choose 2 winning numbers and C(6, 2) ways to choose 2 losing numbers.
2. She chooses exactly 3 winning numbers: C(4, 3) ways to choose 3 winning numbers and C(6, 1) ways to choose 1 losing number.
3. She chooses all 4 winning numbers: C(4, 4) ways to choose 4 winning numbers.

Finally, we find the number of ways Jen can win the grand prize, which is simply C(4, 4) because she must choose all 4 winning numbers.

The probability of winning a prize is the sum of the probabilities of the above cases. The probability of winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is the probability of winning the grand prize divided by the probability of winning a prize.

Let's do the calculations:
- Total ways to choose 4 numbers from 10: C(10, 4) = 210.
- Ways to win a prize:
  - Exactly 2 winning numbers: C(4, 2) * C(6, 2) = 6 * 15 = 90.
  - Exactly 3 winning numbers: C(4, 3) * C(6, 1) = 4 * 6 = 24.
  - All 4 winning numbers: C(4, 4) = 1.
  - Total ways to win a prize: 90 + 24 + 1 = 115.
- Ways to win the grand prize: C(4, 4) = 1.

Probability of winning a prize: 115/210.
Probability of winning the grand prize: 1/210.

The probability of winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is (1/210) / (115/210) = 1/115.

Thus, m = 1 and n = 115, so m + n = 116.
