Question: Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.

proposed answer: Let's first establish the relationships in the problem. When Aya walks at speed s km/h, the total time is 4 hours, which includes t minutes at the coffee shop. Therefore, the walking time is 4 - t/60 hours. Since she walks 9 km, we have 9/s = 4 - t/60. When she walks at speed s+2 km/h, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which is 2 + 24/60 = 2.4 hours. This also includes t minutes at the coffee shop, so the walking time is 2.4 - t/60 hours. Thus, 9/(s+2) = 2.4 - t/60. We have two equations: 9/s = 4 - t/60 and 9/(s+2) = 2.4 - t/60. Solving these will give us s and t. From the first equation, t = 240 - 540/s. From the second equation, t = 144 - 540/(s+2). Setting these equal gives 240 - 540/s = 144 - 540/(s+2). Solving for s, we get s = 3. Now, substituting s = 3 into one of the equations for t, we get t = 60. Now, if Aya walks at speed s + 1/2 = 3.5 km/h, the walking time is 9/3.5 hours. This is 2.5714 hours, which is approximately 2 hours and 34 minutes. Including the 60 minutes at the coffee shop, the total time is 2 hours and 34 minutes + 60 minutes = 3 hours and 34 minutes, which is 214 minutes.
