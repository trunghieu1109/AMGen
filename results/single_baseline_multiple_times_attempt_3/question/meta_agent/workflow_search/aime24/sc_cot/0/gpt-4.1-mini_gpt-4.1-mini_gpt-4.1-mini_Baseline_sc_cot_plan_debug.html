    <pre>Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.

Please think step by step and then solve the task.</pre>

    <pre>Let s be the walking speed in km/h. The total time includes walking time and coffee shop time t (in minutes). We know the distance is 9 km. When walking at speed s, total time is 4 hours (240 minutes). When walking at speed s+2, total time is 2 hours 24 minutes (144 minutes).

Set up equations:
Walking time at speed s = 9/s hours = 540/s minutes
Total time at speed s = walking time + t = 540/s + t = 240

Walking time at speed s+2 = 9/(s+2) hours = 540/(s+2) minutes
Total time at speed s+2 = walking time + t = 540/(s+2) + t = 144

Subtract the second equation from the first:
(540/s + t) - (540/(s+2) + t) = 240 - 144
540/s - 540/(s+2) = 96

Multiply both sides by s(s+2):
540(s+2) - 540s = 96 s (s+2)
540s + 1080 - 540s = 96 s^2 + 192 s
1080 = 96 s^2 + 192 s
Divide both sides by 12:
90 = 8 s^2 + 16 s

Rewrite as quadratic:
8 s^2 + 16 s - 90 = 0
Divide by 2:
4 s^2 + 8 s - 45 = 0

Use quadratic formula:
s = [-8 ± sqrt(64 + 720)] / 8
= [-8 ± sqrt(784)] / 8
= [-8 ± 28] / 8

Two solutions:
s = (20)/8 = 2.5 or s = (-36)/8 = -4.5 (discard negative speed)

So s = 2.5 km/h

Find t:
From 540/s + t = 240
540/2.5 + t = 240
216 + t = 240
 t = 24 minutes

Now find the total time when walking at speed s + 0.5 = 3.0 km/h
Walking time = 9 / 3 = 3 hours = 180 minutes
Total time = walking time + t = 180 + 24 = 204 minutes

Answer: 204 minutes
