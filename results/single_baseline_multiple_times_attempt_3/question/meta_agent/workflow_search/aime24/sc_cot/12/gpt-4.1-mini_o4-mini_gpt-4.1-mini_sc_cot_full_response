Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent lHTP', content='We want max Re[(75+117i)z + (96+144i)/z] given |z|=4. Write z=4e^{iθ}. Then A=75+117i, B=96+144i, |A|=√19314, |B|=16√117, argA=α, argB=β. The expression becomes f(θ)=4|A|cos(θ+α)+( |B|/4)cos(θ−β). Expand: f(θ)=P cosθ+Q sinθ with P=4|A|cosα+ (|B|/4)cosβ=4·75+4·6=324, Q=−4|A|sinα+(|B|/4)sinβ=−4·117+4·9=−432. Thus max f=√(324²+(-432)²)=√291600=540.\n\nAnswer:540', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
