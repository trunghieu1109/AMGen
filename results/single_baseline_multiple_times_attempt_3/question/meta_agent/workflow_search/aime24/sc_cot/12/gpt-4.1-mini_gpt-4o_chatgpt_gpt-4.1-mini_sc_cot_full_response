Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent Hc9W', content='Let z = re^{i\\theta} where |z| = 4 implies r = 4. So, z = 4e^{i\\theta}. We need to find the real part of (75+117i)z + \\frac{96+144i}{z}. Substituting z = 4e^{i\\theta}, we have (75+117i)(4e^{i\\theta}) + \\frac{96+144i}{4e^{i\\theta}} = (75+117i)(4\\cos\\theta + 4i\\sin\\theta) + (24+36i)(\\cos\\theta - i\\sin\\theta). The real part of the first term is 4(75\\cos\\theta - 117\\sin\\theta), and the real part of the second term is 24\\cos\\theta + 36\\sin\\theta. Combining these, the real part is 4(75\\cos\\theta - 117\\sin\\theta) + 24\\cos\\theta + 36\\sin\\theta = (300 + 24)\\cos\\theta + (-468 + 36)\\sin\\theta = 324\\cos\\theta - 432\\sin\\theta. This is of the form R\\cos(\\theta + \\phi) where R = \\sqrt{324^2 + 432^2} and \\tan\\phi = -\\frac{432}{324}. R = 540 and the maximum value of R\\cos(\\theta + \\phi) is R. Therefore, the maximum real part is 540.\n\nAnswer:540', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
