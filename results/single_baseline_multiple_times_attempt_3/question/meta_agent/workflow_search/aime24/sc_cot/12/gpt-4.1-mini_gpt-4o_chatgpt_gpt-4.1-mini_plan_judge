Question: Find the largest possible real part of \[(75+117i)z+\frac{96+144i}{z}\]where $z$ is a complex number with $|z|=4$.
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: Let z = re^{i\theta} where |z| = 4 implies r = 4. So, z = 4e^{i\theta}. We need to find the real part of (75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z}. Substituting z = 4e^{i\theta}, we have (75+117i)(4e^{i\theta}) + \frac{96+144i}{4e^{i\theta}} = (75+117i)(4\cos\theta + 4i\sin\theta) + (24+36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta). The real part of the first term is 4(75\cos\theta - 117\sin\theta), and the real part of the second term is 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta. Combining these, the real part is 4(75\cos\theta - 117\sin\theta) + 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta = (300 + 24)\cos\theta + (-468 + 36)\sin\theta = 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta. This is of the form R\cos(\theta + \phi) where R = \sqrt{324^2 + 432^2} and \tan\phi = -\frac{432}{324}. R = 540 and the maximum value of R\cos(\theta + \phi) is R. Therefore, the maximum real part is 540.
