Question: Eight circles of radius $34$ are sequentially tangent, and two of the circles are tangent to $AB$ and $BC$ of triangle $ABC$, respectively. $2024$ circles of radius $1$ can be arranged in the same manner. The inradius of triangle $ABC$ can be expressed as $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: We take AC as the base: place equal circles of radius r tangent to AC and sequentially tangent to each other, with the first touching AB and the last touching BC.  If N circles fit, then projecting centers onto AC shows
AC – r[cot(A/2)+cot(C/2)] = 2r(N–1).
Hence AC = 2r(N–1) + rS′ where S′ = cot(A/2)+cot(C/2).  For r=34, N=8 gives AC = 476 + 34 S′, and for r=1, N=2024 gives AC = 4046 + S′.  Equate:
476 + 34S′ = 4046 + S′ ⇒ 33S′ = 3570 ⇒ S′ = 1190/11,
so AC = 4046 + 1190/11 = 45696/11.  But cot(A/2)+cot(C/2) = S′ = (s–a + s–c)/r_in = b/r_in with b = AC.  Thus r_in = b/S′ = (45696/11)/(1190/11) = 45696/1190 = 192/5, so m+n=192+5=197.
