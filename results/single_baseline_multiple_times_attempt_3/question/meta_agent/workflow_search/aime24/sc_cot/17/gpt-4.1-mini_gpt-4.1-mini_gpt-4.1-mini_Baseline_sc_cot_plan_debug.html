    <pre>We are given the equation a + b + c = 300, where a, b, c are nonnegative integers, and the condition a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000. We want to find the number of triples (a,b,c) satisfying both. 

Step 1: Simplify the second equation. Notice that a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b can be grouped as a^2(b+c) + b^2(a+c) + c^2(a+b).
Since a + b + c = 300, we have b + c = 300 - a, a + c = 300 - b, a + b = 300 - c.
So the expression becomes a^2(300 - a) + b^2(300 - b) + c^2(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Step 2: Rewrite the expression:
a^2(300 - a) = 300a^2 - a^3,
b^2(300 - b) = 300b^2 - b^3,
c^2(300 - c) = 300c^2 - c^3.

Sum these:
300(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) - (a^3 + b^3 + c^3) = 6,000,000.

Step 3: Use the identity for sum of cubes:
(a + b + c)^3 = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 3(a + b)(b + c)(c + a) - 3abc.
But this is complicated; instead, consider the symmetry and try to find a simpler approach.

Step 4: Consider the expression a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = sum over all pairs of a^2b + b^2a terms. This can be rewritten as sum over all pairs (i,j) with i != j of a_i^2 a_j.

Step 5: Another approach is to note that the expression is symmetric and equals (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.

Check this identity:
(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) = a(ab + bc + ca) + b(ab + bc + ca) + c(ab + bc + ca)
= a^2b + abc + aca + ab^2 + b^2c + bca + ac^2 + bc^2 + c^2a
= a^2b + a^2c + ab^2 + b^2c + ac^2 + bc^2 + 3abc

So (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b

Therefore,
(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000

Given a + b + c = 300,
300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000

Step 6: Divide both sides by 3:
100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000

Step 7: We want to find the number of nonnegative integer triples (a,b,c) with a + b + c = 300 and 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.

Step 8: Since a,b,c are nonnegative integers summing to 300, and the equation is symmetric, consider the case where one variable is zero.

Case 1: c = 0
Then a + b = 300
ab + bc + ca = ab + 0 + 0 = ab
abc = 0
So 100ab - 0 = 2,000,000
100ab = 2,000,000
ab = 20,000

We want integer pairs (a,b) with a + b = 300 and ab = 20,000.

From a + b = 300, b = 300 - a
ab = a(300 - a) = 20,000
300a - a^2 = 20,000
a^2 - 300a + 20,000 = 0

Solve quadratic:
Discriminant = 300^2 - 4*20,000 = 90,000 - 80,000 = 10,000
sqrt(10,000) = 100

Roots:
a = (300 ± 100)/2
= (400)/2 = 200 or (200)/2 = 100

So a = 100 or 200, then b = 200 or 100

So (a,b,c) = (100,200,0) or (200,100,0)

Similarly, by symmetry, c=0, a,b as above; b=0, a,c as above; a=0, b,c as above

Case 2: b=0
Then a + c = 300
ab + bc + ca = 0 + 0 + a*c = ac
abc = 0
So 100ac = 2,000,000
ac = 20,000

Similarly, a + c = 300, ac = 20,000
Same quadratic as above, solutions (a,c) = (100,200) or (200,100)

Case 3: a=0
Then b + c = 300
bc = 20,000
Solutions (b,c) = (100,200) or (200,100)

So from these cases, we get 6 solutions:
(100,200,0), (200,100,0), (100,0,200), (200,0,100), (0,100,200), (0,200,100)

Step 9: Now consider the case where all variables are positive.
Try to find integer solutions with all positive a,b,c.

Rewrite:
100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000

Try to find integer triples (a,b,c) with sum 300 and satisfying above.

Try to guess a = b = c = 100
Check:
ab + bc + ca = 100*100 + 100*100 + 100*100 = 10,000 + 10,000 + 10,000 = 30,000
abc = 100*100*100 = 1,000,000

Compute 100*(30,000) - 1,000,000 = 3,000,000 - 1,000,000 = 2,000,000

This matches the required value!

So (100,100,100) is a solution.

Step 10: Are there other solutions with all positive integers?
Try to check if any other solutions exist.

Try a=b=c=100 is symmetric and works.

Try a=b, c=300 - 2a
Then
ab + bc + ca = a*b + b*c + c*a
= a*a + a*(300 - 2a) + a*(300 - 2a) = a^2 + 2a(300 - 2a) = a^2 + 600a - 4a^2 = 600a - 3a^2
abc = a*a*(300 - 2a) = a^2(300 - 2a) = 300a^2 - 2a^3

So
100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 100(600a - 3a^2) - (300a^2 - 2a^3) = 60,000a - 300a^2 - 300a^2 + 2a^3 = 60,000a - 600a^2 + 2a^3

Set equal to 2,000,000:
60,000a - 600a^2 + 2a^3 = 2,000,000

Divide by 2:
30,000a - 300a^2 + a^3 = 1,000,000

Rewrite:
a^3 - 300a^2 + 30,000a - 1,000,000 = 0

Try integer roots dividing 1,000,000 (try a=100):
100^3 - 300*100^2 + 30,000*100 - 1,000,000 = 1,000,000 - 3,000,000 + 3,000,000 - 1,000,000 = 0

So a=100 is a root, consistent with previous solution.

Try a=50:
50^3 - 300*50^2 + 30,000*50 - 1,000,000 = 125,000 - 750,000 + 1,500,000 - 1,000,000 = -625,000 + 500,000 = -125,000 ≠ 0

Try a=150:
150^3 - 300*150^2 + 30,000*150 - 1,000,000 = 3,375,000 - 6,750,000 + 4,500,000 - 1,000,000 = 125,000 ≠ 0

Since this cubic has only one integer root at 100, no other integer solutions for a=b.

Step 11: By symmetry, the only solutions are the ones found:
- (100,100,100)
- The six solutions with one variable zero and the other two 100 and 200 in either order.

Step 12: Count the solutions.
(100,100,100) is one solution.
For the zero cases, each zero case gives two solutions (since a and b can be swapped), and there are three variables that can be zero, so total 3*2=6 solutions.

Step 13: Check if permutations of these solutions produce distinct triples.

For (100,100,100), all permutations are the same.

For (100,200,0), permutations are:
(100,200,0), (100,0,200), (200,100,0), (200,0,100), (0,100,200), (0,200,100)

These are exactly the 6 solutions found.

Therefore, total number of solutions is 1 + 6 = 7.
