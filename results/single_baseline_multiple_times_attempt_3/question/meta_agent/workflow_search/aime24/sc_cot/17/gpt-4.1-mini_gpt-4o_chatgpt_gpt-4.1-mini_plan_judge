Question: Find the number of triples of nonnegative integers \((a,b,c)\) satisfying \(a + b + c = 300\) and
\begin{equation*}
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.
\end{equation*}
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: We need to find the number of nonnegative integer triples (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 and the equation a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000 holds. First, simplify the given equation by factoring: a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = ab(a + b) + bc(b + c) + ca(c + a). Consider the symmetry and the constraints, and try small values of a, b, and c. Check if any simple combinations satisfy both the sum and the equation. However, given the complexity and large numbers, a systematic approach or computer verification might be necessary to find solutions.
