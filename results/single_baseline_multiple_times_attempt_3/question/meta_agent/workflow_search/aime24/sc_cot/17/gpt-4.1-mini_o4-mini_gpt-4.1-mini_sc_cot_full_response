Question: Find the number of triples of nonnegative integers \((a,b,c)\) satisfying \(a + b + c = 300\) and
\begin{equation*}
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.
\end{equation*}\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent jAGY', content='We need nonneg integer triples (a,b,c) summing to 300 with S = a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.  Observing symmetry, first consider one variable zero: say c=0, then a+b=300 and S=ab(a+b)=300ab=6e6, so ab=20000 with a+b=300. That quadratic gives a=100 or 200, hence (a,b)=(100,200),(200,100). Permuting the zero coordinate yields 6 solutions. Next consider all positive: using symmetric polynomials one finds the only solution is a=b=c=100, giving S=6Â·100^3=6e6. No other positive or two-zero cases work. Total ordered triples = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nAnswer:7', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
