Question: Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). Then \(OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\).

proposed answer: To solve this problem, we need to find the point C on segment AB such that it does not belong to any segment from the family \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). The family \(\mathcal{F}\) consists of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. 

First, let's parameterize the line segment \(\overline{AB}\). The coordinates of \(A\) are \((\tfrac{1}{2}, 0)\) and \(B\) are \((0, \tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2})\). A point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\) can be expressed as \(C = (1-t)A + tB = \left(\tfrac{1}{2}(1-t), \tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t\right)\) for \(0 < t < 1\).

Next, consider a segment \(\overline{PQ}\) with \(P = (x, 0)\) and \(Q = (0, y)\) such that the length of \(\overline{PQ}\) is 1. Therefore, \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = 1\), which implies \(x^2 + y^2 = 1\).

For point \(C\) to lie on \(\overline{PQ}\), it must satisfy the equation of the line through \(P\) and \(Q\). The equation of the line through \((x, 0)\) and \((0, y)\) is \(yx + xy = xy\), which simplifies to \(y = -\frac{x}{y} x + y\).

Substitute \(C = \left(\tfrac{1}{2}(1-t), \tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t\right)\) into this line equation:
\[ \tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t = -\frac{x}{y} \cdot \tfrac{1}{2}(1-t) + y. \]

Rearrange to find \(t\) such that this equation holds for no \((x, y)\) other than when \(C\) is on \(\overline{AB}\).

To find such \(t\), we note that the slope of \(\overline{AB}\) is \(-\sqrt{3}\). For \(C\) to not lie on any other segment, it must have a unique slope \(-\sqrt{3}\) with respect to \((x, 0)\) and \((0, y)\). Thus, we solve:
\[ \frac{\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t - 0}{\tfrac{1}{2}(1-t) - 0} = -\sqrt{3}. \]

Simplifying, we find:
\[ \tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t = -\sqrt{3} \cdot \tfrac{1}{2}(1-t). \]
\[ \tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t = -\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t. \]

Solving for \(t\), we find that the terms cancel, and we need to find \(t\) such that \(t = \frac{1}{2}\).

The coordinates of \(C\) are \(C = \left(\tfrac{1}{2}(1-\tfrac{1}{2}), \tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\cdot\tfrac{1}{2}\right) = \left(\tfrac{1}{4}, \tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{4}\right)\).

Finally, we calculate \(OC^2\):
\[ OC^2 = \left(\tfrac{1}{4}\right)^2 + \left(\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{4}\right)^2 = \tfrac{1}{16} + \tfrac{3}{16} = \tfrac{4}{16} = \tfrac{1}{4}. \]

Thus, \(p = 1\) and \(q = 4\), so \(p + q = 5\).
