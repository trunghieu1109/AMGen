Question: Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). Then \(OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\).\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent KXCM', content='We have the family of unit‐length segments with x‐intercept p and y‐intercept q satisfying p^2+q^2=1, hence the line equations x/p+y/q=1. Their envelope satisfies simultaneously x/p+y/q=1 and its derivative wrt p zero. Eliminating gives the envelope curve x=p^3, y=(1−p^2)^{3/2}. The desired point C is the unique intersection of this envelope with line AB (the special segment of the family), whose equation is 2x+2y/√3=1.  Substituting x=p^3, y=(1−p^2)^{3/2} and setting p=sinθ, (1−p^2)^{1/2}=cosθ reduces to cos^3θ+√3 sin^3θ=√3/2, which holds at θ=30°.  Thus p=1/2, giving C=(p^3,(√3/2)^3)=(1/8,3√3/8).  Then OC^2=(1/8)^2+(3√3/8)^2=1/64+27/64=28/64=7/16, so p+q=7+16=23.\n\nAnswer:23', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
