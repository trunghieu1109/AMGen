    <pre>We are given points O=(0,0), A=(1/2,0), and B=(0, sqrt(3)/2). The segment AB has length 1 because the distance between A and B is sqrt((1/2 - 0)^2 + (0 - sqrt(3)/2)^2) = sqrt(1/4 + 3/4) = sqrt(1) = 1. The family F consists of segments PQ of length 1 with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis, both in the first quadrant.

We want to find the unique point C on AB (not A or B) that does not lie on any segment in F except AB itself.

Parametrize AB: Let t in [0,1], then C(t) = A + t(B - A) = (1/2,0) + t(-1/2, sqrt(3)/2) = (1/2 - t/2, t*sqrt(3)/2).

So C_x = (1 - t)/2 and C_y = t*sqrt(3)/2.

A segment PQ in F has P = (a,0), Q = (0,b), with a,b &gt; 0 and length PQ = 1, so a^2 + b^2 = 1.

The segment PQ is the line segment from (a,0) to (0,b).

We want to check if C lies on PQ for some (a,b) with a^2 + b^2 = 1.

The parametric form of PQ is: R(s) = P + s(Q - P) = (a,0) + s(-a,b) = (a(1 - s), bs), s in [0,1].

C lies on PQ if for some s in [0,1]:
C_x = a(1 - s),
C_y = b s.

From these, s = C_y / b and 1 - s = C_x / a.

So s = C_y / b,
1 - s = C_x / a.

Adding: s + (1 - s) = C_y / b + C_x / a = 1.

Therefore, C_x / a + C_y / b = 1.

Since a^2 + b^2 = 1, and a,b &gt; 0, we can write b = sqrt(1 - a^2).

We want to find if there exist a,b &gt; 0 with a^2 + b^2 = 1 such that C_x / a + C_y / b = 1.

Rewrite as:
C_x / a + C_y / sqrt(1 - a^2) = 1.

Define f(a) = C_x / a + C_y / sqrt(1 - a^2), for a in (0,1).

We want to find if f(a) = 1 has a solution in a in (0,1).

Recall C_x = (1 - t)/2, C_y = t*sqrt(3)/2.

So f(a) = ((1 - t)/2) / a + (t*sqrt(3)/2) / sqrt(1 - a^2).

We want to find if there exists a in (0,1) such that f(a) = 1.

For a fixed t, f(a) is continuous and tends to infinity as a -&gt; 0+ or a -&gt; 1-.

So f(a) has a minimum in (0,1). The minimum value of f(a) for fixed t is:

min_{a in (0,1)} f(a) = ?

If this minimum is greater than 1, then no solution exists, so C does not lie on any segment PQ in F other than AB.

If the minimum equals 1, then C lies on some PQ in F.

We want to find t such that the minimum of f(a) over a in (0,1) is exactly 1.

Set derivative of f(a) with respect to a to zero to find minimum:

f(a) = C_x / a + C_y / sqrt(1 - a^2)

f&#39;(a) = -C_x / a^2 + C_y * (1/2) * (1 - a^2)^(-3/2) * 2a = -C_x / a^2 + C_y * a / (1 - a^2)^{3/2}

Set f&#39;(a) = 0:

-C_x / a^2 + C_y * a / (1 - a^2)^{3/2} = 0

=&gt; C_y * a / (1 - a^2)^{3/2} = C_x / a^2

=&gt; C_y * a^3 = C_x * (1 - a^2)^{3/2}

Cube both sides:

(C_y * a^3)^2 = (C_x)^2 * (1 - a^2)^3

But better to keep as is:

C_y * a^3 = C_x * (1 - a^2)^{3/2}

Rewrite:

(C_y / C_x) = (1 - a^2)^{3/2} / a^3

Recall C_x = (1 - t)/2, C_y = t*sqrt(3)/2

So

(C_y / C_x) = (t*sqrt(3)/2) / ((1 - t)/2) = t*sqrt(3) / (1 - t)

Therefore:

t*sqrt(3) / (1 - t) = (1 - a^2)^{3/2} / a^3

Define g(a) = (1 - a^2)^{3/2} / a^3

We want to find t and a in (0,1) satisfying:

t*sqrt(3) / (1 - t) = g(a)

Also, at minimum f(a) = 1:

f(a) = C_x / a + C_y / sqrt(1 - a^2) = 1

Substitute C_x and C_y:

((1 - t)/2) / a + (t*sqrt(3)/2) / sqrt(1 - a^2) = 1

Multiply both sides by 2:

(1 - t)/a + t*sqrt(3) / sqrt(1 - a^2) = 2

Express t in terms of a from the first equation:

From t*sqrt(3) / (1 - t) = g(a),

t*sqrt(3) = g(a)(1 - t)

t*sqrt(3) = g(a) - g(a) t

t*sqrt(3) + g(a) t = g(a)

t (sqrt(3) + g(a)) = g(a)

t = g(a) / (sqrt(3) + g(a))

Now substitute t into the second equation:

(1 - t)/a + t*sqrt(3) / sqrt(1 - a^2) = 2

1 - t = 1 - g(a)/(sqrt(3) + g(a)) = (sqrt(3) + g(a) - g(a)) / (sqrt(3) + g(a)) = sqrt(3) / (sqrt(3) + g(a))

So:

(1 - t)/a = sqrt(3) / (a (sqrt(3) + g(a)))

t*sqrt(3) / sqrt(1 - a^2) = (g(a) / (sqrt(3) + g(a))) * sqrt(3) / sqrt(1 - a^2) = g(a) * sqrt(3) / ((sqrt(3) + g(a)) * sqrt(1 - a^2))

Sum:

sqrt(3) / (a (sqrt(3) + g(a))) + g(a) * sqrt(3) / ((sqrt(3) + g(a)) * sqrt(1 - a^2)) = 2

Multiply both sides by (sqrt(3) + g(a)):

sqrt(3)/a + g(a) * sqrt(3) / sqrt(1 - a^2) = 2 (sqrt(3) + g(a))

Divide both sides by sqrt(3):

1/a + g(a) / sqrt(1 - a^2) = 2 (sqrt(3) + g(a)) / sqrt(3)

Recall g(a) = (1 - a^2)^{3/2} / a^3

Replace g(a) / sqrt(1 - a^2) = (1 - a^2)^{3/2} / (a^3 * sqrt(1 - a^2)) = (1 - a^2) / a^3

So left side:

1/a + (1 - a^2) / a^3 = (a^2 + 1 - a^2) / a^3 = 1 / a^3

Therefore,

1 / a^3 = 2 (sqrt(3) + g(a)) / sqrt(3)

Multiply both sides by sqrt(3):

sqrt(3) / a^3 = 2 (sqrt(3) + g(a))

So:

sqrt(3) / a^3 - 2 sqrt(3) = 2 g(a)

Divide both sides by 2:

(sqrt(3) / (2 a^3)) - sqrt(3) = g(a)

Recall g(a) = (1 - a^2)^{3/2} / a^3

So:

(1 - a^2)^{3/2} / a^3 = (sqrt(3) / (2 a^3)) - sqrt(3)

Multiply both sides by a^3:

(1 - a^2)^{3/2} = sqrt(3)/2 - sqrt(3) a^3

Rewrite:

(1 - a^2)^{3/2} + sqrt(3) a^3 = sqrt(3)/2

Let x = a^2, a in (0,1), so x in (0,1).

Then (1 - x)^{3/2} + sqrt(3) a^3 = sqrt(3)/2

But a^3 = a * a^2 = a * x = sqrt(x) * x = x^{3/2}

So:

(1 - x)^{3/2} + sqrt(3) x^{3/2} = sqrt(3)/2

Divide both sides by sqrt(3):

(1 / sqrt(3)) (1 - x)^{3/2} + x^{3/2} = 1/2

Multiply both sides by 2:

(2 / sqrt(3)) (1 - x)^{3/2} + 2 x^{3/2} = 1

We want to solve for x in (0,1).

Try to find x numerically:

Try x = 1/4 = 0.25:

(1 - 0.25)^{3/2} = (0.75)^{3/2} = 0.75^{1.5} ≈ 0.6495

x^{3/2} = 0.25^{1.5} = (0.25)^1 * sqrt(0.25) = 0.25 * 0.5 = 0.125

Left side = (2 / sqrt(3)) * 0.6495 + 2 * 0.125 ≈ (2 / 1.732) * 0.6495 + 0.25 ≈ 1.1547 * 0.6495 + 0.25 ≈ 0.75 + 0.25 = 1.0

So x = 1/4 satisfies the equation.

Therefore, a^2 = 1/4, a = 1/2.

Recall t = g(a) / (sqrt(3) + g(a))

Calculate g(a):

g(a) = (1 - a^2)^{3/2} / a^3 = (1 - 1/4)^{3/2} / (1/2)^3 = (3/4)^{3/2} / (1/8) = ((sqrt(3)/2)^3) / (1/8) = ( (sqrt(3))^3 / 8 ) / (1/8) = (3 * sqrt(3) / 8) * 8 = 3 * sqrt(3)

So g(a) = 3 * sqrt(3)

Then:

t = g(a) / (sqrt(3) + g(a)) = 3 * sqrt(3) / (sqrt(3) + 3 * sqrt(3)) = 3 * sqrt(3) / (4 * sqrt(3)) = 3/4

So t = 3/4.

Recall C(t) = ((1 - t)/2, t * sqrt(3)/2) = ((1 - 3/4)/2, (3/4) * sqrt(3)/2) = (1/4 / 2, (3/4) * sqrt(3)/2) = (1/8, 3 * sqrt(3) / 8)

Compute OC^2 = (1/8)^2 + (3 * sqrt(3)/8)^2 = 1/64 + 9 * 3 / 64 = 1/64 + 27/64 = 28/64 = 7/16.

So p = 7, q = 16.

Therefore, p + q = 7 + 16 = 23.
