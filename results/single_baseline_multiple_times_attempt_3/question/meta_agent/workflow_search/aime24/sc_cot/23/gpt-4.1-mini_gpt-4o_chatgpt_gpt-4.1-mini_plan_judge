Question: Find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid so that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is $999$, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is $99$. The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$.
\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\ \hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\ \hline \end{array}\]

proposed answer: We need to fill a 2x3 grid with digits such that the sum of the numbers formed by reading left to right is 999, and the sum of the numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99. Let's denote the digits in the grid as follows:

\[ \begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline a & b & c \\ \hline d & e & f \\ \hline \end{array} \]

From the problem, we have the following conditions:

1. The sum of the numbers formed by rows is: \( 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999 \).
2. The sum of the numbers formed by columns is: \( (a + d) + (b + e) + (c + f) = 99 \).

Let's simplify these equations:

From condition 1:
\[ 100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999 \]

From condition 2:
\[ (a + d) + (b + e) + (c + f) = 99 \]

Let \( x = a + d \), \( y = b + e \), \( z = c + f \). Then we have:

\[ 100x + 10y + z = 999 \]
\[ x + y + z = 99 \]

We subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate \( z \):

\[ 99x + 9y = 900 \]

Simplifying, we get:

\[ 11x + y = 100 \]

Now we have two equations:
1. \( x + y + z = 99 \)
2. \( 11x + y = 100 \)

From the second equation, \( y = 100 - 11x \). Substitute into the first equation:

\[ x + (100 - 11x) + z = 99 \]

\[ x + 100 - 11x + z = 99 \]

\[ -10x + 100 + z = 99 \]

\[ z = 10x - 1 \]

Now, \( x, y, z \) must be non-negative integers, and \( z = 10x - 1 \) must also be a valid sum of digits (0 to 18). Since \( z \) must be non-negative, \( 10x - 1 \geq 0 \) implies \( x \geq 1 \). Also, \( z \leq 18 \) gives \( 10x - 1 \leq 18 \), thus \( x \leq 1.9 \), so \( x \leq 1 \).

Therefore, \( x = 1 \) is the only possibility.

If \( x = 1 \), then \( z = 10(1) - 1 = 9 \).

Substitute \( x = 1 \) into \( 11x + y = 100 \):

\[ 11(1) + y = 100 \]

\[ y = 100 - 11 = 89 \]

So, \( x = 1 \), \( y = 89 \), \( z = 9 \).

Now, we need to find the number of ways to assign digits to the grid:

1. \( a + d = 1 \). The only possibilities are \( (a, d) = (0, 1) \) or \( (1, 0) \).
2. \( b + e = 89 \). Since these are digits, \( b = 9 \), \( e = 80 \) is impossible, so \( b = 8 \), \( e = 9 \).
3. \( c + f = 9 \). The possibilities are \( (c, f) = (0, 9), (1, 8), (2, 7), (3, 6), (4, 5), (5, 4), (6, 3), (7, 2), (8, 1), (9, 0) \).

For each choice of \( (a, d) \) and \( (c, f) \), there are 10 possibilities. Since \( (b, e) \) is fixed, the total number of ways is:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \].
