Question: Find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid so that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is $999$, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is $99$. The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$.
\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\ \hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\ \hline \end{array}\]
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: Let's denote the digits in the 2x3 grid as:

| a | b | c |
| d | e | f |

From the problem:
- The sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is 999.
  That is: (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999

- The sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99.
  That is: (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99

We have two equations:
1) 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999
2) (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99

Rewrite equation 2:
10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99
(10a + 10b + 10c) + (d + e + f) = 99
10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99

From equation 1:
100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999
Group terms:
100a + 100d + 10b + 10e + c + f = 999
100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999

We have two systems:
I) 100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999
II) 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99

Let:
A = a + d
B = b + e
C = c + f

Then:
I) 100A + 10B + C = 999
II) 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99
But d + e + f = (A + B + C) - (a + b + c)
So II) becomes:
10(a + b + c) + (A + B + C) - (a + b + c) = 99
Simplify:
9(a + b + c) + (A + B + C) = 99

We know from I): 100A + 10B + C = 999
Since 999 = 900 + 90 + 9, and digits sums are between 0 and 18 (because each sum is two digits from 0 to 9), the only way to get 999 is:
A = 9
B = 9
C = 9

So:
A = a + d = 9
B = b + e = 9
C = c + f = 9

From II):
9(a + b + c) + (A + B + C) = 99
9(a + b + c) + 27 = 99
9(a + b + c) = 72
(a + b + c) = 8

Since a + b + c = 8 and a + d = 9, b + e = 9, c + f = 9, and all digits are from 0 to 9:
- For each pair (a, d), a + d = 9 with digits 0-9
- Similarly for (b, e) and (c, f)
- The sum a + b + c = 8

We need to count the number of triples (a, b, c) with digits 0-9, sum 8, and for each such triple, the corresponding d, e, f are determined uniquely as d = 9 - a, e = 9 - b, f = 9 - c (all digits 0-9 guaranteed).

Number of nonnegative integer solutions to a + b + c = 8 with each digit <= 9 is the number of integer solutions without restrictions since 8 <= 9*3.
Number of solutions = C(8 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(10, 2) = 45

Therefore, there are 45 ways to choose (a,b,c), and each uniquely defines (d,e,f).

Hence, the total number of ways to fill the grid is 45.
