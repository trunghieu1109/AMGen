Question: Find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid so that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is $999$, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is $99$. The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$.
\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\ \hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\ \hline \end{array}\]
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: We label the grid:
row1: a b c; row2: d e f, digits 0–9.  Reading left-to-right gives the 3-digit numbers 100a+10b+c and 100d+10e+f, whose sum is 999: 
100(a+d)+10(b+e)+(c+f)=999.
Reading top-to-bottom gives  the 2-digit numbers 10a+d, 10b+e, 10c+f, whose sum is 99: 
(10a+d)+(10b+e)+(10c+f)=99.
Set S1=a+d, S2=b+e, S3=c+f.  From 100S1+10S2+S3=999 we get S1=9, S2=9, S3=9.  Then the vertical-sum equation is 9(a+b+c)+(S1+S2+S3)=99 ⇒ 9(a+b+c)+27=99 ⇒ a+b+c=8.
Thus any nonnegative digits a,b,c summing to 8 (with d=9−a, e=9−b, f=9−c automatically in 0–9) yields a solution.  The number of nonnegative solutions to a+b+c=8 is C(8+3−1,2)=C(10,2)=45.
