Question: Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.

proposed answer: We want AP where P is the second intersection of AD with the circumcircle, and D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C.  By the power‐of‐a‐point from D to the circle, DB^2 = DA·DP, and since DP = DA – AP we get AP = DA – (DB^2)/DA.  To find DA and DB, place B=(0,0), C=(9,0), A at the intersection of circles radius 5 and 10, giving A=(1/3,4√14/3).  Compute the circumcenter O, the radius R, then the tangent lines at B and C meet at D.  Parametrize the line AD, solve for its second intersection P with the circle, and compute AP.  Numerically this yields AP = 100/13, so m+n = 100+13 = 113.
