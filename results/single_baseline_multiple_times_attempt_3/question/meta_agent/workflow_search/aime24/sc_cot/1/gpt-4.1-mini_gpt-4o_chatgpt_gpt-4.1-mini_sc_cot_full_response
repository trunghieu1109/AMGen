Question: Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent JMGg', content="We begin by noting that triangle ABC is inscribed in circle \\(\\omega\\), and the tangents at B and C intersect at D. By the Power of a Point theorem, we know that \\(AD \\cdot AP = AB^2\\). We can use the lengths AB = 5, AC = 10, and BC = 9 to find the circumradius R of the triangle using the formula \\(R = \\frac{abc}{4K}\\), where \\(K\\) is the area of the triangle. First, we find the semi-perimeter \\(s = \\frac{5 + 10 + 9}{2} = 12\\). Using Heron's formula, the area \\(K\\) is \\(\\sqrt{12(12-5)(12-10)(12-9)} = \\sqrt{12 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} = \\sqrt{504} = 12 \\sqrt{7}\\). Then, the circumradius \\(R = \\frac{5 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 9}{4 \\cdot 12 \\sqrt{7}} = \\frac{45}{2 \\sqrt{7}} = \\frac{45 \\sqrt{7}}{14}\\). By the tangent-secant theorem, \\(AD^2 = AB \\cdot AC = 5 \\cdot 10 = 50\\), and \\(AP = \\frac{AB^2}{AD} = \\frac{25}{AD}\\). By the power of the point theorem, \\(AD \\cdot AP = AB^2\\), thus \\(AD \\cdot \\frac{25}{AD} = 25\\). Solving for \\(AD\\), we use the fact that the power of D with respect to the circle is \\((DB)^2 = (DC)^2 = DA \\cdot DP\\), where \\(DP = 2R\\). Hence, \\(AD = \\sqrt{AB \\cdot AC} = \\sqrt{50}\\). Therefore, \\(AP = \\frac{25}{\\sqrt{50}} = \\frac{25}{5\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\). Rationalizing the denominator gives \\(AP = \\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{5 \\cdot 2}{2 \\cdot 2} = \\frac{5}{2}\\).\n\nAnswer:7", prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
