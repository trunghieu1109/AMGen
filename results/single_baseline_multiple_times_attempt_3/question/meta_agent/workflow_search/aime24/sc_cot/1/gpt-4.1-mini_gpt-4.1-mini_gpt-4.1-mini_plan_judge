proposed answer: Given triangle ABC inscribed in circle ω, with tangents at B and C intersecting at D, and line AD intersecting ω again at P. We know AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10.

Step 1: Use the property of the tangents and the point D. The point D is the intersection of tangents at B and C, so D lies on the polar of A with respect to circle ω.

Step 2: Since D lies on the intersection of tangents at B and C, D is the exsimilic center of the circle and the circle with respect to points B and C.

Step 3: The points A, D, and P are collinear, with P on ω different from A.

Step 4: By the tangent-secant theorem (power of a point), the power of point D with respect to ω is DB^2 = DC^2.

Step 5: Use the Power of a Point theorem for point A with respect to ω:
Since A lies on ω, the power of A is zero.

Step 6: Use the property that (AP)(AD) = (AB)(AC) because P lies on ω and A, D, P are collinear.

We know AB=5, AC=10, so (AB)(AC) = 50.

Step 7: We want to find AP = m/n in lowest terms, and then find m+n.

Step 8: To find AP, we need to find AD, then use (AP)(AD) = 50.

Step 9: Use coordinate geometry or the law of cosines to find the coordinates of points B and C, then find D as the intersection of the tangents at B and C, and then find P as the second intersection of line AD with ω.

Step 10: Place the triangle in coordinate plane for convenience.

Let’s place points B and C on the x-axis:
Let B = (0,0), C = (9,0) since BC=9.

Step 11: Find coordinates of A.
We know AB=5 and AC=10.

Distance AB=5 implies distance from A to B is 5:
(A_x - 0)^2 + (A_y - 0)^2 = 25

Distance AC=10 implies distance from A to C is 10:
(A_x - 9)^2 + (A_y - 0)^2 = 100

Subtract equations:
(A_x)^2 + (A_y)^2 = 25
(A_x - 9)^2 + (A_y)^2 = 100

Subtract:
(A_x - 9)^2 - (A_x)^2 = 75

Expanding:
(A_x^2 - 18A_x + 81) - A_x^2 = 75

-18A_x + 81 = 75

-18A_x = -6

A_x = 1/3

Plug back to find A_y:
(1/3)^2 + A_y^2 = 25

1/9 + A_y^2 = 25

A_y^2 = 25 - 1/9 = (225/9) - (1/9) = 224/9

A_y = sqrt(224/9) = (sqrt(224))/3

224 = 16 * 14 = 4^2 * 14

So A_y = (4 * sqrt(14))/3

So A = (1/3, (4 * sqrt(14))/3)

Step 12: Find the circle ω.
The circle passes through B(0,0), C(9,0), and A(1/3, (4*sqrt(14))/3).

Find the center O and radius R.

The center lies on the perpendicular bisector of BC and AB.

Perpendicular bisector of BC:
Midpoint of BC is M_bc = (4.5, 0)
Since BC is on x-axis, its perpendicular bisector is vertical line x=4.5

Perpendicular bisector of AB:
Midpoint of AB is M_ab = ((0 + 1/3)/2, (0 + (4*sqrt(14))/3)/2) = (1/6, (2*sqrt(14))/3)

Slope of AB:
(A_y - B_y)/(A_x - B_x) = ((4*sqrt(14))/3 - 0) / (1/3 - 0) = ((4*sqrt(14))/3) / (1/3) = 4*sqrt(14)

Perpendicular slope = -1/(4*sqrt(14))

Equation of perpendicular bisector of AB:
(y - (2*sqrt(14))/3) = -1/(4*sqrt(14)) * (x - 1/6)

We know x=4.5 on the perpendicular bisector of BC.

Plug x=4.5:
(y - (2*sqrt(14))/3) = -1/(4*sqrt(14)) * (4.5 - 1/6)

4.5 - 1/6 = 4.5 - 0.1666... = 4.3333 = 13/3

So:
(y - (2*sqrt(14))/3) = -1/(4*sqrt(14)) * (13/3) = -13/(12*sqrt(14))

Therefore:
y = (2*sqrt(14))/3 - 13/(12*sqrt(14))

Find a common denominator:
(2*sqrt(14))/3 = (8*sqrt(14))/12

So:
y = (8*sqrt(14))/12 - 13/(12*sqrt(14)) = (8*sqrt(14)*sqrt(14) - 13) / (12*sqrt(14))

Note sqrt(14)*sqrt(14) = 14

So numerator:
8 * 14 - 13 = 112 - 13 = 99

Thus:
y = 99 / (12*sqrt(14))

So center O = (4.5, 99/(12*sqrt(14)))

Step 13: Find radius R = distance from O to B(0,0):

R^2 = (4.5 - 0)^2 + (99/(12*sqrt(14)) - 0)^2
= 4.5^2 + (99/(12*sqrt(14)))^2
= 20.25 + (99^2) / (144 * 14)
= 20.25 + 9801 / 2016

Calculate 9801 / 2016:
2016 * 4 = 8064
9801 - 8064 = 1737
So 9801/2016 = 4 + 1737/2016

Simplify 1737/2016:
GCD of 1737 and 2016 is 3
1737/3 = 579
2016/3 = 672

So 1737/2016 = 579/672

579/672 approx 0.861

So R^2 approx 20.25 + 4.861 = 25.111

Step 14: Find equations of tangents at B and C.

Tangent at B:
The radius OB is vector O - B = (4.5, 99/(12*sqrt(14)))
Tangent at B is perpendicular to OB.

Slope of OB = (99/(12*sqrt(14))) / 4.5 = (99/(12*sqrt(14))) * (1/4.5) = 99 / (54*sqrt(14)) = 11 / (6*sqrt(14))

Slope of tangent at B = negative reciprocal = - (6*sqrt(14))/11

Equation of tangent at B passing through B(0,0):
y = - (6*sqrt(14))/11 * x

Tangent at C:
OC = O - C = (4.5 - 9, 99/(12*sqrt(14)) - 0) = (-4.5, 99/(12*sqrt(14)))

Slope of OC = (99/(12*sqrt(14))) / (-4.5) = - (99)/(54*sqrt(14)) = -11 / (6*sqrt(14))

Slope of tangent at C = negative reciprocal = 6*sqrt(14)/11

Equation of tangent at C passing through C(9,0):
y - 0 = (6*sqrt(14))/11 * (x - 9)

y = (6*sqrt(14))/11 * (x - 9)

Step 15: Find point D as intersection of the two tangents:

From tangent at B:
y = - (6*sqrt(14))/11 * x

From tangent at C:
y = (6*sqrt(14))/11 * (x - 9)

Set equal:
- (6*sqrt(14))/11 * x = (6*sqrt(14))/11 * (x - 9)

Divide both sides by (6*sqrt(14))/11 (nonzero):
- x = x - 9

- x - x = -9

-2x = -9

x = 9/2 = 4.5

Find y:
y = - (6*sqrt(14))/11 * 4.5 = - (6*sqrt(14))/11 * (9/2) = - (54*sqrt(14))/22 = - (27*sqrt(14))/11

So D = (4.5, - (27*sqrt(14))/11)

Step 16: Line AD passes through A(1/3, (4*sqrt(14))/3) and D(4.5, - (27*sqrt(14))/11)

Slope of AD:

m_AD = (y_D - y_A) / (x_D - x_A) = 
(- (27*sqrt(14))/11 - (4*sqrt(14))/3) / (4.5 - 1/3)

Find numerator:
Common denominator 33:
- (27*sqrt(14))/11 = - (81*sqrt(14))/33
(4*sqrt(14))/3 = (44*sqrt(14))/33

Sum:
- (81*sqrt(14))/33 - (44*sqrt(14))/33 = - (125*sqrt(14))/33

Denominator:
4.5 - 1/3 = 9/2 - 1/3 = (27/6) - (2/6) = 25/6

So slope:
m_AD = - (125*sqrt(14))/33 * (6/25) = - (125*sqrt(14)*6) / (33*25) = - (750*sqrt(14)) / 825

Simplify 750/825:
Divide numerator and denominator by 75:
750/75 = 10
825/75 = 11

So m_AD = - (10*sqrt(14))/11

Step 17: Equation of line AD passing through A:

(y - (4*sqrt(14))/3) = m_AD (x - 1/3)

(y - (4*sqrt(14))/3) = - (10*sqrt(14))/11 * (x - 1/3)

Step 18: Find point P, second intersection of AD with ω.

Parametrize line AD:

x = 1/3 + t

y = (4*sqrt(14))/3 - (10*sqrt(14))/11 * t

Step 19: Equation of circle ω:

Center O = (4.5, 99/(12*sqrt(14)))
Radius squared R^2 = (distance from O to B)^2 = 20.25 + 9801/2016

Rewrite radius squared as fraction:
20.25 = 81/4

9801/2016 simplified by dividing numerator and denominator by 3:
9801/3 = 3267
2016/3 = 672

So R^2 = 81/4 + 3267/672

Find common denominator 672:
81/4 = (81*168)/672 = 13608/672

So R^2 = (13608 + 3267)/672 = 16875/672

Simplify numerator and denominator by 3:
16875/3 = 5625
672/3 = 224

So R^2 = 5625/224

Step 20: Plug parametric line into circle equation:

(x - 4.5)^2 + (y - 99/(12*sqrt(14)))^2 = R^2

x - 4.5 = (1/3 + t) - 4.5 = t - 4.1666... = t - 25/6

y - 99/(12*sqrt(14)) = (4*sqrt(14))/3 - (10*sqrt(14))/11 * t - 99/(12*sqrt(14))

Calculate constant part:
(4*sqrt(14))/3 - 99/(12*sqrt(14))

Find common denominator 12*sqrt(14):
(4*sqrt(14))/3 = (16*sqrt(14))/12

But 16*sqrt(14)/12 is not compatible with 99/(12*sqrt(14)) because denominators differ by sqrt(14).

Rewrite (4*sqrt(14))/3 as (4*sqrt(14))/3 = (4*sqrt(14))/3

Better to rationalize 99/(12*sqrt(14)):

99/(12*sqrt(14)) = (99*sqrt(14)) / (12*14) = (99*sqrt(14)) / 168

Similarly, (4*sqrt(14))/3 = (4*sqrt(14))/3 = (224*sqrt(14))/168

So difference:
(224*sqrt(14))/168 - (99*sqrt(14))/168 = (125*sqrt(14))/168

So:
y - 99/(12*sqrt(14)) = (125*sqrt(14))/168 - (10*sqrt(14))/11 * t

Step 21: Let’s denote:
X = t - 25/6
Y = (125*sqrt(14))/168 - (10*sqrt(14))/11 * t

Circle equation:
X^2 + Y^2 = 5625/224

Calculate X^2:
(t - 25/6)^2 = t^2 - (25/3) t + (625/36)

Calculate Y^2:
Y = sqrt(14) * (125/168 - (10/11) t)

Y^2 = 14 * (125/168 - (10/11) t)^2 = 14 * [ (125/168)^2 - 2*(125/168)*(10/11)*t + (10/11)^2 * t^2 ]

Calculate each term:
(125/168)^2 = 15625 / 28224
2*(125/168)*(10/11) = 2 * 125 * 10 / (168 * 11) = 2500 / 1848 = 1250 / 924
(10/11)^2 = 100 / 121

So:
Y^2 = 14 * [15625/28224 - (1250/924) t + (100/121) t^2 ]

= 14 * 15625/28224 - 14 * (1250/924) t + 14 * (100/121) t^2

Calculate each coefficient:
14 * 15625 / 28224 = (218750) / 28224

14 * 1250 / 924 = (17500) / 924

14 * 100 / 121 = 1400 / 121

So:
Y^2 = 218750 / 28224 - (17500 / 924) t + (1400 / 121) t^2

Step 22: Sum X^2 + Y^2 = R^2

X^2 + Y^2 = t^2 - (25/3) t + (625/36) + 218750 / 28224 - (17500 / 924) t + (1400 / 121) t^2 = 5625 / 224

Group terms:
(t^2 + (1400 / 121) t^2) + (- (25/3) t - (17500 / 924) t) + (625/36 + 218750 / 28224) = 5625 / 224

Calculate coefficients:
1 + 1400/121 = (121 + 1400)/121 = 1521/121

- (25/3) - (17500 / 924) = find common denominator 924:
(25/3) = (25 * 308) / 924 = 7700 / 924

So sum = - (7700 / 924) - (17500 / 924) = - (25200 / 924) = - (300 / 11)

Constants:
625/36 + 218750 / 28224

Find common denominator 28224:
625/36 = (625 * 784) / 28224 = 490000 / 28224

Sum = (490000 + 218750) / 28224 = 708750 / 28224

Step 23: Equation:
(1521/121) t^2 - (300/11) t + (708750 / 28224) = 5625 / 224

Bring right side to left:
(1521/121) t^2 - (300/11) t + (708750 / 28224) - 5625 / 224 = 0

Find common denominator for constants:
28224 and 224

28224 / 224 = 126

So 5625 / 224 = 5625 * 126 / 28224 = 708750 / 28224

So constants cancel out:
(708750 / 28224) - (708750 / 28224) = 0

So equation reduces to:
(1521/121) t^2 - (300/11) t = 0

Step 24: Factor t:
t [ (1521/121) t - (300/11) ] = 0

So t=0 or t = (300/11) / (1521/121) = (300/11) * (121/1521) = (300 * 121) / (11 * 1521)

Calculate numerator and denominator:
300 * 121 = 36300
11 * 1521 = 16731

Simplify fraction:
Find gcd of 36300 and 16731

16731 divides into 36300 twice: 2 * 16731 = 33462
36300 - 33462 = 2838

GCD(16731, 2838):
16731 mod 2838 = 16731 - 5*2838 = 16731 - 14190 = 2541

GCD(2838, 2541):
2838 - 2541 = 297

GCD(2541, 297):
2541 mod 297 = 2541 - 8*297 = 2541 - 2376 = 165

GCD(297, 165):
297 mod 165 = 297 - 1*165 = 132

GCD(165, 132):
165 mod 132 = 165 - 1*132 = 33

GCD(132, 33):
132 mod 33 = 0

So gcd is 33

Divide numerator and denominator by 33:
36300 / 33 = 1100
16731 / 33 = 507

So t = 1100 / 507

Step 25: Recall t=0 corresponds to point A, so other intersection P corresponds to t=1100/507

Step 26: Find AP = distance between A and P:

P_x = 1/3 + t = 1/3 + 1100/507
Find common denominator 507:
1/3 = 169/507

So P_x = (169 + 1100)/507 = 1269/507

P_y = (4*sqrt(14))/3 - (10*sqrt(14))/11 * t
Calculate first term:
(4*sqrt(14))/3 = (4*sqrt(14))/3

Calculate second term:
(10*sqrt(14))/11 * (1100/507) = (10*sqrt(14)) * (1100/507) / 11 = (11000*sqrt(14)) / (11*507) = (11000*sqrt(14)) / 5577

Simplify 11000/5577:
Divide numerator and denominator by 11:
11000/11 = 1000
5577/11 = 507

So second term = (1000*sqrt(14))/507

So P_y = (4*sqrt(14))/3 - (1000*sqrt(14))/507

Find common denominator 507:
(4*sqrt(14))/3 = (4*sqrt(14)) * (169/169) / 3 = (676*sqrt(14)) / 507

So P_y = (676*sqrt(14))/507 - (1000*sqrt(14))/507 = (-324*sqrt(14))/507

Step 27: Calculate vector AP = P - A:

A_x = 1/3 = 169/507
AP_x = 1269/507 - 169/507 = 1100/507

A_y = (4*sqrt(14))/3 = (676*sqrt(14))/507
AP_y = (-324*sqrt(14))/507 - (676*sqrt(14))/507 = (-1000*sqrt(14))/507

Step 28: Calculate length AP:

AP = sqrt( (1100/507)^2 + (-1000*sqrt(14)/507)^2 )

= (1/507) * sqrt(1100^2 + (1000^2 * 14))

Calculate inside sqrt:
1100^2 = 1,210,000
1000^2 * 14 = 1,000,000 * 14 = 14,000,000

Sum = 1,210,000 + 14,000,000 = 15,210,000

sqrt(15,210,000) = sqrt(15,210,000)

Factor 15,210,000:
15,210,000 = 15,210 * 1000

Try to find perfect squares:
15,210,000 = 15,210,000

Check if 15,210,000 is a perfect square:
123^2 = 15129
12345^2 = 152399025

Try sqrt(15,210,000) = 3900
3900^2 = 15,210,000

Yes, 3900^2 = 15,210,000

So sqrt(15,210,000) = 3900

Therefore:
AP = 3900 / 507

Simplify fraction:
Divide numerator and denominator by 3:
3900 / 3 = 1300
507 / 3 = 169

AP = 1300 / 169

Divide numerator and denominator by 13:
1300 / 13 = 100
169 / 13 = 13

So AP = 100 / 13

Step 29: m = 100, n = 13

m + n = 100 + 13 = 113
