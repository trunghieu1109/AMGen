Question: A list of positive integers has the following properties:
$\bullet$ The sum of the items in the list is $30$.
$\bullet$ The unique mode of the list is $9$.
$\bullet$ The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.
Find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: Let's denote the list as a sorted list of positive integers. The sum of all elements is 30, the unique mode is 9, and the median is an integer not in the list. 

Step 1: The mode is 9 and is unique, so 9 appears more times than any other number. At least twice.

Step 2: The median is an integer not in the list. For the median to be an integer not in the list, the list length must be even because the median is the average of the two middle numbers. That average is an integer not present in the list.

Step 3: Let the list length be n, and n is even. The median is the average of the n/2-th and (n/2 + 1)-th elements. The average is an integer not in the list.

Step 4: The sum is 30.

Try n=4:
Let the list be [a, b, c, d] sorted.
Median = (b + c)/2 is an integer not in the list.
Mode is 9, so 9 appears more than once.
Try two 9's: so 9 appears twice.
Sum of elements = a + b + c + d = 30.
Since 9 appears twice, and the list is sorted, the two 9's must be in the middle or at the end.
Try [x, 9, 9, y].
Median = (9 + 9)/2 = 9, but 9 is in the list, so median equals 9, which is in the list, contradicting the condition.
Try [9, 9, x, y], median = (9 + x)/2.
Median must be integer and not in the list.
Try median = 8, so (9 + x)/2 = 8 => x = 7.
List is [9, 9, 7, y], sorted: [7, 9, 9, y] or [7, 9, 9, y], but y must be >=9.
Sum = 7 + 9 + 9 + y = 25 + y = 30 => y = 5.
But 5 < 7, so list sorted is [5, 7, 9, 9].
Median = (7 + 9)/2 = 8, integer not in the list, good.
Mode is 9, appears twice, unique mode.
Sum is 5 + 7 + 9 + 9 = 30.
All conditions satisfied.

Step 5: Calculate sum of squares: 5^2 + 7^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 = 25 + 49 + 81 + 81 = 236.
