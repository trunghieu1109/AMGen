Question: A list of positive integers has the following properties:
$\bullet$ The sum of the items in the list is $30$.
$\bullet$ The unique mode of the list is $9$.
$\bullet$ The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.
Find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

proposed answer: We need a list of positive integers summing to 30, unique mode 9, median is an integer not in the list. Since if the list length n is odd, the median is an element (would appear), contradiction, so n is even. Let 9 appear exactly twice (if more, the leftover sum forces other duplicates or ties). Then the other numbers sum to 12, are all distinct (to keep 9 the unique mode), and when combined with two 9s give an even-length list whose two middle terms average to an integer m not in the list. Testing partitions of 12 into distinct positives shows that only {5,7} (with two 9s) works: the sorted list [5,7,9,9] sums to 30, has unique mode 9, and median=(7+9)/2=8, which is an integer not in the list. Sum of squares is 5^2+7^2+9^2+9^2=25+49+81+81=236.
