Question: Alice chooses a set $A$ of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets $B$ of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of $B$ belongs to $A$. Bob's list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A.

proposed answer: Let's analyze the problem step by step. Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B such that the maximum element of B is in A. Bob's list has 2024 sets. We need to find the sum of the elements of A. 

Consider an element x in A. For each x, Bob can form sets B where the maximum element is x. These sets can include any subset of {1, 2, ..., x-1} along with x itself. There are 2^(x-1) subsets of {1, 2, ..., x-1}, and each subset forms a set B when x is included as the maximum element. Thus, for each x in A, there are 2^(x-1) sets B. 

The total number of sets B that Bob lists is the sum of 2^(x-1) for each x in A. We know this sum is 2024. 

Let's find which numbers x satisfy this condition. We start by trying small values of x and calculating 2^(x-1) to see which combination sums to 2024. 

2^0 = 1
2^1 = 2
2^2 = 4
2^3 = 8
2^4 = 16
2^5 = 32
2^6 = 64
2^7 = 128
2^8 = 256
2^9 = 512
2^10 = 1024
2^11 = 2048

The number 2024 is slightly less than 2048, which is 2^11. We can try to express 2024 as the sum of powers of 2. 

2024 = 2048 - 24 = 2048 - 16 - 8 = 2^11 - 2^4 - 2^3

So, we have 2024 = 2^10 + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0.

This corresponds to the set A = {11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 3, 2, 1}.

Now, let's find the sum of the elements of A: 11 + 10 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 62.
