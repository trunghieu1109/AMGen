    <pre>Let A be the set chosen by Alice. Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers such that the maximum element of B belongs to A. For each element a in A, the number of finite nonempty sets B with max(B) = a is equal to the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., a} that contain a, since the maximum element is a. The total number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., a} is 2^a, and the number of subsets containing a is 2^{a-1} (because for each subset containing a, the other elements can be any subset of {1, 2, ..., a-1}). Therefore, for each a in A, the number of such sets B with max(B) = a is 2^{a-1}. Bob&#39;s list consists of all such sets for all a in A, so the total number of sets is the sum over a in A of 2^{a-1}. We are given that this sum is 2024: sum_{a in A} 2^{a-1} = 2024. We want to find sum_{a in A} a. Now, 2024 in binary is 111111001000, but let&#39;s try to express 2024 as a sum of powers of two of the form 2^{a-1}. Since 2024 is less than 2^{11} = 2048, the largest possible a in A is at most 11. Let&#39;s try to find a set A such that sum 2^{a-1} = 2024. Let&#39;s write 2024 in binary: 2024 = 111111001000_2. Let&#39;s write out powers of two: 2^0=1, 2^1=2, 2^2=4, 2^3=8, 2^4=16, 2^5=32, 2^6=64, 2^7=128, 2^8=256, 2^9=512, 2^{10}=1024. We want to write 2024 as sum of 2^{a-1} for a in A. Let&#39;s check 2024 in terms of powers of two: 2024 = 1024 + 512 + 256 + 128 + 64 + 32 + 8. This corresponds to 2^{10} + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^3. So the exponents are 10,9,8,7,6,5,3, which correspond to a-1, so a = 11,10,9,8,7,6,4. Therefore, A = {4,6,7,8,9,10,11}. The sum of elements of A is 4 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 = 55.
