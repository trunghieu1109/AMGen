Question: Alice chooses a set $A$ of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets $B$ of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of $B$ belongs to $A$. Bob's list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A.
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: We need the total number of nonempty B with max(B) in A: that is ∑_{a∈A}2^{a−1}=2024. Write 2024 in binary: 2024=2^{10}+2^9+2^8+2^7+2^6+2^5+2^3. Thus A={11,10,9,8,7,6,4} and sum(A)=11+10+9+8+7+6+4=55.

Answer:55
Extracted answer: 55
Correct answer: 055
