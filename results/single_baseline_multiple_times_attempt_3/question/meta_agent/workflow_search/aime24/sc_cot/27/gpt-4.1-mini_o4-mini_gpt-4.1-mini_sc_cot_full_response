Question: Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent ehGH', content='Let N=1000A+100B+10C+D. Replacing each digit by 1 gives four numbers all ≡0 mod7. Set up congruences mod7 for each replacement, solve the system: A≡5, B≡6, C≡2 mod7, D≡4 mod7. Within digit range, C can be 2 or 9; the larger gives N=5694. Then Q=5694//1000=5, R=5694 mod1000=694, so Q+R=699.\n\nAnswer:699', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
