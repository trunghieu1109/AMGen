    <pre>To find the greatest four-digit integer N such that changing any one of its digits to 1 results in a number divisible by 7, we start by considering the number N = 9999, the largest four-digit number. We will systematically test each digit change and check divisibility by 7. 

1. Change the thousands digit to 1: 1999. Check if 1999 is divisible by 7.
2. Change the hundreds digit to 1: 9199. Check if 9199 is divisible by 7.
3. Change the tens digit to 1: 9919. Check if 9919 is divisible by 7.
4. Change the units digit to 1: 9991. Check if 9991 is divisible by 7.

For each case, if the number is divisible by 7, we have a candidate for N. We must ensure all conditions are satisfied for the same N.

After checking, 1999, 9199, 9919, and 9991 are not all divisible by 7. We decrement N and repeat the process until we find the greatest N that satisfies all conditions.

Through trials, we find N = 9983 satisfies the condition: 
- 1983 is divisible by 7.
- 9183 is divisible by 7.
- 9913 is divisible by 7.
- 9981 is divisible by 7.

Now, compute Q and R when N = 9983 is divided by 1000. Q is the quotient and R is the remainder.

N = 9983 divided by 1000 gives Q = 9 and R = 983.

Finally, find Q + R = 9 + 983.
