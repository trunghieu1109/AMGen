Question: Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: Let N=1000A+100B+10C+D. Replacing each digit by 1 gives four numbers all ≡0 mod7. Set up congruences mod7 for each replacement, solve the system: A≡5, B≡6, C≡2 mod7, D≡4 mod7. Within digit range, C can be 2 or 9; the larger gives N=5694. Then Q=5694//1000=5, R=5694 mod1000=694, so Q+R=699.
