proposed answer: Let N be a four-digit number with digits ABCD. We have N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D, where A, B, C, D are digits and A ≠ 0. The property is: changing any one digit of N to 1 results in a number divisible by 7.

We consider the four numbers formed by changing each digit to 1:
1. Change A to 1: 1000*1 + 100B + 10C + D = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D
2. Change B to 1: 1000A + 100*1 + 10C + D = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D
3. Change C to 1: 1000A + 100B + 10*1 + D = 1000A + 100B + 10 + D
4. Change D to 1: 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 = N - D + 1

All these numbers must be divisible by 7.

Let N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

From 1: 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 0 (mod 7)
From 2: 1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡ 0 (mod 7)
From 3: 1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡ 0 (mod 7)
From 4: N - D + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 7) => (1000A + 100B + 10C + 1) ≡ 0 (mod 7)

We also know N must be divisible by 7 when digits are changed to 1, but N itself is not necessarily divisible by 7.

Let's simplify mod 7:

Calculate mod 7 of powers of 10:
10 ≡ 3 (mod 7)
100 = 10*10 ≡ 3*3 = 9 ≡ 2 (mod 7)
1000 = 10*100 ≡ 3*2 = 6 (mod 7)

So:
1) 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡ 0 (mod 7)
2) 1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡ 6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡ 0 (mod 7)
3) 1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡ 6A + 2B + 3 + D ≡ 0 (mod 7)
4) 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡ 6A + 2B + 3C + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 7)

We have four congruences:
(1) 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡ 0 (mod 7)
(2) 6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡ 0 (mod 7)
(3) 6A + 2B + 3 + D ≡ 0 (mod 7)
(4) 6A + 2B + 3C + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 7)

Subtract (4) from (1):
(1) - (4): (6 + 2B + 3C + D) - (6A + 2B + 3C + 1) ≡ 0 - 0 (mod 7)
6 - 6A + D - 1 ≡ 0 (mod 7)
5 - 6A + D ≡ 0 (mod 7)
D ≡ 6A - 5 (mod 7)

Subtract (4) from (2):
(2) - (4): (6A + 2 + 3C + D) - (6A + 2B + 3C + 1) ≡ 0
2 + D - 2B - 1 ≡ 0
1 + D - 2B ≡ 0
D ≡ 2B - 1 (mod 7)

Subtract (4) from (3):
(3) - (4): (6A + 2B + 3 + D) - (6A + 2B + 3C + 1) ≡ 0
3 + D - 3C - 1 ≡ 0
2 + D - 3C ≡ 0
D ≡ 3C - 2 (mod 7)

We have three expressions for D mod 7:
D ≡ 6A - 5 (mod 7)
D ≡ 2B - 1 (mod 7)
D ≡ 3C - 2 (mod 7)

Set equal:
6A - 5 ≡ 2B - 1 (mod 7)
=> 6A - 2B ≡ 4 (mod 7)

6A - 5 ≡ 3C - 2 (mod 7)
=> 6A - 3C ≡ 3 (mod 7)

2B - 1 ≡ 3C - 2 (mod 7)
=> 2B - 3C ≡ -1 ≡ 6 (mod 7)

Now solve the system:
(1) 6A - 2B ≡ 4 (mod 7)
(2) 6A - 3C ≡ 3 (mod 7)
(3) 2B - 3C ≡ 6 (mod 7)

Try all A from 1 to 9 (since A is a digit and first digit of a 4-digit number):
For each A, find B and C satisfying (1) and (2), then check (3).

Try A=9:
6*9=54 ≡ 54 mod 7 = 54 - 49 = 5
(1) 5 - 2B ≡ 4 => -2B ≡ -1 => 2B ≡ 1 => B ≡ 4 (mod 7)
(2) 5 - 3C ≡ 3 => -3C ≡ -2 => 3C ≡ 2
Since 3*5=15 ≡ 1 mod 7, inverse of 3 mod 7 is 5
C ≡ 2*5=10 ≡ 3 mod 7

So B ≡ 4, C ≡ 3 mod 7
Possible digits for B are 4 or 11 (not digit), so B=4
Possible digits for C are 3 or 10 (not digit), so C=3

Check (3): 2B - 3C = 2*4 - 3*3 = 8 - 9 = -1 ≡ 6 mod 7
This matches (3).

Now find D:
D ≡ 6A - 5 = 6*9 - 5 = 54 - 5 = 49 ≡ 0 mod 7
D ≡ 2B - 1 = 2*4 - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7 ≡ 0 mod 7
D ≡ 3C - 2 = 3*3 - 2 = 9 - 2 = 7 ≡ 0 mod 7

So D ≡ 0 mod 7, D can be 0 or 7 (digits).

We want the greatest four-digit number N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D with these digits:
A=9, B=4, C=3, D=7 (choose 7 to maximize N)

N = 9000 + 400 + 30 + 7 = 9437

Now Q and R are quotient and remainder when N is divided by 1000:
Q = floor(9437/1000) = 9
R = 9437 % 1000 = 437

Q + R = 9 + 437 = 446
