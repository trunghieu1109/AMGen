Question: Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations:
\[\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}\]\[\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}\]\[\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}\]
Then the value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: Given the system:
log2(x/(yz)) = 1/2,
log2(y/(xz)) = 1/3,
log2(z/(xy)) = 1/4.

Rewrite each logarithmic equation in exponential form:
x/(yz) = 2^(1/2) = sqrt(2),
y/(xz) = 2^(1/3),
z/(xy) = 2^(1/4).

Multiply all three equations:
(x/(yz)) * (y/(xz)) * (z/(xy)) = sqrt(2) * 2^(1/3) * 2^(1/4).

On the left side:
(x/(yz)) * (y/(xz)) * (z/(xy)) = (x*y*z) / (y*z * x*z * x*y) = (xyz) / (x^2 y^2 z^2) = 1/(xyz).

On the right side:
sqrt(2) * 2^(1/3) * 2^(1/4) = 2^(1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4).
Find the sum of exponents:
1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 = 6/12 + 4/12 + 3/12 = 13/12.

So:
1/(xyz) = 2^(13/12) => xyz = 2^(-13/12).

We want |log2(x^4 y^3 z^2)| = |4 log2(x) + 3 log2(y) + 2 log2(z)|.

Let a = log2(x), b = log2(y), c = log2(z).

From the original equations:
log2(x/(yz)) = a - b - c = 1/2,
log2(y/(xz)) = b - a - c = 1/3,
log2(z/(xy)) = c - a - b = 1/4.

We have the system:
a - b - c = 1/2,
b - a - c = 1/3,
c - a - b = 1/4.

Add all three equations:
(a - b - c) + (b - a - c) + (c - a - b) = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4

Left side:
a - b - c + b - a - c + c - a - b = (a - a - a) + (-b + b - b) + (-c - c + c) = -a - b - c.

Right side:
1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 = 13/12.

So:
-a - b - c = 13/12 => a + b + c = -13/12.

Recall xyz = 2^(a + b + c) = 2^(-13/12), consistent.

Now solve for a, b, c:
From first equation: a = b + c + 1/2
Substitute into second: b - (b + c + 1/2) - c = 1/3 => b - b - c - 1/2 - c = 1/3 => -2c - 1/2 = 1/3 => -2c = 1/3 + 1/2 = (2/6 + 3/6) = 5/6 => c = -5/12.

From third equation: c - a - b = 1/4
Substitute a = b + c + 1/2:
c - (b + c + 1/2) - b = 1/4
c - b - c - 1/2 - b = 1/4
-2b - 1/2 = 1/4
-2b = 1/4 + 1/2 = 3/4
b = -3/8.

Find a:
a = b + c + 1/2 = -3/8 - 5/12 + 1/2
Find common denominator 24:
-3/8 = -9/24, -5/12 = -10/24, 1/2 = 12/24
Sum: (-9/24) + (-10/24) + (12/24) = (-9 -10 + 12)/24 = (-7)/24

So a = -7/24.

Calculate 4a + 3b + 2c:
4*(-7/24) + 3*(-3/8) + 2*(-5/12) = (-28/24) + (-9/8) + (-10/12)
Convert to denominator 24:
-28/24 + (-27/24) + (-20/24) = (-28 - 27 - 20)/24 = -75/24 = -25/8.

Absolute value:
| -25/8 | = 25/8.

m = 25, n = 8, m + n = 33.
