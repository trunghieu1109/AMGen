Question: Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations:
\[\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}\]\[\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}\]\[\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}\]
Then the value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent gdkz', content='We set a=log2 x, b=log2 y, c=log2 z. Then the equations become:\n1) a–b–c=1/2\n2) –a+b–c=1/3\n3) –a–b+c=1/4\nSum gives –(a+b+c)=13/12 → a+b+c=–13/12.\nFrom (1): a–(b+c)=1/2 → a–(–13/12–a)=1/2 →2a+13/12=1/2 →2a=–7/12→a=–7/24.\nThen b+c=–19/24.  From (2): b–c=1/3+a=1/3–7/24=1/24.  Solve: b=[(b+c)+(b–c)]/2=[–19/24+1/24]/2=–3/8, c=–5/12.\nCompute log2(x^4y^3z^2)=4a+3b+2c=–7/6–9/8–5/6=–25/8, so absolute value is 25/8.  Hence m+n=25+8=33.\n\nAnswer:33', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
