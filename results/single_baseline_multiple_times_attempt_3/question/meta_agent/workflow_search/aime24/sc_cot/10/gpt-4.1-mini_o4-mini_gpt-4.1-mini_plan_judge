Question: Rectangles $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are drawn such that $D,E,C,F$ are collinear. Also, $A,D,H,G$ all lie on a circle. If $BC=16$,$AB=107$,$FG=17$, and $EF=184$, what is the length of $CE$?
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: We set the shared collinear line DC as the x-axis. Place D at (0,0), C at (107,0). Rectangle ABCD lies above, so A at (0,16), B at (107,16). Let E=(a,0), F=(a+184,0) with E between D and C, so a in (0,107). The other rectangle lies below. The circle through A,D,H,G gives a quadratic in a with solutions a=3 or a=-187; the ordering D–E–C–F requires a=3. Hence CE=|107−3|=104.
