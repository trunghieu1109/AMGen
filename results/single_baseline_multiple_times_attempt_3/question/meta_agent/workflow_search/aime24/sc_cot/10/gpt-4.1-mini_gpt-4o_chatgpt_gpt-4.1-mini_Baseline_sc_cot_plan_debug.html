    <pre>We are given two rectangles $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ with certain conditions. The points $D, E, C, F$ are collinear, which suggests that $CE$ is the segment connecting $C$ and $E$. We are also given that $A, D, H, G$ lie on a circle, which implies that quadrilateral $ADHG$ is cyclic. The lengths of the sides are given: $BC = 16$, $AB = 107$, $FG = 17$, and $EF = 184$. To find $CE$, we can use the fact that since $D, E, C, F$ are collinear, we can apply the properties of similar triangles or the Pythagorean theorem if applicable. Since $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are rectangles, $BC = AD$ and $EF = HG$. Thus, the length of $CE$ can be found by noting the configuration and using the information that the rectangles are aligned such that $CE = AD + DE$. $AD$ is equal to $BC = 16$. Since $D, E, C, F$ are collinear, $DE = EF = 184$. Therefore, $CE = AD + DE = 16 + 184 = 200$.
