Question: Rectangles $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are drawn such that $D,E,C,F$ are collinear. Also, $A,D,H,G$ all lie on a circle. If $BC=16$,$AB=107$,$FG=17$, and $EF=184$, what is the length of $CE$?\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent gmDh', content='We are given two rectangles $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ with certain conditions. The points $D, E, C, F$ are collinear, which suggests that $CE$ is the segment connecting $C$ and $E$. We are also given that $A, D, H, G$ lie on a circle, which implies that quadrilateral $ADHG$ is cyclic. The lengths of the sides are given: $BC = 16$, $AB = 107$, $FG = 17$, and $EF = 184$. To find $CE$, we can use the fact that since $D, E, C, F$ are collinear, we can apply the properties of similar triangles or the Pythagorean theorem if applicable. Since $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are rectangles, $BC = AD$ and $EF = HG$. Thus, the length of $CE$ can be found by noting the configuration and using the information that the rectangles are aligned such that $CE = AD + DE$. $AD$ is equal to $BC = 16$. Since $D, E, C, F$ are collinear, $DE = EF = 184$. Therefore, $CE = AD + DE = 16 + 184 = 200$.\n\nAnswer:200', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
