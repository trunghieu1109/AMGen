Question: Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent BQgf', content='We have 8 vertices of a regular octagon independently colored R/B. We want the probability that some rotation (including the identity) sends all B‐vertices into positions originally colored R. Equivalently, defining A_s as the set of colorings with no two B’s at distance s mod 8, we need the size of the union over s=0,…,7 of A_s. Noting A_0 consists only of the all‐R coloring (size 1), and A_s=A_{8−s}, we reduce to four distinct constraints s=1,2,3,4 with sizes |A_1|=47, |A_2|=49, |A_3|=47, |A_4|=81. We then compute all pairwise intersections |A_i∩A_j| by counting independent sets in the corresponding circulant graphs, yielding 21,31,17,21,25,25 for the pairs (1,2),(1,3),(1,4),(2,3),(2,4),(3,4). Triple intersections give 17,17,31,17 for (123),(124),(134),(234), and the intersection of all four is 9.  Inclusion–exclusion on the four A_i gives |A_1∪A_2∪A_3∪A_4|=224−140+82−9=157.  Adding the one all‐R coloring from s=0 yields 158 good colorings.  Hence the probability is 158/256=79/128 and m+n=79+128=207.\n\nAnswer:207', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
