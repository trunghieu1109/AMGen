    <pre>Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?

Please think step by step and then solve the task.</pre>

    <pre>To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that a regular octagon, with vertices colored either red or blue, can be rotated such that all blue vertices match positions that were originally red. The octagon has 8 vertices, and each vertex is colored red or blue with equal probability, resulting in 2^8 possible colorings. We are interested in those colorings that have rotational symmetry where blue vertices can occupy positions originally red.

Firstly, consider the rotation group of the octagon, which includes 8 rotations: 0 degrees (identity), 45 degrees, 90 degrees, ..., 315 degrees. For a given coloring to have the desired rotational symmetry, it must be invariant under at least one non-identity rotation.

We use Burnside&#39;s Lemma to count the number of symmetric colorings. Burnside&#39;s Lemma states that the number of distinct objects under a group action is the average number of points fixed by each group element.

- For the identity rotation (0 degrees), all 2^8 colorings are unchanged.
- For 45 degrees, a coloring is unchanged if all vertices are the same color, which gives 2 colorings (all red or all blue).
- For 90 degrees, pairs of opposite vertices must be the same color. There are 2^4 = 16 such colorings.
- For 135 degrees, similar to 45 degrees, all vertices must be the same color, giving 2 colorings.
- For 180 degrees, opposite vertices must be the same color, giving 2^4 = 16 colorings.
- For 225 degrees, similar to 45 degrees, all vertices must be the same color, giving 2 colorings.
- For 270 degrees, opposite pairs must be the same color, giving 2^4 = 16 colorings.
- For 315 degrees, similar to 45 degrees, all vertices must be the same color, giving 2 colorings.

Calculating the average number of fixed colorings:
(256 + 2 + 16 + 2 + 16 + 2 + 16 + 2) / 8 = 39.

Thus, there are 39 symmetric colorings. The probability that a random coloring is symmetric is 39/256.

To find m and n, we simplify 39/256. Since 39 and 256 have no common factors other than 1, they are already in simplest form. Thus, m = 39 and n = 256, giving m + n = 295.
