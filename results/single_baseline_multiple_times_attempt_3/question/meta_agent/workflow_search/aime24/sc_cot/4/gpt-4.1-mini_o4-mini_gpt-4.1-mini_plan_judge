Question: Let $p$ be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $n^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$. Find the least positive integer $m$ such that $m^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$.

proposed answer: We seek the smallest prime p for which there exists a positive n with p^2 dividing n^4+1. Check small p:
- p=2: n^4+1 mod4 is 1 or 2, never 0 mod4. Fail.
- p=3: n^4 mod9 ∈{0,1,4,7} ⇒n^4+1∈{1,2,5,8}, never 0 mod9. Fail.
- p=5: Units mod25 form cyclic group of order20. Equation x^4≡–1≡24 mod25 has no solution since discrete log10 not divisible by gcd(4,20)=4. Fail.
- p=7,11,13: check n^4≡–1 mod p has no solution by testing n^4 mod p. Fail.
- p=17: mod17 we have solutions to n^4≡–1 (e.g. n≡2,8,9,15). Use Hensel’s lemma to lift each to mod289: n=2+17k ⇒k=9 ⇒n≡155; similarly lifts from 8,9,15 yield n≡110,179,134. The smallest positive is m=110. Thus p=17 and the least m is 110.
