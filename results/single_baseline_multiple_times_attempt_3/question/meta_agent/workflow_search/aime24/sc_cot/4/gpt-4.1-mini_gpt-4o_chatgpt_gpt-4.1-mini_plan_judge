proposed answer: To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest prime number $p$ such that there is a positive integer $n$ with $p^2 \mid n^4 + 1$. First, consider the congruence $n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{p^2}$. If $p^2 \mid n^4 + 1$, then $n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{p^2}$. This implies $n^8 \equiv 1 \pmod{p^2}$. The order of $n$ modulo $p^2$ divides 8. We check small primes to see if such an $n$ exists. 

For $p = 2$, $n^4 + 1 \equiv n^4 + 1 \pmod{4}$ does not work as $n^4 \equiv 0, 1 \pmod{4}$, so $n^4 + 1 \equiv 1, 2 \pmod{4}$.

For $p = 3$, we have $n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{9}$. Check $n^4 \equiv -1 \equiv 8 \pmod{9}$. If $n^4 \equiv 8 \pmod{9}$, then $n^8 \equiv 1 \pmod{9}$. Check $n = 2$: $2^4 = 16 \equiv 7 \pmod{9}$, not 8. So, $n = 3$: $3^4 = 81 \equiv 0 \pmod{9}$ is not $-1$. No solution for $p=3$.

For $p = 5$, we have $n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{25}$. Check $n^4 \equiv -1 \equiv 24 \pmod{25}$. Try $n = 1$: $1^4 + 1 = 2 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{25}$. Try $n = 2$: $2^4 + 1 = 17 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{25}$. Try $n = 3$: $3^4 + 1 = 82 \equiv 7 \pmod{25}$.

Try $n = 4$: $4^4 + 1 = 257 \equiv 7 \pmod{25}$. Try $n = 5$: $5^4 + 1 = 626 \equiv 1 \pmod{25}$. Try $n = 6$: $6^4 + 1 = 1297 \equiv 23 \pmod{25}$. Try $n = 7$: $7^4 + 1 = 2402 \equiv 2 \pmod{25}$. Try $n = 8$: $8^4 + 1 = 4097 \equiv 17 \pmod{25}$. Try $n = 9$: $9^4 + 1 = 6562 \equiv 7 \pmod{25}$. Try $n = 10$: $10^4 + 1 = 10001 \equiv 2 \pmod{25}$. Try $n = 11$: $11^4 + 1 = 14642 \equiv 7 \pmod{25}$. Try $n = 12$: $12^4 + 1 = 20737 \equiv 17 \pmod{25}$. Try $n = 13$: $13^4 + 1 = 28562 \equiv 2 \pmod{25}$. Try $n = 14$: $14^4 + 1 = 38417 \equiv 7 \pmod{25}$. Try $n = 15$: $15^4 + 1 = 50626 \equiv 1 \pmod{25}$. Try $n = 16$: $16^4 + 1 = 65537 \equiv 0 \pmod{25}$. So $n = 16$ works for $p = 5$.

Thus, the least prime $p$ is 5, and the least positive integer $m$ such that $m^4 + 1$ is divisible by $5^2$ is $m = 16$.
