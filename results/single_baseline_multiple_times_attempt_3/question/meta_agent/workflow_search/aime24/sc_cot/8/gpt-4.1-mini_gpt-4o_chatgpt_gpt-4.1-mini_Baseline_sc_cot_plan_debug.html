    <pre>Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice&#39;s play.

Please think step by step and then solve the task.</pre>

    <pre>To determine the winning and losing positions in this game, we consider the possible moves and outcomes. A position with n tokens is a losing position if every move leaves the opponent in a winning position. Conversely, a position is a winning position if there exists at least one move that leaves the opponent in a losing position.

1. Base cases: If n = 0, Bob wins (since Alice cannot make a move), so n = 0 is a losing position.
2. If n = 1, Alice can remove 1 token and win, so n = 1 is a winning position.
3. If n = 2, Alice can remove 1 token, leaving 1 token (a winning position for Alice), so n = 2 is a losing position.
4. If n = 3, Alice can remove 1 token, leaving 2 tokens (a losing position for Bob), so n = 3 is a winning position.
5. If n = 4, Alice can remove 4 tokens and win, so n = 4 is a winning position.
6. If n = 5, Alice can remove 4 tokens, leaving 1 token (a winning position for Alice), or remove 1 token, leaving 4 tokens (a winning position for Alice), so n = 5 is a losing position.

Observing the pattern:
- Losing positions (L) occur at n = 0, 2, 5.
- Winning positions (W) occur at n = 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Continuing this pattern, we observe that losing positions occur at n = 0, 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, ..., i.e., positions of the form n = 3k + 2 for non-negative integers k.

We need to find all such n &lt;= 2024.
- The sequence of losing positions is 2, 5, 8, 11, ..., up to 2024.
- This is an arithmetic sequence with the first term a_1 = 2 and common difference d = 3.

The general form of the nth term of this sequence is given by a_n = 3n + 2.

To find the largest n such that a_n &lt;= 2024, we solve:
3n + 2 &lt;= 2024
3n &lt;= 2022
n &lt;= 674.

Thus, there are 675 values of n (from n = 0 to n = 674) for which a_n = 3n + 2 is less than or equal to 2024.

Therefore, there are 675 positive integers n &lt;= 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy.
