Question: Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: We need to find for how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 Bob has a winning strategy. Alice goes first, and on each turn, a player can remove 1 or 4 tokens. The player who removes the last token wins. Bob wins if and only if the initial position is a losing position for Alice (the first player). We analyze the game using the concept of winning and losing positions in combinatorial game theory. Define a position as losing if the player to move has no winning strategy, and winning if the player to move can force a win.

Let's denote P(n) as the position with n tokens and it is the first player's turn.

- Base case: P(0) is losing (no tokens to remove, so the player to move loses).

For n > 0, P(n) is winning if there exists a move removing 1 or 4 tokens to a losing position.

Check positions:
- P(0): losing
- P(1): can remove 1 to get P(0) losing → P(1) winning
- P(2): can remove 1 to get P(1) winning, remove 4 not possible → no move to losing → P(2) losing
- P(3): remove 1 → P(2) losing → P(3) winning
- P(4): remove 1 → P(3) winning, remove 4 → P(0) losing → P(4) winning
- P(5): remove 1 → P(4) winning, remove 4 → P(1) winning → no move to losing → P(5) losing

So far:
P(0): L
P(1): W
P(2): L
P(3): W
P(4): W
P(5): L

Continue a bit more:
P(6): remove 1 → P(5) L → W
P(7): remove 1 → P(6) W, remove 4 → P(3) W → no losing move → L
P(8): remove 1 → P(7) L → W
P(9): remove 1 → P(8) W, remove 4 → P(5) L → W

Pattern of losing positions found: 0, 2, 5, 7
Check if this pattern repeats:

Check P(10): remove 1 → P(9) W, remove 4 → P(6) W → no losing move → L?
No, both next positions are winning, so P(10) is losing.

Positions losing: 0, 2, 5, 7, 10

Check differences:
2-0=2
5-2=3
7-5=2
10-7=3

Pattern of losing positions seems to be repeating every 5 tokens with losing positions at n mod 5 = 0 or 2.

Check more:
P(12): remove 1 → P(11), remove 4 → P(8)
Check P(11): remove 1 → P(10) L → W
So P(11) is W
P(8) is W
So P(12): no losing move → L
12 mod 5 = 2

Thus, losing positions are those where n mod 5 == 0 or 2.

Since Alice starts, Bob wins if and only if the initial position is losing for Alice, i.e., n mod 5 == 0 or 2.

Count number of positive integers ≤ 2024 where n mod 5 == 0 or 2.

Number of n ≤ 2024 with n mod 5 == 0:
These are multiples of 5: 5, 10, ..., 2020
Number of multiples of 5 up to 2024 = floor(2024 / 5) = 404

Number of n ≤ 2024 with n mod 5 == 2:
Numbers of form 5k + 2 ≤ 2024
5k + 2 ≤ 2024 → 5k ≤ 2022 → k ≤ 404.4
So k max = 404
Number of such numbers = 405 (k from 0 to 404)

Total = 404 + 405 = 809
