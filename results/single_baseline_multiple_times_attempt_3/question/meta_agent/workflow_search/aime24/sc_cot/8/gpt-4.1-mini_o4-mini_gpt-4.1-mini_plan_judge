Question: Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: We have an impartial game: remove 1 or 4 tokens, last move wins. The losing (P) positions satisfy that all moves (to n-1 and n-4 if available) go to winning positions. Computing small positions reveals the losing positions occur exactly when n≡0 or 2 mod5. For n≤2024, the count of n≡0 mod5 is floor(2024/5)=404; the count of n≡2 mod5 is 405 (n=2,7,…,2022). Total =404+405=809.
