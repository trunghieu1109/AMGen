    <pre>Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.

Please think step by step and then solve the task.</pre>

    <pre>We need to find the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box with given surface area and volume. The surface area of a box with dimensions x, y, z is 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54, and the volume is xyz = 23. The diagonal of the box, which is the diameter of the smallest containing sphere, is sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2). We need to minimize this diagonal. We express x^2 + y^2 + z^2 in terms of the given constraints. We use the identity (x + y + z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + zx). Let s = x + y + z, then x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = s^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx). We have xy + yz + zx = 27 from the surface area condition, so x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = s^2 - 54. Also, from the AM-GM inequality, (x + y + z)/3 &gt;= (xyz)^(1/3) = (23)^(1/3), so x + y + z &gt;= 3(23)^(1/3). We find the minimum of s^2 - 54 subject to this constraint. By symmetry and the problem&#39;s nature, the minimum occurs when x, y, and z are close to each other. By trial and error or solving the system, we find that x = 3, y = 3, z = 23/9 satisfies the conditions and gives the smallest diagonal. This gives x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (3^2 + 3^2 + (23/9)^2) = 18 + 529/81 = 1945/81. Therefore, the minimum value of the square of the radius, which is (1/4) of the square of the diagonal, is 1945/324.
