Question: Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.

proposed answer: We need the smallest sphere that can contain every rectangular box with surface area 54 and volume 23. A box with sides a,b,c has diagonal d=√(a²+b²+c²), so the needed sphere radius r is at least max(d/2) over all boxes satisfying 2(ab+bc+ca)=54 and abc=23. Equivalently ab+bc+ca=27 and abc=23. By symmetry and Lagrange multipliers, the maximum of d occurs when two sides are equal, say b=c=x and a=y. Then constraints give 2xy+x²=27 and x²y=23. Solving leads to two positive solutions: x=2,y=23/4 and x=2√6−1,y=23/(x²). Computing S=a²+b²+c²=y²+2x² shows the larger value is S=(23/4)²+2·2²=41.0625=657/16. Hence max diagonal d_max=√(657/16)=√657/4, so r=d_max/2=√657/8 and r²=657/64. Thus p+q=657+64=721.
