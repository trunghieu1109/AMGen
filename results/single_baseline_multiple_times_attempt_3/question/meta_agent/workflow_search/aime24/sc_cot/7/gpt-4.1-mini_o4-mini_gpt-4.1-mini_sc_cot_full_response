Question: There exist real numbers $x$ and $y$, both greater than 1, such that $\log_x\left(y^x\right)=\log_y\left(x^{4y}\right)=10$. Find $xy$.\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent LtVF', content='We have log_x(y^x)=10 ⇒ x⋅log_x(y)=10 ⇒ log_x(y)=10/x ⇒ y=x^{10/x}. Also log_y(x^{4y})=10 ⇒4y⋅log_y(x)=10 ⇒log_y(x)=5/(2y) ⇒x=y^{5/(2y)}. Taking natural logs: A=ln x>0, B=ln y>0. Then B=10A e^{−A}, A=(5B/2)e^{−B}. Substituting B yields equation A(1+10e^{−A})=2ln5. Numerically solve this gives A≈0.42826 ⇒x=e^A≈1.534, B≈2.791⇒y≈16.308. Hence xy≈25.016≈25.\n\n\nAnswer:25', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
