Question: Let $\triangle ABC$ have circumcenter $O$ and incenter $I$ with $\overline{IA}\perp\overline{OI}$, circumradius $13$, and inradius $6$. Find $AB\cdot AC$.
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: We are given a triangle ABC with circumradius R = 13 and inradius r = 6. The condition \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \) implies that \( A \) is the excenter opposite the vertex \( A \). This means that \( A \) is the midpoint of the arc \( BC \) that does not contain \( A \) on the circumcircle. In this scenario, the formula \( R^2 - 2Rr = AB \cdot AC \) can be used to find the product of the sides \( AB \cdot AC \).
