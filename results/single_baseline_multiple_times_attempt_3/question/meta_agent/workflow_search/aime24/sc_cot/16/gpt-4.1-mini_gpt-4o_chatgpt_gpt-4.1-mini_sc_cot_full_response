Question: Let $\triangle ABC$ have circumcenter $O$ and incenter $I$ with $\overline{IA}\perp\overline{OI}$, circumradius $13$, and inradius $6$. Find $AB\cdot AC$.\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent OaWE', content='We are given a triangle ABC with circumradius R = 13 and inradius r = 6. The condition \\( \\overline{IA} \\perp \\overline{OI} \\) implies that \\( A \\) is the excenter opposite the vertex \\( A \\). This means that \\( A \\) is the midpoint of the arc \\( BC \\) that does not contain \\( A \\) on the circumcircle. In this scenario, the formula \\( R^2 - 2Rr = AB \\cdot AC \\) can be used to find the product of the sides \\( AB \\cdot AC \\).\n\nAnswer:221', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
