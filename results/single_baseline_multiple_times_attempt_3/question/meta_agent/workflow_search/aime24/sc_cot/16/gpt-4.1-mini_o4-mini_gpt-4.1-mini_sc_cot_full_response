Question: Let $\triangle ABC$ have circumcenter $O$ and incenter $I$ with $\overline{IA}\perp\overline{OI}$, circumradius $13$, and inradius $6$. Find $AB\cdot AC$.\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent KURH', content='We know R=13, r=6. Euler’s theorem gives OI^2=R^2−2Rr=169−156=13, so OI=√13. IA⊥OI implies triangle OIA is right at I, so IA^2+OI^2=OA^2 ⇒ IA=√(169−13)=√156=2√39. In any triangle IA = r/sin(A/2), so sin(A/2)=r/IA=6/(2√39)=3/√39. Using standard inradius formula r=4R sin(A/2)sin(B/2)sin(C/2), we solve for sin(B/2)sin(C/2), then compute sinB·sinC, and finally AB·AC =4R^2 sinB sinC =468.\n\nAnswer:468', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
