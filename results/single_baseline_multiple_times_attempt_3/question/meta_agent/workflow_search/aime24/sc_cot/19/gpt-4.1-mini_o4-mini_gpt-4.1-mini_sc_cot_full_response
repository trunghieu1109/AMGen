Question: Let $\omega\neq 1$ be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\]
is divided by 1000.\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 1k5n', content='We need P = ∏_{k=0}^{12}(2-2ω^k+ω^{2k}).  Note ω^k runs over all 13th roots of unity, including 1.  Let f(x)=x^2−2x+2=(x−α)(x−β) with α,β=1±i.  Then P=∏_{r: r^{13}=1}f(r)=∏(r−α)·∏(r−β).  But ∏_{r}(α−r)=α^{13}−1, and ∏(r−α)= (−1)^{13}(α^{13}−1)=1−α^{13}.  Hence P=(1−α^{13})(1−β^{13}).\nCompute α=1+i ⇒ α^{13}=(√2)^{13}e^{i13π/4}=2^{6.5}·(−(1+i)/√2)=−64(1+i).  Thus 1−α^{13}=1+64(1+i)=65+64i, and similarly 1−β^{13}=65−64i.  So P=(65+64i)(65−64i)=65^2+64^2=4225+4096=8321.  Finally 8321 mod 1000=321.\n\nAnswer:321', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
