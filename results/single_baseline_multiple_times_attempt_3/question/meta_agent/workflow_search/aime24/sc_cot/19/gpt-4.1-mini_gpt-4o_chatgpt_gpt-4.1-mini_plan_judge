proposed answer: To solve this problem, we need to evaluate the product \( P = \prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) \) where \( \omega \) is a primitive 13th root of unity. Since \( \omega^{13} = 1 \) and \( \omega \neq 1 \), the roots of unity satisfy \( \omega^k \neq 1 \) for \( k = 1, 2, \ldots, 12 \). We can simplify the expression inside the product: \( 2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k} = 2(1 - \omega^k) + \omega^{2k} \). We note that \( \omega^{2k} = (\omega^k)^2 \), so we can rewrite it as \( (1 - \omega^k)^2 + 1 \). The product \( P \) can be rewritten in terms of the polynomial whose roots are the 13th roots of unity. The polynomial is \( x^{13} - 1 = (x-1)(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1) \). The expression \( 2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k} \) simplifies further by recognizing symmetries and properties of roots of unity. We evaluate at specific points and use properties of cyclotomic polynomials. Finally, the product of all terms can be shown to be an integer, and we find the remainder when this integer is divided by 1000.
