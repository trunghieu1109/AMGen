Question: Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.

proposed answer: To find the number of paths on an 8x8 grid that change direction exactly four times, we need to consider paths composed of horizontal (H) and vertical (V) moves. A path from the lower left to the upper right corner consists of 8 H moves and 8 V moves, totaling 16 moves. A change in direction occurs when a horizontal move is followed by a vertical move or vice versa. To have exactly four changes in direction, the path must have five segments of consecutive H's or V's. For example, a path could be structured as HHH...VVV...HHH...VVV...HHH... (and vice versa), where each segment consists of consecutive moves in one direction. The sequence of segments such as (H, V, H, V, H) ensures four changes in direction. We need to determine the number of ways to partition the 8 H's and 8 V's into five segments, ensuring that each segment has at least one move. This is a combinatorial problem involving distributing 8 items into 3 groups (since the first segment is determined by the choice of starting with H or V). Using the stars and bars method, we calculate the number of solutions for each configuration.
