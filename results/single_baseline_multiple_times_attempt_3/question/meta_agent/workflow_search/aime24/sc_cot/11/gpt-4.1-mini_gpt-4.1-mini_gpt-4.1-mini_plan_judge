Question: Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.

proposed answer: We are considering paths on an 8x8 grid from the lower left corner to the upper right corner. Such a path consists of exactly 16 steps: 8 steps right (R) and 8 steps up (U). The problem asks for the number of such paths that change direction exactly 4 times. A direction change means switching from moving right to moving up, or vice versa.

Since the path has 16 steps and 4 direction changes, the path consists of 5 segments (because the number of segments = number of direction changes + 1).

Each segment consists of steps all in the same direction (either all R or all U). Since the path starts at the lower left corner and ends at the upper right corner, and must have 8 R steps and 8 U steps total, the segments must alternate directions starting with either R or U.

We need to consider two cases:
1. The path starts with R. Then the segments alternate: R, U, R, U, R (5 segments).
2. The path starts with U. Then the segments alternate: U, R, U, R, U (5 segments).

Let the lengths of the segments be x1, x2, x3, x4, x5.

Case 1 (start with R):
x1 + x3 + x5 = 8 (total R steps)
x2 + x4 = 8 (total U steps)
All xi >= 1 because each segment must have at least one step to have a direction change.

Case 2 (start with U):
x1 + x3 + x5 = 8 (total U steps)
x2 + x4 = 8 (total R steps)
All xi >= 1.

We count the number of positive integer solutions for each case.

For case 1:
Number of positive integer solutions to x1 + x3 + x5 = 8 is C(8-1, 3-1) = C(7,2) = 21.
Number of positive integer solutions to x2 + x4 = 8 is C(8-1, 2-1) = C(7,1) = 7.
Total for case 1 = 21 * 7 = 147.

For case 2 (symmetric):
Number of positive integer solutions to x1 + x3 + x5 = 8 is 21.
Number of positive integer solutions to x2 + x4 = 8 is 7.
Total for case 2 = 21 * 7 = 147.

Total number of paths with exactly 4 direction changes = 147 + 147 = 294.
