Question: Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.
[asy] size(10cm); usepackage("tikz");label("\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(2,0)--(2,3)--(5,3)--(5,8)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}",origin); label("\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(0,3)--(3,3)--(3,5)--(8,5)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}",E); [/asy]

proposed answer: We need the number of lattice paths from (0,0) to (8,8) using 8 rights (R) and 8 ups (U) with exactly 4 direction changes. A path with 4 changes has 5 runs of consecutive identical moves, alternating between R and U. Case 1: start with R ⇒ runs: R,V,R,V,R (3 R-runs summing to 8, 2 V-runs summing to 8). Number of positive compositions: C(8−1,3−1)=C(7,2)=21 for R-runs and C(7,2−1)=C(7,1)=7 for V-runs ⇒ 21×7=147. Case 2: start with U ⇒ similarly 147. Total =147+147=294.
