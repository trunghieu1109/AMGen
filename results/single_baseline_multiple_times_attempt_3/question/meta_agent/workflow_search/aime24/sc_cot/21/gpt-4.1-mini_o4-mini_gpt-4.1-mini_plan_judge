Question: Find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon ($12$-gon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The diagram below shows three of those rectangles.

proposed answer: We want the number of rectangles whose vertices are among the 12 equally spaced vertices of a regular 12‐gon. A rectangle inscribed in a circle has both its diagonals as diameters of that circle, and conversely any two distinct diameters of the circle determine a rectangle (a parallelogram with equal diagonals). In the 12‐gon there are 12 vertices, giving 6 diametrically opposite pairs (6 diameters). Choosing any 2 of these 6 diameters yields exactly one rectangle. Hence the total number of rectangles is C(6,2)=15.
