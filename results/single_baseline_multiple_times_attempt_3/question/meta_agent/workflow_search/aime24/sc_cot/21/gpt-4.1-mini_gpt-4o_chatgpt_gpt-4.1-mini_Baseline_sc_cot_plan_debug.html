    <pre>To find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon, we need to consider the vertices of the dodecagon. A regular dodecagon has 12 vertices. A rectangle is defined by choosing two pairs of parallel sides. In a regular dodecagon, each pair of opposite sides (or diagonals) can be used to form a rectangle. 

First, we label the vertices of the dodecagon as 1, 2, 3, ..., 12. We need to choose two pairs of opposite sides. 

For each pair of opposite sides, the diagonals can be labeled by skipping some vertices. For example, the diagonal from vertex 1 to vertex 7 is opposite to the diagonal from vertex 4 to vertex 10. 

To form a rectangle, we need to choose two such diagonals. The diagonals can be categorized by the number of vertices they skip. 

We can skip 5 vertices to form a diagonal between opposite vertices, such as 1 to 7. Similarly, other diagonals can be formed by skipping 4, 3, or 2 vertices. 

For each pair of diagonals, there are 6 ways to choose the first diagonal (since each diagonal is opposite to another one), and for each choice, there are 3 ways to choose the second diagonal (since the diagonals are symmetric and we must choose another pair of opposite vertices). 

Therefore, the total number of rectangles is the combination of choosing 2 pairs of opposite sides from the 6 available pairs. This is given by the combination formula C(6, 2).
