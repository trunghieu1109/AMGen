    <pre>We have a regular dodecagon (12-gon) with vertices equally spaced on a circle. We want to find rectangles formed such that each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The key insight is that rectangles inscribed in a regular polygon must have their sides parallel to pairs of parallel lines determined by the polygon&#39;s vertices. Since the polygon is regular with 12 vertices, its vertices lie on a circle, and the polygon has 6 pairs of parallel sides (because 12 sides mean 6 directions of edges, each with a parallel opposite edge).

Step 1: Identify directions of edges
The 12-gon has edges at angles 0°, 30°, 60°, ..., 330°. Opposite edges are 180° apart, so edges at 0° and 180° are parallel, 30° and 210°, 60° and 240°, 90° and 270°, 120° and 300°, 150° and 330°.

So there are 6 directions of edges, each with a parallel opposite edge.

Step 2: Rectangles must have sides parallel to two perpendicular directions
Since rectangles have sides perpendicular, the rectangle&#39;s sides must be parallel to two directions that are perpendicular.

Among the 6 directions, the directions are spaced every 30°, so perpendicular directions differ by 90°.

Check which pairs of directions are perpendicular:
- 0° and 90°
- 30° and 120°
- 60° and 150°
- 90° and 180° (180° is same as 0°, so 90° and 180° correspond to 90° and 0°, which is same as 0° and 90°)
- 120° and 210° (210° is 30° + 180°, so 120° and 210° differ by 90°)
- 150° and 240° (240° is 60° + 180°, so 150° and 240° differ by 90°)

Distinct perpendicular pairs of directions (mod 180°) are:
- (0°, 90°)
- (30°, 120°)
- (60°, 150°)

Step 3: For each pair of perpendicular directions, count rectangles formed by choosing two parallel lines in each direction
The polygon has 12 vertices. The edges are between consecutive vertices.

Each direction corresponds to 2 edges (since edges come in pairs), and each vertex lies on lines in these directions.

But the problem states that sides of rectangles lie on either sides or diagonals of the polygon.

Since the polygon is regular, the diagonals are lines connecting pairs of vertices.

The polygon has 12 vertices, so the total number of lines determined by pairs of vertices is C(12,2) = 66 lines.

Among these 66 lines, the ones parallel to a given direction correspond to sets of lines parallel to that direction.

For each direction, the set of lines parallel to it are those connecting vertices that lie on that direction.

Because the polygon is regular, the lines parallel to a given direction are formed by connecting vertices whose indices differ by a fixed number modulo 12.

Step 4: Identify the number of lines parallel to each direction
The directions correspond to the edges and the diagonals of the polygon.

For direction 0°, edges connect vertices (0,1), (1,2),..., (11,0).

Lines parallel to 0° are those connecting vertices whose indices differ by 1 modulo 12 (edges), 5, 7, or 11 (diagonals) that lie parallel to 0°.

More generally, the direction of a line connecting vertices i and j is determined by (j - i) modulo 12.

The direction of the edge from vertex i to i+1 mod 12 is 0°.

Similarly, the direction of line connecting vertices i and i+k mod 12 corresponds to direction k * 30° mod 360°.

So lines parallel to direction k * 30° are those connecting vertices differing by k modulo 12.

Therefore, for each k in 1 to 6 (since difference k and 12-k correspond to same lines but opposite direction), the lines connecting vertices differing by k modulo 12 are parallel and distinct.

Number of such lines for difference k is 12 (since for each vertex i, line (i, i+k) counts, but each line is counted twice when considering i and i+k, so total unique lines with difference k is 12/2=6).

So for each difference k, there are 6 unique lines parallel to direction k*30°.

Step 5: For rectangles, choose two distinct lines from one direction and two distinct lines from the perpendicular direction
Since rectangles are formed by two pairs of parallel lines perpendicular to each other, and each pair has 6 lines, the number of rectangles formed by direction k and its perpendicular direction is C(6,2) * C(6,2) = 15 * 15 = 225.

Step 6: We have 3 pairs of perpendicular directions (from step 2): (1,3), (2,4), (3,5) in terms of difference k (mod 12)

Specifically:
- direction k=1 (0°) and k=3 (90°)
- direction k=2 (30°) and k=4 (120°)
- direction k=3 (60°) and k=5 (150°)

For each pair, number of rectangles = 225.

Step 7: Total rectangles = 3 * 225 = 675.

Therefore, the total number of rectangles formed inside the regular dodecagon with sides on sides or diagonals is 675.
