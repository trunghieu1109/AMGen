Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: We orient the torus so its axis is vertical, translate it along the vertical so it is tangent to the sphere along a horizontal circle of radius s.  Writing cylindrical coordinates (r,z), the torus is ((r–6)^2+(z–h)^2=9) and the sphere is (r^2+z^2=121).  Tangency requires these two curves meet and also have parallel normals, which gives an extra equation (z–h)/z=(r–6)/r.  Eliminating z and solving yields a quartic in h^2 with roots h^2=28 or 160, and the corresponding circle‐radii are s=33/4 and s=231/49 respectively.  Their difference is 33/4–231/49=(693/196)=99/28, so m+n=99+28=127.
