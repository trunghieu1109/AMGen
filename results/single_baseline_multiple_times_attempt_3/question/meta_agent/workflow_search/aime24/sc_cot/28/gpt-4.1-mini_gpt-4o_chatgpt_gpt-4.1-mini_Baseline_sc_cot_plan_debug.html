    <pre>Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

Please think step by step and then solve the task.</pre>

    <pre>To solve this problem, we need to find the radii of the circles along which the torus is tangent to the sphere, both when the torus is inside the sphere and when it is outside the sphere. The torus is defined by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis 6 units away from its center, which means the torus has a major radius (distance from the center of the torus to the center of the tube) of 6 and a minor radius (radius of the tube) of 3. The sphere has a radius of 11.

1. When the torus is inside the sphere and tangent, the center of the torus is at the origin, and the sphere is centered at the origin. The distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the tube of the torus is 6 units, and the tube has a radius of 3. The sphere has a radius of 11, so the distance from the center of the sphere to the tangent circle is 11 - 3 = 8 units. Thus, the radius of the tangent circle when the torus is inside is 8 - 6 = 2.

2. When the torus is outside the sphere and tangent, the center of the torus is at the origin, and the sphere is centered at the origin. The distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the tube of the torus is 6 units, and the tube has a radius of 3. The sphere has a radius of 11, so the distance from the center of the sphere to the tangent circle is 11 + 3 = 14 units. Thus, the radius of the tangent circle when the torus is outside is 14 - 6 = 8.

3. The difference between the radii of the tangent circles is 2 - 8 = -6. However, the problem asks for the difference r_i - r_o, where r_i is the radius when the torus is inside and r_o is when the torus is outside. Therefore, r_i - r_o = 2 - 8 = -6.

4. The difference can be written as -6 = -\frac{6}{1}, where m = -6 and n = 1. The problem specifies that m and n should be positive, so we take the absolute values: m = 6 and n = 1.

5. Therefore, m + n = 6 + 1 = 7.
