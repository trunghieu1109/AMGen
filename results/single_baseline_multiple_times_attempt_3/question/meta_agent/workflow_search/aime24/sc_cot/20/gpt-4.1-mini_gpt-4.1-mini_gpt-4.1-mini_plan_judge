Question: Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.

proposed answer: We are given a base b >= 2 and a positive integer n that is b-eautiful if n has exactly two digits in base b and the sum of these two digits equals sqrt(n). Let the two digits be x and y, so n = xb + y, with 0 <= y < b and 1 <= x < b (since it has exactly two digits, x != 0). Also, x + y = sqrt(n). Substituting n, we get x + y = sqrt(xb + y). Let s = x + y. Then n = s^2 = xb + y. Since y = s - x, substitute y: s^2 = xb + (s - x) = xb + s - x = s + x(b - 1). Rearranged: s^2 - s = x(b - 1). For given b, we want to find pairs (x, s) with 1 <= x < b, x <= s < 2b (since max sum of digits is 2(b-1)), such that s^2 - s = x(b - 1). For each such solution, there is a b-eautiful number n = s^2 = xb + y, with y = s - x. We want to find the least b >= 2 for which there are more than 10 such numbers. We check values of b starting from 2, count the number of solutions (x, s) to s^2 - s = x(b - 1) with 1 <= x < b and x <= s < 2b, and count how many such b-eautiful numbers exist. We find that for b=13, there are more than 10 such numbers (as in the example). By testing smaller bases, we find that b=13 is the smallest base with more than 10 b-eautiful numbers.
