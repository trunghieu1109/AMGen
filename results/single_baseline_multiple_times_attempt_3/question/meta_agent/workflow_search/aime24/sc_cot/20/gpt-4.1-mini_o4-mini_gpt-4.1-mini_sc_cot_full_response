Question: Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent ueCM', content='We seek positive integers n with two digits in base b (so n=A b+B with 1≤A≤b−1, 0≤B≤b−1) and A+B=√n.  Set s=A+B so n=s² and A b+B=s² ⇒ A(b−1)=s(s−1).  Writing d=b−1, we need s(s−1) divisible by d and A=s(s−1)/d≤d, B=s−A≥0.  The number of solutions s∈[2…d] with s(s−1)≡0 mod d equals 2^{ω(d)}−1, where ω(d) is the number of distinct prime factors of d.  We require 2^{ω(d)}−1>10 ⇒ 2^{ω(d)}>11 ⇒ ω(d)≥4.  The smallest integer with four distinct prime factors is d=2⋅3⋅5⋅7=210, giving b=d+1=211, and that yields 2^4−1=15>10 beautiful numbers.  No smaller b has ω(b−1)≥4, so 211 is minimal.\n\nAnswer:211', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
