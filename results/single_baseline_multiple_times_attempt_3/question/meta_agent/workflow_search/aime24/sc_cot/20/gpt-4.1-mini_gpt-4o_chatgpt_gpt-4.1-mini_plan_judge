Question: Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.

proposed answer: To find the smallest integer b >= 2 for which there are more than ten b-beautiful integers, we start by understanding the conditions for a number n to be b-beautiful. A b-beautiful integer n has exactly two digits in base b, meaning it can be expressed as n = ab + c, where 0 <= a < b and 0 <= c < b. Additionally, the sum of the digits a and c must equal the square root of n, so a + c = sqrt(n). For n to have exactly two digits in base b, we have b <= n < b^2. Let's express n in terms of a and c: n = ab + c, and since a + c = sqrt(n), we have n = (a + c)^2. Thus, ab + c = (a + c)^2. We need to find the smallest b such that there are more than 10 solutions (a, c) satisfying these conditions. We will check values of b starting from b = 2 and increase until we find more than 10 solutions.
