Question: Let ABCDEF be a convex equilateral hexagon in which all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle whose sides are extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. Find the side length of the hexagon.\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent IIRa', content='We set up coordinates so the hexagon with side-length s and side‐vectors u,v,w (all of length s) has vertices A=0, B=u, C=u+v, D=u+v+w, E=v+w, F=w.  The three lines AB, CD, EF meet in a triangle whose side‐lengths L₁,L₂,L₃ turn out to be homogeneous linear combinations of s with coefficients depending only on the angles between u,v,w.  Equivalently one shows\n  L₁ : L₂ : L₃ = X : Y : Z\nwhere\n  X = 1 + \n    sin\u2009ε/sin\u2009(δ+ε)\n    + sin\u2009ε/sin\u2009δ,\n  Y = 1 + sin\u2009δ/sin\u2009ε + sin\u2009δ/sin\u2009(δ+ε),\n  Z = 1 + sin\u2009(δ+ε)/sin\u2009δ + sin\u2009(δ+ε)/sin\u2009ε,\nwith δ = ∠(u,v), ε = ∠(v,w).  Matching X:Y:Z to 200:240:300 and enforcing δ+ε<π one finds numerically that the only solution gives s=160.\n\nAnswer:160', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
