    <pre>Given an equilateral hexagon ABCDEF where all pairs of opposite sides are parallel, the hexagon is known as an equilateral parallelogon. Since the hexagon is equilateral, all sides AB = BC = CD = DE = EF = FA = s (the side length). Also, opposite sides are parallel, so AB is parallel to DE, BC is parallel to EF, and CD is parallel to FA.

The problem states that the triangle formed by the extensions of sides AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. These three sides correspond to the triangle formed by the lines containing AB, CD, and EF.

Since AB, CD, and EF are three sides of the hexagon, and opposite sides are parallel, the directions of AB, CD, and EF are three distinct directions separated by 120 degrees (because the hexagon is equilateral and opposite sides are parallel, the directions form three pairs of parallel lines separated by 120 degrees).

The triangle formed by the intersection of lines containing AB, CD, and EF has side lengths equal to the distances between these lines. The side lengths of this triangle correspond to the distances between pairs of parallel lines (since each pair of lines AB and DE, CD and FA, EF and BC are parallel).

The distances between the pairs of parallel lines are proportional to the side length s. The triangle with sides 200, 240, and 300 corresponds to these distances, which relate to s and the sine of the angles between the directions.

Using the law of sines for the triangle with sides 200, 240, and 300, we can find the angles:
- Let the sides be a=200, b=240, c=300.
- Using the law of cosines, find the angles.

However, the key insight is that the side length s of the hexagon is related to these distances by a factor involving the sine of 60 degrees (since the directions are separated by 60 degrees in pairs).

The distances between opposite sides in an equilateral hexagon with side length s and 120-degree angles is s * sqrt(3).

Given the triangle sides 200, 240, 300 correspond to these distances, the side length s can be found by dividing the sides by sqrt(3).

Check if 200 / sqrt(3), 240 / sqrt(3), 300 / sqrt(3) are equal (they are not), so the distances correspond to the sides of the triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF.

Using the formula for the side length of the hexagon given the triangle sides, the side length s equals the area of the triangle divided by the semiperimeter.

Calculate the semiperimeter: (200 + 240 + 300)/2 = 370.
Calculate the area using Heron&#39;s formula:
Area = sqrt(370*(370-200)*(370-240)*(370-300)) = sqrt(370*170*130*70).
Calculate the area:
370*170=62900
62900*130=8177000
8177000*70=572390000
sqrt(572390000) ≈ 23937.3

The side length s = (2 * Area) / (sum of sides) = (2 * 23937.3) / 740 ≈ 47874.6 / 740 ≈ 64.7

Since the problem likely expects an integer, the side length s is approximately 65.
