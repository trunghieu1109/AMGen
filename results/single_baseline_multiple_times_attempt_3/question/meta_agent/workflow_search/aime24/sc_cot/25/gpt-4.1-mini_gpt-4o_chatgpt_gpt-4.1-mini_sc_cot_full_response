Question: Let ABCDEF be a convex equilateral hexagon in which all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle whose sides are extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. Find the side length of the hexagon.\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent b9Cx', content="The problem describes a special hexagon, where each pair of opposite sides is parallel and equal in length, making it an equilateral and equiangular hexagon. The triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. In such a hexagon, the triangle formed by the extensions of pairs of opposite sides has side lengths proportional to the hexagon's side length. By the triangle inequality and the given side lengths, we have a triangle with sides 200, 240, and 300. We can use the relationship between the sides of the triangle and the hexagon. The side lengths of the hexagon are proportional to the differences of the triangle's side lengths. Let's denote the side length of the hexagon as x. The side length x is proportional to the differences of the triangle's side lengths: 300 - 240 = 60, 300 - 200 = 100, and 240 - 200 = 40. The greatest common divisor of these differences is 20. Therefore, the side length of the hexagon is 20 times the GCD of these differences, which is 20.\n\nAnswer:20", prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
