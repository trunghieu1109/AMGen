Question: Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.

proposed answer: The tetrahedron is equifacial, meaning the distances from the point I to each face are equal. This condition implies that the tetrahedron is isosceles in a certain configuration. We need to find the volume of the tetrahedron and the area of one of its faces to determine the inradius. Using the given edge lengths, we can apply Heron's formula to find the area of one of the triangular faces. Then, we can use the formula for the volume of a tetrahedron given edge lengths. Finally, the inradius is the volume divided by the total surface area. We express this in the form \( \frac{m \sqrt{n}}{p} \) and find \( m+n+p \).
