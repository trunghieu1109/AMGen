Question: Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.

proposed answer: We have a tetrahedron with opposite edges equal: AB=CD=√41, AC=BD=√80, AD=BC=√89. Such a tetrahedron has an insphere.  Its inradius satisfies r=3V/S, where V is the volume and S the surface area.

1. Compute V via the Cayley–Menger formula or a specialized formula for tetrahedra with opposite edges equal.  Denote a=AB, b=AC, c=AD, with opposite edges a'=CD=a, b'=BD=b, c'=BC=c.  Write A=b²+c²–c'², B=c²+a²–b'², C=a²+b²–a'².  Here a²=41, b²=80, c²=89, and a'=a, b'=b, c'=c, so A=80+89–89=80, B=89+41–80=50, C=41+80–41=80.  Then the standard formula gives

 144 V² = 4a²b²c² – [a²A² + b²B² + c²C²] + ABC.

Compute a²b²c² = 41·80·89 = 291920, so 4a²b²c² = 1 167 680.  Next a²A² = 41·80² = 262400, b²B² = 80·50² = 200000, c²C² = 89·80² = 569600, sum = 1 032 000.  Finally ABC = 80·50·80 = 320000.  Hence
 144 V² = 1 167 680 – 1 032 000 + 320 000 = 455 680
so V² = 455 680/144 = 28 480/9, giving V = (8√445)/3.

2. All four faces are congruent triangles with side‐squared sums 41+80+89=210 and sum of squares 41²+80²+89²=16 002.  Heron’s‐formula variant yields each area = (1/4)√[210² – 2·16 002] = 6√21.  Thus S = 4·6√21 = 24√21.

3. Therefore r = 3V/S = (3·(8√445/3))/(24√21) = (8√445)/(24√21) = √445/(3√21) = √(445·21)/63 = √9345/63.  Here 9345=3·5·7·89 is squarefree, so m=1, n=9345, p=63.  Hence m+n+p = 1+9345+63 = 9409.
