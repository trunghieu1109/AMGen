Question: Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent Cx6T', content='We parametrize points A=(x1,y1) and B=(x2,y2) on the hyperbola x^2/20 - y^2/24 =1.  Opposite vertices are C=–A, D=–B so the diagonals AC and BD meet at the origin.  For ABCD to be a rhombus we need AB=BC, which simplifies to the dot‐product condition x1x2+y1y2=0.  Thus A⊥B in the plane.  Given B, an A⊥B will lie on the hyperbola iff 6y2^2 -5x2^2>0, which using 6x2^2 -5y2^2=120 (the hyperbola equation multiplied by 120) is equivalent to x2^2 ≥720/11.  Then BD^2=4(x2^2+y2^2).  From the hyperbola y2^2=(6/5)x2^2 -24, so BD^2=(44/5)x2^2 -96.  This is increasing in x2^2, so its infimum occurs at x2^2=720/11 giving BD^2→480.  Hence the greatest real less than all BD^2 is 480.\n\nAnswer:480', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
