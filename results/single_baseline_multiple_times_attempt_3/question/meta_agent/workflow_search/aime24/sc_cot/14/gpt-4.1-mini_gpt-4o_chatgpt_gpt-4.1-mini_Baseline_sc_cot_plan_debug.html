    <pre>The hyperbola is given by \( \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \). The diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin, which implies that the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. Let the coordinates of the points be \( A = (x_1, y_1) \), \( B = (x_2, y_2) \), \( C = (-x_1, -y_1) \), and \( D = (-x_2, -y_2) \). The condition for the rhombus is that \( AB = BC = CD = DA \). The diagonals \( AC \) and \( BD \) are perpendicular and intersect at the origin. The length of the diagonal \( BD \) is \( 2\sqrt{x_2^2 + y_2^2} \). We need to maximize \( BD^2 = 4(x_2^2 + y_2^2) \). The points \( B \) and \( D \) lie on the hyperbola, so \( \frac{x_2^2}{20} - \frac{y_2^2}{24} = 1 \). To maximize \( x_2^2 + y_2^2 \), we can use the constraint \( \frac{x_2^2}{20} - \frac{y_2^2}{24} = 1 \). We express \( y_2^2 \) in terms of \( x_2^2 \) as \( y_2^2 = \frac{24}{20}x_2^2 - 24 = \frac{6}{5}x_2^2 - 24 \). Substitute into \( x_2^2 + y_2^2 \) gives \( x_2^2 + \left( \frac{6}{5}x_2^2 - 24 \right) = \frac{11}{5}x_2^2 - 24 \). To maximize this, we differentiate with respect to \( x_2^2 \) and set the derivative to zero. This gives \( \frac{11}{5} - \frac{24}{x_2^2} = 0 \), leading to \( x_2^2 = \frac{120}{11} \). Substituting back, we find \( y_2^2 = \frac{6}{5} \cdot \frac{120}{11} - 24 = \frac{72}{11} - 24 = \frac{72}{11} - \frac{264}{11} = -\frac{192}{11} \), which is not possible since \( y_2^2 \) must be non-negative. Hence, the maximum occurs at the boundary where \( y_2^2 = 0 \), giving \( x_2^2 = 20 \) and \( BD^2 = 4 \cdot 20 = 80 \). Thus, the greatest real number less than \( BD^2 \) is 79.
