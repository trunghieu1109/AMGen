Question: Define $f(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{4}|$. Find the number of intersections of the graphs of \[y=4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \quad\text{ and }\quad x=4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))).\]

proposed answer: First, let's understand the functions involved. The function $f(x) = ||x| - \frac{1}{2}|$ is the absolute value of the absolute value of $x$ minus $\frac{1}{2}$. Similarly, $g(x) = ||x| - \frac{1}{4}|$. The composition $g(f(x))$ will involve applying $f$ first, then $g$. We have $y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x)))$ and $x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y)))$. We need to find the intersections of these graphs, which means solving $y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x)))$ and $x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y)))$ simultaneously. The functions $\sin(2 \pi x)$ and $\cos(3 \pi y)$ are periodic with periods 1 and $\frac{2}{3}$ respectively. The key is to analyze the behavior of $g(f(x))$ for $x$ between $-1$ and $1$ because $\sin(2 \pi x)$ and $\cos(3 \pi y)$ both range from $-1$ to $1$. We find the values of $g(f(x))$ for $x$ in this range, determine the scaling by 4, and then solve for intersections.
