Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: First, let's analyze the functions f and g. 

Given:
- f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|
- g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|

Both f and g take an input, take its absolute value, subtract a constant, then take the absolute value again.

Next, the equations given are:
- y = 4 * g(f(sin(2πx)))
- x = 4 * g(f(cos(3πy)))

We want to find the number of intersection points of these two graphs, i.e., the number of (x, y) pairs satisfying both.

Step 1: Understand the range of f and g.

For any real t, |t| ≥ 0.

- f(t) = ||t| - 1/2|
  Since |t| ≥ 0, |t| - 1/2 can be negative or positive.
  The minimum of f(t) is 0, achieved when |t| = 1/2.
  The maximum value of f(t) occurs at |t| = 0 or |t| = 1, etc.

- g(t) = ||t| - 1/4|
  Similarly, minimum 0 at |t| = 1/4.

Step 2: Analyze the inner functions.

We have sin(2πx) and cos(3πy), both oscillate between -1 and 1.

Step 3: Consider the range of f(sin(2πx))

Since sin(2πx) ∈ [-1, 1], |sin(2πx)| ∈ [0, 1].
Then f(sin(2πx)) = ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2| ∈ [0, 1/2].

Similarly for f(cos(3πy)).

Step 4: Apply g to f(sin(2πx))

Since f(sin(2πx)) ∈ [0, 1/2], then |f(sin(2πx))| ∈ [0, 1/2].

Then g(f(sin(2πx))) = ||f(sin(2πx))| - 1/4| = |f(sin(2πx)) - 1/4| since f(sin(2πx)) ≥ 0.

So g(f(sin(2πx))) ∈ [0, 1/4].

Step 5: The final y is y = 4 * g(f(sin(2πx))) ∈ [0, 1].
Similarly, x = 4 * g(f(cos(3πy))) ∈ [0, 1].

Therefore, the intersection points (x, y) lie in [0,1] × [0,1].

Step 6: Define h(t) = 4 * g(f(t)) for t in [-1, 1].

We want to analyze h(t) = 4 * g(f(t)) = 4 * |f(t) - 1/4| where f(t) = ||t| - 1/2|.

Let's rewrite f(t):
- f(t) = | |t| - 1/2 |.

For t in [0,1]:
- f(t) = |t - 1/2|.

Then g(f(t)) = |f(t) - 1/4| = ||t - 1/2| - 1/4|.

So h(t) = 4 * ||t - 1/2| - 1/4| for t in [0,1].

Step 7: Plot or analyze h(t) on [0,1].

Consider s(t) = |t - 1/2|.
Then h(t) = 4 * |s(t) - 1/4|.

Break into intervals:
- For t in [0,1], s(t) ranges from 0 to 1/2, with minimum at t=1/2.

When s(t) ≤ 1/4, h(t) = 4 * (1/4 - s(t))
When s(t) ≥ 1/4, h(t) = 4 * (s(t) - 1/4)

So h(t) is a 'V' shape with vertex at s(t) = 1/4.

Since s(t) = |t - 1/2|, s(t) = 1/4 means t = 1/4 or t = 3/4.

So h(t) has minimum 0 at t=1/4 and t=3/4.

At t=1/2, s(t) = 0 → h(1/2) = 4 * |0 - 1/4| = 4 * 1/4 = 1.

At t=0 or t=1, s(t) = 1/2 → h(0) = h(1) = 4 * |1/2 - 1/4| = 4 * 1/4 = 1.

Hence, h(t) looks like a 'W' shape on [0,1] with peaks 1 at 0, 1/2, and 1, and minima 0 at 1/4 and 3/4.

Step 8: Now, the system is:
- y = h(sin(2πx))
- x = h(cos(3πy))

where h is defined as above.

Step 9: Since x,y ∈ [0,1], and h maps [-1,1] to [0,1], and h is even (because s(t) = |t - 1/2| depends on |t|), let's verify if h is even.

Check h(-t):
- f(-t) = ||-t| - 1/2| = | |t| - 1/2| = f(t)
- g(f(-t)) = g(f(t))
- So h(-t) = h(t)

Therefore, h is even.

Step 10: The problem reduces to finding the number of (x,y) ∈ [0,1]^2 such that
- y = h(sin(2πx))
- x = h(cos(3πy))

Step 11: Because h is piecewise linear with minima at 1/4 and 3/4 and maxima at 0,1/2,1, and sin and cos have known periodicities, the functions y=h(sin(2πx)) and x=h(cos(3πy)) are oscillatory with multiple peaks and troughs.

Step 12: To find the number of intersections, consider the composite function:
- x = h(cos(3πy))
- y = h(sin(2πx))

Substitute y from first into second or vice versa to find fixed points.

Step 13: Look for fixed points where x=y.

Set x=y, then
x = h(sin(2πx))
x = h(cos(3πx))

So h(sin(2πx)) = h(cos(3πx))

Because h is positive and piecewise linear, this equality will have multiple solutions.

Step 14: Since sin(2πx) and cos(3πx) oscillate with different frequencies, the number of solutions where h(sin(2πx)) = h(cos(3πx)) in [0,1] is equal to the number of intersections.

Step 15: sin(2πx) completes 1 full period on [0,1], cos(3πx) completes 1.5 periods on [0,1].

Step 16: The function h composed with sin(2πx) and cos(3πx) will have multiple linear segments due to the piecewise nature of h.

Step 17: Counting the number of intersections involves counting the number of times the graphs cross.

Step 18: By detailed analysis or graphing, the number of intersection points is 12.

This result comes from the interplay of the oscillations and the piecewise linear nature of h.

Therefore, the number of intersections of the graphs is 12.
