    <pre>We seek real solutions (x,y) to 
  y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))),
  x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))).
Observe f(t)=||t|−½| has range [0,½] on t∈[−1,1], and g(u)=||u|−¼| maps [0,½] to [0,¼], so both 4g(f(⋯)) lie in [0,1].  Hence any intersection must lie in the unit square [0,1]×[0,1].

Each equation defines a periodic “triangular‐wave’’ curve in that square:  y=A(x) is a 2‐period sawtooth (in x with period 0.5) of amplitude 1, and x=B(y) is a 3‐period sawtooth in y (period 1/3) of amplitude 1.  Thus the plane is tiled by 2×3=6 identical fundamental cells of size 0.5×1/3, and inside each cell the two curves intersect in the same finite number N_cell of points.  

Restricting to one cell x∈[0,0.5], y∈[0,1/3], one finds the “V’’‐shaped y=A(x) has two monotonic branches that cross the “W’’‐shaped x=B(y), which oscillates 4 times up–and–down as y runs 0→1/3.  Each monotonic piece of B meets each branch of A exactly once, giving 8 intersections per branch pair, hence N_cell=16.  Since there are 6 cells, the total number of solutions is 16·6=96.
