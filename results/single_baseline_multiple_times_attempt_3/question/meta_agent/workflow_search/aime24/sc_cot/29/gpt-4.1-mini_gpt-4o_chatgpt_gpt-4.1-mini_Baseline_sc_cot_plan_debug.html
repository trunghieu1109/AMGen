    <pre>There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\times5$ grid such that: 

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.

Please think step by step and then solve the task.</pre>

    <pre>We are given 25 indistinguishable white chips and 25 indistinguishable black chips to place in a 5x5 grid with specific conditions. Each row and column can only contain chips of the same color, and no additional chip can be placed without violating these conditions. This suggests that each row or column must be completely filled with chips of one color, either all white or all black. Since there are 5 rows and 5 columns, we can choose a certain number of rows to be all white and the remaining rows to be all black. The same applies to columns. The number of ways to choose k rows to be all white is given by the binomial coefficient C(5, k). For each such choice of k rows, we must choose k columns to also be all white, which can be done in C(5, k) ways. Therefore, the total number of ways is the sum of C(5, k)^2 for k = 0 to 5.
