Question: There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\times5$ grid such that: 

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.

proposed answer: We have a 5x5 grid with 25 cells. We have 25 white chips and 25 black chips, all indistinguishable within their color. We want to place some chips on the grid with the following constraints:

1. Each cell contains at most one chip.
2. All chips in the same row have the same color.
3. All chips in the same column have the same color.
4. The placement is maximal: adding any additional chip would violate one or more of the previous conditions.

Step 1: Understand the color pattern constraints.
- Since all chips in the same row have the same color, each row is monochromatic or empty.
- Since all chips in the same column have the same color, each column is monochromatic or empty.

Step 2: Because each cell can contain at most one chip, and chips in a row and column must have the same color, the colors of rows and columns must be compatible.

Step 3: Let’s denote the color of row i as R_i and the color of column j as C_j. Each cell (i,j) can have a chip only if R_i = C_j.

Step 4: The grid cells that can be filled are those where row and column colors match. The chips placed are exactly these matching cells.

Step 5: Maximality means no additional chip can be placed without breaking conditions. So, any empty cell must have row and column colors differing, because if R_i = C_j and the cell is empty, we could add a chip there without violating constraints, contradicting maximality.

Step 6: Therefore, the grid is partitioned into two color classes for rows and columns: rows are assigned colors (white or black), columns are assigned colors (white or black), and chips are placed at the intersection of rows and columns with the same color.

Step 7: Let’s assign colors to rows: each row is either white or black (or empty, but empty rows mean no chips, which is allowed).
Similarly for columns.

Step 8: The chips placed are all cells where row and column colors match. The number of chips placed is the sum of (number of white rows) * (number of white columns) + (number of black rows) * (number of black columns).

Step 9: We have 25 chips of each color available, so the number of white chips placed cannot exceed 25, and similarly for black chips.

Step 10: Let w_r = number of white rows, b_r = number of black rows, w_c = number of white columns, b_c = number of black columns.
We have w_r + b_r <= 5, w_c + b_c <= 5.

Step 11: The number of white chips placed is w_r * w_c <= 25, black chips placed is b_r * b_c <= 25.
Since the grid is 5x5, these products are at most 25, so no problem with chip availability.

Step 12: Maximality implies that no cell with differing row and column colors is empty. So, for all i,j, if R_i != C_j, cell (i,j) is empty.

Step 13: The only remaining question is: how many such color assignments (R_i, C_j) are possible?

Step 14: Each row can be assigned white or black or no chips (empty). But if a row is empty, then it has no chips, which is allowed.
Similarly for columns.

Step 15: However, if a row is empty, then all its cells are empty, which is allowed.

Step 16: But maximality means we cannot add any chip without violating conditions. If a row is empty, then for any column that shares the same color as the row, the intersection cell is empty, so we could add a chip there, contradicting maximality.

Step 17: So, no empty rows or columns. Each row and column must be assigned either white or black.

Step 18: Therefore, each of the 5 rows is assigned either white or black (2^5 possibilities), and each of the 5 columns is assigned white or black (2^5 possibilities).

Step 19: The total number of ways to assign colors to rows and columns is 2^5 * 2^5 = 2^{10} = 1024.

Step 20: However, we need to consider that the chips are indistinguishable within their color, so different assignments that produce the same chip placement are distinct arrangements.

Step 21: The placement is determined by the sets of white rows and white columns (black rows and columns are the complement).

Step 22: The number of chips placed is w_r * w_c + b_r * b_c = w_r * w_c + (5 - w_r) * (5 - w_c).

Step 23: We must ensure that the total chips placed do not exceed 25 chips of each color. Since the maximum is 25, and the grid is 5x5, this is always true.

Step 24: So all 1024 assignments are valid.

Step 25: But, the problem states that the chips are indistinguishable, so different assignments that produce the same chip placement are different ways.

Step 26: Finally, the number of ways to place the chips is 1024.

Step 27: But wait, if we swap all colors (white <-> black) in rows and columns, the chip placement is the same but colors swapped. Since chips are distinguishable by color, these are different placements.

Step 28: Therefore, total number of placements is 1024.

Step 29: The problem asks for the number of ways to place some chips satisfying the conditions, so the answer is 1024.
