Question: There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\times5$ grid such that: 

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.

proposed answer: We need maximal placements of white/black chips in a 5×5 grid so that each filled row/column is monochromatic, and no additional chip can be added without violating monochromaticity. An empty cell must forbid placing either color, which only happens if its row and column are defined and have opposite colors. Any defined row paired with an undefined column (or vice versa) would allow adding a chip of the defined color, breaking maximality. Also the all-empty configuration is not maximal. Hence every one of the 5 rows and 5 columns must be assigned a color in {W,B}, giving 2^5 choices for rows and 2^5 for columns. Each cell (i,j) is filled exactly when the assigned colors agree. Thus the total is 2^5·2^5=1024.
