Question: Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent gKrT', content='Let x_k be the number of residents owning exactly k of the four items. Since every resident owns candy hearts, x_0=0. We know x_2=437, x_3=234, and let x_4=a. Also x_1+x_2+x_3+x_4=900 gives x_1 +a=900–(437+234)=229. The total count of owned items is 195+367+562+900=2024, which also equals x_1+2·437+3·234+4a = x_1+874+702+4a. Thus x_1+4a=2024–1576=448. Substituting x_1=229–a gives 229–a+4a=448, so 3a=219, hence a=73.\n\nAnswer:73', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
