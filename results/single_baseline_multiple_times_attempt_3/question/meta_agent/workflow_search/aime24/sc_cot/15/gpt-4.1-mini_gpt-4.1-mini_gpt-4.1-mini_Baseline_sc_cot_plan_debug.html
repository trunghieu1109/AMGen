    <pre>Let&#39;s define the sets:
- D: owns a diamond ring
- G: owns a set of golf clubs
- S: owns a garden spade
- C: owns a bag of candy hearts

Given:
- Total residents, N = 900
- |D| = 195
- |G| = 367
- |S| = 562
- |C| = 900 (since each owns a bag of candy hearts)
- Number of residents who own exactly two of these things = 437
- Number of residents who own exactly three of these things = 234

We want to find the number of residents who own all four things (exactly four).

Each resident owns at least one item (since everyone owns candy hearts), so no one owns zero items.

We can classify residents by the number of items they own:
- Exactly 1 item
- Exactly 2 items = 437
- Exactly 3 items = 234
- Exactly 4 items = x (what we want to find)

Since total residents = 900,
Number of residents who own exactly 1 item = 900 - (437 + 234 + x) = 900 - 671 - x = 229 - x

Now, let&#39;s count the total number of item-ownership instances. Each resident owning k items contributes k to the total count.

Total item ownerships = sum of sizes of all sets = |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| = 195 + 367 + 562 + 900 = 2024

On the other hand, total item ownerships can be calculated as:
= (number owning exactly 1 item)*1 + (number owning exactly 2 items)*2 + (number owning exactly 3 items)*3 + (number owning exactly 4 items)*4
= (229 - x)*1 + 437*2 + 234*3 + x*4
= 229 - x + 874 + 702 + 4x
= (229 + 874 + 702) + (-x + 4x)
= 1805 + 3x

Set equal to total ownerships:
1805 + 3x = 2024
3x = 2024 - 1805 = 219
x = 219 / 3 = 73

Therefore, 73 residents own all four items.
