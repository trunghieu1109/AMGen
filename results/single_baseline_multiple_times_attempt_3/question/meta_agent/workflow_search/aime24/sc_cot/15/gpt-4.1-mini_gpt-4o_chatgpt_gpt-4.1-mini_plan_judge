Question: Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.

proposed answer: To solve this problem, we will use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the number of residents who own all four items: a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, a garden spade, and a bag of candy hearts. We know that every resident owns a bag of candy hearts, so we focus on the other three items: diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades. Let D be the set of residents who own a diamond ring, G be the set of residents who own a set of golf clubs, and S be the set of residents who own a garden spade. We are given: |D| = 195, |G| = 367, |S| = 562, |D \cap G \cap S| = 234 (those who own all three items). We are also given that 437 residents own exactly two of these items. We want to find the number of residents who own all four items, which is the same as those who own all three items, since everyone owns a bag of candy hearts. Using the inclusion-exclusion principle: |D \cup G \cup S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D \cap G| - |G \cap S| - |S \cap D| + |D \cap G \cap S|. We are given that 437 residents own exactly two items, meaning |D \cap G| + |G \cap S| + |S \cap D| - 3|D \cap G \cap S| = 437. Let x = |D \cap G \cap S| = 234. Then, |D \cap G| + |G \cap S| + |S \cap D| = 437 + 3 * 234 = 1139. Substituting into the inclusion-exclusion equation: |D \cup G \cup S| = 195 + 367 + 562 - 1139 + 234 = 219. Therefore, 219 residents own at least one of the three items. Since 219 + 234 = 453 residents own at least two or three items, the number of residents who own all four items is 234, since owning all three items implies owning all four.
