Question: Alice chooses a set $A$ of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets $B$ of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of $B$ belongs to $A$. Bob's list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_3_26
proposed answer: From the previous reasoning, the set A was identified as {4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11}. This set corresponds to the powers of two that sum to 2024 when expressed as 2^(a-1). To find the sum of the elements of A, we simply add these integers: 4 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11. Calculating step-by-step: 4 + 6 = 10, 10 + 7 = 17, 17 + 8 = 25, 25 + 9 = 34, 34 + 10 = 44, 44 + 11 = 55. Therefore, the sum of the elements of A is 55. This is consistent with the unique binary decomposition of 2024 and the problem constraints.
