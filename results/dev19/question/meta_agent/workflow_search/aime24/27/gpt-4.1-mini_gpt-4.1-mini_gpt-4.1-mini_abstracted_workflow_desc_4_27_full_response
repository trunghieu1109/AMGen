They represent the four-digit number N as N = 1000d1 + 100d2 + 10d3 + d4, with d1 ≠ 0. Each agent correctly formulates the modular arithmetic constraints that changing any one digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. The constraints are expressed as four congruences modulo 7, each corresponding to replacing one digit with 1. The expressions are identical across all agents, confirming the correctness and consistency of the representation. This formalization is clear, generalizable, and directly captures the problem's conditions in modular arithmetic terms, which is suitable for further algebraic or computational analysis. Therefore, the most consistent formal representation and modular constraints are the four congruences: (1) 1000*1 + 100*d2 + 10*d3 + d4 ≡ 0 (mod 7), (2) 1000*d1 + 100*1 + 10*d3 + d4 ≡ 0 (mod 7), (3) 1000*d1 + 100*d2 + 10*1 + d4 ≡ 0 (mod 7), and (4) 1000*d1 + 100*d2 + 10*d3 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 7).; answer - Represent the four-digit number N as N = 1000d1 + 100d2 + 10d3 + d4 with d1 ≠ 0.
