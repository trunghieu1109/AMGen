Question: A list of positive integers has the following properties:
$\bullet$ The sum of the items in the list is $30$.
$\bullet$ The unique mode of the list is $9$.
$\bullet$ The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.
Find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

proposed answer: The valid list identified that satisfies all the problem constraints is [5, 7, 9, 9]. This list has a sum of 30, a unique mode of 9 (which appears twice, more than any other number), and a median of 6, which is a positive integer not in the list. To find the sum of the squares of all items in the list, we calculate: 5^2 + 7^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 = 25 + 49 + 81 + 81 = 236. This calculation is straightforward and directly follows from the identified list.
