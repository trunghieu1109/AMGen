Question: Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?

proposed answer: From Sub-task 9, the simplified probability fraction is 129/256, where m = 129 and n = 256. The problem asks for the sum m + n. Adding these gives 129 + 256 = 385. This is the final answer for Sub-task 10.

proposed answer: From Sub-task 15, the probability that there exists a rotation of the octagon such that all blue vertices map to positions originally colored red is 31/256. We need to verify that this fraction is in simplest form. Since 31 is a prime number and does not divide 256 (which is 2^8), the fraction 31/256 is already simplified. Therefore, m = 31 and n = 256. The final answer requested is m + n = 31 + 256 = 287. This is logically consistent with the previous results and the problem's conditions.
