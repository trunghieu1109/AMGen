Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: From the previous sub-task, the difference r_i - r_o was found to simplify to 3, which can be expressed as the fraction 3/1. Here, m = 3 and n = 1, and these are positive integers with no common factors (i.e., the fraction is in lowest terms). Therefore, the sum m + n = 3 + 1 = 4.

proposed answer: From the analysis, the difference r_i - r_o is expressed as the reduced fraction 16/5. Here, m = 16 and n = 5, which are positive integers and relatively prime. The problem asks for the sum m + n. Therefore, m + n = 16 + 5 = 21.

proposed answer: The problem involves finding the sum m + n from the reduced fraction m/n representing the difference r_i - r_o or a related quantity. From the final verification, the fraction 36/25 is identified as the correct reduced fraction that fits the geometric context of the problem. Both 36 and 25 are positive integers and relatively prime, making 36/25 a valid reduced fraction. The sum m + n is therefore 36 + 25 = 61. This result is consistent with the geometric reasoning and the problem's scale, confirming the correctness of the fraction and the sum.
