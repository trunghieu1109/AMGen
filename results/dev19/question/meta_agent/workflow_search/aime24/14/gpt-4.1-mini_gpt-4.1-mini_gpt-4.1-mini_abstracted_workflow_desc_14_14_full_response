Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent scBV', content="The problem is to find the greatest real number less than all possible values of BD^2 for rhombi ABCD inscribed in the hyperbola x^2/20 - y^2/24 = 1, with diagonals intersecting at the origin. The key steps are: 1) Parameterize points on the hyperbola as (sqrt(20) cosh u, sqrt(24) sinh u). 2) Represent the diagonals as vectors A and B with parameters u and v. 3) Use the perpendicularity condition of diagonals (A · B = 0) to relate tanh u and tanh v, yielding tanh u * tanh v = 5/6. 4) Define t = tanh u, so tanh v = 5/(6t). The domain for t is (5/6, 1) to keep |tanh v| < 1. 5) Express BD^2 in terms of t: BD^2 = 4(20 cosh^2 v + 24 sinh^2 v) = 80 + 4400/(36 t^2 - 25). 6) Analyze BD^2(t) on the domain (5/6, 1): as t approaches (5/6)^+, denominator approaches zero from above, so BD^2 → +∞; as t → 1^-, BD^2 → 80 + 4400/11 = 480. 7) BD^2(t) is strictly decreasing on (5/6, 1), so the infimum (greatest lower bound) of BD^2 is 480, but this value is not attained since t=1 is not in the domain. 8) This matches the problem's requirement for the greatest real number less than all possible BD^2 values. 9) The parameter feasibility and domain restrictions are explicitly checked: t in (5/6, 1), ensuring tanh v in (-1,1). 10) The final answer is thus 480, justified by the hyperbola parameterization, perpendicularity condition, domain analysis, and function behavior. This approach avoids skipping verification steps and is consistent with previous derivations and feedback.\n\nAnswer:480", prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.

The key constraints are that the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other at the origin, and all vertices lie on the hyperbola. Parameterizing points on the hyperbola as \\( (\\sqrt{20} \\cosh u, \\sqrt{24} \\sinh u) \\), the diagonals correspond to vectors \\( \\vec{A} = (\\sqrt{20} \\cosh u, \\sqrt{24} \\sinh u) \\) and \\( \\vec{B} = (\\sqrt{20} \\cosh v, \\sqrt{24} \\sinh v) \\). The perpendicularity condition \\( \\vec{A} \\cdot \\vec{B} = 0 \\) leads to \\( \\tanh u \\tanh v = \\frac{5}{6} \\). Letting \\( t = \\tanh u \\), then \\( \\tanh v = \\frac{5}{6t} \\), with domain restrictions \\( |t| \\in (\\frac{5}{6}, 1) \\) to ensure \\( |\\tanh v| < 1 \\). The squared length of diagonal BD is \\( BD^2 = 4(20 \\cosh^2 v + 24 \\sinh^2 v) \\), which simplifies to \\( BD^2 = 80 + \\frac{4400}{36 t^2 - 25} \\). Analyzing this function on the domain, as \\( t \\to (5/6)^+ \\), the denominator approaches zero from above, so \\( BD^2 \\to +\\infty \\). As \\( t \\to 1^- \\), \\( BD^2 \\to 80 + \\frac{4400}{11} = 480 \\). The function is strictly decreasing on the domain, so the infimum (greatest lower bound) of \\( BD^2 \\) is 480, which is not attained but approached as \\( t \\to 1^- \\). This rigorous approach satisfies all constraints, uses hyperbola parameterization, and confirms the solution via analysis of the function and domain. Hence, the greatest real number less than all possible values of \\( BD^2 \\) is 480.\n\n### Sub-task 2: Given all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final infimum analysis. \n\n ### thinking by Final Decision Agent H6Gc:\nAll four debate agents independently analyzed the problem of finding the infimum of BD^2 for rhombi inscribed in the hyperbola with diagonals intersecting at the origin. They parameterized the problem using t = tanh u, with the constraint tanh v = 5/(6t), and found the domain for t to be (5/6, 1). The function BD^2(t) = 80 + 4400/(36 t^2 - 25) is strictly decreasing on this domain. As t approaches 1 from below, BD^2 approaches 480 from above but never attains 480 because t=1 is not in the domain (tanh u < 1 for real u). As t approaches 5/6 from above, BD^2 tends to infinity. This means the infimum (greatest lower bound) of BD^2 is 480, but it is not a minimum since no t in the domain yields BD^2 = 480 exactly. The distinction between infimum and minimum is crucial: the infimum is the greatest value less than or equal to all values of BD^2 but may not be attained, while the minimum is the smallest value actually attained. Numeric verification and domain restrictions confirm this conclusion. The consensus among the agents and the mathematical reasoning confirm that the greatest real number less than all possible values of BD^2 is 480, which is the infimum but not a minimum. This analysis is robust, clear, and consistent with the problem\'s constraints and the behavior of the hyperbolic tangent function.\n\n\nPlease think broadly, explore multiple dimensions (e.g., effectiveness, generalizability, popularity, clarity, efficiency, potential risks), and adapt your reasoning dynamically depending on the nature of the plans.

They correctly identify that the hyperbola is centered at the origin, symmetric about both the x-axis and y-axis, and opens along the x-axis. They also correctly state that the domain of x-values for points on the hyperbola is |x| >= sqrt(20), and for each such x, y-values satisfy the equation accordingly. Each agent emphasizes that the points lie on the two branches of the hyperbola symmetric about both axes, with the origin as the center. None of the agents attempt to incorporate geometric constraints related to the rhombus at this stage, focusing solely on the domain characterization. Given the consistency, clarity, and completeness of these explanations, the synthesized domain characterization is that points A, B, C, and D lie on the two branches of the hyperbola centered at the origin, symmetric about both axes, with x-values satisfying |x| >= sqrt(20), and corresponding y-values determined by the hyperbola equation. This characterization is effective, generalizable, and clear, providing a solid foundation for further geometric analysis.; answer - Points A, B, C, and D lie on the hyperbola defined by \\( \\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \\), which is centered at the origin (0,0). The hyperbola is symmetric about both the x-axis and y-axis, meaning that if (x,y) is on the hyperbola, then (-x,y), (x,-y), and (-x,-y) are also on it. The hyperbola opens along the x-axis, so the domain of x-values for points on the hyperbola is all real numbers such that \\( |x| \\geq \\sqrt{20} \\). For each such x, the corresponding y-values satisfy \\( y = \\pm \\sqrt{24 \\left( \\frac{x^2}{20} - 1 \\right)} \\). Thus, points A, B, C, and D lie on the two branches of this hyperbola symmetric about both axes, with the origin as the center. At this stage, no geometric constraints related to the rhombus are considered; the focus is solely on the domain characterization of the points on the hyperbola.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - All three agents correctly identify the key geometric conditions for ABCD to be a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin. They agree that the origin being the midpoint of both diagonals implies A = -C and B = -D. They also correctly state that the diagonals are perpendicular, so the dot product of vectors AC and BD is zero, which translates to the dot product of vectors A and B being zero. Additionally, all points lie on the hyperbola, and the rhombus condition requires all sides to be equal in length. The explanations are consistent and complementary, but the response by Chain-of-Thought Agent ioEP is the most comprehensive and clear, explicitly listing all four key conditions: midpoint condition, perpendicularity, hyperbola constraint, and equal side lengths, without attempting to solve the system. This makes ioEP's formulation the most consistent and complete geometric conditions synthesis for the sub-task.; answer - The most consistent geometric conditions for ABCD to be a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin are: (1) The origin is the midpoint of both diagonals, implying A = -C and B = -D; (2) The diagonals are perpendicular, so the dot product of vectors AC and BD is zero, which means the dot product of vectors A and B is zero; (3) All points A, B, C, and D lie on the hyperbola \\( \\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \\); (4) All sides of the quadrilateral ABCD are equal in length, satisfying the rhombus condition. These conditions impose symmetry about the origin, orthogonality of the diagonals, and equal side lengths, constraining the coordinates of the points accordingly without solving the system yet.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - All three agents correctly identify the key algebraic constraints based on the problem conditions. The points A, B, C, D lie on the hyperbola, the diagonals intersect at the origin implying A = -C and B = -D, the diagonals are perpendicular implying A · B = 0, and the rhombus has equal side lengths implying |A - B| = |B + A|. Each agent expresses these constraints explicitly and separately without premature simplification. The constraints from Agent KExn are particularly clear and concise, explicitly stating the hyperbola constraints for A and B, the midpoint conditions, the perpendicularity condition, and the equal side length condition in terms of A and B. This set of constraints is consistent, complete, and avoids redundancy by leveraging symmetry and midpoint conditions. Therefore, the most consistent algebraic constraints are: 1) Hyperbola constraints: (x_A)^2/20 - (y_A)^2/24 = 1 and (x_B)^2/20 - (y_B)^2/24 = 1; 2) Midpoint conditions: C = -A and D = -B; 3) Perpendicular diagonals: x_A x_B + y_A y_B = 0; 4) Equal side lengths: (x_A - x_B)^2 + (y_A - y_B)^2 = (x_A + x_B)^2 + (y_A + y_B)^2.

This is a standard form of a hyperbola centered at the origin, opening along the x-axis. A well-known parametric representation of such a hyperbola uses hyperbolic functions \\( \\cosh(t) \\) and \\( \\sinh(t) \\), which satisfy the identity \\( \\cosh^2(t) - \\sinh^2(t) = 1 \\).

This covers both branches of the hyperbola, with \\( x \\) satisfying \\( |x| \\geq \\sqrt{20} \\) and \\( y \\) taking all real values.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - From sub-task 1, points on the hyperbola are parameterized as (x, y) = (sqrt(20)*cosh(t), sqrt(24)*sinh(t)) for any real t. For the rhombus ABCD with diagonals intersecting at the origin, the midpoint condition implies A = -C and B = -D. Thus, if A corresponds to parameter u and B corresponds to parameter v, then A = (sqrt(20)*cosh(u), sqrt(24)*sinh(u)) and B = (sqrt(20)*cosh(v), sqrt(24)*sinh(v)). Points C and D are then C = -A = (-sqrt(20)*cosh(u), -sqrt(24)*sinh(u)) and D = -B = (-sqrt(20)*cosh(v), -sqrt(24)*sinh(v)). The diagonals are vectors AC = C - A = -2A and BD = D - B = -2B. The diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular, so their dot product is zero: AC · BD = 0. Since AC = -2A and BD = -2B, this reduces to A · B = 0. Writing this explicitly: (sqrt(20)*cosh(u))*(sqrt(20)*cosh(v)) + (sqrt(24)*sinh(u))*(sqrt(24)*sinh(v)) = 0, which simplifies to 20*cosh(u)*cosh(v) + 24*sinh(u)*sinh(v) = 0. This is the perpendicularity condition relating u and v, so u and v are not independent but satisfy this equation. Therefore, the coordinates are: A = (sqrt(20)*cosh(u), sqrt(24)*sinh(u)), B = (sqrt(20)*cosh(v), sqrt(24)*sinh(v)), C = -A, D = -B, with u and v related by 20*cosh(u)*cosh(v) + 24*sinh(u)*sinh(v) = 0.; answer - A = (sqrt(20)*cosh(u), sqrt(24)*sinh(u)), B = (sqrt(20)*cosh(v), sqrt(24)*sinh(v)), C = -A = (-sqrt(20)*cosh(u), -sqrt(24)*sinh(u)), D = -B = (-sqrt(20)*cosh(v), -sqrt(24)*sinh(v)), with u and v related by the perpendicularity condition 20*cosh(u)*cosh(v) + 24*sinh(u)*sinh(v) = 0.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - We start with the parametric forms of points A and B on the hyperbola: A = (sqrt(20)*cosh(u), sqrt(24)*sinh(u)) and B = (sqrt(20)*cosh(v), sqrt(24)*sinh(v)). Points C and D are given by symmetry about the origin: C = -A and D = -B, consistent with the diagonals intersecting at the origin (0,0) as midpoint. First, verify that A and B lie on the hyperbola by substituting into the hyperbola equation x^2/20 - y^2/24 = 1. For A: (sqrt(20)*cosh(u))^2/20 - (sqrt(24)*sinh(u))^2/24 = cosh^2(u) - sinh^2(u) = 1, which holds by the hyperbolic identity. Similarly for B: cosh^2(v) - sinh^2(v) = 1, also true. Next, the diagonals of the rhombus are perpendicular, so their dot product is zero: A · B = 20*cosh(u)*cosh(v) + 24*sinh(u)*sinh(v) = 0. The rhombus side length equality condition |A - B| = |A + B| leads to the same relation after algebraic expansion and simplification. Thus, the equal side length condition and the perpendicularity condition coincide, giving a single key relation between u and v: 20*cosh(u)*cosh(v) + 24*sinh(u)*sinh(v) = 0. No other restrictions arise from the given conditions. Therefore, the parametric forms satisfy all constraints symbolically if and only if u and v satisfy this relation. This confirms the parametric validation and the consistency of the model with the problem's geometric and algebraic constraints.; answer - The parametric forms A = (sqrt(20)*cosh(u), sqrt(24)*sinh(u)), B = (sqrt(20)*cosh(v), sqrt(24)*sinh(v)), C = -A, and D = -B satisfy all constraints of the problem if and only if the parameters u and v satisfy the relation 20*cosh(u)*cosh(v) + 24*sinh(u)*sinh(v) = 0. This relation ensures that points A and B lie on the hyperbola, the diagonals intersect at the origin and are perpendicular, and the rhombus side lengths are equal. No additional restrictions on u and v arise, confirming the parametric validation fully.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 1 output: thinking - From the previous subtasks, points A and B on the hyperbola are parameterized as A = (sqrt(20)*cosh(u), sqrt(24)*sinh(u)) and B = (sqrt(20)*cosh(v), sqrt(24)*sinh(v)). Points C and D are symmetric about the origin, so C = -A and D = -B. The diagonals are AC = C - A = -A - A = -2A and BD = D - B = -B - B = -2B. The squared length of diagonal AC is |AC|^2 = (-2A)·(-2A) = 4|A|^2 = 4(x_A^2 + y_A^2) = 4(20*cosh^2(u) + 24*sinh^2(u)). Similarly, the squared length of diagonal BD is |BD|^2 = 4|B|^2 = 4(20*cosh^2(v) + 24*sinh^2(v)). These expressions are explicit in terms of u and v. They are consistent with the rhombus properties since the diagonals intersect at the origin and the points lie on the hyperbola. No approximations are made.

Points C and D are symmetric to A and B about the origin, so C = -A and D = -B. The diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin, which is their midpoint, so AC = -2A and BD = -2B. The diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular, so their dot product must be zero: AC · BD = 0, which reduces to A · B = 0. The side length equality means all sides have the same length. Using the symmetry, the side length squared can be expressed as |AB|^2 = |A - B|^2. The equality of side lengths also implies |AB| = |BC|, and since BC = C - B = -A - B, this leads to |A - B|^2 = |A + B|^2. Expanding these expressions and simplifying yields the condition A · B = 0 again. Thus, the perpendicularity of diagonals (A · B = 0) simultaneously enforces the side length equality. The points A and B lie on the hyperbola, so they satisfy (x_A)^2/20 - (y_A)^2/24 = 1 and (x_B)^2/20 - (y_B)^2/24 = 1. Substituting the parameterization, the system of equations is: 1) 20*cosh(u)*cosh(v) + 24*sinh(u)*sinh(v) = 0 (perpendicularity and side length equality), 2) cosh^2(u) - (24/20)*sinh^2(u) = 1, 3) cosh^2(v) - (24/20)*sinh^2(v) = 1 (hyperbola constraints). This system fully enforces the rhombus side length equality, perpendicularity of diagonals, and midpoint conditions simultaneously.; answer - The side length equality condition for the rhombus ABCD on the hyperbola is enforced by the system: (1) 20*cosh(u)*cosh(v) + 24*sinh(u)*sinh(v) = 0, which ensures perpendicularity of diagonals and equal side lengths; (2) cosh^2(u) - (24/20)*sinh^2(u) = 1 and cosh^2(v) - (24/20)*sinh^2(v) = 1, ensuring points A and B lie on the hyperbola. This system simultaneously enforces the rhombus side length equality, perpendicularity of diagonals, and midpoint conditions.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - From Sub-task 2, the key condition is that the diagonals are perpendicular, which implies A · B = 0. Using the parameterization A = (sqrt(20)*cosh(u), sqrt(24)*sinh(u)) and B = (sqrt(20)*cosh(v), sqrt(24)*sinh(v)), the dot product condition is 20*cosh(u)*cosh(v) - 24*sinh(u)*sinh(v) = 0. Rearranging, we get 20*cosh(u)*cosh(v) = 24*sinh(u)*sinh(v). Dividing both sides by cosh(u)*cosh(v), we have 20 = 24 * tanh(u) * tanh(v), or tanh(u)*tanh(v) = 20/24 = 5/6. Thus, tanh(v) = (5/6)/tanh(u). Let t = tanh(u), then tanh(v) = 5/(6t). Since tanh is bounded between -1 and 1, we require |t| > 5/6 for tanh(v) to be in (-1,1). Also, u and v are real numbers, so |t| < 1. Therefore, the domain of t is (5/6, 1) or (-1, -5/6). Next, express BD^2 in terms of t. Recall BD^2 = 4(20*cosh^2(v) + 24*sinh^2(v)). Using the identity cosh^2(x) - sinh^2(x) = 1, rewrite as BD^2 = 4(20 + 44*sinh^2(v)) or BD^2 = 4(20*cosh^2(v) - 20 + 24*sinh^2(v)) but the first form is simpler. Using tanh(v) = sinh(v)/cosh(v), we have sinh^2(v) = tanh^2(v)*cosh^2(v). Also, cosh^2(v) = 1/(1 - tanh^2(v)). Substitute tanh(v) = 5/(6t), so tanh^2(v) = 25/(36 t^2). Then cosh^2(v) = 1/(1 - 25/(36 t^2)) = 36 t^2 / (36 t^2 - 25). Therefore, sinh^2(v) = tanh^2(v)*cosh^2(v) = (25/(36 t^2)) * (36 t^2 / (36 t^2 - 25)) = 25 / (36 t^2 - 25). Substitute back into BD^2: BD^2 = 4(20 + 44 * (25 / (36 t^2 - 25))) = 4(20 + 1100 / (36 t^2 - 25)) = 80 + 4400 / (36 t^2 - 25). The domain for t is |t| in (5/6, 1), ensuring the denominator is positive and tanh(v) is valid. Thus, BD^2 as a function of t is BD^2(t) = 80 + 4400 / (36 t^2 - 25), with t in (5/6, 1) or (-1, -5/6). This expression explicitly relates BD^2 to a single parameter t, incorporating the perpendicularity and side length equality constraints and respecting the hyperbola domain restrictions.; answer - BD^2(t) = 80 + \\frac{4400}{36 t^2 - 25}, where t = tanh(u), and the domain of t is (5/6, 1) \\cup (-1, -5/6).\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 1 output: thinking - The problem involves finding the greatest real number less than all possible values of BD^2 for rhombi ABCD inscribed in the hyperbola \\( \\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \\) with diagonals intersecting at the origin.

The perpendicularity condition \\( \\vec{A} \\cdot \\vec{B} = 0 \\) leads to \\( \\tanh u \\tanh v = \\frac{5}{6} \\). Letting \\( t = \\tanh u \\), then \\( \\tanh v = \\frac{5}{6t} \\), with domain restrictions \\( |t| \\in (\\frac{5}{6}, 1) \\) to ensure \\( |\\tanh v| < 1 \\). The squared length of diagonal BD is \\( BD^2 = 4(20 \\cosh^2 v + 24 \\sinh^2 v) \\), which simplifies to \\( BD^2 = 80 + \\frac{4400}{36 t^2 - 25} \\). Analyzing this function on the domain, as \\( t \\to (5/6)^+ \\), the denominator approaches zero from above, so \\( BD^2 \\to +\\infty \\). As \\( t \\to 1^- \\), \\( BD^2 \\to 80 + \\frac{4400}{11} = 480 \\). The function is strictly decreasing on the domain, so the infimum (greatest lower bound) of \\( BD^2 \\) is 480, which is not attained but approached as \\( t \\to 1^- \\). This rigorous approach satisfies all constraints, uses hyperbola parameterization, and confirms the solution via analysis of the function and domain. Hence, the greatest real number less than all possible values of \\( BD^2 \\) is 480.; answer - 480\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - All four debate agents independently analyzed the problem of finding the infimum of BD^2 for rhombi inscribed in the hyperbola with diagonals intersecting at the origin. They parameterized the problem using t = tanh u, with the constraint tanh v = 5/(6t), and found the domain for t to be (5/6, 1). The function BD^2(t) = 80 + 4400/(36 t^2 - 25) is strictly decreasing on this domain. As t approaches 1 from below, BD^2 approaches 480 from above but never attains 480 because t=1 is not in the domain (tanh u < 1 for real u). As t approaches 5/6 from above, BD^2 tends to infinity. This means the infimum (greatest lower bound) of BD^2 is 480, but it is not a minimum since no t in the domain yields BD^2 = 480 exactly. The distinction between infimum and minimum is crucial: the infimum is the greatest value less than or equal to all values of BD^2 but may not be attained, while the minimum is the smallest value actually attained. Numeric verification and domain restrictions confirm this conclusion. The consensus among the agents and the mathematical reasoning confirm that the greatest real number less than all possible values of BD^2 is 480, which is the infimum but not a minimum. This analysis is robust, clear, and consistent with the problem's constraints and the behavior of the hyperbolic tangent function.; answer - The infimum of BD^2 for rhombi inscribed in the hyperbola with diagonals intersecting at the origin is 480. This value is not attained by any such rhombus (no minimum exists), but BD^2 can approach 480 arbitrarily closely from above. Therefore, the greatest real number less than all possible values of BD^2 is exactly 480, which is the infimum but not a minimum.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - The problem is to find the greatest real number less than all possible values of BD^2 for rhombi ABCD inscribed in the hyperbola x^2/20 - y^2/24 = 1, with diagonals intersecting at the origin. The key steps are: 1) Parameterize points on the hyperbola as (sqrt(20) cosh u, sqrt(24) sinh u). 2) Represent the diagonals as vectors A and B with parameters u and v. 3) Use the perpendicularity condition of diagonals (A · B = 0) to relate tanh u and tanh v, yielding tanh u * tanh v = 5/6. 4) Define t = tanh u, so tanh v = 5/(6t). The domain for t is (5/6, 1) to keep |tanh v| < 1. 5) Express BD^2 in terms of t: BD^2 = 4(20 cosh^2 v + 24 sinh^2 v) = 80 + 4400/(36 t^2 - 25). 6) Analyze BD^2(t) on the domain (5/6, 1): as t approaches (5/6)^+, denominator approaches zero from above, so BD^2 → +∞; as t → 1^-, BD^2 → 80 + 4400/11 = 480. 7) BD^2(t) is strictly decreasing on (5/6, 1), so the infimum (greatest lower bound) of BD^2 is 480, but this value is not attained since t=1 is not in the domain. 8) This matches the problem's requirement for the greatest real number less than all possible BD^2 values. 9) The parameter feasibility and domain restrictions are explicitly checked: t in (5/6, 1), ensuring tanh v in (-1,1). 10) The final answer is thus 480, justified by the hyperbola parameterization, perpendicularity condition, domain analysis, and function behavior. This approach avoids skipping verification steps and is consistent with previous derivations and feedback.; answer - 480", agents="CoT-SC agent HdYw, domain characterization, thinking: The hyperbola given by the equation \\( \\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \\) is centered at the origin (0,0). This is because the equation is in standard form for a hyperbola centered at the origin, with no linear terms in x or y. The hyperbola is symmetric about both the x-axis and the y-axis. This symmetry arises because the equation involves only even powers of x and y, and the signs of x and y do not affect the equation's validity. The domain of points A, B, C, and D is therefore the set of all points (x,y) that satisfy the hyperbola equation. Since the hyperbola opens along the x-axis (because the x-term is positive and the y-term is negative), the x-values must satisfy \\( |x| \\geq \\sqrt{20} \\) to ensure the right side of the equation remains positive. For each such x, the corresponding y-values are given by \\( y = \\pm \\sqrt{24 \\left( \\frac{x^2}{20} - 1 \\right)} \\).

The domain of points A, B, C, and D on this hyperbola consists of all points (x,y) that satisfy this equation. Because the hyperbola is symmetric about both the x-axis and y-axis, for any point (x,y) on the hyperbola, the points (-x,y), (x,-y), and (-x,-y) are also on the hyperbola. This symmetry arises from the even powers of x and y in the equation and the absence of linear terms. The center of the hyperbola is at the origin, which is the midpoint of the hyperbola's two branches. The hyperbola opens along the x-axis since the x-term is positive and the y-term is subtracted.

A rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal in length. Its diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. Let the points be A, B, C, and D. The diagonals are AC and BD. Because the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals, the coordinates satisfy A + C = 0 and B + D = 0 (vector addition). This means C = -A and D = -B. The diagonals being perpendicular means the dot product of vectors AC and BD is zero. Since AC = C - A = -A - A = -2A and BD = D - B = -B - B = -2B, the dot product A · B = 0. Therefore, the vectors representing points A and B are perpendicular. These conditions imply that points A and C are symmetric about the origin, as are points B and D. The rhombus condition that all sides are equal translates into equal distances between consecutive points, which can be expressed in terms of A and B. These geometric conditions constrain the coordinates of A, B, C, and D on the hyperbola but do not solve the system yet. This formulation sets the stage for further algebraic manipulation and solution finding.; answer: The geometric conditions for ABCD to be a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin are as follows: 1) The origin (0,0) is the midpoint of both diagonals AC and BD, implying that A + C = 0 and B + D = 0, so C = -A and D = -B. 2) The diagonals are perpendicular, so the dot product of vectors A and B is zero, i.e., A · B = 0. 3) Since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal in length, which imposes equality of the distances between consecutive vertices A, B, C, and D. These conditions imply that points A and C are symmetric about the origin, as are points B and D, and that the vectors representing A and B are perpendicular. The coordinates of A, B, C, and D must satisfy these conditions along with the hyperbola equation, but the system is not solved at this stage.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent hv61, geometric conditions, thinking: To formulate the geometric conditions for ABCD to be a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin, we start with the properties of a rhombus and the given conditions. A rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal in length, and its diagonals intersect at right angles and bisect each other. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, the origin must be the midpoint of both diagonals. This implies that if the diagonals are AC and BD, then the midpoint of AC and BD is (0,0). Therefore, the coordinates of points A and C must be negatives of each other (A = (x1, y1), C = (-x1, -y1)), and similarly for points B and D (B = (x2, y2), D = (-x2, -y2)). The perpendicularity of the diagonals means the dot product of the vectors AC and BD is zero: (x1, y1) · (x2, y2) = 0. These conditions impose symmetry about the origin and orthogonality of the diagonals. Additionally, since all points lie on the hyperbola, each point satisfies the hyperbola equation. These geometric conditions set up a system relating the coordinates of A, B, C, and D, ensuring the figure is a rhombus with diagonals intersecting perpendicularly at the origin, but do not yet solve for the coordinates or lengths.; answer: The geometric conditions for ABCD to be a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin are as follows: The origin (0,0) is the midpoint of both diagonals AC and BD, implying that points A and C are symmetric about the origin, as are points B and D. Specifically, if A = (x1, y1), then C = (-x1, -y1), and if B = (x2, y2), then D = (-x2, -y2). Additionally, the diagonals are perpendicular, so the vectors AC and BD satisfy the orthogonality condition (x1, y1) · (x2, y2) = 0.

A rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal in length. Its diagonals intersect at right angles and bisect each other. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin (0,0), the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. This implies that if the endpoints of one diagonal are points A and C, and the endpoints of the other diagonal are points B and D, then the midpoint condition gives (A + C)/2 = (B + D)/2 = (0,0), so A = -C and B = -D. The diagonals being perpendicular means the vectors AC and BD are orthogonal, so their dot product is zero. These conditions impose symmetry on the coordinates of points A, B, C, and D: points A and C are negatives of each other, as are points B and D. Additionally, since all points lie on the hyperbola, their coordinates satisfy the hyperbola equation. The equal side length condition of the rhombus further relates the distances between these points. However, at this stage, we only formulate the conditions without solving the system. Thus, the key geometric conditions are: (1) The origin is the midpoint of both diagonals, implying A = -C and B = -D; (2) The diagonals are perpendicular, so the dot product of vectors AC and BD is zero; (3) All points lie on the hyperbola; (4) All sides are equal in length.

Since the diagonals bisect each other at the origin, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals, implying A = -C and B = -D. The diagonals are perpendicular, so the dot product of vectors AC and BD is zero, which translates to the dot product of vectors A and B being zero. The rhombus has equal side lengths, so the lengths of sides AB, BC, CD, and DA are equal. Each point lies on the hyperbola, so their coordinates satisfy the hyperbola equation.

To match the given hyperbola, we set \\( x = \\sqrt{20} \\cosh(t) \\) and \\( y = \\sqrt{24} \\sinh(t) \\). Substituting these into the hyperbola equation confirms the identity holds for all real \\( t \\). The parameter \\( t \\) ranges over all real numbers \\( (-\\infty, \\infty) \\), which covers both branches of the hyperbola. The range of \\( x \\) is \\( |x| \\geq \\sqrt{20} \\) because \\( \\cosh(t) \\geq 1 \\) for all real \\( t \\), and the range of \\( y \\) is all real numbers since \\( \\sinh(t) \\) takes all real values. This parametric form is effective and generalizable, providing a clear and standard way to represent points on the hyperbola without introducing extra parameters or constraints at this stage.; answer: A parametric representation of points (x,y) on the hyperbola \\( \\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \\) is given by \\( x = \\sqrt{20} \\cosh(t) \\) and \\( y = \\sqrt{24} \\sinh(t) \\), where the parameter \\( t \\) ranges over all real numbers \\( (-\\infty, \\infty) \\). This covers both branches of the hyperbola, with \\( x \\) satisfying \\( |x| \\geq \\sqrt{20} \\) and \\( y \\) taking all real values.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT agent mzSM, parametric points A and B, thinking: From sub-task 1, points on the hyperbola are parameterized as (x, y) = (sqrt(20)*cosh(t), sqrt(24)*sinh(t)) for any real t. For the rhombus ABCD with diagonals intersecting at the origin, the midpoint condition implies A = -C and B = -D. Thus, if A corresponds to parameter u and B corresponds to parameter v, then A = (sqrt(20)*cosh(u), sqrt(24)*sinh(u)) and B = (sqrt(20)*cosh(v), sqrt(24)*sinh(v)). Points C and D are then C = -A = (-sqrt(20)*cosh(u), -sqrt(24)*sinh(u)) and D = -B = (-sqrt(20)*cosh(v), -sqrt(24)*sinh(v)). The diagonals are vectors AC = C - A = -2A and BD = D - B = -2B. The diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular, so their dot product is zero: AC · BD = 0. Since AC = -2A and BD = -2B, this reduces to A · B = 0. Writing this explicitly: (sqrt(20)*cosh(u))*(sqrt(20)*cosh(v)) + (sqrt(24)*sinh(u))*(sqrt(24)*sinh(v)) = 0, which simplifies to 20*cosh(u)*cosh(v) + 24*sinh(u)*sinh(v) = 0. This is the perpendicularity condition relating u and v, so u and v are not independent but satisfy this equation. Therefore, the coordinates are: A = (sqrt(20)*cosh(u), sqrt(24)*sinh(u)), B = (sqrt(20)*cosh(v), sqrt(24)*sinh(v)), C = -A, D = -B, with u and v related by 20*cosh(u)*cosh(v) + 24*sinh(u)*sinh(v) = 0.; answer: A = (sqrt(20)*cosh(u), sqrt(24)*sinh(u)), B = (sqrt(20)*cosh(v), sqrt(24)*sinh(v)), C = -A = (-sqrt(20)*cosh(u), -sqrt(24)*sinh(u)), D = -B = (-sqrt(20)*cosh(v), -sqrt(24)*sinh(v)), with u and v related by the perpendicularity condition 20*cosh(u)*cosh(v) + 24*sinh(u)*sinh(v) = 0.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent QeDX, validate parametric forms, thinking: We start with the parametric forms of points A and B on the hyperbola: \nA = (sqrt(20)*cosh(u), sqrt(24)*sinh(u))\nB = (sqrt(20)*cosh(v), sqrt(24)*sinh(v))\nPoints C and D are given by symmetry about the origin:\nC = -A = (-sqrt(20)*cosh(u), -sqrt(24)*sinh(u))\nD = -B = (-sqrt(20)*cosh(v), -sqrt(24)*sinh(v))\n\nFirst, verify that A and B lie on the hyperbola:\nFor A:\n(x_A)^2/20 - (y_A)^2/24 = (sqrt(20)*cosh(u))^2/20 - (sqrt(24)*sinh(u))^2/24 = (20*cosh^2(u))/20 - (24*sinh^2(u))/24 = cosh^2(u) - sinh^2(u) = 1\nSimilarly for B:\ncosh^2(v) - sinh^2(v) = 1\nSo both A and B satisfy the hyperbola equation.\n\nNext, the diagonals intersect at the origin, so C = -A and D = -B, which is consistent.\n\nThe diagonals are perpendicular, so their dot product is zero:\nA · B = x_A*x_B + y_A*y_B = sqrt(20)*cosh(u)*sqrt(20)*cosh(v) + sqrt(24)*sinh(u)*sqrt(24)*sinh(v) = 20*cosh(u)*cosh(v) + 24*sinh(u)*sinh(v) = 0\nThis is a key relation between u and v.\n\nNow, the rhombus has equal side lengths, so |A - B| = |B + A|.\nCalculate squared lengths:\n|A - B|^2 = (x_A - x_B)^2 + (y_A - y_B)^2\n= (sqrt(20)*cosh(u) - sqrt(20)*cosh(v))^2 + (sqrt(24)*sinh(u) - sqrt(24)*sinh(v))^2\n= 20(cosh(u) - cosh(v))^2 + 24(sinh(u) - sinh(v))^2\n\n|A + B|^2 = (x_A + x_B)^2 + (y_A + y_B)^2\n= (sqrt(20)*cosh(u) + sqrt(20)*cosh(v))^2 + (sqrt(24)*sinh(u) + sqrt(24)*sinh(v))^2\n= 20(cosh(u) + cosh(v))^2 + 24(sinh(u) + sinh(v))^2\n\nSet |A - B|^2 = |A + B|^2:\n20(cosh(u) - cosh(v))^2 + 24(sinh(u) - sinh(v))^2 = 20(cosh(u) + cosh(v))^2 + 24(sinh(u) + sinh(v))^2\n\nExpand both sides:\nLeft:\n20(cosh^2(u) - 2cosh(u)cosh(v) + cosh^2(v)) + 24(sinh^2(u) - 2sinh(u)sinh(v) + sinh^2(v))\nRight:\n20(cosh^2(u) + 2cosh(u)cosh(v) + cosh^2(v)) + 24(sinh^2(u) + 2sinh(u)sinh(v) + sinh^2(v))\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n20(cosh^2(u) - 2cosh(u)cosh(v) + cosh^2(v)) + 24(sinh^2(u) - 2sinh(u)sinh(v) + sinh^2(v)) - 20(cosh^2(u) + 2cosh(u)cosh(v) + cosh^2(v)) - 24(sinh^2(u) + 2sinh(u)sinh(v) + sinh^2(v)) = 0\n\nSimplify:\n20cosh^2(u) - 40cosh(u)cosh(v) + 20cosh^2(v) + 24sinh^2(u) - 48sinh(u)sinh(v) + 24sinh^2(v) - 20cosh^2(u) - 40cosh(u)cosh(v) - 20cosh^2(v) - 24sinh^2(u) - 48sinh(u)sinh(v) - 24sinh^2(v) = 0\n\nCancel terms:\n20cosh^2(u) - 20cosh^2(u) = 0\n20cosh^2(v) - 20cosh^2(v) = 0\n24sinh^2(u) - 24sinh^2(u) = 0\n24sinh^2(v) - 24sinh^2(v) = 0\n\nRemaining terms:\n-40cosh(u)cosh(v) - 48sinh(u)sinh(v) - 40cosh(u)cosh(v) - 48sinh(u)sinh(v) = 0\n\nCombine:\n-80cosh(u)cosh(v) - 96sinh(u)sinh(v) = 0\n\nDivide both sides by -16:\n5cosh(u)cosh(v) + 6sinh(u)sinh(v) = 0\n\nRecall from the perpendicularity condition:\n20cosh(u)cosh(v) + 24sinh(u)sinh(v) = 0\nDivide by 4:\n5cosh(u)cosh(v) + 6sinh(u)sinh(v) = 0\n\nThis is exactly the same as the above condition from equal side lengths.\n\nTherefore, the equal side length condition is equivalent to the perpendicularity condition of the diagonals.\n\nSummary of constraints:\n- Points A and B lie on the hyperbola.\n- Points C and D are symmetric to A and B about the origin.\n- Diagonals intersect at origin.\n- Diagonals are perpendicular: 20cosh(u)cosh(v) + 24sinh(u)sinh(v) = 0.\n- Equal side lengths condition reduces to the same equation.\n\nHence, the parametric forms satisfy all constraints if and only if u and v satisfy:\n20cosh(u)cosh(v) + 24sinh(u)sinh(v) = 0.\n\nNo additional restrictions arise beyond this relation, and the parametric forms are validated.; answer: The parametric forms A = (sqrt(20)*cosh(u), sqrt(24)*sinh(u)), B = (sqrt(20)*cosh(v), sqrt(24)*sinh(v)), C = -A, D = -B satisfy the hyperbola equation and the rhombus conditions if and only if the parameters u and v satisfy the relation 20*cosh(u)*cosh(v) + 24*sinh(u)*sinh(v) = 0. The equal side length condition reduces to the same relation, confirming all constraints are met symbolically without loss of information.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent dmWb, validate parametric forms, thinking: We start with the parametric forms of points A and B on the hyperbola: A = (sqrt(20)*cosh(u), sqrt(24)*sinh(u)) and B = (sqrt(20)*cosh(v), sqrt(24)*sinh(v)). Points C and D are given by C = -A and D = -B due to the diagonals intersecting at the origin (midpoint condition). First, we verify that A and B lie on the hyperbola by substituting into the hyperbola equation x^2/20 - y^2/24 = 1. For A: (sqrt(20)*cosh(u))^2/20 - (sqrt(24)*sinh(u))^2/24 = cosh^2(u) - sinh^2(u) = 1, which holds true by the hyperbolic identity. Similarly for B: cosh^2(v) - sinh^2(v) = 1, also true. Next, the rhombus condition requires equal side lengths. The sides are AB, BC, CD, and DA. Using the midpoint and symmetry, the diagonals are AC = C - A = -2A and BD = D - B = -2B. The diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular, so A · B = 0, which gives 20*cosh(u)*cosh(v) + 24*sinh(u)*sinh(v) = 0. The equal side length condition can be expressed as |A - B| = |A + B|. Squaring both sides: (x_A - x_B)^2 + (y_A - y_B)^2 = (x_A + x_B)^2 + (y_A + y_B)^2. Expanding and simplifying leads to the condition x_A x_B + y_A y_B = 0, which is the same as the perpendicularity condition. Therefore, the equal side length condition and perpendicular diagonals condition coincide, and the only restriction on u and v is 20*cosh(u)*cosh(v) + 24*sinh(u)*sinh(v) = 0. This confirms that the parametric forms satisfy all constraints symbolically, and the parameters u and v are related by this equation. No other restrictions arise from the given conditions.; answer: Points A and B are parameterized as A = (sqrt(20)*cosh(u), sqrt(24)*sinh(u)) and B = (sqrt(20)*cosh(v), sqrt(24)*sinh(v)), with C = -A and D = -B. Substituting into the hyperbola equation confirms both A and B lie on the hyperbola: cosh^2(u) - sinh^2(u) = 1 and cosh^2(v) - sinh^2(v) = 1. The rhombus side length equality condition |A - B| = |A + B| simplifies to the perpendicularity condition of diagonals A · B = 0, which explicitly is 20*cosh(u)*cosh(v) + 24*sinh(u)*sinh(v) = 0. Thus, the only relation or restriction on parameters u and v is this equation, ensuring all constraints are satisfied symbolically.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent KciP, validate parametric forms, thinking: Starting with the parametric forms of points A and B on the hyperbola: A = (sqrt(20)*cosh(u), sqrt(24)*sinh(u)) and B = (sqrt(20)*cosh(v), sqrt(24)*sinh(v)). Points C and D are given by C = -A and D = -B due to the diagonals intersecting at the origin (midpoint condition). First, verify that A and B lie on the hyperbola: substituting A into the hyperbola equation gives (x_A)^2/20 - (y_A)^2/24 = (sqrt(20)*cosh(u))^2/20 - (sqrt(24)*sinh(u))^2/24 = cosh^2(u) - sinh^2(u) = 1, which holds true by the hyperbolic identity. Similarly for B, the same substitution yields 1. Next, check the rhombus side length equality condition. The sides are equal if |A - B| = |B + A|. Compute the squared lengths: |A - B|^2 = (x_A - x_B)^2 + (y_A - y_B)^2 and |A + B|^2 = (x_A + x_B)^2 + (y_A + y_B)^2. Expanding, |A - B|^2 = (sqrt(20)(cosh(u) - cosh(v)))^2 + (sqrt(24)(sinh(u) - sinh(v)))^2 = 20(cosh(u) - cosh(v))^2 + 24(sinh(u) - sinh(v))^2. Similarly, |A + B|^2 = 20(cosh(u) + cosh(v))^2 + 24(sinh(u) + sinh(v))^2. The equality |A - B|^2 = |A + B|^2 implies: 20(cosh(u) - cosh(v))^2 + 24(sinh(u) - sinh(v))^2 = 20(cosh(u) + cosh(v))^2 + 24(sinh(u) + sinh(v))^2. Expanding both sides and simplifying leads to the condition: 20*cosh(u)*cosh(v) + 24*sinh(u)*sinh(v) = 0. This is exactly the perpendicularity condition of the diagonals (A · B = 0). Therefore, the rhombus side length equality condition and the perpendicularity condition are equivalent here. Hence, the constraints are: 1) A and B lie on the hyperbola, which is satisfied by the parametric form; 2) C = -A and D = -B; 3) The diagonals are perpendicular, which imposes the relation 20*cosh(u)*cosh(v) + 24*sinh(u)*sinh(v) = 0 between parameters u and v; 4) The rhombus side lengths are equal, which is equivalent to the perpendicularity condition. No additional constraints arise. Thus, the parametric forms satisfy all conditions symbolically, with the key restriction that u and v must satisfy 20*cosh(u)*cosh(v) + 24*sinh(u)*sinh(v) = 0.; answer: The parametric forms A = (sqrt(20)*cosh(u), sqrt(24)*sinh(u)), B = (sqrt(20)*cosh(v), sqrt(24)*sinh(v)), C = -A, D = -B satisfy the hyperbola equation for all real u and v. The rhombus side length equality condition |A - B| = |A + B| reduces to the perpendicularity condition of the diagonals, which imposes the relation 20*cosh(u)*cosh(v) + 24*sinh(u)*sinh(v) = 0 between u and v. Therefore, all constraints are satisfied symbolically with the restriction that u and v must satisfy this equation.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT agent n0OL, diagonal lengths, thinking: From the previous subtasks, points A and B on the hyperbola are parameterized as A = (sqrt(20)*cosh(u), sqrt(24)*sinh(u)) and B = (sqrt(20)*cosh(v), sqrt(24)*sinh(v)). Points C and D are symmetric about the origin, so C = -A and D = -B. The diagonals are AC = C - A = -A - A = -2A and BD = D - B = -B - B = -2B. The squared length of diagonal AC is |AC|^2 = (-2A)·(-2A) = 4|A|^2 = 4(x_A^2 + y_A^2) = 4(20*cosh^2(u) + 24*sinh^2(u)).

The diagonals intersect at the origin, which is their midpoint, satisfying the midpoint condition. The diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular, so the dot product of vectors AC and BD must be zero: AC · BD = 0. Since AC = -2A and BD = -2B, this reduces to A · B = 0. The side length of the rhombus is the length of AB, which must equal the length of BC, CD, and DA. Using vector notation, AB = B - A, BC = C - B, CD = D - C, DA = A - D. Because of symmetry and the midpoint condition, the side length squared can be expressed as |A - B|^2. The equality of side lengths leads to the condition |A - B|^2 = |B - C|^2 = |C - D|^2 = |D - A|^2. Using the symmetry and the fact that C = -A and D = -B, these reduce to |A - B|^2 = |A + B|^2. Expanding, |A - B|^2 = |A|^2 - 2A·B + |B|^2 and |A + B|^2 = |A|^2 + 2A·B + |B|^2. Equating these gives -2A·B = 2A·B, so A·B = 0, which is consistent with the perpendicularity condition. Therefore, the system of equations enforcing the rhombus conditions is: 1) A·B = 0 (perpendicular diagonals), 2) A and B lie on the hyperbola: (x_A)^2/20 - (y_A)^2/24 = 1 and (x_B)^2/20 - (y_B)^2/24 = 1, 3) Side length equality reduces to the same condition A·B = 0 due to symmetry and midpoint conditions. Explicitly, the system is: (sqrt(20)*cosh(u))*(sqrt(20)*cosh(v)) + (sqrt(24)*sinh(u))*(sqrt(24)*sinh(v)) = 0, which simplifies to 20*cosh(u)*cosh(v) + 24*sinh(u)*sinh(v) = 0, and the hyperbola constraints cosh^2(u) - (24/20)*sinh^2(u) = 1 and cosh^2(v) - (24/20)*sinh^2(v) = 1.

The rhombus has equal side lengths, so |AB| = |BC| = |CD| = |DA|. The diagonals intersect at the origin, so the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals, which is consistent with C = -A and D = -B. The diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular, so the dot product of vectors AC and BD is zero: AC · BD = 0. Since AC = -2A and BD = -2B, this implies A · B = 0. The side length squared is |AB|^2 = (x_B - x_A)^2 + (y_B - y_A)^2. Using the parameterization, this becomes (sqrt(20)(cosh(v) - cosh(u)))^2 + (sqrt(24)(sinh(v) - sinh(u)))^2. The condition for equal side lengths is that this length is the same for all sides, but since ABCD is a rhombus, it suffices to consider the side length squared as above. The perpendicularity condition is A · B = 0, which expands to sqrt(20)^2 cosh(u) cosh(v) + sqrt(24)^2 sinh(u) sinh(v) = 0, or 20 cosh(u) cosh(v) + 24 sinh(u) sinh(v) = 0.

The diagonals intersect at the origin, which is their midpoint, satisfying the midpoint condition. The diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular, so the dot product of vectors AC and BD must be zero: AC · BD = 0. Since AC = -2A and BD = -2B, this reduces to A · B = 0. The side length equality means all sides have the same length. The side length squared can be expressed as |AB|^2 = |A - B|^2 = (x_A - x_B)^2 + (y_A - y_B)^2. Similarly, |BC|^2 = |B - C|^2 = |B + A|^2 = (x_B + x_A)^2 + (y_B + y_A)^2. For a rhombus, |AB| = |BC|, so |A - B|^2 = |A + B|^2. Expanding, this implies (x_A - x_B)^2 + (y_A - y_B)^2 = (x_A + x_B)^2 + (y_A + y_B)^2, which simplifies to -4(x_A x_B + y_A y_B) = 0, or A · B = 0. Thus, the perpendicularity of the diagonals (A · B = 0) also ensures the side length equality. Therefore, the system of equations enforcing the rhombus conditions is: 1) A · B = 0 (perpendicular diagonals and side length equality), 2) A and B lie on the hyperbola, i.e., (x_A)^2/20 - (y_A)^2/24 = 1 and (x_B)^2/20 - (y_B)^2/24 = 1, with x_A = sqrt(20)*cosh(u), y_A = sqrt(24)*sinh(u), x_B = sqrt(20)*cosh(v), y_B = sqrt(24)*sinh(v). Explicitly, the system is: sqrt(20)*cosh(u)*sqrt(20)*cosh(v) + sqrt(24)*sinh(u)*sqrt(24)*sinh(v) = 0, which simplifies to 20*cosh(u)*cosh(v) + 24*sinh(u)*sinh(v) = 0. This equation enforces both the perpendicularity of diagonals and the equality of side lengths, given the midpoint condition at the origin.

Using the parameterization A = (sqrt(20)*cosh(u), sqrt(24)*sinh(u)) and B = (sqrt(20)*cosh(v), sqrt(24)*sinh(v)), the dot product condition is 20*cosh(u)*cosh(v) - 24*sinh(u)*sinh(v) = 0. Rearranging, we get 20*cosh(u)*cosh(v) = 24*sinh(u)*sinh(v). Dividing both sides by cosh(u)*cosh(v), we have 20 = 24 * tanh(u) * tanh(v), or tanh(u)*tanh(v) = 20/24 = 5/6. Thus, tanh(v) = (5/6)/tanh(u). Let t = tanh(u), then tanh(v) = 5/(6t). Since tanh is bounded between -1 and 1, we require |t| > 5/6 for tanh(v) to be in (-1,1). Also, u and v are real numbers, so |t| < 1. Therefore, the domain of t is (5/6, 1) or (-1, -5/6). Next, express BD^2 in terms of t. Recall BD^2 = 4(20*cosh^2(v) + 24*sinh^2(v)). Using the identity cosh^2(x) - sinh^2(x) = 1, rewrite as BD^2 = 4(20 + 44*sinh^2(v)) or BD^2 = 4(20*cosh^2(v) - 20 + 24*sinh^2(v)) but the first form is simpler. Using tanh(v) = sinh(v)/cosh(v), we have sinh^2(v) = tanh^2(v)*cosh^2(v). Also, cosh^2(v) = 1/(1 - tanh^2(v)). Substitute tanh(v) = 5/(6t), so tanh^2(v) = 25/(36 t^2). Then cosh^2(v) = 1/(1 - 25/(36 t^2)) = 36 t^2 / (36 t^2 - 25). Therefore, sinh^2(v) = tanh^2(v)*cosh^2(v) = (25/(36 t^2)) * (36 t^2 / (36 t^2 - 25)) = 25 / (36 t^2 - 25). Substitute back into BD^2: BD^2 = 4(20 + 44 * (25 / (36 t^2 - 25))) = 4(20 + 1100 / (36 t^2 - 25)) = 80 + 4400 / (36 t^2 - 25). The domain for t is |t| in (5/6, 1), ensuring the denominator is positive and tanh(v) is valid. Thus, BD^2 as a function of t is BD^2(t) = 80 + 4400 / (36 t^2 - 25), with t in (5/6, 1) or (-1, -5/6).

The rhombus ABCD has diagonals intersecting at the origin, so if A and C are opposite vertices, and B and D are opposite vertices, then A = -C and B = -D. The diagonals are vectors 2A and 2B, and since the diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular, \\( A \\cdot B = 0 \\). The side length equality condition implies \\( |A - B| = |A + B| \\), which simplifies to \\( A \\cdot B = 0 \\), consistent with the perpendicularity condition.

Using the parameterization, \\( A = (\\sqrt{20} \\cosh u, \\sqrt{24} \\sinh u) \\), \\( B = (\\sqrt{20} \\cosh v, \\sqrt{24} \\sinh v) \\), the dot product is \\( 20 \\cosh u \\cosh v - 24 \\sinh u \\sinh v = 0 \\).
