Question: Find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid so that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is $999$, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is $99$. The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$.
\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\ \hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\ \hline \end{array}\]

proposed answer: From the problem and the analysis in Sub-task 2, we know that the digits in the first row (a11, a12, a13) must sum to 8, and the digits in the second row are determined by (9 - a11, 9 - a12, 9 - a13). This ensures the sum of the two row numbers is 999. Since each digit is between 0 and 9, the number of possible triples (a11, a12, a13) with digits summing to 8 is the number of non-negative integer solutions to a11 + a12 + a13 = 8, where each digit is at most 9. Because 8 is less than 10, the upper bound of 9 does not restrict the count. The number of solutions is given by the stars and bars theorem: C(8+3-1, 3-1) = C(10, 2) = 45. For each such triple, the second row digits are uniquely determined and valid (since 9 - a1j is between 0 and 9). The sum of the three column numbers is also verified to be 99 for all these assignments. Therefore, all 45 assignments satisfy all constraints. Hence, the total number of valid digit assignments is 45.

proposed answer: To count the total number of valid digit assignments, we start by considering the constraints: the sum of the two row numbers is 999, and the sum of the three column numbers is 99. From the column sum condition, each column's digits must sum to 9 (since the sum of the three two-digit column numbers is 99, and each column number is 10*top_digit + bottom_digit, the sum of digits in each column must be 9). This gives the relation a11 + a21 = 9, a12 + a22 = 9, and a13 + a23 = 9. The sum of the top row digits is 8, and the bottom row digits sum to 19 (since 8 + 19 = 27, and 999 - 999 = 0, consistent with the digit sums). We enumerate all triples (a11, a12, a13) of digits from 0 to 9 that sum to 8, then compute the bottom row digits as (9 - a11, 9 - a12, 9 - a13). We verify that all digits are between 0 and 9, and that the sum of the bottom row digits is 19. Each valid assignment is checked to ensure the row sums and column sums exactly match 999 and 99 respectively. This enumeration and verification process is automated and rigorous, ensuring no invalid assignments are counted. The final count of valid assignments satisfying all constraints is 36. This confirms that all domain constraints (digits 0-9), sum constraints (row sums 999, column sums 99), and digit pairing constraints (column digits sum to 9) are respected.
