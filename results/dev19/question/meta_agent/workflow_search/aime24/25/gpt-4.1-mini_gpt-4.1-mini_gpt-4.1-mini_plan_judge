Question: Let ABCDEF be a convex equilateral hexagon in which all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle whose sides are extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. Find the side length of the hexagon.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_13_25
proposed answer: All four debate agents independently conclude that the hexagon's side length s is uniquely determined as 80 under the given constraints. The problem's conditions—convexity, equilateral sides, and three pairs of opposite sides parallel—imply the hexagon is a parallelogon with vector directions separated by 120 degrees. The triangle formed by the extensions of sides AB, CD, and EF, having side lengths 200, 240, and 300, corresponds to a scaled version of these vectors. Solving the vector equations and geometric constraints yields a unique solution s = 80. Alternative side lengths would violate convexity, parallelism, or the given triangle side lengths, making them invalid. The consensus among multiple independent solutions and the geometric rigidity of the problem confirm the uniqueness of s = 80. Therefore, the hexagon's side length is uniquely 80, with no alternative valid solutions under the given constraints.
