Question: Let $\omega\neq 1$ be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\]
is divided by 1000.
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_1_19
proposed answer: From the previous sub-task, the exact integer value of the product \( \prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) \) was found to be 8321. The current task is to find the remainder when this product is divided by 1000. To find the remainder modulo 1000, we compute 8321 mod 1000. Since 8321 divided by 1000 leaves a remainder of 321, the answer is 321.
