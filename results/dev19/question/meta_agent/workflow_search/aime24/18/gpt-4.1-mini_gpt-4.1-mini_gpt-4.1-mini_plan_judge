Question: Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). Then \(OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\).

proposed answer: From the previous sub-task, the value of OC^2 was found to be 2 - √3, which is an irrational number and cannot be expressed exactly as a ratio of two integers p/q. The problem states that OC^2 = p/q with p and q positive integers relatively prime, but the exact value 2 - √3 is irrational. Since no exact reduced fraction p/q exists for OC^2, the sum p+q cannot be determined as integers. Therefore, the problem as stated has no integer solution for p+q. Given this, the answer must reflect that no such integers p and q exist for the exact value of OC^2. Hence, the sum p+q is undefined or does not exist as integers.

Answer:No integer values p and q exist such that OC^2 = p/q; therefore, the sum p+q is undefined.
Extracted answer: No integer values p and q exist such that OC^2 = p/q; therefore, the sum p+q is undefined.

proposed answer: The fraction obtained for OC^2 is 7/16. To verify if it is in lowest terms, we check the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 7 and 16. Since 7 is a prime number and does not divide 16, the GCD is 1, meaning 7 and 16 are relatively prime. Both 7 and 16 are positive integers. Therefore, the fraction 7/16 is already in lowest terms and satisfies the problem's requirements. The sum p + q is 7 + 16 = 23. This confirms the fraction is properly reduced and the final answer is 23.
