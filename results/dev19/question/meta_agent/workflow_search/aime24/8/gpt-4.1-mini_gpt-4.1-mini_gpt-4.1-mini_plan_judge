Question: Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.

proposed answer: The game described is a classic impartial combinatorial game where players alternate removing either 1 or 4 tokens from a stack. The player who removes the last token wins. We want to find all positive integers n ≤ 2024 for which the initial position is losing for the first player (Alice), meaning Bob has a winning strategy regardless of Alice's moves. By analyzing the game states using backward induction or dynamic programming, we classify positions as winning (N-positions) or losing (P-positions). The base losing position is n=0 (no tokens left, the player to move loses). For n>0, a position is losing if all moves lead to winning positions; otherwise, it is winning. Checking small values: n=1 is winning (remove 1 to reach 0 losing), n=2 is winning (remove 1 to reach 1 winning, but since 1 is winning, 2 is winning), and so forth. Because the moves are 1 or 4, the pattern of losing positions repeats with a period related to 5. The losing positions are those where no move leads to a losing position. By enumerating, the only losing position is n=0. For all positive n, Alice can always move to a losing position for Bob, ensuring her win. Therefore, there are no positive integers n ≤ 2024 where Bob has a winning strategy regardless of Alice's moves. Hence, the count of such positive integers is 0.

proposed answer: The losing positions for Alice (winning for Bob) are all positive integers n ≤ 2024 such that n mod 5 = 0 or n mod 5 = 2. To count these, we consider two arithmetic progressions: one with terms 5, 10, 15, ..., up to the largest multiple of 5 ≤ 2024, and another with terms 2, 7, 12, ..., up to the largest number ≤ 2024 congruent to 2 mod 5. 

For n mod 5 = 0: The largest multiple of 5 less than or equal to 2024 is 2020 (since 2024/5 = 404.8, floor is 404, and 404*5=2020). So, the count of numbers ≤ 2024 with n mod 5 = 0 is 404.

For n mod 5 = 2: The sequence is 2, 7, 12, ..., up to the largest number ≤ 2024 with remainder 2 when divided by 5. To find the largest such number, note that 2022 mod 5 = 2 (since 2022 = 5*404 + 2). So the largest number in this sequence is 2022.

The count of terms in this sequence is ((2022 - 2)/5) + 1 = (2020/5) + 1 = 404 + 1 = 405.

Total losing positions = 404 (for mod 0) + 405 (for mod 2) = 809.

This count is exact, no double counting occurs since the two sets are disjoint, and it matches the validated pattern from the problem analysis.
