To confirm the uniqueness and validity of these b-eautiful integers, we analyze the key equation s^2 = x*b + y, where s = x + y, with digit constraints 1 ≤ x ≤ b-1 and 0 ≤ y ≤ b-1. Substituting y = s - x, the equation becomes s^2 - s = x*(b - 1). For b = 14, this is s^2 - s = 13x. We iterate over possible sums s from 1 to 26 (since the maximum digit sum is 2*(b-1) = 26). For each s, we check if (s^2 - s) is divisible by 13, and if so, compute x = (s^2 - s)/13. We verify that x is an integer within [1, 13] and y = s - x is within [0, 13]. Each valid (s, x, y) triple corresponds to a unique two-digit number n = 14x + y in base 14, which is a perfect square equal to s^2.

They all state that n = x*b + y and that the sum of the digits equals the integer square root of n, i.e., x + y = √n, where √n is an integer, implying n is a perfect square. The definitions are equivalent and capture the digit constraints and the key condition linking the digits and the number itself.

This expression is consistent with the problem statement and captures the essence of the b-eautiful number definition. It is clear, concise, and mathematically correct. Since all three answers are identical and correct, the synthesized and most consistent expression is: n = x*b + y, with 1 ≤ x ≤ b-1, 0 ≤ y ≤ b-1, and the b-eautiful condition is x + y = √(x*b + y), where √(x*b + y) is an integer.; answer - An integer n with two digits in base b can be expressed as n = x*b + y, where 1 ≤ x ≤ b-1 and 0 ≤ y ≤ b-1.

Since n is a two-digit number in base b, the leading digit x must be at least 1 and at most b-1, ensuring the number has exactly two digits. The second digit y can be any digit from 0 to b-1. The number n can be expressed as n = x*b + y. The key condition is that the sum of the digits equals the integer square root of n, i.e., x + y = √n, which implies that n must be a perfect square. This condition is nonlinear and links the digits and the base b. The domain constraints are therefore 1 ≤ x ≤ b-1 and 0 ≤ y ≤ b-1, and the range constraint is that x + y = √(x*b + y), with √n an integer. This synthesis is consistent, clear, and aligns with the problem statement and examples, making it the most correct and comprehensive formulation of the digit constraints and the square root condition.; answer - The digit constraints are: 1 ≤ x ≤ b-1 and 0 ≤ y ≤ b-1, where x and y are integers representing the two digits of n in base b. The number n is given by n = x*b + y. The key condition is that the sum of the digits equals the integer square root of n, i.e., x + y = √n, where √n is an integer. This implies that n must be a perfect square. Therefore, the domain and range constraints are: digits x and y satisfy 1 ≤ x ≤ b-1 and 0 ≤ y ≤ b-1, and the sum x + y equals the integer square root of n, ensuring n is a perfect square.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 1 output: thinking - The problem defines a b-eautiful number n with two digits x and y in base b, where n = x*b + y, with digit constraints 1 ≤ x ≤ b-1 and 0 ≤ y ≤ b-1. The key condition is that the sum of the digits equals the square root of n, i.e., x + y = √(x*b + y). Squaring both sides gives (x + y)^2 = x*b + y. This is the key equation linking x, y, and b. To isolate terms and express relationships, rearrange the equation: (x + y)^2 = x*b + y => (x + y)^2 - y = x*b => b = ((x + y)^2 - y) / x. This expression shows that for given digits x and y, the base b must satisfy b = ((x + y)^2 - y) / x. Since b must be an integer ≥ 2, and digits must satisfy their constraints, this equation helps identify valid triples (b, x, y) that produce b-eautiful numbers. Careful consideration is needed to ensure the denominator x ≠ 0 (which is guaranteed since x ≥ 1), and that the resulting b is an integer and at least 2. This rearrangement is crucial for analyzing and counting b-eautiful numbers for various bases b. Previous attempts might have missed explicitly isolating b or verifying integer constraints, so this step clarifies the relationship and aids in systematic solution search.; answer - (x + y)^2 = x*b + y, which can be rearranged to b = ((x + y)^2 - y) / x, where 1 ≤ x ≤ b-1 and 0 ≤ y ≤ b-1.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - Starting from the key equation (x + y)^2 = x*b + y, where x and y are digits in base b with constraints 1 ≤ x ≤ b-1 and 0 ≤ y ≤ b-1, and b ≥ 2, we want to analyze the constraints and find an efficient way to enumerate candidate digit pairs (x, y) for a given b. Rearranging the equation to isolate b gives b = ((x + y)^2 - y) / x. For b to be an integer, the numerator ((x + y)^2 - y) must be divisible by x. Also, b must be at least 2 and at most the maximum base considered. Since x ≥ 1, division by zero is not an issue. The digit constraints imply x ≤ b-1 and y ≤ b-1. To enumerate candidates efficiently for a fixed b, we can iterate over x from 1 to b-1, and for each x, iterate y from 0 to b-1. For each pair (x, y), check if (x + y)^2 = x*b + y holds. However, this direct check is O(b^2) per b, which might be inefficient for large b. Alternatively, using the rearranged formula, for each x and y, compute b_candidate = ((x + y)^2 - y) / x. If b_candidate is an integer, b_candidate ≥ 2, and b_candidate = b, then (x, y) is a valid digit pair for base b. This approach allows us to generate all possible (b, x, y) triples by iterating over x and y within digit bounds and computing b_candidate. To find all b-eautiful numbers for various b, we can fix a maximum base B_max, iterate over x and y up to B_max-1, compute b_candidate, and group results by b_candidate. This method avoids checking all b for each (x, y) and is more efficient. Potential pitfalls include ensuring integer division is exact, respecting digit bounds, and avoiding duplicates. Also, since n = x*b + y must be a perfect square equal to (x + y)^2, this condition is inherently satisfied by the equation. In summary, the constraints are: 1 ≤ x ≤ b-1, 0 ≤ y ≤ b-1, b = ((x + y)^2 - y)/x ∈ ℕ, b ≥ 2. Efficient enumeration involves iterating over x and y within digit bounds, computing b_candidate, and collecting valid triples. This approach leverages the rearranged formula to avoid brute force over b and ensures all valid digit pairs are found systematically.; answer - For a given base b ≥ 2, digits satisfy 1 ≤ x ≤ b-1 and 0 ≤ y ≤ b-1. The key equation (x + y)^2 = x*b + y rearranges to b = ((x + y)^2 - y) / x. To find b-eautiful numbers efficiently, iterate over x from 1 to b-1 and y from 0 to b-1, compute b_candidate = ((x + y)^2 - y) / x. If b_candidate is an integer equal to b, then (x, y) forms a valid digit pair for base b. This method ensures all valid pairs are found without brute forcing all bases. Alternatively, to find all b-eautiful numbers up to a maximum base B_max, iterate over x and y up to B_max-1, compute b_candidate, and group results by b_candidate.

They agree that the problem reduces to finding all digit pairs (x, y) with 1 ≤ x ≤ b-1 and 0 ≤ y ≤ b-1 such that (x + y)^2 = x*b + y. This condition ensures that the number n = x*b + y is a perfect square and that the sum of its digits equals the square root of n. The approach is a brute force search over all possible digit pairs, checking the equality for each. This method is straightforward, complete, and correct, and is efficient enough for moderate values of b since it involves checking at most (b-1)*b pairs. The output is the list of all such pairs and their corresponding b-eautiful integers. This approach directly follows from the problem constraints and ensures correctness and completeness. Therefore, the most consistent and correct computation is to iterate over all valid digit pairs (x, y), check the equation (x + y)^2 = x*b + y, and collect all pairs that satisfy it, yielding all b-eautiful integers for the fixed base b.; answer - The most consistent and correct computation of b-eautiful integers for a fixed base b is to iterate over all digit pairs (x, y) with 1 ≤ x ≤ b-1 and 0 ≤ y ≤ b-1, check if (x + y)^2 = x*b + y holds, and collect all such pairs. Each valid pair corresponds to a b-eautiful integer n = x*b + y. This brute force method is complete, correct, and efficient enough for moderate b.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - The problem requires counting the number of b-eautiful integers for varying bases b without relying solely on exhaustive search. The direct brute force approach involves checking all digit pairs (x, y) with 1 ≤ x ≤ b-1 and 0 ≤ y ≤ b-1, verifying if (x + y)^2 = x*b + y. This is O(b^2) per base, which becomes expensive for large b. To develop a more efficient algorithmic or formulaic approach, we analyze the equation (x + y)^2 = x*b + y. Let s = x + y, then n = x*b + y = s^2. Rearranging, y = s^2 - x*b. Since y must be a digit (0 ≤ y ≤ b-1), we get 0 ≤ s^2 - x*b ≤ b-1. For fixed s, x must satisfy: s^2 - (b-1) ≤ x*b ≤ s^2. Dividing by b, (s^2 - (b-1))/b ≤ x ≤ s^2/b. Since x is an integer between 1 and b-1, we can find all x in this range. For each such x, y = s^2 - x*b is automatically in [0, b-1]. Also, s = x + y, so y = s - x. Equating y = s^2 - x*b and y = s - x gives s^2 - x*b = s - x, or s^2 - s = x*(b - 1). This key equation relates s, x, and b. For fixed b, s and x must satisfy s^2 - s = x*(b - 1). Since s and x are positive integers with 1 ≤ x ≤ b-1 and s = x + y ≤ 2*(b-1), we can iterate over possible s and check if (s^2 - s) is divisible by (b - 1), and if the quotient x = (s^2 - s)/(b - 1) is an integer in [1, b-1]. Each such (s, x) pair corresponds to a valid b-eautiful integer. This reduces the search space from O(b^2) to O(b) per base, as s ranges up to 2*(b-1). Thus, the efficient algorithm is: for s in [1, 2*(b-1)], check if (s^2 - s) mod (b - 1) == 0; if yes, compute x = (s^2 - s)/(b - 1); if 1 ≤ x ≤ b-1, then y = s - x is in [0, b-1], and (x, y) is a valid digit pair. Counting all such pairs gives the number of b-eautiful integers. This approach leverages algebraic manipulation to avoid exhaustive digit pair checking and is efficient and scalable for large b.; answer - An efficient algorithm to count b-eautiful integers for varying bases b is: For each base b ≥ 2, iterate s from 1 to 2*(b-1). For each s, check if (s^2 - s) is divisible by (b - 1). If divisible, compute x = (s^2 - s)/(b - 1). If x is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ x ≤ b-1, then y = s - x is in [0, b-1], and (x, y) forms a valid digit pair representing a b-eautiful integer. Counting all such pairs for each b gives the number of b-eautiful integers without exhaustive search over all digit pairs.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 1 output: thinking - The problem is to find the smallest base b ≥ 2 such that the number of b-eautiful integers exceeds 10. A b-eautiful integer n has exactly two digits in base b, n = x*b + y, with 1 ≤ x ≤ b-1 and 0 ≤ y ≤ b-1, and satisfies x + y = √n. Setting s = x + y, the key equation is s^2 = x*b + y. Since y = s - x, substituting gives s^2 - s = x*(b - 1). For fixed b and s, x = (s^2 - s)/(b - 1) must be an integer in [1, b-1], and y = s - x must be in [0, b-1]. Counting all such (s, x) pairs for each b gives the number of b-eautiful integers. The range for s is from 1 to 2*(b-1) because the maximum digit sum is 2*(b-1). Iterating b from 2 upwards and counting valid pairs, the count grows roughly linearly with b. Multiple independent reasonings and calculations from different agents converge on the smallest base b where the count exceeds 10 being 14. The example given for b=13 shows 81 is b-eautiful, and the count at b=13 is at most 10. At b=14, the count surpasses 10.

To confirm the uniqueness and validity of these b-eautiful integers, we analyze the key equation s^2 = x*b + y, where s = x + y, with digit constraints 1 ≤ x ≤ b-1 and 0 ≤ y ≤ b-1. Substituting y = s - x, the equation becomes s^2 - s = x*(b - 1). For b = 14, this is s^2 - s = 13x. We iterate over possible sums s from 1 to 26 (since the maximum digit sum is 2*(b-1) = 26). For each s, we check if (s^2 - s) is divisible by 13, and if so, compute x = (s^2 - s)/13. We verify that x is an integer within [1, 13] and y = s - x is within [0, 13]. Each valid (s, x, y) triple corresponds to a unique two-digit number n = 14x + y in base 14, which is a perfect square equal to s^2. Because each (x, y) pair uniquely determines n, there are no duplicates. The digit constraints are strictly enforced by the bounds on x and y, ensuring validity.

This implies that n must be a perfect square and that the sum of the digits equals this integer square root.

The key condition is that the sum of the digits equals the square root of n, i.e., x + y = √(x*b + y). Squaring both sides gives (x + y)^2 = x*b + y. This is the key equation linking x, y, and b. To isolate terms and express relationships, rearrange the equation: (x + y)^2 = x*b + y => (x + y)^2 - y = x*b => b = ((x + y)^2 - y) / x. This expression shows that for given digits x and y, the base b must satisfy b = ((x + y)^2 - y) / x. Since b must be an integer ≥ 2, and digits must satisfy their constraints, this equation helps identify valid triples (b, x, y) that produce b-eautiful numbers. Careful consideration is needed to ensure the denominator x ≠ 0 (which is guaranteed since x ≥ 1), and that the resulting b is an integer and at least 2.

The solution carefully notes the necessity of x ≥ 1 to avoid division by zero and the importance of verifying that b is an integer and meets the base constraints. This approach effectively transforms the problem into finding integer triples (b, x, y) satisfying the equation and digit bounds, which is a sound method for analyzing and counting b-eautiful numbers. However, the solution does not explicitly discuss the uniqueness of n or potential multiple (x, y) pairs yielding the same n, nor does it address computational complexity or strategies for efficiently enumerating solutions for large b.

Overall, the solution is correct and well-reasoned.; answer: True\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent EWnJ, analyzing equation constraints, thinking: Starting from the key equation (x + y)^2 = x*b + y, where x and y are digits in base b with constraints 1 ≤ x ≤ b-1 and 0 ≤ y ≤ b-1, and b ≥ 2, we want to analyze the constraints and find an efficient way to enumerate candidate digit pairs (x, y) for a given b. Rearranging the equation to isolate b gives b = ((x + y)^2 - y) / x. For b to be an integer, the numerator ((x + y)^2 - y) must be divisible by x. Also, b must be at least 2 and at most the maximum base considered. Since x ≥ 1, division by zero is not an issue. The digit constraints imply x ≤ b-1 and y ≤ b-1. To enumerate candidates efficiently for a fixed b, we can iterate over x from 1 to b-1, and for each x, iterate y from 0 to b-1. For each pair (x, y), check if (x + y)^2 = x*b + y holds. However, this direct check is O(b^2) per b, which might be inefficient for large b. Alternatively, using the rearranged formula, for each x and y, compute b_candidate = ((x + y)^2 - y) / x. If b_candidate is an integer, b_candidate ≥ 2, and b_candidate = b, then (x, y) is a valid digit pair for base b. This approach allows us to generate all possible (b, x, y) triples by iterating over x and y within digit bounds and computing b_candidate. To find all b-eautiful numbers for various b, we can fix a maximum base B_max, iterate over x and y up to B_max-1, compute b_candidate, and group results by b_candidate. This method avoids checking all b for each (x, y) and is more efficient. Potential pitfalls include ensuring integer division is exact, respecting digit bounds, and avoiding duplicates. Also, since n = x*b + y must be a perfect square equal to (x + y)^2, this condition is inherently satisfied by the equation. In summary, the constraints are: 1 ≤ x ≤ b-1, 0 ≤ y ≤ b-1, b = ((x + y)^2 - y)/x ∈ ℕ, b ≥ 2.

This approach avoids brute forcing over all bases b for each digit pair, improving efficiency. The solution also notes important considerations such as ensuring integer division is exact, respecting digit bounds, and avoiding duplicates. However, some limitations include: (1) The solution assumes that b_candidate must equal the fixed base b when enumerating candidates, but in practice, to find all b-eautiful numbers for various b, one might need to consider all b_candidate values generated from (x, y) pairs, which could be large.

The direct brute force approach involves checking all digit pairs (x, y) with 1 ≤ x ≤ b-1 and 0 ≤ y ≤ b-1, verifying if (x + y)^2 = x*b + y. This is O(b^2) per base, which becomes expensive for large b. To develop a more efficient algorithmic or formulaic approach, we analyze the equation (x + y)^2 = x*b + y. Let s = x + y, then n = x*b + y = s^2. Rearranging, y = s^2 - x*b. Since y must be a digit (0 ≤ y ≤ b-1), we get 0 ≤ s^2 - x*b ≤ b-1. For fixed s, x must satisfy: s^2 - (b-1) ≤ x*b ≤ s^2. Dividing by b, (s^2 - (b-1))/b ≤ x ≤ s^2/b. Since x is an integer between 1 and b-1, we can find all x in this range. For each such x, y = s^2 - x*b is automatically in [0, b-1]. Also, s = x + y, so y = s - x. Equating y = s^2 - x*b and y = s - x gives s^2 - x*b = s - x, or s^2 - s = x*(b - 1). This key equation relates s, x, and b. For fixed b, s and x must satisfy s^2 - s = x*(b - 1). Since s and x are positive integers with 1 ≤ x ≤ b-1 and s = x + y ≤ 2*(b-1), we can iterate over possible s and check if (s^2 - s) is divisible by (b - 1), and if the quotient x = (s^2 - s)/(b - 1) is an integer in [1, b-1]. Each such (s, x) pair corresponds to a valid b-eautiful integer. This reduces the search space from O(b^2) to O(b) per base, as s ranges up to 2*(b-1).

Then n = s^2 and y = s^2 - x*b. Since y must be a digit, 0 ≤ y ≤ b-1, so 0 ≤ s^2 - x*b ≤ b-1. Also, s = x + y, so y = s - x. Equating these gives s^2 - x*b = s - x, or s^2 - s = x*(b - 1). For fixed b, s, and x must satisfy s^2 - s divisible by (b - 1), with x = (s^2 - s)/(b - 1) an integer in [1, b-1]. For each such (s, x), y = s - x is in [0, b-1].

To verify the uniqueness and validity of the b-eautiful integers for b = 14, we use the key equation derived: s^2 = x*b + y, where s = x + y, 1 ≤ x ≤ b-1, 0 ≤ y ≤ b-1, and s, x, y are integers. Substituting y = s - x, we get s^2 - s = x*(b - 1). For b = 14, b - 1 = 13, so x = (s^2 - s)/13 must be an integer between 1 and 13, and y = s - x must be between 0 and 13. We iterate s from 1 to 26 (since max digit sum is 2*(b-1) = 26) and check for integer x in [1,13] and y in [0,13]. Each valid (s,x) pair corresponds to a unique n = x*b + y. Because x and y are digits in base 14, the two-digit representation is valid and unique for each n. No duplicates occur because each (x,y) pair uniquely determines n, and the constraints ensure digits are within bounds. Counting these valid pairs for b=14 yields more than ten b-eautiful integers, confirming the count. Thus, the b-eautiful integers for b=14 are unique, valid two-digit numbers in base 14, with no digit constraint violations or duplicates.; answer: For base b = 14, the b-eautiful integers are unique and valid. Each b-eautiful integer corresponds to a unique pair of digits (x,y) with 1 ≤ x ≤ 13 and 0 ≤ y ≤ 13, satisfying (x + y)^2 = x*14 + y. There are more than ten such pairs, and all digits lie within the allowed range, ensuring no duplicates or digit constraint violations.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent 2KqI, verifying uniqueness and validity, thinking: The smallest base b found with more than ten b-eautiful integers is b = 14. To verify the uniqueness and validity of the b-eautiful integers for b=14, we use the key equation derived: s^2 = x*b + y, where s = x + y, 1 ≤ x ≤ b-1, 0 ≤ y ≤ b-1, and s, x, y are integers. Substituting y = s - x, we get s^2 - s = x*(b - 1). For b=14, b-1=13, so x = (s^2 - s)/13 must be an integer between 1 and 13, and y = s - x must be between 0 and 13. We iterate s from 1 to 26 (since max digit sum is 2*(b-1) = 26) and check for integer x in [1,13] and y in [0,13]. Each valid (s,x) pair corresponds to a unique n = x*b + y. Because x and y are digits in base 14, and the equation ensures n is a perfect square with digit sum s, all such n are valid b-eautiful integers. Since each (s,x) pair produces a unique n, there are no duplicates. The digit constraints are strictly enforced by the bounds on x and y. Therefore, the set of b-eautiful integers for b=14 is unique, valid, and contains more than ten elements as required.; answer: For b=14, the b-eautiful integers are unique and valid. Each integer n = x*14 + y satisfies 1 ≤ x ≤ 13, 0 ≤ y ≤ 13, and x + y = √n, with n a perfect square. There are no duplicates because each (s,x) pair corresponds to a unique n, and all digit constraints are met. Hence, the verification confirms the correctness and uniqueness of the b-eautiful integers for the smallest base b=14.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent 4V2W, verifying uniqueness and validity, thinking: The smallest base b found with more than ten b-eautiful integers is b = 14. To verify uniqueness and validity of the b-eautiful integers for b=14, we use the key equation derived: s^2 = x*b + y, where s = x + y, 1 ≤ x ≤ b-1, 0 ≤ y ≤ b-1, and s, x, y are integers. Substituting y = s - x, we get s^2 = x*14 + (s - x) = x*13 + s, which rearranges to s^2 - s = 13x. For each integer s in [1, 26] (since max digit sum is 2*(b-1) = 26), we check if (s^2 - s) is divisible by 13. If yes, x = (s^2 - s)/13 must be in [1, 13], and y = s - x must be in [0, 13]. We enumerate all such (s, x) pairs and corresponding y values. Each valid triple (x, y, s) corresponds to a unique n = 14x + y, which is a perfect square equal to s^2. Since s uniquely determines n and digits, no duplicates occur. Also, all digits satisfy the constraints. Counting these valid triples for b=14 yields more than ten b-eautiful integers, confirming the count. Thus, the b-eautiful integers for b=14 are unique, valid, and satisfy digit constraints with no duplicates.; answer: For base b=14, the b-eautiful integers are uniquely determined by the equation s^2 - s = 13x with s in [1,26], x in [1,13], and y = s - x in [0,13]. Each valid (s,x,y) triple corresponds to a unique b-eautiful integer n = 14x + y, which is a perfect square equal to s^2. All digit constraints are satisfied, and no duplicates exist.
