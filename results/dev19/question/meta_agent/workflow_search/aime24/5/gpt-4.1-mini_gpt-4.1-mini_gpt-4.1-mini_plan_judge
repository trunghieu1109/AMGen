Question: Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.

proposed answer: From the final simplified inradius expression r = (3√41)/49, we identify m = 3, n = 41, and p = 49. The problem asks to sum these integers. Adding them gives 3 + 41 + 49 = 93. This sum is the final answer requested in Sub-task 8.

proposed answer: From sub-task 10, the simplified inradius expression is (√72222)/156, which corresponds to m=1, n=72222, and p=156. All are positive integers, m and p are coprime, and n is square-free. The problem asks to sum these integers: m + n + p = 1 + 72222 + 156 = 72379. This sum is exact and meets all problem requirements.
