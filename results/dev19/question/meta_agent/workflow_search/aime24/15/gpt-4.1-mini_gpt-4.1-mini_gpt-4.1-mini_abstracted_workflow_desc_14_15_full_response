Question: Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.

Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Final Decision Agent mh41', content="Given that every resident owns candy hearts, the problem effectively reduces to analyzing the ownership of the other three items: diamond rings (D), golf clubs (G), and garden spades (S), with candy hearts (C) being universal. The total population is 900. The counts given are: |D|=195, |G|=367, |S|=562, exactly two items owned = 437, exactly three items owned = 234, and all own candy hearts. The 'exactly two' and 'exactly three' counts include candy hearts as one of the items. Owning exactly two items means owning candy hearts plus exactly one of D, G, or S; owning exactly three items means candy hearts plus exactly two of D, G, S; owning all four means candy hearts plus D, G, and S. Let x be the number owning all four items, i.e., |D ∩ G ∩ S|. Using inclusion-exclusion and the given counts, the number owning exactly one item (only candy hearts) is 900 - (437 + 234 + x).

All 900 residents own candy hearts, so C is the universal set. The problem reduces to analyzing ownership of D, G, and S with candy hearts owned by all. The given data: total residents = 900, |D|=195, |G|=367, |S|=562, exactly two items owned = 437, exactly three items owned = 234, and all own candy hearts. The \'exactly two\' and \'exactly three\' counts include candy hearts as one of the items. Since everyone owns candy hearts, owning exactly two items means owning candy hearts plus exactly one of D, G, or S; owning exactly three items means candy hearts plus exactly two of D, G, S; owning all four means candy hearts plus D, G, and S. Let x = number owning all four items = |D ∩ G ∩ S|. From previous analysis, x = 73. Using inclusion-exclusion and the given counts, we find the number owning exactly one item (only candy hearts) is 900 - (number owning 2 + 3 + 4 items) = 900 - (437 + 234 + 73) = 156. So the disjoint subsets are: owning exactly 1 item (only candy hearts): 156, exactly 2 items: 437, exactly 3 items: 234, exactly 4 items: 73. Summing these: 156 + 437 + 234 + 73 = 900, which matches the total population.

They consistently stated the total number of residents as 900, the number owning diamond rings as 195, golf clubs as 367, garden spades as 562, and that all 900 residents own candy hearts. They also noted the counts of residents owning exactly two items as 437 and exactly three items as 234. Since all three agents agree and the data is clearly stated without interpretation, the most consistent and correct data extraction is the combined clear statement of these values. This extraction respects the instruction to avoid assumptions and only state given numerical data and conditions.; answer - Total residents in Aimeville: 900; Number owning a diamond ring: 195; Number owning a set of golf clubs: 367; Number owning a garden spade: 562; Number owning a bag of candy hearts: 900 (all residents); Number owning exactly two of these items: 437; Number owning exactly three of these items: 234.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - The problem states that every resident owns a bag of candy hearts, so the candy hearts set includes all 900 residents. The counts for \'exactly two\' and \'exactly three\' items owned are given as 437 and 234 respectively. The key ambiguity is whether these counts include candy hearts as one of the items or not. Since candy hearts are universally owned, if candy hearts are counted among the four items, then owning candy hearts is automatic and does not differentiate residents. This means \'exactly two\' would mean candy hearts plus exactly one other item, and \'exactly three\' would mean candy hearts plus exactly two other items. Alternatively, if candy hearts are excluded from these counts, then \'exactly two\' and \'exactly three\' refer only to the other three items (diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade). The problem does not explicitly clarify this, and different interpretations affect the calculation of intersections and the quadruple intersection. Other agents\' solutions also note this ambiguity and treat candy hearts differently depending on their assumptions. Therefore, the interpretation of \'exactly two\' and \'exactly three\' ownership counts in the context of universal candy hearts ownership is ambiguous and requires explicit clarification. The assumption about whether candy hearts ownership is counted among these totals or excluded must be stated clearly before proceeding with calculations. Without this clarification, the problem\'s counting and inclusion-exclusion approach cannot be definitively applied.; answer - The interpretation of \'exactly two\' and \'exactly three\' ownership counts is ambiguous due to the universal ownership of candy hearts. It is unclear whether these counts include candy hearts as one of the items or exclude it. If candy hearts are included, then \'exactly two\' means candy hearts plus one other item, and \'exactly three\' means candy hearts plus two other items. If excluded, these counts refer only to diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades. This ambiguity must be explicitly clarified before proceeding with any calculations.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 1 output: thinking - The problem involves four sets representing ownership of items among 900 residents: diamond rings (D), golf clubs (G), garden spades (S), and candy hearts (C). Since every resident owns candy hearts, set C includes all 900 residents, i.e., |C| = 900. We need to formally represent these sets and define variables for all possible intersections among them. The sets are: D, G, S, and C. The single sets are |D|, |G|, |S|, and |C|. The double intersections are |D ∩ G|, |D ∩ S|, |D ∩ C|, |G ∩ S|, |G ∩ C|, |S ∩ C|. The triple intersections are |D ∩ G ∩ S|, |D ∩ G ∩ C|, |D ∩ S ∩ C|, |G ∩ S ∩ C|. The quadruple intersection is |D ∩ G ∩ S ∩ C|. Since C includes all residents, intersections involving C are effectively the same as the other sets alone or their intersections, but for formal completeness, we define all intersections. We assign variables to each intersection to represent their sizes. This formal representation will help analyze the problem using set theory and inclusion-exclusion principles.; answer - Let the sets be defined as follows: D = set of residents owning a diamond ring, G = set of residents owning a set of golf clubs, S = set of residents owning a garden spade, C = set of residents owning a bag of candy hearts. Given that every resident owns candy hearts, |C| = 900. Define variables for the sizes of all possible intersections: Single sets: |D| = d, |G| = g, |S| = s, |C| = 900. Double intersections: |D ∩ G| = x, |D ∩ S| = y, |D ∩ C| = d_c, |G ∩ S| = z, |G ∩ C| = g_c, |S ∩ C| = s_c. Triple intersections: |D ∩ G ∩ S| = u, |D ∩ G ∩ C| = v, |D ∩ S ∩ C| = w, |G ∩ S ∩ C| = t. Quadruple intersection: |D ∩ G ∩ S ∩ C| = q. Since C includes all residents, |D ∩ C| = |D| = d, |G ∩ C| = g, |S ∩ C| = s, and similarly for triple intersections involving C, they reduce to the intersections of the other sets. However, for formal completeness, we keep these variables. This formal representation captures all single, double, triple, and quadruple intersections among the four sets.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - Given the four sets D (diamond rings), G (golf clubs), S (garden spades), and C (candy hearts), with C being universal (all 900 residents own candy hearts), we want to express the counts of residents owning exactly two and exactly three items in terms of intersections of D, G, and S, incorporating the universal ownership of C. Since everyone owns C, owning exactly two items means owning candy hearts plus exactly one of D, G, or S. Similarly, owning exactly three items means owning candy hearts plus exactly two of D, G, or S. The quadruple intersection corresponds to owning all four items. We define variables for the intersections among D, G, and S: let x = |D ∩ G ∩ S| (triple intersection), and let the pairwise intersections be |D ∩ G|, |D ∩ S|, |G ∩ S|. The number owning exactly two items is the sum of residents owning candy hearts plus exactly one of D, G, or S, which corresponds to those owning exactly one of D, G, S. The number owning exactly three items is the sum of residents owning candy hearts plus exactly two of D, G, or S, which corresponds to those owning exactly two of D, G, S. Using standard set theory, the number owning exactly one of D, G, S is: (|D| - |D ∩ G| - |D ∩ S| + x) + (|G| - |D ∩ G| - |G ∩ S| + x) + (|S| - |D ∩ S| - |G ∩ S| + x). The number owning exactly two of D, G, S is: (|D ∩ G| - x) + (|D ∩ S| - x) + (|G ∩ S| - x). Therefore, the expressions relating the given counts to the intersection variables, incorporating the universal candy hearts ownership, are: Exactly two items owners = |D only| + |G only| + |S only| = (|D| - |D ∩ G| - |D ∩ S| + x) + (|G| - |D ∩ G| - |G ∩ S| + x) + (|S| - |D ∩ S| - |G ∩ S| + x); Exactly three items owners = (|D ∩ G| - x) + (|D ∩ S| - x) + (|G ∩ S| - x). These expressions are logically consistent, correctly incorporate the universal candy hearts ownership assumption, and relate the counts of exactly two and exactly three items owned to the intersection variables without solving them.; answer - Let D, G, S be the sets of residents owning diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades respectively, and C be the universal set of candy hearts owners (all 900 residents). Define x = |D ∩ G ∩ S|. Then: Exactly two items owners = (|D| - |D ∩ G| - |D ∩ S| + x) + (|G| - |D ∩ G| - |G ∩ S| + x) + (|S| - |D ∩ S| - |G ∩ S| + x); Exactly three items owners = (|D ∩ G| - x) + (|D ∩ S| - x) + (|G ∩ S| - x). These expressions incorporate the universal candy hearts ownership assumption by focusing on intersections among D, G, and S, since all residents own candy hearts, and relate the counts of exactly two and exactly three items owned to the intersection variables without solving them.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 1 output: thinking - We have four sets: D (diamond rings), G (golf clubs), S (garden spades), and C (candy hearts). Since every resident owns candy hearts, C is the universal set with |C| = 900. The problem involves finding the number of residents owning all four items, i.e., |D ∩ G ∩ S ∩ C|. Because C includes everyone, the problem reduces to analyzing intersections among D, G, and S, with candy hearts ownership implicit. Define the following variables: |D| = 195, |G| = 367, |S| = 562, and |C| = 900. Let x = |D ∩ G ∩ S| (triple intersection of the three non-universal sets). Let the pairwise intersections be: a = |D ∩ G|, b = |D ∩ S|, c = |G ∩ S|. Since everyone owns candy hearts, owning exactly two items means owning candy hearts plus exactly one of D, G, or S. Owning exactly three items means owning candy hearts plus exactly two of D, G, or S. The counts given are: exactly two items = 437, exactly three items = 234. Using set theory, the number owning exactly one of D, G, S is: (|D| - a - b + x) + (|G| - a - c + x) + (|S| - b - c + x). The number owning exactly two of D, G, S is: (a - x) + (b - x) + (c - x). Since exactly two items owned corresponds to owning candy hearts plus exactly one of D, G, S, we have: exactly two items = number owning exactly one of D, G, S = (|D| + |G| + |S|) - 2(a + b + c) + 3x. Similarly, exactly three items = number owning exactly two of D, G, S = (a + b + c) - 3x. These two equations form a system: 437 = (|D| + |G| + |S|) - 2(a + b + c) + 3x and 234 = (a + b + c) - 3x. From the second equation, (a + b + c) = 234 + 3x. Substitute into the first: 437 = (195 + 367 + 562) - 2(234 + 3x) + 3x = 1124 - 468 - 6x + 3x = 656 - 3x. Rearranged: 3x = 656 - 437 = 219, so x = 73. The quadruple intersection (all four items) equals x = |D ∩ G ∩ S ∩ C| = 73. Thus, by algebraic manipulation and parameter identification, the quadruple intersection variable is isolated as x = 73. This approach uses the given counts and set theory relations without final numeric solution steps beyond parameter isolation.; answer - Define variables: a = |D ∩ G|, b = |D ∩ S|, c = |G ∩ S|, x = |D ∩ G ∩ S| (triple intersection). Given exactly two items owned = 437 and exactly three items owned = 234, and total owners |D|=195, |G|=367, |S|=562, with candy hearts universal (|C|=900). The equations are: 437 = (|D| + |G| + |S|) - 2(a + b + c) + 3x and 234 = (a + b + c) - 3x. These can be solved or simplified to isolate x, the quadruple intersection variable, as x = ( (|D| + |G| + |S|) - 437 - 2*234 ) / 3. This algebraic manipulation identifies the intersection variables and constraints needed to find the number owning all four items without final numeric evaluation.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - The problem involves four items: diamond rings (D), golf clubs (G), garden spades (S), and candy hearts (C). Since every resident owns candy hearts, C is the universal set with |C| = 900. The main goal is to validate the intersection values inferred in Sub-task 1, particularly the triple intersection x = |D ∩ G ∩ S| = 73, which also equals the quadruple intersection |D ∩ G ∩ S ∩ C| because candy hearts are universal.\n\nFrom Sub-task 1, the sum of pairwise intersections is (a + b + c) = 453. We verify consistency with individual set sizes: each pairwise intersection must be at least the triple intersection (73), and the triple intersection must be less than or equal to each individual set size (195, 367, 562), which holds true.\n\nUsing inclusion-exclusion, the union of D, G, and S is 744, which is less than the total population 900, consistent with candy hearts being universal.\n\nThe counts for exactly two items (437) and exactly three items (234) correspond to owning candy hearts plus exactly one or two of D, G, S respectively. The algebraic relations and substitutions confirm these counts match the inferred intersection values.\n\nNo contradictions arise: all counts are non-negative, individual set sizes are respected, and the total population is not exceeded.\n\nKey assumptions include that "exactly two" and "exactly three" counts include candy hearts as one of the four items, and that all residents own candy hearts, simplifying the problem to intersections among D, G, and S.\n\nThis interpretation aligns with the algebraic derivation and is supported by multiple agents\' analyses. It ensures the inferred intersection values are consistent with the given individual ownership counts and total population.\n\nTherefore, the validation confirms the intersection values are logically consistent and the assumptions made are necessary and reasonable for the problem\'s coherence.; answer - The inferred intersection values, including the triple (and quadruple) intersection of 73 residents owning all four items, are consistent with the given individual ownership counts for diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades. This consistency holds under the key assumption that "exactly two" and "exactly three" item ownership counts include candy hearts as one of the four items, and that all residents own candy hearts. No contradictions arise, and the values satisfy set theory principles and the total population constraints.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 1 output: thinking - We have four items: diamond rings (D), golf clubs (G), garden spades (S), and candy hearts (C).

The counts for \'exactly two\' and \'exactly three\' items owned are given as 437 and 234 respectively. The key ambiguity is whether these counts include candy hearts as one of the items or not. Since candy hearts are universally owned, if candy hearts are counted among the four items, then owning candy hearts is automatic and does not affect the count of \'exactly two\' or \'exactly three\' items owned. However, if candy hearts are included in the count, then no one can own fewer than one item (since candy hearts is always owned), and the minimum number of items owned is one. This would mean \'exactly two\' and \'exactly three\' counts include candy hearts plus one or two other items. Alternatively, if candy hearts are excluded from these counts, then \'exactly two\' and \'exactly three\' refer only to the other three items (diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade).

The problem does not explicitly clarify this. Some interpretations might exclude candy hearts from these counts because it is universal and does not affect the count of ownership combinations, while others might include it, which would affect the calculation of intersections and the quadruple intersection.

Since every resident owns candy hearts, set C includes all 900 residents, i.e., |C| = 900. We need to formally represent these sets and define variables for all possible intersections among them. The sets are: D, G, S, and C. The single sets are |D|, |G|, |S|, and |C|. The double intersections are |D ∩ G|, |D ∩ S|, |D ∩ C|, |G ∩ S|, |G ∩ C|, |S ∩ C|. The triple intersections are |D ∩ G ∩ S|, |D ∩ G ∩ C|, |D ∩ S ∩ C|, |G ∩ S ∩ C|. The quadruple intersection is |D ∩ G ∩ S ∩ C|. Since C includes all residents, intersections involving C are effectively the same as the other sets alone or their intersections, but for formal completeness, we define all intersections. We assign variables to each intersection to represent their sizes. This formal representation will help analyze the problem using set theory and inclusion-exclusion principles.; answer: Let the sets be defined as follows: D = set of residents owning a diamond ring, G = set of residents owning a set of golf clubs, S = set of residents owning a garden spade, C = set of residents owning a bag of candy hearts. Given that every resident owns candy hearts, |C| = 900. Define variables for the sizes of all possible intersections: Single sets: |D| = d, |G| = g, |S| = s, |C| = 900. Double intersections: |D ∩ G| = x, |D ∩ S| = y, |D ∩ C| = d_c, |G ∩ S| = z, |G ∩ C| = g_c, |S ∩ C| = s_c. Triple intersections: |D ∩ G ∩ S| = u, |D ∩ G ∩ C| = v, |D ∩ S ∩ C| = w, |G ∩ S ∩ C| = t. Quadruple intersection: |D ∩ G ∩ S ∩ C| = q. Since C includes all residents, |D ∩ C| = |D| = d, |G ∩ C| = g, |S ∩ C| = s, and similarly for triple intersections involving C, they reduce to the intersections of the other sets. However, for formal completeness, we keep these variables. This formal representation captures all single, double, triple, and quadruple intersections among the four sets.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent Yr2h, deriving expressions, thinking: Given four sets D (diamond rings), G (golf clubs), S (garden spades), and C (candy hearts), with |C| = 900 (universal set), we define variables for all intersections: single sets |D|, |G|, |S|, |C|; double intersections |D∩G|, |D∩S|, |D∩C|, |G∩S|, |G∩C|, |S∩C|; triple intersections |D∩G∩S|, |D∩G∩C|, |D∩S∩C|, |G∩S∩C|; and quadruple intersection |D∩G∩S∩C|. Since C is universal, any intersection with C equals the other set or intersection alone, e.g., |D∩C| = |D|, |D∩G∩C| = |D∩G|, etc. The problem states the number of residents owning exactly two items is 437, and exactly three items is 234. "Exactly two" means owning precisely two of the four items, and "exactly three" means owning precisely three of the four items. Because all own C, owning two items means owning C plus exactly one of D, G, or S, or owning exactly two of D, G, S without C (impossible since all have C). Similarly, owning exactly three items means owning C plus exactly two of D, G, S, or owning all three of D, G, S without C (impossible). Therefore, the "exactly two" owners correspond to those owning C and exactly one of D, G, S, and "exactly three" owners correspond to those owning C and exactly two of D, G, S. Using variables for intersections among D, G, S only (since C is universal), we can express: Exactly two items owners = number owning exactly one of D, G, S plus those owning exactly two of D, G, S but excluding those owning all three. But since all have C, owning exactly two items means owning C plus exactly one of D, G, S. So, the count of exactly two items owners = number of residents owning exactly one of D, G, S. Similarly, exactly three items owners = number owning exactly two of D, G, S. Using intersection variables for D, G, S, the expressions for exactly one and exactly two sets are standard in set theory. Let x = |D ∩ G ∩ S| (triple intersection), and define variables for pairwise intersections excluding triple intersection, and single sets excluding any intersections. Then, the number owning exactly one of D, G, S = |D only| + |G only| + |S only|, and number owning exactly two of D, G, S = sum of pairwise intersections excluding triple intersection. Therefore, the expressions are: Exactly two items owners = |D only| + |G only| + |S only| = (|D| - |D ∩ G| - |D ∩ S| + |D ∩ G ∩ S|) + (|G| - |D ∩ G| - |G ∩ S| + |D ∩ G ∩ S|) + (|S| - |D ∩ S| - |G ∩ S| + |D ∩ G ∩ S|), and Exactly three items owners = (|D ∩ G| - x) + (|D ∩ S| - x) + (|G ∩ S| - x). These expressions incorporate the universal candy hearts ownership assumption by focusing on D, G, S intersections only, as C is universal and does not affect the count of exactly two or three items owned beyond being always present. This formulation is logically consistent and correctly relates the given counts to the intersection variables without solving them.; answer: Let D, G, S be the sets of residents owning diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades respectively, and C be the set of all residents owning candy hearts (|C|=900). Define x = |D ∩ G ∩ S| (triple intersection), and let the pairwise intersections excluding triple intersection be |D ∩ G| - x, |D ∩ S| - x, |G ∩ S| - x. Since all residents own candy hearts, owning exactly two items means owning candy hearts plus exactly one of D, G, or S; owning exactly three items means owning candy hearts plus exactly two of D, G, S. Therefore, the number owning exactly two items is equal to the number owning exactly one of D, G, S, given by: (|D| - |D ∩ G| - |D ∩ S| + x) + (|G| - |D ∩ G| - |G ∩ S| + x) + (|S| - |D ∩ S| - |G ∩ S| + x). The number owning exactly three items is equal to the number owning exactly two of D, G, S, given by: (|D ∩ G| - x) + (|D ∩ S| - x) + (|G ∩ S| - x). These expressions correctly incorporate the universal candy hearts ownership assumption and relate the given counts of exactly two and exactly three items owned to the intersection variables without solving them.\n<SEPERATOR>\nCoT-SC agent xcou, deriving expressions, thinking: Given four sets D (diamond rings), G (golf clubs), S (garden spades), and C (candy hearts), with |C| = 900 (universal set), we define variables for all intersections: single sets |D|, |G|, |S|, |C|; double intersections |D∩G|, |D∩S|, |D∩C|, |G∩S|, |G∩C|, |S∩C|; triple intersections |D∩G∩S|, |D∩G∩C|, |D∩S∩C|, |G∩S∩C|; and quadruple intersection |D∩G∩S∩C|. Since C is universal, any intersection with C equals the other set or intersection alone, e.g., |D∩C| = |D|, |D∩G∩C| = |D∩G|, etc. The problem states the number of residents owning exactly two items is 437, and exactly three items is 234. "Exactly two" means owning precisely two of the four items; "exactly three" means owning precisely three of the four items. Because all own C, owning two items means owning candy hearts plus exactly one of D, G, or S, or owning exactly two among D, G, S without counting C (since C is universal). However, since C is universal, owning exactly two items must mean owning candy hearts plus exactly one other item (since everyone owns C), or owning exactly two among D, G, S but not counting C. But the problem\'s wording suggests the counts include candy hearts as one of the four items. Therefore, the sets of residents owning exactly two items are those who own exactly two of the four sets (D, G, S, C). Similarly for exactly three items. To express these counts in terms of intersection variables, we consider the partition of the universal set into 16 disjoint subsets corresponding to all combinations of presence/absence of D, G, S, and C. Since C is universal, the subsets where C is absent are empty. Thus, only subsets with C present exist. The subsets with exactly two items owned correspond to those with C plus exactly one of D, G, or S, or those with exactly two of D, G, S plus C. But since C is always present, owning exactly two items means owning C plus exactly one of D, G, or S. Similarly, owning exactly three items means owning C plus exactly two of D, G, S. Therefore, the number owning exactly two items is the sum of the sizes of the sets: (D only with C), (G only with C), (S only with C). The number owning exactly three items is the sum of the sizes of the sets: (D and G with C), (D and S with C), (G and S with C), excluding those who own all three D, G, S with C (which is exactly four items). Using variables for intersections, we define: Let x1 = |D only with C|, x2 = |G only with C|, x3 = |S only with C|, x4 = |D and G with C but not S|, x5 = |D and S with C but not G|, x6 = |G and S with C but not D|, x7 = |D and G and S with C| (quadruple intersection). Then: Exactly two items = x1 + x2 + x3; Exactly three items = x4 + x5 + x6. The quadruple intersection x7 corresponds to owning all four items. The problem gives: Exactly two items = 437, Exactly three items = 234. These expressions relate the counts to the intersection variables, incorporating the universal candy hearts ownership assumption.

Then, the number owning exactly two items is x1 + x2 + x3 = 437, and the number owning exactly three items is x4 + x5 + x6 = 234.

Since C is universal, any intersection with C is effectively the other set(s) alone, but we keep them for formal completeness. The problem states that exactly two items are owned by 437 residents and exactly three items by 234 residents. Because all residents own candy hearts, the counts of exactly two and exactly three items must include candy hearts as one of the items. Therefore, the residents owning exactly two items are those who own candy hearts plus exactly one of the other three items, or those who own exactly two of the three items D, G, S but not candy hearts (which is impossible since candy hearts is universal). Similarly, exactly three items owned means candy hearts plus exactly two of the other three items, or all three of D, G, S plus candy hearts. Using the intersection variables, the number of residents owning exactly two items is the sum of the sizes of the sets where the resident is in exactly two of the four sets. This can be expressed as the sum of the sizes of the pairwise intersections minus twice the triple intersections plus thrice the quadruple intersection, but since candy hearts is universal, the expressions simplify. Explicitly, the number of residents owning exactly two items is: (|D∩G| - |D∩G∩S| - |D∩G∩C| - |G∩S∩C| + 2|D∩G∩S∩C|) + (|D∩S| - |D∩G∩S| - |D∩S∩C| - |G∩S∩C| + 2|D∩G∩S∩C|) + (|G∩S| - |D∩G∩S| - |D∩S∩C| - |G∩S∩C| + 2|D∩G∩S∩C|) + (|D∩C| - |D∩G∩C| - |D∩S∩C| - |D∩G∩S∩C|) + (|G∩C| - |D∩G∩C| - |G∩S∩C| - |D∩G∩S∩C|) + (|S∩C| - |D∩S∩C| - |G∩S∩C| - |D∩G∩S∩C|).

Since every resident owns candy hearts, C is the universal set with |C| = 900. The problem involves finding the number of residents owning all four items, i.e., |D ∩ G ∩ S ∩ C|. Because C includes everyone, the problem reduces to analyzing intersections among D, G, and S, with candy hearts ownership implicit. Define the following variables: |D| = 195, |G| = 367, |S| = 562, and |C| = 900. Let x = |D ∩ G ∩ S| (triple intersection of the three non-universal sets). Let the pairwise intersections be: a = |D ∩ G|, b = |D ∩ S|, c = |G ∩ S|. Since everyone owns candy hearts, owning exactly two items means owning candy hearts plus exactly one of D, G, or S. Owning exactly three items means owning candy hearts plus exactly two of D, G, or S. The counts given are: exactly two items = 437, exactly three items = 234. Using set theory, the number owning exactly one of D, G, S is: (|D| - a - b + x) + (|G| - a - c + x) + (|S| - b - c + x). The number owning exactly two of D, G, S is: (a - x) + (b - x) + (c - x). Since exactly two items owned corresponds to owning candy hearts plus exactly one of D, G, S, we have: exactly two items = number owning exactly one of D, G, S = (|D| + |G| + |S|) - 2(a + b + c) + 3x. Similarly, exactly three items = number owning exactly two of D, G, S = (a + b + c) - 3x. These two equations form a system: 437 = (|D| + |G| + |S|) - 2(a + b + c) + 3x and 234 = (a + b + c) - 3x. From the second equation, (a + b + c) = 234 + 3x. Substitute into the first: 437 = (195 + 367 + 562) - 2(234 + 3x) + 3x = 1124 - 468 - 6x + 3x = 656 - 3x. Rearranged: 3x = 656 - 437 = 219, so x = 73. The quadruple intersection (all four items) equals x = |D ∩ G ∩ S ∩ C| = 73. Thus, by algebraic manipulation and parameter identification, the quadruple intersection variable is isolated as x = 73. This approach uses the given counts and set theory relations without final numeric solution steps beyond parameter isolation.; answer: Define variables: a = |D ∩ G|, b = |D ∩ S|, c = |G ∩ S|, x = |D ∩ G ∩ S| (triple intersection). Given exactly two items owned = 437 and exactly three items owned = 234, and total owners |D|=195, |G|=367, |S|=562, with candy hearts universal (|C|=900). The equations are: 437 = (|D| + |G| + |S|) - 2(a + b + c) + 3x and 234 = (a + b + c) - 3x. These can be solved or simplified to isolate x, the quadruple intersection variable, as x = ( (|D| + |G| + |S|) - 437 - 2*234 ) / 3.

All 900 residents own candy hearts, so C is the universal set. The problem reduces to analyzing ownership of D, G, and S with candy hearts owned by all. The given data: total residents = 900, |D|=195, |G|=367, |S|=562, exactly two items owned = 437, exactly three items owned = 234, and all own candy hearts. The \'exactly two\' and \'exactly three\' counts include candy hearts as one of the items. Since everyone owns candy hearts, owning exactly two items means owning candy hearts plus exactly one of D, G, or S; owning exactly three items means candy hearts plus exactly two of D, G, S; owning all four means candy hearts plus D, G, and S. Let x = number owning all four items = |D ∩ G ∩ S|. From previous analysis, x = 73. Using inclusion-exclusion and the given counts, we find the number owning exactly one item (only candy hearts) is 900 - (number owning 2 + 3 + 4 items) = 900 - (437 + 234 + 73) = 156. So the disjoint subsets are: owning exactly 1 item (only candy hearts): 156, exactly 2 items: 437, exactly 3 items: 234, exactly 4 items: 73.
