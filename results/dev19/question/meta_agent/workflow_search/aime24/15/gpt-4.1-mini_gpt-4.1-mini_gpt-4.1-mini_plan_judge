Question: Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.

proposed answer: Given that every resident owns candy hearts, the problem effectively reduces to analyzing the ownership of the other three items: diamond rings (D), golf clubs (G), and garden spades (S), with candy hearts (C) being universal. The total population is 900. The counts given are: |D|=195, |G|=367, |S|=562, exactly two items owned = 437, exactly three items owned = 234, and all own candy hearts. The 'exactly two' and 'exactly three' counts include candy hearts as one of the items. Owning exactly two items means owning candy hearts plus exactly one of D, G, or S; owning exactly three items means candy hearts plus exactly two of D, G, S; owning all four means candy hearts plus D, G, and S. Let x be the number owning all four items, i.e., |D ∩ G ∩ S|. Using inclusion-exclusion and the given counts, the number owning exactly one item (only candy hearts) is 900 - (437 + 234 + x). From previous analyses and consistency checks, x = 73 satisfies all constraints: the sum of disjoint subsets (only candy hearts: 156, exactly two items: 437, exactly three items: 234, exactly four items: 73) equals 900, and the individual set sizes and exact ownership counts align correctly. Therefore, the final number of residents owning all four items is 73.
