Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent gHSu', content='From the previous sub-task, the fraction obtained for |log2(x^4 y^3 z^2)| is 25/8. To verify that m=25 and n=8 are relatively prime, we check their greatest common divisor (gcd). The prime factors of 25 are 5 and 5, and the prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2. Since they share no common prime factors, gcd(25, 8) = 1, confirming that 25/8 is in reduced form. Therefore, m + n = 25 + 8 = 33.

Given values are a = -7/24, b = -3/8, c = -5/12. Substituting these values: 4a = 4 * (-7/24) = -28/24 = -7/6, 3b = 3 * (-3/8) = -9/8, 2c = 2 * (-5/12) = -10/12 = -5/6.
