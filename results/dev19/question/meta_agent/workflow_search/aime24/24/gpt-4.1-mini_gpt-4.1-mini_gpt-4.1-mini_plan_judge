Question: Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations:
\[\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}\]\[\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}\]\[\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}\]
Then the value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: From the previous sub-task, the fraction obtained for |log2(x^4 y^3 z^2)| is 25/8. To verify that m=25 and n=8 are relatively prime, we check their greatest common divisor (gcd). The prime factors of 25 are 5 and 5, and the prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2. Since they share no common prime factors, gcd(25, 8) = 1, confirming that 25/8 is in reduced form. Therefore, m + n = 25 + 8 = 33. This confirms the fraction is simplified and the sum is correct, consistent with previous results.
