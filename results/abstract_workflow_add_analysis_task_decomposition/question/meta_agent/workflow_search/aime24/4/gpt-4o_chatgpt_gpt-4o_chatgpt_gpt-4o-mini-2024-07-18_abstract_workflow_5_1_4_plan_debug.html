Query: Let $p$ be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $n^4+1$ is divisible by $p^2$. Find the least positive integer $m$ such that $m^4+1$ is divisible by $p^2$.

Query Analysis{&#39;Paraphrase&#39;: &#39;Consider a prime number $p$. We need to find the smallest such prime number for which there exists a positive integer $n$ such that when $n$ is raised to the fourth power and 1 is added to it, the resulting number is divisible by the square of $p$. After identifying this smallest prime number $p$, we then need to find the smallest positive integer $m$ such that when $m$ is raised to the fourth power and 1 is added to it, the resulting number is also divisible by the square of this prime number $p$.&#39;, &#39;Intent&#39;: &#39;The user is trying to solve a mathematical problem that involves finding specific numbers that satisfy given divisibility conditions. They want to identify the smallest prime number and the smallest positive integer that meet these conditions.&#39;, &#39;Assumptions&#39;: &#39;The question assumes that there exists at least one prime number $p$ and one positive integer $n$ such that $n^4 + 1$ is divisible by $p^2$. It also assumes that once such a prime $p$ is found, there exists a positive integer $m$ such that $m^4 + 1$ is divisible by $p^2$.&#39;, &#39;Supporting Information&#39;: &#39;The query involves the expression $n^4 + 1$ and its divisibility by $p^2$, where $p$ is a prime number and $n$ is a positive integer. The task is to find the least prime $p$ and then the least positive integer $m$ such that $m^4 + 1$ is divisible by $p^2$.&#39;}.

### Sub-task 5: Determine the least positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by the square of the prime number p found in subtask_3. 

 ### thinking #3 by Debate Agent ivEM:
Sub-task 3 identified the prime number p as 5, for which there exists a positive integer n such that n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2 = 25. In Sub-task 5, we are tasked with finding the least positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 25. By evaluating m from 1 upwards, we find that for m = 7, m^4 + 1 = 7^4 + 1 = 2402, which is divisible by 25. This makes m = 7 the smallest positive integer satisfying the condition. The detailed checks for each m from 1 to 6 confirm that none of these values satisfy the divisibility by 25, thus confirming m = 7 as the correct answer.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent 6SbN:
The least prime number p for which there exists a positive integer n such that n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2 was found to be 5. Now, we need to find the least positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 25 (which is 5^2). We check values of m starting from 1. For m = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, the expression m^4 + 1 is not divisible by 25. However, for m = 7, 7^4 + 1 = 2402, which is divisible by 25. Therefore, m = 7 is the least positive integer such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 25.

    <pre>The problem requires finding the smallest positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 25, where 25 is the square of the prime number 5 identified in a previous sub-task. By evaluating m from 1 upwards, we calculate m^4 + 1 for each m and check divisibility by 25. For m = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, m^4 + 1 is not divisible by 25. However, for m = 7, we have 7^4 + 1 = 2402, which is divisible by 25. Therefore, m = 7 is the smallest positive integer satisfying the condition. This conclusion is consistent with the evaluations and checks performed, confirming m = 7 as the correct answer.
