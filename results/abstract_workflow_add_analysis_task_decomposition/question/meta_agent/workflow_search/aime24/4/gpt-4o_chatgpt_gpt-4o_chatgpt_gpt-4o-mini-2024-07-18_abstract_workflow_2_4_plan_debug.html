Query: Let $p$ be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $n^4+1$ is divisible by $p^2$. Find the least positive integer $m$ such that $m^4+1$ is divisible by $p^2$.

Query Analysis{&#39;Paraphrase&#39;: &#39;Consider a prime number $p$. We need to find the smallest such prime number for which there exists a positive integer $n$ such that when $n$ is raised to the fourth power and 1 is added to it, the resulting number is divisible by the square of $p$. After identifying this smallest prime number $p$, we then need to find the smallest positive integer $m$ such that when $m$ is raised to the fourth power and 1 is added to it, the resulting number is also divisible by the square of this prime number $p$.&#39;, &#39;Intent&#39;: &#39;The user is trying to solve a mathematical problem that involves finding specific numbers that satisfy given divisibility conditions. They want to identify the smallest prime number and the smallest positive integer that meet these conditions.&#39;, &#39;Assumptions&#39;: &#39;The question assumes that there exists at least one prime number $p$ and one positive integer $n$ such that $n^4 + 1$ is divisible by $p^2$. It also assumes that once such a prime $p$ is found, there exists a positive integer $m$ such that $m^4 + 1$ is divisible by $p^2$.&#39;, &#39;Supporting Information&#39;: &#39;The query involves the expression $n^4 + 1$ and its divisibility by $p^2$, where $p$ is a prime number and $n$ is a positive integer. The task is to find the least prime $p$ and then the least positive integer $m$ such that $m^4 + 1$ is divisible by $p^2$.&#39;}.

### Sub-task 3: Using the prime number p found in subtask 2, identify the condition under which m^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2. 

 ### thinking #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent vKJN:
We have determined that the smallest prime number p for which there exists a positive integer n such that n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2 is p = 5. Now, we need to find the smallest positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 5^2 = 25. This means we need to find m such that m^4 ≡ -1 (mod 25). We already found that for n = 2, 2^4 = 16, and 16 + 1 = 17, which is not divisible by 25. However, for n = 7, 7^4 = 2401, and 2401 + 1 = 2402, which is divisible by 25 because 2402 ≡ 0 (mod 25). Therefore, the smallest positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 25 is m = 7.

7

### Sub-task 4: Determine the smallest positive integer m that satisfies the condition identified in subtask 3. 

 ### thinking #2 by Debate Agent xR9e (yourself):
The task is to find the smallest positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 5^2 = 25. We already established that 5 is the least prime for which there exists a positive integer n such that n^4 + 1 is divisible by 25. The condition translates to finding m such that m^4 ≡ -1 (mod 25). Upon checking several values, we determined that for m = 7, the congruence holds: 7^4 = 2401, and 2401 + 1 = 2402, which satisfies 2402 ≡ 0 (mod 25). Therefore, m = 7 is the smallest integer satisfying the condition.

### thinking #2 by Debate Agent KS7n:
The problem requires us to find the smallest positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 25, given that the smallest prime p for which n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2 is 5. We are dealing with the congruence m^4 ≡ -1 (mod 25). Through calculations, we found that for m = 7, 7^4 = 2401, and 2401 + 1 = 2402, which is divisible by 25 (since 2402 ≡ 0 mod 25). This confirms that m = 7 is the solution.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Determine the smallest positive integer m that satisfies the condition identified in subtask 3.

    <pre>The task is to find the smallest positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 25, given that the smallest prime p for which n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2 is 5. The condition m^4 ≡ -1 (mod 25) needs to be satisfied. By testing small values of m, we find that for m = 7, we have 7^4 = 2401 and 2401 + 1 = 2402, which is divisible by 25 because 2402 ≡ 0 (mod 25). Thus, m = 7 is the smallest integer satisfying the condition.
