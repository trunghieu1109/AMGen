The condition m^4 \u2261 -1 (mod 25) needs to be satisfied. By testing small values of m, we find that for m = 7, we have 7^4 = 2401 and 2401 + 1 = 2402, which is divisible by 25 because 2402 \u2261 0 (mod 25). Thus, m = 7 is the smallest integer satisfying the condition.\n\nAnswer:7",

        "response": "The problem requires finding the smallest positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 25, where 25 is the square of the prime number 5 identified in a previous sub-task. By evaluating m from 1 upwards, we calculate m^4 + 1 for each m and check divisibility by 25. For m = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, m^4 + 1 is not divisible by 25. However, for m = 7, we have 7^4 + 1 = 2402, which is divisible by 25. Therefore, m = 7 is the smallest positive integer satisfying the condition. This conclusion is consistent with the evaluations and checks performed, confirming m = 7 as the correct answer.\n\nAnswer:7",
