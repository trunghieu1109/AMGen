Question: Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?

proposed answer: The problem involves determining the probability that a regular octagon, with vertices independently colored red or blue, can be rotated such that all blue vertices align with positions that were originally red. Using Burnside's Lemma, we calculated that there are 34 valid colorings out of 256 possible colorings. This gives a probability of 34/256. Simplifying this fraction, we find the greatest common divisor of 34 and 256 is 2. Dividing both by 2, the simplest form of the fraction is 17/128. Since 17 and 128 are relatively prime, the simplest form is indeed 17/128. Therefore, the sum of the numerator and denominator in this simplest form is 17 + 128, which is 145. Both agents agree on this calculation, confirming the result.

proposed answer: The probability that the octagon can be rotated such that all blue vertices align with positions that were originally red is calculated by considering the number of favorable configurations of blue vertices. These configurations are determined by the divisors of 8, which are 1, 2, 4, and 8. For each case, we count the number of ways to arrange the blue vertices: 8 ways for 1 blue vertex, 4 ways for 2 blue vertices (opposite pairs), 2 ways for 4 blue vertices (evenly spaced), and 1 way for 8 blue vertices (all blue). This gives a total of 15 favorable configurations. The total number of colorings is 2^8 = 256. Therefore, the probability is 15/256. Since 15 and 256 have no common factors other than 1, the fraction is already in simplest form. Thus, m = 15 and n = 256, and their sum is m + n = 15 + 256 = 271.
