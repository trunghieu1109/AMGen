        "response": "From subtask 3, we determined that x = 5/2 and y = 625/16. To find the product xy, we multiply these two values. The product of two fractions is calculated by multiplying the numerators and the denominators separately. Thus, xy = (5/2) * (625/16) = (5 * 625) / (2 * 16) = 3125 / 32. This calculation is consistent with the relationships derived in subtask 3 and satisfies the conditions given in the original problem. Hence, the product xy is 3125/32.\n\nAnswer:3125/32",

        "response": "The problem involves finding the product xy given the conditions that log_x(y^x) = 10 and log_y(x^4y) = 10, with x and y both greater than 1. From the sub-tasks, it was determined that x = 16 and y = 64 satisfy these conditions. The product xy is then calculated as 16 * 64. This calculation is straightforward and follows directly from the values of x and y that satisfy the given logarithmic equations. Therefore, the product xy is 1024.\n\nAnswer:1024",
