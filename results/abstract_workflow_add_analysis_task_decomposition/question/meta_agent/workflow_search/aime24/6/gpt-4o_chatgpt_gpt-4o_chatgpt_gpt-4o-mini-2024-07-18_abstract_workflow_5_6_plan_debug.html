Query: Let $\mathcalB$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcalB$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\fracpq$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.

Query Analysis1. Paraphrase: Consider a collection of rectangular boxes, each having a surface area of 54 square units and a volume of 23 cubic units. Determine the radius of the smallest sphere that can completely enclose any of these boxes. The square of this radius, denoted as r^2, is expressed as a fraction in its simplest form, where the numerator and denominator are coprime positive integers. Calculate the sum of these two integers.

2. Intent: The user aims to solve a mathematical problem by determining the sum of the numerator and denominator of the fraction representing the square of the radius of the smallest enclosing sphere.

3. Assumptions: The user assumes that the dimensions of the boxes can vary but must satisfy the given surface area and volume conditions. It is also assumed that the sphere is the smallest possible that can enclose any box in the set.

4. Supporting Information: The set of boxes, denoted as \(\mathcal{B}\), has a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. The radius of the smallest enclosing sphere is denoted as \(r\), and \(r^2\) is expressed as \(\frac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are coprime positive integers. The task is to find \(p+q\)..

### Sub-task 5: Based on the output of sub-task 4, express the square of the radius in the form of a fraction with coprime integers and calculate the sum of the numerator and denominator. 

 ### thinking by Debate Agent s6te:
In sub-task 4, the space diagonal of the box was calculated to be \( \sqrt{\frac{73}{3}} \). The radius \( r \) of the sphere that can enclose the box is half of this space diagonal, so \( r = \frac{1}{2} \times \sqrt{\frac{73}{3}} \). Therefore, the square of the radius is \( r^2 = \left(\frac{1}{2} \times \sqrt{\frac{73}{3}}\right)^2 = \frac{73}{12} \). This fraction is already in its simplest form because the numerator 73 and the denominator 12 are coprime (they have no common factors other than 1). Thus, the sum of the numerator and the denominator is \( 73 + 12 = 85 \). The calculations and simplification are correct, and they meet the requirements of the problem statement.

### thinking by Debate Agent Ycuw:
Sub-task 4 has already determined that the radius squared (r^2) of the sphere that encloses the rectangular box is \( \frac{73}{12} \). This fraction is in its simplest form because 73 and 12 are coprime integers; they share no common factors other than 1. Therefore, the sum of the numerator and denominator is calculated as 73 + 12, which equals 85. This aligns with the requirement to find the sum of these coprime integers, confirming the correctness of the result.

    <pre>The problem involves finding the square of the radius of the smallest sphere that can enclose a rectangular box with given surface area and volume. The space diagonal of the box, which is the diameter of the smallest enclosing sphere, was calculated to be \( \sqrt{\frac{73}{3}} \). Therefore, the radius \( r \) is half of this diagonal, \( r = \frac{1}{2} \times \sqrt{\frac{73}{3}} \). Squaring this gives \( r^2 = \left(\frac{1}{2} \times \sqrt{\frac{73}{3}}\right)^2 = \frac{73}{12} \). The fraction \( \frac{73}{12} \) is in its simplest form because 73 and 12 are coprime. Thus, the sum of the numerator and denominator is \( 73 + 12 = 85 \). This confirms that the calculations are correct and the fraction is in its simplest form.
