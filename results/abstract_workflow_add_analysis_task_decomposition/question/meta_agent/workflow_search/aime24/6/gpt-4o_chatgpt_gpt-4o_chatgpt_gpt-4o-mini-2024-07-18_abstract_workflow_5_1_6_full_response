Let the dimensions of the box be x, y, and z. The surface area of a rectangular box is given by the formula 2(xy + yz + zx), and the volume is given by the formula xyz. According to the problem, the surface area is 54 and the volume is 23. Therefore, the constraints on the rectangular boxes are given by the equations: 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 and xyz = 23.
