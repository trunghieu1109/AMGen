Query: Let $\mathcalB$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcalB$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\fracpq$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.

Query Analysis1. Paraphrase: Consider a collection of rectangular boxes, each having a surface area of 54 square units and a volume of 23 cubic units. Determine the radius of the smallest sphere that can completely enclose any of these boxes. The square of this radius, denoted as r^2, is expressed as a fraction in its simplest form, where the numerator and denominator are coprime positive integers. Calculate the sum of these two integers.

2. Intent: The user aims to solve a mathematical problem by determining the sum of the numerator and denominator of the fraction representing the square of the radius of the smallest enclosing sphere.

3. Assumptions: The user assumes that the dimensions of the boxes can vary but must satisfy the given surface area and volume conditions. It is also assumed that the sphere is the smallest possible that can enclose any box in the set.

4. Supporting Information: The set of boxes, denoted as \(\mathcal{B}\), has a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. The radius of the smallest enclosing sphere is denoted as \(r\), and \(r^2\) is expressed as \(\frac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are coprime positive integers. The task is to find \(p+q\)..

### Sub-task 5: Express the square of the radius in the form of a fraction with coprime integers and calculate the sum of these integers. 

 ### thinking #3 by Debate Agent TeZE:
The square of the radius of the smallest sphere that can enclose the rectangular box is given as \( r^2 = \frac{169}{12} \). To ensure this fraction is in its simplest form, we check if the numerator 169 and the denominator 12 are coprime. The number 169 is 13 squared, and 12 is composed of the prime factors 2 and 3. Since 169 and 12 have no common factors other than 1, they are indeed coprime. Thus, \( r^2 = \frac{169}{12} \) is expressed with coprime integers. The problem asks for the sum of these integers, which is 169 + 12 = 181.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent 5JyC:
The square of the radius, r^2, has been determined to be 169/12. To ensure that this fraction is expressed with coprime integers, we must verify that the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator 169 and the denominator 12 is 1. The number 169 is 13^2, indicating it is a perfect square, while 12 is composed of the prime factors 2 and 3. Since these two numbers share no common factors, their GCD is indeed 1, confirming that the fraction is already in its simplest form. The problem requires calculating the sum of these integers, which is 169 + 12. Therefore, the sum is 181. This process confirms that the fraction is correctly expressed in terms of coprime integers, and the calculation of their sum is straightforward.

    <pre>The square of the radius of the smallest sphere that can enclose a rectangular box with given surface area and volume is determined by finding the maximum of the squared half-diagonal of the box. The diagonal of a box with dimensions x, y, and z is given by \( \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2} \). For a box with surface area 54 and volume 23, we have the equations: \( 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 \) and \( xyz = 23 \). Solving these equations, we find that the maximum value of \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \) is 28.25, which gives \( r^2 = \frac{169}{12} \). The numbers 169 and 12 are coprime, so the fraction is in its simplest form. Therefore, the sum of the numerator and denominator is 169 + 12 = 181.
