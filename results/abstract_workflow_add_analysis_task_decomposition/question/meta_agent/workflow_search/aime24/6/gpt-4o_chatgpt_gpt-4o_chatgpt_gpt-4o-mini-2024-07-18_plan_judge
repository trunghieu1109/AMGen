Question: Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.

proposed answer: The square of the radius of the smallest sphere that can enclose a rectangular box with given surface area and volume is determined by finding the maximum of the squared half-diagonal of the box. The diagonal of a box with dimensions x, y, and z is given by \( \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2} \). For a box with surface area 54 and volume 23, we have the equations: \( 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 \) and \( xyz = 23 \). Solving these equations, we find that the maximum value of \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \) is 28.25, which gives \( r^2 = \frac{169}{12} \). The numbers 169 and 12 are coprime, so the fraction is in its simplest form. Therefore, the sum of the numerator and denominator is 169 + 12 = 181.

proposed answer: The problem involves finding the square of the radius of the smallest sphere that can enclose a rectangular box with given surface area and volume. The space diagonal of the box, which is the diameter of the smallest enclosing sphere, was calculated to be \( \sqrt{\frac{73}{3}} \). Therefore, the radius \( r \) is half of this diagonal, \( r = \frac{1}{2} \times \sqrt{\frac{73}{3}} \). Squaring this gives \( r^2 = \left(\frac{1}{2} \times \sqrt{\frac{73}{3}}\right)^2 = \frac{73}{12} \). The fraction \( \frac{73}{12} \) is in its simplest form because 73 and 12 are coprime. Thus, the sum of the numerator and denominator is \( 73 + 12 = 85 \). This confirms that the calculations are correct and the fraction is in its simplest form.
