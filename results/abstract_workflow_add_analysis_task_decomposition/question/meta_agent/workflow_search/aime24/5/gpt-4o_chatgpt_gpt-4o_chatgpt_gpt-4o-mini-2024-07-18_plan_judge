Question: Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.

proposed answer: We have validated the values m = 3, n = 5, and p = 5. To find the sum m + n + p, we simply add these values together. The calculation is straightforward: 3 + 5 + 5 = 13. Therefore, the sum of m, n, and p is 13.

proposed answer: We have determined the integers m, n, and p from the expression for the common distance as m = 41, n = 89, and p = 12. To find the sum m + n + p, we simply add these integers together. The calculation is straightforward: 41 + 89 + 12. This gives us the sum of 142. Therefore, the sum m + n + p is 142.
