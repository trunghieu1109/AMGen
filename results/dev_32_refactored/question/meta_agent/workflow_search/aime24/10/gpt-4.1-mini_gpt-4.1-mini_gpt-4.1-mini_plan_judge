Question: Rectangles $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are drawn such that $D,E,C,F$ are collinear. Also, $A,D,H,G$ all lie on a circle. If $BC=16$,$AB=107$,$FG=17$, and $EF=184$, what is the length of $CE$?

proposed answer: The problem involves two rectangles ABCD and EFGH with given side lengths and conditions: points D, E, C, F are collinear in that order, and points A, D, H, G are concyclic. Assigning a coordinate system with D at the origin (0,0) and line L as the x-axis, we place C at (107,0) since DC = AB = 107. Rectangle ABCD is oriented with AB along the x-axis and BC along the y-axis, so A=(0,16), B=(107,16), C=(107,0), D=(0,0). Rectangle EFGH has EF=184 and FG=17, with E and F on line L, so E=(x_E,0), F=(x_E+184,0), G=(x_E+184,17), H=(x_E,17). The order D, E, C, F implies 0 ≤ x_E ≤ 107 ≤ x_F. The concyclicity of A, D, H, G means these four points lie on the same circle. Using the coordinates, the concyclicity condition translates into an equation involving x_E. Solving this quadratic equation yields two solutions: approximately -36 and 71. The negative solution is discarded because it contradicts the order of points on line L. The positive solution x_E=71 places E between D and C, consistent with the order and rectangle dimensions. Therefore, CE = |107 - 71| = 36. This value satisfies all geometric constraints: the side lengths of both rectangles, the collinearity and order of points D, E, C, F, and the concyclicity of points A, D, H, G. Alternative configurations were considered and ruled out due to contradictions or invalid placements. Hence, the most consistent and valid length for CE is 36.
