Question: Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?
Iteration: Test New Architecture_2
proposed answer: From the previous iterations of Stage 2, Sub-task 1, there are two main candidate answers for the probability fraction: 61/64 and 61/512. The sum m+n for 61/64 is 125, and for 61/512 is 573. The total number of colorings is 256, so the denominator should be a divisor or multiple of 256. 64 is 2^6, 256 is 2^8, and 512 is 2^9. The problem states the total number of colorings is 2^8=256, so the probability denominator should be 256 or a divisor of 256. The fraction 61/64 corresponds to a probability greater than 61/256, which is plausible. The fraction 61/512 is less than 1/4, which seems too small given the counts. The sum of fixed points under rotations is 244, and dividing by 256 gives 61/64, which is a simplified fraction with numerator and denominator coprime. Therefore, the correct simplified fraction is 61/64, and m+n=125.
