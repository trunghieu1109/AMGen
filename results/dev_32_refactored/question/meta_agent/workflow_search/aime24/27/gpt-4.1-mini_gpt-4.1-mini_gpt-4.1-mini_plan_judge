Question: Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.
Iteration: Test New Architecture_27
proposed answer: The divisibility checks involve replacing each digit of the candidate four-digit number N = ABCD with 1, resulting in four new numbers: 1BCD, A1CD, AB1D, and ABC1. Each of these numbers must be divisible by 7. This method directly tests the problem's condition and is both necessary and sufficient for verification. The correctness of these checks has been validated through previous attempts, where failures were due to incorrect candidate selection rather than errors in the divisibility tests themselves. The checking process is straightforward: for each digit position, construct the new number with that digit replaced by 1 and test divisibility by 7. This approach covers all possible cases of digit replacement and ensures completeness. No logical or computational errors have been found in the divisibility checking method. Therefore, the divisibility checks are correctly implemented and require no refinement. The main area for improvement lies in candidate generation, where modular arithmetic constraints derived from the divisibility conditions can be used to reduce the search space and improve efficiency and accuracy. This refinement ensures that the divisibility checks are applied only to promising candidates, maintaining correctness while enhancing performance. Hence, the divisibility checking method should be retained as is, with refinement focused on candidate selection strategies.

Answer:The divisibility checks for each digit replacement with 1 are correctly implemented, necessary, and sufficient. No refinement is needed in the checking method itself. Improvements should focus on candidate generation using modular arithmetic constraints to enhance efficiency and accuracy.
