Question: Define $f(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{4}|$. Find the number of intersections of the graphs of \[y=4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \quad\text{ and }\quad x=4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))).\]
Iteration: Test New Architecture_3
proposed answer: The previous stage concluded that there are 16 valid intersection points between the graphs of the given functions. This conclusion was reached by analyzing the piecewise linear nature of the functions f and g, the periodicity of sine and cosine, and by validating all candidate points through substitution back into the original equations. No extraneous solutions were found, and the result was consistent across multiple stages of analysis. Therefore, the final number of intersections is confidently 16.

Answer:The number of intersections of the graphs is 16.
Extracted answer: The number of intersections of the graphs is 16.
Correct answer: 385
