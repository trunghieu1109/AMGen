Question: Let $\omega\neq 1$ be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\]
is divided by 1000.
Iteration: Test New Architecture_19
proposed answer: The problem asks for the remainder when the product \( \prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k}) \) is divided by 1000, where \( \omega \neq 1 \) is a 13th root of unity. From the previous detailed calculation, this product equals 8321. Taking 8321 modulo 1000 gives 321. This is consistent with the algebraic manipulation involving the resultant of polynomials and the evaluation of complex powers, confirming the correctness of the remainder.
