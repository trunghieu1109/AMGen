Question: Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.

proposed answer: The problem involves finding the greatest real number less than BD^2 for all rhombi inscribed in the given hyperbola with diagonals intersecting at the origin. From the previous detailed analysis, BD^2 was expressed in terms of hyperbolic functions and parameters constrained by the rhombus conditions. The key step was solving the system of equations derived from the equal side lengths and perpendicular diagonals conditions, which led to a minimal BD^2 value of 160. This value is the smallest possible BD^2 for all such rhombi, meaning any number less than BD^2 must be less than or equal to 160. Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD^2 for all such rhombi is 160. This conclusion is consistent with all geometric and algebraic constraints and is the minimal BD^2 achievable under the problem's conditions.
