Question: Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.

proposed answer: The problem involves 900 residents, each owning a bag of candy hearts, and some owning diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades. We are asked to find the number of residents owning all four items. From the problem, we know: - Total residents: 900 - Own diamond rings: 195 - Own golf clubs: 367 - Own garden spades: 562 - Own candy hearts: 900 (all residents) - Own exactly two items: 437 - Own exactly three items: 234 We define variables: x1 = number owning exactly one item, x2 = number owning exactly two items (given as 437), x3 = number owning exactly three items (given as 234), x4 = number owning all four items (unknown). The total number of residents is: x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 = 900 The total number of items owned is: 1*x1 + 2*x2 + 3*x3 + 4*x4 = total items owned. Since each resident owns candy hearts, and the other items are diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades, the total items owned is 900 (candy hearts) + 195 + 367 + 562 = 2024. Substituting the known values: x1 + 437 + 234 + x4 = 900 => x1 + x4 = 229 1*x1 + 2*437 + 3*234 + 4*x4 = 2024 => x1 + 874 + 702 + 4*x4 = 2024 => x1 + 4*x4 = 2024 - 1576 = 448 Subtracting the first equation from the second: (x1 + 4*x4) - (x1 + x4) = 448 - 229 => 3*x4 = 219 => x4 = 73 Then x1 = 229 - 73 = 156. Both x1 and x4 are non-negative and reasonable. This solution satisfies all constraints and is consistent with the problem data. Therefore, the number of residents owning all four items is 73.
