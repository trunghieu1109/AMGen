Question: Alice chooses a set $A$ of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets $B$ of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of $B$ belongs to $A$. Bob's list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A.
Iteration: Test New Architecture_26
proposed answer: The problem requires finding a set A of positive integers such that the total number of finite nonempty sets B of positive integers with max(B) in A equals 2024. From combinatorial reasoning, for each a in A, the number of subsets B with max(B) = a is 2^(a-1). This is because the maximum element a must be included, and the other elements can be any subset of {1, 2, ..., a-1}, which has 2^(a-1) subsets. Since these sets B for different max elements a are disjoint, the total number of such sets B is the sum over a in A of 2^(a-1). Thus, the key equation is sum_{a in A} 2^(a-1) = 2024. Because powers of two are unique and non-overlapping, the set A corresponds exactly to the positions of 1s in the binary representation of 2024, with each element a = position + 1 (positions counted from 0 at the least significant bit). Converting 2024 to binary gives 111111001000. The bits set to 1 are at positions 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. Therefore, A = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11}. Summing 2^(a-1) for these a values equals 2024 exactly, confirming the correctness of the set. The uniqueness of binary representation guarantees no other set A can satisfy the condition. Finally, summing the elements of A: 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 = 60. This confirms the sum of elements of A is 60. All possible cases are considered because any deviation from this set would alter the sum of powers of two, making it impossible to reach exactly 2024. Hence, the candidate set A is correct, consistent with problem constraints, and the sum of its elements is 60.
