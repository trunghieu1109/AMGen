Question: There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\times5$ grid such that: 

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.

proposed answer: The problem is to count the total number of valid maximal chip placement configurations on a 5x5 grid with the following constraints: each cell contains at most one chip; all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same color; and the placement is maximal, meaning no additional chip can be added without violating these conditions. From the validated candidate model (stage_1.subtask_1), each configuration corresponds to assigning each row and column a color from {white, black, empty}, where empty means no chips in that row or column. Let w_r and b_r be the number of white and black rows, and w_c and b_c be the number of white and black columns, respectively. The constraints are w_r + b_r ≤ 5 and w_c + b_c ≤ 5, since there are only 5 rows and 5 columns. Chips are placed exactly at the intersections where the row and column colors match (both white or both black), ensuring uniformity and maximality by filling all such cells. The number of white chips placed is w_r * w_c and black chips is b_r * b_c. Since the maximum product is 5*5=25, the chip count constraints w_r * w_c ≤ 25 and b_r * b_c ≤ 25 are always satisfied and do not further restrict the quadruples. For each quadruple (w_r, b_r, w_c, b_c), the number of ways to assign which rows are white and black is C(5, w_r) * C(5 - w_r, b_r), and similarly for columns C(5, w_c) * C(5 - w_c, b_c). The remaining rows and columns are empty. The total number of configurations is the sum over all valid quadruples of the product of these binomial coefficients: Total = Σ_{w_r=0}^5 Σ_{b_r=0}^{5-w_r} Σ_{w_c=0}^5 Σ_{b_c=0}^{5-w_c} [C(5, w_r) * C(5 - w_r, b_r) * C(5, w_c) * C(5 - w_c, b_c)]. Because the row and column sums factorize, this equals (Σ_{w_r=0}^5 Σ_{b_r=0}^{5-w_r} C(5, w_r) * C(5 - w_r, b_r))^2. For fixed w_r, the inner sum over b_r=0 to 5 - w_r of C(5 - w_r, b_r) equals 2^{5 - w_r} by the binomial theorem. Hence, the sum over rows is Σ_{w_r=0}^5 C(5, w_r) * 2^{5 - w_r} = 2^5 * Σ_{w_r=0}^5 C(5, w_r) * (1/2)^{w_r} = 32 * (1 + 1/2)^5 = 32 * (3/2)^5. Calculating (3/2)^5 = 243/32, so sum_rows = 32 * 243/32 = 243. By symmetry, sum_cols = 243. Therefore, total configurations = 243 * 243 = 59049. This count includes the empty configuration (no chips placed), which is valid. This result is consistent with all previous reasoning and respects uniformity, maximality, and chip availability constraints. Alternative counts like 1024 correspond to simpler models without empty rows or columns and are subsets of this more general model. Hence, the total number of valid maximal chip placement configurations is 59049.
