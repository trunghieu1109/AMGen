Question: Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations:
\[\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}\]\[\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}\]\[\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}\]
Then the value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.
Iteration: Test New Architecture_24
proposed answer: The previous step concluded that the value of |log2(x^4 y^3 z^2)| is 25/8, with 25 and 8 being relatively prime. The problem asks for m + n where m/n = 25/8. Adding these gives 25 + 8 = 33. There are no other interpretations or simplifications needed, and the fraction is already in lowest terms. Therefore, the final answer is 33.
