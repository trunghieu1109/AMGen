Question: Find the largest possible real part of \[(75+117i)z+\frac{96+144i}{z}\]where $z$ is a complex number with $|z|=4$.
Iteration: Test New Architecture_12
proposed answer: The original problem is to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75+117i)z + (96+144i)/z where |z|=4. From previous stages, the expression for the real part was simplified to 540 cos(θ + arctan(4/3)), where θ is the argument of z. This simplification uses the trigonometric identity to combine the cosine and sine terms into a single cosine function with amplitude 540 and phase shift arctan(4/3). The cosine function achieves its maximum value of 1 at arguments equal to integer multiples of 2π. Therefore, the maximum real part occurs when θ + arctan(4/3) = 2kπ for any integer k, or equivalently θ = -arctan(4/3) + 2kπ. Evaluating the real part at these θ values yields 540 * 1 = 540. Since cosine is bounded between -1 and 1, no other θ values can produce a larger real part. The amplitude 540 is the maximum possible value of the real part given the constraint |z|=4. This conclusion is consistent across multiple independent reasonings and is mathematically rigorous. Hence, the largest possible real part of the given expression is 540.
