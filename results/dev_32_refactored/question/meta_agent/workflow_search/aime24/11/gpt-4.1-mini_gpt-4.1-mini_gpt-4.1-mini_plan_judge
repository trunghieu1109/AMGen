Question: Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.
[asy] size(10cm); usepackage("tikz");label("\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(2,0)--(2,3)--(5,3)--(5,8)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}",origin); label("\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(0,3)--(3,3)--(3,5)--(8,5)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}",E); [/asy]

proposed answer: The problem asks for the number of paths from the lower-left corner to the upper-right corner of an 8x8 grid, moving only right or up, with exactly 4 direction changes. Each path consists of 16 moves: 8 rights and 8 ups. A direction change means switching from moving right to moving up or vice versa. Having exactly 4 direction changes means the path is divided into 5 segments alternating between horizontal and vertical moves. There are two cases: starting with a horizontal segment or starting with a vertical segment. For the case starting with horizontal, the horizontal segments are 3 in number and must sum to 8 moves, and the vertical segments are 2 in number and must sum to 8 moves. The number of positive integer solutions for the horizontal segments is C(7,2) = 21, and for the vertical segments is C(7,1) = 7, so total for this case is 21*7=147. By symmetry, the case starting with vertical segments also yields 147 paths. Adding both cases gives 294 paths. This matches the consolidated and validated total number of valid paths from previous computations.
