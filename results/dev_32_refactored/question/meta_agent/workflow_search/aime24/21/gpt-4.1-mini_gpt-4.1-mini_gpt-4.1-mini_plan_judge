Question: Find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon ($12$-gon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The diagram below shows three of those rectangles.

proposed answer: The problem involves counting the number of distinct rectangles inside a regular dodecagon where each rectangle's sides lie on sides or diagonals of the dodecagon. From the previous stage, rectangles are characterized by quadruples {v, v+k, v+k+3, v+3} modulo 12, with v from 0 to 11 and k from 1 to 5. Each such quadruple corresponds to a rectangle, but due to the dodecagon's dihedral symmetry (rotations and reflections), many quadruples represent the same rectangle. The unique rectangles correspond to the equivalence classes under this symmetry group. Since v corresponds to rotation, and the dihedral group has 12 rotations and 12 reflections, the number of unique rectangles is determined by the number of distinct k values, as each k gives a unique rectangle shape. There are 5 possible k values (1 to 5), so there are 5 unique rectangles. This matches the classification and symmetry considerations, ensuring no duplicates and no omissions. Therefore, the total number of distinct rectangles is 5.
