Question: Find the number of triples of nonnegative integers \((a,b,c)\) satisfying \(a + b + c = 300\) and
\begin{equation*}
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.
\end{equation*}
Iteration: Test New Architecture_17
proposed answer: The previous stage (stage_3.subtask_1) concluded that the total number of valid triples (a,b,c) of nonnegative integers satisfying the given conditions is 898. This result was derived by carefully counting all possible triples that satisfy both the sum condition a + b + c = 300 and the equation involving squares and products, then removing duplicates caused by overlaps in counting. The problem requires formatting the final count into the specified output format without additional explanation or calculation. Since the final consolidated count is 898, this is the correct and complete answer to return.

Answer:898
Extracted answer: 898
Correct answer: 601
