Question: Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.

proposed answer: The problem involves finding the smallest radius r of a sphere that can contain all rectangular boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23. The radius squared r^2 is minimized under the constraints xy + yz + zx = 27 and xyz = 23. From the previous stage, three different solutions were considered. The solution by baAi, which assumes x = y, leads to the cubic equation x^3 - 27x + 46 = 0 with root x=2, and z=23/4=5.75. This satisfies the constraints exactly. Calculating r^2 = (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)/4 = (4 + 4 + 33.0625)/4 = 657/64. This fraction is in lowest terms since 657 and 64 share no common factors. The sum p + q = 657 + 64 = 721. Other solutions either do not satisfy the constraints exactly or yield inconsistent results. Therefore, the exact simplified fraction form of r^2 is 657/64, and the final answer p + q = 721.
