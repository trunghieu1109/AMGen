She is well-known for her voice work in various animated series, including the Teen Titans franchise. The most notable spinoff series she has voiced characters in is \'Teen Titans Go!\', where she voices Raven. Other spinoffs like \'Teen Titans\' (the original series) also feature her as Raven. However, \'Teen Titans Go!\' is the most recognized and frequently mentioned spinoff in relation to her voice work. Therefore, the most reliable answer, based on the frequency of mentions and her prominent role, is \'Teen Titans Go!\'.; answer: Teen Titans Go!\n<SEPERATOR>\nReview agent DRtO, reviewing consolidated output, feedback: Upon reviewing the consolidated list of Teen Titans spinoff series, it is important to note that Tara Strong has voiced Raven in both \'Teen Titans\' (the original series) and \'Teen Titans Go!\'. While \'Teen Titans Go!\' is indeed the most recognized spinoff, the original series is also a significant part of her voice work in the franchise. Therefore, for accuracy and completeness, the answer should include both spinoffs to reflect her contributions accurately. The revised solution should state that she has voiced characters in both \'Teen Titans\' and \'Teen Titans Go!\'.; correct: Teen Titans, Teen Titans Go!', iteration_idx=-1)]
