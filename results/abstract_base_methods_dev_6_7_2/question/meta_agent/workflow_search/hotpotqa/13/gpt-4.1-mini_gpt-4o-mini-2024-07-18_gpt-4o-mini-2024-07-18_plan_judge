Question: Lollipop Chainsaw featured Juliet Starling, who was voiced by a Canadian-American actress who has done voice roles for what Teen Titans spinoff series?
Iteration: Test New Architecture_13
proposed answer: Upon reviewing the consolidated list of Teen Titans spinoff series, it is important to note that Tara Strong has voiced Raven in both 'Teen Titans' (the original series) and 'Teen Titans Go!'. While 'Teen Titans Go!' is indeed the most recognized spinoff, the original series is also a significant part of her voice work in the franchise. Therefore, for accuracy and completeness, the answer should include both spinoffs to reflect her contributions accurately. The revised solution should state that she has voiced characters in both 'Teen Titans' and 'Teen Titans Go!'.

Answer:Teen Titans, Teen Titans Go!
Extracted answer: Teen Titans, Teen Titans Go!
