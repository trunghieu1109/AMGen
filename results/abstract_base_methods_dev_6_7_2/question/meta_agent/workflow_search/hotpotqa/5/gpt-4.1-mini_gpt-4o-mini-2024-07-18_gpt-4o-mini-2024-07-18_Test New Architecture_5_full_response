The mention of one being assassinated suggests a historical context where political violence was prevalent. Based on historical events, the Rome Protocols could refer to agreements related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where leaders from Israel and Palestine, as well as possibly a third party, signed agreements aimed at peace. The three Prime Ministers could be Yitzhak Rabin (Israel), Yasser Arafat (Palestine), and possibly Bill Clinton (USA) as a mediator.

This event was a significant turning point in Israeli politics and the peace process, as it highlighted the deep divisions within Israeli society regarding the peace efforts with the Palestinians.
