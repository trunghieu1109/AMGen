The actual protagonist who secretly loves and marries a member of the rival house (the Capulets) is Romeo Montague, who loves Juliet Capulet. The rival houses in this tragedy are the Montagues and the Capulets. Benvolio's role is to try to maintain peace and prevent conflict, and he does not kill anyone throughout the play.

He does not engage in any acts of violence, and therefore the premise that he slays a character is false. The protagonists in the play, Romeo Montague and Juliet Capulet, are from rival houses, and their secret love leads to their tragic fate. The characters who are slain are Mercutio and Tybalt, but these deaths are caused by Romeo, not Benvolio.

He does not slay any characters; rather, he attempts to mediate disputes between the Montagues and Capulets. The premise that Benvolio slays a character is therefore fundamentally flawed, as it contradicts his established role in the play. The protagonist, Romeo Montague, secretly loves and eventually marries Juliet Capulet, who is a member of the rival house. This relationship between the two families is central to the tragedy, highlighting the conflict between love and familial loyalty. Thus, while the premise of Benvolio slaying someone is incorrect, the relationships between the protagonists and their rival houses are accurately depicted in the play.; answer: The premise that Benvolio slays a character is incorrect; the protagonist is Romeo Montague, who loves Juliet Capulet from the rival house.\n<SEPERATOR>\nDebate agent lmPT, round 0, debating premise and protagonists, thinking: The premise that Benvolio slays a character in 'Romeo and Juliet' is incorrect.
