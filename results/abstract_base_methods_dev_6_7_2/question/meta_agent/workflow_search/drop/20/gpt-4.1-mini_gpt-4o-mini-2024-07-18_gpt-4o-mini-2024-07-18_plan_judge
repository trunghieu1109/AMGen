Answer:
Iteration: Test New Architecture_20
proposed answer: The question is asking for the number of years that passed between 1990 and 1999. To determine this, we subtract the earlier year (1990) from the later year (1999). The calculation is straightforward: 1999 - 1990 = 9. This means that there are 9 years in total between 1990 and 1999 that could have affected the annual total of employment. Therefore, the answer is 9.
