Question: Passage: Baltimore managed to beat the Jets 10-9 on the 2010 opener, but then lost a poorly-played game against Cincinnati the following week. The Ravens rebounded against the other two division teams, beating Cleveland 24-17 in Week 3 and then Pittsburgh 17-14 in Week 4. The Ravens scored a fine win (31-17) at home against Denver in Week 5. After an overtime loss to New England, they narrowly avoided losing at home to the winless Bills. Next, the Ravens hosted Miami and won 26-10, breaking that teams 4-0 road streak. On Thursday Night, the team headed to Atlanta and lost 26-21 in a game that had some criticizing the officiating. The Ravens finished the season 12-4, second in the division due to a tiebreaker with Pittsburgh, and earning a wild card spot. Baltimore headed to Kansas City and crushed the unprepared Chiefs 30-7, but once again were knocked from the playoffs by Pittsburgh in a hard-fought battle.
