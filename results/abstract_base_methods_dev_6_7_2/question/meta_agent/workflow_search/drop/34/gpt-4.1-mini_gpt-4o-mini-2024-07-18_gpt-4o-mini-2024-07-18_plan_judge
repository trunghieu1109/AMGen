Question: Passage: Coming off their overtime road win over the Jets, the Redskins went home for an NFC East rematch with the Philadelphia Eagles. In the first quarter, the Redskins trailed early as Eagles quarterback Donovan McNabb completed a 4-yard touchdown pass to running back Brian Westbrook for the only score in the quarter. In the second quarter, the Redskins took the lead when quarterback Jason Campbell hooked up with wide receiver James Thrash on a 4-yard touchdown pass (with a failed PAT) and a 12-yard touchdown pass (with a failed 2-point conversion). In the third quarter, the Redskins increased their lead with kicker Shaun Suisham getting a 23-yard field goal. Philadelphia managed to draw close with McNabb completing an 8-yard touchdown pass to tight end L.J. Smith (with a failed 2-point conversion). In the fourth quarter, the Redskins padded its lead with Campbell completing a 6-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Keenan McCardell, yet the Eagles answered with McNabb's 45-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Reggie Brown. The Redskins tried to pull away as Suisham nailed a 21-yard field goal. However, Philadelphia sealed the win with Westbrook turning a 57-yard reception and a 10-yard run into touchdowns. With the loss, the Redskins fell to 5-4. This would turn out to be Sean Taylor's last game that he would ever play in: He sustained an injury that kept him from playing in the last two games before his death.
Question: How many losses did the Redskins come into this game with?

proposed answer: After reviewing the previous answers and the context of the passage, it is clear that the Redskins had 5 wins and 4 losses after the game. This indicates that they must have had 5 wins and 3 losses before the game. The answer of 3 losses is consistent across the evaluations and is supported by the information provided in the passage. Therefore, the most coherent and consistent final result for the number of losses the Redskins had before the game is 3.
