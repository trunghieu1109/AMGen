Question: Passage: After being higher in the postwar period, the U.S. unemployment rate fell below the rising eurozone unemployment rate in the mid-1980s and has remained significantly lower almost continuously since. In 1955, 55% of Americans worked in services, between 30% and 35% in industry, and between 10% and 15% in Agriculture in the United States. By 1980, over 65% were employed in services, between 25% and 30% in industry, and less than 5% in agriculture. Male unemployment continued to be significantly higher than those of females (at 9.8% vs. 7.5% in 2009). The unemployment among Caucasians continues being much lower than those for African-Americans (at 8.5% vs. 15.8% also in 2009).
Question: Who was more out of work, Caucasians or African-Americans?
Answer:
Iteration: Test New Architecture_48
proposed answer: The passage provides specific unemployment rates for both Caucasians and African-Americans in 2009. It states that the unemployment rate for Caucasians was 8.5% while the unemployment rate for African-Americans was 15.8%. Since 15.8% is significantly higher than 8.5%, it is clear that African-Americans were more out of work compared to Caucasians. This indicates a disparity in employment opportunities and outcomes between these two racial groups during that time period. By reiterating the specific unemployment rates, the answer becomes clearer and emphasizes the significant difference in unemployment between the two groups. Therefore, the answer should explicitly state that African-Americans had a higher unemployment rate, which reflects the disparity in employment status between the two groups.

Answer:In 2009, African-Americans had a higher unemployment rate of 15.8% compared to Caucasians, who had an unemployment rate of 8.5%. This indicates that African-Americans were more out of work than Caucasians.
Extracted answer: In 2009, African-Americans had a higher unemployment rate of 15.8% compared to Caucasians, who had an unemployment rate of 8.5%. This indicates that African-Americans were more out of work than Caucasians.
