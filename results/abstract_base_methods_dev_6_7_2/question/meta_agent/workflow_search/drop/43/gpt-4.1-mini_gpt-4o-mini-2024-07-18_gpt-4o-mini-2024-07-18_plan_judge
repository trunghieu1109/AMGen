Question: Passage: Coming off their Thursday night home win over the Packers, the Cowboys flew to Ford Field for a Week 14 interconference duel with the Detroit Lions.  In the first quarter, Dallas trailed early as Lions RB T.J. Duckett getting a 32-yard TD run, along with kicker Jason Hanson getting a 19-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, the Cowboys got on the board with RB Marion Barber getting a 20-yard TD run.  Detroit would answer with Hanson kicking a 36-yard field goal, while RB Kevin Jones getting a 2-yard TD run.  The Cowboys ended the half with QB Tony Romo completing an 8-yard TD pass to Barber. In the third quarter, the Lions replied with Jones getting a 3-yard TD run for the only score of the period.  In the fourth quarter, Dallas came back and took the lead with Barber getting a 1-yard TD run and Romo completing a 16-yard TD pass to TE Jason Witten. With the win, the Cowboys improved to 12-1 and clinched the NFC East crown for the first time since 1998.
