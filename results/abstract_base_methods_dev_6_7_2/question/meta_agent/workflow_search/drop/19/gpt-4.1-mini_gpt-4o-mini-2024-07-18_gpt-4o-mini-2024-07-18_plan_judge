Answer:
Iteration: Test New Architecture_19
proposed answer: The groups identified in the previous subtasks are 40-49 years (14.4%) and 50-59 years (11.1%). These two groups are the only ones that fall within the range of 10% to 15% of the population. The other groups either fall below 10% or above 15%. Therefore, the most coherent and consistent final result is that the groups with between 10% and 15% of the population are 40-49 years and 50-59 years.
