Question: Passage: Coming off their bye week the Bengals played at Georgia Dome for an interconference duel with the Falcons. In the first quarter the Bengals trailed early as QB Matt Ryan made a 3-yard TD pass to WR Brian Finneran. But they replied with kicker Mike Nugent making a 20-yard field goal. The Bengals struggled in the second quarter with kicker Matt Bryant hitting a 45-yard field goal. Then Ryan found WR Roddy White on a 43-yard TD pass, followed by RB Michael Turner getting a 2-yard TD run. The Bengals took control in the third quarter with Nugent nailing a 33-yard field goal, followed by QB Carson Palmer completing a 19-yard TD pass to WR Terrell Owens. Then Palmer found WR Jordan Shipley on a 64-yard TD pass. Then DB Adam Jones returned a fumble 59 yards to the endzone for a touchdown (With a failed two-point conversion). The Falcons pulled away in the fourth quarter with Ryan making an 11-yard TD pass to White. (With the 2-point conversion successful as Ryan passed to White) This was followed by Turner getting a 3-yard TD run. The Bengals tried to tie the game, but only came away with one touchdown after Palmer found WR Chad Ochocinco on an 8-yard TD pass.

Question: How many yards was the second touchdown?
Answer:
Iteration: Test New Architecture_47
proposed answer: After reviewing the passage and the context of the question regarding the second touchdown, it is clear that the second touchdown scored in the game is the 43-yard TD pass from QB Matt Ryan to WR Roddy White. This is supported by the chronological listing of touchdowns, where the second touchdown overall is explicitly identified as being 43 yards. The question does not specify which team's second touchdown is being referred to, but since it is the second touchdown in the game overall, it is appropriate to conclude that the answer is 43 yards. The analysis has been consistent across multiple evaluations, confirming the accuracy of this identification.
