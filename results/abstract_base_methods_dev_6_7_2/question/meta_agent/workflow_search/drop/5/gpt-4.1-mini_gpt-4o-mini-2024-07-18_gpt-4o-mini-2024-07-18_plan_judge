Question: Passage: For the third straight week, the game got off to an ominous start for the Jets, as Chad Pennington was intercepted by Brian Williams on the Jets' first possession. Byron Leftwich then completed a short pass to Fred Taylor, who turned it into a 32-yard gain. Two plays later, Maurice Jones-Drew scored on a 6-yard touchdown run. After forcing a punt, Jacksonville wasted no time tacking onto their lead, with Leftwich completing passes to Reggie Williams and George Wrighster for long gains. Taylor would then score on a 13-yard touchdown run for a 14-0 Jaguars lead. Early in the second quarter, the Jets attempted a punt, but the Jaguars' Gerald Sensabaugh blocked it, and Jorge Cordova recovered at the Jets' 8-yard line. Three plays later, Jones-Drew scored on a 4-yard touchdown run, surviving a challenge by the Jets. It only snowballed from there, as Pennington was intercepted by Terry Cousin on the next possession, and Leftwich flipped a 1-yard touchdown pass to Wrighster. Jacksonville would add a Josh Scobee 43-yard field goal early in the second half, and after Deon Grant intercepted Pennington, Leftwich threw a 16-yard touchdown pass to Williams for a 38-0 lead. The Jets' lone scoring chance in the second half was stopped when Leon Washington was stuffed on a 4th-and-goal from the Jaguars' 1-yard line early in the fourth quarter. The Jets were stopped on fourth down on their next possession when Pennington's scramble fell a yard short, and Scobee added a 40-yard field goal to close the scoring. On the Jets' final possession, backup rookie quarterback Kellen Clemens made his first appearance under center, but the drive ended badly when he was sacked by Montavious Stanley and Nick Greisen recovered.
Question: How many yards longer was the longest touchdown run than the shortest?
Answer:
Iteration: Test New Architecture_5
proposed answer: The evaluation results from the previous subtasks consistently indicate that the longest touchdown run is 13 yards and the shortest is 6 yards. The calculation of the difference, which is 7 yards, has been confirmed as correct. Since both the reasoning and the final answer have been validated, the most coherent and consistent final answer regarding the yard difference is 7 yards.

Question: How many yards longer was the longest touchdown run than the shortest?
Answer:
Iteration: Test New Architecture_5
proposed answer: I have carefully reviewed the touchdown runs mentioned in the passage. The identified touchdown runs are: a 6-yard run by Maurice Jones-Drew, a 13-yard run by Fred Taylor, and a 4-yard run by Maurice Jones-Drew. This gives us three distinct touchdown runs. The longest run is 13 yards (by Fred Taylor) and the shortest is 4 yards (by Maurice Jones-Drew). The difference between the longest and shortest runs is calculated as 13 - 4 = 9 yards. I have confirmed that all touchdown runs have been captured and the calculations are accurate, ensuring completeness and correctness in the review process.
