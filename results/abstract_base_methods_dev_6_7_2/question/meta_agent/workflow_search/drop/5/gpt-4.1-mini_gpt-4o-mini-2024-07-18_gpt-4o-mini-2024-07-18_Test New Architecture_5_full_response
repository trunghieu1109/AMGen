Question: Passage: For the third straight week, the game got off to an ominous start for the Jets, as Chad Pennington was intercepted by Brian Williams on the Jets' first possession. Byron Leftwich then completed a short pass to Fred Taylor, who turned it into a 32-yard gain. Two plays later, Maurice Jones-Drew scored on a 6-yard touchdown run. After forcing a punt, Jacksonville wasted no time tacking onto their lead, with Leftwich completing passes to Reggie Williams and George Wrighster for long gains. Taylor would then score on a 13-yard touchdown run for a 14-0 Jaguars lead. Early in the second quarter, the Jets attempted a punt, but the Jaguars' Gerald Sensabaugh blocked it, and Jorge Cordova recovered at the Jets' 8-yard line. Three plays later, Jones-Drew scored on a 4-yard touchdown run, surviving a challenge by the Jets. It only snowballed from there, as Pennington was intercepted by Terry Cousin on the next possession, and Leftwich flipped a 1-yard touchdown pass to Wrighster. Jacksonville would add a Josh Scobee 43-yard field goal early in the second half, and after Deon Grant intercepted Pennington, Leftwich threw a 16-yard touchdown pass to Williams for a 38-0 lead. The Jets' lone scoring chance in the second half was stopped when Leon Washington was stuffed on a 4th-and-goal from the Jaguars' 1-yard line early in the fourth quarter. The Jets were stopped on fourth down on their next possession when Pennington's scramble fell a yard short, and Scobee added a 40-yard field goal to close the scoring. On the Jets' final possession, backup rookie quarterback Kellen Clemens made his first appearance under center, but the drive ended badly when he was sacked by Montavious Stanley and Nick Greisen recovered.

The longest touchdown run is 13 yards and the shortest is 6 yards. To find out how many yards longer the longest touchdown run is than the shortest, we subtract the shortest from the longest: 13 - 6 = 7. Therefore, the longest touchdown run is 7 yards longer than the shortest.\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent 6Kdy:\n7\n\n### Subtask 5: Evaluate the correctness and reliability of the calculated yard difference between the longest and shortest touchdown runs by reviewing the reasoning and final answer.\nUse critical thinking (questioning) to review the solution\'s correctness and provide a review result in boolean forma. If you are more than 95 percent confident that the final answer is incorrect, please return False and give a feedback for the error. Otherwise, please return True and give a explanation for the correctness. Return the results in JSON format, include `feedback` and `correct` fields. \n\n ### feedback by Review Agent 7755:\nThe reasoning correctly identifies the longest touchdown run as 13 yards and the shortest as 6 yards. The calculation of the difference (13 - 6 = 7) is accurate. Therefore, the final answer is correct.\n\n### correct by Review Agent 7755:\nTrue\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Subtask 6: Aggregate the evaluation results and select the most coherent and consistent final answer regarding the yard difference between the longest and shortest touchdown runs.\nCarefully evaluate these solutions and identify the answer that appears most frequently across them.
