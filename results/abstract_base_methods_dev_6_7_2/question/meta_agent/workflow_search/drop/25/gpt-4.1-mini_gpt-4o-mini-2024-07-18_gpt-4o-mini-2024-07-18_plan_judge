Question: Passage: On October 8, the Chiefs traveled to Glendale, Arizona for their first game in the University of Phoenix Stadium to face the Arizona Cardinals.  Trent Green was still recovering from his concussion, and Arizona's rookie quarterback Matt Leinart made his career start.  The game was broadcast on CBS 1:15pm Arizona time. The game began with Arizona's offense dominating and catching the Chiefs' defense off-guard with a 49-yard touchdown pass to Wide receiver Anquan Boldin, putting the Cardinals on the scoreboard within three minutes of the game. On the opening kickoff, Dante Hall was injured and left the game,  leaving rookie Jeff Webb to return the kicks for the rest of the game, including a 56-yard punt return.  Samie Parker caught a 15-yard touchdown pass, leaving the Chiefs within three points of the Cardinals (17-20).  The play was officially reviewed as the referees initially thought Parker caught the ball out of bounds, but the referees decided it was caught in the endzone. Damon Huard threw Larry Johnson a 78-yard screen pass that would be stopped short of a touchdown when Antrel Rolle twisted Johnson's neck by grabbing his facemask, sending him to the turf motionless for 2&#160;minutes.  Johnson recovered and received a standing ovation.  The NFL fined Rolle $12,500 for his penalty.  It was the second time in the 2006 season in which Rolle had been fined for an illegal tackle.  The play set up Lawrence Tynes' eventual game-winning field goal, leaving the Chiefs with the 23-20 lead. Neil Rackers set up for a kick with less than 15&#160;seconds to play in order to send the 23-20 contest into overtime.  Rackers missed the uprights by a foot with seconds left in the game.
Question: How many yards was the longest touchdown pass?
Answer:
Iteration: Test New Architecture_25
proposed answer: In the passage, there are two touchdown passes mentioned: a 49-yard touchdown pass to Anquan Boldin and a 15-yard touchdown pass caught by Samie Parker. To determine the longest touchdown pass, we compare the two distances. The 49-yard pass is longer than the 15-yard pass. Therefore, the longest touchdown pass is the one to Anquan Boldin, which is 49 yards. This conclusion is consistent with the information provided in the passage.
