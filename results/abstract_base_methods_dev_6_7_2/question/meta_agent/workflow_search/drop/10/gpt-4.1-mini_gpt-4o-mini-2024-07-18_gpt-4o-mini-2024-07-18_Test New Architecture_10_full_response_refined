Question: Passage: Hoping to rebound from their road loss to the Bills, the Chargers flew to Wembley Stadium for the 2008 International Series game with the New Orleans Saints. In the first quarter, San Diego trailed early as kicker Taylor Mehlhaff got a 23-yard field goal.  The 'Bolts would respond with kicker Nate Kaeding getting a 33-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, New Orleans regained the lead as QB Drew Brees (a former Charger) completed a 12-yard TD pass to WR Devery Henderson (with a failed PAT) and RB Deuce McAllister getting a 1-yard TD run.  San Diego answered as QB Philip Rivers completed a 12-yard TD pass to RB LaDainian Tomlinson, but the Saints replied with Brees completing a 30-yard TD pass to WR Lance Moore.  The Chargers closed out the half with Rivers completing a 12-yard TD pass to TE Antonio Gates. In the third quarter, New Orleans increased its lead Brees completing a 1-yard TD pass to TE Mark Campbell, after a very controversial Pass interference call on cornerback Cletis Gordon put the Saints on the 1-yard line.  The 'Bolts would answer with Kaeding getting a 24-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, the Saints continued to build its lead as FB Mike Karney got a 1-yard TD run.  San Diego tried to rally as Kaeding nailed a 31-yard field goal, Rivers completed a 14-yard TD pass to WR Vincent Jackson, and Brees giving the 'Bolts a safety via an incomplete pass thrown into the back of his own endzone.  However, New Orleans' defense stiffened for the win. With the loss, the Chargers went into their bye week at 3-5.
