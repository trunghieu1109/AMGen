Question: Passage: Hoping to rebound from their blowout road loss to the Jaguars, the Colts went home for a Monday Night Football matchup with the Cincinnati Bengals. In the first quarter, Indianapolis struck first with K Adam Vinatieri nailing a 30-yard field goal. The Bengals would respond with K Shayne Graham converting a 27-yard field goal. In the second quarter, the Colts began their breakout with QB Peyton Manning completing a 4-yard touchdown pass to WR Marvin Harrison. Harrison would end up catching three touchdown passes in this game. Even though Cincinnati responded with 12-yard touchdown run by RB Rudi Johnson, Indianapolis responded with Manning completing a 3-yard touchdown pass to Harrison. In the third quarter, the Bengals converted another field goal, and the Colts continued their power with Manning completing another touchdown pass to Marvin Harrison. Afterwards, Manning would complete another touchdown pass, this one an 18-yarder to WR Reggie Wayne. In the fourth quarter, the Bengals' only response was another field goal. After that last field goal by Shayne Graham, Adam Vinatieri responded with a 44-yard field goal to close out the game. With the win, the Colts improved to 11-3. Colts QB Peyton Manning finished the game 29 of 36 for 282 yards with four touchdowns and no interceptions, while Bengals QB Carson Palmer was 14 of 28 for 176 passing yards. Palmer also fumbled the football four times in this game. Colts DE Dwight Freeney forced three fumbles in the game and also had three sacks on Carson Palmer.
Question: How many passes did Peyton Manning throw?
Answer:
Iteration: Test New Architecture_21
proposed answer: The most coherent and consistent final result for the number of passes Peyton Manning threw is 29. This is supported by the passage, which explicitly states that Manning finished the game with 29 completions out of 36 attempts. Since this number is confirmed by multiple evaluations and is the only number provided in the context, it is the most reliable solution.

Answer:29
Extracted answer: 29
Correct answer:  36

Answer:
Iteration: Test New Architecture_21
proposed answer: After analyzing the passage, it is clear that Peyton Manning completed 29 passes out of 36 attempts. The question specifically asks for the total number of passes thrown, which refers to the attempts, not just the completions. Therefore, since he attempted 36 passes, that is the number I should provide as the answer. This conclusion is consistent across multiple reasoning paths derived from the information given in the passage.
