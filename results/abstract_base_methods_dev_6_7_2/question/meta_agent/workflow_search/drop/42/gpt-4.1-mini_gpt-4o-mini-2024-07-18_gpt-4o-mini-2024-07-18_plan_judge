Question: Passage: Skopje, as the Republic of Macedonia as a whole, is characterised by a large ethnic diversity. The city is located in a region where Ethnic Albanians and Macedonians meet, and it welcomed Romani, Turks, Jews and Serbs throughout its history. Skopje was mainly a Muslim city until the 19th century, when large numbers of Christians started to settle there. According to the 2002 census, Macedonians were the largest ethnic group in Skopje, with 338,358 inhabitants, or 66.75% of the population. Then came Albanians with 103,891 inhabitants (20.49%), Roma people with 23,475 (4.63%), Serbs (14,298 inhabitants), Turks (8,595), Bosniaks (7,585) and Vlachs (2,557). 8,167 people did not belong to any of these groups.

Iteration: Test New Architecture_42
proposed answer: To determine which group is smaller between Macedonians and Albanians, we analyze the census data provided in the passage. The census indicates that there are 338,358 Macedonians, which is 66.75% of the population, while there are 103,891 Albanians, making up 20.49% of the population. Clearly, 338,358 is much larger than 103,891, indicating that the Albanian group is smaller than the Macedonian group. This conclusion is supported by multiple reasoning outputs that consistently identify Albanians as the smaller group.
