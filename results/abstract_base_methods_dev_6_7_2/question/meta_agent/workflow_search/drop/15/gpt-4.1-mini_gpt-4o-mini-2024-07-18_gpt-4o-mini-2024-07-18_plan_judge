In the second half, it was all Eagles, as in the third quarter, kicker David Akers got a 40-yard field goal, while McNabb and WR Greg Lewis connected on two touchdown passes of 45 and 30 yards.  In the fourth quarter, the Philly offense wrapped things up as McNabb got a 15-yard TD run, while the defense ended the game on a goal-line stand.  With their victory, the Eagles managed to get their first home win of the season as the team improved to 3-1.

Iteration: Test New Architecture_15
proposed answer: The review feedback confirms that the longest touchdown pass was correctly identified as 45 yards. The passage explicitly states that McNabb and Lewis connected on two touchdown passes, one being 45 yards and the other 30 yards. Since 45 yards is greater than 30 yards, it is indeed the longest touchdown pass in the game. The consistency in the evaluations and the confirmation from the review agent further solidify the correctness of this answer.
