Question: Passage: Like most other European countries, Hungary is experiencing sub-replacement fertility; its estimated total fertility rate of 1.43 is well below the replacement rate of 2.1, albeit higher than its nadir of 1.28 in 1999. As a result, its population has gradually declining and rapidly aging. In 2011, the conservative government began a program to increase the birth rate with a focus on ethnic Magyars by reinstating 3 year maternity leave as well as boosting part-time jobs. The birth rate has gradually increased from 1.27 children born/woman in 2011. The natural decrease in the first 10 months of 2016 was only 25,828 which was 8,162 less than the corresponding period in 2015. In 2015, 47.9% of births were to unmarried women. Life expectancy was 71.96 years for men and 79.62 years for women in 2015, growing continuously since the End of Communism in Hungary (1989).

Ensure the final answer is concisely and clearly, direct response to the question without including explanations or reasoning \n\n ### thinking by Answer Generate Agent jmxH:\nThe current fertility rate in Hungary is 1.43, and the fertility rate in 1999 was 1.28. To find out how many points lower the fertility rate was in 1999 compared to now, we subtract the 1999 rate from the current rate: 1.43 - 1.28 = 0.15. This calculation shows that the fertility rate in 1999 was 0.15 points lower than it is currently.\n\n### answer by Answer Generate Agent jmxH:\n0.15\n\n### Subtask 3: Evaluate the calculated difference against correctness and reliability criteria to ensure the answer is accurate and well-supported.\nUse critical thinking (questioning) to review the solution\'s correctness and provide a review result in boolean forma. If you are more than 95 percent confident that the final answer is incorrect, please return False and give a feedback for the error. Otherwise, please return True and give a explanation for the correctness. Return the results in JSON format, include `feedback` and `correct` fields. \n\n ### feedback by Review Agent HLZD:\nThe calculated difference of 0.15 points is accurate based on the provided fertility rates for 1999 and the current rate. The calculation is straightforward and follows the correct mathematical procedure.\n\n### correct by Review Agent HLZD:\nTrue\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Subtask 4: Aggregate the validated outputs and select the most coherent and consistent final result to answer the question.\nCarefully evaluate these solutions and identify the answer that appears most frequently across them.
