Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Aggregate Agent X1iG', content='To determine how many more people were of German ancestry than those from the US or Danish ancestry, we first need to extract the percentages from the passage. The passage states that 33.7% of the population were of German ancestry, 8.8% were from the US, and 5.4% were of Danish ancestry. We can sum the percentages of the US and Danish ancestry: 8.8% + 5.4% = 14.2%. Now, we find the difference between the German percentage and the combined percentage of US and Danish: 33.7% - 14.2% = 19.5%. To find the actual number of people, we apply this percentage to the total population of 7,791. The calculation is as follows: (19.5 / 100) * 7791 = 1521.

The total population is 7,791. The percentage of people of German ancestry is 33.7%, so we calculate the number of Germans as follows: 33.7% of 7,791 is approximately 2,628. The percentage of people from the US is 8.8%, which gives us 8.8% of 7,791, approximately 686. The percentage of people of Danish ancestry is 5.4%, which gives us 5.4% of 7,791, approximately 421. Now, we add the number of people from the US and Danish ancestry together: 686 + 421 = 1,107. Finally, we subtract the total number of people from the US and Danish ancestry from the number of Germans: 2,628 - 1,107 = 1,521.
