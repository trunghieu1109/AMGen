Question: Passage: As of the census of 2000, there were 19,234 people, 7,473 households, and 4,954 families residing in the village. The population density was 10,337.3 people per square mile (3,992.6/km²). There were 7,650 housing units at an average density of 4,111.5/sq mi (1,588.0/km²). The racial makeup of the village was 82.39% White (U.S. Census), 1.03% African American (U.S. Census), 0.29% Native American (U.S. Census), 4.52% Asian (U.S. Census), 0.04% Pacific Islander (U.S. Census), 3.93% from Race (United States Census), and 3.79% from two or more races. 13.03% of the population is Hispanic (U.S. Census) or Latino (U.S. Census) of any race.
