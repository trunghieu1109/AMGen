Question: Jen got 3 fish.  They each need $1 worth of food a day.  How much does she spend on food in the month of May?
Iteration: Test New Architecture_17
proposed answer: The total monthly food cost for Jen's fish is calculated by multiplying the total daily food cost by the number of days in May. Jen has 3 fish, and each fish requires $1 worth of food per day, resulting in a total daily cost of $3. Since May has 31 days, the total monthly cost is calculated as 3 (daily cost) * 31 (days in May) = 93. This calculation is accurate and complete, as it correctly accounts for both the number of fish and the duration of the month.
