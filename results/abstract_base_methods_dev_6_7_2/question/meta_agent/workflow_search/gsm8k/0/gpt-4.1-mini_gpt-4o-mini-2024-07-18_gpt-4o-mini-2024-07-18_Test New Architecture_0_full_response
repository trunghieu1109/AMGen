Question: Carol and Jennifer are sisters from Los Angeles who love collecting signatures from celebrities. During their summer break from school, the sisters spend every afternoon collecting signatures. After five weeks, Carol and Jennifer compare their autograph books, counting up the number of signatures each sister has collected. Carol has 20 signatures in her book, and Jennifer has 44. The sisters have three more weeks of summer vacation, and they decide they want to reach 100 signatures between them by the end of the summer. How many signatures do the sisters need to collect to reach their goal?

Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Revise Agent Kj36', content='To determine how many signatures Carol and Jennifer need to collect to reach their goal of 100 signatures, we first calculate the total number of signatures they currently have. Carol has 20 signatures and Jennifer has 44 signatures, which gives us a total of 20 + 44 = 64 signatures. Their goal is to have 100 signatures, so we need to find out how many more signatures they need. We do this by subtracting the total signatures they currently have from their goal: 100 - 64 = 36 signatures. This calculation is accurate and confirms that they need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal of 100 signatures by the end of the summer.\n\nAnswer:36', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.

Carol has 20 signatures and Jennifer has 44 signatures, which totals to 20 + 44 = 64 signatures. They want to reach 100 signatures, so we subtract the total they currently have from their goal: 100 - 64 = 36 signatures. Therefore, they need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal. This calculation is straightforward and consistent across various evaluations.; answer: 36\n<SEPERATOR>\nReview agent Kj36, validating consolidated output, feedback: To determine how many signatures Carol and Jennifer need to collect to reach their goal of 100 signatures, we first calculate the total number of signatures they currently have. Carol has 20 signatures and Jennifer has 44 signatures, which gives us a total of 20 + 44 = 64 signatures. Their goal is to have 100 signatures, so we need to find out how many more signatures they need. We do this by subtracting the total signatures they currently have from their goal: 100 - 64 = 36 signatures. This calculation is accurate and confirms that they need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal of 100 signatures by the end of the summer.; correct: 36', iteration_idx=-1)]
