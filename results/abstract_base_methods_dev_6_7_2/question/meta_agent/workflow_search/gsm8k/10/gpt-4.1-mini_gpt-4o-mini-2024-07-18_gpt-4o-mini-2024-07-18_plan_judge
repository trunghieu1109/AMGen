Question: Sara wants to buy herself a new jacket and 2 pairs of shoes. The jacket she wants costs $30 and each pair of shoes cost $20. Sara babysits the neighbor's kids 4 times, earning $5 each time she babysits them. Her parents pay her $4 each time she mows the lawn. If Sara already had $10 saved before she started babysitting, how many times must she mow the lawn before she can afford the jacket and shoes?
Iteration: Test New Architecture_10
proposed answer: To validate the correctness of the calculated number of times Sara must mow the lawn, we need to review the previous calculations. The total cost of the jacket and shoes is $70. Sara has $30 after babysitting and her initial savings. Therefore, she needs an additional $40 to afford the jacket and shoes. Since she earns $4 for each lawn mowing session, the number of times she must mow the lawn to earn the remaining $40 is calculated as $40 / $4 = 10. The subtask question incorrectly states the count as 0, which is not accurate based on the calculations. Thus, the correct number of times Sara must mow the lawn is indeed 10.
