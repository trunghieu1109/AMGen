Question: Richard lives in an apartment building with 15 floors. Each floor contains 8 units, and 3/4 of the building is occupied. What's the total number of unoccupied units In the building?
Iteration: Test New Architecture_3
proposed answer: To determine the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we first calculate the total number of units. The building has 15 floors, and each floor contains 8 units, leading to a total of 15 * 8 = 120 units. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, this means that 1/4 of the building is unoccupied. Therefore, the number of unoccupied units is calculated as 120 * (1/4) = 30 units. This calculation is consistent and confirms that the total number of unoccupied units in the building is indeed 30. The previous solution provided is accurate and complete, and thus I validate it as correct.
