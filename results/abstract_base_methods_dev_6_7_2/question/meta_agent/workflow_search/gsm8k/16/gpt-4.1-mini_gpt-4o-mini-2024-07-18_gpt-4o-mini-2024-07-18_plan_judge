Question: Joelle has 5 orchids and 4 African daisies on her balcony.  If the orchids have 5 petals and daisies have 10 petals, how many more petals do the daisies have compared to the orchids?
Iteration: Test New Architecture_16
proposed answer: To determine how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we first calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower. Joelle has 5 orchids, each with 5 petals, resulting in a total of 5 * 5 = 25 petals for the orchids. She also has 4 African daisies, each with 10 petals, leading to a total of 4 * 10 = 40 petals for the daisies. The difference in total petals is then calculated by subtracting the total petals of the orchids from the total petals of the daisies: 40 petals (daisies) - 25 petals (orchids) = 15 petals. This calculation is confirmed to be correct and consistent across the previous evaluations, indicating that the daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids.

Answer:15 petals
Extracted answer: 15 petals
Correct answer: 15
