Question: An ice cream truck is traveling through a neighborhood. Children from various homes have started chasing the truck and, by the time the truck has reached the end of the first street, there are 5 children it. On the second street, each child is joined by another child and on the third street, each child in the existing group is joined by another 2 children. The original 5 children then give up and leave the group. How many children are now following the truck?

Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Revise Agent 9U4m', content="Let's analyze the problem step by step. Initially, there are 5 children following the truck. On the second street, each of the 5 children is joined by another child, so now there are 5 + 5 = 10 children. On the third street, each of these 10 children is joined by 2 more children, resulting in 10 + (10 * 2) = 10 + 20 = 30 children. Finally, the original 5 children give up and leave the group, so we subtract these 5 from the total. Therefore, the final number of children following the truck is 30 - 5 = 25.
