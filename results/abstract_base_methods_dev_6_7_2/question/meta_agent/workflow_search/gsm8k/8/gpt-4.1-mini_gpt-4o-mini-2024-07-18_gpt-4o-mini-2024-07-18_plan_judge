Question: Vincent can buy flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50 or in packages of 2 for $1. How much money does he save by buying 18 flowers at the better price?
Iteration: Test New Architecture_8
proposed answer: In Sub-task 4, we determined that buying 18 flowers in packages of size 2 costs $9.00, while buying them in packages of size 3 costs $15.00. The difference in cost between the two options is $15.00 - $9.00 = $6.00. Therefore, by choosing the cheaper option of buying packages of size 2, Vincent saves $6.00.

Answer:$6.00
Extracted answer: $6.00
Correct answer: 6
