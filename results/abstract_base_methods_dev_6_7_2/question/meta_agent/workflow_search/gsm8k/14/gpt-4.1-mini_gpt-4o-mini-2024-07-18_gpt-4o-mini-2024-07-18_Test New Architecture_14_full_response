Question: The Hortex company produces bottled carrot juices. Every day it can produce 4200 bottles of these juices. Each juice can cover 20% of 1 person'ts daily energy demand. How many more bottles of juices would Hortex have to produce to be able to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people?

Each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand, so to cover 100% for one person, we need 5 bottles. Therefore, for 2300 people, we need 2300 * 5 = 11500 bottles.

Since each bottle of juice covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand, we can calculate the total number of bottles needed for 2300 people to cover 100% of their energy needs. Each person needs 5 bottles to meet their daily energy demand (since 100% / 20% = 5). Therefore, for 2300 people, the total number of bottles required is 2300 people * 5 bottles/person = 11500 bottles. This represents the total daily energy demand for 2300 people in terms of bottles of juice.; answer - 11500\n<SEPERATOR>\nSubtask 2 output: thinking - To calculate the total daily energy provided by the current production of 4200 bottles, we need to determine how many people can be satisfied with these bottles. Each bottle covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand. Therefore, to find out how many people can be covered by 4200 bottles, we can calculate the total percentage of energy coverage provided by these bottles. Since each bottle covers 20%, 4200 bottles cover 4200 * 20% = 840 people (because 4200 bottles / 5 bottles per person = 840 people). Thus, the total daily energy provided by the current production of 4200 bottles is equivalent to the energy needs of 840 people.; answer - 840\n<SEPERATOR>\nSubtask 3 output: thinking - To determine the deficit in energy coverage, we first need to find out how many bottles are required to satisfy the daily energy needs of 2300 people, which we calculated in Subtask 1 to be 11500 bottles. Currently, Hortex produces 4200 bottles, which can satisfy the energy needs of 840 people as calculated in Subtask 2. The deficit in the number of bottles needed is therefore 11500 bottles (needed) - 4200 bottles (currently produced) = 7300 bottles.
