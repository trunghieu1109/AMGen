Question: The Hortex company produces bottled carrot juices. Every day it can produce 4200 bottles of these juices. Each juice can cover 20% of 1 person'ts daily energy demand. How many more bottles of juices would Hortex have to produce to be able to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people?
Iteration: Test New Architecture_14
proposed answer: To satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to determine how many bottles are required. Each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand, so to cover 100% for one person, we need 5 bottles. Therefore, for 2300 people, we need 2300 * 5 = 11500 bottles. Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day. The additional bottles required would be 11500 - 4200 = 7300 bottles.

Answer:7300
Extracted answer: 7300
