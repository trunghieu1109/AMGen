Question: Jillian's handbag cost $20 less than 3 times as much as her shoes cost. If her shoes cost $80, how much did her bag cost?
Iteration: Test New Architecture_12
proposed answer: To determine the correct cost of Jillian's handbag, we need to follow the problem's instructions carefully. The shoes cost $80. The handbag is said to cost $20 less than 3 times the cost of the shoes. First, we calculate 3 times the cost of the shoes: 3 * $80 = $240. Then, we subtract $20 from this amount: $240 - $20 = $220. Therefore, the correct calculation shows that the handbag costs $220. The previous review stating the solution was incorrect does not align with the calculations based on the problem's parameters. Hence, the correct and accurate cost of the handbag is indeed $220.
