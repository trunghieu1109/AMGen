The formula for the handbag cost is stated as 'handbag cost = 3 times shoe cost minus 20'. Substituting the value of the shoes into the formula, we calculate: handbag cost = 3 * 80 - 20. This simplifies to handbag cost = 240 - 20, which equals 220. Therefore, the handbag costs $220.; answer - The handbag costs $220.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - To refine the calculation of the handbag cost based on the previous output, we will again use the formula provided: handbag cost = 3 times shoe cost minus 20. The cost of the shoes is given as $80. Substituting this into the formula, we have: handbag cost = 3 * 80 - 20. Performing the multiplication first, we get 240, and then subtracting 20 gives us 220. This confirms the previous calculation is correct and consistent. Therefore, the handbag costs $220.; answer - The handbag costs $220.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - To find the cost of Jillian's handbag, we start with the given cost of her shoes, which is $80. According to the problem, the handbag cost is $20 less than 3 times the cost of the shoes. We can calculate this as follows: First, we find 3 times the shoe cost, which is 3 * $80 = $240.
