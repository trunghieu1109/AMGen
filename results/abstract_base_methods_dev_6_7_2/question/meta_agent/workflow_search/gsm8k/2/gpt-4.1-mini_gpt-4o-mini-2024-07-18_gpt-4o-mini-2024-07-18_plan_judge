Iteration: Test New Architecture_2
proposed answer: To ensure the accuracy of the calculated cost difference, we need to verify the individual costs for repaving both streets. The cost to repave Monica's street is calculated as 194 dollars per meter multiplied by 150 meters, which equals 29100 dollars. For Lewis' street, the cost is 194 dollars per meter multiplied by 490 meters, resulting in 95060 dollars. The difference in cost is then calculated by subtracting the cost of Monica's street from the cost of Lewis' street: 95060 - 29100 equals 65960 dollars. This calculation is correct and consistent with the provided data, confirming that it costs 65960 dollars more to repave Lewis' street than Monica's street.
