Question: Jerry is rolling a six-sided die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row?
Iteration: Test New Architecture_11
proposed answer: The validated results from the previous subtasks consistently indicate that the percentage difference in likelihood between rolling a number greater than 3 and rolling two even numbers in a row is 25%. This percentage is derived from the probabilities calculated in the earlier subtasks, where rolling a number greater than 3 has a probability of 50% (rolling a 4, 5, or 6) and rolling two even numbers in a row has a probability of 25% (rolling a 2, 4, or 6 twice). The difference in likelihood is therefore 50% - 25% = 25%. Since the results are consistent across multiple evaluations, I conclude that the final answer is 25%.
