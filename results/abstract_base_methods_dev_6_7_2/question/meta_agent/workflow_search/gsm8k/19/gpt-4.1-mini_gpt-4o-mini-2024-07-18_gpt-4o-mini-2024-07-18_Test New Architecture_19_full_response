Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Revise Agent Mck8', content='To confirm the calculated remaining cents, we first need to ensure that the total amount of money Kelly has is correct. Kelly has 5 quarters and 2 dimes. Each quarter is worth 25 cents, so 5 quarters amount to 5 * 25 = 125 cents. Each dime is worth 10 cents, so 2 dimes amount to 2 * 10 = 20 cents. Adding these together gives us a total of 125 + 20 = 145 cents. The cost of the can of pop is 55 cents. Subtracting this from her total money gives us 145 - 55 = 90 cents. Since 90 cents is non-negative, the calculation is correct. Therefore, Kelly will have 90 cents left after her purchase.\n\nAnswer:90 cents', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
