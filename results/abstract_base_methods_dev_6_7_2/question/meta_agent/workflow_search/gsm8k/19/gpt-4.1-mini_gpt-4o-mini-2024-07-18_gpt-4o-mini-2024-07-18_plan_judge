Question: Kelly has 5 quarters and 2 dimes. If she buys a can of pop for 55 cents, how many cents will she have left?
Iteration: Test New Architecture_19
proposed answer: To confirm the calculated remaining cents, we first need to ensure that the total amount of money Kelly has is correct. Kelly has 5 quarters and 2 dimes. Each quarter is worth 25 cents, so 5 quarters amount to 5 * 25 = 125 cents. Each dime is worth 10 cents, so 2 dimes amount to 2 * 10 = 20 cents. Adding these together gives us a total of 125 + 20 = 145 cents. The cost of the can of pop is 55 cents. Subtracting this from her total money gives us 145 - 55 = 90 cents. Since 90 cents is non-negative, the calculation is correct. Therefore, Kelly will have 90 cents left after her purchase.
