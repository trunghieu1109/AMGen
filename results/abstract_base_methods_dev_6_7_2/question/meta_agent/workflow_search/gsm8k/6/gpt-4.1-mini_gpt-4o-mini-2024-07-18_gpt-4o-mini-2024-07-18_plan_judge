Question: Mark was unwell for 3 months, during which he lost 10 pounds per month. If his final weight was 70 pounds, what was his initial weight?
Iteration: Test New Architecture_6
proposed answer: To validate the consolidated initial weight, we need to ensure that the calculations align with the information provided. Mark lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months, which totals a weight loss of 30 pounds. If his final weight is 70 pounds, we can find his initial weight by adding the total weight lost to his final weight. Therefore, the calculation is: Initial Weight = Final Weight + Total Weight Lost = 70 pounds + 30 pounds = 100 pounds. This confirms that the initial weight of 100 pounds is consistent with the final weight and the total weight loss, making it a reliable solution.

Answer:100 pounds
