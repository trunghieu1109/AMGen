Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

Next, we calculate the outer radius r_o as the distance from the center of the sphere to the outer surface of the torus, which gives us r_o = 11 + 3 = 14. The difference between these two radii is r_i - r_o = 8 - 14 = -6. Since we are interested in the absolute difference, we take |r_i - r_o| = |8 - 14| = 6. The problem states that this difference can be expressed as m/n, where m and n are relatively prime positive integers.

The torus has a major radius of 6 and a minor radius of 3, while the sphere has a radius of 11. The torus will be tangent to the sphere at two different circles: one for the inner surface and one for the outer surface. The equations for the tangency can be derived from the distances involved. The distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is the radius of the sphere minus the minor radius of the torus for the inner tangency, and the radius of the sphere plus the minor radius of the torus for the outer tangency. Thus, the implicit equations can be expressed as follows: For inner tangency, the distance is 11 - 3 = 8, and for outer tangency, the distance is 11 + 3 = 14. Therefore, the implicit equations for the tangency are based on these distances, leading to the circles of tangency having radii r_i = 8 and r_o = 14.; answer - Inner tangency radius: 8, Outer tangency radius: 14\n<SEPERATOR>\nSubtask 4 output: thinking - To consolidate the two tangency-case equations for the torus and the sphere, we recognize that the inner tangency radius is derived from the distance from the center of the sphere to the inner surface of the torus, which is 11 - 3 = 8. The outer tangency radius is derived from the distance from the center of the sphere to the outer surface of the torus, which is 11 + 3 = 14. Therefore, we have two distinct radii: r_i = 8 for the inner tangency and r_o = 14 for the outer tangency. The difference between these two radii is r_i - r_o = 8 - 14 = -6. However, since we are interested in the absolute difference, we take |r_i - r_o| = |8 - 14| = 6. The problem states that this difference can be expressed as m/n, where m and n are relatively prime positive integers.

The torus has a major radius of 6 and a minor radius of 3, while the sphere has a radius of 11. The torus will be tangent to the sphere at two different circles: one for the inner surface and one for the outer surface. The equations for the tangency can be derived from the distances involved. The distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is the radius of the sphere minus the minor radius of the torus for the inner tangency, and the radius of the sphere plus the minor radius of the torus for the outer tangency. Thus, the implicit equations can be expressed as follows: For inner tangency, the distance is 11 - 3 = 8, and for outer tangency, the distance is 11 + 3 = 14. Therefore, the implicit equations for the tangency are based on these distances, leading to the circles of tangency having radii r_i = 8 and r_o = 14.; answer: Inner tangency radius: 8, Outer tangency radius: 14\n<SEPERATOR>\nAggregate agent hTiC, consolidating equations, thinking: To consolidate the two tangency-case equations for the torus and the sphere, we recognize that the inner tangency radius is derived from the distance from the center of the sphere to the inner surface of the torus, which is 11 - 3 = 8. The outer tangency radius is derived from the distance from the center of the sphere to the outer surface of the torus, which is 11 + 3 = 14. Therefore, we have two distinct radii: r_i = 8 for the inner tangency and r_o = 14 for the outer tangency. The difference between these two radii is r_i - r_o = 8 - 14 = -6. However, since we are interested in the absolute difference, we take |r_i - r_o| = |8 - 14| = 6. The problem states that this difference can be expressed as m/n, where m and n are relatively prime positive integers. The absolute difference of 6 can be expressed as 6/1, where 6 and 1 are relatively prime.
