Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

The torus has a major radius of 6 and a minor radius of 3, while the sphere has a radius of 11. The torus is positioned such that it is externally tangent to the sphere. The distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is the sum of the sphere's radius and the torus's major radius. The radii of the tangent circles can be derived from the relationship between the distances and the radii of the torus and sphere. The inner radius r_i corresponds to the distance from the center of the sphere to the inner edge of the torus, while the outer radius r_o corresponds to the distance to the outer edge of the torus. Therefore, we can express r_i and r_o in terms of the sphere's radius and the torus's dimensions, leading to the equations: r_i = 11 - 3 = 8 and r_o = 11 + 3 = 14. The difference r_i - r_o can then be calculated as 8 - 14 = -6, which can be expressed as -6 = -6/1, where m = 6 and n = 1.

The torus has a major radius of 6 and a minor radius of 3, while the sphere has a radius of 11. The torus is positioned such that it is externally tangent to the sphere. The distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is the sum of the sphere\\\'s radius and the torus\\\'s major radius. The radii of the tangent circles can be derived from the relationship between the distances and the radii of the torus and sphere. The inner radius r_i corresponds to the distance from the center of the sphere to the inner edge of the torus, while the outer radius r_o corresponds to the distance to the outer edge of the torus. Therefore, we can express r_i and r_o in terms of the sphere\\\'s radius and the torus\\\'s dimensions, leading to the equations: r_i = 11 - 3 = 8 and r_o = 11 + 3 = 14. The difference r_i - r_o can then be calculated as 8 - 14 = -6, which can be expressed as -6 = -6/1, where m = 6 and n = 1. Since 6 and 1 are relatively prime, we find m+n = 6+1 = 7.\\n\\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent lPku:\\n7\\n\\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Subtask 2: Using the derived expressions for r_i and r_o from Subtask 1, calculate the difference r_i - r_o considering multiple reasoning paths to verify consistency and correctness.\\n\\n Return your answer in the "answer" entry and justify detailedly why you think so in the "thinking" entry.

The inner radius r_i is correctly calculated as 8, which is the distance from the center of the sphere to the inner edge of the torus (11 - 3). The outer radius r_o is correctly calculated as 14, which is the distance from the center of the sphere to the outer edge of the torus (11 + 3). The difference r_i - r_o is indeed -6, which can be expressed as -6/1. Since 6 and 1 are relatively prime, we have m = 6 and n = 1. Therefore, m + n = 6 + 1 = 7.
