Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: The difference between the inner radius r_i and the outer radius r_o of the torus when tangent to the sphere is calculated as follows: r_i = 11 - 3 = 8 and r_o = 11 + 3 = 14. The difference is r_i - r_o = 8 - 14 = -6. The absolute difference is |8 - 14| = 6. This can be expressed as 6/1, where 6 and 1 are relatively prime. Therefore, m = 6 and n = 1, leading to m + n = 7.

proposed answer: The final validated answer for m+n is 7, as derived from the calculations of the inner radius r_i and the outer radius r_o, where r_i = 8 and r_o = 14. The difference r_i - r_o is -6, which can be expressed as -6/1. Taking the absolute values gives m = 6 and n = 1, which are relatively prime. Therefore, m + n = 6 + 1 = 7.
