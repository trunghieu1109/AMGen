This transformation shows that we are essentially looking at the square of the distance from each 13th root of unity to the point 1 on the complex plane. Since the roots of unity are symmetrically distributed, the product of these squared distances will yield a specific numeric result. The periodicity and symmetry of the roots of unity allow us to compute this product efficiently.
