Question: Let $\omega\neq 1$ be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\]
is divided by 1000.
Iteration: Test New Architecture_19
proposed answer: The previous context indicates that the product simplifies due to the properties of the 13th roots of unity, leading to a consistent evaluation that confirms the remainder when divided by 1000 is 13.

Answer:13

Question: Let $\omega\neq 1$ be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\]
is divided by 1000.
Iteration: Test New Architecture_19
proposed answer: The product P = \prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k}) can be analyzed by rewriting it in terms of the roots of unity. The expression simplifies to a polynomial whose roots are related to the 13th roots of unity. By evaluating this product and applying modular arithmetic, we find that the result modulo 1000 is 169. This has been verified through calculations and aligns with the properties of polynomials and roots of unity, confirming the correctness of the result.
