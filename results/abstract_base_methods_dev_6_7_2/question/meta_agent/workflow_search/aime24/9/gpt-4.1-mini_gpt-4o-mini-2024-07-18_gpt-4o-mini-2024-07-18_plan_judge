Question: Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.
Iteration: Test New Architecture_9
proposed answer: The extracted values of m and n are m = 1 and n = 115, which represent the probability of winning the grand prize given that Jen has won a prize. Since 1 and 115 have no common factors other than 1, they are relatively prime. Therefore, the fraction 1/115 is in its simplest form, confirming that the sum m + n = 1 + 115 = 116 is correct.

Answer:116
