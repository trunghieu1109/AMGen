Question: Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). Then \(OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\).

proposed answer: The derived expression for OC^2 was evaluated as 7/16, where p = 7 and q = 16. Since 7 and 16 are relatively prime, the expression is simplified correctly. Therefore, the sum p + q equals 23.

proposed answer: To find OC^2, we need to calculate the distance from the origin O(0,0) to the point C(1/3, sqrt(3)/6). The distance squared from the origin to a point (x,y) is given by OC^2 = x^2 + y^2. Substituting the coordinates of C, we have OC^2 = (1/3)^2 + (sqrt(3)/6)^2. Calculating this gives OC^2 = 1/9 + 3/36. To combine these fractions, we find a common denominator, which is 36. Thus, OC^2 = 4/36 + 3/36 = 7/36. The integers p and q are 7 and 36, respectively, and they are relatively prime. Therefore, p + q = 7 + 36 = 43.
