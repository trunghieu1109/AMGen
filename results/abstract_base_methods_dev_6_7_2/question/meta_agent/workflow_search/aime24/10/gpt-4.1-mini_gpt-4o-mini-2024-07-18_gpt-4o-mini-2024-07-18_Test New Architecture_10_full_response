This conclusion is consistent with the geometric properties and the dimensions given, confirming that the derived equation is valid under the provided conditions.; correct: 167\n<SEPERATOR>\nSpecificFormat agent d3MA, polishing JSON output, thinking: To find the length of CE, we analyze the relationships between the rectangles and the collinear points. Given that D, E, C, and F are collinear, we can express CE in terms of the dimensions of the rectangles. The dimensions provided are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184.
