Question: Let $p$ be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $n^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$. Find the least positive integer $m$ such that $m^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$.
Iteration: Test New Architecture_4
proposed answer: The least prime number p for which there exists a positive integer n such that n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2 is 5. We need to find the least positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 5^2, which is 25. Testing small integers, we find that m = 5 satisfies this condition since 5^4 + 1 = 625 + 1 = 626, and 626 is divisible by 25.

Iteration: Test New Architecture_4
proposed answer: The least prime p that satisfies the condition is 13, as established in the previous sub-task. We need to find the least positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 13^2, which is 169. From the previous findings, it was determined that m = 3 satisfies this condition, as 3^4 + 1 = 81 + 1 = 82, and 82 is divisible by 13^2. Therefore, the least positive integer m is 3.
