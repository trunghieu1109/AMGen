Therefore, the least positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 5^2 is 5.; answer: 5\n<SEPERATOR>\nAnswerGenerate agent fSKI, generating final m, thinking: The least prime number p for which there exists a positive integer n such that n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2 is 5. We need to find the least positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 5^2, which is 25. Testing small integers, we find that m = 5 satisfies this condition since 5^4 + 1 = 625 + 1 = 626, and 626 is divisible by 25.; answer: 5', iteration_idx=-1)]
