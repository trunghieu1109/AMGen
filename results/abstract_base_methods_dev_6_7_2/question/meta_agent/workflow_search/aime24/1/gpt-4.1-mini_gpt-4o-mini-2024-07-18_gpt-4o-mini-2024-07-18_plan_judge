Question: Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.
Iteration: Test New Architecture_1
proposed answer: The previous solution correctly identified that AP can be expressed as the fraction 15/4, where m = 15 and n = 4. Since 15 and 4 are relatively prime, the sum m + n is 19. Therefore, the final answer is 19.

Iteration: Test New Architecture_1
proposed answer: The fraction AP = 45/14 has been confirmed to be in lowest terms, as the greatest common divisor (gcd) of 45 and 14 is 1. This means that 45 and 14 are relatively prime integers. Therefore, the values of m and n are correctly identified as m = 45 and n = 14. The sum m + n = 45 + 14 = 59 is consistent with the problem conditions and the requirements for the fraction to be in lowest terms.
