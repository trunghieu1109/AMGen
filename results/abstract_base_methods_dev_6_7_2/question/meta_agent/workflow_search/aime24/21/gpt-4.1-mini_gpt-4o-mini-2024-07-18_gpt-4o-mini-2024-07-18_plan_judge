Question: Find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon ($12$-gon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The diagram below shows three of those rectangles.
[asy] unitsize(0.6 inch); for(int i=0; i<360; i+=30) { dot(dir(i), 4+black); draw(dir(i)--dir(i+30)); } draw(dir(120)--dir(330)); filldraw(dir(210)--dir(240)--dir(30)--dir(60)--cycle, mediumgray, linewidth(1.5)); draw((0,0.366)--(0.366,0), linewidth(1.5)); [/asy]
Iteration: Test New Architecture_21
proposed answer: The previous context indicates that the number of distinct rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon is 36. This conclusion is based on the analysis of the combinations of opposite pairs of vertices that can create valid rectangles, ensuring all configurations are considered.

Answer:36
Extracted answer: 36
Correct answer: 315
