Question: Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.
Iteration: Test New Architecture_6
proposed answer: The problem involves finding the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain rectangular boxes with given surface area and volume. After deriving the necessary equations and solving for the dimensions, we find that the value of p + q, where r^2 = p/q and p and q are coprime integers, is 77.

Iteration: Test New Architecture_6
proposed answer: The values of p and q for r^2 = p/q were derived as p = 23 and q = 4, which are relatively prime positive integers. Therefore, p + q = 23 + 4 = 27.
