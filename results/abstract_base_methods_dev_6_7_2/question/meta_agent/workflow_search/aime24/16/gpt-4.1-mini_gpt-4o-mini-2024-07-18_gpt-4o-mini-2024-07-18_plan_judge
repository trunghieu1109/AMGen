Question: Let $\triangle ABC$ have circumcenter $O$ and incenter $I$ with $\overline{IA}\perp\overline{OI}$, circumradius $13$, and inradius $6$. Find $AB\cdot AC$.
Iteration: Test New Architecture_16
proposed answer: To find the product AB·AC, we can use the relationship between the circumradius R, inradius r, and the sides of the triangle. Given that R = 13 and r = 6, we can use the formula for the area Δ of the triangle, which is Δ = r * s, where s is the semiperimeter. We also have the formula for the circumradius R = abc / (4Δ). By substituting Δ into this formula, we can express abc in terms of R and r. The product AB·AC can be derived from the relationship involving the sides and the semiperimeter. After performing the necessary calculations, we find that AB·AC = 468, which is consistent with the relationships and formulas used in triangle geometry.
