The key equations are derived from the properties of the rhombus, specifically that the distances between adjacent vertices must be equal. The hyperbola's equation provides a constraint on the coordinates of the points. Therefore, the equations (a^2/20) - (b^2/24) = 1 and the equality of distances AB = AD must be maintained. This ensures that the points are not only on the hyperbola but also satisfy the rhombus condition. Thus, the final decision on the formulated equations is that they correctly represent the necessary relationships for the vertices of the rhombus on the hyperbola.; answer - The equations relating hyperbola parameters for the rhombus condition are: (a^2/20) - (b^2/24) = 1 and the equality of distances AB = AD.\n<SEPERATOR>\nSub-task 1 output: thinking - To parameterize points on the hyperbola given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1, we can use the standard parameterization of hyperbolas.

For a rhombus ABCD with diagonals intersecting at the origin, we can denote the points as A = (x1, y1), B = (x2, y2), C = (x3, y3), and D = (x4, y4). The diagonals BD and AC must be equal, and we can derive the expression for BD² using the coordinates of B and D. The constraints will ensure that the sides of the rhombus are equal, which can be expressed through the equal distances between the points A, B, C, and D. By substituting the parameterized points into the distance formulas, we can derive the expression for BD² and confirm that it satisfies the conditions of the rhombus. This leads us to a comprehensive understanding of the relationships between the vertices and the hyperbola.; answer - Let A = (2√5 cosh(t1), 2√6 sinh(t1)), B = (2√5 cosh(t2), 2√6 sinh(t2)), C = (2√5 cosh(t1), -2√6 sinh(t1)), D = (2√5 cosh(t2), -2√6 sinh(t2)).
