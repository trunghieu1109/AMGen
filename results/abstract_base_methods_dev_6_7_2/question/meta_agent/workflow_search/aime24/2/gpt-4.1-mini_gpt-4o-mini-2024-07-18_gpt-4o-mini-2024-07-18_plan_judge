Question: Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?

proposed answer: The problem involves determining the probability that all blue vertices of a regular octagon can be rotated to the positions of red vertices. After careful analysis and simplification of the combinatorial aspects, the correct fraction representing this probability was found to be 5/8. Since 5 and 8 are coprime, the final answer for m+n, where m=5 and n=8, is 13.

proposed answer: To determine the probability that all blue vertices of a regular octagon can be rotated to the positions of red vertices, we used Burnside's lemma. We calculated the total number of ways to color the octagon, which is 2^8 = 256, since each of the 8 vertices can be independently colored either red or blue. Then, we considered the configurations that allow for a rotation where all blue vertices land on originally red vertices. After analyzing the symmetries of the octagon, we found that there are 24 favorable configurations. Thus, the probability is 24/256, which simplifies to 3/32. The integers 3 and 32 are coprime, so we have m = 3 and n = 32. Therefore, m+n = 3+32 = 35, which is the final answer we need to provide.
