        "problem": "Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.",
        "correct_answer": "204",
        "n": "MAS-ZERO Workflow 0",
        "response": "From Sub-task 2, we know that the time spent in the coffee shop, t, is 24 minutes. We can use the equation 9 = s * (4 - t/60) to find Aya's walking speed s. Substituting t = 24, we have 9 = s * (4 - 0.4) = s * 3.6, which gives s = 9 / 3.6 = 2.5 km/h. Now, we need to calculate the time it takes for Aya to walk 9 km at s + 1/2 km/h, which is 2.5 + 0.5 = 3 km/h. The walking time is 9 / 3 = 3 hours. Including the 24 minutes spent in the coffee shop, the total time is 3 hours and 24 minutes. Converting this to minutes, we have 3 * 60 + 24 = 180 + 24 = 204 minutes.\n\nAnswer:204",

        "response": "We have two equations from the problem: 9/s = 4 - t/60 and 9/(s+2) = 2.4 - t/60. Solving these equations simultaneously, we find s = 3 and t = 60. To find the time it takes for Aya to walk 9 km at s+1/2 km/h, we calculate the walking time as 9/(3.5) hours = 2.5714 hours. Including the 60 minutes (1 hour) spent in the coffee shop, the total time is 2.5714 + 1 = 3.5714 hours, which is approximately 3 hours and 34 minutes. Converting this to minutes gives 3 * 60 + 34 = 214 minutes.\n\nAnswer:214",
