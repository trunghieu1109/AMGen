Question: Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.
proposed answer: The previous attempts have consistently identified that the winning positions for Bob are those where n is congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 3. The numbers from 1 to 2024 are divided into three congruence classes modulo 3. Since 2024 is congruent to 2 modulo 3, the distribution is as follows: 675 numbers are congruent to 0 modulo 3, 675 numbers are congruent to 1 modulo 3, and 674 numbers are congruent to 2 modulo 3. Therefore, the total number of numbers that are either 0 or 1 modulo 3 is 675 + 675 = 1350. This calculation has been verified multiple times and is consistent with the feedback provided. No further refinement is needed.

Question: Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.
proposed answer: The problem involves determining the number of winning positions for Bob in a game where Alice and Bob take turns removing 1 or 4 tokens from a stack of n tokens, with Alice going first. A position is winning for Bob if Alice's move leaves Bob in a losing position. From the analysis, Alice's losing positions are multiples of 5. Therefore, Bob's winning positions are those that are not multiples of 5. To find the number of such positions up to 2024, we calculate the total number of integers from 1 to 2024, which is 2024. We then find the number of multiples of 5 up to 2024. The largest multiple of 5 less than or equal to 2024 is 2020, which is 5 * 404. Thus, there are 404 multiples of 5 up to 2024. The number of integers that are not multiples of 5 is 2024 - 404 = 1620. This reasoning is consistent with the previous attempts and feedback, confirming that the count of winning positions for Bob is 1620.
