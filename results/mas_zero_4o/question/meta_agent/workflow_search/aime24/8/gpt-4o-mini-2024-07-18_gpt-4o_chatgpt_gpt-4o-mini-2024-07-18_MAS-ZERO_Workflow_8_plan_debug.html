    <pre>Related original question:

Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice&#39;s play.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 2: Based on the losing positions for Alice from Sub-task 1, determine the winning positions for Bob. 

 ### thinking by CoT-SC Agent UAEm:
In this game, a position is winning for Bob if Alice&#39;s move from that position leaves Bob in a losing position. From Sub-task 1, we know that Alice&#39;s losing positions occur when n is a multiple of 5 (n = 0, 5, 10, 15, ...). Therefore, the winning positions for Bob are those where Alice is forced to move to one of these losing positions. For instance, if n = 1, Alice can only remove 1 token, leaving 0 tokens, which is a losing position for Alice. Similarly, if n = 6, Alice can remove 1 token to leave 5 tokens, another losing position for Alice. By this reasoning, the winning positions for Bob are those that are not multiples of 5, i.e., n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, ...

### answer by CoT-SC Agent UAEm:
The winning positions for Bob are n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, ... (not multiples of 5).

### Sub-task 3: Based on the winning positions for Bob from Sub-task 2, count the number of such positions up to 2024. 

 ### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent wDjQ (yourself):
The winning positions for Bob are those numbers n that are not multiples of 5. To find the number of such positions up to 2024, we need to count the numbers from 1 to 2024 that are not divisible by 5. First, we calculate the total number of integers from 1 to 2024, which is 2024. Next, we find the number of multiples of 5 up to 2024. The largest multiple of 5 less than or equal to 2024 is 2020 (since 2020 = 5 * 404). Therefore, there are 404 multiples of 5 up to 2024. The number of integers that are not multiples of 5 is then 2024 - 404.

### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent wDjQ (yourself):
1620

### feedback #1 by Critic Agent Rkpc:
The reasoning provided is correct. The winning positions for Bob are those numbers that are not multiples of 5. The total number of integers from 1 to 2024 is 2024. The number of multiples of 5 up to 2024 is 404, as the largest multiple of 5 less than or equal to 2024 is 2020. Therefore, the number of integers that are not multiples of 5 is 2024 - 404 = 1620.

### Given previous attempts and feedback, refine the count of winning positions for Bob. 

 ### thinking #2 by Chain-of-Thought Agent wDjQ (yourself):
The previous attempts correctly identified that the winning positions for Bob are those numbers that are not multiples of 5. The total number of integers from 1 to 2024 is 2024. The number of multiples of 5 up to 2024 is calculated by finding the largest multiple of 5 less than or equal to 2024, which is 2020. Since 2020 = 5 * 404, there are 404 multiples of 5 up to 2024. Therefore, the number of integers that are not multiples of 5 is 2024 - 404 = 1620. This reasoning is correct and the count of winning positions for Bob is refined to 1620.

### answer #2 by Chain-of-Thought Agent wDjQ (yourself):
1620

### Sub-task 3: Based on the winning positions for Bob from Sub-task 2, count the number of such positions up to 2024. 

 ### feedback #2 by Critic Agent Rkpc:
The reasoning provided in the previous attempts is correct. The winning positions for Bob are those numbers that are not multiples of 5. Since there are 404 multiples of 5 up to 2024, the number of integers that are not multiples of 5 is 2024 - 404 = 1620.

### Given previous attempts and feedback, refine the count of winning positions for Bob. 

 ### thinking #3 by Chain-of-Thought Agent wDjQ (yourself):
The problem involves determining the number of winning positions for Bob in a game where Alice and Bob take turns removing 1 or 4 tokens from a stack of n tokens, with Alice going first. A position is winning for Bob if Alice&#39;s move leaves Bob in a losing position. From the analysis, Alice&#39;s losing positions are multiples of 5. Therefore, Bob&#39;s winning positions are those that are not multiples of 5. To find the number of such positions up to 2024, we calculate the total number of integers from 1 to 2024, which is 2024. We then find the number of multiples of 5 up to 2024. The largest multiple of 5 less than or equal to 2024 is 2020, which is 5 * 404. Thus, there are 404 multiples of 5 up to 2024. The number of integers that are not multiples of 5 is 2024 - 404 = 1620. This reasoning is consistent with the previous attempts and feedback, confirming that the count of winning positions for Bob is 1620.

### answer #3 by Chain-of-Thought Agent wDjQ (yourself):
1620

### Sub-task 3: Based on the winning positions for Bob from Sub-task 2, count the number of such positions up to 2024. 

 ### feedback #3 by Critic Agent Rkpc:
The reasoning provided is correct. Bob&#39;s winning positions are those where Alice is left with a multiple of 5, which are losing positions for her. Therefore, the number of winning positions for Bob is the total number of positions minus the multiples of 5.

Given the above, answer the following question: Given previous attempts and feedback, refine the count of winning positions for Bob.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry (for example, 300
[TOO_HARD]
Suggestion:...) and justify completely why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. Again, focus on the following question: Given previous attempts and feedback, refine the count of winning positions for Bob.</pre>
