Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.
[asy] size(10cm); usepackage(&#34;tikz&#34;);label(&#34;egin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(2,0)--(2,3)--(5,3)--(5,8)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}&#34;,origin); label(&#34;\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(0,3)--(3,3)--(3,5)--(8,5)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}&#34;,E); [/asy].

### Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1, calculate the number of valid paths for each configuration of direction changes. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent Fz6A:
We need to calculate the number of valid paths for each configuration of direction changes. According to sub-task 1, the configurations are of the form R^a U^b R^c U^d R^e, where a + c + e = 8 and b + d = 8. We must partition 8 into 3 positive parts for R moves and 8 into 2 positive parts for U moves. The number of partitions of 8 into 3 positive parts is given by the number of solutions to a + c + e = 8, where a, c, e &gt; 0. This is equivalent to finding the number of solutions to x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 5, where x_1, x_2, x_3 &gt;= 0 (since a = x_1 + 1, c = x_2 + 1, e = x_3 + 1). By the stars and bars method, this is C(5 + 2, 2) = C(7, 2) = 21. Similarly, the number of partitions of 8 into 2 positive parts is given by the number of solutions to b + d = 8, where b, d &gt; 0. This is equivalent to finding the number of solutions to y_1 + y_2 = 6, where y_1, y_2 &gt;= 0 (since b = y_1 + 1, d = y_2 + 1). By the stars and bars method, this is C(6 + 1, 1) = C(7, 1) = 7. For each configuration, the number of valid paths is determined by the multinomial coefficient that corresponds to the number of ways to arrange the R and U moves according to the configuration. We must sum the number of paths over all configurations. The total number of paths for each configuration is given by the product of the number of partitions of R moves and U moves, and the multinomial coefficient for each configuration. However, the problem is complex and requires careful enumeration of each case.

### Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 2, aggregate the results to find the total number of paths that change direction exactly four times. 

 ### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent Ykg3 (yourself):
The problem involves finding the total number of paths on an 8x8 grid that change direction exactly four times. According to the output of sub-task 2, the number of valid paths for each configuration of direction changes was calculated to be 1470. Since sub-task 3 asks to aggregate the results to find the total number of such paths, and the output of sub-task 2 already provides this total, the answer is simply the number given in sub-task 2.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry (for example, 300
[TOO_HARD]
Suggestion:...) and justify completely why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. Again, focus on the following question: Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 2, aggregate the results to find the total number of paths that change direction exactly four times.</pre>
