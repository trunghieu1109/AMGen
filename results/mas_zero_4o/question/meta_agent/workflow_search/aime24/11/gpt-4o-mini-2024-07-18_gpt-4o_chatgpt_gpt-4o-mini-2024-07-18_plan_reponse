The answer provided for Sub-task 2 is 1680, which represents the number of valid paths for a specific configuration. However, to find the total number of paths that change direction exactly four times, we need the results for all configurations, not just one. Without the results for other configurations, we cannot accurately aggregate the total number of paths. Therefore, the information is incomplete to provide a final answer.\n\nAnswer:1680\n[TOO_HARD]\nSuggestion: Provide the number of valid paths for each configuration of direction changes from Sub-task 2 to accurately aggregate the total number of paths.",

Since sub-task 3 asks to aggregate the results to find the total number of such paths, and the output of sub-task 2 already provides this total, the answer is simply the number given in sub-task 2.\n\nAnswer:1470",
