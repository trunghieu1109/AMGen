Question: Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.
[asy] size(10cm); usepackage("tikz");label("egin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(2,0)--(2,3)--(5,3)--(5,8)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}",origin); label("\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(0,3)--(3,3)--(3,5)--(8,5)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}",E); [/asy]
proposed answer: The problem requires aggregating the number of valid paths for each configuration of direction changes that were calculated in Sub-task 2. The answer provided for Sub-task 2 is 1680, which represents the number of valid paths for a specific configuration. However, to find the total number of paths that change direction exactly four times, we need the results for all configurations, not just one. Without the results for other configurations, we cannot accurately aggregate the total number of paths. Therefore, the information is incomplete to provide a final answer.

Answer:1680
[TOO_HARD]
Suggestion: Provide the number of valid paths for each configuration of direction changes from Sub-task 2 to accurately aggregate the total number of paths.

proposed answer: The problem asks for the total number of paths that change direction exactly four times on an 8x8 grid. According to sub-task 2, the number of valid paths for each configuration of direction changes was calculated to be 1470. Since sub-task 3 asks to aggregate the results to find the total number of such paths, and the output of sub-task 2 already provides this total, the answer is simply the number given in sub-task 2.
