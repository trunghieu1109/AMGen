Both agents agree that this expression can be rewritten in the form Rcos(\u03b8 + \u03c6), where R = 540 and \u03c6 is determined by tan(\u03c6) = -432/324 = -4/3. The maximum value of Rcos(\u03b8 + \u03c6) is R, which occurs when cos(\u03b8 + \u03c6) = 1, or \u03b8 + \u03c6 = 0. Therefore, the value of \u03b8 that maximizes the real part is \u03b8 = -\u03c6, where \u03c6 = arctan(-4/3).\n\nAnswer:arctan(4/3)",

        "response": "To maximize the expression 324cos\u03b8 - 432sin\u03b8, we convert it to the form Rcos(\u03b8 - \u03c6) where R = sqrt(324^2 + 432^2) = 540. The angle \u03c6 is given by tan\u03c6 = -432/324 = -4/3, so \u03c6 = arctan(-4/3). The real part is maximized when cos(\u03b8 - \u03c6) = 1, which occurs when \u03b8 - \u03c6 = 0, or \u03b8 = \u03c6. Thus, \u03b8 = arctan(-4/3) is the angle that maximizes the real part. The answer provided by Debate Agent kCqk is correct.\n\nAnswer:arctan(-4/3)",
