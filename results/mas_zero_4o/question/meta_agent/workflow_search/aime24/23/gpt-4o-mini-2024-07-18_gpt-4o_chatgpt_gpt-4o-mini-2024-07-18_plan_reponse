        "response": "To solve sub-task 5, we need to find the common combinations from the results of sub-task 3 and sub-task 4. Sub-task 3 provided the combinations that satisfy the condition ABC + DEF = 999 with the digit sum condition AD + BE + CF = 9. Sub-task 4 provided combinations that satisfy the same conditions. We need to identify the combinations that appear in both lists. From sub-task 3, the valid combinations are: (9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0), (9, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0), (9, 1, 8, 9, 8, 1), (9, 8, 1, 9, 1, 8), (9, 9, 0, 9, 0, 9). From sub-task 4, the valid combinations are: Top row: 008, Bottom row: 991; Top row: 017, Bottom row: 982; Top row: 026, Bottom row: 973; Top row: 035, Bottom row: 964; Top row: 044, Bottom row: 955; Top row: 053, Bottom row: 946; Top row: 062, Bottom row: 937; Top row: 071, Bottom row: 928; Top row: 080, Bottom row: 919; Top row: 089, Bottom row: 910. The common combination is (9, 1, 8, 9, 8, 1) which corresponds to Top row: 918, Bottom row: 081.\n\nAnswer:Top row: 918, Bottom row: 081",
