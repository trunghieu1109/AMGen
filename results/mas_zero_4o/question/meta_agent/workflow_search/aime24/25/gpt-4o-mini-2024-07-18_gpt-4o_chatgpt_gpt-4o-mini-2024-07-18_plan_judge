Question: Let ABCDEF be a convex equilateral hexagon in which all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle whose sides are extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. Find the side length of the hexagon.
proposed answer: The problem involves a special type of hexagon where all sides are equal and opposite sides are parallel, forming a 'parallelohexagon'. The triangle formed by the extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. These sides are not simply the sums or twice the hexagon's side length. Instead, they are related to the hexagon's side length through the geometry of the hexagon and the properties of the triangle. The correct approach involves recognizing that the triangle's sides are formed by the differences between the sums of the hexagon's sides, and using the fact that the hexagon is equilateral and has opposite sides parallel to find the correct side length. The equations previously used were incorrect because they did not correctly represent the relationship between the triangle's sides and the hexagon's side length. The correct side length of the hexagon should be determined by considering the relationship between the hexagon and the triangle, possibly involving the use of trigonometry or vector analysis. Given the complexity and the need for a more detailed geometric or algebraic analysis, the problem is quite challenging.

[TOO_HARD]
Suggestion: Consider using vector analysis or trigonometry to relate the side lengths of the triangle to the side length of the hexagon, taking into account the angles and parallel nature of the hexagon's sides.

Question: Let ABCDEF be a convex equilateral hexagon in which all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle whose sides are extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. Find the side length of the hexagon.
proposed answer: The problem involves a centrally symmetric equilateral hexagon where the extensions of opposite sides form a triangle with given side lengths. The key is to understand the relationship between the side lengths of this triangle and the side length of the hexagon. The triangle's sides are proportional to the distances between the parallel lines formed by the hexagon's sides. For a centrally symmetric equilateral hexagon, these distances are equal to the side length of the hexagon. Therefore, the side length of the hexagon is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the triangle's side lengths, which are 200, 240, and 300.
