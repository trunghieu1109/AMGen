    <pre>Related original question:

Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$..

### Sub-task 4: Based on Q and R from Sub-task 3, compute Q + R. 

 ### thinking by Debate Agent lpVg:
The sub-task 3 provides the values of Q and R as 8 and 181, respectively. To find Q + R, we simply add these two values together.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Based on Q and R from Sub-task 3, compute Q + R.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry (for example, 300
[TOO_HARD]
Suggestion:...) and justify completely why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. Again, focus on the following question: Sub-task 4: Based on Q and R from Sub-task 3, compute Q + R.</pre>
