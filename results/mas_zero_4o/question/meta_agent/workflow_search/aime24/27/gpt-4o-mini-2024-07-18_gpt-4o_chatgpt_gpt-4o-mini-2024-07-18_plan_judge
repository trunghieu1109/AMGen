Question: Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.
proposed answer: The task is to compute Q + R based on the given values from Sub-task 3, where Q = 7 and R = 770. This is a simple arithmetic addition problem.
