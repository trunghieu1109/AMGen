    <pre>Related original question:

Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$..

### Sub-task 4: Based on the output of sub-task 3, simplify the expression for the difference and find the sum of the numerator and denominator when expressed as a fraction in simplest form. 

 ### thinking by Debate Agent OJD0:
The difference between the radii of the circles of tangency, as determined in sub-task 3, is given as 9/2. This fraction is already in its simplest form because the numerator (9) and the denominator (2) are relatively prime. Therefore, the sum of the numerator and the denominator is simply the addition of these two numbers, which is 9 + 2.

### thinking by Debate Agent vl7f:
The difference between the radii of the circles of tangency was calculated as 9/2 in sub-task 3. This fraction is already in its simplest form, with 9 as the numerator and 2 as the denominator. Since 9 and 2 are relatively prime, their sum is simply the addition of these two numbers.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Based on the output of sub-task 3, simplify the expression for the difference and find the sum of the numerator and denominator when expressed as a fraction in simplest form.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry (for example, 300
[TOO_HARD]
Suggestion:...) and justify completely why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. Again, focus on the following question: Sub-task 4: Based on the output of sub-task 3, simplify the expression for the difference and find the sum of the numerator and denominator when expressed as a fraction in simplest form.</pre>
