Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.
proposed answer: The output of sub-task 3 provided the difference between the radii of the circles of tangency as 9/2. This fraction is already in its simplest form, with the numerator being 9 and the denominator being 2. To find the sum of the numerator and the denominator, we simply add these two numbers together: 9 + 2.

proposed answer: The difference in the radii of the circles of tangency is given as 6 in sub-task 3. This can be expressed as the fraction 6/1, which is already in its simplest form since the numerator and denominator are relatively prime. Therefore, the sum of the numerator and denominator is 6 + 1 = 7.

proposed answer: The difference between the radii of the circles of tangency, as determined in sub-task 3, is given as 9/2. This fraction is already in its simplest form because the numerator (9) and the denominator (2) are relatively prime. Therefore, the sum of the numerator and the denominator is simply the addition of these two numbers, which is 9 + 2.
