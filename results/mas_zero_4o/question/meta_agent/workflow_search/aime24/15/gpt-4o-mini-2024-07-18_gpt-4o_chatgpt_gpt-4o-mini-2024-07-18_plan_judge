Question: Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.
proposed answer: To find the number of residents who own all four items, we need to determine how many own all three specific items (diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade) since everyone owns a bag of candy hearts. The problem states that 234 residents own exactly three of these items. Since owning all four items means owning all three specific items plus the bag of candy hearts, and everyone owns a bag of candy hearts, the number of residents who own all four items is the same as the number who own all three specific items, which is 234.

Answer:234

proposed answer: The problem involves determining the number of residents who own all four items: a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, a garden spade, and a bag of candy hearts. We know that 234 residents own exactly three of the three specific items (diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade). Since every resident owns a bag of candy hearts, these 234 residents also own all four items. The inclusion-exclusion principle and the given data confirm that 234 residents own all three specific items, and since everyone owns a bag of candy hearts, these 234 residents own all four items.
