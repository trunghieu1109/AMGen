However, the answer was marked as [TOO_HARD], indicating uncertainty or complexity in the computation. This suggests that the computation might involve deeper algebraic insights or simplifications that were not fully explored. Without additional information or verification of the product being 0, the best assumption based on the given answer is that the remainder is 0. Further verification using properties of cyclotomic polynomials or symmetry in roots of unity might be necessary to ensure the product is indeed 0.\n\nAnswer:0\n[TOO_HARD]\nSuggestion: Consider verifying the product using properties of cyclotomic polynomials or symmetry in roots of unity to ensure the product is indeed 0.",
