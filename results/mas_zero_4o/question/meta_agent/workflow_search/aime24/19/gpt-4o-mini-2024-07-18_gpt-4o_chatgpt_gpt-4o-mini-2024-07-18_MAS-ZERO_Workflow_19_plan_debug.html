Let $\omega\neq 1$ be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\]
is divided by 1000.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1, compute the product of all terms. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent zSpU:
We need to compute the product \( \prod_{k=0}^{12} ( (1 - \omega^k)^2 + 1 ) \). This simplifies to \( \prod_{k=0}^{12} ( 2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k} ) \). Since \( \omega \) is a 13th root of unity, the values \( \omega^k \) for \( k = 0, 1, \ldots, 12 \) are distinct roots of the polynomial \( x^{13} - 1 = 0 \). The expression \( 2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k} = (1 - \omega^k)^2 + 1 \) evaluates to different values for each \( k \). The product of all terms is a symmetric polynomial in the roots of unity. This can often be simplified using properties of roots of unity, but the computation is complex and involves algebraic manipulation of symmetric polynomials. The result can be found by evaluating this product modulo 1000, but this requires detailed algebraic computation.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry (for example, 300
[TOO_HARD]
Suggestion:...) and justify completely why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. Again, focus on the following question: Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 2, find the remainder when the product is divided by 1000.</pre>
