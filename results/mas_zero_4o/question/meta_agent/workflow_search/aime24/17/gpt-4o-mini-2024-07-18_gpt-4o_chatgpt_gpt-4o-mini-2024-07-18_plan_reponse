This is a complex problem because it involves checking each combination against a non-linear equation, which is computationally intensive. The equation is symmetric but does not lend itself to easy analytical solutions without computational tools. Therefore, solving this manually is impractical.\n\nAnswer:0\n[TOO_HARD]\nSuggestion: Use a computer program to iterate over all 45551 combinations and check which ones satisfy the equation. This will efficiently filter the valid triples.",
