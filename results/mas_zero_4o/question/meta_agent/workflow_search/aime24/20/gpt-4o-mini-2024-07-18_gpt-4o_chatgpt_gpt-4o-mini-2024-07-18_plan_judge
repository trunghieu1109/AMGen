Question: Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.
proposed answer: A b-beautiful integer n is expressed as n = ab + c, where a and c are digits in base b, with 0 <= a, c < b and a > 0. The sum of the digits a and c must equal sqrt(n). The range of possible b-beautiful integers is from b to b^2 - 1. For each n in this range, we need to check if there exist digits a and c such that a + c = sqrt(n). We count the number of such integers for each base b and find the smallest b for which there are more than ten b-beautiful integers. We need to iterate over possible values of n from b to b^2 - 1, calculate sqrt(n), and check if it can be expressed as a sum of two digits a and c in base b. This requires checking if sqrt(n) is an integer and if there exist a and c such that a + c = sqrt(n) and 0 <= c < b, 1 <= a < b.

Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.
proposed answer: To find the number of b-beautiful integers for each base b, we need to consider integers n that are perfect squares and satisfy b <= n < b^2. For each such n, we check if there exist digits a and c such that n = ab + c and a + c = sqrt(n). We need to count how many such n exist for each base b and find the smallest b for which there are more than ten such integers. We will iterate over possible values of b, calculate the range of n, and check the conditions for each perfect square n in that range.
