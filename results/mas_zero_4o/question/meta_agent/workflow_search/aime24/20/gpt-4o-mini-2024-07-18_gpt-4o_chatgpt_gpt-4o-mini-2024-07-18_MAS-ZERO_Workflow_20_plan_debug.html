    <pre>Related original question:

Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers..

### Sub-task 2: Based on the properties from sub-task 1, calculate the range of possible b-beautiful integers for a given base b. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent GFCY:
A b-beautiful integer n is expressed as n = ab + c, where a and c are digits in base b, with 0 &lt;= a, c &lt; b and a &gt; 0. The sum of the digits a + c must equal sqrt(n). For n to have exactly two digits in base b, it must satisfy b &lt;= n &lt; b^2. Therefore, the range of possible b-beautiful integers n is b &lt;= n &lt; b^2. Additionally, n must be a perfect square since sqrt(n) = a + c is an integer.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent GFCY:
The range of possible b-beautiful integers for a given base b is b &lt;= n &lt; b^2, where n is also a perfect square.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 2, count the number of b-beautiful integers for each base b and identify the smallest base b for which there are more than ten such integers.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry (for example, 300
[TOO_HARD]
Suggestion:...) and justify completely why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. Again, focus on the following question: Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 2, count the number of b-beautiful integers for each base b and identify the smallest base b for which there are more than ten such integers.</pre>

    <pre>To find the number of b-beautiful integers for each base b, we need to consider integers n that are perfect squares and satisfy b &lt;= n &lt; b^2. For each such n, we check if there exist digits a and c such that n = ab + c and a + c = sqrt(n). We need to count how many such n exist for each base b and find the smallest b for which there are more than ten such integers. We will iterate over possible values of b, calculate the range of n, and check the conditions for each perfect square n in that range.
