    <pre>Related original question:

Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$..

### Sub-task 4: Based on the output of sub-task 3, simplify the fraction representing r^2 and find the sum of the numerator and denominator. 

 ### thinking by Debate Agent RUSF:
The task is to simplify the fraction representing r^2, which is given as 9.3541125. This decimal can be expressed as the fraction 93541125/10000000. To simplify this fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 93541125 and 10000000. After calculating, the GCD is 25. Dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 25 gives us the fraction 3741645/400000. This fraction is in its simplest form because 3741645 and 400000 are relatively prime. Therefore, the sum of the numerator and the denominator is 3741645 + 400000.

### thinking by Debate Agent 9tQc:
The square of the radius, r^2, is given as 9.3541125. To convert this decimal into a fraction, we express it as 93541125/10000000. The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 93541125 and 10000000 is 25. Dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 25, we simplify the fraction to 3741645/400000. Since 3741645 and 400000 are relatively prime, the fraction is in its simplest form. The sum of the numerator and denominator in this simplest form is 3741645 + 400000.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Based on the output of sub-task 3, simplify the fraction representing r^2 and find the sum of the numerator and denominator.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry (for example, 300
[TOO_HARD]
Suggestion:...) and justify completely why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. Again, focus on the following question: Sub-task 4: Based on the output of sub-task 3, simplify the fraction representing r^2 and find the sum of the numerator and denominator.</pre>
