Question: Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.
proposed answer: To solve for r^2, we need the dimensions of the box (l, w, h) that satisfy the equations 2(lw + lh + wh) = 54 and lwh = 23. These dimensions allow us to calculate the box's diagonal, which is necessary to find the sphere's radius. The diagonal is calculated using sqrt(l^2 + w^2 + h^2), and the radius r is half this diagonal. Without these dimensions, we cannot compute the diagonal or r^2. Since sub-task 3 did not provide these dimensions, the problem is too complex to solve directly without additional information.

Suggestion: Solve the system of equations 2(lw + lh + wh) = 54 and lwh = 23 to find specific dimensions (l, w, h). Once found, calculate the diagonal using sqrt(l^2 + w^2 + h^2) and then find the minimum radius of the sphere as half the diagonal. Simplify r^2 and find the sum of the numerator and denominator.

Question: Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.
proposed answer: The task is to simplify the fraction representing r^2, which is given as 9.3541125. This decimal can be expressed as the fraction 93541125/10000000. To simplify this fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 93541125 and 10000000. After calculating, the GCD is 25. Dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 25 gives us the fraction 3741645/400000. This fraction is in its simplest form because 3741645 and 400000 are relatively prime. Therefore, the sum of the numerator and the denominator is 3741645 + 400000.
