Question: There exist real numbers $x$ and $y$, both greater than 1, such that $\log_x\left(y^x\right)=\log_y\left(x^{4y}\right)=10$. Find $xy$.
proposed answer: From the output of sub-task 2, we have found that x = 5 and y = 5. The task is to calculate the product xy. Since both x and y are 5, their product is simply 5 * 5. This calculation is straightforward and consistent with the values found for x and y.

proposed answer: From sub-task 2, we have determined that x = 100 and y = 10. To find the product xy, we simply multiply these two values together. The product xy = 100 * 10 = 1000. This calculation is straightforward and consistent with the values obtained in sub-task 2.
