    <pre>Related original question:

Rectangles $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are drawn such that $D,E,C,F$ are collinear. Also, $A,D,H,G$ all lie on a circle. If $BC=16$,$AB=107$,$FG=17$, and $EF=184$, what is the length of $CE$?.

### Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 1 and sub-task 2, use the properties of the circle and rectangles to deduce the length of CE. 

 ### thinking by Debate Agent vJpQ:
The problem involves two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH, with collinear points D, E, C, F, and concyclic points A, D, H, G. Given the side lengths, we can deduce the length of CE by considering the straight line DECF. Since DE is calculated as EF - AB = 184 - 107 = 77, and CD is equal to BC, which is 16, CE can be calculated as DE - CD = 77 - 16 = 61. This is consistent with the properties of the given geometric figures.

### thinking by Debate Agent gFXa:
The problem involves two rectangles ABCD and EFGH with collinear points D, E, C, F, and concyclic points A, D, H, G. The side lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107 for rectangle ABCD, and FG = 17, EF = 184 for rectangle EFGH. The collinearity of D, E, C, F indicates that DECF forms a straight line. The length DE can be calculated as EF - AB = 184 - 107 = 77. Since CD = BC = 16 and CF = FG = 17, the length of CE is DE - CD = 77 - 16 = 61. This calculation is consistent with the given dimensions and geometric properties.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 1 and sub-task 2, use the properties of the circle and rectangles to deduce the length of CE.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry (for example, 300
[TOO_HARD]
Suggestion:...) and justify completely why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. Again, focus on the following question: Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 1 and sub-task 2, use the properties of the circle and rectangles to deduce the length of CE.</pre>
