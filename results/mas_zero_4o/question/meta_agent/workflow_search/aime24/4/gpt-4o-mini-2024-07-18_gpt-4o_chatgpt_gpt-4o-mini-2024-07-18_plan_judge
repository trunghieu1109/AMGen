Question: Let $p$ be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $n^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$. Find the least positive integer $m$ such that $m^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$.
proposed answer: The least prime number p for which there exists a positive integer n such that n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2 is p = 3, as determined in Sub-task 1. We need to find the smallest positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 3^2 = 9. Testing small values of m, we find that for m = 2, m^4 + 1 = 16 + 1 = 17, and 17 is divisible by 9. Therefore, m = 2 is the correct answer.

Question: Let $p$ be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $n^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$. Find the least positive integer $m$ such that $m^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$.
proposed answer: We have determined that the least prime p for which there exists a positive integer n such that n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2 is p = 3. Now, we need to find the smallest positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 3^2 = 9. This means we need m^4 ≡ -1 ≡ 8 (mod 9). Testing small values of m, we find that m = 2 satisfies this condition, as 2^4 + 1 = 17 ≡ 8 (mod 9). Therefore, m = 2 is the correct answer.
