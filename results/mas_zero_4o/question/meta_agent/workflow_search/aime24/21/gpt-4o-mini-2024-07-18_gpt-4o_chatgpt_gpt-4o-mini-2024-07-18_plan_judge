Question: Find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon ($12$-gon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The diagram below shows three of those rectangles.
[asy] unitsize(0.6 inch); for(int i=0; i<360; i+=30) { dot(dir(i), 4+black); draw(dir(i)--dir(i+30)); } draw(dir(120)--dir(330)); filldraw(dir(210)--dir(240)--dir(30)--dir(60)--cycle, mediumgray, linewidth(1.5)); draw((0,0.366)--(0.366,0), linewidth(1.5)); [/asy]
proposed answer: The problem involves counting rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon using its sides and diagonals. The dodecagon has 12 sides, forming 6 pairs of parallel sides. Additionally, diagonals can be grouped by length and position to form parallel pairs. The complexity arises from the need to systematically enumerate all possible configurations of these diagonal pairs and ensure they form closed rectangles. The debate results suggest a count of 36 rectangles, but the problem's complexity and the need for precise geometric analysis indicate that this problem is challenging without further decomposition or detailed enumeration of all possible configurations.

Suggestion: Enumerate all possible sets of diagonal pairs by length and position, ensuring each set is correctly grouped to form parallel pairs that can contribute to forming rectangles.

proposed answer: The problem involves counting the number of rectangles that can be formed by selecting two pairs of parallel lines from a regular dodecagon, where each pair must intersect perpendicularly to form a rectangle. The dodecagon has 6 pairs of parallel sides and 10 pairs of parallel diagonals, totaling 16 pairs of parallel lines. However, not all combinations of these pairs will form rectangles because they might not intersect perpendicularly. The debate agents suggest that the number of rectangles is 120, but they also indicate that the problem is too complex without specific geometric constraints or configurations showing which pairs can intersect perpendicularly. Therefore, while the answer given is 120, it is marked as too hard due to the lack of detailed geometric analysis or constraints.

Answer:120
[TOO_HARD]
Suggestion: Provide specific geometric configurations or constraints indicating which pairs of parallel lines can form a closed rectangle in the dodecagon.
