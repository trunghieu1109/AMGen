    <pre>Related original question:

Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$..

 ### thinking by Debate Agent loRB:
To solve for the inradius of the tetrahedron, we need both the volume and the surface area. The volume has been calculated as 72. The surface area requires calculating the area of each triangular face using Heron&#39;s formula. Without the specific areas of the faces, we cannot compute the exact surface area or the inradius. Consequently, we cannot determine the values of m, n, and p to find their sum m+n+p. Additionally, the complexity of calculating the surface area with the given side lengths and ensuring the resulting inradius is in the form \( \frac{m \sqrt{n}}{p} \) adds to the difficulty. Thus, without further detailed calculations or simplifications, it is challenging to provide an accurate sum of m, n, and p.

### thinking by Debate Agent H98Z:
The problem involves calculating the inradius of a tetrahedron, which requires both the volume and the surface area. The volume has been calculated as 72, but the surface area requires calculating the area of each triangular face using Heron&#39;s formula. Without explicit values for the face areas, we cannot compute the surface area and thus the inradius. The problem is complex due to missing intermediate steps and data, making it difficult to determine m, n, and p accurately.

Suggestion: Calculate the area of each face of the tetrahedron using Heron&#39;s formula to determine the surface area, then find the inradius as the volume divided by the surface area. Express the inradius in the form \( \frac{m \sqrt{n}}{p} \) to find m, n, and p.

Suggestion: Provide detailed calculations of the surface area using Heron&#39;s formula for each face of the tetrahedron, then use the inradius formula to find m, n, and p.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Based on the outputs of sub-task 1, 2, and 3, sum m, n, and p to get the final answer.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry (for example, 300
[TOO_HARD]
Suggestion:...) and justify completely why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. Again, focus on the following question: Sub-task 4: Based on the outputs of sub-task 1, 2, and 3, sum m, n, and p to get the final answer.</pre>
