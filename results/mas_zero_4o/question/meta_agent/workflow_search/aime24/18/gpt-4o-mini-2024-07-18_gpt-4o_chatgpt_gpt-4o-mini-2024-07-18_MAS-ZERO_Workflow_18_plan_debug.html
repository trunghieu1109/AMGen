    <pre>Related original question:

Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). Then \(OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\)..

### Sub-task 4: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1, 2, and 3, calculate OC^2 and express it in the form of \(rac{p}{q}\) where p and q are relatively prime positive integers. 

 ### thinking by Debate Agent 581x:
The unique point C on line AB that does not belong to any segment from the family \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\) was found to be C(3/4) = (1/8, 3\sqrt{3}/8). To find OC^2, we calculate the squared distance from the origin O(0,0) to C(1/8, 3\sqrt{3}/8). The calculation is as follows: OC^2 = (1/8)^2 + (3\sqrt{3}/8)^2 = 1/64 + 27/64 = 28/64 = 7/16. The integers 7 and 16 are relatively prime. Thus, p = 7 and q = 16, giving p + q = 23.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1, 2, and 3, calculate OC^2 and express it in the form of \(rac{p}{q}\) where p and q are relatively prime positive integers.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry (for example, 300
[TOO_HARD]
Suggestion:...) and justify completely why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. Again, focus on the following question: Sub-task 4: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1, 2, and 3, calculate OC^2 and express it in the form of \(rac{p}{q}\) where p and q are relatively prime positive integers.</pre>

    <pre>The point C on line AB is given as C(1/8, 3√3/8). To find OC^2, we calculate the squared distance from the origin O(0,0) to C(1/8, 3√3/8). The calculation is OC^2 = (1/8)^2 + (3√3/8)^2 = 1/64 + 27/64 = 28/64 = 7/16. The integers 7 and 16 are relatively prime, so p = 7 and q = 16, giving p + q = 23.
