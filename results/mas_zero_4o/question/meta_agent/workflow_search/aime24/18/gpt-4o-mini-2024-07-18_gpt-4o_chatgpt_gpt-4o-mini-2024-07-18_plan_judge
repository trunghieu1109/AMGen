Question: Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). Then \(OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\).
proposed answer: The point C on line AB is determined to be at t = 1/2, with coordinates C = (1/4, sqrt(3)/4). To find OC^2, we calculate the squared distance from the origin to C, which is (1/4)^2 + (sqrt(3)/4)^2. Simplifying this, we have 1/16 + 3/16 = 4/16 = 1/4. This fraction is already in its simplest form, with p = 1 and q = 4, which are relatively prime. Therefore, the sum p + q is 1 + 4 = 5.

Question: Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). Then \(OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\).
proposed answer: The point C on line AB is given as C(1/8, 3√3/8). To find OC^2, we calculate the squared distance from the origin O(0,0) to C(1/8, 3√3/8). The calculation is OC^2 = (1/8)^2 + (3√3/8)^2 = 1/64 + 27/64 = 28/64 = 7/16. The integers 7 and 16 are relatively prime, so p = 7 and q = 16, giving p + q = 23.
