Question: Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.
proposed answer: The problem involves using the power of a point theorem, where AD * DP = 81, to find the length of AP. However, the length of AD is unknown, making it impossible to calculate AP directly. Without additional information such as the coordinates of point D or specific angles in triangle ABC, the problem cannot be solved with the given data. The sub-task requires converting AP into the form m/n and finding m + n, but without knowing AP, this is not possible. Therefore, the problem remains unsolved with the current information.

Question: Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.
proposed answer: The problem involves finding the length of AP in a circle with given side lengths of a triangle inscribed in the circle. The tangents from B and C intersect at D, and AD intersects the circle again at P. To find AP, we would typically use the power of a point theorem or intersecting chords theorem. However, without additional information such as the radius of the circle, the exact position of D, or the power of D with respect to the circle, we cannot determine AP. The problem lacks sufficient data to calculate AP and express it in the form \(\frac{m}{n}\). Therefore, we cannot find \(m + n\).

Suggestion: Additional information about the circle, such as its radius or specific relationships involving AD, DP, and the circle, is needed to determine AP accurately.
