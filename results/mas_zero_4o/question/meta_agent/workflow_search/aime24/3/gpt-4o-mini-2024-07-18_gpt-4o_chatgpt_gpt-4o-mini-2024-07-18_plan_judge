Question: Define $f(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{4}|$. Find the number of intersections of the graphs of \[y=4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \quad\text{ and }\quad x=4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))).\]
proposed answer: The functions y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))) both have ranges of [0, 1] as determined in sub-tasks 4 and 5. To find the intersection points, we need to find values of x and y such that y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))) = x. This means we are looking for solutions to the equation 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))). This reduces to g(f(sin(2πx))) = g(f(cos(3πy))). Since g(f(x)) has a piecewise behavior, we need to consider when f(sin(2πx)) and f(cos(3πy)) are within the same intervals to satisfy the equation. Both f(sin(2πx)) and f(cos(3πy)) have ranges [0, 1/2], and g(f(x)) maps these to [0, 1/4]. The critical points occur when f(sin(2πx)) = f(cos(3πy)) = 1/4, as this is where the piecewise definition changes. Solving for intersections involves setting sin(2πx) = cos(3πy) or their absolute values equal, considering the periodicity and symmetry of sine and cosine. However, the exact number of intersections within a period requires careful analysis of these trigonometric functions and their symmetries, which is complex.

Question: Define $f(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{4}|$. Find the number of intersections of the graphs of \[y=4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \quad\text{ and }\quad x=4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))).\]
proposed answer: The functions y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))) both have ranges [0, 1]. Therefore, they can intersect at any point (x, y) such that 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))), which simplifies to g(f(sin(2πx))) = g(f(cos(3πy))). Since g(f(x)) has a range of [0, 1/4], the values of f(sin(2πx)) and f(cos(3πy)) must be such that they map to the same value under g. The function f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| has a range of [0, 1/2], and g maps this range to [0, 1/4]. The possible values of g(f(x)) are 0, 1/8, and 1/4 (corresponding to f(x) = 0, 1/4, and 1/2 respectively). Therefore, we need to find when f(sin(2πx)) = f(cos(3πy)) for these values. For f(x) = 0, this occurs when |x| = 1/2. For f(x) = 1/4, this occurs when |x| = 1/4 or |x| = 3/4. For f(x) = 1/2, this occurs when |x| = 0 or |x| = 1. We need to find the number of x, y pairs that satisfy these conditions. Each condition corresponds to a periodic equation in x and y, and we need to count the number of solutions over one period of the sine and cosine functions.
