proposed answer: The problem asks for the approximation of the mass squared of the pseudo-Goldstone boson H_2 generated through radiative corrections in an extended Standard Model framework. The mass formula should be derived from the one-loop effective potential, where contributions come from all particles coupling to the scalar sector. These contributions are proportional to the fourth power of the particle masses, weighted by coefficients \alpha_i that encode coupling constants and multiplicities. Bosonic particles contribute positively, while fermionic particles contribute negatively due to their statistics. The vacuum expectation values (VEVs) of the scalar fields \phi and h combine as (x^2 + v^2), which sets the scale of spontaneous symmetry breaking and appears in the denominator to normalize the mass squared. Among the four candidate formulas, choice 3 correctly includes all relevant particle contributions with the correct signs: positive bosonic terms (h_1, W, Z, H^{\pm}, H^0, A^0) and negative fermionic terms (top quark t and singlet fermions N_i). The normalization factor 1/(8\pi^2 (x^2 + v^2)) is consistent with the loop factor and the scale of symmetry breaking. Choice 1 omits the top quark contribution, which is significant due to its large Yukawa coupling. Choice 2 omits the pseudoscalar A^0 term, which is expected to contribute positively as a bosonic degree of freedom. Choice 4 incorrectly places the factor (x^2 + v^2) in the numerator, which contradicts the standard form of radiative corrections where the mass squared is inversely proportional to the symmetry breaking scale squared. The formula is dimensionally consistent, physically complete, and aligns with theoretical expectations from the Coleman-Weinberg potential. Therefore, the best and most theoretically consistent approximation for the pseudo-Goldstone boson mass squared through radiative corrections is given by choice 3.
