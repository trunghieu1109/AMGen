Question: Example(question='Astronomers are interested in the luminosities of two stars. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2. The mass of Star_1 is also larger by the same factor (1.5 times). Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same. Astronomers also calculated the radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:', choice1='~2.25', choice2='~2.35', choice3='~2.32', choice4='~2.23\n', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Test New Architecture_176
proposed answer: The luminosity of a star radiating as a black body is given by L = 4πR^2σT^4. Since both stars have the same peak wavelength, their temperatures are equal (T1 = T2). Therefore, the luminosity ratio L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2. Given R1 = 1.5 × R2, the luminosity ratio is (1.5)^2 = 2.25. The mass ratio and radial velocities do not affect the luminosity ratio in this context because the temperature is the same and Doppler effects are either corrected or negligible. Among the given choices, ~2.25 is the closest and correct factor for the luminosity ratio.

proposed answer: The problem involves two stars with Star_1 having a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2 and the same factor for mass. Both stars have the same observed peak wavelength, implying equal effective temperatures. However, Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, causing a Doppler redshift that affects the intrinsic temperature calculation. Correcting for this Doppler effect, Star_2's intrinsic temperature is slightly higher than Star_1's. The luminosity ratio L1/L2 for black body stars is given by (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4. Substituting R1/R2 = 1.5 and T1/T2 = 1/1.00233 (accounting for Doppler shift), the ratio becomes approximately 2.23. Among the given options (~2.25, ~2.35, ~2.32, ~2.23), the closest and most accurate value is ~2.23. This choice correctly incorporates the Doppler correction and aligns with black body radiation laws, making it the physically consistent answer.
