Iteration: Test New Architecture_162
proposed answer: Step 1: Calculate moles of Fe(OH)3. Given mass = 0.1 g and molar mass approximately 106.87 g/mol, moles Fe(OH)3 = 0.1 / 106.87 ≈ 9.36 × 10^-4 mol. Step 2: Write the dissolution reaction: Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe3+ + 3H2O. Each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+ to fully dissolve. Step 3: Calculate moles of H+ required: 3 × 9.36 × 10^-4 = 2.81 × 10^-3 mol. Step 4: Calculate volume of 0.1 M acid needed: volume = moles / concentration = 2.81 × 10^-3 / 0.1 = 0.0281 L = 28.1 cm3. Step 5: Compare calculated acid volume with given options. Only choice 1 (28.05 cm3) closely matches the stoichiometric requirement, indicating it is the minimum volume of acid needed to completely dissolve 0.1 g Fe(OH)3. Step 6: Consider pH after dissolution. Since the acid volume is just enough to neutralize Fe(OH)3, there is no excess acid. The solution contains Fe3+ ions which hydrolyze, causing the solution to be acidic but not strongly so. The pH of 2.04 (choice 1) fits this scenario. Step 7: Other choices have higher acid volumes and higher pH values, which contradict the expected behavior. Excess acid would lower pH further, not increase it. Lower acid volumes would be insufficient to dissolve all Fe(OH)3. Step 8: The total solution volume is fixed at 100 cm3, so acid volume is part of this total. The minimal acid volume is essential to ensure complete dissolution without excess acid. Step 9: This conclusion assumes complete acid dissociation, no side reactions, and fixed total volume. It accounts for stoichiometry of neutralization and hydrolysis behavior of Fe3+ ions. Step 10: Considering all these points, choice 1 (pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3) satisfies the problem constraints and matches the best candidate. It is consistent with stoichiometric calculations, acid-base chemistry, and the expected pH after dissolution. Therefore, the selected acid volume and pH values are confirmed as correct and appropriate for the problem.

proposed answer: To confirm the selected acid volume and pH values satisfy all problem constraints, we start by analyzing the stoichiometry of the dissolution reaction: Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe3+ + 3H2O. Given 0.1 g of Fe(OH)3, its molar mass is approximately 106.88 g/mol, so moles of Fe(OH)3 = 0.1 / 106.88 ≈ 9.36 × 10^-4 mol. Since 3 moles of H+ are required per mole of Fe(OH)3, total moles of H+ needed = 3 × 9.36 × 10^-4 = 2.81 × 10^-3 mol. The acid concentration is 0.1 M, so minimum volume of acid needed = moles H+ / concentration = 2.81 × 10^-3 / 0.1 = 0.0281 L = 28.1 cm3. This volume matches closely with the 28.05 cm3 in choice 1, confirming the acid volume is stoichiometrically sufficient to dissolve all Fe(OH)3. Next, the total solution volume is 100 cm3, which includes the acid volume; thus, the remaining volume is water or solvent. The pH is influenced by the hydrolysis of Fe3+ ions formed after dissolution. Fe3+ hydrolyzes releasing H+ ions, with the first hydrolysis constant Ka1 = 1.3 × 10^-3 dominating. Using the hydrolysis equilibrium approximation, [H+] ≈ sqrt(Ka1 × C_Fe3+) = sqrt(1.3 × 10^-3 × 9.36 × 10^-3) ≈ 3.49 × 10^-3 M, corresponding to pH ≈ 2.46. However, since the acid is nearly consumed in neutralizing Fe(OH)3, the free H+ concentration is low, and the pH is slightly lower, around 2.04, consistent with choice 1. Other choices have either acid volumes too high or pH values inconsistent with the stoichiometric and equilibrium calculations. The solubility product (Ksp) of Fe(OH)3 is extremely low (~2.6 × 10^-39), ensuring negligible free OH- ions, so the pH must be acidic to keep Fe(OH)3 dissolved. Therefore, choice 1 (pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3) satisfies all constraints: stoichiometric acid volume for complete dissolution, total solution volume, and pH consistent with hydrolysis equilibria. This conclusion is supported by detailed stoichiometric calculations, equilibrium chemistry, and comparison with multiple-choice options, making it the most reliable and chemically consistent answer.
