proposed answer: The best synthetic route to obtain 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene must start with Friedel-Crafts alkylation to introduce the tert-butyl group because this reaction requires an activated aromatic ring. Performing nitration first would deactivate the ring and hinder alkylation. The tert-butyl group is an ortho/para director and activates the ring, directing nitration to the meta position relative to itself, which corresponds to the 3-position on the ring. After nitration, the nitro group is reduced to an amino group using Fe/HCl, enabling diazotization. Diazotization of the amino group followed by hydrolysis converts it to phenol, which can then be converted to the ethoxy group via Williamson ether synthesis using NaOH/EtBr. Sulfonation and desulfonation steps can be used as protecting or directing groups but must be carefully placed so as not to interfere with key transformations. Among the given choices, Choice 1 and Choice 3 start correctly with Friedel-Crafts alkylation and nitration, making them chemically reasonable. Choice 2 and Choice 4 have problematic orders such as diazotization before reduction or Friedel-Crafts alkylation after nitration, making them less feasible. Between Choice 1 and Choice 3, Choice 1 is simpler and avoids the complications of an additional nitration step after diazotization seen in Choice 3. The majority of detailed analyses and expert reasoning favor Choice 1 as the most reliable and high-yielding sequence. Therefore, Choice 1 is selected as the best candidate synthetic route.

proposed answer: The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, which means the benzene ring has a tert-butyl group at position 2, an ethoxy group at position 1, and a nitro group at position 3. Starting from benzene, the first step should be Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 to introduce the tert-butyl group. This group is an ortho/para director and activating, so subsequent electrophilic substitutions will occur ortho or para to it. To introduce the nitro group at position 3 (meta to tert-butyl), a blocking group is needed to direct nitration selectively. Sulfonation (SO3/H2SO4) can serve as a blocking group at the para position to tert-butyl, preventing nitration there and forcing nitration to the meta position relative to tert-butyl. After sulfonation, nitration (HNO3/H2SO4) introduces the nitro group at the desired position. Reduction of the nitro group (Fe/HCl) to an amino group allows diazotization (NaNO2/HCl), which can be converted to a phenol (H3O+, H2O/heat). The phenol can then be alkylated with NaOH/EtBr to introduce the ethoxy group at position 1. Finally, desulfonation (dilute H2SO4) removes the blocking sulfonic acid group. This sequence respects directing effects, uses blocking groups effectively, and avoids incompatible steps such as nitration before Friedel-Crafts alkylation or omission of blocking groups. Among the given choices, Choice 1 follows this logical sequence: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts alkylation), viii) SO3/H2SO4 (sulfonation), ii) HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration), iii) Fe/HCl (reduction), v) NaNO2/HCl (diazotization), vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat (hydrolysis to phenol), vii) NaOH/EtBr (alkylation to ethoxy), ix) dilute H2SO4 (desulfonation). This sequence ensures high regioselectivity and yield, correctly positions substituents, and avoids previous logical errors. Therefore, Choice 1 is the correct synthetic route.
