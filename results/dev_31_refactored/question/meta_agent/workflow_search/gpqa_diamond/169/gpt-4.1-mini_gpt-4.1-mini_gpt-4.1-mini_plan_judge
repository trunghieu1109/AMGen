Iteration: Test New Architecture_169
proposed answer: The expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for the electron in the spin state (3i, 4) is calculated by first normalizing the spin state vector. The norm squared is |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = 9 + 16 = 25, so the normalized state is (3i/5, 4/5). The spin operator S_y is given by (hbar/2) times the Pauli matrix sigma_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Applying sigma_y to the normalized state yields (-4i/5, -3/5). Taking the inner product of the conjugate transpose of the normalized state with this result gives (-3i/5)*(-4i/5) + (4/5)*(-3/5) = (12*(-1)/25) - (12/25) = -24/25. Multiplying by hbar/2 gives the expectation value as -12*hbar/25. This matches choice B. The calculation carefully handles complex conjugation and normalization, ensuring the result is physically meaningful and consistent with quantum mechanical principles. All intermediate steps are consistent and no contradictions arise. The normalization is essential to get the correct expectation value, and the complex conjugation is correctly applied to the spinor components. Therefore, the most consistent and accurate candidate solution is choice B.
