Question: Example(question='Consider an aperture, which shapes like a N-sided polygon. All the apothems are of the same length a. When a monochromatic light (of wavelength \\lambda), travelling along z-axis, falls vertically on this aperture, it creates a series of intensity maxima and minima in the far field region. What is the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large ? Assume that the related angles are small so that tan theta = theta approximation can be taken.', choice1='1.220 \\lambda /a ', choice2='0.610 \\lambda / a', choice3='0.500 \\lambda / a', choice4='0.506 \\lambda / a', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: The problem involves finding the angular distance between the first two minima in the far-field diffraction pattern of an aperture shaped as an N-sided polygon with apothem length a, in the limit as N approaches infinity. As N becomes very large, the polygon approaches a circular aperture of radius a. The diffraction pattern for a circular aperture is described by the Airy pattern, where the minima correspond to zeros of the Bessel function J_1. The first two zeros of J_1 are approximately 3.8317 and 7.0156. Using the relation θ = zero / (k a) with k = 2π / λ and the small angle approximation (sin θ ≈ θ), the angular positions of the first two minima are θ_1 = 3.8317 / (k a) and θ_2 = 7.0156 / (k a). The angular distance between these minima is Δθ = θ_2 - θ_1 = (7.0156 - 3.8317) / (k a) = 3.1839 / (k a). Substituting k = 2π / λ gives Δθ = (3.1839 λ) / (2π a) ≈ 0.506 (λ / a). Comparing this with the given choices, the closest and exact match is choice 4: 0.506 λ / a. This conclusion is consistent with the physics of diffraction, the mathematical properties of the Bessel function zeros, and the problem's assumptions (far-field, small angle approximation, polygon approaching circle). Both aggregate agents independently concluded the same answer, confirming its correctness and consistency. Therefore, the best evaluated candidate is choice 4.
