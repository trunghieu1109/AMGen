proposed answer: The question asks to arrange six benzene derivatives in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed upon electrophilic bromination with excess bromine, assuming only one monobromo derivative forms. The substituents are: 1) CH3 (methyl), 2) COOC2H5 (ethyl ester), 3) Cl (chlorine), 4) NO2 (nitro), 5) C2H5 (ethyl), 6) COOH (carboxyl). The key factors influencing the para-isomer yield are the electronic directing effects and steric hindrance.

Step 1: Electronic Effects
- Electron-donating groups (EDGs) such as methyl (1) and ethyl (5) activate the ring and direct substitution to ortho and para positions.
- Electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) such as nitro (4), carboxyl (6), and ester (2) deactivate the ring and direct substitution meta, resulting in low para substitution.
- Halogens (3) are deactivating but ortho/para directing due to resonance.

Step 2: Steric Hindrance
- Ethyl (5) is bulkier than methyl (1), which increases steric hindrance at ortho positions and thus favors para substitution more strongly.
- Carboxyl (6) is bulkier than ester (2), so steric hindrance may increase para substitution fraction for (6) relative to (2).
- Halogen (3) has moderate steric hindrance.

Step 3: Combining Effects
- Strong meta-directing groups (4, 2, 6) have the lowest para fractions, with nitro (4) the lowest due to the strongest electron-withdrawing effect.
- Para fraction for benzoic acid (6) is higher than for ethyl benzoate (2) due to steric effects.
- Chlorobenzene (3) is ortho/para directing but deactivating, so para fraction is moderate.
- Methyl (1) and ethyl (5) groups give the highest para fractions, with ethyl (5) > methyl (1) due to steric hindrance favoring para over ortho substitution.

Step 4: Final Ranking
From lowest to highest para-isomer weight fraction:
4 (NO2) < 2 (COOC2H5) < 6 (COOH) < 3 (Cl) < 1 (CH3) < 5 (C2H5).

Step 5: Matching with Provided Choices
This order exactly matches choice 2: 4 < 2 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5.

Step 6: Validation
This ranking is consistent with well-established principles of electrophilic aromatic substitution, substituent directing effects, and steric considerations. The assumption that only one monobromo derivative forms suggests high selectivity, which supports the reasoning about para-isomer predominance in activating groups and low para yield in meta-directing groups.

Therefore, the previously selected ranking (choice 2) is correct and consistent with chemical principles.

proposed answer: The question asks to arrange six benzene derivatives in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed upon electrophilic bromination. The substituents on the benzene ring influence the regioselectivity of bromination through their electronic effects (electron-donating or electron-withdrawing) and steric effects. Electron-donating groups (EDGs) such as methyl (CH3) and ethyl (C2H5) activate the ring and direct substitution to ortho and para positions, generally increasing the para-isomer yield. Among these, ethyl is bulkier than methyl, which increases steric hindrance at the ortho positions, favoring para substitution more than methyl. Electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) such as nitro (NO2), carboxyl (COOH), and ester (COOC2H5) deactivate the ring and direct substitution mainly to the meta position, resulting in low para-isomer yield. Nitro is a strong EWG and strongly meta-directing, so it gives the lowest para-isomer yield. Carboxyl and ester groups are also meta-directing but less strongly than nitro; between them, benzoic acid (COOH) is less deactivating than ethyl benzoate (COOC2H5), so benzoic acid gives a higher para-isomer yield than ethyl benzoate. Halogens like chlorine (Cl) are deactivating but ortho/para directing due to resonance effects, so chlorobenzene gives moderate para substitution, higher than meta directors but lower than EDGs. Putting this all together, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is: nitrobenzene (4) < ethyl benzoate (2) < benzoic acid (6) < chlorobenzene (3) < toluene (1) < ethylbenzene (5). Comparing this to the given choices, only choice 2 (4 < 2 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5) matches this order exactly. This ranking aligns well with established chemical principles and experimental data on electrophilic aromatic substitution regioselectivity. Therefore, choice 2 is the correct answer with high confidence. There are minimal uncertainties since the substituent effects and directing influences are well-known and consistent. The assumption that only one monobromo derivative forms simplifies the analysis by focusing on the major isomer, which is reasonable under controlled reaction conditions.
