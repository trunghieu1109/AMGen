proposed answer: The combined product mixture contains four stereoisomers: two enantiomers of the trans-diol (from the (E)-oct-4-ene reaction) and two enantiomers of the cis-diol (from the (Z)-oct-4-ene reaction). These four stereoisomers consist of two pairs of enantiomers that are diastereomeric to each other. In standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC, enantiomers cannot be separated because they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, each pair of enantiomers will appear as a single peak. Since there are two pairs of enantiomers (trans and cis diols), the standard HPLC will show 2 peaks. In chiral HPLC, enantiomers can be separated due to chiral interactions with the stationary phase. Thus, each enantiomer will appear as a separate peak. Since there are four stereoisomers total (two pairs of enantiomers), the chiral HPLC will show 4 peaks. Therefore, the chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC chromatogram and 4 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.

Answer:2 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC
Extracted answer: 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC
Correct answer: 3

proposed answer: The mixture contains three stereoisomers: one single chiral diastereomer from Reaction 1 and a pair of enantiomers from Reaction 2. In standard (achiral) HPLC, enantiomers are not separated because they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, the two enantiomers from Reaction 2 will co-elute as one peak. The single diastereomer from Reaction 1 is distinct and will appear as a separate peak. Hence, in standard HPLC, there will be 2 peaks: one for the diastereomer and one for the enantiomeric pair. In chiral HPLC, enantiomers are separated due to their different interactions with the chiral stationary phase. Thus, the two enantiomers from Reaction 2 will appear as two separate peaks. The diastereomer from Reaction 1 is also distinct and will appear as a separate peak. Therefore, in chiral HPLC, there will be 3 peaks: one for the diastereomer and two for the enantiomers. This analysis assumes ideal chromatographic resolution and no meso compounds. Hence, the expected observation is 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC.
