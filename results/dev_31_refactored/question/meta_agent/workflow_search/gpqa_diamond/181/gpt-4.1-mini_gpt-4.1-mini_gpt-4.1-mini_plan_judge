proposed answer: The Mott-Gurney equation describes the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) in a semiconductor device and is derived under specific physical assumptions. These assumptions include: (1) the device is trap-free, meaning no traps capture carriers and alter the current-voltage relationship; (2) single-carrier transport dominates, so only one type of charge carrier (electron or hole) is significant; (3) the contacts are Ohmic, implying negligible injection barriers and thus free carrier injection; and (4) the current is dominated by drift current under the electric field, with diffusion current negligible. Evaluating each choice against these assumptions: Choice 1 states a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current. 'No carrier injection barrier' is equivalent to having Ohmic contacts, which is necessary for the Mott-Gurney equation to apply. This matches all physical assumptions exactly, making this choice consistent. Choice 2 assumes negligible drift current, which contradicts the fundamental basis of SCLC, where drift current is the dominant transport mechanism. Neglecting drift current invalidates the equation. Choice 3 involves two-carrier transport, violating the single-carrier assumption, which complicates the physics and invalidates the simple quadratic voltage dependence of the Mott-Gurney equation. Choice 4 involves a Schottky contact, which introduces an injection barrier, violating the Ohmic contact assumption. This prevents free carrier injection, making the equation invalid. Considering all possible cases, only Choice 1 satisfies all necessary assumptions for the Mott-Gurney equation to be valid. The other choices violate one or more fundamental assumptions and thus are invalid. This conclusion aligns with the physics of space-charge-limited current and the derivation of the Mott-Gurney equation. Therefore, the best and most accurate choice is Choice 1.
