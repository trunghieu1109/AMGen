proposed answer: The observed spectral peak at 790 nm with a significant flux drop at shorter wavelengths is indicative of the Lyman break, which occurs at a rest-frame wavelength of 91.2 nm (912 Å). Using the redshift formula z = (λ_observed / λ_emitted) - 1, we find z = (790 nm / 91.2 nm) - 1 ≈ 7.7. This high redshift corresponds to a very distant quasar. Given the Lambda-CDM cosmological parameters (H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc, Ω_m = 0.3, Ω_Λ = 0.7, flat universe), the comoving distance for z ≈ 7.7 is approximately 9 Gpc. The multiple-choice options are 6, 7, 8, and 9 Gpc. Distances less than 9 Gpc correspond to significantly lower redshifts, inconsistent with the Lyman break interpretation at 790 nm. Alternative interpretations of the spectral feature would yield different redshifts and distances, but the sharp flux drop at wavelengths shorter than 790 nm strongly supports the Lyman break scenario. Therefore, the best matching comoving distance from the given options is 9 Gpc.

proposed answer: The observed spectral peak at 790 nm with a significant flux drop at shorter wavelengths suggests a spectral break typical of high-redshift quasars. The most common spectral breaks used for redshift estimation in quasars are the Lyman limit (rest wavelength 91.2 nm), the Lyman-alpha break (rest wavelength 121.6 nm), and the Balmer break (rest wavelength ~364.6 nm). Calculating the redshift z for each break using z = (λ_observed / λ_rest) - 1: - For the Lyman limit: z = (790 / 91.2) - 1 ≈ 7.66 - For Lyman-alpha: z = (790 / 121.6) - 1 ≈ 5.5 - For Balmer break: z = (790 / 364.6) - 1 ≈ 1.17 The sharp flux drop at wavelengths shorter than 790 nm aligns best with the Lyman-alpha break, which is commonly used to identify high-redshift quasars. The Lyman limit break would imply an even higher redshift (~7.66), which is possible but less typical for many quasar observations. The Balmer break redshift (~1.17) is too low to explain the sharp drop and is inconsistent with the observed spectral features. Using the Lambda-CDM cosmological model parameters (H_0=70 km/s/Mpc, Ω_m=0.3, Ω_Λ=0.7, flat universe), the comoving distances corresponding to these redshifts are approximately: - z ≈ 5.5 (Lyman-alpha): ~8 Gpc - z ≈ 7.66 (Lyman limit): ~9 Gpc - z ≈ 1.17 (Balmer): ~2-3 Gpc (excluded) Given the multiple-choice options of 6, 7, 8, or 9 Gpc, the best estimate aligns with the Lyman-alpha break interpretation, yielding a comoving distance around 8 Gpc. The 8 Gpc choice balances the observed spectral features and cosmological calculations, providing a reasonable and commonly accepted value for such quasar observations. Therefore, the comoving distance of the quasar from Earth is best assumed to be about 8 Gpc.
