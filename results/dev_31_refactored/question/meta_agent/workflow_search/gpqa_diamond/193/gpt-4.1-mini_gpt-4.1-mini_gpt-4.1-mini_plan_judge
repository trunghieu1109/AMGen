proposed answer: The system consists of three spins S1, S2, and S3, each taking values ±1. The energy is given by E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Since each pair product S_i S_j is ±1, the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can take only two possible values: 3 or -1. Specifically, when all spins are aligned (all +1 or all -1), each pair product is +1, so the sum is 3, making E = -3J. There are 2 such configurations. When one spin differs from the other two, two pair products are -1 and one is +1, so the sum is -1, making E = +J. There are 6 such configurations. No other energy levels occur. The partition function Z is the sum over all configurations of e^{-βE}, which can be grouped by energy levels and their degeneracies: Z = 2 e^{-β(-3J)} + 6 e^{-β(J)} = 2 e^{3Jβ} + 6 e^{-Jβ}. Comparing this expression to the given choices, only choice 1 matches exactly: Z = 2 e^{3Jβ} + 6 e^{-Jβ}. Other choices have incorrect exponents or coefficients inconsistent with the degeneracy and energy level analysis. This result holds regardless of the sign of J (ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic coupling) because the energy levels and degeneracies are fixed by spin configurations, and the Boltzmann factor e^{-βE} naturally accounts for the sign of J and temperature T through β = 1/(kT). Therefore, choice 1 is the correct and best matching formula for the partition function of this three-spin system.
