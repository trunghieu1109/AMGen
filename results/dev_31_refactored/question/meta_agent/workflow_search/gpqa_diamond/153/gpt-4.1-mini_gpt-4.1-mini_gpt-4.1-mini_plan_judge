Question: Example(question='In the lab, a chemist discovers an unnamed bottle with a white solid inside. He gathers the following spectral information in order to identify the liquid. Make a reasonable structural suggestion for the unidentified drug using the information provided.\nMass: molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 (100%)\na peak at m/z = 158 (32%)\nIR : broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1, strong sharp peak at 1720 cm-1\n1H NMR: 11.0 ppm (s, 1H), 8.02 ppm (d, 2H), 7.72 (d, 2H)', choice1='4-chlorobenzoic acid', choice2='2-chlorobenzoic acid', choice3='3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde\n', choice4='Phenyl chloroformate', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: The molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 with a significant isotope peak at m/z = 158 (about 32% intensity) confirms the presence of one chlorine atom due to the natural isotopic distribution of 35Cl and 37Cl. The IR spectrum shows a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1, characteristic of O-H stretching in carboxylic acids, and a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1, indicative of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid functional group. The 1H NMR spectrum shows a singlet at 11.0 ppm integrating to 1H, typical for a carboxylic acid proton, confirming the acid group. The aromatic region shows two doublets at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm, each integrating to 2H, indicating a para-substituted benzene ring due to symmetrical substitution. Ortho- or meta-substituted chlorobenzoic acids would show more complex splitting patterns and different integration ratios because of asymmetry. Other candidates do not fit the molecular weight, substitution pattern, or functional groups indicated by the spectra. Therefore, the most plausible structural candidate is 4-chlorobenzoic acid, which matches all spectral data and isotopic patterns perfectly.
