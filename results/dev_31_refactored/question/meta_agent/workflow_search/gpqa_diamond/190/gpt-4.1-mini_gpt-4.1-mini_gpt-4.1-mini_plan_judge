Question: Example(question='3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one is treated with sodium hydride, followed by benzyl bromide, forming product 1.\n\n1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide in the presence of a catalytic amount of HCl, forming product 2.\n\n2 is treated at low temperature with n-butyllithium, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride, forming product 3.\n\n3 is stirred with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere, forming product 4.\n\nWhat is the structure of product 4?', choice1='(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol', choice2="N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide", choice3='(((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene', choice4='3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Test New Architecture_190
proposed answer: The starting material undergoes benzylation of the hydroxymethyl group, forming a benzyloxymethyl substituent. Then, the ketone is converted to a tosyl hydrazone. Treatment with n-butyllithium induces a Shapiro reaction, converting the hydrazone to an alkene at position 1. Finally, catalytic hydrogenation reduces the alkene to an alkane, reduces the prop-1-en-2-yl group to an isopropyl group, and cleaves the benzyl ether back to a hydroxymethyl group. The final product is a cyclohexane ring with a hydroxymethyl group at position 3 and an isopropyl group at position 5, matching (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol. Other options retain protecting groups or substituents inconsistent with the final transformations.
