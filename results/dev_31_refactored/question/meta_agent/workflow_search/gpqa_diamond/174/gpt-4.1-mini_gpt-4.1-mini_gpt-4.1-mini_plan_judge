Question: Example(question='Consider an oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis).

proposed answer: The problem involves an oscillating spheroidal charge distribution symmetric about the z-axis, radiating electromagnetic power at wavelength λ. The angular dependence of the radiation intensity for a dipole-like oscillation aligned along the z-axis is proportional to sin^2(θ), which peaks at θ = 90°. Evaluating sin^2(30°) = (1/2)^2 = 1/4, so the fraction of maximum power at 30° is 1/4. The wavelength dependence of dipole radiation power scales as λ^{-4} because power ∝ ω^4 and ω = 2πc/λ. Higher multipole orders have steeper wavelength dependencies (e.g., quadrupole scales as λ^{-6}). Given the spheroidal shape and symmetry, the dominant radiation is likely dipole-like, making λ^{-4} the physically consistent wavelength scaling. Other options with fractions 1/2 or 3/4 or wavelength scalings λ^{-3} or λ^{-6} correspond to less likely or higher multipole contributions, which are not supported by the problem context. Therefore, the most reliable and consistent answer is the fraction 1/4 and the wavelength dependence λ^{-4}. This matches the physical scenario and symmetry constraints of the problem.

proposed answer: The problem involves an oscillating spheroidal charge distribution symmetric about the z-axis, which implies no dipole radiation but quadrupole radiation dominates. Quadrupole radiation power scales as λ^{-6} and has an angular dependence proportional to sin^2(2θ). Evaluating sin^2(2θ) at θ=30° gives sin^2(60°) = 3/4, meaning the power radiated at θ=30° is 3/4 of the maximum power A. Among the given choices, only choice 2 matches both the fraction 3/4 and the λ^{-6} wavelength dependence, consistent with quadrupole radiation theory. Other choices either have incorrect angular fractions or incorrect wavelength scaling. Therefore, the correct choice is 2, which states the fraction of A at θ=30° is 3/4 and the wavelength dependence is λ^{-6}.
