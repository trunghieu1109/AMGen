proposed answer: The problem requires estimating the minimum uncertainty in the energy (ΔE) of an electron moving at speed v = 2 × 10^8 m/s along the x-direction, given the uncertainty in position Δx = 0.1 nm. Using the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, Δx · Δp ≥ ħ/2, we calculate the minimum uncertainty in momentum Δp = ħ/(2Δx). Substituting ħ = 1.0545718 × 10^(-34) J·s and Δx = 1 × 10^(-10) m, we get Δp ≈ 5.27 × 10^(-25) kg·m/s. The electron's momentum p = m·v = 9.11 × 10^(-31) kg × 2 × 10^8 m/s = 1.822 × 10^(-22) kg·m/s. The kinetic energy E = p^2/(2m). To find ΔE, we use error propagation: ΔE ≈ |dE/dp| · Δp = (p/m) · Δp. Substituting values, ΔE ≈ (1.822 × 10^(-22) / 9.11 × 10^(-31)) × 5.27 × 10^(-25) ≈ 1.05 × 10^(-16) J. Although the electron speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light, relativistic corrections are not specified and would not drastically change the order of magnitude. Therefore, the closest matching choice to the calculated ΔE is ~10^(-16) J, which corresponds to choice C. This conclusion is consistent with quantum mechanical principles and the given data.
