proposed answer: The given metric is 
\[
ds^{2} = \frac{32}{4 - x^{2} - y^{2}} (dx^{2} + dy^{2})
\]
which is defined on the disk where the denominator is positive, i.e., \(x^{2} + y^{2} < 4\). The radius \(r=2\) corresponds to the boundary circle \(x^{2} + y^{2} = 4\), where the metric becomes singular. To find the area of the pseudosphere of radius 2, we compute the integral of the area element induced by the metric over the disk of radius 2.

The area element \(dA\) is given by the conformal factor times the Euclidean area element:
\[
dA = \sqrt{\det(g)} \, dx dy = \frac{32}{4 - r^{2}} dx dy
\]
where \(r^{2} = x^{2} + y^{2}\).

Switching to polar coordinates \((r, \theta)\), where \(dx dy = r dr d\theta\), the area integral becomes:
\[
A = \int_{0}^{2\pi} \int_{0}^{2} \frac{32}{4 - r^{2}} r dr d\theta
\]

Evaluating the inner integral:
\[
\int_{0}^{2} \frac{32 r}{4 - r^{2}} dr
\]

Make the substitution \(u = 4 - r^{2} \Rightarrow du = -2r dr\), so \(r dr = -\frac{du}{2}\). The limits change from \(r=0 \to u=4\) to \(r=2 \to u=0\). The integral becomes:
\[
\int_{u=4}^{0} \frac{32}{u} \left(-\frac{du}{2}\right) = -16 \int_{4}^{0} \frac{1}{u} du = 16 \int_{0}^{4} \frac{1}{u} du
\]

The integral \(\int_{0}^{4} \frac{1}{u} du\) diverges to infinity because of the singularity at \(u=0\) (which corresponds to \(r=2\)). Therefore, the area integral diverges, and the total area is infinite.

Among the provided answer choices, only choice A ('+\infty') matches this conclusion. The other choices are finite expressions or zero, which contradict the integral's divergence.

Hence, the area of the pseudosphere of radius 2 under the given metric is infinite.

Final answer in LaTeX:
\[
\boxed{\text{Area} = +\infty}
