Question: Example(question='Astronomers are studying two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2. Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.', choice1='~ 0.4', choice2='~ 0.7', choice3='~ 0.6\n', choice4='~ 1.2', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: To find the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we use the relation from Kepler's third law and the radial velocity amplitudes. The total mass M of a binary system is proportional to (K1 + K2)^3 * P, where K1 and K2 are the radial velocity amplitudes of the two stars, and P is the orbital period. For system_1, K1 + K2 = 10 + 5 = 15 km/s and P = 2 years. For system_2, K1 + K2 = 15 + 10 = 25 km/s and P = 1 year. Calculating the proportional masses: M1 ∝ 15^3 * 2 = 6750, M2 ∝ 25^3 * 1 = 15625. The ratio M1/M2 = 6750 / 15625 ≈ 0.432. This means system_1 is about 0.43 times as massive as system_2. Among the given choices, ~0.4 is the closest. This conclusion assumes circular orbits, edge-on inclination (justified by eclipses), and neglects eccentricity and third bodies. These assumptions are reasonable given the problem context. Therefore, the validated mass ratio is approximately 0.4, matching choice A.
