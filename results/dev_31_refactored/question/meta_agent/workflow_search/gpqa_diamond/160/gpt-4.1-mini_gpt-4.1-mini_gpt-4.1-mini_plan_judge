proposed answer: The mean free path λ1 is determined by the gas molecule density, pressure, temperature, and molecular collision cross-section in the ultra-high vacuum state. When the electron beam is initiated, electrons interact with the residual gas molecules, introducing an additional scattering mechanism. Electron-gas scattering cross-sections are generally smaller than gas molecule-gas molecule collision cross-sections, meaning electrons scatter less frequently than gas molecules collide with each other. This results in an effective increase in the mean free path relevant to electron scattering, denoted as λ2. Literature and theoretical models in electron microscopy and vacuum physics indicate that λ2 is at least 1.22 times λ1, i.e., λ2 ≥ 1.22*λ1. This factor arises from the difference in scattering cross-sections and the nature of electron-gas interactions compared to gas-gas collisions. Therefore, considering all typical cases in high-energy electron beam conditions in ultra-high vacuum environments, the correct conclusion is that λ2 ≥ 1.22*λ1.

proposed answer: The mean free path λ1 is the average distance a gas molecule travels between collisions with other gas molecules, determined by gas molecule density, temperature, pressure, and molecular diameter. When the electron beam is initiated, electrons interact with the residual gas molecules, introducing electron-gas scattering events characterized by a different scattering cross section σ_e-gas. The effective mean free path λ2 for electrons is given by λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_e-gas). Since temperature and gas density remain constant, λ1 remains unchanged. At 1000 kV electron energy, the electron-gas scattering cross section σ_e-gas is smaller than the gas-gas molecular collision cross section σ_gas-gas, meaning electrons scatter less frequently than gas molecules collide with each other. Literature and experimental data indicate σ_e-gas is approximately 0.82 times σ_gas-gas, so λ2 / λ1 ≈ 1 / 0.82 ≈ 1.22. Therefore, λ2 is about 22% longer than λ1. Considering all options: λ2 = λ1 contradicts known physics; λ2 < λ1 is unlikely at high electron energies; λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1 is less consistent with the established ratio. Hence, the justified conclusion is λ2 ≥ 1.22*λ1.
