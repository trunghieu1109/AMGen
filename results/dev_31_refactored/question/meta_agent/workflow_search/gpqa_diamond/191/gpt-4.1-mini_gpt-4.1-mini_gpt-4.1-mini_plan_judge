proposed answer: The problem involves a charge +q placed inside a cavity within an uncharged spherical conductor. According to electrostatics, the conductor shields the external region from any electric field due to charges inside the cavity. This is because induced charges on the conductor's surfaces rearrange to cancel the field outside. Therefore, the electric field at any point outside the conductor (distance L > R) is zero regardless of the cavity's position or the angle θ. The given expressions for the electric field magnitude do not account for this shielding effect and thus are incorrect. Hence, the correct magnitude of the electric field at point P outside the conductor is zero.

proposed answer: The problem involves a charge +q placed inside a cavity within an uncharged spherical conductor. The cavity is displaced from the conductor's center by a vector s, and the point P lies outside the conductor at a distance L from the conductor's center, with L > R. The distance from P to the cavity's center is l, and the angle between vectors l and s is θ. According to electrostatics principles, the conductor rearranges induced charges on its inner and outer surfaces such that the external electric field is equivalent to that of a point charge +q located at the conductor's center. This is a classical result stemming from the uniqueness theorem and the shielding effect of conductors: the external field depends only on the net enclosed charge and its effective position, which is the conductor's center. The displacement s of the cavity and the position of the charge inside the cavity do not affect the external field because the conductor shields the internal charge distribution. The external field must be spherically symmetric about the conductor's center and independent of the cavity's displacement or the angle θ. The expressions involving l, s, and θ imply directional dependence and dependence on the cavity's displacement, which contradicts the physical behavior of conductors in electrostatics. The correct expression for the magnitude of the electric field at point P outside the conductor is therefore given by Coulomb's law for a point charge +q at the conductor's center: E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q / L²). This expression satisfies all boundary conditions, including the behavior at large distances (field falls off as 1/L²), conductor neutrality (induced charges sum to zero net charge), and the shielding effect. Hence, the most consistent and physically correct answer is choice D.
