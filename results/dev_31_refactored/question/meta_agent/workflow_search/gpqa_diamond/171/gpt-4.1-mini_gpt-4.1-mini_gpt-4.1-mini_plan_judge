Question: Example(question='Two stars are being studied. It has been observed that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2. In fact, the energy difference between the considered energy levels was determined to be approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J. Assuming that the stellar photospheres are in LTE, which of these equations for the effective temperatures of the stars (T_1 and T_2) is correct?', choice1='ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]\n', choice2='ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]\n', choice3='ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n', choice4='ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: The problem involves two stars with effective temperatures T_1 and T_2, and the observed excitation ratio of iron atoms in a specific energy level between star_1 and star_2 is 2. Under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the population of atoms in an excited state follows the Boltzmann distribution: n ∝ exp(-ΔE/(kT)), where ΔE is the energy difference between the levels, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature. The ratio of populations in the excited state between the two stars is given by n_1/n_2 = exp(-ΔE/(kT_1)) / exp(-ΔE/(kT_2)) = exp[ΔE/k (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)]. Given n_1/n_2 = 2, taking the natural logarithm yields ln(2) = (ΔE/k)(1/T_2 - 1/T_1). The difference of inverse temperatures can be rewritten as (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2). Substituting back, ln(2) = (ΔE/k) * (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2). The candidate equations omit the factor ΔE/k, likely for simplicity or normalization, so the key functional form to match is ln(2) proportional to (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2). Among the given options, only choice 4 matches this form exactly: ln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2). The other options either have incorrect algebraic forms or incorrect placement of terms, such as addition instead of subtraction or squared denominators, which do not correspond to the difference of inverse temperatures. Therefore, choice 4 is the only candidate consistent with the Boltzmann distribution and the physical model of excitation under LTE. This conclusion holds regardless of the actual values of T_1 and T_2, as the derivation is general and based on fundamental statistical mechanics principles. Hence, the selected candidate equation (choice 4) is correct and consistent with physical principles and problem constraints.
