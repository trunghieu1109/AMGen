proposed answer: The problem involves determining the maximum speed of a relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass m, amplitude A, spring constant k, and speed of light c. The key physical constraint is that the maximum speed must not exceed the speed of light c. Among the four candidate formulas, we analyze each for physical and dimensional consistency and adherence to relativistic constraints. Formula 1 and Formula 3 predict speeds exceeding c, violating relativistic speed limits and/or are dimensionally inconsistent. Formula 4 is the classical formula without relativistic corrections and can exceed c for large amplitudes or stiff springs, thus not valid in the relativistic regime. Formula 2, however, ensures the expression inside the square root is between 0 and 1, guaranteeing v_max < c. It behaves correctly in the limits of small and large amplitudes, is dimensionally consistent, and respects relativistic constraints. Both independent analyses agree that Formula 2 is the only physically consistent and relativistically valid expression. Therefore, the final selected formula for the maximum speed is choice B: v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1 / (1 + (k A^2) / (2 m c^2))^2).
