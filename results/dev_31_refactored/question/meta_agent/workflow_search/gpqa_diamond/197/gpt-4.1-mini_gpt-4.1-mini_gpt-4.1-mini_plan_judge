Question: Example(question='We have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate, where the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M and the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16. What will be the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species in the solution? ', choice1='16.9%', choice2='42.3%', choice3='25.6%', choice4='38.1%', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Test New Architecture_197
proposed answer: The problem asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex Co(SCN)2 among all cobalt species in solution. Given the total cobalt concentration c(Co) = 10^-2 M and the SCN- concentration of 0.1 M, along with the cumulative stability constants β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16, the concentration of Co(SCN)2 was calculated to be 0.00169 M. The percentage is then (0.00169 / 0.01) * 100% = 16.9%. This matches choice 1 exactly. The calculation assumes the SCN- concentration remains effectively constant and that the stability constants are cumulative. Other species and their concentrations were considered to ensure the total cobalt concentration is conserved. Therefore, the closest matching choice is 16.9%, choice 1.
