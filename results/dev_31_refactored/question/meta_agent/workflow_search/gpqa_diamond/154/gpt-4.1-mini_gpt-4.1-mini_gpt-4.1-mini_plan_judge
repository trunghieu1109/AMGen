Question: Example(question='Imagine an operator $\\vec{P}$ of a system have components $P_x, P_y$ and $P_z$. The matrix form of the  operator $P_x$ has components in the first row as $(0, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,\\hbar/\\sqrt{2},0)$.  The matrix form of the  operator $P_y$ has components in the first row as $(0, -i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0, -i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2},0)$. Similarly, matrix form of the  operator $P_z$ has components in the first row as $(\\hbar, 0, 0)$, that in the second row as $(0, 0, 0)$ and that in the third row as $(0,0, -\\hbar)$. The basis vectors here are the eigenvectors of $P_z$. The system is found in the eigenstate of $P_x$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$. To be more specific, the explicit form of the state of the system is given by the column vector having elements $(-1/2, 1/\\sqrt{2}, -1/2)$. What is the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z $ of $P_z$', choice1='\\hbar\n', choice2='\\hbar/2', choice3='\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}\n', choice4='\\sqrt{2}\\hbar', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: The problem requires calculating the uncertainty ΔPz for the operator Pz when the system is in a given quantum state |ψ> expressed in the eigenbasis of Pz. The operator Pz is diagonal with eigenvalues ħ, 0, and -ħ corresponding to the basis vectors. The given state vector is |ψ> = (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). First, we verify normalization: the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the components is (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = 1, confirming the state is normalized. Next, calculate the expectation value <Pz>: <ψ|Pz|ψ> = ħ*(1/4) + 0*(1/2) + (-ħ)*(1/4) = ħ/4 - ħ/4 = 0. Then, calculate <Pz^2>: since Pz^2 is diagonal with eigenvalues ħ^2, 0, and ħ^2, <ψ|Pz^2|ψ> = ħ^2*(1/4) + 0*(1/2) + ħ^2*(1/4) = ħ^2/2. The uncertainty ΔPz is defined as ΔPz = sqrt(<Pz^2> - <Pz>^2) = sqrt(ħ^2/2 - 0) = ħ/√2. Multiple independent calculations and agent responses confirm this result. Alternative candidate answers (ħ, ħ/2, √2 ħ) do not match the computed value. The state vector and operators have been carefully verified, and the calculations are consistent with quantum mechanical definitions. Therefore, the best matching uncertainty value is ħ/√2, corresponding to choice C.
