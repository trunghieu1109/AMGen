proposed answer: The Hamiltonian operator is given by H = ε (σ · n), where σ are the Pauli spin matrices and n is a unit vector. The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. Since n is a unit vector, the operator σ · n also has eigenvalues ±1. Multiplying by ε scales these eigenvalues to ±ε. The Hamiltonian is Hermitian, so its eigenvalues must be real, which is consistent with ±ε. The factor ħ does not appear explicitly in the Hamiltonian, so it should not appear in the eigenvalues. Among the given choices, only choice A, ±ε, matches this result. Therefore, the correct eigenvalues are ±ε, corresponding to choice A.
