proposed answer: The pp-III branch of the solar proton-proton chain produces neutrinos primarily in the higher energy range, specifically contributing significantly to the 800-900 keV band (band 2). The 700-800 keV band (band 1) neutrinos mainly come from the pp-I and pp-II branches, which continue unaffected. When the pp-III branch stops, the flux in band 2 will drop drastically because it is dominated by pp-III neutrinos, while the flux in band 1 remains roughly the same. This causes the ratio Flux(band 1) / Flux(band 2) to increase significantly. Considering the given options, the ratio would be about 10, meaning the flux in band 1 is about ten times the flux in band 2 after the stoppage. Other options like 0.1 or 0.01 would imply the opposite effect, which contradicts the known energy spectra of neutrinos from the pp chain branches. The ratio being 1 would mean no change, which is not the case since the pp-III branch neutrinos are removed from band 2. Therefore, the correct approximate flux ratio after stopping the pp-III branch is 10.

proposed answer: The pp-III branch produces 8B neutrinos, which contribute significantly to the 700-800 keV energy band (band 1). The 800-900 keV band (band 2) is dominated by 7Be neutrinos from the pp-II branch, which remains unaffected by stopping the pp-III branch. When the pp-III branch stops, the flux of 8B neutrinos (band 1) drops significantly after the 8.5-minute neutrino travel time, while the flux in band 2 remains roughly constant. This causes the ratio Flux(band 1) / Flux(band 2) to decrease substantially, to about 0.1 (10^-1). Other options like 10 or 1 would imply band 1 flux remains equal or greater than band 2, which contradicts the disappearance of pp-III neutrinos. The 0.01 (10^-2) option would imply an even more drastic drop, which is less consistent with the partial contribution of other neutrino sources in band 1. Therefore, the best approximate ratio is 0.1 (10^-1).
