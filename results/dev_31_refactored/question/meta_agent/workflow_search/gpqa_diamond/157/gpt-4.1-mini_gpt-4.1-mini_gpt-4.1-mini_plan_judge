Question: Example(question='In an inactive state, a transcription factor subunit awaits an activation signal from the membrane phosphorylation cascade. Upon phosphorylation on the Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, shuttles into the nucleus, and serves in gene transcription. A missense mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. You observe that a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Which of the following molecular phenotypes is most likely observed in the presence of mutation Y?', choice1='loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype', choice2='protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype', choice3='protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele', choice4='change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Test New Architecture_157
proposed answer: Mutation Y is a heterozygous dominant-negative mutation in the dimerization domain of a transcription factor subunit. Dominant-negative mutations typically interfere with the function of the wild-type protein by forming nonfunctional complexes, especially in proteins that function as dimers or multimers. Since mutation Y is in the dimerization domain, the mutant protein likely retains the ability to bind the wild-type protein but forms nonfunctional dimers or aggregates. This interaction sequesters the wild-type protein, preventing it from performing its normal function, leading to a loss-of-function phenotype even when one wild-type allele is present. Option 1 (loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype) is inconsistent because if dimerization was lost, the mutant protein would not bind the wild-type protein and thus could not exert a dominant-negative effect. Option 3 (protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele) is less likely because if the mutant protein were degraded, it would be absent or reduced in amount, preventing it from interfering with the wild-type protein. Dominant-negative effects require the mutant protein to be stable enough to form nonfunctional complexes. Option 4 (change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype) contradicts the known dominant-negative, loss-of-function nature of mutation Y. Gain-of-function mutations typically enhance or create new functions, which is not consistent with the dominant-negative effect observed here. Option 2 (protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype) best fits the dominant-negative mechanism. The mutant protein forms nonfunctional dimers or aggregates with the wild-type protein, sequestering it and preventing normal transcriptional activation. This explains how the mutant allele dominantly interferes with the wild-type alleleâ€™s function. Therefore, the most plausible molecular phenotype observed in the presence of mutation Y is protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype.
