proposed answer: The IR spectrum shows a broad absorption from 3400–2500 cm⁻¹, characteristic of a carboxylic acid O-H stretch, and a strong absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicative of a carboxylic acid C=O stretch. The peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm⁻¹ correspond to aromatic C=C stretches, confirming the presence of a benzene ring. The 1H NMR spectrum shows a broad singlet at 10.5 ppm (1H), consistent with the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid. Two doublets at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm, each integrating to 2H, indicate a para-substituted benzene ring. The aliphatic signals at 2.9 ppm (multiplet, 1H), 1.7 ppm (multiplet, 2H), 1.4 ppm (doublet, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (triplet, 3H) match the pattern expected for a sec-butyl group attached to the aromatic ring. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI is known to cause reductive decarboxylation of aromatic carboxylic acids, removing the carboxyl group and yielding alkylbenzenes. Therefore, the starting compound is para-sec-butylbenzoic acid, and the reaction removes the acid group, leaving a para-sec-butylbenzene derivative. Among the given options, only 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene (Choice A) is an alkylbenzene with a sec-butyl substituent. The methyl group in the name likely represents the position formerly occupied by the acid group, now replaced by hydrogen after decarboxylation. The other options either retain the acid group or have different alkyl substituents inconsistent with the spectral data and reaction outcome. This interpretation is consistent with the spectral data, the known reaction mechanism of red phosphorus and HI on aromatic carboxylic acids, and the given options. No other candidate fits all the spectral features and reaction conditions as well as Choice A does. Thus, the final product is best identified as 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.
