Question: Example(question='You are studying a nuclear decay which converts two heavy nucleons of flavor A to another flavor B, while simultaneously emitting two much lighter particles E and V. In short, 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V. It is known that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous, with some endpoint value Q.\n\nA variant of this decay emits one exotic, massless particle M instead of the 2V. In this case, how does the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles compare to that of the original decay?', choice1='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint increases.', choice2='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases.', choice3='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.', choice4='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint decreases.', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: The original decay 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V involves four emitted particles, with the two E particles sharing energy with the two V particles. This results in a continuous energy spectrum for the E particles due to the multiple ways energy can be distributed among the emitted particles. The endpoint Q is limited by the total energy available minus the rest mass energies of the other emitted particles (the two V particles). In the variant decay 2A -> 2B + 2E + M, the two V particles are replaced by a single massless particle M. This reduces the number of emitted particles from four to three and removes the rest mass energy contribution from the emitted non-E particles, since M is massless. Because M is massless, it can carry away energy without any rest mass energy cost, effectively increasing the maximum energy that the two E particles can share. The energy spectrum remains continuous because there are still two E particles sharing energy, and the massless M particle's energy can vary continuously, preserving multiple degrees of freedom in energy sharing. The spectrum does not become discrete because the system still has continuous variables for energy distribution. The endpoint of the E particle energy spectrum increases compared to the original decay because the massless M particle allows more energy to be available to the E particles. Other options suggesting the spectrum becomes discrete or that the endpoint decreases contradict the physical principles of energy conservation and phase space considerations. Therefore, the most physically consistent and correct answer is that the spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.
