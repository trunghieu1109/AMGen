proposed answer: The problem states that the number of stars varies with parallax (plx) as 1/plx^5. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance (r), i.e., plx ∝ 1/r. We can write plx = k/r for some constant k. Substituting this into the star count relation, the cumulative number of stars N ∝ 1/(plx^5) = 1/((k/r)^5) = r^5/k^5, which simplifies to N ∝ r^5. This means the cumulative number of stars up to distance r increases as r^5. However, the question asks for the number of stars per unit range of distance r, i.e., the differential number of stars dN/dr. Differentiating N with respect to r gives dN/dr ∝ 5r^4. Therefore, the number of stars per unit distance interval varies as r^4. This conclusion assumes that the given star count relation is cumulative with respect to parallax and that the parallax-distance inverse proportionality holds exactly. It also assumes a uniform angular region of the sky and that the star distribution is such that the given relation holds. Other scenarios, such as non-uniform distributions or different definitions of star count, could change the result, but given the problem statement and the standard assumptions, the number of stars per unit distance range varies approximately as r^4. This matches choice B.

proposed answer: The problem states that the number of stars per unit parallax interval varies as 1/plx^5. Since parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance (r), i.e., plx = k/r for some constant k, substituting this into the expression gives dN/dplx ∝ (r/k)^5 = r^5/k^5, so dN/dplx ∝ r^5. To find the number of stars per unit distance interval, dN/dr, we apply the chain rule: dN/dr = dN/dplx * |dplx/dr|. Differentiating plx = k/r with respect to r yields dplx/dr = -k/r^2, so |dplx/dr| = k/r^2. Therefore, dN/dr ∝ r^5 * (k/r^2) = k * r^3. Ignoring constants, the number of stars per unit distance interval varies as r^3. This matches choice C (~ r^3). This result is physically consistent because the number of stars in a shell at distance r is expected to scale with the volume element, which is proportional to r^2, and the given parallax dependence modifies this to r^3. Other choices (~ r^2, ~ r^4, ~ r^5) do not correctly incorporate the derivative factor |dplx/dr| and thus do not match the derived relationship. Hence, the correct choice is C.
