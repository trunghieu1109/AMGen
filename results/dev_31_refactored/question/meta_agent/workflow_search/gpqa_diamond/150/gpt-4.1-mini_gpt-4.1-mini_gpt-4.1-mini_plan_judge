Question: Example(question='The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1). An observable of the system is represented by the matrix operator P having elements in the first row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0),  in the second row as (1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}) and in the third row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0). Calculate the probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 at time t.', choice1='1/3\n', choice2='2/3\n', choice3='\\sqrt{2/3}\n', choice4='1', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: The calculated probability is derived by first normalizing the given state vector, which is essential in quantum mechanics since state vectors must be normalized to have total probability 1. The norm of the state vector (-1, 2, 1) is sqrt(6), and the normalized state vector is ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ). Next, the eigenspace corresponding to eigenvalue 0 of the observable P is found by solving P v = 0. The eigenvector found is (1, 0, -1), which is normalized to (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)). The projection operator onto this eigenspace is constructed as the outer product of this normalized eigenvector with itself. The probability of measuring eigenvalue 0 is the squared magnitude of the projection of the normalized state vector onto this eigenspace, which is |<u|phi>|^2. The inner product <u|phi> is calculated as (-1/sqrt(6))*(1/sqrt(2)) + (2/sqrt(6))*0 + (1/sqrt(6))*(-1/sqrt(2)) = -1/sqrt(3). Squaring this gives 1/3. This is consistent with quantum mechanical principles: the probability of measuring an eigenvalue is the squared modulus of the projection of the normalized state vector onto the eigenspace of that eigenvalue. The eigenspace is one-dimensional, so the projection is onto a single normalized eigenvector. The calculation is mathematically correct and physically consistent. Alternative cases, such as degenerate eigenspaces or non-normalized states, are not applicable here since the eigenspace is one-dimensional and the state vector was properly normalized before projection. Therefore, the probability 1/3 is correct and consistent with quantum mechanics.
