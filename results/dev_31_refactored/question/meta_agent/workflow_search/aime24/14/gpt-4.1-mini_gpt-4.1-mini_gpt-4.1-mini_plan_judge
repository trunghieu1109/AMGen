Question: Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.

proposed answer: The problem involves finding the supremum of BD^2 for rhombi ABCD inscribed in the hyperbola x^2/20 - y^2/24 = 1, with diagonals intersecting at the origin. Points A and C are symmetric about the origin, as are B and D, so we represent them as A=(x1,y1), C=(-x1,-y1), B=(x2,y2), D=(-x2,-y2). Both points lie on the hyperbola, so x_i^2/20 - y_i^2/24 = 1 for i=1,2. The rhombus condition requires the diagonals to be perpendicular, so their dot product is zero: x1*x2 + y1*y2 = 0. Using the hyperbola equation, y_i^2 = 24(x_i^2/20 - 1) = (6/5)x_i^2 - 24. Substituting into BD^2 = 4(x2^2 + y2^2) gives BD^2 = 4(x2^2 + (6/5)x2^2 - 24) = 4((11/5)x2^2 - 24) = (44/5)x2^2 - 96. The perpendicularity condition squared leads to an algebraic relation between x1^2 and x2^2: 0.44 x1^2 x2^2 - 28.8(x1^2 + x2^2) + 576 = 0. Setting X = x1^2 and Y = x2^2, we solve for Y: Y = (28.8 X - 576) / (0.44 X - 28.8). Since points lie on the hyperbola, x_i^2 ≥ 20. As X → ∞, Y approaches approximately 65.4545. Substituting back into BD^2 yields BD^2 → (44/5)*65.4545 - 96 ≈ 480. This value is a supremum: BD^2 can approach 480 from below but cannot reach or exceed it for any such rhombus. Alternative values like 176 arise from incorrect assumptions or parametrizations. The detailed algebraic derivation, domain restrictions, and limit analysis confirm 480 as the greatest real number less than BD^2 for all such rhombi. Therefore, the supremum of BD^2 is 480.
