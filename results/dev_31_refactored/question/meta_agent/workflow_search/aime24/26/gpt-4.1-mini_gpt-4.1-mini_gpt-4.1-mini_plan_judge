Question: Alice chooses a set $A$ of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets $B$ of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of $B$ belongs to $A$. Bob's list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A.
Iteration: Test New Architecture_26
proposed answer: We are given that the total number of sets B is 2024, where each set B is a finite nonempty subset of positive integers with the property that max(B) âˆˆ A. For each a in A, the number of such sets B with max(B) = a is 2^(a-1). Therefore, the total number of sets B is the sum over all a in A of 2^(a-1). This gives the equation: sum_{a in A} 2^(a-1) = 2024. Since 2^(a-1) are distinct powers of two, the sum corresponds to a unique subset of powers of two that add up to 2024. To find A, we express 2024 in binary and identify which powers of two are present. 2024 in binary is 111111001000. Writing out the powers of two corresponding to each bit: 2^10 + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^3 = 2024. These correspond to a-1 = 10,9,8,7,6,5,3, so a = 11,10,9,8,7,6,4. Thus, A = {4,6,7,8,9,10,11}. The sum of elements of A is 4 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 = 55. This is the unique solution because the sum of distinct powers of two uniquely determines the set A. Hence, the sum of the elements of A is 55.
