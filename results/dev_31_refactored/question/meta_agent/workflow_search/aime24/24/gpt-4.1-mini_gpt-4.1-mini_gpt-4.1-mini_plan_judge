Question: Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations:
\[\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}\]\[\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}\]\[\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}\]
Then the value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: The problem involves solving a system of logarithmic equations to find the values of log2(x), log2(y), and log2(z), denoted as a, b, and c respectively. From the given equations, we have: log2(x/(yz)) = 1/2, log2(y/(xz)) = 1/3, and log2(z/(xy)) = 1/4. These can be rewritten in terms of a, b, and c as: a - b - c = 1/2, b - a - c = 1/3, and c - a - b = 1/4. Solving this system yields a = -7/24, b = -3/8, and c = -5/12. The expression to evaluate is |log2(x^4 y^3 z^2)| = |4a + 3b + 2c|. Substituting the values, we get 4*(-7/24) + 3*(-3/8) + 2*(-5/12) = -28/24 - 27/24 - 20/24 = -75/24. Taking the absolute value gives 75/24, which simplifies to 25/8 since 75 and 24 share a common factor of 3. The fraction 25/8 is in lowest terms as 25 and 8 are relatively prime. Therefore, m = 25 and n = 8, and m + n = 33. This solution is consistent with the problem's conditions and the positivity of x, y, and z. No alternative cases arise because the logarithms and variables are well-defined and positive, ensuring the validity of the solution.
