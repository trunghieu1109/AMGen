Question: Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.
Iteration: Test New Architecture_6
proposed answer: The problem requires finding p + q where r^2 = p/q is the reduced fraction representing the square of the radius of the smallest sphere containing all rectangular boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23. From the previous sub-task, we have determined that r^2 = 657/64. This fraction is already in lowest terms since 657 and 64 share no common factors. Therefore, p = 657 and q = 64. Adding these gives p + q = 657 + 64 = 721. This result is consistent with the constraints and the optimization problem solved using Lagrange multipliers and symmetry assumptions. Hence, the final answer is 721.
