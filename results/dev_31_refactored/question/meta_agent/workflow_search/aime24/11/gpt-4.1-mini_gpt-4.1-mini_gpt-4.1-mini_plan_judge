Question: Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.

proposed answer: The problem is to count the number of lattice paths from (0,0) to (8,8) consisting of 8 right (R) moves and 8 up (U) moves, with exactly four direction changes. A direction change occurs when the path switches from R to U or from U to R. Since the path has length 16 with 8 Rs and 8 Us, the total number of direction changes can range from 0 (all Rs then all Us or vice versa) up to 15 (alternating every step). Here, exactly four direction changes means the path is composed of exactly five runs of moves alternating between R and U. The runs alternate directions, so the sequence of runs is either R-U-R-U-R or U-R-U-R-U. In the first case, there are 3 runs of R moves and 2 runs of U moves; in the second case, 3 runs of U moves and 2 runs of R moves. Each run has positive length, and the sum of the lengths of the R runs is 8, and similarly for the U runs. The number of positive integer solutions to partition 8 into 3 parts is C(7,2) = 21, and into 2 parts is C(7,1) = 7. For the first case, total sequences = 21 * 7 = 147. For the second case, total sequences = 21 * 7 = 147. Summing both cases gives 294 sequences. This count includes all sequences with exactly four direction changes, as required. Therefore, the final number of such paths is 294.
