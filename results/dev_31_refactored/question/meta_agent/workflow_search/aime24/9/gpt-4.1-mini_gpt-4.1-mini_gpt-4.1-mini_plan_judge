Question: Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: Jen chooses 4 distinct numbers from a set of 10 numbers. The lottery also randomly chooses 4 distinct numbers from the same set. The total number of 4-number combinations from 10 numbers is C(10,4) = 210. Jen wins a prize if at least 2 of her chosen numbers are among the 4 drawn numbers. The number of ways the drawn numbers can have exactly k matches with Jen's chosen numbers is C(4,k)*C(6,4-k), where 6 is the number of numbers not chosen by Jen. For k=2, this is C(4,2)*C(6,2) = 6*15 = 90; for k=3, C(4,3)*C(6,1) = 4*6 = 24; for k=4, C(4,4)*C(6,0) = 1*1 = 1. So, the total number of favorable outcomes for winning a prize (at least 2 matches) is 90 + 24 + 1 = 115. The probability of winning the grand prize (all 4 match) is 1/210. The probability of winning a prize is 115/210. The conditional probability of winning the grand prize given winning a prize is (1/210) / (115/210) = 1/115. The fraction 1/115 is already in lowest terms, so m=1 and n=115. Therefore, m+n=116.
