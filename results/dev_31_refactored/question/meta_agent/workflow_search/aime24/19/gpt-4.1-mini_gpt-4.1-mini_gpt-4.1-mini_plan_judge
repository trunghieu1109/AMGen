Question: Let $\omega\neq 1$ be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\]
is divided by 1000.
Iteration: Test New Architecture_19
proposed answer: The problem asks for the remainder when the product \( \prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) \) is divided by 1000, where \( \omega \) is a primitive 13th root of unity. The expression inside the product can be rewritten as \( f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2 \) evaluated at \( x = \omega^k \). The product over all 13th roots of unity of \( f(x) \) equals the resultant \( \text{Res}_x(f(x), x^{13} - 1) \), which can be computed as the product of \( x^{13} - 1 \) evaluated at the roots of \( f(x) \). The roots of \( f(x) \) are \( 1 + i \) and \( 1 - i \). Thus, the product equals \( ((1+i)^{13} - 1)((1 - i)^{13} - 1) \). Using polar form, \( 1+i = \sqrt{2} e^{i\pi/4} \), so \( (1+i)^{13} = 2^{6.5} e^{i 13 \pi/4} = 2^{6.5} e^{i (3\pi + \pi/4)} = 2^{6.5} e^{i \pi/4} \) because \( e^{i 3\pi} = -1 \) and the angle reduces modulo \( 2\pi \). Similarly, \( (1 - i)^{13} = 2^{6.5} e^{-i \pi/4} \). Then, \( ((1+i)^{13} - 1)((1 - i)^{13} - 1) = |2^{6.5} e^{i \pi/4} - 1|^2 \). Calculating the magnitude squared: \( |2^{6.5} e^{i \pi/4} - 1|^2 = (2^{6.5})^2 - 2 \cdot 2^{6.5} \cos(\pi/4) + 1 = 2^{13} - 2^{7.5} \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + 1 \). Since \( 2^{7.5} = 128 \sqrt{2} \), the middle term simplifies to 256. So the product is \( 8192 - 256 + 1 = 7937 \). Finally, modulo 1000, the remainder is \( 7937 \mod 1000 = 937 \). This detailed step-by-step reasoning confirms the product modulo 1000 is 937.

proposed answer: The problem asks for the remainder when the product \( \prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) \) is divided by 1000, where \( \omega \) is a 13th root of unity and \( \omega \neq 1 \). The product includes the term for \( k=0 \), which corresponds to \( \omega^0 = 1 \), so the product is over all 13th roots of unity including 1. The expression inside the product can be rewritten as \( f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2 = (x-1)^2 + 1 \). The product over all roots of unity of \( f(\omega^k) \) can be expressed as the product of \( (\omega^k - (1+i)) \) and \( (\omega^k - (1 - i)) \) over all \( k \), since the roots of \( f(x) = 0 \) are \( 1 \pm i \). Using the fact that \( \prod_{k=0}^{12} (a - \omega^k) = a^{13} - 1 \) and adjusting for sign, the product simplifies to \( ((1+i)^{13} - 1)((1 - i)^{13} - 1) \). From previous calculations, \( (1+i)^{13} = -64 - 64i \) and \( (1 - i)^{13} = -64 + 64i \). Substituting and multiplying gives \( 8321 \), and taking modulo 1000 yields \( 321 \). This is the remainder when the product is divided by 1000. All steps are consistent and consider the inclusion of \( k=0 \) term, the properties of roots of unity, and complex conjugates. Therefore, the final answer is 321.
