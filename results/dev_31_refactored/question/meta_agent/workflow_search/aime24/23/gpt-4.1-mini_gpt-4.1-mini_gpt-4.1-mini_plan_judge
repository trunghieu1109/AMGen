Question: Find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid so that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is $999$, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is $99$. The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$.
\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\ \hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\ \hline \end{array}\]

proposed answer: We are given a 2x3 grid with digits a,b,c in the first row and d,e,f in the second row. The conditions are:
1) The sum of the two 3-digit numbers formed by the rows equals 999:
   (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999
2) The sum of the three 2-digit numbers formed by the columns equals 99:
   (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99

Step 1: Analyze the row sum condition.
Since the sum is 999, and each digit is 0-9, the only way to get 999 without carryover is if the digits in corresponding positions sum to 9 exactly:
   a + d = 9
   b + e = 9
   c + f = 9

Step 2: Express d,e,f in terms of a,b,c:
   d = 9 - a
   e = 9 - b
   f = 9 - c

Step 3: Substitute into the column sum condition:
   (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) =
   (10a + 9 - a) + (10b + 9 - b) + (10c + 9 - c) =
   (9a + 9) + (9b + 9) + (9c + 9) =
   9(a + b + c) + 27

Step 4: Given the column sum equals 99:
   9(a + b + c) + 27 = 99
   => 9(a + b + c) = 72
   => a + b + c = 8

Step 5: Since a,b,c are digits 0-9 and sum to 8, and d,e,f are determined by 9 minus these digits, all digits are valid (0-9).

Step 6: Count the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c = 8 with 0 ≤ a,b,c ≤ 9.
Since 8 ≤ 9, no upper bound constraints are violated.
The number of solutions is given by the stars and bars theorem:
   C(8 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(10, 2) = 45

Step 7: Each such triple (a,b,c) uniquely determines (d,e,f) and thus a unique valid grid satisfying both conditions.

Therefore, the total number of valid digit assignments satisfying all problem constraints is 45.

proposed answer: The problem requires counting the number of valid digit assignments in a 2x3 grid where the sum of the two row-formed numbers equals 999 and the sum of the three column-formed numbers equals 99. Each cell contains a digit from 0 to 9. The row sum condition translates to (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999, and the column sum condition translates to (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99, where a,b,c are digits in the top row and d,e,f in the bottom row. Analyzing the row sum digit-wise with carries u0 and u1, only the carry case u0=0 and u1=0 is valid, leading to c + f = 9, b + e = 9, a + d = 9. Substituting d=9 - a, e=9 - b, f=9 - c into the column sum condition yields 9(a + b + c) + 27 = 99, so a + b + c = 8. Counting the number of nonnegative integer solutions to a + b + c = 8 with each digit ≤ 9 is C(8+3-1,3-1) = C(10,2) = 45. Each such triple (a,b,c) uniquely determines (d,e,f) = (9 - a, 9 - b, 9 - c), all digits valid in 0..9. This satisfies all constraints: digit ranges, carry consistency, and sum conditions. The example given fits this pattern. Therefore, the total number of valid digit assignments is 45. This count is complete and verified, considering all possible carry cases and digit constraints, ensuring no valid solutions are missed or invalid ones counted.
