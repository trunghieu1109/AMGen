Question: There exist real numbers $x$ and $y$, both greater than 1, such that $\log_x\left(y^x\right)=\log_y\left(x^{4y}\right)=10$. Find $xy$.

proposed answer: From the previous sub-task, we have derived that y = 25 / x and that x satisfies the transcendental equation x * ln(25 / x) = 10 * ln(x). We want to find the value of xy. Since y = 25 / x, the product xy = x * (25 / x) = 25. This is independent of the exact value of x, as long as the relation y = 25 / x holds. The transcendental equation ensures the consistency of the system, but the product xy is fixed at 25. Both x and y are greater than 1, and since 25 / x > 1, x must be less than 25, which is consistent with the domain. Therefore, the value of xy is 25.
