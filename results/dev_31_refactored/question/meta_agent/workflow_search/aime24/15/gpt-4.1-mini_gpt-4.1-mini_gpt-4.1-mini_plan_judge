Question: Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.

proposed answer: The problem involves four items: diamond ring (D), golf clubs (G), garden spade (S), and candy hearts (C). Candy hearts are owned by all 900 residents, so every resident owns candy hearts. Therefore, the problem reduces to analyzing the ownership of D, G, and S. We define: a = number of residents owning exactly one of D, G, S; b = number owning exactly two of D, G, S; c = number owning all three of D, G, S (which corresponds to owning all four items including candy hearts). Given: a = 437 (exactly two items including candy hearts means exactly one of D, G, S), b = 234 (exactly three items including candy hearts means exactly two of D, G, S), and c = x (the number we want). The sum of owners of D, G, and S is 195 + 367 + 562 = 1124. Each resident owning exactly one of D, G, S contributes 1 to this sum, those owning exactly two contribute 2, and those owning all three contribute 3. So, 1124 = a + 2b + 3c = 437 + 2*234 + 3x = 905 + 3x. Solving for x gives 3x = 219, so x = 73. This is consistent with the problem's conditions and accounts for all ownership distributions. Therefore, the number of residents owning all four items is 73.
