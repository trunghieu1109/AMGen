Question: Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.

proposed answer: The problem is a classic impartial combinatorial game where two players alternately remove either 1 or 4 tokens from a pile of n tokens. Alice moves first, and the player who removes the last token wins. We want to find the number of positive integers n ≤ 2024 for which Bob (the second player) has a winning strategy regardless of Alice's moves. To analyze this, we classify positions as winning or losing for the player about to move. A position is losing if all moves lead to winning positions for the opponent, and winning if there exists at least one move to a losing position. The base case is n=0, which is losing since no moves can be made. For n>0, the possible moves are removing 1 or 4 tokens, so from position n, the next positions are n-1 and n-4 (if n-4 ≥ 0). We analyze small values: n=0 losing; n=1 moves to 0 (losing), so n=1 winning; n=2 moves to 1 (winning), so n=2 losing; n=3 moves to 2 (losing), so n=3 winning; n=4 moves to 3 (winning) and 0 (losing), so n=4 winning; n=5 moves to 4 (winning) and 1 (winning), so n=5 losing. This pattern repeats every 5 numbers, with losing positions exactly when n mod 5 = 0 or 2. This is because from these positions, all moves lead to winning positions, and from other positions, there is at least one move to a losing position. Since Alice moves first, if the initial n is losing (n mod 5 = 0 or 2), Bob can guarantee a win regardless of Alice's moves. To count such n ≤ 2024, we count numbers congruent to 0 or 2 modulo 5. The number of multiples of 5 up to 2024 is floor(2024/5) = 404. The number of integers congruent to 2 mod 5 up to 2024 is also 404 (sequence 2,7,12,...,2022). Adding these gives 404 + 404 = 808. Therefore, there are 808 positive integers n ≤ 2024 for which Bob has a guaranteed winning strategy. This reasoning is complete, consistent, and covers all cases.

Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.
Iteration: Test New Architecture_8
proposed answer: The problem asks for the count of positive integers n ≤ 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy. From the game analysis, the losing positions for the first player (Alice) are those where n ≡ 0 (mod 5) or n ≡ 2 (mod 5). These losing positions correspond to the initial states where Bob, moving second, can force a win regardless of Alice's moves.

From stage_2.subtask_1, the counts of such losing positions are:
- For n ≡ 0 (mod 5): count = floor(2024/5) = 404
- For n ≡ 2 (mod 5): count = floor((2024 - 2)/5) + 1 = 405

Summing these gives 404 + 405 = 809.

Stage_2.subtask_2 verifies the counting method by enumerating counts for all residue classes modulo 5 and summing them to 2024, confirming no off-by-one or counting errors. The counts for residues 0 through 4 are consistent and sum exactly to 2024.

Therefore, the total number of positive integers n ≤ 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy is 809. This conclusion is robust because:
1. The losing positions pattern is proven and well-established.
2. The counting formula for arithmetic progressions with given residues modulo 5 is correctly applied.
3. The verification step confirms the correctness of the counting method and the absence of enumeration errors.

Hence, the final answer is 809.
