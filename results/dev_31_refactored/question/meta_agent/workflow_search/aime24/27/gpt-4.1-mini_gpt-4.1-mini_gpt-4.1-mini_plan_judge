Question: Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.

proposed answer: We are given a four-digit number N = a b c d such that changing any one digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. This means the following four numbers must be divisible by 7: 1 b c d, a 1 c d, a b 1 d, a b c 1. Using modular arithmetic modulo 7, and the fact that 1000 ≡ 6, 100 ≡ 2, and 10 ≡ 3 (mod 7), these conditions translate into congruences on digits a,b,c,d. From the system, the digits satisfy: a ≡ 5 (mod 7), b ≡ 6 (mod 7), c ≡ 2 (mod 7), d ≡ 4 (mod 7). Since digits range from 0 to 9, the possible digits are: a = 5 (only 5 satisfies a ≡ 5 mod 7 and is valid as leading digit), b = 6 (6 satisfies b ≡ 6 mod 7), c = 2 or 9 (both 2 and 9 ≡ 2 mod 7), d = 4 (only 4 fits d ≡ 4 mod 7). We want the greatest such number N, so we check candidates 5624 and 5924. Testing 5624: replacing each digit by 1 yields numbers 1624, 5124, 5614, 5621, all divisible by 7. Testing 5924: replacing the first digit by 1 yields 1924, which is not divisible by 7, so 5924 is invalid. Therefore, the greatest valid number N is 5624. Dividing 5624 by 1000 gives quotient Q = 5 and remainder R = 624. Their sum Q + R = 629. This reasoning is consistent with modular arithmetic constraints, digit validity, and divisibility checks for all digit replacements. Hence, the answer is 629.
