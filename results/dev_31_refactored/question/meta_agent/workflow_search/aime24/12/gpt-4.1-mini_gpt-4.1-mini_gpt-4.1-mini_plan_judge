Iteration: Test New Architecture_12
proposed answer: From the previous sub-task, we have the real part of the expression as Re = A cos\theta + B sin\theta, where A = 556 cos(0.9948) + 43.25 cos(0.9828) and B = -556 sin(0.9948) + 43.25 sin(0.9828). This is a linear combination of cosine and sine functions of \theta, which can be rewritten as Re = R cos(\theta - \phi), where R = \sqrt{A^2 + B^2} and \phi = \arctan(B/A). The maximum value of Re is R, achieved when \theta = \phi. To find the argument of z that maximizes the real part, we set \theta = \phi. Calculating A and B numerically: cos(0.9948) \approx 0.545, sin(0.9948) \approx 0.838, cos(0.9828) \approx 0.555, sin(0.9828) \approx 0.832. Then A = 556*0.545 + 43.25*0.555 = 302.62 + 24.00 = 326.62 approximately. B = -556*0.838 + 43.25*0.832 = -465.93 + 35.99 = -429.94 approximately. Then R = \sqrt{326.62^2 + (-429.94)^2} = \sqrt{106666 + 184849} = \sqrt{291515} \approx 540. This is the maximum real part. The argument \theta that maximizes the real part is \phi = \arctan(B/A) = \arctan(-429.94/326.62) \approx -0.92 radians (or equivalently, adding 2\pi to get a positive angle). Thus, the argument of z that maximizes the real part is approximately -0.92 radians, and the maximum real part is approximately 540. This approach considers all possible \theta in [0, 2\pi), ensuring the global maximum is found. The maximum real part corresponds to the amplitude R of the sinusoidal function representing the real part as a function of \theta.
