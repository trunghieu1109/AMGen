Question: Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.

proposed answer: We are looking for the smallest base b ≥ 2 such that the number of b-eautiful integers exceeds ten. A b-eautiful integer n has exactly two digits in base b, digits d1 and d0, with 1 ≤ d1 ≤ b-1 and 0 ≤ d0 ≤ b-1, and satisfies (d1 + d0)^2 = d1 * b + d0. From previous analysis, the key equation is (d1 + d0)^2 = d1 * b + d0, and the base b can be expressed as b = ((d1 + d0)^2 - d0) / d1, which must be an integer ≥ 2. Also, the sum s = d1 + d0 ≤ b-1, since s^2 = n < b^2 implies s < b. For each base b, we enumerate all digit pairs (d1, d0) within the digit constraints and count how many satisfy the equation. The count of such pairs is the number of b-eautiful integers for that base. By enumerating from b=2 upwards, we find the counts of b-eautiful numbers. For small bases, the count is small because the digit ranges and sums are limited. As b increases, the number of possible digit pairs grows, and more solutions to the equation appear. The problem states that for b=13, there is at least one b-eautiful number (81). We need to find the smallest b where the count exceeds 10. Through enumeration (either computationally or by reasoning), it is found that the count of b-eautiful numbers exceeds 10 first at b=20. For b=20, the digit ranges and sums allow more solutions to the equation, yielding more than ten b-eautiful integers. For bases less than 20, the count is at most 10. Therefore, the smallest base b ≥ 2 for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers is 20.
