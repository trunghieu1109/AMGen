Question: There exist real numbers $x$ and $y$, both greater than 1, such that $\log_x\left(y^x\right)=\log_y\left(x^{4y}\right)=10$. Find $xy$.
proposed answer: Given that x = 10 and y = 10 from the previous sub-task, the product xy can be calculated directly as 10 * 10 = 100. This is a straightforward multiplication of the found values.
