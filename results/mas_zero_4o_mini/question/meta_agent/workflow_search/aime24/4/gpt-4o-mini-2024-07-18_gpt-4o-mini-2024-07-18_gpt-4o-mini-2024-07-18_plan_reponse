After checking values systematically, I found that m = 2 satisfies the condition. However, I need to ensure that this is indeed the smallest positive integer that meets the requirement.\n\nAnswer:2\n[TOO_HARD]\nSuggestion: Verify the calculations for m = 1 and m = 2 to ensure that m = 2 is indeed the smallest positive integer such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 25.",
