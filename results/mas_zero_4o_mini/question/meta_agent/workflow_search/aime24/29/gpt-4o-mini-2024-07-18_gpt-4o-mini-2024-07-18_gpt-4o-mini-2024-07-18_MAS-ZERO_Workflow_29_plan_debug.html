    <pre>Related original question:

There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\times5$ grid such that: 

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 1: Determine the maximum number of rows and columns that can be filled with chips of a single color without violating the conditions. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent M3UX:
The problem involves filling a grid with chips under specific conditions. To determine the maximum number of rows and columns that can be filled with chips of a single color, we need to consider the constraints of the grid and the indistinguishable nature of the chips. However, the exact calculation requires a deeper combinatorial analysis that may not be straightforward.

Suggestion: A detailed combinatorial analysis or a breakdown of the filling strategy for the grid.

### Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1, calculate the total number of chips that can be placed without violating the conditions. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent RUbi:
Based on sub-task 1, we can fill the maximum of 5 rows and 5 columns with chips of a single color. Since each row and column can contain only one color, if we fill all 5 rows with one color and 5 columns with the same color, we can place a maximum of 5 chips in one color. However, the problem states that we need to consider the conditions for both colors. To find the total number of chips that can be placed without violating the conditions, we need to analyze how many chips of each color can be placed in accordance with the grid&#39;s constraints. This involves combinatorial reasoning about how many rows and columns can be filled simultaneously without overlapping colors, which is not straightforward.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent RUbi:

Suggestion: A detailed breakdown of how to fill the grid while respecting the conditions for both colors.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 3: Based on the outputs of sub-task 1 and 2, verify that the placement is optimal and any additional chip would violate the conditions.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry (for example, 300

    <pre>To verify that the placement is optimal, we need to consider the constraints of the grid and the maximum number of chips that can be placed without violating the conditions. Since we can fill all 5 rows and 5 columns with chips of a single color, the total number of chips placed is 25. If we attempt to add any additional chip, it would either require filling another row or column with a different color, which would violate the conditions. Therefore, the placement is indeed optimal.
