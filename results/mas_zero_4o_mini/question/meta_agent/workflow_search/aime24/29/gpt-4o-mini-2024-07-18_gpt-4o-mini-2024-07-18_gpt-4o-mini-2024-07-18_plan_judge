Question: There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\times5$ grid such that: 

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.
proposed answer: To verify that the placement is optimal, we need to consider the constraints of the grid and the maximum number of chips that can be placed without violating the conditions. Since we can fill all 5 rows and 5 columns with chips of a single color, the total number of chips placed is 25. If we attempt to add any additional chip, it would either require filling another row or column with a different color, which would violate the conditions. Therefore, the placement is indeed optimal.

Answer:25

Suggestion: A detailed analysis of the placement strategy and verification of the conditions for both colors.
Extracted answer: 25
Correct answer: 902
