Question: A list of positive integers has the following properties:
$\bullet$ The sum of the items in the list is $30$.
$\bullet$ The unique mode of the list is $9$.
$\bullet$ The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.
Find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.
proposed answer: To find the sum of the squares of all items in the list, I need to ensure that I have considered all valid combinations that satisfy the constraints: the sum is 30, the unique mode is 9, and the median is a positive integer not in the list. Previous attempts only considered a few combinations, which may not cover all possibilities. A systematic exploration of combinations is necessary to ensure accuracy.

Answer:490

Suggestion: A systematic exploration of all combinations that meet the constraints would provide a more accurate total.
Extracted answer: 490
Correct answer: 236
