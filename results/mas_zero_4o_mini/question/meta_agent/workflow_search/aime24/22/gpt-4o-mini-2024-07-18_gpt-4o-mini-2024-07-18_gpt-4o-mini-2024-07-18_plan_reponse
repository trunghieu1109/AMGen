Previous attempts only considered a few combinations, which may not cover all possibilities. A systematic exploration of combinations is necessary to ensure accuracy.\n\nAnswer:490\n[TOO_HARD]\nSuggestion: A systematic exploration of all combinations that meet the constraints would provide a more accurate total.",
