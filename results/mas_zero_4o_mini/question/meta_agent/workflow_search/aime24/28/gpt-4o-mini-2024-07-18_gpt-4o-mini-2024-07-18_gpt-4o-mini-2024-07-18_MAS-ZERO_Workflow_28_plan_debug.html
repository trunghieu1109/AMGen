    <pre>Related original question:

Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$..

### Sub-task 4: Based on the output of sub-task 3, simplify the expression for the difference and find the sum of the numerator and denominator when expressed as a fraction in simplest form. 

 ### thinking by Debate Agent wQzC:
To find the difference between the radii of the circles of tangency between the torus and the sphere, we need to analyze the geometric configuration of the torus and the sphere. The torus has a major radius of 6 (distance from the center of the torus to the center of the sphere) and a minor radius of 3 (radius of the circle that forms the torus). The sphere has a radius of 11. The tangency conditions involve calculating the distances and applying the Pythagorean theorem to find the radii of tangency. However, this requires careful geometric reasoning and calculations, which can be complex and may need further breakdown into smaller parts to ensure accuracy.

Suggestion: Break down the problem into smaller parts, such as calculating the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus and then using that to find the radii of tangency.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Based on the output of sub-task 3, simplify the expression for the difference and find the sum of the numerator and denominator when expressed as a fraction in simplest form.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry (for example, 300
