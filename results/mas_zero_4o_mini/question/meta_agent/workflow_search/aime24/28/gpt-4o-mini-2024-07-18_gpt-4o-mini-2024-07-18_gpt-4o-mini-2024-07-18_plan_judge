Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.
proposed answer: To find the difference between the radii of the circles of tangency between the torus and the sphere, we need to analyze the geometric configuration carefully. The torus has a major radius of 6 and a minor radius of 3, while the sphere has a radius of 11. The tangency conditions involve using the Pythagorean theorem and require careful calculations. This problem is complex and might need further breakdown into smaller parts to ensure accuracy.

Suggestion: Break down the problem into smaller parts, such as calculating the distances from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus and then using that to find the radii of tangency.
