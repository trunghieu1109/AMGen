    <pre>Related original question:

Let $\omega\neq 1$ be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\]
is divided by 1000.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1, compute the product of all terms. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent efKC:
To compute the product of all terms (1 - omega^k)^2 for k from 0 to 12, we recognize that each term corresponds to a distinct 13th root of unity. The product can be simplified using properties of roots of unity, but calculating the product directly is complex and requires careful handling of the terms.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent efKC:
169

### Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 2, find the remainder when the product is divided by 1000. 

 ### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent YqX1 (yourself):
The product from sub-task 2 is 169. To find the remainder when 169 is divided by 1000, we simply note that 169 is less than 1000, so the remainder is 169 itself. However, if there are additional complexities in the original problem that affect this result, I would need to consider those. But based on the straightforward division, the answer is clear.

### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent YqX1 (yourself):
169

### Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 2, review the remainder calculation and refine if necessary. 

 ### feedback #1 by Critic Agent FqGs:
The calculation of the remainder when 169 is divided by 1000 is correct, as 169 is less than 1000.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 2, find the remainder when the product is divided by 1000.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry (for example, 300
[TOO_HARD]
Suggestion:...) and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
