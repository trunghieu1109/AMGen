Question: Let $\omega\neq 1$ be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\]
is divided by 1000.
proposed answer: The product from sub-task 2 is 169. To find the remainder when 169 is divided by 1000, we simply note that 169 is less than 1000, so the remainder is 169 itself. There are no additional complexities affecting this result.

Answer:169
Extracted answer: 169
Correct answer: 321
