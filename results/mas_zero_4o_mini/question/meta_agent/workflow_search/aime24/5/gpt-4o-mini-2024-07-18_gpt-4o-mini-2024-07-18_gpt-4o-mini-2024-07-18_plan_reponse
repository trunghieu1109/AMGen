        "problem": "Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \\sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \\sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \\sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\\frac{m \\sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.",

Without these values, it is impossible to provide the correct sum of m, n, and p. The calculations involve determining the distances from the internal point I to the faces of the tetrahedron, which have not been explicitly resolved here.\n\nAnswer:0\n[TOO_HARD]\nSuggestion: Please provide the values of m, n, and p from the previous sub-tasks to compute the final sum accurately.",
