    <pre>Related original question:

Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.
[asy] size(10cm); usepackage(&#34;tikz&#34;);label(&#34;egin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(2,0)--(2,3)--(5,3)--(5,8)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}&#34;,origin); label(&#34;\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(0,3)--(3,3)--(3,5)--(8,5)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}&#34;,E); [/asy].

### Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1, calculate the number of valid paths for each configuration of direction changes. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent rWdc:
To calculate the number of valid paths that change direction exactly four times, we need to break down the paths into segments defined by the direction changes. Each segment must consist of a certain number of steps right and up, and we need to ensure that the total number of steps equals 16 while changing direction exactly four times. This combinatorial counting can become complex, as it involves partitioning the steps correctly and ensuring the paths remain within the grid boundaries.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent rWdc:
The number of valid paths for each configuration of direction changes is complex to compute directly without further breakdown of the problem. [TOO_HARD] Suggestion: Consider analyzing the number of segments between direction changes and how many steps can be allocated to each segment.

### Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 2, aggregate the results to find the total number of paths that change direction exactly four times. 

 ### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent Omea (yourself):
To find the total number of paths that change direction exactly four times, we need to consider the different configurations of how the steps can be divided among the segments created by the direction changes. Each configuration will have a specific number of right and up steps, and we need to ensure that the total number of steps equals 16 while adhering to the grid constraints. This requires a detailed combinatorial analysis of the segments, which can be quite complex.
