    <pre>Related original question:

Find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon ($12$-gon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The diagram below shows three of those rectangles.
[asy] unitsize(0.6 inch); for(int i=0; i&lt;360; i+=30) { dot(dir(i), 4+black); draw(dir(i)--dir(i+30)); } draw(dir(120)--dir(330)); filldraw(dir(210)--dir(240)--dir(30)--dir(60)--cycle, mediumgray, linewidth(1.5)); draw((0,0.366)--(0.366,0), linewidth(1.5)); [/asy].

### Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 2, count the number of rectangles formed by ensuring the selected pairs form a closed rectangle shape. 

 ### thinking by Debate Agent 3174:
Counting the number of rectangles formed by pairs of parallel lines in a dodecagon is complex due to the geometric arrangement and the requirement for the pairs to create a closed shape. Each rectangle requires two pairs of parallel lines, which can be derived from the sides and diagonals. Without a systematic enumeration method, providing a straightforward numeric answer is challenging.

### answer by Debate Agent 3174:
The number of rectangles formed is complex to determine directly. Therefore, I cannot provide a straightforward numeric answer. 
[TOO_HARD] 
Suggestion: Consider breaking down the problem by examining specific combinations of sides and diagonals that can form rectangles.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 3: Based on the debate results, provide the final count of rectangles.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry (for example, 300
[TOO_HARD]
Suggestion:...) and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>
