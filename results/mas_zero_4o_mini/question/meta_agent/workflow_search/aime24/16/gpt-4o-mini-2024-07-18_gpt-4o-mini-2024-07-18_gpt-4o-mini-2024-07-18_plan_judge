Question: Let $\triangle ABC$ have circumcenter $O$ and incenter $I$ with $\overline{IA}\perp\overline{OI}$, circumradius $13$, and inradius $6$. Find $AB\cdot AC$.
proposed answer: To calculate AB · AC, we need to consider the area A, the semi-perimeter s, and the specific condition that IA is perpendicular to OI. This condition suggests a special relationship between the sides of the triangle that is not captured by the area and semi-perimeter alone. Therefore, without additional information about the angles or specific side lengths, we cannot accurately compute AB · AC.

Suggestion: We need to find the lengths of the sides or additional relationships to compute AB · AC accurately.
