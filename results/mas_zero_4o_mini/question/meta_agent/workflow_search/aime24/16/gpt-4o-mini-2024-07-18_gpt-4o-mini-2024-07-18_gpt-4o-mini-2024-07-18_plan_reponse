This condition suggests a special relationship between the sides of the triangle that is not captured by the area and semi-perimeter alone. Therefore, without additional information about the angles or specific side lengths, we cannot accurately compute AB \u00b7 AC.\n\nAnswer:1500\n[TOO_HARD]\nSuggestion: We need to find the lengths of the sides or additional relationships to compute AB \u00b7 AC accurately.",
