Question: Alice chooses a set $A$ of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets $B$ of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of $B$ belongs to $A$. Bob's list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A.
proposed answer: To refine the sum of the elements of set A, I need to identify the specific elements that lead to a total of 2024 subsets. The previous analysis suggested that the maximum element n that satisfies 2^n - 1 = 2024 is n = 11. However, without knowing the exact elements of A, I cannot accurately compute their sum. The sum of the first 11 positive integers is 66, but this may not reflect the actual elements of A. Therefore, further combinatorial analysis is required to determine the correct elements of A.

Answer:66

Suggestion: Analyze the combinations of integers that yield the total of 2024 subsets and their contributions.
Extracted answer: 66
Correct answer: 055
