One suggests \u03b8 = 0, while the other suggests \u03b8 = 0 or \u03b8 = \u03c0/2. This indicates that the problem may have multiple critical points or that the analysis is not straightforward. Therefore, further investigation or numerical methods may be necessary to confirm the optimal value of \u03b8.\n\nAnswer:\u03b8 = 0 or \u03b8 = \u03c0/2\n[TOO_HARD]\nSuggestion: Consider using numerical methods or graphing techniques to find the precise maximum value.",
