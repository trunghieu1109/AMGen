The equation involves quadratic terms and requires checking each combination for a specific condition, which can be computationally intensive. Given the large number of combinations, it may be necessary to use a programmatic approach to efficiently filter the valid triples.\n\nAnswer:0\n[TOO_HARD]\nSuggestion: Consider using a computational method to iterate through the generated triples and check the condition.",
