    <pre>Related original question:

Find the number of triples of nonnegative integers \((a,b,c)\) satisfying \(a + b + c = 300\) and
\begin{equation*}
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.
\end{equation*}. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 1: Generate all possible triples (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent lgvM:
Generating all possible triples (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 involves iterating through all nonnegative integer combinations of a, b, and c that sum to 300. This is a combinatorial problem that can be complex due to the large number of combinations, especially since a, b, and c can take on values from 0 to 300. The total number of such combinations is given by the stars and bars theorem, which states that the number of ways to distribute n indistinguishable objects (in this case, the total sum of 300) into k distinguishable boxes (the variables a, b, and c) is C(n + k - 1, k - 1). Here, n = 300 and k = 3, leading to a large number of combinations to consider.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent lgvM:
300

Suggestion: Consider breaking down the problem into smaller parts or using a computational approach to generate the combinations.

### Sub-task 2: Based on the output of sub-task 1, filter the triples (a, b, c) to satisfy a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000. 

 ### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent Nd8U (yourself):
Filtering the triples (a, b, c) that satisfy the equation a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000 after generating all combinations where a + b + c = 300 is a complex task. The equation involves quadratic terms and requires checking each combination for a specific condition, which can be computationally intensive. Given the large number of combinations, it may be necessary to use a programmatic approach to efficiently filter the valid triples.
