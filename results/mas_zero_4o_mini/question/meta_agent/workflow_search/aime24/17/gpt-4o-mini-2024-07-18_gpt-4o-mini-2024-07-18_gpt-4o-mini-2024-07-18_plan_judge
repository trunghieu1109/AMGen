Question: Find the number of triples of nonnegative integers \((a,b,c)\) satisfying \(a + b + c = 300\) and
\begin{equation*}
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.
\end{equation*}
proposed answer: Filtering the triples (a, b, c) that satisfy the equation a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000 after generating all combinations where a + b + c = 300 is a complex task. The equation involves quadratic terms and requires checking each combination for a specific condition, which can be computationally intensive. Given the large number of combinations, it may be necessary to use a programmatic approach to efficiently filter the valid triples.
