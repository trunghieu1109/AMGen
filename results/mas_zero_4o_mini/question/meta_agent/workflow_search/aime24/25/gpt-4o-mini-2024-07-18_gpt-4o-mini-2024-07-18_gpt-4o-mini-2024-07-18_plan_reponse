        "response": "The side lengths of the triangle provide a relationship to the hexagon's side length due to the properties of similar triangles and the geometry of the hexagon. However, deriving the exact side length of the hexagon from the triangle's sides requires a deeper geometric analysis that may not be straightforward. The previous answers suggest a side length of 240, but further verification is needed to ensure this is correct.\n\nAnswer:240\n[TOO_HARD]\nSuggestion: Analyze the relationship between the triangle's angles and the hexagon's symmetry to derive the side length more accurately.",
