Question: Let ABCDEF be a convex equilateral hexagon in which all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle whose sides are extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. Find the side length of the hexagon.
proposed answer: The side lengths of the triangle provide a relationship to the hexagon's side length due to the properties of similar triangles and the geometry of the hexagon. However, deriving the exact side length of the hexagon from the triangle's sides requires a deeper geometric analysis that may not be straightforward. The previous answers suggest a side length of 240, but further verification is needed to ensure this is correct.

Answer:240
[TOO_HARD]
Suggestion: Analyze the relationship between the triangle's angles and the hexagon's symmetry to derive the side length more accurately.
Extracted answer: 240
Correct answer: 080
