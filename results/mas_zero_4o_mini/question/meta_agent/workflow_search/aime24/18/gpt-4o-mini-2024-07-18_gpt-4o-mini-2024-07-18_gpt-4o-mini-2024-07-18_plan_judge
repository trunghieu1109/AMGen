Question: Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). Then \(OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\).
proposed answer: To find OC^2, we need to calculate the square of the distance from the origin O to the point C on line AB. The coordinates of point C must be determined such that it does not belong to any segment of unit length PQ. The calculations involve determining the coordinates of C from the line equation and applying the distance formula to find OC^2. The final result should be expressed as p/q where p and q are relatively prime integers. However, the specific coordinates for C need to be derived accurately, which may involve complex calculations.
