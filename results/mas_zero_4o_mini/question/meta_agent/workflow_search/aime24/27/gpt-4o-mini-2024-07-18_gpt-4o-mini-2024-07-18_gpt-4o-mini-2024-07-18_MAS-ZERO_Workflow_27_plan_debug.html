    <pre>Related original question:

Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$..

### Sub-task 4: Based on Q and R from Sub-task 3, compute Q + R. 

 ### thinking by Debate Agent Klza:
To find the greatest four-digit integer N such that changing any digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7, I need to systematically check numbers starting from 9999 downwards. Each digit change must be verified for divisibility by 7, which is complex and requires thorough analysis. I suspect the answer involves detailed checks for each digit change, which might be cumbersome.

### thinking by Debate Agent xoYk:
To find the greatest four-digit integer N such that changing any digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7 requires checking each digit of N for divisibility conditions. The task is complex as it involves multiple checks for each digit change. A systematic approach is needed, starting from the largest four-digit number and working downwards, verifying the divisibility by 7 for each modified number. Given the previous attempts, I believe that finding the exact values of Q and R from N is non-trivial and requires careful calculation.

### answer by Debate Agent Klza:
9996
[TOO_HARD]
Suggestion: I suggest breaking down the problem by checking each four-digit number systematically, starting from 9999, and verifying the divisibility conditions for each digit change.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Based on Q and R from Sub-task 3, compute Q + R.

If the question is too complicated or informaion is missing, you still need to give your best answer but add (1) an additional mark [TOO_HARD] in the next line of your final answer (2) information request or decomposison suggestion in the next line of the [TOO_HARD] mark, in the &#34;answer&#34; entry (for example, 300
[TOO_HARD]
Suggestion:...) and justify why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry</pre>

    <pre>To find Q and R from N = 9996, I need to divide 9996 by 1000. The quotient Q is the integer part of the division, and R is the remainder. However, I need to ensure that I have correctly identified N and its properties. Since the problem is complex and involves multiple checks, I will proceed with the division.
