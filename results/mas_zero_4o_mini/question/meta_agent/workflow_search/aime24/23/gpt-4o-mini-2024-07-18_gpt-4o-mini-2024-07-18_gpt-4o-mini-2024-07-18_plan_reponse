The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$.\n\\[\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \\hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\\\ \\hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\\\ \\hline \\end{array}\\]",

This requires a detailed analysis of the combinations from both sub-tasks, which can be quite complex and may not yield straightforward results.\n\nAnswer:300\n[TOO_HARD]\nSuggestion: Systematically generate all valid combinations from sub-task 3 and sub-task 4, then check for overlaps to find the common configurations.",
