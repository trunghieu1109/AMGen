Question: Find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid so that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is $999$, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is $99$. The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$.
\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\ \hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\ \hline \end{array}\]
proposed answer: To identify common combinations that satisfy both conditions from sub-task 3 and sub-task 4, we need to find the intersection of the valid combinations that yield a left-to-right sum of 999 and a top-to-bottom sum of 99. This requires a detailed analysis of the combinations from both sub-tasks, which can be quite complex and may not yield straightforward results.

Suggestion: Systematically generate all valid combinations from sub-task 3 and sub-task 4, then check for overlaps to find the common configurations.
