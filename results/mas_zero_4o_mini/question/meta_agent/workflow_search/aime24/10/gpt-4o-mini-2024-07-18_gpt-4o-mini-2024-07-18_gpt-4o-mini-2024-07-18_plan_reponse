        "n": "MAS-ZERO Workflow 10",
        "response": "To deduce the length of CE, I need to analyze the relationships between the two rectangles and their properties with respect to the circle. The collinearity of points D, E, C, and F suggests that the lengths of CE can be derived from the dimensions of the rectangles and the cyclic nature of points A, D, H, and G. However, the relationships are complex and may require a more detailed breakdown of the geometric properties involved.\n\nAnswer:77\n[TOO_HARD]\nSuggestion: Consider breaking down the problem into smaller parts, such as calculating the coordinates of the points based on the given lengths and using the properties of the circle and rectangles to find CE.",
