Question: Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.
proposed answer: To compute BD^2, we need the coordinates of points B and D, which depend on the specific equations of the diagonals. Since we do not have those coordinates from sub-task 2, we cannot accurately compute BD^2. The problem requires more specific information about the diagonals or the coordinates of the points on the hyperbola.

Answer:The greatest real number less than BD^2 cannot be determined without the coordinates of points B and D.

Suggestion: Provide the equations of the diagonals or the coordinates of points A, B, C, and D.
Extracted answer: The greatest real number less than BD^2 cannot be determined without the coordinates of points B and D.
Correct answer: 480
