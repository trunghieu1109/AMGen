Since we do not have those coordinates from sub-task 2, we cannot accurately compute BD^2. The problem requires more specific information about the diagonals or the coordinates of the points on the hyperbola.\n\nAnswer:The greatest real number less than BD^2 cannot be determined without the coordinates of points B and D.\n[TOO_HARD]\nSuggestion: Provide the equations of the diagonals or the coordinates of points A, B, C, and D.",
