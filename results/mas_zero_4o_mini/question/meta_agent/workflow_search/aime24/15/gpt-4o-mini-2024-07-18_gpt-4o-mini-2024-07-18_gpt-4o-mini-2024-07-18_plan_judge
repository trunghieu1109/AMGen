Question: Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.
proposed answer: To calculate the number of residents owning all four items, we need to consider the total number of residents and the number of residents who own exactly two and three items. However, the specific overlaps between the items are not provided, making it difficult to determine how many own all four items. The problem is complex due to the lack of specific overlap data.
