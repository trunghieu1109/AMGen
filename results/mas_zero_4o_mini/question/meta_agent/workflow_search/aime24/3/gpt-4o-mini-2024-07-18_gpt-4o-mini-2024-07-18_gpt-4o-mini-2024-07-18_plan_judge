Question: Define $f(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{4}|$. Find the number of intersections of the graphs of \[y=4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \quad\text{ and }\quad x=4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))).\]
proposed answer: Finding the intersection points of the two graphs involves analyzing the complex behavior of the functions y=4 g(f(sin(2πx))) and x=4 g(f(cos(3πy))). Both functions involve nested absolute values and periodic functions, which complicates the analysis. A detailed study of the ranges and behaviors of these functions is required to determine the intersections, but this requires extensive calculations and piecewise evaluations.

Suggestion: Break down the analysis into specific intervals for both x and y, and evaluate the functions at those points to find intersections.
