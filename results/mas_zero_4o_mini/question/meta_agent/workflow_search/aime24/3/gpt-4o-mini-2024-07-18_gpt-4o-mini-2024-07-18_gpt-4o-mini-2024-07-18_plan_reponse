Both functions involve nested absolute values and periodic functions, which complicates the analysis. A detailed study of the ranges and behaviors of these functions is required to determine the intersections, but this requires extensive calculations and piecewise evaluations.\n\nAnswer:0\n[TOO_HARD]\nSuggestion: Break down the analysis into specific intervals for both x and y, and evaluate the functions at those points to find intersections.",
