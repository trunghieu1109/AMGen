Question: Example(question='Consider the following metric:\n\nds^{2}=\\frac{32}{\\left(4-x^{2}-y^{2}\\right)}\\left(dx^{2}+dy^{2}\\right)\n\nWhat is the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2?\n\nPS: for the maths use a LaTeX editor.', choice1='+\\infty', choice2='4\\pi\\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\\right)', choice3='0', choice4='4\\pi\\left(x^{2}-y^{2}\\right)', correct_index=1)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_21_161
proposed answer: The integral for the area of the pseudosphere was evaluated and found to diverge, indicating that the area is infinite. Among the multiple-choice options provided, option A) '+\infty' correctly represents an infinite area. The other options involve finite expressions, which do not match the result of the integral evaluation. Therefore, the correct choice is A).
