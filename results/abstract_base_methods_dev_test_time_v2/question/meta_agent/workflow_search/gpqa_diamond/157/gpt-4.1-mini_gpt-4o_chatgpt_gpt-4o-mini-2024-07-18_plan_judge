Question: Example(question='In an inactive state, a transcription factor subunit awaits an activation signal from the membrane phosphorylation cascade. Upon phosphorylation on the Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, shuttles into the nucleus, and serves in gene transcription. A missense mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. You observe that a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Which of the following molecular phenotypes is most likely observed in the presence of mutation Y?', choice1='loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype', choice2='protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype', choice3='protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele', choice4='change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: A dominant-negative mutation in the dimerization domain results in the mutant protein forming non-functional dimers with the wild-type protein, leading to a loss-of-function phenotype. This is because the mutant protein can still dimerize with the wild-type protein, but the resulting dimer is non-functional, disrupting the normal activity of the transcription factor. Among the provided choices, 'protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype' (choice2) aligns with this understanding. This choice implies that the mutant protein aggregates with the wild-type protein, resulting in a non-functional complex that leads to a loss-of-function phenotype. The other options do not accurately reflect this mechanism: choice1 suggests a wild-type phenotype, which contradicts the dominant-negative effect; choice3 implies degradation of the wild-type allele, which is not a typical result of dominant-negative interactions; choice4 suggests a gain-of-function phenotype, which is not consistent with the expected loss-of-function outcome. Therefore, choice2 is the most consistent with the expected molecular phenotype of a dominant-negative mutation in the dimerization domain.
