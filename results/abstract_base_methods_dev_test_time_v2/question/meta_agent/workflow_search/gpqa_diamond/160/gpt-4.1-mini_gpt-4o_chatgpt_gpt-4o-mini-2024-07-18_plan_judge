Question: Example(question='While designing a high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating at an accelerating voltage of 1000 kV, Mike connected vacuum pumps to create an ultra-high vacuum state (< 10^-9 Torr) in the sample compartment, aiming to minimize the presence of gas molecules for improved electron microscopy. However, as expected, some gas particles remained inside the compartment, as detected by the mass spectrometer. Mike accurately determined the mean free path of these gas molecules in the vacuum state (< 10^-9 Torr) to be λ1, based on factors such as sample compartment volume, pressure, and temperature. However, upon initiating the electron beam, he made an intriguing observation concerning the mean free path based on electron scattering with the gas molecules. He found that the mean free path was no longer equal to λ1; rather, it was λ2, even though the sample compartment temperature remained the same.\n\nWhat can we conclude about λ2 based on the aforementioned scenario?', choice1="λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation", choice2='λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1', choice3='λ2 < λ1', choice4='λ2 >= 1.22*λ1', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: In the scenario described, λ1 is the mean free path of gas molecules in the vacuum, determined by their collisions. When the electron beam is introduced, λ2 becomes the mean free path for electron scattering with gas molecules. Electrons have a higher probability of interacting with gas molecules due to their charge and energy, leading to a shorter mean free path compared to gas molecule collisions. Therefore, λ2 is expected to be less than λ1. The choice 'λ2 < λ1' aligns with this understanding, as it reflects the increased interaction frequency and the specific scattering cross-section of electrons, which typically results in a reduced mean free path. The other choices either suggest λ2 is equal to or greater than λ1, which contradicts the typical behavior of electron scattering in such conditions.
