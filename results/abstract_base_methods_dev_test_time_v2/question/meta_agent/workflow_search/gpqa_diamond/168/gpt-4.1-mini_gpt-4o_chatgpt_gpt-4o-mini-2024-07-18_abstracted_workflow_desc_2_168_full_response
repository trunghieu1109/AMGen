The presence of these neutrinos is crucial in determining the energy distribution of the outgoing E particles. Because the neutrinos can carry away varying amounts of energy, the energy distribution of the E particles is continuous. The endpoint energy Q of the E particle spectrum is the maximum energy the E particles can have, which occurs when the neutrinos take away the least energy possible.

Since neutrinos can take a variable amount of energy, they cause the energy spectrum of the E particles to be continuous. The neutrinos can take any amount of energy from zero up to a certain maximum, and this variability in energy taken by the neutrinos results in the continuous spectrum for the E particles. The endpoint of the spectrum, Q, is the maximum energy the E particles can have, which occurs when the neutrinos take the least possible energy. Thus, the presence of the neutrinos and their ability to take varying amounts of energy is what leads to the continuous energy spectrum and defines the endpoint Q.; answer: The presence of the two lighter particles V (neutrinos) in the original decay affects the energy distribution of the E particles by making it continuous, as the neutrinos can take a variable amount of energy.

In the original decay, the continuous energy spectrum of the E particles was due to the variable energy carried away by the two neutrinos. Each neutrino could take a different amount of energy, leading to a continuous distribution of energy among the E particles. However, in the variant decay, there is only one massless particle M, which means there is less freedom in how the energy is distributed. The massless particle M will take a fixed amount of energy, determined by the kinematics of the decay, which will result in a discrete energy spectrum for the E particles. The endpoint of the spectrum will be determined by the total energy available minus the energy carried by the massless particle M. Since M is massless, it will carry away a significant portion of the energy, potentially increasing the endpoint of the E particles' energy spectrum compared to the original decay where two neutrinos shared the energy.
