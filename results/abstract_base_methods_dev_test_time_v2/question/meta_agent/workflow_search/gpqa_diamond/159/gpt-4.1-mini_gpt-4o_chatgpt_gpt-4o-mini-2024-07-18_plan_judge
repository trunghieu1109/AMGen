proposed answer: The problem involves diffraction through an aperture that becomes circular as N approaches infinity. For a circular aperture, the angular position of the first minimum is given by the condition sin(theta) = 1.22 * (lambda / D), where D is the diameter. With the apothem a related to the radius, the effective diameter is 2a. Using the small angle approximation, the angular position for the first minimum is theta ≈ 1.22 * (lambda / (2a)). The angular distance between the first two minima is twice this value: 2 * 1.22 * (lambda / (2a)) = 1.22 * (lambda / a). This matches the choice '1.220 \lambda /a'. Therefore, the correct choice is A).

proposed answer: The calculated angular distance between the first two minima is Δθ = (3.184 * λ) / (π * a), which simplifies to approximately 1.013 * (λ/a) when using π ≈ 3.1416. Among the provided options, none match this value exactly. However, option A) 1.220 * (λ/a) is the closest to the calculated value. The discrepancy is likely due to approximations or assumptions in the problem setup, such as the behavior of Bessel functions for a large N-sided polygon. Given the context and the closest approximation, option A) is the best fit.
