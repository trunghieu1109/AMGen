The formula \\( \\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2} \\) is used correctly with \\( \\langle P_z \\rangle = 0 \\) and \\( \\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\hbar^2/2 \\), leading to \\( \\Delta P_z = \\hbar/\\sqrt{2} \\).; answer: The limitation of this calculation is that it assumes the expectation values \\( \\langle P_z \\rangle \\) and \\( \\langle P_z^2 \\rangle \\) are computed accurately for the given state. Any errors in these values would affect the uncertainty calculation. Additionally, this calculation is specific to the given state and may not generalize to other states without recomputation.\n<SEPERATOR>\nReflexion CoT agent 8JMP, refining uncertainty ΔPz, thinking: To compute the uncertainty ΔPz, we use the formula ΔPz = sqrt(⟨Pz²⟩ - ⟨Pz⟩²). From the previous sub-tasks, we have ⟨Pz⟩ = 0 and ⟨Pz²⟩ = ħ²/2. Plugging these values into the formula, we get ΔPz = sqrt(ħ²/2 - 0²) = sqrt(ħ²/2) = ħ/√2. Therefore, the uncertainty ΔPz is ħ/√2.
