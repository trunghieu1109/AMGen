Question: Example(question='A chemist performs two reactions:\n\nReaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. \n\nReaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.\n\nBoth reactions go to 100% completion. The chemist combines the products of both reactions, and then runs the product mixture on both a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column and a chiral HPLC column.\n\nAssuming that the chromatographic resolution is as high as theoretically possible in both cases, what does the chemist observe in each of these chromatograms?', choice1='4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', choice2='3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice3='2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice4='2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: The sub-task analyses consistently predict that on a standard (achiral) HPLC column, there will be 2 peaks due to the presence of two distinct meso compounds. On a chiral HPLC column, there will be 1 peak because meso compounds are achiral and will not be separated based on chirality. None of the provided multiple-choice options perfectly match these predictions. However, the closest option in terms of the standard HPLC prediction is Choice 4, which suggests 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC. Despite this, it is still incorrect for the chiral HPLC prediction, as we expect only 1 peak. Therefore, none of the options accurately reflect the predicted outcomes, but if forced to choose the closest, it would be Choice 4, although it remains incorrect for the chiral HPLC.

Answer:None of the options accurately reflect the predicted outcomes.
Extracted answer: None of the options accurately reflect the predicted outcomes.
Correct answer: 3
