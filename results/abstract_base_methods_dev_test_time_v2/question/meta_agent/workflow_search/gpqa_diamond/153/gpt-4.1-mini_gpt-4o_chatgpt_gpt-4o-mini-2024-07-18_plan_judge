Question: Example(question='In the lab, a chemist discovers an unnamed bottle with a white solid inside. He gathers the following spectral information in order to identify the liquid. Make a reasonable structural suggestion for the unidentified drug using the information provided.\nMass: molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 (100%)\na peak at m/z = 158 (32%)\nIR : broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1, strong sharp peak at 1720 cm-1\n1H NMR: 11.0 ppm (s, 1H), 8.02 ppm (d, 2H), 7.72 (d, 2H)', choice1='4-chlorobenzoic acid', choice2='2-chlorobenzoic acid', choice3='3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde\n', choice4='Phenyl chloroformate', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: The mass spectrometry data indicates a molecular weight of 156 g/mol with a chlorine atom, as shown by the molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 and an isotope peak at m/z = 158 with 32% intensity. The IR spectrum shows a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1, characteristic of an O-H stretch in carboxylic acids, and a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1, indicative of a C=O stretch, suggesting the presence of a carboxylic acid group. The 1H NMR data shows a singlet at 11.0 ppm, consistent with a carboxylic acid proton, and doublets at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm, indicating an aromatic ring with two sets of equivalent protons, likely ortho to each other. This pattern is consistent with 4-chlorobenzoic acid, where the chlorine and carboxylic acid groups are para to each other, leading to symmetry in the aromatic protons. 2-chlorobenzoic acid would not show the same symmetry in the NMR spectrum, and the other options do not match the spectral data as well. Therefore, 4-chlorobenzoic acid is the most reasonable structural suggestion.
