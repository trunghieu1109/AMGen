Question: Example(question='You identified a new quorum-sensing peptide in the bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus. You are highly interested if its role in intercellular communication is conserved among the eukaryotes. You treat yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with the peptide and interestingly observe the formation of the shmoo. You want to learn about the proteome of the active chromatin in the shmoo and recover it by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. The least of proteins from which complex below will you observe in your assay?', choice1='pre-initiation complex', choice2='pre-replication complex', choice3='enhancer protein complex', choice4='nucleosome histone complex', correct_index=2)
Iteration: abstracted_workflow_desc_39_151
proposed answer: The ChIP-MS assay is designed to identify proteins associated with active chromatin regions during transcriptional activation. In the context of the shmoo formation in yeast, which is a transcriptionally active process, we expect to find proteins involved in transcription activation. The pre-initiation complex is crucial for the initiation of transcription, the enhancer protein complex plays a role in increasing transcription levels, and the nucleosome histone complex, although always present, undergoes modifications that facilitate transcription. On the other hand, the pre-replication complex is primarily involved in DNA replication, not transcription. Therefore, it would not be expected to be associated with active chromatin during transcriptional activation in the shmoo. Consequently, the pre-replication complex proteins will be the least observed in the ChIP-MS assay targeting the shmoo proteome, as they are not relevant to the transcriptional activation process occurring during shmoo formation.
