Question: Example(question='Astronomers are studying two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2. Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.', choice1='~ 0.4', choice2='~ 0.7', choice3='~ 0.6\n', choice4='~ 1.2', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: The task is to determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2. From the analysis, the total mass of each system is estimated using their respective radial velocity amplitudes and periods. For system_1, the total mass is proportional to (10 + 5) * 2^(2/3), and for system_2, it is proportional to (15 + 10) * 1^(2/3). By dividing the total mass of system_1 by the total mass of system_2, it was found that system_1 is less massive than system_2 by a factor of approximately 0.4. This means that system_1's mass is 0.4 times the mass of system_2, indicating that system_1 is not more massive, but rather less massive. Therefore, the closest matching choice to the factor by which system_1 is more massive is ~0.4, which aligns with the understanding that system_1 is actually less massive than system_2 by this factor.
