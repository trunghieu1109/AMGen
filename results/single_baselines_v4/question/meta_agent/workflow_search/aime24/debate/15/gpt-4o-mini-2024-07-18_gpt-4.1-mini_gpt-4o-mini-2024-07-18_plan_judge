Question: Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The problem states that among 900 residents, each owns candy hearts, and there are 195 diamond ring owners, 367 golf club owners, and 562 garden spade owners. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these items and 234 who own exactly three. We want to find how many own all four items. Let x be the number owning all four items. Let N1 be the number owning exactly one item, N2 = 437, N3 = 234, N4 = x. Since everyone owns candy hearts, owning exactly one item means candy hearts only. Total residents: N1 + N2 + N3 + N4 = 900 => N1 = 900 - 437 - 234 - x = 229 - x. The total number of items owned summed over all residents is: N1*1 + N2*2 + N3*3 + N4*4 = (229 - x) + 2*437 + 3*234 + 4*x = 229 - x + 874 + 702 + 4x = 1805 + 3x. The total number of items owned is also the sum of owners of each item: 195 + 367 + 562 + 900 = 2024. Equate: 1805 + 3x = 2024 => 3x = 219 => x = 73. Therefore, 73 residents own all four items.
