    <pre>Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.

### thinking by Debate Agent ZiJw:
Let&#39;s define the sets: D = diamond ring owners, G = golf clubs owners, S = garden spade owners, C = candy hearts owners. We have |D|=195, |G|=367, |S|=562, and |C|=900 since every resident owns candy hearts. Total residents n=900. Let x be the number of residents owning all four items. Also given: 437 own exactly two items, 234 own exactly three items. We want to find the number of residents who own all four items, i.e., x.

First, let&#39;s consider the total number of residents owning at least one of the first three items (D, G, S). Since all own candy hearts, owning candy hearts is universal.

We can categorize the residents by how many of the first three items they own: exactly one, exactly two, exactly three, or none. We have:
- Exactly two items: 437
- Exactly three items: 234
- Exactly one item: unknown
- None of the three items: unknown

Note that owning all four items means owning candy hearts plus all three other items, so owning all four means owning exactly three of the first three items plus candy hearts. So the number of residents owning all four items is the number of residents owning exactly three of the first three items, which is 234.

But the problem says 234 residents own exactly three of these things; the &#39;these things&#39; likely refers to the four items including candy hearts. Since everyone owns candy hearts, owning exactly three items means owning candy hearts plus exactly two other items.

Wait, the problem says: &#34;Among the 900 residents... 195 own diamond ring, 367 own golf clubs, 562 own garden spade. Each owns candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 who own exactly three of these things.&#34;

So &#39;these things&#39; refers to all four items: diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, candy hearts.

Since everyone owns candy hearts, the minimum number of items owned is 1 (candy hearts only). So:
- Exactly one item means candy hearts only.
- Exactly two items means candy hearts plus exactly one of the other three items.
- Exactly three items means candy hearts plus exactly two of the other three items.
- Exactly four items means candy hearts plus all three items.

Given:
- Exactly two items: 437
- Exactly three items: 234

Let x = number of residents owning all four items.

Total residents = 900 = sum of residents owning exactly 1, 2, 3, or 4 items.

Let a = number owning exactly 1 item (candy hearts only)

So:
 a + 437 + 234 + x = 900
 =&gt; a + 671 + x = 900
 =&gt; a + x = 229

Now, count the total number of owners of each item:
- Diamond ring owners = 195
- Golf clubs owners = 367
- Garden spade owners = 562
- Candy hearts owners = 900

Each resident owning exactly one item owns only candy hearts, so they do not count towards the counts 195, 367, or 562.

Residents owning exactly two items own candy hearts plus exactly one of the other three items. So the total number of owners of diamond rings, golf clubs, garden spades is:

Number owning exactly two items with diamond ring = number owning candy hearts + diamond ring only
Number owning exactly three items with diamond ring = number owning candy hearts + diamond ring + one other
Number owning all four items includes diamond ring as well.

Let’s denote:
- x = number owning all four (candy hearts + all three items)
- y_D = number owning exactly two items including diamond ring (thus candy hearts + diamond ring only)
- y_G = number owning exactly two items including golf clubs
- y_S = number owning exactly two items including garden spade

Similarly, let z_D = number owning exactly three items including diamond ring (candy hearts + diamond ring + one other item), similarly for z_G and z_S.

From the problem:
- Exactly two items total = 437 = y_D + y_G + y_S
- Exactly three items total = 234 = z_D + z_G + z_S

Total diamond ring owners = 195 = y_D + z_D + x
Total golf clubs owners = 367 = y_G + z_G + x
Total garden spade owners = 562 = y_S + z_S + x

Sum of these three equations:
195 + 367 + 562 = (y_D + z_D + x) + (y_G + z_G + x) + (y_S + z_S + x)
= (y_D + y_G + y_S) + (z_D + z_G + z_S) + 3x
= 437 + 234 + 3x
= 671 + 3x

Calculate left side:
195 + 367 + 562 = 1124

So:
1124 = 671 + 3x
=&gt; 3x = 453
=&gt; x = 151

Therefore, the number of residents owning all four items is 151.

We have 900 residents. Each owns a bag of candy hearts, so all 900 own this item. The other items are diamond rings (195), golf clubs (367), and garden spades (562). There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these items and 234 residents who own exactly three. We want to find how many own all four items.

Let&#39;s define sets:
D = diamond ring owners = 195
G = golf clubs owners = 367
S = garden spade owners = 562
C = candy hearts owners = 900 (all residents)

We want to find |D ∩ G ∩ S ∩ C|.

Since everyone owns candy hearts, owning candy hearts is universal. So, the problem reduces to finding how many own all three of the other items plus candy hearts, i.e., how many own all four.

Given that exactly 234 own exactly three items, and 437 own exactly two items.

Let&#39;s denote:
- x = number of residents who own all four items

Since everyone owns candy hearts, the number who own exactly two items includes those who own candy hearts plus one other item, and those who own exactly two of the three other items without candy hearts is zero (since everyone owns candy hearts).

Similarly, the number who own exactly three items includes those who own candy hearts plus two other items.

But the problem states 437 own exactly two items, 234 own exactly three items.

Total residents = 900

Number owning exactly one item (only candy hearts or only one of the other items) can be calculated.

Let&#39;s analyze the distribution:

Possible numbers of items owned: 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Number owning exactly 1 item: N1
Number owning exactly 2 items: N2 = 437
Number owning exactly 3 items: N3 = 234
Number owning exactly 4 items: N4 = x

Sum: N1 + N2 + N3 + N4 = 900

We know N2 = 437, N3 = 234, N4 = x

So, N1 = 900 - 437 - 234 - x = 229 - x

Sum of items owned by all residents = total number of items owned =
= 1*N1 + 2*N2 + 3*N3 + 4*N4
= N1 + 2*437 + 3*234 + 4*x
= (229 - x) + 874 + 702 + 4x
= 229 - x + 874 + 702 + 4x
= (229 + 874 + 702) + (4x - x)
= 1805 + 3x

On the other hand, sum of items owned is total number of owners of each item summed:
= |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| = 195 + 367 + 562 + 900 = 2024

So, 1805 + 3x = 2024

3x = 2024 - 1805 = 219

x = 219 / 3 = 73

Therefore, 73 residents own all four items.

    <pre>The problem states that among 900 residents, each owns candy hearts, and there are 195 diamond ring owners, 367 golf club owners, and 562 garden spade owners. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these items and 234 who own exactly three. We want to find how many own all four items. Let x be the number owning all four items. Let N1 be the number owning exactly one item, N2 = 437, N3 = 234, N4 = x. Since everyone owns candy hearts, owning exactly one item means candy hearts only. Total residents: N1 + N2 + N3 + N4 = 900 =&gt; N1 = 900 - 437 - 234 - x = 229 - x. The total number of items owned summed over all residents is: N1*1 + N2*2 + N3*3 + N4*4 = (229 - x) + 2*437 + 3*234 + 4*x = 229 - x + 874 + 702 + 4x = 1805 + 3x. The total number of items owned is also the sum of owners of each item: 195 + 367 + 562 + 900 = 2024. Equate: 1805 + 3x = 2024 =&gt; 3x = 219 =&gt; x = 73. Therefore, 73 residents own all four items.
