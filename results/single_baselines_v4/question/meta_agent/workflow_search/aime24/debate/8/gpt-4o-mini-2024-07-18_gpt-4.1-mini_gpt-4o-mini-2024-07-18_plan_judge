Question: Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The game is analyzed by defining winning and losing positions. A position is losing if the player to move has no winning strategy, and winning otherwise. Starting from n=0 (losing), we use the recurrence: a position n is winning if removing 1 or 4 tokens leads to a losing position. Calculating the first few values, losing positions are found at n = 0, 2, 5, 7, 10, ... Observing the pattern modulo 5, losing positions correspond to n mod 5 = 0 or 2. Since Alice moves first, Bob can guarantee a win if the initial position is losing for Alice, i.e., n mod 5 = 0 or 2. Counting positive integers n â‰¤ 2024 with n mod 5 = 0 or 2: multiples of 5 up to 2024 are 404, and numbers with remainder 2 mod 5 are 405, totaling 809. Thus, there are 809 such integers.
