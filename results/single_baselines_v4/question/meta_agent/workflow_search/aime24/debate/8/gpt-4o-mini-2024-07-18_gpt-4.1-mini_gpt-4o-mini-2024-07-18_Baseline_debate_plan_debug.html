    <pre>Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice&#39;s play.

### thinking by Debate Agent aRCJ:
We have a game with a stack of n tokens. On each turn, a player can remove either 1 or 4 tokens. Alice goes first. The player who takes the last token wins. We want to find the number of positive integers n ≤ 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy regardless of Alice&#39;s moves. This means that the position with n tokens is a losing position for the first player (Alice).

Step 1: Define winning and losing positions.
- A position is losing if the player to move has no winning strategy.
- A position is winning if the player to move can force a win.

Step 2: Base cases.
- When n = 0 (no tokens), the player to move loses (no moves).
- When n = 1, the player to move can take 1 token and win, so winning.

Step 3: Recurrence.
- For each n, check positions reachable by removing 1 or 4 tokens.
- If any reachable position is losing, then n is winning (because the player can move to a losing position for opponent).
- If all reachable positions are winning, then n is losing.

Step 4: Compute positions for small n.
- n=0: losing (no moves)
- n=1: can remove 1 → n=0 losing → so n=1 winning
- n=2: can remove 1 → n=1 winning, remove 4 (not possible)
  all reachable positions winning → n=2 losing
- n=3: remove 1 → n=2 losing → n=3 winning
- n=4: remove 1 → n=3 winning, remove 4 → n=0 losing
  since n=0 losing reachable, n=4 winning
- n=5: remove 1 → n=4 winning, remove 4 → n=1 winning
  all reachable winning → n=5 losing

Step 5: Pattern so far:
- n=0 losing
- n=1 winning
- n=2 losing
- n=3 winning
- n=4 winning
- n=5 losing

Step 6: Check more to find pattern:
- n=6: remove 1 → n=5 losing → winning
- n=7: remove 1 → n=6 winning, remove 4 → n=3 winning → losing
- n=8: remove 1 → n=7 losing → winning
- n=9: remove 1 → n=8 winning, remove 4 → n=5 losing → winning
- n=10: remove 1 → n=9 winning, remove 4 → n=6 winning → losing

Positions losing: 0,2,5,7,10
Positions winning: 1,3,4,6,8,9

Step 7: Identify pattern in losing positions:
Losing positions: 0,2,5,7,10
Differences: 2-0=2, 5-2=3, 7-5=2, 10-7=3
Pattern of increments: 2,3,2,3,...

Step 8: Check modulo 5 pattern:
Losing positions mod 5:
0 mod 5 = 0
2 mod 5 = 2
5 mod 5 = 0
7 mod 5 = 2
10 mod 5 = 0

Losing positions are those where n mod 5 = 0 or 2.

Step 9: Verify for more values to confirm:
- n=12: 12 mod 5 = 2
  remove 1 → 11 (winning?), remove 4 → 8 (winning?)
  Check position 11:
    remove 1 → 10 (losing)
    remove 4 → 7 (losing)
  Since 11 can move to losing, 11 is winning
  So 12 moves to 11 (winning) and 8 (winning), so 12 losing?
  But 12 mod 5=2, so consistent.

Step 10: Conclusion:
Losing positions are those with n mod 5 = 0 or 2.

Step 11: Since Alice starts, if n is losing for the first player, Bob can guarantee a win.

Step 12: Count the number of positive integers n ≤ 2024 with n mod 5 = 0 or 2.

- Numbers ≤ 2024 divisible by 5:
  floor(2024/5) = 404 numbers (multiples of 5)
- Numbers ≤ 2024 with remainder 2 when divided by 5:
  These are numbers of form 5k + 2 ≤ 2024
  max k: (2024 - 2)/5 = 2022/5 = 404.4 → floor 404
  So 405 numbers (k=0 to 404)

Step 13: Total losing positions = 404 + 405 = 809

Therefore, there are 809 positive integers n ≤ 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy regardless of Alice&#39;s moves.

### thinking by Debate Agent Frjn:
We analyze the game using the concept of winning and losing positions in combinatorial game theory. A position is losing if the player to move has no winning strategy, and winning otherwise. Let f(n) be true if the position with n tokens is winning for the player to move, and false if losing.

Base cases:
f(0) = false (no tokens to remove, player to move loses)

For n &gt; 0, f(n) = true if there exists a move removing 1 or 4 tokens leading to a losing position.

So:
f(n) = true if f(n-1) = false or f(n-4) = false (if n-4 &gt;= 0), else false.

Calculate f(n) for n = 0 to 10 to find a pattern:

n=0: false
n=1: f(0) = false =&gt; true
n=2: f(1) = true, f(-2) invalid =&gt; false
n=3: f(2) = false =&gt; true
n=4: f(3) = true, f(0) = false =&gt; true
n=5: f(4) = true, f(1) = true =&gt; false
n=6: f(5) = false, f(2) = false =&gt; true
n=7: f(6) = true, f(3) = true =&gt; false
n=8: f(7) = false, f(4) = true =&gt; true
n=9: f(8) = true, f(5) = false =&gt; true
n=10: f(9) = true, f(6) = true =&gt; false

From this, losing positions (f(n) = false) are n = 0, 2, 5, 7, 10...

Check differences:
2-0=2
5-2=3
7-5=2
10-7=3

Pattern of losing positions appears to be: 0, 2, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, 17, ...

Check if losing positions follow n mod 7:
0 mod 7 = 0 (losing)
2 mod 7 = 2 (losing)
5 mod 7 = 5 (losing)
7 mod 7 = 0 (losing)
10 mod 7 = 3 (not losing)

No simple mod 7 pattern. Try mod 5:
0 mod 5 = 0 (losing)
2 mod 5 = 2 (losing)
5 mod 5 = 0 (losing)
7 mod 5 = 2 (losing)
10 mod 5 = 0 (losing)

Actually, 10 was losing, so mod 5 values 0 and 2 are losing.
Check if losing positions are those with n mod 5 in {0, 2}.
Check n=12: 12 mod 5 = 2, losing?
Check f(12): f(11) and f(8)
Calculate f(11): f(10) and f(7)
f(10) = false (losing), so f(11) = true
f(8) = true
So f(12) = f(11) or f(8) false? No, both true, so f(12) = false (losing).
So n mod 5 in {0, 2} are losing positions.

Hence losing positions occur when n mod 5 = 0 or 2.

Since Alice starts, Bob wins if the initial position is losing for Alice, i.e., f(n) = false.

Count positive integers n ≤ 2024 where n mod 5 = 0 or 2.

Number of n ≤ 2024 with n mod 5 = 0:
Multiples of 5 up to 2024: floor(2024/5) = 404

Number of n ≤ 2024 with n mod 5 = 2:
Numbers of form 5k + 2 ≤ 2024
Max k: (2024 - 2)/5 = 404.4, floor 404
Count = 405 (k=0 to 404)

Total = 404 + 405 = 809

Therefore, there are 809 positive integers n ≤ 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy regardless of Alice&#39;s play.

    <pre>The game is analyzed by defining winning and losing positions. A position is losing if the player to move has no winning strategy, and winning otherwise. Starting from n=0 (losing), we use the recurrence: a position n is winning if removing 1 or 4 tokens leads to a losing position. Calculating the first few values, losing positions are found at n = 0, 2, 5, 7, 10, ... Observing the pattern modulo 5, losing positions correspond to n mod 5 = 0 or 2. Since Alice moves first, Bob can guarantee a win if the initial position is losing for Alice, i.e., n mod 5 = 0 or 2. Counting positive integers n ≤ 2024 with n mod 5 = 0 or 2: multiples of 5 up to 2024 are 404, and numbers with remainder 2 mod 5 are 405, totaling 809. Thus, there are 809 such integers.
