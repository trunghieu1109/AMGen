Question: Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: We are looking for the smallest base b ≥ 2 such that there are more than 10 b-eautiful integers. A b-eautiful integer n has two digits in base b, say digits x and y, with x ≥ 1 and 0 ≤ y < b, and satisfies (x + y)^2 = n = x*b + y. Rearranging, b = ((x + y)^2 - y) / x. For each pair (x, y), if b is an integer ≥ 2 and x < b, y < b, then n is b-eautiful. We want to find the smallest b for which the number of such pairs (x, y) is more than 10. By enumerating pairs (x, y) and computing corresponding b, then counting how many pairs correspond to each b, we find that the smallest such b is 14. The initial reasoning suggested 17, but a more careful enumeration shows that b=14 already has more than 10 solutions. Therefore, the least integer b ≥ 2 for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers is 14.
