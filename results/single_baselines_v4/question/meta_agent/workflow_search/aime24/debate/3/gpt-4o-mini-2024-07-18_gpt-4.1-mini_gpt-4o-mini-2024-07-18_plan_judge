Question: Define $f(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{4}|$. Find the number of intersections of the graphs of \[y=4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \quad\text{ and }\quad x=4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))).\]
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The problem involves finding the number of intersection points of the graphs defined by y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) where f(t) = ||t| - 1/2| and g(t) = ||t| - 1/4|. Both f and g are piecewise linear functions involving absolute values, and their compositions with sine and cosine functions produce outputs in [0,1]. By analyzing the function h(t) = 4g(f(t)) on [0,1], we find it has a 'W' shape with minima at 0.25 and 0.75 and maxima at 0, 0.5, and 1. The system reduces to finding fixed points of the map (x,y) -> (h(|cos(3πy)|), h(|sin(2πx)|)) in the unit square. Due to the periodicity of sine and cosine and the piecewise linear nature of h, the system has multiple solutions. Careful reasoning and symmetry considerations indicate there are 9 such intersection points.
