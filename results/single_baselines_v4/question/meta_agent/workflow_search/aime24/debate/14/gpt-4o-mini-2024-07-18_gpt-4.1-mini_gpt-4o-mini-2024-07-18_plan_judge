Question: Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: We are given a hyperbola \( \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \) and four points \( A, B, C, D \) on it forming a rhombus \( ABCD \) with diagonals intersecting at the origin. The diagonals bisect each other at the origin, so if \( B = (x,y) \), then \( D = (-x,-y) \), and similarly for \( A = (u,v) \) and \( C = (-u,-v) \). Both \( (x,y) \) and \( (u,v) \) lie on the hyperbola. The diagonals are perpendicular, so \( \vec{v} \cdot \vec{w} = 0 \), i.e., \( x u + y v = 0 \). The side length squared of the rhombus is \( |A-B|^2 = |\vec{w} - \vec{v}|^2 = |\vec{w}|^2 + |\vec{v}|^2 \) since the diagonals are perpendicular. We want to find the greatest real number less than \( BD^2 = 4|\vec{v}|^2 = 4(x^2 + y^2) \) for all such rhombi. Using the hyperbola equation and the orthogonality condition, we derive constraints and find that the minimal possible value of \( x^2 + y^2 \) satisfying all conditions is 120, leading to \( BD^2 = 480 \). This means \( BD^2 \) can be arbitrarily close to 480 from above but not less. Therefore, the greatest real number less than \( BD^2 \) for all such rhombi is 480.
