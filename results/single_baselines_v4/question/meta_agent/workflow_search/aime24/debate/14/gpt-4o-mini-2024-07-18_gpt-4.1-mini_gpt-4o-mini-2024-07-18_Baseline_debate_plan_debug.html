    <pre>Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.

### thinking by Debate Agent r0SO:
We are given a hyperbola \( \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \) and four points \( A, B, C, D \) on it forming a rhombus \( ABCD \) with diagonals intersecting at the origin. We want the greatest real number less than \( BD^2 \) for all such rhombi.

Step 1: Equation of the hyperbola:
\[
\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1
\]

Step 2: Since \( ABCD \) is a rhombus, its diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other and intersect at the origin. The diagonals intersect at the origin, so the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals.

Step 3: Let the diagonals be vectors \( \vec{BD} = 2\vec{v} \) and \( \vec{AC} = 2\vec{w} \), with \( \vec{v} \) and \( \vec{w} \) vectors from the origin to points \( B \) and \( A \) respectively.

Step 4: The points are then:
- \( B = \vec{v} \)
- \( D = -\vec{v} \)
- \( A = \vec{w} \)
- \( C = -\vec{w} \)

Step 5: Since \( ABCD \) is a rhombus, all sides have equal length. The side length is the distance between adjacent vertices, e.g., \( |A - B| = |B - C| = |C - D| = |D - A| \).

Step 6: The diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular, so \( \vec{v} \cdot \vec{w} = 0 \).

Step 7: The side length squared is:
\[
|A - B|^2 = |\vec{w} - \vec{v}|^2 = |\vec{w}|^2 - 2\vec{w} \cdot \vec{v} + |\vec{v}|^2 = |\vec{w}|^2 + |\vec{v}|^2 \quad (\text{since } \vec{w} \cdot \vec{v} = 0)
\]

Step 8: Points \( B \) and \( D \) lie on the hyperbola, so \( \vec{v} = (x, y) \) satisfies:
\[
\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1
\]
Similarly, \( A = \vec{w} = (u, v) \) also lies on the hyperbola:
\[
\frac{u^2}{20} - \frac{v^2}{24} = 1
\]

Step 9: Since \( \vec{v} \cdot \vec{w} = 0 \), we have:
\[
xu + yv = 0
\]

Step 10: We want to find the greatest real number less than \( BD^2 = |B - D|^2 = |2\vec{v}|^2 = 4|\vec{v}|^2 = 4(x^2 + y^2) \) for all such rhombi.

Step 11: Our goal is to minimize \( |\vec{v}|^2 = x^2 + y^2 \) subject to the constraints:
- \( \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \)
- There exists \( (u,v) \) such that \( \frac{u^2}{20} - \frac{v^2}{24} = 1 \) and \( xu + yv = 0 \).

Step 12: From \( xu + yv = 0 \), we express \( v = -\frac{x}{y} u \) (assuming \( y \neq 0 \)).

Step 13: Substitute into the hyperbola equation for \( (u,v) \):
\[
\frac{u^2}{20} - \frac{v^2}{24} = 1 \Rightarrow \frac{u^2}{20} - \frac{\left(-\frac{x}{y} u\right)^2}{24} = 1 \Rightarrow u^2 \left( \frac{1}{20} - \frac{x^2}{24 y^2} \right) = 1
\]

Step 14: Simplify the coefficient:
\[
\frac{1}{20} - \frac{x^2}{24 y^2} = \frac{6 y^2 - 5 x^2}{120 y^2}
\]

Step 15: For \( u^2 \) to be positive, numerator must be positive:
\[
6 y^2 - 5 x^2 &gt; 0 \Rightarrow 6 y^2 &gt; 5 x^2
\]

Step 16: Then:
\[
u^2 = \frac{1}{\frac{6 y^2 - 5 x^2}{120 y^2}} = \frac{120 y^2}{6 y^2 - 5 x^2}
\]

Step 17: From the hyperbola equation for \( (x,y) \):
\[
\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \Rightarrow \frac{6 x^2}{120} - \frac{5 y^2}{120} = 1 \Rightarrow 6 x^2 - 5 y^2 = 120
\]

Step 18: We want to minimize \( x^2 + y^2 \) subject to \( 6 x^2 - 5 y^2 = 120 \) and \( 6 y^2 - 5 x^2 &gt; 0 \).

Step 19: Express \( y^2 \) in terms of \( x^2 \):
\[
6 x^2 - 5 y^2 = 120 \Rightarrow 5 y^2 = 6 x^2 - 120 \Rightarrow y^2 = \frac{6 x^2 - 120}{5}
\]

Step 20: Substitute into \( x^2 + y^2 \):
\[
x^2 + y^2 = x^2 + \frac{6 x^2 - 120}{5} = \frac{5 x^2 + 6 x^2 - 120}{5} = \frac{11 x^2 - 120}{5}
\]

Step 21: The condition \( 6 y^2 - 5 x^2 &gt; 0 \) becomes:
\[
6 \cdot \frac{6 x^2 - 120}{5} - 5 x^2 &gt; 0 \Rightarrow \frac{36 x^2 - 720}{5} - 5 x^2 &gt; 0 \Rightarrow \frac{36 x^2 - 720 - 25 x^2}{5} &gt; 0 \Rightarrow \frac{11 x^2 - 720}{5} &gt; 0 \Rightarrow 11 x^2 - 720 &gt; 0 \Rightarrow x^2 &gt; \frac{720}{11}
\]

Step 22: So \( x^2 &gt; \frac{720}{11} \approx 65.45 \).

Step 23: The expression for \( x^2 + y^2 \) is increasing in \( x^2 \) since \( 11 x^2 - 120 \) grows with \( x^2 \).

Step 24: The minimum \( x^2 + y^2 \) satisfying the condition is at \( x^2 = \frac{720}{11} \), so:
\[
x^2 + y^2 = \frac{11 \cdot \frac{720}{11} - 120}{5} = \frac{720 - 120}{5} = \frac{600}{5} = 120
\]

Step 25: Thus, the minimum \( |\vec{v}|^2 = 120 \).

Step 26: Recall that \( BD^2 = 4 |\vec{v}|^2 = 4 \times 120 = 480 \).

Step 27: So the minimal possible value of \( BD^2 \) for such rhombi is 480.

Step 28: The problem asks for the greatest real number less than \( BD^2 \) for all such rhombi, so the answer is the supremum of all values less than or equal to 480, which is 480 itself.

Therefore, the greatest real number less than \( BD^2 \) for all such rhombi is 480.

### thinking by Debate Agent 57GI:
Given the hyperbola \( \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \), points \(A, B, C, D\) form a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin. The diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other, so the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. Let the diagonals be \(AC\) and \(BD\) intersecting at the origin. Then, if \(B = (x, y)\), \(D = (-x, -y)\), and if \(A = (u, v)\), \(C = (-u, -v)\). Since \(A, C\) and \(B, D\) lie on the hyperbola, \( (u, v) \) and \( (x, y) \) satisfy \( \frac{u^2}{20} - \frac{v^2}{24} = 1 \) and \( \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \). The rhombus condition means all sides have equal length. The sides are \(AB, BC, CD, DA\). Using vectors, the side length squared is \( |A-B|^2 = (u - x)^2 + (v - y)^2 \). The other sides similarly. Since the diagonals bisect each other at the origin, the diagonals are vectors \(2u, 2v\) and \(2x, 2y\). The length squared of diagonal \(BD\) is \(BD^2 = 4(x^2 + y^2)\). We want the greatest real number less than \(BD^2\) for all such rhombi. By setting up the system and using the rhombus side equality, we find a relation that leads to \(BD^2 = 64\). Hence, the greatest real number less than \(BD^2\) for all such rhombi is \(64\).

    <pre>We are given a hyperbola \( \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \) and four points \( A, B, C, D \) on it forming a rhombus \( ABCD \) with diagonals intersecting at the origin. The diagonals bisect each other at the origin, so if \( B = (x,y) \), then \( D = (-x,-y) \), and similarly for \( A = (u,v) \) and \( C = (-u,-v) \). Both \( (x,y) \) and \( (u,v) \) lie on the hyperbola. The diagonals are perpendicular, so \( \vec{v} \cdot \vec{w} = 0 \), i.e., \( x u + y v = 0 \). The side length squared of the rhombus is \( |A-B|^2 = |\vec{w} - \vec{v}|^2 = |\vec{w}|^2 + |\vec{v}|^2 \) since the diagonals are perpendicular. We want to find the greatest real number less than \( BD^2 = 4|\vec{v}|^2 = 4(x^2 + y^2) \) for all such rhombi. Using the hyperbola equation and the orthogonality condition, we derive constraints and find that the minimal possible value of \( x^2 + y^2 \) satisfying all conditions is 120, leading to \( BD^2 = 480 \). This means \( BD^2 \) can be arbitrarily close to 480 from above but not less. Therefore, the greatest real number less than \( BD^2 \) for all such rhombi is 480.
