Question: Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). Then \(OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\).

proposed answer: We are given points O=(0,0), A=(1/2,0), and B=(0,sqrt(3)/2). The segment AB has length 1 and lies in the first quadrant. The family \(\mathcal{F}\) consists of unit-length segments \(\overline{PQ}\) with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis, both in the first quadrant. We want to find the unique point C on AB (distinct from A and B) that lies only on AB among all segments in \(\mathcal{F}\). Parameterizing AB by t in [0,1], we have \(C = (1/2 - t/2, t \sqrt{3}/2)\). For C to lie on some segment \(\overline{PQ}\) in \(\mathcal{F}\), there must exist a,b,s with a^2 + b^2 = 1, s in [0,1], such that \(C = (a(1-s), b s)\). Using this, we derive a function f(b) depending on t and check for solutions. The unique t for which C lies only on AB corresponds to the case where f(b) has a double root at \(b = \sqrt{3}/2\). Solving the conditions f(b0) = 0 and f'(b0) = 0 leads to t = 3/4. Then, C = (1/8, (3 sqrt(3))/8), and \(OC^2 = (1/8)^2 + ((3 \sqrt{3})/8)^2 = 1/64 + 27/64 = 28/64 = 7/16\). Thus, \(OC^2 = \frac{7}{16}\), and the problem asks for p + q where \(OC^2 = \frac{p}{q}\) with p,q positive integers and coprime. Here, p=7, q=16, so p+q=23.
