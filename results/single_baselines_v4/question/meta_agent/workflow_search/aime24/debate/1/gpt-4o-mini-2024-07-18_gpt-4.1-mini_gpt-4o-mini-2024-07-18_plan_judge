Question: Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.

proposed answer: The problem involves a triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω, with given side lengths AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. Tangents at B and C intersect at D, and line AD intersects ω again at P. We want to find AP in simplest fractional form and then find m+n. Using coordinate geometry, placing B at (0,0), C at (9,0), and solving for A gives A = (1/3, (4*sqrt(14))/3). The center O of the circle lies on the perpendicular bisector of BC at x=4.5, and its y-coordinate is found using the fact that A lies on the circle. The tangents at B and C have slopes that are negative reciprocals of the radii OB and OC, respectively. Their intersection D is found by solving the tangent equations. Using the power of a point theorem, DB^2 = DA * DP, and knowing DA and DB, we find DP, and then AP = AD - DP. Calculations yield AP = 730/3861 in lowest terms, so m+n = 730 + 3861 = 4591.
