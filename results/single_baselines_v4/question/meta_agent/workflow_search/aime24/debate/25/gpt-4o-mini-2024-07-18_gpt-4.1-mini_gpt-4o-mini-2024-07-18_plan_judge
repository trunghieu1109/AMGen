Question: Let ABCDEF be a convex equilateral hexagon in which all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle whose sides are extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. Find the side length of the hexagon.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The problem involves a convex equilateral hexagon ABCDEF with all pairs of opposite sides parallel. The triangle formed by the extensions of sides AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. The hexagon's side length s relates to the distances between pairs of parallel lines corresponding to these sides. The triangle formed by these lines has side lengths equal to the distances between pairs of parallel lines. Using vector and trigonometric relations, the side length s can be found by relating these distances and the hexagon's geometry. The key insight is that the side length s is proportional to the distances between the parallel lines forming the triangle. Calculations using Heron's formula for the triangle area and the sum of its sides suggest s â‰ˆ 65. The initial guess of 160 does not align with the geometric relations and the triangle's dimensions. Therefore, the correct side length of the hexagon is 65.
