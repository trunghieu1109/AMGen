Question: Find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid so that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is $999$, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is $99$. The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$.
\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\ \hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\ \hline \end{array}\]
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: Let the 2x3 grid be:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
 a & b & c \\
\hline
 d & e & f \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

The two numbers formed by reading left to right are abc and def, with sum 999:
100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999.

The three numbers formed by reading top to bottom are ad, be, cf, with sum 99:
(10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99.

Define A = a + d, B = b + e, C = c + f.
Then the first sum becomes:
100A + 10B + C = 999.

The second sum can be rewritten as:
10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99.

Since (a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = A + B + C,
we have:
10(a + b + c) + (A + B + C) - (a + b + c) = 99
=> 9(a + b + c) + (A + B + C) = 99.

From the first equation, try A=9 (max digit sum 9+9=18, but 9 works):
100*9=900, so 10B + C = 99.
Try B=9, C=9.

Then A + B + C = 9 + 9 + 9 = 27.

From second equation:
9(a + b + c) + 27 = 99
=> 9(a + b + c) = 72
=> a + b + c = 8.

Since A = a + d = 9, d = 9 - a.
Similarly, e = 9 - b, f = 9 - c.

All digits are between 0 and 9, so these are valid.

Number of solutions is the number of (a,b,c) with digits 0-9 and sum 8.
Number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c = 8 is C(8+3-1,3-1) = C(10,2) = 45.

Each such triple (a,b,c) uniquely determines (d,e,f).

Therefore, the total number of ways to fill the grid is 45.
