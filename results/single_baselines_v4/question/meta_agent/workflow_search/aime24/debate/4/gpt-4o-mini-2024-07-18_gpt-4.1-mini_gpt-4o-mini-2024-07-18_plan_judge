Question: Let $p$ be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $n^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$. Find the least positive integer $m$ such that $m^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$.

proposed answer: We want the least prime p such that there exists a positive integer n with n^4 + 1 divisible by p^2. This means n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p^2). Checking small primes: For p=2,3,5 no such n exists. For p=7, we find that 11^4 ≡ -1 (mod 49), so 49 divides 11^4 + 1. Thus, p=7 is the least prime with this property. The least positive integer m with m^4 + 1 divisible by 49 is 11, as smaller integers do not satisfy the condition. Therefore, the answer is m=11.
