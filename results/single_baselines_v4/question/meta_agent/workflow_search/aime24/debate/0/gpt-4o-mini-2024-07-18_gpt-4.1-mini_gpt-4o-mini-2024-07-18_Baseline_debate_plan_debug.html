    <pre>Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.

### thinking by Debate Agent uMBz:
Let the walking speed be s km/h and the time spent in the coffee shop be t minutes.

First, convert the total times into hours:
- At speed s, total time is 4 hours including t minutes in the coffee shop.
- At speed s + 2, total time is 2 hours 24 minutes = 2 + 24/60 = 2.4 hours including t minutes in the coffee shop.

The walking time at speed s is (9 / s) hours.
The walking time at speed s + 2 is (9 / (s + 2)) hours.

Since total time includes walking time plus coffee shop time (t minutes = t/60 hours), we have:

1) 9/s + t/60 = 4
2) 9/(s + 2) + t/60 = 2.4

Subtract equation 2 from equation 1:
(9/s - 9/(s + 2)) = 4 - 2.4 = 1.6

Find a common denominator:
9 * (s + 2) - 9 * s = 1.6 * s * (s + 2)

Simplify numerator:
9s + 18 - 9s = 18

So:
18 = 1.6 * s * (s + 2)

Divide both sides by 1.6:
18 / 1.6 = s^2 + 2s

Calculate 18 / 1.6:
18 / 1.6 = 11.25

So:
s^2 + 2s = 11.25

Rewrite as:
s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0

Solve quadratic equation:
Discriminant D = 2^2 - 4 * 1 * (-11.25) = 4 + 45 = 49

Roots:
s = (-2 ± 7) / 2

Two roots:
s = (5)/2 = 2.5 or s = (-9)/2 = -4.5 (not possible for speed)

So s = 2.5 km/h

Find t:
From equation 1:
9 / 2.5 + t/60 = 4

Calculate 9/2.5 = 3.6

So:
3.6 + t/60 = 4

t/60 = 0.4

t = 0.4 * 60 = 24 minutes

Now, find total time when speed is s + 0.5 = 2.5 + 0.5 = 3 km/h

Walking time = 9 / 3 = 3 hours

Total time = walking time + t/60 hours = 3 + 24/60 = 3 + 0.4 = 3.4 hours

Convert 3.4 hours to minutes:
3.4 * 60 = 204 minutes

Therefore, the walk takes 204 minutes including the coffee shop time.

### thinking by Debate Agent kBlt:
Let s be Aya&#39;s walking speed in km/h, and t be the time spent in the coffee shop in minutes.

From the problem, we have two scenarios:
1) Walking at speed s km/h, total time is 4 hours (including t minutes in the coffee shop).
2) Walking at speed s + 2 km/h, total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes (including t minutes in the coffee shop).

Convert all times to hours for consistency:
- 4 hours = 4 hours
- 2 hours 24 minutes = 2 + 24/60 = 2.4 hours

Let the walking time be W, and coffee shop time be t minutes = t/60 hours.

From scenario 1:
Walking time + coffee time = 4 hours
Walking time = distance / speed = 9 / s
So, 9/s + t/60 = 4  (1)

From scenario 2:
Walking time = 9 / (s + 2)
Total time = walking time + coffee time = 2.4 hours
So, 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4  (2)

Subtract (2) from (1):
(9/s + t/60) - (9/(s+2) + t/60) = 4 - 2.4
9/s - 9/(s+2) = 1.6

Multiply both sides by s(s+2):
9(s+2) - 9s = 1.6 * s * (s+2)
9s + 18 - 9s = 1.6 * (s^2 + 2s)
18 = 1.6s^2 + 3.2s

Rewrite:
1.6s^2 + 3.2s - 18 = 0
Divide entire equation by 1.6:
s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0

Use quadratic formula:
s = [-2 ± sqrt(4 + 45)] / 2
s = [-2 ± sqrt(49)] / 2
s = [-2 ± 7] / 2

Two solutions:
s = (5)/2 = 2.5 or s = (-9)/2 = -4.5 (not possible since speed can&#39;t be negative)

So s = 2.5 km/h

Find t using equation (1):
9/2.5 + t/60 = 4
3.6 + t/60 = 4
t/60 = 0.4
t = 24 minutes

Now find the time when speed is s + 0.5 = 2.5 + 0.5 = 3 km/h

Walking time = 9 / 3 = 3 hours
Total time = walking time + coffee time = 3 hours + 24 minutes = 3 hours + 0.4 hours = 3.4 hours
Convert 0.4 hours to minutes: 0.4 * 60 = 24 minutes

Total time = 3 hours 24 minutes = 204 minutes

    <pre>Aya walks 9 kilometers at speed s km/h taking 4 hours including t minutes at the coffee shop, and at speed s+2 km/h taking 2 hours 24 minutes including the same t minutes. Converting times to hours and setting up equations: 9/s + t/60 = 4 and 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4. Subtracting gives 9/s - 9/(s+2) = 1.6. Solving for s yields s = 2.5 km/h. Substituting back to find t gives t = 24 minutes. For speed s + 0.5 = 3 km/h, walking time is 9/3 = 3 hours. Total time including coffee shop is 3 hours + 24 minutes = 3.4 hours = 204 minutes.
