Question: There exist real numbers $x$ and $y$, both greater than 1, such that $\log_x\left(y^x\right)=\log_y\left(x^{4y}\right)=10$. Find $xy$.

proposed answer: We are given two equations involving logarithms: log_x(y^x) = 10 and log_y(x^{4y}) = 10, with x > 1 and y > 1. Rewriting these in exponential form gives y^x = x^{10} and x^{4y} = y^{10}. Taking natural logarithms, we get x ln y = 10 ln x and 4y ln x = 10 ln y. Letting a = ln x and b = ln y (both positive), the equations become x b = 10 a and 4 y a = 10 b, where x = e^a and y = e^b. From the first, b = 10 a / x. Substituting into the second gives 4 y a = 10 * (10 a / x), simplifying to y = 25 / x. Since b = ln y, we have ln(25 / x) = (10 / x) ln x. Using the substitution a = ln x, this leads to an equation that can be solved numerically, but a simpler approach is to combine the two equations to find e^{a + b} = xy = 25. Thus, the product xy = 25.
