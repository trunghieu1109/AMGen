    <pre>There exist real numbers $x$ and $y$, both greater than 1, such that $\log_x\left(y^x\right)=\log_y\left(x^{4y}\right)=10$. Find $xy$.

### thinking by Debate Agent QO01:
Given that \( \log_x(y^x) = 10 \), we can rewrite it as \( x^{10} = y^x \). Similarly, \( \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 \) implies \( y^{10} = x^{4y} \). We now have two equations:

1) \( y^x = x^{10} \)
2) \( x^{4y} = y^{10} \)

Taking natural logarithms of both equations:

From equation (1):
\[ x \ln y = 10 \ln x \]

From equation (2):
\[ 4y \ln x = 10 \ln y \]

Let&#39;s denote \( a = \ln x \) and \( b = \ln y \), with \( x &gt; 1 \) and \( y &gt; 1 \), so \( a &gt; 0 \) and \( b &gt; 0 \).

Rewrite the equations:

1) \( x b = 10 a \)

2) \( 4 y a = 10 b \)

From (1), \( b = \frac{10 a}{x} \).

Substitute into (2):
\[ 4 y a = 10 \cdot \frac{10 a}{x} = \frac{100 a}{x} \]

Divide both sides by \( a \) (nonzero):
\[ 4 y = \frac{100}{x} \implies y = \frac{25}{x} \]

Recall from (1) that \( b = \frac{10 a}{x} \), and since \( b = \ln y \), \( a = \ln x \), we have:
\[ \ln y = \frac{10}{x} \ln x \]

But \( y = \frac{25}{x} \), so:
\[ \ln \left( \frac{25}{x} \right) = \frac{10}{x} \ln x \]

Rewrite:
\[ \ln 25 - \ln x = \frac{10}{x} \ln x \]

Let \( \ln x = a \), so:
\[ \ln 25 - a = \frac{10}{x} a \]

Recall \( x = e^a \), so:
\[ \ln 25 - a = \frac{10 a}{e^a} \]

Multiply both sides by \( e^a \):
\[ e^a \ln 25 - a e^a = 10 a \]

Rearranged:
\[ e^a \ln 25 = a e^a + 10 a = a (e^a + 10) \]

We want to find \( a &gt; 0 \) satisfying:
\[ e^a \ln 25 = a (e^a + 10) \]

Try \( a = 2 \):
\[ e^2 \ln 25 = e^2 \cdot \ln 25 \approx 7.389 \times 3.2189 = 23.78 \]
\[ a (e^a + 10) = 2 (7.389 + 10) = 2 \times 17.389 = 34.778 \]
Not equal.

Try \( a = 1 \):
\[ e^1 \ln 25 = 2.718 \times 3.2189 = 8.75 \]
\[ 1 (2.718 + 10) = 12.718 \]
Still not equal.

Try \( a = 1.5 \):
\[ e^{1.5} \ln 25 = 4.4817 \times 3.2189 = 14.43 \]
\[ 1.5 (4.4817 + 10) = 1.5 \times 14.4817 = 21.72 \]
No.

Try \( a = 1.2 \):
\[ e^{1.2} \ln 25 = 3.3201 \times 3.2189 = 10.69 \]
\[ 1.2 (3.3201 + 10) = 1.2 \times 13.3201 = 15.98 \]
No.

Try \( a = 0.8 \):
\[ e^{0.8} \ln 25 = 2.2255 \times 3.2189 = 7.16 \]
\[ 0.8 (2.2255 + 10) = 0.8 \times 12.2255 = 9.78 \]
No.

Try \( a = 0.5 \):
\[ e^{0.5} \ln 25 = 1.6487 \times 3.2189 = 5.31 \]
\[ 0.5 (1.6487 + 10) = 0.5 \times 11.6487 = 5.824 \]
Close.

Try \( a = 0.4 \):
\[ e^{0.4} \ln 25 = 1.4918 \times 3.2189 = 4.8 \]
\[ 0.4 (1.4918 + 10) = 0.4 \times 11.4918 = 4.5967 \]
Close.

Try \( a = 0.45 \):
\[ e^{0.45} \ln 25 = 1.5683 \times 3.2189 = 5.05 \]
\[ 0.45 (1.5683 + 10) = 0.45 \times 11.5683 = 5.2057 \]

Try \( a = 0.43 \):
\[ e^{0.43} \ln 25 = 1.533 \times 3.2189 = 4.94 \]
\[ 0.43 (1.533 + 10) = 0.43 \times 11.533 = 4.96 \]

Try \( a = 0.42 \):
\[ e^{0.42} \ln 25 = 1.520 \times 3.2189 = 4.89 \]
\[ 0.42 (1.520 + 10) = 0.42 \times 11.520 = 4.83 \]

Try \( a = 0.425 \):
\[ e^{0.425} \ln 25 = 1.5265 \times 3.2189 = 4.92 \]
\[ 0.425 (1.5265 + 10) = 0.425 \times 11.5265 = 4.89 \]

The values cross between 0.42 and 0.425. Approximate solution is \( a \approx 0.423 \).

Recall \( x = e^a \), so \( x \approx e^{0.423} = 1.526 \).

Then \( y = \frac{25}{x} \approx \frac{25}{1.526} = 16.39 \).

Finally, \( xy = x \times y = 25 \).

Hence, the product \( xy = 25 \).

### thinking by Debate Agent 9bYO:
Given the equations: \( \log_x(y^x) = 10 \) and \( \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 \), with \( x &gt; 1 \) and \( y &gt; 1 \).

Step 1: Rewrite the logarithmic equations using the definition of logarithm.

From \( \log_x(y^x) = 10 \), we have:
\[ y^x = x^{10} \]

From \( \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 \), we have:
\[ x^{4y} = y^{10} \]

Step 2: Express the equations in terms of exponents:

Equation 1: \( y^x = x^{10} \)

Equation 2: \( x^{4y} = y^{10} \)

Step 3: Take natural logarithm (ln) on both sides of each equation to work with exponents:

From Equation 1:
\[ x \ln y = 10 \ln x \]

From Equation 2:
\[ 4y \ln x = 10 \ln y \]

Step 4: Let \( a = \ln x \) and \( b = \ln y \), noting that since \( x, y &gt; 1 \), \( a &gt; 0 \) and \( b &gt; 0 \).

Rewrite equations:

(1) \( x b = 10 a \)

(2) \( 4 y a = 10 b \)

Recall \( x = e^a \) and \( y = e^b \), so:

(1) \( e^a b = 10 a \)

(2) \( 4 e^b a = 10 b \)

Step 5: From (1), express \( b \) in terms of \( a \):
\[ b = \frac{10 a}{e^a} \]

From (2), express \( b \) in terms of \( a \) and \( b \):
\[ 4 e^b a = 10 b \Rightarrow b = \frac{4 e^b a}{10} = \frac{2 e^b a}{5} \]

But we also have from (1) \( b = \frac{10 a}{e^a} \), so equate:

\[ \frac{10 a}{e^a} = \frac{2 e^b a}{5} \]

Divide both sides by \( a \) (nonzero since \( a = \ln x &gt; 0 \)):

\[ \frac{10}{e^a} = \frac{2 e^b}{5} \]

Multiply both sides by \( 5 e^a \):

\[ 50 = 2 e^{a + b} \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ 25 = e^{a + b} \]

Step 6: Recall \( a + b = \ln x + \ln y = \ln(xy) \), so:

\[ e^{a + b} = xy = 25 \]

Therefore, \( xy = 25 \).

    <pre>We are given two equations involving logarithms: log_x(y^x) = 10 and log_y(x^{4y}) = 10, with x &gt; 1 and y &gt; 1. Rewriting these in exponential form gives y^x = x^{10} and x^{4y} = y^{10}. Taking natural logarithms, we get x ln y = 10 ln x and 4y ln x = 10 ln y. Letting a = ln x and b = ln y (both positive), the equations become x b = 10 a and 4 y a = 10 b, where x = e^a and y = e^b. From the first, b = 10 a / x. Substituting into the second gives 4 y a = 10 * (10 a / x), simplifying to y = 25 / x. Since b = ln y, we have ln(25 / x) = (10 / x) ln x. Using the substitution a = ln x, this leads to an equation that can be solved numerically, but a simpler approach is to combine the two equations to find e^{a + b} = xy = 25. Thus, the product xy = 25.
