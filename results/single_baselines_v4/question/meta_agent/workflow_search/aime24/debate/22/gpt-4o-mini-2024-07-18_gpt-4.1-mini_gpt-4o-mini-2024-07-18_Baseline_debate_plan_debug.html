    <pre>A list of positive integers has the following properties:
$\bullet$ The sum of the items in the list is $30$.
$\bullet$ The unique mode of the list is $9$.
$\bullet$ The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.
Find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

### thinking by Debate Agent 0cnr:
We are given a list of positive integers with three properties:
1. The sum of the items is 30.
2. The unique mode is 9.
3. The median is a positive integer that does not appear in the list.

Let&#39;s analyze these step by step.

Let the list have n elements: a_1 ≤ a_2 ≤ ... ≤ a_n.

Property 2: Unique mode is 9.
This means 9 appears more times than any other number. So 9 appears at least twice.

Property 3: The median is a positive integer not in the list.
- For the median to be an integer not in the list, the median must be the average of two middle numbers (since if n is odd, median is the middle element, which is in the list).
- So n must be even.
- Let n = 2m.
- Median = (a_m + a_{m+1}) / 2 = k, where k is a positive integer not in the list.
- Since k is integer and not in the list, a_m and a_{m+1} must be two consecutive integers around k, i.e., a_m = k - 1, a_{m+1} = k + 1.

So the median is (k-1 + k+1)/2 = k.

Now, the list is sorted:
... a_m = k-1, a_{m+1} = k+1 ...

k does not appear in the list.

Property 1: sum is 30.

Also, 9 is the unique mode, so 9 appears more times than any other number.

Let&#39;s try to find such a list.

Try small even n.

Start with n=4:
Median = (a_2 + a_3)/2 = k
Try k=5 (median=5).
Then a_2=4, a_3=6.
List: a_1 ≤ 4, 4, 6, a_4 ≥ 6.
Sum= a_1 +4 +6 + a_4 = 30 =&gt; a_1 + a_4 = 20.
Mode is 9, so 9 must appear more than once.
Try a_1=9, a_4=11 sum=20.
List: 9,4,6,11 sorted is 4,6,9,11.
Median=(6+9)/2=7.5 not 5. So no.

Try k=7:
a_2=6, a_3=8.
Sum= a_1 +6 +8 + a_4=30 =&gt; a_1 + a_4=16.
Include two 9s for mode:
Try a_1=9, a_4=7 (invalid as 7 &lt; 8), or a_1=5, a_4=11 sum=16.
Sorted: 5,6,8,11 median=(6+8)/2=7 correct.
Mode: 9 does not appear.

Try n=6:
Median=(a_3 + a_4)/2 = k.
Try k=7 again.
a_3=6, a_4=8.
Sum of all 6 elements=30.
Try to include 9 twice.
Positions: a_1 ≤ a_2 ≤ 6 ≤ 8 ≤ a_5 ≤ a_6.
Try a_5=9, a_6=9.
Sum so far: 6+8+9+9=32 &gt;30 no.
Try a_5=9, a_6=7 sum so far 6+8+9+7=30.
But 7 &lt; 8 invalid.

Try k=6:
a_3=5, a_4=7.
Sum of 6 elements=30.
Try a_5=9, a_6=9.
Sum so far: 5+7+9+9=30 sum of first two a_1 + a_2=0 no.

Try n=5 (odd), median is a_3.
Median is in list, contradicts property 3.

Try n=7 (odd), median a_4, again median in list.

Try n=8 (even), median=(a_4 + a_5)/2=k.
Try k=7:
a_4=6, a_5=8.
Sum=30.
Try to have two 9s for mode.
Try a_6=9, a_7=9.
Sum so far: 6+8+9+9=32 &gt;30 no.

Try k=5:
a_4=4, a_5=6.
Sum=30.
Try two 9s in last positions.
Sum so far: 4+6+9+9=28.
Remaining four elements sum to 2.
Too small.

Try k=4:
a_4=3, a_5=5.
Sum=30.
Try two 9s later.
Sum so far: 3+5+9+9=26.
Remaining four sum to 4.
Possible: 1,1,1,1 sum=4.
But then 1 appears 4 times, mode 1, contradict mode=9.

Try k=8:
a_4=7, a_5=9.
Median= (7+9)/2=8.
Sum=30.
Try two 9s.
We have a_5=9, so 9 appears at least once.
Try a_6=9.
Sum so far: 7+9+9=25.
Remaining five elements sum to 5.
Try 1,1,1,1,1 sum=5.
Now 9 appears twice, 1 appears 5 times, mode=1 contradict mode=9.

Try k=3:
a_4=2, a_5=4.
Sum=30.
Try two 9s.
Sum so far: 2+4+9+9=24.
Remaining four sum to 6.
Try 1,1,2,2 sum=6.
Now 9 appears twice, 2 appears twice, mode not unique.

Try k=1:
a_4=0, invalid as positive integers.

Try k=9:
a_4=8, a_5=10.
Sum=30.
Try two 9s.
Sum so far: 8+10+9+9=36 &gt;30 no.

Try k=6 again with n=4:
a_2=5, a_3=7.
Sum= a_1 +5 +7 + a_4=30 =&gt; a_1 + a_4=18.
Try a_1=9, a_4=9 sum=18.
List: 9,5,7,9 sorted: 5,7,9,9.
Median=(7+9)/2=8 not 6 no.

Try median=8:
a_2=7, a_3=9.
Sum= a_1 +7 +9 + a_4=30 =&gt; a_1 + a_4=14.
Try a_1=5, a_4=9 sum=14.
List: 5,7,9,9 sorted: 5,7,9,9.
Median=(7+9)/2=8 correct.
Mode 9 appears twice, 7 once, 5 once.
Median=8 not in list.
Sum=5+7+9+9=30 correct.

Check all conditions:
Sum=30.
Mode=9 unique.
Median=8 integer not in list.
All positive integers.

Now compute sum of squares:
5^2=25
7^2=49
9^2=81
9^2=81
Total=25+49+81+81=236.

Answer: 236.

### thinking by Debate Agent W9ar:
We have a list of positive integers with the following properties:
1. The sum of the items is 30.
2. The unique mode is 9.
3. The median is a positive integer that does not appear in the list.

Let&#39;s analyze step-by-step:

- Since 9 is the unique mode, it must appear more times than any other number.
- The median is a positive integer not in the list, so the median is between two numbers in the sorted list.
- The median is the middle element if the list length is odd, or the average of the two middle elements if even. Since the median is not in the list, the list must have an even number of elements.

Let the list have 2n elements. The median is the average of the nth and (n+1)th elements.

We want the median to be an integer that is not in the list, so the two middle elements must be consecutive integers with no integer between them, and their average is not in the list.

For example, if the two middle elements are 5 and 6, median is 5.5 (not integer), so no.
If the two middle elements are 4 and 6, median is 5 (integer), and 5 is not in the list.
This satisfies the median condition.

So the two middle elements are consecutive even numbers differing by 2, so their average is an integer not in the list.

Let&#39;s try to build such a list.

Suppose the list length is 6 (even number). Positions: 1 2 3 4 5 6
Median is average of elements at positions 3 and 4.

Let elements at positions 3 and 4 be 4 and 6.
Median = (4+6)/2 = 5, which is not in the list.

We want 9 to be the unique mode, so 9 appears more times than any other number.

Let&#39;s try the list: [a, b, 4, 6, 9, 9]

Sum so far: 4 + 6 + 9 + 9 = 28
We need sum = 30, so a + b = 2
Since a and b are positive integers, possible pairs: (1,1)

List: [1, 1, 4, 6, 9, 9]
Sorted: [1, 1, 4, 6, 9, 9]
Sum = 1+1+4+6+9+9 = 30
Mode is 9 (appears twice), 1 appears twice as well. So mode is not unique.

Try list length 7 (odd), median is 4th element.
Median must not be in list, so no.

Try length 8:
Median is average of elements 4 and 5.
Let elements 4 and 5 be 4 and 6 again.
Median = 5 (integer), not in list.

List: [a, b, c, 4, 6, 9, 9, 9]
Sum so far: 4 + 6 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 37
Too big, sum must be 30.

Try smaller number of 9s: 2 times 9
Sum so far: 4 + 6 + 9 + 9 = 28
We have 4 more elements: a, b, c, d
Total sum is 30, so a + b + c + d = 2
All positive integers, sum 2 for four numbers impossible.

Try median elements 3 and 5:
Median = 4 (integer), not in list.
Positions 4 and 5 are 3 and 5.
List: [a, b, c, 3, 5, 9, 9]
Sum so far: 3 + 5 + 9 + 9 = 26
We need sum 30, so a + b + c = 4
All positive integers sum to 4 with 3 numbers: (1,1,2) or (1,1,1) no (1,1,1) sum 3 only
Try (1,1,2)
List: [1,1,2,3,5,9,9]
Sorted: [1,1,2,3,5,9,9]
Mode: 1 appears twice, 9 appears twice, mode not unique.

Try median elements 2 and 4:
Median = 3 (integer), not in list.
Positions 4 and 5 are 2 and 4.
List: [a, b, c, 2, 4, 9, 9]
Sum so far: 2 + 4 + 9 + 9 = 24
Sum a+b+c = 6
Try a=1,b=1,c=4
List: [1,1,4,2,4,9,9] but 4 appears twice now, mode is 4 or 9?
9 appears twice, 4 appears twice, mode not unique.
Try a=1,b=2,c=3
List: [1,2,3,2,4,9,9]
Sorted: [1,2,2,3,4,9,9]
Mode: 2 appears twice, 9 appears twice, mode not unique.

Try median elements 5 and 7:
Median = 6 (integer), not in list.
Positions 4 and 5 are 5 and 7.
List: [a,b,c,5,7,9,9]
Sum so far: 5 + 7 + 9 + 9 = 30
Sum a+b+c = 0 impossible.

Try list length 5:
Median is 3rd element, must not be in list.
No, median is in list for odd length.

Try list length 4:
Median is average of 2nd and 3rd elements.
Try elements 2 and 4, median=3
List: [a,2,4,b]
Sum a + 2 + 4 + b = 30 =&gt; a + b = 24
Mode is 9, so 9 must appear more times than any other number.
Try list: [9,2,4,9] sum = 9+2+4+9=24 &lt; 30
Try replacing 2 and 4 with other numbers.
Try [9,9,9,a], sum 27 + a = 30 =&gt; a=3
Median is average of 2nd and 3rd elements: 9 and 9 = 9, but 9 is in list, so median in list, no.

Try length 6:
Median average of 3rd and 4th elements.
Try 3rd=4, 4th=6, median=5 not in list.
Try list: [1,1,4,6,9,9]
Sum=1+1+4+6+9+9=30
Mode: 9 appears twice, 1 appears twice, mode not unique.

Try list: [1,2,4,6,9,9]
Sum=1+2+4+6+9+9=31 &gt;30
Try [1,3,4,6,9,9]=32&gt;30
Try [2,2,4,6,9,9]=32&gt;30
Try [1,1,3,6,9,9]=29&lt;30
Try [1,1,5,6,9,9]=31
Try [1,2,3,6,9,9]=30
Sorted: [1,2,3,6,9,9]
Median average of 3rd and 4th elements: (3+6)/2=4.5 not integer.
No.

Try median elements 5 and 7:
Median=6 integer not in list.
Try list length 6: [1,2,5,7,9,9]
Sum=1+2+5+7+9+9=33&gt;30
Try [1,1,5,7,9,9]=32&gt;30
Try [1,1,4,6,9,9]=30 but mode not unique.

Try median elements 3 and 5:
Median=4 integer not in list.
Try list length 6: [1,2,3,5,9,9]
Sum=1+2+3+5+9+9=29&lt;30
Try [1,3,3,5,9,9]=30
Sorted: [1,3,3,5,9,9]
Mode: 3 twice, 9 twice, mode not unique.

Try length 7:
Median 4th element not in list impossible.

Try length 8:
Median average of 4th and 5th elements.
Try 4th=4, 5th=6 median=5 integer not in list.
Try list: [1,1,2,4,6,9,9,9]
Sum=1+1+2+4+6+9+9+9=41&gt;30
Try [1,1,1,4,6,9,9,9]=42&gt;30
Try [1,1,1,2,4,6,9,9]=33&gt;30
Try [1,1,1,2,4,6,9,8]=32&gt;30
Try [1,1,1,2,4,6,7,8]=30 no 9 mode.

Try median elements 2 and 4, median=3

Sorted: [2,3,3,4,9,9]
Mode: 3 twice, 9 twice, mode not unique.

Try length 5, median 3rd element not in list no.

Try length 3, median 2nd element not in list no.

Try length 2, median average of 1st and 2nd elements.
Median integer not in list.
Try [9,21], sum=30, median=(9+21)/2=15 integer not in list.
Mode: 9 and 21 appears once each, no unique mode.

Try length 4:
Median average of 2nd and 3rd elements.
Try [9,9,a,b], sum=18 + a + b = 30 =&gt; a + b = 12
Median = (9 + a)/2 integer not in list.

This satisfies all conditions.

    <pre>The list must have an even number of elements because the median is a positive integer not in the list, which implies the median is the average of two middle elements that are consecutive integers with the median integer between them but not in the list. The unique mode is 9, so 9 appears more times than any other number. By testing various list lengths and configurations, the list [5, 7, 9, 9] satisfies all conditions: sum is 30, mode is uniquely 9, median is (7+9)/2=8 which is not in the list, and all elements are positive integers. The sum of squares is 5^2 + 7^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 = 25 + 49 + 81 + 81 = 236.
