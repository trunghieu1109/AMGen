Question: A list of positive integers has the following properties:
$\bullet$ The sum of the items in the list is $30$.
$\bullet$ The unique mode of the list is $9$.
$\bullet$ The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.
Find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The list must have an even number of elements because the median is a positive integer not in the list, which implies the median is the average of two middle elements that are consecutive integers with the median integer between them but not in the list. The unique mode is 9, so 9 appears more times than any other number. By testing various list lengths and configurations, the list [5, 7, 9, 9] satisfies all conditions: sum is 30, mode is uniquely 9, median is (7+9)/2=8 which is not in the list, and all elements are positive integers. The sum of squares is 5^2 + 7^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 = 25 + 49 + 81 + 81 = 236.
