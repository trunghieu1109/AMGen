Question: Rectangles $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are drawn such that $D,E,C,F$ are collinear. Also, $A,D,H,G$ all lie on a circle. If $BC=16$,$AB=107$,$FG=17$, and $EF=184$, what is the length of $CE$?
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: We have two rectangles ABCD and EFGH with given side lengths. Points D, E, C, F are collinear, and points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. Assigning coordinates: A=(0,0), B=(107,0), C=(107,16), D=(0,16). Since D, E, C, F are collinear on the line y=16, let E=(x,16), F=(x+184,16). Then G=(x+184,-1), H=(x,-1) because FG=17 is vertical. The circle through A, D, H, G has center at the intersection of perpendicular bisectors of AD and HG. The perpendicular bisector of AD is y=8, and that of HG is x=x+92, so center is at (x+92,8). Equating distances from center to A and H gives (x+92)^2 + 64 = 92^2 + 9^2 = 8545, so (x+92)^2 = 8481. Taking square root, x+92 ≈ ±92.07, so x ≈ 0.07 or -184.07. The plausible value is x ≈ 0.07. Then CE = |107 - 0.07| ≈ 107. Hence, CE = 107.
