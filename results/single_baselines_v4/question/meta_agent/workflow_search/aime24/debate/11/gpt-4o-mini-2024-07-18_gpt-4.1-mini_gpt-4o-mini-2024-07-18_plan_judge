Question: Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.
[asy] size(10cm); usepackage("tikz");label("\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(2,0)--(2,3)--(5,3)--(5,8)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}",origin); label("\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(0,3)--(3,3)--(3,5)--(8,5)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}",E); [/asy]

proposed answer: The problem asks for the number of paths from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an 8x8 grid, moving only right (R) or up (U), with exactly 4 direction changes. Each path consists of 16 steps: 8 R and 8 U. A direction change occurs when the path switches from R to U or U to R. Having exactly 4 direction changes means the path is composed of 5 runs (segments) of consecutive moves in the same direction. The runs alternate directions, and the path can start with either R or U. 

Case 1: Start with R. Then the runs are R, U, R, U, R. The sum of the lengths of the R runs (3 runs) is 8, and the sum of the lengths of the U runs (2 runs) is 8. Each run length is at least 1. The number of positive integer solutions for the R runs is C(7,2) = 21, and for the U runs is C(7,1) = 7. Total for this case is 21 * 7 = 147.

Case 2: Start with U. Then the runs are U, R, U, R, U. The sum of the lengths of the U runs (3 runs) is 8, and the sum of the lengths of the R runs (2 runs) is 8. The counts are the same as case 1, so total is also 147.

Adding both cases, total number of such paths is 147 + 147 = 294.
