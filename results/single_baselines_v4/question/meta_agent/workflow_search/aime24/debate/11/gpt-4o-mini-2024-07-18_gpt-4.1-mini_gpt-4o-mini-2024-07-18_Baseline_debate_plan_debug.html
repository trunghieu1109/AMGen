    <pre>Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.
[asy] size(10cm); usepackage(&#34;tikz&#34;);label(&#34;\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(2,0)--(2,3)--(5,3)--(5,8)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}&#34;,origin); label(&#34;\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]\draw(0,0)grid(8,8);\draw[line width=2,red](0,0)--(0,3)--(3,3)--(3,5)--(8,5)--(8,8);\end{tikzpicture}&#34;,E); [/asy]

### thinking by Debate Agent s7az:
We are considering paths on an 8x8 grid from the lower left corner (0,0) to the upper right corner (8,8). Each path consists of 16 steps: 8 steps right (R) and 8 steps up (U). A path changes direction when it switches from R to U or from U to R. We want the number of paths with exactly 4 direction changes.

Step 1: Understand the problem.
- Total steps: 16 (8 R and 8 U)
- Exactly 4 direction changes means the path consists of 5 segments alternating between R and U.
- Since the path starts at (0,0) and ends at (8,8), the total number of R steps is 8 and total U steps is 8.

Step 2: Characterize the path segments.
- The path has 5 segments.
- The segments alternate directions: either R-U-R-U-R or U-R-U-R-U.
- Since the path must end at (8,8), the total number of R steps is 8 and total U steps is 8.

Step 3: Determine the possible patterns for segments.
- Number of segments = 5 (odd number)
- The path can start with R or U.

Case 1: Start with R
Segments: R, U, R, U, R
Number of R segments: 3
Number of U segments: 2
Sum of R steps in these 3 segments = 8
Sum of U steps in these 2 segments = 8

Case 2: Start with U
Segments: U, R, U, R, U
Number of U segments: 3
Number of R segments: 2
Sum of U steps in these 3 segments = 8
Sum of R steps in these 2 segments = 8

Step 4: Count the number of ways to distribute steps in each case.
- Each segment must have at least 1 step because a segment of length 0 would mean no direction change.

Case 1 (start with R):
- R segments: 3 segments summing to 8 steps, each &gt;=1
- U segments: 2 segments summing to 8 steps, each &gt;=1

Number of ways to split 8 into 3 positive integers = C(8-1,3-1) = C(7,2) = 21
Number of ways to split 8 into 2 positive integers = C(8-1,2-1) = C(7,1) = 7

Total ways for Case 1 = 21 * 7 = 147

Case 2 (start with U):
- U segments: 3 segments summing to 8 steps, each &gt;=1
- R segments: 2 segments summing to 8 steps, each &gt;=1

Number of ways to split 8 into 3 positive integers = 21 (same as above)
Number of ways to split 8 into 2 positive integers = 7 (same as above)

Total ways for Case 2 = 21 * 7 = 147

Step 5: Total number of paths with exactly 4 direction changes
= Case 1 + Case 2 = 147 + 147 = 294

Therefore, the number of such paths is 294.

### thinking by Debate Agent Za8y:
We are looking at paths from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an 8x8 grid, moving only right or up. Each path consists of 16 steps (8 rights and 8 ups). We want to count the number of such paths that change direction exactly 4 times.

Step 1: Understand the problem.
- Each path has 16 steps: 8 rights (R) and 8 ups (U).
- A direction change occurs when we switch from moving right to moving up, or vice versa.
- We want exactly 4 direction changes.

Step 2: Characterize the paths by direction changes.
- The path is a sequence of R and U moves.
- The path can be broken into runs of consecutive moves in the same direction.
- The number of runs is one more than the number of direction changes.
- Since we want exactly 4 direction changes, the path has 5 runs.

Step 3: Since the path starts at the lower left corner, it can start with either R or U.
- Letâ€™s consider both cases and then sum the results.

Step 4: Define variables.
- The path has 5 runs: run1, run2, run3, run4, run5.
- Runs alternate directions: if run1 is R, then run2 is U, run3 is R, run4 is U, run5 is R.
- Or if run1 is U, then run2 is R, run3 is U, run4 is R, run5 is U.

Step 5: The total number of Rs is 8, and total number of Us is 8.
- For the first case (run1 = R): runs 1,3,5 are R; runs 2,4 are U.
- So, sum of run1 + run3 + run5 = 8 (R steps)
- sum of run2 + run4 = 8 (U steps)

- For the second case (run1 = U): runs 1,3,5 are U; runs 2,4 are R.
- sum of run1 + run3 + run5 = 8 (U steps)
- sum of run2 + run4 = 8 (R steps)

Step 6: Each run length must be at least 1 (since a run of length 0 means no steps in that run).

Step 7: Count the number of positive integer solutions to these equations.
- For case 1 (start with R):
  run1 + run3 + run5 = 8 with run_i &gt;= 1
  run2 + run4 = 8 with run_i &gt;= 1

- Number of positive integer solutions for run1 + run3 + run5 = 8 is C(8-1, 3-1) = C(7,2) = 21
- Number of positive integer solutions for run2 + run4 = 8 is C(8-1, 2-1) = C(7,1) = 7

- Total number of sequences for case 1 is 21 * 7 = 147

- For case 2 (start with U):
  run1 + run3 + run5 = 8 with run_i &gt;= 1 (U runs)
  run2 + run4 = 8 with run_i &gt;= 1 (R runs)

- The counts are the same as case 1: 21 * 7 = 147

Step 8: Total number of paths with exactly 4 direction changes is sum of both cases:
147 + 147 = 294

Answer: 294

    <pre>The problem asks for the number of paths from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an 8x8 grid, moving only right (R) or up (U), with exactly 4 direction changes. Each path consists of 16 steps: 8 R and 8 U. A direction change occurs when the path switches from R to U or U to R. Having exactly 4 direction changes means the path is composed of 5 runs (segments) of consecutive moves in the same direction. The runs alternate directions, and the path can start with either R or U. 

Case 1: Start with R. Then the runs are R, U, R, U, R. The sum of the lengths of the R runs (3 runs) is 8, and the sum of the lengths of the U runs (2 runs) is 8. Each run length is at least 1. The number of positive integer solutions for the R runs is C(7,2) = 21, and for the U runs is C(7,1) = 7. Total for this case is 21 * 7 = 147.

Case 2: Start with U. Then the runs are U, R, U, R, U. The sum of the lengths of the U runs (3 runs) is 8, and the sum of the lengths of the R runs (2 runs) is 8. The counts are the same as case 1, so total is also 147.

Adding both cases, total number of such paths is 147 + 147 = 294.
