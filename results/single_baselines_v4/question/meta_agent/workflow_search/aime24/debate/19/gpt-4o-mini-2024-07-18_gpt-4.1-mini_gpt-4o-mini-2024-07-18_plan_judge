Question: Let $\omega\neq 1$ be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\]
is divided by 1000.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The problem is to find the remainder when \( \prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) \) is divided by 1000, where \( \omega \) is a 13th root of unity, \( \omega \neq 1 \). Both detailed solutions rewrite the term inside the product as \( (\omega^k - 1)^2 + 1 \) and then consider the roots \( y_k = \omega^k - 1 \) which satisfy \( (y_k + 1)^{13} = 1 \). The product becomes \( \prod (y_k^2 + 1) = \prod (y_k - i)(y_k + i) = T(i) T(-i) \) where \( T(x) = (x+1)^{13} - 1 \). Evaluating \( T(i) T(-i) \) leads to the expression \( 2^{13} - 2^{(13/2)+1} \cos(13\pi/4) + 1 \). Using trigonometric identities, \( \cos(13\pi/4) = -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \), and simplifying the powers of 2 and radicals, the product evaluates to 8321. Taking modulo 1000, the remainder is \( 8321 \mod 1000 = 321 \). The first solution's error was in the sign when computing the product of \( f(1+i)f(1-i) \), leading to a negative value and a different modulo result. The second solution's approach is more straightforward and consistent with the polynomial root approach and trigonometric simplifications. Therefore, the correct remainder is 321.
