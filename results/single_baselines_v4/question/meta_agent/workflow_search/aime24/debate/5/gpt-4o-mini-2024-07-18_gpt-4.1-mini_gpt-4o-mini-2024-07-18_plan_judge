Question: Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.

proposed answer: The problem describes a tetrahedron ABCD with edges AB=CD=√41, AC=BD=√80, and BC=AD=√89. We want the distance from the incenter I to each face, which is the inradius r. The inradius of a tetrahedron is given by r = 3V / S, where V is the volume and S is the total surface area. Using the Cayley-Menger determinant, the volume squared is computed as V^2 = 8196, so V = 2√2049. The surface area is the sum of the areas of the four triangular faces. Each face has sides √41, √80, and √89 in some order, so all faces have the same area. Using Heron's formula, the area of one face is approximately 27.5, so total surface area S = 110. Therefore, r = 3V / S = (3 * 2√2049) / 110 = (6√2049) / 110 = (3√2049) / 55. Simplifying √2049 = 3√227, so r = (9√227) / 55. Thus, m=9, n=227, p=55, and m+n+p=291.
