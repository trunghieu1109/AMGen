Question: Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations:
\[\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}\]\[\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}\]\[\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}\]
Then the value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: We are given the system of logarithmic equations involving positive real numbers x, y, and z:

log_2(x/(yz)) = 1/2,
log_2(y/(xz)) = 1/3,
log_2(z/(xy)) = 1/4.

By letting a = log_2 x, b = log_2 y, c = log_2 z, we rewrite the system as:

a - b - c = 1/2,
b - a - c = 1/3,
c - a - b = 1/4.

Adding all three equations gives:
-(a + b + c) = 13/12 => a + b + c = -13/12.

From the first equation, a = b + c + 1/2.
Substituting into the second equation and solving yields c = -5/12.
Using c in the third equation and the sum a + b + c, we find b = -3/8 and a = -7/24.

We want to find |log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)| = |4a + 3b + 2c|.
Calculating:
4a = -7/6,
3b = -9/8,
2c = -5/6.
Sum = -7/6 - 9/8 - 5/6 = -25/8.
Absolute value is 25/8.

Since 25 and 8 are coprime, m = 25, n = 8, so m + n = 33.
