Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: We are given a triangle ABC with circumcenter O and incenter I, circumradius R = 13, inradius r = 6, and the condition that IA is perpendicular to OI. Placing O at the origin, the circumcircle is x^2 + y^2 = 169. The incenter I lies inside the circle with distance OI = sqrt(13) from O, by Euler's formula OI^2 = R(R - 2r) = 13. The condition IA ⟂ OI implies (A - I) · I = 0, which leads to x_A x_I + y_A y_I = x_I^2 + y_I^2 = 13. Since A lies on the circumcircle, A satisfies x_A^2 + y_A^2 = 169. Calculating IA^2 = |A - I|^2 = 169 + 13 - 2*13 = 156. The power of point A with respect to the incircle is IA^2 - r^2 = 156 - 36 = 120. This power equals the product AB * AC. Therefore, AB * AC = 120.
