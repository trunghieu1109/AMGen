    <pre>Let $\triangle ABC$ have circumcenter $O$ and incenter $I$ with $\overline{IA}\perp\overline{OI}$, circumradius $13$, and inradius $6$. Find $AB\cdot AC$.

### thinking by Debate Agent d0Vo:
Given triangle ABC with circumcenter O and incenter I, we know the circumradius R = 13 and the inradius r = 6. The condition IA ⟂ OI means the segment from incenter I to vertex A is perpendicular to the segment from circumcenter O to incenter I.

We want to find AB * AC.

Step 1: Setup coordinate system.
Place O at the origin (0,0) since O is the circumcenter. The circumradius R = 13 means all vertices lie on the circle x² + y² = 169.

Step 2: Position I somewhere inside the circle, with coordinates (x_I, y_I).

Step 3: Since I is the incenter, it lies inside the triangle and the distance from I to each side is r = 6.

Step 4: The condition IA ⟂ OI means vector IA is perpendicular to vector OI. Since O is at (0,0), vector OI = (x_I, y_I).

Step 5: Let A = (x_A, y_A) lie on the circumcircle: x_A² + y_A² = 169.

Step 6: Vector IA = (x_A - x_I, y_A - y_I).

Step 7: Perpendicularity condition:
IA · OI = 0
=&gt; (x_A - x_I)*x_I + (y_A - y_I)*y_I = 0
=&gt; x_A x_I - x_I² + y_A y_I - y_I² = 0
=&gt; x_A x_I + y_A y_I = x_I² + y_I²

Step 8: Note that x_A x_I + y_A y_I = (A · I)

Step 9: Since A lies on the circle of radius 13 centered at O(0,0), A is a point on the circle.

Step 10: The above equation shows that the projection of A onto I equals the squared length of I.

Step 11: Now, the product AB * AC is related to the circumradius and angle at A:
AB * AC = R² * sin B * sin C / sin A
But this is complicated. Instead, use the formula:
AB * AC = AO² - (r²) / (sin²(A/2))
But without angle A, difficult.

Step 12: Use the Euler formula relating OI, R, r:
OI² = R(R - 2r)
OI² = 13 * (13 - 12) = 13 * 1 = 13
So distance OI = sqrt(13).

Step 13: Since OI = sqrt(13), and I is at (x_I, y_I), x_I² + y_I² = 13.

Step 14: From step 7, x_A x_I + y_A y_I = 13.

Step 15: Using Cauchy-Schwarz inequality:
|x_A x_I + y_A y_I| ≤ sqrt(x_A² + y_A²) * sqrt(x_I² + y_I²) = 13 * sqrt(13) ≈ 46.9

Step 16: But we have x_A x_I + y_A y_I = 13.

Step 17: Let’s parametrize A on the circle:
A = (13 cos θ, 13 sin θ)

Step 18: I = (x_I, y_I) with x_I² + y_I² = 13

Step 19: The dot product:
13 cos θ * x_I + 13 sin θ * y_I = 13
Divide both sides by 13:
cos θ * x_I + sin θ * y_I = 1

Step 20: The maximum value of cos θ * x_I + sin θ * y_I is sqrt(x_I² + y_I²) = sqrt(13) ≈ 3.6
1 is less than this, so there exists θ satisfying this.

Step 21: Now, the vector IA is perpendicular to OI, so IA · OI = 0.

Step 22: IA = A - I = (13 cos θ - x_I, 13 sin θ - y_I)

Step 23: IA · OI = (13 cos θ - x_I) * x_I + (13 sin θ - y_I) * y_I = 0
=&gt; 13 cos θ x_I - x_I² + 13 sin θ y_I - y_I² = 0
=&gt; 13 (cos θ x_I + sin θ y_I) = x_I² + y_I²

Step 24: From step 19, cos θ x_I + sin θ y_I = 1
From step 13, x_I² + y_I² = 13

Step 25: So 13 * 1 = 13, which matches step 24.

Step 26: So the conditions are consistent.

Step 27: Now, we want AB * AC.

Step 28: Using the formula for the power of point I with respect to the circumcircle:
Power of I = IO² - R² = 13 - 169 = -156

Step 29: The length IA is unknown, but we can use the following identity:
AB * AC = (IA)² - r²
This is a known relation when I is the incenter and IA ⟂ OI.

Step 30: To find IA², compute:
IA² = (x_A - x_I)² + (y_A - y_I)²
= x_A² - 2 x_A x_I + x_I² + y_A² - 2 y_A y_I + y_I²
= (x_A² + y_A²) + (x_I² + y_I²) - 2 (x_A x_I + y_A y_I)
= 169 + 13 - 2 * 13 = 182 - 26 = 156

Step 31: So IA² = 156

Step 32: Then AB * AC = IA² - r² = 156 - 36 = 120

Therefore, AB * AC = 120.

### thinking by Debate Agent 0KXU:
Given triangle ABC with circumcenter O and incenter I, we know the circumradius R = 13 and inradius r = 6. The condition IA ⟂ OI means the segment from I to vertex A is perpendicular to the segment from O to I. We want to find the product AB * AC.

Step 1: Place the triangle in coordinate plane for easier visualization.

Step 2: Since O is the circumcenter, we can place it at the origin (0,0). The circumradius is 13, so points A, B, C lie on the circle x^2 + y^2 = 169.

Step 3: The incenter I lies inside the triangle, and the inradius is 6.

Step 4: Given IA ⟂ OI, and O at origin, I at some point (x,y), and A on the circle. The vector OI = (x,y), vector IA = A - I.

Since IA ⟂ OI, their dot product is zero:
(OI) · (IA) = 0
=&gt; (x,y) · (A_x - x, A_y - y) = 0
=&gt; x(A_x - x) + y(A_y - y) = 0
=&gt; x A_x + y A_y = x^2 + y^2

Step 5: Since A lies on the circle x^2 + y^2 = 169, and I = (x,y), this relation holds.

Step 6: The incenter I is the intersection of angle bisectors; it can be expressed in terms of side lengths and coordinates, but we can also use the formula relating incenter, circumcenter, inradius, and circumradius.

Step 7: Use Euler&#39;s formula relating OI, R, and r:
OI^2 = R(R - 2r)
OI^2 = 13(13 - 12) = 13(1) = 13
So the distance OI = sqrt(13).

Step 8: So I lies at distance sqrt(13) from O at origin.

Step 9: Let I = (x,y) with x^2 + y^2 = 13.

Step 10: From step 4, for point A = (A_x, A_y) on the circle x^2 + y^2 = 169, we have:
x A_x + y A_y = 13

Step 11: The line equation x A_x + y A_y = 13 represents a line perpendicular to vector (x,y) at distance 13 / sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = 13 / sqrt(13) = sqrt(13) from origin.

Step 12: So A lies on the circle of radius 13 and on the line x A_x + y A_y = 13.

Step 13: The chord AB and AC are the other two points on the circle besides A. We want AB * AC.

Step 14: Using the power of point A with respect to the circle passing through B and C, the product AB * AC equals the power of point A with respect to the circle centered at I with radius r=6.

Step 15: Power of point A with respect to the incircle:
PA = AI^2 - r^2

Step 16: We can find AI^2:
AI^2 = (A_x - x)^2 + (A_y - y)^2
= (A_x^2 + A_y^2) - 2(x A_x + y A_y) + (x^2 + y^2)
= 169 - 2*13 + 13 = 169 - 26 + 13 = 156

Step 17: Thus, power of point A with respect to incircle is:
PA = 156 - 36 = 120

Step 18: The power of point A with respect to incircle equals AB * AC. Therefore,
AB * AC = 120.

    <pre>We are given a triangle ABC with circumcenter O and incenter I, circumradius R = 13, inradius r = 6, and the condition that IA is perpendicular to OI.

The condition IA ⟂ OI implies (A - I) · I = 0, which leads to x_A x_I + y_A y_I = x_I^2 + y_I^2 = 13. Since A lies on the circumcircle, A satisfies x_A^2 + y_A^2 = 169. Calculating IA^2 = |A - I|^2 = 169 + 13 - 2*13 = 156. The power of point A with respect to the incircle is IA^2 - r^2 = 156 - 36 = 120. This power equals the product AB * AC. Therefore, AB * AC = 120.
