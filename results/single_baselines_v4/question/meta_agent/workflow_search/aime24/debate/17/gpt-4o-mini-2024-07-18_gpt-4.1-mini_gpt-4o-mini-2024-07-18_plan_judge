Question: Find the number of triples of nonnegative integers \((a,b,c)\) satisfying \(a + b + c = 300\) and
\begin{equation*}
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.
\end{equation*}
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The problem asks for the number of triples (a,b,c) of nonnegative integers such that a+b+c=300 and a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000. Rewriting the second condition as 300(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) - (a^3 + b^3 + c^3) = 6,000,000 and using the identity for sum of cubes, we derive the relation 2,000,000 = 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc. Setting c = k, and a+b = 300 - k, the quadratic equation for a and b has roots 100 and 200 - k. For k in 0 to 200, both roots are nonnegative integers, giving solutions (100, 200 - k, k) and permutations thereof. At k=100, the triple is (100,100,100) with only 1 unique permutation; for other k, all three numbers are distinct, giving 6 permutations each. Thus, total solutions = 1 (for k=100) + 200*6 = 1201. The alternative solution claiming only (100,100,100) works is incorrect because the discriminant analysis shows a whole family of solutions. Therefore, the correct number of triples is 1201.
