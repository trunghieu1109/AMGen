    <pre>Find the number of triples of nonnegative integers \((a,b,c)\) satisfying \(a + b + c = 300\) and
\begin{equation*}
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.
\end{equation*}

### thinking by Debate Agent vZ8R:
We are given the equation a + b + c = 300, where a, b, c are nonnegative integers, and the condition a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000. 

First, rewrite the second condition: a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = a^2(b+c) + b^2(a+c) + c^2(a+b).

Since a + b + c = 300, we have b + c = 300 - a, a + c = 300 - b, and a + b = 300 - c. So the sum is:

S = a^2(300 - a) + b^2(300 - b) + c^2(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Expanding:
S = 300(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) - (a^3 + b^3 + c^3) = 6,000,000.

We know a + b + c = 300.

Recall the identity:
(a + b + c)^3 = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 3(a + b)(b + c)(c + a) - 3abc.

But this is complicated. Instead, let&#39;s consider the symmetric sums:

We want to express a^3 + b^3 + c^3 in terms of a + b + c, a^2 + b^2 + c^2, and abc.

Recall:
a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc.

We know a + b + c = 300.

Let S1 = a + b + c = 300
S2 = ab + bc + ca
S3 = abc

Also, a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = (a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca) = 300^2 - 2S2 = 90000 - 2S2.

Now, substitute into S:

S = 300(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) - (a^3 + b^3 + c^3)
= 300(90000 - 2S2) - [S1^3 - 3S1 S2 + 3S3]
= 300*90000 - 600 S2 - (300^3 - 3*300*S2 + 3S3)
= 27,000,000 - 600 S2 - (27,000,000 - 900 S2 + 3S3)
= 27,000,000 - 600 S2 - 27,000,000 + 900 S2 - 3 S3
= ( -600 S2 + 900 S2) - 3 S3
= 300 S2 - 3 S3.

Given S = 6,000,000,

6,000,000 = 300 S2 - 3 S3
Divide both sides by 3:
2,000,000 = 100 S2 - S3

So we have:
S3 = 100 S2 - 2,000,000.

Since a, b, c are nonnegative integers with sum 300, we want to find triples (a,b,c) such that S3 = abc = 100 S2 - 2,000,000.

Note S2 = ab + bc + ca, S3 = abc.

Since a,b,c are nonnegative integers, and sum 300, and the expression involves S2 and S3, let&#39;s try to find possible (a,b,c).

Try to find integer solutions to 100 S2 - S3 = 2,000,000.

Try some guesses:

If one variable is zero, say c=0, then a + b = 300.
Then S2 = ab + bc + ca = ab + 0 + 0 = ab
S3 = abc = 0
Equation becomes:
2,000,000 = 100 ab - 0 =&gt; ab = 20,000.

So for c=0, ab=20,000 and a + b = 300.

Find integer solutions (a,b) with a,b &gt;=0, a+b=300, ab=20,000.

ab=20,000
a+b=300
From a+b=300, b=300 - a
Then ab = a(300 - a) = 20,000
=&gt; 300 a - a^2 = 20,000
=&gt; a^2 - 300 a + 20,000 = 0
Discriminant D = 300^2 - 4*20,000 = 90,000 - 80,000 = 10,000
sqrt(D) = 100

Solutions:
a = (300 ± 100)/2 = (400/2, 200/2) = 200 or 100

So (a,b) = (200,100) or (100,200), c=0

Similarly, if b=0, c=0, then a=300, S2=0, S3=0 =&gt; 2,000,000=0 no

Try c=0 with (a,b) as above.

Check S = 6,000,000:
S = 300 S2 - 3 S3
S2 = ab = 20,000
S3 = 0
S = 300*20,000 - 0 = 6,000,000 correct.

So (a,b,c) = (100,200,0), (200,100,0), (100,0,200), (200,0,100), (0,100,200), (0,200,100) are solutions.

Now check if other solutions exist.

Try c=1:
a + b = 299
S2 = ab + bc + ca = ab + b*1 + a*1 = ab + a + b
S3 = abc = a b 1 = ab

Equation:
2,000,000 = 100 S2 - S3 = 100(ab + a + b) - ab = 100 ab + 100 a + 100 b - ab = (100 -1) ab + 100 a + 100 b = 99 ab + 100 a + 100 b

Since a + b = 299
So 2,000,000 = 99 ab + 100(299) = 99 ab + 29,900

=&gt; 99 ab = 2,000,000 - 29,900 = 1,970,100
=&gt; ab = 1,970,100 / 99 = 19,900

So ab = 19,900

Also a + b = 299

Try to solve:
a + b = 299
ab = 19,900

a,b roots of x^2 - 299 x + 19,900 = 0
Discriminant D = 299^2 - 4*19,900 = 89,401 - 79,600 = 9,801
sqrt(9,801) = 99

Solutions:
a = (299 ± 99)/2 = (398/2, 200/2) = 199 or 100

So (a,b) = (199,100), (100,199)

So solutions with c=1:
(a,b,c) = (199,100,1), (100,199,1), (199,1,100), (100,1,199), (1,199,100), (1,100,199)

Similarly, try c=2:
a + b = 298
S2 = ab + b*2 + a*2 = ab + 2a + 2b
S3 = abc = ab * 2 = 2 ab

Equation:
2,000,000 = 100 S2 - S3 = 100 (ab + 2a + 2b) - 2 ab = 100 ab + 200 a + 200 b - 2 ab = 98 ab + 200 a + 200 b

Since a + b = 298
2,000,000 = 98 ab + 200 * 298 = 98 ab + 59,600

=&gt; 98 ab = 2,000,000 - 59,600 = 1,940,400
=&gt; ab = 1,940,400 / 98 = 19,800

a + b = 298
ab = 19,800

Solve x^2 - 298 x + 19,800 = 0
Discriminant D = 298^2 - 4*19,800 = 88,804 - 79,200 = 9,604
sqrt(9,604) = 98

Roots:
a = (298 ± 98)/2 = (396/2, 200/2) = 198 or 100

So (a,b) = (198,100), (100,198)

Similarly, for c=3:
a + b = 297
S2 = ab + 3a + 3b
S3 = 3 ab

Equation:
2,000,000 = 100 S2 - S3 = 100 (ab + 3a + 3b) - 3 ab = 100 ab + 300 a + 300 b - 3 ab = 97 ab + 300 a + 300 b

a + b = 297
2,000,000 = 97 ab + 300 * 297 = 97 ab + 89,100

=&gt; 97 ab = 2,000,000 - 89,100 = 1,910,900
=&gt; ab = 1,910,900 / 97 = 19,700

a + b = 297
ab = 19,700

Solve x^2 - 297 x + 19,700 = 0
Discriminant D = 297^2 - 4*19,700 = 88,209 - 78,800 = 9,409
sqrt(9,409) = 97

Roots:
a = (297 ± 97)/2 = (394/2, 200/2) = 197 or 100

So (a,b) = (197,100), (100,197)

We see a pattern: for c = k, a + b = 300 - k, ab = 20,000 - 100 k
and the quadratic is x^2 - (300 - k) x + (20,000 - 100 k) = 0

We want the discriminant D = (300 - k)^2 - 4 (20,000 - 100 k) to be a perfect square.

Calculate D:
D = (300 - k)^2 - 4 (20,000 - 100 k) = (300 - k)^2 - 80,000 + 400 k
= (300 - k)^2 + 400 k - 80,000
= (300^2 - 600 k + k^2) + 400 k - 80,000
= 90,000 - 600 k + k^2 + 400 k - 80,000
= 10,000 - 200 k + k^2
= k^2 - 200 k + 10,000

We want D = m^2 for some integer m.

Rewrite:
D = k^2 - 200 k + 10,000 = m^2

Complete the square for k:
D = (k - 100)^2 - 10,000 + 10,000 = (k - 100)^2

Wait, check carefully:
(k - 100)^2 = k^2 - 200 k + 10,000
So D = (k - 100)^2

Therefore, discriminant is always a perfect square!

So for k = 0,1,...,300, the quadratic has integer roots:

Roots are:
x = [(300 - k) ± (k - 100)] / 2

Case 1: x = [(300 - k) + (k - 100)]/2 = (300 - k + k - 100)/2 = (200)/2 = 100

Case 2: x = [(300 - k) - (k - 100)]/2 = (300 - k - k + 100)/2 = (400 - 2k)/2 = 200 - k

So the roots are 100 and 200 - k.

Since a,b are roots, a,b = 100 and 200 - k in some order.

Check if both roots are nonnegative integers:

Since k ranges from 0 to 300,
- 100 is always positive.
- 200 - k &gt;= 0 =&gt; k &lt;= 200

So for k in 0 to 200, both roots are nonnegative integers.

For k &gt; 200, 200 - k &lt; 0, so no longer valid.

Also, sum a + b = 300 - k.

Check sum of roots:
100 + (200 - k) = 300 - k, matches.

Check product of roots:
100 * (200 - k) = 20,000 - 100 k, matches.

Therefore, for each k = 0 to 200, we have solutions:
(a,b,c) = (100, 200 - k, k) and (200 - k, 100, k)

Now, since a,b,c are symmetric, permutations of these triples are also solutions.

Count the number of distinct triples (a,b,c) with these values:

For each k in 0..200:
- The triple is (100, 200 - k, k)
- The three numbers are a,b,c = 100, 200 - k, k

We need to count the distinct permutations of these triples.

Check if all three numbers are distinct or if some are equal.

Check for equality:
- Is 100 = 200 - k?
=&gt; 200 - k = 100 =&gt; k = 100
- Is 100 = k?
=&gt; k = 100
- Is k = 200 - k?
=&gt; 2 k = 200 =&gt; k = 100

So at k=100, the triple is (100, 100, 100)

For k != 100, all three numbers are distinct.

Number of permutations:
- If all distinct: 3! = 6 permutations
- If two equal: 3 permutations
- If all equal: 1 permutation

So:
- For k = 100, triple is (100, 100, 100), only 1 unique triple
- For k != 100, triple has distinct numbers, 6 permutations

k ranges from 0 to 200 inclusive, total 201 values.

Number of solutions:
- For k=100: 1
- For other 200 values: 200 * 6 = 1200

Total number of solutions = 1200 + 1 = 1201

Therefore, the number of triples (a,b,c) of nonnegative integers satisfying the conditions is 1201.

### thinking by Debate Agent SWOO:
We need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a,b,c) such that a+b+c=300 and a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.

Step 1: Given a+b+c=300.

Step 2: Rewrite the second equation:
 a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.

Group terms:
= a^2(b+c) + b^2(a+c) + c^2(a+b)
But since a+b+c=300, b+c = 300 - a, a+c = 300 - b, a+b = 300 - c.

So the sum is:
= a^2(300 - a) + b^2(300 - b) + c^2(300 - c)
= 300(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) - (a^3 + b^3 + c^3)

Step 3: Use the identity for sum of cubes:
(a+b+c)^3 = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 3(a+b)(b+c)(c+a)
But this is complicated, let&#39;s try another approach.

Step 4: Note that the sum we want can be expressed as:
S = a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b
= sum over all i,j with i != j of a_i^2 a_j
This is symmetric in a,b,c.

Step 5: Since a,b,c are symmetric, try to find a simpler expression:
S = sum_{cyc} a^2 (b+c) = sum a^2 (300 - a) = 300 sum a^2 - sum a^3

Step 6: We know a+b+c=300, so sum a = 300.
We want S = 6,000,000 = 300 sum a^2 - sum a^3

Step 7: We can express sum a^3 in terms of sum a, sum a^2, and sum of products:
But it might be easier to test possible values.

Step 8: Try the case when a,b,c are equal:
a=b=c=100
Then sum a^2 = 3*10000=30000
sum a^3 = 3*1,000,000=3,000,000
S=300*30000 - 3,000,000 = 9,000,000 - 3,000,000 = 6,000,000
This matches the required sum.

Step 9: Check if other triples satisfy the condition.
Try a=100,b=100,c=100 is one solution.

Step 10: Since the problem is symmetric, and the expression is symmetric, the only solution is when a=b=c=100.

Step 11: Since the variables are nonnegative integers, the only triple is (100,100,100).

Step 12: So the number of such triples is 1.

    <pre>The problem asks for the number of triples (a,b,c) of nonnegative integers such that a+b+c=300 and a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000. Rewriting the second condition as 300(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) - (a^3 + b^3 + c^3) = 6,000,000 and using the identity for sum of cubes, we derive the relation 2,000,000 = 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc. Setting c = k, and a+b = 300 - k, the quadratic equation for a and b has roots 100 and 200 - k. For k in 0 to 200, both roots are nonnegative integers, giving solutions (100, 200 - k, k) and permutations thereof. At k=100, the triple is (100,100,100) with only 1 unique permutation; for other k, all three numbers are distinct, giving 6 permutations each. Thus, total solutions = 1 (for k=100) + 200*6 = 1201. The alternative solution claiming only (100,100,100) works is incorrect because the discriminant analysis shows a whole family of solutions. Therefore, the correct number of triples is 1201.
