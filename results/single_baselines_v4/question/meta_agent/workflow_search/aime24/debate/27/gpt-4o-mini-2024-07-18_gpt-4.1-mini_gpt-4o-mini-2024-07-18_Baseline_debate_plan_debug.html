    <pre>Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.

### thinking by Debate Agent pptR:
Let the four-digit number be represented as ABCD, where A, B, C, and D are its digits and A ≠ 0. We know that changing any one digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7.

Define the original number as N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

Changing each digit to 1 one at a time, we get four numbers:
1. Change A to 1: 1000*1 + 100B + 10C + D
2. Change B to 1: 1000A + 100*1 + 10C + D
3. Change C to 1: 1000A + 100B + 10*1 + D
4. Change D to 1: 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1

Each of these must be divisible by 7.

Let’s write these conditions modulo 7:

Let N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

Recall modulo 7:
1000 mod 7 = 1000 - 7*142 = 1000 - 994 = 6
100 mod 7 = 2
10 mod 7 = 3

So,
N mod 7 = (6A + 2B + 3C + D) mod 7

Now, the four changed numbers modulo 7:

1. Change A to 1:
(6*1 + 2B + 3C + D) mod 7 = (6 + 2B + 3C + D) mod 7

2. Change B to 1:
(6A + 2*1 + 3C + D) mod 7 = (6A + 2 + 3C + D) mod 7

3. Change C to 1:
(6A + 2B + 3*1 + D) mod 7 = (6A + 2B + 3 + D) mod 7

4. Change D to 1:
(6A + 2B + 3C + 1) mod 7

Each must be 0 mod 7:

So,
6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡ 0 (mod 7) (1)
6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡ 0 (mod 7) (2)
6A + 2B + 3 + D ≡ 0 (mod 7) (3)
6A + 2B + 3C + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 7) (4)

Subtract (4) from (1), (2), (3):

(1) - (4): (6 + 2B + 3C + D) - (6A + 2B + 3C + 1) ≡ 0 - 0 (mod 7)
=&gt; 6 + 2B + 3C + D - 6A - 2B - 3C - 1 ≡ 0
=&gt; 5 - 6A + D - D ≡ 0
=&gt; 5 - 6A ≡ 0 (mod 7)
=&gt; 5 ≡ 6A (mod 7)

(2) - (4): (6A + 2 + 3C + D) - (6A + 2B + 3C + 1) ≡ 0
=&gt; 2 + 3C + D - 2B - 3C - 1 ≡ 0
=&gt; 1 - 2B + D - D ≡ 0
=&gt; 1 - 2B ≡ 0 (mod 7)
=&gt; 1 ≡ 2B (mod 7)

(3) - (4): (6A + 2B + 3 + D) - (6A + 2B + 3C + 1) ≡ 0
=&gt; 3 + D - 3C - 1 ≡ 0
=&gt; 2 - 3C + D - D ≡ 0
=&gt; 2 - 3C ≡ 0 (mod 7)
=&gt; 2 ≡ 3C (mod 7)

So we have three congruences:
(5) 5 ≡ 6A (mod 7)
(6) 1 ≡ 2B (mod 7)
(7) 2 ≡ 3C (mod 7)

Solve each:

For (5):
6A ≡ 5 (mod 7)
Since 6 ≡ -1 mod 7, so -A ≡ 5 mod 7 =&gt; A ≡ -5 ≡ 2 mod 7
Possible A values (digits 1 to 9) congruent to 2 mod 7 are 2, 9 (since 9 mod 7 = 2)

For (6):
2B ≡ 1 (mod 7)
The inverse of 2 mod 7 is 4 because 2*4=8 ≡ 1 mod 7
So, B ≡ 4*1 = 4 mod 7
Possible B digits: 4, 11 (not digit), so B=4

For (7):
3C ≡ 2 (mod 7)
Inverse of 3 mod 7 is 5 because 3*5=15 ≡ 1 mod 7
So, C ≡ 5*2=10 ≡ 3 mod 7
Possible C digits: 3, 10(not digit), so C=3

Now, we have A in {2,9}, B=4, C=3.

Recall N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

From (4):
6A + 2B + 3C + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 7)
Calculate 6A + 2B + 3C + 1 mod 7 for A=9 and A=2, B=4, C=3:

For A=9:
6*9=54 ≡ 54 - 7*7=54 - 49=5 mod 7
2*4=8 ≡ 1 mod 7
3*3=9 ≡ 2 mod 7
Sum: 5 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 9 ≡ 2 mod 7 (not 0)

For A=2:
6*2=12 ≡ 5 mod 7
2*4=8 ≡ 1 mod 7
3*3=9 ≡ 2 mod 7
Sum: 5 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 9 ≡ 2 mod 7 (not 0)

This suggests a contradiction. But we must remember that D is a digit from 0 to 9.

Wait, in the earlier step, when subtracting (4) from (1), (2), (3), we canceled D incorrectly.

Re-examine the subtraction step:
(1) - (4):
(6 + 2B + 3C + D) - (6A + 2B + 3C + 1) ≡ 0
=&gt; 6 + 2B + 3C + D - 6A - 2B - 3C - 1 ≡ 0
=&gt; 5 + D - 6A ≡ 0 mod 7
=&gt; D ≡ 6A - 5 mod 7

Similarly for (2) - (4):
(6A + 2 + 3C + D) - (6A + 2B + 3C + 1) ≡ 0
=&gt; 2 + D - 2B - 1 ≡ 0
=&gt; 1 + D - 2B ≡ 0
=&gt; D ≡ 2B - 1 mod 7

For (3) - (4):
(6A + 2B + 3 + D) - (6A + 2B + 3C + 1) ≡ 0
=&gt; 3 + D - 3C - 1 ≡ 0
=&gt; 2 + D - 3C ≡ 0
=&gt; D ≡ 3C - 2 mod 7

So we have three expressions for D modulo 7:

D ≡ 6A - 5 mod 7
D ≡ 2B - 1 mod 7
D ≡ 3C - 2 mod 7

Since B=4 and C=3 from previous results, plug in:

D ≡ 2*4 - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7 ≡ 0 mod 7
D ≡ 3*3 - 2 = 9 - 2 = 7 ≡ 0 mod 7

So D ≡ 0 mod 7

Also, D ≡ 6A - 5 mod 7
Try A=2:
6*2 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7 ≡ 0 mod 7
Try A=9:
6*9 - 5 = 54 - 5 = 49 ≡ 0 mod 7

So for both A=2 and A=9, D ≡ 0 mod 7

Possible D digits are 0 or 7 (since digits 0-9).

We want the greatest four-digit number N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D with A in {2,9}, B=4, C=3, D in {0,7}.

Try A=9 (largest), B=4, C=3, D=7:
N= 9000 + 400 + 30 + 7 = 9437

Check if changing each digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7:

Change A to 1: 1437
1437 / 7 = 205.2857 (not integer)

So not divisible by 7.

Try D=0:
N= 9000 + 400 + 30 + 0 = 9430
Change A to 1: 1430 / 7 = 204.2857 (not integer)

Try A=2:
N= 2000 + 400 + 30 + 7 = 2437
Change A to 1: 1437 / 7 (already checked, no)
Try D=0:
N= 2430
Change A to 1: 1430 / 7 no

This suggests a problem with the approach. Let&#39;s check the divisibility explicitly for the four changed numbers for N=2430:

N=2430
Change A to 1: 1430 / 7 = 204.2857 no
Change B to 1: 2130 / 7 = 304.2857 no
Change C to 1: 2410 / 7 = 344.2857 no
Change D to 1: 2431 / 7 = 347.2857 no

Try N= 2437
Change A to 1: 1437 / 7 no
Change B to 1: 2137 / 7 no
Change C to 1: 2417 / 7 no
Change D to 1: 2431 / 7 no

Try N= 9437
Change A to 1: 1437 no
Try N= 9430
Change A to 1: 1430 no

Try to find D such that changing A to 1 gives a multiple of 7.

Change A to 1: 1000*1 + 100B + 10C + D = 1000 + 100*4 + 10*3 + D = 1430 + D
For this to be divisible by 7, 1430 + D ≡ 0 mod 7
1430 mod 7:
7*204=1428 remainder 2
So 1430 mod 7 = 2
So 2 + D ≡ 0 mod 7 =&gt; D ≡ 5 mod 7
Possible D digits: 5 or 12(not digit), so D=5

Similarly, change B to 1:
N = 1000A + 100*1 + 10C + D = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D
We want this divisible by 7.

Calculate modulo 7:
1000A mod 7 = 6A
100 mod 7 = 2
10C mod 7 = 3C
D mod 7 = D
Sum: 6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod 7

Change C to 1:
N = 1000A + 100B + 10*1 + D
Modulo 7: 6A + 2B + 3 + D ≡ 0 mod 7

Change D to 1:
N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1
Modulo 7: 6A + 2B + 3C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

From previous, B=4, C=3, D=5 (from first condition), A unknown.

Check change B to 1:
6A + 2 + 3*3 + 5 ≡ 0 mod 7
6A + 2 + 9 + 5 = 6A + 16 ≡ 0 mod 7
16 mod 7 = 2
So 6A + 2 ≡ 0 mod 7
6A ≡ -2 ≡ 5 mod 7
6A ≡ 5 mod 7
As before, 6 ≡ -1 mod 7, so -A ≡ 5 =&gt; A ≡ 2 mod 7
Possible A digits: 2, 9

Change C to 1:
6A + 2*4 + 3 + 5 ≡ 0 mod 7
6A + 8 + 3 + 5 = 6A + 16 ≡ 0 mod 7
Same as above, 6A ≡ 5 mod 7 =&gt; A ≡ 2 mod 7

Change D to 1:
6A + 2*4 + 3*3 + 1 = 6A + 8 + 9 + 1 = 6A + 18 ≡ 0 mod 7
18 mod 7 = 4
6A + 4 ≡ 0 mod 7
6A ≡ 3 mod 7
6A ≡ 3 mod 7
Since 6 ≡ -1 mod 7
-A ≡ 3 mod 7
A ≡ -3 ≡ 4 mod 7
Contradiction with previous A ≡ 2 mod 7

Try D=12 (not digit), no.

Try D=5 + 7 = 12 (not digit), no.

Try D=5 - 7 = -2 (not digit), no.

Try D=5 + 0*7 = 5

Try D=5 + 7*1 = 12 no.

Try D=5 + 7*2 = 19 no.

Try D=5 + 7*(-1) = -2 no.

Try D=5 + 7*(-2) = -9 no.

So only D=5 possible.

Try A=2:
Check last condition again:
6A + 2B + 3C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7
6*2 + 2*4 + 3*3 + 1 = 12 + 8 + 9 + 1 = 30 ≡ 30 - 28 = 2 mod 7
Not 0.

Try A=9:
6*9 + 8 + 9 + 1 = 54 + 18 = 72 + 1 = 73
73 mod 7 = 73 - 70 = 3
No.

Try to adjust D modulo 7 to satisfy last condition:
We have D ≡ 5 mod 7 from first condition.
Try D=5 or D=12(not digit)
Try D=5
Last condition: 6A + 2B + 3C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7
Calculate 6A + 2B + 3C + 1 mod 7
6A + 8 + 9 + 1 = 6A + 18 ≡ 6A + 4 mod 7
We want 6A + 4 ≡ 0 mod 7
6A ≡ 3 mod 7
6A ≡ 3 mod 7
As above, 6 ≡ -1 mod 7
-A ≡ 3 mod 7
A ≡ 4 mod 7
Possible A digits: 4 or 11(not digit)

Try A=4:
Check other conditions:
Change A to 1:
1430 + D divisible by 7
1430 mod 7 = 2
2 + D ≡ 0 mod 7
D ≡ 5 mod 7
D=5 or 12(no)

Change B to 1:
6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
6*4 + 2 + 3*3 + 5 = 24 + 2 + 9 + 5 = 40 ≡ 40 - 35 = 5 mod 7
Not 0

Try D=5 + 7 = 12 no
Try D=5 - 7 = -2 no

Try D=5 + 14 = 19 no

Try D=5 - 14 = -9 no

Try D=5 + 21 = 26 no

Try D=5 - 21 = -16 no

Try next possible D congruent to 5 mod 7 is 5
Try D=5
Try B=4
Try C=3
Try A=4
Doesn&#39;t satisfy all conditions.

Try B and C other values satisfying previous congruences:
From (6): 1 ≡ 2B mod 7
B ≡ 4 mod 7
B=4
From (7): 2 ≡ 3C mod 7
C ≡ 5*2=10 ≡ 3 mod 7
C=3

Try to find D such that all conditions hold.

Try D=5
Try A=4
Change B to 1:
6*4 + 2 + 3*3 + 5 = 24 + 2 + 9 + 5 = 40 mod 7 = 5 no
Try A=11 no digit
Try A=4 no
Try A=2
6*2 + 2 + 9 + 5 = 12 + 2 + 9 + 5 = 28 mod 7=0 yes

So A=2, B=4, C=3, D=5

Check all changed numbers:
Change A to 1:
1430 + 5 = 1435
1435 / 7 = 205 exactly
Change B to 1:
6*2 + 2 + 9 + 5 = 28 mod 7=0
Number: 2135
2135 / 7 = 305 exactly
Change C to 1:
2431
2431 / 7 = 347 exactly
Change D to 1:
2431
2431 / 7 = 347 exactly

So N=2435

Q and R when N divided by 1000:
Q = floor(2435 / 1000) = 2
R = 2435 % 1000 = 435

Q + R = 2 + 435 = 437

### thinking by Debate Agent 5d72:
Let the four-digit number be N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d, where a, b, c, d are digits (0-9) and a ≠ 0. We want the greatest four-digit number N such that changing any one digit to 1 produces a number divisible by 7.

Step 1: Changing the thousands digit to 1 means the number becomes 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d. This number must be divisible by 7.

Step 2: Changing the hundreds digit to 1 means the number becomes 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d = 1000a + 100 + 10c + d. This number must be divisible by 7.

Step 3: Changing the tens digit to 1 means the number becomes 1000a + 100b + 10*1 + d = 1000a + 100b + 10 + d. This number must be divisible by 7.

Step 4: Changing the units digit to 1 means the number becomes 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1. This number must be divisible by 7.

We want to find digits a,b,c,d that satisfy all these divisibility conditions and maximize N.

Let’s denote:
N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d

From Step 1: 1000 + 100b + 10c + d ≡ 0 (mod 7)
From Step 2: 1000a + 100 + 10c + d ≡ 0 (mod 7)
From Step 3: 1000a + 100b + 10 + d ≡ 0 (mod 7)
From Step 4: 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 7)

We want to find a,b,c,d digits (a from 1 to 9, b,c,d from 0 to 9) satisfying these.

Calculate mod 7 for powers of 10:
10^3 = 1000 ≡ 6 (mod 7) because 1000/7 = 142 remainder 6
10^2 = 100 ≡ 2 (mod 7) because 98 is divisible by 7, remainder 2
10^1 = 10 ≡ 3 (mod 7) because 7*1=7 remainder 3
10^0 = 1 ≡ 1 (mod 7)

Rewrite each congruence modulo 7:

Step 1:
1000 + 100b + 10c + d ≡ 0 (mod 7)
6 + 2b + 3c + d ≡ 0 (mod 7)

Step 2:
1000a + 100 + 10c + d ≡ 0 (mod 7)
6a + 2 + 3c + d ≡ 0 (mod 7)

Step 3:
1000a + 100b + 10 + d ≡ 0 (mod 7)
6a + 2b + 3 + d ≡ 0 (mod 7)

Step 4:
1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 7)
6a + 2b + 3c + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 7)

We have four congruences:
(1) 6 + 2b + 3c + d ≡ 0 (mod 7)
(2) 6a + 2 + 3c + d ≡ 0 (mod 7)
(3) 6a + 2b + 3 + d ≡ 0 (mod 7)
(4) 6a + 2b + 3c + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 7)

Subtract (1) from (2):
(6a + 2 + 3c + d) - (6 + 2b + 3c + d) ≡ 0 (mod 7)
6a + 2 + 3c + d - 6 - 2b - 3c - d ≡ 0
6a + 2 - 6 - 2b ≡ 0
6a - 2b - 4 ≡ 0 (mod 7)

Subtract (1) from (3):
(6a + 2b + 3 + d) - (6 + 2b + 3c + d) ≡ 0
6a + 2b + 3 + d - 6 - 2b - 3c - d ≡ 0
6a + 3 - 6 - 3c ≡ 0
6a - 3c - 3 ≡ 0 (mod 7)

Subtract (1) from (4):
(6a + 2b + 3c + 1) - (6 + 2b + 3c + d) ≡ 0
6a + 2b + 3c + 1 - 6 - 2b - 3c - d ≡ 0
6a + 1 - 6 - d ≡ 0
6a - d - 5 ≡ 0 (mod 7)

So we have:
(5) 6a - 2b ≡ 4 (mod 7)
(6) 6a - 3c ≡ 3 (mod 7)
(7) 6a - d ≡ 5 (mod 7)

We want to find digits a,b,c,d with a in 1..9, b,c,d in 0..9 satisfying these.

Rewrite:
6a - 2b ≡ 4 (mod 7)
6a - 3c ≡ 3 (mod 7)
6a - d ≡ 5 (mod 7)

We can try values for a from 9 down to 1 to maximize N.

Calculate 6a mod 7 for a=9 down to 1:
6*9=54 mod7=54-49=5
6*8=48 mod7=48-42=6
6*7=42 mod7=0
6*6=36 mod7=1
6*5=30 mod7=2
6*4=24 mod7=3
6*3=18 mod7=4
6*2=12 mod7=5
6*1=6 mod7=6

Try a=9 (6a=5):
(5) 5 - 2b ≡ 4 =&gt; -2b ≡ -1 =&gt; 2b ≡ 1 (mod7)
Try b=4: 2*4=8 ≡ 1 (mod7) OK
Try b=4

(6) 5 - 3c ≡ 3 =&gt; -3c ≡ -2 =&gt; 3c ≡ 2 (mod7)
Try c=3: 3*3=9 ≡ 2 (mod7) OK

(7) 5 - d ≡ 5 =&gt; -d ≡ 0 =&gt; d ≡ 0 (mod7)
Try d=0 or 7
Try d=0 (smaller digit to maximize number)

Check if digits are valid: a=9,b=4,c=3,d=0

Check the original four conditions:
(1) 6 + 2b + 3c + d = 6 + 8 + 9 + 0 = 23 ≡ 2 (mod7) NOT 0
So (1) is not satisfied, so discard this.

Try d=7:
(1) 6 + 8 + 9 + 7 = 30 ≡ 2 (mod7) still 2, no.

Try b=4 is the only b that satisfies 2b=1 mod7? b=4 works.
Try b=4
Try c=3
Try d=0 or 7 no
Try c=10 not possible
Try c=3
Try d=7 no

Try a=8 (6a=6):
(5) 6 - 2b ≡ 4 =&gt; -2b ≡ -2 =&gt; 2b ≡ 2 (mod7)
b=1: 2*1=2 OK
Try b=1

(6) 6 - 3c ≡ 3 =&gt; -3c ≡ -3 =&gt; 3c ≡ 3 (mod7)
c=1:3*1=3 OK
Try c=1

(7) 6 - d ≡5 =&gt; -d ≡ -1 =&gt; d ≡1 (mod7)
Try d=1 or 8
Try d=8

Check (1): 6 + 2b + 3c + d = 6 + 2*1 + 3*1 + 8 = 6 + 2 + 3 + 8 = 19 ≡ 5 (mod7) no
Try d=1:
6 + 2 + 3 + 1 = 12 ≡ 5 no

Try a=7 (6a=0):
(5) 0 - 2b ≡ 4 =&gt; -2b ≡ 4 =&gt; 2b ≡ 3 (mod7)
Try b=5: 2*5=10 ≡ 3 (mod7) OK
Try b=5

(6) 0 -3c ≡ 3 =&gt; -3c ≡ 3 =&gt; 3c ≡ 4 (mod7)
Try c=6:3*6=18 ≡ 4 (mod7) OK
Try c=6

(7) 0 - d ≡ 5 =&gt; -d ≡ 5 =&gt; d ≡ 2 (mod7)
Try d=2 or 9
Try d=9

Check (1): 6 + 2b + 3c + d = 6 + 10 + 18 + 9 = 43 ≡ 1 (mod7) no
Try d=2:
6 + 10 + 18 + 2 = 36 ≡ 1 no

Try a=6 (6a=1):
(5) 1 - 2b ≡ 4 =&gt; -2b ≡ 3 =&gt; 2b ≡ 4
Try b=2: 2*2=4 OK

(6) 1 - 3c ≡ 3 =&gt; -3c ≡ 2 =&gt; 3c ≡ 5
Try c=4: 3*4=12 ≡ 5 OK

(7) 1 - d ≡ 5 =&gt; -d ≡ 4 =&gt; d ≡ 3
Try d=3 or 10(no)

Check (1): 6 + 2b + 3c + d = 6 + 4 + 12 + 3 = 25 ≡ 4 no

Try a=5 (6a=2):
(5) 2 - 2b ≡ 4 =&gt; -2b ≡ 2 =&gt; 2b ≡ 5
Try b=6: 2*6=12 ≡ 5 OK

(6) 2 - 3c ≡ 3 =&gt; -3c ≡ 1 =&gt; 3c ≡ 6
Try c=2: 3*2=6 OK

(7) 2 - d ≡ 5 =&gt; -d ≡ 3 =&gt; d ≡ 4
Try d=4 or 11(no)

Check (1): 6 + 2b + 3c + d = 6 + 12 + 6 + 4 = 28 ≡ 0 (mod7) OK

All conditions hold for a=5, b=6, c=2, d=4

Check all original four conditions:
(1) 6 + 2b + 3c + d = 6 + 12 + 6 + 4 = 28 mod7=0
(2) 6a + 2 + 3c + d = 2 + 2 + 6 + 4 = 14 mod7=0
(3) 6a + 2b + 3 + d = 2 + 12 + 3 + 4 = 21 mod7=0
(4) 6a + 2b + 3c + 1 = 2 + 12 + 6 + 1 = 21 mod7=0

All good.

N = 1000*5 + 100*6 + 10*2 + 4 = 5624

Check if there&#39;s a bigger number with a&gt;5? a=6 failed, a=7 failed, a=8 failed, a=9 failed.

So N=5624

Now Q and R are quotient and remainder when N is divided by 1000:
Q = floor(5624/1000) = 5
R = 5624 mod 1000 = 624

Q + R = 5 + 624 = 629

    <pre>The problem requires finding the greatest four-digit number N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D such that changing any one digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. Using modular arithmetic with mod 7 and the fact that 1000 ≡ 6, 100 ≡ 2, 10 ≡ 3 mod 7, we set up four congruences for the four cases of digit changes. After simplifying, we get a system of congruences involving A, B, C, D modulo 7. Solving these congruences and checking digit constraints, the first approach found N=2435 with Q+R=437, but it was not the greatest number. The second approach tried values of A from 9 down to 1 and found that only for A=5, B=6, C=2, D=4 all conditions hold, giving N=5624. This is greater than 2435 and satisfies all conditions. Therefore, the greatest such number is 5624, and Q = 5, R = 624, so Q+R=629.
