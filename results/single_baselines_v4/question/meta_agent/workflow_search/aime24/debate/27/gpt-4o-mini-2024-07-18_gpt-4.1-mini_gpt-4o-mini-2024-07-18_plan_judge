Question: Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The problem requires finding the greatest four-digit number N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D such that changing any one digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. Using modular arithmetic with mod 7 and the fact that 1000 ≡ 6, 100 ≡ 2, 10 ≡ 3 mod 7, we set up four congruences for the four cases of digit changes. After simplifying, we get a system of congruences involving A, B, C, D modulo 7. Solving these congruences and checking digit constraints, the first approach found N=2435 with Q+R=437, but it was not the greatest number. The second approach tried values of A from 9 down to 1 and found that only for A=5, B=6, C=2, D=4 all conditions hold, giving N=5624. This is greater than 2435 and satisfies all conditions. Therefore, the greatest such number is 5624, and Q = 5, R = 624, so Q+R=629.
