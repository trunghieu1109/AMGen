Question: Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.

proposed answer: Let the dimensions of the box be x, y, z. Given surface area 54, we have 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54, so xy + yz + zx = 27. Given volume 23, xyz = 23. The smallest sphere containing the box has radius r = (1/2) * sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2), so r^2 = (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)/4. Using the identity (x + y + z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + zx), we get x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x + y + z)^2 - 54. Minimizing r^2 is equivalent to minimizing (x + y + z)^2. Assume y = z = t and x = s. Then 2 s t + t^2 = 27 and s t^2 = 23. From s t^2 = 23, s = 23 / t^2. Substitute into surface area: 2 (23 / t^2) t + t^2 = 27 => 2 * 23 / t + t^2 = 27 => t^3 - 27 t + 46 = 0. t=2 is a root. Then s = 23 / 4 = 5.75. Sum S = s + 2 t = 5.75 + 4 = 9.75 = 39/4. Then x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = S^2 - 54 = (39/4)^2 - 54 = 1521/16 - 864/16 = 657/16. Therefore, r^2 = (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)/4 = (657/16)/4 = 657/64. p = 657, q = 64, so p + q = 721.
