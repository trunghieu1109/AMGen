Question: Eight circles of radius $34$ are sequentially tangent, and two of the circles are tangent to $AB$ and $BC$ of triangle $ABC$, respectively. $2024$ circles of radius $1$ can be arranged in the same manner. The inradius of triangle $ABC$ can be expressed as $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: The problem involves placing n circles of radius r tangent to each other and to the sides AB and BC of triangle ABC at vertex B. The centers of these circles lie along the angle bisector of angle B. The distance from B to the center of the first circle is r, and the centers are spaced 2r apart. Thus, the distance from B to the center of the last circle is r(2n - 1). The inradius R of the triangle ABC is the radius of the incircle tangent to AB, BC, and AC, and its center lies along the angle bisector at a distance R / sin(B/2) from B. Since the last circle is tangent to BC, its center is at distance r from BC, so the distance from B to the center of the last circle equals R / sin(B/2). Therefore, R / sin(B/2) = r(2n - 1). Given two sets of circles: (n=8, r=34) and (n=2024, r=1), both arranged in the same triangle, the inradius R and angle B are fixed. So, R / sin(B/2) = 34 * 15 = 510 and also R / sin(B/2) = 1 * 4047 = 4047, which is a contradiction. To resolve this, we use the formula for the radius of each circle in the chain: r = R * sin(B/2) / (1 + (n - 1) * sin(B/2)). Setting up equations for both cases and equating R, we find sin(B/2) = 11/595 and R = 22848/11. Thus, the inradius R = 22848/11, and m + n = 22848 + 11 = 22859.
