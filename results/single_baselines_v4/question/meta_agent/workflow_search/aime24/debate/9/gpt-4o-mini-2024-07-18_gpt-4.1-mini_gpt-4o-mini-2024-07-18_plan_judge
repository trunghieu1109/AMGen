Question: Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1, 2, ..., 10}. The lottery also picks 4 distinct numbers from S. The total number of ways to pick 4 numbers from 10 is C(10,4) = 210. We fix Jen's chosen 4 numbers as set J. The lottery's chosen set is L. The number of ways for L to have exactly k numbers in common with J is C(4,k) * C(6,4-k), since there are 4 numbers in J and 6 numbers not in J. We want the probability that Jen wins the grand prize (all 4 numbers match, i.e., |J ∩ L| = 4) given that she wins a prize (at least 2 numbers match, i.e., |J ∩ L| ≥ 2). Calculate the number of outcomes for each k: k=4: C(4,4)*C(6,0) = 1*1=1; k=3: C(4,3)*C(6,1) = 4*6=24; k=2: C(4,2)*C(6,2) = 6*15=90. Total outcomes for winning a prize = 1+24+90=115. Probability = number of grand prize outcomes / number of prize outcomes = 1/115. The fraction is in lowest terms, so m=1, n=115, and m+n=116.
