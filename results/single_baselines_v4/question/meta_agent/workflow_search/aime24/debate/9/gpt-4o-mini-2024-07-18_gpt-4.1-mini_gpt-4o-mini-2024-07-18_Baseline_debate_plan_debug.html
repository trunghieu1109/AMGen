    <pre>Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

### thinking by Debate Agent qVu3:
First, let&#39;s identify the total number of ways to choose 4 distinct numbers from S = {1, 2, ..., 10}. This is C(10,4).

Jen picks 4 distinct numbers. The lottery also picks 4 distinct numbers randomly from S.

Jen wins a prize if at least 2 of her chosen numbers are among the 4 randomly chosen numbers.

Jen wins the grand prize if all 4 of her numbers are chosen.

We want the probability that Jen wins the grand prize given that she won a prize.

Step 1: Total number of possible 4-number draws: C(10,4) = 210.

Step 2: Fix Jen&#39;s chosen 4 numbers (call this set J). The lottery picks 4 numbers (call this set L).

Number of ways for L to have exactly k numbers in common with J is:
C(4,k) * C(6,4-k), where 6 = 10 - 4 (the numbers not in J).

We want to find:
- Number of outcomes where |J ∩ L| = 4 (grand prize)
- Number of outcomes where |J ∩ L| ≥ 2 (prize)

Calculate these:

|J ∩ L| = 4:
C(4,4) * C(6,0) = 1 * 1 = 1

|J ∩ L| = 3:
C(4,3) * C(6,1) = 4 * 6 = 24

|J ∩ L| = 2:
C(4,2) * C(6,2) = 6 * 15 = 90

Sum for at least 2 common numbers:
1 + 24 + 90 = 115

Probability that Jen wins grand prize given she won a prize = (number of outcomes with 4 common) / (number of outcomes with at least 2 common) = 1/115.

The fraction is 1/115, which is in lowest terms.

Therefore, m = 1, n = 115, and m + n = 116.

### thinking by Debate Agent wGMd:
First, we determine the total number of ways to choose 4 distinct numbers from the set S of 10 numbers. This is \( \binom{10}{4} = 210 \).

Jen picks 4 distinct numbers. The lottery also picks 4 distinct numbers from S.

Jen wins a prize if at least 2 of her numbers match the lottery&#39;s 4 chosen numbers.

We want the probability that Jen&#39;s 4 numbers exactly match the lottery&#39;s 4 numbers (grand prize), given that she won a prize (at least 2 matches).

Step 1: Calculate the number of ways the lottery can pick numbers such that Jen has exactly k matches with the lottery&#39;s numbers, for k = 0,1,2,3,4.

Jen&#39;s numbers are fixed: call this set J.

- Number of ways for the lottery to pick exactly k of Jen&#39;s numbers and (4-k) from the other 6 numbers (since 10 - 4 = 6).

Number of lottery picks with exactly k matches = \( \binom{4}{k} \times \binom{6}{4-k} \).

Compute these:
- k=0: \( \binom{4}{0} \times \binom{6}{4} = 1 \times 15 = 15 \)
- k=1: \( \binom{4}{1} \times \binom{6}{3} = 4 \times 20 = 80 \)
- k=2: \( \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{6}{2} = 6 \times 15 = 90 \)
- k=3: \( \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{6}{1} = 4 \times 6 = 24 \)
- k=4: \( \binom{4}{4} \times \binom{6}{0} = 1 \times 1 = 1 \)

Step 2: Number of ways where Jen wins a prize (at least 2 matches) = sum for k=2 to 4 = 90 + 24 + 1 = 115.

Step 3: Number of ways where Jen wins the grand prize (all 4 matches) = 1.

Step 4: Probability of grand prize given Jen wins a prize = \( \frac{1}{115} \).

This fraction is already in lowest terms.

Thus, \( m = 1 \), \( n = 115 \), and \( m + n = 116 \).

We fix Jen&#39;s chosen 4 numbers as set J. The lottery&#39;s chosen set is L.
