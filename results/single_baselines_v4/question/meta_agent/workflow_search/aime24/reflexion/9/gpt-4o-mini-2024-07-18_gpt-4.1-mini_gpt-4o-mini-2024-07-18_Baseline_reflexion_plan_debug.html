    <pre>Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

    <pre>First, we determine the total number of ways to choose 4 distinct numbers from the set S of 10 numbers: C(10,4).

Jen picks 4 distinct numbers. The winning numbers are also 4 distinct numbers chosen from S.

She wins a prize if at least 2 of her numbers are in the winning numbers.

We want P(grand prize | won a prize) = P(all 4 match) / P(at least 2 match).

Step 1: Total ways to choose 4 numbers from 10: C(10,4) = 210.

Step 2: Number of ways for Jen to pick her 4 numbers: also C(10,4) = 210 (but fixed for this problem).

Step 3: Probability that the winning 4 numbers are exactly Jen&#39;s 4 numbers (grand prize): 1 / 210.

Step 4: Calculate the number of winning 4-number sets that have at least 2 numbers in common with Jen&#39;s chosen 4 numbers.

Let Jen&#39;s chosen set be J with 4 numbers.

We count the number of 4-number subsets W of S such that |J ∩ W| ≥ 2.

We can count by intersection size k = 2, 3, 4.

Number of subsets W with exactly k common numbers with J:
- Choose k numbers from J: C(4,k)
- Choose (4 - k) numbers from S \\ J (the 6 numbers not in J): C(6, 4 - k)

So total number with at least 2 common numbers:
= sum_{k=2 to 4} C(4,k) * C(6, 4 - k)

Calculate each term:
- k=2: C(4,2)*C(6,2) = 6 * 15 = 90
- k=3: C(4,3)*C(6,1) = 4 * 6 = 24
- k=4: C(4,4)*C(6,0) = 1 * 1 = 1

Sum = 90 + 24 + 1 = 115

So P(at least 2 match) = 115 / 210.

P(grand prize | won a prize) = P(all 4 match) / P(at least 2 match) = (1/210) / (115/210) = 1/115.

Thus, m/n = 1/115, so m + n = 1 + 115 = 116.
