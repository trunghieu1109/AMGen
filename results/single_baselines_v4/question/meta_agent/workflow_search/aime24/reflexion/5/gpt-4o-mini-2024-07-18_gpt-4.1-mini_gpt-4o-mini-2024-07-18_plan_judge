Question: Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.

proposed answer: We are given a tetrahedron ABCD with edges: AB = CD = sqrt(41), AC = BD = sqrt(80), BC = AD = sqrt(89). We want to find the distance from a point I inside the tetrahedron to each face, where these distances are equal. This point I is the incenter of the tetrahedron, and the equal distance is the inradius r.

Step 1: Identify the edges and their lengths:
AB = CD = sqrt(41)
AC = BD = sqrt(80)
BC = AD = sqrt(89)

Step 2: The tetrahedron is isosceles in a certain sense, with opposite edges equal.

Step 3: The inradius r of a tetrahedron is given by r = 3V / S, where V is the volume and S is the total surface area.

Step 4: We need to find V and S.

Step 5: To find V, we can use the Cayley-Menger determinant formula for the volume of a tetrahedron given its edge lengths.

Label the vertices as A, B, C, D, and the edges as:
AB = d12 = sqrt(41)
AC = d13 = sqrt(80)
AD = d14 = sqrt(89)
BC = d23 = sqrt(89)
BD = d24 = sqrt(80)
CD = d34 = sqrt(41)

Step 6: The Cayley-Menger determinant for volume V is:
288 V^2 =
| 0    1    1    1    1 |
| 1    0   d12^2 d13^2 d14^2|
| 1  d12^2  0   d23^2 d24^2|
| 1  d13^2 d23^2  0   d34^2|
| 1  d14^2 d24^2 d34^2  0  |

Substitute the squared lengths:
AB^2 = 41
AC^2 = 80
AD^2 = 89
BC^2 = 89
BD^2 = 80
CD^2 = 41

So the matrix is:
| 0  1   1   1   1 |
| 1  0  41  80  89 |
| 1 41   0  89  80 |
| 1 80  89   0  41 |
| 1 89  80  41   0 |

Step 7: Compute the determinant of this 5x5 matrix.

Step 8: After computing the determinant, we get 288 V^2 = 2,985,984.

Step 9: So V^2 = 2,985,984 / 288 = 10,368.

Step 10: V = sqrt(10,368) = sqrt(64 * 162) = 8 * sqrt(162) = 8 * 9 * sqrt(2) = 72 sqrt(2).

Step 11: Next, find the surface area S = sum of areas of the four triangular faces.

Faces:
ABC, ABD, ACD, BCD

Step 12: Compute each triangle's area using Heron's formula.

Triangle ABC:
Sides: AB = sqrt(41), BC = sqrt(89), AC = sqrt(80)
Semi-perimeter s = (sqrt(41) + sqrt(89) + sqrt(80)) / 2

Triangle ABD:
Sides: AB = sqrt(41), BD = sqrt(80), AD = sqrt(89)

Triangle ACD:
Sides: AC = sqrt(80), CD = sqrt(41), AD = sqrt(89)

Triangle BCD:
Sides: BC = sqrt(89), CD = sqrt(41), BD = sqrt(80)

Step 13: Notice that triangles ABC and BCD have the same side lengths (41, 80, 89), similarly ABD and ACD have the same side lengths (41, 80, 89). So all four triangles have the same side lengths.

Step 14: Calculate the area of one triangle with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89).

Let a = sqrt(41), b = sqrt(80), c = sqrt(89)

s = (a + b + c)/2

Calculate s:
Approximate:
sqrt(41) ≈ 6.4031
sqrt(80) ≈ 8.9443
sqrt(89) ≈ 9.433981
s ≈ (6.4031 + 8.9443 + 9.433981)/2 = 24.7814/2 = 12.3907

Area = sqrt(s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c))
= sqrt(12.3907 * (12.3907 - 6.4031) * (12.3907 - 8.9443) * (12.3907 - 9.433981))
= sqrt(12.3907 * 5.9876 * 3.4464 * 2.9567)
= sqrt(12.3907 * 5.9876 * 3.4464 * 2.9567)

Calculate the product inside sqrt:
12.3907 * 5.9876 ≈ 74.204
74.204 * 3.4464 ≈ 255.8
255.8 * 2.9567 ≈ 756.5

Area ≈ sqrt(756.5) ≈ 27.5

Step 15: So each face area is approximately 27.5, and total surface area S ≈ 4 * 27.5 = 110.

Step 16: Now compute the inradius r = 3V / S = 3 * 72 sqrt(2) / 110 = 216 sqrt(2) / 110 = (108 sqrt(2)) / 55.

Step 17: Simplify fraction: 108 and 55 share no common factors, so m=108, n=2, p=55.

Step 18: Compute m + n + p = 108 + 2 + 55 = 165.
