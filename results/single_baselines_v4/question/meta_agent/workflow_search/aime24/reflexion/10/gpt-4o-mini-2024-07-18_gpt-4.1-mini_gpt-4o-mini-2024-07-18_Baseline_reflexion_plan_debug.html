    <pre>Given rectangles ABCD and EFGH, with points D, E, C, F collinear and points A, D, H, G concyclic. We know the side lengths: BC = 16, AB = 107 for rectangle ABCD, and FG = 17, EF = 184 for rectangle EFGH. Since ABCD is a rectangle, AB is length and BC is width. Similarly, EFGH is a rectangle with EF as length and FG as width. The points D, E, C, F are collinear, meaning these points lie on a straight line. We want to find CE. Let&#39;s analyze the configuration:

1. Rectangle ABCD: AB = 107 (length), BC = 16 (width).
2. Rectangle EFGH: EF = 184 (length), FG = 17 (width).
3. Points D, E, C, F are collinear.
4. Points A, D, H, G lie on a circle.

Since ABCD is a rectangle, coordinates can be assigned for convenience:
- Let A = (0,0)
- B = (107,0)
- C = (107,16)
- D = (0,16)

Similarly, for EFGH, since EF = 184 and FG = 17, and EFGH is a rectangle, we can assign coordinates relative to E:
- Let E = (x,y)
- F = (x + 184, y)
- G = (x + 184, y + 17)
- H = (x, y + 17)

Given that D, E, C, F are collinear:
- D = (0,16)
- C = (107,16)
- E = (x,y)
- F = (x + 184, y)

Since D, E, C, F are collinear, they lie on the same line.

Points D and C lie on the line y = 16.

Therefore, for E and F to be collinear with D and C, E and F must also lie on y = 16.

So, y = 16.

Therefore:
- E = (x,16)
- F = (x + 184,16)

Now, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle.
- A = (0,0)
- D = (0,16)
- H = (x, 16 + 17) = (x,33)
- G = (x + 184, 33)

We need to find x such that A, D, H, G are concyclic.

The four points are:
A(0,0), D(0,16), H(x,33), G(x+184,33)

The circle passing through these points must satisfy the concyclicity condition.

Using the property that the points are concyclic, the power of point or the determinant condition can be used.

Alternatively, the perpendicular bisectors of chords AD and HG must intersect at the same point.

Calculate the center of the circle passing through A and D:
- Midpoint of AD: M1 = (0,8)
- Slope of AD: infinite (vertical line)
- Perpendicular bisector of AD: horizontal line y = 8

Calculate the center of the circle passing through H and G:
- Midpoint of HG: M2 = ((x + (x + 184))/2, (33 + 33)/2) = (x + 92, 33)
- Slope of HG: (33 - 33)/(x + 184 - x) = 0
- Perpendicular bisector of HG: vertical line x = x + 92

The center of the circle is at the intersection of y = 8 and x = x + 92.

So center = (x + 92, 8)

Now, the radius squared is distance from center to A:
r^2 = (x + 92 - 0)^2 + (8 - 0)^2 = (x + 92)^2 + 64

Also, radius squared is distance from center to D:
r^2 = (x + 92 - 0)^2 + (8 - 16)^2 = (x + 92)^2 + 64

Consistent.

Check radius squared from center to H:
r^2 = (x + 92 - x)^2 + (8 - 33)^2 = 92^2 + 25^2 = 8464 + 625 = 9089

Set equal to previous r^2:
(x + 92)^2 + 64 = 9089

(x + 92)^2 = 9089 - 64 = 9025

Take square root:
x + 92 = Â±95

Two cases:
1) x + 92 = 95 =&gt; x = 3
2) x + 92 = -95 =&gt; x = -187

Now, E = (x,16), F = (x + 184,16)

Calculate CE:
C = (107,16)
E = (x,16)

Distance CE = |107 - x|

For x = 3, CE = 104
For x = -187, CE = 294

Since EF = 184, and E = (x,16), F = (x + 184,16), the length EF is 184, consistent.

Therefore, CE can be either 104 or 294.

But since EFGH is a rectangle, and points D, E, C, F are collinear, and given the dimensions, the more reasonable length is CE = 104.

Hence, the length of CE is 104.
