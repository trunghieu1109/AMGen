Question: Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.

proposed answer: Reconsider the problem using the power of a point theorem and the given triangle side lengths. Place points B and C on the x-axis at (0,0) and (9,0) respectively. Find coordinates of A using the distances AB=5 and AC=10, yielding A = (1/3, (4*sqrt(14))/3). The center O of the circumcircle lies on the perpendicular bisector of BC, so h=4.5. Solving for k gives k = 33/(4*sqrt(14)). The tangents at B and C have slopes negative reciprocal to OB and OC respectively, intersecting at D = (4.5, -27*sqrt(14)/11). Using the power of a point theorem at D: DB^2 = DA * DP. Calculate DB^2 and DA, then solve for DP. Finally, AP = AD + DP. Simplifying the fractions carefully, AP = 45/7. Thus, m=45, n=7, and m+n=52.
