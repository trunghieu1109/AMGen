    <pre>Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?

    <pre>We have a regular octagon with 8 vertices, each independently colored red or blue with equal probability 1/2. We want the probability that there exists a rotation of the octagon such that all blue vertices move to positions originally colored red. Equivalently, there is a rotation g in the cyclic group of order 8 (rotations by 0, 1, ..., 7 vertices) such that the set of blue vertices B satisfies B ∩ g(B) = ∅, or more simply, g(B) ⊆ R, where R is the set of red vertices (the complement of B).

Since the coloring is random, the probability is the expected fraction of colorings for which there exists a rotation g (other than the identity) such that g(B) ⊆ R.

Step 1: Define the group G = {r^0, r^1, ..., r^7} where r is rotation by 1 vertex.

Step 2: For each non-identity rotation g = r^k (k=1,...,7), consider the condition g(B) ⊆ R. Since R = complement of B, this means B ∩ g(B) = ∅.

Step 3: We want the probability that there exists k in {1,...,7} such that B ∩ r^k(B) = ∅.

Step 4: Use inclusion-exclusion over the events A_k = {colorings where B ∩ r^k(B) = ∅}.

Step 5: Compute |A_k| for each k.

Note: The coloring is a function f: {0,...,7} -&gt; {red, blue}, or equivalently a subset B of {0,...,7} (the blue vertices).

Condition B ∩ r^k(B) = ∅ means no vertex is blue and its image under r^k is also blue.

Step 6: For each k, analyze the orbits of r^k on the vertices.

The order of r^k is 8 / gcd(8,k).

- k=1 or 7: order 8
- k=2 or 6: order 4
- k=3 or 5: order 8
- k=4: order 2

Step 7: For each k, the vertices split into cycles of length equal to the order of r^k.

For example, k=1: one cycle of length 8 (all vertices in one cycle)

Step 8: The condition B ∩ r^k(B) = ∅ means that in each cycle, no two adjacent vertices in the cycle are both blue (since r^k moves each vertex to the next in the cycle).

Because r^k is a rotation by k vertices, the edges in the cycle correspond to pairs (v, v+k mod 8).

So the condition is that in each cycle, the subset of blue vertices is an independent set in the cycle graph of length equal to the cycle length.

Step 9: For k=1, the cycle length is 8. The number of subsets of an 8-cycle with no two adjacent vertices blue is the number of independent sets in C8.

The number of independent sets in a cycle C_n is known: it is L_n + L_{n-2}, where L_n is the n-th Lucas number.

Lucas numbers: L_0=2, L_1=1, L_2=3, L_3=4, L_4=7, L_5=11, L_6=18, L_7=29, L_8=47

Number of independent sets in C8 = L_8 + L_6 = 47 + 18 = 65

Step 10: For k=1, |A_1| = 65 (number of blue subsets with no two adjacent vertices blue in the 8-cycle).

Since the coloring is random, total number of subsets is 2^8=256.

Probability of A_1 is 65/256.

Step 11: For k=2, order is 4, so the vertices split into 2 cycles of length 4 each.

Each cycle of length 4 has number of independent sets = L_4 + L_2 = 7 + 3 = 10.

Since the two cycles are independent, total number of subsets with no two adjacent blue vertices in each cycle is 10 * 10 = 100.

So |A_2| = 100.

Probability of A_2 = 100/256.

Similarly for k=6 (same as k=2), |A_6|=100.

Step 12: For k=3, order is 8, same as k=1, |A_3|=65.

Similarly for k=5, |A_5|=65.

Step 13: For k=4, order is 2, so vertices split into 4 cycles of length 2.

Number of independent sets in C2 is L_2 + L_0 = 3 + 2 = 5.

So |A_4| = 5^4 = 625.

Probability of A_4 = 625/256, but this is impossible since total subsets are 256. So this suggests a mistake.

Wait, the total number of subsets is 256, so |A_4| cannot be 625.

Mistake: The number of independent sets in C2 is 3 (since C2 is a 2-cycle: vertices 0 and 1 connected).

Independent sets in C2:
- empty set
- {0}
- {1}

So 3 independent sets.

So L_2 + L_0 = 3 + 2 = 5 is incorrect for C2.

Actually, the formula for number of independent sets in C_n is F_{n+2} + F_n, where F_n is Fibonacci numbers, or the Lucas number formula is L_n + L_{n-2} for n&gt;=3.

Better to count directly for C2:
- empty set
- {v0}
- {v1}

Total 3 independent sets.

So for cycle length 2, number of independent sets is 3.

Therefore, |A_4| = 3^4 = 81.

Probability of A_4 = 81/256.

Step 14: Summarize |A_k|:
- k=1,3,5,7 (order 8): 65
- k=2,6 (order 4): 100
- k=4 (order 2): 81

Step 15: Use inclusion-exclusion to find probability of union of A_k for k=1 to 7.

We want P = P(∪_{k=1}^7 A_k).

Step 16: Compute sum of |A_k|:
Sum1 = 4*65 + 2*100 + 81 = 260 + 200 + 81 = 541

Step 17: Compute intersections |A_i ∩ A_j|.

The condition for intersection is that the blue set is independent in the graphs formed by edges of both rotations.

The edges for each rotation correspond to edges between vertices v and v+k mod 8.

The union of edges for two rotations is the union of their edge sets.

We need to find the number of subsets that are independent sets in the union graph of edges from rotations i and j.

Step 18: This is complicated, but we can use the fact that the group is cyclic and the edges correspond to chords of length k.

The union of edges for rotations k and l is the graph with edges between v and v+k mod 8 and between v and v+l mod 8.

Step 19: For example, consider A_1 ∩ A_2:
Edges of A_1: edges of length 1 (adjacent vertices)
Edges of A_2: edges of length 2

Union graph has edges of length 1 and 2.

We want number of independent sets in this graph.

Step 20: The graph with edges of length 1 and 2 on 8 vertices is a graph where each vertex is connected to its neighbors at distance 1 and 2.

This is a circulant graph with connection set {1,2}.

Step 21: The number of independent sets in such a graph can be computed by dynamic programming or known formulas.

Step 22: Similarly, we compute |A_i ∩ A_j| for all pairs.

Step 23: Then compute triple intersections, etc., and apply inclusion-exclusion.

Step 24: Alternatively, use Burnside&#39;s lemma or group action counting.

Step 25: The problem is equivalent to counting the number of colorings fixed by some rotation g ≠ identity, where blue vertices map to red vertices.

Step 26: The probability that there exists a rotation g ≠ e such that g(B) ⊆ R is equal to the probability that the coloring is not asymmetric under the group action.

Step 27: Using Burnside&#39;s lemma, the number of colorings fixed by rotation r^k is 2^{number of cycles of r^k}.

Number of cycles of r^k is gcd(8,k).

Step 28: The total number of colorings is 2^8=256.

Step 29: The number of colorings fixed by r^k is 2^{gcd(8,k)}.

Step 30: The number of colorings with a nontrivial symmetry is the union over k=1 to 7 of colorings fixed by r^k.

Step 31: By Burnside&#39;s lemma, the number of colorings with nontrivial symmetry is:
|S| = sum_{k=0}^7 2^{gcd(8,k)} - number of asymmetric colorings

Step 32: Number of asymmetric colorings = total colorings - number of colorings with nontrivial symmetry

Step 33: sum_{k=0}^7 2^{gcd(8,k)} =
- k=0: gcd(8,0)=8 =&gt; 2^8=256
- k=1: gcd(8,1)=1 =&gt; 2^1=2
- k=2: gcd(8,2)=2 =&gt; 2^2=4
- k=3: gcd(8,3)=1 =&gt; 2
- k=4: gcd(8,4)=4 =&gt; 2^4=16
- k=5: gcd(8,5)=1 =&gt; 2
- k=6: gcd(8,6)=2 =&gt; 4
- k=7: gcd(8,7)=1 =&gt; 2
Sum = 256 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 16 + 2 + 4 + 2 = 288

Step 34: Number of asymmetric colorings = (1/8)*288 = 36

Step 35: So number of colorings with nontrivial symmetry = 256 - 36 = 220

Step 36: The problem asks for the probability that there exists a rotation g such that all blue vertices move to red vertices.

This is exactly the probability that the coloring is symmetric under some nontrivial rotation.

Step 37: So the probability is 220/256 = 55/64.

Step 38: Therefore, m/n = 55/64, and m+n = 55 + 64 = 119.
