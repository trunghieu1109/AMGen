    <pre>Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins.

    <pre>We have a game where two players, Alice and Bob, take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens from a stack of n tokens. Alice goes first. The player who takes the last token wins. We want to find the number of positive integers n ≤ 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy regardless of Alice&#39;s moves. This means that for those n, the position is losing for the first player (Alice), so the second player (Bob) can always win.

Let&#39;s analyze the game using the concept of winning and losing positions:
- A position is losing if the player to move has no winning moves.
- A position is winning if the player to move can move to a losing position.

Define P(n) as the position with n tokens remaining, and the player to move is about to play.

Base case:
- P(0): no tokens left, so the player to move cannot move, so P(0) is losing.

For n &gt; 0:
- P(n) is winning if there exists a move removing 1 or 4 tokens that leads to a losing position.
- P(n) is losing if all moves lead to winning positions.

Let&#39;s compute P(n) for small n:

P(0): losing (L)
P(1): can remove 1 -&gt; P(0) which is L, so P(1) is winning (W)
P(2): can remove 1 -&gt; P(1) = W, can remove 4 (not possible), so all moves lead to W, so P(2) is losing (L)
P(3): remove 1 -&gt; P(2) = L, so P(3) = W
P(4): remove 1 -&gt; P(3) = W, remove 4 -&gt; P(0) = L, so P(4) = W
P(5): remove 1 -&gt; P(4) = W, remove 4 -&gt; P(1) = W, all moves lead to W, so P(5) = L

So far:
0: L
1: W
2: L
3: W
4: W
5: L

Continue a bit more:
P(6): remove 1 -&gt; P(5) = L, so W
P(7): remove 1 -&gt; P(6) = W, remove 4 -&gt; P(3) = W, all W, so L
P(8): remove 1 -&gt; P(7) = L, so W
P(9): remove 1 -&gt; P(8) = W, remove 4 -&gt; P(5) = L, so W
P(10): remove 1 -&gt; P(9) = W, remove 4 -&gt; P(6) = W, all W, so L

Positions:
0: L
1: W
2: L
3: W
4: W
5: L
6: W
7: L
8: W
9: W
10: L

L positions are at n = 0, 2, 5, 7, 10
Let&#39;s look for a pattern in losing positions (L):
0, 2, 5, 7, 10
Differences: 2, 3, 2, 3
Try to find a formula or pattern:
Check modulo 5:
0 mod 5 = 0 (L)
2 mod 5 = 2 (L)
5 mod 5 = 0 (L)
7 mod 5 = 2 (L)
10 mod 5 = 0 (L)

So losing positions are those where n mod 5 = 0 or 2.

Check if this holds for other values:
P(12): 12 mod 5 = 2
Remove 1 -&gt; P(11), unknown
Remove 4 -&gt; P(8) = W
If P(11) is W, then P(12) is L
Check P(11): 11 mod 5 = 1
Remove 1 -&gt; P(10) = L
So P(11) = W
Therefore, P(12) = L
So yes, n mod 5 = 0 or 2 are losing positions.

Since Alice goes first, Bob wins if the initial position is losing for Alice, i.e., if n mod 5 = 0 or 2.

We want the count of positive integers n ≤ 2024 such that n mod 5 = 0 or 2.

Count of n ≤ 2024 with n mod 5 = 0:
Multiples of 5 up to 2024: floor(2024/5) = 404

Count of n ≤ 2024 with n mod 5 = 2:
Numbers of the form 5k + 2 ≤ 2024
5k + 2 ≤ 2024 =&gt; 5k ≤ 2022 =&gt; k ≤ 404
k = 0 to 404 gives 405 numbers

Total = 404 + 405 = 809

Answer: 809
