Question: Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: We have a game where two players, Alice and Bob, take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens from a stack of n tokens. Alice goes first. The player who takes the last token wins. We want to find the number of positive integers n ≤ 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy regardless of Alice's moves. This means that for those n, the position is losing for the first player (Alice), so the second player (Bob) can always win.

Let's analyze the game using the concept of winning and losing positions:
- A position is losing if the player to move has no winning moves.
- A position is winning if the player to move can move to a losing position.

Define P(n) as the position with n tokens remaining, and the player to move is about to play.

Base case:
- P(0): no tokens left, so the player to move cannot move, so P(0) is losing.

For n > 0:
- P(n) is winning if there exists a move removing 1 or 4 tokens that leads to a losing position.
- P(n) is losing if all moves lead to winning positions.

Let's compute P(n) for small n:

P(0): losing (L)
P(1): can remove 1 -> P(0) which is L, so P(1) is winning (W)
P(2): can remove 1 -> P(1) = W, can remove 4 (not possible), so all moves lead to W, so P(2) is losing (L)
P(3): remove 1 -> P(2) = L, so P(3) = W
P(4): remove 1 -> P(3) = W, remove 4 -> P(0) = L, so P(4) = W
P(5): remove 1 -> P(4) = W, remove 4 -> P(1) = W, all moves lead to W, so P(5) = L

So far:
0: L
1: W
2: L
3: W
4: W
5: L

Continue a bit more:
P(6): remove 1 -> P(5) = L, so W
P(7): remove 1 -> P(6) = W, remove 4 -> P(3) = W, all W, so L
P(8): remove 1 -> P(7) = L, so W
P(9): remove 1 -> P(8) = W, remove 4 -> P(5) = L, so W
P(10): remove 1 -> P(9) = W, remove 4 -> P(6) = W, all W, so L

Positions:
0: L
1: W
2: L
3: W
4: W
5: L
6: W
7: L
8: W
9: W
10: L

L positions are at n = 0, 2, 5, 7, 10
Let's look for a pattern in losing positions (L):
0, 2, 5, 7, 10
Differences: 2, 3, 2, 3
Try to find a formula or pattern:
Check modulo 5:
0 mod 5 = 0 (L)
2 mod 5 = 2 (L)
5 mod 5 = 0 (L)
7 mod 5 = 2 (L)
10 mod 5 = 0 (L)

So losing positions are those where n mod 5 = 0 or 2.

Check if this holds for other values:
P(12): 12 mod 5 = 2
Remove 1 -> P(11), unknown
Remove 4 -> P(8) = W
If P(11) is W, then P(12) is L
Check P(11): 11 mod 5 = 1
Remove 1 -> P(10) = L
So P(11) = W
Therefore, P(12) = L
So yes, n mod 5 = 0 or 2 are losing positions.

Since Alice goes first, Bob wins if the initial position is losing for Alice, i.e., if n mod 5 = 0 or 2.

We want the count of positive integers n ≤ 2024 such that n mod 5 = 0 or 2.

Count of n ≤ 2024 with n mod 5 = 0:
Multiples of 5 up to 2024: floor(2024/5) = 404

Count of n ≤ 2024 with n mod 5 = 2:
Numbers of the form 5k + 2 ≤ 2024
5k + 2 ≤ 2024 => 5k ≤ 2022 => k ≤ 404
k = 0 to 404 gives 405 numbers

Total = 404 + 405 = 809
