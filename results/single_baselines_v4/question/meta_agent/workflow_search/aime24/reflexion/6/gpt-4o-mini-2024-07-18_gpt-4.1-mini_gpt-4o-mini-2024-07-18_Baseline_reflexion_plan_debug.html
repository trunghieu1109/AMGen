    <pre>Let the dimensions of the rectangular box be x, y, z. We have two conditions:
1) Surface area: 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 =&gt; xy + yz + zx = 27
2) Volume: xyz = 23

We want to find the smallest sphere radius r that can contain the box. The smallest sphere containing the box will have radius equal to half the space diagonal of the box:

r = (1/2) * sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)

We want to find the maximum possible value of r^2 over all boxes with the given constraints, because the problem states &#34;Let r be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of B&#34;. So r must be at least as large as the radius needed to contain any box in B. So r^2 = max ( (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)/4 ) over all (x,y,z) with xy + yz + zx = 27 and xyz = 23.

We want to maximize x^2 + y^2 + z^2 given the constraints.

Note that (x + y + z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + zx)
=&gt; x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x + y + z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx) = (x + y + z)^2 - 54

So maximizing x^2 + y^2 + z^2 is equivalent to maximizing (x + y + z)^2.

We have constraints:
xy + yz + zx = 27
xyz = 23

We want to maximize x + y + z.

Let s = x + y + z.

The cubic polynomial with roots x, y, z is:
t^3 - s t^2 + 27 t - 23 = 0

We want to find the maximum possible s such that the roots are positive real numbers.

Since the problem is symmetric, and the constraints are symmetric, the maximum sum s occurs when two variables are equal (by symmetry and inequality reasoning).

Let y = z = t, x = a.

Then:
xy + yz + zx = a t + t^2 + a t = 2 a t + t^2 = 27
xyz = a t^2 = 23

From xyz = 23, a = 23 / t^2

Substitute into surface area sum:
2 a t + t^2 = 27
2 * (23 / t^2) * t + t^2 = 27
2 * 23 / t + t^2 = 27
46 / t + t^2 = 27

Multiply both sides by t:
46 + t^3 = 27 t

Rearranged:
t^3 - 27 t + 46 = 0

We want to find positive roots t of this cubic.

Try to find roots:
Try t=1: 1 - 27 + 46 = 20 &gt; 0
Try t=2: 8 - 54 + 46 = 0
So t=2 is a root.

Divide cubic by (t - 2):
(t^3 - 27 t + 46) / (t - 2) = t^2 + 2 t - 23

Solve t^2 + 2 t - 23 = 0
Discriminant = 4 + 92 = 96
Roots: t = (-2 ± sqrt(96)) / 2 = (-2 ± 4 sqrt(6)) / 2 = -1 ± 2 sqrt(6)

Positive root: -1 + 2 sqrt(6) ≈ -1 + 4.89898 = 3.89898

So roots of cubic are t = 2, t = -1 + 2 sqrt(6), and t = -1 - 2 sqrt(6) (negative, discard)

So possible t values are 2 and 3.89898.

Check which t gives positive a:
a = 23 / t^2

For t=2: a = 23 / 4 = 5.75 &gt; 0
For t=3.89898: a = 23 / (3.89898)^2 ≈ 23 / 15.2 ≈ 1.513 &gt; 0

Calculate s = a + 2 t
For t=2: s = 5.75 + 4 = 9.75
For t=3.89898: s = 1.513 + 7.79796 = 9.31096

So maximum s is 9.75 when t=2, a=5.75

Now compute x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = s^2 - 2 * 27 = s^2 - 54
s^2 = 9.75^2 = 95.0625
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 95.0625 - 54 = 41.0625

Then r^2 = (x^2 + y^2 + z^2) / 4 = 41.0625 / 4 = 10.265625

Convert 10.265625 to fraction:
10 + 0.265625
0.265625 = 17/64
So r^2 = 10 + 17/64 = (640 + 17)/64 = 657/64

p = 657, q = 64

p + q = 657 + 64 = 721
