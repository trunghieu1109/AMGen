    <pre>Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.

Please think step by step and then solve the task.</pre>

    <pre>Let s be the walking speed in km/h, and t be the time spent in the coffee shop in minutes. The total time for the first scenario is 4 hours, which includes walking time plus t minutes in the coffee shop. The walking distance is 9 km. So, walking time at speed s is 9/s hours. Total time is 9/s + t/60 = 4 hours. Similarly, for the second scenario, speed is s+2 km/h, total time is 2 hours 24 minutes = 2.4 hours. So, 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4. We have two equations: 9/s + t/60 = 4 and 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4. Subtracting the second from the first: 9/s - 9/(s+2) = 4 - 2.4 = 1.6. Simplify: 9[(s+2) - s]/[s(s+2)] = 1.6 =&gt; 9*2 / [s(s+2)] = 1.6 =&gt; 18 / [s(s+2)] = 1.6 =&gt; s(s+2) = 18 / 1.6 = 11.25. So, s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0. Solve quadratic: s = [-2 ± sqrt(4 + 45)]/2 = [-2 ± 7]/2. Positive root: ( -2 + 7 ) / 2 = 5/2 = 2.5 km/h. Now find t: 9/s + t/60 = 4 =&gt; 9/2.5 + t/60 = 4 =&gt; 3.6 + t/60 = 4 =&gt; t/60 = 0.4 =&gt; t = 24 minutes. Now, for speed s + 0.5 = 2.5 + 0.5 = 3 km/h, walking time = 9/3 = 3 hours. Total time including coffee shop = 3 hours + 24 minutes = 3 hours 24 minutes = 204 minutes.
