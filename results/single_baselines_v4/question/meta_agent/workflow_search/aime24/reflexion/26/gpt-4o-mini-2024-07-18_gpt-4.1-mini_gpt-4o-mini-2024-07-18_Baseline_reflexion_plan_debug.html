    <pre>Let A be the set chosen by Alice. Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers such that the maximum element of B is in A. We want to find the sum of the elements of A given that the total number of such sets B is 2024.

Step 1: Understand the problem.
- For each element a in A, consider all finite nonempty sets B with max(B) = a.
- The sets B are subsets of positive integers, finite and nonempty.
- The maximum element of B is a, so B contains a, and all other elements of B are positive integers less than or equal to a.

Step 2: Count the number of sets B for a fixed a.
- Since max(B) = a, B must contain a.
- The other elements of B are from {1, 2, ..., a-1}.
- The number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., a-1} is 2^(a-1).
- Each such subset combined with {a} forms a set B with max(B) = a.
- So, for each a, the number of sets B with max(B) = a is 2^(a-1).

Step 3: Total number of sets B for all a in A.
- The total number of sets B is the sum over all a in A of 2^(a-1).
- Given that this total is 2024, we have:
  sum_{a in A} 2^(a-1) = 2024

Step 4: Express 2024 in terms of powers of 2.
- Let&#39;s write 2024 in binary or as a sum of powers of 2.
- 2024 in binary:
  2024 / 2 = 1012 remainder 0
  1012 / 2 = 506 remainder 0
  506 / 2 = 253 remainder 0
  253 / 2 = 126 remainder 1
  126 / 2 = 63 remainder 0
  63 / 2 = 31 remainder 1
  31 / 2 = 15 remainder 1
  15 / 2 = 7 remainder 1
  7 / 2 = 3 remainder 1
  3 / 2 = 1 remainder 1
  1 / 2 = 0 remainder 1

  So binary is read from bottom to top: 11111101000
  Let&#39;s write powers of 2:
  2^10 = 1024
  2^9 = 512
  2^8 = 256
  2^7 = 128
  2^6 = 64
  2^5 = 32
  2^4 = 16
  2^3 = 8
  2^2 = 4
  2^1 = 2
  2^0 = 1

  2024 = 1024 + 512 + 256 + 128 + 64 + 32 + 8
  = 2^10 + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^3

Step 5: Recall that sum_{a in A} 2^(a-1) = 2024
- So the set {a-1 | a in A} corresponds to the exponents in the sum above.
- Therefore, the exponents are {10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 3}
- So a-1 in {10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 3}
- Hence, A = {11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 4}

Step 6: Find the sum of elements of A.
- sum = 11 + 10 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 4
- sum = (11 + 10) + (9 + 8) + (7 + 6) + 4
- sum = 21 + 17 + 13 + 4
- sum = 21 + 17 = 38; 38 + 13 = 51; 51 + 4 = 55
