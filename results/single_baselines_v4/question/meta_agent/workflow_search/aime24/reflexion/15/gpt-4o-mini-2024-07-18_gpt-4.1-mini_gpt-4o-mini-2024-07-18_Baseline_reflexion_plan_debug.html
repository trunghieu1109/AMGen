    <pre>Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.

    <pre>Let&#39;s denote the sets as follows: D = diamond ring owners, G = golf clubs owners, S = garden spade owners, C = candy hearts owners. We know: |D| = 195, |G| = 367, |S| = 562, |C| = 900 (since all own candy hearts). Total residents = 900. Number of residents owning exactly two of these things = 437. Number of residents owning exactly three of these things = 234. We want to find the number of residents owning all four things, i.e., |D ∩ G ∩ S ∩ C|. Since everyone owns candy hearts, owning candy hearts is universal, so the problem reduces to finding the number of residents owning all three of the other items (D, G, S) plus candy hearts. Let&#39;s define: x = number of residents owning all four things. We know: - Exactly two items: 437 residents - Exactly three items: 234 residents - Exactly four items: x residents We also know that everyone owns candy hearts, so the sets D, G, S are subsets of the 900 residents, and candy hearts is universal. The total number of residents is 900. Let&#39;s consider the number of residents owning exactly one of the three items D, G, S. Let a = number of residents owning exactly one of D, G, S. Then: a + 437 + 234 + x = 900 (since these are disjoint categories: exactly one, exactly two, exactly three, exactly four). So, a = 900 - 437 - 234 - x = 229 - x. Now, sum of the sizes of D, G, S is 195 + 367 + 562 = 1124. But this counts residents multiple times if they own more than one item. The total number of items owned by residents is: sum over all residents of number of items they own (among D, G, S). This sum is: 1 * a + 2 * 437 + 3 * 234 + 4 * x = a + 874 + 702 + 4x = (229 - x) + 874 + 702 + 4x = 1805 + 3x. But this sum must equal 1124 (sum of sizes of D, G, S). So: 1805 + 3x = 1124 =&gt; 3x = 1124 - 1805 = -681 =&gt; x = -227. This is impossible (negative number). So, the assumption that candy hearts is universal and counts as an item in the &#39;exactly two&#39; and &#39;exactly three&#39; counts is incorrect. Instead, the problem states: Among the 900 residents, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own golf clubs, 562 who own a garden spade, and all own candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 who own exactly three of these things. The &#39;these things&#39; include candy hearts. So, the four items are diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, candy hearts. Since all own candy hearts, everyone owns at least one item. The number of residents owning exactly one item is: number of residents owning only candy hearts (since everyone owns candy hearts), plus those owning exactly one of the other three items but not candy hearts (which is impossible since candy hearts is universal). So, the only way to own exactly one item is to own only candy hearts. Let: x1 = number of residents owning exactly one item (only candy hearts) x2 = number owning exactly two items x3 = number owning exactly three items x4 = number owning all four items We know: x2 = 437, x3 = 234, total residents = 900, so x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 = 900 =&gt; x1 + 437 + 234 + x4 = 900 =&gt; x1 + x4 = 229. Now, sum of sizes of sets: |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| = 195 + 367 + 562 + 900 = 2024. The total number of items owned by all residents is: 1*x1 + 2*x2 + 3*x3 + 4*x4 = x1 + 2*437 + 3*234 + 4*x4 = x1 + 874 + 702 + 4*x4 = x1 + 1576 + 4*x4. But this sum must equal 2024. So: x1 + 1576 + 4*x4 = 2024 =&gt; x1 + 4*x4 = 448. From earlier, x1 + x4 = 229. Subtracting these two equations: (x1 + 4*x4) - (x1 + x4) = 448 - 229 =&gt; 3*x4 = 219 =&gt; x4 = 73. So, the number of residents owning all four items is 73.
