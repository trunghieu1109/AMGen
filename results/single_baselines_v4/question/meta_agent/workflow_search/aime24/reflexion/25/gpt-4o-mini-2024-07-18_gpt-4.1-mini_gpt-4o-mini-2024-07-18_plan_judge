proposed answer: The hexagon ABCDEF is equilateral with all pairs of opposite sides parallel. This means the hexagon is a parallelogon with side length s. The directions of sides AB, CD, and EF are separated by 120 degrees. The triangle formed by the extensions of sides AB, CD, and EF is formed by the three lines containing these sides. The side lengths of this triangle are the distances between these lines. Since the hexagon is equilateral and opposite sides are parallel, the distances between these lines are proportional to s divided by the sine of the angle between the directions of the sides. The three directions differ by 120 degrees, so the distances between the lines are proportional to s / sin(120°) = s / (√3/2) = 2s/√3. The triangle formed by the three lines has side lengths 200, 240, and 300, which correspond to these distances. Let the distances between the pairs of lines be d1=200, d2=240, d3=300. These distances correspond to the distances between pairs of parallel lines, which are equal to s times the sine of the angle between the sides. Since the directions differ by 120°, the distance between two lines parallel to directions separated by 120° is s * sin(60°) = s * (√3/2). But the problem states the triangle formed by the three lines has side lengths 200, 240, and 300, which are the distances between the lines. The key is that the triangle formed by the three lines has side lengths equal to the distances between the lines, which are proportional to s. The ratio of the sides of the triangle is 200:240:300 = 5:6:7.5 = 2:2.4:3. The triangle with sides 200, 240, and 300 is a scaled version of a triangle with sides 5, 6, and 7.5. The triangle formed by the three lines is the triangle of distances between the three directions. The side length s of the hexagon is related to these distances by s = 2 * Area of the triangle / (sum of the distances). Using Heron's formula, the area of the triangle with sides 200, 240, and 300 is sqrt(p(p-200)(p-240)(p-300)) where p=370. Calculating the area gives approximately 23932.5. Then s = (2 * 23932.5) / 740 ≈ 64.7. The side length of the hexagon is therefore 65.
