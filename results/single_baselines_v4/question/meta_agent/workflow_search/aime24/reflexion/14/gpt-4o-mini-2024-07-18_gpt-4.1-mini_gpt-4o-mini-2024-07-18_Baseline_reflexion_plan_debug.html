    <pre>Given the hyperbola \( \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \), points \(A, B, C, D\) lie on it and form a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin. The diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at the origin, so if the diagonals are \(AC\) and \(BD\), then \(A = -C\) and \(B = -D\). Let \(B = (x,y)\), then \(D = (-x,-y)\). Since \(B\) and \(D\) lie on the hyperbola, \( \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \). The other diagonal \(AC\) is along the vector \(2A\), and since \(A = -C\), \(A\) also lies on the hyperbola. Let \(A = (u,v)\), then \( \frac{u^2}{20} - \frac{v^2}{24} = 1 \). The rhombus condition means all sides are equal. The side length squared is \(AB^2 = (x-u)^2 + (y-v)^2\). The diagonals are \(AC = 2A = (2u, 2v)\) and \(BD = 2B = (2x, 2y)\). The diagonals are perpendicular in a rhombus if and only if \(AC \cdot BD = 0\), so \( (2u)(2x) + (2v)(2y) = 4(ux + vy) = 0 \Rightarrow ux + vy = 0 \). We want to find the greatest real number less than \(BD^2 = (2x)^2 + (2y)^2 = 4(x^2 + y^2)\) for all such rhombi. Using the hyperbola equations and the perpendicularity condition, we can parametrize \(A\) and \(B\) and find the maximum possible \(BD^2\). Let \(A = (\sqrt{20} \cosh t, \sqrt{24} \sinh t)\) and \(B = (\sqrt{20} \cosh s, \sqrt{24} \sinh s)\). The perpendicularity condition \(ux + vy = 0\) becomes \(\sqrt{20} \cosh t \cdot \sqrt{20} \cosh s + \sqrt{24} \sinh t \cdot \sqrt{24} \sinh s = 20 \cosh t \cosh s + 24 \sinh t \sinh s = 0\). Using hyperbolic identities, \(20 \cosh t \cosh s + 24 \sinh t \sinh s = 0\). Rewrite as \(20 \cosh t \cosh s = -24 \sinh t \sinh s\). Divide both sides by \(\cosh t \cosh s\) (nonzero), \(20 = -24 \tanh t \tanh s\), so \(\tanh t \tanh s = -\frac{20}{24} = -\frac{5}{6}\). We want to maximize \(BD^2 = 4(x^2 + y^2) = 4(20 \cosh^2 s + 24 \sinh^2 s) = 4(20 \cosh^2 s + 24 \sinh^2 s)\). Using \(\cosh^2 s - \sinh^2 s = 1\), \(x^2 + y^2 = 20 \cosh^2 s + 24 \sinh^2 s = 20 + 4 \sinh^2 s\). So \(BD^2 = 4(20 + 4 \sinh^2 s) = 80 + 16 \sinh^2 s\). We want to maximize \(\sinh^2 s\) subject to \(\tanh t \tanh s = -\frac{5}{6}\). Let \(a = \tanh t\), \(b = \tanh s\), so \(ab = -\frac{5}{6}\). Since \(|\tanh x| &lt; 1\), \(a, b \in (-1,1)\). We want to maximize \(\sinh^2 s = \frac{b^2}{1 - b^2}\). For fixed product \(ab = -5/6\), maximize \(\frac{b^2}{1 - b^2}\). Since \(a = -\frac{5}{6b}\), and \(|a| &lt; 1\), \(|-\frac{5}{6b}| &lt; 1 \Rightarrow |b| &gt; \frac{5}{6}\). So \(b^2 &gt; \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^2 = \frac{25}{36}\). As \(b^2 \to 1\), \(\frac{b^2}{1 - b^2} \to \infty\). But \(|b| &lt; 1\), so \(b^2 &lt; 1\). The maximum is approached as \(b^2 \to 1\) from below. The maximum \(BD^2\) is unbounded, but the problem asks for the greatest real number less than \(BD^2\) for all such rhombi, so the supremum is infinite, but the greatest real number less than \(BD^2\) for all rhombi is the limit as \(b^2 \to 1\) from below. Since \(b^2 &lt; 1\), \(BD^2\) can be arbitrarily large. However, the problem likely expects the supremum of \(BD^2\) for all such rhombi, which is infinite. But since the problem asks for the greatest real number less than \(BD^2\) for all such rhombi, it means the infimum of the upper bounds, which is infinite, so no finite number exists. Alternatively, if we consider the minimal value of \(BD^2\), we can find it by minimizing \(BD^2 = 80 + 16 \sinh^2 s\) with the constraint \(ab = -5/6\). The minimal \(BD^2\) occurs when \(b^2\) is minimal, i.e., \(b^2 = (5/6)^2 = 25/36\), then \(BD^2 = 80 + 16 \cdot \frac{25/36}{1 - 25/36} = 80 + 16 \cdot \frac{25/36}{11/36} = 80 + 16 \cdot \frac{25}{11} = 80 + \frac{400}{11} = \frac{880}{11} + \frac{400}{11} = \frac{1280}{11} \approx 116.36\). So the minimal \(BD^2\) is \(\frac{1280}{11}\). Since the problem asks for the greatest real number less than \(BD^2\) for all such rhombi, it means the minimal possible \(BD^2\) value. Therefore, the answer is the floor of \(\frac{1280}{11}\), which is 116.
