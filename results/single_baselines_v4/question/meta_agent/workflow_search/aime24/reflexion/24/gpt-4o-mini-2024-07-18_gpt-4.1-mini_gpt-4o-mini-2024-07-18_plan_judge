Question: Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations:
\[\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}\]\[\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}\]\[\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}\]
Then the value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: Given the system:
log2(x/(yz)) = 1/2
log2(y/(xz)) = 1/3
log2(z/(xy)) = 1/4

Rewrite each equation using properties of logarithms:
log2(x) - log2(y) - log2(z) = 1/2
log2(y) - log2(x) - log2(z) = 1/3
log2(z) - log2(x) - log2(y) = 1/4

Let a = log2(x), b = log2(y), c = log2(z).
Then the system becomes:
a - b - c = 1/2
b - a - c = 1/3
c - a - b = 1/4

Add all three equations:
(a - b - c) + (b - a - c) + (c - a - b) = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4
Left side simplifies:
a - b - c + b - a - c + c - a - b = (-a) + (-b) + (-c) = -(a + b + c)
Right side:
1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 = (6/12 + 4/12 + 3/12) = 13/12

So, -(a + b + c) = 13/12 => a + b + c = -13/12

We want to find |log2(x^4 y^3 z^2)| = |4a + 3b + 2c|

From the system:
1) a - b - c = 1/2
2) b - a - c = 1/3
3) c - a - b = 1/4

Rewrite 1): a = b + c + 1/2
Substitute into 2): b - (b + c + 1/2) - c = 1/3 => b - b - c - 1/2 - c = 1/3 => -2c - 1/2 = 1/3
=> -2c = 1/3 + 1/2 = (2/6 + 3/6) = 5/6 => c = -5/12

From 3): c - a - b = 1/4
Substitute a = b + c + 1/2:
 c - (b + c + 1/2) - b = 1/4
 c - b - c - 1/2 - b = 1/4
 -2b - 1/2 = 1/4
 -2b = 1/4 + 1/2 = 1/4 + 2/4 = 3/4
 b = -3/8

From a = b + c + 1/2:
 a = -3/8 - 5/12 + 1/2
 Find common denominator 24:
 -3/8 = -9/24
 -5/12 = -10/24
 1/2 = 12/24
 a = (-9/24) + (-10/24) + (12/24) = (-19/24) + (12/24) = -7/24

Check sum a + b + c:
 -7/24 - 3/8 - 5/12
 Convert to 24ths:
 -7/24 - 9/24 - 10/24 = -26/24 = -13/12 correct.

Now compute 4a + 3b + 2c:
4*(-7/24) + 3*(-3/8) + 2*(-5/12)
= -28/24 - 9/8 - 10/12
Convert all to 24ths:
-28/24 - (9/8)*(3/3) = -28/24 - 27/24 - (10/12)*(2/2) = -28/24 - 27/24 - 20/24 = (-28 - 27 - 20)/24 = -75/24
Simplify -75/24 = -25/8

Absolute value is 25/8.

m = 25, n = 8, so m + n = 33.
