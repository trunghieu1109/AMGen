    <pre>Let&#39;s analyze the problem step by step.

1. The list consists of positive integers.
2. The sum of the items in the list is 30.
3. The unique mode of the list is 9, meaning 9 appears more times than any other number.
4. The median is a positive integer that does not appear in the list.

Since the median is a positive integer not in the list, the list must have an even number of elements (because for an odd number of elements, the median is the middle element, which must be in the list). For an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle elements after sorting.

Let the list have 2n elements. The median is the average of the n-th and (n+1)-th elements.

Since the median is an integer not in the list, the two middle elements must be consecutive integers (e.g., 4 and 5), so their average is a non-listed integer (e.g., 4.5). But the problem states the median is a positive integer, so the average of the two middle elements must be an integer not in the list.

This means the two middle elements are consecutive integers, say m and m+2, so their average is m+1, which is the median and not in the list.

So the two middle elements are m and m+2, median = m+1 (not in the list).

We also know 9 is the unique mode, so 9 appears more times than any other number.

Let&#39;s try to find such a list.

Try to find a list with 6 elements (even number):

Let the sorted list be: a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6
Median = (a3 + a4)/2 = integer not in list
So a4 = a3 + 2
Median = a3 + 1

We want 9 to be the unique mode.

Try a3 = 8, a4 = 10, median = 9 (not in list)

So the list looks like: a1, a2, 8, 10, a5, a6

9 is not in the list, but 9 is the mode? No, 9 is not in the list, so it can&#39;t be the mode.

Try a3 = 7, a4 = 9, median = 8 (not in list)

List: a1, a2, 7, 9, a5, a6
9 is in the list, good.

9 must be the unique mode, so 9 appears more times than any other number.

Try to have two 9s.

Try list: 3, 7, 7, 9, 9, 5
Sorted: 3, 5, 7, 7, 9, 9
Median = (7 + 7)/2 = 7 (in list), no.

Try list: 3, 7, 8, 9, 9, 4
Sorted: 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 9
Median = (7 + 8)/2 = 7.5 (not integer), no.

Try list: 2, 7, 7, 9, 9, 5
Sorted: 2, 5, 7, 7, 9, 9
Median = (7 + 7)/2 = 7 (in list), no.

Try list: 1, 7, 8, 9, 9, 5
Sorted: 1, 5, 7, 8, 9, 9
Median = (7 + 8)/2 = 7.5 (not integer), no.

Try list with 4 elements:
Median = (a2 + a3)/2 = integer not in list
So a3 = a2 + 2
Median = a2 + 1

Try a2 = 8, a3 = 10, median = 9 (not in list)
List: a1, 8, 10, a4
Sum = 30
Try to have 9 as mode, so 9 must appear more times than any other number.
But 9 is not in the list, so no.

Try a2 = 7, a3 = 9, median = 8 (not in list)
List: a1, 7, 9, a4
Sum = 30
9 must be mode, so 9 appears more times than any other number.
Try 9 twice.
Try list: 3, 7, 9, 11
Sum = 30
Median = (7 + 9)/2 = 8 (not in list)
9 appears once, no mode.

Try list: 3, 7, 9, 9
Sum = 28
Try list: 4, 7, 9, 9
Sum = 29
Try list: 5, 7, 9, 9
Sum = 30
Sorted: 5, 7, 9, 9
Median = (7 + 9)/2 = 8 (not in list)
Mode is 9 (appears twice), others appear once.
Sum is 30.
All conditions met.

Now find sum of squares:
5^2 + 7^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 = 25 + 49 + 81 + 81 = 236

Answer: 236
