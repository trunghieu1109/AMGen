Question: Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.

proposed answer: We are considering paths on an 8x8 grid from the lower left corner to the upper right corner. Each path consists of 16 steps: 8 steps to the right (R) and 8 steps up (U). We want to count the number of such paths that change direction exactly 4 times. A change of direction means switching from R to U or from U to R. Since the path has 16 steps, and exactly 4 changes of direction, the path can be divided into 5 segments (because the number of segments is one more than the number of changes). Each segment consists of consecutive steps in the same direction. The directions alternate between R and U. The first segment can be either R or U. 

Let's denote the lengths of these 5 segments as a1, a2, a3, a4, a5. Since the directions alternate, if the first segment is R, then the odd segments are R and the even segments are U. If the first segment is U, then the odd segments are U and the even segments are R.

We know:
- The total number of R steps is 8.
- The total number of U steps is 8.

Case 1: First segment is R
Then a1 + a3 + a5 = 8 (sum of R segments)
a2 + a4 = 8 (sum of U segments)
All a_i are positive integers (since each segment must have at least one step).

Case 2: First segment is U
Then a1 + a3 + a5 = 8 (sum of U segments)
a2 + a4 = 8 (sum of R segments)
All a_i are positive integers.

We need to count the number of positive integer solutions to these equations.

For Case 1:
Number of positive integer solutions to a1 + a3 + a5 = 8 is C(8-1, 3-1) = C(7,2) = 21
Number of positive integer solutions to a2 + a4 = 8 is C(8-1, 2-1) = C(7,1) = 7
Total for Case 1 = 21 * 7 = 147

For Case 2:
Number of positive integer solutions to a1 + a3 + a5 = 8 is 21 (same reasoning)
Number of positive integer solutions to a2 + a4 = 8 is 7
Total for Case 2 = 21 * 7 = 147

Total number of paths with exactly 4 changes of direction = 147 + 147 = 294.
