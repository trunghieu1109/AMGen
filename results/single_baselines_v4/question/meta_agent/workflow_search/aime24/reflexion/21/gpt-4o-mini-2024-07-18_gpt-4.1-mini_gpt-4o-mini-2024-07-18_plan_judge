proposed answer: We are given a regular dodecagon (12-gon) and need to find the number of rectangles formed such that each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The vertices of the dodecagon are equally spaced on a circle, and the sides and diagonals are chords connecting these vertices.

Key observations:
1. A rectangle inscribed in a circle is a cyclic quadrilateral with right angles.
2. In a regular polygon, rectangles formed by vertices correspond to pairs of chords that are perpendicular.
3. Since the polygon is regular, the vertices lie on a circle, and any rectangle inscribed must have its vertices among these points.

Step 1: Understand the structure of the dodecagon
- The dodecagon has 12 vertices, labeled 0 through 11.
- The vertices are equally spaced at 30 degrees apart on the circle.

Step 2: Conditions for rectangles
- A rectangle inscribed in a circle has opposite vertices that are endpoints of diameters (since the rectangle's diagonals are equal and bisect each other).
- For a rectangle inscribed in a circle, the vertices must be four points such that the quadrilateral has right angles.

Step 3: Identify rectangles formed by vertices of the dodecagon
- Since the polygon is regular, the vertices are at angles 0°, 30°, 60°, ..., 330°.
- The rectangle's vertices must be four points such that the quadrilateral is a rectangle.
- The diagonals of the rectangle are diameters of the circle, so the vertices of the rectangle are pairs of points opposite each other on the circle.

Step 4: Find pairs of opposite vertices
- Opposite vertices are separated by 180°.
- Since the vertices are 30° apart, opposite vertices are 6 apart in numbering (e.g., 0 and 6, 1 and 7, ..., 5 and 11).
- There are 6 pairs of opposite vertices.

Step 5: Construct rectangles
- A rectangle is determined by two pairs of opposite vertices.
- Each rectangle corresponds to choosing two distinct pairs of opposite vertices.
- Number of ways to choose 2 pairs out of 6 is C(6, 2) = 15.

Step 6: Verify that these rectangles have sides along sides or diagonals
- The sides of the rectangle are chords connecting these vertices.
- Since the vertices are from the polygon, the sides are either sides or diagonals of the polygon.

Therefore, the number of rectangles formed is 15.
