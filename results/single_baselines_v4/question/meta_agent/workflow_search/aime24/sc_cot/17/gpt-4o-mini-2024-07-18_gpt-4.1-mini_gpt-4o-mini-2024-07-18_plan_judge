proposed answer: We are given the equation a + b + c = 300, where a, b, c are nonnegative integers, and the condition a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000. First, notice the symmetry in the expression: a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = a^2(b+c) + b^2(a+c) + c^2(a+b). Since a + b + c = 300, we can write b + c = 300 - a, a + c = 300 - b, and a + b = 300 - c. Substitute these to get: a^2(300 - a) + b^2(300 - b) + c^2(300 - c) = 6,000,000. Expand: 300(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) - (a^3 + b^3 + c^3) = 6,000,000. We want to find all nonnegative integer triples (a,b,c) with a + b + c = 300 satisfying this. Also, recall the identity: a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc = (a + b + c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - bc - ca). Since a + b + c = 300, we can write a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 3abc + 300(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - bc - ca). Substitute into the equation: 300(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) - [3abc + 300(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - bc - ca)] = 6,000,000. Simplify: 300(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) - 3abc - 300(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) + 300(ab + bc + ca) = 6,000,000. The 300(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) terms cancel out, leaving: 300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000. Divide both sides by 3: 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000. We have the system: a + b + c = 300, 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000. Let S1 = a + b + c = 300, S2 = ab + bc + ca, and S3 = abc. Then 100 S2 - S3 = 2,000,000. We want to find all nonnegative integer triples (a,b,c) with sum 300 satisfying this. Since the problem is symmetric, consider the case when two variables are equal to reduce complexity. Let b = c = x, then a = 300 - 2x. Then S2 = a*b + b*c + c*a = a*x + x*x + x*a = a*x + x^2 + a*x = 2 a x + x^2. S3 = a * b * c = a * x * x = a x^2. Substitute into the equation: 100 S2 - S3 = 100(2 a x + x^2) - a x^2 = 200 a x + 100 x^2 - a x^2 = a (200 x - x^2) + 100 x^2 = 2,000,000. Recall a = 300 - 2 x: (300 - 2 x)(200 x - x^2) + 100 x^2 = 2,000,000. Expand: (300)(200 x - x^2) - 2 x (200 x - x^2) + 100 x^2 = 2,000,000. 300 * 200 x = 60,000 x, 300 * (-x^2) = -300 x^2, -2 x * 200 x = -400 x^2, -2 x * (-x^2) = +2 x^3, so the expression is 60,000 x - 300 x^2 - 400 x^2 + 2 x^3 + 100 x^2 = 2,000,000. Combine terms: 60,000 x + 2 x^3 - (300 + 400 - 100) x^2 = 2,000,000. That is 60,000 x + 2 x^3 - 600 x^2 = 2,000,000. Rearrange: 2 x^3 - 600 x^2 + 60,000 x - 2,000,000 = 0. Divide by 2: x^3 - 300 x^2 + 30,000 x - 1,000,000 = 0. We want integer solutions 0 <= x <= 150 (since a = 300 - 2x >= 0). Try to find integer roots by Rational Root Theorem. Possible roots divide 1,000,000, but large. Try some values: x=10: 1000 - 300*100 + 300,000 - 1,000,000 = 1000 - 30,000 + 300,000 - 1,000,000 = -729,000 (too small). x=20: 8000 - 300*400 + 600,000 - 1,000,000 = 8000 - 120,000 + 600,000 - 1,000,000 = -512,000. x=50: 125,000 - 300*2500 + 1,500,000 - 1,000,000 = 125,000 - 750,000 + 1,500,000 - 1,000,000 = -125,000. x=100: 1,000,000 - 300*10,000 + 3,000,000 - 1,000,000 = 1,000,000 - 3,000,000 + 3,000,000 - 1,000,000 = 0. So x=100 is a root. Divide polynomial by (x - 100): The quotient is x^2 - 200 x + 10,000. Solve x^2 - 200 x + 10,000 = 0. Discriminant = 200^2 - 4*10,000 = 40,000 - 40,000 = 0, so double root x=100. So x=100 is a triple root. So x=100 is the only root. Then a = 300 - 2*100 = 100, so (a,b,c) = (100,100,100). Check the original condition: 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 100(100*100 + 100*100 + 100*100) - 100*100*100 = 100(10,000 + 10,000 + 10,000) - 1,000,000 = 100*30,000 - 1,000,000 = 3,000,000 - 1,000,000 = 2,000,000, which matches. So (100,100,100) is a solution. Due to symmetry, permutations of (100,100,100) are the same triple. Are there other solutions? For other cases, check when two variables are zero: a + b + c = 300, if c=0, then a + b = 300. Then the expression becomes a^2 b + a^2 * 0 + b^2 a + b^2 * 0 + 0 + 0 = a^2 b + b^2 a = a b (a + b) = a b * 300. The condition is a b * 300 = 6,000,000 => a b = 20,000. Since a + b = 300, find integer pairs (a,b) with ab=20,000 and a+b=300. The quadratic equation is x(300 - x) = 20,000 => 300 x - x^2 = 20,000 => x^2 - 300 x + 20,000 = 0. Discriminant = 300^2 - 4*20,000 = 90,000 - 80,000 = 10,000. sqrt(10,000) = 100. Roots are (300 Â± 100)/2 = 200 or 100. So pairs are (100,200) and (200,100). So (100,200,0), (200,100,0), and permutations with zero in other places are solutions. Similarly, check if one variable is zero: total number of such solutions is 6 (since zero can be in any of the three positions, and the other two numbers are (100,200) or (200,100)). So 6 solutions here. Next, check if one variable is zero and the other two are equal: c=0, a=b=x, a + b = 300 => 2x=300 => x=150. Then the expression becomes a^2 b + a^2 c + b^2 a + b^2 c + c^2 a + c^2 b = a^2 b + b^2 a = x^2 * x + x^2 * x = 2 x^3 = 2 * 150^3 = 2 * 3,375,000 = 6,750,000 > 6,000,000, so no. So no solution here. Finally, check if all variables are distinct but none zero. Given the cubic equation and the symmetry, the only solution is (100,100,100) and the ones with one zero coordinate and the other two numbers (100,200) or (200,100). Total solutions: (100,100,100) counts as 1. The solutions with zero: (100,200,0) and permutations. There are 3 positions for zero, and for each zero position, two permutations: (100,200) and (200,100), so total 3 * 2 = 6. So total number of solutions is 1 + 6 = 7.
