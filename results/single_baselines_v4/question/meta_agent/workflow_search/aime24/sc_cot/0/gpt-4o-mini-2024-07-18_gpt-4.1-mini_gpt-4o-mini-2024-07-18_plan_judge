Question: Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.

proposed answer: Let s be Aya's walking speed in km/h, and t be the time spent in the coffee shop in minutes.

Given:
- Distance = 9 km
- Walking speed = s km/h, total time = 4 hours = 240 minutes (including t minutes in the coffee shop)
- Walking speed = s + 2 km/h, total time = 2 hours 24 minutes = 144 minutes (including t minutes in the coffee shop)

First, express the walking times (excluding coffee time):
- Time walking at speed s = 9 / s hours
- Time walking at speed s + 2 = 9 / (s + 2) hours

Convert walking times to minutes:
- Walking time at s = (9 / s) * 60 minutes
- Walking time at s + 2 = (9 / (s + 2)) * 60 minutes

From the problem:
- Total time at speed s = walking time + t = 240 minutes
- Total time at speed s + 2 = walking time + t = 144 minutes

Set up equations:
(9 / s) * 60 + t = 240
(9 / (s + 2)) * 60 + t = 144

Subtract second equation from the first:
(9 / s) * 60 - (9 / (s + 2)) * 60 = 240 - 144
60 * (9 / s - 9 / (s + 2)) = 96
Divide both sides by 60:
9 / s - 9 / (s + 2) = 96 / 60 = 8 / 5

Simplify the left side:
9(1 / s - 1 / (s + 2)) = 8 / 5
9((s + 2 - s) / (s(s + 2))) = 8 / 5
9(2 / (s^2 + 2s)) = 8 / 5
18 / (s^2 + 2s) = 8 / 5

Cross multiply:
18 * 5 = 8 * (s^2 + 2s)
90 = 8s^2 + 16s

Bring all terms to one side:
8s^2 + 16s - 90 = 0
Divide by 2:
4s^2 + 8s - 45 = 0

Use quadratic formula:
s = [-8 ± sqrt(8^2 - 4*4*(-45))] / (2*4)
= [-8 ± sqrt(64 + 720)] / 8
= [-8 ± sqrt(784)] / 8
= [-8 ± 28] / 8

Two solutions:
s = (20) / 8 = 2.5 or s = (-36) / 8 = -4.5 (discard negative speed)

So s = 2.5 km/h

Find t using first equation:
(9 / s) * 60 + t = 240
(9 / 2.5) * 60 + t = 240
(3.6) * 60 + t = 240
216 + t = 240
 t = 24 minutes

Now find total time when speed is s + 0.5 = 3 km/h:
Walking time = (9 / 3) * 60 = 3 * 60 = 180 minutes
Total time = walking time + t = 180 + 24 = 204 minutes

Convert 204 minutes to minutes (the problem asks for minutes, so 204 minutes is the final answer).
