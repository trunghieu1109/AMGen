    <pre>We have an 8x8 grid, and we want to move from the lower left corner to the upper right corner. Each path consists of 16 steps: 8 steps to the right (R) and 8 steps up (U). The total number of such paths without restriction is C(16,8). We want to count the number of paths that change direction exactly 4 times. A change of direction means switching from R to U or from U to R. With exactly 4 changes, the path can be divided into 5 segments (since changes + 1 = number of segments). Each segment consists of steps all in the same direction. The segments alternate between R and U. Since the total number of R steps is 8 and total number of U steps is 8, the sum of the lengths of R segments is 8, and sum of lengths of U segments is 8. The path can start either with R or U. So there are two cases: 1) Start with R: segments are R U R U R (5 segments, odd segments are R, even are U). 2) Start with U: segments are U R U R U. We need to count the number of ways to partition 8 into 3 positive parts (for the 3 segments of the direction that appears 3 times) and 8 into 2 positive parts (for the 2 segments of the direction that appears 2 times). For example, in case 1, R segments are 3 in number, sum to 8, each &gt; 0; U segments are 2 in number, sum to 8, each &gt; 0. The number of positive integer solutions to x1 + x2 + ... + xk = n is C(n-1, k-1). So for 3 positive parts summing to 8, number of solutions is C(7,2) = 21. For 2 positive parts summing to 8, number of solutions is C(7,1) = 7. So for case 1, number of ways = 21 * 7 = 147. For case 2, the roles reverse: U segments are 3, R segments are 2. So again, number of ways = 21 * 7 = 147. Total number of paths with exactly 4 changes = 147 + 147 = 294.
