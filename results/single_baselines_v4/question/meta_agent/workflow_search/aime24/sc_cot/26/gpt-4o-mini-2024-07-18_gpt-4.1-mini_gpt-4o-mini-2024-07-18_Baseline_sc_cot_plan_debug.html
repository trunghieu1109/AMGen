    <pre>Let A be the set of positive integers chosen by Alice. Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers such that the maximum element of B is in A. We want to find the sum of the elements of A given that the total number of such sets is 2024.

Step 1: Understand the problem.
- Each set B is a finite nonempty set of positive integers.
- The maximum element of B must be in A.
- Bob lists all such sets.
- The total number of these sets is 2024.

Step 2: Express the number of sets B with max(B) = a for some a in A.
- Fix a positive integer a.
- Consider all finite nonempty sets B with max(B) = a.
- Such a set B must include the element a.
- The other elements of B can be any subset of {1, 2, ..., a-1} (including the empty subset).
- The number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., a-1} is 2^(a-1).
- Since B must include a, each subset of {1,...,a-1} corresponds to exactly one set B with max(B) = a.
- Therefore, the number of sets B with max(B) = a is 2^(a-1).

Step 3: Total number of sets B for all a in A.
- Since the sets B are counted by max(B), and max(B) is in A, the sets for different max(B) are disjoint.
- The total number of sets B is sum_{a in A} 2^(a-1).

Step 4: Use the given total number of sets.
- sum_{a in A} 2^(a-1) = 2024.

Step 5: Find A.
- We want to find a set of positive integers A such that sum of 2^(a-1) over a in A equals 2024.
- Note that 2^(a-1) are powers of two: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ...
- So 2024 is expressed as a sum of distinct powers of two.

Step 6: Express 2024 in binary to find the powers of two.
- Let&#39;s find the binary representation of 2024.
- 2024 / 2 = 1012 remainder 0
- 1012 / 2 = 506 remainder 0
- 506 / 2 = 253 remainder 0
- 253 / 2 = 126 remainder 1
- 126 / 2 = 63 remainder 0
- 63 / 2 = 31 remainder 1
- 31 / 2 = 15 remainder 1
- 15 / 2 = 7 remainder 1
- 7 / 2 = 3 remainder 1
- 3 / 2 = 1 remainder 1
- 1 / 2 = 0 remainder 1

So the binary digits from least significant bit to most significant bit are:
0 (2^0), 0 (2^1), 0 (2^2), 1 (2^3), 0 (2^4), 1 (2^5), 1 (2^6), 1 (2^7), 1 (2^8), 1 (2^9)

Written properly:
2024 = (1)*2^9 + (1)*2^8 + (1)*2^7 + (1)*2^6 + (1)*2^5 + (0)*2^4 + (1)*2^3 + (0)*2^2 + (0)*2^1 + (0)*2^0

Let&#39;s verify the sum:
2^9 = 512
2^8 = 256
2^7 = 128
2^6 = 64
2^5 = 32
2^3 = 8
Sum = 512 + 256 + 128 + 64 + 32 + 8 = 1000

This is incorrect; the sum is too small. Let&#39;s check the division again carefully.

Divide 2024 by 2:
2024 / 2 = 1012 remainder 0
1012 / 2 = 506 remainder 0
506 / 2 = 253 remainder 0
253 / 2 = 126 remainder 1
126 / 2 = 63 remainder 0
63 / 2 = 31 remainder 1
31 / 2 = 15 remainder 1
15 / 2 = 7 remainder 1
7 / 2 = 3 remainder 1
3 / 2 = 1 remainder 1
1 / 2 = 0 remainder 1

So the bits from least significant to most significant:
bit0 = 0
bit1 = 0
bit2 = 0
bit3 = 1
bit4 = 0
bit5 = 1
bit6 = 1
bit7 = 1
bit8 = 1
bit9 = 1

So the binary number is 1111101000 (bits 9 down to 0).

Now, calculate the sum of powers of two:
bit9 = 1 =&gt; 2^9 = 512
bit8 = 1 =&gt; 2^8 = 256
bit7 = 1 =&gt; 2^7 = 128
bit6 = 1 =&gt; 2^6 = 64
bit5 = 1 =&gt; 2^5 = 32
bit4 = 0 =&gt; 0
bit3 = 1 =&gt; 2^3 = 8
bit2 = 0 =&gt; 0
bit1 = 0 =&gt; 0
bit0 = 0 =&gt; 0

Sum = 512 + 256 + 128 + 64 + 32 + 8 = 1000

This is 1000, not 2024. So the binary representation above is incorrect.

Try another approach: 2024 in decimal.
Let&#39;s subtract the largest power of two less than or equal to 2024.
2^10 = 1024
2^11 = 2048 &gt; 2024
So start with 2^10 = 1024
2024 - 1024 = 1000
Next largest power of two &lt;= 1000 is 512 (2^9)
1000 - 512 = 488
Next largest &lt;= 488 is 256 (2^8)
488 - 256 = 232
Next largest &lt;= 232 is 128 (2^7)
232 - 128 = 104
Next largest &lt;= 104 is 64 (2^6)
104 - 64 = 40
Next largest &lt;= 40 is 32 (2^5)
40 - 32 = 8
Next largest &lt;= 8 is 8 (2^3)
8 - 8 = 0

So 2024 = 1024 + 512 + 256 + 128 + 64 + 32 + 8

Corresponding exponents: 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 3

Step 7: Recall that sum_{a in A} 2^(a-1) = 2024
This means that the exponents (a-1) correspond to the powers of two we found.
So the set of exponents is {10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 3}

Thus, a - 1 âˆˆ {3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}
So A = {4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11}

Step 8: Find the sum of elements of A
Sum = 4 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11
Calculate sum:
4 + 6 = 10
10 + 7 = 17
17 + 8 = 25
25 + 9 = 34
34 + 10 = 44
44 + 11 = 55
