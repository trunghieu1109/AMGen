proposed answer: We are given a 13th root of unity \( \omega \neq 1 \), so \( \omega^{13} = 1 \) and \( \omega^k \) for \( k=0,1,\ldots,12 \) are the 13th roots of unity. We want to find the remainder when
\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})
\]
is divided by 1000.

Step 1: Simplify the expression inside the product.

Note that
\[
2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k} = (\omega^k)^2 - 2\omega^k + 2 = (\omega^k)^2 - 2\omega^k + 1 + 1 = (\omega^k - 1)^2 + 1.
\]

So the product becomes
\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12} ((\omega^k - 1)^2 + 1).
\]

Step 2: Let \( z = \omega^k \). The 13th roots of unity satisfy \( z^{13} = 1 \). The polynomial whose roots are the 13th roots of unity is \( z^{13} - 1 = 0 \).

Step 3: Define the polynomial
\[
Q(x) = (x - 1)^2 + 1 = x^2 - 2x + 2.
\]

We want
\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12} Q(\omega^k) = \prod_{k=0}^{12} (\omega^{2k} - 2\omega^k + 2).
\]

Step 4: The product is over all the 13th roots of unity \( \omega^k \), including \( \omega^0 = 1 \).

Step 5: Consider the polynomial
\[
P(x) = x^{13} - 1.
\]

The roots of \( P(x) \) are \( \omega^k \) for \( k=0,1,\ldots,12 \).

Step 6: Since the roots are \( r_k = \omega^k \), the product of \( Q(r_k) \) is equal to the resultant of \( P(x) \) and \( Q(x) \), up to a factor related to the leading coefficients:

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12} Q(r_k) = \text{Res}(P,Q).
\]

Step 7: The resultant of two polynomials \( P(x) \) and \( Q(x) \) can be computed by
\[
\text{Res}(P,Q) = a^{\deg P} \prod_{Q(s)=0} P(s) = b^{\deg Q} \prod_{P(r)=0} Q(r),
\]
where \( a \) and \( b \) are the leading coefficients of \( P \) and \( Q \) respectively.

Here, \( P(x) = x^{13} - 1 \) with leading coefficient \( a = 1 \), degree 13.

And \( Q(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2 \) with leading coefficient \( b = 1 \), degree 2.

Step 8: Using
\[
\text{Res}(P,Q) = b^{13} \prod_{k=0}^{12} Q(\omega^k) = \prod_{k=0}^{12} Q(\omega^k),
\]
since \( b = 1 \).

So the desired product is exactly the resultant \( \text{Res}(P,Q) \).

Step 9: Alternatively, we can compute the resultant by evaluating
\[
\text{Res}(P,Q) = a^{2} \prod_{Q(s)=0} P(s) = \prod_{Q(s)=0} P(s).
\]

The roots of \( Q(x) = 0 \) are
\[
x = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{4 - 8}}{2} = 1 \pm i.
\]

Step 10: Evaluate \( P(x) = x^{13} - 1 \) at \( x = 1 + i \) and \( x = 1 - i \).

Step 11: Compute \( (1 + i)^{13} \).

Using polar form: \( 1 + i = \sqrt{2} e^{i \pi/4} \).

So
\[
(1 + i)^{13} = (\sqrt{2})^{13} e^{i 13 \pi / 4} = 2^{13/2} e^{i (13 \pi / 4)}.
\]

Step 12: Simplify the angle:

\[
13 \pi / 4 = 3 \pi + \pi / 4 = \pi / 4 \quad \text{(mod } 2\pi \text{)}
\]

because \( 3\pi = 12\pi/4 \), so \( 13\pi/4 - 12\pi/4 = \pi/4 \).

Step 13: So
\[
(1 + i)^{13} = 2^{6.5} e^{i \pi / 4} = 2^{6} \cdot \sqrt{2} (\cos(\pi/4) + i \sin(\pi/4)) = 64 \sqrt{2} \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) = 64 \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} (1 + i) = 64 \cdot (1 + i).
\]

Step 14: Thus,
\[
P(1 + i) = (1 + i)^{13} - 1 = 64 (1 + i) - 1 = 64 + 64 i - 1 = 63 + 64 i.
\]

Step 15: Similarly, for \( 1 - i \), its conjugate,

\[
(1 - i)^{13} = \overline{(1 + i)^{13}} = \overline{64(1 + i)} = 64(1 - i).
\]

So
\[
P(1 - i) = (1 - i)^{13} - 1 = 64(1 - i) - 1 = 63 - 64 i.
\]

Step 16: The resultant is
\[
\text{Res}(P,Q) = P(1 + i) \cdot P(1 - i) = (63 + 64 i)(63 - 64 i) = 63^2 + 64^2 = 3969 + 4096 = 8065.
\]

Step 17: The product we want is \( 8065 \).

Step 18: Finally, find the remainder when \( 8065 \) is divided by 1000:

\[
8065 \mod 1000 = 8065 - 8 \times 1000 = 8065 - 8000 = 65.
\]
