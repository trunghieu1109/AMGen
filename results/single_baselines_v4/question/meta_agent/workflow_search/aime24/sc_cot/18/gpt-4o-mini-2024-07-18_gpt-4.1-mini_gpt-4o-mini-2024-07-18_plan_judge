Question: Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). Then \(OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\).

proposed answer: We are given points O=(0,0), A=(1/2,0), and B=(0,sqrt(3)/2). The segment AB has length 1 because the distance between A and B is sqrt((1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2) = sqrt(1/4 + 3/4) = sqrt(1) = 1. The family F consists of all unit segments PQ where P is on the x-axis (P=(x,0), x>0) and Q is on the y-axis (Q=(0,y), y>0), and the length PQ=1. For any such segment, by the distance formula, we have sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = 1, so y = sqrt(1 - x^2). Thus, the segments in F are all segments from (x,0) to (0,sqrt(1-x^2)) for x in (0,1). The segment AB connects A=(1/2,0) and B=(0,sqrt(3)/2). We look for a unique point C on AB (not A or B) which does not lie on any segment from F other than AB itself. Parameterize AB: C = A + t(B - A) = (1/2,0) + t(-1/2, sqrt(3)/2) = (1/2 - t/2, t*sqrt(3)/2), for t in (0,1). We want to find t such that C does not lie on any segment in F except AB. Any segment in F is from (a,0) to (0,sqrt(1 - a^2)). For C to be on such a segment, C must be a convex combination of P and Q: C = s*P + (1-s)*Q for s in [0,1]. Writing coordinates: (x_C, y_C) = (s*a, (1-s)*sqrt(1 - a^2)). From x-coordinate: x_C = s*a => s = x_C / a. From y-coordinate: y_C = (1 - s)*sqrt(1 - a^2) => y_C = (1 - x_C/a)*sqrt(1 - a^2). Rearranged: y_C = sqrt(1 - a^2) - (x_C / a) * sqrt(1 - a^2). Multiply both sides by a: a*y_C = a*sqrt(1 - a^2) - x_C*sqrt(1 - a^2). Rearranged: x_C*sqrt(1 - a^2) + a*y_C = a*sqrt(1 - a^2). For fixed C=(x_C,y_C), define f(a) = x_C*sqrt(1 - a^2) + a*y_C - a*sqrt(1 - a^2) = 0. We want to find all a in (0,1) satisfying this. For C on AB, we want to find if there are other a values (other than the one corresponding to AB) that satisfy this. The segment AB corresponds to a=1/2, since A=(1/2,0), B=(0,sqrt(3)/2). The segment AB is from P=(1/2,0) to Q=(0,sqrt(3)/2), so a=1/2. The question is: For which t in (0,1) is there no other a in (0,1), a != 1/2, such that C lies on the segment corresponding to a? This means that for C on AB, the equation f(a)=0 has a unique solution at a=1/2. So f(a) = x_C*sqrt(1 - a^2) + a*y_C - a*sqrt(1 - a^2) = 0. Substitute x_C = 1/2 - t/2, y_C = t*sqrt(3)/2. Define g(a) = x_C*sqrt(1 - a^2) + a*y_C - a*sqrt(1 - a^2). We want g(a) = 0 to have a unique root at a=1/2. For uniqueness, g(a) = 0 and g'(a) = 0 at a=1/2. Compute g'(a): g'(a) = derivative with respect to a of g(a). g(a) = x_C*sqrt(1 - a^2) + a*y_C - a*sqrt(1 - a^2) = x_C*sqrt(1 - a^2) + a*y_C - a*sqrt(1 - a^2). Simplify: g(a) = x_C*sqrt(1 - a^2) + a*y_C - a*sqrt(1 - a^2) = (x_C - a)*sqrt(1 - a^2) + a*y_C. Compute derivative: Let h(a) = sqrt(1 - a^2), then h'(a) = -a / sqrt(1 - a^2). So, g(a) = (x_C - a)*h(a) + a*y_C. Then g'(a) = derivative of (x_C - a)*h(a) + a*y_C. = (x_C - a)*h'(a) + (-1)*h(a) + y_C = (x_C - a)*(-a / h(a)) - h(a) + y_C. Evaluate at a=1/2: h(1/2) = sqrt(1 - (1/2)^2) = sqrt(1 - 1/4) = sqrt(3/4) = sqrt(3)/2. Then, g'(1/2) = (x_C - 1/2)*(-1/2) / (sqrt(3)/2) - sqrt(3)/2 + y_C. Simplify: (x_C - 1/2)*(-1/2) / (sqrt(3)/2) = (x_C - 1/2)*(-1/2) * (2 / sqrt(3)) = (x_C - 1/2)*(-1 / sqrt(3)). So, g'(1/2) = -(x_C - 1/2)/sqrt(3) - sqrt(3)/2 + y_C. We want g(1/2) = 0 and g'(1/2) = 0. First, g(1/2) = (x_C - 1/2)*h(1/2) + (1/2)*y_C = (x_C - 1/2)*(sqrt(3)/2) + (1/2)*y_C = 0. Second, g'(1/2) = -(x_C - 1/2)/sqrt(3) - sqrt(3)/2 + y_C = 0. From the first: (x_C - 1/2)*(sqrt(3)/2) + (1/2)*y_C = 0 => (1/2)*y_C = - (x_C - 1/2)*(sqrt(3)/2) => y_C = - (x_C - 1/2)*sqrt(3). From the second: -(x_C - 1/2)/sqrt(3) - sqrt(3)/2 + y_C = 0 => y_C = (x_C - 1/2)/sqrt(3) + sqrt(3)/2. Equate the two expressions for y_C: - (x_C - 1/2)*sqrt(3) = (x_C - 1/2)/sqrt(3) + sqrt(3)/2. Multiply both sides by sqrt(3): - (x_C - 1/2)*3 = (x_C - 1/2) + 3/2. Rearranged: -3(x_C - 1/2) - (x_C - 1/2) = 3/2 => -4(x_C - 1/2) = 3/2 => x_C - 1/2 = -3/8 => x_C = 1/2 - 3/8 = 1/8. Using y_C = - (x_C - 1/2)*sqrt(3) = - (1/8 - 1/2)*sqrt(3) = - (-3/8)*sqrt(3) = (3/8)*sqrt(3) = (3 sqrt(3))/8. Now, C = (x_C, y_C) = (1/8, (3 sqrt(3))/8). Compute OC^2 = x_C^2 + y_C^2 = (1/8)^2 + ((3 sqrt(3))/8)^2 = 1/64 + (9*3)/64 = 1/64 + 27/64 = 28/64 = 7/16. So OC^2 = 7/16, p=7, q=16, p+q=23.
