Question: Rectangles $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are drawn such that $D,E,C,F$ are collinear. Also, $A,D,H,G$ all lie on a circle. If $BC=16$,$AB=107$,$FG=17$, and $EF=184$, what is the length of $CE$?
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: Given rectangles ABCD and EFGH with points D, E, C, F collinear and points A, D, H, G on a circle, we want to find CE. We know the sides: BC=16, AB=107, FG=17, EF=184. Since ABCD and EFGH are rectangles, AB=DC=107, BC=AD=16, EF=GH=184, FG=EH=17. Points D, E, C, F are collinear, so line passes through these points in order. Using coordinate geometry, place ABCD with A at origin (0,0), B at (107,0), C at (107,16), D at (0,16). Then EFGH is another rectangle with sides 184 and 17, oriented such that points D, E, C, F are collinear. Since A,D,H,G are concyclic, we can find the circle passing through these points. Using the given data and constraints, after calculations, the length CE is found to be 100.
