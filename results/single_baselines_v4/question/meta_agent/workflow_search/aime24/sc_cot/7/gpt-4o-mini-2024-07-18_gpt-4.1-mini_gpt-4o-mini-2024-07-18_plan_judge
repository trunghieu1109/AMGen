proposed answer: We are given that \( \log_x(y^x) = 10 \) and \( \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 \), with \( x > 1 \) and \( y > 1 \).

Step 1: Rewrite the logarithmic equations using the definition of logarithm.

From \( \log_x(y^x) = 10 \), we have:
\[
 y^x = x^{10}.
\]

From \( \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 \), we have:
\[
 x^{4y} = y^{10}.
\]

Step 2: Take natural logarithms (ln) on both sides of each equation.

From the first equation:
\[
 \ln(y^x) = \ln(x^{10}) \\ x \ln y = 10 \ln x.
\]

From the second equation:
\[
 \ln(x^{4y}) = \ln(y^{10}) \\ 4y \ln x = 10 \ln y.
\]

Step 3: Let \( a = \ln x \) and \( b = \ln y \). Then:
\[
 x b = 10 a \\ 4 y a = 10 b.
\]

But recall that \( x = e^a \) and \( y = e^b \).

So the equations become:
\[
 e^a b = 10 a \\ 4 e^b a = 10 b.
\]

Step 4: From the first equation:
\[
 b = \frac{10 a}{e^a}.
\]

Substitute into the second equation:
\[
 4 e^b a = 10 b = 10 \cdot \frac{10 a}{e^a} = \frac{100 a}{e^a}.
\]

Divide both sides by \( a \) (since \( a = \ln x > 0 \)):
\[
 4 e^b = \frac{100}{e^a} \\ 4 e^b e^a = 100 \\ 4 e^{a+b} = 100 \\ e^{a+b} = 25.
\]

Step 5: Recall \( a = \ln x \), \( b = \ln y \), so:
\[
 e^{a+b} = e^{\ln x + \ln y} = e^{\ln(xy)} = xy = 25.
\]

Therefore, \( xy = 25 \).

This satisfies the conditions and both \( x > 1 \) and \( y > 1 \) are possible since 25 can be factored into two numbers greater than 1.

Answer: \( xy = 25 \).
