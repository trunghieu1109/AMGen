    <pre>We have a regular dodecagon (12-gon) with vertices equally spaced on a circle. We want to find the number of rectangles formed where each side of the rectangle lies on a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. 

Step 1: Understanding the problem
- The vertices of the dodecagon lie on a circle.
- Rectangles inscribed in a circle must be cyclic quadrilaterals with right angles.
- For a rectangle inscribed in a circle, opposite vertices are endpoints of a diameter of the circle.

Step 2: Properties of rectangles inscribed in a regular polygon
- Each rectangle corresponds to a pair of pairs of opposite vertices forming right angles.
- Since the polygon is regular, vertices are at angles 0°, 30°, 60°, ..., 330°.
- A rectangle inscribed in the circle must have vertices at four points such that the chords form right angles.

Step 3: Characterizing rectangles inside the dodecagon
- The rectangle&#39;s vertices must be vertices of the dodecagon.
- The rectangle&#39;s sides lie along sides or diagonals of the dodecagon.
- Each side of the rectangle corresponds to a chord between two vertices.

Step 4: Using the fact that rectangles inscribed in a circle have vertices that are pairs of points separated by 90° arcs
- The vertices of the rectangle must be pairs of points separated by 90° arcs on the circle.
- The circle is divided into 12 equal arcs of 30° each.
- 90° corresponds to 3 arcs (3*30°=90°).

Step 5: Find all quadruples of vertices separated by 3 arcs
- Label vertices 0 to 11.
- For each vertex i, the vertex opposite by 180° is (i + 6) mod 12.
- For a rectangle, the sides must be perpendicular, so the rectangle&#39;s vertices are at i, i+3, i+6, i+9 mod 12.
- These four vertices form a rectangle.

Step 6: Count how many such rectangles exist
- For i = 0 to 11, the quadruple (i, i+3, i+6, i+9) mod 12 forms a rectangle.
- However, each rectangle is counted 4 times (once for each vertex).
- So total rectangles = 12 / 4 = 3.

Step 7: Check if any other rectangles exist
- Since the polygon is regular and vertices are equally spaced, the only rectangles are those formed by vertices separated by 3 arcs (90°).
- So total number of rectangles is 3.

Therefore, the number of rectangles formed is 3.
