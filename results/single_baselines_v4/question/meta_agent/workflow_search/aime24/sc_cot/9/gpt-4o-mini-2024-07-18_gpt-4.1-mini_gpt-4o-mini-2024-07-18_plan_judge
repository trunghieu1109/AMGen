Question: Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: First, the total number of ways to choose 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1, 2, ..., 10} is C(10,4). Jen picks 4 distinct numbers. Let's call her chosen set J. The winning numbers are a randomly chosen 4-number subset W from S. 

Jen wins a prize if at least 2 of her numbers are in W. She wins the grand prize if all 4 of her numbers are in W.

We want P(grand prize | wins prize) = P(J = W | |J ∩ W| ≥ 2).

Since the winning numbers are chosen uniformly at random, and Jen's numbers are fixed, the probability that W equals any particular 4-number subset is 1 / C(10,4).

Number of 4-number subsets: C(10,4) = 210.

Number of subsets W such that |J ∩ W| = k for k=0,1,2,3,4:

- |J ∩ W| = 4 means W = J, so count = 1.
- |J ∩ W| = 3 means choose 3 from Jen's 4 numbers and 1 from the other 6 numbers: C(4,3)*C(6,1) = 4*6=24.
- |J ∩ W| = 2 means choose 2 from Jen's 4 numbers and 2 from the other 6 numbers: C(4,2)*C(6,2) = 6*15=90.
- |J ∩ W| = 1 means choose 1 from Jen's 4 numbers and 3 from the other 6 numbers: C(4,1)*C(6,3) = 4*20=80.
- |J ∩ W| = 0 means choose all 4 from the other 6 numbers: C(6,4)=15.

Check total: 1+24+90+80+15=210 correct.

Jen wins a prize if |J ∩ W| ≥ 2, so number of winning subsets = 1 + 24 + 90 = 115.

Probability of winning grand prize given winning prize = Number of grand prize outcomes / Number of prize winning outcomes = 1 / 115.

So m=1, n=115, m+n=116.
