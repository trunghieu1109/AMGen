Question: Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: Let the dimensions of the rectangular box be x, y, and z. We have two conditions: surface area and volume.

1) Surface area: 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 => xy + yz + zx = 27
2) Volume: xyz = 23

We want to find the smallest sphere that can contain the box. The smallest sphere that can contain a rectangular box is the sphere whose diameter is the space diagonal of the box.

The space diagonal d of the box is given by d = sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2). The radius r of the sphere is r = d/2.

We want to find the maximum possible value of r^2 for any box in the set B, which means we want to maximize d^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 subject to the constraints xy + yz + zx = 27 and xyz = 23.

Let's use the identity:
(x + y + z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + zx)
=> x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x + y + z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx)

We know xy + yz + zx = 27, so
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x + y + z)^2 - 54

We want to maximize x^2 + y^2 + z^2, which is equivalent to maximizing (x + y + z)^2.

Given xyz = 23 is fixed, and xy + yz + zx = 27, we want to maximize x + y + z.

Consider the cubic polynomial with roots x, y, z:
 t^3 - (x + y + z)t^2 + (xy + yz + zx)t - xyz = 0

Let S = x + y + z.

So the polynomial is:
 t^3 - S t^2 + 27 t - 23 = 0

We want to find the maximum S such that the polynomial has three positive real roots (since dimensions are positive).

Using the discriminant or analyzing the polynomial, the maximum sum S occurs when the polynomial has a double root.

The derivative is:
3 t^2 - 2 S t + 27 = 0

At double root t = r, the polynomial and its derivative both vanish:
 r^3 - S r^2 + 27 r - 23 = 0
 3 r^2 - 2 S r + 27 = 0

From the second equation:
 2 S r = 3 r^2 + 27
 => S = (3 r^2 + 27) / (2 r)

Plug into the first equation:
 r^3 - ((3 r^2 + 27) / (2 r)) r^2 + 27 r - 23 = 0
 => r^3 - (3 r^2 + 27)/2 * r + 27 r - 23 = 0
 => r^3 - (3 r^3 + 27 r)/2 + 27 r - 23 = 0
 Multiply all by 2:
 2 r^3 - (3 r^3 + 27 r) + 54 r - 46 = 0
 => 2 r^3 - 3 r^3 - 27 r + 54 r - 46 = 0
 => - r^3 + 27 r - 46 = 0
 => r^3 - 27 r + 46 = 0

We solve r^3 - 27 r + 46 = 0 for r.
Try rational roots: factors of 46 are ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46
Try r=2:
 8 - 54 + 46 = 0
So r=2 is a root.

Divide polynomial by (r-2):
 r^3 - 27 r + 46 = (r - 2)(r^2 + 2 r - 23)

Solve quadratic:
 r^2 + 2 r - 23 = 0
 r = (-2 ± sqrt(4 + 92)) / 2 = (-2 ± sqrt(96)) / 2 = (-2 ± 4 sqrt(6)) / 2 = -1 ± 2 sqrt(6)

Positive root: -1 + 2 sqrt(6) ~ -1 + 4.898 = 3.898

So the critical points for the derivative are r=2 and r=3.898.

At r=2, S = (3*4 + 27)/(2*2) = (12 + 27)/4 = 39/4 = 9.75
At r=3.898, S = (3*(3.898)^2 + 27)/(2*3.898)
 Calculate numerator: 3*(15.19) + 27 = 45.57 + 27 = 72.57
 Denominator: 7.796
 S = 72.57 / 7.796 ≈ 9.31

So maximum S is 9.75 at r=2.

Then, x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = S^2 - 54 = (9.75)^2 - 54 = 95.0625 - 54 = 41.0625 = 329/8

Therefore, the minimum radius squared is r^2 = (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)/4 = (329/8)/4 = 329/32

p = 329, q = 32, p + q = 361
