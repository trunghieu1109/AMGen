    <pre>Let the grid be:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
A &amp; B &amp; C \\
\hline
D &amp; E &amp; F \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

The two numbers formed by reading left to right are ABC and DEF. Their sum is 999:

100A + 10B + C + 100D + 10E + F = 999

The three numbers formed by reading top to bottom are AD, BE, and CF. Their sum is 99:

10A + D + 10B + E + 10C + F = 99

Rewrite the equations:
1) 100A + 10B + C + 100D + 10E + F = 999
2) (10A + D) + (10B + E) + (10C + F) = 99

Simplify equation 2:
10A + D + 10B + E + 10C + F = 99
=&gt; 10(A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = 99

From equation 1:
100(A + D) + 10(B + E) + (C + F) = 999

Let X = A + D, Y = B + E, Z = C + F

Equation 1: 100X + 10Y + Z = 999
Equation 2: 10(A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = 99

Note that X = A + D, Y = B + E, Z = C + F

From equation 1:
100X + 10Y + Z = 999
Since digits are from 0 to 9, X, Y, Z can be from 0 to 18 (max 9+9)

Try to find X, Y, Z satisfying 100X + 10Y + Z = 999

Since 999 is less than 1000, X can only be 9 (if X=9, 100*9=900, remainder 99 for 10Y + Z)

So X=9

Then 10Y + Z = 99

Y can be 9, Z=9 (since 10*9 + 9 = 99)

So X=9, Y=9, Z=9

So:
A + D = 9
B + E = 9
C + F = 9

From equation 2:
10(A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = 99

But D + E + F = (A + D + B + E + C + F) - (A + B + C) = (X + Y + Z) - (A + B + C) = 27 - (A + B + C)

So equation 2 becomes:
10(A + B + C) + 27 - (A + B + C) = 99
=&gt; 9(A + B + C) + 27 = 99
=&gt; 9(A + B + C) = 72
=&gt; A + B + C = 8

Since A + D = 9, D = 9 - A
Similarly, E = 9 - B, F = 9 - C

We have A, B, C digits from 0 to 9, sum 8
D, E, F automatically determined as above

Count the number of non-negative integer solutions to A + B + C = 8 with each digit between 0 and 9.
Since 8 &lt;= 9, no upper bound restriction is violated.

Number of solutions = C(8+3-1, 3-1) = C(10,2) = 45

Each solution corresponds to a valid grid:
A B C
D E F = 9 - A, 9 - B, 9 - C

Hence, total number of ways = 45.
