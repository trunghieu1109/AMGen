    <pre>Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice&#39;s play.

    <pre>We analyze the game where players remove either 1 or 4 tokens from a stack, and the player who takes the last token wins. Alice goes first. We want to find for how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 Bob has a winning strategy regardless of Alice&#39;s moves. This means n must be a losing position for the first player (Alice). We define a position as losing if the player to move cannot force a win, and winning if they can.

Let&#39;s denote by L the losing positions and by W the winning positions.

Base case:
- n=0 (no tokens to remove) is losing because the player to move cannot move.

For n&gt;0, position is winning if there is a move to a losing position, otherwise losing.

Check small values:
- n=0: L
- n=1: can remove 1 token to n=0(L), so n=1 is W
- n=2: remove 1 to n=1(W), remove 4 not possible; all moves lead to W, so n=2 is L
- n=3: remove 1 to n=2(L), so W
- n=4: remove 1 to n=3(W), remove 4 to n=0(L), so W
- n=5: remove 1 to n=4(W), remove 4 to n=1(W), all W, so L

Pattern so far:
0:L
1:W
2:L
3:W
4:W
5:L

Continue to identify pattern:
- n=6: remove 1 to 5(L), so W
- n=7: remove 1 to 6(W), remove 4 to 3(W), all W, so L
- n=8: remove 1 to 7(L), so W
- n=9: remove 1 to 8(W), remove 4 to 5(L), so W
- n=10: remove 1 to 9(W), remove 4 to 6(W), all W, so L

Losing positions so far: 0,2,5,7,10

Check differences:
From 0 to 2: +2
2 to 5: +3
5 to 7: +2
7 to 10: +3

Check more to confirm:
- n=11: remove 1 to 10(L), so W
- n=12: remove 1 to 11(W), remove 4 to 8(W), all W, so L
- n=13: remove 1 to 12(L), so W
- n=14: remove 1 to 13(W), remove 4 to 10(L), so W
- n=15: remove 1 to 14(W), remove 4 to 11(W), all W, so L

Losing positions: 0,2,5,7,10,12,15

Differences between losing positions:
0-&gt;2:2
2-&gt;5:3
5-&gt;7:2
7-&gt;10:3
10-&gt;12:2
12-&gt;15:3

Pattern: losing positions increase alternately by 2 and 3.

Starting from 0, losing positions are:
0, 2, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, 17, 20, 22, ...

Check if we can express losing positions as a function of k:
Let k=0: 0
k=1: 2
k=2: 5
k=3:7
k=4:10
k=5:12
k=6:15
k=7:17

We see that for even k (0,2,4,6,...): losing positions are 0,5,10,15,... which is 5*(k/2)
For odd k (1,3,5,7,...): losing positions are 2,7,12,17,... which is 5*((k-1)/2) + 2

Thus:
- For even k=2m: losing position = 5m
- For odd k=2m+1: losing position = 5m + 2

So losing positions are numbers congruent to 0 or 2 mod 5.

Since 0 is not positive, the positive losing positions are numbers n where n mod 5 = 0 or 2.

We want the count of positive integers n ≤ 2024 such that n mod 5 = 0 or 2.

Count numbers ≤ 2024 divisible by 5:
floor(2024/5) = 404
These are numbers congruent to 0 mod 5.

Count numbers ≤ 2024 congruent to 2 mod 5:
Numbers of form 5k + 2 ≤ 2024
5k ≤ 2022
k ≤ 404
So there are 405 such numbers (k=0 to 404).

Total losing positions (Bob&#39;s winning positions) = 404 + 405 = 809

Therefore, for 809 positive integers n ≤ 2024, Bob has a winning strategy.
