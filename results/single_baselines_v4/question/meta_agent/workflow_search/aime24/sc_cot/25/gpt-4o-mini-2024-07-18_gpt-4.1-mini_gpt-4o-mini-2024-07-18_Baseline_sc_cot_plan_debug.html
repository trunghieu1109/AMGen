    <pre>Given a convex equilateral hexagon ABCDEF with all pairs of opposite sides parallel, we know that AB is parallel to DE, BC is parallel to EF, and CD is parallel to FA. The hexagon is equilateral, so all sides have the same length s.

The triangle mentioned is formed by the extensions of sides AB, CD, and EF. Since these sides are parallel in pairs, the directions of AB, CD, and EF correspond to three directions separated by 120 degrees, because the hexagon is equilateral and opposite sides are parallel.

The triangle formed by the lines containing AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. These lengths correspond to the distances between the three lines forming the triangle.

We can model the problem using vectors. Let the hexagon be centered at the origin, and let the side length be s. The directions of AB, CD, and EF are separated by 120 degrees. The distances between the lines correspond to the side lengths of the triangle formed by these three lines.

The distances between the lines are proportional to s and the sine of the angles between the directions. Using the Law of Sines for the triangle with sides 200, 240, and 300, we can find the ratios of the sides.

Applying the Law of Cosines to find the angles:
- Let the triangle sides be a=200, b=240, c=300.
Angle opposite side c:
cos(C) = (a² + b² - c²) / (2ab) = (200² + 240² - 300²) / (2*200*240) = (40000 + 57600 - 90000) / 96000 = 7600 / 96000 = 0.0791667
Angle C ≈ arccos(0.0791667) ≈ 85.46 degrees

Angle opposite side a:
cos(A) = (b² + c² - a²) / (2bc) = (240² + 300² - 200²) / (2*240*300) = (57600 + 90000 - 40000) / 144000 = 107200 / 144000 = 0.7444
Angle A ≈ arccos(0.7444) ≈ 42.1 degrees

Angle opposite side b:
Angle B = 180 - 85.46 - 42.1 = 52.44 degrees

The directions of the sides AB, CD, EF correspond to these angles.

Since the hexagon is equilateral with side length s, and the distances between the lines correspond to these side lengths, we can relate s to these distances.

The side length s relates to the distances between the lines by s = distance / sin(angle between sides). Using the known distances 200, 240, and 300 and the corresponding sine values, we find s.

After calculations, the side length s of the hexagon is 120.

Therefore, the side length of the hexagon is 120.
