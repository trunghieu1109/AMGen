Question: Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.

proposed answer: Let the sets be D (diamond rings), G (golf clubs), S (garden spades), and C (candy hearts). We know the following: |D| = 195, |G| = 367, |S| = 562, and |C| = 900 (since every resident owns candy hearts). Total residents = 900. 437 residents own exactly two of these things, 234 own exactly three. We want to find the number who own all four things (D ∩ G ∩ S ∩ C). Let x be the number of residents who own all four. 

Define:
- n1 = number who own exactly one of the four items
- n2 = number who own exactly two of the four items = 437
- n3 = number who own exactly three of the four items = 234
- n4 = number who own all four = x

We know total residents = n1 + n2 + n3 + n4 = 900.

We also know the total number of owners for each item:
|D| = number who own D only + number who own D and exactly one other + number who own D and exactly two others + number who own all four = n(D only) + (number of people who own D and exactly one other) + (number of people who own D and exactly two others) + n4.

Similarly for G, S, and C.

The sum of the sizes of the sets is:
|D| + |G| + |S| + |C| = 195 + 367 + 562 + 900 = 2024.

We can express this sum in terms of n1, n2, n3, n4:
- Each person who owns exactly one item contributes 1 to the sum
- Each who owns exactly two items contributes 2
- Each who owns exactly three items contributes 3
- Each who owns all four contributes 4

So, 2024 = 1*n1 + 2*n2 + 3*n3 + 4*n4.

We have two equations:
1) n1 + n2 + n3 + n4 = 900
2) n1 + 2*n2 + 3*n3 + 4*n4 = 2024

Subtract equation 1 from equation 2:
(n1 + 2*n2 + 3*n3 + 4*n4) - (n1 + n2 + n3 + n4) = 2024 - 900
=> n2 + 2*n3 + 3*n4 = 1124

Substitute n2 = 437, n3 = 234:
437 + 2*234 + 3*x = 1124
437 + 468 + 3x = 1124
905 + 3x = 1124
3x = 1124 - 905 = 219
x = 219 / 3 = 73

So, the number of residents who own all four things is 73.
