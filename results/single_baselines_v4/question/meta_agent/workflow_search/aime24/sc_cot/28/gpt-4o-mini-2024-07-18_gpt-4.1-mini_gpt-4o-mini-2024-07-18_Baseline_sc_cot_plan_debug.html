    <pre>Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

Please think step by step and then solve the task.</pre>

    <pre>The torus T is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis in the plane of the circle, at a distance 6 from the center of the circle. This means the torus has a major radius R = 6 and a minor radius r = 3.

The sphere S has radius 11.

The torus is externally tangent to the sphere along a circle of radius r_i when it rests on the outside of the sphere. Similarly, there is another tangent circle of radius r_o when the torus rests on the sphere in another orientation.

The torus is formed by revolving the circle (radius 3) around an axis 6 units away. The cross-section circle center traces a circle of radius 6.

When the torus rests on the sphere externally tangent along a circle, the circle of tangency lies on the surface of the torus. The torus&#39;s points are at distance between 6 - 3 = 3 and 6 + 3 = 9 from the axis of revolution.

The sphere has radius 11. The torus can be tangent to the sphere along two distinct circles: one where the inner side of the torus touches the sphere (circle of smaller radius r_o), and one where the outer side of the torus touches the sphere (circle of larger radius r_i).

The distance from the axis of revolution to the circle of tangency on the torus is the radius of the circle along which the torus is tangent to the sphere.

When the torus is tangent to the sphere externally along a circle, the center of the torus circle (radius 3) is at distance R = 6 from the axis, and the torus surface points are at distances ranging from 3 to 9 from the axis.

The sphere of radius 11 is centered at the origin.

We consider the torus tangent to the sphere along a circle of radius r. The torus circle of revolution is centered at distance 6 from the axis. The tangent circle radius r on the torus is either 9 (outermost surface) or 3 (innermost surface).

But the problem says the torus is tangent along a circle with radius r_i and another with radius r_o, with r_i &gt; r_o.

The problem states the difference r_i - r_o can be written as m/n.

We need to find r_i and r_o.

The sphere radius is 11.

The torus is tangent externally to the sphere along a circle of radius r_i or r_o.

The distance from the center of the sphere to the circle of tangency on the torus is the radius of the sphere minus the radius of the cross-section circle of the torus.

The torus is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis at distance 6.

The torus points have distance from the axis between 3 and 9.

The sphere has radius 11.

The torus is tangent externally to the sphere along a circle of radius r_i or r_o.

When the torus rests on the sphere externally tangent along a circle, the circle of tangency lies on the torus surface, meaning the distance from the center of the sphere to the circle is equal to the radius of the sphere minus the radius of the torus tube at that point.

The torus is tangent along circles of radius R ± r = 6 ± 3 = 9 or 3.

The torus is tangent to the sphere along a circle of radius r_i or r_o.

The difference is r_i - r_o = 9 - 3 = 6.

But the problem implies the difference is a fraction m/n.

Wait, the problem mentions the torus rests on the outside of the sphere, tangent along a circle with radius r_i, and when it rests on the outside of the sphere, tangent along a circle with radius r_o. The wording is ambiguous.

Possibly, the torus can be tangent to the sphere externally in two different ways: one where the torus &#39;sits&#39; on the sphere with its outer surface tangent, and one where it &#39;sits&#39; on the sphere with its inner surface tangent.

The key is to find the radii of the circles of tangency r_i and r_o.

To find the radii of the circles of tangency, consider the distance from the axis of revolution to the circle of tangency on the torus.

The sphere has radius 11.

The torus is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 centered at distance 6 from the axis.

Let the torus be tangent to the sphere along a circle of radius r.

The sphere center is at the origin.

The torus circle center is at distance 6 from the axis.

The torus surface points are at distances from the axis between 3 and 9.

When the torus rests on the sphere, the sphere and torus are tangent externally along a circle.

The distance from the origin to the circle of tangency is the radius of the sphere minus the radius of the torus tube at that point.

The torus tube radius is 3.

The circle of tangency lies at radius r from the axis, so the distance from the origin to the circle is r.

The sphere radius is 11.

The distance from the origin to the circle of tangency is equal to the sphere radius minus the radius of the torus tube at that point.

Therefore, r = 11 - 3 = 8.

But 8 is not equal to 3 or 9.

So this suggests the circle of tangency radius r is 8.

But the torus surface points are at distances from the axis between 3 and 9.

Is 8 between 3 and 9? Yes.

So the torus is tangent to the sphere along a circle of radius 8.

Similarly, the torus can be tangent to the sphere along a circle of radius r_o.

When the torus rests on the sphere in the other orientation, the circle of tangency radius is r_o = 4.

How do we get 4?

Because the sphere radius is 11, and the torus tube radius is 3, the circle of tangency radius r satisfies r = 11 ± 3 = 14 or 8.

But 14 is outside the torus radius range (3 to 9), so only 8 is possible.

Alternatively, the torus can be tangent along the inner circle of radius 3, so the sphere radius 11 equals r ± 3, so r = 11 ± 3 = 8 or 14, but only 8 is possible.

This suggests the circle of tangency radius is 8.

But the problem says there are two circles of tangency with radii r_i and r_o.

Reconsidering, the torus is generated by revolving a circle (radius 3) around an axis at distance 6.

The torus points have distance from the axis between 3 and 9.

The sphere has radius 11.

When the torus is tangent to the sphere externally along a circle, the sphere radius equals the distance from the origin to the circle plus or minus the torus tube radius.

So sphere radius = r ± 3.

Therefore, r = 11 ± 3 = 14 or 8.

But torus points are between 3 and 9, so only 8 is possible.

Therefore, the circle of tangency radius is 8.

But the problem says there are two such circles with radii r_i and r_o.

Is it possible that the torus is tangent to the sphere along two circles of radius 8, but with different orientations?

Alternatively, perhaps the torus is tangent to the sphere along circles of radius r_i = 9 and r_o = 5.

Because the torus points are between 3 and 9, so 5 and 9 are possible.

If sphere radius = r ± 3, then for r = 9, sphere radius = 12 or 6.

For r = 5, sphere radius = 8 or 2.

None matches sphere radius 11.

Try r = 8: sphere radius = 11 ± 3 = 14 or 8; 11 is sphere radius.

Try r = 6: sphere radius = 9 or 3.

Try r = 7: sphere radius = 10 or 4.

Try r = 8: sphere radius = 11 or 5.

So sphere radius 11 corresponds to r = 8 with sphere radius = r + 3.

Therefore, the circle of tangency radius is 8.

Similarly, for the other tangent circle, sphere radius = r - 3 = 11 =&gt; r = 14 (which is outside torus range).

So only r = 8 is possible.

Therefore, there is only one circle of tangency radius 8.

But the problem says there are two circles with radii r_i and r_o.

Wait, the problem says &#34;When T rests on the outside of S, it is externally tangent along a circle with radius r_i, and when T rests on the outside of S, it is externally tangent along a circle with radius r_o.&#34; The wording is the same &#34;rests on the outside&#34; twice, possibly a typo; maybe one should be &#34;rests on the inside&#34; or &#34;rests on the inside&#34; or &#34;rests on the inside&#34;.

Assuming one is when the torus is inside the sphere, the other when outside.

If the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere radius = r ± 3.

If the torus is outside the sphere, sphere radius = r ± 3.

Given sphere radius 11, possible r are 8 and 14.

14 is outside torus range.

So r_i = 9 (outer radius of torus), r_o = 3 (inner radius of torus).

The difference r_i - r_o = 9 - 3 = 6.

The problem wants m + n where difference is m/n.

So difference is 6/1, so m + n = 6 + 1 = 7.

Therefore, the answer is 7.
