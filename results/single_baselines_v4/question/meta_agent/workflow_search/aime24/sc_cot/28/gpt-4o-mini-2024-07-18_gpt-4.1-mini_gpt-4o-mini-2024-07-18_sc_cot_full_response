Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.\Pattern: sc_cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent NZ62', content='The torus T is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis in the plane of the circle, at a distance 6 from the center of the circle. This means the torus has a major radius R = 6 and a minor radius r = 3.\n\nThe sphere S has radius 11.\n\nThe torus is externally tangent to the sphere along a circle of radius r_i when it rests on the outside of the sphere. Similarly, there is another tangent circle of radius r_o when the torus rests on the sphere in another orientation.\n\nThe torus is formed by revolving the circle (radius 3) around an axis 6 units away. The cross-section circle center traces a circle of radius 6.\n\nWhen the torus rests on the sphere externally tangent along a circle, the circle of tangency lies on the surface of the torus. The torus\'s points are at distance between 6 - 3 = 3 and 6 + 3 = 9 from the axis of revolution.\n\nThe sphere has radius 11. The torus can be tangent to the sphere along two distinct circles: one where the inner side of the torus touches the sphere (circle of smaller radius r_o), and one where the outer side of the torus touches the sphere (circle of larger radius r_i).\n\nThe distance from the axis of revolution to the circle of tangency on the torus is the radius of the circle along which the torus is tangent to the sphere.\n\nWhen the torus is tangent to the sphere externally along a circle, the center of the torus circle (radius 3) is at distance R = 6 from the axis, and the torus surface points are at distances ranging from 3 to 9 from the axis.\n\nThe sphere of radius 11 is centered at the origin.\n\nWe consider the torus tangent to the sphere along a circle of radius r. The torus circle of revolution is centered at distance 6 from the axis. The tangent circle radius r on the torus is either 9 (outermost surface) or 3 (innermost surface).\n\nBut the problem says the torus is tangent along a circle with radius r_i and another with radius r_o, with r_i > r_o.\n\nThe problem states the difference r_i - r_o can be written as m/n.\n\nWe need to find r_i and r_o.\n\nThe sphere radius is 11.\n\nThe torus is tangent externally to the sphere along a circle of radius r_i or r_o.\n\nThe distance from the center of the sphere to the circle of tangency on the torus is the radius of the sphere minus the radius of the cross-section circle of the torus.\n\nThe torus is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis at distance 6.\n\nThe torus points have distance from the axis between 3 and 9.\n\nThe sphere has radius 11.\n\nThe torus is tangent externally to the sphere along a circle of radius r_i or r_o.\n\nWhen the torus rests on the sphere externally tangent along a circle, the circle of tangency lies on the torus surface, meaning the distance from the center of the sphere to the circle is equal to the radius of the sphere minus the radius of the torus tube at that point.\n\nThe torus is tangent along circles of radius R ± r = 6 ± 3 = 9 or 3.\n\nThe torus is tangent to the sphere along a circle of radius r_i or r_o.\n\nThe difference is r_i - r_o = 9 - 3 = 6.\n\nBut the problem implies the difference is a fraction m/n.\n\nWait, the problem mentions the torus rests on the outside of the sphere, tangent along a circle with radius r_i, and when it rests on the outside of the sphere, tangent along a circle with radius r_o. The wording is ambiguous.\n\nPossibly, the torus can be tangent to the sphere externally in two different ways: one where the torus \'sits\' on the sphere with its outer surface tangent, and one where it \'sits\' on the sphere with its inner surface tangent.\n\nThe key is to find the radii of the circles of tangency r_i and r_o.\n\nTo find the radii of the circles of tangency, consider the distance from the axis of revolution to the circle of tangency on the torus.\n\nThe sphere has radius 11.\n\nThe torus is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 centered at distance 6 from the axis.\n\nLet the torus be tangent to the sphere along a circle of radius r.\n\nThe sphere center is at the origin.\n\nThe torus circle center is at distance 6 from the axis.\n\nThe torus surface points are at distances from the axis between 3 and 9.\n\nWhen the torus rests on the sphere, the sphere and torus are tangent externally along a circle.\n\nThe distance from the origin to the circle of tangency is the radius of the sphere minus the radius of the torus tube at that point.\n\nThe torus tube radius is 3.\n\nThe circle of tangency lies at radius r from the axis, so the distance from the origin to the circle is r.\n\nThe sphere radius is 11.\n\nThe distance from the origin to the circle of tangency is equal to the sphere radius minus the radius of the torus tube at that point.\n\nTherefore, r = 11 - 3 = 8.\n\nBut 8 is not equal to 3 or 9.\n\nSo this suggests the circle of tangency radius r is 8.\n\nBut the torus surface points are at distances from the axis between 3 and 9.\n\nIs 8 between 3 and 9? Yes.\n\nSo the torus is tangent to the sphere along a circle of radius 8.\n\nSimilarly, the torus can be tangent to the sphere along a circle of radius r_o.\n\nWhen the torus rests on the sphere in the other orientation, the circle of tangency radius is r_o = 4.\n\nHow do we get 4?\n\nBecause the sphere radius is 11, and the torus tube radius is 3, the circle of tangency radius r satisfies r = 11 ± 3 = 14 or 8.\n\nBut 14 is outside the torus radius range (3 to 9), so only 8 is possible.\n\nAlternatively, the torus can be tangent along the inner circle of radius 3, so the sphere radius 11 equals r ± 3, so r = 11 ± 3 = 8 or 14, but only 8 is possible.\n\nThis suggests the circle of tangency radius is 8.\n\nBut the problem says there are two circles of tangency with radii r_i and r_o.\n\nReconsidering, the torus is generated by revolving a circle (radius 3) around an axis at distance 6.\n\nThe torus points have distance from the axis between 3 and 9.\n\nThe sphere has radius 11.\n\nWhen the torus is tangent to the sphere externally along a circle, the sphere radius equals the distance from the origin to the circle plus or minus the torus tube radius.\n\nSo sphere radius = r ± 3.\n\nTherefore, r = 11 ± 3 = 14 or 8.\n\nBut torus points are between 3 and 9, so only 8 is possible.\n\nTherefore, the circle of tangency radius is 8.\n\nBut the problem says there are two such circles with radii r_i and r_o.\n\nIs it possible that the torus is tangent to the sphere along two circles of radius 8, but with different orientations?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the torus is tangent to the sphere along circles of radius r_i = 9 and r_o = 5.\n\nBecause the torus points are between 3 and 9, so 5 and 9 are possible.\n\nIf sphere radius = r ± 3, then for r = 9, sphere radius = 12 or 6.\n\nFor r = 5, sphere radius = 8 or 2.\n\nNone matches sphere radius 11.\n\nTry r = 8: sphere radius = 11 ± 3 = 14 or 8; 11 is sphere radius.\n\nTry r = 6: sphere radius = 9 or 3.\n\nTry r = 7: sphere radius = 10 or 4.\n\nTry r = 8: sphere radius = 11 or 5.\n\nSo sphere radius 11 corresponds to r = 8 with sphere radius = r + 3.\n\nTherefore, the circle of tangency radius is 8.\n\nSimilarly, for the other tangent circle, sphere radius = r - 3 = 11 => r = 14 (which is outside torus range).\n\nSo only r = 8 is possible.\n\nTherefore, there is only one circle of tangency radius 8.\n\nBut the problem says there are two circles with radii r_i and r_o.\n\nWait, the problem says "When T rests on the outside of S, it is externally tangent along a circle with radius r_i, and when T rests on the outside of S, it is externally tangent along a circle with radius r_o." The wording is the same "rests on the outside" twice, possibly a typo; maybe one should be "rests on the inside" or "rests on the inside" or "rests on the inside".\n\nAssuming one is when the torus is inside the sphere, the other when outside.\n\nIf the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere radius = r ± 3.\n\nIf the torus is outside the sphere, sphere radius = r ± 3.\n\nGiven sphere radius 11, possible r are 8 and 14.\n\n14 is outside torus range.\n\nSo r_i = 9 (outer radius of torus), r_o = 3 (inner radius of torus).\n\nThe difference r_i - r_o = 9 - 3 = 6.\n\nThe problem wants m + n where difference is m/n.\n\nSo difference is 6/1, so m + n = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 7.\n\nAnswer:7', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
