Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: Given a convex equilateral hexagon ABCDEF with all pairs of opposite sides parallel, the hexagon is equilateral, so all sides have the same length, say s. The pairs of opposite sides (AB and DE, BC and EF, CD and FA) are parallel. The problem states that the triangle formed by the extensions of sides AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. We need to find the side length s of the hexagon.

Step 1: Understand the hexagon and the triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF.
- Since ABCDEF is equilateral and opposite sides are parallel, the hexagon is a special type called an affine-regular hexagon.

Step 2: The triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF means the triangle formed by the intersection points of lines containing these sides.

Step 3: Consider the vectors representing sides AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FA. Since the hexagon is equilateral and opposite sides are parallel, the vectors satisfy:
  AB = s * u
  BC = s * v
  CD = s * w
  DE = s * (-u)
  EF = s * (-v)
  FA = s * (-w)
where u, v, w are unit vectors and u, v, w are directions of AB, BC, CD respectively.

Step 4: The triangle formed by the lines containing AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, 300. These side lengths correspond to the distances between the intersection points of these lines.

Step 5: Using the properties of the hexagon and the triangle, the side length s can be found by relating the side lengths of the triangle formed by the extensions to s.

Step 6: The side lengths of the triangle formed by the extensions are proportional to the side length s of the hexagon. The given triangle side lengths 200, 240, and 300 correspond to the magnitudes of the sums of vectors u+v, v+w, w+u multiplied by s.

Step 7: Using the triangle inequality and the given side lengths, and the fact that the hexagon is equilateral, the side length s can be computed as the greatest common divisor or a proportional scaling factor.

Step 8: Since the triangle sides are 200, 240, and 300, and 200, 240, 300 form a triangle (200+240>300, etc.), the side length s is the greatest common divisor of these lengths divided by a factor related to the geometry.

Step 9: The side length s is 40.

This result comes from the fact that the triangle formed by the extensions has sides 200, 240, and 300, which are multiples of 40, and the side length of the hexagon is the common factor 40.
