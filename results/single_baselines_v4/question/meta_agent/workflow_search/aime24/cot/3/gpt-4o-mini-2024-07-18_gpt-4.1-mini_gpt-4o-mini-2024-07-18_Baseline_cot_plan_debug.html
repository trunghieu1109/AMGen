    <pre>First, let&#39;s analyze the functions f and g:

f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|
This function takes the absolute value of x, subtracts 1/2, then takes the absolute value again.

Similarly,
g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|

Next, consider the expressions inside the functions in the problem:

We have y = 4 * g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4 * g(f(cos(3πy))).

We need to find the number of intersections of the graphs of these two equations, i.e., the number of (x,y) pairs satisfying both simultaneously.

Step 1: Understand the range and behavior of f and g.

For any real number t, |t| ≥ 0.

For f(t) = ||t| - 1/2|, since |t| ≥ 0, then |t| - 1/2 can be positive or negative.

Let&#39;s analyze f(t) for t in [0,1] (because sin and cos outputs are in [-1,1], so |sin(2πx)| and |cos(3πy)| are in [0,1]):

- For |t| in [0,1], f(t) = | |t| - 1/2 | = distance of |t| from 1/2.

So f(t) ranges from 0 to 1/2.

Similarly, g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Since f(t) ranges in [0,1/2], then g(f(t)) = |f(t) - 1/4| (since f(t) ≥ 0).

So g(f(t)) = |f(t) - 1/4|.

Since f(t) ∈ [0, 1/2], then g(f(t)) ∈ [0, 1/4].

Step 2: Define u = sin(2πx), v = cos(3πy).

Then define:
A = f(|u|) = ||u| - 1/2|
B = f(|v|) = ||v| - 1/2|

Then:
y = 4 * g(A) = 4 * |A - 1/4|

x = 4 * g(B) = 4 * |B - 1/4|

Step 3: Since y depends on x through u=sin(2πx), and x depends on y through v=cos(3πy), the system is symmetric in a sense.

Step 4: Let&#39;s analyze possible values of x and y.

Since g(A) ∈ [0, 1/4], then y ∈ [0,1]. Similarly, x ∈ [0,1].

Step 5: Let&#39;s consider the possible values of A and B.

Recall A = ||u| - 1/2|, u ∈ [-1,1], so |u| ∈ [0,1].

So A = distance of |u| from 1/2.

Similarly for B.

Step 6: Let&#39;s consider the function h(t) = 4 * g(f(t)) for t in [-1,1].

Since f(t) = ||t| - 1/2|, and g(x) = |x - 1/4|, then h(t) = 4 * |f(t) - 1/4| = 4 * |||t| - 1/2| - 1/4|.

Let&#39;s analyze h(t) for t ∈ [0,1]:

- When |t| = 0: f(0) = |0 - 1/2| = 1/2, so f(0) = 1/2.
- Then h(0) = 4 * |1/2 - 1/4| = 4 * 1/4 = 1.

- When |t| = 1/2: f(1/2) = |1/2 - 1/2| = 0.
- h(1/2) = 4 * |0 - 1/4| = 4 * 1/4 = 1.

- When |t| = 1/4: f(1/4) = |1/4 - 1/2| = 1/4.
- h(1/4) = 4 * |1/4 - 1/4| = 0.

- When |t| = 3/4: f(3/4) = |3/4 - 1/2| = 1/4.
- h(3/4) = 0.

So h(t) is 0 at |t|=1/4 and 3/4, and 1 at |t|=0 and 1/2.

Plotting h(t) as a function of |t|, it looks like a &#39;W&#39; shape with zeros at 1/4 and 3/4, peaks at 0 and 1/2.

Step 7: Now, y = h(sin(2πx)) and x = h(cos(3πy)).

We want to find the number of (x,y) ∈ [0,1]² such that:

y = h(sin(2πx))
x = h(cos(3πy))

Step 8: Notice that h(t) depends only on |t|, so h(sin(2πx)) = h(|sin(2πx)|).

Step 9: Since h(|t|) has zeros at |t|=1/4 and 3/4, and maximum 1 at |t|=0,1/2, the function h(|sin(2πx)|) oscillates between 0 and 1 as x varies from 0 to 1.

Similarly for h(|cos(3πy)|).

Step 10: To find intersections, we look for solutions (x,y) satisfying:

y = h(|sin(2πx)|)
x = h(|cos(3πy)|)

Step 11: The problem is symmetric and periodic. Let&#39;s consider the possible values of h(|sin(2πx)|) and h(|cos(3πy)|).

Step 12: Since h(t) achieves 0 at |t|=1/4 and 3/4, and 1 at |t|=0,1/2, the function h(|sin(2πx)|) has zeros at x such that |sin(2πx)| = 1/4 or 3/4.

Similarly for h(|cos(3πy)|).

Step 13: To count the number of solutions, we consider the ranges and the periodicity.

- sin(2πx) has period 1.
- cos(3πy) has period 2/3.

Step 14: The possible values of y = h(|sin(2πx)|) lie in [0,1]. Similarly for x.

Step 15: The system reduces to finding fixed points of the map:

(x,y) → (h(|cos(3πy)|), h(|sin(2πx)|))

Step 16: The number of intersections corresponds to the number of fixed points of this system in [0,1]².

Step 17: By analyzing the structure, the number of solutions is 16.

This is because each function h(|sin(2πx)|) and h(|cos(3πy)|) has 4 zeros and 3 maxima/minima in [0,1], and the composition leads to 16 intersection points.

Therefore, the number of intersections of the graphs is 16.
