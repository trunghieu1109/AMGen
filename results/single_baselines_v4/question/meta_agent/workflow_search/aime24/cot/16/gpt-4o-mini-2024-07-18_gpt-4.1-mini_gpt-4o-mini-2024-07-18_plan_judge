Question: Let $\triangle ABC$ have circumcenter $O$ and incenter $I$ with $\overline{IA}\perp\overline{OI}$, circumradius $13$, and inradius $6$. Find $AB\cdot AC$.
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: We are given a triangle ABC with circumcenter O and incenter I. The circumradius R = 13 and the inradius r = 6. We know that IA is perpendicular to OI. We want to find the product AB * AC.

Step 1: Understand the configuration.
- O is the circumcenter.
- I is the incenter.
- IA is perpendicular to OI.

Step 2: Use coordinate geometry for clarity.
Place O at the origin (0,0).
Since O is the circumcenter and circumradius R = 13, points A, B, C lie on the circle centered at O with radius 13.

Step 3: Position A on the circle.
Let A be at (13, 0) without loss of generality (on the positive x-axis).

Step 4: Coordinates of I.
I is inside the triangle and satisfies IA ⟂ OI.
Let I = (x, y).

Step 5: The vector OI = (x, y), and IA = A - I = (13 - x, 0 - y) = (13 - x, -y).

Step 6: Since IA ⟂ OI, their dot product is zero:
(x, y) · (13 - x, -y) = 0
=> x(13 - x) + y(-y) = 0
=> 13x - x^2 - y^2 = 0

Step 7: Rearranged:
13x = x^2 + y^2

Step 8: Note that x^2 + y^2 = |OI|^2.
So 13x = |OI|^2.

Step 9: We know I is the incenter, and the incenter lies inside the triangle. The distance |OI| is known to satisfy Euler's formula relating circumradius R, inradius r, and distance d = |OI|:
OI^2 = R(R - 2r)

Given R = 13 and r = 6:
OI^2 = 13(13 - 12) = 13(1) = 13

Step 10: From step 8, 13x = |OI|^2 = 13
=> x = 1

Step 11: Since |OI|^2 = x^2 + y^2 = 13, and x = 1,
y^2 = 13 - 1 = 12
=> y = ±2√3

Step 12: The incenter I is at (1, 2√3) or (1, -2√3).

Step 13: Now, the product AB * AC is asked.

Step 14: Use the formula involving the angle at A and the circumradius:
AB = 2R sin B
AC = 2R sin C

So AB * AC = 4R^2 sin B sin C

Step 15: Using the incenter coordinates, we can find the angle at A.
Since A is at (13,0), and points B and C lie on the circle x^2 + y^2 = 169.

Step 16: The incenter is the intersection of angle bisectors. The vector IA bisects angle A.

Step 17: Vector IA = I - A = (1 - 13, 2√3 - 0) = (-12, 2√3)

Step 18: The angle bisector at A points in direction of IA.

Step 19: The angle at A is twice the angle between vector AB and the bisector IA.

Step 20: The vectors AB and AC are symmetric with respect to IA.

Step 21: Let’s find the cosine of angle A.

Step 22: Vector OA = (13, 0)
Vector OI = (1, 2√3)

Step 23: Angle between OA and OI is:
cos θ = (OA · OI) / (|OA||OI|) = (13*1 + 0*2√3) / (13 * √13) = 13 / (13√13) = 1 / √13

Step 24: Since IA ⟂ OI, the angle at A is related to this.

Step 25: Use the formula for incenter coordinates in terms of sides:
I_x = (a x_A + b x_B + c x_C) / (a + b + c), similarly for y.

Step 26: This is complicated; instead, use the formula:
OI^2 = R(R - 2r) = 13

Step 27: Use the formula:
AB * AC = (b)(c) = (s)(s - a) where s = semiperimeter.

Step 28: Use the formula for area:
Area = r * s

Step 29: Use formula for area in terms of sides and circumradius:
Area = (abc) / (4R)

Step 30: Use the formula:
OI^2 = R(R - 2r)

Step 31: From the given, the product AB * AC = (s)(s - a)

Step 32: Use the formula relating sides and inradius:
r = 2 * Area / (a + b + c)

Step 33: Use the formula:
OI^2 = R^2 - 2Rr

Step 34: Plugging in R=13, r=6:
OI^2 = 169 - 156 = 13

Step 35: Use the formula:
AB * AC = (s)(s - a)

Step 36: Use the formula:
IA^2 = r^2 + (s - a)^2

Step 37: Since IA is perpendicular to OI, and we have coordinates, IA length is:
IA = distance between I(1, 2√3) and A(13, 0)
= sqrt((13 - 1)^2 + (0 - 2√3)^2) = sqrt(12^2 + (2√3)^2) = sqrt(144 + 12) = sqrt(156) = 2√39

Step 38: IA^2 = 156

Step 39: IA^2 = r^2 + (s - a)^2
=> 156 = 36 + (s - a)^2
=> (s - a)^2 = 120
=> s - a = 2√30

Step 40: Also, r = 6 = Area / s
=> Area = 6s

Step 41: Area = (abc) / (4R)

Step 42: Using Heron's formula:
Area^2 = s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)

Step 43: We want AB * AC = (s)(s - a) = ?

Step 44: Let x = s, y = s - a = 2√30

Step 45: Then AB * AC = x * y = x * 2√30

Step 46: Use formula for OI^2:
OI^2 = R(R - 2r) = 13

Step 47: The problem is complex, but from the above, the product AB * AC = 2√30 * s

Step 48: But we need numeric value.

Step 49: From the formula for IA^2 = r^2 + (s - a)^2
We have s - a = 2√30

Step 50: From the formula for inradius:
r = 6 = Area / s
=> Area = 6s

Step 51: Area^2 = s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)

Step 52: We don't know s - b or s - c, but if we assume triangle is isosceles at A (since A lies at (13,0) and I lies on x=1, y=±2√3), then AB = AC

Step 53: Then b = c

Step 54: Then s = (a + 2b)/2
=> s - a = (2b - a)/2 = 2√30

Step 55: Then s = a + 2√30

Step 56: From s = (a + 2b)/2
=> 2s = a + 2b

Step 57: Substitute s = a + 2√30
=> 2(a + 2√30) = a + 2b
=> 2a + 4√30 = a + 2b
=> a + 4√30 = 2b
=> b = (a + 4√30)/2

Step 58: Now, AB * AC = b^2 = ((a + 4√30)/2)^2

Step 59: Use Law of Cosines at A:
Since A at (13,0), B and C on circle of radius 13, and AB = AC = b

Step 60: The length BC can be found using the inradius and circumradius formulas, but this is complex.

Step 61: Alternatively, use the formula for the distance between incenter and vertex A:
IA^2 = r^2 + (s - a)^2 = 156

Step 62: We already have s - a = 2√30

Step 63: From the formula for the circumradius in terms of sides and angles:
R = a / (2 sin A)

Step 64: Since A at (13,0), and IA is angle bisector, angle A can be found from the vector IA.

Step 65: The vector IA is (-12, 2√3), so the angle bisector direction makes angle θ with x-axis:
tan θ = (2√3)/(-12) = -√3/6

Step 66: Angle θ ≈ -16.1 degrees (or 163.9 degrees if positive direction)

Step 67: Since A is at (13,0), angle A is twice the angle between OA and IA.

Step 68: The angle between OA (along x-axis) and IA is about 16.1 degrees.

Step 69: So angle A ≈ 2 * 16.1 = 32.2 degrees

Step 70: Then sin A ≈ sin 32.2° ≈ 0.533

Step 71: Given R = 13, a = BC = 2R sin A = 2 * 13 * 0.533 = 13.86

Step 72: Now, s - a = 2√30 ≈ 2 * 5.477 = 10.954

Step 73: s = a + (s - a) = 13.86 + 10.954 = 24.814

Step 74: Then AB * AC = s (s - a) = 24.814 * 10.954 ≈ 271.8

Step 75: As the problem likely expects an exact value, note that s - a = 2√30, s = a + 2√30.

Step 76: So AB * AC = s (s - a) = (a + 2√30)(2√30) = 2√30 a + 4 * 30 = 2√30 a + 120

Step 77: Using a ≈ 13.86, 2√30 a ≈ 2 * 5.477 * 13.86 ≈ 151.8

Step 78: So AB * AC ≈ 151.8 + 120 = 271.8

Step 79: The closest integer is 272.

Therefore, AB * AC = 272.
