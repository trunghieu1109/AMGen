Question: Find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon ($12$-gon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The diagram below shows three of those rectangles.

proposed answer: We are looking for the number of rectangles inside a regular 12-gon, where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Since the polygon is regular, all vertices lie on a circle, and the sides and diagonals correspond to chords of the circle between vertices. 

Key observations:
1. Rectangles inscribed in a circle are cyclic quadrilaterals with right angles.
2. A rectangle inscribed in a circle must have its vertices pairwise opposite on the circle.
3. In a regular polygon, the only rectangles that can be formed from vertices are those whose vertices are pairs of opposite points on the circle.

Since the polygon is regular with 12 vertices, the vertices are equally spaced every 30 degrees around the circle.

To form a rectangle:
- The vertices must be at four points such that the quadrilateral is a rectangle.
- This means the vertices must be pairs of opposite points on the circle, i.e., vertices that are 180 degrees apart.

Number of vertices = 12
Number of opposite pairs = 12 / 2 = 6

Each rectangle is defined by two pairs of opposite vertices.
We can choose 2 pairs out of 6 pairs to form a rectangle.

Number of rectangles = C(6, 2) = 6*5/2 = 15

Therefore, there are 15 rectangles that can be formed inside the regular dodecagon with sides or diagonals as rectangle sides.
