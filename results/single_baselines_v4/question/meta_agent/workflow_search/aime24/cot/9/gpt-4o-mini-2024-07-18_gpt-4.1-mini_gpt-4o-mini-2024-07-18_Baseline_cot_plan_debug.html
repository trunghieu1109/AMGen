    <pre>Total numbers in the set S is 10. Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from S, and 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. The total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is C(10,4) = 210.

Jen wins a prize if at least two of her numbers are among the randomly chosen numbers. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers are chosen.

Let Jen&#39;s chosen set be J with 4 numbers.

1. Probability of winning the grand prize:
   This is the probability that the 4 numbers chosen randomly are exactly Jen&#39;s 4 numbers.
   Number of ways this can happen = 1 (only Jen&#39;s set)
   Probability = 1 / 210

2. Probability of winning a prize (at least 2 matches):
   We need to find the number of 4-number subsets from S that have at least 2 elements in common with J.

   Let&#39;s count the number of 4-subsets with exactly k matches with J, for k=0,1,2,3,4.

   - Exactly 0 matches:
     Choose all 4 numbers from the 6 numbers not in J.
     Number of ways = C(6,4) = 15

   - Exactly 1 match:
     Choose 1 number from J and 3 numbers from outside J.
     Number of ways = C(4,1)*C(6,3) = 4 * 20 = 80

   - Exactly 2 matches:
     Choose 2 numbers from J and 2 from outside.
     Number of ways = C(4,2)*C(6,2) = 6 * 15 = 90

   - Exactly 3 matches:
     Choose 3 from J and 1 from outside.
     Number of ways = C(4,3)*C(6,1) = 4 * 6 = 24

   - Exactly 4 matches:
     Choose all 4 from J.
     Number of ways = 1

   Check sum: 15 + 80 + 90 + 24 + 1 = 210 (total subsets, correct)

   Number of winning sets (at least 2 matches) = 90 + 24 + 1 = 115

3. Probability of winning a prize = 115 / 210

4. Probability of winning the grand prize given winning a prize = (Probability of grand prize) / (Probability of prize)
   = (1/210) / (115/210) = 1 / 115

So the fraction is 1/115, where m=1 and n=115.

Therefore, m + n = 1 + 115 = 116.
