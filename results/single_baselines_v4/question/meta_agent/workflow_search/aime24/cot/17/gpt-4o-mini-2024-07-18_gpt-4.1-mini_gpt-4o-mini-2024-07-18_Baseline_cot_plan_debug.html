    <pre>We are given nonnegative integers a, b, c such that a + b + c = 300 and a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000. First, simplify the second equation. Factor it as a^2(b+c) + b^2(a+c) + c^2(a+b). Since a+b+c=300, b+c=300 - a, a+c=300 - b, and a+b=300 - c. Substitute these: a^2(300 - a) + b^2(300 - b) + c^2(300 - c) = 6,000,000. This expands to 300(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) - (a^3 + b^3 + c^3) = 6,000,000. Let S1 = a + b + c = 300, S2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2, S3 = a^3 + b^3 + c^3. The equation is 300 * S2 - S3 = 6,000,000. We want to find all triples (a,b,c) of nonnegative integers summing to 300 satisfying this. Try symmetric solutions: a=b=c=100. Then S2=3*10000=30000, S3=3*1,000,000=3,000,000. Then 300*30000 - 3,000,000 = 9,000,000 - 3,000,000=6,000,000, which satisfies the equation. So (100,100,100) is a solution. Now check if other solutions exist. Try to find all triples (a,b,c) with sum 300 satisfying 300*(a^2+b^2+c^2) - (a^3+b^3+c^3) = 6,000,000. Since the problem is symmetric, consider a ≤ b ≤ c. Also, the given is a cubic equation in a,b,c, but with sum fixed. Try to find other integer solutions by testing possible values. Alternatively, rewrite the expression in terms of symmetric sums. Note that a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc. We know a+b+c=300, so a^3+b^3+c^3 = 300^3 - 3*300*(ab+bc+ca) + 3abc = 27,000,000 - 900(ab+bc+ca) + 3abc. Similarly, a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = (a+b+c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca) = 90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ca). Substitute into the equation: 300*(90,000 - 2(ab+bc+ca)) - [27,000,000 - 900(ab+bc+ca) + 3abc] = 6,000,000. Simplify: 27,000,000 - 600(ab+bc+ca) - 27,000,000 + 900(ab+bc+ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000. This simplifies to 300(ab+bc+ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000. Divide both sides by 3: 100(ab+bc+ca) - abc = 2,000,000. So the condition reduces to 100(ab+bc+ca) - abc = 2,000,000 with a+b+c=300 and a,b,c≥0. We want integer triples (a,b,c) satisfying these. Now try to find integer solutions. Try c=0: then a+b=300, ab+bc+ca=ab, abc=0, so 100*ab - 0=2,000,000 =&gt; ab=20,000. But a+b=300, so ab=20,000. The quadratic equation for a is x^2 - 300x + 20,000=0. Discriminant = 300^2 - 4*20,000=90,000 - 80,000=10,000, sqrt=100. So roots are (300 ± 100)/2=200 or 100. So (a,b)=(100,200) or (200,100), c=0. So (100,200,0),(200,100,0) are solutions. Similarly for c=0. By symmetry, any permutation of (0,100,200) is a solution. So these are solutions. Now try c=100: then a+b=200. ab+bc+ca = ab + 100(a+b) = ab + 100*200 = ab + 20,000. abc = a*b*100 = 100ab. So 100(ab + 20,000) - 100ab = 100ab + 2,000,000 - 100ab = 2,000,000, which satisfies the equation for any a,b with a+b=200. So for c=100 and a+b=200, any (a,b) with sum 200 works. So infinite solutions? No, because a,b,c are nonnegative integers. So for c=100, any (a,b) with a+b=200 satisfies the condition. So all triples (a,b,100) with a,b≥0 and a+b=200 satisfy the condition. Number of such pairs is 201. Similarly for c=100, and permutations. So the solutions are all triples where one variable is 100 and the other two sum to 200. Similarly, check c=200: a+b=100. Then ab+bc+ca = ab + 200(a+b) = ab + 200*100=ab + 20,000. abc = a*b*200 = 200ab. The expression is 100(ab + 20,000) - 200ab = 100ab + 2,000,000 - 200ab = 2,000,000 - 100ab. For this to equal 2,000,000, we need 2,000,000 - 100ab = 2,000,000 =&gt; ab=0. So ab=0, meaning either a=0 or b=0. So triples are (0,100,200), (100,0,200), and permutations. Similarly for c=0, we had ab=20,000, which is not zero, so only c=200 with ab=0 works. So solutions are: 1) (100,100,100), 2) all triples with one variable 100 and the other two summing to 200, 3) triples with one variable 200 and the other two summing to 100 and one of them zero. Count the solutions: For case 1: (100,100,100) counts as 1 triple. For case 2: For variable c=100, a+b=200, number of pairs is 201. For each choice of which variable is 100, total 3*201=603 solutions. For case 3: c=200, a+b=100, ab=0 =&gt; a=0 or b=0, so pairs are (0,100) and (100,0), 2 pairs. For each choice of variable equal to 200, total 3*2=6 solutions. Total solutions = 1 + 603 + 6 = 610. Note that permutations are included because the problem asks for triples (a,b,c) with no ordering restriction. So final answer is 610.
