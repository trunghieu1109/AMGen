Question: Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations:
\[\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}\]\[\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}\]\[\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}\]
Then the value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: We are given three equations involving logarithms:

1) log2(x/(yz)) = 1/2
2) log2(y/(xz)) = 1/3
3) log2(z/(xy)) = 1/4

Let a = log2(x), b = log2(y), c = log2(z).

Rewrite each equation using properties of logarithms:

Equation 1: log2(x) - log2(y) - log2(z) = 1/2
=> a - b - c = 1/2

Equation 2: log2(y) - log2(x) - log2(z) = 1/3
=> b - a - c = 1/3

Equation 3: log2(z) - log2(x) - log2(y) = 1/4
=> c - a - b = 1/4

We have the system:

a - b - c = 1/2  (1)

b - a - c = 1/3  (2)

c - a - b = 1/4  (3)

Add all three equations:
(a - b - c) + (b - a - c) + (c - a - b) = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4

Left side:
a - b - c + b - a - c + c - a - b = (a - a - a) + (-b + b - b) + (-c - c + c) = -a - b - c

Right side:
1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 = (6/12 + 4/12 + 3/12) = 13/12

So:
-a - b - c = 13/12
=> a + b + c = -13/12

We want |log2(x^4 y^3 z^2)| = |4a + 3b + 2c|

From the three equations:
(1) a - b - c = 1/2
(2) b - a - c = 1/3
(3) c - a - b = 1/4

Add (1) and (2):
(a - b - c) + (b - a - c) = 1/2 + 1/3
=> (a - b - c + b - a - c) = 5/6
=> -2c = 5/6
=> c = -5/12

From (1): a - b - c = 1/2
=> a - b = 1/2 + c = 1/2 - 5/12 = 6/12 - 5/12 = 1/12

From (2): b - a - c = 1/3
=> b - a = 1/3 + c = 1/3 - 5/12 = 4/12 - 5/12 = -1/12

But from previous step, a - b = 1/12 => b - a = -1/12, consistent.

So a - b = 1/12

We also have a + b + c = -13/12
Substitute c = -5/12:
 a + b - 5/12 = -13/12
=> a + b = -13/12 + 5/12 = -8/12 = -2/3

We have two equations:
 a + b = -2/3
 a - b = 1/12

Add:
2a = -2/3 + 1/12 = (-8/12 + 1/12) = -7/12
=> a = -7/24

Subtract:
2b = -2/3 - 1/12 = (-8/12 - 1/12) = -9/12 = -3/4
=> b = -3/8

So:
 a = -7/24
 b = -3/8
 c = -5/12

Now compute 4a + 3b + 2c:
4a = 4 * (-7/24) = -28/24 = -7/6
3b = 3 * (-3/8) = -9/8
2c = 2 * (-5/12) = -10/12 = -5/6

Sum:
-7/6 - 9/8 - 5/6 = (-7/6 - 5/6) - 9/8 = (-12/6) - 9/8 = -2 - 9/8
Convert -2 to -16/8:
-16/8 - 9/8 = -25/8

Absolute value:
| -25/8 | = 25/8

m = 25, n = 8, relatively prime.
m + n = 25 + 8 = 33
