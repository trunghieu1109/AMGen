    <pre>Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.

Please think step by step and then solve the task.</pre>

    <pre>Let s be Aya&#39;s walking speed in km/h and t be the time spent in the coffee shop in minutes.

Given:
- Distance = 9 km
- Time at speed s = 4 hours (including t minutes in coffee shop)
- Time at speed s+2 = 2 hours 24 minutes = 2.4 hours (including t minutes in coffee shop)

We can write the total time as walking time + coffee shop time.

At speed s:
Total time = walking time + coffee shop time
4 hours = (9 / s) + (t / 60)

At speed s+2:
2.4 hours = (9 / (s + 2)) + (t / 60)

Subtract the two equations to eliminate t:
4 - 2.4 = 9/s - 9/(s + 2)
1.6 = 9(1/s - 1/(s + 2))
1.6 = 9((s + 2 - s) / (s(s + 2)))
1.6 = 9(2 / (s^2 + 2s))
1.6 = 18 / (s^2 + 2s)
Multiply both sides by (s^2 + 2s):
1.6(s^2 + 2s) = 18
s^2 + 2s = 18 / 1.6
s^2 + 2s = 11.25

Rewrite as quadratic:
s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0

Solve using quadratic formula:
s = [-2 ± sqrt(4 + 45)] / 2
s = [-2 ± sqrt(49)] / 2
s = [-2 ± 7] / 2

Two solutions:
s = (5)/2 = 2.5 or s = (-9)/2 = -4.5 (discard negative speed)

So s = 2.5 km/h

Find t:
From first equation:
4 = (9 / 2.5) + (t / 60)
4 = 3.6 + (t / 60)
(t / 60) = 0.4
t = 0.4 * 60 = 24 minutes

Now find the total time when speed is s + 0.5 = 3 km/h:
Total time = walking time + coffee time
= (9 / 3) + (24 / 60)
= 3 + 0.4
= 3.4 hours

Convert 3.4 hours to minutes:
3 hours + 0.4 * 60 minutes = 3 hours + 24 minutes = 204 minutes

Answer: 204 minutes
