Question: Alice chooses a set $A$ of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets $B$ of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of $B$ belongs to $A$. Bob's list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A.
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: Let A be the set chosen by Alice. Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers such that the maximum element of B is in A.

For each element a in A, consider the sets B where max(B) = a.

How many such sets B are there for a fixed a?

Since max(B) = a, B is a finite nonempty set of positive integers with maximum element a.

This means B is a subset of {1, 2, ..., a} that contains a.

The number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., a} is 2^a.

The number of subsets that contain a is 2^{a-1} (since we fix a in the subset, and the other elements can be chosen freely from {1, ..., a-1}).

Therefore, for each a in A, there are 2^{a-1} sets B with max(B) = a.

Bob lists all such sets for all a in A, so the total number of sets listed is:

sum_{a in A} 2^{a-1} = 2024.

We want to find sum of elements of A.

Let's write 2024 as a sum of powers of two of the form 2^{a-1}.

2024 in binary:

2024 / 2 = 1012 remainder 0
1012 / 2 = 506 remainder 0
506 / 2 = 253 remainder 0
253 / 2 = 126 remainder 1
126 / 2 = 63 remainder 0
63 / 2 = 31 remainder 1
31 / 2 = 15 remainder 1
15 / 2 = 7 remainder 1
7 / 2 = 3 remainder 1
3 / 2 = 1 remainder 1
1 / 2 = 0 remainder 1

So 2024 in binary is 111111001000.

Let's write it out:

Positions (from right to left, starting at 0):

bit 0: 0
bit 1: 0
bit 2: 0
bit 3: 1
bit 4: 0
bit 5: 0
bit 6: 1
bit 7: 1
bit 8: 1
bit 9: 1
bit 10: 1
bit 11: 1

So 2024 = 2^{11} + 2^{10} + 2^{9} + 2^{8} + 2^{7} + 2^{6} + 2^{3}.

We want to express 2024 as sum of 2^{a-1}, so the exponents correspond to a-1.

So the exponents are:
11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 3

Therefore, A = {12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 4}.

Sum of elements of A = 12 + 11 + 10 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 4 =

12 + 11 = 23
23 + 10 = 33
33 + 9 = 42
42 + 8 = 50
50 + 7 = 57
57 + 4 = 61
