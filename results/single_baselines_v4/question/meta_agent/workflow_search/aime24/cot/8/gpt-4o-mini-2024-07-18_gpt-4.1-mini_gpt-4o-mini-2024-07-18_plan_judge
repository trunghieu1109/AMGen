Question: Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: We are given a game with a stack of n tokens. Alice and Bob alternate turns, with Alice going first. On each turn, a player removes either 1 or 4 tokens. The player who removes the last token wins. We want to find the number of positive integers n ≤ 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy regardless of Alice's play. 

This is a classical combinatorial game problem where we analyze winning and losing positions. A position is losing if the player to move cannot force a win, and winning if the player to move can force a win.

Define a position by the number of tokens remaining. Let's denote by L the losing positions and by W the winning positions for the player about to move.

Base case:
- If there are 0 tokens, the player to move loses (no moves possible), so 0 is losing.

We analyze from 0 upwards:
- n=0: L (losing)
- n=1: Can remove 1 token and win immediately, so W
- n=2: Moves:
  - Remove 1 → n=1 (W)
  - Remove 4 → not possible
  Since all moves lead to W positions, n=2 is L
- n=3:
  - Remove 1 → n=2 (L)
  - Remove 4 → not possible
  There is a move to L, so n=3 is W
- n=4:
  - Remove 1 → n=3 (W)
  - Remove 4 → n=0 (L)
  There is a move to L, so n=4 is W
- n=5:
  - Remove 1 → n=4 (W)
  - Remove 4 → n=1 (W)
  All moves lead to W, so n=5 is L

We can see a pattern emerging:
Positions: 0(L), 1(W), 2(L), 3(W), 4(W), 5(L), ...

Check n=6:
- Remove 1 → n=5(L)
- Remove 4 → n=2(L)
At least one move to L, so n=6 is W

n=7:
- Remove 1 → n=6(W)
- Remove 4 → n=3(W)
All moves to W, so n=7 is L

So the losing positions so far are: 0, 2, 5, 7

Check n=8:
- Remove 1 → n=7(L)
- Remove 4 → n=4(W)
At least one move to L, so n=8 is W

n=9:
- Remove 1 → n=8(W)
- Remove 4 → n=5(L)
At least one move to L, so n=9 is W

n=10:
- Remove 1 → n=9(W)
- Remove 4 → n=6(W)
All moves to W, so n=10 is L

Losing positions: 0, 2, 5, 7, 10

Look at differences between losing positions:
2-0=2
5-2=3
7-5=2
10-7=3

Pattern of losing positions seems to be alternating +2, +3:
Start at 0, then +2=2, +3=5, +2=7, +3=10, +2=12, +3=15, +2=17, +3=20, ...

Check n=12:
- Remove 1 → n=11
- Remove 4 → n=8
We need to know n=11:

n=11:
- Remove 1 → n=10(L)
- Remove 4 → n=7(L)
At least one move to L, so n=11 is W

Back to n=12:
- Remove 1 → n=11(W)
- Remove 4 → n=8(W)
All moves to W, so n=12 is L

So 12 is losing, consistent with pattern.

Similarly, n=15:
- Remove 1 → n=14
- Remove 4 → n=11(W)
Check n=14:
- Remove 1 → n=13
- Remove 4 → n=10(L)
Check n=13:
- Remove 1 → n=12(L)
- Remove 4 → n=9(W)
Since n=13 has a move to L, n=13 is W
Back to n=14:
- Remove 1 → n=13(W)
- Remove 4 → n=10(L)
At least one move to L, n=14 is W
Back to n=15:
- Remove 1 → n=14(W)
- Remove 4 → n=11(W)
All moves to W, so n=15 is L

So the losing positions are:
0, 2, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, 17, 20, 22, ...

The losing positions form an arithmetic progression with pattern:
Starting from 0, add 2, then 3 alternately:
Losing positions: 0, 2, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, 17, 20, 22, ...

We want to find all positive losing positions ≤ 2024 (excluding 0 since n must be positive).

Let's separate the sequence into two subsequences:
Positions at even indexes (starting from index 0): 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, ... (starting at 0, adding 5)
Positions at odd indexes: 2, 7, 12, 17, 22, ... (starting at 2, adding 5)

So losing positions are all numbers congruent to 0 or 2 mod 5:
Check:
0 mod 5 = 0
2 mod 5 = 2
5 mod 5 = 0
7 mod 5 = 2
10 mod 5 = 0
12 mod 5 = 2
15 mod 5 = 0
17 mod 5 = 2
20 mod 5 = 0
22 mod 5 = 2

Therefore the losing positions are all n such that n mod 5 = 0 or 2.

Since Bob wants to win regardless of Alice's play, Bob must be the second player and the starting position must be losing for the first player (Alice). So Bob's winning positions are losing positions for Alice's first move, i.e., n mod 5 = 0 or 2.

We want to count positive integers n ≤ 2024 where n mod 5 = 0 or 2.

Count numbers ≤ 2024 that are 0 mod 5:
Largest multiple of 5 ≤ 2024 is 2020 (5*404)
Count: 404 numbers

Count numbers ≤ 2024 that are 2 mod 5:
Numbers of form 5k + 2 ≤ 2024
5k ≤ 2022
k ≤ 404.4
So k = 0 to 404 → 405 numbers

Total = 404 + 405 = 809
