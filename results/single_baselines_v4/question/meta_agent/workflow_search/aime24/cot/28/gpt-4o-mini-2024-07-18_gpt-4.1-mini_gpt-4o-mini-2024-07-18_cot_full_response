Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent pXCu', content="The torus T is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis in the plane of the circle at a distance 6 from the center of the circle. This means the torus has a major radius R = 6 and minor radius r = 3. The torus is described by points at a distance 3 from a circle of radius 6 centered on the axis of revolution. The sphere S has radius 11.\n\nWhen the torus rests on the outside of the sphere and is tangent externally, the torus touches the sphere along a circle. There are two such circles: one with radius r_i (inner tangent circle) and one with radius r_o (outer tangent circle). We want to find the difference r_i - r_o.\n\nStep 1: Understand the geometry.\n- The torus is centered on the z-axis, with the circle of radius 6 in the xy-plane.\n- The cross-section circle of radius 3 revolves around the z-axis at radius 6.\n\nStep 2: Parametrize the torus.\n- The torus is the set of points at distance 3 from the circle of radius 6 in the xy-plane.\n- The torus can be seen as points (x,y,z) such that (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6)^2 + z^2 = 3^2 = 9.\n\nStep 3: Sphere S has radius 11 and is centered at the origin.\n\nStep 4: When the torus rests on the outside of the sphere, the torus is tangent to the sphere externally along a circle. The circle of tangency lies on the torus and on the sphere.\n\nStep 5: The torus is symmetric about the z-axis. The circle of tangency will be a circle parallel to the xy-plane at some height z = h.\n\nStep 6: At height z = h, the cross-section of the torus is two circles in the xy-plane at radius r_c satisfying (r_c - 6)^2 + h^2 = 9.\n\nStep 7: The sphere of radius 11 has cross-section circles of radius sqrt(11^2 - h^2) = sqrt(121 - h^2) at height h.\n\nStep 8: For tangency along a circle, the radius of the cross-section circle of the torus equals the radius of the cross-section circle of the sphere, and the surfaces are tangent. This means the distance from the z-axis to the circle of tangency is the radius of the circle on the torus, and the sphere radius at that height matches.\n\nStep 9: The torus cross-section radius at height h is sqrt(9 - h^2), and the radius from the z-axis to the circle is 6 ± sqrt(9 - h^2).\n\nStep 10: The sphere cross-section radius is sqrt(121 - h^2).\n\nStep 11: For tangency, the distance from origin to the circle on the torus equals the sphere radius at that height:\n\n6 ± sqrt(9 - h^2) = sqrt(121 - h^2)\n\nStep 12: Solve for h^2 for both + and - cases.\n\nCase 1: 6 + sqrt(9 - h^2) = sqrt(121 - h^2)\n\nSquare both sides:\n(6 + sqrt(9 - h^2))^2 = 121 - h^2\n36 + 12 sqrt(9 - h^2) + (9 - h^2) = 121 - h^2\n36 + 12 sqrt(9 - h^2) + 9 - h^2 = 121 - h^2\n45 + 12 sqrt(9 - h^2) = 121\n12 sqrt(9 - h^2) = 76\nsqrt(9 - h^2) = 76/12 = 19/3\n\nBut sqrt(9 - h^2) <= 3, so 19/3 > 3 is impossible. No solution here.\n\nCase 2: 6 - sqrt(9 - h^2) = sqrt(121 - h^2)\n\nSquare both sides:\n(6 - sqrt(9 - h^2))^2 = 121 - h^2\n36 - 12 sqrt(9 - h^2) + (9 - h^2) = 121 - h^2\n45 - 12 sqrt(9 - h^2) = 121\n-12 sqrt(9 - h^2) = 76\nsqrt(9 - h^2) = -76/12 = -19/3\n\nAgain, sqrt is nonnegative, so no solution here.\n\nStep 13: Reconsider the approach: the torus points satisfy (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6)^2 + z^2 = 9.\n\nThe distance from origin to a point on the torus is r = sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2).\n\nFor a point on the torus, let s = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = radius in xy-plane.\n\nThen the torus equation is (s - 6)^2 + z^2 = 9.\n\nSo z^2 = 9 - (s - 6)^2.\n\nDistance from origin squared is s^2 + z^2 = s^2 + 9 - (s - 6)^2 = s^2 + 9 - (s^2 - 12s + 36) = s^2 + 9 - s^2 + 12s - 36 = 12s - 27.\n\nSo r^2 = 12s - 27.\n\nThe sphere has radius 11, so r = 11, r^2 = 121.\n\nSet 12s - 27 = 121 => 12s = 148 => s = 148/12 = 37/3 ≈ 12.333.\n\nStep 14: On the torus, the cross-section circle at s has radius sqrt(9 - (s - 6)^2).\n\nAt s = 37/3, (s - 6) = 37/3 - 18/3 = 19/3 ≈ 6.333.\n\n(19/3)^2 = 361/9 = 40.111.\n\nThen 9 - 40.111 = negative, no real z. So no point on the torus at s=37/3.\n\nStep 15: The previous calculation indicates an error. Let's try a different approach.\n\nStep 16: The distance from origin squared r^2 = s^2 + z^2.\n\nFrom torus equation: z^2 = 9 - (s - 6)^2.\n\nSo r^2 = s^2 + 9 - (s - 6)^2 = s^2 + 9 - (s^2 - 12s + 36) = s^2 + 9 - s^2 + 12s - 36 = 12s - 27.\n\nFor r = 11, r^2 = 121.\n\nSo 12s - 27 = 121 => 12s = 148 => s = 37/3.\n\nBut then (s - 6)^2 = (37/3 - 18/3)^2 = (19/3)^2 = 361/9 = 40.111.\n\nThen z^2 = 9 - 40.111 = -31.111, no real z.\n\nNo point on the torus at s = 37/3.\n\nStep 17: The error is assuming that the torus surface points have distance r to the origin equal to 11. But the torus is a ring, so the minimal and maximal distances from origin to torus points are:\n\nMinimal distance: R - r = 6 - 3 = 3\nMaximal distance: R + r = 6 + 3 = 9\n\nSo the torus lies between radii 3 and 9 from the origin.\n\nThe sphere has radius 11, which is larger than 9.\n\nStep 18: The torus resting on the outside of the sphere means the sphere is inside the hole of the torus or touching the torus from inside.\n\nStep 19: The torus is tangent to the sphere along a circle. The circle lies on the torus at a fixed height z = h.\n\nAt height h, the torus cross-section circle has radius sqrt(9 - h^2) and center at radius 6 in xy-plane.\n\nThe sphere cross-section at height h has radius sqrt(121 - h^2).\n\nThe circle of tangency lies on both surfaces, so the distance from the z-axis to the circle of tangency is r_c, and the sphere radius at height h is sqrt(121 - h^2).\n\nThe torus circle centers are at radius 6, with radius sqrt(9 - h^2).\n\nSo the circles of tangency are at radius r_c = 6 ± sqrt(9 - h^2).\n\nStep 20: The circle of tangency must lie on the sphere surface, so:\n\nr_c^2 + h^2 = 121\n\nSubstitute r_c = 6 ± sqrt(9 - h^2):\n\n(6 ± sqrt(9 - h^2))^2 + h^2 = 121\n\nExpand:\n\n36 ± 12 sqrt(9 - h^2) + (9 - h^2) + h^2 = 121\n\nSimplify h^2 terms:\n\n36 ± 12 sqrt(9 - h^2) + 9 = 121\n\n45 ± 12 sqrt(9 - h^2) = 121\n\nThen:\n\n± 12 sqrt(9 - h^2) = 76\n\nSo:\n\nCase +: 12 sqrt(9 - h^2) = 76 => sqrt(9 - h^2) = 76/12 = 19/3 > 3 (impossible)\n\nCase -: -12 sqrt(9 - h^2) = 76 => sqrt(9 - h^2) = -76/12 = -19/3 (impossible)\n\nStep 21: No solution for tangency at some height h.\n\nStep 22: Reconsider the problem statement: It says the torus is tangent to the sphere along a circle with radius r_i and r_o, and the difference r_i - r_o is asked.\n\nStep 23: Perhaps the circle of tangency radius refers to the radius of the circle on the torus, i.e., the radius of the circle in the cross-section of the torus at the height of tangency.\n\nStep 24: The torus is tangent to the sphere along a circle. The circle lies on the torus, so its radius is sqrt(9 - h^2).\n\nThe circle lies on the sphere, so the distance from origin to the circle center is r_c = 6 ± sqrt(9 - h^2).\n\nThe sphere radius is 11.\n\nThe distance from origin to any point on the circle is 11 (on the sphere).\n\nThe circle lies at height h, so the distance from origin to the circle is sqrt(r_c^2 + h^2) = 11.\n\nTherefore:\n\nr_c^2 + h^2 = 121\n\nBut r_c = 6 ± sqrt(9 - h^2)\n\nSo:\n\n(6 ± sqrt(9 - h^2))^2 + h^2 = 121\n\nWe already tried this and found no solution.\n\nStep 25: Check if the torus can be tangent internally or externally.\n\nStep 26: The problem states the torus is externally tangent to the sphere along two circles with radii r_i and r_o.\n\nStep 27: The two circles correspond to the inner and outer edges of the torus cross-section circle.\n\nStep 28: The circle radii on the torus cross-section are sqrt(9 - h^2).\n\nThe circle centers are at radius 6.\n\nThe radii of the two circles on the torus cross-section are:\n\nInner circle radius: 6 - sqrt(9 - h^2)\nOuter circle radius: 6 + sqrt(9 - h^2)\n\nStep 29: The sphere radius at height h is sqrt(121 - h^2).\n\nStep 30: For tangency, the sphere radius equals the radius of the circle of tangency on the torus:\n\nr_i = 6 - sqrt(9 - h^2)\n\nr_o = 6 + sqrt(9 - h^2)\n\nAnd the distance from origin to the circle is sqrt(r_i^2 + h^2) = sqrt(r_o^2 + h^2) = 11.\n\nStep 31: Use the distance condition for r_i:\n\nr_i^2 + h^2 = 121\n\nSubstitute r_i = 6 - sqrt(9 - h^2):\n\n(6 - sqrt(9 - h^2))^2 + h^2 = 121\n\nExpand:\n\n36 - 12 sqrt(9 - h^2) + 9 - h^2 + h^2 = 121\n\nSimplify:\n\n45 - 12 sqrt(9 - h^2) = 121\n\n-12 sqrt(9 - h^2) = 76\n\nsqrt(9 - h^2) = -76/12 = -19/3 (impossible)\n\nStep 32: Use the distance condition for r_o:\n\nr_o^2 + h^2 = 121\n\nSubstitute r_o = 6 + sqrt(9 - h^2):\n\n(6 + sqrt(9 - h^2))^2 + h^2 = 121\n\nExpand:\n\n36 + 12 sqrt(9 - h^2) + 9 - h^2 + h^2 = 121\n\nSimplify:\n\n45 + 12 sqrt(9 - h^2) = 121\n\n12 sqrt(9 - h^2) = 76\n\nsqrt(9 - h^2) = 76/12 = 19/3 > 3 (impossible)\n\nStep 33: No solution for tangency along a circle at height h.\n\nStep 34: The problem states: When T rests on the outside of S, it is tangent along a circle with radius r_i, and when T rests on the outside of S, it is tangent along a circle with radius r_o.\n\nPossibly a typo: one is when T rests on the inside of S, and one when T rests on the outside.\n\nAssuming one is internal tangency and the other external.\n\nStep 35: Try to solve for the distance from the origin to the center of the circle of the torus cross-section.\n\nThe torus is the set of points satisfying (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6)^2 + z^2 = 9.\n\nThe center of the cross-section circle at height z is at radius 6 in xy-plane, height z.\n\nThe circle radius is sqrt(9 - z^2).\n\nStep 36: The sphere center is at origin, radius 11.\n\nStep 37: The distance from the origin to the center of the torus cross-section circle is 6.\n\nStep 38: For the torus to be tangent to the sphere externally along a circle, the distance from the origin to the circle center plus or minus the circle radius equals the sphere radius.\n\nSo:\n\n6 ± sqrt(9 - z^2) = 11\n\nStep 39: Solve for z in both cases:\n\nCase 1: 6 + sqrt(9 - z^2) = 11\n\nsqrt(9 - z^2) = 5\n\nSquare both sides:\n9 - z^2 = 25\n\nz^2 = 9 - 25 = -16 (no real solution)\n\nCase 2: 6 - sqrt(9 - z^2) = 11\n\nsqrt(9 - z^2) = -5 (no real solution)\n\nStep 40: No real solution for tangency at radius 11.\n\nStep 41: Try the other possibility: the sphere radius is less than the torus radius range.\n\nStep 42: The problem states the sphere radius is 11, torus major radius 6, minor radius 3.\n\nStep 43: The torus lies between radius 3 and 9 from origin.\n\nThe sphere radius is 11, which is larger than 9.\n\nStep 44: The torus can be tangent to the sphere from inside or outside, with the circle of tangency radius r_i and r_o.\n\nStep 45: The two circles of tangency correspond to the two distances from origin to the torus cross-section circle center ± circle radius equal to sphere radius ± minor radius.\n\nStep 46: The difference r_i - r_o is the difference between the radii of the circles of tangency on the torus.\n\nStep 47: The radii of the two circles on the torus cross-section are sqrt(9 - h^2).\n\nStep 48: The circle radii on the torus are sqrt(9 - h^2), but the circle radii of tangency on the sphere are related to the sphere radius and height h.\n\nStep 49: The difference r_i - r_o = (6 - sqrt(9 - h^2)) - (6 + sqrt(9 - h^2)) = -2 sqrt(9 - h^2).\n\nStep 50: The difference is negative; take absolute value:\n\nr_i - r_o = 2 sqrt(9 - h^2).\n\nStep 51: From the sphere radius:\n\nr_c^2 + h^2 = 121\n\nWhere r_c = 6 ± sqrt(9 - h^2)\n\nStep 52: For the inner circle:\n\n(6 - sqrt(9 - h^2))^2 + h^2 = 121\n\nExpand:\n\n36 - 12 sqrt(9 - h^2) + 9 - h^2 + h^2 = 121\n\nSimplify:\n\n45 - 12 sqrt(9 - h^2) = 121\n\n-12 sqrt(9 - h^2) = 76\n\nsqrt(9 - h^2) = -76/12 = -19/3 (no real solution)\n\nStep 53: For the outer circle:\n\n(6 + sqrt(9 - h^2))^2 + h^2 = 121\n\nExpand:\n\n36 + 12 sqrt(9 - h^2) + 9 - h^2 + h^2 = 121\n\nSimplify:\n\n45 + 12 sqrt(9 - h^2) = 121\n\n12 sqrt(9 - h^2) = 76\n\nsqrt(9 - h^2) = 19/3 > 3 (no solution)\n\nStep 54: No real solutions for h.\n\nStep 55: Alternative approach: The distance from the origin to the center of the circle is d = 6.\n\nThe circle radius is r_c = 3 (minor radius).\n\nThe sphere radius is 11.\n\nWhen the torus rests on the outside of the sphere, the sphere touches the torus externally along a circle.\n\nThe sphere radius is larger than the torus outer radius (9), so the torus is outside the sphere.\n\nStep 56: The circle of tangency lies on the torus at radius d ± r_c.\n\nThe sphere radius is 11.\n\nThe difference between the two circle radii is 2 r_c = 6.\n\nStep 57: The problem asks for r_i - r_o in simplest fraction form.\n\nSince the difference is 6, the answer is 6 = 6/1.\n\nTherefore, m = 6, n = 1, and m + n = 7.\n\nAnswer:7", prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
