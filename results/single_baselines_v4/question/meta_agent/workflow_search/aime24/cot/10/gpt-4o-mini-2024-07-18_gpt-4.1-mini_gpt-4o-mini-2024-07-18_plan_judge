Question: Rectangles $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are drawn such that $D,E,C,F$ are collinear. Also, $A,D,H,G$ all lie on a circle. If $BC=16$,$AB=107$,$FG=17$, and $EF=184$, what is the length of $CE$?
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: Let's analyze the problem step-by-step.

1. We have two rectangles ABCD and EFGH.
2. Points D, E, C, F are collinear.
3. Points A, D, H, G lie on a circle.
4. Given lengths: BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, EF = 184.

Since ABCD is a rectangle, AB is perpendicular to BC, and opposite sides are equal, so:
- AB = DC = 107
- BC = AD = 16

Similarly, for rectangle EFGH:
- EF = GH = 184
- FG = EH = 17

Given D, E, C, F are collinear.

Let's place rectangle ABCD on a coordinate plane for clarity:
- Let A = (0,0)
- B = (107,0) since AB=107
- C = (107,16) since BC=16
- D = (0,16)

Now, rectangle EFGH also has points E, F, G, H.
- Since D, E, C, F are collinear, and D = (0,16), C = (107,16), the line through D and C is y=16.
- So points E and F lie on y=16.

Let E = (x_E,16), F = (x_F,16)

Since EF = 184, the distance between E and F is 184:
|x_F - x_E| = 184

Similarly, FG = 17.

Rectangle EFGH has sides EF and FG perpendicular.
- EF is horizontal (since E and F have same y=16), so FG is vertical.

Therefore:
- E = (x_E,16)
- F = (x_F,16)
- G = (x_F,16 - 17) or (x_F,16 + 17)
- H = (x_E,16 - 17) or (x_E,16 + 17)

Since A, D, H, G are concyclic:
- A = (0,0)
- D = (0,16)
- H = (x_E,16 ± 17)
- G = (x_F,16 ± 17)

We need to find x_E and x_F such that these points lie on a circle.

Since |x_F - x_E|=184, set x_F = x_E + 184.

H and G have y = 16 ± 17. Let's choose y = -1 (16 - 17) for H and G.

So:
- H = (x_E, -1)
- G = (x_E + 184, -1)

Check if A, D, H, G lie on a circle.

The four points are:
A(0,0), D(0,16), H(x_E,-1), G(x_E+184,-1)

The circle passing through A and D has center on the perpendicular bisector of AD.
- AD is vertical line segment from (0,0) to (0,16), midpoint M = (0,8)
- Perpendicular bisector is horizontal line y=8.

So center of circle is at (h,8).

Radius r = distance from center to A = sqrt((h-0)^2 + (8-0)^2) = sqrt(h^2 + 64)

Check if H lies on the circle:
Distance from center to H = sqrt((h - x_E)^2 + (8 + 1)^2) = sqrt((h - x_E)^2 + 81)

Set equal to r:
(h - x_E)^2 + 81 = h^2 + 64
(h - x_E)^2 - h^2 = -17

Expand:
(h^2 - 2hx_E + x_E^2) - h^2 = -17
-2hx_E + x_E^2 = -17

Similarly for G:
Distance from center to G = sqrt((h - (x_E + 184))^2 + 81)
Set equal to r:
(h - (x_E + 184))^2 + 81 = h^2 + 64
(h - x_E - 184)^2 - h^2 = -17

Expand:
(h^2 - 2h(x_E + 184) + (x_E + 184)^2) - h^2 = -17
-2h(x_E + 184) + (x_E + 184)^2 = -17

Now we have two equations:
1) -2hx_E + x_E^2 = -17
2) -2h(x_E + 184) + (x_E + 184)^2 = -17

Subtract equation 1 from 2:
[-2h(x_E + 184) + (x_E + 184)^2] - [-2hx_E + x_E^2] = 0

-2hx_E - 368h + x_E^2 + 2*184*x_E + 184^2 + 2hx_E - x_E^2 = 0

Simplify:
-368h + 2*184*x_E + 184^2 = 0

Note that -2hx_E and +2hx_E cancel, and x_E^2 and -x_E^2 cancel.

So:
-368h + 368x_E + 184^2 = 0

Divide by 368:
-h + x_E + 184^2 / 368 = 0

Calculate 184^2 / 368:
184^2 = 33856
33856 / 368 = 92

So:
-h + x_E + 92 = 0
h = x_E + 92

Now plug h = x_E + 92 into equation 1:
-2(x_E + 92)x_E + x_E^2 = -17
-2x_E^2 - 184x_E + x_E^2 = -17

Simplify:
-x_E^2 - 184x_E = -17

Multiply both sides by -1:
x_E^2 + 184x_E = 17

Rewrite:
x_E^2 + 184x_E - 17 = 0

Solve quadratic for x_E:
Discriminant = 184^2 - 4*1*(-17) = 33856 + 68 = 33924

sqrt(33924) ≈ 184.2

x_E = [-184 ± 184.2] / 2

Two solutions:
1) (-184 + 184.2)/2 = 0.2/2 = 0.1
2) (-184 - 184.2)/2 = -368.2/2 = -184.1

x_E is likely positive and near zero, so take x_E = 0.1

Then h = x_E + 92 = 92.1

Now, E = (0.1,16), F = (0.1 + 184,16) = (184.1,16)

We want length CE:
C = (107,16)
E = (0.1,16)

Distance CE = |107 - 0.1| = 106.9 ≈ 107

Therefore, CE = 107.
