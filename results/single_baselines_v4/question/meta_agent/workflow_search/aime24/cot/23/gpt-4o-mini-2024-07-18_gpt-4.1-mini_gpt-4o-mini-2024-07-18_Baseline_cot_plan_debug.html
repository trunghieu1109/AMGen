    <pre>Let&#39;s denote the digits in the grid as:

| a | b | c |
| d | e | f |

The conditions are:
1. The sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right (top row and bottom row) is 999:
   (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999

2. The sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom (first column, second column, third column) is 99:
   (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99

From condition 1:
100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999
=&gt; 100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999

From condition 2:
(10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99
=&gt; 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99

Set:
X = a + d
Y = b + e
Z = c + f

From condition 1:
100X + 10Y + Z = 999

From condition 2:
10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99
But (a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = (a + d) + (b + e) + (c + f) = X + Y + Z
So let S = a + b + c
Then condition 2 becomes:
10S + (X + Y + Z - S) = 99
=&gt; 10S + X + Y + Z - S = 99
=&gt; 9S + X + Y + Z = 99

Recall from condition 1:
100X + 10Y + Z = 999

We have two equations:
1) 100X + 10Y + Z = 999
2) 9S + X + Y + Z = 99

From the first equation, express Z:
Z = 999 - 100X - 10Y

Substitute into second equation:
9S + X + Y + (999 - 100X - 10Y) = 99
=&gt; 9S + X + Y + 999 - 100X - 10Y = 99
=&gt; 9S + 999 - 99X - 9Y = 99
=&gt; 9S = 99 - 999 + 99X + 9Y
=&gt; 9S = -900 + 99X + 9Y
=&gt; S = (-900 + 99X + 9Y) / 9
=&gt; S = -100 + 11X + Y

Since a, b, c, d, e, f are digits (0 to 9), then:
- X = a + d is between 0 and 18
- Y = b + e is between 0 and 18
- Z = c + f is between 0 and 18
- S = a + b + c is between 0 and 27

Also, from Z = 999 - 100X - 10Y, Z must be between 0 and 18.
Try possible values of X and Y to satisfy 0 &lt;= Z &lt;= 18.

Check X from 0 to 9 (since a and d are digits 0-9, sum max 18 but 100X can quickly exceed 999):

For X=9:
Z = 999 - 900 - 10Y = 99 - 10Y
Z &gt;= 0 =&gt; 99 - 10Y &gt;= 0 =&gt; Y &lt;= 9
Z &lt;= 18 =&gt; 99 - 10Y &lt;= 18 =&gt; 10Y &gt;= 81 =&gt; Y &gt;= 9
So Y=9
Then Z=99 - 90 = 9

S = -100 + 11*9 + 9 = -100 + 99 + 9 = 8

S = a + b + c = 8
X = a + d = 9
Y = b + e = 9
Z = c + f = 9

Now we find all digits a,b,c,d,e,f (0-9) satisfying:
a + d = 9
b + e = 9
c + f = 9
a + b + c = 8

Enumerate a,b,c:
Since a,b,c are digits 0-9 and sum to 8.
For each triple (a,b,c) with sum 8, find d = 9 - a, e = 9 - b, f = 9 - c.
All must be digits 0-9, which they are because a,b,c &lt;= 8 (since sum 8) and 9 - a, etc., will be between 1 and 9.

Count the number of (a,b,c) with sum 8 and each between 0 and 9.
Number of non-negative integer solutions to a+b+c=8 is C(8+3-1,3-1) = C(10,2) = 45.

For each such triple, d,e,f are uniquely determined.

Thus, total number of ways is 45.

Check the example given:
The example is:
|0|0|8|
|9|9|1|

a=0,b=0,c=8,d=9,e=9,f=1
Sum a+b+c=8
Sum a+d=9
Sum b+e=9
Sum c+f=9
Conditions satisfied.

Therefore, the answer is 45.
