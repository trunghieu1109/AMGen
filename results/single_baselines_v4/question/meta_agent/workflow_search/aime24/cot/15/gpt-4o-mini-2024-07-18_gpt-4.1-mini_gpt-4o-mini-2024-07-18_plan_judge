Question: Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: Let's define the sets as follows: D = diamond ring owners, G = golf clubs owners, S = garden spade owners, C = candy hearts owners. We know: |D| = 195, |G| = 367, |S| = 562, |C| = 900 (since all own candy hearts). Total residents N = 900. Let x be the number of residents who own all four items. Given: 437 own exactly two items, 234 own exactly three items. We want to find x. 

We use the principle of inclusion-exclusion and the concept of exactly k items owned. 

Total number of residents owning exactly one item + exactly two items + exactly three items + exactly four items = total residents = 900.

Let E1 = number owning exactly one item, E2 = number owning exactly two items = 437, E3 = number owning exactly three items = 234, E4 = number owning exactly four items = x.

So, E1 + 437 + 234 + x = 900 => E1 + x = 900 - 437 - 234 = 229.

Sum of sizes of all sets = |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| = 195 + 367 + 562 + 900 = 2024.

Sum counts each owner as many times as they own items. So, sum of items owned by all residents = 2024.

But we can also express sum of items owned as:
E1 * 1 + E2 * 2 + E3 * 3 + E4 * 4 = 2024.

Substitute E2 = 437, E3 = 234, E4 = x:
E1 + 2*437 + 3*234 + 4*x = 2024
E1 + 874 + 702 + 4x = 2024
E1 + 4x = 2024 - 874 - 702 = 2024 - 1576 = 448.

From earlier, E1 + x = 229.

Subtracting the two equations:
(E1 + 4x) - (E1 + x) = 448 - 229
3x = 219
x = 219 / 3 = 73.

Therefore, the number of residents owning all four items is 73.
