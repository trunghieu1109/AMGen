    <pre>Let&#39;s define the sets as follows: D = diamond ring owners, G = golf clubs owners, S = garden spade owners, C = candy hearts owners. We know: |D| = 195, |G| = 367, |S| = 562, |C| = 900 (since all own candy hearts). Total residents N = 900. Let x be the number of residents who own all four items. Given: 437 own exactly two items, 234 own exactly three items. We want to find x. 

We use the principle of inclusion-exclusion and the concept of exactly k items owned. 

Total number of residents owning exactly one item + exactly two items + exactly three items + exactly four items = total residents = 900.

Let E1 = number owning exactly one item, E2 = number owning exactly two items = 437, E3 = number owning exactly three items = 234, E4 = number owning exactly four items = x.

So, E1 + 437 + 234 + x = 900 =&gt; E1 + x = 900 - 437 - 234 = 229.

Sum of sizes of all sets = |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| = 195 + 367 + 562 + 900 = 2024.

Sum counts each owner as many times as they own items. So, sum of items owned by all residents = 2024.

But we can also express sum of items owned as:
E1 * 1 + E2 * 2 + E3 * 3 + E4 * 4 = 2024.

Substitute E2 = 437, E3 = 234, E4 = x:
E1 + 2*437 + 3*234 + 4*x = 2024
E1 + 874 + 702 + 4x = 2024
E1 + 4x = 2024 - 874 - 702 = 2024 - 1576 = 448.

From earlier, E1 + x = 229.

Subtracting the two equations:
(E1 + 4x) - (E1 + x) = 448 - 229
3x = 219
x = 219 / 3 = 73.

Therefore, the number of residents owning all four items is 73.
