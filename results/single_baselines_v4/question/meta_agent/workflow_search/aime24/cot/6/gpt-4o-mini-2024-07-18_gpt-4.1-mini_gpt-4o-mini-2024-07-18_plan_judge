Question: Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: Let the dimensions of the rectangular box be x, y, z. We have two conditions:
1) Surface area: 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 => xy + yz + zx = 27
2) Volume: xyz = 23

We want to find the smallest sphere radius r that can contain the box. The smallest sphere that contains the box must contain its diagonal. The diagonal length d of the box is d = sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2).

The radius r of the smallest sphere containing the box is half the diagonal: r = d/2.

We want to minimize r^2 = (d/2)^2 = d^2/4 = (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)/4.

So, we need to find the minimum possible value of x^2 + y^2 + z^2 given the constraints:
- xy + yz + zx = 27
- xyz = 23

We use the identity:
(x + y + z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + zx)
=> x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x + y + z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx)
= (x + y + z)^2 - 54

So minimizing x^2 + y^2 + z^2 is equivalent to minimizing (x + y + z)^2.

Let s = x + y + z.

We know:
- xy + yz + zx = 27
- xyz = 23

The triple (x, y, z) are positive real numbers (since volume and surface area are positive).

We want to minimize s^2 = (x + y + z)^2.

Using the cubic polynomial with roots x, y, z:
 t^3 - s t^2 + 27 t - 23 = 0

We want to find the minimal s such that this cubic has positive roots x, y, z.

Since the roots are positive, by AM-GM inequality:
(s/3)^3 >= xyz = 23
=> s^3/27 >= 23
=> s^3 >= 621
=> s >= cube_root(621) ~ 8.54

So s_min >= cube_root(621).

We check if s = cube_root(621) satisfies the conditions.

We can use Lagrange multipliers or symmetry. Since the volume and sum of pairwise products are fixed, the minimal sum of squares (or sum) for fixed xyz and xy+yz+zx is when two variables are equal.

Try y = z.

Then:
xy + yz + zx = xy + y^2 + x y = y(x + y + x) = y(2x + y) = 27
xyz = x y^2 = 23

From xyz=23, x = 23 / y^2

Plug into xy + yz + zx = 27:
xy + yz + zx = x y + y z + z x
Since y = z, this is x y + y^2 + x y = 2 x y + y^2 = 27
Substitute x = 23 / y^2:
2 * (23 / y^2) * y + y^2 = 27
=> 2 * 23 / y + y^2 = 27
=> 46 / y + y^2 = 27
Multiply both sides by y:
46 + y^3 = 27 y
=> y^3 - 27 y + 46 = 0

We solve y^3 - 27 y + 46 = 0.
Try rational roots: factors of 46 are ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46.
Try y=1: 1 - 27 + 46 = 20 (not zero)
Try y=2: 8 - 54 + 46 = 0 (yes)

So y=2 is a root.

Then x = 23 / y^2 = 23 / 4 = 5.75

So dimensions are (x, y, z) = (5.75, 2, 2)

Sum s = x + y + z = 5.75 + 2 + 2 = 9.75

Calculate x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 5.75^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 = 33.0625 + 4 + 4 = 41.0625

Recall r^2 = (x^2 + y^2 + z^2) / 4 = 41.0625 / 4 = 10.265625

Convert 10.265625 to fraction:
10 + 0.265625
0.265625 = 17/64 (since 0.265625 * 64 = 17)

So r^2 = 10 + 17/64 = (640 + 17)/64 = 657/64

p = 657, q = 64, gcd(657,64) = 1 (since 64 is power of 2, 657 is odd, so relatively prime)

p + q = 657 + 64 = 721
