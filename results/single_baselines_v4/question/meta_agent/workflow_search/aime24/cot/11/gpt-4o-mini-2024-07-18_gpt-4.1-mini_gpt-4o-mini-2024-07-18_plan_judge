Question: Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.

proposed answer: We want to count the number of paths from the lower-left corner to the upper-right corner of an 8x8 grid, moving only right or up, with exactly 4 direction changes. Each path consists of 16 steps (8 rights and 8 ups). A direction change occurs when the path switches from moving right to moving up, or vice versa. The path can be viewed as a sequence of segments, each segment consisting of moves in one direction only. Since there are 4 direction changes, there will be 5 segments (because the number of segments is the number of direction changes + 1). The path starts either moving right or moving up, but since the start is at the lower-left corner and the end at the upper-right corner, the path must have equal numbers of right and up moves (8 each). The segments alternate directions: for example, if the path starts moving right, then the segments are in order: right, up, right, up, right (5 segments). Similarly, if the path starts moving up, the segments are: up, right, up, right, up. We need to find the number of ways to partition the 8 right moves into the right-moving segments and the 8 up moves into the up-moving segments. There are 3 right-moving segments and 2 up-moving segments if the path starts right (or vice versa if it starts up). Each segment must have at least 1 move because a segment of length 0 would mean no move in that direction at that segment, which would reduce the number of direction changes. So, the problem reduces to counting the number of positive integer solutions to: For start right: r1 + r2 + r3 = 8 (r_i >= 1) and u1 + u2 = 8 (u_i >= 1). For start up: u1 + u2 + u3 = 8 (u_i >= 1) and r1 + r2 = 8 (r_i >= 1). The number of positive integer solutions to x1 + x2 + ... + xk = n is C(n-1, k-1). For start right: number of ways = C(8-1,3-1) * C(8-1,2-1) = C(7,2)*C(7,1) = 21*7=147. For start up: number of ways = C(7,2)*C(7,1) = 147. Total number of paths = 147 + 147 = 294.
