    <pre>Step 1: The starting compound is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Treating with sodium hydride (a strong base) deprotonates the hydroxyl group, forming an alkoxide. Then benzyl bromide reacts with the alkoxide, forming a benzyl ether at the 3-hydroxymethyl position. This corresponds to product 1: (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene (choice 3). Step 2: Product 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide in acidic conditions, which converts the ketone at position 1 into a tosyl hydrazone, forming product 2. Step 3: Product 2 is treated with n-butyllithium at low temperature, which deprotonates the tosyl hydrazone, leading to a carbanion intermediate. Subsequent aqueous ammonium chloride treatment hydrolyzes to give the corresponding alkane at position 1, replacing the ketone with a butyl group. Step 4: Product 3 is then hydrogenated over Pd/C, which removes the benzyl protecting group (benzyl ether), converting it back to a hydroxyl group at the 3-position. Therefore, product 4 has a free hydroxymethyl group at position 3, a butyl group at position 1, and an isopropyl group at position 5. Hence, product 4 is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexane, which matches choice 4 with the hydroxyl group at position 1 and the benzyloxy group removed, so the benzyl ether is converted to an alcohol. Thus, choice 4: &#39;3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol&#39; is the correct structure for product 4 after hydrogenation (the benzyloxy group should be converted to hydroxy, so the name is slightly off but closest). None of the other choices fit the sequence correctly.
