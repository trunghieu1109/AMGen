Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent mPTt', content="The question asks about the most common sources of difficult-to-spot erroneous results in genomics data analysis. The options given are mutually incompatible data formats, the 'chr' / 'no chr' confusion, reference assembly mismatch, and incorrect ID conversion. All these issues can cause errors, but mutually incompatible data formats are often immediately noticeable and less likely to be 'difficult-to-spot'. The 'chr' / 'no chr' confusion, reference assembly mismatch, and incorrect ID conversion are subtle issues that can easily lead to unnoticed errors. Therefore, the best choice is the one that includes these three issues but excludes mutually incompatible data formats.\n\nAnswer:D)", prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
