Question: Example(question='A chemist performs two reactions:\n\nReaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. \n\nReaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.\n\nBoth reactions go to 100% completion. The chemist combines the products of both reactions, and then runs the product mixture on both a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column and a chiral HPLC column.\n\nAssuming that the chromatographic resolution is as high as theoretically possible in both cases, what does the chemist observe in each of these chromatograms?', choice1='4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', choice2='3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice3='2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice4='2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: The reaction of an alkene with mCPBA forms an epoxide. The stereochemistry of the starting alkene influences the stereochemistry of the epoxide product. For (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxidation will give a trans-epoxide, which is achiral or meso. For (Z)-oct-4-ene, the epoxidation will give a cis-epoxide, which is chiral and exists as a pair of enantiomers. Thus, from (E)-oct-4-ene, one product (a meso compound) is formed, and from (Z)-oct-4-ene, two enantiomers are formed. When combined, the mixture contains three different compounds: one meso epoxide and two enantiomers of the cis epoxide. On a standard (achiral) HPLC, enantiomers co-elute, so only two peaks are observed: one for the meso compound and one for the pair of enantiomers. On a chiral HPLC, the enantiomers are separated, so three peaks are observed: one for the meso compound and two for the enantiomers. Therefore, the chemist observes 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC.
