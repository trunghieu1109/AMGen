    <pre>The question asks how many of the listed stars would be detectable using the ESPRESSO spectrograph with the VLT, given the criteria of achieving a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. The stars listed include bright stars like Canopus and Polaris, and stars at various distances but with an absolute V magnitude of 15. Since ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph on an 8m telescope, it can detect relatively faint stars. Generally, stars with apparent magnitudes up to around 16-17 can be detectable with sufficient S/N in 1 hour exposure with ESPRESSO on an 8m telescope. 

Let&#39;s analyze each star:
- Canopus: Very bright star, easily detectable.
- Polaris: Also very bright, easily detectable.
- Star with absolute V magnitude 15 at 10 pc: Apparent magnitude = 15 (since distance modulus at 10 pc is zero), so V=15, likely detectable.
- Star with absolute V magnitude 15 at 200 pc: Apparent magnitude = 15 + 5*log10(200/10) = 15 + 5*log10(20) = 15 + 5*1.3010 = 15 + 6.505 = 21.505, which is too faint to detect with S/N=10 in 1 hour.
- Star with absolute V magnitude 15 at 5 pc: Apparent magnitude = 15 + 5*log10(5/10) = 15 + 5*(-0.3010) = 15 - 1.505 = 13.495, brighter than 15, so detectable.
- Star with absolute V magnitude 15 at 50 pc: Apparent magnitude = 15 + 5*log10(50/10) = 15 + 5*log10(5) = 15 + 5*0.6990 = 15 + 3.495 = 18.495, which is likely too faint for S/N=10 in 1 hour.

Thus, detectable stars are Canopus, Polaris, star at 5 pc, and star at 10 pc. That makes 4 stars detectable.

Therefore, the answer is 4.
