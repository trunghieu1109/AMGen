Question: Example(question='Very large number of neutrinos produced by the Sun reach the Earth (very large flux of neutrinos, defined as the number of neutrinos per cm^2, per second).\n\nLet us assume that, hypothetically, the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the core of the Sun about 8 and a half minutes ago, while all other reactions remained as they were.\n\nWhat would be the approximate ratio of the flux between two bands of neutrino energies of 700-800 KeV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). \n\nFlux (band 1) / flux (band 2) is:\n\n(Note: we are talking about stopping the pp-III branch, not pp-II, pp-I or any other. Itâ€™s not a typo or something like that.)\n(Note 2: solar neutrino flavor changes happen, but do not play a role here.)', choice1='0.1 (10^-1).', choice2='10.', choice3='1.', choice4='0.01 (10^-2).', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The pp-III branch of the proton-proton chain in the Sun produces neutrinos with energies typically above 800 keV, specifically the high-energy neutrinos from the decay of 8B (Boron-8). If the pp-III branch suddenly stopped, the flux of neutrinos in the 800-900 keV energy band (band 2) would drop significantly because these neutrinos come predominantly from the pp-III branch. Meanwhile, the 700-800 keV band (band 1) neutrinos are mainly produced by other branches (pp-I and pp-II) and would remain mostly unchanged. Therefore, the ratio Flux(band 1)/Flux(band 2) would increase significantly because the denominator (band 2 flux) would decrease drastically. Since band 2 flux would nearly vanish, the ratio would become very large, on the order of 10 or more. Among the given options, 10 is the best estimate for the ratio after the pp-III branch stops.
