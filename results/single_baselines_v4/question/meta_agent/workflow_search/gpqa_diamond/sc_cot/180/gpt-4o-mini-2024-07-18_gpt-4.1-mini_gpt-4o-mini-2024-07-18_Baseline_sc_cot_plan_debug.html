    <pre>The pp-III branch of the proton-proton chain in the Sun produces neutrinos with energies typically above 800 keV, specifically the high-energy neutrinos from the decay of 8B (Boron-8). If the pp-III branch suddenly stopped, the flux of neutrinos in the 800-900 keV energy band (band 2) would drop significantly because these neutrinos come predominantly from the pp-III branch. Meanwhile, the 700-800 keV band (band 1) neutrinos are mainly produced by other branches (pp-I and pp-II) and would remain mostly unchanged. Therefore, the ratio Flux(band 1)/Flux(band 2) would increase significantly because the denominator (band 2 flux) would decrease drastically. Since band 2 flux would nearly vanish, the ratio would become very large, on the order of 10 or more. Among the given options, 10 is the best estimate for the ratio after the pp-III branch stops.
