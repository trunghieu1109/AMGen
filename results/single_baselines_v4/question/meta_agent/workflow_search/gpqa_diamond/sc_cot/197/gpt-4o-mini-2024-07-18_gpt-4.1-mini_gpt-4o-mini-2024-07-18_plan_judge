Question: Example(question='We have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate, where the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M and the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16. What will be the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species in the solution?

proposed answer: Given: c(Co) = 10^-2 M, [SCN-] = 0.1 M, and the stability constants β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16 for the stepwise formation of Co(SCN)n complexes. We want the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, i.e., Co(SCN)2. The overall stability constants are cumulative: β1 = 9, β2 = 40, β3 = 63, β4 = 16. Normally, βn = K1 * K2 * ... * Kn. But here β2 < β3 and β4 is smallest, which is unusual. Assuming these are stepwise constants, let's consider the species: Co2+, Co(SCN)+, Co(SCN)2, Co(SCN)3, Co(SCN)4. Using β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16 as cumulative constants, the concentrations of species are proportional to: [Co2+] = 1, [Co(SCN)+] = β1*[SCN-] = 9*0.1=0.9, [Co(SCN)2] = β2*[SCN-]^2=40*(0.1)^2=40*0.01=0.4, [Co(SCN)3] = β3*[SCN-]^3=63*(0.001)=0.063, [Co(SCN)4] = β4*[SCN-]^4=16*(0.0001)=0.0016. Sum = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646. Percentage of Co(SCN)2 = (0.4 / 2.3646)*100% ≈ 16.9%. So the answer is 16.9%.
