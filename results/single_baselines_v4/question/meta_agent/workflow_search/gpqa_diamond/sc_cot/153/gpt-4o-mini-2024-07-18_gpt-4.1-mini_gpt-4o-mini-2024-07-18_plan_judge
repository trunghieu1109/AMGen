Question: Example(question='In the lab, a chemist discovers an unnamed bottle with a white solid inside. He gathers the following spectral information in order to identify the liquid. Make a reasonable structural suggestion for the unidentified drug using the information provided.\nMass: molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 (100%)\na peak at m/z = 158 (32%)\nIR : broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1, strong sharp peak at 1720 cm-1\n1H NMR: 11.0 ppm (s, 1H), 8.02 ppm (d, 2H), 7.72 (d, 2H)', choice1='4-chlorobenzoic acid', choice2='2-chlorobenzoic acid', choice3='3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde\n', choice4='Phenyl chloroformate', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: The molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 suggests the molecular weight of the compound is 156. The peak at m/z = 158 (32%) indicates the presence of chlorine, due to the isotope pattern of Cl-35 and Cl-37. The IR spectrum shows a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1, which is characteristic of an O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid, and a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1, typical of a C=O stretch in a carboxylic acid. The 1H NMR spectrum shows a singlet at 11.0 ppm (1H), which corresponds to the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid. The aromatic protons appear as two doublets at 8.02 ppm (2H) and 7.72 ppm (2H), indicating a para-substituted benzene ring. Among the choices, 4-chlorobenzoic acid fits all these data: molecular weight around 156, chlorine substitution, carboxylic acid functional group, and para-substitution pattern giving two doublets in the aromatic region. The other choices either do not fit the molecular weight, substitution pattern, or functional groups indicated by the IR and NMR data.
