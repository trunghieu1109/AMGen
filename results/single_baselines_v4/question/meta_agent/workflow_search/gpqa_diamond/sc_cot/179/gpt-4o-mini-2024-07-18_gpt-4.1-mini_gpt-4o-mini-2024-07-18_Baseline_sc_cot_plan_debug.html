    <pre>There are 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e, with 12 constrained to be 2 m from point P, and the 13th fixed at P. The charges are identical, so the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies between every pair of charges. The charge at P interacts with each of the 12 charges at 2 m, and the 12 charges on the circle of radius 2 m interact among themselves. The minimum energy configuration is when the 12 charges are evenly spaced on the circle to minimize repulsion. The charge of each particle is q = 2e = 2 * 1.6 x 10^-19 C = 3.2 x 10^-19 C. The Coulomb potential energy between two charges q1 and q2 separated by distance r is U = k * q1 * q2 / r, where k = 8.99 x 10^9 Nm^2/C^2. First, calculate the energy between the center charge and each of the 12 charges: U_center = 12 * k * q^2 / 2 m. Then, calculate the energy between the 12 charges on the circle. The 12 charges are arranged evenly on a circle of radius 2 m, so the distance between two charges i and j is d_ij = 2 * 2 * sin(pi * |i-j| / 12) = 4 * sin(pi * |i-j| / 12). The total energy among the 12 charges is sum over all pairs (i&lt;j) of k * q^2 / d_ij. There are 12 charges, so total pairs = 12 * 11 / 2 = 66 pairs. Calculate sum of 1/d_ij over all pairs. Using symmetry, sum over m=1 to 6 of (number of pairs at distance m) * 1/distance(m). There are 12 pairs at each distance m=1 to 5, and 6 pairs at m=6 (opposite points). Distance at m is d_m = 4 * sin(pi * m / 12). So total U_12 = k * q^2 * sum_{m=1}^6 (N_m / d_m), where N_m = 12 for m=1 to 5 and 6 for m=6. Calculate sum: For m=1, sin(pi/12) ~ 0.2588, d_1=1.035, N_1=12, contribution=12/1.035=11.59 For m=2, sin(pi/6)=0.5, d_2=2, contribution=12/2=6 For m=3, sin(pi/4)=0.7071, d_3=2.828, contribution=12/2.828=4.24 For m=4, sin(pi/3)=0.8660, d_4=3.464, contribution=12/3.464=3.46 For m=5, sin(5pi/12)=0.9659, d_5=3.864, contribution=12/3.864=3.11 For m=6, sin(pi/2)=1, d_6=4, N_6=6, contribution=6/4=1.5 Sum=11.59+6+4.24+3.46+3.11+1.5=29.9 approx U_12 = k * q^2 * 29.9 U_center = 12 * k * q^2 / 2 = 6 * k * q^2 Total energy U_total = U_center + U_12 = k * q^2 (6 + 29.9) = k * q^2 * 35.9 Calculate k * q^2: q=3.2e-19 C, q^2=1.024e-37 C^2 k=8.99e9 Nm^2/C^2 So k * q^2 = 8.99e9 * 1.024e-37 = 9.204e-28 J U_total = 9.204e-28 * 35.9 = 3.3e-26 J Approximately 3.3 x 10^-26 J. Among the choices: 2.822 x 10^-26 (choice1), 5.645 x 10^-26 (choice2), 7.056 x 10^-27 (choice3), 122.330 (choice4). Our answer is closest to 2.822 x 10^-26 (choice1).
