Question: Example(question='Which of the following (effective) particles is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry?', choice1='Magnon', choice2='Skyrmion', choice3='Pion', choice4='Phonon', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: Magnons are quasiparticles associated with spin waves in a magnetically ordered system and arise due to spontaneous breaking of spin rotational symmetry. Pions are pseudo-Goldstone bosons resulting from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics. Phonons are quanta of lattice vibrations and are associated with the breaking of continuous translational symmetry in a crystal lattice. Skyrmions, on the other hand, are topological solitons or particle-like excitations in a field theory that do not directly correspond to a spontaneously broken symmetry but rather to topological properties of the field configuration. Therefore, the effective particle not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry is the Skyrmion.
