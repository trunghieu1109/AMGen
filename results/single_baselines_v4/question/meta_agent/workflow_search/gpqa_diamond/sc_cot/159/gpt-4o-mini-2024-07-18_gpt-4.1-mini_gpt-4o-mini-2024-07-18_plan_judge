Question: Example(question='Consider an aperture, which shapes like a N-sided polygon. All the apothems are of the same length a. When a monochromatic light (of wavelength \\lambda), travelling along z-axis, falls vertically on this aperture, it creates a series of intensity maxima and minima in the far field region. What is the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large ? Assume that the related angles are small so that tan theta = theta approximation can be taken.', choice1='1.220 \\lambda /a ', choice2='0.610 \\lambda / a', choice3='0.500 \\lambda / a', choice4='0.506 \\lambda / a', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: When N is infinitely large, the N-sided polygon approaches a circular aperture with radius a (since all apothems are length a). The diffraction pattern for a circular aperture is described by the Airy pattern. The angular position of the first minimum (theta_1) in the Airy pattern is given by 1.22 * lambda / D, where D is the diameter of the aperture. Here, D = 2a. So, the first minimum occurs at theta_1 = 1.22 * lambda / (2a) = 0.61 * lambda / a. The question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima. For a circular aperture, the minima are given by zeros of the Bessel function, and the first minimum is at 1.22 * lambda / D, the second minimum is at approximately 2.23 * lambda / D. The angular distance between the first two minima is (2.23 - 1.22) * lambda / D = 1.01 * lambda / D = 1.01 * lambda / (2a) = approximately 0.505 * lambda / a. Looking at the options, 0.506 * lambda / a matches this value. Therefore, the answer is choice 4.
