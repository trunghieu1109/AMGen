Question: Example(question='You are studying a nuclear decay which converts two heavy nucleons of flavor A to another flavor B, while simultaneously emitting two much lighter particles E and V. In short, 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V. It is known that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous, with some endpoint value Q.\n\nA variant of this decay emits one exotic, massless particle M instead of the 2V. In this case, how does the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles compare to that of the original decay?', choice1='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint increases.', choice2='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases.', choice3='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.', choice4='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint decreases.', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: In the original decay, the process 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V involves the emission of two lighter particles E and two particles V, leading to a continuous energy spectrum for the E particles due to the variable energy sharing among the emitted particles. The endpoint energy Q corresponds to the maximum energy the E particles can have when the other emitted particles carry minimal kinetic energy.

In the variant decay, the two V particles are replaced by a single massless particle M. Since M is massless, it can carry away varying amounts of energy and momentum. The presence of this single massless particle instead of two particles changes the kinematics but does not restrict the energy of E particles to discrete values; thus, the energy spectrum remains continuous. However, the shape of the spectrum will be altered due to the different energy and momentum sharing among the emitted particles. Additionally, since M is massless and only one particle replaces two particles V, the total available energy for the E particles can increase, pushing the endpoint energy higher than in the original decay.

Therefore, the energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.
