Question: Example(question='There has been an outbreak of an viral infectious disease in your city. You have been asked to design a molecular diagnostic kit for quick detection of this retrovirus. How would you go about designing this kit?', choice1='First you identify the virus by performing DNA sequencing. You then develop a PCR kit for  quick and accurate diagnosis', choice2='First you identify the IgG antibodies for the infection. You then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG antibodies for quick \n and accurate diagnosis.', choice3='First you identify the virus using the information about the symptoms, provided by the affected patients. You then design a nested PCR kit based on the information for quick diagnosis.', choice4='First you identify the virus by performing cDNA sequencing.  You then develop a real time PCR kit for quick and accurate diagnosis.', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: The virus is a retrovirus, which means its genetic material is RNA, not DNA. Therefore, to detect the virus molecularly, we need to convert its RNA into complementary DNA (cDNA) first. DNA sequencing of the viral genome should be done on cDNA, not directly on DNA, since the virus has RNA. After identifying the viral sequence, a real-time PCR (qPCR) kit can be developed for quick and accurate diagnosis. Option 1 mentions DNA sequencing, which is not appropriate for an RNA virus. Option 2 is about antibody detection, which is indirect and not molecular detection of the virus itself. Option 3 relies on symptom information and nested PCR without molecular identification, which is less accurate and slower. Option 4 correctly mentions cDNA sequencing and development of a real-time PCR kit, which is the best approach for quick and accurate molecular diagnosis of a retrovirus.
