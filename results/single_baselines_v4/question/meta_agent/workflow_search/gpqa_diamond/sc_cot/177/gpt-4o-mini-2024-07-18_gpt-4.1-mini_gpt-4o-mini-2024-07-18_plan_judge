proposed answer: First, recall the mass dimensions of the fields and operators involved in 4-dimensional spacetime: The Dirac spinor \psi has mass dimension 3/2. The field strength tensor F^{\mu\nu} has mass dimension 2. The sigma matrix \sigma_{\mu\nu} is just a combination of gamma matrices and does not carry mass dimension. The interaction term in the Lagrangian density must have mass dimension 4 since the action is dimensionless and the Lagrangian density integrates over d^4x. The interaction term is \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}. \bar{\psi} has the same mass dimension as \psi, which is 3/2. So the combined mass dimension of \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu} is (3/2) + 0 + (3/2) + 2 = 3/2 + 3/2 + 2 = 3 + 2 = 5. Therefore, the mass dimension of \kappa must be 4 - 5 = -1 to make the Lagrangian density have dimension 4. Since \kappa has negative mass dimension, the coupling is non-renormalizable. Hence, the correct choice is that \kappa has mass dimension -1 and the theory is not renormalizable.
