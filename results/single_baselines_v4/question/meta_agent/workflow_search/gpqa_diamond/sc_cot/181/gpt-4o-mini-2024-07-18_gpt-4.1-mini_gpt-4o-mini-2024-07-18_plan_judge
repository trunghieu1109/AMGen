Question: Example(question='The Mott-Gurney equation describes the dark current (J) versus voltage (V) behavior of a semiconductor device in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. The equation can be expressed as\n$ J = \\frac{9}{8} \\epsilon \\mu \\frac{V^2}{L^3}$\nwhere $\\epsilon$ is the dielectric constant, $\\mu$ is the charge carrier mobility, and L is the length of the device. Which of the following statements is true about the validity of this equation?\n', choice1='The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.', choice2='The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.', choice3='The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.', choice4='The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The Mott-Gurney law applies to space-charge-limited current in a trap-free, single-carrier device. It assumes that the contact is Ohmic (no injection barrier) so that the current is limited by space charge rather than injection. Diffusion current is negligible compared to drift current in this regime. Therefore, the correct statement must mention a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current. Choice 1 mentions no carrier injection barrier but doesn't explicitly say Ohmic contact; however, no barrier implies Ohmic contact. Choice 2 mentions negligible drift current, which contradicts the SCLC regime where drift current dominates. Choice 3 refers to two-carrier device which is incorrect. Choice 4 mentions Schottky contact which implies a barrier and is not valid. Hence, the best choice is A.
