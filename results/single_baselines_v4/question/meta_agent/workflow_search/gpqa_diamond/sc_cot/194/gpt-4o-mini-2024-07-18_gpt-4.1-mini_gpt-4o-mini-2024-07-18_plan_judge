Question: Example(question='Astronomers are observing a planet with a radius of 1 Earth radius in a circular orbit, with a transit impact parameter of 0.2, around a star that has a radius 1.5 times that of the Sun. This planet has an orbital period of 3 days. What is the maximum orbital period of a second planet, with a radius of 2.5 times that of Earth, in the same system that will exhibit both transit and occultation events? Assume that the second planet also has a circular orbit and shares the same orbital plane as the previously mentioned transiting planet.', choice1='~ 7.5', choice2='~ 33.5', choice3='~ 37.5', choice4='~ 12.5', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: First, let's understand the problem: We have a star with radius 1.5 times the Sun's radius, a first planet with radius 1 Earth radius orbiting with period 3 days and impact parameter 0.2. The second planet has radius 2.5 Earth radii, same orbital plane, circular orbit, and we want the maximum orbital period such that it exhibits both transit and occultation.

Transit occurs when the planet passes in front of the star (impact parameter less than 1 + planet radius / star radius). Occultation occurs when the planet passes behind the star (similar geometric condition).

Given the first planet's impact parameter b = 0.2, the second planet must have an impact parameter less than 1 + (planet radius / star radius) for both transit and occultation.

Since the planets share the same orbital plane, the impact parameter depends on the inclination and the orbital radius.

Impact parameter b = (a / R_star) * cos(i), where a is orbital radius, i is inclination.

Given that the first planet has b = 0.2 at a1 with period P1 = 3 days.

From Kepler's third law, a ∝ P^(2/3).

Assuming the same inclination for the second planet, b2 = (a2 / R_star) * cos(i) = (a2 / a1) * b1.

For transit and occultation, b2 must be less than or equal to 1 - (planet radius / star radius).

Calculate star radius R_star = 1.5 R_sun.

Planet radius R_p2 = 2.5 R_earth.

Calculate (R_p2 / R_star):
R_sun ≈ 109 R_earth
So, R_star = 1.5 * 109 = 163.5 R_earth
Therefore, (R_p2 / R_star) = 2.5 / 163.5 ≈ 0.0153

Maximum b2 for transit and occultation: b_max = 1 - 0.0153 = 0.9847

Since b2 = (a2 / a1) * b1, and b1 = 0.2,
we have (a2 / a1) * 0.2 ≤ 0.9847 => (a2 / a1) ≤ 0.9847 / 0.2 = 4.9235

Using Kepler's third law: a ∝ P^(2/3), so (a2 / a1) = (P2 / P1)^{2/3}

Therefore, (P2 / 3)^{2/3} ≤ 4.9235

Raise both sides to the power 3/2:
P2 / 3 ≤ 4.9235^{3/2}

Calculate 4.9235^{3/2}:
4.9235^{1.5} = 4.9235^{1} * 4.9235^{0.5} ≈ 4.9235 * 2.22 ≈ 10.93

So, P2 / 3 ≤ 10.93 => P2 ≤ 32.8 days

Looking at the options, the closest maximum orbital period is ~33.5 days.

Hence, the answer is choice B).
