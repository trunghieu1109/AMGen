Question: Example(question='Two stars are being studied. It has been observed that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2. In fact, the energy difference between the considered energy levels was determined to be approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J. Assuming that the stellar photospheres are in LTE, which of these equations for the effective temperatures of the stars (T_1 and T_2) is correct?', choice1='ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]\n', choice2='ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]\n', choice3='ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n', choice4='ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: The problem involves the relative population of atoms in a certain energy level in two stars. According to the Boltzmann distribution under LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the ratio of populations n_1/n_2 = exp[-(E_1 - E_2)/kT]. Given that the excitation of iron atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2, the ratio n_1/n_2 = 2. Let the energy difference be E = 1.38 x 10^(-23) J, and k is Boltzmann constant. Then, 2 = exp[-E/kT_1] / exp[-E/kT_2] = exp[E/k (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)]. Taking natural logarithm, ln(2) = E/k (1/T_2 - 1/T_1). Rearranging, ln(2) = (E/k) * (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2). This matches the form ln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) when constants are factored out, which corresponds to choice 4.
