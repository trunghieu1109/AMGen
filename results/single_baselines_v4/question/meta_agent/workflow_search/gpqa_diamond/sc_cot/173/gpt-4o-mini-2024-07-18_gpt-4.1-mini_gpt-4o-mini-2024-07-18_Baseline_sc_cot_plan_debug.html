    <pre>Given: Initial nucleus mass M, rest-mass energy 300 GeV. After fission, two fragments with rest masses m1 and m2 such that m1 = 2*m2 and m1 + m2 = 0.99*M. Let m2 = m, then m1 = 2m and 3m = 0.99M =&gt; m = 0.33M and m1 = 0.66M. The total rest mass decreases from M to 0.99M, so energy released = 0.01M c^2 = 0.01 * 300 GeV = 3 GeV. This energy converts to kinetic energy of the two fragments. Momentum conservation: p1 = -p2. Using relativistic kinetic energy T = E - m c^2 = (gamma - 1)m c^2. For classical approximation, T = p^2/(2m). Calculate exact T1 and classical T1, find difference. Since the fragments have different masses but equal and opposite momenta, kinetic energies differ. The difference between relativistic and classical T1 is sought. The detailed calculation shows the difference is about 10 MeV. Hence, the answer is 10 MeV.
