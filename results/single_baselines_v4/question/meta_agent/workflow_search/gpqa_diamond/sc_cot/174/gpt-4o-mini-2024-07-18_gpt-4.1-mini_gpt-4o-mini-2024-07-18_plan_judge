Question: Example(question='Consider an oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis). Because it oscillates, it would radiate at a wavelength \\lambda. In the radiation zone, the radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of \\lambda and the angle \\theta (with z-axis), along which the power is measured. If the maximum power thus radiated is A, the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle \\theta = 30^0 and a possible form of f are, respectively,', choice1='1/2, \\lambda^(-4)', choice2='3/4, \\lambda^(-6)', choice3='1/4, \\lambda^(-4)', choice4='1/4, \\lambda^(-3)', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: For an oscillating charge distribution shaped like a spheroid with symmetry axis along the z-axis, the radiation pattern is typically similar to that of an electric dipole oriented along the z-axis. The angular dependence of the radiated power per unit solid angle is proportional to sin^2(theta). The maximum radiation occurs at theta = 90 degrees (perpendicular to the z-axis), where sin^2(90°) = 1. At theta = 30 degrees, sin^2(30°) = (1/2)^2 = 1/4. Therefore, the fraction of the maximum power radiated at theta = 30° is 1/4. Regarding the wavelength dependence, for dipole radiation, the power radiated per unit solid angle scales as lambda^(-4). Thus, the fraction is 1/4 and the function f is proportional to lambda^(-4). This matches choice3: '1/4, \lambda^(-4)'.
