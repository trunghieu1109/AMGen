Question: Example(question='Astronomers are studying two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2. Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.', choice1='~ 0.4', choice2='~ 0.7', choice3='~ 0.6\n', choice4='~ 1.2', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The period of system_1 is 2 years and system_2 is 1 year. The total mass of a binary system can be found using Kepler's third law: M_total ‚àù (a^3) / (P^2), where P is the orbital period and a is the semi-major axis of the orbit. The semi-major axis can be related to the radial velocity amplitudes (K1 and K2) and the period. The sum of masses M1 + M2 is proportional to (K1 + K2)^3 * P. For system_1, K1 + K2 = 10 + 5 = 15 km/s, P1 = 2 years. For system_2, K1 + K2 = 15 + 10 = 25 km/s, P2 = 1 year. The ratio of masses M1 / M2 = ((K1 + K2)_1 / (K1 + K2)_2)^3 * (P1 / P2). Plugging in values: = (15/25)^3 * (2/1) = (0.6)^3 * 2 = 0.216 * 2 = 0.432. So system_1 is approximately 0.4 times as massive as system_2.
