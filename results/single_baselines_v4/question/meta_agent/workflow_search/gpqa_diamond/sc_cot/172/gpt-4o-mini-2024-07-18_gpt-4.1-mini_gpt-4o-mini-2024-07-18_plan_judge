Question: Example(question="If uncertainty in space of electron's location, which is travelling with speed v= 2* 10^8 m/s along x-direction is Δx=0.1 nm . Based on the infromation estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of electron.", choice1='~10^(-19) J', choice2='~10^(-18) J', choice3='~10^(-16) J', choice4='~10^(-17) J', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: Given: Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 × 10^(-9) m = 1 × 10^(-10) m, v = 2 × 10^8 m/s. We want to find the minimum uncertainty in energy ΔE. From Heisenberg uncertainty principle: Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ = h/(2π) ≈ 1.055 × 10^(-34) J·s. Calculate Δp: Δp ≥ ħ/(2Δx) = 1.055 × 10^(-34) / (2 × 1 × 10^(-10)) = 5.275 × 10^(-25) kg·m/s. The uncertainty in energy ΔE can be estimated from ΔE ≈ v * Δp (since E = p*v for non-relativistic approx). So, ΔE ≈ 2 × 10^8 m/s × 5.275 × 10^(-25) kg·m/s = 1.055 × 10^(-16) J. Therefore, the minimum uncertainty in energy ΔE is approximately 10^(-16) J.
