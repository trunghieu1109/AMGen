Question: Example(question='Imagine an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ having a small spherical cavity inside. The centre of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the centre of the spherical conductor. The radius of the cavity is $r$, and $r<R$. Now consider a small amount of positive charge $+q$ is somehow placed somewhere inside the cavity. What is the magnitude of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at a point P (outside the spherical conductor) of distance $L$ from the centre of the spherical conductor? Note, the distance of the point P from the centre of the cavity is $l$. Here, l, L > R. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\\theta$\n', choice1='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n', choice2='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n', choice3='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\n', choice4='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: The spherical conductor is uncharged and grounded, so the net charge on its outer surface is zero. The charge +q inside the cavity induces charges on the cavity surface, but the conductor as a whole remains neutral and shields the outside region from any field created inside the cavity. From outside the conductor (at point P, distance L > R from the conductor's center), the conductor acts as a neutral body with no net charge. Therefore, the electric field at point P due to the charge inside the cavity is zero or equivalently, the conductor cancels the effect of the internal charge outside. However, if we consider the conductor as isolated and uncharged, the induced charges on the cavity surface and the conductor surface rearrange so that the field inside the conductor's body is zero, and outside the conductor the net effect is as if the conductor carries zero net charge. Hence, the external field at P is zero due to the charge inside the cavity. But the problem gives options for the electric field magnitude, assuming the conductor does not shield the field. Since the conductor is a conductor and the charge is inside a cavity, the field outside the conductor is zero. Therefore, the correct answer is the field at point P is zero. But none of the options say zero. Alternatively, if the conductor is isolated and uncharged, the problem is a classic electrostatics problem where the charge +q inside the cavity induces charges on the cavity surface, but outside the conductor the field is as if the charge +q is at the center of the conductor (because the conductor shields the field from the off-center charge). So the external field is that of a point charge q located at the center of the conductor. Therefore, the electric field at point P is E = (1/4πε₀) * q / L². So the correct choice is choice4.
