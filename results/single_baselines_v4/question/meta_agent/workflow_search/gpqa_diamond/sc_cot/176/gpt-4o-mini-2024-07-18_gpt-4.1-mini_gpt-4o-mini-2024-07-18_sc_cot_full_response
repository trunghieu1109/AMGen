Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent Dt0q', content="The luminosity L of a star radiating as a black body is given by L = 4πR^2σT^4, where R is the radius and T is the temperature. The stars have the same peak wavelength, which means they have the same temperature T (from Wien's law). Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, so R1 = 1.5 * R2. Since temperatures are equal, the luminosity ratio L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. Therefore, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2 by a factor of approximately 2.25.\n\nAnswer:A)", prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
