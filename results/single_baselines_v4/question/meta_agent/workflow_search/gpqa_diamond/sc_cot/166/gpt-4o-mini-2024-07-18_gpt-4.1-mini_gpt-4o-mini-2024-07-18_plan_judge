proposed answer: The Schrödinger cat state given is |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>) / N, with N = sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi)*exp(-2*alpha^2)). We are asked to calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) using the relative entropy measure for phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5.

Step 1: Calculate N.
phi = -pi/4, alpha = 0.5
sin(2*phi) = sin(-pi/2) = -1
exp(-2*alpha^2) = exp(-2*0.25) = exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065
N = sqrt(1 + (-1)*0.6065) = sqrt(1 - 0.6065) = sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6276

Step 2: The state is normalized by N.

Step 3: The relative entropy measure of non-Gaussianity is defined as del_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau), where tau is the Gaussian reference state with the same first and second moments as rho.

Step 4: For the cat state with phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5, the state is a superposition with coefficients (cos(-pi/4), sin(-pi/4)) = (sqrt(2)/2, -sqrt(2)/2).

Step 5: The non-Gaussianity measure for small alpha cat states is known to be small but non-zero. The choices given are 2.48, 0, 1.38, and 0.25.

Step 6: Since the state is a superposition of coherent states with small amplitude (0.5), the non-Gaussianity would be small but positive.

Step 7: Zero is not correct, since the state is clearly non-Gaussian.

Step 8: 2.48 and 1.38 seem too large for such a small alpha.

Step 9: 0.25 is a plausible small positive value for the relative entropy measure of non-Gaussianity for this cat state.

Therefore, the answer is 0.25 (choice D).
