Question: Example(question='In an industrial research lab, a scientist performs ethylene polymerization with a homogeneous organometallic catalyst system, generating a polymer of high density. He intends to add a second catalyst system to introduce regular branches in the polymer backbone, also only using ethylene as the reactant. He consults a senior scientist, who gives the following statements. “Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US. One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators. Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step. Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.”\nWhich of these four statements is correct regarding the formation of a polymer with regular branches using only ethylene as the monomer and a dual catalyst system?', choice1='Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.', choice2='Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.', choice3='One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.', choice4='Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline sc_cot
proposed answer: The question involves ethylene polymerization using dual catalyst systems to produce high-density polymers with regular branching from ethylene alone. The senior scientist's statements need to be evaluated for correctness. Statement 1 claims such combined systems are already implemented industrially in the US, which is true as metallocene and post-metallocene catalysts are used commercially. Statement 2 says aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step; however, aluminum-based activators (like MAO) are commonly used in these catalyst systems, so this is false. Statement 3 states one can use a Group VIa transition metal catalyst with specific activators. Group VIa metals are chromium, molybdenum, and tungsten. Chromium-based Phillips catalysts are used industrially for ethylene polymerization, but for regular branching with only ethylene, other catalysts are typically used. This statement is somewhat ambiguous but generally correct for certain catalyst systems. Statement 4 says certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive. Noble metal catalysts (e.g., Pd, Ni) can indeed produce branched polyethylene, but their cost limits industrial use. This is true. Therefore, the correct statement regarding the formation of polymers with regular branches using only ethylene and a dual catalyst system is statement 1: Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.
