Question: Example(question='We would like to dissolve (at 25°С) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm3 total volume. What is the minimum volume (cm3) of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution and what is the pH of the resulting solution?', choice1='pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3', choice2='pH 2.69; 30.09 cm3', choice3='pH 3.16; 32.14 cm3', choice4='pH 4.94; 20.40 cm3', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The problem requires dissolving 0.1 g of Fe(OH)3 in a total volume of 100 cm3 using a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid. Calculating the moles of Fe(OH)3: molar mass ≈ 106.87 g/mol, so moles = 0.1 / 106.87 ≈ 9.36 x 10^-4 mol. Each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+ to dissolve, so total moles of acid needed = 3 * 9.36 x 10^-4 = 2.81 x 10^-3 mol. Using 0.1 M acid, volume needed = moles / concentration = 2.81 x 10^-3 / 0.1 = 0.0281 L = 28.1 cm3. Among the given choices, the volume closest to this is 28.05 cm3 with a pH of 2.04. This matches the expected pH for the resulting solution after dissolution and neutralization. Therefore, the correct choice is A).
