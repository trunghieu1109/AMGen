Question: Example(question='What is the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product obtained when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess of HI?', choice1='1', choice2='3', choice3='0', choice4='5', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The starting compound has an IHD of 5 due to the ring, double bonds in the ring, vinyl group, and carbonyl groups (formyl and carboxylic acid). When reacted with red phosphorus and excess HI, the aldehyde and carboxylic acid groups are reduced to alkyl groups, and the double bonds (including the vinyl and ring double bond) are also reduced to single bonds. The ring remains intact, so the product has only the ring contributing to IHD. Therefore, the IHD of the product is 1.
