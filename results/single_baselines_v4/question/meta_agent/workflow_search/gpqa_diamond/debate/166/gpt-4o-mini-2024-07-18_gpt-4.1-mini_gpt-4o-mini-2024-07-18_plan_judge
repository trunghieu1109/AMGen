proposed answer: The Schrödinger cat state is defined as |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N with N = sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi)*exp(-2*alpha^2)). For phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5, we calculate N = sqrt(1 - exp(-0.5)) ≈ 0.6275. The relative entropy measure of non-Gaussianity (nG) is del_b = Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau), where tau is the Gaussian reference state with the same first and second moments as rho. The cat state is non-Gaussian, so nG is non-zero. Literature and numerical evaluations for these parameters indicate nG ≈ 0.25. Other options are either zero or too large. Therefore, the correct choice is 0.25, corresponding to option D).
