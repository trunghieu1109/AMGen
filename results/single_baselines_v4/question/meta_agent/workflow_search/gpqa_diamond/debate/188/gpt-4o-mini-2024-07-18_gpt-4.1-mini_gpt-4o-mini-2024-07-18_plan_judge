Question: Example(question='Which of the following (effective) particles is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry?', choice1='Magnon', choice2='Skyrmion', choice3='Pion', choice4='Phonon', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: Magnons, pions, and phonons are all quasiparticles that arise due to spontaneous symmetry breaking: magnons from broken spin rotational symmetry, pions from broken chiral symmetry, and phonons from broken translational symmetry in crystals. Skyrmions, however, are topological solitons and not Goldstone bosons or quasiparticles arising from spontaneous symmetry breaking. They are stable due to topological reasons rather than symmetry breaking. Therefore, the effective particle not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry is the Skyrmion.
