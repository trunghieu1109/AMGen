### thinking by Debate Agent ctX7:
Magnons are quasiparticles associated with spin waves in a magnetically ordered system, arising from the spontaneous breaking of spin rotational symmetry. Pions are pseudo-Goldstone bosons resulting from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics. Phonons are quasiparticles representing quantized lattice vibrations, which emerge from the spontaneous breaking of continuous translational symmetry in a crystal lattice. Skyrmions, however, are topological solitons or particle-like configurations in a field theory, not Goldstone bosons arising from spontaneous symmetry breaking. They are stable due to topological reasons rather than being associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry.

Magnons are quasiparticles associated with spin waves in magnetically ordered systems and arise due to spontaneously broken spin rotational symmetry. Pions are pseudo-Goldstone bosons resulting from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics. Phonons are quasiparticles representing quantized lattice vibrations and are associated with the spontaneous breaking of continuous translational symmetry in a crystal lattice. Skyrmions, on the other hand, are topological solitons and not directly associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry; they are stable field configurations rather than Goldstone bosons or quasiparticles emerging from spontaneous symmetry breaking.

### thinking by Debate Agent bA1y:
Magnons are quasiparticles associated with spin waves in a magnetically ordered system, arising from spontaneously broken spin rotational symmetry. Pions are pseudo-Goldstone bosons resulting from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics. Phonons are quasiparticles related to lattice vibrations, which can be viewed as arising from the spontaneous breaking of continuous translational symmetry of the crystal lattice. Skyrmions, however, are topological solitons or particle-like configurations in a field, not directly a Goldstone mode or an excitation from a spontaneously broken continuous symmetry. They are stable due to topological reasons rather than symmetry breaking. Therefore, the effective particle not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry is the Skyrmion.

### thinking by Debate Agent 5SLk:
Magnons are quasiparticles associated with spin waves in a magnetically ordered system, arising from the spontaneous breaking of spin rotational symmetry. Pions are pseudo-Goldstone bosons resulting from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics. Phonons are quanta of lattice vibrations and are associated with the breaking of continuous translational symmetry in a crystal lattice. Skyrmions, however, are topological solitons or particle-like configurations in a field, not directly associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry but rather with topological properties of the field configuration. Therefore, the effective particle not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry is the Skyrmion.

    <pre>Magnons, pions, and phonons are all quasiparticles that arise due to spontaneous symmetry breaking: magnons from broken spin rotational symmetry, pions from broken chiral symmetry, and phonons from broken translational symmetry in crystals. Skyrmions, however, are topological solitons and not Goldstone bosons or quasiparticles arising from spontaneous symmetry breaking. They are stable due to topological reasons rather than symmetry breaking. Therefore, the effective particle not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry is the Skyrmion.
