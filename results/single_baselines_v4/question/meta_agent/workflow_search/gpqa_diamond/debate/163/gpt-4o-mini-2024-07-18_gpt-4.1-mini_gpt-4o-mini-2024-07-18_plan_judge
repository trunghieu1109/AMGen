Question: Example(question='Astronomers are studying two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2. Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.', choice1='~ 0.4', choice2='~ 0.7', choice3='~ 0.6\n', choice4='~ 1.2', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The total mass of a binary system can be estimated using Kepler's third law and the radial velocity amplitudes. The total mass is proportional to (K1 + K2)^3 * P, where K1 and K2 are the radial velocity amplitudes of the two stars, and P is the orbital period. For system_1, P1 = 2 years, K1 + K2 = 15 km/s. For system_2, P2 = 1 year, K1 + K2 = 25 km/s. The mass ratio M1/M2 = (15^3 * 2) / (25^3 * 1) = 6750 / 15625 â‰ˆ 0.432, which is approximately 0.4. Therefore, system_1 is about 0.4 times as massive as system_2.
