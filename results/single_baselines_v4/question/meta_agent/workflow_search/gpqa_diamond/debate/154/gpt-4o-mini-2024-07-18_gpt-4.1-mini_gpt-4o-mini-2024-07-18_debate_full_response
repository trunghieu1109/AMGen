Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Final Decision Agent zWWs', content='The operator P_z is diagonal in the given basis with eigenvalues ħ, 0, and -ħ. The state vector is given as (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). To find the uncertainty ΔP_z, we calculate the expectation values <P_z> and <P_z^2>. <P_z> = (1/4)ħ + 0 + (1/4)(-ħ) = 0. <P_z^2> = (1/4)ħ^2 + 0 + (1/4)ħ^2 = (1/2)ħ^2.
