Question: Example(question='Consider an oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis). Because it oscillates, it would radiate at a wavelength \\lambda. In the radiation zone, the radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of \\lambda and the angle \\theta (with z-axis), along which the power is measured. If the maximum power thus radiated is A, the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle \\theta = 30^0 and a possible form of f are, respectively,', choice1='1/2, \\lambda^(-4)', choice2='3/4, \\lambda^(-6)', choice3='1/4, \\lambda^(-4)', choice4='1/4, \\lambda^(-3)', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The radiation pattern for an oscillating charge distribution with spheroidal symmetry along the z-axis resembles that of a dipole, where the power radiated per unit solid angle is proportional to sin^2(theta). The maximum radiation occurs at theta = 90 degrees. At theta = 30 degrees, sin^2(30Â°) = (1/2)^2 = 1/4, so the fraction of maximum power radiated at 30 degrees is 1/4. The wavelength dependence of the radiated power for such a dipole-like oscillation scales as lambda^(-4). Therefore, the correct fraction and wavelength dependence pair is 1/4 and lambda^(-4), corresponding to choice 3.
