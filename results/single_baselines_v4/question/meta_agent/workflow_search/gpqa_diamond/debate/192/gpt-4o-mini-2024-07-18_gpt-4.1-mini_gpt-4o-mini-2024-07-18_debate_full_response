Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Final Decision Agent QMxX', content='The number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. Since parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance (r), i.e., plx = 1/r, substituting this into the expression gives the number of stars varying as 1/(1/r)^5 = r^5. Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance r varies as r^5.\n\nAnswer:D)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.

Then, the number of stars varies as 1/(1/r)^5 = r^5. Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance r varies as r^5.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent jaKR:\nGiven that parallax p is inversely proportional to distance r (p = 1/r), the number of stars varies as 1/p^5. Substituting p = 1/r, the number of stars varies as 1/(1/r)^5 = r^5. Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance r varies as r^5.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent 6GRO:\nGiven that the number of stars varies with parallax (plx) as 1/plx^5, and knowing that parallax is inversely proportional to distance (r), i.e., plx ~ 1/r, we can express the number of stars as a function of distance. Substituting plx = 1/r into the expression, we get number of stars ~ 1/(1/r)^5 = r^5. Therefore, the number of stars per unit distance range varies as r^5.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent mN8g:\nGiven that the number of stars varies with parallax (plx) as 1/plx^5, and knowing that parallax is inversely proportional to distance (r), i.e., plx ~ 1/r, we can substitute plx with 1/r. Therefore, the number of stars varies as 1/(1/r)^5 = r^5.
