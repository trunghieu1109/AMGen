Question: Example(question='You are studying a nuclear decay which converts two heavy nucleons of flavor A to another flavor B, while simultaneously emitting two much lighter particles E and V. In short, 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V. It is known that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous, with some endpoint value Q.\n\nA variant of this decay emits one exotic, massless particle M instead of the 2V. In this case, how does the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles compare to that of the original decay?', choice1='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint increases.', choice2='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases.', choice3='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.', choice4='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint decreases.', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The original decay involves multiple particles sharing energy, resulting in a continuous energy spectrum for the E particles with an endpoint Q. Replacing two V particles with a single massless particle M changes the kinematics but still allows continuous energy sharing among the emitted particles. Since M is massless and only one particle, the energy available to the E particles can increase, raising the endpoint energy. The spectrum remains continuous but with an adjusted shape due to the different final state particles. Therefore, the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.
