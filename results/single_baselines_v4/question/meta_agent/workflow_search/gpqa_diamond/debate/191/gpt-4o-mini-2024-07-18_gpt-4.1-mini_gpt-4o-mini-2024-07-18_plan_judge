Question: Example(question='Imagine an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ having a small spherical cavity inside. The centre of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the centre of the spherical conductor. The radius of the cavity is $r$, and $r<R$. Now consider a small amount of positive charge $+q$ is somehow placed somewhere inside the cavity. What is the magnitude of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at a point P (outside the spherical conductor) of distance $L$ from the centre of the spherical conductor? Note, the distance of the point P from the centre of the cavity is $l$. Here, l, L > R. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\\theta$\n', choice1='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n', choice2='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n', choice3='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\n', choice4='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: The problem involves a spherical conductor with a cavity inside it, containing a charge +q. The conductor is uncharged overall. The charge inside the cavity induces a charge -q on the cavity's inner surface and +q on the outer surface of the conductor. Since the conductor is spherical and conductive, the induced +q charge on the outer surface distributes uniformly, effectively acting as a point charge +q at the center of the conductor for points outside the conductor. Therefore, the electric field at a point P outside the conductor (distance L > R from the center) is the same as that due to a point charge +q located at the center of the conductor. Hence, the magnitude of the electric field at point P is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². The other distances l and s relate to the cavity and the charge inside it, but for points outside the conductor, the field depends only on the net charge on the conductor's outer surface, which is +q at the center. Thus, the correct choice is D).
