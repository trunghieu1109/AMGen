Question: Example(question='Consider an aperture, which shapes like a N-sided polygon. All the apothems are of the same length a. When a monochromatic light (of wavelength \\lambda), travelling along z-axis, falls vertically on this aperture, it creates a series of intensity maxima and minima in the far field region. What is the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large ? Assume that the related angles are small so that tan theta = theta approximation can be taken.', choice1='1.220 \\lambda /a ', choice2='0.610 \\lambda / a', choice3='0.500 \\lambda / a', choice4='0.506 \\lambda / a', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: As the number of sides N of the polygon becomes infinitely large, the polygon approaches a circular aperture with radius equal to the apothem a. The diffraction pattern of a circular aperture is described by the Airy pattern. The minima in the diffraction pattern correspond to the zeros of the Bessel function J1. The first minimum occurs at an angle approximately 1.22 * lambda / D, where D is the diameter of the aperture. Since the radius is a, the diameter D = 2a. Therefore, the first minimum is at 1.22 * lambda / (2a) = 0.61 * lambda / a. The second minimum occurs at approximately 2.23 * lambda / D = 2.23 * lambda / (2a) = 1.115 * lambda / a. The angular distance between the first two minima is then (2.23 - 1.22) * lambda / D = 1.01 * lambda / D = 1.01 * lambda / (2a) = 0.505 * lambda / a. Among the given options, 0.506 * lambda / a (option D) is the closest to this value. Hence, the correct answer is D).
