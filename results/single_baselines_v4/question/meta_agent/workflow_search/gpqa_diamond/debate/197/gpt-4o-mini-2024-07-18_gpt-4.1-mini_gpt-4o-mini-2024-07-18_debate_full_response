The total Co concentration is 10^-2 M and SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants for Co(II) thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. These β values represent cumulative formation constants: β1 = [Co(SCN)]+ / ([Co2+][SCN-]), β2 = [Co(SCN)2] / ([Co2+][SCN-]^2), etc. We want the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex Co(SCN)2 among all Co species. \n\nStep 1: Define concentrations of species:\n[Co2+] = free cobalt\n[Co(SCN)]+ = β1[Co2+][SCN-]\n[Co(SCN)2] = β2[Co2+][SCN-]^2\n[Co(SCN)3]- = β3[Co2+][SCN-]^3\n[Co(SCN)4]2- = β4[Co2+][SCN-]^4\n\nStep 2: Total Co concentration =\n[Co2+] + [Co(SCN)]+ + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3]- + [Co(SCN)4]2-\n= [Co2+](1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)\n\nStep 3: Plug in values:\n[SCN-] = 0.1 M\nβ1 = 9\nβ2 = 40\nβ3 = 63\nβ4 = 16\n\nCalculate each term:\nβ1[SCN-] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9\nβ2[SCN-]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\nβ3[SCN-]^3 = 63 * (0.1)^3 = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\nβ4[SCN-]^4 = 16 * (0.1)^4 = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nSum inside parentheses = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nStep 4: Calculate fraction of Co(SCN)2:\nFraction = [Co(SCN)2] / total Co = (β2[Co2+][SCN-]^2) / total Co\n= (β2[SCN-]^2) / (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)\n= 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.1692 or 16.9%\n\nTherefore, the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex is approximately 16.9%.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent eJow:\nGiven: c(Co) = 10^-2 M, [SCN-] = 0.1 M, and stability constants β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16 for Co(SCN)x2+ complexes. The species are Co2+, Co(SCN)+, Co(SCN)2, Co(SCN)3-, Co(SCN)4^2-. The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all species concentrations. We want the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex Co(SCN)2 among all cobalt species.\n\nCalculate the concentration ratio of each complex relative to free Co2+:\n- [Co(SCN)+] = β1 * [Co2+] * [SCN-] = 9 * [Co2+] * 0.1 = 0.9 * [Co2+]\n- [Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co2+] * [SCN-]^2 = 40 * [Co2+] * (0.1)^2 = 40 * [Co2+] * 0.01 = 0.4 * [Co2+]\n- [Co(SCN)3-] = β3 * [Co2+] * (0.1)^3 = 63 * [Co2+] * 0.001 = 0.063 * [Co2+]\n- [Co(SCN)4^2-] = β4 * [Co2+] * (0.1)^4 = 16 * [Co2+] * 0.0001 = 0.0016 * [Co2+]\n\nSum of all species concentrations = [Co2+] + 0.9[Co2+] + 0.4[Co2+] + 0.063[Co2+] + 0.0016[Co2+] = [Co2+]*(1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016) = [Co2+] * 2.3646\n\nSince total cobalt concentration c(Co) = 10^-2 M = [Co]_total, then:\n[Co2+] = c(Co) / 2.3646 = 0.01 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.00423 M\n\nConcentration of Co(SCN)2 = 0.4 * [Co2+] = 0.4 * 0.00423 = 0.00169 M\n\nPercentage of Co(SCN)2 among all cobalt species = (0.00169 / 0.01) * 100% = 16.9%\n\nTherefore, the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is 16.9%.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent xVo6:\nFirst, let's identify the species involved. The cobalt(II) ions can form complexes with thiocyanate ions (SCN-) as follows: Co^2+, Co(SCN)^+, Co(SCN)_2, Co(SCN)_3^-, and Co(SCN)_4^{2-}. The stability constants (β) are cumulative: β1 = [Co(SCN)]/[Co][SCN], β2 = [Co(SCN)_2]/[Co][SCN]^2, β3 = [Co(SCN)_3]/[Co][SCN]^3, β4 = [Co(SCN)_4]/[Co][SCN]^4. Given: c(Co) = 10^-2 M, [SCN-] = 0.1 M. We want the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is Co(SCN)_2. The fraction of Co(SCN)_2 among all cobalt species is: f2 = [Co(SCN)_2]/(sum of all Co species). The total cobalt concentration c(Co) = [Co] + [Co(SCN)] + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3] + [Co(SCN)_4]. Using β values: [Co(SCN)] = β1 * [Co] * [SCN] = 9 * [Co] * 0.1 = 0.9 [Co]. Similarly, [Co(SCN)_2] = β2 * [Co] * (0.1)^2 = 40 * [Co] * 0.01 = 0.4 [Co]. [Co(SCN)_3] = β3 * [Co] * (0.1)^3 = 63 * [Co] * 0.001 = 0.063 [Co]. [Co(SCN)_4] = β4 * [Co] * (0.1)^4 = 16 * [Co] * 0.0001 = 0.0016 [Co]. Total Co = [Co] + 0.9[Co] + 0.4[Co] + 0.063[Co] + 0.0016[Co] = [Co] * (1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016) = [Co] * 2.3646. Since total Co concentration is 10^-2 M, [Co] = 10^-2 / 2.3646. Now, fraction of Co(SCN)_2 = [Co(SCN)_2]/total Co = 0.4[Co]/(2.3646[Co]) = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.169, or 16.9%. Therefore, the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is approximately 16.9%.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent UD2w:\nGiven: c(Co) = 10^-2 M, [SCN-] = 0.1 M, and stability constants β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16 for Co(SCN) complexes.

We want the percentage of Co(SCN)2 among all cobalt species.\n\nStep 1: Define species concentrations:\nLet [Co2+] = x0 (free cobalt), then\n[Co(SCN)+] = β1 * x0 * [SCN-] = 9 * x0 * 0.1 = 0.9 x0\n[Co(SCN)2] = β2 * x0 * [SCN-]^2 = 40 * x0 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * x0 * 0.01 = 0.4 x0\n[Co(SCN)3-] = β3 * x0 * (0.1)^3 = 63 * x0 * 0.001 = 0.063 x0\n[Co(SCN)4^2-] = β4 * x0 * (0.1)^4 = 16 * x0 * 0.0001 = 0.0016 x0\n\nStep 2: Total cobalt concentration:\nC_total = x0 + 0.9 x0 + 0.4 x0 + 0.063 x0 + 0.0016 x0 = x0 (1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016) = x0 * 2.3646\n\nStep 3: Find x0:\nx0 = C_total / 2.3646 = 0.01 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.00423 M\n\nStep 4: Calculate [Co(SCN)2]:\n[Co(SCN)2] = 0.4 * x0 = 0.4 * 0.00423 = 0.001692 M\n\nStep 5: Percentage of Co(SCN)2 among total cobalt:\n% = ([Co(SCN)2] / C_total) * 100 = (0.001692 / 0.01) * 100 = 16.92%\n\nThis corresponds to choice 1: 16.9%.\n\n### answer by Debate Agent E6Fv:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent eJow:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent xVo6:\nA)\n\n### answer by Debate Agent UD2w:\nA)\n\nGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.
