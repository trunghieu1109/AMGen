Question: Example(question='In an inactive state, a transcription factor subunit awaits an activation signal from the membrane phosphorylation cascade. Upon phosphorylation on the Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, shuttles into the nucleus, and serves in gene transcription. A missense mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. You observe that a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Which of the following molecular phenotypes is most likely observed in the presence of mutation Y?', choice1='loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype', choice2='protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype', choice3='protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele', choice4='change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The transcription factor functions as a dimer, and mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Dominant-negative mutations typically produce mutant proteins that can still dimerize with the wild-type protein but render the dimer nonfunctional, leading to a loss-of-function phenotype even in heterozygotes. This often involves formation of nonfunctional complexes or aggregates that interfere with normal function. Therefore, the most likely molecular phenotype is protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype. Other options such as loss of dimerization with wild-type phenotype, protein degradation, or gain-of-function are inconsistent with the dominant-negative mechanism described.
