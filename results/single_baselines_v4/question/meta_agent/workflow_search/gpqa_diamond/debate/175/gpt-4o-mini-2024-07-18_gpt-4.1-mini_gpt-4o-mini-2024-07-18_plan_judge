Question: Example(question='The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1), and the operators of two observables P and Q of the system are represented by two square matrices. The matrix corresponding to operator P has the elements in first row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0), elements in the second row as (1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}) and that in third row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0). The matrix operator for Q is represented by the square matrix having elements in the first row as (1, 0, 0), second row as (0, 0, 0) and third row as (0, 0, -1). Now, if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P, what is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements?', choice1='1/2', choice2='1/6', choice3='1/3', choice4='2/3', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The problem involves sequential measurements of two observables P and Q on a quantum system initially in state |ψ⟩ = (-1, 2, 1). First, we find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of operator P. The eigenvalues are 0 and ±1. The eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0 is (1, 0, -1) normalized to (1/√2, 0, -1/√2). The probability of measuring 0 for P is the squared magnitude of the projection of |ψ⟩ onto this eigenvector, normalized by the norm of |ψ⟩. This probability is 1/3. After measuring P=0, the state collapses to this eigenvector. Next, measuring Q on this collapsed state, the probability of getting eigenvalue -1 (with eigenvector (0,0,1)) is the squared magnitude of the projection of the collapsed state onto (0,0,1), which is 1/2. The total probability of measuring 0 for P and then -1 for Q is the product 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6. This corresponds to choice B).
