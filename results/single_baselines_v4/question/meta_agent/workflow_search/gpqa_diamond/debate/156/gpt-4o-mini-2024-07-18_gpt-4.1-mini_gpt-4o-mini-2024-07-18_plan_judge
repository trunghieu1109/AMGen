Question: Example(question='There has been an outbreak of an viral infectious disease in your city. You have been asked to design a molecular diagnostic kit for quick detection of this retrovirus. How would you go about designing this kit?', choice1='First you identify the virus by performing DNA sequencing. You then develop a PCR kit for  quick and accurate diagnosis', choice2='First you identify the IgG antibodies for the infection. You then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG antibodies for quick \n and accurate diagnosis.', choice3='First you identify the virus using the information about the symptoms, provided by the affected patients. You then design a nested PCR kit based on the information for quick diagnosis.', choice4='First you identify the virus by performing cDNA sequencing.  You then develop a real time PCR kit for quick and accurate diagnosis.', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The virus is a retrovirus, meaning its genetic material is RNA. To design a molecular diagnostic kit, the viral RNA must first be reverse transcribed into complementary DNA (cDNA). Then, sequencing of this cDNA can help identify the virus. Following this, a real-time PCR kit can be developed targeting the viral cDNA for quick and accurate diagnosis. Options involving direct DNA sequencing or antibody detection are less appropriate for early and direct viral detection. Symptom-based identification is not molecularly precise. Therefore, the best approach is described in choice 4.
