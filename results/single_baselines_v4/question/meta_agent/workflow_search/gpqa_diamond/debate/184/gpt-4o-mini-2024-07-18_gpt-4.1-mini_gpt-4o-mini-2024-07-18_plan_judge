Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The Hamiltonian is H = ε σ · n, where σ are the Pauli matrices and n is a unit vector. The operator σ · n has eigenvalues ±1 because the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1 along any direction. Multiplying by ε, the eigenvalues of H are ±ε. The factors involving ħ/2 do not appear here because the Pauli matrices themselves represent spin operators scaled by 2/ħ. Therefore, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are +ε and -ε.
