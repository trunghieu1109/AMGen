Question: Example(question='An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. A spontaneous fission occurs in which it splits into two fragments (and nothing else), such that one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other (in terms of their rest-masses). The sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. \n\nKinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?\n\n(Ignore the electrons.)', choice1='10 MeV.', choice2='5 MeV.', choice3='2 MeV.', choice4='20 MeV.', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The problem involves a nucleus of rest mass energy 300 GeV splitting into two fragments with rest masses m1 and m2 such that m1 = 2*m2 and their sum is 99% of the original mass, implying a 1% mass defect converted into kinetic energy (3 GeV total). Using conservation of momentum and relativistic energy relations, the momentum p of the fragments is approximately 20 GeV/c. Calculating the kinetic energy of the heavier fragment relativistically gives about 990 MeV, while the classical kinetic energy estimate is about 1010 MeV. The difference between classical and relativistic kinetic energies for the heavier fragment is therefore about 20 MeV, with the classical approximation overestimating the kinetic energy. Among the given options, 20 MeV best matches this difference.
