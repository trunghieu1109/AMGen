Question: Example(question='Very large number of neutrinos produced by the Sun reach the Earth (very large flux of neutrinos, defined as the number of neutrinos per cm^2, per second).\n\nLet us assume that, hypothetically, the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the core of the Sun about 8 and a half minutes ago, while all other reactions remained as they were.\n\nWhat would be the approximate ratio of the flux between two bands of neutrino energies of 700-800 KeV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). \n\nFlux (band 1) / flux (band 2) is:\n\n(Note: we are talking about stopping the pp-III branch, not pp-II, pp-I or any other. Itâ€™s not a typo or something like that.)\n(Note 2: solar neutrino flavor changes happen, but do not play a role here.)', choice1='0.1 (10^-1).', choice2='10.', choice3='1.', choice4='0.01 (10^-2).', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The pp-III branch produces high-energy neutrinos mainly from 8B decay, with energies typically above 1 MeV. The 700-800 keV band (band 1) neutrinos come mostly from pp-I and pp-II branches, while the 800-900 keV band (band 2) neutrinos are dominated by 7Be neutrinos from the pp-II branch, not pp-III. Stopping the pp-III branch would eliminate 8B neutrinos but these do not significantly contribute to either band 1 or band 2. Therefore, the fluxes in both bands remain roughly the same, and the ratio flux(band 1)/flux(band 2) remains approximately 1. The answers suggesting a ratio of 10 or 0.1 are incorrect because the pp-III branch neutrinos do not significantly populate these energy bands. Hence, the correct answer is 1.
