Question: Example(question='A chemist performs two reactions:\n\nReaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. \n\nReaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.\n\nBoth reactions go to 100% completion. The chemist combines the products of both reactions, and then runs the product mixture on both a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column and a chiral HPLC column.\n\nAssuming that the chromatographic resolution is as high as theoretically possible in both cases, what does the chemist observe in each of these chromatograms?', choice1='4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', choice2='3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice3='2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC', choice4='2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: The reaction of (E)- and (Z)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid leads to epoxide formation and subsequent ring opening to diols. The (E)-alkene forms a trans-epoxide which upon acid opening yields a meso diol (achiral), while the (Z)-alkene forms a cis-epoxide which upon acid opening yields a pair of enantiomeric diols (chiral). Thus, the product mixture contains one meso diol and a pair of enantiomers, totaling three stereoisomers. On a standard (achiral) HPLC column, enantiomers coelute, so the two enantiomers appear as one peak, and the meso diol appears as a separate peak, giving 2 peaks. On a chiral HPLC column, the enantiomers are separated, resulting in 3 peaks total. Therefore, the chemist observes 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC.
