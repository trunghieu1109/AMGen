    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;A chemist performs two reactions:\n\nReaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. \n\nReaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.\n\nBoth reactions go to 100% completion.

### thinking by Debate Agent xMjR:
The reaction of an alkene with mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid) forms an epoxide. For (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxidation will give a trans-epoxide (since the stereochemistry of the double bond translates to the stereochemistry of the epoxide) resulting in a pair of enantiomers due to the formation of a chiral epoxide carbon center. Similarly, for (Z)-oct-4-ene, the epoxidation will give a cis-epoxide, also resulting in a pair of enantiomers. Thus, from each alkene (E and Z), two enantiomers are formed, so a total of 4 stereoisomers (2 pairs of enantiomers). On a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column, enantiomers co-elute (do not separate), but diastereomers separate. Since the epoxides from (E) and (Z) alkenes are diastereomers, the mixture will show two peaks on the achiral HPLC (one for the (E)-epoxide pair and one for the (Z)-epoxide pair). On a chiral HPLC column, enantiomers are separated. Therefore, the two enantiomeric pairs will each separate into two peaks, resulting in four peaks total. Hence, 2 peaks on standard HPLC and 4 peaks on chiral HPLC are observed.

### thinking by Debate Agent xKiP:
The reaction of an alkene with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid typically forms epoxides. For (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene, the stereochemistry of the starting alkene influences the stereochemistry of the epoxide product. 

For (E)-oct-4-ene, epoxidation with mCPBA gives a trans-epoxide (two stereoisomers, enantiomers). For (Z)-oct-4-ene, epoxidation gives a cis-epoxide (two stereoisomers, enantiomers). Since the starting alkenes are geometric isomers, their epoxides are diastereomers of each other. 

Thus, the products are two pairs of enantiomers (4 stereoisomers total): one pair from (E)-oct-4-ene and one pair from (Z)-oct-4-ene. 

On a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC, enantiomers co-elute (not separated), but diastereomers separate. So, the two pairs of enantiomers (diastereomeric pairs) will give 2 peaks. 

On a chiral HPLC column, enantiomers are resolved, so each of the two pairs of enantiomers will be separated into two peaks, giving 4 peaks total. 

Therefore, the chemist observes 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC.

### thinking by Debate Agent vDzD:
The reaction of an alkene with mCPBA forms an epoxide. For (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene, the stereochemistry of the alkene affects the stereochemistry of the epoxide formed. The epoxidation proceeds with syn addition, preserving the relative stereochemistry of the alkene carbons. (E)-oct-4-ene will give a pair of enantiomers (because the epoxidation creates two stereocenters), and (Z)-oct-4-ene will also give a pair of enantiomers. However, the products from (E)- and (Z)-alkenes are diastereomers of each other. Therefore, the mixture contains two diastereomeric pairs of enantiomers (4 stereoisomers total). On a standard (achiral) HPLC column, enantiomers co-elute (same retention time), but diastereomers separate. Hence, the mixture will show 2 peaks corresponding to the two diastereomers. On a chiral HPLC column, enantiomers are resolved, so each diastereomeric pair splits into two peaks, resulting in 4 peaks total. Therefore, the chemist observes 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC.

### thinking by Debate Agent RtOd:
The reaction involves epoxidation of (E)- and (Z)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid, which typically opens the epoxide to form diols. For (E)- and (Z)-alkenes, epoxidation gives different stereoisomeric epoxides. Upon acid-catalyzed ring opening, these epoxides yield diols with different stereochemistry.

For the (E)-alkene, the epoxide formed is trans, and acid opening gives a meso diol (achiral). For the (Z)-alkene, the epoxide is cis, and acid opening yields a pair of enantiomers (chiral diols).

Thus, from the (E)-alkene, one meso diol (achiral) is formed; from the (Z)-alkene, a racemic mixture of two enantiomers is formed.

In total, there are three stereoisomeric diols: one meso and two enantiomers.

On a standard (achiral) HPLC column, enantiomers coelute, so the two enantiomers appear as one peak, and the meso diol appears as a separate peak, totaling 2 peaks.

On a chiral HPLC column, the two enantiomers are resolved into two separate peaks, and the meso diol is a single peak, totaling 3 peaks.

Therefore, the chemist observes 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC.
