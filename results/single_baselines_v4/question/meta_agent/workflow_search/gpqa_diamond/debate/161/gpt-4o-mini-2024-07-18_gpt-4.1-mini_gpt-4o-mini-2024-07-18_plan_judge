proposed answer: The metric given is ds^2 = (32 / (4 - x^2 - y^2)) (dx^2 + dy^2), which is conformal to the Euclidean metric with conformal factor Ω^2 = 32 / (4 - r^2), where r^2 = x^2 + y^2. The domain is the disk r < 2. The area element is dA = Ω^2 dx dy = (32 / (4 - r^2)) dx dy. In polar coordinates, dx dy = r dr dθ, so dA = (32 r / (4 - r^2)) dr dθ. The total area is A = ∫_0^{2π} dθ ∫_0^2 (32 r / (4 - r^2)) dr = 2π ∫_0^2 (32 r / (4 - r^2)) dr. Substituting u = 4 - r^2, du = -2r dr, so r dr = -du/2. Changing limits: r=0 → u=4, r=2 → u=0. The integral becomes 32 ∫_0^2 (r / (4 - r^2)) dr = 32 ∫_4^0 (-du/2) / u = -16 ∫_4^0 (1/u) du = 16 ∫_0^4 (1/u) du, which diverges to infinity due to the logarithmic singularity at u=0. Therefore, the area is infinite. Among the given choices, the correct answer is +∞.
