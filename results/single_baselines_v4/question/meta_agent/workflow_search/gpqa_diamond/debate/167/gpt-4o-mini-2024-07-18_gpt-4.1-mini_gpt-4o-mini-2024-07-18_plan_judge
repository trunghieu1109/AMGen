Question: Example(question='Which of the following issues are the most common sources of difficult-to-spot erroneous results generated in genomics data analysis:\n\n- Mutually incompatible data formats\n- The "chr" / "no chr" confusion\n- Reference assembly mismatch\n- Incorrect ID conversion', choice1='3 and 4', choice2='2 and 3', choice3='All of the above', choice4='2, 3 and 4', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The question asks for the most common sources of difficult-to-spot erroneous results in genomics data analysis among the listed issues. The options include mutually incompatible data formats, the 'chr' / 'no chr' confusion, reference assembly mismatch, and incorrect ID conversion. While incompatible data formats can cause errors, these are usually detected quickly and are less subtle. The other three issues ('chr' / 'no chr' confusion, reference assembly mismatch, and incorrect ID conversion) are well-known for causing subtle, hard-to-spot errors. However, some experts argue that all four issues can contribute to difficult-to-spot errors. Given that three out of four debate agents chose 'All of the above' and one chose '2, 3 and 4', the more comprehensive answer is 'All of the above'. Therefore, the best choice is C).
