Question: Example(question='Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are\nconstrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system\ncorrect to three decimals?', choice1='2.822 x 10^-26', choice2='5.645 x 10^-26', choice3='7.056 x 10^-27', choice4='122.330', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline debate
proposed answer: The problem involves 13 identical particles each with charge 2e, where e = 1.6 x 10^-19 C. One charge is fixed at point P, and the other 12 charges are constrained to be at a distance of 2 m from P. The total electrostatic potential energy is the sum of all pairwise interactions: between the center charge and the 12 charges, and among the 12 charges themselves. Calculating the energy between the center charge and each of the 12 charges gives approximately 5.52 x 10^-27 J. The energy among the 12 charges on the sphere is more complex but can be approximated using the sum over pairs and the geometry of charges on a circle or sphere. This yields an energy on the order of 2.2 x 10^-26 J. Adding these gives a total energy around 2.8 x 10^-26 J. Among the given choices, 2.822 x 10^-26 J (choice A) is the closest and most reasonable answer. Therefore, the minimum energy of the system is approximately 2.822 x 10^-26 Joules.
