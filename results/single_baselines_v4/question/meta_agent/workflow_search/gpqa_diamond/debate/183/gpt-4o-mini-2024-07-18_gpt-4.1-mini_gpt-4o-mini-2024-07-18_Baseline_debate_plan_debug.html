### thinking by Debate Agent Xlyw:
We need to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. Let&#39;s analyze the substituents and their directing effects:

- tert-butyl group is an ortho/para-directing, activating group introduced via Friedel-Crafts alkylation (tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3).
- Nitro group is a meta-directing, deactivating group introduced by nitration (HNO3/H2SO4).
- Ethoxy group (â€“OEt) is an activating, ortho/para-directing group introduced by nucleophilic substitution or via phenol conversion.

Stepwise reasoning:
1. First, introduce the tert-butyl group via Friedel-Crafts alkylation (tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3) to benzene. This directs subsequent electrophilic substitutions to ortho/para positions relative to tert-butyl.

2. Next, introduce the nitro group by nitration (HNO3/H2SO4). The nitro group will go meta to tert-butyl, which is the 3-position.

3. To introduce the ethoxy group at the 1-position, we need a leaving group at that position. One way is to introduce a diazonium salt (from an amino group) and then replace it with an ethoxy group via nucleophilic substitution.

4. To get an amino group at 1-position, we can reduce a nitro group at that position. But since the nitro is at 3-position, we need another route.

Alternatively, we can:
- Nitrate first (to get nitro at 1-position), then introduce tert-butyl at 2-position (ortho to nitro), but Friedel-Crafts alkylation is hindered by nitro group (deactivating), so low yield.

Therefore, the best is:
- First tert-butylation,
- Then nitration,
- Then reduce nitro to amino,
- Diazotize amino group,
- Replace diazonium with OH,
- Then convert phenol to ethoxy via Williamson ether synthesis (NaOH/EtBr).

Looking at the options:
Choice 1: tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3; HNO3/H2SO4; Fe/HCl (reduce nitro to amino); HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration again?);
NaNO2/HCl (diazotization); H3O+, H2O/heat (replace diazonium with OH);
NaOH/EtBr (Williamson ether to ethoxy);
SO3/H2SO4 (sulfonation?);
dilute H2SO4.

Choice 2 and 3 have sulfonation early, which is not necessary here.
Choice 4 starts with nitration, then reduction, then tert-butylation, which is low yield due to deactivation.

Therefore, Choice 1 matches the logical sequence best, despite extra steps.

Hence, the answer is A).

### thinking by Debate Agent hvkM:
We want to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. The target molecule has three substituents: a tert-butyl group at position 2, an ethoxy group at position 1, and a nitro group at position 3. Step-by-step: 1) First, introduce the tert-butyl group via Friedel-Crafts alkylation using tert-butyl chloride and AlCl3. This directs further substitution ortho/para to the tert-butyl group. 2) Next, introduce the nitro group via nitration (HNO3/H2SO4). The tert-butyl group is ortho/para directing, so nitration will occur at position 3 relative to tert-butyl (which is position 2), matching the desired substitution pattern. 3) Then, introduce the ethoxy group at position 1. Since ethoxy is an ether substituent, it can be introduced by nucleophilic aromatic substitution or via diazotization and replacement. The sequence involves converting an amino group to a diazonium salt and then substituting it with an ethoxy group. To get the amino group, the nitro group can be reduced (Fe/HCl) to an amino group. 4) Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) converts the amino group to diazonium salt. 5) The diazonium salt is then replaced by ethoxy group (NaOH/EtBr or related conditions). 6) Sulfonation and desulfonation steps (SO3/H2SO4 and dilute H2SO4) are sometimes used as blocking groups to control substitution positions. Looking at the options: Choice 1 sequences tert-butylation, nitration, reduction, nitration again (which is odd), diazotization, hydrolysis, alkylation, sulfonation, and dilute acid. Choice 2 starts with tert-butylation, nitration, sulfonation, diazotization, dilute acid, hydrolysis, alkylation, reduction, nitration. This seems complicated and repeats nitration at the end. Choice 3: tert-butylation, sulfonation, nitration, reduction, diazotization, nitration, hydrolysis, dilute acid, alkylation. This repeats nitration and sulfonation before and after reduction. Choice 4: nitration, reduction, tert-butylation, nitration, diazotization, sulfonation, dilute acid, hydrolysis, alkylation. Starting with nitration is not ideal because tert-butylation is Friedel-Crafts and sensitive to strongly deactivating groups like nitro. The best logical sequence is Choice 1, which starts with tert-butylation, then nitration, then reduction to amino, then diazotization, hydrolysis, alkylation to get ethoxy group, with sulfonation/desulfonation to control substitution. Therefore, Choice 1 is the correct sequence for high-yield synthesis.

We need to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. The target molecule has a tert-butyl group at position 2, an ethoxy group at position 1, and a nitro group at position 3 on the benzene ring.

Step 1: Introduce the tert-butyl group via Friedel-Crafts alkylation using tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3. This directs further substitution ortho/para to the tert-butyl group.

Step 2: Introduce the nitro group via nitration (HNO3/H2SO4). The tert-butyl group is ortho/para directing and activating, so nitration will place NO2 mainly at ortho or para positions.

Step 3: Introduce the ethoxy group. Since ethoxy is an ether substituent, it can be introduced by nucleophilic aromatic substitution if a suitable leaving group is present, or via diazonium salt substitution.

Considering the options:
- The sequence should start with tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 to introduce tert-butyl.
- Then nitration (HNO3/H2SO4) to add the nitro group ortho or para to tert-butyl.
- Then convert an amino group to diazonium (via Fe/HCl reduction of nitro to amino, then NaNO2/HCl to diazonium), then substitution with ethoxy group (NaOH/EtBr) to introduce ethoxy.

Looking at the choices:
Choice 1: tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3; nitration; Fe/HCl; nitration again; NaNO2/HCl; H3O+, H2O/Heat; NaOH/EtBr; SO3/H2SO4; dilute H2SO4
- Seems complicated and includes sulfonation steps which are not needed.

Choice 2: tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3; nitration; SO3/H2SO4; NaNO2/HCl; dilute H2SO4; H3O+, H2O/Heat; NaOH/EtBr; Fe/HCl; nitration
- Sulfonation and multiple nitrations after Fe/HCl reduction look inconsistent.

Choice 3: tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3; SO3/H2SO4; nitration; Fe/HCl; NaNO2/HCl; nitration; H3O+, H2O/Heat; dilute H2SO4; NaOH/EtBr
- Sulfonation before nitration is not ideal; also nitration twice.

Choice 4: nitration; Fe/HCl; tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3; nitration; NaNO2/HCl; SO3/H2SO4; dilute H2SO4; H3O+, H2O/Heat; NaOH/EtBr
- Starts with nitration on benzene, then reduction, then tert-butylation, which is not ideal because tert-butylation is sensitive to strongly deactivated rings.

Therefore, Choice 1 is the best sequence: First tert-butylation, then nitration, reduction of nitro to amino, then diazotization, then substitution with ethoxy group, with some extra steps possibly for purification or rearrangement.

Hence, the answer is A).

We need to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. Let&#39;s analyze the target molecule: it has a tert-butyl group at position 2, an ethoxy group at position 1, and a nitro group at position 3 on the benzene ring. To achieve this, the general steps are: 1) Introduce the tert-butyl group via Friedel-Crafts alkylation (tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3). 2) Nitrate the ring to add a nitro group, which will go meta to the tert-butyl group (HNO3/H2SO4). 3) Introduce the ethoxy group via nucleophilic aromatic substitution using NaOH/EtBr (ethyl bromide). The order matters because the tert-butyl group is an activating, ortho/para-directing group, so nitration after tert-butylation will give nitro at meta position relative to tert-butyl. Ethoxy introduction should be done last to avoid side reactions. Other steps involving Fe/HCl, NaNO2/HCl, H3O+, SO3/H2SO4, and dilute H2SO4 are not directly relevant or are for other functional group transformations such as reduction of nitro groups or sulfonation, which are not required here. Among the options, choice 1 starts with tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts alkylation), then nitration (HNO3/H2SO4), then Fe/HCl (reduction), then nitration again, NaNO2/HCl (diazotization), hydrolysis, NaOH/EtBr (ethoxy introduction), and sulfonation steps. This seems too complicated and includes unnecessary steps. Choice 2 also mixes steps in a confusing order. Choice 3 starts with tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3, then sulfonation, nitration, reduction, diazotization, nitration, hydrolysis, dilute acid, and finally NaOH/EtBr. This is complicated and includes sulfonation unnecessary for the target. Choice 4 starts with nitration, then reduction, tert-butylation, nitration, diazotization, sulfonation, dilute acid, hydrolysis, and NaOH/EtBr. This order is problematic because nitration first would give nitrobenzene, then reduction to aniline, then tert-butylation, which is not straightforward. The best sequence is the one that starts with tert-butylation, then nitration, then ethoxy introduction. So the best option is choice 1, despite some extra steps, it begins correctly and includes the ethoxy introduction at the end. Therefore, the answer is A).
