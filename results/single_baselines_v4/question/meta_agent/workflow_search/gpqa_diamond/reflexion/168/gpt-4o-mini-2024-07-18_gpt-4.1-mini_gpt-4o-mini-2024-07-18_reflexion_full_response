Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent A3AB', content='In the original decay 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V, the energy spectrum of the E particles is continuous because the energy is shared among multiple particles (E and V), allowing a range of energy distributions. The endpoint Q corresponds to the maximum energy the E particles can have when the other particles carry minimal kinetic energy.\n\nIn the variant decay, one exotic, massless particle M replaces the two V particles, so the decay is 2A -> 2B + 2E + M. Since M is massless and only one particle, the energy and momentum conservation constraints change. The energy spectrum of the E particles remains continuous because there are still multiple particles sharing energy (2E and M), but the shape of the spectrum changes due to the different kinematics.\n\nBecause M is massless and only one particle instead of two V particles, the maximum energy available to the E particles increases, so the endpoint of the energy spectrum increases.\n\nTherefore, the spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
