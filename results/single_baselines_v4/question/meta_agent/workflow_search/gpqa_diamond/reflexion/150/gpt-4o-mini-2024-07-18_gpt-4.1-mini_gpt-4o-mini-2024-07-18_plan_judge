proposed answer: First, normalize the state vector |ψ> = (-1, 2, 1). The norm is sqrt((-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(1 + 4 + 1) = sqrt(6). So the normalized state is (-1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6)).

The observable P is given by the matrix:
P = [[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0],
     [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)],
     [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]]

We need to find the probability that the measurement yields 0. This means we need to find the eigenvectors of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0, then project |ψ> onto that eigenspace and find the squared magnitude of the projection.

Find eigenvalues of P:
Let’s denote x = 1/sqrt(2).

P = [[0, x, 0],
     [x, 0, x],
     [0, x, 0]]

The characteristic equation is det(P - λI) = 0.

Compute determinant:
| -λ, x, 0 |
| x, -λ, x |
| 0, x, -λ |

Calculate determinant:
= -λ * det([[-λ, x], [x, -λ]]) - x * det([[x, x], [0, -λ]]) + 0
= -λ * ((-λ)*(-λ) - x*x) - x * (x*(-λ) - x*0)
= -λ * (λ^2 - x^2) - x * (-λ x)
= -λ^3 + λ x^2 + λ x^2
= -λ^3 + 2 λ x^2

Set equal to zero:
-λ^3 + 2 λ x^2 = 0
λ(-λ^2 + 2 x^2) = 0

So eigenvalues are λ = 0 or λ^2 = 2 x^2
Since x = 1/sqrt(2), x^2 = 1/2
So λ^2 = 2 * (1/2) = 1
λ = ±1

Eigenvalues: -1, 0, 1

Find eigenvector for λ=0:
(P - 0*I) v = 0
P v = 0

Let v = (v1, v2, v3)

From P v = 0:
Row 1: 0*v1 + x*v2 + 0*v3 = 0 => x v2 = 0 => v2 = 0
Row 2: x*v1 + 0*v2 + x*v3 = 0 => x v1 + x v3 = 0 => v1 = -v3
Row 3: 0*v1 + x*v2 + 0*v3 = 0 => x v2 = 0 => v2 = 0 (already known)

So eigenvector for λ=0 is v = (v1, 0, v3) with v1 = -v3
Choose v3 = 1, then v = (-1, 0, 1)

Normalize v:
Norm = sqrt((-1)^2 + 0 + 1^2) = sqrt(2)
Normalized eigenvector |φ> = (-1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2))

Now, project |ψ> onto |φ>:
<φ|ψ> = (-1/sqrt(2))*(-1/sqrt(6)) + 0*(2/sqrt(6)) + (1/sqrt(2))*(1/sqrt(6))
= (1/sqrt(12)) + 0 + (1/sqrt(12)) = 2 / sqrt(12) = 2 / (2*sqrt(3)) = 1 / sqrt(3)

Probability = |<φ|ψ>|^2 = (1 / sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3

Therefore, the probability that the measurement yields 0 is 1/3.
