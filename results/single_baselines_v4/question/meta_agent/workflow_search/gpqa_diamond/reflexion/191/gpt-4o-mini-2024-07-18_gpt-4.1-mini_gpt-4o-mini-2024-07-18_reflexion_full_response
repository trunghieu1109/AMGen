Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent cT7v', content='The spherical conductor is uncharged and has a cavity inside it. A positive charge +q is placed inside the cavity. Since the conductor is a conductor, the charge +q inside the cavity will induce charges on the inner surface of the cavity and on the outer surface of the conductor. However, the conductor as a whole is uncharged, so the total induced charge on the outer surface is -q to balance the +q inside the cavity. From outside the conductor, the entire system behaves like a point charge +q located at the center of the spherical conductor because the conductor shields the inside charges and the net charge outside is zero except for the induced charges on the outer surface. Therefore, the electric field at a point P outside the spherical conductor (distance L from the center of the conductor) is the same as if the charge +q were located at the center of the conductor. Hence, the magnitude of the electric field at point P is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q / L²).\n\nAnswer:D)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
