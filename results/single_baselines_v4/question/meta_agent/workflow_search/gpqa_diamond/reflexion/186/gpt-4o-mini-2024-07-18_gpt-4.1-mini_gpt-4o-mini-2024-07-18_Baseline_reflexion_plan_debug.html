    <pre>First, we need to determine the apparent magnitude of each star to assess if it can achieve a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure with the ESPRESSO spectrograph on an 8m VLT telescope. The key parameter is the apparent magnitude (m), which depends on the absolute magnitude (M) and distance (d) in parsecs via the distance modulus formula: m = M + 5*log10(d) - 5.

Given that the absolute V magnitude for stars c) to f) is 15 mag:
- For star c) at 10 pc: m = 15 + 5*log10(10) - 5 = 15 + 5*1 - 5 = 15 + 5 - 5 = 15
- For star d) at 200 pc: m = 15 + 5*log10(200) - 5 = 15 + 5*2.3010 - 5 = 15 + 11.505 - 5 = 21.505
- For star e) at 5 pc: m = 15 + 5*log10(5) - 5 = 15 + 5*0.6990 - 5 = 15 + 3.495 - 5 = 13.495
- For star f) at 50 pc: m = 15 + 5*log10(50) - 5 = 15 + 5*1.6990 - 5 = 15 + 8.495 - 5 = 18.495

Now, considering the ESPRESSO spectrograph capabilities, it can achieve S/N &gt;= 10 for stars up to approximately magnitude 16 in a 1-hour exposure on an 8m telescope.

Let&#39;s evaluate each star:
- a) Canopus: Very bright star (apparent magnitude ~ -0.7), easily detectable.
- b) Polaris: Bright star (apparent magnitude ~ 2), easily detectable.
- c) Star at 10 pc with m=15: detectable (m &lt; 16).
- d) Star at 200 pc with m=21.5: too faint, not detectable.
- e) Star at 5 pc with m=13.5: detectable.
- f) Star at 50 pc with m=18.5: too faint, not detectable.

Therefore, detectable stars are a), b), c), and e), totaling 4 stars.
