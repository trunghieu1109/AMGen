Question: Example(question='We would like to dissolve (at 25°С) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm3 total volume. What is the minimum volume (cm3) of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution and what is the pH of the resulting solution?', choice1='pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3', choice2='pH 2.69; 30.09 cm3', choice3='pH 3.16; 32.14 cm3', choice4='pH 4.94; 20.40 cm3', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: First, calculate the moles of Fe(OH)3 to be dissolved. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is approximately 106.87 g/mol. Moles of Fe(OH)3 = 0.1 g / 106.87 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 mol. Fe(OH)3 is a base and will react with the strong acid (monobasic, 0.1 M) to dissolve. The reaction is Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe3+ + 3H2O. So, 3 moles of H+ are needed per mole of Fe(OH)3. Total moles of H+ needed = 3 × 0.000936 mol = 0.002808 mol. The acid concentration is 0.1 M, so volume of acid needed = moles / concentration = 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 L = 28.08 cm3. The total volume is 100 cm3, so after adding acid, the pH is determined by the excess H+ or the equilibrium. Since all H+ is consumed to dissolve Fe(OH)3, the solution will be slightly acidic due to Fe3+ hydrolysis. The pH is expected to be around 2.04, matching choice 1. Therefore, the minimum volume of acid is about 28.05 cm3 and pH is 2.04.
