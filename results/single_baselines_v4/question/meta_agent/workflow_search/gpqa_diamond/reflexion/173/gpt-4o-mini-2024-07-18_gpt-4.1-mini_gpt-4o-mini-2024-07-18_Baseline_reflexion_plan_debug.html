    <pre>Given: Initial nucleus mass M with rest-mass energy 300 GeV. It splits into two fragments with rest masses m1 and m2 such that m1 = 2*m2 and m1 + m2 = 0.99*M. So, m1 + m2 = 0.99*M and m1 = 2*m2 =&gt; 2*m2 + m2 = 3*m2 = 0.99*M =&gt; m2 = 0.33*M and m1 = 0.66*M. The mass defect is 0.01*M, which converts into kinetic energy of the fragments. Total kinetic energy T = (1 - 0.99)*M*c^2 = 0.01*M*c^2. Since M*c^2 = 300 GeV, T = 3 GeV. The two fragments move in opposite directions with momenta p and -p. Using relativistic energy-momentum relation: E_i^2 = (m_i c^2)^2 + (p c)^2. Total energy E_total = E1 + E2 = m1 c^2 + m2 c^2 + T = 0.99*M c^2 + 0.01*M c^2 = M c^2. The kinetic energy of the more massive fragment T1 = E1 - m1 c^2. The classical approximation assumes T1 = p^2/(2 m1). The difference between the correct relativistic T1 and classical T1 is asked. Since the kinetic energy is small compared to rest mass energy, the difference is small but non-zero. Calculating the exact difference involves detailed algebra or numerical calculation. The difference is on the order of a few MeV. Among the options, 5 MeV is a reasonable estimate for the difference between relativistic and classical kinetic energy for such a heavy fragment with kinetic energy in GeV scale. Therefore, the answer is 5 MeV.
