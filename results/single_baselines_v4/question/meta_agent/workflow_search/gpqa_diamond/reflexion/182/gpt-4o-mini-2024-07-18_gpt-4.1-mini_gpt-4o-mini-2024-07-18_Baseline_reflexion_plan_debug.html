    <pre>The given compound is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. The reaction with red phosphorus and excess HI is a reduction reaction that typically reduces aldehydes, carboxylic acids, and double bonds to alkanes. The original compound has a cyclohexene ring (one double bond), an aldehyde group, a carboxylic acid group, and a vinyl group (another double bond). The index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) is calculated as the number of rings plus double bonds plus triple bonds. Initially, the compound has one ring, two double bonds (one in the ring and one vinyl group), and two functional groups (aldehyde and carboxylic acid) which contribute to the IHD. The aldehyde and carboxylic acid each contribute one degree of unsaturation. So total IHD initially = 1 (ring) + 2 (double bonds) + 2 (aldehyde and acid) = 5. After reaction with red phosphorus and excess HI, the aldehyde and carboxylic acid groups are reduced to alkane groups, and the double bonds are also reduced. So the product will be a saturated cyclohexane ring with no double bonds and no functional groups. The ring remains, so IHD = 1. Therefore, the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.
