proposed answer: The given metric is ds^2 = (32 / (4 - x^2 - y^2)) (dx^2 + dy^2). This looks like a conformal metric on the disk x^2 + y^2 < 4. The factor 32/(4 - r^2) with r^2 = x^2 + y^2 suggests a metric that blows up as r approaches 2, indicating a boundary at r=2. The question asks for the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. The pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, and the metric given is similar to the Poincare disk model of hyperbolic geometry, but with radius 2 instead of 1. The area element dA = sqrt(det(g)) dx dy. Here, the metric tensor is conformal to the Euclidean metric with conformal factor Omega^2 = 32/(4 - r^2). So, dA = Omega^2 dx dy = (32/(4 - r^2)) dx dy. In polar coordinates, dx dy = r dr dθ, so dA = (32/(4 - r^2)) r dr dθ. The total area A = ∫_0^{2π} ∫_0^2 (32 r / (4 - r^2)) dr dθ. First, integrate over r: ∫_0^2 (32 r / (4 - r^2)) dr. Let u = 4 - r^2, then du = -2r dr, so r dr = -du/2. When r=0, u=4; when r=2, u=0. The integral becomes ∫_{u=4}^0 (32 * (-du/2)) / u = -16 ∫_4^0 (1/u) du = 16 ∫_0^4 (1/u) du = 16 [ln u]_0^4. But ln 0 is -∞, so the integral diverges to infinity. Therefore, the area is infinite. Among the choices, +∞ corresponds to choice A).
