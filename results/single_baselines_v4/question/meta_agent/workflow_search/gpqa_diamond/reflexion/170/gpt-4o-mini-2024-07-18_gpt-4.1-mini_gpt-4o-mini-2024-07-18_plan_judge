Question: Example(question='Substances 1-6 undergo an electrophilic substitution reaction with an excess of bromine (it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed):\n1) ะก6H5-CH3\n2) C6H5-COOC2H5\n3) C6H5-Cl\n4) C6H5-NO2\n5) C6H5-C2H5\n6) C6H5-COOH\nC6H5 - means benzene ring\nArrange the substances in order of increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer.', choice1='3<5<1<6<2<4', choice2='4<2<6<3<1<5', choice3='6<2<4<5<1<3', choice4='4<6<2<1<5<3', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The substituents on the benzene ring influence the para-isomer yield in electrophilic substitution. Strong meta directors like NO2 (4) give the lowest para yield. COOH (6) and COOC2H5 (2) are also meta directors but less strong than NO2. Alkyl groups like CH3 (1) and C2H5 (5) are strong ortho/para directors and increase para yield. Halogen Cl (3) is an ortho/para director but deactivating, so it gives moderate para yield, generally less than alkyl groups. Therefore, the increasing order of para-isomer yield should be: 4 (NO2) < 6 (COOH) < 2 (COOC2H5) < 3 (Cl) < 1 (CH3) < 5 (C2H5). Among the given choices, choice 2 ('4<2<6<3<1<5') is the closest to this order, with only 2 and 6 swapped, which is a minor discrepancy. Hence, choice 2 is the best answer.
