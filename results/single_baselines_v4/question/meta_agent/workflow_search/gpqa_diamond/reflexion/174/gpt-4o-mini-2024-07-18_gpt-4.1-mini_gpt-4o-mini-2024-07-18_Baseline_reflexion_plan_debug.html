    <pre>For an oscillating charge distribution with spheroidal symmetry along the z-axis, the angular distribution of radiated power typically follows a pattern similar to that of a dipole radiation, which is proportional to sin^2(theta). The maximum radiation occurs at theta = 90 degrees (perpendicular to the axis), and zero radiation along the axis (theta = 0 or 180 degrees). The power per unit solid angle f(θ) can be written as A * sin^2(θ), where A is the maximum power at θ = 90 degrees. At θ = 30 degrees, sin(30°) = 1/2, so sin^2(30°) = (1/2)^2 = 1/4. Therefore, the fraction of maximum power radiated at 30 degrees is 1/4. Regarding the wavelength dependence, for an oscillating charge distribution, the radiated power typically scales as λ^(-4), which is characteristic of dipole radiation (Rayleigh scattering). Hence, the correct choice is the one with fraction 1/4 and λ^(-4).
