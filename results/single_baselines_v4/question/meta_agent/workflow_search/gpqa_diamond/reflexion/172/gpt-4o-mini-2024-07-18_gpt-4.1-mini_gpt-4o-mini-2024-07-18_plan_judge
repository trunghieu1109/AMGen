Question: Example(question="If uncertainty in space of electron's location, which is travelling with speed v= 2* 10^8 m/s along x-direction is Δx=0.1 nm . Based on the infromation estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of electron.", choice1='~10^(-19) J', choice2='~10^(-18) J', choice3='~10^(-16) J', choice4='~10^(-17) J', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: Given: Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 × 10^(-9) m = 1 × 10^(-10) m, v = 2 × 10^8 m/s. We need to find the minimum uncertainty in energy ΔE. Using Heisenberg's uncertainty principle for position and momentum: Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ = h/(2π) ≈ 1.055 × 10^(-34) Js. So, Δp ≥ ħ/(2Δx) = (1.055 × 10^(-34)) / (2 × 1 × 10^(-10)) = 5.275 × 10^(-25) kg·m/s. The uncertainty in energy ΔE can be approximated as ΔE ≈ v * Δp (since E = p^2/(2m), but for relativistic speeds, this is an approximation). So, ΔE ≈ 2 × 10^8 m/s × 5.275 × 10^(-25) kg·m/s = 1.055 × 10^(-16) J. This corresponds to choice C) ~10^(-16) J.
