Question: Example(question='In an inactive state, a transcription factor subunit awaits an activation signal from the membrane phosphorylation cascade. Upon phosphorylation on the Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, shuttles into the nucleus, and serves in gene transcription. A missense mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. You observe that a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Which of the following molecular phenotypes is most likely observed in the presence of mutation Y?', choice1='loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype', choice2='protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype', choice3='protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele', choice4='change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The question describes a transcription factor that functions as a dimer. Mutation X in the transactivation domain is recessive loss-of-function, meaning that one wild-type allele is sufficient for normal function. Mutation Y in the dimerization domain is dominant-negative, meaning that the mutant protein interferes with the function of the wild-type protein. Since the protein functions as a dimer, the mutant subunit can dimerize with the wild-type subunit but disrupts its function. This typically results in loss of function despite the presence of one wild-type allele. The dominant-negative mutation likely causes defective dimerization or formation of nonfunctional dimers, leading to a loss-of-function phenotype. Among the options, 'loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype' is inconsistent because dominant-negative mutations cause a phenotype, not wild-type. 'Protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype' is plausible but aggregation is not necessarily implied. 'Protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele' suggests degradation of the wild-type protein, which is less typical. 'Change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype' contradicts the dominant-negative loss-of-function effect. Therefore, the most likely molecular phenotype is 'protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype' (choice 2).
