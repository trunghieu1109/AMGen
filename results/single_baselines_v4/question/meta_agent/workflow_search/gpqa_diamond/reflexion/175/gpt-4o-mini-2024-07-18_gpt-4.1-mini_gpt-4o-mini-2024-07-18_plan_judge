Question: Example(question='The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1), and the operators of two observables P and Q of the system are represented by two square matrices. The matrix corresponding to operator P has the elements in first row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0), elements in the second row as (1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}) and that in third row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0). The matrix operator for Q is represented by the square matrix having elements in the first row as (1, 0, 0), second row as (0, 0, 0) and third row as (0, 0, -1). Now, if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P, what is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements?', choice1='1/2', choice2='1/6', choice3='1/3', choice4='2/3', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: First, we identify the given state vector |ψ⟩ = (-1, 2, 1). The operator P is given by the matrix:
P = [[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]].
The operator Q is given by the matrix:
Q = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -1]].

Step 1: Find the eigenvector of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0.
We solve P|v⟩ = 0|v⟩.
Let |v⟩ = (x, y, z).
From the matrix equation:
0 = P|v⟩ = [ (1/√2)*y, (1/√2)*x + (1/√2)*z, (1/√2)*y ]
This gives the system:
(1/√2)*y = 0 => y = 0
(1/√2)*x + (1/√2)*z = 0 => x + z = 0 => z = -x
(1/√2)*y = 0 => y = 0
So eigenvector for eigenvalue 0 is |v⟩ = (x, 0, -x) = x(1, 0, -1).
Normalize it:
Norm = sqrt(1^2 + 0 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2)
Normalized eigenvector for P=0 is |p0⟩ = (1/√2, 0, -1/√2).

Step 2: After measuring P and getting 0, the state collapses to |p0⟩.

Step 3: Now measure Q on |p0⟩.
Q has eigenvalues 1, 0, -1 with eigenvectors:
For Q=1: (1,0,0)
For Q=0: (0,1,0)
For Q=-1: (0,0,1)

We want the probability of getting Q = -1, which corresponds to eigenvector |q-1⟩ = (0,0,1).

Probability = |⟨q-1|p0⟩|^2 = |(0,0,1) · (1/√2, 0, -1/√2)|^2 = |-1/√2|^2 = (1/√2)^2 = 1/2.

Therefore, the probability of getting 0 for P and then -1 for Q is 1/2.
