Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent VApC', content='The reaction of an alkene with mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid) followed by aqueous acid typically forms an epoxide. For (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene, the stereochemistry of the double bond affects the stereochemistry of the epoxide formed. The (E)- and (Z)- isomers will give different diastereomeric epoxides. Each alkene stereoisomer leads to a pair of enantiomers (since the epoxidation is stereospecific and forms chiral epoxides). Therefore, from (E)-oct-4-ene, we get two enantiomers (a pair), and from (Z)-oct-4-ene, we get another two enantiomers (another pair). Combining both reactions, we have four stereoisomers in total: two pairs of enantiomers. On a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC, enantiomers co-elute (they are not separated), but diastereomers can be separated. Since the two pairs are diastereomers, the standard HPLC will show two peaks (one for each diastereomeric pair). On a chiral HPLC column, enantiomers are separated, so each pair of enantiomers will give two peaks. Since there are two pairs, the chiral HPLC will show four peaks. Therefore, the chemist observes 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC.\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
