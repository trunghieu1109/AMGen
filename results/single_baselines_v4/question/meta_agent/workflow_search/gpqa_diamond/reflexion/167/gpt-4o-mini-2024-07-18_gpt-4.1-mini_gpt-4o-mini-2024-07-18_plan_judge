Question: Example(question='Which of the following issues are the most common sources of difficult-to-spot erroneous results generated in genomics data analysis:\n\n- Mutually incompatible data formats\n- The "chr" / "no chr" confusion\n- Reference assembly mismatch\n- Incorrect ID conversion', choice1='3 and 4', choice2='2 and 3', choice3='All of the above', choice4='2, 3 and 4', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline reflexion
proposed answer: The question asks about the most common sources of difficult-to-spot erroneous results in genomics data analysis. The options given are: 1) Mutually incompatible data formats, 2) The 'chr' / 'no chr' confusion, 3) Reference assembly mismatch, and 4) Incorrect ID conversion. All these issues are known to cause errors in genomics data analysis. Mutually incompatible data formats can cause errors but are often caught early. The 'chr' / 'no chr' confusion (whether chromosome names include the 'chr' prefix or not) is a common source of subtle errors. Reference assembly mismatch (using different genome builds) is a major source of errors. Incorrect ID conversion (e.g., gene IDs) can also cause errors. Since the question asks for the most common sources, and all these issues are common and problematic, the best answer is 'All of the above'.
