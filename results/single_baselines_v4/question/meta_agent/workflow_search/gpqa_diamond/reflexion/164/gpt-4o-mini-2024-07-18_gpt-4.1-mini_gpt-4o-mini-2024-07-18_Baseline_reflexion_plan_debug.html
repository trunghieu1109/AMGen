    <pre>{&#39;question&#39;: &#39;In an industrial research lab, a scientist performs ethylene polymerization with a homogeneous organometallic catalyst system, generating a polymer of high density. He intends to add a second catalyst system to introduce regular branches in the polymer backbone, also only using ethylene as the reactant. He consults a senior scientist, who gives the following statements. “Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US. One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators. Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step. Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.”\nWhich of these four statements is correct regarding the formation of a polymer with regular branches using only ethylene as the monomer and a dual catalyst system?&#39;, &#39;choice1&#39;: &#39;Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.&#39;, &#39;choice2&#39;: &#39;Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.&#39;, &#39;choice3&#39;: &#39;One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.&#39;, &#39;choice4&#39;: &#39;Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.&#39;}

    <pre>The question is about the formation of a polymer with regular branches using only ethylene as the monomer and a dual catalyst system. The senior scientist provides four statements. We need to identify which one is correct. Statement 1 says such combined systems are already implemented industrially in the US, which is true as metallocene and other dual catalyst systems are used industrially. Statement 2 says aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step, but aluminum-based activators (like MAO) are commonly used in olefin polymerization, so this is likely false. Statement 3 says one can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal with specific activators; group VIa metals (like chromium) are used in polymerization, but the key is whether they are used in dual catalyst systems for branching. Statement 4 says certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive; noble metals like palladium can catalyze polymerization but are costly. Among these, the most accurate and widely accepted statement is that such combined systems are already implemented industrially in the US. Therefore, choice A is correct.
