Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent ju0Y', content='Given the total cobalt concentration c(Co) = 10^-2 M and [SCN-] = 0.1 M, and the stability constants β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16 for Co(II) thiocyanato complexes, we need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which corresponds to the species with two SCN- ligands, i.e., Co(SCN)2^0. The overall formation constants are cumulative: β1 = [Co(SCN)]/[Co][SCN], β2 = [Co(SCN)2]/[Co][SCN]^2, etc. We can calculate the distribution of species using the stepwise constants or the cumulative constants. Since β2 = 40, the concentration of Co(SCN)2 is approximately β2 * [Co] * [SCN]^2. But we need to find the fraction of Co(SCN)2 among all cobalt species. The total cobalt is distributed among Co, Co(SCN), Co(SCN)2, Co(SCN)3, and Co(SCN)4. Using the cumulative constants and the given concentrations, we calculate the relative concentrations: [Co] = x, [Co(SCN)] = β1 * x * [SCN], [Co(SCN)2] = β2 * x * [SCN]^2, [Co(SCN)3] = β3 * x * [SCN]^3, [Co(SCN)4] = β4 * x * [SCN]^4. Sum all species concentrations and set equal to total cobalt concentration to solve for x. Then calculate the fraction of Co(SCN)2. Plugging in values: [SCN] = 0.1 M, β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Calculate: Co = x, Co(SCN) = 9 * x * 0.1 = 0.9x, Co(SCN)2 = 40 * x * (0.1)^2 = 40 * x * 0.01 = 0.4x, Co(SCN)3 = 63 * x * (0.1)^3 = 63 * x * 0.001 = 0.063x, Co(SCN)4 = 16 * x * (0.1)^4 = 16 * x * 0.0001 = 0.0016x. Sum = x + 0.9x + 0.4x + 0.063x + 0.0016x = (1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016) x = 2.3646 x. This sum equals total cobalt concentration 10^-2 M, so x = 10^-2 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.00423 M. Then concentration of Co(SCN)2 = 0.4 * x = 0.4 * 0.00423 = 0.00169 M. Percentage of Co(SCN)2 = (0.00169 / 0.01) * 100% = 16.9%.\n\nAnswer:A)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
