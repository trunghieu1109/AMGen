Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent 6XrI', content='Given the state vector |\\psi> = (-1/2, 1/\\sqrt{2}, -1/2) in the basis of eigenvectors of P_z, where P_z is diagonal with eigenvalues \\hbar, 0, and -\\hbar corresponding to the basis vectors. We want to find the uncertainty \\Delta P_z = sqrt(<P_z^2> - <P_z>^2).\n\nFirst, calculate <P_z> = <\\psi|P_z|\\psi> = sum_i |c_i|^2 * eigenvalue_i.\n\nCoefficients c_i are: c_1 = -1/2, c_2 = 1/\\sqrt{2}, c_3 = -1/2.\n\n|c_1|^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4\n|c_2|^2 = (1/\\sqrt{2})^2 = 1/2\n|c_3|^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4\n\nEigenvalues of P_z: \\hbar, 0, -\\hbar\n\nSo, <P_z> = (1/4)*\\hbar + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-\\hbar) = (1/4)\\hbar - (1/4)\\hbar = 0\n\nNext, calculate <P_z^2> = sum_i |c_i|^2 * (eigenvalue_i)^2\n\nEigenvalues squared: \\hbar^2, 0, \\hbar^2\n\nSo, <P_z^2> = (1/4)*\\hbar^2 + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*\\hbar^2 = (1/4 + 1/4)\\hbar^2 = (1/2)\\hbar^2\n\nTherefore, \\Delta P_z = sqrt(<P_z^2> - <P_z>^2) = sqrt((1/2)\\hbar^2 - 0) = \\hbar / \\sqrt{2}.\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
