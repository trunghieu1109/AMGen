Question: Example(question='We would like to dissolve (at 25°С) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm3 total volume. What is the minimum volume (cm3) of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution and what is the pH of the resulting solution?', choice1='pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3', choice2='pH 2.69; 30.09 cm3', choice3='pH 3.16; 32.14 cm3', choice4='pH 4.94; 20.40 cm3', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: First, calculate the moles of Fe(OH)3 to be dissolved: molar mass of Fe(OH)3 = 55.85 + 3*(16+1) = 55.85 + 3*17 = 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol. Moles of Fe(OH)3 = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 mol. Fe(OH)3 is a base and will react with the strong acid H+ as follows: Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe3+ + 3H2O. So, 3 moles of H+ are needed per mole of Fe(OH)3. Total moles of H+ needed = 3 * 0.000936 ≈ 0.00281 mol. Using 0.1 M acid, volume needed = moles / concentration = 0.00281 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.0281 L = 28.1 cm3. The total volume is 100 cm3, so acid volume is about 28 cm3. After neutralization, excess H+ determines pH. Since all acid is consumed by Fe(OH)3, the solution will be neutral or slightly acidic due to hydrolysis. The pH is expected to be about 2.04, matching choice 1.
