Question: Example(question='α-β unsaturated carbonyls have a much more electrophilic carbon double bond. These double bonds act as a good Lewis acid and react with nucleophiles to produce enolate ions. In this case, when a nucleophile attacks the β position, it produces a resonance-stabilized intermediate. When a nucleophile attacking the β-carbon is enolate, such reaction is known as the Michael reaction.\nWhat are the reactants and major final products of the following Michael addition reactions?\ndimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) -->(A)\n1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H3O+) --> (B)\nC + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H2O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice1='A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice2='A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice3='A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione', choice4='A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The Michael addition involves nucleophilic attack at the β-position of an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound. For reaction A, dimethyl malonate acts as the nucleophile adding to methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The product would be a trimethyl propane tricarboxylate derivative with the p-tolyl group attached at the 3-position, consistent with the Michael addition at the β-position. For reaction B, 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine (which can tautomerize to an enamine) adds to (E)-but-2-enenitrile, followed by hydrolysis to give a 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile. For reaction C, the reactant C is likely 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione (a hydroxy derivative of cyclohexane-1,3-dione) which undergoes Michael addition with but-3-en-2-one under basic conditions to give 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. Comparing the options, choice 3 matches these descriptions accurately.
