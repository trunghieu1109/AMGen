Question: Example(question='Astronomers are studying two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2. Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.', choice1='~ 0.4', choice2='~ 0.7', choice3='~ 0.6\n', choice4='~ 1.2', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The problem gives two binary star systems with periods P1 = 2 years and P2 = 1 year. The radial velocity amplitudes are given for each star in both systems: system_1 has K1 = 10 km/s and K2 = 5 km/s, system_2 has K1 = 15 km/s and K2 = 10 km/s. 

Step 1: Total mass M of a binary system can be found from the orbital period P and the semi-major axis a using Kepler's third law: M ∝ a^3 / P^2.

Step 2: The radial velocity amplitudes relate to the masses and inclination, but assuming inclination is similar and orbits are circular, the mass ratio q = M2/M1 = K1/K2.

For system_1: q1 = 10/5 = 2
For system_2: q2 = 15/10 = 1.5

Step 3: The velocity amplitudes are related to the orbital velocity of each star: K1 = (2π a2 sin i) / P, K2 = (2π a1 sin i) / P where a1 and a2 are distances of stars from center of mass.

Also, a1/a2 = M2/M1 = q.

Step 4: Total semi-major axis a = a1 + a2, and K1 + K2 ∝ a/P.

So, a ∝ P (K1 + K2) / (2π sin i). Since sin i is the same for both, it cancels out in ratio.

Step 5: Calculate ratio of total masses:
M1/M2 = (a1^3 / P1^2) / (a2^3 / P2^2) = (a1 / a2)^3 * (P2 / P1)^2

But a ∝ P (K1 + K2), so a1 / a2 = (P1 (K1_1 + K2_1)) / (P2 (K1_2 + K2_2))

Calculate a1/a2:
P1 = 2 years, sum K1+K2 = 10 + 5 = 15 km/s
P2 = 1 year, sum K1+K2 = 15 + 10 = 25 km/s

a1 / a2 = (2 * 15) / (1 * 25) = 30 / 25 = 1.2

Step 6: Now, M1 / M2 = (a1/a2)^3 * (P2/P1)^2 = (1.2)^3 * (1/2)^2 = 1.728 * 0.25 = 0.432

So system_1 is about 0.43 times as massive as system_2, approximately 0.4.

Therefore, the answer is choice1: ~0.4.
