proposed answer: First, normalize the state vector |psi> = (-1, 2, 1). The norm is sqrt((-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(1 + 4 + 1) = sqrt(6). So normalized |psi> = (-1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6)).

The observable P is given by the matrix:
[[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0],
 [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)],
 [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]]

We need to find the probability that the measurement yields 0. This means we find the eigenvectors of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0, and then project |psi> onto the eigenspace of eigenvalue 0.

Step 1: Find eigenvalues of P.
Let’s find eigenvalues λ by solving det(P - λI) = 0.

P - λI = [[-λ, 1/sqrt(2), 0],
           [1/sqrt(2), -λ, 1/sqrt(2)],
           [0, 1/sqrt(2), -λ]]

Calculate the determinant:
= -λ * det([[-λ, 1/sqrt(2)], [1/sqrt(2), -λ]]) - 1/sqrt(2) * det([[1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)], [0, -λ]]) + 0

First minor:
= -λ * (-λ * -λ - 1/sqrt(2) * 1/sqrt(2)) = -λ * (λ^2 - 1/2)

Second minor:
= -1/sqrt(2) * (1/sqrt(2) * -λ - 1/sqrt(2) * 0) = -1/sqrt(2) * (-λ / sqrt(2)) = λ / 2

So determinant = -λ (λ^2 - 1/2) + λ/2 = -λ^3 + (λ/2) + (λ/2) = -λ^3 + λ = λ - λ^3

Set equal to zero:
λ - λ^3 = 0
λ(1 - λ^2) = 0

Eigenvalues are λ = 0, λ = +1, λ = -1.

Step 2: Find eigenvector for λ=0.
Solve (P - 0*I) v = 0, i.e., P v = 0.

Matrix P:
[[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0],
 [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)],
 [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]]

Let v = (x, y, z).

Equations:
0*x + (1/sqrt(2))*y + 0*z = 0 => (1/sqrt(2)) y = 0 => y=0
(1/sqrt(2))*x + 0*y + (1/sqrt(2))*z = 0 => (1/sqrt(2)) x + (1/sqrt(2)) z = 0 => x + z = 0 => z = -x
0*x + (1/sqrt(2))*y + 0*z = 0 => same as first, y=0

Eigenvector for λ=0 is any vector of form (x, 0, -x) = x (1, 0, -1).

Normalize this eigenvector:
Norm = sqrt(1^2 + 0 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2)
Normalized eigenvector |v0> = (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2))

Step 3: Probability that measurement yields 0 is the square of the projection of |psi> onto |v0>.

Calculate <v0|psi>:
= (1/sqrt(2))*(-1/sqrt(6)) + 0*(2/sqrt(6)) + (-1/sqrt(2))*(1/sqrt(6))
= (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) + 0 - (1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6))
= (-1 -1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) = -2 / sqrt(12) = -2 / (2*sqrt(3)) = -1 / sqrt(3)

Probability = |<v0|psi>|^2 = (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.

Therefore, the probability is 1/3.
