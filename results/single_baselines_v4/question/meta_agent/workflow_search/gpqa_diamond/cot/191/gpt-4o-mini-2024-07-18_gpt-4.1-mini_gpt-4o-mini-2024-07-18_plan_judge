Question: Example(question='Imagine an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ having a small spherical cavity inside. The centre of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the centre of the spherical conductor. The radius of the cavity is $r$, and $r<R$. Now consider a small amount of positive charge $+q$ is somehow placed somewhere inside the cavity. What is the magnitude of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at a point P (outside the spherical conductor) of distance $L$ from the centre of the spherical conductor? Note, the distance of the point P from the centre of the cavity is $l$. Here, l, L > R. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\\theta$\n', choice1='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n', choice2='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n', choice3='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\n', choice4='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: The spherical conductor is uncharged and has a cavity inside it. A positive charge +q is placed inside the cavity. Since the conductor is uncharged and a conductor, the charges on it will rearrange to cancel any internal fields inside the conductor material. Importantly, the conductor shields the outside from the internal charge; the net effect is that the conductor plus cavity system looks like a neutral conductor with no net external charge, so the external field due to the internal charge +q inside the cavity is zero. However, the question asks for the magnitude of the electric field at a point outside the conductor at distance L from the center of the conductor. Since the conductor is neutral and the charge +q is inside the cavity, the conductor will induce a charge -q on the cavity surface and +q on the outer surface, making the conductor appear as if it has a net charge +q located at its center from the outside perspective. Therefore, from outside, the electric field looks like that of a point charge +q located at the center of the spherical conductor. Hence, the electric field at a distance L from the center is E = (1/4πε₀)(q/L²). Among the choices, this corresponds to choice4.
