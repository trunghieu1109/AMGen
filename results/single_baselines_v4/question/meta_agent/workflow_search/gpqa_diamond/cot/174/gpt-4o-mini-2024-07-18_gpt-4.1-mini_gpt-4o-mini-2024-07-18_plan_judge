Question: Example(question='Consider an oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis). Because it oscillates, it would radiate at a wavelength \\lambda. In the radiation zone, the radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of \\lambda and the angle \\theta (with z-axis), along which the power is measured. If the maximum power thus radiated is A, the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle \\theta = 30^0 and a possible form of f are, respectively,', choice1='1/2, \\lambda^(-4)', choice2='3/4, \\lambda^(-6)', choice3='1/4, \\lambda^(-4)', choice4='1/4, \\lambda^(-3)', correct_index=2)

proposed answer: The problem involves radiation from an oscillating charge distribution shaped like a spheroid with symmetry along the z-axis. The radiation pattern typically depends on the angle \theta with respect to the axis of symmetry and the wavelength \lambda. The problem gives four choices for the fraction of maximum power A radiated at \theta = 30^0 and the form of the angular and wavelength dependence f(\lambda, \theta). For a spheroidal charge distribution oscillating along the z-axis, the angular distribution of radiated power often resembles the dipole radiation pattern, which goes as sin^2(\theta). At \theta = 30^0, sin^2(30^0) = (1/2)^2 = 1/4. Therefore, the fraction of maximum power radiated at 30 degrees is 1/4. Regarding the wavelength dependence, the power radiated by an oscillating charge distribution typically scales as \lambda^{-4} for dipole radiation. Combining these, the correct choice is the one with fraction 1/4 and wavelength dependence \lambda^{-4}, which corresponds to choice 3.
