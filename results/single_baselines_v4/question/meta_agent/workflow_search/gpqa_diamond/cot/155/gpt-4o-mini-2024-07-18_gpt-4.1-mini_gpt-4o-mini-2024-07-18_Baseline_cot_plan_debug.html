    <pre>The reaction of an alkene with mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid) forms an epoxide. The stereochemistry of the alkene determines the stereochemistry of the epoxide. For (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide formed will be trans (anti) because the substituents on the double bond are on opposite sides. For (Z)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide formed will be cis (syn) because the substituents on the double bond are on the same side. Each epoxide can exist as enantiomers if the molecule is chiral. The (E)-alkene epoxide will give a pair of enantiomers (2 stereoisomers), and the (Z)-alkene epoxide will also give a pair of enantiomers (2 stereoisomers). Therefore, the reaction produces 4 stereoisomers in total (2 from each alkene). On a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column, enantiomers cannot be separated, so each enantiomeric pair will appear as a single peak. Thus, 2 peaks will be observed (one for the (E)-derived epoxide pair and one for the (Z)-derived epoxide pair). On a chiral HPLC column, enantiomers can be separated, so each enantiomeric pair will give 2 peaks. Therefore, 4 peaks will be observed on the chiral HPLC. Hence, the chemist observes 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC.
