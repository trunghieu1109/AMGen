Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent kLLR', content='Given that the number of stars varies with parallax (plx) as 1/plx^5, and knowing that parallax is inversely proportional to distance (r), i.e., plx ‚àù 1/r, we can substitute plx = k/r for some constant k. Then, the number of stars varies as 1/(k/r)^5 = 1/(k^5/r^5) = r^5/k^5, which simplifies to being proportional to r^5. Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance r varies as r^5.\n\nAnswer:D)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
