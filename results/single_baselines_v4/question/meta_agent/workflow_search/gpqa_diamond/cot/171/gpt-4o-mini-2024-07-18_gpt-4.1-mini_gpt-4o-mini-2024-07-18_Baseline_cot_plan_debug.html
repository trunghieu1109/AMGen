    <pre>The problem describes two stars with iron atoms in their photospheres, with the population of atoms in a specific excited energy level being twice as large in star_1 compared to star_2. The energy difference between the considered levels is given as ΔE = 1.38 x 10^(-23) J. Assuming LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the populations of atoms in different energy levels follow the Boltzmann distribution: n_j / n_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (kT)), where k is Boltzmann&#39;s constant and T is the temperature. Since g_j and g_i are the same for both stars (same atoms and levels), the ratio of populations in the excited level between star_1 and star_2 is: n_j1 / n_j2 = exp(-ΔE / (kT_1)) / exp(-ΔE / (kT_2)) = exp[ΔE / k (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)]. Given that n_j1 / n_j2 = 2, we have: 2 = exp[ΔE / k (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)] Taking natural logarithm on both sides: ln(2) = ΔE / k * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) =&gt; ln(2) = ΔE / k * (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2). Since ΔE / k is a constant, the equation relating T_1 and T_2 is: ln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) * constant. The choices given do not explicitly show ΔE/k, but the form matches choice4: ln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2). Hence, choice4 is the correct form.
