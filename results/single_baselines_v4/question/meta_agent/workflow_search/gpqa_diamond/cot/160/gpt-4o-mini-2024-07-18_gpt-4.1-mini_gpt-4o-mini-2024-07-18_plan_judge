Question: Example(question='While designing a high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating at an accelerating voltage of 1000 kV, Mike connected vacuum pumps to create an ultra-high vacuum state (< 10^-9 Torr) in the sample compartment, aiming to minimize the presence of gas molecules for improved electron microscopy. However, as expected, some gas particles remained inside the compartment, as detected by the mass spectrometer. Mike accurately determined the mean free path of these gas molecules in the vacuum state (< 10^-9 Torr) to be λ1, based on factors such as sample compartment volume, pressure, and temperature. However, upon initiating the electron beam, he made an intriguing observation concerning the mean free path based on electron scattering with the gas molecules. He found that the mean free path was no longer equal to λ1; rather, it was λ2, even though the sample compartment temperature remained the same.\n\nWhat can we conclude about λ2 based on the aforementioned scenario?', choice1="λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation", choice2='λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1', choice3='λ2 < λ1', choice4='λ2 >= 1.22*λ1', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The mean free path (λ) of gas molecules in a vacuum depends on factors like pressure, temperature, and the nature of the gas molecules. When an electron beam is introduced, electron scattering with gas molecules can alter the effective mean free path experienced by the electrons. Since the temperature and pressure remain constant, the intrinsic mean free path of gas molecules (λ1) does not change. However, the interaction between electrons and gas molecules can effectively change the scattering mean free path (λ2) for electrons. Generally, electrons have a longer mean free path compared to gas molecules because electrons are much smaller and interact differently. The problem mentions that λ2 is not equal to λ1, and we need to conclude the relation between λ2 and λ1. Given the options, λ2 is generally greater than or equal to 1.22 times λ1, indicating that electrons have a longer mean free path due to their smaller cross-section for scattering compared to gas molecules. Therefore, λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 is the correct conclusion.
