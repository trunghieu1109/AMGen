Question: Example(question='There has been an outbreak of an viral infectious disease in your city. You have been asked to design a molecular diagnostic kit for quick detection of this retrovirus. How would you go about designing this kit?', choice1='First you identify the virus by performing DNA sequencing. You then develop a PCR kit for  quick and accurate diagnosis', choice2='First you identify the IgG antibodies for the infection. You then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG antibodies for quick \n and accurate diagnosis.', choice3='First you identify the virus using the information about the symptoms, provided by the affected patients. You then design a nested PCR kit based on the information for quick diagnosis.', choice4='First you identify the virus by performing cDNA sequencing.  You then develop a real time PCR kit for quick and accurate diagnosis.', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The virus in question is a retrovirus, which means its genetic material is RNA. To detect it molecularly, we need to convert RNA to complementary DNA (cDNA) first. Therefore, sequencing cDNA rather than DNA is more appropriate to identify the virus. After identifying the virus, developing a real-time PCR kit based on cDNA is the most accurate and quick method for detection. Option 1 suggests DNA sequencing, which is not suitable for RNA viruses. Option 2 focuses on antibody detection, which is indirect and may not be the quickest for early detection. Option 3 relies on symptoms and nested PCR without molecular identification, which is less precise. Option 4 correctly identifies the virus by cDNA sequencing and then develops a real-time PCR kit, making it the best choice.
