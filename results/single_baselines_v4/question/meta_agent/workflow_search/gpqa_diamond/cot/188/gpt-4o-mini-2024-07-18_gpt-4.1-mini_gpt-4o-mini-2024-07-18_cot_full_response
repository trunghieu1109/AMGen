Question: {'question': 'Which of the following (effective) particles is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry?', 'choice1': 'Magnon', 'choice2': 'Skyrmion', 'choice3': 'Pion', 'choice4': 'Phonon'}\Pattern: cot
Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent BWyY', content='Spontaneously-broken symmetries in physics often lead to the emergence of effective particles known as Goldstone bosons. Magnons are quanta of spin waves in magnets and arise due to spontaneous breaking of rotational symmetry in spin space. Pions can be understood as pseudo-Goldstone bosons arising from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics. Phonons are quanta of lattice vibrations and are associated with the breaking of continuous translational symmetry in a crystal lattice. Skyrmions, on the other hand, are topological solitons or particle-like configurations in field theories and condensed matter systems, but they are not themselves Goldstone bosons or directly associated with a spontaneously broken continuous symmetry in the same way as magnons, pions, or phonons. Therefore, the effective particle not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry is the Skyrmion.\n\nAnswer:B)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
