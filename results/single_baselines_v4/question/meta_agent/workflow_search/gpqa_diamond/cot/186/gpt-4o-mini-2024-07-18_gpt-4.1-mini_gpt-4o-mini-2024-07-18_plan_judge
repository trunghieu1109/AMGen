Question: Example(question='How many of the stars listed below would be detectable using the ESPRESSO spectrograph, when it is coupled with one of the 8m VLT telescopes at the Paranal Observatory? A star is considered detectable if a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure is achieved.\n\nFor more details about the ESPRESSO spectrograph, please refer to the following link:\nhttps://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/instruments/espresso/overview.html\n\na) Canopus\nb) Polaris\nc) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 10 pc distance from us.\nd) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 200 pc distance from us.\ne) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 5 pc distance from us.\nf) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 50 pc distance from us.', choice1='4', choice2='3', choice3='2', choice4='5', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: First, we need to determine the apparent magnitude of each star to assess if ESPRESSO can detect it with S/N >= 10 in 1 hour. The detection limit for ESPRESSO on an 8m VLT is approximately V~16 mag for S/N=10 in 1 hour exposure. 

For stars with given absolute magnitude (M) and distance (d in parsecs), apparent magnitude m = M + 5*log10(d) - 5.

Given absolute magnitude M=15 for stars c, d, e, f:
- c) d=10 pc: m = 15 + 5*log10(10) - 5 = 15 + 5*1 - 5 = 15 + 5 - 5 = 15
- d) d=200 pc: m = 15 + 5*log10(200) - 5 = 15 + 5*2.3010 - 5 = 15 + 11.505 - 5 = 21.505 (too faint)
- e) d=5 pc: m = 15 + 5*log10(5) - 5 = 15 + 5*0.6990 - 5 = 15 + 3.495 - 5 = 13.495
- f) d=50 pc: m = 15 + 5*log10(50) - 5 = 15 + 5*1.6990 - 5 = 15 + 8.495 - 5 = 18.495 (too faint)

Now, for Canopus and Polaris, both are bright stars (Canopus V~-0.72, Polaris V~1.98), so easily detectable.

Summarizing:
- a) Canopus: detectable
- b) Polaris: detectable
- c) m=15: detectable
- d) m=21.5: not detectable
- e) m=13.5: detectable
- f) m=18.5: not detectable

So, detectable stars are a, b, c, e = 4 stars.
