Question: Example(question='Which of the following issues are the most common sources of difficult-to-spot erroneous results generated in genomics data analysis:\n\n- Mutually incompatible data formats\n- The "chr" / "no chr" confusion\n- Reference assembly mismatch\n- Incorrect ID conversion', choice1='3 and 4', choice2='2 and 3', choice3='All of the above', choice4='2, 3 and 4', correct_index=1)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The question lists several common issues in genomics data analysis that can cause difficult-to-spot errors: mutually incompatible data formats, the 'chr' / 'no chr' confusion, reference assembly mismatch, and incorrect ID conversion. All of these are well-known problems that can lead to erroneous results if not handled properly. Therefore, the most comprehensive answer that includes all these issues is 'All of the above'.
