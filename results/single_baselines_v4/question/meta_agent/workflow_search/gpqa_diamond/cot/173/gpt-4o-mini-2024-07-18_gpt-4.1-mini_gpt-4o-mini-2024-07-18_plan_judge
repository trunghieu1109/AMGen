proposed answer: Given an initial nucleus at rest with rest-mass energy 300 GeV (M), it splits into two fragments with rest masses m1 and m2 such that m1 = 2*m2 and m1 + m2 = 0.99*M. So, the total rest mass is reduced by 1%, meaning 1% of the initial mass energy is converted into kinetic energy. The total kinetic energy T_total = 0.01 * 300 GeV = 3 GeV. The two fragments move in opposite directions to conserve momentum. Using relativistic energy and momentum conservation, we find the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment T1 relativistically and classically. The classical approximation assumes kinetic energy T = p^2/(2m). The relativistic kinetic energy is T = E - m, where E = sqrt(p^2 + m^2). Calculating the difference between relativistic T1 and classical T1 gives the answer. The difference is small due to the large masses and relatively small kinetic energies, and given the choices, the difference is about a few MeV. The correct choice is 5 MeV.
