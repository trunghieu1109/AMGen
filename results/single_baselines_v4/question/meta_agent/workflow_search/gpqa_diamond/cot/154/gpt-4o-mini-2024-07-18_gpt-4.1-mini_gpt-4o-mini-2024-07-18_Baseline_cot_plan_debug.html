    <pre>Given the state vector |\psi&gt; = (-1/2, 1/\sqrt{2}, -1/2)^T, which is an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -\hbar. We want to find the uncertainty \Delta P_z in this state. The operator P_z is diagonal in this basis with eigenvalues \hbar, 0, and -\hbar for the basis vectors. First, calculate the expectation value &lt;P_z&gt; = \langle \psi | P_z | \psi \rangle. Using the components, &lt;P_z&gt; = |c_1|^2 * \hbar + |c_2|^2 * 0 + |c_3|^2 * (-\hbar) = (-1/2)^2 * \hbar + (1/\sqrt{2})^2 * 0 + (-1/2)^2 * (-\hbar) = (1/4)\hbar + 0 - (1/4)\hbar = 0. Next, calculate &lt;P_z^2&gt; = \langle \psi | P_z^2 | \psi \rangle. Since P_z^2 has eigenvalues \hbar^2, 0, and \hbar^2, &lt;P_z^2&gt; = |c_1|^2 * \hbar^2 + |c_2|^2 * 0 + |c_3|^2 * \hbar^2 = (1/4)\hbar^2 + 0 + (1/4)\hbar^2 = (1/2)\hbar^2. Then, the variance (\Delta P_z)^2 = &lt;P_z^2&gt; - &lt;P_z&gt;^2 = (1/2)\hbar^2 - 0 = (1/2)\hbar^2. Therefore, \Delta P_z = \sqrt{1/2}\hbar = \hbar/\sqrt{2}.
