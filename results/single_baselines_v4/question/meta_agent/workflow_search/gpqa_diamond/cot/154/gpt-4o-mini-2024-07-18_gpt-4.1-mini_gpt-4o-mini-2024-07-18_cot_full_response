Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent TiAN', content='Given the state vector |\\psi> = (-1/2, 1/\\sqrt{2}, -1/2)^T, which is an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -\\hbar. We want to find the uncertainty \\Delta P_z in this state. The operator P_z is diagonal in this basis with eigenvalues \\hbar, 0, and -\\hbar for the basis vectors. First, calculate the expectation value <P_z> = \\langle \\psi | P_z | \\psi \\rangle. Using the components, <P_z> = |c_1|^2 * \\hbar + |c_2|^2 * 0 + |c_3|^2 * (-\\hbar) = (-1/2)^2 * \\hbar + (1/\\sqrt{2})^2 * 0 + (-1/2)^2 * (-\\hbar) = (1/4)\\hbar + 0 - (1/4)\\hbar = 0. Next, calculate <P_z^2> = \\langle \\psi | P_z^2 | \\psi \\rangle. Since P_z^2 has eigenvalues \\hbar^2, 0, and \\hbar^2, <P_z^2> = |c_1|^2 * \\hbar^2 + |c_2|^2 * 0 + |c_3|^2 * \\hbar^2 = (1/4)\\hbar^2 + 0 + (1/4)\\hbar^2 = (1/2)\\hbar^2. Then, the variance (\\Delta P_z)^2 = <P_z^2> - <P_z>^2 = (1/2)\\hbar^2 - 0 = (1/2)\\hbar^2. Therefore, \\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{1/2}\\hbar = \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}.\n\nAnswer:C)', prompt=[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nReply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{'thinking': 'Your thinking.', 'answer': 'Your answer.
