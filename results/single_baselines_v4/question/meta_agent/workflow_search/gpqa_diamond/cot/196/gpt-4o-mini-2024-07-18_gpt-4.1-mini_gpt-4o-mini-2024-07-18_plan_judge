Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The IR spectrum shows a broad peak at 3400–2500 cm-1 indicating a carboxylic acid (O-H stretch). The presence of a peak at 1720 cm-1 indicates a C=O stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid. The peaks at 1610 cm-1 and 1450 cm-1 suggest aromatic C=C stretches. The 1H NMR shows a broad singlet at 10.5 ppm (1H) typical of a carboxylic acid proton. The aromatic protons appear as two doublets at 8.0 ppm (2H) and 7.2 ppm (2H), suggesting a para-substituted benzene ring. The aliphatic region shows multiplets and doublets/triplets indicative of a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene ring. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI converts carboxylic acids to alkyl halides, but since the final product is asked, the data corresponds to the starting compound which is a para-substituted benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group. Among the options, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid matches the data best.
