    <pre>Given: 
- First planet radius = 1 Earth radius (not directly needed for the period calculation)
- First planet orbit: circular, impact parameter b = 0.2
- Star radius = 1.5 Solar radii
- First planet orbital period = 3 days
- Second planet radius = 2.5 Earth radii
- Second planet orbit: circular, same orbital plane as the first planet

We want the maximum orbital period of the second planet such that it exhibits both transit and occultation events.

Key points:
- Transit occurs if the planet passes in front of the star from our line of sight.
- Occultation occurs if the planet passes behind the star.
- For both to occur, the impact parameter must be small enough so that the planet&#39;s orbit crosses the stellar disk both in front and behind.

Impact parameter b is defined as b = (a / R_star) * cos(i), where a is the orbital radius and i is the inclination angle (i=90° is edge-on).

For the first planet:
b1 = 0.2
R_star = 1.5 R_sun
P1 = 3 days

Since b = (a / R_star) * cos(i), rearranged:
cos(i) = b * (R_star / a)

We assume the inclination i is the same for the second planet (same orbital plane).

For the second planet to exhibit both transit and occultation, the maximum impact parameter b_max must satisfy:
b_max &lt; 1 - (R_p / R_star)

Because the planet must pass fully across the star&#39;s disk (transit) and also behind it (occultation).

Calculate R_p / R_star for the second planet:
- R_p2 = 2.5 Earth radii
- Earth radius / Sun radius ~ 0.0091577
- R_star = 1.5 R_sun

So,
R_p2 / R_star = (2.5 * 0.0091577) / 1.5 = 0.01526

Then,
b_max &lt; 1 - 0.01526 = 0.9847

Given the inclination is fixed by the first planet&#39;s orbit:
cos(i) = b1 * (R_star / a1)

We need to find a1 and then find a2_max such that:
b2 = (a2 / R_star) * cos(i) &lt; b_max

Since cos(i) = b1 * (R_star / a1), then:
b2 = (a2 / R_star) * b1 * (R_star / a1) = b1 * (a2 / a1)

Therefore:
b2 = b1 * (a2 / a1) &lt; b_max

So:
a2 / a1 &lt; b_max / b1

a2 &lt; a1 * (b_max / b1)

Using Kepler&#39;s third law:
P^2 ∝ a^3

Therefore:
P2 = P1 * (a2 / a1)^{3/2}

Calculate a2 / a1:
a2 / a1 &lt; b_max / b1 = 0.9847 / 0.2 = 4.9235

Calculate P2_max:
P2_max = 3 * (4.9235)^{3/2} = 3 * (4.9235)^{1.5}

Calculate (4.9235)^{1.5}:
= 4.9235 * sqrt(4.9235)
= 4.9235 * 2.219
= approx 10.93

So:
P2_max = 3 * 10.93 = 32.8 days

Looking at choices:
~7.5, ~33.5, ~37.5, ~12.5

Closest is ~33.5

Therefore, the answer is choice B).
