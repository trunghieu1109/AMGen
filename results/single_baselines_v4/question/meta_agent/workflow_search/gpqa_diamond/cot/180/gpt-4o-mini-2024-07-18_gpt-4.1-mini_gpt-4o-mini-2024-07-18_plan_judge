Question: Example(question='Very large number of neutrinos produced by the Sun reach the Earth (very large flux of neutrinos, defined as the number of neutrinos per cm^2, per second).\n\nLet us assume that, hypothetically, the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the core of the Sun about 8 and a half minutes ago, while all other reactions remained as they were.\n\nWhat would be the approximate ratio of the flux between two bands of neutrino energies of 700-800 KeV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). \n\nFlux (band 1) / flux (band 2) is:\n\n(Note: we are talking about stopping the pp-III branch, not pp-II, pp-I or any other. Itâ€™s not a typo or something like that.)\n(Note 2: solar neutrino flavor changes happen, but do not play a role here.)', choice1='0.1 (10^-1).', choice2='10.', choice3='1.', choice4='0.01 (10^-2).', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: The pp-III branch of the proton-proton chain in the Sun produces neutrinos with energies typically above 1 MeV, especially from the decay of 8B neutrinos. The energy bands given are 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV. The pp-III branch neutrinos are mostly above 1 MeV, so stopping this branch would primarily reduce neutrinos in the higher energy range. However, since the question focuses on the ratio of fluxes in the 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV bands, and the pp-III branch neutrinos mainly contribute above 900 keV, the flux in the 700-800 keV band (band 1) would remain mostly unchanged, while the flux in the 800-900 keV band (band 2) would decrease significantly due to the loss of pp-III neutrinos. Therefore, the ratio Flux(band 1)/Flux(band 2) would increase significantly, roughly by a factor of 10 or more, since band 2 flux decreases. Hence, the approximate ratio is 10.
