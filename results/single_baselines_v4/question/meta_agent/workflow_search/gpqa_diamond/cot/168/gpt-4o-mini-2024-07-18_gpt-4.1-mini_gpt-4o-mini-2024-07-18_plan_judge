Question: Example(question='You are studying a nuclear decay which converts two heavy nucleons of flavor A to another flavor B, while simultaneously emitting two much lighter particles E and V. In short, 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V. It is known that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous, with some endpoint value Q.\n\nA variant of this decay emits one exotic, massless particle M instead of the 2V. In this case, how does the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles compare to that of the original decay?', choice1='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint increases.', choice2='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases.', choice3='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.', choice4='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint decreases.', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: In the original decay, 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V, the presence of two lighter particles V emitted alongside the two E particles leads to a continuous energy spectrum for the E particles due to the distribution of energy among multiple particles. The endpoint energy Q corresponds to the maximum energy the E particles can have when the other particles carry minimal energy.

In the variant decay, one exotic, massless particle M replaces the two V particles: 2A -> 2B + 2E + M. Since M is massless and only one particle replaces two, the energy distribution among the outgoing particles changes. The total available energy is the same, but fewer particles share it, which affects the energy spectrum of the E particles.

Because there are fewer particles sharing the energy, the energy spectrum of the E particles remains continuous (since the decay still involves multiple particles), but the shape of the spectrum will adjust due to the different kinematics. Also, since M is massless and replaces two V particles, the total energy available to the E particles can increase, thereby increasing the endpoint energy.

Therefore, the spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.
