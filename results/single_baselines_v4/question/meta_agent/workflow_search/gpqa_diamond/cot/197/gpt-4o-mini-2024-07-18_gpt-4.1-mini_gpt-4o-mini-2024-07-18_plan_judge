proposed answer: We are given the total cobalt concentration c(Co) = 10^-2 M and the thiocyanate concentration [SCN-] = 0.1 M. The stability constants for the complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. These correspond to the formation of Co(SCN)+, Co(SCN)2, Co(SCN)3-, and Co(SCN)4^2- respectively. We want to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex Co(SCN)2 among all cobalt species. First, calculate the concentration ratios using the stepwise formation constants: Let [Co2+] = x, then concentrations of complexes are: [Co(SCN)+] = β1 * x * [SCN-] = 9 * x * 0.1 = 0.9x [Co(SCN)2] = β2 * x * [SCN-]^2 = 40 * x * (0.1)^2 = 40 * x * 0.01 = 0.4x [Co(SCN)3-] = β3 * x * [SCN-]^3 = 63 * x * (0.1)^3 = 63 * x * 0.001 = 0.063x [Co(SCN)4^2-] = β4 * x * [SCN-]^4 = 16 * x * (0.1)^4 = 16 * x * 0.0001 = 0.0016x Total cobalt concentration = x + 0.9x + 0.4x + 0.063x + 0.0016x = (1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016) x = 2.3646 x Given total cobalt concentration = 10^-2 M, so 2.3646 x = 10^-2 => x = 10^-2 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.00423 M Concentration of Co(SCN)2 = 0.4 x = 0.4 * 0.00423 = 0.00169 M Percentage of Co(SCN)2 = (0.00169 / 0.01) * 100% = 16.9% Therefore, the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is 16.9%.
