Question: Example(question='You identified a new quorum-sensing peptide in the bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus. You are highly interested if its role in intercellular communication is conserved among the eukaryotes. You treat yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with the peptide and interestingly observe the formation of the shmoo. You want to learn about the proteome of the active chromatin in the shmoo and recover it by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. The least of proteins from which complex below will you observe in your assay?', choice1='pre-initiation complex', choice2='pre-replication complex', choice3='enhancer protein complex', choice4='nucleosome histone complex', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: The question is about identifying which protein complex would be least observed in an assay targeting the active chromatin proteome in yeast shmoo cells. The assay is chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry, which isolates proteins bound to chromatin. The pre-initiation complex is involved in transcription initiation at promoters and is associated with active chromatin. Enhancer protein complexes are also involved in regulating transcription and are associated with active chromatin regions. The nucleosome histone complex is a fundamental component of chromatin and will definitely be present. The pre-replication complex assembles at origins of replication during the G1 phase but is not necessarily associated with active transcriptional chromatin, and its presence is cell cycle dependent. Since the shmoo formation is related to mating and likely involves transcriptional activation rather than DNA replication, the pre-replication complex proteins would be least observed in the active chromatin proteome under these conditions.
