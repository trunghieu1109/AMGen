Question: Example(question='Consider an aperture, which shapes like a N-sided polygon. All the apothems are of the same length a. When a monochromatic light (of wavelength \\lambda), travelling along z-axis, falls vertically on this aperture, it creates a series of intensity maxima and minima in the far field region. What is the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large ? Assume that the related angles are small so that tan theta = theta approximation can be taken.', choice1='1.220 \\lambda /a ', choice2='0.610 \\lambda / a', choice3='0.500 \\lambda / a', choice4='0.506 \\lambda / a', correct_index=4)
Iteration: Baseline cot
proposed answer: As the number of sides N of the polygon becomes infinitely large, the polygon approaches a circle of radius a (the apothem is the radius). The diffraction pattern for a circular aperture is known. The angular position of the first minimum in the far-field diffraction pattern (Airy pattern) is given by 1.22 * (lambda / D), where D is the diameter of the aperture. Here, the apothem a is the radius, so diameter D = 2a. Therefore, the first minimum occurs at angle theta = 1.22 * lambda / (2a) = 0.61 * lambda / a. The problem asks for the angular distance between the first two minima. For a circular aperture, the first minimum is at 1.22 * lambda / D, and the zeros of the Bessel function (which describe the minima) occur at approximately 1.22, 2.23, 3.24 times lambda / D, etc. The spacing between the first and second minima is approximately (2.23 - 1.22) * lambda / D = 1.01 * lambda / D = 1.01 * lambda / (2a) â‰ˆ 0.505 * lambda / a. This matches closely with choice 4) 0.506 lambda / a. Hence, the angular distance between the first two minima for a circular aperture of radius a is approximately 0.506 * lambda / a.
