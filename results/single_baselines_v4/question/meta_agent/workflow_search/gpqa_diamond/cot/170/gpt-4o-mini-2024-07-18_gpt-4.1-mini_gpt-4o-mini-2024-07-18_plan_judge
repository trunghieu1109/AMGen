proposed answer: The problem involves electrophilic substitution reactions on benzene derivatives with bromine. We need to arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield. The para-isomer yield depends on the directing effects of the substituents on the benzene ring. Electron-donating groups (EDGs) usually direct the substitution to ortho and para positions, increasing para-isomer yield, while electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) often direct to meta positions, decreasing para-isomer yield.

Let's analyze each substituent:
1) C6H5-CH3 (toluene): methyl is an EDG, activating and ortho/para directing, high para yield.
2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (ethyl benzoate): ester is an EWG, deactivating and meta directing, low para yield.
3) C6H5-Cl (chlorobenzene): halogens are deactivating but ortho/para directing, moderate para yield.
4) C6H5-NO2 (nitrobenzene): nitro is a strong EWG, meta directing, very low para yield.
5) C6H5-C2H5 (ethylbenzene): alkyl is EDG, ortho/para directing, high para yield.
6) C6H5-COOH (benzoic acid): carboxyl is EWG, meta directing, low para yield.

Order of increasing para yield (from lowest to highest):
4 (NO2) < 2 (COOC2H5) < 6 (COOH) < 3 (Cl) < 1 (CH3) < 5 (C2H5)

Comparing with choices:
Choice 2: 4<2<6<3<1<5 matches exactly.
