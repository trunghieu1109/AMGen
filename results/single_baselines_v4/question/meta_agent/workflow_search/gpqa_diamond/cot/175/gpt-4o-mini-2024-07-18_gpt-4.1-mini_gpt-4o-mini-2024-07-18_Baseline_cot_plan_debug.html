    <pre>First, the given state vector is |ψ&gt; = [-1, 2, 1]. The operator P has eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and we want to find the probability of measuring 0 for P. The matrix for P is:
P = [[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]].
We want the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0 of P. Let&#39;s find eigenvalues of P.

The characteristic equation is det(P - λI) = 0.

Calculate eigenvalues:
We can write P in matrix form:
P = [[0, a, 0], [a, 0, a], [0, a, 0]] where a = 1/sqrt(2).

Let λ be an eigenvalue, then:
det(P - λI) = det([[ -λ, a, 0], [a, -λ, a], [0, a, -λ]]) = 0.

Calculate determinant:
= -λ * det([[-λ, a], [a, -λ]]) - a * det([[a, a], [0, -λ]]) + 0
= -λ * (-λ * -λ - a * a) - a * (a * -λ - a * 0)
= -λ (λ^2 - a^2) - a (-a λ)
= -λ (λ^2 - a^2) + a^2 λ
= -λ^3 + λ a^2 + a^2 λ
= -λ^3 + 2 λ a^2

Set equal to zero:
-λ^3 + 2 λ a^2 = 0
λ (-λ^2 + 2 a^2) = 0

So eigenvalues are λ = 0 or λ^2 = 2 a^2
Since a = 1/sqrt(2), a^2 = 1/2
So λ^2 = 2 * 1/2 = 1
λ = ±1

Eigenvalues are: -1, 0, 1

Now, find eigenvector for λ=0:
(P - 0 * I) x = 0
P x = 0

P x = 0

Let x = [x1, x2, x3]^T
Then:
Row 1: 0 * x1 + a * x2 + 0 = 0 =&gt; a x2 = 0 =&gt; x2 = 0
Row 2: a x1 + 0 + a x3 = 0 =&gt; a x1 + a x3 = 0 =&gt; x1 = -x3
Row 3: 0 + a x2 + 0 = 0 =&gt; a x2 = 0 =&gt; x2 = 0 (already found)

So eigenvector corresponding to λ=0 is x = [x1, 0, x3] with x1 = -x3
Choose x3 = 1, then x1 = -1, x2 = 0
Eigenvector |p0&gt; = [-1, 0, 1]

Normalize |p0|:
Norm = sqrt((-1)^2 + 0 + 1^2) = sqrt(2)
Normalized eigenvector |p0&gt; = [-1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)]

Now, the probability of measuring 0 for P in state |ψ&gt; is:
P(0) = |&lt;p0|ψ&gt;|^2

Calculate inner product &lt;p0|ψ&gt;:
&lt;p0|ψ&gt; = (-1/sqrt(2)) * (-1) + 0 * 2 + (1/sqrt(2)) * 1 = (1/sqrt(2)) + 0 + (1/sqrt(2)) = 2 / sqrt(2) = sqrt(2)

Then probability:
P(0) = |sqrt(2)|^2 = 2
Wait, this is more than 1, so check normalization of |ψ&gt;.

Normalize |ψ&gt;:
|ψ|^2 = (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6
Normalized |ψ&gt; = [-1/√6, 2/√6, 1/√6]

Recalculate &lt;p0|ψ&gt;:
= (-1/√2)*(-1/√6) + 0 * (2/√6) + (1/√2)*(1/√6) = (1)/(√12) + 0 + (1)/(√12) = 2/(√12) = 2/(2*√3) = 1/√3

Probability P(0) = |1/√3|^2 = 1/3

Now, after measuring P and getting 0, the state collapses to |p0&gt;.

Next, measure Q on |p0&gt;.

Q = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -1]]

Eigenvalues of Q are 1, 0, -1.

We want the probability of measuring -1 for Q in state |p0&gt;.

Eigenvector for Q with eigenvalue -1 is |q(-1)&gt; = [0, 0, 1]

Probability of measuring -1 for Q in state |p0&gt; is:
|&lt;q(-1)|p0&gt;|^2

Calculate &lt;q(-1)|p0&gt;:
= [0, 0, 1] * [-1/√2, 0, 1/√2]^T = 1/√2

Probability = (1/√2)^2 = 1/2

Therefore, the total probability of first measuring 0 for P and then -1 for Q is:
P = P(0 for P) * P(-1 for Q after collapse) = (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6

Among the given choices, 1/6 corresponds to choice B).
