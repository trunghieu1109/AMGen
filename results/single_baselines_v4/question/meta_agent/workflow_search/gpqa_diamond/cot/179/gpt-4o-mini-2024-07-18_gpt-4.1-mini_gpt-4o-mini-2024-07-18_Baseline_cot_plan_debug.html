    <pre>We have 13 identical particles each with charge 2e, where e is the elementary charge (approximately 1.6 x 10^-19 C). 12 particles are constrained to be at a distance of 2 m from a point P, and the 13th charge is fixed at P. We need to find the minimum energy of this system. The system&#39;s potential energy comes from the electrostatic potential energy between each pair of charges. Since 12 charges are at distance 2 m from P, and the 13th charge is at P, the distance between the 13th charge and each of the 12 charges is 2 m. The distance between the 12 charges themselves will be greater than or equal to some value, but since they are constrained to a sphere of radius 2 m around P, the minimum energy configuration will minimize repulsion among the 12 charges as well. For simplicity, let&#39;s first calculate the energy between the 13th charge and the 12 charges. The potential energy between two charges q1 and q2 separated by distance r is U = k * q1 * q2 / r, where k = 1/(4 * pi * epsilon_0) â‰ˆ 8.99 x 10^9 N m^2/C^2. Each charge q = 2e = 2 * 1.6 x 10^-19 C = 3.2 x 10^-19 C. Energy between 13th charge and one charge at distance 2 m: U1 = k * q * q / r = 8.99 x 10^9 * (3.2 x 10^-19)^2 / 2. Calculate (3.2 x 10^-19)^2 = (3.2)^2 x (10^-19)^2 = 10.24 x 10^-38 = 1.024 x 10^-37. So U1 = 8.99 x 10^9 * 1.024 x 10^-37 / 2 = (8.99 x 10^9 / 2) * 1.024 x 10^-37 = 4.495 x 10^9 * 1.024 x 10^-37 = approximately 4.6 x 10^-28 J per pair. There are 12 such pairs between the 13th charge and the 12 charges: U_total_13th = 12 * 4.6 x 10^-28 = 5.52 x 10^-27 J. Next, consider the energy between the 12 charges themselves. They are all on a sphere of radius 2 m, so the distances between them will vary, but the minimum energy configuration will minimize repulsion. For simplicity, assume average distance between these charges is approximately 2 m (this is an approximation). Number of pairs among 12 charges is C(12,2) = 66. Each pair energy: same as above U1 = 4.6 x 10^-28 J. So total energy between the 12 charges: U_12 = 66 * 4.6 x 10^-28 = 3.036 x 10^-26 J. Total energy of the system: U_total = U_total_13th + U_12 = 5.52 x 10^-27 + 3.036 x 10^-26 = approx 3.588 x 10^-26 J. Among the given choices, 2.822 x 10^-26 and 5.645 x 10^-26 are close to this value, and 3.588 x 10^-26 is between these two. Since our approximate calculation is closer to 2.822 x 10^-26, and considering the minimal energy configuration, the minimum energy should be closest to 2.822 x 10^-26 J.
