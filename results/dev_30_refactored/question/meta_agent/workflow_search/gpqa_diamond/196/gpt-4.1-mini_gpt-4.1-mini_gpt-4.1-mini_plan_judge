Iteration: Test New Architecture_196
proposed answer: The IR spectrum shows a broad band from 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ and a strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicating the presence of a carboxylic acid group in the starting compound. The aromatic C=C stretches at 1610 and 1450 cm⁻¹ confirm an aromatic ring. The 1H NMR data shows a broad singlet at 10.5 ppm (1H) consistent with the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid, and two doublets at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm (each integrating to 2H) indicating a para-substituted benzene ring. The aliphatic signals at 2.9, 1.7, 1.4, and 0.9 ppm correspond well to a sec-butyl group. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI is known to reduce carboxylic acids to methyl groups by removing the carboxyl carbon, while leaving alkyl substituents intact. Evaluating the options: Choice 2 is the starting acid, so it cannot be the product after reduction. Choice 3 has a different substitution pattern and functional groups inconsistent with the data. Choice 4 has an isobutyl substituent, which does not match the NMR data indicating a sec-butyl group. Choice 1, 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, matches the expected product after reduction of the carboxylic acid to a methyl group, retaining the sec-butyl substituent and para substitution pattern. This conclusion is consistent with the spectral data, reaction mechanism, and substituent stability. Therefore, the most reliable and consistent answer is Choice 1.
