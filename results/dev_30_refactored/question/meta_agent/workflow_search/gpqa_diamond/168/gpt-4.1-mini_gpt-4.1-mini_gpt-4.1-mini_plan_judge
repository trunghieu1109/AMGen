Question: Example(question='You are studying a nuclear decay which converts two heavy nucleons of flavor A to another flavor B, while simultaneously emitting two much lighter particles E and V. In short, 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V. It is known that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous, with some endpoint value Q.\n\nA variant of this decay emits one exotic, massless particle M instead of the 2V. In this case, how does the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles compare to that of the original decay?', choice1='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint increases.', choice2='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases.', choice3='The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.', choice4='The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint decreases.', correct_index=3)
Iteration: Test New Architecture_168
proposed answer: The original decay 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V involves multiple final state particles, resulting in a continuous energy spectrum for the E particles because the total decay energy is shared among several particles, allowing a range of possible energy distributions. The endpoint Q represents the maximum energy the E particles can have when the other particles carry minimal kinetic energy. In the variant decay 2A -> 2B + 2E + M, the two V particles are replaced by a single massless particle M. Since M is massless, it has zero rest mass energy and only kinetic energy, which reduces the total rest mass energy carried away by the non-E particles. This effectively increases the kinetic energy available to the E particles and the recoiling nucleons. Because there are still multiple particles in the final state (2E and M), the energy spectrum of the E particles remains continuous; the energy and momentum can still be shared in various ways among the multiple final state particles. The shape of the energy spectrum changes due to the altered phase space from replacing two massive particles with one massless particle. The endpoint of the E energy spectrum increases because the massless M particle allows more energy to be available to the E particles, raising their maximum possible energy. Choices suggesting the spectrum becomes discrete or that the endpoint decreases contradict the physical principles of energy-momentum conservation and phase space considerations in multi-particle decays. Therefore, the best choice is that the spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.
