proposed answer: The given metric is ds^2 = (32 / (4 - x^2 - y^2)) (dx^2 + dy^2), defined on the disk x^2 + y^2 < 4. This metric is conformally equivalent to the Euclidean metric with conformal factor Omega^2 = 32 / (4 - r^2), where r^2 = x^2 + y^2. The area element dA under this metric is given by dA = Omega^2 dx dy = (32 / (4 - r^2)) dx dy. Converting to polar coordinates (r, theta), dx dy = r dr dtheta, so dA = (32 r) / (4 - r^2) dr dtheta. To find the total area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2, we integrate over theta from 0 to 2pi and r from 0 to 2: A = ∫_0^{2pi} ∫_0^2 (32 r) / (4 - r^2) dr dtheta. Evaluating the inner integral I = ∫_0^2 (32 r) / (4 - r^2) dr, we substitute u = 4 - r^2, so du = -2 r dr, which implies r dr = -du/2. Changing limits accordingly: when r=0, u=4; when r=2, u=0. Thus, I = ∫_4^0 (32 / u)(-du/2) = -16 ∫_4^0 (1/u) du = 16 ∫_0^4 (1/u) du. The integral ∫_0^4 (1/u) du diverges at u=0 (corresponding to r=2), indicating the area integral diverges to infinity. This divergence is consistent with the geometric interpretation of the pseudosphere or hyperbolic disk models, where the boundary circle corresponds to infinite distance and infinite area. The other choices (finite expressions involving x and y or zero) do not match the integral's behavior. Therefore, the total area is infinite, and the best matching answer choice is +∞. There are no alternative cases because the integral's divergence is intrinsic to the metric and domain. Hence, the correct and fully justified conclusion is that the area of the pseudosphere of radius 2 under the given metric is infinite.
