Question: Example(question='Very large number of neutrinos produced by the Sun reach the Earth (very large flux of neutrinos, defined as the number of neutrinos per cm^2, per second).\n\nLet us assume that, hypothetically, the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the core of the Sun about 8 and a half minutes ago, while all other reactions remained as they were.\n\nWhat would be the approximate ratio of the flux between two bands of neutrino energies of 700-800 KeV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). \n\nFlux (band 1) / flux (band 2) is:\n\n(Note: we are talking about stopping the pp-III branch, not pp-II, pp-I or any other. Itâ€™s not a typo or something like that.)\n(Note 2: solar neutrino flavor changes happen, but do not play a role here.)', choice1='0.1 (10^-1).', choice2='10.', choice3='1.', choice4='0.01 (10^-2).', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: The pp-III branch of the solar proton-proton chain produces neutrinos predominantly in the higher energy range, specifically contributing significantly to the 800-900 keV band (band 2). When the pp-III branch stops, the flux of neutrinos in band 2 drastically decreases because this branch is the main source of neutrinos in that energy range. Meanwhile, the 700-800 keV band (band 1) neutrinos are primarily produced by other branches (pp-I and pp-II), which continue unaffected. Therefore, the flux in band 1 remains nearly the same, while the flux in band 2 approaches zero. This leads to a very large ratio of Flux(band 1) / Flux(band 2). Among the given options, the only one representing a large ratio (much greater than 1) is 10 (choice B). The other options (0.1, 1, 0.01) represent ratios less than or equal to 1, which contradicts the expected drastic reduction in band 2 flux. Hence, the correct approximate ratio is 10.
