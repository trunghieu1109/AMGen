proposed answer: The Mott-Gurney equation describes the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) in a semiconductor device under ideal conditions. These conditions include: the device must be trap-free to avoid carrier trapping effects; it must be a single-carrier device because the equation assumes conduction by one type of charge carrier; the contacts must be Ohmic to ensure negligible injection barriers and free carrier injection; and diffusion current must be negligible compared to drift current, as the equation assumes drift current dominance. Evaluating the options: Choice 1 correctly states all these conditions. Choice 2 incorrectly states negligible drift current, which contradicts the SCLC regime. Choice 3 involves a two-carrier device, violating the single-carrier assumption. Choice 4 involves a Schottky contact, which introduces an injection barrier, violating the Ohmic contact assumption. Therefore, only Choice 1 is valid for the Mott-Gurney equation.
