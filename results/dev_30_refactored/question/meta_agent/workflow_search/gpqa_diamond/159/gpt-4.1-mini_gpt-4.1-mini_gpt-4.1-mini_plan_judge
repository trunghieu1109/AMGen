Question: Example(question='Consider an aperture, which shapes like a N-sided polygon. All the apothems are of the same length a. When a monochromatic light (of wavelength \\lambda), travelling along z-axis, falls vertically on this aperture, it creates a series of intensity maxima and minima in the far field region. What is the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large ? Assume that the related angles are small so that tan theta = theta approximation can be taken.', choice1='1.220 \\lambda /a ', choice2='0.610 \\lambda / a', choice3='0.500 \\lambda / a', choice4='0.506 \\lambda / a', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: The problem asks for the angular distance between the first two minima in the far-field diffraction pattern of an aperture shaped as an N-sided polygon with apothem length a, in the limit as N approaches infinity. As N becomes very large, the polygon approaches a circular aperture of radius a. The diffraction pattern of a circular aperture is well-known and described by the Airy pattern. The intensity minima correspond to the zeros of the Bessel function J1. The angular positions θ of these minima satisfy the relation 2πaθ/λ = α_n, where α_n are the zeros of J1. The first two zeros of J1 are approximately 3.8317 and 7.0156. Therefore, the first minimum angle is θ_1 = 3.8317 λ / (2π a) ≈ 0.61 λ / a, and the second minimum angle is θ_2 = 7.0156 λ / (2π a) ≈ 1.115 λ / a. The angular distance between these two minima is θ_2 - θ_1 = (7.0156 - 3.8317) λ / (2π a) ≈ 0.506 λ / a. This matches choice 4 (0.506 λ / a). The small angle approximation tan θ ≈ θ is valid and consistent with the problem statement. Other choices correspond to either the position of the first minimum alone or unrelated values. This reasoning is consistent with well-established diffraction theory and the Airy disk pattern for a circular aperture, which the polygon approaches as N → ∞. Hence, the selected answer choice D (0.506 λ / a) is correct, consistent with physical principles, and complies with the problem assumptions.
