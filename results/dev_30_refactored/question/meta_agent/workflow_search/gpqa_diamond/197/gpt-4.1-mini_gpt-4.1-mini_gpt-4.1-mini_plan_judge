proposed answer: The problem involves calculating the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, Co(SCN)2, among all cobalt species in solution. Given the total cobalt concentration c(Co) = 10^-2 M, thiocyanate concentration [SCN-] = 0.1 M, and cumulative stability constants β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16, we use the equilibrium expressions for complex formation. The total cobalt concentration is the sum of free Co2+ and all complexes: c(Co) = [Co2+] * (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4). Substituting values: 0.01 = [Co2+] * (1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016) = [Co2+] * 2.3646, so [Co2+] ≈ 4.23 x 10^-3 M. The concentration of the dithiocyanato complex is [Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co2+] * [SCN-]^2 = 40 * 4.23 x 10^-3 * 0.01 = 1.69 x 10^-3 M. The percentage is (1.69 x 10^-3 / 10^-2) * 100% = 16.9%. This matches option A exactly. Other options are significantly different and inconsistent with the given data. Therefore, the correct answer is 16.9%. This conclusion considers the cumulative stability constants, the ligand concentration, and the total cobalt concentration, ensuring a physically consistent result.
