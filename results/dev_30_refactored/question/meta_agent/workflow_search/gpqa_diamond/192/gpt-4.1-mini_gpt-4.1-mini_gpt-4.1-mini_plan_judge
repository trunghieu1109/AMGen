proposed answer: The problem states that the number of stars varies with parallax (plx) as 1/plx^5. Parallax and distance are inversely related, with plx = 1/r. Substituting this into the expression for the number of stars per unit parallax gives N(plx) ~ 1/(1/r)^5 = r^5. However, this is the distribution per unit parallax, not per unit distance. To convert this to the number of stars per unit distance, we use the change of variables formula for distributions: N(r) = N(plx) * |d(plx)/d(r)|. Calculating the derivative, d(plx)/d(r) = d(1/r)/d(r) = -1/r^2, and taking the absolute value gives |d(plx)/d(r)| = 1/r^2. Multiplying these, N(r) = r^5 * (1/r^2) = r^3. Thus, the number of stars per unit distance varies as r^3. This makes physical sense since the volume of a spherical shell at radius r scales as r^2, and the given parallax dependence adds an extra factor of r, resulting in an overall r^3 dependence. Alternative interpretations that neglect the Jacobian or misapply the inverse relation would yield incorrect powers such as r^5 or r^2, which do not match the problem's conditions. Therefore, the final formula for the number of stars per unit distance r is proportional to r^3.

proposed answer: The problem states that the number of stars varies with parallax (plx) as 1/plx^5. Parallax and distance are inversely related by plx = 1/r (assuming appropriate units). The given relationship likely represents the cumulative number of stars with parallax greater than a certain value, i.e., N(>plx) ~ plx^{-5}. To find the number of stars per unit parallax interval, we differentiate the cumulative distribution: dN/d(plx) ~ plx^{-6}. Substituting plx = 1/r gives dN/d(plx) ~ (1/r)^{-6} = r^6. To convert this to the number of stars per unit distance interval, we use the change of variables formula: dN/dr = dN/d(plx) * |d(plx)/d(r)|. Since plx = 1/r, d(plx)/d(r) = -1/r^2, and its absolute value is 1/r^2. Therefore, dN/dr ~ r^6 * (1/r^2) = r^4. This means the number of stars per unit distance interval varies as r^4. This result is physically plausible because the volume of space increases as r^3, and a distribution increasing faster than r^3 suggests a density increasing with distance or a selection effect. The derivation carefully accounts for the inverse relation between parallax and distance and the necessary differentiation and variable change. Hence, the final formula for the number of stars per unit distance interval r is proportional to r^4, which corresponds to choice B.
