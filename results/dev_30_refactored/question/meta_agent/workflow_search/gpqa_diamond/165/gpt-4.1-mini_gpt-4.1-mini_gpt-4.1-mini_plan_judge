proposed answer: The final mass formula for the pseudo-Goldstone boson H_2 must be dimensionally consistent, physically complete, and theoretically justified. The mass squared M_{h_2}^2 should have dimension of mass squared. Radiative corrections at one-loop level typically scale as a sum of mass^4 terms divided by a symmetry breaking scale squared, multiplied by a loop factor 1/(8\pi^2). The symmetry breaking scale here is given by (x^2 + v^2), where x and v are vacuum expectation values with dimension of mass. Therefore, the formula should be proportional to 1/(8\pi^2 (x^2 + v^2)) times a sum of mass^4 terms. Among the four choices, choice 4 is dimensionally inconsistent because it multiplies by (x^2 + v^2)/(8\pi^2), resulting in dimension mass^6, which is incorrect for a mass squared quantity. The formula should include all relevant particle contributions with correct signs: bosonic loops (h_1, W, Z, H^\pm, H^0, A^0) contribute positively, while fermionic loops (top quark t, singlet fermions N_i) contribute negatively. Choice 1 omits the top quark term, which is significant due to its large Yukawa coupling and strong effect on radiative corrections. Choice 2 includes the top quark but omits the pseudoscalar A^0 contribution, which is important in extended scalar sectors. Choice 3 includes all relevant terms with correct signs and coefficients, making it the most theoretically consistent, dimensionally correct, and physically complete formula. The coefficients \alpha_i are model-dependent constants reflecting coupling strengths and multiplicities and are kept symbolic for generality. The final expression is already in a clear, standard form and requires no further algebraic simplification. Omitting significant contributions or incorrect dimensional factors would make the formula incomplete or incorrect. Therefore, the validated and correct formula for the pseudo-Goldstone boson mass squared through radiative corrections is choice 3.
