proposed answer: The Hamiltonian operator is given as H = ε (σ · n), where σ = (σ_x, σ_y, σ_z) are the Pauli spin matrices and n is a unit vector. The Pauli matrices are dimensionless Hermitian operators with eigenvalues ±1. Since n is a unit vector, the operator σ · n is a Hermitian operator whose eigenvalues are also ±1. This follows from the fact that (σ · n)^2 = I, the identity operator, implying eigenvalues ±1. Multiplying by ε, which has dimensions of energy, scales these eigenvalues to ±ε. The confusion sometimes arises because the physical spin operator S is defined as S = (ħ/2)σ, which would introduce factors of ħ/2 in eigenvalues if the Hamiltonian were expressed in terms of S. However, the problem explicitly defines the Hamiltonian in terms of σ, not S, so the eigenvalues do not include ħ/2. The choices involving ±ε ħ/2 or ±ħ/2 correspond to eigenvalues of the spin operator S or other scaled versions, which are not applicable here. The dimensionless ±1 eigenvalues correspond to σ · n without scaling, which also does not match the given Hamiltonian. Therefore, the correct eigenvalues must be ±ε. This conclusion is consistent regardless of the direction of n, as n is a unit vector, and the eigenvalues depend only on the magnitude of the operator, which is ε times ±1. All expert analyses and agents agree on this point, reinforcing the correctness of this conclusion. Hence, the best matching answer choice is A: +ε, -ε.
