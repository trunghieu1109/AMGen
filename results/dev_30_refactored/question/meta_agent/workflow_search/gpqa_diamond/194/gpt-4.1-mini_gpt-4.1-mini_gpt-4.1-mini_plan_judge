Question: Example(question='Astronomers are observing a planet with a radius of 1 Earth radius in a circular orbit, with a transit impact parameter of 0.2, around a star that has a radius 1.5 times that of the Sun. This planet has an orbital period of 3 days. What is the maximum orbital period of a second planet, with a radius of 2.5 times that of Earth, in the same system that will exhibit both transit and occultation events? Assume that the second planet also has a circular orbit and shares the same orbital plane as the previously mentioned transiting planet.', choice1='~ 7.5', choice2='~ 33.5', choice3='~ 37.5', choice4='~ 12.5', correct_index=2)
Iteration: Test New Architecture_194
proposed answer: The maximum orbital period of the second planet that exhibits both transit and occultation events is constrained by the orbital geometry and the impact parameter limits. Given the first planet's impact parameter (b=0.2) and the star's radius (1.5 times the Sun's radius), we calculate the inclination of the orbital plane. The second planet shares this inclination due to coplanarity. For the second planet to show both transit and occultation, its impact parameter must be less than or equal to 1 minus the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius, ensuring the planet's disk fully crosses the stellar disk during both events. Using Kepler's third law and the maximum orbital radius derived from the impact parameter constraint, the maximum orbital period is approximately 33.5 days. This matches choice B. Other choices are either too small or too large compared to the calculated value. Therefore, the correct answer is choice B (~33.5 days). All possible cases are considered: the inclination is fixed by the first planet's transit geometry; the planet size reduces the maximum impact parameter; circular orbits simplify the geometry; and the star's mass is assumed solar for Kepler's law.
