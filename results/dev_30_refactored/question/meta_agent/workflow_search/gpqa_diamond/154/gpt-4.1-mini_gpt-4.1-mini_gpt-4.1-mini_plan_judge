Question: Example(question='Imagine an operator $\\vec{P}$ of a system have components $P_x, P_y$ and $P_z$. The matrix form of the  operator $P_x$ has components in the first row as $(0, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,\\hbar/\\sqrt{2},0)$.  The matrix form of the  operator $P_y$ has components in the first row as $(0, -i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0, -i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2},0)$. Similarly, matrix form of the  operator $P_z$ has components in the first row as $(\\hbar, 0, 0)$, that in the second row as $(0, 0, 0)$ and that in the third row as $(0,0, -\\hbar)$. The basis vectors here are the eigenvectors of $P_z$. The system is found in the eigenstate of $P_x$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$. To be more specific, the explicit form of the state of the system is given by the column vector having elements $(-1/2, 1/\\sqrt{2}, -1/2)$. What is the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z $ of $P_z$', choice1='\\hbar\n', choice2='\\hbar/2', choice3='\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}\n', choice4='\\sqrt{2}\\hbar', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: To determine the uncertainty ΔPz of the operator Pz in the given state, we use the standard quantum mechanical definition of uncertainty: (ΔPz)^2 = ⟨Pz^2⟩ - ⟨Pz⟩^2. The state vector is given as (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2) in the eigenbasis of Pz, where Pz is diagonal with eigenvalues ħ, 0, and -ħ corresponding to the first, second, and third basis vectors respectively. First, we verify normalization of the state vector: (-1/2)^2 + (1/√2)^2 + (-1/2)^2 = 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = 1, confirming the state is normalized. Next, we calculate the expectation value ⟨Pz⟩ by summing the products of the squared magnitudes of the state components and their corresponding eigenvalues: ⟨Pz⟩ = (1/4)ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)(-ħ) = 0. Then, we calculate ⟨Pz^2⟩ similarly but with eigenvalues squared: ⟨Pz^2⟩ = (1/4)ħ^2 + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)ħ^2 = (1/2)ħ^2. Substituting these into the variance formula gives (ΔPz)^2 = (1/2)ħ^2 - 0^2 = (1/2)ħ^2. Taking the square root yields ΔPz = ħ/√2. This result matches exactly choice 3 (ħ/√2). The calculations are consistent with the physical interpretation that the state is an eigenstate of Px (not Pz), so the uncertainty in Pz is nonzero. All assumptions, including normalization and hermiticity of the operators, hold. Multiple independent analyses confirm this result, and no contradictions or alternative simplifications arise. Therefore, the best matching candidate for ΔPz is ħ/√2, corresponding to choice C.
