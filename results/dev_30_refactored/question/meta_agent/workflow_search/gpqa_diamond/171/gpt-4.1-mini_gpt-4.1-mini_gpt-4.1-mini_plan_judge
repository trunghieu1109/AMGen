Question: Example(question='Two stars are being studied. It has been observed that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2. In fact, the energy difference between the considered energy levels was determined to be approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J. Assuming that the stellar photospheres are in LTE, which of these equations for the effective temperatures of the stars (T_1 and T_2) is correct?', choice1='ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]\n', choice2='ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]\n', choice3='ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n', choice4='ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: The problem states that the excitation of iron atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2 for a specific energy level difference ΔE. Under LTE, the population ratio of excited states follows the Boltzmann distribution: n_i/n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp(-ΔE/(kT)). Given the ratio of populations in the excited state between star_1 and star_2 is 2, we have 2 = exp[(ΔE/k)(1/T_2 - 1/T_1)]. Taking the natural logarithm yields ln(2) = (ΔE/k)(1/T_2 - 1/T_1). Rearranging gives ln(2) = (ΔE/k)(T_1 - T_2)/(T_1 * T_2). The candidate equations omit the factor ΔE/k, likely assuming it is normalized or factored out. Among the given choices, only choice 4, ln(2) = (T_1 - T_2)/(T_1 * T_2), matches the derived form. This equation is dimensionally consistent and physically meaningful, as it relates the difference and product of temperatures to the logarithm of the excitation ratio. The other choices either have incorrect algebraic forms or dimensional inconsistencies. The equation implies T_1 > T_2 for ln(2) > 0, consistent with star_1 having a higher excitation and thus a higher temperature. This relationship can be rearranged to express one temperature in terms of the other, providing a useful formula for astrophysical analysis. Therefore, choice 4 is the correct candidate equation for the effective temperatures T_1 and T_2.
