proposed answer: To validate the selected candidate formula for the maximum speed v_max of a 1D relativistic harmonic oscillator, we start from fundamental relativistic energy principles. The oscillator has potential energy at maximum displacement A given by U = (1/2)kA^2. The total energy at maximum displacement is the sum of rest energy and potential energy: E_total = mc^2 + (1/2)kA^2. At maximum speed, the potential energy is zero, and kinetic energy is maximal. The relativistic kinetic energy is K = (gamma - 1)mc^2, where gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2). Equating kinetic and potential energies: (1/2)kA^2 = (gamma - 1)mc^2, which gives gamma = 1 + (kA^2)/(2mc^2). Using gamma, we solve for v_max: v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2) = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA^2)/(2mc^2))^2). This formula respects the relativistic speed limit (v_max < c) for all amplitudes A, as gamma > 1 always. It reduces to the classical maximum speed v_max = A sqrt(k/m) in the non-relativistic limit where (kA^2)/(2mc^2) << 1, since then gamma â‰ˆ 1 and the formula approximates the classical result. The formula is dimensionally consistent and physically plausible. Among the candidate formulas, only choice 2 matches this derived expression exactly. Choice 1 has incorrect signs and structure leading to possible speeds exceeding c, violating relativity. Choice 3 lacks the speed of light c and has incorrect dimensionality, ignoring relativistic effects. Choice 4 is purely classical and can exceed c for large amplitudes, violating relativistic constraints. Therefore, choice 2 is the correct and physically consistent formula for the maximum speed of the relativistic harmonic oscillator.
