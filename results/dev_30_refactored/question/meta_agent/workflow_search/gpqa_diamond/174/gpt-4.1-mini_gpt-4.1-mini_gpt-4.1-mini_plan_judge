proposed answer: The problem involves an oscillating spheroidal charge distribution with symmetry along the z-axis, radiating electromagnetic waves at wavelength λ. The angular distribution of radiated power per unit solid angle for such a system is typically proportional to sin²θ, characteristic of dipole radiation. The maximum power A occurs at θ = 90°, where sin²90° = 1. At θ = 30°, sin30° = 1/2, so sin²30° = (1/2)² = 1/4, meaning the fraction of A radiated at 30° is 1/4. Regarding wavelength dependence, dipole radiation power scales as ω⁴, and since ω = 2πc/λ, the power scales as λ^{-4}. This matches the choice C, which states the fraction is 1/4 and the wavelength dependence is λ^{-4}. Other choices either have incorrect angular fractions or incorrect wavelength scaling. Higher multipole contributions would have different angular and wavelength dependencies, but the problem context and simplest physical assumption favor dipole radiation. Therefore, choice C is the correct and consistent answer.

proposed answer: The problem involves an oscillating spheroidal charge distribution symmetric about the z-axis, which suppresses dipole radiation and makes quadrupole radiation dominant. Quadrupole radiation intensity has an angular dependence proportional to sin^2(2θ), which peaks at θ=45° with a maximum value normalized to A. Evaluating at θ=30°, sin^2(60°) = (√3/2)^2 = 3/4, so the fraction of maximum power A radiated at 30° is 3/4. The wavelength dependence for quadrupole radiation scales as λ^{-6}, consistent with the physical scenario. Other choices either have incorrect angular fractions or inconsistent wavelength scaling. The normalization is consistent with the maximum power defined at θ=45°, and the fraction at θ=30° matches the quadrupole pattern. Therefore, the correct choice is the one with fraction 3/4 and wavelength dependence λ^{-6}, which corresponds to Choice 2 (B).
