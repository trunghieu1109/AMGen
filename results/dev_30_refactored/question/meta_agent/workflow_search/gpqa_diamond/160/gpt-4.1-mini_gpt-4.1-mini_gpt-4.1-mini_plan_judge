Question: Example(question='While designing a high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating at an accelerating voltage of 1000 kV, Mike connected vacuum pumps to create an ultra-high vacuum state (< 10^-9 Torr) in the sample compartment, aiming to minimize the presence of gas molecules for improved electron microscopy. However, as expected, some gas particles remained inside the compartment, as detected by the mass spectrometer. Mike accurately determined the mean free path of these gas molecules in the vacuum state (< 10^-9 Torr) to be λ1, based on factors such as sample compartment volume, pressure, and temperature. However, upon initiating the electron beam, he made an intriguing observation concerning the mean free path based on electron scattering with the gas molecules. He found that the mean free path was no longer equal to λ1; rather, it was λ2, even though the sample compartment temperature remained the same.\n\nWhat can we conclude about λ2 based on the aforementioned scenario?', choice1="λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation", choice2='λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1', choice3='λ2 < λ1', choice4='λ2 >= 1.22*λ1', correct_index=3)

proposed answer: The initial mean free path λ1 is defined for gas molecule collisions in an ultra-high vacuum environment, based on pressure, temperature, and volume. When the electron beam is initiated, electron-gas molecule scattering becomes the dominant interaction affecting the effective mean free path λ2 from the perspective of electron transport. Electrons are much lighter and faster than gas molecules and have smaller scattering cross sections with gas molecules compared to gas molecule-gas molecule collisions. This physical fact implies that electrons will, on average, travel longer distances before scattering, so λ2 should be greater than λ1. Since the temperature remains constant, thermal effects do not influence the mean free path change, so the difference arises solely from the scattering cross sections and collision dynamics. Considering the options: (A) λ2 = λ1 would mean no change in mean free path upon electron beam activation, which contradicts known physical principles. (C) λ2 < λ1 would imply electrons scatter more frequently than gas molecules, which is unlikely given the smaller electron scattering cross sections. (D) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 suggests a very large increase in mean free path, which is less supported by typical scattering data and may overestimate the effect. (B) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1 indicates a moderate increase in mean free path due to electron scattering, aligning well with physical reasoning and empirical evidence. Therefore, the best supported and physically consistent conclusion is that λ2 lies between λ1 and 1.22 times λ1, i.e., λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1.
