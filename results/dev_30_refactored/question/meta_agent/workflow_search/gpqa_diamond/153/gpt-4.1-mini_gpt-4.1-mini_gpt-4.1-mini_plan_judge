proposed answer: The molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 with a secondary peak at m/z = 158 (32% intensity) clearly indicates the presence of one chlorine atom due to the characteristic isotopic pattern of chlorine (35Cl and 37Cl in approximately a 3:1 ratio). This isotopic pattern is a definitive clue for chlorine substitution in the molecule. The IR spectrum shows a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1, characteristic of the O-H stretch in carboxylic acids, and a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1, indicative of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch consistent with a carboxylic acid functional group. The 1H NMR spectrum shows a singlet at 11.0 ppm integrating to 1H, which corresponds to the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid. Additionally, the two doublets at 8.02 ppm (2H) and 7.72 ppm (2H) suggest a para-substituted benzene ring, as this splitting pattern is typical for symmetrical substitution on the aromatic ring, resulting in two sets of equivalent protons each integrating to 2H. Ortho- or meta-substituted chlorobenzoic acids would show more complex splitting patterns due to less symmetry. Other options such as 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde would show aldehyde proton signals around 9-10 ppm and different IR features, and phenyl chloroformate would lack the broad O-H stretch and have different NMR signals. The discrepancy in the physical state (white solid vs. liquid) is likely a minor error or misstatement and does not affect the spectral interpretation. Although the absence of 13C NMR and fragmentation data limits absolute certainty, the combined spectral data strongly support the identification of the compound as 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Therefore, considering all spectral evidence, isotopic pattern, functional groups, and substitution pattern, the most reasonable structural suggestion is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.
