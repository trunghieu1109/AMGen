proposed answer: The selected statement is Statement 1: 'Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.' To assess this, we consider the chemical feasibility, industrial implementation, and economic viability of dual catalyst systems for ethylene polymerization to produce branched polymers. Chemically, dual catalyst systems combining a catalyst that produces high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and another catalyst that introduces regular branches (such as those producing linear low-density polyethylene, LLDPE) are well-established. Industrially, such systems are indeed implemented on a large scale, especially in the US, where polymer manufacturers use dual catalyst systems to tailor polymer properties by controlling branching and density. This approach allows the production of polymers with desired mechanical and physical properties using only ethylene as the monomer. Economically, the use of dual catalyst systems is justified by the ability to meet market demands for different polymer grades, making the process viable and widely adopted. The other statements, while containing some truth, are either too specific, less universally applicable, or less relevant to the question. For example, aluminum-based activators are widely used in many polymerization systems, so the claim that they do not work for the additional reaction step is not universally correct. Group VIa transition metal catalysts can be used but are not the standard industrial choice for this purpose. Noble metal catalysts are indeed expensive and not commonly used industrially for ethylene polymerization to branched polymers. Therefore, Statement 1 is the most accurate and comprehensive answer, reflecting current industrial practice and polymer chemistry principles. It correctly states that such combined dual catalyst systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.

proposed answer: The selected statement is choice 2: 'Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.' This statement is correct and aligns well with the known chemistry of dual catalyst systems for ethylene polymerization to produce branched polymers using only ethylene. The essential additional reaction step refers to the introduction of regular branches in the polymer backbone, which is typically achieved via chain-walking or similar mechanisms catalyzed by group VIa transition metal catalysts (e.g., chromium, molybdenum). Aluminum-based activators, commonly used in traditional Ziegler-Natta catalysis, are ineffective or incompatible with activating these group VIa catalysts for the branching step. This incompatibility is well-documented and critical for the success of the dual catalyst system. Other statements, while partially true, either refer to economic considerations (statement 4), industrial implementation scale which is not fully established for homogeneous dual catalyst systems (statement 1), or are more general without addressing the key mechanistic limitation (statement 3). Therefore, statement 2 is the most precise, chemically accurate, and relevant to the question. No ambiguities or previous reasoning errors are present in this conclusion, and it is consistent with polymer chemistry principles and industrial practices.
