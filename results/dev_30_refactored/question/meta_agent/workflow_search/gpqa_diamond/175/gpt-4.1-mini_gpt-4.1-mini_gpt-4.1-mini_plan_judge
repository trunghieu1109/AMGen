proposed answer: We start with the initial state vector |ψ> = (-1, 2, 1)^T. First, normalize it: norm = sqrt((-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(1 + 4 + 1) = sqrt(6). So, |ψ_norm> = (-1/√6, 2/√6, 1/√6)^T. 

Next, consider the operator P with matrix:
P = [[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]].
We want the eigenspace corresponding to eigenvalue 0. Solve P|v> = 0|v>.

Let |v> = (x, y, z)^T. Then:
0 = P|v> = ( (1/√2)y, (1/√2)x + (1/√2)z, (1/√2)y )^T.
From first and third components: (1/√2)y = 0 => y = 0.
From second component: (1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0 => x + z = 0 => z = -x.

So eigenvector for eigenvalue 0 is |v_P0> = (x, 0, -x)^T = x(1, 0, -1)^T.
Normalize: norm = sqrt(1^2 + 0 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2), so normalized eigenvector is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2)^T.

Calculate the probability amplitude for measuring P=0:
c_P = <v_P0|ψ_norm> = (1/√2, 0, -1/√2) · (-1/√6, 2/√6, 1/√6) = (1/√2)(-1/√6) + 0 + (-1/√2)(1/√6) = (-1/√12) - (1/√12) = -2/√12 = -2/(2√3) = -1/√3.

Probability of measuring P=0 is |c_P|^2 = (1/√3)^2 = 1/3.

After measurement, the state collapses to |v_P0>.

Now measure Q with matrix:
Q = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -1]].
Eigenvalue -1 corresponds to eigenvector |v_Q> = (0, 0, 1)^T.

Calculate the probability amplitude for measuring Q=-1 after P=0:
c_Q = <v_Q|v_P0> = (0, 0, 1) · (1/√2, 0, -1/√2) = -1/√2.

Probability of measuring Q=-1 given P=0 is |c_Q|^2 = (1/√2)^2 = 1/2.

Total probability of sequential measurements P=0 then Q=-1 is product: (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.

This matches the quantum mechanical postulates: normalize initial state, project onto eigenspace of first measurement, normalize post-measurement state, then project onto eigenspace of second measurement, multiply probabilities.

Therefore, the correct probability is 1/6, which corresponds to choice 2.

proposed answer: First, we normalize the initial state vector |ψ⟩ = (-1, 2, 1)^T. The norm is √((-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2) = √(1 + 4 + 1) = √6. So the normalized state is |ψ⟩ = (-1/√6, 2/√6, 1/√6)^T.

Next, we find the eigenspace of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0. The matrix P is:
P = [[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]].

To find eigenvectors for eigenvalue 0, solve P|v⟩ = 0.

From the system, the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0 is |v⟩ = (1, 0, -1)^T (up to normalization).

Normalize |v⟩: norm = √(1^2 + 0 + (-1)^2) = √2, so normalized |v⟩ = (1/√2, 0, -1/√2)^T.

Probability of measuring P=0 is |⟨v|ψ⟩|^2 = |(1/√2)(-1/√6) + 0 + (-1/√2)(1/√6)|^2 = |(-1/√12) - (1/√12)|^2 = |-2/√12|^2 = (2/√12)^2 = 4/12 = 1/3.

After measuring P=0, the state collapses to |ψ_post⟩ = projection of |ψ⟩ onto |v⟩, normalized:
|ψ_post⟩ = |v⟩ * ⟨v|ψ⟩ / |⟨v|ψ⟩| = |v⟩ * (-2/√12) / (2/√12) = -|v⟩ (global phase irrelevant), so normalized |ψ_post⟩ = (1/√2, 0, -1/√2)^T.

Now, consider measurement of Q with eigenvalue -1. The matrix Q is diagonal with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1 corresponding to basis vectors e1, e2, e3 respectively.

Eigenvector for Q=-1 is |v_Q⟩ = (0, 0, 1)^T.

Probability of measuring Q=-1 given |ψ_post⟩ is |⟨v_Q|ψ_post⟩|^2 = |(0, 0, 1) · (1/√2, 0, -1/√2)|^2 = |-1/√2|^2 = 1/2.

Therefore, total probability = P(P=0) * P(Q=-1|P=0) = (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.

This matches the previous calculation and is consistent with quantum measurement postulates: normalization of states, projection onto eigenspaces, and sequential measurement probabilities.

Hence, the answer 1/6 is correct and consistent with the given choices.
