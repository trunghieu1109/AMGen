proposed answer: In four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime, the mass dimension of the Lagrangian density is 4. The fermion field \( \psi \) has mass dimension 3/2, so the bilinear \( \bar{\psi} \psi \) has mass dimension 3. The tensor \( \sigma_{\mu\nu} \) is dimensionless. The field strength tensor \( F^{\mu\nu} \) has mass dimension 2. Therefore, the operator \( \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu} \) has mass dimension 5. To keep the interaction Lagrangian dimension 4, the coupling constant \( \kappa \) must have mass dimension \( 4 - 5 = -1 \). A coupling constant with negative mass dimension indicates a nonrenormalizable interaction in four-dimensional QFT. Hence, the mass dimension of \( \kappa \) is -1 and the theory is not renormalizable. This matches option C.
