Question: Example(question='Astronomers are studying two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2. Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.', choice1='~ 0.4', choice2='~ 0.7', choice3='~ 0.6\n', choice4='~ 1.2', correct_index=1)

proposed answer: To confirm the validity of the selected answer (~0.4), we carefully re-examine the problem and the solution steps. The problem involves two eclipsing binary star systems with given orbital periods and radial velocity (RV) amplitudes for each star. The goal is to find the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, where the total mass is the sum of the two stars' masses in each system. 

Step 1: Understanding the relationship between orbital period, semi-major axis, and total mass. Kepler's third law states that M ∝ a^3 / P^2, where M is the total mass, a is the semi-major axis of the relative orbit, and P is the orbital period. 

Step 2: Using RV amplitudes to find the semi-major axes of individual stars. The RV amplitude corresponds to the orbital velocity projected along the line of sight. Assuming circular orbits and similar inclination angles for both systems (since both are eclipsing binaries), the ratio of RV amplitudes inversely relates to the mass ratio of the stars. The semi-major axis of each star's orbit around the center of mass is given by a_i = V_i * P / (2π), where V_i is the orbital velocity (RV amplitude converted to AU/year), and P is the orbital period.

Step 3: Convert RV amplitudes from km/s to AU/year using the conversion factor 1 km/s ≈ 0.2108 AU/year.

Step 4: Calculate the total semi-major axis for each system by summing the semi-major axes of the two stars.

Step 5: Apply Kepler's third law to find the mass ratio M1/M2 = (a1/a2)^3 * (P2/P1)^2.

Step 6: Perform the calculations:
- For system_1: a1 ≈ 1.006 AU, P1 = 2 years
- For system_2: a2 ≈ 0.838 AU, P2 = 1 year
- (a1/a2)^3 ≈ (1.006/0.838)^3 ≈ 1.728
- (P2/P1)^2 = (1/2)^2 = 0.25
- M1/M2 = 1.728 * 0.25 = 0.432

This result means system_1 is about 0.43 times as massive as system_2, which corresponds to choice A (~0.4).

Step 7: Consider possible uncertainties and assumptions:
- Inclination angles are assumed similar; if they differ significantly, the RV amplitudes would be affected, but since both systems are eclipsing, inclinations are likely close to 90 degrees.
- Orbits are assumed circular, consistent with sinusoidal RV curves.
- The conversion factor and units are correctly applied.

Given these considerations, the reasoning and calculations are consistent with physical laws and the problem statement. Therefore, the selected answer (~0.4) is valid and correct.
