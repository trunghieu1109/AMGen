Iteration: Test New Architecture_162
proposed answer: The problem involves dissolving 0.1 g of Fe(OH)3 in a total volume of 100 cm3 using a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid. The dissolution reaction requires 3 moles of H+ per mole of Fe(OH)3. Calculating the moles of Fe(OH)3: 0.1 g / 106.87 g/mol ≈ 9.36 × 10^-4 mol. The moles of H+ needed = 3 × 9.36 × 10^-4 = 2.81 × 10^-3 mol. The volume of acid needed = moles / concentration = 2.81 × 10^-3 / 0.1 = 0.0281 L = 28.1 cm3, which matches closely with choice 1 (28.05 cm3). The pH after dissolution and hydrolysis of Fe3+ ions is about 2.04, consistent with choice 1. Other choices have higher acid volumes and pH values inconsistent with the minimum acid volume and expected acidic pH due to Fe3+ hydrolysis. Therefore, choice 1 is the correct and valid answer.

proposed answer: To determine the minimum volume of 0.1 M monobasic strong acid needed to dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm3 total volume and the pH of the resulting solution, we first calculate the moles of Fe(OH)3. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is approximately 106.85 g/mol, so moles of Fe(OH)3 = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 9.36 × 10^-4 mol. The dissolution reaction is Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe3+ + 3H2O, requiring 3 moles of H+ per mole of Fe(OH)3. Therefore, moles of H+ needed = 3 × 9.36 × 10^-4 = 2.81 × 10^-3 mol. The volume of 0.1 M acid needed = moles / concentration = 2.81 × 10^-3 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.0281 L = 28.1 cm3. Among the options, 28.05 cm3 (choice A) closely matches this calculated volume. The pH is determined by the slight excess of acid after neutralization, resulting in a pH of about 2.04, consistent with choice A. Other options either have acid volumes too high or too low, leading to incomplete dissolution or incorrect pH values. Hence, choice A is the best fit considering stoichiometry, acid concentration, volume constraints, and pH calculation.
