Iteration: Test New Architecture_190
proposed answer: The sequence of reactions starts with 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. The first step with sodium hydride and benzyl bromide converts the hydroxymethyl group into a benzyl ether, protecting the hydroxyl group. The ketone remains unchanged. Next, treatment with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide and catalytic HCl converts the ketone into a tosylhydrazone. Then, the Shapiro reaction with n-butyllithium at low temperature followed by aqueous ammonium chloride converts the tosylhydrazone into an alkene at position 1. The benzyl ether and isopropenyl group remain intact. Finally, catalytic hydrogenation with Pd/C under hydrogen atmosphere reduces the alkene to an alkane, saturates the isopropenyl group to isopropyl, and cleaves the benzyl ether protecting group to regenerate the free hydroxyl group. The final product is a cyclohexane ring with a hydroxymethyl group at position 3, an isopropyl group at position 5, and a saturated carbon at position 1. Among the given choices, only choice A, (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol, matches this structure. The other choices either retain protecting groups or substituents inconsistent with the hydrogenation step. This conclusion is consistent with the known chemistry of the reagents and transformations involved, and the answer A appears most frequently and logically across analyses.
