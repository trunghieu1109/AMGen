Question: Example(question='Imagine an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ having a small spherical cavity inside. The centre of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the centre of the spherical conductor. The radius of the cavity is $r$, and $r<R$. Now consider a small amount of positive charge $+q$ is somehow placed somewhere inside the cavity. What is the magnitude of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at a point P (outside the spherical conductor) of distance $L$ from the centre of the spherical conductor? Note, the distance of the point P from the centre of the cavity is $l$. Here, l, L > R. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\\theta$\n', choice1='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n', choice2='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n', choice3='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\n', choice4='$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n', correct_index=4)

proposed answer: When a positive charge +q is placed inside a cavity within an uncharged spherical conductor, the conductor rearranges its free charges to ensure the electric field inside the conductor's material is zero. This rearrangement induces charges on the cavity surface and the outer surface of the conductor such that the net external effect is that of a point charge +q located at the center of the conductor. The displacement s of the cavity and the position of the charge inside the cavity do not affect the external field because the conductor cancels out any multipole moments caused by the off-center charge through induced charges. By the uniqueness theorem and electrostatic shielding, the external field outside the spherical conductor depends only on the total enclosed charge and behaves as if the charge were concentrated at the conductor's center. Therefore, at point P outside the conductor (distance L > R), the electric field magnitude is given by Coulomb's law for a point charge +q located at the conductor's center: E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q / L²). The given options that depend on l, s, or θ are incorrect because the external field does not depend on the cavity position or the angle. Hence, the correct answer is choice D.
