proposed answer: The problem involves calculating the partition function Z for a system of three spins S1, S2, and S3, each taking values ±1, with energy E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). There are 2^3 = 8 possible spin configurations. We analyze the energy for each configuration by evaluating the sum of pairwise products S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. When all spins are aligned (all +1 or all -1), each pair product is +1, so the sum is 3, and energy E = -3J. There are 2 such configurations. For configurations where exactly one spin differs, the sum of pairwise products is -1, so E = +J. There are 6 such configurations. The partition function is the sum over all configurations of e^{-βE}, which is Z = 2 * e^{3Jβ} + 6 * e^{-Jβ}. Comparing this with the given choices, only choice 1 matches exactly. The other choices have incorrect exponents or coefficients. This conclusion is consistent with the explicit enumeration of configurations, correct energy calculations, and proper counting of degeneracies. Therefore, the best candidate expression for Z is choice 1.
