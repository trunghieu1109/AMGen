proposed answer: The ratio Flux(band 1)/Flux(band 2) corresponds to Flux(700-800 keV)/Flux(800-900 keV). The 800-900 keV band is dominated by the strong 0.86 MeV neutrino line from the pp-II branch, which is a sharp and intense feature, resulting in a relatively high flux in this band. The 700-800 keV band lies just below this peak and mainly receives contributions from the pp-II continuum and minor pp-I neutrinos, leading to a significantly lower flux. Since the pp-III branch neutrinos mostly have energies above 1 MeV, stopping this branch does not significantly affect the fluxes in these two bands, so the ratio remains approximately the same after stopping pp-III. Among the given numerical options (0.1, 10, 1, 0.01), the ratio must be less than 1 because the 800-900 keV band flux is higher. The value 0.1 best represents a ratio less than 1 but not extremely small, consistent with the relative intensities of the bands and the spectral data. The value 0.01 would be too low, 1 would imply equal fluxes, and 10 would imply the lower energy band has higher flux, which contradicts the spectral data. Although one agent suggested 0.01, the majority and the detailed spectral analysis support 0.1 as the most reasonable and consistent choice. Therefore, the final answer is B).

proposed answer: From the detailed quantitative analysis in Subtask 4, stopping the pp-III branch removes the 8B neutrino flux, which is the primary contributor to the 700-800 keV band. Before stopping pp-III, the 700-800 keV flux was approximately 5 x 10^3 cm^-2 s^-1 due to the 8B neutrinos. After stopping pp-III, this flux effectively drops to zero because no other neutrino sources contribute significantly in this energy range. Meanwhile, the 800-900 keV band remains dominated by the 7Be 0.862 MeV neutrino line with a flux of about 4.5 x 10^9 cm^-2 s^-1, which is unaffected by the cessation of the pp-III branch. Therefore, the ratio Flux(700-800 keV) / Flux(800-900 keV) after stopping pp-III is approximately 0 / (4.5 x 10^9) = 0. Since the exact zero ratio is not among the given options (0.1, 10, 1, 0.01), the closest and most reasonable choice is 0.01, representing a very small ratio consistent with near-zero numerator. Other options (0.1, 1, 10) are orders of magnitude too large and inconsistent with the quantitative flux analysis. This conclusion is robust, quantitatively justified, and consistent with all previous subtasks and corrections. It explicitly accounts for the complete removal of the pp-III branch and its impact on the 8B neutrino flux in the 700-800 keV band, while the 7Be line flux in the 800-900 keV band remains unchanged. Hence, the best approximate ratio from the given choices is 0.01.
