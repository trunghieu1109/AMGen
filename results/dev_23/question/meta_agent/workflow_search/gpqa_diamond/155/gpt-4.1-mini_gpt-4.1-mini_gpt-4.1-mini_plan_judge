proposed answer: The mixture contains four stereoisomeric epoxides: two enantiomeric pairs, one pair from the trans-epoxide (derived from the (E)-alkene) and one pair from the cis-epoxide (derived from the (Z)-alkene). Each pair consists of two enantiomers, which are mirror images and have identical physical properties in an achiral environment but differ in a chiral environment. On a standard achiral reverse-phase HPLC column, enantiomers co-elute because the stationary phase is achiral and cannot differentiate between them. Therefore, each enantiomeric pair appears as a single peak. However, the trans and cis epoxides are diastereomers, which have different physical and chemical properties and thus different retention times. This leads to two resolved peaks on the achiral column, each representing one diastereomeric pair of enantiomers. On a chiral HPLC column, the chiral stationary phase interacts differently with each enantiomer, allowing their separation. Since there are two diastereomeric pairs, each consisting of two enantiomers, the chiral column will resolve all four stereoisomers individually, resulting in four distinct peaks. This reasoning assumes ideal chromatographic resolution with no peak overlap or co-elution. Alternative scenarios such as partial resolution or co-elution are less likely under ideal conditions. This conclusion is consistent with the stereochemical relationships of the epoxides and standard chromatographic behavior of stereoisomers. Therefore, the final prediction is that the achiral reverse-phase HPLC chromatogram will show 2 resolved peaks (one for each diastereomeric pair), and the chiral HPLC chromatogram will show 4 resolved peaks (each stereoisomer separated).

proposed answer: From Sub-task 3, the combined reaction mixture contains four stereoisomeric diols: two pairs of enantiomers, specifically (4R,5S) & (4S,5R) (trans diols) and (4R,5R) & (4S,5S) (cis diols). Enantiomers have identical physical and chemical properties in achiral environments, so on a standard achiral reverse-phase HPLC column, each enantiomeric pair will co-elute as a single peak. However, diastereomers differ in their physical and chemical properties and thus can be separated on achiral columns. Since the two pairs of enantiomers are diastereomeric to each other (cis vs trans), they will elute as two distinct peaks on the achiral column. On a chiral HPLC column, the chiral stationary phase can differentiate between enantiomers due to their different interactions with the chiral environment. Therefore, each enantiomer will be resolved individually, resulting in four distinct peaks corresponding to the four stereoisomers. This reasoning aligns with well-established chromatographic principles: enantiomers co-elute on achiral columns but separate on chiral columns, while diastereomers separate on both. Hence, under ideal chromatographic resolution conditions, the combined diol mixture will show 2 resolved peaks on the achiral reverse-phase HPLC column and 4 resolved peaks on the chiral HPLC column.
