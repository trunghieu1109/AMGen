Iteration: Test New Architecture_174
proposed answer: The problem requires matching the computed angular fraction of maximum radiated power at theta=30 degrees and the wavelength dependence of the radiated power with the given choices. From Sub-task 3, the angular dependence follows a dipole radiation pattern proportional to sin^2(theta). Evaluating at theta=30 degrees, sin(30°) = 0.5, so sin^2(30°) = 0.25, meaning the radiated power at 30 degrees is 25% of the maximum power at 90 degrees. This corresponds to option A) for the angular fraction. From Sub-task 4, the wavelength dependence of the radiated power for dipole radiation scales as the inverse fourth power of the wavelength, i.e., P ∝ 1/λ^4, a fundamental and well-established result in classical electrodynamics. This corresponds to option A) for the wavelength dependence. Multiple agents independently concluded option A) for both sub-tasks, reinforcing the consistency and correctness of this choice. Alternative options would contradict the classical dipole radiation model or the physical setup of an oscillating spheroidal charge distribution. Therefore, the correct matched pair is option A) for both the angular fraction and the wavelength dependence. This conclusion is supported by classical electrodynamics theory, the physical nature of the problem, and the consensus among multiple expert agents.

proposed answer: The problem involves synthesizing the results from Sub-tasks 4 and 5 to select the correct choice that matches both the angular fraction of radiated power at θ=30° and the wavelength dependence of the radiated power. From Sub-task 4, the leading multipole moment is the quadrupole moment (l=2), which dictates that the radiated power scales with wavelength as P ~ λ^-6. This is a well-established result from classical multipole radiation theory, where the power radiated by a multipole of order l scales as ω^(2l+2), and since ω = 2πc/λ, this translates to P ~ λ^-(2l+2). For l=2, this is λ^-6. The dipole moment (l=1) is zero due to the symmetry of the charge distribution, so dipole scaling λ^-4 does not apply. From Sub-task 5, the angular radiation intensity pattern is proportional to sin²(θ)cos²(θ), with maximum intensity at θ=45°. At θ=30°, the intensity is 0.75 times the maximum intensity. However, intensity at a single angle is not the fraction of total power radiated in that direction; the fraction of total power requires integration over a finite solid angle element around θ=30°, which yields a smaller fraction. This distinction is crucial and must be respected. Combining these results, the correct choice must reflect both the quadrupole wavelength dependence (λ^-6) and the angular distribution with the noted intensity ratio at θ=30°, while acknowledging that the fraction of total power radiated near θ=30° is smaller than the intensity ratio. Choices assuming dipole scaling or misinterpreting intensity as power fraction are inconsistent with the physical and mathematical analysis. The consensus from multiple agents, each providing detailed reasoning consistent with classical electrodynamics and multipole radiation theory, is that option D) is the only choice that correctly and consistently matches the computed angular fraction and wavelength dependence. This conclusion is robust under all physically plausible assumptions given the problem's symmetry and radiation theory. Therefore, the final answer for Sub-task 6 is D).
