proposed answer: To calculate the pH of the resulting solution after dissolution of Fe(OH)3 by H+ from a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid, we must consider the stoichiometry, acid volume added, total solution volume, and the chemical equilibria involved. From Sub-task 1, the moles of Fe(OH)3 are m / 106.88, and the moles of H+ required to dissolve it completely are 3 * (m / 106.88). From Sub-task 2, the minimum volume of 0.1 M acid needed is V = (3 * m) / 10.688 liters. We consider three cases: 1) Acid volume added equals V: All Fe(OH)3 dissolves, and no excess H+ remains. However, Fe3+ ions formed hydrolyze in water, producing H+ ions and lowering the pH below 7. The hydrolysis equilibrium must be considered to estimate pH accurately. 2) Acid volume added less than V: Not all Fe(OH)3 dissolves, so some Fe(OH)3 remains, and the solution is basic due to undissolved hydroxide ions, resulting in pH > 7. 3) Acid volume added greater than V: Excess H+ ions remain, and pH is acidic, calculated by pH = -log([H+]), where [H+] = (excess moles of H+) / total solution volume. The total solution volume is initial volume plus acid volume added. Since initial volume is not given, it must be known or assumed to calculate exact pH. For case 1, to estimate pH, we consider Fe3+ hydrolysis: Fe3+ + H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)2+ + H+, with a known hydrolysis constant (Ka). This equilibrium releases H+ ions, making the solution acidic. The pH can be estimated by solving the hydrolysis equilibrium equations, which requires the hydrolysis constant and total Fe3+ concentration (equal to moles of Fe(OH)3 dissolved divided by total volume). Without these constants and volumes, exact pH cannot be calculated but is expected to be acidic (pH < 7). Therefore, the previous assumption of neutral pH is incorrect. In summary, the pH depends on acid volume added relative to stoichiometric volume and hydrolysis of Fe3+. The best answer choice is C), which acknowledges these considerations and is consistent with stoichiometric and volumetric principles.

proposed answer: From Subtask 3, the volume of acid added to dissolve all Fe(OH)3 is 28.1 cm3, which corresponds to option C). This volume exactly neutralizes the Fe(OH)3, meaning no excess acid remains. Subtask 4 calculates the pH after dissolution and hydrolysis assuming no excess acid, resulting in a pH of approximately 2.6 (option B)). Subtask 5 considers the scenario where excess acid is present, leading to a more acidic pH (option C)), but this scenario contradicts the acid volume chosen in Subtask 3, which is the exact neutralization volume. Therefore, the scenario of excess acid does not apply here. Integrating these results, the final pH must correspond to the exact neutralization case with no excess acid, which is the pH from Subtask 4, about 2.6. This pH logically follows from the stoichiometry and hydrolysis equilibria, and is consistent with the acid volume chosen. Hence, the final pH is best represented by option B). This conclusion is robust because it aligns the acid volume, stoichiometry, and hydrolysis chemistry consistently, avoiding contradictions from assuming excess acid when none is added.
