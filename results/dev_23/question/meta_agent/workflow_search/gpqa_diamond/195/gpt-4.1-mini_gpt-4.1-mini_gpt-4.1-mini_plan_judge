proposed answer: The evaluation of the four candidate formulas for the relativistic maximum speed v_max must be grounded in fundamental physical principles: relativistic energy conservation, Hooke's law, and the relativistic speed limit. The derived expression for v_max is v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1 / (1 + (k A^2) / (2 m c^2))^2). This formula is obtained by equating the total energy at maximum displacement (rest energy plus potential energy) and at equilibrium (rest energy plus relativistic kinetic energy), incorporating the Lorentz factor gamma. Step-by-step justification: 1. Physical consistency: The formula respects the universal speed limit v_max < c because the term inside the square root is always less than 1. 2. Classical limit: When the potential energy (1/2 k A^2) is much smaller than the rest energy (m c^2), the formula reduces to the classical maximum velocity v_max_classical = A sqrt(k/m), ensuring consistency with non-relativistic mechanics. 3. Dimensional correctness: The formula involves the dimensionless ratio (k A^2) / (m c^2), which correctly characterizes the relative scale of potential energy to rest energy. 4. Energy conservation: The formula stems directly from the relativistic energy conservation equation, ensuring that all energy contributions (rest, potential, kinetic) are accounted for. 5. Behavior across regimes: For small amplitudes or weak springs, relativistic effects are negligible, and the formula matches classical results. For large amplitudes or stiff springs, relativistic effects dominate, and v_max approaches but never reaches c, as required. 6. Comparison with other candidate formulas: Other formulas either fail to reduce to the classical limit, violate the speed limit, or omit rest energy contributions, making them physically inconsistent. 7. Consensus among multiple independent analyses: All agents and sub-tasks consistently identify the same formula (option A) as the correct relativistic maximum speed expression. Considering all possible cases—non-relativistic, intermediate, and relativistic regimes—the derived formula is exact, consistent, and comprehensive. Therefore, the correct formula representing the relativistic maximum speed v_max of the oscillator is the one given by option A).

proposed answer: The derived expression for the maximum speed v_max from Subtask 3 is:

v_max = c * sqrt{1 - 1 / [1 + (k A^2) / (2 m c^2)]^2}

This expression was rigorously derived starting from the relativistic equation of motion dp/dt = F, with p = gamma m v and F = -kx, without relying on classical potential energy or naive energy conservation. The derivation involved expressing dp/dt as v dp/dx, using the relativistic momentum definition, and integrating the resulting differential equation. This led to the relation m c^2 (gamma - 1) = (k/2)(A^2 - x^2), and at x=0, v = v_max, giving gamma_max = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2). Solving for v_max yields the above formula.

Now, the four candidate formulas for v_max are:

choice1: v_max = c * sqrt{1 - (1 / (1 + (k A^2) / (m c^2)))^2}
choice2: v_max = c * sqrt{1 - (1 / (1 + (k A^2) / (4 m c^2)))^2}
choice3: v_max = c * sqrt{1 - (1 / (1 + (k A^2) / (m c^2)))^2}
choice4: v_max = c * sqrt{1 - (1 / (1 + (k A^2) / (2 m c^2)))^2}

Comparing the derived formula to each candidate:
- choice1 and choice3 have denominator (1 + (k A^2) / (m c^2)), which differs by a factor of 2 in the denominator from the derived formula.
- choice2 has denominator (1 + (k A^2) / (4 m c^2)), which differs by a factor of 4.
- choice4 has denominator (1 + (k A^2) / (2 m c^2)), which exactly matches the derived formula.

Additionally, the formula respects physical constraints: since gamma_max = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) > 1, the term inside the square root is positive and less than 1, ensuring v_max < c.

Therefore, the exact match to the derived relativistic maximum speed formula is choice4. This explicit matching avoids any mislabeling errors and confirms the correctness and physical validity of the formula.
