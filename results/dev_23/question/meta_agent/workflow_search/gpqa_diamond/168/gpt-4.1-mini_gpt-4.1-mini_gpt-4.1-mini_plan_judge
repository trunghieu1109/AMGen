proposed answer: The original decay 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V involves two neutrinos (2V) emitted alongside two electrons (2E) and two B particles. Each neutrino carries away a variable amount of energy and momentum, resulting in a continuous electron energy spectrum with an endpoint energy determined by the Q-value (mass difference between initial and final nuclei). This continuous spectrum is characteristic of standard two-neutrino double beta decay. When the two neutrinos are replaced by a single massless particle M in the variant decay 2A -> 2B + 2E + M, the number of final-state particles decreases, reducing the degrees of freedom for energy and momentum sharing among the decay products. This imposes stricter kinematic constraints, causing the electron energy spectrum to become discrete or sharply peaked rather than continuous. The endpoint energy remains approximately the same because it depends primarily on the nuclear mass difference, which is unchanged by substituting neutrinos with a massless boson. This reasoning is consistent with nuclear physics principles, conservation laws, and the outputs from Sub-tasks 1 and 2. All agents agree on this conclusion, and it aligns with known phenomena such as neutrinoless double beta decay plus Majoron emission. Considering all possible cases, including the masslessness of M and the absence of neutrinos, the spectrum changes from continuous to discrete/sharply peaked, with the endpoint energy remaining roughly constant. Therefore, the correct description of the energy spectrum characteristics comparing the original and variant decays is choice D).

proposed answer: The original decay 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V involves six final particles, including two massive V particles. The total available energy Q is shared among all these particles, resulting in a continuous energy spectrum for the E particles. The endpoint of this spectrum is limited by the total Q minus the rest masses of the final particles, including the two massive V particles. When replacing the two V particles with a single massless M particle in the variant decay 2A -> 2B + 2E + M, the final state now has five particles, and the total rest mass of the final state decreases because M is massless. Since the total Q-value is fixed by the initial and final nuclear masses, the kinetic energy available to the decay products increases. This leads to an increase in the maximum possible energy (endpoint) of the E particles. The shape of the energy spectrum changes due to the altered phase space distribution caused by fewer particles and the presence of a massless particle, which modifies how energy is partitioned among the decay products. However, the spectrum remains continuous because multiple particles still share the energy and momentum, allowing a continuous range of energy values for the E particles. All four debate agents independently conclude that the correct description is that the variant decay has a continuous energy spectrum with a higher endpoint and a modified shape compared to the original decay. No other options correctly account for the massless particle's impact on the endpoint energy or the continuous nature of the spectrum. Therefore, the final answer is choice A), which is consistent with nuclear decay kinematics and the detailed analyses provided.
