proposed answer: From Sub-task 4, we established that the quantum relative entropy difference \( \delta_b = \mathrm{Tr}(\rho \ln \rho) - \mathrm{Tr}(\tau \ln \tau) \) simplifies to \( -S(\tau) \) because \( \rho \) is pure and thus has zero entropy. The quantity \( \delta_b \) as defined is negative, but its magnitude \( |\delta_b| = S(\tau) \) quantifies the non-Gaussianity. The Gaussian reference state \( \tau \) is mixed and has positive entropy, so the non-Gaussianity measure is positive. When comparing numerical values, we should consider the positive entropy value of \( \tau \) as the non-Gaussianity measure. The closest numerical answer should correspond to the von Neumann entropy of \( \tau \), which is positive and nonzero. We must avoid confusion by not taking the literal sign of \( \delta_b \) but rather its magnitude as the meaningful measure. Considering all possible cases, the non-Gaussianity is zero only if \( \rho = \tau \), which is not the case for a Schrödinger cat state. Therefore, the numerical value should be positive and reflect the entropy of \( \tau \). The final choice should be the numerical option closest to this positive entropy value, consistent with the physical interpretation and previous reasoning. This approach avoids ambiguity and aligns with standard quantum information theory practices.

proposed answer: From Sub-task 5, we computed the von Neumann entropy S(τ) of the Gaussian reference state τ as approximately 0.27 (in natural units). The non-Gaussianity measure δ_B is defined as δ_B = Tr(ρ ln ρ) - Tr(τ ln τ). For a pure state ρ, Tr(ρ ln ρ) = 0, so δ_B = -Tr(τ ln τ) = S(τ). Therefore, the magnitude |δ_B| equals S(τ), which is approximately 0.27. Among the provided choices {2.48, 0, 1.38, 0.25}, the closest numerical value to 0.27 is 0.25. The other values are significantly larger or zero, which do not match the computed entropy. Hence, the correct choice is D) 0.25. This conclusion is based on explicit numerical calculation of the von Neumann entropy and the definition of δ_B, avoiding qualitative guessing and ensuring consistency with the previous sub-task results.
