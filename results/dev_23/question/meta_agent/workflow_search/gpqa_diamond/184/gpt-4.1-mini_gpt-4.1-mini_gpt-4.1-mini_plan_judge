proposed answer: The Hamiltonian is given by H = epsilon (sigma · n), where sigma · n is a Hermitian operator with eigenvalues ±1 due to the properties of the Pauli matrices and the fact that n is a unit vector. Multiplying by the scalar epsilon scales these eigenvalues to ±epsilon. Since epsilon has the dimension of energy, the eigenvalues ±epsilon represent the energy levels of the system. The reduced Planck constant ħ often appears explicitly in quantum mechanical operators to ensure correct physical dimensions, especially when operators represent angular momentum or magnetic moments. However, in this problem, epsilon is already defined as an energy scale, which may implicitly include ħ and other physical constants depending on the physical context. For example, in a spin system interacting with a magnetic field, epsilon could be (ħ/2)γB, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio and B is the magnetic field strength. Therefore, the eigenvalues of H are ±epsilon, consistent with the physical interpretation of a two-level spin-1/2 system energy splitting along the direction n. This conclusion holds for any real scalar epsilon and any unit vector n, covering all possible cases without contradictions. Other candidate eigenvalues that include explicit ħ factors or different scalings would need to be reconciled with the definition of epsilon. Since epsilon is given as the scaling factor, the simplest and physically consistent eigenvalues are ±epsilon. Hence, the correct eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are ±epsilon, corresponding to choice A).
