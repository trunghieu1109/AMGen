proposed answer: The target molecule 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene requires precise regioselectivity: an ethoxy group at position 1, a tert-butyl group ortho to it at position 2, and a nitro group meta to the ethoxy group at position 3. Starting from benzene, the sequence of reactions must consider the directing effects of substituents, ring activation/deactivation, steric hindrance, and potential side reactions to maximize yield and selectivity.

Option A proposes the sequence: (1) introduction of the ethoxy group, (2) Friedel-Crafts alkylation to add the tert-butyl group ortho to the ethoxy group, and (3) nitration to introduce the nitro group meta to the ethoxy group.

Step 1: Introducing the ethoxy group first is advantageous because the ethoxy substituent is strongly activating and ortho/para-directing. This activation facilitates subsequent electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) reactions, such as Friedel-Crafts alkylation and nitration, by increasing the electron density of the ring.

Step 2: Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride on ethoxybenzene proceeds efficiently. The ethoxy group directs substitution to ortho and para positions. The para position relative to ethoxy is occupied by the ethoxy group itself, so the bulky tert-butyl group preferentially substitutes at the ortho position. The tert-butyl carbocation is relatively stable, minimizing rearrangements. Controlling stoichiometry and reaction conditions reduces polyalkylation side reactions.

Step 3: Nitration is performed last. Both ethoxy and tert-butyl groups are activating and ortho/para-directing, but nitration tends to occur meta to the ethoxy group due to electronic and steric factors, placing the nitro group at position 3 as desired. Performing nitration last avoids deactivation of the ring that would occur if nitration were done first, which would hinder Friedel-Crafts alkylation.

Alternative sequences, such as nitration before alkylation or tert-butylation before ethoxylation, are less favorable. Nitration first deactivates the ring, reducing alkylation yield and regioselectivity. Tert-butylation first can cause steric hindrance, complicating subsequent ethoxy introduction and nitration.

Potential side reactions like polyalkylation and over-nitration can be minimized by careful control of reagent amounts, temperature, and reaction times.

All agents agree that option A is the optimal sequence based on chemical principles, directing effects, steric considerations, and practical synthetic strategies. This sequence maximizes yield, regioselectivity, and practicality for synthesizing the target molecule from benzene.

Therefore, the final answer is option A.

proposed answer: The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, which requires precise placement of three substituents on the benzene ring. The synthetic challenge lies in achieving high regioselectivity and yield while avoiding side reactions and isomer formation. Starting from benzene, the sequence must consider the directing effects of substituents and the stability of intermediates. Option A) is optimal because it begins with nitration, introducing a nitro group that is a strong meta-director and deactivator. This step ensures that subsequent substitutions occur at predictable positions. Next, the nitro group is reduced to an amino group, which is an activating ortho/para-director, facilitating further functionalization. The amino group is then converted to phenol via diazonium salt formation and hydrolysis, a well-established and high-yielding transformation that avoids direct and often problematic ether formation on benzene rings. The phenol intermediate undergoes Williamson ether synthesis to install the ethoxy group selectively and efficiently. Finally, Friedel-Crafts alkylation introduces the bulky tert-butyl group at the desired position. This order avoids catalyst poisoning and ring deactivation, which would reduce yields if alkylation were performed earlier. The sequence allows purification and characterization at each step, minimizing side reactions and isomer formation. Alternative sequences that attempt direct substitution of complex groups or combine steps often lead to poor regioselectivity, low yields, or unstable intermediates. Considering all these factors, option A) balances synthetic feasibility, regioselectivity, reagent compatibility, and overall yield, making it the superior choice for synthesizing 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.
