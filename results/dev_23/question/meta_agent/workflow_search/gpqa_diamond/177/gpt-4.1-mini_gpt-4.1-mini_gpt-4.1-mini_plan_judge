proposed answer: The interaction term is \( \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu \nu} \psi F^{\mu \nu} \). From standard quantum field theory, the fermionic field \( \psi \) has mass dimension 3/2, its conjugate \( \bar{\psi} \) also has dimension 3/2, the tensor \( \sigma_{\mu \nu} \) is dimensionless, and the gauge field strength tensor \( F^{\mu \nu} \) has dimension 2. Adding these, the operator has dimension 3/2 + 0 + 3/2 + 2 = 5. The Lagrangian density in four-dimensional spacetime must have mass dimension 4 for the action to be dimensionless. Therefore, the coupling constant \( \kappa \) must have mass dimension 4 - 5 = -1. This negative mass dimension indicates that \( \kappa \) corresponds to an inverse mass scale, typical of effective field theory operators suppressed by a high-energy scale. According to standard QFT criteria, operators with dimension greater than 4 are non-renormalizable because their coupling constants have negative mass dimension. This means the theory with this interaction term is non-renormalizable by power counting and requires an effective field theory description valid below some cutoff scale. All agents agree on these points, and no consistent alternative interpretation is presented. Hence, the combined and consistent conclusion is that the operator has dimension 5, the coupling constant \( \kappa \) has dimension -1, and the theory is non-renormalizable due to this interaction term. This corresponds to answer choice C).
