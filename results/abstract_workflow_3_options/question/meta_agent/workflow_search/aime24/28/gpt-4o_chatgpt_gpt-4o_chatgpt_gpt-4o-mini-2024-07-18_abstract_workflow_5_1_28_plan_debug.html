    <pre>Related original question:

Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$..

### Sub-task 6: Make final decision on the difference. 

 ### thinking by Final Decision Agent YY1D:
The task is to determine the difference between the radii of tangency circles when the torus is internally and externally tangent to the sphere. From the sub-tasks, we have that the radius of the circle of tangency when the torus is internally tangent to the sphere is r_i = 2, and when it is externally tangent, the radius is r_o = 6. Therefore, the difference is r_i - r_o = 2 - 6 = -4. The problem asks for this difference in the form m/n where m and n are relatively prime positive integers. Since -4 can be expressed as -4/1, and we need m and n to be positive, we take the absolute value to get 4/1. Thus, m = 4 and n = 1, which are relatively prime. Therefore, m + n = 4 + 1 = 5. Both agents agree on this conclusion, and the reasoning is consistent with the requirements of the problem.

### answer by Final Decision Agent YY1D:
5

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 7: Find the sum m + n, where m and n are relatively prime positive integers from the expression of r_i - r_o. 

 then justify completely and detailedly why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. Again, your task is only to answer the question Sub-task 7: Find the sum m + n, where m and n are relatively prime positive integers from the expression of r_i - r_o. and explaination.</pre>
