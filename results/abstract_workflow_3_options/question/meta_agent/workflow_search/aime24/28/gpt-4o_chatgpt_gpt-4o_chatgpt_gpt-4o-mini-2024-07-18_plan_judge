Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

proposed answer: The problem involves finding the difference between the radii of tangency circles when a torus is internally and externally tangent to a sphere. From the given information, when the torus is internally tangent to the sphere, the radius of the circle of tangency is r_i = 2, and when it is externally tangent, the radius is r_o = 6. The difference is r_i - r_o = 2 - 6 = -4. The problem asks for this difference in the form m/n where m and n are relatively prime positive integers. Since -4 can be expressed as -4/1, and we need m and n to be positive, we take the absolute value to get 4/1. Thus, m = 4 and n = 1, which are relatively prime. Therefore, m + n = 4 + 1 = 5. This reasoning is consistent with the requirements of the problem.

proposed answer: The difference r_i - r_o was calculated as 6 in the previous sub-tasks. This difference can be expressed as the fraction 6/1, where 6 and 1 are relatively prime positive integers because their greatest common divisor is 1. Therefore, m = 6 and n = 1. The problem asks for the sum of these integers, m + n, which is calculated as 6 + 1 = 7. This satisfies the requirement to express the difference as a fraction with relatively prime integers. Both agents agree on this conclusion, and the reasoning is consistent with the problem's requirements.
