Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

Full Response:[Info(name='thinking', author='Chain-of-Thought Agent JLll', content='The problem involves finding the difference between the radii of tangency circles when a torus is internally and externally tangent to a sphere. From the given information, when the torus is internally tangent to the sphere, the radius of the circle of tangency is r_i = 2, and when it is externally tangent, the radius is r_o = 6. The difference is r_i - r_o = 2 - 6 = -4. The problem asks for this difference in the form m/n where m and n are relatively prime positive integers. Since -4 can be expressed as -4/1, and we need m and n to be positive, we take the absolute value to get 4/1. Thus, m = 4 and n = 1, which are relatively prime. Therefore, m + n = 4 + 1 = 5.

From the sub-tasks, we have that the radius of the circle of tangency when the torus is internally tangent to the sphere is r_i = 2, and when it is externally tangent, the radius is r_o = 6. Therefore, the difference is r_i - r_o = 2 - 6 = -4. The problem asks for this difference in the form m/n where m and n are relatively prime positive integers. Since -4 can be expressed as -4/1, and we need m and n to be positive, we take the absolute value to get 4/1. Thus, m = 4 and n = 1, which are relatively prime. Therefore, m + n = 4 + 1 = 5.

The circle has a radius, which is called the minor radius of the torus. The distance from the center of the circle to the axis of revolution is called the major radius of the torus. In this problem, the circle has a radius of 3, and it is revolved around an axis that is 6 units away from the center of the circle. Therefore, the minor radius of the torus is 3, and the major radius is 6.; answer: The torus has a minor radius of 3 and a major radius of 6.\nCoT agent Tm1o, determine sphere properties, thinking: The problem describes a sphere $S$ with a radius of 11. This is a key geometric property of the sphere. The sphere is a three-dimensional object where every point on the surface is equidistant from the center. The radius is the distance from the center of the sphere to any point on its surface. In this problem, the radius of the sphere is given as 11, which means that any point on the surface of the sphere is 11 units away from its center. This property is crucial for understanding how the torus $T$ interacts with the sphere $S$, particularly when considering tangency and the circles of tangency described in the problem.; answer: The sphere $S$ has a radius of 11.\nCoT agent 0P95, determine tangency conditions, thinking: To determine the conditions for tangency between the torus and the sphere, we need to consider the geometry of both objects. The torus has a major radius of 6 and a minor radius of 3. The sphere has a radius of 11. For external tangency, the torus is outside the sphere, and the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus's generating circle (the circle being revolved) is the sum of the sphere's radius and the torus's minor radius. This distance is 11 + 3 = 14. The center of the torus's generating circle is 6 units from the center of the torus, so the center of the torus is 14 - 6 = 8 units from the center of the sphere. For internal tangency, the torus is inside the sphere, and the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus's generating circle is the difference between the sphere's radius and the torus's minor radius. This distance is 11 - 3 = 8. The center of the torus's generating circle is again 6 units from the center of the torus, so the center of the torus is 8 + 6 = 14 units from the center of the sphere. In both cases, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is the same, but the configuration of the torus relative to the sphere changes. The circles of tangency are determined by the points where the torus's generating circle is tangent to the sphere, and these circles have radii determined by the geometry of the torus and sphere at the points of tangency.; answer: For external tangency, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus's generating circle is 14 units. For internal tangency, this distance is 8 units.\nReflexion CoT agent 4neG, calculating internal tangency radius, thinking: When the torus is internally tangent to the sphere, the center of the torus's generating circle is 8 units from the center of the sphere.

For internal tangency, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus's generating circle is 8 units. The sphere has a radius of 11. The circle of tangency is formed where the torus's generating circle is tangent to the sphere. The radius of this circle of tangency is the distance from the center of the sphere to the point of tangency minus the radius of the sphere. The point of tangency is on the surface of the sphere, so the distance from the center of the sphere to the point of tangency is 11. The radius of the circle of tangency is therefore 11 - 8 = 3.; answer: 3\nCritic agent 7FJ2, providing feedback, thinking: The calculation of the internal tangency radius is incorrect. The explanation provided does not correctly account for the geometry of the torus and sphere. The distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus's generating circle should be calculated based on the geometry of the torus being internally tangent to the sphere. The correct approach involves considering the major radius of the torus and the radius of the sphere to find the correct distance and thus the correct radius of the circle of tangency.; answer: The correct calculation should consider the geometry of the torus and sphere. When the torus is internally tangent to the sphere, the center of the torus is 11 - 3 = 8 units from the center of the sphere, not 8 units as stated.

The torus has a major radius of 6 and a minor radius of 3. The sphere has a radius of 11. When the torus is internally tangent to the sphere, the center of the torus's generating circle is 8 units from the center of the sphere, as previously determined. The generating circle of the torus has a radius of 3, and its center is 6 units from the center of the torus. The circle of tangency is formed where the torus's generating circle is tangent to the sphere.

The circle of tangency is the circle formed by the points on the torus's generating circle that are tangent to the sphere. The radius of this circle of tangency is the distance from the center of the torus's generating circle to the point of tangency on the sphere. Since the generating circle has a radius of 3, and the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the generating circle is 8, the point of tangency is 3 units from the center of the generating circle, which is the radius of the generating circle itself. Therefore, the radius of the circle of tangency is 3.; answer: 3\nCritic agent 7FJ2, providing feedback, thinking: The internal tangency radius calculation provided is incorrect. The explanation states that the center of the torus's generating circle is 8 units from the center of the sphere, which is incorrect. When the torus is internally tangent to the sphere, the center of the torus is 11 - 3 = 8 units from the center of the sphere, not the center of the generating circle. The generating circle's center is 6 units from the torus's center, so it is 8 + 6 = 14 units from the sphere's center. The correct calculation should consider the distance from the sphere's center to the generating circle's center and the sphere's radius. The correct internal tangency radius is the difference between the sphere's radius and the distance from the sphere's center to the generating circle's center, which is 11 - 14 = -3, but this is not possible, indicating a misunderstanding in the setup. The correct setup should ensure the generating circle is within the sphere, which is not the case here.; answer: The correct internal tangency radius should be calculated by considering the correct distances and ensuring the generating circle is within the sphere.
