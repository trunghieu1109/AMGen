Question: Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

In the context of a torus, the 'minor radius' is the radius of the circle being revolved, and the 'major radius' is the distance from the center of the torus to the center of the tube. Here, the minor radius is 3, as it is the radius of the circle being revolved. The major radius is 6, as it is the distance from the center of the circle to the axis of revolution.; answer: The torus has a major radius of 6 and a minor radius of 3.\nCoT agent tU9i, determine geometric properties of the sphere, thinking: The problem states that the sphere S has a radius of 11. This is a direct piece of information given in the problem statement. The sphere is a three-dimensional object where every point on the surface is equidistant from the center, and this distance is the radius. Therefore, the geometric property of the sphere that is relevant here is its radius, which is 11.; answer: The sphere S has a radius of 11.\nCoT agent KYyo, understand tangency conditions, thinking: To understand the conditions for tangency between the torus and the sphere, we need to consider the geometry of both objects. The torus has a major radius of 6 and a minor radius of 3. The sphere has a radius of 11. When the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is equal to the sum of the sphere's radius and the torus's major radius. This is because the torus is 'outside' the sphere, and they touch at a single point along a circle. The radius of this circle of tangency, r_o, is the difference between the sphere's radius and the torus's minor radius. When the torus is internally tangent to the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is equal to the difference between the sphere's radius and the torus's major radius. This is because the torus is 'inside' the sphere, and they touch at a single point along a circle. The radius of this circle of tangency, r_i, is the sum of the sphere's radius and the torus's minor radius. Therefore, the conditions for tangency involve these distances and the radii of the circles of tangency.; answer: The conditions for tangency are: 1) Externally tangent: the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is the sum of the sphere's radius and the torus's major radius, and the radius of tangency circle r_o is the difference between the sphere's radius and the torus's minor radius. 2) Internally tangent: the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is the difference between the sphere's radius and the torus's major radius, and the radius of tangency circle r_i is the sum of the sphere's radius and the torus's minor radius.\nCoT agent t3Rl, derive parametric representation for r_i, thinking: To derive the parametric representation for the radius of the internal tangent circle (r_i), we need to consider the geometry of the torus and the sphere when the torus is internally tangent to the sphere. The torus has a major radius of 6 and a minor radius of 3. The sphere has a radius of 11. When the torus is internally tangent to the sphere, the center of the torus is inside the sphere. The distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is the difference between the sphere's radius and the torus's major radius. This distance is 11 - 6 = 5. The radius of the internal tangent circle (r_i) is the sum of the sphere's radius and the torus's minor radius, because the circle of tangency is formed by the torus's minor radius extending outwards from the center of the torus to the surface of the sphere. Therefore, r_i = 11 + 3 = 14.; answer: The radius of the internal tangent circle (r_i) is 14.\nCoT-SC agent RDqY, derive parametric representation for r_o, thinking: To derive the parametric representation for the radius of the external tangent circle (r_o), we consider the geometry of the torus and the sphere when they are externally tangent. The torus has a major radius (distance from the center of the torus to the center of the tube) of 6 and a minor radius (radius of the tube) of 3. The sphere has a radius of 11. When the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is the sum of the sphere's radius and the torus's major radius, which is 11 + 6 = 17. The circle of tangency is formed by the points on the torus that are closest to the sphere. Since the torus is outside the sphere, the closest points on the torus are at a distance of the torus's minor radius from the center of the torus. Therefore, the radius of the external tangent circle (r_o) is the difference between the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus and the torus's minor radius. This gives us r_o = (11 + 6) - 3 = 17 - 3 = 14.; answer: r_o = 14\nCoT-SC agent 6VK3, derive parametric representation for r_o, thinking: To derive the parametric representation for the radius of the external tangent circle (r_o), we need to consider the geometric relationship between the torus and the sphere when they are externally tangent. The center of the sphere is at a distance equal to the sum of the sphere's radius (11) and the torus's major radius (6) from the center of the torus. The torus has a minor radius of 3. When the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, they touch along a circle. The radius of this circle of tangency, r_o, can be found by considering the geometry of the situation: the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 11 + 6 = 17. However, the circle of tangency is formed where the surface of the torus, at a distance of its minor radius (3) from its center, just touches the sphere. Therefore, the radius of the circle of tangency, r_o, is given by the difference between the sphere's radius and the torus's minor radius. Thus, r_o = 11 - 3 = 8.; answer: 8\nCoT-SC agent M1c6, derive parametric representation for r_o, thinking: To derive the parametric representation for the radius of the external tangent circle (r_o), we need to analyze the geometry of the torus and the sphere when they are externally tangent. The torus has a major radius (distance from the center of the torus to the center of the circle being revolved) of 6 and a minor radius (radius of the circle being revolved) of 3. The sphere has a radius of 11. When the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, the center of the torus is at a distance equal to the sum of the sphere's radius (11) and the torus's major radius (6) from the center of the sphere. This distance is 11 + 6 = 17. The circle of tangency is formed by the points on the torus that are closest to the sphere. Since the torus is externally tangent, the radius of this circle (r_o) is the difference between the sphere's radius (11) and the torus's minor radius (3), because the torus 'wraps around' the sphere, touching it externally. Therefore, r_o = 11 - 3 = 8. This is the parametric representation of r_o in this configuration.; answer: 8\nReflexion CoT agent Oofq, transform expressions for r_i and r_o, thinking: We have already derived the expressions for the internal tangent circle radius (r_i) and the external tangent circle radius (r_o). From Sub-task 4, we found that r_i = 14. From Sub-task 5, we found that r_o = 8. To find the difference r_i - r_o, we simply subtract the expression for r_o from the expression for r_i. Therefore, r_i - r_o = 14 - 8 = 6. This difference is already in its simplest form, as 6 is an integer and does not need to be expressed as a fraction. However, if we were to express it as a fraction, it would be 6/1, where 6 and 1 are relatively prime. Thus, m = 6 and n = 1, and m + n = 6 + 1 = 7.; answer: 7\nCritic agent 0m6K, providing feedback, thinking: The transformation of r_i and r_o was correctly performed by subtracting the two values to find the difference.
