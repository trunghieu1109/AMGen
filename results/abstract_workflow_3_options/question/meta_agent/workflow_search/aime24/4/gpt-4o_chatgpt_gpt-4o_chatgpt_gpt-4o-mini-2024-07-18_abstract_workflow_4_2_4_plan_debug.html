Let $p$ be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $n^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$. Find the least positive integer $m$ such that $m^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$..

### Sub-task 9: Calculate the least positive integer m that satisfies the condition for the identified p. 

 ### thinking by Debate Agent w6PK:
The task is to find the least positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 5^2, given that the least prime p is 5. This translates to finding m such that m^4 ≡ -1 (mod 25). We test small positive integers to find the smallest m: For m = 1, m^4 + 1 = 2, not divisible by 25. For m = 2, m^4 + 1 = 17, not divisible by 25. For m = 3, m^4 + 1 = 82, which is divisible by 25. Therefore, the smallest m that satisfies the condition is m = 3.

### thinking by Debate Agent ftO4:
The problem requires finding the smallest positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2, where p is the least prime identified as 5. This translates to finding m such that m^4 ≡ -1 (mod 25). To solve this, we test small values of m: for m = 1, m^4 + 1 = 2, which is not divisible by 25; for m = 2, m^4 + 1 = 17, which is not divisible by 25; for m = 3, m^4 + 1 = 82, which is divisible by 25. Therefore, m = 3 is the smallest integer satisfying the condition.
