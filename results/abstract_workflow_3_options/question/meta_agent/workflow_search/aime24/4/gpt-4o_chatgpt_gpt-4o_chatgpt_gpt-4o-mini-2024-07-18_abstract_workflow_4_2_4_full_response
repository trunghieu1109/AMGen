This implies that n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p^2). For this congruence to hold, -1 must be a fourth power residue modulo p^2. This is a stronger condition than just n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p), which would only require -1 to be a fourth power residue modulo p. The condition that n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2 is equivalent to finding a positive integer n such that n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p^2).; answer: The condition is that there exists a positive integer n such that n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p^2).\nCoT agent Pub1, identifying least prime p, thinking: To find the least prime number p for which there exists a positive integer n such that n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2, we need to find the smallest prime p such that there exists an integer n satisfying n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p^2). This means that -1 must be a fourth power residue modulo p^2. A necessary condition is that -1 is a fourth power residue modulo p, which implies that p ≡ 1 (mod 8) because -1 is a fourth power residue modulo p if and only if p ≡ 1 (mod 8). Therefore, we need to check the smallest primes that satisfy p ≡ 1 (mod 8) and verify if there exists an n such that n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p^2).; answer: The requirement is to find the smallest prime p such that there exists a positive integer n satisfying n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p^2), which implies that -1 is a fourth power residue modulo p^2 and p ≡ 1 (mod 8).\nCoT agent 8LQW, identifying least positive integer m, thinking: To find the least positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2, where p is the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2, we need to first determine this prime p. From the previous sub-task, we know that p must be the smallest prime such that p ≡ 1 (mod 8) and there exists an n satisfying n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p^2). Once we have determined this prime p, we need to find the smallest positive integer m such that m^4 ≡ -1 (mod p^2). This means we are looking for the smallest m such that when m^4 is computed modulo p^2, the result is congruent to -1. This involves checking values of m starting from 1 and computing m^4 modulo p^2 until we find the smallest m that satisfies the condition.; answer: The requirement is to find the smallest positive integer m such that m^4 ≡ -1 (mod p^2) for the least prime p satisfying the condition from Sub-task 2.\nCoT agent LXEE, deriving parametric representation of n^4 + 1, thinking: To derive a parametric representation of n^4 + 1 in terms of divisibility by p^2, we start with the condition n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p^2). This implies that n^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod p^2). We are looking for a representation of n in terms of p such that this congruence holds. One approach is to consider n = kp + a, where k is an integer and a is a residue modulo p. Substituting n = kp + a into n^4 + 1, we have (kp + a)^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod p^2). Expanding (kp + a)^4 using the binomial theorem gives (kp)^4 + 4(kp)^3a + 6(kp)^2a^2 + 4(kp)a^3 + a^4 + 1. Since we are working modulo p^2, terms involving (kp)^3 and higher powers of kp will vanish modulo p^2, so we focus on the lower order terms. The condition becomes a^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod p^2), which simplifies to a^4 ≡ -1 (mod p^2). Therefore, the parametric representation involves finding a residue a modulo p such that a^4 ≡ -1 (mod p^2), and then n can be expressed as n = kp + a for some integer k.; answer: The parametric representation involves finding a residue a modulo p such that a^4 ≡ -1 (mod p^2), and then n can be expressed as n = kp + a for some integer k.\nCoT agent Dh3Y, deriving parametric representation of m^4 + 1, thinking: To derive the parametric representation of m^4 + 1 in terms of divisibility by p^2, we need to express the condition m^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod p^2) in a form that highlights the relationship between m and p. This condition is equivalent to m^4 ≡ -1 (mod p^2). We are looking for a way to express m in terms of p or some other parameters that satisfy this congruence. One approach is to consider the properties of the numbers involved. Since p is a prime such that there exists an n with n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p^2), it suggests that -1 is a fourth power residue modulo p^2. This means there exists some integer k such that k^4 ≡ -1 (mod p^2). Therefore, m can be expressed in terms of k, such that m ≡ k (mod p^2). However, finding an explicit parametric form for m in terms of p is non-trivial without additional information about the structure of the solutions to the congruence. In general, the parametric representation would involve finding a specific k such that k^4 ≡ -1 (mod p^2) and then expressing m in terms of k, possibly as m = k + tp^2 for some integer t, to account for all solutions. However, without further specific information about the relationship between m and p, a general parametric form is not straightforward to derive.; answer: The parametric representation involves finding an integer k such that k^4 ≡ -1 (mod p^2), and then expressing m as m ≡ k (mod p^2).\nReflexion CoT agent 9JSL, transforming expression for n^4 + 1, thinking: To transform the expression n^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod p^2), we start with the congruence n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p^2). This implies that n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2. We need to find conditions on n and p such that this congruence holds. One approach is to consider the expression n^4 + 1 in terms of its factors. Notice that n^4 + 1 can be factored as (n^2 + 1 - √2n)(n^2 + 1 + √2n) over the complex numbers, but we are interested in integer solutions. We can also consider the expression n^4 + 1 as a polynomial and analyze its roots modulo p^2. If n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p^2), then n^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod p^2), which means that n^4 is a quadratic residue modulo p^2. For this to happen, p must be a prime such that -1 is a fourth power residue modulo p^2. This is a strong condition on p, and it suggests that p must be of a special form. In particular, for small primes, we can test whether -1 is a fourth power residue modulo p^2 by checking small values of n. The smallest prime p for which there exists an n such that n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p^2) is p = 5. For p = 5, we can find n = 3 such that 3^4 + 1 = 81 + 1 = 82, which is divisible by 5^2 = 25.

This implies that m^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2. We need to find conditions on m such that this congruence holds. One approach is to consider the factorization of m^4 + 1. We can write m^4 + 1 as (m^2 + 1)^2 - (m^2)^2 = (m^2 + 1 - m^2)(m^2 + 1 + m^2) = (1)(m^2 + 1 + m^2) = (1)(2m^2 + 1). Therefore, m^4 + 1 = 2m^2 + 1. For m^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod p^2), we need 2m^2 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod p^2), which simplifies to 2m^2 ≡ -1 (mod p^2). This gives us a condition on m: m must be such that 2m^2 is congruent to -1 modulo p^2.

This is equivalent to finding the smallest prime p such that there exists an integer n satisfying n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p^2). This implies that -1 must be a fourth power residue modulo p^2. We begin by testing small prime numbers. For p = 2, n^4 + 1 is never divisible by 4 because n^4 is always congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 4. Similarly, for p = 3, n^4 + 1 is never divisible by 9. However, for p = 5, we find that n = 3 satisfies 3^4 + 1 = 81 + 1 = 82, which is divisible by 25 (5^2).

Specifically, they found that for n = 3, 3^4 + 1 = 82, which is divisible by 25 (5^2). They also checked smaller primes, such as 2 and 3, and found that no such n exists for those primes.
