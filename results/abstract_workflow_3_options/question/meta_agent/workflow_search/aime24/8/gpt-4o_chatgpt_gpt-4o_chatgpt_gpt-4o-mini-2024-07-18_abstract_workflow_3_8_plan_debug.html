    <pre>Related original question:

Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice&#39;s play..

### Sub-task 6: Convert the intermediate output into the final answer format, which is the number of positive integers n less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob can guarantee a win. 

 ### thinking by Debate Agent V1On:
The intermediate output from Sub-task 5 has already determined that there are 809 values of n for which Bob can guarantee a win. This conclusion is based on identifying the losing positions for Alice, which occur when n is of the form 5k or 5k + 1. These positions are losing for Alice because, from such positions, any move Alice makes leaves Bob in a winning position, assuming optimal play. The count of such n values is determined by calculating the possible values of k for both forms, resulting in 404 values for n = 5k and 405 values for n = 5k + 1, totaling 809. Therefore, the final answer format is simply the number 809, representing the number of positive integers n less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob can guarantee a win.

Adding these gives a total of 809 values. Therefore, the final answer is simply the number 809, representing the number of positive integers n less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob can guarantee a win.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Make final decision on final output. 

 then justify completely and detailedly why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. Again, your task is only to answer the question Sub-task 6: Make final decision on final output. and explaination.</pre>
