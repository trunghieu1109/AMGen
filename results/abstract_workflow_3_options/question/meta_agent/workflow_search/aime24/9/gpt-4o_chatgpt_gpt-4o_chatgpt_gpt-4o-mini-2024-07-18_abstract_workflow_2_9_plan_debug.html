    <pre>Related original question:

Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 6: Based on the outputs from Sub-task 4 and Sub-task 5, calculate the probability of winning the grand prize given that a prize is won. 

 ### thinking #3 by Debate Agent uPri:
To calculate the probability of winning the grand prize given that a prize is won, we use the conditional probability formula: P(Grand Prize | Prize) = P(Grand Prize and Prize) / P(Prize). From Sub-task 5, the probability of winning the grand prize (unconditionally) is 1/210. From Sub-task 4, the probability of winning a prize is 23/42. Since winning the grand prize means winning a prize (i.e., all 4 numbers match), P(Grand Prize and Prize) is the same as P(Grand Prize), which is 1/210. Therefore, the conditional probability is (1/210) / (23/42). Simplifying this, we multiply by the reciprocal: (1/210) * (42/23) = 42/4830. Simplifying 42/4830, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by 6, which gives us 7/805. Thus, the probability of winning the grand prize given that a prize is won is 7/805. Here, 7 and 805 are relatively prime, so the fraction is in its simplest form.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 7: Express the probability from subtask_6 in the form m/n and find m+n. 

 then justify completely and detailedly why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. Again, your task is only to answer the question Sub-task 7: Express the probability from subtask_6 in the form m/n and find m+n. and explaination.</pre>

    <pre>From Sub-task 6, the probability of winning the grand prize given that a prize is won is expressed as 7/805. In this fraction, m = 7 and n = 805. To find m+n, we simply add these two numbers together: 7 + 805 = 812. Therefore, the answer to Sub-task 7 is 812.
