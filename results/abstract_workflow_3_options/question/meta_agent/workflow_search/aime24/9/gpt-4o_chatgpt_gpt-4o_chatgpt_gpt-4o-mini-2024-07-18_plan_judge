Question: Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.
Iteration: abstract_workflow_1_9
proposed answer: In sub-task 6, we calculated the probability of Jen winning the grand prize given that she has won a prize. This probability was found to be 1/115, where 1 is the numerator (m) and 115 is the denominator (n) of the fraction. Since the fraction 1/115 is already in simplest form, m = 1 and n = 115. Therefore, m + n = 1 + 115 = 116. This matches the answer provided in sub-task 6, confirming that the calculation is correct.

proposed answer: From Sub-task 6, the probability of winning the grand prize given that a prize is won is expressed as 7/805. In this fraction, m = 7 and n = 805. To find m+n, we simply add these two numbers together: 7 + 805 = 812. Therefore, the answer to Sub-task 7 is 812.
