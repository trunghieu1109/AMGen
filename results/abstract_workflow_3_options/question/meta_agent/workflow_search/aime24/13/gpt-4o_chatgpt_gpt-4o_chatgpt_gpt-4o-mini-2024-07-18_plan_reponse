        "response": "The inradius of triangle ABC was determined to be 252 in the previous sub-task. To express this as a fraction in simplest form, we note that 252 can be written as 252/1. Since 252 and 1 are relatively prime, this fraction is already in simplest form. The sum of the numerator and denominator is 252 + 1 = 253. Therefore, the sum of the numerator and denominator of the inradius expressed as a fraction in simplest form is 253.\n\nAnswer:253",

        "response": "The problem involves two configurations of circles tangent to the sides of a triangle, one with circles of radius 34 and another with circles of radius 1. The key insight is the scaling relationship between these configurations. The circles in both configurations are tangent in a similar manner, suggesting that the geometric properties of the triangle, including the inradius, scale by the same factor. The ratio of the radii of the circles is 34:1, indicating that all linear dimensions of the triangle scale by a factor of 34. For the smaller circles with radius 1, the inradius is 1. Therefore, the inradius for the larger triangle with circles of radius 34 is 34 times the inradius of the smaller triangle, which is 34. This can be expressed as the fraction 34/1, where 34 and 1 are relatively prime. Hence, m = 34 and n = 1, leading to m+n = 34 + 1 = 35.\n\nAnswer:35",
