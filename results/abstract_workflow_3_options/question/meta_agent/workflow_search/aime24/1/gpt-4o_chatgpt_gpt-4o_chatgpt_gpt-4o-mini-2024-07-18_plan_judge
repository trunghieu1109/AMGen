Question: Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.

proposed answer: From the previous sub-task, we have determined that the length of segment AP is expressed as the fraction 25/2, where 25 and 2 are relatively prime integers. To find m + n, we simply add these two integers together. Since m = 25 and n = 2, their sum is 25 + 2 = 27. This calculation is straightforward and follows directly from the expression of AP in the form m/n.

proposed answer: The problem involves finding the length of segment AP in a triangle inscribed in a circle, using properties of tangents and the Power of a Point theorem. The solution provided in the related sub-task questions shows that AP is calculated as 221/15. The integers m and n are 221 and 15, respectively, which are relatively prime. Therefore, m + n is calculated as 221 + 15. The reasoning and calculations are consistent with the problem's requirements, leading to the conclusion that m + n = 236.

proposed answer: Both agents agree that the length of AP is given as \( \frac{45}{4} \), which is already in its simplest form. The integers 45 and 4 are relatively prime, meaning they have no common factors other than 1. Therefore, the fraction does not need further simplification. To find \( m + n \), we add the values of \( m \) and \( n \), which are 45 and 4, respectively. Thus, \( m + n = 45 + 4 = 49 \). Both agents have provided consistent reasoning and calculations, leading to the same conclusion. Therefore, the final decision on \( m+n \) is 49.
