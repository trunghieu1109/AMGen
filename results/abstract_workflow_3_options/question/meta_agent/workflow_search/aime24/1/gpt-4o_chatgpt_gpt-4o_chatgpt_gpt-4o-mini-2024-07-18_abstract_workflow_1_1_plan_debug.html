    <pre>Related original question:

Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 5: Express AP in the form m/n where m and n are relatively prime integers. 

 ### thinking #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent COac:
In the previous sub-tasks, it was determined that the length of segment AP is 12.5. This can be expressed as the fraction 25/2. The numbers 25 and 2 are relatively prime, meaning they have no common factors other than 1. Therefore, AP is already in the form m/n where m and n are relatively prime integers, with m = 25 and n = 2. This expression is correct and there are no limitations in terms of expressing it as a fraction of relatively prime integers. The sum m + n is 25 + 2 = 27.

### answer #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent COac:
25/2

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Calculate m + n from the expression of AP. 

 then justify completely and detailedly why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. Again, your task is only to answer the question Sub-task 6: Calculate m + n from the expression of AP. and explaination.</pre>

    <pre>From the previous sub-task, we have determined that the length of segment AP is expressed as the fraction 25/2, where 25 and 2 are relatively prime integers. To find m + n, we simply add these two integers together. Since m = 25 and n = 2, their sum is 25 + 2 = 27. This calculation is straightforward and follows directly from the expression of AP in the form m/n.
