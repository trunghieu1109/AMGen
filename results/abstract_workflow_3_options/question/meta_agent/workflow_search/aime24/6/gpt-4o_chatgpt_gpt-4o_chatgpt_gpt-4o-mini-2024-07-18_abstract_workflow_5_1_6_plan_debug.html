    <pre>Related original question:

Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$..

### Sub-task 5: Make final decision on square of radius. 

 ### thinking by Final Decision Agent 1NBw:
Both agents have correctly calculated the square of the radius as \( r^2 = \left(\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{27}{4} \). They have also verified that 27 and 4 are relatively prime, meaning the fraction is in its simplest form. Therefore, the sum \( p + q = 27 + 4 = 31 \) is correct. The final decision on the square of the radius is that it is expressed as \( \frac{27}{4} \), and the sum of the numerator and denominator is 31.

### answer by Final Decision Agent 1NBw:
31

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Based on the output of Sub-task 5, find the sum of p and q. 

 then justify completely and detailedly why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. Again, your task is only to answer the question Sub-task 6: Based on the output of Sub-task 5, find the sum of p and q. and explaination.</pre>

    <pre>The output of Sub-task 5 provides the value of r^2 as \( \frac{27}{4} \), where 27 and 4 are relatively prime integers. Therefore, p = 27 and q = 4. The sum of p and q is 27 + 4 = 31. This is consistent with the explanation given in Sub-task 5, which confirms that the sum of the numerator and denominator is 31.
