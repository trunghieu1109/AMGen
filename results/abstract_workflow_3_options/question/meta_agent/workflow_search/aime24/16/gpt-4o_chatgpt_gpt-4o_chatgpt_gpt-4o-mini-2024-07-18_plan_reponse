The formula \\( OI^2 = R^2 - 2Rr \\) is correctly applied to find \\( OI = \\sqrt{13} \\). The known result that when \\( \\overline{IA} \\perp \\overline{OI} \\), the product \\( AB \\cdot AC = 4Rr \\) is used to find \\( AB \\cdot AC = 4 \\times 13 \\times 6 = 312 \\).

        "response": "Both agents have derived the expression c^2 * a = 156(a + 2c) from the given conditions. They both assume the triangle is isosceles, which is a reasonable assumption given the condition IA \u22a5 OI. This leads to setting c = a, simplifying the equation to c^3 = 156(3c), which further simplifies to c^2 = 156. Therefore, the product AB * AC, which is c^2, is 156. The reasoning is consistent and aligns with the given conditions of the problem.\n\nAnswer:156",
