Question: Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.

proposed answer: In subtask 4, the inradius of the tetrahedron was expressed as \( \frac{6\sqrt{2}}{5} \). In this expression, \( m = 6 \), \( n = 2 \), and \( p = 5 \). The problem specifies that \( m \) and \( p \) should be relatively prime, and \( n \) should not be divisible by the square of any prime. The values \( m = 6 \) and \( p = 5 \) are relatively prime, and \( n = 2 \) is not divisible by the square of any prime. Therefore, the expression is in the correct form. The sum \( m + n + p = 6 + 2 + 5 = 13 \).

proposed answer: Both agents have independently calculated the transformed expression for the distance from the incenter to the faces of the tetrahedron as \( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \). They both agree on expressing this in the form \( \frac{m \sqrt{n}}{p} \) with \( m = 1 \), \( n = 2 \), and \( p = 2 \). These values satisfy the conditions that \( m \) and \( p \) are relatively prime, and \( n \) is not divisible by the square of any prime. Therefore, the sum \( m + n + p = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 \) is consistent and correct. Both agents have reached the same conclusion independently, providing confidence in the correctness of the result.
