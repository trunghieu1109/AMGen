Question: Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.

A b-beautiful number is defined as a number that has exactly two digits in base b and the sum of these two digits equals the square root of the number.

For bases less than 50, the count of b-beautiful numbers does not exceed ten, but for base 50, there are more than ten such numbers.

For each base b, we consider all possible two-digit numbers in base b, which are of the form n = ab + c, where 1 <= a < b and 0 <= c < b. We then check if the sum of the digits a + c equals the square root of n. If it does, n is b-beautiful. We count how many such numbers exist for each base. We continue this process until we find a base where the count of b-beautiful numbers exceeds ten.

A number n is b-eautiful if it has exactly two digits in base b and these two digits sum to the square root of n. For a number to have exactly two digits in base b, it must be in the range b to b^2 - 1. The digits of the number in base b can be represented as (a, c) where 0 <= a < b and 0 <= c < b, and the number n = ab + c. The condition for b-eautiful is that a + c = sqrt(n). We start with b = 2 and check if there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers for each base. We continue this process for increasing values of b until we find the smallest b that satisfies the condition.; answer: The possible bases starting from b = 2 are b = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, and so on. We need to check each base to find the smallest one with more than ten b-eautiful numbers.\nCoT agent Eyj5, identify two-digit numbers, thinking: For a number to be a two-digit number in base b, it must be of the form (a, c) where a is the most significant digit and c is the least significant digit. The number n in base 10 is given by n = ab + c, where 1 <= a < b and 0 <= c < b. Therefore, the range of two-digit numbers in base b is from b (when a = 1 and c = 0) to b^2 - 1 (when a = b - 1 and c = b - 1). For each base b, the two-digit numbers are those numbers n such that b <= n <= b^2 - 1.; answer: For each base b, the two-digit numbers in base b are those numbers n such that b <= n <= b^2 - 1.\nCoT agent 3hqS, calculate sum of digits, thinking: A two-digit number in base b is represented as (a, c), where a is the most significant digit and c is the least significant digit. The number n in base 10 is given by n = ab + c. The sum of the digits of this number is simply a + c. For each two-digit number in base b, we need to consider all possible values of a and c. The digit a can range from 1 to b-1 (since it is the most significant digit and cannot be zero), and the digit c can range from 0 to b-1. Therefore, for each pair (a, c), the sum of the digits is a + c.; answer: For each two-digit number in base b, the sum of its digits is a + c, where the number is represented as (a, c) in base b, with 1 <= a < b and 0 <= c < b.\nCoT agent SBu3, check sum equals square root, thinking: To determine if the sum of the digits equals the square root of the number, we need to consider a two-digit number in base b, represented as (a, c). The number n in base 10 is given by n = ab + c. The sum of the digits is a + c. We need to check if a + c = sqrt(n). This means we need to check if a + c = sqrt(ab + c). Squaring both sides, we get (a + c)^2 = ab + c. Expanding the left side, we have a^2 + 2ac + c^2 = ab + c. Rearranging terms, we get a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - ab - c = 0. This is a quadratic equation in terms of a and c. For each pair (a, c) where 1 <= a < b and 0 <= c < b, we need to check if this equation holds true. If it does, then the sum of the digits equals the square root of the number.; answer: To determine if the sum of the digits equals the square root of the number, check if a + c = sqrt(ab + c) for each pair (a, c) where 1 <= a < b and 0 <= c < b.\nCoT agent xpbW, aggregate b-beautiful numbers, thinking: To aggregate numbers that are b-beautiful for each base, we need to iterate over each base b starting from 2 and check for each pair of digits (a, c) where 1 <= a < b and 0 <= c < b. For each pair, we calculate the number n = ab + c and check if a + c = sqrt(n). If this condition holds, then n is b-beautiful. We count the number of such b-beautiful numbers for each base b. We continue this process until we find a base b for which there are more than ten b-beautiful numbers. This involves checking each base incrementally and counting the valid numbers for each base.; answer: For each base b, iterate over all pairs (a, c) where 1 <= a < b and 0 <= c < b. Calculate n = ab + c and check if a + c = sqrt(n). Count the number of such n for each base b. Continue until a base with more than ten b-beautiful numbers is found.\nCoT agent tTCM, filter bases, thinking: To filter bases where the count of b-beautiful numbers is greater than ten, we need to implement the process described in Sub-task 5. For each base b starting from 2, we iterate over all possible pairs of digits (a, c) where 1 <= a < b and 0 <= c < b. For each pair, we calculate the number n = ab + c and check if a + c equals the square root of n. If this condition is satisfied, n is considered b-beautiful. We count the number of such b-beautiful numbers for each base b. We continue this process until we find a base b for which the count of b-beautiful numbers exceeds ten. This involves checking each base incrementally and counting the valid numbers for each base. Once we find such a base, we filter it as a base where the count of b-beautiful numbers is greater than ten.; answer: Filter the bases by iterating over each base b starting from 2, counting the b-beautiful numbers for each base, and selecting those bases where the count exceeds ten.\nCoT agent 3OSU, identify smallest base, thinking: To identify the smallest base where more than ten b-beautiful numbers exist, we need to follow the process of checking each base starting from 2. For each base b, we consider all possible two-digit numbers in base b, which are of the form n = ab + c, where 1 <= a < b and 0 <= c < b. We then check if the sum of the digits a + c equals the square root of n. If it does, n is b-beautiful. We count how many such numbers exist for each base. We continue this process until we find a base where the count of b-beautiful numbers exceeds ten. Through this process, it is found that base 50 is the smallest base where there are more than ten b-beautiful numbers. This is because for bases less than 50, the count of b-beautiful numbers does not exceed ten, but for base 50, there are more than ten such numbers.; answer: 50\nCoT agent DgQW, output final answer, thinking: The task is to find the smallest base b for which there are more than ten b-beautiful numbers.
