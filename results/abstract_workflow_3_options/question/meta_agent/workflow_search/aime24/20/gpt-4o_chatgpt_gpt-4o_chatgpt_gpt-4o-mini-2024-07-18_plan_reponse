        "response": "The task is to find the smallest base b for which there are more than ten b-beautiful numbers. A b-beautiful number is defined as a number that has exactly two digits in base b and the sum of these two digits equals the square root of the number. From the previous analysis, it was determined that base 50 is the smallest base where there are more than ten b-beautiful numbers. This conclusion was reached by checking each base starting from 2 and counting the number of b-beautiful numbers for each base. For bases less than 50, the count of b-beautiful numbers does not exceed ten, but for base 50, there are more than ten such numbers. Therefore, the smallest base is 50.\n\nAnswer:50",

        "response": "Both agents have independently determined that the least integer b for which there are more than ten b-beautiful integers is 9. They both used the same method of iterating over possible values of a and c for each base b, checking the conditions for b-beautiful integers, and counting the valid pairs. Since both agents arrived at the same conclusion using a systematic approach, it is reasonable to conclude that the least integer b is indeed 9. The process involves ensuring that n = a * b + c is a perfect square and that a + c = sqrt(n), which are the defining conditions for b-beautiful integers. The agreement between the agents and the methodical approach provide confidence in the result.\n\nAnswer:9",
