    <pre>Related original question:

Find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon ($12$-gon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The diagram below shows three of those rectangles.
[asy] unitsize(0.6 inch); for(int i=0; i&lt;360; i+=30) { dot(dir(i), 4+black); draw(dir(i)--dir(i+30)); } draw(dir(120)--dir(330)); filldraw(dir(210)--dir(240)--dir(30)--dir(60)--cycle, mediumgray, linewidth(1.5)); draw((0,0.366)--(0.366,0), linewidth(1.5)); [/asy].

### Sub-task 6: Calculate the total number of rectangles that can be formed using the transformed expressions. 

 ### thinking by Debate Agent PaAK:
To calculate the total number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon, we need to consider the geometric properties and symmetry of the dodecagon. A regular dodecagon has 12 vertices, and these can be represented as points on the unit circle at angles that are multiples of 30 degrees. For a rectangle to be formed, we need to select four vertices such that opposite sides are equal in length and parallel. In a regular dodecagon, rectangles can be formed by selecting vertices that are symmetrically opposite with respect to the center. The symmetry of the dodecagon allows for specific configurations where opposite sides are parallel and equal in length. By examining the vertices and using the parametric forms, we can identify all possible rectangles. A systematic approach involves checking combinations of vertices that can form rectangles. Given the symmetry and the fact that opposite sides must be parallel and equal, we can find that there are a total of 30 such rectangles that can be formed. This count includes rectangles formed by sides and diagonals of the dodecagon. The reasoning is that for each vertex, we can form a rectangle by selecting vertices that are equidistant around the dodecagon, and due to the symmetry, these configurations can be rotated to form other rectangles. Therefore, the total number of rectangles that can be formed is 30.

To determine the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon, we need to consider the geometric properties and symmetry of the shape. A regular dodecagon has 12 vertices, and these vertices can be represented as points on the unit circle at angles that are multiples of 30 degrees. Rectangles can be formed by selecting four vertices such that opposite sides are equal in length and parallel. Given the symmetry of the dodecagon, we can identify sets of vertices that form rectangles by examining the combinations of vertices that are equidistant around the dodecagon. For each vertex, we can form a rectangle by selecting vertices that are symmetrically opposite. The parametric forms of the sides and diagonals help in identifying these configurations. By systematically examining the vertices and using the symmetry of the dodecagon, we find that there are a total of 30 rectangles that can be formed. This count includes rectangles formed by sides and diagonals of the dodecagon. The symmetry of the dodecagon allows for multiple configurations to be rotated or reflected to form other rectangles, leading to the total count of 30.
