    <pre>Related original question:

Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 5: Calculate the probability that a random coloring allows for a rotation satisfying the condition from subtask 3. 

 ### thinking #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent WDdk:
To calculate the probability that a random coloring allows for a rotation satisfying the condition from subtask 3, we need to divide the number of favorable colorings by the total number of colorings. From subtask 1, we know the total number of colorings is 256. From subtask 4, we know the number of favorable colorings is 56. Therefore, the probability is the ratio of favorable colorings to total colorings, which is 56/256. Simplifying this fraction, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 8. This gives us 7/32. Thus, the probability is 7/32. The problem states that the probability is \(\frac{m}{n}\), where \(m\) and \(n\) are relatively prime positive integers. Here, \(m = 7\) and \(n = 32\), so \(m+n = 7 + 32 = 39\).

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Express the probability as a fraction in simplest form and find the sum of the numerator and denominator. 

 then justify completely and detailedly why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. Again, your task is only to answer the question Sub-task 6: Express the probability as a fraction in simplest form and find the sum of the numerator and denominator. and explaination.</pre>

    <pre>The probability that a random coloring allows for a rotation satisfying the condition is given as 56/256. To simplify this fraction, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 56 and 256, which is 8. Dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 8, we get 7/32. This fraction is already in its simplest form because 7 and 32 are relatively prime (they have no common divisors other than 1). Therefore, the probability in simplest form is 7/32. The problem asks for the sum of the numerator and the denominator of this fraction, which is 7 + 32 = 39.
