Question: Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?

proposed answer: The problem involves finding the probability that a regular octagon, with vertices independently colored red or blue, can be rotated such that all blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices. From the sub-tasks, we determined that there are 256 possible colorings of the octagon, as each vertex can be either red or blue, giving 2^8 = 256 total configurations. For a configuration to allow such a rotation, it must have an equal number of blue and red vertices, specifically 4 of each. The number of ways to choose 4 blue vertices out of 8 is given by the binomial coefficient C(8, 4) = 70. For each such configuration, there are 2 rotations that satisfy the condition, due to the symmetry of the octagon. Therefore, there are 70 * 2 = 140 successful configurations. The probability is the number of successful configurations divided by the total number of configurations, which is 140/256. Simplifying this fraction gives 35/64, which is already in simplest form as 35 and 64 are relatively prime. Therefore, m = 35 and n = 64, and m+n = 35 + 64 = 99.

proposed answer: The probability that a random coloring allows for a rotation satisfying the condition is given as 56/256. To simplify this fraction, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 56 and 256, which is 8. Dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 8, we get 7/32. This fraction is already in its simplest form because 7 and 32 are relatively prime (they have no common divisors other than 1). Therefore, the probability in simplest form is 7/32. The problem asks for the sum of the numerator and the denominator of this fraction, which is 7 + 32 = 39.
