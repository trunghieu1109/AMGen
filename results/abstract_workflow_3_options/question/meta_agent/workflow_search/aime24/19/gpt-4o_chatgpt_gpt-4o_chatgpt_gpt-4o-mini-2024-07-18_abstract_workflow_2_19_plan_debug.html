Let $\omega\neq 1$ be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\]
is divided by 1000..

### Sub-task 3: Based on the outputs from Sub-task 1 and Sub-task 2, compute the product of the simplified expressions for k = 0 to 12. 

 ### thinking #4 by Chain-of-Thought Agent wxPO:
To compute the product \( \prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) \), we start by recognizing that \( \omega^k \) are the 13th roots of unity. The expression \( 2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k} \) can be rewritten as \( (1 - \omega^k)^2 + 1 \). However, let&#39;s consider a different approach. Notice that \( 2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k} = (1 - \omega^k)^2 + 1 \) is a transformation of the roots of unity. We can use the fact that the product of all terms of the form \( (1 - \omega^k) \) for \( k = 0 \) to 12 is 13, because it is the value of the polynomial \( x^{13} - 1 \) at \( x = 1 \), which is 0, divided by the leading coefficient of the polynomial \( x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1 \), which is 1. However, the expression \( 2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k} \) is not directly related to \( (1 - \omega^k) \) in a simple way. Instead, we need to consider the polynomial \( P(x) = \prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2x^k + x^{2k}) \) and evaluate it at \( x = 1 \). The polynomial \( P(x) \) is symmetric and can be simplified using the properties of roots of unity. The product \( \prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) \) is actually 3^{13}, because each term contributes a factor related to the 13th roots of unity, and the symmetry and properties of these roots simplify the product to a power of 3. Therefore, the remainder when this product is divided by 1000 is 159.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Based on the output of sub-task 3, apply modular arithmetic to find the remainder of the product when divided by 1000. 

 then justify completely and detailedly why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. Again, your task is only to answer the question Sub-task 4: Based on the output of sub-task 3, apply modular arithmetic to find the remainder of the product when divided by 1000. and explaination.</pre>

    <pre>In sub-task 3, it was found that the product \( \prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) \) simplifies to \( 3^{13} \). To find the remainder when this product is divided by 1000, we need to compute \( 3^{13} \mod 1000 \). We can use successive squaring to simplify this calculation. First, calculate \( 3^2 = 9 \), \( 3^4 = 81 \), \( 3^8 = 6561 \equiv 561 \mod 1000 \). Then, \( 3^{12} = (3^4)^3 = 81^3 \equiv 561 \mod 1000 \). Finally, \( 3^{13} = 3^{12} \times 3 = 561 \times 3 = 1683 \equiv 683 \mod 1000 \). Hence, the remainder when the product is divided by 1000 is 683.
