    <pre>Related original question:

Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 4: Compute Q + R using the results from subtask 3. 

 ### thinking #3 by Debate Agent uDH9:
In sub-task 3, it was determined that when the number N = 9988 is divided by 1000, the quotient Q is 9 and the remainder R is 988. To compute Q + R, we add these two values together, resulting in Q + R = 9 + 988 = 997. The calculation is straightforward and involves simple addition, ensuring accuracy. This approach is consistent with the rules of division and the results obtained in sub-task 3, confirming the correctness of the solution.

### thinking #3 by Debate Agent cWHR:
In sub-task 3, it was determined that when the number N = 9988 is divided by 1000, the quotient Q is 9 and the remainder R is 988. To find Q + R, we add these two values together. The calculation is straightforward: Q + R = 9 + 988. This results in a sum of 997. This computation is consistent with the division properties and the results provided in sub-task 3, ensuring that the solution is accurate and complete.

    <pre>Both agents uDH9 and cWHR have provided consistent and correct calculations for Q + R. They determined that when N = 9988 is divided by 1000, the quotient Q is 9 and the remainder R is 988. Adding these gives Q + R = 9 + 988 = 997. This calculation is straightforward and follows the rules of division, confirming the accuracy of the result. Therefore, the final decision on Q + R is 997.
