    <pre>Related original question:

Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$..

### Sub-task 5: Make final decision on Q and R. 

 ### thinking by Final Decision Agent xhz0:
To make a final decision on Q and R, we need to verify the division of N, which is 7776, by 1000. The quotient Q is the integer part of the division, which is how many times 1000 fits into 7776. This is 7 times, as 7000 is the largest multiple of 1000 less than or equal to 7776. The remainder R is what remains after subtracting 7000 from 7776, which is 776. Therefore, Q is 7 and R is 776. Both agents agree on this calculation, and it is consistent with the division process. Thus, the final decision is that Q is 7 and R is 776.

### answer by Final Decision Agent xhz0:
Q is 7 and R is 776.

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Calculate the sum Q + R. 

 then justify completely and detailedly why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. Again, your task is only to answer the question Sub-task 6: Calculate the sum Q + R. and explaination.</pre>

    <pre>To calculate the sum Q + R, we use the values of Q and R obtained from the previous sub-task. We have Q = 7 and R = 776. The sum Q + R is simply the addition of these two values: 7 + 776. Performing the addition gives us 783. Therefore, the sum Q + R is 783.
