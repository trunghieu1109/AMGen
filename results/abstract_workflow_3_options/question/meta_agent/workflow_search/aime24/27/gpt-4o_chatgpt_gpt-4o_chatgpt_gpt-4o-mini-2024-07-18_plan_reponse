        "response": "Both agents uDH9 and cWHR have provided consistent and correct calculations for Q + R. They determined that when N = 9988 is divided by 1000, the quotient Q is 9 and the remainder R is 988. Adding these gives Q + R = 9 + 988 = 997. This calculation is straightforward and follows the rules of division, confirming the accuracy of the result. Therefore, the final decision on Q + R is 997.\n\nAnswer:997",
