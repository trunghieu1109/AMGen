        "response": "Both agents KIQv and K64J have independently calculated the sum of the elements of set A, which is {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11}. They both performed the addition step-by-step and arrived at the same result. The calculations are as follows: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 = 61. Each step of the addition was verified, and the final sum is consistent across both agents. Therefore, the final decision on the sum of the elements of set A is 61.\n\nAnswer:61",
