Question: There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\times5$ grid such that: 

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.
Iteration: abstract_workflow_1_29
proposed answer: The problem requires placing 25 indistinguishable white chips and 25 indistinguishable black chips on a 5x5 grid such that each row and column is uniformly colored, and no additional chip can be placed without violating these conditions. The only way to achieve this is to have either 3 rows and 3 columns filled with one color and the remaining 2 rows and 2 columns filled with the other color, or the reverse configuration. This ensures that the grid is completely filled and each row and column is uniformly colored. Any deviation from these configurations would result in a non-uniform distribution of chip colors in either the rows or columns, violating the problem's conditions. Therefore, there are exactly two valid configurations, leading to a total of 2 ways to place the chips.

Iteration: abstract_workflow_2_29
proposed answer: To integrate the validated configurations and compute the final number of ways to place the chips, we need to consider the two distinct configurations identified in Sub-task 5. Each configuration involves filling the grid such that all rows are of one color and all columns are of the other color. The first configuration is where all rows are filled with white chips and all columns with black chips, and the second configuration is where all rows are filled with black chips and all columns with white chips. Since there are 25 white chips and 25 black chips available, each configuration uses all the chips exactly once, satisfying the condition that any additional chip placed would violate the rules. Therefore, the total number of ways to place the chips is the sum of the two distinct configurations, which is 2.
