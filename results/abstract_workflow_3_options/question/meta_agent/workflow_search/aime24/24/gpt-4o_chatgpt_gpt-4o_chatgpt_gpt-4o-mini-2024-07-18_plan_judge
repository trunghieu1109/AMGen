Question: Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations:
\[\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}\]\[\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}\]\[\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}\]
Then the value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.
Iteration: abstract_workflow_1_1_24
proposed answer: In subtask 5, we determined that the value of |log2(x^4y^3z^2)| is 1/2. This fraction is already in its simplest form, where the numerator m is 1 and the denominator n is 2. To find m+n, we add these two numbers together: 1 + 2 = 3. The reasoning is consistent with the calculations and simplifications performed in subtask 5, and the fraction 1/2 is indeed in simplest form. Therefore, m+n = 3.

proposed answer: From the previous sub-task, we determined that the expression |log2(x^4y^3z^2)| simplifies to 25/8, where m = 25 and n = 8. To find the final answer, we need to calculate m + n, which is 25 + 8. This gives us the result 33.
