    <pre>Related original question:

Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations:
\[\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}\]\[\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}\]\[\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}\]
Then the value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.. 

Related sub-task questions and answers:

### Sub-task 9: Determine the values of m and n such that the expression is in the form m/n, and they are relatively prime. 

 ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent gngB:
The expression |log2(x^4y^3z^2)| was calculated to be 75/24. To ensure m and n are relatively prime, we simplify 75/24 by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 75 and 24. The prime factorization of 75 is 3 * 5^2, and for 24, it is 2^3 * 3. The GCD is 3. Dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 3, we get 25/8. Since 25 and 8 have no common factors other than 1, they are relatively prime. Therefore, m = 25 and n = 8.

### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent gngB:
25, 8

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 10: Calculate m + n to find the final answer. 

 then justify completely and detailedly why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. Again, your task is only to answer the question Sub-task 10: Calculate m + n to find the final answer. and explaination.</pre>

    <pre>From the previous sub-task, we determined that the expression |log2(x^4y^3z^2)| simplifies to 25/8, where m = 25 and n = 8. To find the final answer, we need to calculate m + n, which is 25 + 8. This gives us the result 33.
