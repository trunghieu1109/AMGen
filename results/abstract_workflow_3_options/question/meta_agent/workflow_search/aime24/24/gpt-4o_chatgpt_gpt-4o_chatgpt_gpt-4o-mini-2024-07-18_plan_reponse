        "response": "In subtask 5, we determined that the value of |log2(x^4y^3z^2)| is 1/2. This fraction is already in its simplest form, where the numerator m is 1 and the denominator n is 2. To find m+n, we add these two numbers together: 1 + 2 = 3. The reasoning is consistent with the calculations and simplifications performed in subtask 5, and the fraction 1/2 is indeed in simplest form. Therefore, m+n = 3.\n\nAnswer:3",
