    <pre>Related original question:

Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). Then \(OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\)..

### Sub-task 8: Make a final decision on OC^2. 

 ### thinking by Final Decision Agent TH57:
To make a final decision on OC^2, we need to verify the calculations and reasoning provided. The point C is on the segment AB, which is parameterized as C(t) = ((1-t)/2, t√3/2). The condition that C does not belong to any segment from the family F other than AB itself implies that the line through P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis, both at a distance of 1 from each other, is tangent to the circle x^2 + y^2 = 1. Solving for the parameter t that satisfies this condition, we find C(t) = (1/4, √3/4). Calculating OC^2 using these coordinates gives OC^2 = (1/4)^2 + (√3/4)^2 = 1/16 + 3/16 = 4/16 = 1/4. Since 1 and 4 are relatively prime, we have p = 1 and q = 4, leading to p + q = 5. Both agents agree on this calculation, and the reasoning is consistent with the problem&#39;s conditions. Therefore, the final decision is that OC^2 = 1/4, and p + q = 5.

### answer by Final Decision Agent TH57:
5

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 9: Find the sum p + q. 

 then justify completely and detailedly why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. Again, your task is only to answer the question Sub-task 9: Find the sum p + q. and explaination.</pre>
