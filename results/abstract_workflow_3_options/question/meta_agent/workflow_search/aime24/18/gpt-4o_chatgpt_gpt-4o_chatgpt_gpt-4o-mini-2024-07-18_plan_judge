Question: Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). Then \(OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\).
Iteration: abstract_workflow_5_1_18
proposed answer: The problem involves finding the sum of p and q, where OC^2 = \(\frac{p}{q}\) and p and q are relatively prime integers. From the previous sub-task, we determined that the point C on \(\overline{AB}\) is \(C\left(\frac{1}{4}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}\right)\). The distance squared from the origin O(0,0) to C is calculated using the distance formula: \(OC^2 = \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}\right)^2\). This results in \(OC^2 = \frac{1}{16} + \frac{3}{16} = \frac{4}{16} = \frac{1}{4}\). Here, p = 1 and q = 4, which are relatively prime. Therefore, the sum p + q = 1 + 4 = 5. This calculation is consistent with the previous sub-task's conclusion.

proposed answer: The problem involves finding a unique point C on the segment AB such that it does not belong to any segment from the family F other than AB itself. The segment AB is parameterized as C(t) = ((1-t)/2, t√3/2). The condition that C does not belong to any segment from the family F other than AB implies that the line through P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis, both at a distance of 1 from each other, is tangent to the circle x^2 + y^2 = 1. Solving for the parameter t that satisfies this condition, we find C(t) = (1/4, √3/4). Calculating OC^2 using these coordinates gives OC^2 = (1/4)^2 + (√3/4)^2 = 1/16 + 3/16 = 4/16 = 1/4. Since 1 and 4 are relatively prime, we have p = 1 and q = 4, leading to p + q = 5. This reasoning is consistent with the problem's conditions and the calculations provided in the related sub-task. Therefore, the sum p + q is 5.
