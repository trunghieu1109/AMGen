    <pre>Related original question:

Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). Then \(OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\)..

### Sub-task 6: Make final decision on OC^2. 

 ### thinking by Final Decision Agent LVdw:
To determine OC^2, we need to calculate the square of the distance from the origin O(0,0) to the point C(\frac{1}{4}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}). Using the distance formula, OC^2 = (\frac{1}{4})^2 + (\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4})^2. Calculating each term, we find (\frac{1}{4})^2 = \frac{1}{16} and (\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4})^2 = \frac{3}{16}. Adding these fractions gives OC^2 = \frac{1}{16} + \frac{3}{16} = \frac{4}{16}. Simplifying \frac{4}{16}, we get \frac{1}{4}. Therefore, OC^2 = \frac{1}{4}, where p = 1 and q = 4, which are relatively prime. Therefore, p + q = 1 + 4 = 5. Both agents agree on this calculation, and the reasoning is consistent and correct.

### answer by Final Decision Agent LVdw:
5

Given the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 7: Find the sum p + q. 

 then justify completely and detailedly why you think so in the &#34;thinking&#34; entry. Again, your task is only to answer the question Sub-task 7: Find the sum p + q. and explaination.</pre>

    <pre>The problem involves finding the sum of p and q, where OC^2 = \(\frac{p}{q}\) and p and q are relatively prime integers. From the previous sub-task, we determined that the point C on \(\overline{AB}\) is \(C\left(\frac{1}{4}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}\right)\). The distance squared from the origin O(0,0) to C is calculated using the distance formula: \(OC^2 = \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}\right)^2\). This results in \(OC^2 = \frac{1}{16} + \frac{3}{16} = \frac{4}{16} = \frac{1}{4}\). Here, p = 1 and q = 4, which are relatively prime. Therefore, the sum p + q = 1 + 4 = 5. This calculation is consistent with the previous sub-task&#39;s conclusion.
