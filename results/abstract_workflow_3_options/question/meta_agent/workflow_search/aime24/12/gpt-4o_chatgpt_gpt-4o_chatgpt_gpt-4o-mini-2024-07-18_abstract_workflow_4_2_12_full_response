This is expressed as |z| = 4. The magnitude of a complex number z = x + yi is given by |z| = sqrt(x^2 + y^2). Therefore, the constraint |z| = 4 means that the complex number z lies on a circle of radius 4 in the complex plane, centered at the origin. This constraint is crucial for solving the problem as it limits the possible values of z that can be used to maximize the real part of the given expression.; answer: |z| = 4\nCoT agent YSlq, deriving parametric representation of z, thinking: The constraint |z| = 4 implies that z lies on a circle of radius 4 centered at the origin in the complex plane. A complex number z can be represented in polar form as z = re^(iθ), where r is the magnitude of z and θ is the argument (angle) of z. Given |z| = 4, we have r = 4. Therefore, z can be expressed as z = 4e^(iθ). In terms of Cartesian coordinates, this can be written as z = 4(cos(θ) + i sin(θ)), where θ is the angle that z makes with the positive real axis.
