    "thought": "The problem involves finding the total time (in minutes) Aya takes for a 9 km walk at a specific speed, including time spent at a coffee shop. We're given two scenarios where she walks at different speeds and total durations. From these, we can set up equations to solve for her walking speed 's' and the time 't' spent at the coffee shop. We'll then use these to calculate the total time when walking at s + 0.5 km/h. The workflow will follow multi-agent reasoning with Chain-of-Thought for equation setup, Self-Consistency for solving equations, and Reflexion for validation.",
