Similarly, the mass of Star_1 is also 1.5 times that of Star_2, so if we denote the mass of Star_2 as M, then the mass of Star_1 is 1.5M. The fact that both stars have the same peak wavelength indicates that they have the same temperature, which is a crucial point because it implies that their luminosities will be determined primarily by their radii according to the Stefan-Boltzmann Law. The radial velocities are given as 0 km/s for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2, but this information does not directly affect the luminosity calculations. Therefore, the key points to summarize are: Star_1 has a radius of 1.5R and mass of 1.5M, Star_2 has a radius of R and mass of M, both stars have the same temperature, and their radial velocities are 0 km/s and 700 km/s respectively.\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent 0rv9:\nA)\n\n### Sub-task 2: Determine the relationship between the stars\' radii and their luminosities using the Stefan-Boltzmann Law, given that they have the same temperature. \n\n ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent THRe:\nTo determine the relationship between the stars\' radii and their luminosities using the Stefan-Boltzmann Law, we start by recalling that the luminosity L of a black body is given by the formula L = 4πR^2σT^4, where R is the radius, T is the temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since both stars have the same temperature (as indicated by their same peak wavelength), the temperature T cancels out when we compare the luminosities of the two stars. We denote the radius of Star_2 as R and the radius of Star_1 as 1.5R. Therefore, the luminosity of Star_2 is L_2 = 4πR^2σT^4 and the luminosity of Star_1 is L_1 = 4π(1.5R)^2σT^4. Simplifying L_1 gives us L_1 = 4π(2.25R^2)σT^4 = 2.25 * L_2. This shows that Star_1\'s luminosity is greater than Star_2\'s luminosity by a factor of 2.25, directly resulting from the difference in their radii, while their temperatures remain equal. Thus, the relationship between the stars\' radii and their luminosities, given the same temperature, clearly indicates that the luminosity of Star_1 is 2.25 times that of Star_2.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent iylt:\nTo determine the relationship between the stars\' radii and their luminosities, we can use the Stefan-Boltzmann Law, which states that the luminosity (L) of a black body is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature (T) and the square of its radius (R): L = 4πR^2σT^4. Since both stars have the same temperature, the luminosity ratio will depend solely on the radius ratio. Given that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, we can express the radii as R1 = 1.5R2. Plugging this into the luminosity formula, we find that the luminosity of Star_1 (L1) is proportional to (1.5R2)^2, which simplifies to 2.25R2^2. The luminosity of Star_2 (L2) is proportional to R2^2. Thus, the ratio of the luminosities is L1/L2 = (2.25R2^2)/R2^2 = 2.25. Therefore, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of 2.25, which leads us to conclude that the answer is approximately 2.25.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent s6mt:\nTo determine the relationship between the stars\' radii and their luminosities using the Stefan-Boltzmann Law, we first recall that the luminosity (L) of a black body is given by the equation L = 4πR^2σT^4, where R is the radius, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature. Since both stars have the same temperature (as indicated by their same peak wavelength), we can simplify the comparison of their luminosities to a function of their radii alone. If we denote the radius of Star_2 as R and the radius of Star_1 as 1.5R (since Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger), we can express the luminosities as follows: L_1 = 4π(1.5R)^2σT^4 and L_2 = 4πR^2σT^4. Simplifying L_1 gives us L_1 = 4π(2.25R^2)σT^4 = 2.25 * (4πR^2σT^4) = 2.25 * L_2.

Similarly, the mass of Star_1 is also 1.5 times that of Star_2, so if we denote the mass of Star_2 as M, then the mass of Star_1 is 1.5M. The fact that both stars have the same peak wavelength indicates that they have the same temperature, which is a crucial point because it implies that their luminosities will be determined primarily by their radii according to the Stefan-Boltzmann Law. The radial velocities are given as 0 km/s for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2, but this information does not directly affect the luminosity calculations. Therefore, the key points to summarize are: Star_1 has a radius of 1.5R and mass of 1.5M, Star_2 has a radius of R and mass of M, both stars have the same temperature, and their radial velocities are 0 km/s and 700 km/s respectively.\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent 0rv9:\nA)\n\n### Sub-task 2: Determine the relationship between the stars\' radii and their luminosities using the Stefan-Boltzmann Law, given that they have the same temperature. \n\n ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent THRe:\nTo determine the relationship between the stars\' radii and their luminosities using the Stefan-Boltzmann Law, we start by recalling that the luminosity L of a black body is given by the formula L = 4πR^2σT^4, where R is the radius, T is the temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since both stars have the same temperature (as indicated by their same peak wavelength), the temperature T cancels out when we compare the luminosities of the two stars. We denote the radius of Star_2 as R and the radius of Star_1 as 1.5R. Therefore, the luminosity of Star_2 is L_2 = 4πR^2σT^4 and the luminosity of Star_1 is L_1 = 4π(1.5R)^2σT^4. Simplifying L_1 gives us L_1 = 4π(2.25R^2)σT^4 = 2.25 * L_2. This shows that Star_1\'s luminosity is greater than Star_2\'s luminosity by a factor of 2.25, directly resulting from the difference in their radii, while their temperatures remain equal. Thus, the relationship between the stars\' radii and their luminosities, given the same temperature, clearly indicates that the luminosity of Star_1 is 2.25 times that of Star_2.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent iylt:\nTo determine the relationship between the stars\' radii and their luminosities, we can use the Stefan-Boltzmann Law, which states that the luminosity (L) of a black body is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature (T) and the square of its radius (R): L = 4πR^2σT^4. Since both stars have the same temperature, the luminosity ratio will depend solely on the radius ratio. Given that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, we can express the radii as R1 = 1.5R2. Plugging this into the luminosity formula, we find that the luminosity of Star_1 (L1) is proportional to (1.5R2)^2, which simplifies to 2.25R2^2. The luminosity of Star_2 (L2) is proportional to R2^2. Thus, the ratio of the luminosities is L1/L2 = (2.25R2^2)/R2^2 = 2.25. Therefore, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of 2.25, which leads us to conclude that the answer is approximately 2.25.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent s6mt:\nTo determine the relationship between the stars\' radii and their luminosities using the Stefan-Boltzmann Law, we first recall that the luminosity (L) of a black body is given by the equation L = 4πR^2σT^4, where R is the radius, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.

In Sub-task 2 the reasoning applied Wien’s law directly to the observed λ_peaks, equating T₁=T₂. That step is invalid when one star is receding at 700\u2009km/s: its observed λ_peak is red-shifted, so its true (rest-frame) λ_peak=λ_obs/(1+v/c) and its temperature is slightly higher. Because the agents never applied a Doppler correction, they carried forward the wrong temperature assumption into the Stefan–Boltzmann calculation and got 2.25 instead of the correct ≈2.23.', 'suggestion': 'Introduce an explicit Doppler-correction subtask immediately after extracting velocities: 1) compute each star’s rest-frame λ_peak = λ_obs/(1±v/c), 2) derive T_i from Wien’s law, then 3) plug R and T into L=4πR²σT⁴. Ensure the context from the velocity subtask is passed into the temperature subtask so that agents account for radial motion when applying Wien’s law.'}}, {'verifier_name': 'gpt-4.1-mini', 'evaluation': {'failure_reason': "The previous reasoning process failed because it overlooked the effect of the stars' radial velocities on the observed peak wavelength and thus on the temperature estimation, leading to an incorrect assumption that both stars have the same temperature. This caused the luminosity ratio calculation to rely solely on the radius ratio squared, ignoring relativistic Doppler shifts that affect the observed peak wavelength and inferred temperature, resulting in an inaccurate luminosity factor.", 'feedback': "The core error in the reasoning lies in the assumption that the stars have the same temperature because their observed peak wavelengths are the same. However, the problem states that Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s relative to Star_1 (which has 0 km/s). This relative motion causes a Doppler shift in the observed wavelength of Star_2, meaning the intrinsic peak wavelength (and thus temperature) of Star_2 is not actually the same as that of Star_1. The previous agents failed to account for this relativistic Doppler effect, which alters the observed peak wavelength and therefore the inferred temperature via Wien's Law. Since luminosity depends on T^4, even a small difference in temperature significantly affects the luminosity ratio. By ignoring this, the agents simplified the problem to a ratio of radii squared (2.25), which is incorrect. The error originated in the initial interpretation and persisted through all subtasks, as none incorporated the Doppler correction to temperature. The context provided was insufficient because it did not emphasize or require consideration of the Doppler effect on the observed peak wavelength and temperature. The agents' collaboration pattern (mostly chain-of-thought and synthesis) was effective for straightforward problems but failed here due to missing a critical physical effect. The subtasks passed outputs correctly but lacked a subtask or prompt to verify or challenge the assumption about temperature equality given the radial velocities. This missing step caused the error to propagate unchecked through the workflow.", 'suggestion': 'To improve the workflow, introduce an explicit subtask early in the process to analyze the impact of radial velocities on the observed peak wavelengths and the inferred temperatures of the stars, incorporating relativistic Doppler shift corrections. This subtask should verify whether the assumption of equal temperatures holds or needs adjustment. Use a stronger collaboration pattern such as Reflexion or Debate at this stage to critically evaluate assumptions about temperature equality. Additionally, enhance the context passed between subtasks by including the radial velocity data alongside the peak wavelength information and explicitly prompt agents to consider Doppler effects on temperature estimation. This will prevent the propagation of incorrect assumptions and lead to a more accurate luminosity ratio calculation.'}}]

Similarly, the mass of Star_1 is also 1.5 times that of Star_2, so if we denote the mass of Star_2 as M, then the mass of Star_1 is 1.5M.

Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s moving away from the observer. When an object moves away from an observer, the observed wavelength is redshifted. The formula for the redshift (z) due to the Doppler effect for non-relativistic speeds is given by z = v/c, where v is the velocity of the object and c is the speed of light (approximately 300,000 km/s). Therefore, the redshift can be calculated as z = 700 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.00233. The observed wavelength (λ_observed) is related to the rest-frame wavelength (λ_rest) by the equation λ_observed = λ_rest * (1 + z). Rearranging this gives us λ_rest = λ_observed / (1 + z). Since we know the observed peak wavelength is the same for both stars, we can denote it as λ_observed. Substituting the redshift into the equation, we can find the rest-frame peak wavelength for Star_2. This shows that the rest-frame wavelength will be slightly shorter than the observed wavelength due to the redshift caused by the star\'s motion away from the observer.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent TpZQ:\nTo determine the rest-frame peak wavelength of Star_2, we need to apply the Doppler effect formula for light. Since Star_2 is moving away from the observer at a radial velocity of 700 km/s, we will use the redshift formula. The redshift (z) can be calculated using the formula z = v/c, where v is the radial velocity and c is the speed of light (approximately 300,000 km/s). For Star_2, z = 700 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.00233. The observed wavelength (λ_observed) is related to the rest-frame wavelength (λ_rest) by the equation λ_observed = λ_rest * (1 + z). Rearranging this gives us λ_rest = λ_observed / (1 + z). Since the problem states that both stars have the same peak wavelength, we can denote this common wavelength as λ. Thus, λ_rest for Star_2 can be calculated using the observed wavelength λ and the calculated z. This will yield the rest-frame peak wavelength of Star_2. Therefore, the answer to the question requires applying the Doppler correction based on the redshift caused by the motion of Star_2 away from the observer.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent BkpZ:\nTo apply the Doppler correction to the observed peak wavelength of Star_2, we need to consider the effect of its radial velocity on the observed wavelength. The radial velocity of Star_2 is given as 700 km/s, which indicates that it is moving away from the observer. According to the Doppler effect for light, when a source is moving away from the observer, the observed wavelength increases (redshift). The formula for the observed wavelength (\x03BB_observed) in terms of the rest-frame wavelength (\x03BB_rest) and the radial velocity (v) is given by: \n\n\x03BB_observed = \x03BB_rest * (1 + v/c) \n\nwhere c is the speed of light (approximately 300,000 km/s). Rearranging this formula allows us to express the rest-frame wavelength as: \n\n\x03BB_rest = \x03BB_observed / (1 + v/c) \n\nNow, since the problem states that both stars have the same peak wavelength, we can denote this common peak wavelength as \x03BB. Thus, we can substitute \x03BB_observed with \x03BB. \n\nSubstituting the values: \n- v = 700 km/s \n- c = 300,000 km/s \n\nWe calculate: \n1. Calculate v/c: \n   v/c = 700 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.00233 \n2. Calculate the denominator: \n   1 + v/c = 1 + 0.00233 = 1.00233 \n3. Now, substituting back into the formula: \n   \x03BB_rest = \x03BB / 1.00233 \n\nThis gives us the rest-frame peak wavelength of Star_2. The exact value of \x03BB is not provided in the original question, but this formula will allow us to compute the rest-frame wavelength once \x03BB is known. Therefore, the rest-frame peak wavelength of Star_2 can be determined using the Doppler correction formula, which accounts for its motion away from the observer.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent kRJI:\nTo apply the Doppler correction to the observed peak wavelength of Star_2, we need to account for the radial velocity of Star_2, which is moving away from the observer at 700 km/s. The Doppler effect for light can be described by the formula: λ\' = λ √((1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c)), where λ\' is the observed wavelength, λ is the rest-frame wavelength, v is the radial velocity, and c is the speed of light (approximately 300,000 km/s). Since Star_2 is moving away, we will use a positive value for v. After determining the observed wavelength from the peak brightness data, we can rearrange the formula to solve for λ, the rest-frame peak wavelength. This will allow us to find the actual wavelength of light emitted by Star_2 without the influence of its motion relative to the observer. Therefore, the rest-frame peak wavelength can be calculated once we have the observed wavelength and apply the Doppler correction accordingly.\n\n### answer #1 by Debate Agent W3gM:\nA\n\n### answer #1 by Debate Agent TpZQ:\nA\n\n### answer #1 by Debate Agent BkpZ:\nA\n\n### answer #1 by Debate Agent kRJI:\nA\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 2: Apply Doppler correctionGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer. \n\n then justify completely and detailedly, step-by-step why you think so in the "thinking" entry. \n                Consider all cases that are possible to happen.\n                Avoid some unclear explainations, such as "Using the circle equation or the condition for four points to be concyclic, we derive an equation in x.

Similarly, the mass of Star_1 is also 1.5 times that of Star_2, so if we denote the mass of Star_2 as M, then the mass of Star_1 is 1.5M. The peak wavelengths of both stars are the same, indicating that they have the same temperature according to Wien\'s Law, which states that the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature. The radial velocities are given as 0 km/s for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2, which indicates that Star_1 is stationary relative to the observer while Star_2 is moving away. This information is crucial for understanding the luminosity calculations, as luminosity depends on both the radius and the temperature of the stars. Since both stars have the same temperature, the difference in luminosity will primarily come from the difference in their radii, which is a factor of 1.5. Therefore, the luminosity of Star_1 will be greater than that of Star_2 by a factor that can be calculated using the Stefan-Boltzmann Law, which states that luminosity is proportional to the square of the radius times the fourth power of the temperature. Since the temperature is the same, the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 exceeds that of Star_2 can be derived from the radius ratio alone, leading to a factor of (1.5^2) = 2.25. Thus, the summary of the information is: Star_1 has a radius of 1.5R, mass of 1.5M, peak wavelength same as Star_2, and radial velocities of 0 km/s for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2.\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent uWhN:\nA\n\n### Sub-task 2: Apply the Doppler correction to the observed peak wavelength of Star_2 to determine its rest-frame peak wavelength. \n\n ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent W3gM:\nTo determine the rest-frame peak wavelength of Star_2, we need to apply the Doppler effect. Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s moving away from the observer. When an object moves away from an observer, the observed wavelength is redshifted.

The Doppler effect for light states that when a source is moving away, the observed wavelength is redshifted. The formula for the redshift (z) is given by z = v/c, where v is the velocity of the object and c is the speed of light (approximately 300,000 km/s). For Star_2, we calculate the redshift as z = 700 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.00233. The observed wavelength (λ_observed) is related to the rest-frame wavelength (λ_rest) by the equation λ_observed = λ_rest * (1 + z). Rearranging this gives us λ_rest = λ_observed / (1 + z). Since both stars have the same peak wavelength, we denote this common wavelength as λ. Thus, we can find the rest-frame peak wavelength for Star_2 using the observed wavelength and the calculated z. This shows that the rest-frame wavelength will be slightly shorter than the observed wavelength due to the redshift caused by the star\'s motion away from the observer. Therefore, the answer to the question requires applying the Doppler correction based on the redshift caused by the motion of Star_2 away from the observer.\n\n### answer by Final Decision Agent W9Ib:\nA\n\n### Sub-task 3: Calculate the temperatures of both stars using Wien\'s Law, incorporating the corrected peak wavelength for Star_2. \n\n ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent K77v:\nTo calculate the temperatures of both stars using Wien\'s Law, we need to understand that Wien\'s Law states that the peak wavelength (λ_max) of black body radiation is inversely proportional to the temperature (T) of the body. The formula is given by λ_max * T = b, where b is Wien\'s displacement constant (approximately 2898 μm·K). Since both stars are said to have the same peak wavelength, we can denote this common peak wavelength as λ. For Star_2, we need to apply the Doppler correction to find its rest-frame peak wavelength. Given the radial velocity of Star_2 (700 km/s) and using the redshift formula, we calculated the redshift (z) to be 0.00233. This leads to the relationship λ_rest = λ_observed / (1 + z). Once we find the rest-frame wavelength for Star_2, we can use Wien\'s Law to calculate the temperature of both stars. The temperature for Star_1 can be found directly using the same peak wavelength λ. We then compare the temperatures derived from the corrected peak wavelength for Star_2 and the original peak wavelength for Star_1. This process will yield the temperatures of both stars accurately, ensuring that we account for the effects of the Doppler shift on Star_2\'s observed wavelength.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent hXzl:\nTo calculate the temperatures of both stars using Wien\'s Law, we start with the formula which states that the peak wavelength (λ_max) is inversely proportional to the temperature (T) of a black body: T = b / λ_max, where b is Wien\'s displacement constant (approximately 2898 µm·K). Since both stars have the same peak wavelength, we can denote this common wavelength as λ. For Star_2, we need to account for the Doppler effect due to its radial velocity of 700 km/s. We calculated the redshift (z) for Star_2 to be 0.00233, which means the observed wavelength (λ_observed) is longer than the rest-frame wavelength (λ_rest). The rest-frame wavelength can be calculated as λ_rest = λ_observed / (1 + z). Once we have λ_rest, we can use Wien\'s Law to find the temperature of Star_2. Since Star_1 has the same peak wavelength as Star_2, its temperature will be the same as well. Thus, the calculations will yield the temperature for both stars based on the corrected peak wavelength for Star_2.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent 1oQ1:\nTo calculate the temperatures of both stars using Wien\'s Law, we first need to understand that Wien\'s Law states that the peak wavelength (λ_max) of radiation emitted by a black body is inversely proportional to its temperature (T). The relationship is given by the formula: T = b / λ_max, where b is Wien\'s displacement constant (approximately 2898 µm·K). Since both stars have the same peak wavelength, we can denote this common wavelength as λ. For Star_1, we can use the same λ for temperature calculation. For Star_2, we need to apply the Doppler correction to find the rest-frame peak wavelength. The redshift (z) calculated for Star_2 was 0.00233, which means the observed wavelength (λ_observed) is longer than the rest-frame wavelength (λ_rest). Thus, we can find λ_rest by using the equation λ_rest = λ_observed / (1 + z). This corrected wavelength will then be used in Wien\'s Law to find the temperature of Star_2. Since both stars are assumed to be black bodies with the same peak wavelength, we can conclude that they will have the same temperature if we do not account for the Doppler effect. However, since Star_2 is redshifted, we will find a slightly higher temperature for Star_1 than for Star_2. Therefore, the calculations will show that Star_1 has a higher temperature than Star_2 due to the corrected peak wavelength of Star_2 being slightly shorter than that of Star_1.\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent K77v:\nA\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent hXzl:\nA\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent 1oQ1:\nA\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 3: Calculate temperaturesGiven all the above thinking and answers, find the most consistent and correct solutions for the temperature calculation. \n\n then justify completely and detailedly, step-by-step why you think so in the "thinking" entry. \n                Consider all cases that are possible to happen.\n                Avoid some unclear explainations, such as "Using the circle equation or the condition for four points to be concyclic, we derive an equation in x.

Similarly, the mass of Star_1 is also 1.5 times that of Star_2, so if we denote the mass of Star_2 as M, then the mass of Star_1 is 1.5M. The peak wavelengths of both stars are the same, indicating that they have the same temperature according to Wien\'s Law, which states that the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature. The radial velocities are given as 0 km/s for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2, which indicates that Star_1 is stationary relative to the observer while Star_2 is moving away. This information is crucial for understanding the luminosity calculations, as luminosity depends on both the radius and the temperature of the stars. Since both stars have the same temperature, the difference in luminosity will primarily come from the difference in their radii, which is a factor of 1.5. Therefore, the luminosity of Star_1 will be greater than that of Star_2 by a factor that can be calculated using the Stefan-Boltzmann Law, which states that luminosity is proportional to the square of the radius times the fourth power of the temperature. Since the temperature is the same, the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 exceeds that of Star_2 can be derived from the radius ratio alone, leading to a factor of (1.5^2) = 2.25. Thus, the summary of the information is: Star_1 has a radius of 1.5R, mass of 1.5M, peak wavelength same as Star_2, and radial velocities of 0 km/s for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2.\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent uWhN:\nA\n\n### Sub-task 2: Apply Doppler correctionGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer. \n\n ### thinking by Final Decision Agent W9Ib:\nTo apply the Doppler correction to the observed peak wavelength of Star_2, we need to consider its radial velocity of 700 km/s, which indicates it is moving away from the observer.

Since both stars have the same peak wavelength, they have the same temperature according to Wien\'s Law. Therefore, we can denote the temperature of both stars as T. The radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2, so if we denote the radius of Star_2 as R, then the radius of Star_1 is 1.5R. Now, we can express the luminosities of both stars: L_1 = 4π(1.5R)^2σT^4 and L_2 = 4πR^2σT^4. Simplifying L_1 gives us L_1 = 4π(2.25R^2)σT^4 = 2.25(4πR^2σT^4) = 2.25L_2. This shows that the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of 2.25. Therefore, the answer to the question is that the luminosity of Star_1 exceeds that of Star_2 by a factor of approximately 2.25.\n\n### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent g030:\nA\n\n### Sub-task 5: Select the correct factor from the given choices that matches the computed factor from stage 2. \n\n ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent 8Dif:\nTo determine the luminosity ratio of Star_1 to Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann Law, which states that luminosity (L) is proportional to the surface area (4πR^2) times the temperature to the fourth power (T^4).

Given that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2, we can denote the radius of Star_2 as R, making the radius of Star_1 1.5R.
