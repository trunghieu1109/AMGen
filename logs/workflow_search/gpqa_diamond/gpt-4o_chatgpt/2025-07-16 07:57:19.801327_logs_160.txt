This depends on the gas density, pressure, and temperature. When the electron beam is initiated, electrons interact with gas molecules, causing scattering events that affect the effective mean free path λ2 related to electron-gas molecule interactions. Since the temperature remains constant, the gas molecule velocities and densities remain unchanged, so λ1 remains constant. However, electrons have different scattering cross-sections with gas molecules compared to molecule-molecule collisions. Electrons, being much lighter and charged particles, interact electromagnetically with gas molecules, leading to a higher probability of scattering. This increased scattering probability means electrons will, on average, travel a shorter distance before scattering compared to gas molecules traveling before colliding with each other. Therefore, the mean free path λ2 for electrons scattering off gas molecules is less than the mean free path λ1 of gas molecules themselves.

When the electron beam is initiated, electrons interact with the gas molecules, causing scattering events that affect the effective mean free path λ2 related to electron-gas molecule interactions. Since the temperature remains constant, the gas molecule velocities do not change, but the presence of high-energy electrons introduces additional scattering mechanisms. These electron scattering events effectively reduce the mean free path for electrons because electrons collide with gas molecules more frequently than gas molecules collide with each other in the vacuum. Therefore, the mean free path λ2, which accounts for electron scattering, must be less than the original mean free path λ1 of gas molecules alone. This reasoning excludes the possibilities that λ2 equals λ1 or is greater than λ1. Hence, the relationship λ2 < λ1 is the most consistent conclusion given the physics of electron scattering in an ultra-high vacuum environment.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent AUZc:\nThe mean free path λ1 is defined as the average distance a gas molecule travels before colliding with another gas molecule under the given vacuum conditions (pressure < 10^-9 Torr, constant temperature). This mean free path depends on the gas density and temperature. When the electron beam is initiated, electrons scatter off gas molecules, which introduces a different type of scattering event. The mean free path λ2 in this context refers to the average distance an electron travels before scattering off a gas molecule. Since electrons are much smaller and lighter than gas molecules and have different interaction cross-sections, the scattering probability differs. Electron scattering cross-sections with gas molecules are generally higher than gas molecule collision cross-sections with each other under ultra-high vacuum conditions, because electrons can interact electromagnetically with gas molecules. Therefore, the mean free path for electrons (λ2) is typically shorter than the mean free path for gas molecules (λ1). Given that temperature remains constant, the gas molecule velocities and densities remain unchanged, so λ1 remains constant. The presence of the electron beam introduces additional scattering, effectively reducing the mean free path for electrons. Hence, λ2 < λ1. Other options suggesting λ2 equal or greater than λ1 are inconsistent with the physics of electron scattering in vacuum.

When the electron beam is initiated, electrons interact and scatter off the gas molecules. This electron scattering introduces additional collision events from the perspective of the electrons, effectively changing the mean free path related to electron scattering (λ2). Since the temperature remains constant, the velocity distribution of the gas molecules does not change, so the intrinsic mean free path λ1 of the gas molecules remains constant. However, from the viewpoint of electron scattering, the presence of gas molecules acts as scattering centers, and the mean free path λ2 for electrons traveling through the gas is influenced by the electron-gas molecule collision cross-section. Electron scattering typically results in a higher probability of interaction compared to molecule-molecule collisions because electrons are much lighter and have different interaction cross-sections.

This means electrons will, on average, travel a shorter distance before scattering than gas molecules do before colliding with each other. Therefore, the effective mean free path λ2 associated with electron scattering off gas molecules is less than λ1. The temperature remains constant, so gas molecule properties do not change, but electron scattering reduces the mean free path for electrons. Hence, λ2 < λ1. Other options suggesting λ2 equals or exceeds λ1 contradict the physical understanding of electron scattering in gases.
