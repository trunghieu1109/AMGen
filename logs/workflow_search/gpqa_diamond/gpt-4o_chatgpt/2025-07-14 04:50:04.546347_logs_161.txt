The denominator 4 - x^2 - y^2 suggests a constraint that defines a boundary, specifically a circle of radius 2 in the x-y plane (since 4 = 2^2).

The nature of the pseudosphere is that it has constant negative curvature, which typically leads to infinite area due to its hyperbolic nature. The area of a pseudosphere is generally considered to be infinite because as one approaches the boundary defined by the metric, the surface expands without bound. Thus, the relationship between the metric, the boundary constraint, and the nature of the pseudosphere leads to the conclusion that the area is indeed +∞, as this reflects the typical behavior of hyperbolic surfaces.

The metric is expressed as ds^{2}=\\frac{32}{\\left(4-x^{2}-y^{2}\\right)}\\left(dx^{2}+dy^{2}\\right), indicating that the area calculation is influenced by the denominator 4-x^{2}-y^{2}. This denominator suggests a limit or boundary, specifically a circle of radius 2 (x^2 + y^2 = 4). As we approach this boundary, the metric becomes singular, indicating that the area is unbounded. In differential geometry, it is known that the area of a pseudosphere is infinite due to its unbounded nature. The choices provided include one suggesting infinite area (+∞), which aligns with the properties of the pseudosphere. The other choices suggest finite areas, which do not correspond to the nature of the surface described by the metric.

The area of a pseudosphere is known to be infinite because it extends indefinitely in certain directions. Given the radius r=2, we can interpret this as defining a boundary in the x-y plane, specifically the circle described by x^2 + y^2 = 4. However, as we approach this boundary, the metric becomes singular due to the term 4 - x^2 - y^2 in the denominator. This singularity indicates that the area cannot be contained within a finite measure, leading to the conclusion that the area of the pseudosphere is indeed infinite.
