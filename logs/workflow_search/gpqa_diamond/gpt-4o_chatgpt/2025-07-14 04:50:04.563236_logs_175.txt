The given rows of operator P are: (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). This gives us the matrix P as follows:\n\nP = | 0          1/sqrt(2)  0        |\n    | 1/sqrt(2) 0          1/sqrt(2) |\n    | 0          1/sqrt(2)  0        |\n\nNext, we need to find the eigenvalues of this matrix. The eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic polynomial, which is obtained from the determinant of (P - λI) = 0, where I is the identity matrix and λ represents the eigenvalue.\n\nCalculating P - λI:\nP - λI = | -λ          1/sqrt(2)  0        |\n          | 1/sqrt(2) - λ  0          1/sqrt(2) |\n          | 0          1/sqrt(2)  -λ        |\n\nNow, we compute the determinant:\n\ndet(P - λI) = -λ[(1/sqrt(2))( -λ) - (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2))] - (1/sqrt(2))[(1/sqrt(2))(0) - (1/sqrt(2))(0)] + 0\n= -λ[-λ/sqrt(2) - 1/2]\n= λ^2/√2 + λ/2\n\nSetting this determinant to zero gives us the characteristic equation:\nλ^3 - (1/2)λ = 0\nFactoring out λ gives:\nλ(λ^2 - 1/2) = 0\nThis gives us one eigenvalue λ1 = 0 and the other two eigenvalues can be found by solving λ^2 - 1/2 = 0, which gives λ2 = ±1/√2.\n\nNow, we find the eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue. For λ1 = 0, we solve (P - 0I)v = 0, leading to the system of equations:\n1/sqrt(2)v2 + 1/sqrt(2)v3 = 0, etc. This will yield the eigenvector corresponding to λ1.\n\nFor λ2 = 1/√2, we solve (P - (1/√2)I)v = 0, and similarly for λ3 = -1/√2. Each of these will yield a corresponding eigenvector.\n\nIn summary, we have determined the eigenvalues of operator P to be 0, 1/√2, and -1/√2, and we can find the corresponding eigenvectors through the above process.

The given rows of operator P are: (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). This gives us the matrix P as follows:\n\nP = | 0          1/sqrt(2)  0        |\n    | 1/sqrt(2) 0          1/sqrt(2) |\n    | 0          1/sqrt(2)  0        |\n\nNext, we need to find the eigenvalues of this matrix. The eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic polynomial, which is obtained from the determinant of (P - λI) = 0, where I is the identity matrix and λ represents the eigenvalue.\n\nCalculating P - λI:\nP - λI = | -λ          1/sqrt(2)  0        |\n          | 1/sqrt(2) - λ  0          1/sqrt(2) |\n          | 0          1/sqrt(2)  -λ        |\n\nNow, we compute the determinant:\n\ndet(P - λI) = -λ[(1/sqrt(2))( -λ) - (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2))] - (1/sqrt(2))[(1/sqrt(2))(0) - (1/sqrt(2))(0)] + 0\n= -λ[-λ/sqrt(2) - 1/2]\n= λ^2/√2 + λ/2\n\nSetting this determinant to zero gives us the characteristic equation:\nλ^3 - (1/2)λ = 0\nFactoring out λ gives:\nλ(λ^2 - 1/2) = 0\nThis gives us one eigenvalue λ1 = 0 and the other two eigenvalues can be found by solving λ^2 - 1/2 = 0, which gives λ2 = ±1/√2.\n\nNow, we find the eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue. For λ1 = 0, we solve (P - 0I)v = 0, leading to the system of equations:\n1/sqrt(2)v2 + 1/sqrt(2)v3 = 0, etc. This will yield the eigenvector corresponding to λ1.\n\nFor λ2 = 1/√2, we solve (P - (1/√2)I)v = 0, and similarly for λ3 = -1/√2. Each of these will yield a corresponding eigenvector.\n\nIn summary, we have determined the eigenvalues of operator P to be 0, 1/√2, and -1/√2, and we can find the corresponding eigenvectors through the above process.

The corresponding eigenvector for the eigenvalue 0 needs to be calculated. Solving the equation (P - 0I)v = 0 leads us to the eigenvector associated with the eigenvalue 0. We can find this eigenvector by reducing the matrix formed by the rows of operator P. Once we have the eigenvector for the eigenvalue 0, we can normalize it and then calculate the projection of the initial state vector onto this eigenvector. The probability of measuring 0 for P is given by the square of the magnitude of this projection.

Assuming the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 is v0, the projection of the state vector |ψ⟩ onto |v0⟩ is given by: P(v0) = (⟨v0|ψ⟩ / ⟨v0|v0⟩) |v0⟩. The probability P(0) of measuring 0 for P is then P(0) = |⟨v0|ψ⟩|^2 / ⟨v0|v0⟩. We will compute this projection and the corresponding norm to find the probability.

The measurement of P yields the eigenvalue 0, which corresponds to the eigenvector associated with that eigenvalue. From the previous analysis, we found that the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 for operator P is (0, 1, 0). This means that after measuring P and obtaining the result 0, the state of the system collapses to this eigenvector. Next, we need to calculate the probability of measuring -1 for observable Q. The eigenvalue -1 corresponds to the eigenvector (0, 0, 1) for operator Q. The probability of measuring an eigenvalue is given by the square of the inner product of the current state vector and the eigenvector of the observable being measured. Therefore, we compute the inner product of the state vector (0, 1, 0) with the eigenvector (0, 0, 1), which results in 0.

The measurement of P yields the eigenvalue 0, which corresponds to the eigenvector associated with that eigenvalue. From the previous analysis, we found that the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 for operator P is (0, 1, 0). This means that after measuring P and obtaining the result 0, the state of the system collapses to this eigenvector. Next, we need to calculate the probability of measuring -1 for observable Q. The eigenvalue -1 corresponds to the eigenvector (0, 0, 1) for operator Q. The probability of measuring an eigenvalue is given by the square of the inner product of the current state vector and the eigenvector of the observable being measured. Therefore, we compute the inner product of the state vector (0, 1, 0) with the eigenvector (0, 0, 1), which results in 0. Since the inner product is 0, the probability of measuring -1 for Q is the square of this inner product, which is 0.
