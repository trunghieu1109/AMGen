S1 = +1, S2 = -1, S3 = +1: E = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J.\n4. S1 = +1, S2 = -1, S3 = -1: E = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = +J.\n5. S1 = -1, S2 = +1, S3 = +1: E = -J[(-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J.\n6. S1 = -1, S2 = +1, S3 = -1: E = -J[(-1)(+1) + (-1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = +J.\n7. S1 = -1, S2 = -1, S3 = +1: E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = +J.\n8. S1 = -1, S2 = -1, S3 = -1: E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -3J.\n\nFrom this, we see that there are two configurations with energy -3J, three configurations with energy -J, and three configurations with energy +J. The partition function Z is then calculated as Z = sum over configurations e^{-\\beta E}. Therefore, Z = 2e^{3J\\beta} + 3e^{J\\beta} + 3e^{-J\\beta}.

Each spin can be either +1 or -1, so there are 2^3 = 8 possible configurations of the spins (S1, S2, S3). For each configuration, we calculate the energy by substituting the values of the spins into the energy expression. The energy depends on the products S1S2, S1S3, and S2S3. If two spins are aligned (both +1 or both -1), their product is +1, and if they are anti-aligned (one +1, one -1), their product is -1. The energy is minimized when the spins are aligned, as this results in the most negative energy due to the negative sign in front of J. There are 4 configurations where all spins are aligned (either all +1 or all -1), which gives the lowest energy E = -3J. There are 4 configurations where one pair of spins is aligned and the other is anti-aligned, resulting in energy E = J. By calculating the energy for each configuration, we can see how the energy changes with different spin alignments.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent yEii:\nThe energy of the system is given by E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3].
