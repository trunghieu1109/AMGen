Instead it stayed at a purely abstract, template-style description of quantum measurement, which prevented it from producing or checking the correct numerical probability.', 'feedback': 'At subtask 3 and beyond, agents only described how one would in principle find eigenvalues and project onto eigenvectors, but they never actually applied those steps to the given 3×3 matrix P and the state (−1,2,1). As a result:\n  • No explicit eigenvector for λ=0 was computed (so subtask 4 had nothing concrete to project onto).\n  • The state vector was never normalized (its norm is √6) and the eigenvector wasn’t normalized either.\n  • The key inner product vᵀx and the division by ||x||² that yield the numerical probability were never evaluated.\n  • Agents simply picked option B) by matching abstract process text instead of verifying with numbers.\nTo fix this, the workflow must switch from abstract “debate” to a step-by-step numeric calculation, carrying forward the actual vectors and their normalizations.', 'suggestion': '1. Introduce an explicit subtask (Chain-of-Thought) to compute and normalize the state vector x = (−1,2,1), then to compute the null-space eigenvector v for P at λ=0 and normalize it. Pass these concrete vectors to the next step.\n2. Replace the Debate-style subtasks for subtasks 4 and 5 with a structured SC-CoT style that carries forward the computed v and x, explicitly computes the inner product vᵀx, squares it, divides by ||x||², and then matches that numeric result to the provided choices. This ensures every numeric step is performed and double-checked before selecting the final answer.'}}, {'verifier_name': 'gpt-4.1-mini', 'evaluation': {'failure_reason': "The previous reasoning process failed because it did not explicitly compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the observable matrix P, nor did it perform the actual projection and probability calculation with the given numerical data. Instead, it focused on describing the general methodology and selecting answers based on theoretical completeness without applying the concrete matrix and state vector provided. This led to a disconnect between the problem's numerical specifics and the abstract reasoning, causing the final answer to be incorrect.", 'feedback': 'The main error in the reasoning process lies in the lack of concrete numerical computation and verification. Although the agents correctly identified the need to find eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P, project the state vector onto the zero eigenvalue eigenspace, and compute the normalized squared norm for the probability, none of the subtasks actually performed these calculations with the given matrix and vector. Instead, the agents debated the general approach and chose options based on completeness of explanation rather than correctness of numerical results. This caused the final answer to be wrong because the problem requires explicit eigen-decomposition and projection with the provided data, not just a theoretical outline.\n\nSpecifically:\n- Subtask 1 and 2 focused on summarizing and analyzing relationships but did not verify or use the given matrix and vector.\n- Subtask 3 correctly described how to find eigenvalues and eigenvectors but did not compute them explicitly.\n- Subtask 4 discussed projection methods but did not apply them to the actual vector and eigenvectors.\n- Subtask 5 described the probability calculation formula but did not perform the calculation with the actual numbers.\n\nThe error originated from treating the problem as a conceptual question rather than a computational one. The agents failed to bridge the gap between theory and the concrete numerical problem, which is essential here.\n\nTo fix this, the workflow must require explicit calculation steps using the given matrix and vector at each stage, ensuring that eigenvalues, eigenvectors, projections, and probability are numerically evaluated and verified before selecting the final answer. Without this, the reasoning remains abstract and prone to error.\n\nContext-wise, the agents had sufficient information but did not utilize it effectively. The collaboration pattern (Debate and SC_CoT) was appropriate for conceptual discussion but insufficient for enforcing concrete calculations. The subtasks passed outputs as textual reasoning rather than numerical results, which hindered cumulative correctness.\n\nIn summary, the failure was due to insufficient numerical computation and verification in the reasoning process, leading to a mismatch between the problem requirements and the final answer.', 'suggestion': "1. Refine subtasks 3, 4, and 5 to explicitly require numerical computation steps: \n   - Subtask 3 should include calculating the characteristic polynomial of P, solving for eigenvalues, and explicitly finding eigenvectors with the given matrix.\n   - Subtask 4 should perform the actual projection of the given state vector onto the zero eigenvalue eigenvector(s), showing the numerical inner products and projected vector.\n   - Subtask 5 should compute the normalized squared norm of the projection to yield the exact probability value.\n\n2. Change the collaboration pattern for these subtasks from Debate or SC_CoT to a more structured stepwise CoT with enforced numerical calculation and verification at each step. This ensures that each subtask produces concrete numerical outputs that can be passed forward and checked, reducing abstract guesswork.\n\nThese improvements will ensure the reasoning process is grounded in the problem's numerical data, leading to a correct and verifiable final answer."}}]
