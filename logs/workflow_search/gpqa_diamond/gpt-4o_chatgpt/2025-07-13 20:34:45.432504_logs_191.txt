The inner surface of the cavity will acquire an induced charge of -q, which exactly cancels the electric field inside the conductor material, ensuring that the electric field within the conductor is zero.

This is because the conductor was initially uncharged, and the total charge of the system must remain zero. Therefore, the effective charge distribution is such that the outer surface of the conductor has a charge of +q. The electric field outside the conductor is then equivalent to that of a point charge +q located at the center of the conductor.

This is due to the spherical symmetry of the problem, which allows us to treat the outer charge distribution as if it were a point charge at the center. Therefore, the effective charge distribution on the surface of the spherical conductor is such that it appears as a point charge +q at the center of the conductor when viewed from outside. Consequently, the electric field at a point P outside the conductor is given by the expression E = (1/(4πϵ₀))(q/L²), where L is the distance from the center of the conductor to point P.

The inner surface of the cavity will acquire an induced charge of -q to ensure that the electric field within the conductor material itself is zero. This is because the electric field inside a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium must be zero. To maintain the overall neutrality of the conductor, the outer surface of the conductor will acquire a charge of +q. This is because the conductor was initially uncharged, and the total charge of the system must remain zero. The distribution of charge on the outer surface is such that it appears as if there is a point charge +q at the center of the conductor. This is due to the spherical symmetry of the problem, which allows us to treat the outer charge distribution as if it were a point charge at the center. Therefore, the effective charge distribution on the surface of the spherical conductor is such that it appears as a point charge +q at the center of the conductor when viewed from outside. Consequently, the electric field at a point P outside the conductor is given by the expression E = (1/(4πϵ₀))(q/L²), where L is the distance from the center of the conductor to point P.
