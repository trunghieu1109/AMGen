The excitation ratio between star_1 and star_2 is 2:1, and the energy difference between the levels is given. Assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the populations of energy levels follow the Boltzmann distribution. The ratio of populations at the excited level for the two stars can be expressed as n1/n2 = 2. Using the Boltzmann distribution, the population ratio for each star is proportional to exp(-ΔE / kT), where ΔE is the energy difference, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature. Therefore, the ratio n1/n2 = exp(-ΔE / kT1) / exp(-ΔE / kT2) = exp(ΔE / k (1/T2 - 1/T1)). Taking the natural logarithm gives ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1). Rearranging, ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (T1 - T2) / (T1 * T2). Since ΔE / k is a positive constant, the equation simplifies to ln(2) proportional to (T1 - T2) / (T1 * T2).

The ratio of populations n_1/n_2 = exp(-ΔE / kT), where ΔE is the energy difference, k is Boltzmann\'s constant, and T is the temperature. Given that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2 for the same energy level, we can write: n_1 / n_2 = 2. Using the Boltzmann distribution for each star, n_1 ∝ exp(-E / kT_1) and n_2 ∝ exp(-E / kT_2), the ratio of populations at that level is n_1 / n_2 = exp(-E / kT_1) / exp(-E / kT_2) = exp(E / k (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)). Setting this equal to 2, we have: ln(2) = E / k (1/T_2 - 1/T_1). Rearranging, ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1). This can be rewritten as ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2). Since ΔE and k are constants, the form ln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) matches the structure of the correct equation relating T_1 and T_2. Among the choices, only choice 4 matches this form, ln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2). The other options do not correctly represent the relationship derived from the Boltzmann distribution.

Given that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2, we can write the ratio of populations as n1 / n2 = 2. Using the Boltzmann distribution for each star, n1 ∝ exp(-ΔE / kT1) and n2 ∝ exp(-ΔE / kT2). Therefore, 2 = exp(-ΔE / kT1) / exp(-ΔE / kT2) = exp(ΔE / k (1/T2 - 1/T1)). Taking natural logarithm on both sides gives ln(2) = ΔE / k (1/T2 - 1/T1). Rearranging, ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (T1 - T2) / (T1 * T2). Since ΔE / k is a positive constant, the relationship reduces to ln(2) proportional to (T1 - T2) / (T1 * T2).

The ratio of populations n_1/n_2 = exp(-ΔE / kT), where ΔE is the energy difference, k is Boltzmann\'s constant, and T is the temperature. Given that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2 for the same energy level, we can write: n_1 / n_2 = 2. Using the Boltzmann distribution for each star, n_1 ∝ exp(-E / kT_1) and n_2 ∝ exp(-E / kT_2), the ratio of populations at that level is n_1 / n_2 = exp(-E / kT_1) / exp(-E / kT_2) = exp(E / k (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)). Setting this equal to 2, we have: ln(2) = E / k (1/T_2 - 1/T_1). Rearranging, ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1). This can be rewritten as ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2).

The ratio of the populations at the excited level is given by n1/n2 = 2. According to the Boltzmann distribution, the population of an energy level is proportional to exp(-ΔE / kT), where ΔE is the energy difference between the levels, k is Boltzmann\'s constant, and T is the temperature. Therefore, the ratio of populations can be expressed as n1/n2 = exp(-ΔE / kT1) / exp(-ΔE / kT2) = exp(ΔE / k (1/T2 - 1/T1)). Taking the natural logarithm of both sides gives ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1). Rearranging this, we get ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (T1 - T2) / (T1 * T2). Since ΔE / k is a positive constant, the equation simplifies to ln(2) proportional to (T1 - T2) / (T1 * T2). Among the given options, only choice 4 matches this form exactly: ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 * T2). The other options either have incorrect forms or incorrect powers in the denominator.
