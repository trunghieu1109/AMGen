Magnon: Magnons are collective spin excitations in a magnetically ordered system. The magnetic ordering breaks the spin rotational symmetry spontaneously, and magnons are the Goldstone bosons associated with this broken symmetry. Hence, magnons are directly linked to spontaneously-broken spin rotational symmetry.\n\n2. Skyrmion: Skyrmions are topological solitons in magnetic systems characterized by a nontrivial spin texture. Their existence is tied to the topology of the order parameter space, which itself arises due to spontaneous symmetry breaking (e.g., breaking of continuous spin rotational symmetry). Therefore, skyrmions are also associated with spontaneously-broken symmetries.\n\n3. Pion: In particle physics, pions emerge as pseudo-Goldstone bosons from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). This spontaneous symmetry breaking is a fundamental aspect of low-energy QCD, making pions directly associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry.\n\n4. Phonon: Phonons represent quantized lattice vibrations in a crystal. These vibrational modes arise from the discrete translational symmetry of the lattice but are not a result of spontaneous symmetry breaking. Instead, phonons are normal modes of vibration and exist even without any spontaneous symmetry breaking. Thus, phonons are not associated with spontaneously-broken symmetries.\n\nConsidering all these cases, magnons, skyrmions, and pions are connected to spontaneously-broken symmetries, while phonons are not. This analysis justifies that the particle not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry is the phonon.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent O95s:\nTo analyze the relationship between each particle and spontaneously-broken symmetries, we consider the nature of each particle and the symmetry involved:\n\n1. Magnon: Magnons are quasiparticles representing collective spin-wave excitations in a magnetically ordered system. The magnetic order arises due to the spontaneous breaking of spin rotational symmetry. Thus, magnons are directly associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry.\n\n2. Skyrmion: Skyrmions are topological solitons characterized by a nontrivial spin texture in magnetic systems. Their existence is tied to the underlying broken symmetries in the magnetic medium, often involving broken spin rotational symmetry and topological considerations. Hence, skyrmions are related to spontaneously-broken symmetries.\n\n3. Pion: Pions are pseudo-Goldstone bosons resulting from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Their low mass and properties directly stem from this broken symmetry, making them a classic example of particles associated with spontaneously-broken symmetries.\n\n4. Phonon: Phonons represent quantized lattice vibrations in a crystalline solid. They arise due to the periodic arrangement of atoms and are excitations of the normal vibrational modes of the lattice. The lattice itself breaks continuous translational symmetry down to discrete translational symmetry, but this is a discrete symmetry breaking, not a spontaneous continuous symmetry breaking that gives rise to Goldstone bosons. Therefore, phonons are not fundamentally associated with spontaneously-broken continuous symmetries in the same way as the other particles.\n\nConsidering all cases, magnons, skyrmions, and pions are linked to spontaneously-broken symmetries, while phonons are not. Thus, the particle not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry is the phonon.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent BNoO:\nMagnons arise from the spontaneous breaking of spin rotational symmetry in magnetically ordered systems. When the spin rotational symmetry is spontaneously broken, magnons appear as the Goldstone bosons corresponding to the broken continuous symmetry. Skyrmions are topological solitons in magnetic systems and their existence is often tied to complex symmetry-breaking patterns in the spin texture; they represent nontrivial topological configurations that emerge due to broken symmetries in the system. Pions are pseudo-Goldstone bosons resulting from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics (QCD); the appearance of pions is a direct consequence of this broken symmetry.

Magnon: A magnon is a quasiparticle representing a collective excitation of electron spins in a lattice, specifically spin waves. It arises in magnetic materials and is associated with the spontaneous breaking of spin rotational symmetry. This means that in a magnetically ordered state, the symmetry of spin directions is broken, and magnons are the quantized excitations of this broken symmetry.\n\n2. Skyrmion: A skyrmion is a topological soliton, a stable, particle-like configuration in a field theory, often appearing in magnetic systems. Skyrmions are related to nontrivial topological properties of the spin configuration and can be associated with broken symmetries in magnetic materials. They represent a localized twisting of spins and are important in condensed matter physics.\n\n3. Pion: Pions are mesons that mediate the strong nuclear force between nucleons. They are understood as (pseudo-)Goldstone bosons arising from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry leads to the appearance of pions as low-energy excitations.\n\n4. Phonon: A phonon is a quasiparticle representing quantized lattice vibrations in a crystal. Phonons arise from the collective oscillations of atoms in a lattice and are fundamental to understanding thermal and vibrational properties of solids. Unlike magnons or pions, phonons are not directly associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry; rather, they are related to the normal modes of vibration of the lattice.\n\nIn summary, magnons, skyrmions, and pions are linked to spontaneously broken symmetries (spin rotational symmetry, topological symmetry in magnetic systems, and chiral symmetry, respectively), while phonons are not. This distinction is crucial for understanding their roles in physics.\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent kMQK:\nD)\n\n### Sub-task 2: Analyze the relationships between each particle and spontaneously-broken symmetries, identifying which are associated with such symmetries. \n\n ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent G8SS:\nTo analyze the relationship between each particle and spontaneously-broken symmetries, we consider the physical origin and theoretical context of each particle:\n\n1. Magnon: Magnons are collective spin excitations in a magnetically ordered system. The magnetic ordering breaks the spin rotational symmetry spontaneously, and magnons are the Goldstone bosons associated with this broken symmetry. Hence, magnons are directly linked to spontaneously-broken spin rotational symmetry.\n\n2. Skyrmion: Skyrmions are topological solitons in magnetic systems characterized by a nontrivial spin texture. Their existence is tied to the topology of the order parameter space, which itself arises due to spontaneous symmetry breaking (e.g., breaking of continuous spin rotational symmetry). Therefore, skyrmions are also associated with spontaneously-broken symmetries.\n\n3. Pion: In particle physics, pions emerge as pseudo-Goldstone bosons from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). This spontaneous symmetry breaking is a fundamental aspect of low-energy QCD, making pions directly associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry.\n\n4. Phonon: Phonons represent quantized lattice vibrations in a crystal. These vibrational modes arise from the discrete translational symmetry of the lattice but are not a result of spontaneous symmetry breaking. Instead, phonons are normal modes of vibration and exist even without any spontaneous symmetry breaking. Thus, phonons are not associated with spontaneously-broken symmetries.\n\nConsidering all these cases, magnons, skyrmions, and pions are connected to spontaneously-broken symmetries, while phonons are not. This analysis justifies that the particle not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry is the phonon.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent O95s:\nTo analyze the relationship between each particle and spontaneously-broken symmetries, we consider the nature of each particle and the symmetry involved:\n\n1. Magnon: Magnons are quasiparticles representing collective spin-wave excitations in a magnetically ordered system. The magnetic order arises due to the spontaneous breaking of spin rotational symmetry. Thus, magnons are directly associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry.\n\n2. Skyrmion: Skyrmions are topological solitons characterized by a nontrivial spin texture in magnetic systems. Their existence is tied to the underlying broken symmetries in the magnetic medium, often involving broken spin rotational symmetry and topological considerations. Hence, skyrmions are related to spontaneously-broken symmetries.\n\n3. Pion: Pions are pseudo-Goldstone bosons resulting from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Their low mass and properties directly stem from this broken symmetry, making them a classic example of particles associated with spontaneously-broken symmetries.\n\n4. Phonon: Phonons represent quantized lattice vibrations in a crystalline solid. They arise due to the periodic arrangement of atoms and are excitations of the normal vibrational modes of the lattice. The lattice itself breaks continuous translational symmetry down to discrete translational symmetry, but this is a discrete symmetry breaking, not a spontaneous continuous symmetry breaking that gives rise to Goldstone bosons. Therefore, phonons are not fundamentally associated with spontaneously-broken continuous symmetries in the same way as the other particles.\n\nConsidering all cases, magnons, skyrmions, and pions are linked to spontaneously-broken symmetries, while phonons are not. Thus, the particle not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry is the phonon.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent BNoO:\nMagnons arise from the spontaneous breaking of spin rotational symmetry in magnetically ordered systems. When the spin rotational symmetry is spontaneously broken, magnons appear as the Goldstone bosons corresponding to the broken continuous symmetry. Skyrmions are topological solitons in magnetic systems and their existence is often tied to complex symmetry-breaking patterns in the spin texture; they represent nontrivial topological configurations that emerge due to broken symmetries in the system. Pions are pseudo-Goldstone bosons resulting from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics (QCD); the appearance of pions is a direct consequence of this broken symmetry.

Their existence depends on the nontrivial topology of the order parameter space, which itself arises from spontaneous symmetry breaking (commonly spin rotational symmetry). Thus, skyrmions are linked to spontaneously-broken symmetries.\n\n3. Pion: Pions are pseudo-Goldstone bosons arising from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). This is a fundamental example of spontaneous symmetry breaking in particle physics.\n\n4. Phonon: Phonons represent quantized lattice vibrations. They arise due to the discrete translational symmetry of the crystal lattice and correspond to normal modes of vibration. Importantly, phonons do not result from spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry; the lattice structure is imposed externally and does not emerge from spontaneous symmetry breaking.\n\nConsidering these points, magnons, skyrmions, and pions are all associated with spontaneously-broken symmetries, whereas phonons are not. This conclusion holds generally across condensed matter and particle physics contexts. Hence, the particle not associated with spontaneously-broken symmetry is the phonon.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent fUCm:\nTo determine which particle is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry, we analyze each candidate carefully:\n\n1. Magnon: Magnons are quasiparticles that represent collective spin wave excitations in magnetically ordered materials. The magnetic order arises because of spontaneous breaking of continuous spin rotational symmetry. Magnons are Goldstone bosons resulting from this broken symmetry, so they are directly associated with spontaneously-broken symmetry.\n\n2. Skyrmion: Skyrmions are topological solitons characterized by nontrivial spin textures in magnetic systems. Their existence depends on the topology of the order parameter space, which itself arises due to spontaneous symmetry breaking (e.g., spin rotational symmetry). Hence, skyrmions are also linked to spontaneously-broken symmetries.\n\n3. Pion: In particle physics, pions emerge as pseudo-Goldstone bosons from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). This is a classic and well-established example of spontaneous symmetry breaking, making pions associated with such symmetry breaking.\n\n4. Phonon: Phonons represent quantized lattice vibrations in a crystal. They arise due to the discrete translational symmetry of the lattice, but this symmetry is not spontaneously broken. Instead, phonons correspond to collective excitations of the lattice normal modes and exist regardless of symmetry breaking. Therefore, phonons are not associated with spontaneously-broken symmetry.\n\nConsidering all these points, the only particle among the four that is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry is the phonon.

[{'verifier_name': 'o4-mini', 'evaluation': {'failure_reason': 'All agents concluded that phonons are not tied to a spontaneously broken symmetry, but this ignored the fact that a crystal lattice itself arises by spontaneously breaking continuous translational symmetry. Phonons are the Nambu–Goldstone modes of that broken symmetry.', 'feedback': 'The mistaken assumption appeared in subtask 2 and 3 during the analysis of phonons. Agents treated the lattice as if its discrete translational symmetry were fundamental and explicit, dismissing any spontaneous breaking. In reality, when a continuous medium crystallizes, it spontaneously breaks continuous translation symmetry down to a discrete subgroup, and phonons are precisely the corresponding Goldstone bosons. By not checking this subtlety, the reasoning for rejecting phonons was wrong and led to the incorrect final answer.', 'suggestion': "Introduce an explicit 'definition‐check' subtask after the initial feature extraction: have one agent verify for each candidate whether its origin really involves spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry (including translational symmetry for crystals). Use a Reflexion or Sharded‐Critic step to force‐check key assumptions (e.g. “Does phonon correspond to a Goldstone mode of any broken symmetry?”). This will catch subtle cases like phonons and prevent repeating this oversight."}}, {'verifier_name': 'gpt-4.1-mini', 'evaluation': {'failure_reason': 'The reasoning process failed because it incorrectly concluded that phonons are not associated with spontaneously-broken symmetries, overlooking the subtle but crucial fact that phonons are indeed Goldstone bosons arising from the spontaneous breaking of continuous translational symmetry in crystals. The error lies in misunderstanding the nature of the symmetry broken and the origin of phonons.', 'feedback': "The main flaw in the reasoning is the assumption that phonons arise solely from discrete translational symmetry of the lattice, which is an explicit symmetry of the crystal structure, and thus are not linked to spontaneous symmetry breaking. This is incorrect. In fact, the formation of a crystal lattice spontaneously breaks the continuous translational symmetry of free space down to a discrete subgroup. This spontaneous breaking of continuous translational symmetry gives rise to phonons as Goldstone bosons. The agents correctly identified magnons, skyrmions, and pions as associated with spontaneously-broken symmetries, but failed to apply the same logic to phonons. The error is conceptual and occurs during the analysis of phonons' relationship to symmetry breaking, particularly in subtasks 1 and 2 where the properties and relationships were summarized and analyzed. The context provided was sufficient but the interpretation was flawed. The agents did not sufficiently clarify or challenge the assumption that phonons are unrelated to spontaneous symmetry breaking, leading to a consensus on an incorrect final answer. This conceptual oversight is the root cause of the failure. The agents' collaboration pattern (CoT followed by SC_CoT and Debate) was effective in aggregating reasoning but did not include a critical reflection or expert check step that might have caught this subtlety. The instructions and context were adequate but lacked emphasis on the subtlety of continuous vs discrete symmetry breaking in the case of phonons, which is a common source of confusion.", 'suggestion': 'To improve the workflow and avoid such conceptual errors, introduce a dedicated subtask focused on explicitly distinguishing between explicit and spontaneous symmetry breaking, especially for borderline cases like phonons. This subtask should require agents to critically evaluate the nature of the symmetry broken (continuous vs discrete) and the origin of each particle as a Goldstone boson or not. Additionally, incorporate a Reflexion or Expert Review collaboration pattern after the initial CoT and SC_CoT steps to challenge assumptions and verify subtle conceptual points. This would help catch misunderstandings about phonons and similar cases. Finally, enhance the instructions to explicitly prompt agents to consider the spontaneous breaking of continuous translational symmetry in crystals and its relation to phonons, ensuring that this subtlety is not overlooked.'}}]

This is a classic example of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of a continuous symmetry.\n\n2. Skyrmion: Skyrmions are topological solitons that appear in systems with broken symmetries, often magnetic materials with chiral interactions. The formation of skyrmions is linked to the spontaneous breaking of certain symmetries, such as spin rotational symmetry and sometimes inversion symmetry, depending on the system. They represent stable topological configurations emerging from SSB.\n\n3. Pion: Pions are pseudo-Goldstone bosons resulting from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry (a continuous symmetry) in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The approximate chiral symmetry of the QCD Lagrangian is spontaneously broken by the QCD vacuum, giving rise to pions as low-energy excitations. This is a well-established case of spontaneous symmetry breaking.\n\n4. Phonon: Phonons represent quantized lattice vibrations. The crystal lattice breaks continuous translational symmetry explicitly down to a discrete subgroup due to the periodic arrangement of atoms. This breaking is not spontaneous but explicit because the lattice structure is imposed by the atomic positions. Phonons correspond to normal modes of vibration around this fixed lattice and are not Goldstone bosons of spontaneously broken continuous symmetries. Although the lattice breaks continuous translational symmetry, this is a structural, explicit breaking, not spontaneous.\n\nTherefore, magnons, skyrmions, and pions are associated with spontaneously-broken continuous symmetries, while phonons arise from explicit breaking of continuous translational symmetry to a discrete subgroup and are not associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking.

Using insights from previous attempts, try to solve the task better. \n\n ### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent QGR5:\nTo verify the nature of symmetry breaking for each particle, we analyze their origins and the types of symmetries involved:\n\n1. Magnon: Magnons arise from the spontaneous breaking of continuous spin rotational symmetry in a magnetically ordered system. The ground state of a ferromagnet or antiferromagnet breaks the SU(2) spin symmetry spontaneously, leading to gapless Goldstone modes identified as magnons. This is a classic example of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of a continuous symmetry.\n\n2. Skyrmion: Skyrmions are topological solitons that appear in systems with broken symmetries, often magnetic materials with chiral interactions. The formation of skyrmions is linked to the spontaneous breaking of certain symmetries, such as spin rotational symmetry and sometimes inversion symmetry, depending on the system. They represent stable topological configurations emerging from SSB.\n\n3. Pion: Pions are pseudo-Goldstone bosons resulting from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry (a continuous symmetry) in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The approximate chiral symmetry of the QCD Lagrangian is spontaneously broken by the QCD vacuum, giving rise to pions as low-energy excitations. This is a well-established case of spontaneous symmetry breaking.\n\n4. Phonon: Phonons represent quantized lattice vibrations. The crystal lattice breaks continuous translational symmetry explicitly down to a discrete subgroup due to the periodic arrangement of atoms. This breaking is not spontaneous but explicit because the lattice structure is imposed by the atomic positions. Phonons correspond to normal modes of vibration around this fixed lattice and are not Goldstone bosons of spontaneously broken continuous symmetries. Although the lattice breaks continuous translational symmetry, this is a structural, explicit breaking, not spontaneous.\n\nTherefore, magnons, skyrmions, and pions are associated with spontaneously-broken continuous symmetries, while phonons arise from explicit breaking of continuous translational symmetry to a discrete subgroup and are not associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking. This distinction is crucial and confirms that phonons are the particle type not associated with spontaneously-broken symmetry.\n\nHence, the correct answer is D).\n\n### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent QGR5:\nD)\n\n### Sub-task 3: Analyze the relationships between each particle and spontaneously-broken symmetries, identifying which are associated with such symmetries. Ensure to incorporate the verification results from subtask 2. \n\n ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent TYJ8:\nAnalyzing each particle in the context of spontaneously-broken symmetries: \n\n1. Magnon: Magnons arise as collective excitations in magnetically ordered systems where continuous spin rotational symmetry (SU(2)) is spontaneously broken. The ordered magnetic ground state selects a preferred direction, breaking the symmetry spontaneously and leading to gapless Goldstone bosons identified as magnons. Thus, magnons are directly associated with spontaneously-broken continuous symmetry.\n\n2. Skyrmion: Skyrmions are topological solitons appearing in certain magnetic materials. Their formation is intrinsically linked to the spontaneous breaking of symmetries, such as spin rotational symmetry and sometimes inversion symmetry, depending on the system. Skyrmions represent stable, topologically protected configurations that emerge due to spontaneous symmetry breaking, making them associated with such broken symmetries.\n\n3. Pion: Pions are pseudo-Goldstone bosons resulting from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry (a continuous symmetry) in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The QCD vacuum spontaneously breaks approximate chiral symmetry, and pions emerge as low-energy excitations due to this breaking. Hence, pions are fundamentally connected to spontaneously-broken symmetry.\n\n4. Phonon: Phonons represent quantized lattice vibrations. While the crystal lattice breaks continuous translational symmetry down to a discrete subgroup, this breaking is explicit and structural, not spontaneous. Phonons correspond to normal modes of vibration around the fixed lattice structure and are not Goldstone bosons arising from spontaneous symmetry breaking. Therefore, phonons are not associated with spontaneously-broken symmetries.\n\nIn conclusion, magnons, skyrmions, and pions are all linked to spontaneously-broken continuous symmetries, whereas phonons arise from explicit symmetry breaking related to the lattice structure. Hence, phonons are the particle type not associated with spontaneously-broken symmetry.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent 7FCg:\nAnalyzing each particle in the context of spontaneously-broken symmetries: 1. Magnon: Magnons are quasiparticles arising from collective spin wave excitations in magnetic systems. Their existence is fundamentally tied to the spontaneous breaking of continuous spin rotational symmetry (SU(2)) in a magnetically ordered phase. This breaking leads to Goldstone modes, which are the magnons themselves. Thus, magnons are directly associated with spontaneously-broken symmetry. 2. Skyrmion: Skyrmions are topological solitons appearing in certain magnetic materials. Their formation is linked to spontaneous breaking of symmetries such as spin rotational symmetry and sometimes inversion symmetry. Skyrmions represent stable topological configurations resulting from such spontaneous symmetry breaking, hence they are associated with spontaneously-broken symmetries. 3. Pion: Pions are mesons that emerge as pseudo-Goldstone bosons due to the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The QCD vacuum spontaneously breaks approximate chiral symmetry, giving rise to pions as low-energy excitations. This is a classic example of spontaneous symmetry breaking in particle physics. 4. Phonon: Phonons are quasiparticles corresponding to quantized lattice vibrations. The crystal lattice structure explicitly breaks continuous translational symmetry down to a discrete subgroup due to its periodic atomic arrangement. This breaking is explicit and structural, not spontaneous. Phonons reflect normal modes of vibration around this fixed lattice and are not Goldstone bosons arising from spontaneously-broken continuous symmetries. Therefore, phonons are not associated with spontaneously-broken symmetry. In summary, magnons, skyrmions, and pions are connected to spontaneously-broken symmetries, while phonons are not. This conclusion is consistent with the physical origins and symmetry considerations of each particle type.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent KtQS:\nMagnons arise as collective excitations due to the spontaneous breaking of continuous spin rotational symmetry in magnetically ordered materials, making them directly linked to spontaneously-broken symmetries.

Magnons, skyrmions, and pions all directly relate to spontaneous symmetry breaking.\n\nConsidering all physical contexts and the nature of each particle, the correct answer is that phonons are not associated with spontaneously-broken symmetry.\n\n### answer #1 by Debate Agent zztk:\nD)\n\n### answer #1 by Debate Agent ZhMj:\nD)\n\n### answer #1 by Debate Agent 1ohb:\nD)\n\n### answer #1 by Debate Agent 4Wt1:\nD)\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Final evaluation of particlesGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer. \n\n then justify completely and detailedly, step-by-step why you think so in the "thinking" entry. \n                Consider all cases that are possible to happen.\n                Avoid some unclear explainations, such as "Using the circle equation or the condition for four points to be concyclic, we derive an equation in x.
