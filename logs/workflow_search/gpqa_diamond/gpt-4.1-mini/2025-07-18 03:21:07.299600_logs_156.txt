============== Task detailed analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- The problem context is an outbreak of a viral infectious disease caused by a retrovirus in a city.
- The goal involves designing a molecular diagnostic kit for quick detection.
- Four choices are provided, each describing a sequence of steps:
  * Choice 1: Identify virus by DNA sequencing, then develop a PCR kit.
  * Choice 2: Identify IgG antibodies, then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG antibodies.
  * Choice 3: Identify virus using symptom information from patients, then design a nested PCR kit.
  * Choice 4: Identify virus by cDNA sequencing, then develop a real-time PCR kit.
- Key entities include the virus, viral genetic material (DNA or cDNA), antibodies (IgG), diagnostic methods (PCR, nested PCR, real-time PCR, ELISA).

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- Identification methods vary: direct genetic sequencing (DNA or cDNA), antibody detection, or symptom-based inference.
- Diagnostic kits correspond to identification methods: PCR-based kits rely on nucleic acid detection; ELISA targets antibodies.
- Constraints implied include the need for quick and accurate diagnosis.
- The choice of sequencing (DNA vs. cDNA) relates to the retrovirus nature (RNA virus requiring reverse transcription).
- Symptom-based identification is indirect and may affect specificity.
- The nested PCR and real-time PCR represent different PCR techniques with varying sensitivity and speed.
- These components influence the diagnostic approach's reliability, speed, and specificity.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem lies primarily in molecular biology and biotechnology.
- Subfields include virology, immunology, molecular diagnostics, and genetic sequencing.
- Techniques mentioned relate to nucleic acid amplification (PCR variants) and immunoassays (ELISA).
- Applications include infectious disease diagnostics, public health response, and biomedical research.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The problem does not specify the viral genome type explicitly (DNA or RNA), which affects sequencing choice.
- The reliability and availability of symptom data for virus identification are unclear.
- The timing and stage of infection relevant to antibody presence (IgG) are not detailed.
- The problem does not clarify resource constraints or required sensitivity/specificity levels.
- Potential challenges include choosing the most appropriate molecular target and diagnostic method given the retrovirus nature and outbreak urgency.
