[{'objective': 'Calculate the orbital radius and inclination constraints for the first planet based on its transit impact parameter and orbital period.'}, {'objective': 'Determine the geometric conditions required for the second planet to exhibit both transit and occultation events given its radius and shared orbital plane.'}, {'objective': 'Derive the maximum orbital radius and corresponding inclination range for the second planet that satisfy the transit and occultation geometry constraints.'}, {'objective': "Use Kepler's third law to convert the maximum orbital radius into the maximum orbital period and compare it with the given choices."}]
