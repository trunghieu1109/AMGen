[{'objective': 'Identify and characterize the retrovirus by sequencing its genetic material'}, {'objective': 'Select a specific molecular target (e.g., viral DNA, RNA, or cDNA) suitable for detection'}, {'objective': 'Develop a molecular detection assay such as PCR or real-time PCR based on the selected target'}, {'objective': 'Validate the diagnostic kit for sensitivity, specificity, and rapid detection capability'}]
============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- The problem context is an outbreak of a viral infectious disease caused by a retrovirus.
- The goal is to design a molecular diagnostic kit for quick detection.
- Four choices are given, each describing a different approach:
  * Choice 1: Identify virus by DNA sequencing, then develop a PCR kit.
  * Choice 2: Identify IgG antibodies, then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG.
  * Choice 3: Identify virus using symptom information, then design a nested PCR kit.
  * Choice 4: Identify virus by cDNA sequencing, then develop a real-time PCR kit.
- Key biological entities: virus (retrovirus), viral DNA or cDNA, IgG antibodies.
- Techniques mentioned: DNA sequencing, cDNA sequencing, PCR, nested PCR, real-time PCR, ELISA.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- Identification methods vary: direct viral genetic material sequencing (DNA or cDNA), antibody detection, or symptom-based inference.
- Diagnostic methods depend on identification: PCR-based kits rely on viral genetic sequences; ELISA targets host immune response (IgG antibodies).
- Constraints include speed and accuracy of diagnosis.
- The choice of sequencing (DNA vs cDNA) relates to the retrovirus lifecycle (RNA genome reverse transcribed to cDNA).
- Nested PCR and real-time PCR are advanced PCR techniques enhancing sensitivity and quantification.
- Symptom-based identification is indirect and may affect specificity.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- Primary domain: Molecular biology and biotechnology.
- Subfields: Virology, diagnostic assay development, molecular diagnostics.
- Techniques involve genetics (sequencing), immunology (antibody detection), and molecular techniques (PCR variants).
- Applications: Clinical diagnostics, epidemiology, public health response, biomedical research.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The problem does not specify whether the viral genome is RNA or DNA, though retroviruses typically have RNA genomes.
- The reliability of symptom-based identification is ambiguous.
- The choice between DNA and cDNA sequencing needs clarification given retrovirus biology.
- The problem does not specify the stage of infection or immune response timing, which affects antibody detection.
- No information on resource availability, time constraints, or required sensitivity/specificity is provided.
- Potential challenges include differentiating between active infection and past exposure (especially for antibody tests), and the technical complexity of nested or real-time PCR.
