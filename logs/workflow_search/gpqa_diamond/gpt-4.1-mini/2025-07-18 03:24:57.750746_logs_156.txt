============== Task detailed analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- The problem context is an outbreak of a viral infectious disease caused by a retrovirus in a city.
- The task involves designing a molecular diagnostic kit for quick detection.
- Four choices describe different approaches involving identification methods and diagnostic techniques:
  * Choice 1: Identify virus by DNA sequencing, then develop a PCR kit.
  * Choice 2: Identify IgG antibodies, then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG.
  * Choice 3: Identify virus using symptom information, then design a nested PCR kit.
  * Choice 4: Identify virus by cDNA sequencing, then develop a real-time PCR kit.
- Key entities: virus (retrovirus), diagnostic methods (DNA sequencing, cDNA sequencing, PCR, nested PCR, real-time PCR, ELISA), antibodies (IgG), symptom-based identification.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- Identification methods vary: direct viral genetic material sequencing (DNA or cDNA), antibody detection, or symptom-based inference.
- Diagnostic techniques depend on identification: PCR-based methods target viral nucleic acids; ELISA targets host antibodies.
- Constraints include speed and accuracy of diagnosis.
- The choice of sequencing (DNA vs cDNA) relates to the retrovirus biology (RNA genome requiring reverse transcription).
- Symptom-based identification is indirect and may affect specificity.
- Nested PCR and real-time PCR are advanced PCR techniques enhancing sensitivity and quantification.
- The relationships suggest a pipeline: identification method informs the design of the diagnostic assay.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- Relevant domains: Molecular biology, virology, biotechnology.
- Subfields: Diagnostic assay development, nucleic acid amplification techniques, immunoassays.
- Applications: Clinical diagnostics, infectious disease control, public health.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- Ambiguity in the term "identify the virus using information about symptoms"â€”symptoms alone may not be definitive.
- The choice between DNA and cDNA sequencing for a retrovirus (which has RNA genome) needs clarification.
- The problem does not specify the stage of infection or sample type, which influence antibody presence and nucleic acid detection.
- Potential challenges include differentiating between active infection and past exposure (especially for antibody detection), and the technical feasibility of each method in the outbreak context.
- No explicit constraints on resources, time, or available technology are given, which affect method selection.
