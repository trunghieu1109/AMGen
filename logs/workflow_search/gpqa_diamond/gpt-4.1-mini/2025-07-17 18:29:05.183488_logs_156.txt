============== Task detailed analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- The problem context is an outbreak of a viral infectious disease caused by a retrovirus in a city.
- The goal is to design a molecular diagnostic kit for quick detection.
- Four choices describe different approaches involving identification methods and diagnostic techniques:
  * Choice 1: Identify virus by DNA sequencing, then develop a PCR kit.
  * Choice 2: Identify IgG antibodies, then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG.
  * Choice 3: Identify virus using symptom information, then design a nested PCR kit.
  * Choice 4: Identify virus by cDNA sequencing, then develop a real-time PCR kit.
- Key entities: virus (retrovirus), DNA sequencing, cDNA sequencing, PCR, nested PCR, real-time PCR, IgG antibodies, ELISA.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- Identification methods (DNA sequencing, cDNA sequencing, symptom-based identification, antibody detection) serve as initial steps to characterize the virus or immune response.
- Diagnostic techniques (PCR variants, ELISA) depend on the identification step and target either viral genetic material or host antibodies.
- Constraints include speed and accuracy of diagnosis, implying the need for sensitive and specific detection methods.
- The choice of molecular target (viral genome vs. antibodies) influences the type of diagnostic kit developed.
- The relationship between sequencing and PCR design is critical, as sequencing informs primer design for PCR.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- Primary domain: Molecular biology and biotechnology.
- Subfields: Virology, diagnostic assay development, molecular diagnostics.
- Techniques involved: DNA/cDNA sequencing, PCR (polymerase chain reaction), ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay).
- Applications: Clinical diagnostics, infectious disease control, epidemiology.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The problem does not specify the stage of infection or whether viral RNA or DNA is the primary target, which affects choice between DNA and cDNA sequencing.
- The reliability of symptom-based identification is ambiguous and may lack specificity.
- The timing and nature of antibody response (IgG) relative to infection onset is not detailed, which impacts ELISA applicability.
- The problem does not clarify resource availability or constraints that might influence method selection.
- Potential challenges include differentiating between active infection and past exposure (especially for antibody detection), and ensuring rapid turnaround time.
