============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- The aperture is shaped as an N-sided polygon with all apothems equal to length a.
- Monochromatic light of wavelength \( \lambda \) is incident vertically along the z-axis.
- The far-field diffraction pattern exhibits intensity maxima and minima.
- The problem focuses on the angular distance between the first two minima in the diffraction pattern.
- The limit considered is \( N \to \infty \), implying the polygon approaches a circle.
- Small-angle approximation is valid: \( \tan \theta \approx \theta \).

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The polygonal aperture with equal apothems defines a geometric constraint on the shape and size of the aperture.
- As \( N \to \infty \), the polygon tends to a circular aperture of radius \( a \).
- The diffraction pattern depends on the aperture shape and size, wavelength \( \lambda \), and observation angle \( \theta \).
- The angular positions of minima relate to zeros of the aperture’s diffraction intensity function.
- The small-angle approximation simplifies the angular relationships, allowing linear approximations.
- The problem implicitly connects the polygonal aperture diffraction to the well-known circular aperture diffraction pattern (Airy pattern) in the limit.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem lies in the domain of wave optics and physical optics.
- It involves concepts from Fourier optics and diffraction theory.
- Mathematical subfields include geometry (polygon and circle properties), trigonometry (small-angle approximations), and analysis of wave interference patterns.
- Applications include optical physics, engineering (optical system design), and mathematical physics.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The exact definition of "aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon with all apothems equal to a" assumes a regular polygon, but this is not explicitly stated.
- The nature of the far-field region (Fraunhofer diffraction) is implied but not explicitly mentioned.
- The problem assumes the reader understands the transition from polygonal to circular aperture diffraction patterns as \( N \to \infty \).
- The term "angular distance between the first two minima" could be interpreted as the difference between the first and second minima angles or simply the position of the first minimum; the problem states "between the first two minima," implying a difference.
- Potential complexity arises in relating polygonal aperture diffraction minima to the circular aperture Airy pattern minima without explicit formulas provided.

The aperture is described as having N sides with equal apothems, which implies a regular polygonal shape. As N approaches infinity, the shape tends toward that of a circle, which is significant in diffraction studies.

In the limit, the circular aperture can be analyzed using well-established theories in optics, specifically Fraunhofer diffraction, which describes the far-field diffraction pattern produced by apertures. The diffraction pattern for a circular aperture is characterized by an Airy pattern, which consists of a central maximum and a series of concentric minima and maxima. The angular distance between the first two minima in the diffraction pattern can be derived from the properties of the Airy function, which governs the intensity distribution. Therefore, in the transition from a polygon to a circle, the relevant diffraction theory is the Airy pattern resulting from Fraunhofer diffraction conditions.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent nOOE:\nAs N approaches infinity, the N-sided polygon with equal apothems transforms into a circular aperture. This transition is significant in the context of diffraction theory because circular apertures have well-defined diffraction patterns, specifically described by the Airy pattern. In the limit of N going to infinity, the properties of the polygonal aperture converge to those of a circle, which allows us to apply the principles of Fraunhofer diffraction. Fraunhofer diffraction is the analysis of light patterns that occur at a distance far from the aperture, where the light waves can be approximated as parallel. The angular distance between the first two minima in the diffraction pattern is a key characteristic of this phenomenon, and it can be calculated using the properties of the circular aperture. Therefore, the relevant diffraction theory in this context is the Airy pattern derived from the circular aperture under Fraunhofer diffraction conditions.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent 7Dt0:\nAs N approaches infinity, the N-sided polygon with equal apothems increasingly resembles a circle. This transition is significant because diffraction patterns produced by apertures depend heavily on their shape. In the case of a circular aperture, the resulting diffraction pattern is well-understood as the Airy pattern, which is characterized by a central maximum and concentric rings of intensity minima and maxima. The relevant diffraction theory here is Fraunhofer diffraction, which describes the far-field diffraction pattern that emerges when light passes through an aperture. The small-angle approximation (tan theta ≈ theta) allows for simpler calculations of angular positions of minima in the diffraction pattern. Thus, in the limit as N approaches infinity, we classify the aperture as circular and apply the principles of Fraunhofer diffraction and the characteristics of the Airy pattern to analyze the resulting diffraction behavior.\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent GwCa:\nA\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent nOOE:\nA\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent 7Dt0:\nA\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 2: Synthesize and choose the most consistent classification and diffraction theory. \n\n then justify completely and detailedly, step-by-step why you think so in the "thinking" entry. \n                Consider all cases that are possible to happen.\n                Avoid some unclear explainations, such as "Using the circle equation or the condition for four points to be concyclic, we derive an equation in x.

In the limit, the circular aperture can be analyzed using well-established theories in optics, specifically Fraunhofer diffraction, which describes the far-field diffraction pattern produced by apertures. The diffraction pattern for a circular aperture is characterized by an Airy pattern, which consists of a central maximum and a series of concentric minima and maxima. The angular distance between the first two minima in the diffraction pattern can be derived from the properties of the Airy function, which governs the intensity distribution. Therefore, in the transition from a polygon to a circle, the relevant diffraction theory is the Airy pattern resulting from Fraunhofer diffraction conditions.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent nOOE:\nAs N approaches infinity, the N-sided polygon with equal apothems transforms into a circular aperture. This transition is significant in the context of diffraction theory because circular apertures have well-defined diffraction patterns, specifically described by the Airy pattern. In the limit of N going to infinity, the properties of the polygonal aperture converge to those of a circle, which allows us to apply the principles of Fraunhofer diffraction. Fraunhofer diffraction is the analysis of light patterns that occur at a distance far from the aperture, where the light waves can be approximated as parallel. The angular distance between the first two minima in the diffraction pattern is a key characteristic of this phenomenon, and it can be calculated using the properties of the circular aperture.

The relevant diffraction theory here is Fraunhofer diffraction, which describes the far-field diffraction pattern that emerges when light passes through an aperture. The small-angle approximation (tan theta ≈ theta) allows for simpler calculations of angular positions of minima in the diffraction pattern.

This led to calculating Δθ = θ2 - θ1 ≈ 1.01 λ/a, which does not match any of the provided options. Consequently, the answer was chosen as the closest option (0.610 λ/a) without properly reconciling the problem's phrasing or the physical meaning of the minima spacing, resulting in a wrong final answer.", 'feedback': "The core error lies in misunderstanding the problem statement's phrase 'angular distance between the first two minima.' The problem asks for the angular separation between the first and second minima in the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture (limit N → ∞). The known angular positions of the first two minima in the Airy pattern are approximately 1.22 λ/a and 2.23 λ/a, respectively. The difference between these is about 1.01 λ/a, which is not among the given choices. Previous agents incorrectly concluded that the answer must be 0.610 λ/a (half of 1.22 λ/a), likely confusing the first minimum's position with the angular distance between minima or misapplying the formula for minima positions.\n\nThis error stems from:\n- Misinterpretation of 'angular distance between the first two minima' as the position of the first minimum or half the first minimum angle.\n- Ignoring that the difference between the first two minima angles (1.01 λ/a) is not listed among the options.\n- Selecting the closest numerical option without reconciling the physical meaning or re-examining the problem assumptions.\n\nAdditionally, the problem defines the aperture by its apothem length 'a,' which corresponds to the radius of the inscribed circle, not the radius of the circular aperture itself. The standard Airy pattern minima positions use the aperture radius (distance from center to edge), which is the circumradius, not the apothem. This subtle geometric distinction was not addressed, causing a mismatch in the scale used for λ/a.\n\nTherefore, the failure is twofold:\n1. Misinterpretation of the problem's angular distance definition.\n2. Incorrect assumption that 'a' corresponds to the aperture radius used in the Airy pattern formula, when it actually corresponds to the apothem (inradius) of the polygon, which differs from the radius of the limiting circle.\n\nCorrecting these would require:\n- Clarifying the geometric relationship between the apothem 'a' and the radius of the circular aperture as N → ∞.\n- Using the correct radius in the Airy pattern formula to find the minima positions.\n- Recomputing the angular distance between the first two minima accordingly.\n\nThe reasoning process failed at the step of applying the Airy pattern minima formula directly with 'a' as radius and interpreting the problem's angular distance as the difference between the first two minima angles without verifying if this matches the given options or the problem's geometric definitions.", 'suggestion': "1. Refine the subtasks to explicitly address the geometric relationship between the polygon's apothem 'a' and the radius of the limiting circular aperture. This should be a dedicated subtask before applying diffraction formulas, ensuring the correct radius is used in the Airy pattern calculations.\n\n2. Improve instructions in the subtasks related to interpreting the problem statement, emphasizing precise understanding of terms like 'angular distance between the first two minima' to avoid misinterpretation.\n\n3. Enhance context passing between subtasks by including the geometric conversion result (apothem to radius) before diffraction calculations, ensuring consistent parameter usage.\n\n4. Consider adopting a Reflexion or Debate collaboration pattern specifically for the final subtasks involving formula application and answer selection, to allow agents to cross-verify assumptions and interpretations, reducing the risk of misinterpretation and premature answer selection.\n\nThese steps will directly address the root cause of the failure by ensuring correct geometric parameters and problem interpretation before applying physical formulas and selecting answers."}}]

The apothem 'a' is the distance from the center of the polygon to the midpoint of one of its sides. As N increases, the polygon's shape becomes increasingly circular, and we can relate the apothem to the radius R of the limiting circle. For a regular polygon with N sides, the radius R of the circumscribed circle (which passes through all vertices) and the apothem are related by the formula a = R * cos(π/N).

Explicitly derive that the apothem equals the radius R of the circle and that the aperture diameter D = 2a. This subtask directly addresses the critical failure of misusing \'a\' as diameter instead of radius in the Airy pattern formula. \n\n ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent ZQBk:\nTo analyze the geometric relationship between the polygon\'s apothem \'a\' and the radius and diameter of the limiting circular aperture as N approaches infinity, we need to understand the properties of a regular polygon. The apothem \'a\' of a regular N-sided polygon is the distance from the center of the polygon to the midpoint of one of its sides. As N increases, the polygon becomes more circular in shape. In the limit where N approaches infinity, the polygon effectively becomes a circle. For a regular polygon, the relationship between the apothem \'a\' and the radius \'R\' of the circumscribed circle (the circle that passes through all vertices of the polygon) is given by the formula: a = R * cos(π/N). As N approaches infinity, cos(π/N) approaches 1, leading us to conclude that a approaches R. Therefore, in the limit, the apothem \'a\' equals the radius \'R\' of the limiting circular aperture. The diameter \'D\' of the circle is then given by D = 2R. Since we have established that a = R, we can substitute to find D = 2a. Thus, we derive that in the limit N → ∞, the apothem equals the radius of the circle, and the diameter is twice the apothem. This clarifies the critical misuse of \'a\' as diameter instead of radius in the Airy pattern formula, as \'a\' should be used as the radius in that context.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent pZkR:\nTo analyze the geometric relationship between the polygon\'s apothem \'a\' and the limiting circular aperture as N approaches infinity, we first recognize that for a regular N-sided polygon, the apothem is the distance from the center of the polygon to the midpoint of one of its sides. As N becomes very large, the shape of the polygon approaches that of a circle. In the limit as N approaches infinity, the apothem \'a\' corresponds to the radius \'R\' of the circle because the distance from the center to any point on the circumference of the circle is defined as the radius. Therefore, we can state that \'a\' equals \'R\'. The diameter \'D\' of the limiting circle is twice the radius, which gives us \'D = 2R\'. Since we have established that \'R = a\', we can substitute this into the equation for diameter to find \'D = 2a\'. This derivation clarifies the critical relationship and corrects any previous misinterpretation of \'a\' as the diameter instead of the radius in the context of the Airy pattern formula. Thus, the geometric relationships are clearly defined: the apothem equals the radius of the limiting circle, and the diameter is twice the apothem.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent JIbh:\nTo analyze the geometric relationship between the apothem \'a\' of a regular N-sided polygon and the limiting circular aperture as N approaches infinity, we start by recalling the definition of the apothem. The apothem \'a\' is the distance from the center of the polygon to the midpoint of one of its sides. As N increases, the polygon\'s shape becomes increasingly circular, and we can relate the apothem to the radius R of the limiting circle. For a regular polygon with N sides, the radius R of the circumscribed circle (which passes through all vertices) and the apothem are related by the formula a = R * cos(π/N). As N approaches infinity, cos(π/N) approaches 1, leading to the conclusion that the apothem \'a\' approaches the radius R of the circle. Thus, in the limit as N → ∞, we have a = R. The diameter D of the limiting circular aperture is then given by D = 2R = 2a. This derivation clarifies that \'a\' is indeed the radius of the circle, not the diameter, addressing the critical misunderstanding in the Airy pattern formula where \'a\' must be treated as the radius. This understanding is crucial for correctly applying the diffraction formulas related to circular apertures, ensuring that the angular distance between the minima is calculated correctly based on the appropriate radius.\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent ZQBk:\nA\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent pZkR:\nA\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent JIbh:\nA\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 2: Synthesize and choose the most consistent and correct geometric relation. \n\n then justify completely and detailedly, step-by-step why you think so in the "thinking" entry. \n                Consider all cases that are possible to happen.\n                Avoid some unclear explainations, such as "Using the circle equation or the condition for four points to be concyclic, we derive an equation in x.

As N approaches infinity, the polygon approximates a circular shape, which is crucial for understanding the diffraction pattern produced. The light\'s wavelength, denoted as λ, plays a significant role in determining the position of intensity maxima and minima in the diffraction pattern. The small-angle approximation (tan θ ≈ θ) simplifies the calculations related to angular distances. The primary focus is on finding the angular distance between the first two minima in the diffraction pattern, which is a common problem in wave optics, particularly in relation to circular apertures. The assumption that the polygon is regular is implicit, as irregular polygons would complicate the diffraction pattern significantly. The transition from polygonal to circular diffraction patterns is a well-established concept in optics, where the minima can be derived from the properties of the circular aperture.

Therefore, the context is clear, and the assumptions are explicitly noted, particularly the regularity of the polygon and the implications of the small-angle approximation.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent 2VAG:\nThe problem provides a scenario where a monochromatic light source interacts with an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon with equal apothems. As N approaches infinity, the polygon approximates a circular shape, which is crucial for understanding the diffraction pattern produced. The light\'s wavelength, denoted as λ, plays a significant role in determining the position of intensity maxima and minima in the diffraction pattern. The small-angle approximation (tan θ ≈ θ) simplifies the calculations related to angular distances. The primary focus is on finding the angular distance between the first two minima in the diffraction pattern, which is a common problem in wave optics, particularly in relation to circular apertures. The assumption that the polygon is regular is implicit, as irregular polygons would complicate the diffraction pattern significantly. The transition from polygonal to circular diffraction patterns is a well-established concept in optics, where the minima can be derived from the properties of the circular aperture. Overall, the problem involves understanding the relationship between geometric properties of the aperture, the wavelength of light, and the resulting diffraction pattern, while also applying the small-angle approximation to simplify angular calculations.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent 8SSO:\nThe problem presents an N-sided polygonal aperture with equal apothems, where N approaches infinity, suggesting the shape becomes circular. The wavelength of the monochromatic light is \\lambda, and the light travels along the z-axis, leading to a diffraction pattern in the far field. The focus is on the angular distance between the first two minima in this pattern. The small-angle approximation allows us to treat angles as linear, simplifying calculations. It is assumed that the polygon is regular, meaning all sides and angles are equal, which is essential for consistent diffraction behavior. The relationship between the aperture shape and the resulting diffraction pattern is critical, as the transition from polygon to circle affects the minima\'s positions. Clarity on the nature of the far-field diffraction (Fraunhofer diffraction) is also necessary, as it determines how the pattern is observed. Overall, the assumptions about the regularity of the polygon and the nature of the diffraction need to be explicitly stated for a complete understanding of the problem context.\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent i2nt:\nB\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent 2VAG:\nA\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent 8SSO:\nA\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 1: Synthesize and choose the most consistent and correct summary of problem info. \n\n then justify completely and detailedly, step-by-step why you think so in the "thinking" entry. \n                Consider all cases that are possible to happen.\n                Avoid some unclear explainations, such as "Using the circle equation or the condition for four points to be concyclic, we derive an equation in x.

Explicitly derive that the apothem equals the radius R of the circle and that the aperture diameter D = 2a. This subtask directly addresses the critical failure of misusing \'a\' as diameter instead of radius in the Airy pattern formula. \n\n ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent ZQBk:\nTo analyze the geometric relationship between the polygon\'s apothem \'a\' and the radius and diameter of the limiting circular aperture as N approaches infinity, we need to understand the properties of a regular polygon. The apothem \'a\' of a regular N-sided polygon is the distance from the center of the polygon to the midpoint of one of its sides. As N increases, the polygon becomes more circular in shape. In the limit where N approaches infinity, the polygon effectively becomes a circle. For a regular polygon, the relationship between the apothem \'a\' and the radius \'R\' of the circumscribed circle (the circle that passes through all vertices of the polygon) is given by the formula: a = R * cos(π/N). As N approaches infinity, cos(π/N) approaches 1, leading us to conclude that a approaches R. Therefore, in the limit, the apothem \'a\' equals the radius \'R\' of the limiting circular aperture. The diameter \'D\' of the circle is then given by D = 2R. Since we have established that a = R, we can substitute to find D = 2a. Thus, we derive that in the limit N → ∞, the apothem equals the radius of the circle, and the diameter is twice the apothem. This clarifies the critical misuse of \'a\' as diameter instead of radius in the Airy pattern formula, as \'a\' should be used as the radius in that context.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent pZkR:\nTo analyze the geometric relationship between the polygon\'s apothem \'a\' and the limiting circular aperture as N approaches infinity, we first recognize that for a regular N-sided polygon, the apothem is the distance from the center of the polygon to the midpoint of one of its sides. As N becomes very large, the shape of the polygon approaches that of a circle. In the limit as N approaches infinity, the apothem \'a\' corresponds to the radius \'R\' of the circle because the distance from the center to any point on the circumference of the circle is defined as the radius. Therefore, we can state that \'a\' equals \'R\'. The diameter \'D\' of the limiting circle is twice the radius, which gives us \'D = 2R\'. Since we have established that \'R = a\', we can substitute this into the equation for diameter to find \'D = 2a\'. This derivation clarifies the critical relationship and corrects any previous misinterpretation of \'a\' as the diameter instead of the radius in the context of the Airy pattern formula. Thus, the geometric relationships are clearly defined: the apothem equals the radius of the limiting circle, and the diameter is twice the apothem.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent JIbh:\nTo analyze the geometric relationship between the apothem \'a\' of a regular N-sided polygon and the limiting circular aperture as N approaches infinity, we start by recalling the definition of the apothem.

As N approaches infinity, this polygon approximates a circular aperture. Monochromatic light of wavelength \'\\lambda\' is incident perpendicularly, leading to a diffraction pattern characterized by intensity maxima and minima. The question specifically asks for the angular distance between the first two minima in this diffraction pattern. The small-angle approximation allows us to simplify the analysis, as we can assume that \'tan(theta) = theta\'. This means that the angular positions of the minima can be approximated linearly. The transition from polygonal to circular aperture diffraction is a key aspect, as it implies that the minima will follow the same pattern as a circular aperture\'s Airy pattern. The problem assumes a regular polygon, which is crucial for determining the symmetry and properties of the diffraction pattern. Therefore, the context is clear, and the assumptions are explicitly noted, particularly the regularity of the polygon and the implications of the small-angle approximation.\n\n### answer by Final Decision Agent GROo:\nA\n\n### Sub-task 2: Analyze and clarify the geometric relationship between the polygon\'s apothem \'a\' and the radius and diameter of the limiting circular aperture as N → ∞. Explicitly derive that the apothem equals the radius R of the circle and that the aperture diameter D = 2a. This subtask directly addresses the critical failure of misusing \'a\' as diameter instead of radius in the Airy pattern formula. \n\n ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent ZQBk:\nTo analyze the geometric relationship between the polygon\'s apothem \'a\' and the radius and diameter of the limiting circular aperture as N approaches infinity, we need to understand the properties of a regular polygon. The apothem \'a\' of a regular N-sided polygon is the distance from the center of the polygon to the midpoint of one of its sides. As N increases, the polygon becomes more circular in shape. In the limit where N approaches infinity, the polygon effectively becomes a circle. For a regular polygon, the relationship between the apothem \'a\' and the radius \'R\' of the circumscribed circle (the circle that passes through all vertices of the polygon) is given by the formula: a = R * cos(π/N). As N approaches infinity, cos(π/N) approaches 1, leading us to conclude that a approaches R. Therefore, in the limit, the apothem \'a\' equals the radius \'R\' of the limiting circular aperture. The diameter \'D\' of the circle is then given by D = 2R. Since we have established that a = R, we can substitute to find D = 2a. Thus, we derive that in the limit N → ∞, the apothem equals the radius of the circle, and the diameter is twice the apothem. This clarifies the critical misuse of \'a\' as diameter instead of radius in the Airy pattern formula, as \'a\' should be used as the radius in that context.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent pZkR:\nTo analyze the geometric relationship between the polygon\'s apothem \'a\' and the limiting circular aperture as N approaches infinity, we first recognize that for a regular N-sided polygon, the apothem is the distance from the center of the polygon to the midpoint of one of its sides. As N becomes very large, the shape of the polygon approaches that of a circle. In the limit as N approaches infinity, the apothem \'a\' corresponds to the radius \'R\' of the circle because the distance from the center to any point on the circumference of the circle is defined as the radius. Therefore, we can state that \'a\' equals \'R\'. The diameter \'D\' of the limiting circle is twice the radius, which gives us \'D = 2R\'. Since we have established that \'R = a\', we can substitute this into the equation for diameter to find \'D = 2a\'. This derivation clarifies the critical relationship and corrects any previous misinterpretation of \'a\' as the diameter instead of the radius in the context of the Airy pattern formula. Thus, the geometric relationships are clearly defined: the apothem equals the radius of the limiting circle, and the diameter is twice the apothem.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent JIbh:\nTo analyze the geometric relationship between the apothem \'a\' of a regular N-sided polygon and the limiting circular aperture as N approaches infinity, we start by recalling the definition of the apothem. The apothem \'a\' is the distance from the center of the polygon to the midpoint of one of its sides. As N increases, the polygon\'s shape becomes increasingly circular, and we can relate the apothem to the radius R of the limiting circle. For a regular polygon with N sides, the radius R of the circumscribed circle (which passes through all vertices) and the apothem are related by the formula a = R * cos(π/N). As N approaches infinity, cos(π/N) approaches 1, leading to the conclusion that the apothem \'a\' approaches the radius R of the circle. Thus, in the limit as N → ∞, we have a = R. The diameter D of the limiting circular aperture is then given by D = 2R = 2a. This derivation clarifies that \'a\' is indeed the radius of the circle, not the diameter, addressing the critical misunderstanding in the Airy pattern formula where \'a\' must be treated as the radius.

In diffraction patterns, particularly for circular apertures, the minima occur at specific angles relative to the central axis. The first minimum is the first angle where the intensity falls to zero, and the second minimum is the subsequent angle where the intensity again falls to zero. The angular distance is then the absolute difference between these two angles. This interpretation aligns with standard definitions in optics, where the term \'angular distance\' typically refers to the separation between two angular positions. Therefore, this phrase does not imply any other interpretation, such as measuring the distance along the arc or any other metric; it strictly refers to the angular separation in the context of the diffraction pattern\'s minima positions.\n\n### answer by Final Decision Agent ataM:\nA\n\n### Sub-task 4: Using the geometric results from subtask_2 and the interpretation from subtask_3, derive the angular positions of the first two minima in the far-field diffraction pattern for a circular aperture of radius R = a.
