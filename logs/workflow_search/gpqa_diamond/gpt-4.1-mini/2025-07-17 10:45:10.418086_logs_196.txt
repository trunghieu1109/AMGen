1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- Compound X is characterized by IR and 1H NMR data.
- IR absorptions at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad), 1720 cm⁻¹, 1610 cm⁻¹, and 1450 cm⁻¹.
- 1H NMR signals at 10.5 ppm (broad singlet, 1H), 8.0 ppm (doublet, 2H), 7.2 ppm (doublet, 2H), 2.9 ppm (multiplet, 1H), 1.7 ppm (multiplet, 2H), 1.4 ppm (doublet, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (triplet, 3H).
- The reaction involves red phosphorus and HI, reagents typically used for reduction or halogenation.
- Four possible products are given, all aromatic compounds with alkyl or carboxylic acid substituents.

Properties:
- IR 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ broad absorption suggests presence of a carboxylic acid O–H stretch.
- IR 1720 cm⁻¹ indicates a carbonyl group, likely a carboxylic acid C=O.
- IR 1610 and 1450 cm⁻¹ correspond to aromatic C=C stretches.
- 1H NMR signals at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm (each doublet, 2H) suggest a para-substituted aromatic ring.
- The 10.5 ppm broad singlet (1H) is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton.
- Aliphatic signals (2.9, 1.7, 1.4, 0.9 ppm) indicate an alkyl side chain with specific splitting patterns (multiplet, doublet, triplet) consistent with sec-butyl or related groups.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The IR and NMR data together confirm the presence of a para-substituted aromatic ring bearing a carboxylic acid group.
- The aliphatic proton splitting patterns suggest a sec-butyl or similar alkyl substituent.
- The reaction with red phosphorus and HI is known to reduce carboxylic acids to alkyl groups or modify substituents.
- The para-substitution pattern and the nature of the side chain are key to distinguishing among the given choices.
- The presence of a carboxylic acid proton in the starting material and its fate after reaction is central to understanding the transformation.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- Organic Chemistry, specifically Spectroscopy and Reaction Mechanisms.
- Subfields: Structural elucidation using IR and NMR spectroscopy; synthetic organic transformations involving reduction or halogenation.
- Applications: Chemical synthesis, analytical chemistry, organic structure determination, and educational contexts such as competitive exams.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The exact structure of compound X prior to reaction is not explicitly given, only spectral data.
- The mechanism and extent of reaction with red phosphorus and HI are not detailed; whether the carboxylic acid is reduced or modified is implied but not stated.
- The nature of the alkyl substituent (sec-butyl vs isobutyl vs ethyl) requires careful interpretation of splitting patterns.
- Potential ambiguity in assigning NMR signals to specific protons without further data (e.g., integration, coupling constants).
- The problem assumes familiarity with typical spectral assignments and reaction outcomes, which may pose challenges for less experienced readers.
