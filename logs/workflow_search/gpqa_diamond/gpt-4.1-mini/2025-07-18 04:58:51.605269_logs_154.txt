1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- Operators Px, Py, and Pz are given as 3x3 matrices with components involving ħ and complex numbers.
- Px matrix:
  Row 1: (0, ħ/√2, 0)
  Row 2: (ħ/√2, 0, ħ/√2)
  Row 3: (0, ħ/√2, 0)
- Py matrix:
  Row 1: (0, -iħ/√2, 0)
  Row 2: (iħ/√2, 0, -iħ/√2)
  Row 3: (0, iħ/√2, 0)
- Pz matrix:
  Row 1: (ħ, 0, 0)
  Row 2: (0, 0, 0)
  Row 3: (0, 0, -ħ)
- The basis vectors are eigenvectors of Pz.
- The system is in the eigenstate of Px with eigenvalue -ħ.
- The explicit state vector is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2).

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- Px, Py, and Pz are components of a vector operator \vec{P} in a 3-dimensional Hilbert space.
- The matrices are Hermitian (as expected for observables) and likely represent spin-1 operators or angular momentum components scaled by ħ.
- The basis is chosen such that Pz is diagonal, with eigenvalues ħ, 0, and -ħ corresponding to the basis vectors.
- The given state is an eigenstate of Px with eigenvalue -ħ, expressed in the Pz eigenbasis.
- The uncertainty ΔPz depends on the expectation values ⟨Pz⟩ and ⟨Pz²⟩ in this state.
- The problem involves calculating these expectation values using the given state vector and Pz matrix.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem lies in quantum mechanics, specifically in the study of quantum angular momentum operators.
- It involves linear algebra (matrix representations, eigenvalues, eigenvectors), operator theory, and quantum measurement theory.
- Subfields include spin systems, operator algebra, and uncertainty relations.
- Such problems are common in quantum physics education, quantum information theory, and mathematical physics.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The normalization of the given state vector is not explicitly stated; it should be verified.
- The physical interpretation of the operator \vec{P} is not specified; it appears analogous to spin or angular momentum operators.
- The problem assumes familiarity with quantum mechanical operators and their matrix representations.
- Potential challenges include careful handling of complex numbers and ensuring correct computation of expectation values.
- No ambiguity in the matrices or state vector is apparent, but the problem requires precise linear algebraic manipulation.
