1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- Two stars, Star_1 and Star_2.
- Radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times the radius of Star_2.
- Mass of Star_1 is also 1.5 times the mass of Star_2.
- Both stars have the same peak wavelength of emission (from spectroscopy).
- Radial velocities: Star_1 has 0 km/s, Star_2 has 700 km/s.
- Stars are assumed to radiate as black bodies.
- Luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by some factor to be determined.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The radius and mass scaling by the same factor suggests a proportional relationship in size and mass.
- Identical peak wavelengths imply the stars have the same effective temperature, since peak wavelength is related to temperature by Wien's displacement law.
- Radial velocities differ, with Star_2 moving at 700 km/s relative to Star_1, which is at rest; this may affect observed properties via Doppler shifts but the problem states peak wavelengths are the same, indicating Doppler effects are accounted for or negligible.
- Luminosity for a black body is given by L = 4πR^2σT^4; since temperatures are equal, luminosity ratio depends on the square of the radius ratio.
- The mass information may be relevant for context or additional constraints but does not directly affect luminosity under black body assumptions.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- Astrophysics, specifically stellar physics.
- Concepts from thermodynamics (black body radiation), spectroscopy, and classical mechanics (radial velocity).
- Related mathematical fields include geometry (surface area calculations), algebra (ratios and proportionalities), and physics-based modeling.
- Such problems are common in astrophysical data analysis and educational contexts like physics or astronomy competitions.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The role of radial velocity difference is ambiguous since peak wavelengths are stated to be the same; clarification on whether Doppler effects are corrected or ignored would help.
- The significance of mass scaling equal to radius scaling is not explicitly connected to luminosity; its purpose is unclear.
- Assumptions about the stars’ temperatures being equal are inferred from identical peak wavelengths but not explicitly stated.
- Potential complexities include whether relativistic effects on luminosity or observed wavelengths are considered given the high radial velocity of Star_2.
- The exact method to compute the luminosity ratio is not detailed, leaving room for interpretation on how velocity and mass factors influence the final ratio.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The radius and mass scaling by the same factor (1.5) suggests a proportional relationship between size and mass.
- Identical peak wavelengths imply the stars have the same effective temperature, due to Wien's displacement law relating peak wavelength to temperature.
- Radial velocities differ, with Star_2 moving at 700 km/s relative to Star_1, which is at rest; this may affect observed properties via Doppler shifts but the problem states peak wavelengths are the same, indicating Doppler effects are accounted for or negligible.
- Luminosity for black bodies depends on radius and temperature via the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴.
- Since temperatures are equal (from identical peak wavelengths), luminosity ratio depends primarily on the square of the radius ratio.
- The mass ratio may relate to other stellar properties but is not directly linked to luminosity in the black body assumption.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The role of radial velocity in the problem is ambiguous since Doppler shifts would normally affect observed wavelengths, yet peak wavelengths are stated as equal.
- It is unclear if relativistic effects or Doppler corrections have been applied.
- The significance of the mass ratio is not explicitly connected to luminosity; its inclusion may imply additional physical considerations or constraints.
- The problem does not specify if the stars have the same emissivity or if other factors influence luminosity beyond black body assumptions.
- Potential complexity arises if radial velocity affects observed luminosity or if relativistic beaming is considered, but this is not stated.
