1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- The quantum state |psi> is defined as a normalized superposition of coherent states |alpha> and |-alpha>:
  |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>) / N,
  where alpha is the amplitude (a real or complex parameter), phi is the phase angle, and N is the normalization constant.
- The normalization constant is given by:
  N = sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi) * exp(-2*alpha^2)).
- The measure of non-Gaussianity (nG) is defined via the relative entropy:
  δ_b = Tr(ρ ln ρ) - Tr(τ ln τ),
  where ρ is the density matrix of the given non-Gaussian state |psi><psi|, and τ is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state.
- Numerical values specified for calculation are phi = -π/4 and alpha = 0.5.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The state |psi> is a superposition of two coherent states with amplitudes +alpha and -alpha, weighted by trigonometric functions of phi, and normalized by N to ensure unit norm.
- The normalization constant N depends on both phi and alpha, incorporating an exponential decay term exp(-2*alpha^2), reflecting the overlap between coherent states.
- The relative entropy measure δ_b quantifies the difference between the non-Gaussian state ρ and a Gaussian reference τ, capturing the degree of non-Gaussianity.
- The density matrices ρ and τ are operators in the Hilbert space; their logarithms and traces involve spectral decompositions or expansions in an appropriate basis.
- The choice of phi and alpha fixes the specific superposition and amplitude, influencing the shape and properties of the state and thus the non-Gaussianity.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem lies in quantum physics, specifically quantum optics and quantum information theory.
- It involves concepts from quantum state representation, density matrices, and measures of quantum state properties.
- Mathematical subfields include linear algebra (operators, traces), functional analysis, and information theory (relative entropy).
- Applications include quantum computing, quantum communication, and characterization of quantum states in experiments.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The exact form or construction of the reference Gaussian state τ is not specified; typically, it is chosen to have the same first and second moments as ρ, but this is not explicitly stated.
- The domain and nature of alpha (real or complex) is not explicitly mentioned, though commonly alpha is real in such contexts.
- The computational method for evaluating traces involving logarithms of density matrices is not detailed, which can be nontrivial.
- Potential challenges include handling the non-orthogonality of coherent states, normalization subtleties, and numerical evaluation of operator logarithms.
- The problem assumes familiarity with quantum state formalism and relative entropy measures without elaborating on intermediate steps.
