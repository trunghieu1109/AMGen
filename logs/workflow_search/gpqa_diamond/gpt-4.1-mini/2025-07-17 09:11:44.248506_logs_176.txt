1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- Two stars, Star_1 and Star_2.
- Radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times the radius of Star_2.
- Mass of Star_1 is also 1.5 times the mass of Star_2.
- Both stars have the same peak wavelength of emission, determined via spectroscopy.
- Radial velocities: Star_1 has 0 km/s, Star_2 has 700 km/s.
- Stars are assumed to radiate as black bodies.
- Luminosity of Star_1 is computed to be greater than that of Star_2 by some factor.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The radius and mass scaling by the same factor (1.5) suggests a proportional relationship in size and mass.
- Identical peak wavelengths imply the stars have the same effective temperature, since peak wavelength is related to temperature by Wien's displacement law.
- Radial velocities differ, with Star_2 moving at 700 km/s relative to Star_1, which is at rest; this could affect observed wavelengths due to Doppler shift, but the problem states the peak wavelengths are the same, indicating correction or rest-frame comparison.
- Luminosity for a black body is given by L = 4πR²σT⁴; since temperatures are equal, luminosity ratio depends on the square of the radius ratio.
- The mass information may relate to other stellar properties but is not directly linked to luminosity in the black body assumption.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- Astrophysics, specifically stellar physics.
- Concepts from thermodynamics (black body radiation), spectroscopy, and classical mechanics (radial velocity).
- Related mathematical fields include algebra and physics-based modeling.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The role of radial velocity in the luminosity comparison is not explicitly detailed; whether Doppler effects are accounted for or negligible is unclear.
- The significance of mass scaling equal to radius scaling is not fully explained; its impact on luminosity or other parameters is ambiguous.
- The problem does not specify if the stars are at the same distance or if observational effects influence luminosity measurements.
- Potential complexities in interpreting the radial velocity's effect on observed wavelengths and luminosities.
- The exact method used to compute the luminosity ratio is not provided, leaving room for assumptions.

[{'verifier_name': 'o4-mini', 'evaluation': {'failure_reason': 'The agents treated the reported “same peak wavelength” as implying identical intrinsic temperatures, completely overlooking the Doppler shift on Star_2’s spectrum due to its 700 km/s radial velocity. As a result they set T₁=T₂ and obtained L₁/L₂=(1.5)²=2.25, when in fact one must first correct the observed peak wavelength for the redshift of Star_2 and only then apply Wien’s law.', 'feedback': '1. In Sub-task 1 the reasoning applied Wien’s displacement law directly to the observed λ_max for both stars, concluding T₁=T₂. But Star_2’s λ_max was measured after a 700 km/s redshift. You must compute λ_rest,2=λ_obs/(1+v/c) before inferring T₂. 2. In Sub-task 4 you stated that radial velocity “does not affect intrinsic luminosity,” which is true, but missed that it does change the inference of temperature from an observed wavelength. 3. By treating Doppler effects as irrelevant at all stages, the workflow failed to capture the small (~0.23) correction factor that shifts the answer from ~2.25 down to ~2.23.', 'suggestion': 'Introduce an explicit sub-task immediately after reading the observed peak wavelengths: “Sub-task X: Compute each star’s rest-frame peak wavelength by applying the relativistic Doppler formula, then determine its intrinsic temperature via Wien’s law.” Update the Sub-task 1 instruction to require Doppler correction. This ensures T₂≠T₁ and yields the correct luminosity ratio ≃2.23. Optionally switch Sub-task 1’s collaboration style to a structured Chain-of-Thought so agents systematically incorporate v/c corrections rather than debating only the black‐body law.'}}, {'verifier_name': 'gpt-4.1-mini', 'evaluation': {'failure_reason': "The previous reasoning process failed because it incorrectly assumed that the observed peak wavelengths of the two stars are the same in the observer's frame without properly accounting for the Doppler shift caused by the significant radial velocity difference. This led to the incorrect conclusion that the stars have the same intrinsic temperature, which directly affected the luminosity ratio calculation.", 'feedback': 'The critical error occurred in Sub-task 1 where the agents concluded that the stars have equal temperatures solely based on the observed peak wavelengths being equal. However, Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s relative to Star_1, which would cause a Doppler shift in its observed spectrum. The problem states the observed peak wavelengths are the same, but this is inconsistent with the Doppler effect unless the wavelengths are corrected to the rest frame. The agents failed to clarify or verify whether the given peak wavelengths are observed or rest-frame values. Without correcting for Doppler shift, the assumption of equal temperatures is invalid. This flawed assumption propagated through Sub-task 3 and Sub-task 5, leading to an incorrect luminosity ratio calculation. The radial velocity difference was acknowledged in Sub-task 4, but the impact on temperature determination was not properly integrated into the earlier subtasks. The context lacked explicit clarification on whether the peak wavelengths were Doppler-corrected or observed values, which is crucial for accurate temperature comparison. The agents also did not consider the relativistic Doppler formula or its effect on the peak wavelength and temperature inference. The collaboration pattern (Debate and SC_CoT) was effective for straightforward calculations but insufficient for handling this subtle astrophysical nuance. The failure to propagate the Doppler correction insight from Sub-task 4 back to Sub-task 1 and 3 caused the final answer to be incorrect. In summary, the reasoning failed at the step of interpreting the observed peak wavelengths without Doppler correction, leading to a wrong temperature equality assumption and thus an incorrect luminosity ratio.', 'suggestion': '1) Refine Sub-task 1 to explicitly require agents to analyze the impact of radial velocity on the observed peak wavelengths and to determine whether the given wavelengths are observed or rest-frame values. This subtask should include applying Doppler shift corrections to infer the intrinsic temperatures accurately. 2) Change the collaboration pattern for Sub-task 1 and Sub-task 4 to a stronger Reflexion or Iterative Review pattern, allowing insights about Doppler effects and radial velocity to be integrated back into temperature determination and luminosity calculations. This will ensure that the impact of radial velocity is not treated as an isolated consideration but is incorporated into the core physical parameter derivations. Additionally, improve instructions to emphasize the necessity of Doppler correction before comparing temperatures and computing luminosity ratios.'}}]
