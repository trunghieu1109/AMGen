============== Task detailed analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- There is a star with radius R_star = 1.5 R_sun.
- A first planet with radius R_p1 = 1 Earth radius, in a circular orbit with orbital period P1 = 3 days.
- The first planet has a transit impact parameter b = 0.2.
- A second planet with radius R_p2 = 2.5 Earth radii, also in a circular orbit and sharing the same orbital plane as the first planet.
- The problem involves determining the maximum orbital period of the second planet such that it exhibits both transit and occultation events.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The transit impact parameter b = 0.2 for the first planet indicates the sky-projected distance between the planet’s orbital path and the stellar disk center, normalized by the stellar radius.
- Both planets orbit the same star and share the same orbital plane, implying their inclinations are equal.
- Transit and occultation events require the planet to pass in front of and behind the star from the observer’s viewpoint, which depends on orbital inclination, star radius, and orbital distance.
- The maximum orbital period for the second planet to show both events is constrained by the geometry of the system and the requirement that the planet’s orbit must be aligned sufficiently close to the line of sight.
- The radius of the second planet affects the transit depth but not directly the orbital period constraints; however, it may influence detectability.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem lies primarily in astrophysics and celestial mechanics.
- Mathematically, it involves geometry (orbital geometry, impact parameters), algebra (orbital period relations), and possibly some trigonometry.
- Subfields include exoplanet transit photometry and orbital dynamics.
- Such problems are common in astrophysical research and mathematical modeling of planetary systems, as well as in astronomy competitions.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The exact definition or formula used for the transit impact parameter and how it applies to the second planet is not explicitly stated.
- The problem assumes circular orbits and coplanarity but does not specify the inclination angle explicitly.
- It is unclear whether the second planet’s orbit is interior or exterior relative to the first planet’s orbit.
- The influence of stellar limb darkening or observational constraints is not mentioned.
- The problem does not specify if the orbital periods are related by resonance or any other dynamical constraints.
- Potential challenges include relating orbital period to orbital radius via Kepler’s third law and translating impact parameter constraints into maximum allowable orbital distances for transit and occultation.
