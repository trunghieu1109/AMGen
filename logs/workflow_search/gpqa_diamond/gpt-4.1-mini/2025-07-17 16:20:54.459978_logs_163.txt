============== Task detailed analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- Two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2.
- Orbital periods (time between consecutive primary eclipses): system_1 has 2 years, system_2 has 1 year.
- Radial velocity (RV) sinusoidal amplitude for system_1: 10 km/s and 5 km/s for the two stars.
- RV sinusoidal amplitude for system_2: 15 km/s and 10 km/s for the two stars.
- The mass of each system is defined as the sum of the masses of its two stars.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The orbital period relates to the total mass of the binary system via Kepler's third law.
- Radial velocity amplitudes correspond to the orbital velocities of each star around the center of mass, which depend on the mass ratio and orbital parameters.
- The ratio of the RV amplitudes inversely relates to the mass ratio of the two stars in each system.
- The periods and velocity amplitudes together allow inference of the total system mass and mass distribution.
- Constraints such as sinusoidal RV variations imply circular or near-circular orbits.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- Astrophysics, specifically stellar dynamics and binary star systems.
- Celestial mechanics and orbital mechanics.
- Application of Kepler's laws and Doppler spectroscopy.
- Relevant in observational astronomy and astrophysical data analysis.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- Assumptions about orbital inclination (likely edge-on due to eclipses) are implicit but not explicitly stated.
- The eccentricity of orbits is not given; sinusoidal RV suggests circular orbits but not confirmed.
- The exact method to combine RV amplitudes and periods to find total mass is not detailed.
- Potential uncertainties in measurements or systemic velocities are not mentioned.
- The problem does not specify if the orbits are coplanar or if other perturbations exist.
