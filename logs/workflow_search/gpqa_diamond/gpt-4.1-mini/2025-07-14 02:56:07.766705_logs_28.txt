[{'objective': 'Compare mutant gene sequences to the intact gene sequence to identify specific nucleotide changes.'}, {'objective': "Predict the effect of each mutation on the gene's coding sequence and resulting protein, focusing on disruptive mutations such as premature stop codons or frameshifts."}, {'objective': 'Assess which mutation is most likely to abolish the function of the gene responsible for synthesizing the anti-nutritional compound.'}, {'objective': 'Select the mutation that most effectively eliminates the anti-nutritional compound based on predicted gene disruption.'}]
