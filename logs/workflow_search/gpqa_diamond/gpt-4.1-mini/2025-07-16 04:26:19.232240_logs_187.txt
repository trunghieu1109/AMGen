1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- The crystal system is rhombohedral.
- Interatomic distance (lattice parameter) is 10 Angstrom.
- The lattice angles are equal: \( \alpha = \beta = \gamma = 30^{\circ} \).
- The plane of interest is the (111) plane, specified by Miller indices.
- Four possible values for the interplanar distance are given: 9.54 Å, 8.95 Å, 9.08 Å, and 10.05 Å.

Properties:
- Rhombohedral lattice has equal edge lengths and equal angles, but angles are not 90°, indicating a skewed unit cell.
- The (111) plane refers to a set of lattice planes intersecting the axes at one lattice parameter each.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The interplanar distance depends on the lattice parameters (edge length and angles) and the Miller indices.
- The equal angles and equal edge lengths define the geometry of the unit cell, influencing the spacing between lattice planes.
- The (111) plane's interplanar spacing is related to the reciprocal lattice vectors and can be computed using the lattice parameters and the plane indices.
- The condition \( \alpha=\beta=\gamma=30^{\circ} \) is unusual (less than 90°), affecting the calculation of interplanar distances compared to cubic or orthorhombic systems.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem lies in the domain of solid state physics and crystallography.
- Subfields include crystallographic geometry, lattice theory, and materials science.
- Mathematical concepts involved include 3D geometry, vector algebra, and lattice plane calculations.
- Such problems are common in materials characterization, X-ray diffraction analysis, and crystallographic computations.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The term "interatomic distance" is used; it is assumed to correspond to the lattice parameter (edge length) of the rhombohedral cell, but this should be confirmed.
- The exact definition of the lattice vectors and their orientation is not specified, which may affect the calculation.
- The angles are given as 30°, which is atypical for rhombohedral crystals; usually, angles are closer to or greater than 60°, so this may require careful interpretation.
- The problem does not specify units for the angles (assumed degrees) or whether the lattice is primitive or centered.
- Potential complexity arises from the non-orthogonal lattice angles, making direct application of standard formulas non-trivial.
