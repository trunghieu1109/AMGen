1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- The system's state at time t is given by the column matrix (vector) \( \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \).
- The observable is represented by a 3x3 matrix operator \( P \) with elements:
  \[ P = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \end{pmatrix} \]
- The problem involves calculating the probability that a measurement of the observable yields the eigenvalue 0 at time t.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The state vector represents the system's state in a 3-dimensional Hilbert space.
- The observable \( P \) is a Hermitian operator (implied by the symmetric matrix), representing a measurable physical quantity.
- The probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue (here, 0) corresponds to the squared magnitude of the projection of the state vector onto the eigenspace associated with that eigenvalue.
- The matrix \( P \) likely has eigenvalues including 0, and the problem implicitly requires understanding the spectral decomposition of \( P \).
- The constraints involve normalization and orthogonality conditions inherent in quantum mechanics, influencing how probabilities are computed.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem lies in the domain of linear algebra and quantum mechanics.
- Subfields include quantum theory (specifically quantum measurement theory), matrix analysis, and eigenvalue problems.
- Such problems commonly arise in physics (quantum systems), mathematical physics, and quantum computing.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The state vector is given but not explicitly normalized; it is unclear if normalization is assumed or required.
- The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \( P \) are not provided, which are essential for determining the projection onto the zero eigenvalue eigenspace.
- The problem does not specify the basis or whether the given vector is in the eigenbasis of \( P \).
- Potential challenges include computing eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \( P \), normalizing the state vector, and projecting onto the correct eigenspace to find the probability.
