[{'objective': 'Identify and characterize the retrovirus by sequencing its genetic material'}, {'objective': 'Select a specific molecular target (e.g., viral DNA, RNA, or cDNA) suitable for detection'}, {'objective': 'Develop a molecular detection assay such as PCR or real-time PCR based on the selected target'}, {'objective': 'Validate and optimize the diagnostic kit for sensitivity, specificity, and rapid detection in clinical samples'}]
============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- The problem context is an outbreak of a viral infectious disease caused by a retrovirus in a city.
- The goal involves designing a molecular diagnostic kit for quick detection.
- Four choices describe different diagnostic approaches:
  * Choice 1: Identify virus by DNA sequencing, then develop a PCR kit.
  * Choice 2: Identify IgG antibodies, then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG.
  * Choice 3: Identify virus using symptom information, then design a nested PCR kit.
  * Choice 4: Identify virus by cDNA sequencing, then develop a real-time PCR kit.
- Key entities: virus identification methods (DNA sequencing, cDNA sequencing, symptom-based), diagnostic techniques (PCR, nested PCR, real-time PCR, ELISA), target molecules (viral DNA, cDNA, antibodies).

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- Virus identification is the initial step, which informs the design of the diagnostic kit.
- Different identification methods imply different molecular targets: DNA sequencing targets viral genome, cDNA sequencing targets reverse-transcribed viral RNA, symptom-based identification is indirect.
- Diagnostic methods vary: PCR-based methods amplify viral genetic material; ELISA detects host antibodies (IgG) against the virus.
- Constraints include speed and accuracy of diagnosis.
- The choice of molecular target (viral genome vs antibodies) affects kit design and diagnostic window.
- Nested PCR and real-time PCR are variations aimed at improving sensitivity and quantification.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- Primary domain: Molecular biology and biotechnology.
- Subfields: Virology, diagnostic assay development, molecular diagnostics.
- Related concepts: PCR techniques, antibody detection assays, nucleic acid sequencing.
- Applications: Clinical diagnostics, epidemiology, public health response.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The problem does not specify the stage of infection or viral load, which affects choice of target (viral genome vs antibodies).
- The term "cDNA sequencing" could be ambiguous without specifying if it refers to sequencing viral RNA after reverse transcription.
- Symptom-based virus identification is vague and may lack specificity.
- No information on resource availability, time constraints, or required sensitivity/specificity.
- Potential challenges include differentiating between active infection and past exposure (especially for antibody detection), and technical feasibility of each method in the outbreak context.
