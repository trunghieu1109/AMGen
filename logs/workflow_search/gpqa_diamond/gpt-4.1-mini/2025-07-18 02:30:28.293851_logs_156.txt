============== Task detailed analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- The problem context is an outbreak of a viral infectious disease caused by a retrovirus.
- The goal is to design a molecular diagnostic kit for quick detection.
- Four choices are given, each describing a sequence of steps:
  * Choice 1: Identify virus via DNA sequencing, then develop a PCR kit.
  * Choice 2: Identify IgG antibodies, then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG.
  * Choice 3: Identify virus based on symptoms, then design a nested PCR kit.
  * Choice 4: Identify virus via cDNA sequencing, then develop a real-time PCR kit.
- Key entities: virus identification methods (DNA sequencing, cDNA sequencing, symptom-based identification, antibody detection), diagnostic techniques (PCR, nested PCR, real-time PCR, ELISA).

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- Virus identification is the initial step, which informs the design of the diagnostic kit.
- DNA sequencing and cDNA sequencing relate to direct genetic analysis of the virus; cDNA sequencing involves reverse transcription of RNA to DNA, relevant for retroviruses.
- Antibody detection (IgG) targets host immune response rather than the virus itself.
- PCR-based methods amplify viral genetic material for detection; nested PCR is a more sensitive variant.
- ELISA targets antibodies, indicating past or ongoing immune response.
- Symptom-based identification is indirect and less specific.
- Constraints include speed and accuracy of diagnosis, influencing choice of method.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- Primary domain: Molecular biology and virology.
- Subfields: Diagnostic assay development, molecular diagnostics, immunology.
- Related concepts: Nucleic acid sequencing, PCR techniques, antibody detection assays.
- Applications: Public health response, clinical diagnostics, epidemiology.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The problem does not specify whether the virus is RNA or DNA based, though retroviruses are RNA viruses.
- The reliability and availability of symptom-based identification are ambiguous.
- The timing of antibody production (IgG) relative to infection stage is not stated.
- The problem does not clarify resource constraints or required sensitivity/specificity.
- Potential challenges include choosing between direct viral detection versus immune response detection, and the appropriateness of sequencing methods given viral genome type.
