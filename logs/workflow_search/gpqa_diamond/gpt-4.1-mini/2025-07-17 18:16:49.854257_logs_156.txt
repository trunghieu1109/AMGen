============== Task detailed analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- The problem context is an outbreak of a viral infectious disease caused by a retrovirus.
- The goal involves designing a molecular diagnostic kit for quick detection.
- Four choices are provided, each describing a sequence of steps:
  * Choice 1: Identify virus by DNA sequencing, then develop a PCR kit.
  * Choice 2: Identify IgG antibodies, then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG.
  * Choice 3: Identify virus using symptom information, then design a nested PCR kit.
  * Choice 4: Identify virus by cDNA sequencing, then develop a real-time PCR kit.
- Key entities include the virus, viral genetic material (DNA or cDNA), antibodies (IgG), diagnostic techniques (PCR, nested PCR, real-time PCR, ELISA).

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- Identification methods vary: direct genetic sequencing (DNA or cDNA), antibody detection, or symptom-based inference.
- Diagnostic kits correspond to identification methods: PCR-based kits rely on nucleic acid detection; ELISA targets antibodies.
- Constraints include speed and accuracy of diagnosis.
- The choice of sequencing (DNA vs. cDNA) relates to the retrovirus biology (RNA genome requiring reverse transcription).
- Symptom-based identification is indirect and may affect specificity.
- Nested PCR and real-time PCR are advanced PCR techniques enhancing sensitivity and quantification.
- These components influence the diagnostic approach's reliability, speed, and specificity.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- Primary domain: Molecular biology and biotechnology.
- Subfields: Virology, diagnostic assay development, molecular diagnostics.
- Techniques involved: DNA/RNA sequencing, PCR methodologies, immunoassays (ELISA).
- Applications: Clinical diagnostics, infectious disease control, public health.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The problem does not specify the viral genome type explicitly (RNA or DNA), which affects sequencing choice.
- The role of symptoms in viral identification is vague and may lack precision.
- The timing and stage of infection relevant to antibody detection (IgG) are not detailed.
- The problem does not clarify resource availability or constraints influencing kit design.
- Potential challenges include differentiating between direct viral detection and immune response detection, and the technical feasibility of each method in the outbreak context.
