[{'objective': 'Identify and characterize the retrovirus by sequencing its genetic material'}, {'objective': 'Select a specific molecular target (e.g., viral DNA, RNA, or cDNA) suitable for detection'}, {'objective': 'Develop a sensitive and specific molecular detection method such as PCR or real-time PCR based on the selected target'}, {'objective': 'Validate the diagnostic kit for sensitivity, specificity, and rapid detection capability'}]
============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- The problem context is an outbreak of a viral infectious disease caused by a retrovirus in a city.
- The goal is to design a molecular diagnostic kit for quick detection.
- Four choices are provided, each describing a sequence of steps:
  * Choice 1: Identify virus by DNA sequencing, then develop a PCR kit.
  * Choice 2: Identify IgG antibodies, then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG antibodies.
  * Choice 3: Identify virus using symptom information from patients, then design a nested PCR kit.
  * Choice 4: Identify virus by cDNA sequencing, then develop a real-time PCR kit.
- Key entities: virus (retrovirus), DNA sequencing, cDNA sequencing, PCR, nested PCR, real-time PCR, IgG antibodies, ELISA.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- Identification methods vary: direct viral genetic material sequencing (DNA or cDNA), antibody detection, or symptom-based inference.
- Diagnostic methods depend on identification: PCR-based kits rely on nucleic acid sequences; ELISA targets antibodies.
- Constraints include speed and accuracy of diagnosis.
- The choice of sequencing (DNA vs cDNA) reflects the nature of retroviruses (RNA viruses requiring reverse transcription).
- Symptom-based identification is indirect and may affect specificity.
- The relationships show a pipeline: identification method informs the design of the diagnostic kit.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- Relevant domains: Molecular biology, Virology, Diagnostic biotechnology.
- Subfields: Genetic sequencing technologies, Immunology (antibody detection), PCR techniques (standard, nested, real-time).
- Applications: Infectious disease diagnostics, public health response, biomedical research.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The problem does not specify the viral genome type explicitly (though retrovirus implies RNA).
- The term "identify the virus using symptoms" is vague and may lack precision.
- The difference between DNA and cDNA sequencing in this context may need clarification.
- The relative advantages or limitations of each diagnostic method are not detailed.
- Potential challenges include the accuracy of symptom-based identification and the technical feasibility of each kit design under outbreak conditions.
