============== Task detailed analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- The problem context is an outbreak of a viral infectious disease caused by a retrovirus in a city.
- The goal involves designing a molecular diagnostic kit for quick detection.
- Four choices describe different diagnostic approaches:
  * Choice 1: Identify virus via DNA sequencing, then develop a PCR kit.
  * Choice 2: Identify IgG antibodies, then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG.
  * Choice 3: Identify virus based on symptoms, then design a nested PCR kit.
  * Choice 4: Identify virus via cDNA sequencing, then develop a real-time PCR kit.
- Key entities include the virus, viral genetic material (DNA or cDNA), antibodies (IgG), diagnostic methods (PCR, nested PCR, real-time PCR, ELISA), and patient symptoms.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- Identification methods vary: direct genetic sequencing (DNA or cDNA), antibody detection, or symptom-based inference.
- Diagnostic techniques depend on the identification step: PCR-based methods require knowledge of viral genetic sequences; ELISA targets host immune response (IgG antibodies).
- Constraints include speed and accuracy of diagnosis, and the nature of the retrovirus (RNA virus requiring reverse transcription to cDNA).
- The choice of sequencing (DNA vs. cDNA) reflects the viral genome type and impacts downstream assay design.
- Symptom-based identification is indirect and may affect specificity.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- Primary domain: Molecular biology and virology.
- Subfields: Diagnostic assay development, molecular diagnostics, immunology (antibody detection), nucleic acid amplification techniques.
- Related fields: Biotechnology, clinical microbiology, epidemiology.
- Applications: Infectious disease diagnostics, public health response, biomedical research.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The problem does not specify whether the retrovirus genome is RNA or DNA, which affects sequencing and assay choice.
- The reliability of symptom-based identification is ambiguous due to symptom overlap with other diseases.
- The timing of antibody production (IgG) relative to infection onset is not stated, which influences ELISA effectiveness.
- The problem does not clarify resource availability or constraints (e.g., equipment, time, expertise).
- Potential challenges include differentiating between active infection and past exposure (especially for antibody tests), and the complexity of nested vs. real-time PCR methods.
