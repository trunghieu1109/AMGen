[{'objective': 'Identify and characterize the retrovirus by sequencing its genetic material'}, {'objective': 'Select a specific molecular target (e.g., viral DNA, RNA, or cDNA) suitable for detection'}, {'objective': 'Develop a molecular assay such as PCR or real-time PCR based on the selected target'}, {'objective': 'Validate the diagnostic kit for sensitivity, specificity, and rapid detection capability'}]
============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- The problem context is an outbreak of a viral infectious disease caused by a retrovirus.
- The task is to design a molecular diagnostic kit for quick detection.
- Four choices are provided, each describing a different diagnostic approach:
  * Choice 1: Identify virus by DNA sequencing, then develop a PCR kit.
  * Choice 2: Identify IgG antibodies, then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG.
  * Choice 3: Identify virus based on symptoms, then design a nested PCR kit.
  * Choice 4: Identify virus by cDNA sequencing, then develop a real-time PCR kit.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The identification step varies: direct viral genetic material sequencing (DNA or cDNA), antibody detection, or symptom-based inference.
- The diagnostic method depends on the identification: PCR (standard, nested, or real-time) or ELISA.
- Constraints include speed and accuracy of diagnosis.
- The choice of sequencing (DNA vs cDNA) relates to the retrovirus being RNA-based, requiring reverse transcription.
- Antibody detection (IgG) reflects host immune response rather than direct viral detection.
- Nested PCR and real-time PCR are advanced PCR techniques with different sensitivities and complexities.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- Relevant domains include molecular biology, virology, and biotechnology.
- Subfields: molecular diagnostics, nucleic acid amplification techniques (PCR), immunoassays (ELISA).
- Applications: infectious disease diagnostics, clinical laboratory testing, epidemiology.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The problem does not specify whether the virus is RNA or DNA based, though retroviruses are RNA viruses.
- The timing of infection affects antibody presence; IgG may not be detectable early.
- The symptom-based identification is vague and may lack specificity.
- The choice between DNA and cDNA sequencing needs clarification given retrovirus biology.
- The problem does not specify resource availability or constraints affecting kit design.
- Potential challenges include differentiating between direct viral detection and host immune response detection, and the technical complexity of nested vs real-time PCR.
