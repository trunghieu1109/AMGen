============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- The quantum state |psi> is defined as a normalized superposition of coherent states |alpha> and |-alpha>:
  |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>) / N,
  where alpha is the amplitude (real or complex parameter), phi is the phase angle, and N is the normalization constant.
- The normalization constant N is given by:
  N = sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi) * exp(-2*alpha^2)).
- The measure of non-Gaussianity (nG) is defined via the relative entropy:
  δ_b = Tr(ρ ln ρ) - Tr(τ ln τ),
  where ρ is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian Schrödinger cat state, and τ is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state.
- Specific parameter values are given for evaluation: phi = -π/4 and alpha = 0.5.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The state |psi> is a linear combination of two coherent states, which are Gaussian states, but their superposition generally results in a non-Gaussian state.
- The normalization constant N depends on both phi and alpha, ensuring |psi> is a unit vector.
- The relative entropy measure compares the given non-Gaussian state ρ to a Gaussian reference state τ, quantifying the deviation from Gaussianity.
- The trace expressions involve logarithms of density matrices, indicating the use of von Neumann entropy or quantum relative entropy concepts.
- The parameters phi and alpha influence the shape and overlap of the coherent states, affecting the degree of non-Gaussianity.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem lies in the domain of quantum physics, specifically quantum information theory.
- Subfields involved include quantum optics (coherent states, Schrödinger cat states), quantum state characterization, and quantum entropy measures.
- Mathematical concepts include linear algebra (density matrices), functional analysis (trace and logarithm of operators), and probability theory (entropy).
- Such problems are relevant in quantum computing, quantum communication, and foundational studies of quantum states.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The exact form or construction of the reference Gaussian state τ is not specified; typically, it is chosen to have the same first and second moments as ρ, but this is not stated.
- The nature of alpha (real or complex) is not explicitly mentioned, though often taken as real in such contexts.
- The computational method for evaluating the traces involving logarithms of density matrices is not detailed, which can be nontrivial.
- Potential challenges include handling the non-orthogonality of coherent states, normalization subtleties, and numerical evaluation of operator logarithms.
- The problem assumes familiarity with quantum states and entropy measures without elaborating on the underlying definitions or properties.
