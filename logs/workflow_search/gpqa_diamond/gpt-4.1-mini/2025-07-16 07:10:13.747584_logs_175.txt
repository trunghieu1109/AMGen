1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- The system's state at time t is given by the column vector \( \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \).
- Two observables, P and Q, are represented by 3x3 matrices.
- Operator P's matrix elements are:
  \[ P = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \end{pmatrix} \]
- Operator Q's matrix elements are:
  \[ Q = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix} \]
- The problem involves sequential measurements: first measuring P and then measuring Q.
- The specific measurement outcomes of interest are eigenvalue 0 for P and eigenvalue -1 for Q.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The state vector represents the system's initial condition in a 3-dimensional Hilbert space.
- Operators P and Q are Hermitian matrices representing observables with eigenvalues corresponding to possible measurement outcomes.
- The measurement of P projects the state onto the eigenspace associated with eigenvalue 0.
- After the measurement of P yielding 0, the system collapses to the corresponding eigenstate (or eigenspace).
- The subsequent measurement of Q on this collapsed state yields probabilities for its eigenvalues, including -1.
- The problem requires understanding the projection postulate and calculation of probabilities via inner products and projection operators.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem lies in the domain of quantum mechanics, specifically quantum measurement theory.
- Mathematically, it involves linear algebra (vector spaces, eigenvalues, eigenvectors, projections) and probability theory.
- Subfields include quantum linear algebra and operator theory.
- Such problems are common in quantum physics, quantum information theory, and mathematical physics.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The state vector is given but not normalized; normalization is typically required for probability calculations.
- It is not explicitly stated whether the matrices P and Q are Hermitian, though their form suggests so.
- The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P and Q are not provided; these must be determined to identify the relevant eigenspaces.
- The problem assumes standard quantum measurement postulates but does not specify the measurement basis or degeneracies.
- Potential challenges include computing eigenprojections, normalizing states, and handling sequential measurement probabilities.
