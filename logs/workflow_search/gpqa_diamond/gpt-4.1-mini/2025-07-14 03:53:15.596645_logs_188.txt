============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- The problem provides four types of (effective) particles: Magnon, Skyrmion, Pion, and Phonon.
- The key condition is whether each particle is associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry.
- No numerical values or explicit equations are given.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- Each particle type is related to physical systems where symmetries may be spontaneously broken.
- Magnons are quasiparticles representing spin wave excitations in magnetically ordered systems, typically arising from spontaneously broken spin rotational symmetry.
- Skyrmions are topological solitons in field theories and condensed matter, often related to nontrivial configurations but not necessarily directly tied to spontaneous symmetry breaking.
- Pions are mesons interpreted as Nambu-Goldstone bosons resulting from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics.
- Phonons are quantized lattice vibrations in crystals, generally associated with broken translational symmetry due to the lattice structure.
- The condition of spontaneous symmetry breaking is central to understanding which particles emerge as collective excitations or topological defects.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem lies in theoretical and condensed matter physics, specifically in the study of symmetry breaking and particle excitations.
- Relevant subfields include quantum field theory, condensed matter physics, and particle physics.
- Concepts involved include spontaneous symmetry breaking, Nambu-Goldstone bosons, topological solitons, and quasiparticles.
- Such problems commonly appear in advanced physics education, research, and competitions.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The term "effective particles" could be ambiguous without specifying the physical context (e.g., condensed matter vs. particle physics).
- The nature of the symmetry (global, local, continuous, discrete) involved in each case is not explicitly stated.
- The problem assumes familiarity with the concept of spontaneous symmetry breaking and its relation to particle excitations.
- Potential challenge includes distinguishing between particles arising directly from spontaneous symmetry breaking and those that do not, especially for topological objects like skyrmions.

Magnons are associated with the spontaneous breaking of spin rotational symmetry in magnetically ordered systems, making them related to spontaneously-broken symmetry. Pions are Nambu-Goldstone bosons resulting from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics, directly associating them with spontaneously-broken symmetry. Phonons arise due to the periodic structure of a crystal lattice, associated with the breaking of continuous translational symmetry by the lattice, thus linking them to spontaneously-broken symmetry. Skyrmions, however, are topological solitons that exist due to nontrivial topology rather than direct consequences of spontaneous symmetry breaking. While they can appear in systems with broken symmetries, their existence is more about topological protection rather than being a direct result of symmetry breaking.
