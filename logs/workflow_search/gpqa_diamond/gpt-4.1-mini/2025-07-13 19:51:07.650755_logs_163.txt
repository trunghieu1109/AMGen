============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- Two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2.
- Orbital periods (time between consecutive primary eclipses): system_1 has 2 years, system_2 has 1 year.
- Radial velocity (RV) amplitudes for system_1: 10 km/s and 5 km/s for the two stars.
- RV amplitudes for system_2: 15 km/s and 10 km/s for the two stars.
- The mass of each system is defined as the sum of the masses of its two stars.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The orbital period relates to the total mass of the binary system via Kepler's third law.
- Radial velocity amplitudes correspond to the orbital velocities of each star around the center of mass, which depend on the mass ratio and orbital parameters.
- The sinusoidal nature of RV variations indicates circular or near-circular orbits.
- The ratio of RV amplitudes between the two stars in each system provides information about the mass ratio of the stars.
- The periods and velocity amplitudes together allow inference of total system masses and mass ratios.
- Constraints such as eclipses imply the orbital plane is nearly edge-on, simplifying interpretation of RV amplitudes as true orbital velocities.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- Astrophysics, specifically stellar dynamics and binary star systems.
- Relevant mathematical domains include classical mechanics, orbital mechanics, and applied algebra.
- Concepts involved: Kepler's laws, radial velocity method, mass function in binary stars.
- Applications include astrophysical mass determination, exoplanet detection, and stellar evolution studies.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- Assumption of circular orbits is implied but not explicitly stated.
- Inclination angle is not given but eclipses suggest it is close to 90 degrees; exact value unknown.
- No information on orbital eccentricity or distance units beyond period and velocity.
- Potential challenges include interpreting RV amplitudes without inclination uncertainty and combining period and velocity data to extract total mass.
- The problem assumes the RV amplitudes correspond directly to orbital velocities, which may neglect projection effects if inclination deviates from edge-on.
