1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- The charge distribution is oscillating and spheroidal in shape, with its symmetry axis along the z-axis.
- Radiation occurs at wavelength λ.
- In the radiation zone (far-field), the radiated power per unit solid angle is a function f(λ, θ), where θ is the angle measured from the z-axis.
- The maximum radiated power is denoted by A.
- The problem asks for the fraction of A radiated at θ = 30° and a possible form of f(λ, θ).
- Four choices are given, each pairing a fraction and a λ-dependent power law.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The spheroidal shape and symmetry axis imply an angular dependence of radiation intensity related to θ.
- The function f(λ, θ) represents the angular distribution of radiated power normalized by wavelength.
- The maximum power A serves as a normalization constant for the angular distribution.
- The fraction of A at θ = 30° indicates the relative intensity at that angle compared to the maximum.
- The λ-dependence (e.g., λ^{-4}, λ^{-6}, λ^{-3}) suggests how the power scales with wavelength, possibly reflecting multipole radiation characteristics or size-to-wavelength ratios.
- The constraints imply that f(λ, θ) must be consistent with physical radiation patterns from spheroidal oscillating charges.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem lies primarily in classical electrodynamics, specifically electromagnetic radiation from oscillating charge distributions.
- It involves concepts from radiation theory, antenna theory, and multipole expansions.
- Mathematical subfields include vector calculus and spherical coordinate systems.
- Such problems are common in physics, particularly in advanced electromagnetism courses and research on antenna radiation patterns.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The exact form of the oscillation (e.g., dipole, quadrupole) is not specified, which affects the angular and wavelength dependence.
- The definition of maximum power A (whether it is the absolute maximum over all θ or at a specific angle) is implicit but not explicitly stated.
- The problem does not specify whether the spheroid is prolate or oblate, which could influence angular distribution.
- The functional form f(λ, θ) is not given explicitly, only options are provided, making it ambiguous which physical model applies.
- The relationship between the size of the spheroid and the wavelength λ is not detailed, which is critical for determining the power law dependence on λ.
- Potential complexity arises from the interplay between geometry, oscillation mode, and radiation characteristics.

[{'verifier_name': 'o4-mini', 'evaluation': {'failure_reason': 'The entire chain misidentified the radiation pattern and the location of the maximum. They treated the maximum intensity as occurring along the spheroid’s symmetry axis (θ = 0°) and guessed an angular fraction of 1/2 at 30°, never deriving the true dipole pattern sin²θ.', 'feedback': '1. In Subtask 1 the agents never recognized that an oscillating spheroidal charge behaves as an electric dipole oscillating along z, whose far-field intensity ∝ sin²θ. Instead they repeatedly asserted ‘‘maximum at θ=0’’ and treated the maximum A as on the axis. 2. In Subtasks 2–3 they never derived or suggested g(θ)=sin²θ, so they had no basis to compute f(30°)=sin²30°=¼. They simply regurgitated ‘‘dipole‐like’’ without the actual formula and picked 1/2 arbitrarily. 3. Context was insufficient—no prompt to derive the multipole order or the angular distribution. Agent collaboration never challenged the assumption of ‘‘maximum on axis’’; the Debate groups just echoed the same unsupported conclusion.', 'suggestion': '1. Refine Subtask 1 to explicitly ask: ‘‘Determine which multipole term dominates (dipole, quadrupole, etc.) and write down the standard angular distribution g(θ) for that term.’’ 2. Insert a new Subtask 2: ‘‘Using g(θ) from Subtask 1, compute the ratio g(30°)/g(θₘₐₓ).’’ 3. Then Subtask 3: ‘‘Determine the λ-dependence from the radiation formula of that multipole.’’ 4. Finally Subtask 4: ‘‘Match numerical fraction and λ-power to the provided choices.’’ This forces agents to derive sin²θ and 1/λ⁴ rather than guess, and it reorders the workflow to eliminate the flawed ‘‘maximum on axis’’ assumption.'}}, {'verifier_name': 'gpt-4.1-mini', 'evaluation': {'failure_reason': 'The previous reasoning process failed because it relied on generic assumptions about dipole radiation patterns without properly accounting for the specific geometry and multipole nature of the oscillating spheroidal charge distribution. The key error was in assuming the angular dependence and wavelength scaling matched a simple dipole model, leading to an incorrect choice of fraction and wavelength dependence at θ = 30°. This oversimplification caused the final answer to be inconsistent with the actual physics of the problem as indicated by professor feedback.', 'feedback': '1. The main flaw in the reasoning was the uncritical assumption that the radiation pattern and wavelength dependence follow the standard dipole radiation characteristics (e.g., intensity ∝ λ^{-4} and angular dependence similar to sin^2θ). However, the problem involves a spheroidal charge distribution, which can have higher multipole contributions (quadrupole or beyond), altering both angular and wavelength dependencies significantly.\n\n2. The agents did not sufficiently analyze or clarify the nature of the oscillation mode (dipole vs quadrupole), nor did they consider the size of the spheroid relative to the wavelength, which critically affects the power law dependence on λ.\n\n3. The angular fraction at θ=30° was taken from the given options without deriving or verifying it from the actual radiation pattern expected for a spheroidal oscillating charge. This led to accepting a fraction (1/2) that is typical for dipole radiation at certain angles but may not hold here.\n\n4. The wavelength dependence choices (λ^{-3}, λ^{-4}, λ^{-6}) were not rigorously connected to the physical multipole order or size parameters. For example, quadrupole radiation typically scales differently with wavelength than dipole radiation.\n\n5. The context provided to agents was insufficient to resolve these ambiguities. The problem statement lacked explicit information about the oscillation mode and size-to-wavelength ratio, but the agents did not request or incorporate additional assumptions or clarifications.\n\n6. The collaboration pattern (mostly SC_CoT and Debate) led to consensus on an oversimplified model without critical challenge or deeper physical analysis, causing confirmation bias.\n\n7. The final integration step (Sub-task 4) compounded earlier errors by accepting prior conclusions without re-examination.\n\nIn summary, the failure originated from insufficient physical modeling of the radiation pattern and wavelength dependence for the given spheroidal oscillating charge distribution, combined with inadequate context and insufficient critical evaluation of assumptions in the reasoning chain.', 'suggestion': '1. Refine Sub-task 1 and 2 instructions to explicitly require identification and justification of the oscillation mode (dipole, quadrupole, etc.) and the size-to-wavelength ratio, as these determine angular and wavelength dependencies. Agents should be prompted to consider multiple physical scenarios and rule out inconsistent options.\n\n2. Change the collaboration pattern in Sub-tasks 2 and 3 from Debate or SC_CoT to a stronger Reflexion or Multi-Agent Critique pattern, where agents explicitly challenge assumptions and test the physical consistency of angular and wavelength dependencies before converging on an answer.\n\n3. Improve context flow by passing detailed physical constraints and assumptions identified in Sub-task 1 explicitly into Sub-task 2 and 3, ensuring that wavelength scaling and angular dependence are physically consistent and not just assumed from standard dipole patterns.\n\n4. Consider breaking down Sub-task 4 into two parts: one to rigorously compute or derive the angular fraction at θ=30° from the candidate radiation patterns, and another to match the wavelength dependence based on multipole order and size parameters, before integrating results.\n\nThese steps will enforce deeper physical reasoning, reduce oversimplification, and improve the accuracy of the final answer.'}}]
