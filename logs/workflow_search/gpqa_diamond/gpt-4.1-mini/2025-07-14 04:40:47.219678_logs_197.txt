============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- Total cobalt concentration: c(Co) = 10^-2 M.
- Thiocyanate ion concentration: [SCN^-] = 0.1 M.
- Stability constants (cumulative) for cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes:
  β1 = 9 (for Co(SCN)^+),
  β2 = 40 (for Co(SCN)_2),
  β3 = 63 (for Co(SCN)_3^-),
  β4 = 16 (for Co(SCN)_4^{2-}).
- The species involved are cobalt(II) ions and their complexes with thiocyanate ions, with varying numbers of SCN^- ligands.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The stability constants βn represent cumulative formation constants for complexes with n thiocyanate ligands.
- The total cobalt concentration is distributed among free Co(II) ions and complexes with 1 to 4 SCN^- ligands.
- The concentration of SCN^- is in excess relative to Co(II), influencing the equilibrium distribution of species.
- The problem focuses on the dithiocyanato complex (n=2), asking for its percentage relative to all cobalt-containing species.
- The constraints imply equilibrium conditions governed by the stability constants and mass balance for cobalt and thiocyanate.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem lies in the domain of Analytical Chemistry and Chemical Equilibria.
- It involves concepts from Coordination Chemistry, Equilibrium Calculations, and Chemical Speciation.
- Mathematically, it relates to solving systems of nonlinear equations and applying equilibrium constants.
- Such problems are common in chemical analysis, environmental chemistry, and related fields.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The problem does not specify whether the stability constants are stepwise or cumulative; the notation β suggests cumulative constants, but confirmation would be helpful.
- The charge states of complexes are not explicitly given, though implied by typical coordination chemistry.
- It is not stated whether activity coefficients are considered or if ideal behavior is assumed.
- The problem assumes equilibrium is established and that only these four complexes are significant.
- Potential challenges include handling multiple equilibria and ensuring correct use of stability constants in calculations.

Sum denominator D = 1 + 0.90 + 0.40 + 0.063 + 0.0016 ≈ 2.3646.  \n3. Calculate fractions αn = (βn·Lⁿ)/D:\n   α0 (free Co²⁺) = 1/2.3646 ≈ 0.423 → 42.3%  \n   α1 (Co(SCN)⁺) = 0.90/2.3646 ≈ 0.381 → 38.1%  \n   α2 (Co(SCN)₂) = 0.40/2.3646 ≈ 0.169 → 16.9%  \n   α3 (Co(SCN)₃⁻) = 0.063/2.3646 ≈ 0.0267 → 2.7%  \n   α4 (Co(SCN)₄²⁻) = 0.0016/2.3646 ≈ 0.0007 → 0.07%  \n4. Prioritization: only the first three species contribute meaningfully (>1%), with free Co²⁺ and Co(SCN)⁺ dominating; Co(SCN)₂ is significant but notably smaller; the tri‐ and tetra‐ complexes are negligible.  \nThus the dithiocyanato complex represents ~16.9% of all Co species.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent cIKT:\nTo assess which cobalt(II) thiocyanato species meaningfully contribute at [SCN–]=0.10 M, calculate each fraction αn=βn·L^n/D with L=0.1 M and D=1+β1L+β2L^2+β3L^3+β4L^4. Compute: β1L=9×0.1=0.9; β2L^2=40×0.01=0.4; β3L^3=63×0.001=0.063; β4L^4=16×0.0001=0.0016. Thus D≈2.3646. Fractions: α0(free Co^2+)=1/D≈0.423; α1≈0.381; α2≈0.169; α3≈0.027; α4≈0.0007. The trithiocyanato and tetrathiocyanato species together contribute <3\u2009%, so can be neglected in a first approximation. The dominant species are free Co^2+, mono- and dithiocyanato complexes, with the dithiocyanato Co(SCN)_2 at ≈16.9\u2009%.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent MCBa:\nTo assess which Co(II)–SCN complexes are significant, we calculate the mole fractions (αn) using cumulative constants and [SCN–]=0.1\u2009M:\n1.

Stage_1.subtask_1 gives the equilibrium expressions: [Co(SCN)ₙ] = βₙ·[Co²⁺]·Lⁿ for n=1–4, and the mass‐balance [Co]_tot = [Co²⁺] + ∑_{n=1}^4[Co(SCN)ₙ].\n\n1.
