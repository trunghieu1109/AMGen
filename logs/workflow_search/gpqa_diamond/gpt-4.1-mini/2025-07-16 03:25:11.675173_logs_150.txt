1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- The system state at time t is a column matrix (vector) with elements (-1, 2, 1).
- The observable is represented by a 3x3 matrix operator P with rows:
  First row: (0, 1/√2, 0)
  Second row: (1/√2, 0, 1/√2)
  Third row: (0, 1/√2, 0)
- The problem involves calculating the probability that a measurement of this observable yields the eigenvalue 0 at time t.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The state vector represents the system's state in a 3-dimensional Hilbert space.
- The observable P is a Hermitian operator (implied by the symmetric matrix) acting on this space.
- The probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue corresponds to the squared magnitude of the projection of the state vector onto the eigenspace associated with that eigenvalue.
- The eigenvalue 0 corresponds to one or more eigenvectors of P; the problem implicitly requires finding the projection of the state onto the 0-eigenspace.
- The matrix elements and state vector components are interconnected through linear algebraic operations (e.g., eigen-decomposition, inner products).

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem lies in the domain of linear algebra and quantum mechanics.
- Subfields include quantum theory (state vectors, observables), spectral theory (eigenvalues and eigenvectors), and probability in Hilbert spaces.
- Such problems commonly arise in quantum physics, quantum computing, and mathematical physics, as well as in advanced mathematical competitions.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The problem does not explicitly state whether the state vector is normalized; normalization may be required.
- It is not specified whether the observable matrix is Hermitian, though the symmetry suggests it is.
- The multiplicity of the eigenvalue 0 is not given; the dimension of the 0-eigenspace affects the projection.
- The problem assumes familiarity with quantum measurement postulates and the method to compute measurement probabilities.
- Potential challenges include computing eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P, normalizing the state vector, and projecting onto the correct eigenspace.
