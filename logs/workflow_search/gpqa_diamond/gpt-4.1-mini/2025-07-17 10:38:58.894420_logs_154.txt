1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- Operators \( \vec{P} = (P_x, P_y, P_z) \) are given in matrix form, each a 3x3 matrix.
- \( P_x \) matrix:
  \[
  P_x = \hbar / \sqrt{2} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}
  \]
- \( P_y \) matrix:
  \[
  P_y = \hbar / \sqrt{2} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i & 0 \\ i & 0 & -i \\ 0 & i & 0 \end{pmatrix}
  \]
- \( P_z \) matrix:
  \[
  P_z = \hbar \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix}
  \]
- The basis vectors are eigenvectors of \( P_z \).
- The system is in an eigenstate of \( P_x \) with eigenvalue \( -\hbar \).
- The explicit state vector in the \( P_z \) eigenbasis is given as:
  \[
  \psi = \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{pmatrix}
  \]
- The problem asks for the uncertainty \( \Delta P_z \) in this state.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The operators \( P_x, P_y, P_z \) are represented as Hermitian matrices acting on a 3-dimensional Hilbert space.
- The basis is chosen such that \( P_z \) is diagonal, with eigenvalues \( \hbar, 0, -\hbar \).
- The given state \( \psi \) is an eigenstate of \( P_x \) with eigenvalue \( -\hbar \), expressed in the \( P_z \) eigenbasis.
- The uncertainty \( \Delta P_z \) depends on the expectation values \( \langle P_z \rangle \) and \( \langle P_z^2 \rangle \) in the state \( \psi \).
- The problem involves the interplay between different operator eigenbases and the representation of states.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem lies in quantum mechanics, specifically in the study of quantum operators and their matrix representations.
- Relevant mathematical domains include linear algebra (matrix theory, eigenvalues, eigenvectors), and quantum theory concepts such as observables, eigenstates, and uncertainty.
- This type of problem is common in quantum physics education and mathematical physics.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The problem assumes familiarity with the physical meaning of the operators \( P_x, P_y, P_z \) and their commutation relations, which are not explicitly stated.
- The normalization of the state vector is not explicitly mentioned but can be inferred.
- The problem does not specify whether \( \hbar \) is a constant or symbolic, but it is standard to treat it as Planck's constant divided by \( 2\pi \).
- Potential challenges include careful computation of expectation values and variances in the given basis, and ensuring correct handling of complex conjugates due to the presence of imaginary components in \( P_y \).
- The problem is well-posed but requires attention to the basis and operator representations.
