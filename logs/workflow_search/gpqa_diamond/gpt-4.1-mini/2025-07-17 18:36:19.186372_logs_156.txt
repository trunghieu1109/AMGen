============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- The problem context is an outbreak of a viral infectious disease caused by a retrovirus.
- The goal involves designing a molecular diagnostic kit for quick detection.
- Four choices are given, each describing a sequence of steps:
  * Choice 1: Identify virus via DNA sequencing, then develop a PCR kit.
  * Choice 2: Identify IgG antibodies, then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG.
  * Choice 3: Identify virus based on symptoms, then design a nested PCR kit.
  * Choice 4: Identify virus via cDNA sequencing, then develop a real-time PCR kit.
- Key entities include the virus, viral genetic material (DNA or cDNA), antibodies (IgG), diagnostic methods (PCR, nested PCR, real-time PCR, ELISA).

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- Identification methods vary: direct genetic sequencing (DNA or cDNA), antibody detection, or symptom-based inference.
- Diagnostic kits correspond to identification: PCR-based kits detect viral genetic material; ELISA targets host antibodies.
- Constraints include speed and accuracy of diagnosis.
- The choice of sequencing (DNA vs. cDNA) relates to the retrovirus lifecycle (RNA genome requiring reverse transcription).
- Symptom-based identification is indirect and may affect specificity.
- Nested PCR and real-time PCR are advanced PCR techniques enhancing sensitivity and quantification.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- Relevant domains include molecular biology, virology, and biotechnology.
- Subfields: molecular diagnostics, immunology (antibody detection), nucleic acid amplification techniques.
- Applications: infectious disease diagnostics, public health response, clinical laboratory testing.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The problem does not specify the viral genome type explicitly (RNA or DNA), which affects sequencing choice.
- The reliability of symptom-based identification is ambiguous.
- The timeline and resource constraints for kit development are not stated.
- The sensitivity and specificity requirements for the diagnostic kit are not detailed.
- The choice between antibody detection and direct viral detection is not contextualized (e.g., stage of infection).
- Potential challenges include differentiating between active infection and past exposure (especially for antibody tests) and technical feasibility of sequencing methods.
