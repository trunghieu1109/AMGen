============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- Two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, are considered.
- Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2.
- Star_1 also has a mass 1.5 times that of Star_2.
- Spectroscopy shows both stars have the same peak wavelength of emission.
- Radial velocities: Star_1 has 0 km/s, Star_2 has 700 km/s.
- Both stars are assumed to radiate as black bodies.
- The problem involves comparing the luminosities of the two stars, specifically the factor by which Star_1's luminosity exceeds Star_2's.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The radius and mass ratios provide scaling factors for physical properties.
- Equal peak wavelengths imply equal surface temperatures due to Wien's displacement law.
- Radial velocities indicate relative motion; Star_2's velocity might affect observed properties via Doppler shift, but the problem states peak wavelengths are the same, suggesting Doppler effects are accounted for or negligible.
- Luminosity of a black body star depends on its radius and temperature (L = 4πR²σT⁴).
- Since temperatures are equal (from equal peak wavelengths), luminosity ratio depends primarily on the square of the radius ratio.
- Mass ratio may relate to other stellar properties but is not directly linked to luminosity in the black body radiation formula.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- Astrophysics and stellar physics.
- Concepts from thermodynamics (black body radiation), spectroscopy, and classical mechanics (radial velocity).
- Mathematical subfields include algebra (ratios, proportionality), and physics-based formula application.
- Such problems are common in astrophysics education, research, and physics competitions.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The role of radial velocity in the problem is ambiguous since peak wavelengths are stated equal despite Star_2's high velocity; clarification on whether Doppler shifts are corrected or ignored is needed.
- The significance of the mass ratio in the luminosity comparison is unclear, as mass does not directly enter the black body luminosity formula.
- Assumptions about stellar composition, emissivity, or other factors affecting luminosity are not specified.
- Potential complexity arises if relativistic effects or Doppler shifts are considered, but the problem does not elaborate on these.
