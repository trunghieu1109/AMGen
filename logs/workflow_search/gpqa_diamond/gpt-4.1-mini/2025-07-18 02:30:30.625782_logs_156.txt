[{'objective': 'Identify and characterize the retrovirus by sequencing its genetic material'}, {'objective': 'Select a specific molecular target (e.g., viral DNA, RNA, or cDNA) suitable for detection'}, {'objective': 'Develop a molecular detection assay such as PCR or real-time PCR based on the selected target'}, {'objective': 'Validate the diagnostic kit for sensitivity, specificity, and rapid detection capability'}]
============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- The problem context is an outbreak of a viral infectious disease caused by a retrovirus.
- The goal is to design a molecular diagnostic kit for quick detection.
- Four choices are given, each describing a different approach:
  * Choice 1: Identify virus by DNA sequencing, then develop a PCR kit.
  * Choice 2: Identify IgG antibodies, then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG.
  * Choice 3: Identify virus based on symptoms, then design a nested PCR kit.
  * Choice 4: Identify virus by cDNA sequencing, then develop a real-time PCR kit.
- Key biological entities: virus (retrovirus), viral DNA or cDNA, IgG antibodies.
- Techniques mentioned: DNA sequencing, cDNA sequencing, PCR, nested PCR, real-time PCR, ELISA.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- Identification step precedes diagnostic kit development in all choices.
- DNA or cDNA sequencing relates to direct viral genetic material detection.
- IgG antibody identification relates to host immune response detection.
- PCR-based methods amplify viral genetic material for detection; nested PCR and real-time PCR are variations with different sensitivity and quantification capabilities.
- ELISA targets antibodies, indicating indirect detection via immune response.
- Symptom-based identification (choice 3) relies on clinical data rather than molecular data.
- Constraints include speed and accuracy of diagnosis, influencing choice of molecular technique.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- Primary domain: Molecular biology and biotechnology.
- Subfields: Virology, diagnostic assay development, molecular diagnostics.
- Techniques involve genetics (sequencing), immunology (antibody detection), and molecular amplification methods.
- Applications: Clinical diagnostics, epidemiology, public health response.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The problem does not specify whether the viral genome is RNA or DNA, though retroviruses typically have RNA genomes.
- The choice between DNA sequencing and cDNA sequencing may be ambiguous without specifying viral genome type.
- The timing and stage of infection affect antibody presence; IgG detection may not be suitable for early diagnosis.
- Symptom-based identification is vague and may not be reliable for molecular kit design.
- No information on available resources, sample types, or required sensitivity/specificity.
- Potential challenges include differentiating between direct viral detection and immune response detection, and the appropriateness of each method for rapid diagnosis.
