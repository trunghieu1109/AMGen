============== Task detailed analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- A spherical conductor of radius R, uncharged.
- Inside it, a small spherical cavity of radius r, with r < R.
- The center of the cavity is displaced from the center of the conductor by a distance s.
- A positive charge +q is placed somewhere inside the cavity.
- Point P lies outside the conductor, at distance L from the conductor's center, with L > R.
- The distance from point P to the cavity center is l, with l > R.
- The angle between vectors l (from cavity center to P) and s (from conductor center to cavity center) is θ.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The conductor is uncharged but contains a cavity with a charge inside, implying induced charges on the conductor's inner and outer surfaces.
- The displacement s indicates the cavity is off-center, affecting the symmetry of the problem.
- The distances L and l relate point P to the conductor and cavity centers respectively.
- The angle θ between l and s suggests vector relationships affecting the electric field calculation.
- The problem likely involves superposition of fields and boundary conditions due to the conductor and cavity geometry.
- The given choices for E involve expressions dependent on l, s, θ, and L, indicating different assumptions about the effective distance in Coulomb's law.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem lies in electrostatics, a subfield of classical electromagnetism.
- It involves concepts of conductors, cavities, induced charges, and electric fields.
- Relevant mathematical tools include vector geometry and potential theory.
- Such problems are common in physics education, especially in electromagnetism courses and competitive exams.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The exact position of the charge +q inside the cavity is unspecified; "somewhere inside" is ambiguous.
- The vector definitions of l and s and their directions need precise clarification to interpret the angle θ correctly.
- The problem does not specify whether the charge is fixed or free to move, or if the conductor is grounded.
- The influence of induced charges on the conductor's surface and their effect on the field at P is not explicitly stated.
- The relationship between l, L, and s vectors and their coordinate system is not fully detailed, which may complicate interpretation of the given formulas.
