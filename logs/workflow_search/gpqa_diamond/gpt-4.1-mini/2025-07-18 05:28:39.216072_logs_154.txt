============== Task detailed analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- Operators \( \vec{P} = (P_x, P_y, P_z) \) are given with explicit 3x3 matrix forms.
- \( P_x \) matrix:
  \[ \begin{pmatrix} 0 & \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\ \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}} \\ 0 & \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \end{pmatrix} \]
- \( P_y \) matrix:
  \[ \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\ i \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & -i \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}} \\ 0 & i \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \end{pmatrix} \]
- \( P_z \) matrix:
  \[ \begin{pmatrix} \hbar & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -\hbar \end{pmatrix} \]
- The basis vectors are eigenvectors of \( P_z \).
- The system is in an eigenstate of \( P_x \) with eigenvalue \( -\hbar \).
- The explicit state vector in this basis is given as:
  \[ \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{pmatrix} \]
- The problem asks for the uncertainty \( \Delta P_z \) in this state.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The operators \( P_x, P_y, P_z \) are represented as Hermitian matrices acting on a 3-dimensional Hilbert space.
- The basis is chosen as eigenvectors of \( P_z \), so \( P_z \) is diagonal.
- The given state is an eigenstate of \( P_x \) with eigenvalue \( -\hbar \), expressed in the \( P_z \) eigenbasis.
- The uncertainty \( \Delta P_z \) depends on the expectation values \( \langle P_z \rangle \) and \( \langle P_z^2 \rangle \) in this state.
- The off-diagonal structure of \( P_x \) and \( P_y \) matrices indicates non-commuting observables with \( P_z \), implying nonzero uncertainty.
- The problem structure suggests using the given state vector and \( P_z \) matrix to compute variance.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- Quantum mechanics (quantum operators, observables, eigenstates).
- Linear algebra (matrix representations, eigenvalues, eigenvectors).
- Functional analysis aspects of Hilbert spaces.
- Possibly quantum information or quantum measurement theory.
- Such problems commonly appear in quantum physics courses and competitions.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The problem states the system is in the eigenstate of \( P_x \) with eigenvalue \( -\hbar \), and provides a vector; it is assumed this vector is normalized, but normalization is not explicitly stated.
- The physical interpretation of \( \vec{P} \) is not given; assumed to be angular momentum-like operators due to \( \hbar \) factors.
- The problem does not specify if \( \hbar \) is a constant or symbolic; assumed symbolic.
- No explicit mention of whether the state vector is normalized; this affects expectation value calculations.
- Potential computational complexity in calculating expectation values and variance from given matrices and state vector.
