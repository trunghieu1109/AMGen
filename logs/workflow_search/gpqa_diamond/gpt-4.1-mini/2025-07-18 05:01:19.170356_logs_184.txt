1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- The Hamiltonian operator is given by \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \).
- \( \vec{n} \) is an arbitrary unit vector, i.e., \( |\vec{n}| = 1 \).
- \( \varepsilon \) is a constant with dimensions of energy.
- \( \vec{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z) \) are the Pauli spin matrices, which are 2x2 Hermitian matrices representing spin-1/2 operators.
- The problem provides four multiple-choice options for the eigenvalues of \( H \).

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The Hamiltonian is a dot product of the Pauli vector with a unit vector scaled by \( \varepsilon \), implying it represents a spin-1/2 system in a magnetic field direction \( \vec{n} \) with energy scale \( \varepsilon \).
- Since \( \vec{n} \) is a unit vector, \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) is a Hermitian operator with eigenvalues \( \pm 1 \) because Pauli matrices have eigenvalues \( \pm 1 \).
- Multiplying by \( \varepsilon \) scales these eigenvalues to \( \pm \varepsilon \).
- The presence or absence of \( \hbar/2 \) factors in the choices relates to whether the spin operator is considered as \( \vec{S} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \vec{\sigma} \) or just \( \vec{\sigma} \).
- The problem's structure suggests the eigenvalues correspond to the possible spin projections along \( \vec{n} \).

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem lies in quantum mechanics, specifically quantum spin systems.
- It involves linear algebra (eigenvalues of operators), operator theory, and matrix mechanics.
- The Pauli matrices and spin operators are fundamental in quantum physics and quantum information.
- Such problems are common in quantum mechanics courses, quantum computing, and mathematical physics.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The problem does not explicitly state whether \( \vec{\sigma} \) is used directly or if the spin operator \( \vec{S} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \vec{\sigma} \) is intended, which affects the eigenvalue scaling.
- The dimension and units of \( \varepsilon \) are given as energy, but the role of \( \hbar \) in the eigenvalues is ambiguous.
- The problem assumes familiarity with the properties of Pauli matrices and their eigenvalues.
- No explicit mention of the Hilbert space dimension or basis is given, though it is implied to be spin-1/2.
- Potential confusion arises from the multiple-choice options mixing factors of \( \hbar/2 \) and pure numerical values.
