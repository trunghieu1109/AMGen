[{'objective': 'Analyze the reaction mechanism of ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene with hydrogen bromide to predict possible product types'}, {'objective': 'Determine the structural changes and possible rearrangements or ring formations resulting from the reaction'}, {'objective': 'Identify the plausible product structures consistent with the reaction conditions and TLC observations'}, {'objective': 'Compare the predicted product structures with the given multiple-choice options to select the correct products'}]
