['Analyze and Classify Elements: Analyze an input entity or dataset to identify, isolate, and characterize its essential components, attributes, and relationships that define its fundamental structure or nature.', 'Select, Evaluate, Transform, and Extract Variants: Evaluate a collection of elements against defined criteria to identify, select, and prioritize those that satisfy or best meet the specified conditions.', 'Apply Transformation: Apply one or more defined operations to one or multiple inputs to generate one or more outputs, which may be sequentially ordered or combined into a composite result.', 'Evaluate Conformity and Validity: Evaluate and verify whether given elements, relationships, or assertions conform to defined criteria or consistency requirements to determine their validity, coherence, or significance.']
