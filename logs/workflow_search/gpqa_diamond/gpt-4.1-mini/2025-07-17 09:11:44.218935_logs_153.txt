1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- Mass spectrometry data: molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 (100% intensity), and a peak at m/z = 158 (32% intensity), indicating a molecular weight of 156 with an isotopic pattern consistent with the presence of chlorine (due to the M+2 peak).
- IR spectrum: broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1, characteristic of O-H stretching (likely carboxylic acid), and a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1, typical of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid or aldehyde.
- 1H NMR data: singlet at 11.0 ppm (1H), likely a carboxylic acid proton; two doublets at 8.02 ppm (2H) and 7.72 ppm (2H), suggesting an aromatic ring with symmetrical substitution causing two sets of equivalent protons.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The molecular ion peak and isotopic pattern suggest the compound contains chlorine.
- The broad IR peak and the singlet at 11.0 ppm in NMR indicate the presence of a carboxylic acid group.
- The two doublets integrating to 2H each imply a para-substituted benzene ring.
- The strong carbonyl peak at 1720 cm^-1 supports the presence of a carboxylic acid rather than an aldehyde or ester.
- These observations constrain the structure to a para-substituted chlorobenzoic acid.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem lies in the domain of organic chemistry, specifically analytical chemistry and spectroscopy.
- Subfields involved include mass spectrometry, infrared spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
- Such problems are common in chemical structure elucidation, pharmaceutical analysis, and forensic chemistry.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The exact position of the chlorine substituent on the benzene ring is not explicitly stated and must be inferred.
- The NMR splitting pattern suggests symmetry, but without coupling constants or integration details beyond the given, some ambiguity remains.
- The IR data is broad and may overlap with other functional groups; confirmation of the acid group relies on interpretation.
- The choice of options includes compounds with different substitution patterns and functional groups, which may require more detailed spectral data to distinguish conclusively.
