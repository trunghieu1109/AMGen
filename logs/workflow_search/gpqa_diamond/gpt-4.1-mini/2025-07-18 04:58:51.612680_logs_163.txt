============== Task detailed analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- Two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2.
- Orbital periods (time between consecutive primary eclipses): system_1 has 2 years, system_2 has 1 year.
- Radial velocity (RV) sinusoidal amplitude observations:
  * system_1: 10 km/s and 5 km/s for the two stars.
  * system_2: 15 km/s and 10 km/s for the two stars.
- The mass of each system is defined as the sum of the masses of its two stars.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The orbital period relates to the total mass of the binary system via Kepler's third law.
- Radial velocity amplitudes correspond to the orbital velocities of each star around the center of mass, which depend on the mass ratio and orbital parameters.
- The ratio of the RV amplitudes inversely relates to the mass ratio of the two stars in each system.
- The periods and RV amplitudes together provide information to estimate the total mass of each system.
- The eclipsing nature implies the orbital plane is close to edge-on, simplifying interpretation of RV amplitudes as true orbital velocities.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- Astrophysics, specifically stellar dynamics and binary star systems.
- Celestial mechanics and orbital dynamics.
- Application of Keplerian motion and Doppler spectroscopy.
- Relevant to observational astronomy and astrophysical data analysis.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The inclination angle is not explicitly stated but is likely assumed to be near 90Â° due to eclipses.
- The eccentricity of orbits is not mentioned; assumed circular or negligible for sinusoidal RV curves.
- The exact method to combine RV amplitudes and periods to find total mass is not detailed.
- Potential uncertainties in measurements or assumptions about stellar masses and orbital parameters are not provided.
- The problem does not specify if systemic velocities or other effects are considered.
