============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- Two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2.
- Orbital periods (time between consecutive primary eclipses): system_1 has 2 years, system_2 has 1 year.
- Radial velocity (RV) sinusoidal amplitude observations:
  * system_1: 10 km/s and 5 km/s for the two stars.
  * system_2: 15 km/s and 10 km/s for the two stars.
- The mass of each system is defined as the sum of the masses of its two stars.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The orbital period relates to the total mass of the binary system via Kepler's third law.
- Radial velocity amplitudes correspond to the orbital velocities of each star around the center of mass, which depend on the masses and orbital parameters.
- The ratio of radial velocity amplitudes inversely relates to the mass ratio of the two stars in each system.
- The periods and velocity amplitudes together provide constraints to estimate the total mass of each system.
- The eclipsing nature implies the orbital plane is close to edge-on, simplifying interpretation of radial velocities as true orbital velocities.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- Astrophysics, specifically stellar dynamics and binary star systems.
- Subfields include orbital mechanics, observational astronomy, and spectroscopic analysis.
- Related mathematical domains include classical mechanics, trigonometry, and algebra.
- Applications include mass determination of stars, exoplanet detection, and stellar evolution studies.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- Assumption that orbital inclination is 90 degrees (edge-on) is implicit but not stated.
- No explicit mention of eccentricity; likely assumed circular orbits for sinusoidal RV curves.
- The exact method to combine RV amplitudes and periods to find total mass is not detailed.
- Potential challenges include interpreting the RV amplitudes correctly and relating them to masses without additional orbital parameters.
