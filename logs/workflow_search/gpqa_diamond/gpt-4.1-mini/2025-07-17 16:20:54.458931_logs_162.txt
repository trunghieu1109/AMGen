============== Task detailed analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- Mass of Fe(OH)3: 0.1 g
- Total solution volume: 100 cm³
- Temperature: 25°C
- Acid: monobasic strong acid, concentration 0.1 M
- Unknowns to find: minimum volume of acid (cm³) needed to dissolve Fe(OH)3, and pH of the resulting solution
- Multiple-choice options provide paired values of pH and acid volume.

Properties:
- Fe(OH)3 is a sparingly soluble hydroxide of iron(III).
- The acid is strong and monobasic, implying complete dissociation and one proton per acid molecule.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- Dissolution of Fe(OH)3 requires neutralization of hydroxide ions by H+ from the acid.
- The amount of acid needed depends on the stoichiometry of the neutralization reaction and solubility equilibrium.
- The total volume constraint (100 cm³) implies that the acid volume plus water and dissolved species sum to this volume.
- pH depends on the concentration of free H+ ions after dissolution and neutralization.
- The minimum acid volume corresponds to the stoichiometric amount just sufficient to dissolve all Fe(OH)3.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- Chemistry, specifically analytical and physical chemistry.
- Subfields: acid-base equilibria, solubility equilibria, solution chemistry.
- Applications: chemical preparation, titration, solution formulation.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The exact dissolution reaction and equilibrium constants (e.g., Ksp of Fe(OH)3) are not provided.
- Whether the volume of acid added is included in the total 100 cm³ or added to it is not explicitly stated.
- The nature of the acid (identity) is unspecified beyond being monobasic and strong.
- Potential assumptions about activity coefficients, ionic strength, or temperature effects are not detailed.
- The problem may involve complex equilibria or approximations that are not explicitly mentioned.
