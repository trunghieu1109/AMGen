1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- A spherical conductor of radius R, uncharged.
- Inside it, a small spherical cavity of radius r, with r < R.
- The center of the cavity is displaced from the center of the conductor by a distance s.
- A positive charge +q is placed somewhere inside the cavity.
- Point P lies outside the conductor, at a distance L from the conductor's center, with L > R.
- The distance from point P to the cavity center is l, with l > R.
- The angle between vectors l (from cavity center to P) and s (from conductor center to cavity center) is θ.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The conductor is uncharged but contains a cavity with a charge inside, implying induced charges on the conductor's inner and outer surfaces.
- The displacement s introduces asymmetry; the cavity is not concentric with the conductor.
- The distances L and l relate point P to the conductor center and cavity center, respectively.
- The angle θ between l and s affects the relative positioning of P with respect to the cavity and conductor.
- The problem likely involves electrostatic shielding and induced charge distributions, affecting the external field.
- The given choices for E involve expressions with q and distances l, L, and terms involving s and cosθ, indicating geometric dependencies.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- Electrostatics within classical electromagnetism.
- Concepts include conductors, cavities, induced charges, and electric fields.
- Subfields: electrostatics, boundary value problems, potential theory.
- Applications: physics (electrostatics), electrical engineering, and mathematical physics.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The exact position of the charge +q inside the cavity is unspecified ("somewhere inside"), which may affect the field.
- The vector directions and definitions of l and s need precise clarification (e.g., are l and s vectors or magnitudes? The angle θ is between them, but their vector nature is implicit).
- The problem does not specify whether the conductor is grounded or isolated, which influences induced charges.
- The effect of the cavity's displacement on the external field is subtle and may require assumptions.
- The problem assumes l, L > R, but the relation between l, L, and s is not fully detailed, possibly leading to multiple configurations.
