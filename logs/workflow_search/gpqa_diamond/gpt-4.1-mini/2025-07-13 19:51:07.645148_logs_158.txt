============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- Observations pertain to a quasar's electromagnetic spectrum, focusing on near-infrared and optical wavelengths.
- A spectral peak is observed at approximately 790 nm.
- Flux decreases significantly at wavelengths shorter than 790 nm.
- Cosmological model parameters are specified: Hubble constant H_0 = 70 km s^-1 Mpc^-1, matter density parameter Ω_m = 0.3, dark energy density parameter Ω_Λ = 0.7, and a flat universe (Ω_k = 0).
- The scale factor a is given as 1, indicating the present epoch.
- Multiple choice options for the comoving distance to the quasar are provided: 6, 7, 8, or 9 Gpc.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The observed wavelength peak at 790 nm likely corresponds to a redshifted emission or absorption feature intrinsic to the quasar.
- The drop in flux at wavelengths shorter than 790 nm suggests absorption or a cutoff related to the quasar's rest-frame spectrum shifted by cosmic expansion.
- The cosmological parameters define the expansion history of the universe, which determines the relationship between redshift and comoving distance.
- The flat Lambda-CDM model with given Ω_m and Ω_Λ allows calculation of comoving distance as a function of redshift.
- The observed wavelength can be related to the rest-frame wavelength via redshift z = (λ_observed / λ_rest) - 1.
- Thus, the spectral data combined with cosmological parameters constrain the quasar's redshift, which in turn determines its comoving distance.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem lies primarily in cosmology and astrophysics.
- It involves observational astronomy (spectroscopy), cosmological distance measures, and the Lambda-CDM model.
- Subfields include extragalactic astronomy, cosmological redshift-distance relations, and spectral analysis.
- Such problems are common in astrophysical research, cosmological parameter estimation, and educational contexts like physics or astronomy competitions.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The rest-frame wavelength corresponding to the observed 790 nm peak is not specified, making direct redshift calculation ambiguous.
- The nature of the spectral feature causing the flux drop at shorter wavelengths is not detailed (e.g., Lyman-alpha break, dust absorption).
- It is unclear whether the peak at 790 nm is an emission line, absorption line, or continuum feature.
- The problem assumes knowledge of how to relate observed wavelength features to redshift and then to comoving distance, which may require additional assumptions.
- Potential challenges include interpreting the spectral data without explicit rest-frame references and performing cosmological integrals to find comoving distance.
