============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- Two reactions are performed:
  * Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene treated with one equivalent of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.
  * Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene treated similarly.
- Both reactions proceed to 100% completion.
- Products from both reactions are combined and analyzed by two types of HPLC columns:
  * Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column.
  * Chiral HPLC column.
- The chromatographic resolution is assumed to be ideal (theoretically maximal).

- Key chemical entities:
  * (E)- and (Z)-oct-4-ene: geometric isomers differing in alkene stereochemistry.
  * mCPBA: a peracid used for epoxidation, typically stereospecific.
  * Epoxides formed from these alkenes, which may be stereoisomeric.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The (E)- and (Z)-alkenes will each form epoxides with distinct stereochemistry due to the stereospecific nature of mCPBA epoxidation.
- Each alkene stereoisomer likely yields a pair of enantiomeric epoxides (depending on the symmetry and substitution pattern), or possibly diastereomers.
- Combining products from both reactions results in a mixture of stereoisomers.
- On an achiral HPLC column, enantiomers co-elute (no resolution), but diastereomers can be separated.
- On a chiral HPLC column, enantiomers can be resolved, increasing the number of observable peaks.
- The constraints imply that the number of peaks corresponds to the number of distinct stereoisomers separable under each chromatographic condition.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- Organic Chemistry: specifically stereochemistry and reaction mechanisms.
- Analytical Chemistry: chromatographic separation techniques, including chiral and achiral HPLC.
- Stereochemistry concepts: enantiomers, diastereomers, stereospecific reactions.
- Applications: chemical synthesis, stereochemical analysis, pharmaceutical purity assessment.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The exact stereochemical outcome of each epoxidation (number and nature of stereoisomers formed) is not explicitly stated.
- Whether the epoxidation leads to racemic mixtures or single stereoisomers per alkene is assumed but not detailed.
- The influence of aqueous acid treatment on stereochemistry or product stability is not elaborated.
- The problem assumes ideal chromatographic resolution, which may not reflect practical limitations.
- Potential complexity arises if multiple stereoisomers overlap in retention times or if epoxide ring opening occurs under acidic conditions.
