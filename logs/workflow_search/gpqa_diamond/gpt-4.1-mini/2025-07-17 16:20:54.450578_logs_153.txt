============== Task detailed analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- Molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 with 100% intensity, indicating the molecular weight of the compound is 156.
- A secondary peak at m/z = 158 with 32% intensity, suggesting the presence of an isotope, likely chlorine (due to the characteristic 3:1 ratio for 35Cl and 37Cl isotopes).
- IR spectrum shows a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1, typical of O-H stretching vibrations, possibly from a carboxylic acid group.
- A strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1, characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, likely from an aldehyde or carboxylic acid.
- 1H NMR signals: a singlet at 11.0 ppm (1H), consistent with a carboxylic acid proton; two doublets at 8.02 ppm (2H) and 7.72 ppm (2H), indicating aromatic protons in a para-substituted benzene ring.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The molecular ion and isotope pattern suggest the compound contains one chlorine atom.
- The broad IR peak and 11.0 ppm singlet in NMR strongly indicate a carboxylic acid functional group.
- The sharp IR peak at 1720 cm^-1 supports the presence of a carbonyl group.
- The aromatic proton splitting pattern (two doublets each integrating to 2H) suggests a symmetrical para-substituted benzene ring.
- The isotope pattern and aromatic substitution pattern together imply the chlorine is para to the carboxylic acid group.
- These constraints narrow down the structure to a para-chlorobenzoic acid derivative.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- Organic Chemistry, specifically structure elucidation using spectroscopic techniques.
- Subfields include analytical chemistry, spectroscopy (mass spectrometry, IR, NMR).
- Applications include drug identification, forensic analysis, and chemical research.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The exact nature of the 'liquid' mentioned is ambiguous since the sample is described as a white solid.
- The NMR data only lists three signals; more detailed splitting or integration data could clarify substitution patterns.
- The IR broad peak range is wide; confirmation of hydrogen bonding or acid dimerization is not explicit.
- The presence or absence of other functional groups is not detailed.
- The problem does not specify solvent or conditions for NMR, which can affect chemical shifts.
- Potential challenges include distinguishing between positional isomers (ortho-, meta-, para-) based solely on the given data.
