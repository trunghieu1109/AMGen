[{'objective': 'Calculate the orbital semi-major axes of Planet_1 and Planet_2 using their orbital periods and host star masses.'}, {'objective': 'Determine the transit probability for each planet using the ratio of the host star radius to the orbital semi-major axis.'}, {'objective': 'Compare the transit probabilities of Planet_1 and Planet_2 to identify which has the higher probability.'}, {'objective': 'Select the planet with the higher transit probability as the preferred target for observation.'}]
