[{'objective': 'Identify and characterize the retrovirus by sequencing its genetic material'}, {'objective': 'Select a specific molecular target (e.g., viral DNA, RNA, or cDNA) suitable for detection'}, {'objective': 'Develop a molecular detection method such as PCR or real-time PCR based on the selected target'}, {'objective': 'Validate and optimize the diagnostic kit for rapid and accurate detection in clinical samples'}]
============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- The problem context is an outbreak of a viral infectious disease caused by a retrovirus in a city.
- The goal is to design a molecular diagnostic kit for quick detection.
- Four choices describe different diagnostic approaches involving DNA sequencing, cDNA sequencing, PCR, nested PCR, ELISA, and antibody detection (IgG).
- Key terms include DNA sequencing, cDNA sequencing, PCR (polymerase chain reaction), nested PCR, real-time PCR, ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), and IgG antibodies.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The virus identification methods vary: direct sequencing (DNA or cDNA), symptom-based identification, or antibody detection.
- PCR-based methods rely on nucleic acid amplification for detecting viral genetic material.
- ELISA targets host immune response (IgG antibodies) rather than the virus itself.
- Nested PCR and real-time PCR are specialized PCR techniques enhancing sensitivity or quantification.
- The choice of method influences speed, accuracy, and type of diagnostic information (viral presence vs. immune response).

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem lies primarily in molecular biology and biotechnology.
- Subfields include virology, molecular diagnostics, immunology, and genetic sequencing.
- Techniques mentioned are common in clinical diagnostics, epidemiology, and biomedical research.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The problem does not specify whether the virus is RNA or DNA-based, which affects sequencing and detection methods.
- The role of symptoms in virus identification (choice 3) is vague and may lack molecular specificity.
- The timing of antibody production (IgG) relative to infection onset is not addressed, which impacts ELISA effectiveness.
- The problem does not clarify resource availability, required sensitivity, or turnaround time constraints.
- Potential challenges include choosing between detecting viral genetic material versus host antibodies and selecting appropriate sequencing methods.
