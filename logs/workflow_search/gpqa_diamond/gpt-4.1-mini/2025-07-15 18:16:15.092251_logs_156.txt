['Analyze and Classify Elements: Analyze an input entity or dataset to identify, isolate, and characterize its essential components, attributes, and relationships that define its fundamental structure or nature.', 'Select and Compute Measures by Criteria: Evaluate a collection of elements against defined criteria to identify, select, and prioritize those that satisfy or best meet the specified conditions.', 'Apply Transformation: Apply one or more defined operations to one or multiple inputs to generate one or more outputs, which may be sequentially ordered or combined into a composite result.', 'Evaluate Conformity and Validity: Evaluate conformity and validity of outputs by assessing performance measures such as accuracy, reliability, and efficiency under specified conditions.']
