1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- The system's state at time t is given by the column vector \( \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \).
- Two observables, P and Q, are represented by 3x3 matrices.
- Operator P's matrix elements are:
  \[ P = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \end{pmatrix} \]
- Operator Q's matrix elements are:
  \[ Q = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix} \]
- The problem involves sequential measurements: first measuring P and obtaining the eigenvalue 0, then measuring Q and obtaining the eigenvalue -1.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The state vector represents the system's initial condition in a 3-dimensional Hilbert space.
- Operators P and Q are Hermitian matrices representing observables with eigenvalues corresponding to possible measurement outcomes.
- The measurement of P yielding 0 implies projecting the state onto the eigenspace of P associated with eigenvalue 0.
- After this projection (state collapse), the measurement of Q yielding -1 involves projecting onto the eigenspace of Q with eigenvalue -1.
- The probability of these sequential outcomes depends on the overlaps between the initial state and the eigenvectors of P and Q, and the post-measurement state after measuring P.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem lies in the domain of quantum mechanics, specifically quantum measurement theory.
- Mathematically, it involves linear algebra (eigenvalues, eigenvectors, projections), and concepts from functional analysis related to operators on Hilbert spaces.
- Such problems are common in quantum physics, quantum information theory, and mathematical physics.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The state vector is given but not normalized; normalization is typically required for probability calculations.
- The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P and Q are not explicitly provided; these must be determined to analyze measurement outcomes.
- The problem assumes standard quantum measurement postulates but does not specify if the operators commute or if the measurements disturb the system.
- The exact procedure for sequential measurement (order, collapse postulate) is implied but not detailed.
- Potential complexity arises in computing projections and probabilities without explicit eigen-decompositions.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The state vector represents the system's initial condition in a 3-dimensional Hilbert space.
- Operators P and Q are Hermitian matrices representing observables with eigenvalues corresponding to possible measurement outcomes.
- The eigenvalues of P include 0 (since the question references measuring 0 for P), and Q has eigenvalues 1, 0, and -1.
- Measuring P collapses the state onto the eigenspace corresponding to eigenvalue 0.
- The subsequent measurement of Q is performed on the post-measurement state from P's measurement.
- The probability of obtaining specific measurement outcomes depends on projections of the state vector onto the relevant eigenspaces.

3. Identify the Field of Study:

- Concepts include state vectors, Hermitian operators, eigen-decomposition, and sequential measurement postulates.
- Such problems are common in quantum physics, quantum computing, and mathematical physics.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The state vector is given but not normalized; normalization status is unclear and may affect probability calculations.
- The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P are not explicitly provided; identifying the eigenspace for eigenvalue 0 requires computation.
- The order and nature of measurements imply state collapse, but the exact post-measurement state depends on the projection operator, which is not detailed.
- The problem assumes standard quantum measurement postulates but does not specify if the operators commute or if degeneracies exist.
- Potential complexity arises in computing projections and normalizations for sequential measurements.
