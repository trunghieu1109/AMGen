[{'objective': 'Calculate the energy uncertainty (Î”E) for each quantum state using their respective lifetimes via the energy-time uncertainty principle.'}, {'objective': 'Determine the minimum energy difference required to resolve the two energy levels based on their energy uncertainties.'}, {'objective': 'Compare the given energy difference options with the calculated minimum energy difference to identify which option allows clear resolution.'}]
