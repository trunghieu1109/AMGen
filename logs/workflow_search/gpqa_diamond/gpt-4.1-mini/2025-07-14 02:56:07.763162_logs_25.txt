[{'objective': 'Identify the correct reactant A that reacts with cyclohexene to form the specified product.'}, {'objective': 'Analyze the structural features of the given dienes to assess their relative reactivity.'}, {'objective': 'Rank the given dienes in order of their reactivity from most reactive to least reactive.'}, {'objective': 'Match the identified reactant A and the reactivity sequence of dienes to the provided answer choices.'}]
