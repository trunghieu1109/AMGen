1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- Six substances are given, each a benzene ring (C6H5) with a different substituent:
  1) C6H5-CH3 (toluene)
  2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (ethyl benzoate)
  3) C6H5-Cl (chlorobenzene)
  4) C6H5-NO2 (nitrobenzene)
  5) C6H5-C2H5 (ethylbenzene)
  6) C6H5-COOH (benzoic acid)
- Each undergoes electrophilic substitution with excess bromine, yielding only one monobromo derivative.
- The problem focuses on the weight fraction of the para-isomer formed in each case.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The substituents influence the electrophilic substitution pattern via their electronic effects:
  - Activating groups (e.g., CH3, C2H5) generally direct substitution to ortho and para positions.
  - Deactivating groups (e.g., NO2, COOH, COOC2H5) often direct substitution meta or influence para yield differently.
  - Halogens (Cl) are deactivating but ortho/para directing.
- The weight fraction of the para-isomer depends on the relative amounts of ortho and para substitution, which is influenced by steric and electronic factors.
- The problem implicitly requires understanding how substituent effects modulate regioselectivity and yield distribution.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- Organic Chemistry, specifically aromatic electrophilic substitution reactions.
- Concepts involved include substituent effects, directing effects, regioselectivity, and reaction mechanisms.
- Relevant in chemical synthesis, pharmaceuticals, and materials science.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The problem assumes only one monobromo derivative forms, which may oversimplify real mixtures where ortho and para isomers coexist.
- The exact conditions of the reaction (solvent, temperature) are not specified, which can affect regioselectivity.
- The term "weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer" could be ambiguous without specifying whether it refers to isolated yield, ratio in mixture, or theoretical distribution.
- Potential challenges include interpreting substituent effects quantitatively and comparing yields across different substituents with varying steric and electronic properties.

- Reaction: electrophilic substitution with excess bromine, yielding only one monobromo derivative per substance.
- Task: arrange substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The substituents on the benzene ring influence the regioselectivity of electrophilic substitution via their electronic effects (electron-donating or withdrawing) and steric effects.
- Electron-donating groups (e.g., CH3, C2H5) are generally ortho/para directing, increasing para-isomer yield.
- Electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., NO2, COOH, COOC2H5) are generally meta directing, reducing para-isomer yield.
- Halogens (e.g., Cl) are deactivating but ortho/para directing.
- The weight fraction of the para-isomer depends on the relative stability and steric hindrance of ortho vs para substitution.
- The problem assumes only one monobromo derivative forms, implying the distribution is dominated by one isomer, likely para.

- Organic Chemistry, specifically aromatic electrophilic substitution reactions.
- Concepts involved include substituent effects on aromatic rings, directing effects, regioselectivity.
- Relevant in chemical synthesis, pharmaceuticals, and materials science.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The problem states only one monobromo derivative forms, which is an idealization; in practice, mixtures occur.
- The exact conditions of the reaction (solvent, temperature) are not specified, which can affect isomer distribution.
- The term "weight fraction of the para-isomer" assumes knowledge of relative yields or selectivities, which are not provided.
- Potential challenge: interpreting the relative directing strengths quantitatively without experimental data.
