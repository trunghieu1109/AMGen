============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- Two reactions are performed:
  * Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene treated with one equivalent of mCPBA, then aqueous acid.
  * Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene treated similarly.
- Both reactions proceed to 100% completion.
- Products from both reactions are combined.
- The combined mixture is analyzed by two chromatographic methods:
  * Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column.
  * Chiral HPLC column.
- The chromatographic resolution is assumed to be as high as theoretically possible.

- The chemical entities involved are (E)- and (Z)-oct-4-ene, which are geometric isomers (alkenes differing in stereochemistry around the double bond).
- mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid) is an oxidizing agent commonly used for epoxidation of alkenes.
- Aqueous acid treatment following epoxidation typically opens the epoxide ring, potentially leading to diols or other stereoisomeric products.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The starting materials differ only in alkene geometry (E vs. Z), which affects the stereochemistry of the epoxide formed.
- Epoxidation of (E)- and (Z)-alkenes typically yields stereoisomeric epoxides (cis vs. trans epoxides).
- Subsequent acid-catalyzed ring opening can generate diastereomeric diols with distinct stereochemistry.
- Combining products from both reactions results in a mixture of stereoisomers.
- Achiral HPLC separates compounds based on physical properties like polarity but cannot distinguish enantiomers.
- Chiral HPLC can separate enantiomers due to chiral interactions.
- The number of peaks observed depends on the number of stereoisomers present and whether they are enantiomers or diastereomers.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- Organic Chemistry, specifically stereochemistry and reaction mechanisms.
- Analytical Chemistry, focusing on chromatographic separation techniques.
- Concepts involved include stereoisomerism (E/Z isomerism, enantiomers, diastereomers), epoxidation reactions, and chromatographic resolution.
- Applications include stereochemical analysis in synthetic chemistry, pharmaceutical development, and analytical method development.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The exact stereochemical outcome of the acid-catalyzed epoxide ring opening is not specified (e.g., regioselectivity, stereoselectivity).
- The nature of the products (epoxides, diols, or other) after aqueous acid treatment is not explicitly stated.
- Whether the products from each reaction are enantiomeric or diastereomeric relative to each other is not detailed.
- The problem assumes ideal chromatographic resolution, but real-world factors affecting separation are not discussed.
- Potential complexity arises from multiple stereocenters formed during ring opening, which may increase the number of stereoisomers.
- The question does not specify if the starting alkenes are pure or if any isomerization occurs during reaction.

Please think carefully and provide an updated answer. \n\n ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent f1we:\nIn Reaction 1, (E)-oct-4-ene undergoes epoxidation with mCPBA, leading to the formation of a trans-epoxide. Upon treatment with aqueous acid, this epoxide ring opens to yield a diol that retains the stereochemistry from the original alkene. In Reaction 2, (Z)-oct-4-ene is also epoxidized by mCPBA, resulting in a cis-epoxide. The subsequent acid treatment leads to a different diol product compared to the first reaction due to the stereochemistry of the starting alkene. Thus, from Reaction 1, we have one diol product, and from Reaction 2, we have a different diol product, which are diastereomers of each other. The combination of these products will yield two distinct diols that are not enantiomers but diastereomers. When analyzed by standard (achiral) HPLC, only the two distinct diols will be separated, resulting in 2 peaks. However, when analyzed by chiral HPLC, the diastereomers can be resolved into 3 peaks: one for each diastereomer and one peak for any potential enantiomeric product if present. Therefore, the expected outcome is 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent SPDt:\nIn Reaction 1, (E)-oct-4-ene undergoes epoxidation with mCPBA, leading to the formation of a trans-epoxide. Upon treatment with aqueous acid, the epoxide ring opens to yield a diol with specific stereochemistry. In Reaction 2, (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated similarly, yielding a cis-epoxide, which upon acid treatment gives a different diol with distinct stereochemistry. The products of both reactions are diastereomers and can be resolved into distinct peaks. The standard HPLC will show fewer peaks as it cannot distinguish between diastereomers, while the chiral HPLC will show more peaks due to its ability to separate enantiomeric forms. Therefore, we can expect 3 peaks in the standard HPLC and 4 peaks in the chiral HPLC due to the presence of diastereomers and potential enantiomers formed from the reactions. This leads to the conclusion that the correct answer is choice B.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent 07by:\nIn the reactions involving (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid, the epoxidation will lead to the formation of epoxides. The (E)-isomer will yield a trans-epoxide, while the (Z)-isomer will yield a cis-epoxide due to the stereochemistry of the double bond. When the epoxides are treated with aqueous acid, the epoxide ring opens to form diols. The (E)-oct-4-ene will produce one type of diol, while the (Z)-oct-4-ene will produce a different diol, leading to two distinct diastereomers from each reaction. Thus, the products from each reaction are not enantiomers of each other but diastereomers due to their different spatial arrangements. Therefore, when the products are combined, we will have a total of four distinct products: two diastereomers from (E)-oct-4-ene and two diastereomers from (Z)-oct-4-ene. In a standard (achiral) HPLC, these four products will be indistinguishable based on chirality, resulting in 2 peaks (as diastereomers can co-elute). However, in a chiral HPLC, the distinct stereochemical nature of the diastereomers will allow for separation, resulting in 4 peaks. Thus, the chemist will observe 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent h9Nz:\nIn the first reaction, (E)-oct-4-ene undergoes epoxidation with mCPBA, resulting in the formation of a trans-epoxide. When this epoxide is treated with aqueous acid, the ring opens to produce a diol, which has two stereocenters due to the addition of water across the double bond. This results in a pair of diastereomers. In the second reaction, (Z)-oct-4-ene also undergoes epoxidation with mCPBA, yielding a cis-epoxide. The subsequent acid treatment will similarly open the ring and lead to another pair of diastereomers. Since the products from both reactions (from (E)- and (Z)-oct-4-ene) are diastereomers of each other, we can expect a total of four distinct compounds when combining the two reaction products. In an achiral HPLC, these four compounds will be resolved into four peaks, as it cannot distinguish between diastereomers.

However, in a chiral HPLC, the two pairs of diastereomers will be resolved into four peaks as well, since it can differentiate between the stereochemical configurations. Thus, both chromatograms will show four distinct peaks. Therefore, the correct observation would be four peaks in both the standard and chiral HPLC columns.\n\n### answer #1 by Debate Agent f1we:\nC\n\n### answer #1 by Debate Agent SPDt:\nB\n\n### answer #1 by Debate Agent 07by:\nB\n\n### answer #1 by Debate Agent h9Nz:\nA\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: stage_0.subtask_1: Given all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer. \n\n then justify completely and detailedly, step-by-step why you think so in the "thinking" entry. \n                Consider all cases that are possible to happen.\n                Avoid some unclear explainations, such as "Using the circle equation or the condition for four points to be concyclic, we derive an equation in x.

The (E)-oct-4-ene will produce one type of diol (let\'s call it diol 1), while the (Z)-oct-4-ene will produce a different diol (diol 2). Hence, we have two distinct diastereomers from the (E)-isomer and two distinct diastereomers from the (Z)-isomer, leading to a total of four distinct products: diol 1A, diol 1B (from (E)-oct-4-ene) and diol 2A, diol 2B (from (Z)-oct-4-ene). In a standard (achiral) HPLC, these products will co-elute as they are diastereomers, resulting in only 2 peaks. However, in a chiral HPLC, the distinct stereochemical nature of these diastereomers will allow for their separation, leading to 4 peaks. Therefore, the chemist will observe 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC.

The (E)-isomer will yield a trans-epoxide, while the (Z)-isomer will yield a cis-epoxide due to the stereochemistry of the double bond. Upon treatment with aqueous acid, the epoxide ring opens to form diols. The (E)-oct-4-ene will produce one type of diol, while the (Z)-oct-4-ene will produce a different diol, leading to two distinct diastereomers from each reaction. Therefore, when the products are combined, we will have a total of four distinct products: two diastereomers from (E)-oct-4-ene and two diastereomers from (Z)-oct-4-ene. In a standard (achiral) HPLC, these four products will be indistinguishable based on chirality, resulting in 2 peaks (as diastereomers can co-elute).

The (E)-isomer will yield a trans-epoxide, while the (Z)-isomer will yield a cis-epoxide due to the geometric configuration around the double bond. When treated with aqueous acid, the epoxide ring opens, converting them into diols. Each isomer produces a different type of diol, leading to two distinct diastereomers from (E)-oct-4-ene and two distinct diastereomers from (Z)-oct-4-ene. Thus, when combining the products from both reactions, we will have a total of four distinct products: 2 diastereomers from (E)-oct-4-ene and 2 diastereomers from (Z)-oct-4-ene. In a standard (achiral) HPLC, diastereomers can co-elute and thus will appear as 2 peaks, as the achiral column cannot differentiate based on chirality. However, in a chiral HPLC, the distinct stereochemical nature of the diastereomers allows for their separation, resulting in 4 peaks.

[{'verifier_name': 'o4-mini', 'evaluation': {'failure_reason': 'The reasoning incorrectly assumed that both (E)- and (Z)-alkene epoxides open to give two enantiomeric diols each, leading to four products. In fact, anti opening of the trans-epoxide (from E-alkene) yields a single meso diol (achiral), while the cis-epoxide (from Z-alkene) yields a racemic diol pair. Thus there are only three distinct products, not four.', 'feedback': 'In the stereochemical classification subtask, agents treated both epoxide openings as generating enantiomeric pairs. They overlooked that the trans-epoxide opens anti to give a meso diol (with an internal mirror plane), which is achiral and appears as one peak on either HPLC. The cis-epoxide opening yields a racemic pair (two enantiomers). This key mechanistic insight was missing. As a result, the achiral HPLC shows two peaks (meso vs racemate) and the chiral HPLC shows three peaks (meso as one and the two enantiomers).', 'suggestion': '1. Introduce a dedicated stereochemistry subtask (or add to Sub-task 1) requiring explicit determination of whether each diol is meso or racemic, including a check for internal symmetry. 2. Enrich context by reminding agents of the stereospecificity of acid-catalyzed epoxide opening (anti-addition) and the conditions under which meso vs racemic diols form.'}}, {'verifier_name': 'gpt-4.1-mini', 'evaluation': {'failure_reason': 'The previous reasoning incorrectly assumed that the four stereoisomeric diol products formed from the (E)- and (Z)-oct-4-ene epoxidation and ring-opening would co-elute into only two peaks on an achiral HPLC column. This led to the conclusion that the achiral HPLC would show 2 peaks and the chiral HPLC 4 peaks. However, the actual stereochemical relationships and chromatographic behavior were misunderstood, causing the final answer to be wrong.', 'feedback': "The core error in the reasoning lies in the misunderstanding of the stereochemical relationships among the products and how achiral HPLC separates diastereomers. The agents correctly identified that (E)- and (Z)-oct-4-ene yield trans- and cis-epoxides respectively, and that acid-catalyzed ring opening produces diols with two stereocenters, resulting in four stereoisomers total (two from each alkene isomer). However, the agents incorrectly concluded that these four diastereomers would collapse into only two peaks on an achiral HPLC. \n\nIn reality, achiral reverse-phase HPLC can separate diastereomers because they differ in physical properties such as polarity and shape, not just chirality. Diastereomers generally have different retention times on achiral columns, so all four diastereomers should be resolved, resulting in four distinct peaks. The chiral HPLC, which can separate enantiomers, would also show four peaks, as each diastereomeric pair consists of enantiomers.\n\nThe flawed assumption was that diastereomers co-elute on achiral HPLC, which is not generally true. This mistake occurred during the analysis of chromatographic behavior in subtasks related to achiral HPLC separation (stage_2.subtask_1) and was propagated through the integration step (stage_3.subtask_1). The agents also did not sufficiently consider the presence of enantiomeric pairs within each diastereomeric set and how that affects peak counts on chiral vs. achiral columns.\n\nContext was sufficient regarding the chemical transformations and stereochemistry, but the key missing piece was a detailed stereochemical analysis of the products' chromatographic behavior, especially the achiral HPLC's ability to separate diastereomers. The agents' collaboration pattern (Debate and SC_CoT) was effective in gathering opinions but failed to challenge the critical assumption about diastereomer separation on achiral HPLC.\n\nIn summary, the error originated from an incorrect assumption about chromatographic resolution of diastereomers on achiral columns, leading to an incorrect final answer choice.", 'suggestion': '1. Refine the subtasks to explicitly require detailed stereochemical classification of all products, including identification of enantiomeric and diastereomeric relationships, and their expected chromatographic behavior on both achiral and chiral columns. This should include a step to analyze whether diastereomers are expected to be resolved on achiral HPLC.\n\n2. Change the collaboration pattern in the chromatographic analysis subtasks (stage_2.subtask_1 and stage_2.subtask_2) from Debate or SC_CoT to a more rigorous Reflexion or Multi-Agent Verification pattern, where agents must explicitly verify and challenge assumptions about chromatographic separations, especially the separation of diastereomers on achiral columns.\n\nThese changes will ensure that critical assumptions are tested and that the reasoning about chromatographic behavior is accurate, preventing propagation of incorrect conclusions to the final answer.'}}]

The epoxidation of (E)-oct-4-ene will yield a trans-epoxide, while the epoxidation of (Z)-oct-4-ene will yield a cis-epoxide. Upon acid-catalyzed ring opening, the trans-epoxide from (E)-oct-4-ene will lead to a racemic mixture of two diols, as the opening occurs in an anti fashion, resulting in two chiral products. The cis-epoxide from (Z)-oct-4-ene, on the other hand, will also lead to a racemic mixture of two diols, but they will be different from those produced from the trans-epoxide. Therefore, each reaction produces two distinct diastereomers (from each starting material), resulting in a total of four distinct products when both reactions are combined. The products include two pairs of enantiomers, which are diastereomers to each other. In achiral HPLC, these will appear as two peaks (since it cannot distinguish between enantiomers), while in chiral HPLC, it will resolve all four diastereomers into four distinct peaks. Thus, the overall observation will be 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent EpW5:\nThe epoxidation of (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA leads to the formation of epoxides with distinct stereochemistry. When treated with aqueous acid, the epoxide ring opens in a stereospecific manner (anti addition), resulting in the formation of diols. For (E)-oct-4-ene, the resulting product will be a racemic mixture of two enantiomers due to the formation of two different chiral centers from the anti addition of water across the double bond. Similarly, the (Z)-oct-4-ene will also yield a racemic mixture of two different enantiomers following the same mechanism. Therefore, both reactions will produce two pairs of enantiomers, leading to a total of four distinct products when combined. In a standard HPLC, which cannot distinguish between enantiomers, these four products will show as two peaks. However, in a chiral HPLC, which can differentiate enantiomers, it will show four peaks corresponding to the two pairs of enantiomers. Thus, the correct observation is 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent LlvV:\nIn the first reaction, (E)-oct-4-ene undergoes epoxidation with mCPBA, forming a trans-epoxide. The subsequent acid-catalyzed ring opening of this epoxide will yield two products: one being a racemic mixture of diols due to the anti-addition mechanism, thus resulting in two enantiomers. In the second reaction, (Z)-oct-4-ene also undergoes epoxidation, but this time it forms a cis-epoxide. The acid-catalyzed ring opening of this epoxide will also lead to a racemic mixture of diols, but they will differ in stereochemistry from those produced in the first reaction. Therefore, combining the products from both reactions results in a total of four unique diastereomers: two from (E)-oct-4-ene and two from (Z)-oct-4-ene. In achiral HPLC, these diastereomers will appear as four distinct peaks since they differ in physical properties. However, in chiral HPLC, the enantiomers from each diastereomer will also be resolved, leading to a total of four peaks as well.

Therefore, when analyzed by standard HPLC, which cannot distinguish between enantiomers, we will observe 4 peaks due to the presence of 4 distinct compounds. In contrast, chiral HPLC will separate the enantiomers, leading to a total of 4 peaks as well, since all products are chiral. This results in the observation of 4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent ghLs:\nIn the reactions involving (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene treated with mCPBA followed by acid-catalyzed ring opening, we first need to consider the stereochemical outcomes of the epoxidation and subsequent ring opening. The epoxidation of (E)-oct-4-ene will yield a trans-epoxide, while the epoxidation of (Z)-oct-4-ene will yield a cis-epoxide. Upon acid-catalyzed ring opening, the trans-epoxide from (E)-oct-4-ene will lead to a racemic mixture of two diols, as the opening occurs in an anti fashion, resulting in two chiral products. The cis-epoxide from (Z)-oct-4-ene, on the other hand, will also lead to a racemic mixture of two diols, but they will be different from those produced from the trans-epoxide. Therefore, each reaction produces two distinct diastereomers (from each starting material), resulting in a total of four distinct products when both reactions are combined. The products include two pairs of enantiomers, which are diastereomers to each other. In achiral HPLC, these will appear as two peaks (since it cannot distinguish between enantiomers), while in chiral HPLC, it will resolve all four diastereomers into four distinct peaks. Thus, the overall observation will be 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent EpW5:\nThe epoxidation of (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA leads to the formation of epoxides with distinct stereochemistry. When treated with aqueous acid, the epoxide ring opens in a stereospecific manner (anti addition), resulting in the formation of diols. For (E)-oct-4-ene, the resulting product will be a racemic mixture of two enantiomers due to the formation of two different chiral centers from the anti addition of water across the double bond. Similarly, the (Z)-oct-4-ene will also yield a racemic mixture of two different enantiomers following the same mechanism. Therefore, both reactions will produce two pairs of enantiomers, leading to a total of four distinct products when combined. In a standard HPLC, which cannot distinguish between enantiomers, these four products will show as two peaks. However, in a chiral HPLC, which can differentiate enantiomers, it will show four peaks corresponding to the two pairs of enantiomers. Thus, the correct observation is 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent LlvV:\nIn the first reaction, (E)-oct-4-ene undergoes epoxidation with mCPBA, forming a trans-epoxide. The subsequent acid-catalyzed ring opening of this epoxide will yield two products: one being a racemic mixture of diols due to the anti-addition mechanism, thus resulting in two enantiomers. In the second reaction, (Z)-oct-4-ene also undergoes epoxidation, but this time it forms a cis-epoxide. The acid-catalyzed ring opening of this epoxide will also lead to a racemic mixture of diols, but they will differ in stereochemistry from those produced in the first reaction. Therefore, combining the products from both reactions results in a total of four unique diastereomers: two from (E)-oct-4-ene and two from (Z)-oct-4-ene. In achiral HPLC, these diastereomers will appear as four distinct peaks since they differ in physical properties.

Thus, we have a total of four distinct products: two from the (E) reaction and two from the (Z) reaction. Since these products are diastereomers of each other, they are not enantiomers. Therefore, all four products are chiral and distinct. When analyzed by standard HPLC, which cannot distinguish between enantiomers, we will observe 4 peaks due to the presence of 4 distinct compounds. Chiral HPLC will also show 4 peaks, as it can separate the enantiomers.

The stereochemical outcome of these reactions must be analyzed carefully. For (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxidation yields a trans-epoxide, which upon acid-catalyzed ring opening results in two diastereomeric products due to the anti stereochemistry of the ring opening. For (Z)-oct-4-ene, the epoxidation yields a cis-epoxide, which also opens to yield two different diastereomeric products. Thus, we have a total of four distinct products: two from (E)-oct-4-ene and two from (Z)-oct-4-ene. Since the products from the (E) and (Z) reactions are diastereomers of each other, they will not be enantiomers. Therefore, the products are not meso since they do not exhibit internal symmetry; they are all chiral and racemic. In conclusion, the combined mixture contains four different chiral compounds. Therefore, when analyzed by standard HPLC, which cannot distinguish between enantiomers, we will observe 4 peaks due to the presence of 4 distinct compounds. In contrast, chiral HPLC will separate the enantiomers, leading to a total of 4 peaks as well, since all products are chiral.

The (E)-isomer yields a trans-epoxide, while the (Z)-isomer yields a cis-epoxide. The subsequent acid-catalyzed ring opening of these epoxides leads to the formation of diastereomeric products. Specifically, the trans-epoxide from (E)-oct-4-ene results in two diastereomers, and the cis-epoxide from (Z)-oct-4-ene also results in two diastereomers. Thus, we have a total of four distinct products: two from the (E) reaction and two from the (Z) reaction. Since these products are diastereomers of each other, they are not enantiomers. Therefore, all four products are chiral and distinct. When analyzed by standard HPLC, which cannot distinguish between enantiomers, we will observe 4 peaks due to the presence of 4 distinct compounds. Chiral HPLC will also show 4 peaks, as it can separate the enantiomers.

The (E)-oct-4-ene, upon epoxidation, forms a trans-epoxide that opens to yield two diastereomeric products due to the anti addition of the acid. The (Z)-oct-4-ene forms a cis-epoxide that also opens to yield two different diastereomeric products. Thus, we end up with four distinct products: two from (E)-oct-4-ene and two from (Z)-oct-4-ene. Importantly, the products from the two different reactions are diastereomers of each other and not enantiomers. Since all products are chiral and there are no identical compounds among them, we have four unique stereoisomers. In a standard (achiral) HPLC, all four distinct compounds will produce four separate peaks because it cannot distinguish between enantiomers. In the chiral HPLC, it will also show four peaks, as it can separate the chiral compounds. Therefore, both chromatograms will display 4 peaks in total, leading to the conclusion that the answer is A) 4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent Qg9L:\nIn the reactions involving (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene, both undergo epoxidation with mCPBA followed by acid-catalyzed ring opening.

The (E)-oct-4-ene forms a trans-epoxide, which upon ring opening yields two diastereomeric products due to the anti addition of the acid. The (Z)-oct-4-ene forms a cis-epoxide, which also opens to yield two different diastereomeric products. Therefore, we have a total of four distinct products: two from (E)-oct-4-ene and two from (Z)-oct-4-ene. The products from the two reactions are diastereomers of each other, not enantiomers, and all products are chiral. In a standard (achiral) HPLC, which cannot distinguish between enantiomers, we will observe 4 peaks due to the presence of 4 distinct compounds. In chiral HPLC, it will also show 4 peaks, as it can separate the chiral compounds.

Please think carefully and provide an updated answer. \n\n ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent c79o:\nIn the reactions of (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid, both reactions yield different stereoisomers due to the geometric differences in the starting materials. (E)-oct-4-ene leads to a trans-epoxide, while (Z)-oct-4-ene leads to a cis-epoxide. The subsequent acid-catalyzed ring opening of these epoxides results in the formation of two diastereomers from each starting material, giving a total of four distinct products: two from (E)-oct-4-ene and two from (Z)-oct-4-ene. All four products are chiral. When analyzed on a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column, which separates compounds based on physical properties like polarity but cannot distinguish between enantiomers, we would expect to see 4 peaks corresponding to the 4 distinct products. In contrast, a chiral HPLC column can separate enantiomers and diastereomers based on their interactions with the chiral stationary phase, and since all four products are chiral, it would also reveal 4 peaks. Therefore, both chromatographic methods would yield 4 peaks. This leads to the conclusion that the correct answer is A) 4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent 3SAF:\nIn the reactions involving (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene, both undergo epoxidation with mCPBA followed by acid-catalyzed ring opening.
