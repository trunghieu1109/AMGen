============== Task detailed analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- A quorum-sensing peptide from Lactobacillus acidophilus is applied to Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast).
- Treatment induces shmoo formation, a morphological change related to mating.
- The experiment aims to study the proteome of active chromatin in the shmoo.
- The method used is chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by mass spectrometry.
- Four protein complexes are listed as options: pre-initiation complex, pre-replication complex, enhancer protein complex, nucleosome histone complex.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The quorum-sensing peptide triggers a biological response (shmoo formation) in yeast, indicating intercellular communication.
- Active chromatin in the shmoo is targeted, implying focus on proteins associated with transcriptionally active DNA regions.
- Chromatin immunoprecipitation isolates protein-DNA complexes, so proteins bound to active chromatin will be identified.
- The listed complexes differ in function: pre-initiation complex relates to transcription initiation; pre-replication complex to DNA replication origin licensing; enhancer protein complex to transcription regulation; nucleosome histone complex to chromatin structure.
- The condition of 'active chromatin' suggests enrichment of proteins involved in transcription rather than replication or general chromatin packaging.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- Molecular biology and biochemistry, specifically chromatin biology and gene regulation.
- Techniques involved include chromatin immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry proteomics.
- The context relates to cell signaling, gene expression regulation, and protein-DNA interactions.
- Relevant subfields include epigenetics, proteomics, and microbial-eukaryotic communication.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The exact definition of 'active chromatin' in this context (e.g., euchromatin vs heterochromatin) is not explicitly stated.
- The nature of the enhancer protein complex is vague; whether it refers to general transcription factors or specific activators is unclear.
- The experimental conditions and controls for ChIP are not described, which could affect protein recovery.
- Potential overlap or coexistence of complexes on chromatin during shmoo formation is not addressed.
- The question assumes knowledge of which complexes are expected in active chromatin during this biological state.
