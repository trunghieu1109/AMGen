============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- Initial atomic nucleus mass: M, with rest-mass energy 300 GeV.
- The nucleus is initially at rest.
- The nucleus undergoes spontaneous fission into exactly two fragments.
- One fragment is twice as massive as the other in terms of rest mass.
- The sum of the rest masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M (i.e., total rest mass after fission is 0.99 M).
- Kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is denoted as T1.
- Electrons are ignored.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The initial rest mass energy corresponds to the total rest mass M at rest, so total initial energy is 300 GeV.
- After fission, the total rest mass decreases to 0.99 M, indicating a mass defect of 1% of M, which converts into kinetic energy of the fragments.
- The two fragments have rest masses m and 2m, with m + 2m = 0.99 M, so m = 0.33 M approximately.
- Conservation of momentum applies: since initial nucleus is at rest, the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta.
- The kinetic energies of the fragments arise from the mass defect energy released.
- The problem contrasts the kinetic energy T1 of the heavier fragment calculated relativistically versus classically, and asks for the difference.
- The classical approximation assumes non-relativistic kinetic energy (T = p^2/2m), while the correct value uses relativistic energy-momentum relations.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem lies in the domain of physics, specifically nuclear physics and relativistic mechanics.
- It involves concepts from special relativity (relativistic energy and momentum), nuclear fission, and conservation laws.
- Mathematical subfields include algebra and relativistic kinematics.
- Such problems are common in physics education, nuclear physics research, and high-energy physics contexts.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The exact numerical values of masses and energies are given in relative terms; absolute values depend on M.
- The problem assumes no other particles are emitted, which simplifies momentum and energy conservation.
- The term "difference between the (correct) T1 value and T1 value calculated using classical approximation" implies a comparison of kinetic energies, but the exact method of calculation is not detailed.
- Potential challenges include correctly applying relativistic formulas and interpreting the mass defect energy distribution.
- The problem ignores electrons, so no electron mass or energy considerations are needed.
