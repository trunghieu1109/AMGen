============== Task detailed analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- The problem context is an outbreak of a viral infectious disease caused by a retrovirus in a city.
- The goal involves designing a molecular diagnostic kit for quick detection.
- Four choices describe different diagnostic approaches:
  * Choice 1: Identify virus by DNA sequencing, then develop a PCR kit.
  * Choice 2: Identify IgG antibodies, then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG.
  * Choice 3: Identify virus using symptom information, then design a nested PCR kit.
  * Choice 4: Identify virus by cDNA sequencing, then develop a real-time PCR kit.
- Key entities include the virus (retrovirus), diagnostic methods (DNA sequencing, cDNA sequencing, PCR, nested PCR, real-time PCR, ELISA), and biological markers (viral genome, IgG antibodies).

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The virus identification step precedes the development of the diagnostic kit in all choices.
- DNA sequencing and cDNA sequencing relate to determining viral genetic material; cDNA sequencing implies reverse transcription from RNA (consistent with retrovirus biology).
- PCR-based methods amplify viral genetic sequences for detection; nested PCR and real-time PCR are variations with different sensitivity and quantification capabilities.
- ELISA targets host immune response (IgG antibodies), indicating indirect detection.
- Symptom-based identification (choice 3) relies on clinical data rather than molecular characterization.
- Constraints include speed and accuracy of diagnosis, influencing choice of molecular technique.
- The choice of target (viral genome vs antibodies) affects kit design and diagnostic window.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- Primary domain: Molecular biology and virology.
- Subfields: Diagnostic assay development, molecular diagnostics, immunology.
- Techniques involved: DNA/RNA sequencing, PCR methodologies, immunoassays (ELISA).
- Applications: Public health response, clinical diagnostics, epidemiology.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The problem does not specify the stage of infection or sample type, which affects antibody presence and viral load.
- The term "identify the virus using symptom information" is vague and may lack specificity.
- It is unclear whether the viral genome is RNA or DNA, though retroviruses are RNA viruses requiring reverse transcription.
- The relative advantages or limitations of each diagnostic method in this context are not detailed.
- Potential challenges include differentiating between direct viral detection and indirect antibody detection, and the timing of sample collection relative to infection.
