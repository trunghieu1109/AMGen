============== Task detailed analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- The problem provides four effective particles: Magnon, Skyrmion, Pion, and Phonon.
- The key condition is whether each particle is associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry.
- No numerical values or explicit equations are given.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- Magnons are quasiparticles representing collective spin wave excitations in a magnetically ordered system, typically arising due to spontaneous breaking of spin rotational symmetry.
- Skyrmions are topological solitons in field theories, often related to nontrivial configurations in systems with broken symmetries but are not themselves Goldstone modes.
- Pions are mesons interpreted as pseudo-Goldstone bosons resulting from spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in quantum chromodynamics.
- Phonons are quantized lattice vibrations in crystals, generally associated with the breaking of continuous translational symmetry to discrete lattice symmetry.
- The condition of spontaneous symmetry breaking is central to identifying which particles emerge as Goldstone bosons or related excitations.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem lies in theoretical and condensed matter physics, specifically in the study of spontaneous symmetry breaking and effective quasiparticles.
- Subfields include quantum field theory, condensed matter physics, and particle physics.
- Such problems are common in advanced physics education, research, and competitions involving symmetry and particle excitations.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The term "effective particle" could be ambiguous without specifying the physical context (e.g., condensed matter vs. particle physics).
- The nature of the symmetry (global, local, continuous, discrete) involved in each case is not explicitly stated.
- The problem assumes familiarity with the concept of spontaneous symmetry breaking and its relation to these particles.
- Potential challenge: distinguishing between particles that are Goldstone bosons of broken symmetries and those that are topological or vibrational excitations not directly tied to spontaneous symmetry breaking.

============== Evaluation from verifiers ================
[{'verifier_name': 'o4-mini', 'evaluation': {'failure_reason': 'The core mistake was in Sub-task 1: all agents mis‐classified the Skyrmion as being unrelated to any spontaneously broken symmetry. In fact, Skyrmions only exist because one works in a theory whose vacuum manifold derives from a spontaneously broken symmetry (for example, the non-linear sigma model arising from chiral symmetry breaking). By treating Skyrmions as purely ‘topological’ and ignoring their SSB origin, every downstream subtask simply propagated that error, leading to the wrong final answer.', 'feedback': '• In Sub-task 1, the assumption “Skyrmions do not arise from any spontaneously broken symmetry” is false. Skyrmion solutions require a vacuum manifold (e.g. S^3) coming from the spontaneous breaking of an underlying continuous symmetry (chiral SU(2)_L×SU(2)_R→SU(2)_V in nuclear physics, or SU(2)→U(1) in certain magnets).  \n• Because this critical misclassification was never challenged, Sub-tasks 2 and 3 simply confirmed the same wrong choice.  \n• The reasoning never included a step to check the origin of the order parameter manifold for each particle, so no one caught that Skyrmions are intrinsically tied to SSB.', 'suggestion': '1) Refine Sub-task 1 instructions: require the agent to state explicitly which symmetry is broken to produce each excitation and to cite the effective field theory (or Hamiltonian) in which each particle appears.  \n2) Introduce a new verification subtask immediately after classification: ‘For each entry, cross-check that the purported non-SSB particle indeed does not require a broken symmetry by referring to a standard reference or deriving the vacuum manifold.’ This dual‐pass (classify\u2009+\u2009verify) approach will catch any mis-classifications before proceeding to the final selection.'}}, {'verifier_name': 'gpt-4.1-mini', 'evaluation': {'failure_reason': 'The final answer was marked wrong because the reasoning incorrectly classified the phonon as associated with a spontaneously-broken continuous symmetry, while in fact, the continuous translational symmetry is explicitly broken by the underlying discrete lattice structure, making phonons not true Goldstone bosons of spontaneous symmetry breaking. This subtlety was overlooked, leading to a misclassification and thus an incorrect final answer.', 'feedback': "The reasoning process correctly identified magnons and pions as arising from spontaneous symmetry breaking and correctly identified skyrmions as topological excitations unrelated to spontaneous symmetry breaking. However, the critical error lies in the treatment of phonons. The agents assumed that phonons are Goldstone bosons resulting from spontaneous breaking of continuous translational symmetry by the crystal lattice formation. This is a common but subtle misconception. In reality, the presence of a discrete lattice explicitly breaks continuous translational symmetry down to a discrete subgroup, so the continuous symmetry is not spontaneously broken but explicitly broken. Therefore, phonons are not Goldstone bosons of a spontaneously broken continuous symmetry but rather vibrational modes of a discrete lattice. This distinction means phonons should not be classified as associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking in the strict sense. The error occurred in Sub-task 1 during the classification step, where phonons were grouped with magnons and pions as arising from spontaneous symmetry breaking. This flawed assumption propagated through Sub-tasks 2 and 3, leading to the final answer that skyrmions alone are not associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking, while the correct answer should consider phonons as well. The context provided was sufficient for the other particles but lacked explicit emphasis on the nature of translational symmetry breaking in crystals and the difference between explicit and spontaneous symmetry breaking. The agents' collaboration and information passing were consistent and effective, but the conceptual misunderstanding about phonons was never challenged or corrected. This conceptual oversight is the root cause of the failure.", 'suggestion': 'To improve the workflow, explicitly include a subtask or a focused checkpoint that critically examines the nature of symmetry breaking for each particle, especially for borderline or subtle cases like phonons. This subtask should require agents to distinguish between explicit and spontaneous symmetry breaking and verify whether the associated excitations are true Goldstone bosons. Additionally, enhance the instructions to prompt agents to consider the difference between continuous and discrete symmetries and the role of explicit symmetry breaking in condensed matter systems. Using a stronger collaboration pattern such as Reflexion or SC-CoT with explicit challenge steps on subtle points (like phonons) can help catch such conceptual errors early. This refinement will prevent propagation of subtle misconceptions and improve final answer accuracy.'}}]
