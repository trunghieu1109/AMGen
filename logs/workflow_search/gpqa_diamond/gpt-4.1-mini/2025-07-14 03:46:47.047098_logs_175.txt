============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- The system's state at time t is given by the column vector \( \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \).
- Two observables, P and Q, are represented by 3x3 matrices.
- Operator P's matrix is symmetric with elements:
  \[ P = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \end{pmatrix} \]
- Operator Q's matrix is diagonal with elements:
  \[ Q = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix} \]
- The problem involves sequential measurements: first measuring P and obtaining eigenvalue 0, then measuring Q and obtaining eigenvalue -1.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The state vector represents the system's initial condition in a 3-dimensional Hilbert space.
- Operators P and Q correspond to observables with eigenvalues and eigenvectors; their matrices define these.
- The measurement of P yielding 0 corresponds to projecting the state onto the eigenspace of P with eigenvalue 0.
- After this projection (state collapse), the measurement of Q yielding -1 corresponds to projecting onto the eigenspace of Q with eigenvalue -1.
- The probability of these sequential outcomes depends on the overlaps between the initial state, the eigenspaces of P and Q, and the post-measurement states.
- The constraints of orthogonality and normalization of eigenvectors, as well as the spectral decomposition of P and Q, are implicit.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem lies in the domain of quantum mechanics, specifically quantum measurement theory.
- Mathematically, it involves linear algebra (vector spaces, eigenvalues, eigenvectors, projections) and probability theory.
- Subfields include quantum linear algebra and operator theory.
- Such problems are common in physics (quantum information, quantum computing) and mathematical competitions involving quantum concepts.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The state vector is given but not normalized; it is unclear if normalization is assumed or required.
- The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P are not explicitly provided; the multiplicity and degeneracy of eigenvalue 0 need clarification.
- The order and nature of measurements imply state collapse, but the exact post-measurement state is not detailed.
- The basis in which the matrices and state vector are expressed is not explicitly stated but assumed to be consistent.
- Potential computational complexity arises in finding eigenvectors and projections, which is not requested here.
