============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- Two stars, Star_1 and Star_2.
- Radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times the radius of Star_2.
- Mass of Star_1 is also 1.5 times the mass of Star_2.
- Both stars have the same wavelength of peak brightness (implying same surface temperature via Wien's law).
- Radial velocities: Star_1 = 0 km/s, Star_2 = 700 km/s.
- Stars are assumed to radiate as black bodies.
- Luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2 by some factor to be determined.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- Radius and mass scale by the same factor (1.5).
- Same peak wavelength implies equal surface temperatures (from Wien's displacement law).
- Luminosity of a black body star depends on radius and temperature: L = 4πR²σT⁴.
- Since temperatures are equal, luminosity ratio depends on the square of the radius ratio.
- Radial velocities may affect observed properties (e.g., Doppler shifts), but since peak wavelengths are equal, velocity differences might not affect temperature determination.
- The problem likely tests understanding of how radius and temperature influence luminosity.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- Astrophysics, specifically stellar physics.
- Concepts from thermodynamics (black body radiation), spectroscopy, and classical mechanics (radial velocity).
- Related mathematical fields include algebra and physics-based modeling.
- Such problems are common in astrophysics education and physics competitions.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The role of radial velocity in the problem is not explicitly connected to luminosity calculation; its significance is unclear.
- Assumption that radial velocity does not affect observed temperature or luminosity needs to be stated.
- No explicit mention of whether relativistic effects or Doppler shifts are considered.
- The exact method of luminosity comparison (e.g., whether velocity affects observed flux) is not detailed.
- Potential ambiguity in whether mass affects luminosity directly or only through radius and temperature.
