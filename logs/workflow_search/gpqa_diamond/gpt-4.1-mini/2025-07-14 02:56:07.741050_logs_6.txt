[{'objective': 'Identify the energy threshold condition for gamma-gamma annihilation into electron-positron pairs.'}, {'objective': 'Calculate the minimum gamma-ray photon energy required for pair production using the average CMB photon energy.'}, {'objective': 'Determine the gamma-ray energy at which the lifetime in the universe is limited by this annihilation process.'}, {'objective': 'Compare the calculated gamma-ray energy with the given multiple-choice options to select the correct value.'}]
