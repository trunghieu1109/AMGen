1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- There is a star with radius R_star = 1.5 R_sun.
- A first planet orbits this star in a circular orbit with radius R_planet1 = 1 Earth radius.
- The first planet's orbital period is P1 = 3 days.
- The transit impact parameter of the first planet is b = 0.2 (dimensionless, normalized to stellar radius).
- A second planet in the same system has radius R_planet2 = 2.5 Earth radii.
- The second planet also has a circular orbit and shares the same orbital plane as the first planet.
- The problem involves determining the maximum orbital period of the second planet such that it exhibits both transit and occultation events.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The transit impact parameter b = 0.2 for the first planet indicates the sky-projected distance between the planet's orbital path and the stellar disk center, normalized by the stellar radius.
- Both planets share the same orbital plane, implying their orbital inclinations are equal.
- The first planet's orbital period and radius, combined with the star's radius, provide a scale for the system.
- The second planet's radius is larger, which may affect the transit and occultation geometry.
- The condition that the second planet exhibits both transit and occultation events implies constraints on its orbital inclination and semi-major axis (or period), ensuring the planet passes in front of and behind the star from the observer's viewpoint.
- The maximum orbital period corresponds to the largest orbit where these geometric conditions still hold.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem lies primarily in astrophysics and orbital mechanics.
- Mathematically, it involves geometry (circular orbits, impact parameters), trigonometry (orbital inclinations and transit geometry), and Keplerian orbital dynamics (relating orbital period and semi-major axis).
- Subfields include exoplanet transit photometry and celestial mechanics.
- Such problems are common in astrophysical research and mathematical modeling of planetary systems, as well as in astronomy competitions.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The exact definition or reference frame for the impact parameter (e.g., normalized to stellar radius) is assumed but not explicitly stated.
- The problem does not specify the mass of the star or planets, which may be needed for precise orbital period calculations.
- It is assumed that the orbits are circular and coplanar, but the inclination angle is not given explicitly.
- The problem does not specify whether the orbits are interior or exterior relative to each other.
- The term "maximum orbital period" implies an upper bound on the second planet's orbit for transit and occultation, but the exact geometric or dynamical constraints leading to this maximum are not detailed.
- Potential challenges include relating the impact parameter and planet/star radii to orbital inclination and period, and ensuring both transit and occultation conditions are met simultaneously.
