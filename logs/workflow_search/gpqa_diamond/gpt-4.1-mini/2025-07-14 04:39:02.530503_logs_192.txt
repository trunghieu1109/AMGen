============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- The number of stars in a specific sky region varies with parallax (plx) as 1/plx^5.
- Parallax (plx) is a measure inversely related to distance (r), typically plx ‚àù 1/r.
- The problem involves determining the variation of the number of stars per unit distance range (r).

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- Since parallax and distance are inversely related, the given dependence on parallax translates into a dependence on distance.
- The number of stars as a function of parallax is given, so converting this to a function of distance involves substituting plx = k/r (for some constant k).
- The problem implicitly involves differentiating or transforming the distribution from parallax space to distance space.
- The constraints imply a power-law relationship, and the problem tests understanding of how distributions transform under variable substitution.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem lies in astrophysics and applied mathematics.
- Relevant mathematical domains include algebra, calculus (change of variables, distributions), and mathematical modeling.
- Concepts involved include inverse relationships, power laws, and distribution transformations.
- Such problems arise in astrophysics (stellar distributions), observational astronomy, and data analysis.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The exact proportionality constant relating parallax and distance is not specified but is standard in astronomy.
- The problem assumes a continuous distribution of stars and a direct functional form without noise or observational limits.
- It is not explicitly stated whether the number of stars given is cumulative or differential with respect to parallax.
- Potential challenges include correctly applying the change of variables and interpreting the meaning of "number of stars per unit range of distance."

Parallax and distance are related by plx = k/r. To convert dN/d(plx) into dN/dr, we use the change‚Äêof‚Äêvariables formula: dN/dr = (dN/d(plx))¬∑|d(plx)/dr|. Substituting plx = k/r gives dN/d(plx) ‚àù (k/r)^(‚Äì5) = k^(‚Äì5)¬∑r^5. The derivative d(plx)/dr = ‚Äìk/r^2, so |d(plx)/dr| = k/r^2.
