1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- Mass spectrometry data: molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 (100% intensity), and a peak at m/z = 158 (32% intensity), indicating the presence of an isotopic pattern consistent with chlorine (Cl-35 and Cl-37 isotopes).
- IR spectrum: broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1, characteristic of O-H stretching (likely a carboxylic acid), and a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1, typical of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid or aldehyde.
- 1H NMR data: singlet at 11.0 ppm (1H), likely a carboxylic acid proton; two doublets at 8.02 ppm (2H) and 7.72 ppm (2H), indicating aromatic protons in a para-substituted benzene ring.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The molecular ion peak at 156 with a 32% peak at 158 suggests a chlorine atom in the molecule due to its isotopic pattern.
- The broad IR peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1 combined with the sharp 1720 cm^-1 peak suggests a carboxylic acid functional group.
- The NMR pattern with two doublets each integrating to 2H suggests a symmetrical para-substituted aromatic ring.
- The singlet at 11.0 ppm corresponds to an acidic proton, supporting the presence of a carboxylic acid.
- These spectral features collectively suggest a para-chlorobenzoic acid structure.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem falls within the domain of organic chemistry, specifically spectroscopic analysis and structural elucidation.
- Subfields involved include analytical chemistry, spectroscopy (mass spectrometry, IR, NMR), and organic structural determination.
- Such problems are common in chemical research, pharmaceutical analysis, and educational settings like chemistry competitions or laboratory courses.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The exact solvent or conditions for the NMR and IR spectra are not specified, which can affect peak positions.
- The multiplicity and coupling constants for the NMR doublets are not given, limiting detailed analysis of substitution patterns.
- The problem does not specify whether the compound is pure or if impurities might affect the spectra.
- The choice of candidate structures includes positional isomers and different functional groups, which may require more detailed spectral data for unambiguous identification.
