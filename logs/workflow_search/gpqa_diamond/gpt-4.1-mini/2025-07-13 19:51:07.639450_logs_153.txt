============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- Mass spectrometry data: molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 (100% intensity), and a peak at m/z = 158 (32% intensity), indicating the presence of an isotope, likely chlorine (due to the characteristic 3:1 ratio).
- IR spectrum: broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1, typical of O-H stretching in carboxylic acids; strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1, characteristic of C=O stretching in carbonyl groups.
- 1H NMR data: singlet at 11.0 ppm (1H), likely a carboxylic acid proton; two doublets at 8.02 ppm (2H) and 7.72 ppm (2H), suggesting an aromatic ring with symmetrical substitution.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The mass peaks suggest a molecular weight of 156 with chlorine isotope pattern, indicating one chlorine atom.
- The IR data indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (broad O-H and sharp C=O peaks).
- The NMR pattern with two doublets each integrating to 2H suggests a para-substituted benzene ring.
- The singlet at 11.0 ppm corresponds to the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid.
- These data collectively suggest a para-chlorobenzoic acid structure.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem lies in the domain of organic chemistry, specifically spectroscopic analysis.
- Subfields involved include mass spectrometry, infrared spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
- Such problems are common in analytical chemistry, pharmaceutical identification, and chemical research.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The exact nature of the 'liquid' is ambiguous since the sample is described as a white solid.
- The NMR splitting patterns assume a simple aromatic substitution pattern; more complex coupling could complicate interpretation.
- The problem does not specify solvent or conditions for NMR or IR, which could affect peak positions.
- The choice of candidate structures includes positional isomers and different functional groups, requiring careful spectral interpretation to distinguish.
