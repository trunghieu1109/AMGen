1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- The system's state at time t is given by the column vector \( \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \).
- Two observables, P and Q, are represented by 3x3 matrices.
- Operator P's matrix elements are:
  \[ P = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \end{pmatrix} \]
- Operator Q's matrix elements are:
  \[ Q = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix} \]
- The problem involves sequential measurements: first measuring P and obtaining eigenvalue 0, then measuring Q and obtaining eigenvalue -1.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The state vector represents the system's initial state before measurement.
- Operators P and Q correspond to observables with specific eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
- Measuring P projects the state onto the eigenspace corresponding to eigenvalue 0.
- The subsequent measurement of Q is performed on the post-measurement state from P.
- The probability of obtaining specific measurement outcomes depends on projections of the state vector onto the eigenvectors of P and Q.
- The matrices are Hermitian (implied by observables), ensuring real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem lies in the domain of quantum mechanics, specifically quantum measurement theory.
- Mathematically, it involves linear algebra (vector spaces, eigenvalues, eigenvectors, projections).
- Concepts include state vectors, Hermitian operators, measurement postulates, and probability amplitudes.
- Such problems are common in physics (quantum theory), quantum computing, and mathematical physics.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The state vector is given but not normalized; normalization status is unclear.
- It is not explicitly stated whether the matrices are Hermitian, though this is standard for observables.
- The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P and Q are not provided; these must be found or assumed.
- The exact procedure for sequential measurement (collapse postulate) is implied but not detailed.
- Potential complexity arises in computing projections and probabilities without explicit normalization or eigenbasis.
