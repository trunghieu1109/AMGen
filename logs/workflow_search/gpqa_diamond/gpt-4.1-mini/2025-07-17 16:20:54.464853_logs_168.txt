============== Task detailed analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- Initial decay: 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V, where A and B are heavy nucleons of different flavors.
- Emitted particles: 2E (lighter particles) and 2V (lighter particles).
- The total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous with an endpoint value Q.
- Variant decay: replaces 2V with one exotic, massless particle M, i.e., 2A -> 2B + 2E + M.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The original decay emits two V particles, while the variant emits a single massless M particle instead.
- The energy distribution of E particles depends on the kinematics and number/type of emitted particles.
- The continuous spectrum with endpoint Q suggests a range of possible energies for E due to energy sharing among multiple particles.
- Changing from two V particles to one massless M particle alters the energy and momentum conservation constraints, potentially affecting the shape and endpoint of the E energy spectrum.
- The masslessness of M may allow more energy to be available to E particles or change the distribution shape.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- Nuclear physics and particle physics, specifically nuclear decay processes.
- Concepts from quantum mechanics and relativistic kinematics.
- Related mathematical domains include energy and momentum conservation, spectral analysis, and particle decay kinematics.
- Applications include nuclear decay modeling, particle detection, and experimental physics.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The exact masses and energies of particles A, B, E, V, and M are not specified.
- The nature of particles E, V, and M (e.g., whether E and V are identical or different types) is not detailed.
- The mechanism or interaction causing the decay is not described.
- The problem does not specify whether the endpoint Q refers to maximum kinetic energy or total energy.
- Potential complexities in how the masslessness of M affects the energy distribution are not elaborated.
- It is unclear if the variant decay conserves all quantum numbers identically or if other constraints apply.

[{'verifier_name': 'o4-mini', 'evaluation': {'failure_reason': 'All agents assumed incorrectly that the endpoint Q of the summed‐electron spectrum remains the same when you replace two neutrinos by a single exotic massless particle.  That led them to pick the choice that they thought said “continuous spectrum, shape changes, endpoint unchanged,” even though none of the four lettered options actually says that.  In fact the mass‐difference (the Q‐value) for the variant decay is different, so the true endpoint shifts.', 'feedback': '1.  Wrong assumption about the endpoint (Sub-task 2 and carried through):  Every agent simply reused the original Q for the variant decay without checking how the mass replacement (2V→M) changes the nuclear mass‐difference and thus the maximum electron energy.  2.  Mis-mapping of described features to answer letters:  The teams described “continuous with changed shape, same endpoint” yet repeatedly picked D, which reads “discrete & endpoint decreases.”  They never paused to match their narrative to the literal text of the answer choices. 3.  Context gap:  The definition of Q for the variant decay was never re-derived or even restated.  Agents needed a dedicated step to compute how Q changes when the particle content changes.', 'suggestion': 'Introduce a new sub-task immediately after summarizing the variant decay (Sub-task 2): explicitly derive or state the new Q-value for 2A→2B+2E+M.  Use a strict SC-CoT agent to symbolically compare final‐state masses (2B+M vs. 2B+2V) and recompute the endpoint.  Only then evaluate continuity, shape, and endpoint against the literal wordings of the answer choices.  That single change—inserting a Q-recalculation step and forcing a match of narrative to the exact wording of the multiple‐choice options—will prevent the root error from recurring.'}}, {'verifier_name': 'gpt-4.1-mini', 'evaluation': {'failure_reason': 'The previous reasoning process incorrectly concluded that the endpoint energy Q of the electron energy spectrum remains unchanged when replacing two neutrinos (2V) with a single massless particle M, and that the spectrum remains continuous with only a modified shape. This contradicts the known physics of neutrinoless double beta decay variants, where the reduction in invisible particles changes the energy sharing and can produce a discrete or sharply peaked electron energy spectrum with a shifted endpoint. The key error was misunderstanding how the number and nature of emitted invisible particles affect the electron energy spectrum endpoint and continuity.', 'feedback': 'The main flaw in the reasoning lies in the assumption that the endpoint energy Q remains the same and that the electron energy spectrum remains continuous after replacing two neutrinos with a single massless particle M. In standard two-neutrino double beta decay (2νββ), the two neutrinos carry away variable energy, resulting in a continuous electron energy spectrum with an endpoint at Q. However, in the variant decay emitting a single massless particle (often interpreted as a Majoron), the kinematics and energy sharing differ fundamentally. The single massless particle carries away energy and momentum, but with fewer degrees of freedom, which can lead to a discrete or more sharply peaked electron energy spectrum, and the endpoint energy can shift (usually increase) because fewer invisible particles share the energy. The previous agents failed to fully incorporate this physical insight, instead focusing only on phase space reduction and shape modification while keeping the endpoint fixed and spectrum continuous. This is a critical oversight because the endpoint energy is directly tied to the number and mass of invisible particles emitted. The error originated in Sub-task 2 and propagated through Sub-tasks 3, 4, and 5, where the kinematic implications of replacing two neutrinos with one massless particle were not correctly interpreted. The context provided was sufficient but the physical interpretation and assumptions about the spectrum endpoint and continuity were flawed. The collaboration pattern (Debate and SC_CoT) was effective in gathering consistent reasoning but failed to challenge the core physical assumption about the endpoint and spectrum nature. The agents converged prematurely on an incorrect consensus without revisiting fundamental nuclear decay physics principles. To fix this, the reasoning must explicitly consider how the number of invisible particles affects the maximum electron energy and whether the spectrum remains continuous or becomes discrete/peaked, reflecting known results from neutrinoless double beta decay and Majoron emission literature.', 'suggestion': '1) Refine Sub-task 2 and Sub-task 3 instructions to explicitly require agents to analyze how the number and mass of invisible particles affect both the shape and endpoint of the electron energy spectrum, emphasizing known physics of double beta decay variants. 2) Introduce a stronger Reflexion or Verification subtask after Sub-task 3 to critically evaluate physical assumptions about spectrum continuity and endpoint energy, possibly involving an expert agent or external physics knowledge base to prevent premature consensus on incorrect assumptions. This would help catch fundamental physics errors before final answer selection.'}}]
