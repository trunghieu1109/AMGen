[{'objective': 'Identify and characterize the retrovirus by sequencing its genetic material'}, {'objective': 'Select a specific molecular target (e.g., viral DNA, RNA, or cDNA) suitable for detection'}, {'objective': 'Develop a molecular detection method such as PCR or real-time PCR based on the selected target'}, {'objective': 'Validate the diagnostic kit for sensitivity, specificity, and rapid detection capability'}]
============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- The problem context is an outbreak of a viral infectious disease caused by a retrovirus in a city.
- The goal involves designing a molecular diagnostic kit for quick detection.
- Four choices describe different sequences of steps involving virus identification and diagnostic kit development:
  * Choice 1: Identify virus via DNA sequencing, then develop a PCR kit.
  * Choice 2: Identify IgG antibodies, then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG.
  * Choice 3: Identify virus based on patient symptoms, then design a nested PCR kit.
  * Choice 4: Identify virus via cDNA sequencing, then develop a real-time PCR kit.
- Key entities include the virus, viral genetic material (DNA or cDNA), antibodies (IgG), diagnostic techniques (PCR, nested PCR, real-time PCR, ELISA).

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- Virus identification methods vary: direct genetic sequencing (DNA or cDNA), antibody detection, or symptom-based inference.
- Diagnostic kit types depend on the identification method: PCR-based kits target viral genetic material, ELISA targets host antibodies.
- Constraints include the need for quick and accurate diagnosis, implying sensitivity and specificity considerations.
- The choice of sequencing (DNA vs. cDNA) relates to the retrovirus biology (RNA genome requiring reverse transcription).
- Nested PCR and real-time PCR represent different PCR techniques with varying sensitivity and quantification capabilities.
- Antibody detection (IgG) reflects host immune response, which may have timing implications for detection.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem lies at the intersection of molecular biology, virology, and biotechnology.
- Relevant subfields include molecular diagnostics, immunology (antibody detection), nucleic acid amplification techniques (PCR variants), and bioinformatics (sequencing).
- Applications include clinical diagnostics, epidemiology, public health response, and biomedical research.
- Such problems commonly arise in medical diagnostics development, infectious disease control, and biotechnology innovation.
