============== Task detailed analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- The charge distribution is oscillating and spheroidal in shape, with its symmetry axis along the z-axis.
- Radiation occurs at wavelength λ.
- In the radiation zone (far-field), the radiated power per unit solid angle is a function f(λ, θ), where θ is the angle measured from the z-axis.
- The maximum radiated power is denoted by A.
- The problem asks for the fraction of A radiated at θ = 30° and a possible form of f.
- Four choices are given, each pairing a fraction and a λ-dependent power law.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The spheroidal shape and symmetry axis imply an angular dependence of radiation intensity related to θ.
- The function f(λ, θ) describes how power varies with angle and wavelength, likely reflecting the angular radiation pattern and frequency dependence.
- The maximum power A serves as a normalization factor; the fraction at θ = 30° indicates the relative intensity at that angle.
- The λ-dependence (e.g., λ^{-4}, λ^{-6}, λ^{-3}) suggests how the radiated power scales with wavelength, possibly linked to multipole radiation or scattering phenomena.
- The angular fraction and wavelength dependence together characterize the radiation pattern and spectral behavior.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem lies primarily in classical electrodynamics, specifically radiation from oscillating charge distributions.
- Subfields include electromagnetic theory, antenna theory, and radiation patterns.
- Mathematical concepts involve spherical coordinates, angular distributions, and power laws.
- Such problems are common in physics (radiation theory), electrical engineering (antenna design), and mathematical physics.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The exact functional form of f(λ, θ) is not explicitly given; only possible forms are suggested.
- The nature of the oscillation (frequency, mode) and the spheroid’s dimensions are unspecified.
- The definition of maximum power A (e.g., at which angle) is implied but not explicitly stated.
- The physical origin of the λ-dependence (e.g., dipole vs higher multipole radiation) is not detailed.
- Potential complexity arises from the interplay of geometry, oscillation mode, and radiation characteristics, which may allow multiple interpretations.

============== Evaluation from verifiers ================
[{'verifier_name': 'o4-mini', 'evaluation': {'failure_reason': 'All the agents uncritically assumed that the oscillating spheroidal charge distribution behaves like a simple electric dipole radiator and therefore took f(λ,θ) ∝ sin²θ·λ⁻⁴, leading them to pick choice A.  In fact, a symmetric spheroid oscillation can have zero net dipole moment, making the quadrupole term the leading radiation.  That changes both the θ‐dependence and the λ‐scaling (to λ⁻⁶), so the true answer is choice 2, not A.', 'feedback': '1. Faulty physics assumption in Sub-task 2/4:  None of the agents checked whether the oscillating spheroid actually has a nonzero dipole moment.  They simply imposed the canonical dipole pattern (I∝sin²θ) and dipole scaling (P∝ω⁴⇒λ⁻⁴).  For a symmetric spheroid oscillation, the dipole moment vanishes and the quadrupole term dominates, giving an angular form ∝sin²(2θ) (so at θ=30°, sin²60°=3/4) and a λ⁻⁶ wavelength law.  2. Missing context:  No subtask ever asked “Is the dipole moment zero?” or “What is the lowest nonvanishing multipole?”  Without that, the agents default to dipole radiation even when symmetry forbids it. 3. Over-reliance on consensus:  Multiple agents echoing the same incorrect assumption reinforced A, but no one went back to check the spheroid’s symmetry or leading multipole.', 'suggestion': 'Introduce an explicit Sub-task 2a: “Determine the lowest nonzero multipole moment of the oscillating charge distribution.”  If that subtask shows the dipole moment vanishes, branch to Sub-task 2b: “Derive the angular pattern and wavelength scaling for quadrupole radiation.”  This forces the workflow to test the key physical assumption rather than presuming dipole form.  Also add to the instructions: “Always verify whether the standard dipole approximation applies before applying sin²θ and λ⁻⁴.”'}}, {'verifier_name': 'gpt-4.1-mini', 'evaluation': {'failure_reason': 'The previous reasoning process incorrectly assumed that the angular fraction of radiated power at θ=30° can be directly given by sin²(30°) = 0.25 without properly normalizing over the total radiated power distribution. This led to a misinterpretation of the fraction of maximum power at that angle. Additionally, the wavelength dependence was assumed to be the classical dipole 1/λ⁴ scaling without verifying if the spheroidal geometry or higher multipole contributions might alter this scaling. The final answer failed because it conflated the angular intensity pattern value at a single angle with the fraction of total radiated power at that angle, which are not the same quantities, and overlooked the proper integration over solid angle to find the fraction of total power radiated in that direction.', 'feedback': "The key error in the reasoning process lies in the misunderstanding of what the 'fraction of A radiated at θ=30°' means. The agents equated the normalized angular intensity at θ=30° (sin²(30°) = 0.25) with the fraction of the total radiated power emitted in that direction. However, the radiated power per unit solid angle is an intensity, and the fraction of total power radiated into a small solid angle around θ=30° requires integrating the intensity over that solid angle and then normalizing by the total power (integrated over all solid angles). Simply taking sin²(30°) ignores the solid angle element and the total power distribution. This leads to an over-simplified and incorrect fraction value. Furthermore, the wavelength dependence was assumed to be 1/λ⁴ based on dipole radiation without considering that the spheroidal shape and oscillation mode might introduce higher multipole contributions or resonance effects that modify the wavelength scaling. The context provided was insufficient to confirm that dipole radiation dominates exclusively. The agents did not critically evaluate these assumptions or consider alternative radiation patterns or multipole contributions. The subtasks passed outputs correctly and the collaboration pattern (SC_CoT and Debate) was effective in consolidating consensus but failed to challenge the core assumptions. The error originated primarily in Sub-task 3 (computing the angular fraction) and Sub-task 4 (wavelength dependence), where the reasoning was too simplistic and did not rigorously apply the definitions or physical principles needed. The failure to distinguish between intensity at an angle and fraction of total power radiated at that angle is the root cause. This propagated to Sub-task 5, where the matching of choices was done based on incorrect intermediate results.", 'suggestion': '1) Refine Sub-task 3 to explicitly require calculation of the fraction of total radiated power emitted at θ=30°, which involves integrating the angular power distribution over the relevant solid angle and normalizing by total power, rather than simply evaluating sin²(θ). This will force agents to distinguish between intensity and power fraction properly.\n\n2) Enhance Sub-task 4 to include consideration of possible multipole contributions and resonance effects due to the spheroidal geometry, and to verify whether the dipole approximation and 1/λ⁴ scaling strictly apply. This can be done by adding context or requiring justification of the wavelength dependence based on the physical parameters and modes of oscillation.\n\nAdditionally, consider switching Sub-task 3 and 4 collaboration pattern from SC_CoT to a Debate or Reflexion pattern to encourage critical evaluation of assumptions and alternative interpretations before finalizing answers.'}}]
