['Analyze and Classify Elements: Analyze input data to identify and characterize fundamental components or features of an unknown entity.', 'select elements by criteria conformity: Select a specific target element or attribute from a set of identified components based on defined suitability criteria.', 'Apply Transformation: Design and develop a detection or measurement process based on the selected target element using defined operational methods.', 'Assess, transform, and validate changes: Assess and validate the performance characteristics of a developed process or system against defined effectiveness and efficiency criteria.']
