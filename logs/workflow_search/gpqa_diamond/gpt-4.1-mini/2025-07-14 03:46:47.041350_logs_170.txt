[{'objective': 'Identify the electronic nature and directing effects (activating/deactivating, ortho/para or meta) of each substituent on the benzene ring.'}, {'objective': 'Predict the relative proportions of para-isomer formed for each compound based on substituent directing effects and steric factors.'}, {'objective': 'Estimate the weight fraction of the para-isomer in the monobromo derivatives for each substance.'}, {'objective': 'Arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer based on the predictions.'}]
============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- Six substances are given, each a benzene ring (C6H5) with a different substituent:
  1) C6H5-CH3 (toluene)
  2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (ethyl benzoate)
  3) C6H5-Cl (chlorobenzene)
  4) C6H5-NO2 (nitrobenzene)
  5) C6H5-C2H5 (ethylbenzene)
  6) C6H5-COOH (benzoic acid)
- The reaction is electrophilic substitution with excess bromine, producing only one monobromo derivative per substance.
- The problem focuses on the weight fraction of the para-isomer formed in each case.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The substituents on the benzene ring influence the regioselectivity of electrophilic substitution, directing incoming substituents to ortho, meta, or para positions.
- Electron-donating groups (e.g., CH3, C2H5) are generally ortho/para directing, increasing para-isomer yield.
- Electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., NO2, COOH, COOC2H5) are typically meta directing, reducing para-isomer yield.
- Halogens (e.g., Cl) are deactivating but ortho/para directing.
- The weight fraction of the para-isomer depends on the relative stability and steric hindrance of ortho vs para substitution.
- The problemâ€™s structure implies comparing substituent effects on para-isomer formation to rank the compounds accordingly.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem lies in Organic Chemistry, specifically in the study of aromatic electrophilic substitution reactions.
- It involves concepts of chemical reactivity, substituent effects, and regioselectivity.
- This type of problem is common in chemical education, competitive exams, and research involving reaction mechanisms.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The problem assumes only one monobromo derivative forms, which may oversimplify real mixtures where ortho and para isomers coexist.
- The exact conditions of the reaction (solvent, temperature) are not specified, which can affect isomer distribution.
- The term "weight fraction of the para-isomer" could be ambiguous without specifying if it refers to isolated yield, molar ratio, or chromatographic area.
- Potential challenges include interpreting substituent effects quantitatively and comparing them across different functional groups.
