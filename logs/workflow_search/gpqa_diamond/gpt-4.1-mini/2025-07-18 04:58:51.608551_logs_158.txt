============== Task detailed analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- Observations pertain to a quasar's electromagnetic spectrum, specifically near infrared and optical wavelengths.
- There is a spectral peak at approximately 790 nm.
- At wavelengths shorter than 790 nm, the flux decreases significantly.
- Cosmological model parameters are given: Hubble constant H_0 = 70 km s^-1 Mpc^-1, matter density parameter Ω_m = 0.3, dark energy density parameter Ω_Λ = 0.7, and the universe is flat (implying Ω_k = 0).
- The scale factor a = 1 corresponds to the present epoch.
- The question concerns the comoving distance of the quasar from Earth.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The observed peak wavelength (790 nm) and the flux drop at shorter wavelengths suggest a redshifted spectral feature, implying the quasar's redshift z can be inferred from the observed wavelength relative to its rest-frame emission.
- The cosmological parameters define the expansion history of the universe, which determines the relationship between redshift and comoving distance.
- Flatness (Ω_k = 0) simplifies the cosmological distance calculations.
- The comoving distance depends on integrating the inverse Hubble parameter over redshift, which is a function of Ω_m, Ω_Λ, and H_0.
- The spectral data and cosmological model together allow estimation of the quasar's redshift and thus its comoving distance.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem lies in cosmology, a subfield of astrophysics.
- It involves observational astronomy (spectroscopy), cosmological distance measures, and the Lambda-CDM cosmological model.
- Relevant mathematical concepts include cosmological redshift, scale factor, and integration of cosmological parameters.
- Applications include understanding large-scale structure, galaxy/quasar distances, and universe expansion.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The rest-frame wavelength corresponding to the spectral peak is not explicitly given, making direct redshift calculation ambiguous.
- The exact method to relate the observed wavelength peak to redshift is assumed but not stated.
- The problem does not specify if the peak corresponds to a known emission line or continuum feature.
- The choice of comoving distance values (6,7,8,9 Gpc) suggests approximate estimation rather than precise calculation.
- Potential challenges include interpreting the spectral data without rest-frame reference and integrating cosmological parameters accurately.
