1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- Two starting materials: (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene.
- Each alkene is treated with one equivalent of mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid), an epoxidizing agent, followed by aqueous acid.
- Both reactions proceed to 100% completion.
- The products from both reactions are combined into one mixture.
- The mixture is analyzed by two types of HPLC columns: a standard (achiral) reverse-phase column and a chiral HPLC column.
- The chromatographic resolution is assumed to be as high as theoretically possible.

Properties of entities:
- (E)- and (Z)-oct-4-ene are geometric isomers differing in alkene stereochemistry.
- Epoxidation with mCPBA typically forms epoxides stereospecifically, preserving stereochemistry.
- Acidic workup may open epoxides or affect stereochemistry, but the problem implies stable products.
- HPLC columns differ in their ability to separate enantiomers: achiral columns separate based on physical properties, chiral columns can separate enantiomers.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The (E)- and (Z)-alkenes yield different stereoisomeric epoxides due to their distinct alkene geometry.
- Each reaction likely produces a pair of stereoisomers (enantiomers or diastereomers) depending on the stereochemical outcome.
- Combining products results in a mixture containing multiple stereoisomers.
- Achiral HPLC can separate diastereomers but not enantiomers; chiral HPLC can separate both.
- The number of peaks observed depends on how many stereoisomers are present and whether they are enantiomers or diastereomers.
- The constraints (100% completion, ideal resolution) imply all stereoisomers present will be resolved if possible.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- Organic Chemistry, specifically stereochemistry and reaction mechanisms.
- Analytical Chemistry, focusing on chromatographic separation techniques.
- Concepts involved include stereoisomerism (E/Z isomerism, enantiomers, diastereomers), epoxidation reactions, and chiral vs. achiral chromatography.
- Applications include stereochemical analysis in synthetic chemistry, pharmaceutical purity assessment, and chiral separations.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The exact stereochemical outcome of the epoxidation and acidic workup is not explicitly detailed (e.g., whether epoxides open or remain intact).
- The nature of the products (whether they are enantiomers or diastereomers) is implied but not fully specified.
- Potential complexity arises if acid treatment causes rearrangements or ring openings, affecting stereochemistry.
- The problem assumes ideal chromatographic resolution, which may not reflect practical limitations.
- The exact number of stereoisomers formed from each starting alkene is not explicitly stated, requiring assumptions based on typical reaction stereochemistry.
