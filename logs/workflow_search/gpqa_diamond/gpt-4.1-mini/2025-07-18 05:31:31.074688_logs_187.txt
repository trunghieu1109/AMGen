============== Task detailed analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- The crystal is rhombohedral, meaning all edges are equal in length and all angles between edges are equal but not 90 degrees.
- Interatomic distance (edge length of the rhombohedron) is 10 Angstrom.
- Angles between edges: \( \alpha = \beta = \gamma = 30^{\circ} \).
- The plane of interest is the (111) plane, specified by Miller indices.
- Four multiple-choice options for the interplanar distance are provided.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The rhombohedral lattice is defined by edge length \(a = 10 \) Å and angle \( \alpha = 30^{\circ} \).
- The interplanar spacing \(d_{hkl}\) depends on the lattice parameters and the Miller indices \((hkl)\).
- The (111) plane corresponds to a specific set of lattice planes intersecting the crystal axes.
- The equal angles and edge lengths impose symmetry and simplify the formula for \(d_{111}\).
- The problem likely requires applying the formula for interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral lattice, which involves \(a\), \(\alpha\), and \((hkl)\).

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem lies in the domain of solid state physics and crystallography.
- It involves concepts from 3D geometry, lattice theory, and materials science.
- Relevant subfields include crystallographic lattice geometry and diffraction theory.
- Such problems commonly appear in materials science, physics, and mathematical competitions involving geometry.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The term "interatomic distance" is assumed to be the lattice parameter \(a\), but this should be explicitly confirmed.
- The exact formula or method to compute interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral lattice is not provided.
- The orientation and definition of the (111) plane in the rhombohedral system might require clarification.
- Potential complexity arises from the non-orthogonal angles (30°), which complicate direct computation.
- No information is given about units consistency or whether the angles are internal lattice angles or external.
- The problem assumes familiarity with Miller indices in non-cubic lattices, which can be ambiguous.
