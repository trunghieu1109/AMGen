[{'objective': 'Convert the given abundance ratios ([Si/Fe], [Mg/Si], [Fe/H], [Mg/H]) for both stars into absolute logarithmic abundances of Si, Fe, and Mg relative to hydrogen using the solar photospheric composition.'}, {'objective': 'Calculate the silicon number density relative to hydrogen (nSi/nH) for Star_1 and Star_2 based on the derived absolute abundances.'}, {'objective': 'Compute the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 to Star_2 by dividing their silicon number densities.'}]
