[{'objective': 'Identify chiral centers or stereogenic elements in each compound'}, {'objective': 'Assess the presence or absence of internal planes of symmetry or meso forms that negate optical activity'}, {'objective': 'Evaluate the stereochemical configuration to confirm optical activity'}, {'objective': 'Count the total number of compounds that exhibit optical activity'}]
