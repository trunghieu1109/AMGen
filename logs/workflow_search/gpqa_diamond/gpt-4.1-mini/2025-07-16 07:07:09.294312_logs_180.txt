1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- The Sun produces a very large flux of neutrinos, measured as number per cm² per second at Earth.
- Hypothetically, the pp-III branch of solar fusion reactions stopped about 8.5 minutes ago (approximately the neutrino travel time from Sun to Earth).
- All other solar fusion reactions (pp-I, pp-II, and others) continue unchanged.
- Two neutrino energy bands are considered: band 1 (700-800 keV) and band 2 (800-900 keV).
- The problem asks for the approximate ratio of fluxes: Flux(band 1) / Flux(band 2).
- Flavor changes of neutrinos are stated to be irrelevant for this problem.

Properties of entities:
- The pp-III branch is one of the branches in the proton-proton chain reaction in the Sun, producing neutrinos with characteristic energy spectra.
- Neutrino fluxes at Earth reflect the production rates in the solar core, delayed by the neutrino travel time (~8.5 minutes).

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The pp-III branch contributes neutrinos primarily in a certain energy range, likely overlapping with one or both given energy bands.
- Stopping the pp-III branch would reduce or eliminate neutrinos originating from that branch, affecting the flux in the energy bands where pp-III neutrinos appear.
- Since other branches continue, neutrinos from those branches still contribute to the flux in both bands.
- The 8.5-minute delay corresponds to the neutrino travel time, so the flux measured now reflects the solar core state 8.5 minutes ago.
- The ratio Flux(band 1) / Flux(band 2) depends on how the pp-III branch neutrinos populate these energy bands relative to other branches.
- The problem’s constraints (no flavor change effect) simplify the analysis to raw flux contributions.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem lies in astrophysics and particle physics, specifically solar neutrino physics.
- It involves nuclear fusion processes in stellar interiors and neutrino energy spectra.
- Relevant subfields include nuclear astrophysics, neutrino physics, and solar physics.
- Such problems arise in contexts like neutrino detection experiments, solar modeling, and theoretical astrophysics.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The exact neutrino energy spectra and flux contributions from each pp chain branch are not provided, requiring external knowledge or assumptions.
- The problem assumes the pp-III branch stopped abruptly and completely, which is a hypothetical scenario.
- The precise overlap of pp-III neutrino energies with the given bands is not explicitly stated.
- The problem does not specify whether the fluxes are total or electron neutrino fluxes, though flavor changes are said to be irrelevant.
- Potential complexity arises from the mixture of neutrino sources in each energy band and their relative flux magnitudes.
- No information on detector response or measurement uncertainties is given, implying a theoretical ratio based on production rates.
