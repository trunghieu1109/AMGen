============== Task detailed analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- The problem provides four options of effective particles: Magnon, Skyrmion, Pion, and Phonon.
- The key condition is whether each particle is associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry.
- No numerical values or explicit equations are given.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- Magnons are quasiparticles representing collective spin wave excitations in magnetic systems, typically arising due to spontaneous breaking of spin rotational symmetry.
- Skyrmions are topological solitons in field theories and condensed matter, often related to nontrivial spin textures; their connection to symmetry breaking is more subtle and depends on context.
- Pions are mesons interpreted as Nambu-Goldstone bosons resulting from spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in quantum chromodynamics.
- Phonons are quantized lattice vibrations in crystals, generally associated with the breaking of continuous translational symmetry due to the discrete lattice structure.
- The condition of spontaneous symmetry breaking implies the existence of Nambu-Goldstone modes or collective excitations tied to broken continuous symmetries.
- Understanding which particles correspond to such modes is crucial to classify their association with spontaneous symmetry breaking.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem lies primarily in theoretical and condensed matter physics, intersecting with quantum field theory.
- Relevant subfields include particle physics (pions), condensed matter physics (magnons, phonons, skyrmions), and symmetry breaking phenomena.
- Concepts involved include spontaneous symmetry breaking, Nambu-Goldstone bosons, topological excitations, and quasiparticles.
- Such problems are common in advanced physics education, research, and competitions involving particle and condensed matter physics.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The term "effective particle" could be interpreted differently depending on context (e.g., quasiparticle vs fundamental particle).
- The nature of the symmetry considered (continuous vs discrete, global vs local) is not explicitly stated.
- The role of skyrmions in symmetry breaking can vary, potentially causing ambiguity.
- The problem does not specify the physical system or dimensionality, which might affect the classification.
- No explicit definitions or assumptions about the symmetries involved are provided, which could lead to multiple interpretations.
