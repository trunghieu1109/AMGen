============== Task detailed analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- Total cobalt concentration: c(Co) = 10^-2 M.
- Thiocyanate ion concentration: [SCN^-] = 0.1 M.
- Stability constants (cumulative) for cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes:
  β1 = 9 (for Co(SCN)^+),
  β2 = 40 (for Co(SCN)_2),
  β3 = 63 (for Co(SCN)_3^-),
  β4 = 16 (for Co(SCN)_4^{2-}).
- The problem references the 'blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex,' which corresponds to the species with two SCN^- ligands, i.e., Co(SCN)_2.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The total cobalt concentration is distributed among free Co(II) ions and various cobalt-thiocyanato complexes.
- The stability constants β_n represent cumulative formation constants for complexes with n SCN^- ligands, indicating the equilibrium constants for stepwise complexation.
- The concentration of each complex species depends on the free Co(II) concentration, free SCN^- concentration, and the respective β_n values.
- The percentage of the dithiocyanato complex is the ratio of its concentration to the total cobalt concentration, multiplied by 100.
- The relatively high SCN^- concentration (0.1 M) compared to Co(II) (10^-2 M) suggests significant complex formation.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem lies within Analytical Chemistry and Chemical Equilibria.
- It involves concepts from Coordination Chemistry, specifically complex ion equilibria.
- Mathematically, it relates to equilibrium calculations using stability constants, involving algebraic manipulation and possibly solving polynomial equations.
- Such problems are common in chemical analysis, solution chemistry, and are often encountered in chemistry competitions or academic coursework.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The problem does not specify whether the given β values are cumulative or stepwise constants; the notation suggests cumulative, but confirmation would be helpful.
- The charge states of the complexes are not explicitly given, which might affect equilibrium expressions.
- The problem assumes that the SCN^- concentration remains effectively constant, implying no significant depletion by complexation; this assumption should be stated.
- The exact definition or identification of the 'blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex' is assumed to be Co(SCN)_2, but this should be explicitly confirmed.
- Potential challenges include determining free Co(II) concentration and applying the correct equilibrium expressions to find species distribution.
