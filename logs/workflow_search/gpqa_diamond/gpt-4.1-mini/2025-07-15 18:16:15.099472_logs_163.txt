[{'objective': 'Extract orbital periods and radial velocity amplitudes for both binary star systems from the observations'}, {'objective': "Calculate the total mass of each binary system using the orbital periods and radial velocity amplitudes applying Kepler's third law and the binary mass function"}, {'objective': 'Sum the masses of the two stars in each system to find the total system mass'}, {'objective': 'Compute the ratio of the total mass of system_1 to that of system_2 to determine the mass factor'}]
