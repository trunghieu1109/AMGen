============== Task detailed analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- The charge distribution is spheroidal, symmetric about the z-axis.
- It oscillates and radiates electromagnetic power at wavelength λ.
- The radiated power per unit solid angle in the far-field (radiation zone) is given by a function f(λ, θ), where θ is the angle with respect to the z-axis.
- The maximum radiated power is denoted by A.
- The problem asks for the fraction of A radiated at θ = 30° and a possible form of f.
- Four choices are given, each pairing a fraction and a λ-dependent power law.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The spheroidal shape and symmetry axis imply angular dependence of radiation intensity, likely involving spherical coordinates with θ measured from the symmetry axis.
- The function f(λ, θ) represents angular distribution and wavelength dependence of radiated power per unit solid angle.
- The maximum power A serves as a normalization constant; the fraction at θ = 30° indicates the relative intensity at that angle.
- The λ-dependence (e.g., λ^{-4}, λ^{-6}, λ^{-3}) suggests a power-law scaling of radiation intensity with wavelength, possibly related to multipole radiation or scattering phenomena.
- The angular dependence and wavelength scaling are interconnected, reflecting physical constraints such as dipole or higher multipole radiation patterns.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- Electromagnetic theory, specifically radiation from oscillating charge distributions.
- Classical electrodynamics and antenna theory.
- Mathematical physics involving spherical harmonics and angular distributions.
- Potential applications in physics (radiation patterns), electrical engineering (antenna design), and applied mathematics.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The explicit functional form of f(λ, θ) is not given; only possible forms are suggested.
- The nature of the oscillation (frequency, mode) and the exact spheroid parameters are unspecified.
- The meaning of 'fraction of A' at θ = 30° could be interpreted as normalized intensity or power per unit solid angle; this should be clarified.
- The problem does not specify whether the maximum power A occurs at a particular angle or wavelength.
- The physical origin of the λ-dependence (e.g., Rayleigh scattering, dipole radiation) is not detailed, which affects interpretation.

This led them to settle on 1/4 and λ⁻⁴, which contradicts the professor’s corrected answer.', 'feedback': 'The root mistake was in Sub-task 2 and Sub-task 3: rather than deriving the multipole content of a spheroidal oscillation, every agent imposed the ‘textbook dipole’ pattern (sin²θ, λ⁻⁴).  No one examined whether the spheroid’s symmetry axis oscillation actually produces a dominant quadrupole (or higher) component or a shifted angular maximum.  Consequently, every downstream subtask simply propagated that unfounded dipole assumption.  Because the actual radiation pattern and λ-scaling differ for a non-point charge spheroid, the fraction at θ=30° and the power-law exponent were both wrong.  Additionally, the subtasks never challenged or re-validated the basic physical assumption (dipole vs quadrupole), so groupthink cemented the incorrect path.', 'suggestion': 'Introduce an early subtask to compute or at least justify from first principles which multipole term dominates for a spheroidal oscillating charge (e.g. expand the spheroid’s oscillating charge density in spherical harmonics).  Require agents to derive the angular factor and λ-dependence before choosing from options.  Use a ‘Verification’ agent or a ‘Counterexample’ pattern immediately after the multipole derivation to test both dipole and quadrupole hypotheses.  Pass the mathematically derived form f(λ,θ) explicitly into the angular-dependence and wavelength-scaling subtasks, so they cannot simply re-assume the dipole law without justification.'}}, {'verifier_name': 'gpt-4.1-mini', 'evaluation': {'failure_reason': 'The previous reasoning process incorrectly assumed that the maximum radiated power per unit solid angle (A) occurs at θ = 90°, and that the angular dependence of the radiation pattern is purely dipole-like (sin²θ). This led to selecting the fraction at θ = 30° as sin²(30°) = 1/4 and the wavelength dependence as λ^{-4}, matching choice C. However, the problem involves a spheroidal charge distribution, which can produce more complex angular radiation patterns than a simple dipole, and the maximum power A may not necessarily be at θ = 90°. The assumption of a pure dipole pattern and the direct use of sin²θ for angular dependence without verifying the actual radiation pattern for a spheroidal distribution caused the final answer to be incorrect according to professor feedback.', 'feedback': "The main flaw in the reasoning was the uncritical application of the dipole radiation pattern (sin²θ) to a spheroidal oscillating charge distribution without considering that the spheroidal geometry can alter the angular distribution of radiated power. The agents assumed the maximum power per unit solid angle A occurs at θ = 90°, which is true for a simple dipole but not necessarily for a spheroid. This led to calculating the fraction at θ = 30° as sin²(30°) = 1/4, which matched choice C. However, the problem statement does not specify the mode of oscillation or the exact radiation pattern, and the spheroidal shape can produce anisotropic radiation patterns with maxima at different angles. Additionally, the wavelength dependence was assumed to be λ^{-4} based on dipole radiation scaling, but the problem's spheroidal geometry and oscillation mode could lead to different multipole contributions and thus different wavelength scalings. The error originated in Sub-task 2 and Sub-task 4 where the angular dependence was oversimplified and the maximum power angle was fixed without justification. The context lacked explicit information about the oscillation mode and the actual radiation pattern, which was not compensated for in the reasoning. The agents did not sufficiently question or analyze the assumptions about angular dependence and maximum power location, leading to a confident but incorrect final answer.", 'suggestion': '1. Refine Sub-task 2 and Sub-task 4 instructions to explicitly require verification or derivation of the angular radiation pattern for a spheroidal oscillating charge distribution rather than assuming a dipole pattern. Include prompts to consider possible multipole contributions and how the spheroidal geometry affects angular maxima.\n\n2. Improve context passing between subtasks by including intermediate results or references to physical models of spheroidal radiation patterns, or by requesting agents to explicitly state and justify assumptions about the location of maximum power A and angular dependence before proceeding.\n\n3. Change the collaboration pattern for Sub-task 4 from Reflexion to a more robust Debate or SC_CoT pattern to encourage critical evaluation of assumptions and alternative angular dependencies, reducing premature convergence on dipole assumptions.\n\nThese steps will help avoid oversimplification, ensure assumptions are justified, and improve the accuracy of the final integrated answer.'}}]
