1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- Total cobalt concentration: c(Co) = 10^-2 M.
- Thiocyanate ion concentration: [SCN-] = 0.1 M.
- Stability constants for cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes: β1 = 9, β2 = 40, β3 = 63, β4 = 16.
- The complexes correspond to cobalt coordinated with 1 to 4 SCN- ligands.
- The 'blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex' refers to the species with two SCN- ligands bound to Co(II).

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The β values represent the overall stability constants for the formation of Co(SCN)_n^(2-n) complexes from free Co(II) and SCN- ions.
- The total cobalt concentration is distributed among free Co(II) ions and complexes with 1 to 4 SCN- ligands.
- The concentration of each complex depends on the product of the free Co(II) concentration, the SCN- concentration raised to the power n, and the corresponding β_n.
- The sum of all species concentrations equals the total cobalt concentration.
- The percentage of the dithiocyanato complex is the ratio of its concentration to the total cobalt concentration, multiplied by 100.
- The given β values influence the equilibrium distribution and thus the relative abundance of each complex.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem belongs to analytical chemistry and chemical equilibrium.
- It involves coordination chemistry, specifically complex ion formation equilibria.
- Concepts include stability constants, species distribution, and equilibrium calculations.
- Such problems are common in physical chemistry, chemical analysis, and related fields.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- Whether the β values are cumulative (overall) or stepwise stability constants is not explicitly stated.
- The exact charge and formula of the complexes are not given but can be inferred.
- The problem assumes the blue complex is the one with two SCN- ligands, but this is not explicitly defined.
- The ionic strength and activity coefficients are not mentioned, which may affect equilibrium.
- Potential complexity arises from multiple equilibria and the need to solve for free Co(II) concentration.
- No information on competing equilibria or side reactions is provided.
