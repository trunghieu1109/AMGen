============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- The system's state at time t is given by the column matrix \( \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \).
- The observable is represented by the matrix operator \( P \) with elements:
  \[
  P = \begin{pmatrix}
  0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
  0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
  \end{pmatrix}
  \]
- The problem involves calculating the probability that a measurement of the observable yields the eigenvalue 0 at time t.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The state vector represents the system's state in a 3-dimensional Hilbert space.
- The observable \( P \) is a Hermitian operator (implied by the symmetric matrix), whose eigenvalues correspond to possible measurement outcomes.
- The probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue (here, 0) is related to the projection of the state vector onto the eigenspace associated with that eigenvalue.
- The matrix elements and the state vector components are interconnected through inner products and projections.
- The condition of measuring 0 corresponds to projecting the state onto the eigenspace of \( P \) with eigenvalue 0, which influences the calculation of the probability.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem lies in the domain of linear algebra and quantum mechanics.
- Subfields involved include quantum state vectors, Hermitian operators, eigenvalue problems, and measurement postulates in quantum theory.
- Such problems commonly arise in quantum physics, quantum computing, and mathematical physics, as well as in advanced mathematical competitions.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The state vector is given without normalization; it is unclear if normalization is assumed or required.
- The observable matrix is given explicitly, but the eigenvalues and eigenvectors are not provided, which are essential for computing probabilities.
- The problem assumes familiarity with the quantum measurement postulate and how to extract probabilities from state and operator data.
- Potential challenges include computing eigenvalues/eigenvectors of \( P \) and projecting the state vector accordingly, which may involve nontrivial algebraic manipulation.
