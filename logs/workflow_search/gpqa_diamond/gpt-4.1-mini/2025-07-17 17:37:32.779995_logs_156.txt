[{'objective': 'Identify and characterize the retrovirus by sequencing its genetic material'}, {'objective': 'Select a specific molecular target (e.g., viral DNA, RNA, or cDNA) suitable for detection'}, {'objective': 'Develop a molecular detection method such as PCR or real-time PCR based on the selected target'}, {'objective': 'Validate the diagnostic kit for sensitivity, specificity, and rapid detection capability'}]
============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- The problem context is an outbreak of a viral infectious disease caused by a retrovirus in a city.
- The goal is to design a molecular diagnostic kit for quick detection.
- Four choices are provided, each describing a sequence of steps:
  * Choice 1: Identify virus via DNA sequencing, then develop a PCR kit.
  * Choice 2: Identify IgG antibodies, then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG.
  * Choice 3: Identify virus based on symptoms from patients, then design a nested PCR kit.
  * Choice 4: Identify virus by cDNA sequencing, then develop a real-time PCR kit.
- Key entities include the virus, viral genetic material (DNA or cDNA), antibodies (IgG), diagnostic methods (PCR, nested PCR, real-time PCR, ELISA).

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- Identification methods vary: direct genetic sequencing (DNA or cDNA), antibody detection, or symptom-based inference.
- Diagnostic kits correspond to identification: PCR-based kits rely on nucleic acid detection; ELISA targets antibodies.
- Constraints include speed and accuracy of diagnosis.
- The choice of sequencing (DNA vs. cDNA) relates to the retrovirus nature (RNA virus requiring reverse transcription).
- Symptom-based identification is indirect and may affect specificity.
- Nested PCR and real-time PCR are advanced PCR techniques with different sensitivities and complexities.
- These components influence the diagnostic approach's reliability, speed, and feasibility.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- Primary domain: Molecular biology and biotechnology.
- Subfields: Virology, diagnostic assay development, molecular diagnostics.
- Techniques involved: DNA/RNA sequencing, PCR (polymerase chain reaction), ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay).
- Applications: Clinical diagnostics, infectious disease control, public health.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The problem does not specify the viral genome type explicitly (DNA or RNA), which affects sequencing choice.
- The reliability of symptom-based virus identification is ambiguous.
- The timeline and resource constraints for kit development are not stated.
- The sensitivity and specificity requirements for the diagnostic kit are not detailed.
- It is unclear whether antibody detection is suitable for early infection stages.
- Potential challenges include differentiating between active infection and past exposure (especially for antibody-based tests) and the technical feasibility of each method in the given context.
