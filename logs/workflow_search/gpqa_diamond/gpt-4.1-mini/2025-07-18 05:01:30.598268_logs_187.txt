============== Task detailed analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- The crystal system is rhombohedral.
- Interatomic distance (lattice parameter) is 10 Angstrom.
- The lattice angles are equal: \( \alpha = \beta = \gamma = 30^{\circ} \).
- The plane of interest is the (111) plane, specified by Miller indices.
- Four possible values for the interplanar distance are given: 9.54 Å, 8.95 Å, 9.08 Å, and 10.05 Å.

Properties:
- Rhombohedral lattice: all edges equal in length, all angles equal but not 90°.
- The interplanar spacing depends on lattice parameters and Miller indices.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The interplanar distance for a given (hkl) plane in a rhombohedral lattice depends on the lattice parameter and the angle between lattice vectors.
- The equal angles and equal edge lengths define the unit cell geometry, influencing the reciprocal lattice and thus the interplanar spacing.
- The (111) plane is a specific crystallographic plane whose spacing is derived from the lattice geometry.
- The given angles being 30° (much less than 90°) imply a highly skewed unit cell, affecting the calculation of interplanar distances.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem lies in the domain of solid state physics and crystallography.
- Subfields include crystallographic geometry, lattice theory, and materials science.
- Mathematical concepts involved include 3D geometry, vector algebra, and lattice plane calculations.
- Such problems are common in materials characterization, X-ray diffraction analysis, and crystallographic studies.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The term "interatomic distance" is used; it is assumed to be the lattice parameter (edge length) of the rhombohedral cell, but this could be ambiguous.
- The exact definition of the lattice parameters (whether the given distance corresponds to the rhombohedral edge length or another measure) is not explicitly stated.
- The orientation and definition of the (111) plane in the rhombohedral system may require clarification, as Miller indices can differ in rhombohedral vs. cubic systems.
- Potential complexity arises from the non-orthogonal angles, which complicate the formula for interplanar spacing.
- No explicit formula or method is provided, so assumptions about standard crystallographic conventions are necessary.
