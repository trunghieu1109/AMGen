============== Task detailed analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- The system state at time t is a column matrix (vector) with elements (-1, 2, 1).
- The observable is represented by a 3x3 matrix operator P with rows:
  Row 1: (0, 1/√2, 0)
  Row 2: (1/√2, 0, 1/√2)
  Row 3: (0, 1/√2, 0)
- The problem involves calculating the probability that a measurement of the observable yields the eigenvalue 0.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The state vector represents the system's state in a 3-dimensional Hilbert space.
- The observable P is a Hermitian operator (implied by the symmetric structure), whose eigenvalues correspond to possible measurement outcomes.
- The probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue (here, 0) is given by the squared magnitude of the projection of the state vector onto the eigenspace associated with that eigenvalue.
- The matrix elements and state vector components are interconnected through linear algebraic operations such as eigen-decomposition and inner products.
- The condition of measuring eigenvalue 0 implies identifying the eigenspace of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0 and projecting the state vector onto it.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem lies in the domain of linear algebra and quantum mechanics.
- Subfields involved include quantum state representation, operator theory, and spectral decomposition.
- Such problems commonly arise in quantum physics, quantum computing, and mathematical physics, as well as in advanced mathematical competitions.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The problem does not explicitly state whether the state vector is normalized; normalization may be required.
- It is not specified whether the matrix P is Hermitian, though the symmetry suggests it is; confirmation would be helpful.
- The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P are not provided, so determining the eigenspace for eigenvalue 0 requires computation.
- The problem assumes familiarity with quantum measurement postulates and probability calculations from state projections.
- Potential challenges include computing eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P and projecting the given state vector accordingly.
