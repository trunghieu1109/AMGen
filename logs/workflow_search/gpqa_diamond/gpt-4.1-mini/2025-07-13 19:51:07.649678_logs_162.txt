============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- Numerical values: 0.1 g of Fe(OH)3, total solution volume of 100 cm³, temperature at 25°C, acid concentration 0.1 M (monobasic strong acid).
- Chemical species: Fe(OH)3 (iron(III) hydroxide), a sparingly soluble base; a monobasic strong acid (fully dissociated, providing H+ ions).
- Conditions: Dissolution of Fe(OH)3 in acidic medium to prepare a solution of total volume 100 cm³.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- Fe(OH)3 is a weakly soluble hydroxide that requires acid to dissolve by neutralizing OH- ions.
- The amount of acid needed depends on the stoichiometry of the neutralization reaction and the solubility equilibrium of Fe(OH)3.
- The pH of the resulting solution depends on the excess H+ ions after dissolution and neutralization.
- The minimum volume of acid corresponds to the amount sufficient to dissolve all Fe(OH)3 without excess acid beyond that needed for neutralization.
- The total volume constraint (100 cm³) implies that the acid volume plus water and dissolved species sum to this volume.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- Chemistry (Analytical Chemistry, Physical Chemistry).
- Concepts involved: Acid-base equilibria, solubility equilibria, pH calculation, stoichiometry.
- Applications: Solution preparation, titration, chemical analysis.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The exact dissolution reaction and equilibrium constants (e.g., Ksp of Fe(OH)3) are not provided.
- Whether the volume of acid added is included in the total 100 cm³ or added to it is implied but not explicitly stated.
- Assumptions about complete dissociation of the strong acid and temperature effects on solubility.
- Potential complexity in calculating pH due to simultaneous equilibria and ionic strength effects.
- Multiple-choice answers suggest discrete possible outcomes, but the method to select among them is not detailed.
