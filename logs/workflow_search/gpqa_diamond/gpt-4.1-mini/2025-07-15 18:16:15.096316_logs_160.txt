[{'objective': 'Understand the definition and calculation of the mean free path λ1 for gas molecules in ultra-high vacuum conditions based on pressure, temperature, and volume.'}, {'objective': 'Analyze how the presence of an electron beam and electron scattering with gas molecules affects the effective mean free path λ2 compared to λ1.'}, {'objective': 'Compare λ2 and λ1 to determine the expected relationship between them considering electron scattering effects at constant temperature.'}, {'objective': 'Conclude which of the given choices correctly describes the relationship between λ2 and λ1 based on the physical analysis.'}]
