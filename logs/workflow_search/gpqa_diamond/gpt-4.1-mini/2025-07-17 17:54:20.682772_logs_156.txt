============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- The problem context is an outbreak of a viral infectious disease caused by a retrovirus in a city.
- The goal involves designing a molecular diagnostic kit for quick detection.
- Four choices are provided, each describing a sequence of steps:
  * Choice 1: Identify virus via DNA sequencing, then develop a PCR kit.
  * Choice 2: Identify IgG antibodies, then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG.
  * Choice 3: Identify virus based on symptoms, then design a nested PCR kit.
  * Choice 4: Identify virus via cDNA sequencing, then develop a real-time PCR kit.
- Key entities include the virus, viral genetic material (DNA or cDNA), antibodies (IgG), diagnostic methods (PCR, nested PCR, real-time PCR, ELISA).

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- Identification methods vary: direct genetic sequencing (DNA or cDNA), antibody detection, or symptom-based inference.
- Diagnostic kits correspond to identification: PCR-based kits rely on nucleic acid detection; ELISA targets antibodies.
- Constraints include speed and accuracy of diagnosis.
- The choice of sequencing (DNA vs. cDNA) relates to the retrovirus biology (RNA virus requiring reverse transcription).
- Symptom-based identification is indirect and may affect specificity.
- Nested PCR and real-time PCR represent different PCR techniques with varying sensitivity and quantification capabilities.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- Relevant domains include molecular biology, virology, and biotechnology.
- Subfields: molecular diagnostics, immunology (antibody detection), nucleic acid amplification techniques.
- Applications: infectious disease diagnostics, public health response, clinical laboratory testing.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The problem does not specify the viral genome type explicitly (RNA or DNA), which affects sequencing choice.
- The reliability of symptom-based identification is ambiguous.
- The timeline and resource constraints for kit development are not stated.
- The sensitivity and specificity requirements for the diagnostic kit are not detailed.
- It is unclear whether antibody detection is suitable for early infection stages.
- The problem does not clarify if the goal is to detect active infection or past exposure.

============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- The problem context is an outbreak of a viral infectious disease caused by a retrovirus.
- The goal is to design a molecular diagnostic kit for quick detection.
- Four choices are given, each describing a sequence of steps:
  * Choice 1: Identify virus by DNA sequencing, then develop a PCR kit.
  * Choice 2: Identify IgG antibodies, then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG.
  * Choice 3: Identify virus using symptom information, then design a nested PCR kit.
  * Choice 4: Identify virus by cDNA sequencing, then develop a real-time PCR kit.
- Key entities: virus identification methods (DNA sequencing, cDNA sequencing, symptom-based identification, antibody detection), diagnostic methods (PCR, nested PCR, real-time PCR, ELISA).

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- Virus identification is the initial step, which informs the design of the diagnostic kit.
- DNA sequencing and cDNA sequencing relate to direct genetic analysis of the virus; symptom-based identification is indirect.
- Antibody detection (IgG) targets host immune response rather than the virus itself.
- PCR-based methods amplify viral genetic material for detection; ELISA detects antibodies.
- Constraints include speed and accuracy of diagnosis.
- The choice of identification method influences the type of diagnostic kit developed.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- Relevant domains: Molecular biology, virology, biotechnology.
- Subfields: Diagnostic assay development, molecular diagnostics, immunology.
- Applications: Public health response, clinical diagnostics, infectious disease control.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The problem does not specify whether the virus is RNA or DNA based, which affects sequencing choice.
- The reliability of symptom-based identification is ambiguous.
- The timing of antibody production (IgG) relative to infection onset is not stated, which impacts ELISA effectiveness.
- The problem does not clarify resource availability or constraints (e.g., lab facilities, time).
- Potential challenges include differentiating between direct viral detection and indirect antibody detection, and the suitability of nested PCR versus real-time PCR in this context.
