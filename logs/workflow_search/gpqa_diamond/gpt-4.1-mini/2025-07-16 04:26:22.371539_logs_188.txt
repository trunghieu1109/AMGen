============== Task detailed analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- The problem provides four choices of (effective) particles: Magnon, Skyrmion, Pion, and Phonon.
- Each particle is considered in the context of spontaneous symmetry breaking.
- No numerical values or explicit equations are given.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- Magnons are quasiparticles representing collective spin wave excitations in magnetically ordered systems, typically arising due to spontaneous breaking of spin rotational symmetry.
- Skyrmions are topological solitons or particle-like configurations in field theories, often related to nontrivial topology rather than directly to spontaneous symmetry breaking.
- Pions are mesons that can be interpreted as Nambu-Goldstone bosons resulting from spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in quantum chromodynamics.
- Phonons are quantized lattice vibrations in crystals, generally associated with the breaking of continuous translational symmetry to discrete lattice symmetry.
- The problem implicitly tests understanding of which particles emerge as a consequence of spontaneous symmetry breaking and which do not.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem lies primarily in theoretical and condensed matter physics, with connections to particle physics.
- Relevant subfields include quantum field theory, condensed matter physics, and symmetry breaking phenomena.
- Concepts involved include spontaneous symmetry breaking, Nambu-Goldstone bosons, topological excitations, and quasiparticles.
- Such problems are common in advanced physics education, research, and competitions.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The term "effective particles" could be ambiguous without specifying the physical context (e.g., condensed matter vs. particle physics).
- The nature of the symmetry (global, local, continuous, discrete) involved in each case is not explicitly stated.
- The problem assumes familiarity with the concept of spontaneous symmetry breaking and its relation to these particles.
- Potential challenge lies in distinguishing topological objects (Skyrmions) from Nambu-Goldstone modes and phonons in terms of symmetry breaking.

Every agent assumed phonons are ordinary lattice vibrations independent of any broken symmetry. In fact, the formation of a crystal lattice spontaneously breaks continuous translational invariance down to a discrete subgroup, and phonons are precisely the resulting Nambu–Goldstone modes. Because this key link was never challenged or checked, the entire downstream reasoning and final answer remained incorrect.', 'suggestion': 'Introduce a dedicated verification subtask immediately after the initial classification: for each candidate, explicitly name the continuous symmetry (if any) that must be spontaneously broken for that excitation to exist. Require the agent to show why phonons arise from broken translational invariance. If any classification is unsupported, force a re-evaluation before proceeding. This explicit symmetry-to-particle check will catch misclassifications like the one made for phonons.'}}, {'verifier_name': 'gpt-4.1-mini', 'evaluation': {'failure_reason': 'The previous reasoning incorrectly concluded that phonons are not associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking, due to a misunderstanding of the nature of phonons and the symmetries involved in crystal lattices. The error lies in the assumption that phonons exist independently of any symmetry breaking, ignoring that the formation of a crystal lattice itself spontaneously breaks continuous translational symmetry, making phonons Nambu-Goldstone modes of that broken symmetry.', 'feedback': "The core logical flaw in the reasoning process is the treatment of phonons as normal modes unrelated to spontaneous symmetry breaking. In reality, phonons arise as Nambu-Goldstone bosons due to the spontaneous breaking of continuous translational symmetry when a crystal lattice forms from a homogeneous medium. This means phonons are indeed associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking, contrary to the agents' unanimous conclusion. The agents correctly identified magnons and pions as arising from spontaneous symmetry breaking, and partially recognized skyrmions as related to broken symmetries, but failed to properly classify phonons. The error originated in the initial analysis subtask (Sub-task 1), where the nature of phonons was oversimplified and the role of broken continuous translational symmetry was neglected. This flawed assumption propagated through subsequent subtasks without challenge, as the collaboration pattern (SC_CoT followed by Debate) did not include a critical re-examination or incorporation of more nuanced physical context. The context provided was sufficient for the other particles but lacked explicit emphasis on the symmetry breaking underlying phonons. The agents' reasoning was consistent internally but based on an incomplete or incorrect premise about phonons. Therefore, the failure is rooted in an incomplete physical understanding embedded in the reasoning instructions and context, not in the collaboration or output passing per se.", 'suggestion': '1) Refine the instructions and context in Sub-task 1 to explicitly require consideration of the type of symmetry broken for each particle, especially emphasizing that phonons are Nambu-Goldstone bosons of spontaneously broken continuous translational symmetry in crystals. This can be done by adding clarifying context or prompting agents to verify the symmetry breaking nature of phonons specifically. 2) Change the collaboration pattern for Sub-task 2 from a simple Debate to a Reflexion or Critical Review pattern that forces agents to challenge initial assumptions and re-examine particles with ambiguous or subtle symmetry breaking origins (like phonons and skyrmions). This would help catch oversights and improve final answer accuracy. These two steps directly address the root cause—the incomplete or incorrect physical premise about phonons—and improve the reasoning robustness.'}}]
