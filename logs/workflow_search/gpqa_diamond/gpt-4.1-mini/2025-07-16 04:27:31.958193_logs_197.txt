1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- Total cobalt concentration: c(Co) = 10^-2 M.
- Thiocyanate ion concentration: [SCN^-] = 0.1 M.
- Stability constants (cumulative) for cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes:
  β1 = 9 (for Co(SCN)^+),
  β2 = 40 (for Co(SCN)_2),
  β3 = 63 (for Co(SCN)_3^-),
  β4 = 16 (for Co(SCN)_4^{2-}).
- The problem references the 'blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex,' which corresponds to the species with two SCN^- ligands, i.e., Co(SCN)_2.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The total cobalt concentration is distributed among free Co(II) ions and various thiocyanato complexes with 1 to 4 SCN^- ligands.
- The stability constants β_n represent cumulative formation constants for complexes with n ligands, indicating the equilibrium favorability of each complex.
- The concentration of each complex depends on [Co^{2+}], [SCN^-], and β_n via the relation: [Co(SCN)_n^{(2-n)+}] = β_n * [Co^{2+}] * [SCN^-]^n.
- The sum of all cobalt species concentrations equals the total cobalt concentration.
- The percentage of the dithiocyanato complex is the ratio of its concentration to total cobalt concentration, multiplied by 100.
- The relatively high [SCN^-] (0.1 M) compared to c(Co) (10^-2 M) suggests significant complex formation.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem lies in the domain of Analytical Chemistry and Chemical Equilibria.
- It involves concepts from Coordination Chemistry, specifically complex ion formation and stability constants.
- Mathematically, it relates to equilibrium calculations and algebraic manipulation of equilibrium expressions.
- Such problems are common in chemical analysis, solution chemistry, and sometimes appear in chemistry competitions or academic coursework.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The problem does not specify whether the given β values are stepwise or cumulative constants; the notation suggests cumulative, but confirmation would be helpful.
- The charge states of the complexes are not explicitly given, though can be inferred.
- It is not stated whether activity coefficients are considered unity (ideal solution assumption).
- The problem assumes that only these four complexes and free Co(II) exist; no other species or side reactions are mentioned.
- The exact definition of the 'blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex' is assumed to be Co(SCN)_2, but this is not explicitly stated.
- Potential challenges include solving the system of equilibrium expressions to find species concentrations without explicit stepwise constants or additional data.
