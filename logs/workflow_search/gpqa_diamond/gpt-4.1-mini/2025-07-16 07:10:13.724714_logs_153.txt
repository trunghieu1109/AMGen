1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- Mass spectrometry data: molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 (100% intensity), and a peak at m/z = 158 (32% intensity), suggesting the presence of an isotope (likely chlorine due to the characteristic 3:1 ratio).
- IR spectrum: broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1 indicating O-H stretching (likely carboxylic acid), and a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 consistent with a carbonyl (C=O) group.
- 1H NMR data: singlet at 11.0 ppm (1H) typical of acidic proton (carboxylic acid OH), doublets at 8.02 ppm (2H) and 7.72 ppm (2H) indicating aromatic protons in a para-substituted benzene ring.
- The compound is a white solid.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The molecular ion peak and isotope pattern suggest the presence of chlorine (Cl) in the molecule.
- The IR data indicates a carboxylic acid functional group (broad O-H stretch and carbonyl C=O stretch).
- The NMR splitting pattern (two doublets each integrating to 2H) suggests a symmetrical para-substituted aromatic ring.
- The singlet at 11.0 ppm corresponds to the acidic proton of the carboxylic acid.
- These data collectively point to a para-chlorobenzoic acid structure.
- The constraints (mass, isotope pattern, IR, NMR) help exclude other isomers or functional groups.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem lies in the domain of organic chemistry, specifically analytical chemistry and spectroscopy.
- Subfields involved include mass spectrometry, infrared spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
- Such problems are common in chemical structure elucidation, pharmaceutical analysis, and forensic chemistry.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The exact solvent or conditions for the NMR are not specified, which can affect chemical shifts.
- The intensity ratio of the isotope peaks is given but not explicitly linked to chlorine; this is inferred.
- The problem does not specify if the compound is pure or a mixture.
- The IR peak range is broad; more precise peak shape or additional IR bands could aid interpretation.
- The NMR data lacks coupling constants, which could help confirm substitution patterns.
- The problem assumes familiarity with spectral interpretation and typical chemical shift ranges.
