============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- Mass of Fe(OH)3: 0.1 g
- Total solution volume: 100 cm³
- Temperature: 25°C
- Acid: monobasic strong acid, concentration 0.1 M
- Unknowns to find: minimum volume of acid (cm³) needed, pH of resulting solution

Properties:
- Fe(OH)3 is a sparingly soluble hydroxide, likely to dissolve upon acid addition due to neutralization of OH⁻ ions.
- The acid is monobasic and strong, fully dissociating in solution.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The dissolution of Fe(OH)3 depends on the neutralization of hydroxide ions by H⁺ from the acid.
- The amount of acid required is related to the stoichiometry of the neutralization reaction and the solubility equilibrium of Fe(OH)3.
- The pH depends on the concentration of excess H⁺ ions after neutralization and dissolution.
- Constraints include fixed total volume (100 cm³) and acid concentration (0.1 M), influencing the volume of acid needed.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- Chemistry, specifically analytical chemistry and solution equilibria.
- Subfields: acid-base equilibria, solubility equilibria, stoichiometry.
- Applications: chemical preparation, titration, solution chemistry in laboratory settings.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The exact solubility product (Ksp) of Fe(OH)3 is not provided, which is critical for precise calculations.
- The nature of the acid is only described as monobasic strong acid; the specific acid identity is not given but may not be necessary.
- It is unclear whether the total volume includes the acid volume or if acid volume is added to reach 100 cm³.
- Potential complexity arises from balancing dissolution equilibrium with acid neutralization and volume constraints.
