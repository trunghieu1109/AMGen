============== Task detailed analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- Total cobalt concentration: c(Co) = 10^-2 M.
- Thiocyanate ion concentration: [SCN^-] = 0.1 M.
- Stability constants (cumulative) for cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes:
  β1 = 9 (for Co(SCN)^+),
  β2 = 40 (for Co(SCN)_2),
  β3 = 63 (for Co(SCN)_3^-),
  β4 = 16 (for Co(SCN)_4^{2-}).
- The problem references the 'blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex,' which corresponds to the species with two SCN^- ligands, i.e., Co(SCN)_2.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The total cobalt concentration is distributed among free Co(II) ions and various thiocyanato complexes.
- The stability constants β_n represent cumulative formation constants for complexes with n SCN^- ligands.
- The concentration of each complex depends on the free Co(II) concentration, the SCN^- concentration raised to the power n, and the corresponding β_n.
- The sum of all cobalt species concentrations equals the total cobalt concentration.
- The percentage of the dithiocyanato complex is the ratio of its concentration to the total cobalt concentration, multiplied by 100.
- The relatively high SCN^- concentration (0.1 M) and given β values influence the distribution of species.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem lies in the domain of Analytical Chemistry, specifically Coordination Chemistry.
- It involves chemical equilibrium calculations and complex formation constants.
- The mathematical concepts include equilibrium expressions, mass balance, and possibly solving polynomial equations.
- Such problems are common in chemical speciation analysis, solution equilibria, and are relevant in fields like environmental chemistry, biochemistry, and chemical engineering.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The problem does not specify whether the given β values are stepwise or cumulative constants; the notation suggests cumulative, but confirmation would be helpful.
- The charge states of the complexes are not explicitly given, though implied by typical coordination chemistry.
- The problem assumes that only these four complexes and free Co(II) exist; no other species or side reactions are mentioned.
- It is not stated whether activity coefficients are considered or if ideal solution behavior is assumed.
- The exact definition or identification of the 'blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex' is assumed to be Co(SCN)_2, but this is not explicitly stated.
