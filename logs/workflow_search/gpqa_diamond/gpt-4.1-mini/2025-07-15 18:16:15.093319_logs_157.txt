[{'objective': 'Understand the normal activation process and functional role of the transcription factor subunit, including phosphorylation, dimerization, nuclear translocation, and gene transcription.'}, {'objective': "Analyze the impact of a dominant-negative mutation in the dimerization domain on the protein's ability to form dimers and interact with the wild-type subunit."}, {'objective': 'Determine how the mutation affects the overall function of the transcription factor complex, including potential loss-of-function or interference with wild-type protein activity.'}, {'objective': 'Predict the most likely molecular phenotype resulting from the dominant-negative mutation based on its effect on dimerization and transcription factor function.'}]
