[{'objective': 'Analyze the energy spectrum characteristics of the original decay 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V, focusing on why the E particle spectrum is continuous with endpoint Q'}, {'objective': 'Determine how replacing the two V particles with one massless particle M affects the kinematics and energy distribution among the decay products'}, {'objective': 'Evaluate the resulting energy spectrum of the E particles in the modified decay, focusing on continuity, shape changes, and endpoint shifts'}, {'objective': 'Compare the modified E particle energy spectrum to the original to identify changes in continuity and endpoint energy'}]
