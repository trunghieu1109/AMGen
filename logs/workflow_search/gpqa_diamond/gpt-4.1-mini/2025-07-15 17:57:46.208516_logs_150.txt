1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- The system's state at time t is represented by a column matrix (state vector) with elements (-1, 2, 1).
- The observable is represented by a 3x3 matrix operator P with elements:
  First row: (0, 1/√2, 0)
  Second row: (1/√2, 0, 1/√2)
  Third row: (0, 1/√2, 0)
- The problem involves calculating the probability that a measurement of this observable yields the eigenvalue 0 at time t.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The state vector represents the system's quantum state in a 3-dimensional Hilbert space.
- The observable P is a Hermitian operator (implied by the symmetric matrix with real entries), whose eigenvalues correspond to possible measurement outcomes.
- The probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue (here, 0) is given by the squared magnitude of the projection of the state vector onto the eigenspace associated with that eigenvalue.
- The matrix elements and the state vector components are interconnected through the spectral decomposition of P.
- The problem implicitly requires finding the eigenspace corresponding to eigenvalue 0 and projecting the state vector onto it.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem lies in the domain of linear algebra and quantum mechanics.
- Subfields involved include quantum state representation, Hermitian operators, eigenvalue problems, and probability amplitudes.
- Such problems commonly arise in quantum physics, quantum computing, and mathematical physics, as well as in advanced mathematical competitions.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The problem does not explicitly state whether the state vector is normalized; normalization may be required.
- It is not specified whether the observable matrix P is Hermitian, though the symmetry suggests it is.
- The eigenvalues of P are not given; determining the eigenspace for eigenvalue 0 is necessary.
- The problem assumes familiarity with quantum measurement postulates and projection operators.
- Potential challenges include computing eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P and projecting the given state vector accordingly.
