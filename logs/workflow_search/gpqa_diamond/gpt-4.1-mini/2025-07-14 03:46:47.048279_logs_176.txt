============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- Two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, are considered.
- Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2.
- Star_1's mass is also 1.5 times that of Star_2.
- Both stars have the same peak wavelength of emission, determined via spectroscopy.
- Radial velocities: Star_1 has 0 km/s, Star_2 has 700 km/s.
- Stars are assumed to radiate as black bodies.
- The problem involves computing the factor by which Star_1's luminosity exceeds Star_2's.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- Radius and mass scale by the same factor (1.5), suggesting a proportional relationship.
- Identical peak wavelengths imply equal surface temperatures due to Wien's displacement law.
- Radial velocities differ, which may affect observed wavelengths via Doppler shift, but since peak wavelengths are given as equal, this suggests intrinsic temperatures are the same.
- Luminosity of a black body star depends on its radius and temperature via the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴.
- Since temperatures are equal, luminosity ratio depends primarily on the square of the radius ratio.
- The mass information may relate to other stellar properties but is not directly linked to luminosity in the black body assumption.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- Astrophysics, specifically stellar physics.
- Concepts from thermodynamics (black body radiation), spectroscopy, and classical mechanics (radial velocity).
- Related mathematical fields include algebra and physics-based modeling.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The role of radial velocity in the problem is ambiguous since peak wavelengths are stated equal despite Doppler shifts.
- It is unclear if relativistic effects or Doppler corrections are considered.
- The mass factor's relevance to luminosity calculation is not explicitly stated.
- Potential assumptions about star composition or emission uniformity are not detailed.
- The exact method of luminosity comparison (e.g., observed vs intrinsic) is not specified.
