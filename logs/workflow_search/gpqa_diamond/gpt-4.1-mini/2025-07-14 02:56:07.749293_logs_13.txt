[{'objective': 'Understand how PFA and PFA+DSG fixation methods affect chromatin crosslinking and antibody accessibility in ChIP-seq experiments'}, {'objective': 'Identify the typical genomic locations where the IKAROS transcription factor binds in human B cells'}, {'objective': 'Analyze how fixation-induced changes influence the detection of ChIP-seq peaks at these genomic locations'}, {'objective': 'Determine which genomic regions are most likely to show disappearing peaks under PFA+DSG fixation compared to PFA alone'}]
