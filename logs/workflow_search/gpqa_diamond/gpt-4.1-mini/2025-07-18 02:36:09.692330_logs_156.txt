1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- The problem context is an outbreak of a viral infectious disease caused by a retrovirus.
- The goal involves designing a molecular diagnostic kit for quick detection.
- Four choices are provided, each describing a sequence of steps involving identification and diagnostic kit development:
  * Choice 1: Identify virus by DNA sequencing, then develop a PCR kit.
  * Choice 2: Identify IgG antibodies, then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG.
  * Choice 3: Identify virus based on symptoms, then design a nested PCR kit.
  * Choice 4: Identify virus by cDNA sequencing, then develop a real-time PCR kit.
- Key biological entities: virus (retrovirus), viral DNA or cDNA, IgG antibodies.
- Techniques mentioned: DNA sequencing, cDNA sequencing, PCR, nested PCR, real-time PCR, ELISA.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- Identification methods vary: direct viral genetic material sequencing (DNA or cDNA), antibody detection (IgG), or symptom-based inference.
- Diagnostic methods depend on identification: PCR-based kits target viral genetic material; ELISA targets host antibodies.
- Constraints include speed and accuracy of diagnosis.
- The choice of sequencing (DNA vs cDNA) relates to the retrovirus lifecycle (RNA genome requiring reverse transcription).
- Nested PCR and real-time PCR are advanced PCR techniques enhancing sensitivity and quantification.
- Symptom-based identification is indirect and may affect specificity.
- These components influence the diagnostic approach's sensitivity, specificity, and practicality.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- Primary domain: Molecular biology and biotechnology.
- Subfields: Virology, molecular diagnostics, immunology.
- Techniques involve nucleic acid sequencing, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
- Applications: Clinical diagnostics, infectious disease control, epidemiology.
- Contexts include medical research, public health response, and diagnostic kit development.
