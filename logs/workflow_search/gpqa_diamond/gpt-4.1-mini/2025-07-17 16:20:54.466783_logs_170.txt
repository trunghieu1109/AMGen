1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- Six substances are given, each consisting of a benzene ring (C6H5) with different substituents:
  1) C6H5-CH3 (methylbenzene, toluene)
  2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (ethyl benzoate)
  3) C6H5-Cl (chlorobenzene)
  4) C6H5-NO2 (nitrobenzene)
  5) C6H5-C2H5 (ethylbenzene)
  6) C6H5-COOH (benzoic acid)
- Each undergoes electrophilic substitution with excess bromine, yielding only one monobromo derivative.
- The problem focuses on the weight fraction of the para-isomer formed in each case.
- Four possible orderings of the substances by increasing para-isomer weight fraction are provided.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The substituents on the benzene ring influence the regioselectivity of electrophilic bromination via their electron-donating or electron-withdrawing effects.
- Electron-donating groups (e.g., CH3, C2H5) typically activate the ring and direct substitution to ortho and para positions.
- Electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., NO2, COOH, COOC2H5) deactivate the ring and direct substitution to the meta position.
- Halogens (e.g., Cl) are deactivating but ortho/para directing.
- The para-isomer yield depends on steric and electronic factors; bulky groups or strong directing effects can influence the ratio of ortho to para substitution.
- The problem assumes only one monobromo derivative forms, implying regioselectivity is high or that the mixture is considered as a single isomer per compound.
- The weight fraction of the para-isomer is influenced by the relative amounts of ortho and para substitution and the molecular weights of the isomers.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem lies in the domain of organic chemistry, specifically aromatic electrophilic substitution reactions.
- It involves concepts of chemical reactivity, regioselectivity, and substituent effects (electron-donating/withdrawing groups).
- The problem also touches on analytical chemistry aspects related to isomer yield quantification.
- Such problems are common in chemical education, competitive exams, and research involving reaction mechanisms.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The problem states only one monobromo derivative is formed per substance, which is an idealization; in practice, mixtures of ortho and para isomers often form.
- The exact conditions of the reaction (solvent, temperature, catalyst) are not specified, which can affect regioselectivity.
- The term "weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer" could be ambiguous without specifying whether it refers to the fraction of para isomer relative to total brominated products or relative to total mass of all products.
- The problem does not specify whether steric hindrance or other factors are considered in the para/ortho ratio.
- The molecular weights of the substituents and their influence on weight fraction calculations are implicit but not detailed.
- Potential challenges include interpreting substituent effects quantitatively and correlating them with para-isomer yields without explicit data.
