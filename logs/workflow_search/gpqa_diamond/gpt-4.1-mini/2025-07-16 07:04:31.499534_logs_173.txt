============== Task detailed analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- Initial nucleus mass: M, with rest-mass energy 300 GeV.
- The nucleus undergoes spontaneous fission into exactly two fragments.
- One fragment is twice as massive as the other in terms of rest mass.
- The sum of the rest masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M, indicating a 1% mass loss converted into kinetic energy.
- Kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is denoted as T1.
- The problem asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) T1 and the classical (non-relativistic) approximation of T1.
- Electrons are ignored, so only nuclear masses and energies are considered.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The initial nucleus is at rest, so total momentum before fission is zero.
- After fission, conservation of momentum implies the two fragments move in opposite directions with momenta equal in magnitude.
- The mass ratio (2:1) between fragments sets a fixed relationship between their rest masses.
- The total rest mass after fission is 0.99 M, so 1% of the initial rest mass energy is converted into kinetic energy of the fragments.
- The kinetic energies depend on the fragments' velocities, which must be consistent with relativistic momentum and energy relations.
- The classical approximation assumes kinetic energy T = p²/(2m), which may underestimate or overestimate T1 compared to the relativistic formula.
- The difference between relativistic and classical T1 values reflects relativistic corrections due to possibly significant fragment velocities.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem lies in the domain of relativistic physics, specifically relativistic mechanics.
- It involves concepts from nuclear physics (fission, rest mass energy, mass-energy equivalence).
- Mathematical subfields include algebra (mass ratios, energy relations) and special relativity (energy-momentum relations).
- Such problems are common in physics competitions, nuclear physics, and particle physics contexts.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The exact numerical values of fragment masses are implied but not explicitly given; they must be derived from the ratio and total mass.
- The problem assumes no other particles are emitted, which simplifies momentum and energy conservation.
- The term "correct" T1 implies using relativistic formulas, but the exact method or formulas to be used are not specified.
- Potential challenges include handling relativistic kinetic energy expressions and comparing them to classical approximations without explicit velocity values.
- The problem does not specify whether to consider binding energy differences or other nuclear effects beyond rest mass loss.
