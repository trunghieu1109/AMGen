============== Task detailed analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- Two stars, star_1 and star_2, are studied.
- Iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2.
- The energy difference between the considered energy levels is approximately 1.38 × 10^(-23) J.
- The stellar photospheres are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).
- Four candidate equations relate the effective temperatures T_1 and T_2 of the stars.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The excitation ratio (factor of 2) relates to the population of atoms in a given energy state, which under LTE follows the Boltzmann distribution.
- The energy difference ΔE between levels and temperatures T_1, T_2 influence the relative populations via an exponential factor involving ΔE/(kT), where k is Boltzmann's constant.
- The natural logarithm of the excitation ratio (ln(2)) is expected to be expressed as a function of T_1 and T_2, reflecting the ratio of Boltzmann factors.
- The constraints imply a relationship between T_1 and T_2 that must satisfy the observed excitation ratio.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem lies in astrophysics and statistical mechanics.
- Relevant mathematical domains include thermodynamics, statistical physics, and applied mathematics.
- Concepts involved include Boltzmann distribution, energy level populations, and temperature-dependent excitation.
- Such problems commonly arise in astrophysical spectroscopy and stellar atmosphere modeling.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The exact form of the equation relating excitation ratio and temperatures is not explicitly given; the problem tests recognition of the correct formula.
- The problem assumes knowledge of LTE and Boltzmann statistics without explicitly stating constants or formulas.
- Potential ambiguity in notation (e.g., whether T1*T2 is squared or not) in the candidate equations.
- The problem does not specify if other factors (e.g., degeneracy, partition functions) are considered, which might affect the excitation ratio.
