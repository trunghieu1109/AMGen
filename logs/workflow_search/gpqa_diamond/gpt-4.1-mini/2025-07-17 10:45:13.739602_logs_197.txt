1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- Total cobalt concentration: c(Co) = 10^-2 M.
- Thiocyanate ion concentration: [SCN^-] = 0.1 M.
- Stability constants (cumulative) for cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes:
  β1 = 9 (for Co(SCN)+),
  β2 = 40 (for Co(SCN)2),
  β3 = 63 (for Co(SCN)3^-),
  β4 = 16 (for Co(SCN)4^2-).
- The problem focuses on the blue dithiocyanato complex, which corresponds to the species with two SCN^- ligands, i.e., Co(SCN)2.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The cobalt ions form complexes with thiocyanate ions in various stoichiometries, from 1 to 4 SCN^- ligands.
- The stability constants βn represent cumulative formation constants for each complex species.
- The total cobalt concentration is distributed among free Co(II) ions and all complexed forms.
- The concentration of each complex depends on the free Co(II) concentration, the SCN^- concentration, and the respective βn.
- The percentage of the dithiocyanato complex is the ratio of its concentration to the total cobalt concentration, multiplied by 100.
- The given β values and concentrations impose equilibrium constraints that determine the speciation distribution.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem lies in the field of Analytical Chemistry, specifically Coordination Chemistry.
- It involves chemical equilibrium calculations and complexation equilibria.
- Subfields include solution chemistry, equilibrium thermodynamics, and speciation analysis.
- Such problems are common in chemical analysis, environmental chemistry, and chemical education contexts.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The problem does not specify whether the β values are stepwise or cumulative constants; however, the notation βn typically denotes cumulative constants.
- The charge states of the complexes are not explicitly given, though implied by typical coordination chemistry.
- The problem assumes that the only cobalt species present are the free ion and the four complexes listed; no other species or side reactions are mentioned.
- The ionic strength and activity coefficients are not provided, so it is assumed ideal behavior.
- The exact definition of the 'blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex' is assumed to be Co(SCN)2, but this is not explicitly stated.
