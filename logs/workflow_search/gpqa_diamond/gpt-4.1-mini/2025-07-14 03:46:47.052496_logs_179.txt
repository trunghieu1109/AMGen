============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- There are 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e (where e is the elementary charge).
- The particles have negligible mass.
- 12 of these charges are constrained to lie at a distance of 2 meters from a fixed point P.
- The 13th charge is fixed exactly at point P.
- The problem asks for the minimum energy of this system, presumably the electrostatic potential energy, expressed in Joules and rounded to three decimal places.
- Four numerical choices are provided for the energy value.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The 13th charge at point P interacts electrostatically with the 12 charges located on a sphere of radius 2 m centered at P.
- The 12 charges are constrained to remain at a fixed radius from P, implying they lie on the surface of a sphere.
- The minimum energy configuration likely involves arranging the 12 charges on the sphere to minimize repulsive potential energy among themselves and with the central charge.
- The problem involves Coulombic interactions between all pairs of charges, with the central charge interacting with each of the 12 charges, and the 12 charges interacting among themselves.
- Constraints such as fixed radius and identical charges influence the spatial configuration and thus the total potential energy.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem lies primarily in classical electrostatics, a subfield of physics.
- It involves concepts from potential theory and electrostatic energy calculations.
- Mathematically, it relates to geometry (points on a sphere), optimization (minimizing energy), and possibly combinatorial arrangements (distribution of points on a sphere).
- Such problems are common in mathematical physics, physical chemistry (e.g., modeling ionic configurations), and mathematical competitions involving physics.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The exact arrangement of the 12 charges on the sphere is not specified; the problem implies finding the configuration that minimizes energy.
- It is not explicitly stated whether the charges are free to move on the sphere surface or fixed in some pattern.
- The problem assumes knowledge of the elementary charge e and the formula for electrostatic potential energy.
- Potential challenges include computing pairwise interactions among 12 charges on a sphere and with the central charge, and determining the minimal energy configuration without explicit positional data.
- The negligible mass suggests dynamics are not considered, only static energy.
- The problem does not specify if the medium is vacuum or another dielectric, but standard assumption is vacuum.
