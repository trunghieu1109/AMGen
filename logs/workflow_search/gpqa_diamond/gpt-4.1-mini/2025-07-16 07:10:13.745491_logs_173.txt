============== Task detailed analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- Initial nucleus mass: M, with rest-mass energy 300 GeV.
- The nucleus is initially at rest.
- The nucleus undergoes spontaneous fission into exactly two fragments.
- One fragment is twice as massive as the other in terms of rest mass.
- The sum of the rest masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M (i.e., total rest mass after fission is 0.99 M).
- Kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is denoted as T1.
- Electrons are ignored.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The initial rest mass energy corresponds to the total energy of the system at rest.
- The mass loss (1% of M) implies conversion of rest mass into kinetic energy of the fragments.
- The two fragments have rest masses m and 2m, with m + 2m = 0.99 M, so m = 0.33 M approximately.
- Conservation of momentum applies: since initial momentum is zero, the two fragments move in opposite directions with momenta equal in magnitude.
- The kinetic energy T1 of the heavier fragment depends on its velocity, which is related to the momentum and relativistic energy-mass relation.
- The classical approximation assumes kinetic energy T = p^2/(2m), ignoring relativistic effects.
- The difference between the relativistic and classical kinetic energies for the heavier fragment is requested.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem lies in the domain of relativistic physics, specifically relativistic mechanics.
- It involves concepts from nuclear physics (fission), special relativity (energy-momentum relations), and classical mechanics (non-relativistic kinetic energy).
- Relevant subfields include particle physics and energy-mass equivalence.
- Such problems are common in physics education, nuclear physics research, and high-energy physics contexts.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The exact numerical values of fragment masses are implied but not explicitly given; the ratio and total mass fraction are provided.
- The problem assumes no other particles or energy forms are produced, which simplifies conservation laws.
- The term "correct" T1 implies using relativistic formulas, but the problem does not specify the exact method or approximations allowed.
- Potential challenge includes correctly applying relativistic momentum and energy relations to find kinetic energies and their difference.
- The problem ignores electrons, which is standard but should be noted as an assumption.

This shortcut obscured the actual small (~5 MeV), not 10 MeV, difference between the two kinetic‐energy formulas.', 'feedback': '1. In Sub-task 3 and Sub-task 4, agents never solved explicitly for the common momentum p by enforcing E_total = √(p²c²+m1²c⁴)+√(p²c²+m2²c⁴) and p = m1 v1 = m2 v2, nor did they compute numerical values of T1_rel and T1_class. They simply invoked the ‘Q × m2/(m1+m2)’ rule and stated ‘about 10 MeV’ by appeal to consensus, without checking it against the exact formulas. 2. Sub-task 5 then married those informal estimates instead of subtracting two concrete numbers; it never confronted the precise ~5 MeV result. 3. This shortcut step is where the wrong answer crept in—the agents never reconciled approximate partitioning with an exact energy–momentum calculation.', 'suggestion': '– Strengthen Sub-task 3 and 4 instructions: require agents to derive and solve for the common momentum p numerically and then compute T1_rel and T1_class to at least three significant digits. – In Sub-task 5, mandate a simple numeric subtraction of the two results and automatic selection of the nearest provided choice. This forces quantitative verification rather than consensus-based guessing.'}}, {'verifier_name': 'gpt-4.1-mini', 'evaluation': {'failure_reason': 'The previous reasoning process failed because it did not perform explicit, quantitative relativistic and classical kinetic energy calculations. Instead, it relied on qualitative reasoning and consensus without verifying the numerical magnitude of the difference. This led to an incorrect final answer choice, as the actual difference between relativistic and classical kinetic energies for the heavier fragment is much smaller than claimed.', 'feedback': "The main flaw in the reasoning process lies in the lack of explicit, step-by-step quantitative calculations for both relativistic and classical kinetic energies of the heavier fragment. Although the agents correctly extracted the fragment masses and applied conservation laws conceptually, they did not compute the fragment velocities or momenta numerically, nor did they calculate the Lorentz factors or kinetic energies precisely. Instead, the agents assumed that relativistic effects would cause a significant difference (~10 MeV) without verifying if the fragment velocities are sufficiently relativistic to justify such a difference. Given the small mass defect (1%) and the mass ratio, the fragments' velocities are relatively low, making relativistic corrections minimal. The error propagated through all subtasks because each agent accepted the previous conclusions without challenging or recalculating the kinetic energies explicitly. The context provided was sufficient for qualitative analysis but lacked numerical detail necessary for precise energy computations. The collaboration pattern (Debate and SC_CoT) encouraged consensus but did not enforce rigorous numerical verification, which is critical in relativistic problems. Therefore, the failure originated primarily in Sub-task 3 and Sub-task 4, where kinetic energies should have been explicitly calculated using relativistic formulas and compared to classical approximations. Without these calculations, the final difference estimate was speculative and incorrect. To fix this, the workflow must require explicit numerical evaluation of velocities, Lorentz factors, and kinetic energies, ensuring that the relativistic correction magnitude is accurately determined rather than assumed.", 'suggestion': "1) Refine Sub-tasks 3 and 4 to mandate explicit numerical calculations: agents must compute fragment velocities from conservation of momentum and energy, calculate relativistic kinetic energies using gamma factors, and classical kinetic energies using v^2/2 formulas. This will ground the difference in concrete numbers rather than qualitative assumptions.\n\n2) Change the collaboration pattern for these subtasks from Debate or SC_CoT to a more rigorous Reflexion or Verification pattern, where agents critically check and validate each other's numerical computations step-by-step, preventing propagation of unchecked assumptions.\n\nAdditionally, reconnect context explicitly by passing computed velocities and momenta from Sub-task 2 to Sub-tasks 3 and 4, ensuring all agents have the precise parameters needed for accurate kinetic energy calculations."}}]
