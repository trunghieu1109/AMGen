============== Task detailed analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- The aperture is shaped as an N-sided polygon with all apothems equal to length a.
- Monochromatic light of wavelength \( \lambda \) travels along the z-axis and illuminates the aperture vertically.
- The far-field diffraction pattern exhibits a series of intensity maxima and minima.
- The problem focuses on the angular distance between the first two minima in the diffraction pattern.
- The limit considered is as \( N \to \infty \), implying the polygon approaches a circle.
- Small-angle approximation is valid: \( \tan \theta \approx \theta \).

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The polygonal aperture with equal apothems defines a specific geometric shape whose diffraction pattern depends on its shape and size.
- As \( N \to \infty \), the polygon tends to a circular aperture of radius \( a \) (since apothem corresponds to radius in the limit).
- The diffraction pattern for a circular aperture is well-known to produce an Airy pattern, with minima at specific angular positions related to \( \lambda / a \).
- The small-angle approximation simplifies the angular calculations, allowing linear relations between angles and spatial frequencies.
- The angular distance between minima corresponds to zeros of the diffraction intensity function, which depend on aperture geometry and wavelength.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem lies primarily in optics and wave physics, specifically Fraunhofer diffraction.
- Mathematical domains involved include geometry (polygonal and circular shapes), trigonometry (small-angle approximations), and Fourier optics.
- Subfields: physical optics, wave propagation, and diffraction theory.
- Applications include optical engineering, microscopy, and physics competitions.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The exact definition of "angular distance between the first two minima" could be clarified: whether it means the difference between the first and second minima angles or the absolute position of the second minimum.
- The term "aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon with equal apothems" assumes regular polygons, but this is not explicitly stated.
- The problem assumes the polygon tends to a circle as \( N \to \infty \), which is standard but not explicitly justified.
- The nature of the diffraction pattern for finite N is complex; the problem focuses on the limit, but intermediate behavior is not discussed.
- Potential computational complexity arises if one attempts to derive minima positions for finite N before taking the limit.
