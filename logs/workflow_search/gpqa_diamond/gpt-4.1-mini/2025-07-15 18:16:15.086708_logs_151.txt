[{'objective': 'Understand the biological significance of shmoo formation in yeast as a marker of active transcriptional response'}, {'objective': 'Identify protein complexes typically associated with active chromatin during transcriptional activation'}, {'objective': 'Determine which protein complexes are typically recovered by chromatin immunoprecipitation targeting active chromatin'}, {'objective': 'Compare candidate protein complexes to select the one least likely to be observed in the active chromatin proteome of the shmoo'}]
