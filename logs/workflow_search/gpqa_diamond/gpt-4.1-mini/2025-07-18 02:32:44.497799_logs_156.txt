============== Task detailed analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- The problem context is an outbreak of a viral infectious disease caused by a retrovirus.
- The goal is to design a molecular diagnostic kit for quick detection.
- Four choices are provided, each describing a different approach:
  * Choice 1: Identify virus by DNA sequencing, then develop a PCR kit.
  * Choice 2: Identify IgG antibodies, then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG.
  * Choice 3: Identify virus using symptom information, then design a nested PCR kit.
  * Choice 4: Identify virus by cDNA sequencing, then develop a real-time PCR kit.
- Key biological entities: virus (retrovirus), viral DNA or cDNA, IgG antibodies.
- Techniques mentioned: DNA sequencing, cDNA sequencing, PCR, nested PCR, real-time PCR, ELISA.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- Identification step precedes diagnostic kit development in all choices.
- DNA or cDNA sequencing relates to direct viral genetic material detection.
- IgG antibody identification relates to host immune response detection.
- PCR and its variants (nested, real-time) are molecular amplification techniques for detecting viral genetic material.
- ELISA targets antibodies, indicating indirect detection via immune response.
- Symptom-based identification (choice 3) relies on clinical data rather than molecular data.
- Constraints include speed and accuracy of diagnosis.
- The choice of sequencing method (DNA vs cDNA) reflects the nature of the viral genome (retrovirus has RNA genome, so cDNA sequencing is relevant).

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- Molecular biology and virology.
- Diagnostic assay development.
- Techniques from genetics (sequencing), immunology (antibody detection), and molecular diagnostics (PCR, ELISA).
- Applications in medical diagnostics, epidemiology, and public health.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The problem does not specify whether the viral genome is RNA or DNA, though retroviruses typically have RNA genomes.
- The term "identify the virus using symptom information" is vague and may lack specificity for molecular kit design.
- The choice between DNA and cDNA sequencing needs clarification given the retroviral RNA genome.
- The relative advantages or limitations of each diagnostic method are not detailed.
- No information on resource availability, time constraints, or sensitivity/specificity requirements is provided.
- Potential challenges include interpreting symptom data, choosing appropriate molecular targets, and assay design complexity.
