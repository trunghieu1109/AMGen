============== Task detailed analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- The problem context is an outbreak of a viral infectious disease caused by a retrovirus.
- The goal is to design a molecular diagnostic kit for quick detection.
- Four choices are given, each describing a sequence of steps:
  * Choice 1: Identify virus by DNA sequencing, then develop a PCR kit.
  * Choice 2: Identify IgG antibodies, then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG.
  * Choice 3: Identify virus using symptom information, then design a nested PCR kit.
  * Choice 4: Identify virus by cDNA sequencing, then develop a real-time PCR kit.
- Key entities: virus identification methods (DNA sequencing, cDNA sequencing, symptom-based identification, antibody detection), diagnostic methods (PCR, nested PCR, real-time PCR, ELISA).

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- Virus identification is the initial step, which informs the design of the diagnostic kit.
- DNA sequencing and cDNA sequencing relate to direct genetic analysis of the virus; cDNA sequencing involves reverse transcription of RNA to DNA, relevant for retroviruses.
- Antibody detection (IgG) targets host immune response rather than the virus itself.
- PCR-based methods amplify viral genetic material for detection; nested PCR and real-time PCR are variations enhancing sensitivity and quantification.
- Symptom-based identification is indirect and less specific.
- Constraints include speed and accuracy of diagnosis, influencing choice of molecular technique.
- The choice of identification method affects the type of diagnostic kit developed.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem lies in molecular biology and biotechnology.
- Subfields include virology, molecular diagnostics, immunology, and genetic sequencing.
- Techniques involve PCR technology, ELISA assays, nucleic acid sequencing.
- Applications include clinical diagnostics, epidemiology, public health response.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The problem does not specify the nature of the viral genome (RNA or DNA), which affects sequencing choice.
- The reliability and availability of symptom data for virus identification are unclear.
- The timeline and resource constraints for kit development are not stated.
- The sensitivity and specificity requirements for the diagnostic kit are not detailed.
- The rationale for choosing antibody detection versus direct viral detection is not elaborated.
- Potential challenges include differentiating between active infection and past exposure (especially for antibody-based tests), and the technical complexity of nested or real-time PCR.
