============== Task detailed analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- The aperture is shaped as an N-sided polygon with all apothems equal to length a.
- Monochromatic light of wavelength \( \lambda \) travels along the z-axis and illuminates the aperture vertically.
- The far-field diffraction pattern exhibits a series of intensity maxima and minima.
- The problem focuses on the angular distance between the first two minima in the diffraction pattern.
- The limit considered is as \( N \to \infty \), effectively making the polygon approach a circular aperture.
- Small-angle approximation is valid: \( \tan \theta \approx \theta \).

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The polygonal aperture with equal apothems implies a regular polygon inscribed in a circle of radius a.
- As \( N \to \infty \), the polygon approaches a circular aperture of radius a.
- The diffraction pattern in the far field is related to the Fourier transform of the aperture function.
- The angular positions of minima correspond to zeros of the diffraction intensity function.
- The small-angle approximation simplifies the angular calculations.
- The problem implicitly connects the polygonal aperture diffraction to the well-known Airy pattern of a circular aperture.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem lies in the domain of wave optics and physical optics.
- It involves concepts from Fourier optics and diffraction theory.
- Mathematical subfields include geometry (regular polygons, limits), trigonometry (small-angle approximations), and analysis of special functions (Bessel functions for circular apertures).
- Applications include optical physics, engineering (optical system design), and mathematical physics.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The exact definition of "apothems" in the context of the aperture shape (assumed to be the distance from center to side).
- Whether the polygon is regular (implied but not explicitly stated).
- The nature of the far-field pattern derivation (assumed Fraunhofer diffraction).
- The precise meaning of "angular distance between the first two minima" (assumed to be the difference in angular positions of the first and second intensity minima).
- Potential complexity in transitioning from polygonal to circular aperture diffraction patterns.
- The problem assumes familiarity with diffraction minima positions for circular apertures without explicitly stating the formula.
