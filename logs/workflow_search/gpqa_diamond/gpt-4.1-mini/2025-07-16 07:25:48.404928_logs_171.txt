============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- Two stars, star_1 and star_2, are studied.
- Iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2.
- The energy difference between the considered energy levels is approximately 1.38 × 10^(-23) J.
- The stellar photospheres are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).
- Four candidate equations relating the effective temperatures T_1 and T_2 are provided.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The excitation ratio (factor of 2) relates to the population of atoms in a given energy state, which under LTE follows the Boltzmann distribution.
- The energy difference ΔE between levels and the temperatures T_1, T_2 influence the relative populations via the exponential factor exp(-ΔE/(kT)), where k is Boltzmann's constant.
- The natural logarithm of the ratio of populations (ln(2)) is connected to the difference in inverse temperatures scaled by ΔE/k.
- The constraints imply a relationship between T_1 and T_2 that can be expressed in terms of ln(2) and the energy difference.
- The candidate equations attempt to capture this relationship, involving combinations of T_1 and T_2 in numerator and denominator.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem lies in astrophysics and statistical mechanics.
- It involves thermodynamics concepts, specifically the Boltzmann distribution in LTE conditions.
- Relevant mathematical domains include exponential functions, logarithms, and algebraic manipulation.
- Such problems commonly arise in astrophysics, spectroscopy, and physical chemistry.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The problem does not explicitly state the value or role of Boltzmann's constant k, though it is implicitly involved.
- The exact form of the equation relating excitation ratio and temperatures is not given, requiring inference.
- The notation in the candidate equations is somewhat ambiguous (e.g., whether (T1*T2)^2 means (T1*T2) squared or T1*(T2)^2).
- It is unclear if the temperatures T_1 and T_2 are absolute temperatures in Kelvin or another scale.
- The problem assumes LTE, but does not specify if other effects (e.g., non-LTE processes) are negligible.
