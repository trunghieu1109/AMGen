1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- Two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2.
- Orbital periods (time between consecutive primary eclipses): system_1 has 2 years, system_2 has 1 year.
- Radial velocity (RV) sinusoidal amplitude observations:
  * system_1: 10 km/s and 5 km/s for the two stars.
  * system_2: 15 km/s and 10 km/s for the two stars.
- The mass of each system is defined as the sum of the masses of its two stars.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The orbital period relates to the total mass of the system via Kepler's third law.
- Radial velocity amplitudes correspond to the orbital velocities of each star around the center of mass, which depend on the masses and orbital parameters.
- The ratio of radial velocity amplitudes inversely relates to the ratio of the stellar masses in each system.
- The periods and velocity amplitudes together provide constraints to estimate the total mass of each system.
- The problem asks for the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, implying a ratio of total masses.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- Astrophysics, specifically stellar dynamics and binary star systems.
- Applied classical mechanics and orbital mechanics.
- Concepts from observational astronomy, such as radial velocity measurements.
- Relevant mathematical domains include algebra and trigonometry for sinusoidal velocity curves, and physics-based applications of Kepler's laws.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The problem does not specify orbital inclinations; assuming edge-on orbits due to eclipses is typical but not explicitly stated.
- The eccentricity of orbits is not mentioned; assuming circular orbits simplifies analysis.
- The exact method to combine radial velocity amplitudes and periods to find total mass is not detailed.
- Potential ambiguity in whether the given RV amplitudes correspond directly to orbital velocities or require correction factors.
- No information on distances or absolute velocities beyond amplitudes, which might affect mass calculations if not standard assumptions are applied.
