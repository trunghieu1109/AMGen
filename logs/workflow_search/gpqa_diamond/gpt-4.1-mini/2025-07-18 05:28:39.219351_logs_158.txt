============== Task detailed analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- Observations of a quasar are made in the near infrared and optical spectrum.
- There is a spectral peak at approximately 790 nm.
- At wavelengths shorter than 790 nm, the flux decreases significantly.
- The cosmological model assumed is Lambda-CDM with parameters:
  - Hubble constant H_0 = 70 km s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}
  - Matter density parameter Ω_m = 0.3
  - Dark energy density parameter Ω_Λ = 0.7
  - The universe is flat (Ω_k = 0).
- The question concerns the comoving distance to the quasar at scale factor a = 1 (present epoch).

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The observed wavelength peak at 790 nm and the flux drop at shorter wavelengths suggest a redshifted spectral feature, likely the Lyman-alpha break or another characteristic emission/absorption line.
- The redshift z can be inferred from the ratio of observed wavelength to rest-frame wavelength.
- Given the cosmological parameters, the comoving distance depends on the redshift through the integral of the inverse Hubble parameter over redshift.
- The flat universe assumption simplifies the distance calculations.
- The flux drop at wavelengths shorter than 790 nm indicates absorption or cutoff, which helps constrain the redshift and thus the comoving distance.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem lies in cosmology and astrophysics.
- It involves observational astronomy (spectroscopy), cosmological distance measures, and the Lambda-CDM model.
- Relevant subfields include extragalactic astronomy, cosmological redshift-distance relations, and observational cosmology.
- Such problems are common in astrophysical data analysis, cosmological parameter estimation, and interpretation of high-redshift objects.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The exact rest-frame wavelength corresponding to the observed 790 nm peak is not specified, which is critical to determine redshift.
- The nature of the spectral feature causing the flux drop is not explicitly stated (e.g., Lyman-alpha break, Balmer break).
- Assumptions about the quasar's intrinsic spectrum and possible intervening absorption are not detailed.
- The problem does not specify whether relativistic corrections or peculiar velocities are considered.
- The choice of comoving distance at scale factor a=1 implies present-day distance, but the method to connect observed wavelength to redshift and then to distance is implicit.
