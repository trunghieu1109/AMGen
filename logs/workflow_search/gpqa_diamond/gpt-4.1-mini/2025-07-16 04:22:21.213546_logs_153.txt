1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- Mass spectrometry data: molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 (100% intensity), and a peak at m/z = 158 (32% intensity), indicating the presence of an isotope, likely chlorine (due to the characteristic 3:1 ratio).
- IR spectrum: broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1, typical of O-H stretching in carboxylic acids; strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1, characteristic of C=O stretching in carbonyl groups.
- 1H NMR data: singlet at 11.0 ppm (1H), likely acidic proton (carboxylic acid O-H); two doublets at 8.02 ppm (2H) and 7.72 ppm (2H), suggesting aromatic protons in a para-substituted benzene ring.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The mass spectral peaks and isotope pattern suggest the compound contains chlorine.
- The IR data indicates a carboxylic acid functional group.
- The NMR splitting pattern (two doublets each integrating to 2H) is consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring.
- The singlet at 11.0 ppm supports the presence of a carboxylic acid proton.
- These observations collectively suggest a para-chlorobenzoic acid structure.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem lies in the domain of organic chemistry, specifically spectroscopic analysis.
- Subfields involved include mass spectrometry, infrared spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
- Such problems are common in analytical chemistry, pharmaceutical identification, and chemical research.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The exact solvent or conditions for the NMR are not specified, which can affect chemical shifts.
- The IR peak range is broad; more precise peak shape or additional bands could aid identification.
- The problem does not specify if the molecular ion peak corresponds to the molecular weight or a fragment.
- The choice of compounds includes positional isomers and different functional groups, which may require more detailed spectral data for definitive discrimination.
