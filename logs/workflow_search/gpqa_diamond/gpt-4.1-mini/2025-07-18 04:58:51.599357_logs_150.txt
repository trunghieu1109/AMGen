============== Task detailed analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- The system's state at time t is given by the column matrix \( \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \).
- The observable is represented by a 3x3 matrix operator \( P \) with elements:
  \[ P = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \end{pmatrix} \]
- The problem involves calculating the probability that a measurement of the observable yields the eigenvalue 0 at time t.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The state vector represents the system's state in a 3-dimensional Hilbert space.
- The observable \( P \) is a Hermitian operator (implied by the symmetric matrix), whose eigenvalues correspond to possible measurement outcomes.
- The probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue (here, 0) is given by the squared magnitude of the projection of the state vector onto the eigenspace associated with that eigenvalue.
- The problem implicitly requires finding the eigenspace of \( P \) corresponding to eigenvalue 0 and projecting the state vector onto it.
- The normalization of the state vector and the orthogonality of eigenvectors are relevant constraints.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem lies in the domain of linear algebra and quantum mechanics.
- Subfields involved include matrix theory, eigenvalue problems, and quantum measurement theory.
- Such problems commonly arise in quantum physics, quantum computing, and mathematical physics, as well as in advanced mathematical competitions.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The state vector is given but not explicitly normalized; it is unclear if normalization is assumed or required.
- The observable matrix is given explicitly, but the problem does not specify if it is Hermitian, though it appears symmetric.
- The problem assumes familiarity with the quantum measurement postulate and the method to compute measurement probabilities.
- Potential challenges include computing eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \( P \), normalizing vectors, and performing projections without explicit instructions.
