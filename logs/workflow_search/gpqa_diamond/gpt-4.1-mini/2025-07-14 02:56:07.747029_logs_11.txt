[{'objective': 'Apply conservation of energy and momentum to the decay process of stationary Pi(+) into mu(+) and neutrino.'}, {'objective': 'Calculate the total energy and momentum of the mu(+) and neutrino using the rest masses and conservation equations.'}, {'objective': 'Determine the kinetic energy of each product particle by subtracting their rest mass energy from their total energy.'}, {'objective': 'Compare the calculated kinetic energies with the given choices to identify the correct answer.'}]
