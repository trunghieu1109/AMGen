============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- Two reactions are performed:
  * Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene treated with one equivalent of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.
  * Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene treated similarly.
- Both reactions proceed to 100% completion.
- Products from both reactions are combined.
- The combined mixture is analyzed by two chromatographic methods:
  * Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column.
  * Chiral HPLC column.
- The chromatographic resolution is assumed to be as high as theoretically possible.

- Key chemical entities:
  * (E)- and (Z)-oct-4-ene: geometric isomers differing in alkene stereochemistry.
  * mCPBA: a peracid used for epoxidation, typically stereospecific.
  * Epoxides formed from these alkenes, which may be stereoisomers.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The (E)- and (Z)-alkenes will each form epoxides with distinct stereochemistry due to the stereospecific nature of mCPBA epoxidation.
- Each alkene is expected to yield a pair of enantiomeric epoxides (due to the formation of chiral centers in the epoxide ring), but the exact stereochemical outcome depends on the starting alkene geometry.
- Combining products from both reactions results in a mixture of stereoisomeric epoxides.
- On an achiral HPLC column, enantiomers typically co-elute (appear as a single peak), but diastereomers separate.
- On a chiral HPLC column, enantiomers can be resolved into separate peaks.
- Therefore, the number of peaks observed depends on the number of diastereomers and enantiomers present and the resolving power of the columns.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- Organic Chemistry: specifically stereochemistry and reaction mechanisms.
- Analytical Chemistry: chromatographic separation techniques, including chiral and achiral HPLC.
- Stereochemistry subfield: understanding enantiomers, diastereomers, and their chromatographic behavior.
- Applications include chemical synthesis, stereochemical analysis, and quality control in pharmaceuticals.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The exact stereochemical configuration of the epoxides formed from each alkene is not explicitly stated.
- Whether the epoxidation proceeds with retention or inversion at the double bond is assumed but not detailed.
- The nature of the aqueous acid workup and its effect on stereochemistry is not specified.
- The problem assumes ideal chromatographic resolution, which may not reflect practical limitations.
- Potential complexity arises from the number of stereoisomers formed and their chromatographic behavior, which may be challenging to interpret without explicit stereochemical assignments.
