[{'objective': 'Identify the limiting shape of the aperture as N approaches infinity, which is a circular aperture with radius equal to the apothem length a.'}, {'objective': 'Apply the diffraction theory for a circular aperture to determine the angular positions of the intensity minima.'}, {'objective': 'Use the small angle approximation (tan θ ≈ θ) to simplify the expressions for the angular positions of the minima.'}, {'objective': 'Calculate the angular distance between the first two minima and express it in terms of wavelength λ and apothem length a.'}]
