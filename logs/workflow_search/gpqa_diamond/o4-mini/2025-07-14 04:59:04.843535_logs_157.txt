[{'objective': 'Summarize the normal activation mechanism of the transcription factor involving phosphorylation, dimerization, and nuclear import'}, {'objective': 'Characterize how a dominant-negative mutation in the dimerization domain disrupts wild-type function through mutant–wild-type interactions'}, {'objective': 'Infer the molecular phenotype produced by the dominant-negative effect on transcription factor activity'}, {'objective': 'Select the answer choice that corresponds to the inferred dominant-negative molecular phenotype'}]
============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
   • System: Transcription factor subunit is inactive until phosphorylated by a membrane phosphorylation cascade.
   • Activation: Phosphorylation occurs on Ser residues in the transactivation domain, triggering dimerization and nuclear translocation for gene transcription.
   • Mutation X: Missense change in the transactivation domain; described as a recessive loss-of-function mutation.
   • Mutation Y: Heterozygous site-specific change in the dimerization domain; acts as a dominant-negative mutation.
   • Observational question: Which molecular phenotype arises in the presence of mutation Y? Four answer choices provided (loss of dimerization/WT phenotype; protein aggregation/LOF; protein degradation/WT allele LOF; conformational change/gain-of-function).

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
   • Phosphorylation → Dimerization → Nuclear entry → Transcription: a linear activation pathway.
   • Transactivation domain mutation (X) blocks downstream transcription but requires two mutant alleles for phenotype (recessive LOF).
   • Dimerization domain mutation (Y) interferes with normal subunit pairing even when one WT copy is present (dominant-negative effect).
   • Dominant-negative behavior implies the mutant protein can still bind WT subunits or DNA but disrupts overall function.
   • The interplay of domains suggests that disrupting dimerization can abolish activity despite one functional allele; potential outcomes include misfolding, aggregation, or accelerated degradation of heterodimers.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
   • Core domains: Molecular biology, genetics, and protein biochemistry.
   • Subfields/concepts: Signal transduction cascades, post-translational modification (phosphorylation), transcription factor structure–function relationships, dominant-negative mutations in diploid genetics.
   • Applications/contexts: Functional genomics, molecular pathology of genetic diseases, design of dominant-negative inhibitors, cell biology research.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
   • Structural details of the dimerization domain: Does mutation Y abolish binding or alter affinity?
   • Definition of "dominant-negative": Does it act by sequestering WT, forming nonfunctional aggregates, or promoting degradation?
   • Relative protein expression levels: Could overexpression of WT subunits overcome the dominant-negative effect?
   • Exact phenotypic assays implied: Are we measuring protein stability, oligomerization state, subcellular localization, or transcriptional readouts?
   • Potential alternative mechanisms: Is the mutant misfolded and subject to proteasomal degradation, or does it exert a neomorphic effect?

Activation occurs through phosphorylation of serine residues in the transactivation domain, leading to dimerization and nuclear translocation for gene transcription. Mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation, meaning both alleles must be mutated for the loss of function to manifest. Mutation Y in the dimerization domain is a heterozygous dominant-negative mutation, which means it can disrupt the function of the wild-type protein even when one wild-type allele is present. This dominant-negative effect likely leads to a loss of function due to interference with normal dimerization, potentially causing protein misfolding, aggregation, or degradation. Therefore, the most consistent summary is that the presence of mutation Y results in a loss-of-function phenotype due to its dominant-negative effect on the transcription factor\'s ability to function properly, which aligns with the observations made in the analysis of the mutations.\n\n### answer by Final Decision Agent 3aGe:\nC\n\n### Sub-task 2: Determine which dominant-negative mechanism best fits a heterozygous dimerization-domain mutant that inactivates the WT allele.Given solutions to the problem from other agents, consider their opinions as additional advice. Please think carefully and provide an updated answer. \n\n ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent ABRG:\nIn the context of the transcription factor\'s activation and the mutations described, mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. This means that even in the presence of one wild-type allele, the mutant protein can interfere with the function of the wild-type protein. The dominant-negative effect is likely to disrupt normal dimerization, which is crucial for the transcription factor\'s activity. Given that mutation Y is heterozygous and affects the dimerization domain, it can lead to a scenario where the wild-type protein cannot form functional dimers with the mutant protein. This disruption can result in misfolding or aggregation of the protein complex, as the dimerization domain is essential for proper structural integrity and function. Additionally, if the dimerization is compromised, it may lead to the degradation of the improperly formed protein complexes. This aligns with the observed loss-of-function phenotype, as the presence of mutation Y inactivates the wild-type allele\'s function. Therefore, the most likely molecular phenotype observed in the presence of mutation Y is protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele, as the dominant-negative effect of mutation Y prevents the wild-type protein from functioning properly.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent i4BW:\nIn the context of mutation Y being a heterozygous dominant-negative mutation in the dimerization domain, it is crucial to understand how dominant-negative mutations generally function. Such mutations typically produce a protein that can still interact with the wild-type protein but disrupts its normal function, leading to a loss-of-function phenotype. In this case, the dimerization domain is essential for the transcription factor\'s ability to dimerize and function properly. If mutation Y interferes with this dimerization, it can prevent the formation of functional dimers even when a wild-type allele is present. This could lead to several potential outcomes: 1) the formation of non-functional aggregates if the mutant protein misfolds, 2) the degradation of the dimerized complex if it is recognized as abnormal by cellular quality control mechanisms, or 3) a complete loss of function due to disruption of the normal dimerization process. Among the provided options, \'protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele\' aligns best with the expected outcome of a dominant-negative mutation, as it directly indicates that the presence of mutation Y leads to the loss of function associated with the wild-type allele due to its interference. Therefore, the most likely molecular phenotype observed in the presence of mutation Y is that it causes degradation of the protein complex formed with the wild-type allele, resulting in a loss-of-function phenotype.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent yYyn:\nIn the context of the transcription factor subunit, mutation Y in the dimerization domain exhibits a dominant-negative effect, which means that even one copy of the mutant allele can interfere with the function of the wild-type allele. This interference likely results in a failure to properly dimerize, as the mutant protein may either misfold or disrupt the normal dimerization process. Given that the wild-type allele is still present, we can expect that the overall function of the transcription factor will be compromised. The most plausible outcome of this dominant-negative mutation is that the heterodimer formed by the mutant and wild-type subunits may lead to protein degradation or misfolding, ultimately resulting in a loss-of-function phenotype. This aligns with the observations that a dominant-negative mutation typically leads to a reduction in functional protein activity, as the presence of the non-functional mutant subunit can prevent the proper assembly or stability of the functional complex. Therefore, the most likely molecular phenotype observed in the presence of mutation Y is protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent m6Kd:\nIn the context of a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acting as a dominant-negative mutation, we need to consider how this mutation impacts the functionality of the transcription factor. A dominant-negative mutation typically means that the mutant protein interferes with the function of the wild-type protein even when the wild-type protein is present. This interference can occur through several mechanisms: (1) the mutant protein may prevent proper dimerization with the wild-type protein, (2) it may form nonfunctional aggregates, or (3) it may promote the degradation of the wild-type protein. Given that mutation Y is in the dimerization domain, the most likely scenario is that it disrupts the ability of the transcription factor to properly dimerize with its partner, leading to a loss of function. This aligns with the observation that the presence of mutation Y results in a loss-of-function phenotype due to its dominant-negative effect. Therefore, the most appropriate choice is that the mutation leads to protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele, as this reflects the common outcome of dominant-negative mutations disrupting normal protein interactions.\n\n### answer #1 by Debate Agent ABRG:\nC\n\n### answer #1 by Debate Agent i4BW:\nC\n\n### answer #1 by Debate Agent yYyn:\nC\n\n### answer #1 by Debate Agent m6Kd:\nC\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 2: Given all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer. \n\n then justify completely and detailedly, step-by-step why you think so in the "thinking" entry. \n                Consider all cases that are possible to happen.\n                Avoid some unclear explainations, such as "Using the circle equation or the condition for four points to be concyclic, we derive an equation in x.

This means that even in the presence of one wild-type allele, the mutant protein can interfere with the function of the wild-type protein. The dominant-negative effect is likely to disrupt normal dimerization, which is crucial for the transcription factor\'s activity. Given that mutation Y is heterozygous and affects the dimerization domain, it can lead to a scenario where the wild-type protein cannot form functional dimers with the mutant protein. This disruption can result in misfolding or aggregation of the protein complex, as the dimerization domain is essential for proper structural integrity and function. Additionally, if the dimerization is compromised, it may lead to the degradation of the improperly formed protein complexes. This aligns with the observed loss-of-function phenotype, as the presence of mutation Y inactivates the wild-type allele\'s function. Therefore, the most likely molecular phenotype observed in the presence of mutation Y is protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele, as the dominant-negative effect of mutation Y prevents the wild-type protein from functioning properly.\n\n### answer by Final Decision Agent ZGwC:\nC\n\n### Sub-task 3: Evaluate and prioritize the answer choices against the inferred mechanism to select the most likely observed phenotype.Given solutions to the problem from other agents, consider their opinions as additional advice. Please think carefully and provide an updated answer. \n\n ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent WQke:\nIn evaluating the effects of mutation Y, which is a dominant-negative mutation in the dimerization domain of the transcription factor, we must consider how this mutation impacts the functionality of the protein complex formed with the wild-type protein. A dominant-negative mutation typically interferes with the normal function of the wild-type allele, and in this case, it likely prevents proper dimerization necessary for transcriptional activity. The presence of mutation Y can lead to misfolding or improper assembly of the protein complex, which may result in the degradation of these non-functional heterodimers. This aligns with the option that suggests \'protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele.\' The other choices suggest either a wild-type phenotype or a gain-of-function, which are inconsistent with the known effects of dominant-negative mutations. Therefore, the most plausible outcome in the presence of mutation Y is that the wild-type protein cannot perform its function due to the interference caused by the mutant protein, leading to degradation and loss of function.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent 5LMC:\nIn the context of the transcription factor\'s activation, mutation Y, which affects the dimerization domain, acts as a dominant-negative mutation. This means that the presence of the mutant protein can interfere with the function of the wild-type protein, even when one wild-type allele is present. The dimerization of transcription factors is critical for their function, and if mutation Y disrupts this process, it can lead to several possible outcomes. One likely outcome is that the mutant protein may prevent the wild-type protein from forming functional dimers, leading to a scenario where the protein complexes are improperly formed. This can result in misfolding or aggregation of the protein, which can trigger degradation pathways. Given that mutation Y is heterozygous and acts dominantly, it is likely to result in a loss-of-function phenotype for the wild-type allele, as the wild-type protein cannot function properly in the presence of the dominant-negative mutant. Among the provided options, the most fitting description of the observed molecular phenotype is \'protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele\' because the dominant-negative effect of mutation Y impedes the wild-type protein\'s ability to perform its role effectively, leading to degradation of the non-functional complexes formed. Therefore, the answer is C.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent jLpX:\nIn the context of the transcription factor\'s activation, mutation Y acts as a dominant-negative mutation in the dimerization domain. This means that even with one wild-type allele present, the mutant protein can interfere with the function of the wild-type protein by disrupting normal dimerization. The dimerization is crucial for the transcription factor\'s activity, and if mutation Y prevents the formation of functional dimers, it can lead to several consequences. The most likely outcome is that the protein complexes formed with the mutant protein may be misfolded or improperly assembled, leading to their degradation. This degradation would prevent the wild-type allele from functioning properly, resulting in a loss-of-function phenotype. Therefore, the most likely molecular phenotype observed in the presence of mutation Y is protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele, as the dominant-negative effect of mutation Y inhibits the wild-type protein\'s activity.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent Tb5c:\nIn this scenario, we have a transcription factor that requires dimerization for its activation and function. Mutation Y in the dimerization domain is described as a dominant-negative mutation, meaning that it interferes with the function of the wild-type protein even in a heterozygous state. The dominant-negative effect typically arises when the mutant protein can still bind to the wild-type protein but forms a nonfunctional complex, which can lead to several outcomes. One likely outcome is that the presence of the mutant protein disrupts the formation of functional dimers, leading to misfolding or aggregation of the protein. This disruption can also trigger the degradation of the improperly formed complexes, as cells often have mechanisms to degrade misfolded proteins. Given that mutation Y is heterozygous and acts dominantly, it is expected that the wild-type allele\'s function will be compromised, leading to a loss-of-function phenotype. The most fitting answer choice aligns with the expectation of protein degradation resulting from the presence of the dominant-negative mutation, which prevents the wild-type protein from functioning properly.

[{'verifier_name': 'o4-mini', 'evaluation': {'failure_reason': 'The team uniformly assumed that misfolded heterodimers would be targeted for degradation, overlooking the alternative dominant-negative outcome of stable protein aggregation.', 'feedback': 'At the critical subtask where the dominant-negative mechanism was mapped onto a phenotype, all agents jumped to the conclusion that misassembled heterodimers must be degraded. They never seriously weighed the possibility that a defective dimerization interface can produce insoluble aggregates that sequester wild-type subunits (choice 2). In other words, the chain of reasoning conflated “misfolding” with “degradation” by default, without examining whether the mutant’s biophysical defect more naturally leads to aggregation. This led them to select C instead of the correct aggregation outcome.', 'suggestion': "Introduce an explicit subtask requiring a side-by-side comparison of each answer choice against the molecular consequences of a defective dimerization interface. For instance, after inferring the dominant-negative mechanism, ask agents to: 1) list the cellular fates of non-native heterodimers (e.g., aggregation vs. degradation vs. inactivity), and 2) match each fate to the answer options. Also swap the open 'Debate' pattern for a structured ‘Comparison Matrix CoT’–style subtask so that agents must score each phenotype against key mechanistic criteria rather than converge prematurely on one favored outcome."}}, {'verifier_name': 'gpt-4.1-mini', 'evaluation': {'failure_reason': 'The previous reasoning incorrectly concluded that the dominant-negative mutation in the dimerization domain leads primarily to protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele, without adequately considering the molecular mechanism of dominant-negative mutations that often involve formation of nonfunctional dimers or complexes rather than degradation. This led to a misinterpretation of the dominant-negative effect and an incorrect choice of molecular phenotype.', 'feedback': "The key error in the reasoning process lies in the assumption that the dominant-negative mutation (mutation Y) causes degradation of the wild-type protein complexes, leading to loss-of-function. While degradation can occur in some cases, dominant-negative mutations in dimerization domains typically act by forming nonfunctional heterodimers with the wild-type protein, thereby sequestering or inactivating the wild-type protein without necessarily causing its degradation. The agents repeatedly emphasized protein degradation as the dominant-negative mechanism without sufficient evidence or clarification on whether the mutant protein abolishes dimerization or still binds but forms inactive complexes. This flawed assumption led to selecting choice C ('protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele') as the answer. However, the dominant-negative effect more commonly results in formation of nonfunctional dimers or aggregates that interfere with function but do not necessarily cause degradation. The reasoning also did not sufficiently differentiate between loss of dimerization (which would yield a wild-type phenotype if mutant protein cannot bind) and dominant-negative interference (which requires mutant protein binding but functional disruption). The context lacked explicit structural or biochemical details about mutation Y's effect on dimerization affinity or complex stability, which is critical to distinguish between aggregation, degradation, or loss of dimerization. The agents failed to challenge or clarify these assumptions, leading to a consensus on an incorrect mechanism. The error originated in subtasks 1 and 2 where the dominant-negative mechanism was inferred without sufficient mechanistic nuance, and propagated through subtask 3 in answer prioritization. The reasoning should have carefully considered that dominant-negative mutations in dimerization domains often cause protein aggregation or formation of inactive complexes rather than degradation, making choice B ('protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype') more plausible. The failure to critically evaluate alternative dominant-negative mechanisms and insufficient context about the mutant protein's behavior caused the final answer to be wrong.", 'suggestion': "1. Refine subtasks 1 and 2 to explicitly require detailed mechanistic analysis of the dominant-negative mutation's effect on dimerization: Does mutation Y abolish binding, reduce affinity, or allow binding but cause nonfunctional complexes? This should include requesting evidence or reasoning about whether degradation or aggregation is more likely.\n\n2. Change the collaboration pattern in subtasks 2 and 3 from Debate to a more rigorous Reflexion or SC_CoT pattern that forces agents to critically evaluate and contrast different dominant-negative mechanisms (aggregation vs degradation vs loss of dimerization) and explicitly justify why one mechanism fits best given the mutation domain and phenotype.\n\n3. Improve instructions to require agents to consider and discuss the molecular biology literature on dominant-negative mutations in dimerization domains, emphasizing that dominant-negative effects often arise from formation of inactive heterodimers or aggregates rather than degradation.\n\n4. Add context linking structural/biochemical data or typical dominant-negative mutation mechanisms to the reasoning steps, so agents can better discriminate among answer choices.\n\nThese changes will help avoid oversimplified assumptions about dominant-negative effects and lead to more accurate phenotype predictions."}}]

============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
   • System: A transcription factor (TF) exists in an inactive cytosolic state until a phosphorylation cascade at the membrane.
   • Activation steps:
     – Phosphorylation at serine residues in the transactivation domain.
     – Dimerization of TF subunits.
     – Nuclear translocation and role in gene transcription.
   • Mutation X: Missense in the transactivation domain.  
     – Phenotype: Recessive loss-of-function (LoF).
   • Mutation Y: Heterozygous in the dimerization domain.  
     – Phenotype: Dominant-negative (interferes with wild-type function).
   • Multiple-choice options describe different molecular phenotypes (dimerization loss, aggregation, degradation, conformational change).

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
   • Phosphorylation → conformational change → dimerization → nuclear import → transcriptional activation.
   • Transactivation domain (phosphorylation site) vs. dimerization domain: distinct functional modules.
   • Recessive LoF of X implies that one functional allele suffices.  
   • Dominant-negative Y implies mutant subunit can pair with WT subunit, disrupting overall activity.
   • Key constraint: Heterodimer formation between mutant and WT and its effect on TF stability or function.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
   • Molecular biology: protein phosphorylation, domain structure, transcription regulation.
   • Genetics: missense mutations, recessive vs. dominant-negative alleles.
   • Cell biology/biochemistry: signal transduction pathways, protein–protein interactions, dimerization.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
   • Exact mechanism of dominant-negative action (e.g., does the mutant still bind WT?  
     Does it block phosphorylation, nuclear import, DNA binding?).
   • Structural impact of Y in the dimerization domain (folding vs. binding affinity).
   • Whether aggregation or degradation are expected outcomes of a misfolded dimerization-domain mutant.
   • Any quantitative data (e.g., dimerization constants, expression levels) is missing and could affect interpretation.

This suggests that the mutant protein can still dimerize with the WT protein but will disrupt its function, likely preventing proper nuclear import and transcriptional activation. Given that the dominant-negative effect of mutation Y can lead to a situation where the overall dimerization and function of the TF is compromised, the most likely molecular phenotype observed in the presence of mutation Y would be a loss of protein dimerization and a resultant loss-of-function phenotype.

The most plausible outcome, considering the nature of dominant-negative mutations, is the loss of protein dimerization and a resultant loss-of-function phenotype, as the overall activity of the TF would be compromised. Therefore, the candidate molecular phenotype for mutation Y is a loss of protein dimerization and loss-of-function phenotype.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent tkdG:\nThe presence of mutation Y in the dimerization domain of the transcription factor (TF) suggests that it can form non-functional dimers with the wild-type (WT) subunit. In this case, the dominant-negative effect implies that the mutant dimer may not be able to undergo proper dimerization or may interfere with the normal function of the WT dimer. Since the TF requires dimerization for activation and subsequent nuclear translocation for gene transcription, the presence of mutation Y would likely lead to a loss of effective dimerization. This means that the overall activity of the TF would be compromised, resulting in a loss-of-function phenotype. Therefore, the most likely molecular phenotype observed in the presence of mutation Y is a loss of protein dimerization and a resultant loss-of-function phenotype. Additionally, this aligns with the understanding that dominant-negative mutations often disrupt normal protein interactions, leading to impaired function rather than gain-of-function or aggregation, which are less likely outcomes in this context. Thus, the candidate molecular phenotype is a loss of protein dimerization and a loss-of-function phenotype.\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent qsMM:\nA\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent lmIZ:\nA\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent tkdG:\nA\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 3: Synthesize and choose the most consistent candidate molecular phenotypes. \n\n then justify completely and detailedly, step-by-step why you think so in the "thinking" entry. \n                Consider all cases that are possible to happen.\n                Avoid some unclear explainations, such as "Using the circle equation or the condition for four points to be concyclic, we derive an equation in x.

This flawed assumption caused the final answer to be wrong.', 'feedback': "The core error in the reasoning process lies in the misunderstanding of the dominant-negative mutation mechanism in the context of a dimerization domain mutation. Dominant-negative mutations typically produce mutant subunits that still dimerize with the wild-type (WT) subunits but render the resulting heterodimer non-functional. The previous agents repeatedly assumed that mutation Y causes a loss of protein dimerization, implying that mutant subunits fail to dimerize with WT subunits. This is inconsistent with the dominant-negative definition, which requires mutant and WT subunits to physically interact (dimerize) to exert a dominant-negative effect. The error is evident in Sub-tasks 2, 3, and 4, where the reasoning conflated dominant-negative interference with loss of dimerization rather than formation of non-functional dimers. The agents failed to consider that the mutant protein likely still dimerizes but disrupts function, rather than preventing dimerization altogether. This led to selecting choice A ('loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype'), which is contradictory because loss of dimerization would not produce a dominant-negative effect but rather a recessive loss-of-function or haploinsufficiency. Additionally, the choice's wording includes 'wild-type phenotype,' which conflicts with the dominant-negative phenotype observed. The context provided was sufficient to identify the dominant-negative nature but lacked explicit emphasis on the mutant's ability to dimerize yet disrupt function. The agents did not sufficiently clarify or challenge the assumption that dominant-negative mutations cause loss of dimerization. The collaboration pattern (Debate and Chain-of-Thought) was effective in consensus building but failed to critically evaluate this key mechanistic point, leading to unanimous but incorrect conclusions. The subtasks passed outputs correctly, but the reasoning was systematically biased by a flawed assumption that was never corrected or questioned. This error originated in the initial mechanistic interpretation in Sub-task 2 and propagated through subsequent subtasks without re-evaluation. To fix this, the reasoning must explicitly incorporate the canonical dominant-negative mechanism: mutant subunits dimerize with WT subunits but produce non-functional complexes, leading to loss-of-function despite preserved dimerization. This would shift the expected molecular phenotype away from 'loss of dimerization' toward 'formation of non-functional dimers' or possibly 'protein aggregation' or 'altered conformation' causing loss-of-function. The agents also overlooked the subtlety in the answer choices, especially the contradiction in choice A's wording ('loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype'), which is inconsistent with a dominant-negative effect. In summary, the failure was due to a fundamental misunderstanding of dominant-negative mutation mechanisms and insufficient critical analysis of answer choices and their biological implications.", 'suggestion': '1. Refine Sub-task 2 instructions to explicitly require agents to analyze the canonical mechanism of dominant-negative mutations, emphasizing that mutant proteins typically retain the ability to dimerize with WT proteins but disrupt function, rather than abolish dimerization. Agents should be prompted to critically evaluate whether loss of dimerization fits a dominant-negative model or suggests a different mutation type.\n\n2. Introduce a Reflexion or Critical Review subtask after Sub-task 2 or 3, where agents must explicitly challenge and verify key assumptions, such as whether mutation Y causes loss of dimerization or formation of non-functional dimers. This step should encourage reconsideration of initial conclusions and cross-checking with biological principles.\n\nThese changes will help prevent propagation of flawed assumptions and improve the accuracy of mechanistic interpretation, leading to correct identification of the molecular phenotype consistent with dominant-negative mutations.'}}]
