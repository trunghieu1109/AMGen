============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
   - System state at time t: a three-component column vector |ψ(t)⟩ = (–1, 2, 1)^T.
   - Observable P represented by a 3×3 Hermitian matrix with rows:
       • Row 1: (0, 1/√2, 0)
       • Row 2: (1/√2, 0, 1/√2)
       • Row 3: (0, 1/√2, 0)
   - Observable Q represented by a 3×3 diagonal matrix with rows:
       • Row 1: (1, 0, 0)
       • Row 2: (0, 0, 0)
       • Row 3: (0, 0, –1)
   - Measurement protocol: first measure P and obtain outcome 0, then immediately measure Q and obtain outcome –1.
   - Multiple-choice probability options: {1/2, 1/6, 1/3, 2/3}.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
   - P and Q are quantum observables, hence represented by Hermitian operators in the same 3-dimensional Hilbert space.
   - The system’s initial state |ψ⟩ may need normalization before projecting onto P’s eigenbasis.
   - Measurement of P with outcome 0 projects |ψ⟩ onto the eigenspace of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0; this collapsed state is then the new input for measuring Q.
   - Q’s eigenvalues are {1, 0, –1}; obtaining –1 corresponds to projecting onto the eigenvector for eigenvalue –1.
   - The sequential probability P(P=0 then Q=–1) = P(P=0) · P(Q=–1 | P=0).

3. Identify the Field of Study:
   - Primary domain: Quantum mechanics (specifically quantum measurement theory).
   - Mathematical backbone: Linear algebra (vector spaces, eigenvalues/vectors, orthogonal projections).
   - Related concepts: Hermitian operators, state vector normalization, projection postulate.
   - Contexts: Quantum physics problems, advanced undergraduate quantum courses, quantum information.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
   - The given state (–1, 2, 1) is not explicitly normalized; should one normalize before computing probabilities?
   - The dimensionality and orthonormality of P’s eigenbasis require confirmation (e.g., is the zero eigenspace one- or two-dimensional?).
   - Implicit assumption: standard projective measurement formalism.
   - No ambiguity in numeric values, but the normalization step and eigenstructure of P need explicit statement.
