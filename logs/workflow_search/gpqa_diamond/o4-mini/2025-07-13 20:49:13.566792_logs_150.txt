============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
   - State vector at time t: a column matrix ψ = (–1, 2, 1)ᵀ.
   - Observable operator P represented by a 3×3 matrix with rows:
       • Row 1: (0, 1/√2, 0)
       • Row 2: (1/√2, 0, 1/√2)
       • Row 3: (0, 1/√2, 0)
   - The measurement in question: probability that the outcome equals 0.
   - Four candidate probabilities provided: 1/3, 2/3, √(2/3), 1.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
   - The state vector ψ may need normalization before computing probabilities.
   - The operator P has eigenvalues, one of which is 0; the corresponding eigenspace determines the event “measurement yields 0.”
   - Probability = ∥projection of ψ onto the zero‐eigenvalue subspace∥² / ∥ψ∥².  Constraints: orthonormality of eigenvectors, completeness of projector decomposition.
   - The structure of P (symmetric matrix with identical off‐diagonal entries in row 2) suggests degeneracy or simple eigenvector patterns.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
   - Domain: Quantum mechanics (quantum measurement theory) formulated via linear algebra.
   - Subfields/concepts: finite‐dimensional Hilbert spaces, eigenvalue problems, projection operators, normalization of state vectors.
   - Applications: quantum computing, spectroscopy, foundational quantum theory, problems in physics competitions.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
   - Is the given state vector already normalized or must it be normalized first?  
   - Does P have exactly one zero eigenvalue or a degenerate zero eigenspace of dimension >1?  
   - Are there any phase conventions or basis‐ordering assumptions implicit in the matrix representation?  
   - Confirmation of real versus complex entries (here all are real) and whether orthonormality is assumed for the eigenbasis.

We can choose the normalized eigenvector u₀ = (1,0,−1)/√2, but the projector onto the zero-eigenspace is P₀ = |u₀⟩⟨u₀|.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent WFCN:\nWe need the eigenvalue decomposition of the symmetric 3×3 matrix P with entries P_{12}=P_{21}=P_{23}=P_{32}=1/√2 and all other entries zero.  Writing a=1/√2, the characteristic polynomial det(P–λI)=–λ(λ^2–2a^2)=–λ(λ^2–1), giving eigenvalues λ=0, +1, –1.  The zero eigenvalue is nondegenerate.  The eigenvector v for λ=0 satisfies P v=0, i.e. a v2=0⇒v2=0 and a v1 +a v3=0⇒v3=–v1.

From Sub-task 2 we found that the zero‐eigenvalue eigenspace is spanned by the normalized eigenvector u₀ = (1/√2)(1,0,–1)ᵀ.\n2. In general, the projection operator onto the one‐dimensional subspace spanned by a normalized vector u is Π = u\u2009uᵀ.\n3. Hence Π₀ = u₀\u2009u₀ᵀ = (1/√2)[1,0,–1]ᵀ\u2009×\u2009(1/√2)[1,0,–1] = (1/2)\n   [[1,0,–1],\n    [0,0,0],\n    [–1,0,1]].\n4. This operator projects any vector onto the zero‐eigenvalue subspace of P.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent HiYL:\nTo construct the projector onto the zero‐eigenvalue subspace, follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the zero‐eigenvector u₀ found in subtask 2.  We solved P\u2009v=0 and obtained the (normalized) eigenvector u₀ = (1/√2)(1, 0, −1)ᵀ.\n\n2. Recall that the projector onto a one‐dimensional subspace spanned by a normalized vector u₀ is Π₀ = |u₀⟩⟨u₀|.  In coordinates, if u₀ has components (u₁, u₂, u₃), then\n   Π₀_{ij} = u_i\u2009u_j.\n\n3. Substitute u₀ = (1/√2, 0, −1/√2)ᵀ.  Then the matrix entries are:\n   Π₀ =\n     [ (1/√2)(1/√2),  (1/√2)(0),      (1/√2)(−1/√2) ]\n     [      0,              0,              0       ]\n     [ (−1/√2)(1/√2),  (−1/√2)(0),  (−1/√2)(−1/√2) ]\n\n   Simplify each element:\n     Π₀ =\n       [ 1/2,  0,   −1/2 ]\n       [  0,   0,     0  ]\n       [−1/2,  0,   1/2 ]\n\n4. This matrix satisfies Π₀²=Π₀ and projects any vector onto the line spanned by u₀, i.e. the zero‐eigenvalue subspace.\n\nThus the projection operator onto the zero‐eigenvalue subspace is:\n\n  Π₀ = \\begin{pmatrix}\n          1/2 & 0   & −1/2 \\\\\n          0   & 0   &  0   \\\\\n         −1/2 & 0   &  1/2\n        \\end{pmatrix}\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent 4fC0:\nStep 1: From subtask 2 we found that the zero‐eigenvalue subspace of P is one‐dimensional, spanned by the normalized eigenvector u₀ = (1/√2)(1,0,–1).  \n\nStep 2: The projection operator onto a one‐dimensional subspace spanned by u₀ is given by Π₀ = |u₀⟩⟨u₀|.  \n\nStep 3: Write u₀ as a column: u₀ = [1/√2, 0, –1/√2]ᵀ.
