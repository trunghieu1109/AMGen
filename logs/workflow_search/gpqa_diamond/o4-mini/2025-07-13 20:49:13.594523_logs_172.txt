============== task analysis ================
1. Extracted Information:
   • Particle: electron
   • Mean velocity: v = 2 × 10^8 m/s along x-direction
   • Position uncertainty: Δx = 0.1 nm = 1 × 10^–10 m
   • Provided answer choices for energy uncertainty ΔE: ~10^–19 J, ~10^–18 J, ~10^–17 J, ~10^–16 J

2. Relationships Between Components:
   • Heisenberg uncertainty principle connects Δx and momentum uncertainty Δp via Δx·Δp ≥ ħ/2
   • Momentum p ≈ m·v (electron mass m known constant)
   • Kinetic energy E = p^2/(2m) (nonrelativistic) ⇒ small Δp induces ΔE
   • Thus ΔE depends on Δp and on the nominal momentum p or velocity v
   • Constraints: Δx small ⇒ Δp large ⇒ ΔE nonzero; velocity along x fixes p direction

3. Field of Study:
   • Quantum mechanics (Heisenberg uncertainty principle)
   • Subfield: quantum kinematics / wave mechanics
   • Applications: atomic physics, quantum measurement limits, particle localization

4. Aspects Needing Clarification:
   • Use of nonrelativistic kinetic-energy formula vs. relativistic corrections (v ≈0.67c)
   • Whether Δp is taken at equality Δx·Δp = ħ/2 or with some coefficient
   • Precision of numerical constants (ħ, electron mass) to be used
   • Interpretation of provided choices (order‐of‐magnitude estimate vs. exact bound)
