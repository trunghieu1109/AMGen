============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
   - Total cobalt(II) concentration: [Co]ₜₒₜ = 1.0 × 10⁻² M.
   - Free thiocyanate concentration: [SCN⁻] = 0.10 M.
   - Stability (overall formation) constants for Co(II)–SCN⁻ complexes:
       • β₁ = 9   for Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ Co(SCN)⁺
       • β₂ = 40  for Co²⁺ + 2 SCN⁻ ⇌ Co(SCN)₂
       • β₃ = 63  for Co²⁺ + 3 SCN⁻ ⇌ Co(SCN)₃⁻
       • β₄ = 16  for Co²⁺ + 4 SCN⁻ ⇌ Co(SCN)₄²⁻
   - The "blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex" refers to the n = 2 species, Co(SCN)₂.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
   - Mass‐balance for cobalt: [Co]ₜₒₜ = [Co²⁺] + [Co(SCN)⁺] + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃⁻] + [Co(SCN)₄²⁻].
   - Equilibrium expressions:
       [Co(SCN)ₙ^(2–n)] = βₙ · [Co²⁺] · [SCN⁻]ⁿ,   for n = 1,2,3,4.
   - Since [SCN⁻]≫[Co]ₜₒₜ, [SCN⁻] can be approximated as constant in each βₙ expression.
   - The relative abundance of Co(SCN)₂ depends on β₂·[SCN⁻]² compared to the analogous terms for n = 1,3,4.
   - To find the percentage of Co(SCN)₂, one would compute its concentration via the equilibrium expression, sum all species, and form the ratio [Co(SCN)₂]/[Co]ₜₒₜ × 100%.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
   - Primary domain: Physical/Inorganic Chemistry (coordination equilibria).
   - Subfields: Analytical chemistry (complexation equilibria), chemical thermodynamics (stability constants).
   - Related mathematical concepts: solving nonlinear mass‐balance equations; use of formation constants.
   - Applications: spectrophotometric analysis, titration curves, speciation in solution.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
   - Are activity coefficients neglected (i.e., are concentrations treated as activities)?
   - Is ionic strength or temperature specified/constant?  
   - Does [SCN⁻] remain 0.10 M after complex formation, or should the small depletion by binding be accounted for?  
   - Are there side reactions (e.g., hydrolysis of Co²⁺) or competing equilibria omitted from the statement?

============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
   - Key numerical values:
     • Total cobalt(II) concentration c(Co) = 1.0×10⁻² M
     • Free thiocyanate concentration [SCN⁻] = 0.10 M
     • Cumulative stability constants for Co²⁺ + n SCN⁻ ⇌ Co(SCN)_n^(2–n):
       – β₁ = 9
       – β₂ = 40
       – β₃ = 63
       – β₄ = 16
   - Mathematical entities:
     • Species involved: Co²⁺, Co(SCN)⁺, Co(SCN)₂, Co(SCN)₃⁻, Co(SCN)₄²⁻
     • Equilibrium constants β₁–β₄ (cumulative formation constants)
   - Constraints:
     • Mass balance on total cobalt: [Co²⁺] + [Co(SCN)⁺] + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃⁻] + [Co(SCN)₄²⁻] = 1.0×10⁻² M
     • Fixed [SCN⁻] (excess ligand assumption)

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
   - The βₙ relate species concentrations:
     • [Co(SCN)_n^(2–n)] = βₙ ·[Co²⁺]·[SCN⁻]ⁿ
   - Mass‐action laws link free Co²⁺ to each complex species via ligand concentration
   - The percentage of ‘‘blue’’ dithiocyanato species refers to the fraction α₂ = [Co(SCN)₂]/(total Co)
   - The magnitude of β₂ relative to the other β’s influences how much Co(SCN)₂ forms under given [SCN⁻]
   - High [SCN⁻] drives equilibrium toward higher n complexes; relative β’s shift distribution among n=1–4

3. Identify the Field of Study:
   - Main domain: Coordination chemistry / chemical equilibrium (Physical chemistry)
   - Subfields and concepts: Complexation equilibria, speciation calculations, cumulative stability constants
   - Applications: Analytical spectrophotometry, ligand titrations, metalloprotein binding studies

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
   - Are activity coefficients assumed unity (ideal solution) or is ionic strength correction required?
   - Temperature and ionic strength are not specified—both affect β values
   - Which complex(es) correspond to ‘‘blue’’ color—common assumption is Co(SCN)₂ but notation should be confirmed
   - No information on possible side reactions (e.g., hydrolysis) or pH dependence
   - Interpretation of β₄ being smaller than β₃—might imply unexpected behavior at high ligand ratios
   - The provided multiple‐choice answers hint at a numerical speciation result but calculation steps are not detailed
