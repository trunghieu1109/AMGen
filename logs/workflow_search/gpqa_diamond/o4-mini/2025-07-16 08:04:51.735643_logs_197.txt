============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
   - Total cobalt concentration: c(Co) = 1×10⁻² M
   - Thiocyanate concentration: [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M
   - Stepwise stability constants for Co(II)–SCN complexes:
     • beta1 = 9
     • beta2 = 40
     • beta3 = 63
     • beta4 = 16
   - Equilibrium species inferred: Co²⁺, CoSCN⁺, Co(SCN)₂ (blue dithiocyanato species), Co(SCN)₃⁻, Co(SCN)₄²⁻

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
   - The stepwise formation reactions: Co²⁺ + n SCN⁻ ⇌ Co(SCN)ₙ^(2–n) (n = 1–4)
   - Stability constants (beta values) relate to cumulative product of stepwise K values, determining relative species abundance
   - Mass balance constraints:
     • [Co]ₜₒₜ = sum of all cobalt‐containing species
     • [SCN⁻]ₜₒₜ = free [SCN⁻] + n·[Co(SCN)ₙ^(2–n)]
   - High SCN⁻ excess shifts equilibria toward higher n complexes; the dithiocyanato species depends on beta2 and available SCN⁻

3. Identify the Field of Study:
   - Inorganic/analytical chemistry (complex equilibria)
   - Physical chemistry (chemical thermodynamics)
   - Concepts: stepwise and cumulative stability constants, mass‐action law, distribution of metal–ligand species

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
   - Definition of the “blue” complex: confirmation that it refers to Co(SCN)₂ rather than another charge state
   - Treatment of activity coefficients vs. ideal concentrations
   - Whether [SCN⁻] given is total or free in equilibrium calculations
   - Potential ionic strength or redox side reactions not mentioned
   - Computational challenges: solving coupled mass‐balance equations for all species distribution

These constants correspond to the formation of complexes with 1, 2, 3, and 4 thiocyanate ligands coordinated to Co(II), respectively. The possible species formed in solution based on these constants and ligands are: the free cobalt ion Co²⁺, the monothiocyanato complex CoSCN⁺, the dithiocyanato complex Co(SCN)₂ (which is the blue complex in question), the trithiocyanato complex Co(SCN)₃⁻, and the tetrathiocyanato complex Co(SCN)₄²⁻.

These species are all relevant because the stability constants correspond to the formation of complexes with 1 to 4 thiocyanate ligands, and the total cobalt concentration includes all these species.

The species present are Co2+, CoSCN+, Co(SCN)2, Co(SCN)3-, and Co(SCN)4^2-. The cumulative stability constants βn relate the concentration of each complex to the free Co2+ and free SCN- concentrations by: [Co(SCN)n^(2-n)] = βn * [Co2+] * [SCN-]^n for n=1 to 4. The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all species: c(Co) = [Co2+] + Σ [Co(SCN)n^(2-n)]. Substituting the expressions for complex concentrations, we get: c(Co) = [Co2+] * (1 + β1*[SCN-] + β2*[SCN-]^2 + β3*[SCN-]^3 + β4*[SCN-]^4). Solving for free Co2+ concentration: [Co2+] = c(Co) / (1 + β1*[SCN-] + β2*[SCN-]^2 + β3*[SCN-]^3 + β4*[SCN-]^4). The fraction of the dithiocyanato complex Co(SCN)2 is then: fraction = [Co(SCN)2] / c(Co) = (β2 * [Co2+] * [SCN-]^2) / c(Co) = β2 * [SCN-]^2 / (1 + β1*[SCN-] + β2*[SCN-]^2 + β3*[SCN-]^3 + β4*[SCN-]^4).

It also assumes that the cumulative stability constants are accurate and that the system is at equilibrium. This approach accounts for all possible cobalt species formed with 0 to 4 SCN- ligands and correctly normalizes the fraction to total cobalt. Thus, the derived equations are: 1) c(Co) = [Co2+] * (1 + β1*[SCN-] + β2*[SCN-]^2 + β3*[SCN-]^3 + β4*[SCN-]^4), 2) [Co2+] = c(Co) / (1 + β1*[SCN-] + β2*[SCN-]^2 + β3*[SCN-]^3 + β4*[SCN-]^4), 3) fraction of Co(SCN)2 = β2 * [SCN-]^2 / (1 + β1*[SCN-] + β2*[SCN-]^2 + β3*[SCN-]^3 + β4*[SCN-]^4).

The cumulative stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The species in equilibrium are Co2+, CoSCN+, Co(SCN)2, Co(SCN)3-, and Co(SCN)4^2-. The blue dithiocyanato complex corresponds to Co(SCN)2.\n\nStep 1: Define the free Co2+ concentration as [Co2+] = x.\n\nStep 2: Express concentrations of complex species using cumulative stability constants and free SCN- concentration [SCN-] = 0.1 M (assuming this is free SCN- as per problem statement):\n- [CoSCN+] = β1 * x * [SCN-] = 9 * x * 0.1 = 0.9x\n- [Co(SCN)2] = β2 * x * (0.1)^2 = 40 * x * 0.01 = 0.4x\n- [Co(SCN)3-] = β3 * x * (0.1)^3 = 63 * x * 0.001 = 0.063x\n- [Co(SCN)4^2-] = β4 * x * (0.1)^4 = 16 * x * 0.0001 = 0.0016x\n\nStep 3: Apply mass balance for cobalt:\nTotal Co = x + 0.9x + 0.4x + 0.063x + 0.0016x = x(1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016) = x * 2.3646\n\nGiven total Co concentration is 0.01 M, solve for x:\nx * 2.3646 = 0.01 => x = 0.01 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.00423 M\n\nStep 4: Calculate the concentration of Co(SCN)2:\n[Co(SCN)2] = 0.4 * x = 0.4 * 0.00423 ≈ 0.00169 M\n\nStep 5: Calculate fraction of Co(SCN)2 among total Co species:\nFraction = [Co(SCN)2] / total Co = 0.00169 / 0.01 = 0.169 or 16.9%\n\nStep 6: Confirm that this matches one of the provided choices.\n\nThus, the percentage of blue dithiocyanato complex Co(SCN)2 among all cobalt species is approximately 16.9%.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent jW0E:\nWe are given total cobalt concentration c(Co) = 10^-2 M and free thiocyanate concentration [SCN-] = 0.1 M. The cumulative stability constants β1 = 9, β2 = 40, β3 = 63, β4 = 16 correspond to the equilibria: Co2+ + n SCN- ⇌ Co(SCN)n^(2-n) for n = 1 to 4. The cumulative constants βn define the equilibrium concentrations relative to free Co2+ and free SCN- by: [Co(SCN)n^(2-n)] = βn * [Co2+] * [SCN-]^n. The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all cobalt species: c(Co) = [Co2+] + Σ [Co(SCN)n^(2-n)] for n=1 to 4. Using the βn and [SCN-], we express total Co as [Co2+](1 + β1*[SCN-] + β2*[SCN-]^2 + β3*[SCN-]^3 + β4*[SCN-]^4). Solving for [Co2+], we get [Co2+] = c(Co) / (1 + β1*[SCN-] + β2*[SCN-]^2 + β3*[SCN-]^3 + β4*[SCN-]^4). Then, the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex Co(SCN)2 is: fraction = [Co(SCN)2] / c(Co) = (β2 * [SCN-]^2 * [Co2+]) / c(Co) = β2 * [SCN-]^2 / (1 + β1*[SCN-] + β2*[SCN-]^2 + β3*[SCN-]^3 + β4*[SCN-]^4). Plugging in values: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16, [SCN-]=0.1 M, we calculate denominator = 1 + 9*0.1 + 40*0.01 + 63*0.001 + 16*0.0001 = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 ≈ 2.3646. Numerator = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4. Fraction = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.169, or 16.9%. This matches choice A). This approach assumes ideal solution behavior and that [SCN-] is the free concentration, which is reasonable given excess SCN-. This method correctly accounts for all species in equilibrium and uses cumulative constants properly. Thus, the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex Co(SCN)2 is 16.9%.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent RS9W:\nWe have total cobalt concentration c(Co) = 10^-2 M and free SCN- concentration [SCN-] = 0.1 M. The species present are Co2+, CoSCN+, Co(SCN)2, Co(SCN)3-, and Co(SCN)4^2-, with cumulative stability constants β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The cumulative constants βn correspond to the overall equilibrium constants for formation of Co(SCN)n species from Co2+ and n SCN- ions: β1 = [CoSCN+]/([Co2+][SCN-]), β2 = [Co(SCN)2]/([Co2+][SCN-]^2), etc. The fraction of a species is its concentration divided by total cobalt concentration. Using the mass balance on cobalt: c(Co) = [Co2+] + [CoSCN+] + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3-] + [Co(SCN)4^2-]. Each species concentration can be expressed in terms of [Co2+] and [SCN-] and βn: [CoSCN+] = β1[Co2+][SCN-], [Co(SCN)2] = β2[Co2+][SCN-]^2, etc. Summing all gives c(Co) = [Co2+] * (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4). From this, [Co2+] = c(Co) / (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4). The fraction of Co(SCN)2 is then f = [Co(SCN)2]/c(Co) = β2[SCN-]^2 / (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4). Plugging in values: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16, [SCN-]=0.1, we get denominator = 1 + 9*0.1 + 40*(0.1)^2 + 63*(0.1)^3 + 16*(0.1)^4 = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = approx 2.3646. Numerator = 40*(0.1)^2 = 40*0.01 = 0.4. Fraction f = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.169, or 16.9%. Thus, the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex Co(SCN)2 among all cobalt species is approximately 16.9%.

The question is to identify which species corresponds to the blue dithiocyanato complex. The species formed are Co²⁺ (no ligand), CoSCN⁺ (one SCN- ligand), Co(SCN)₂ (two SCN- ligands), Co(SCN)₃⁻ (three SCN- ligands), and Co(SCN)₄²⁻ (four SCN- ligands). The term \'dithiocyanato\' literally means two thiocyanate ligands coordinated to cobalt. Therefore, the blue dithiocyanato complex must be Co(SCN)₂. This is consistent with the naming convention and the problem statement. Previous attempts might have confused the charge or the number of ligands, but the key is the prefix \'di-\' indicating two ligands. Hence, the blue complex is the species with two SCN- ligands, Co(SCN)₂.\n\n### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent Lu3o:\nB)\n\n### Sub-task 1.1: Formulate the cumulative stability and mass-balance equations to derive an expression for the fraction of Co(SCN)2 among total Co species.

The cumulative stability constants β1 = 9, β2 = 40, β3 = 63, β4 = 16 correspond to the equilibria: Co2+ + n SCN- ⇌ Co(SCN)n^(2-n) for n = 1 to 4. The cumulative constants βn define the equilibrium concentrations relative to free Co2+ and free SCN- by: [Co(SCN)n^(2-n)] = βn * [Co2+] * [SCN-]^n. The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all cobalt species: c(Co) = [Co2+] + Σ [Co(SCN)n^(2-n)] for n=1 to 4. Using the βn and [SCN-], we express total Co as [Co2+](1 + β1*[SCN-] + β2*[SCN-]^2 + β3*[SCN-]^3 + β4*[SCN-]^4). Solving for [Co2+], we get [Co2+] = c(Co) / (1 + β1*[SCN-] + β2*[SCN-]^2 + β3*[SCN-]^3 + β4*[SCN-]^4). Then, the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex Co(SCN)2 is: fraction = [Co(SCN)2] / c(Co) = (β2 * [SCN-]^2 * [Co2+]) / c(Co) = β2 * [SCN-]^2 / (1 + β1*[SCN-] + β2*[SCN-]^2 + β3*[SCN-]^3 + β4*[SCN-]^4).

The species present are Co2+, CoSCN+, Co(SCN)2, Co(SCN)3-, and Co(SCN)4^2-. The cumulative stability constants βn relate the concentration of each complex to the free Co2+ and free SCN- concentrations by: [Co(SCN)n^(2-n)] = βn * [Co2+] * [SCN-]^n for n=1 to 4. The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all species: c(Co) = [Co2+] + Σ [Co(SCN)n^(2-n)]. Substituting the expressions for complex concentrations, we get: c(Co) = [Co2+] * (1 + β1*[SCN-] + β2*[SCN-]^2 + β3*[SCN-]^3 + β4*[SCN-]^4). Solving for free Co2+ concentration: [Co2+] = c(Co) / (1 + β1*[SCN-] + β2*[SCN-]^2 + β3*[SCN-]^3 + β4*[SCN-]^4). The fraction of the dithiocyanato complex Co(SCN)2 is then: fraction = [Co(SCN)2] / c(Co) = (β2 * [Co2+] * [SCN-]^2) / c(Co) = β2 * [SCN-]^2 / (1 + β1*[SCN-] + β2*[SCN-]^2 + β3*[SCN-]^3 + β4*[SCN-]^4). This equation assumes that the given [SCN-] is the free concentration, that activity coefficients are unity (ideal solution), and that no other side reactions or species are present.

The species present are Co2+, CoSCN+, Co(SCN)2, Co(SCN)3-, and Co(SCN)4^2-. The cumulative stability constants βn relate the concentration of each complex to the free Co2+ and free SCN- concentrations by: [Co(SCN)n^(2-n)] = βn * [Co2+] * [SCN-]^n for n=1 to 4. The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all species: c(Co) = [Co2+] + Σ [Co(SCN)n^(2-n)]. Substituting the expressions for complex concentrations, we get: c(Co) = [Co2+] * (1 + β1*[SCN-] + β2*[SCN-]^2 + β3*[SCN-]^3 + β4*[SCN-]^4). Solving for free Co2+ concentration: [Co2+] = c(Co) / (1 + β1*[SCN-] + β2*[SCN-]^2 + β3*[SCN-]^3 + β4*[SCN-]^4). The fraction of the dithiocyanato complex Co(SCN)2 is then: fraction = [Co(SCN)2] / c(Co) = (β2 * [Co2+] * [SCN-]^2) / c(Co) = β2 * [SCN-]^2 / (1 + β1*[SCN-] + β2*[SCN-]^2 + β3*[SCN-]^3 + β4*[SCN-]^4). This equation assumes that the given [SCN-] is the free concentration, that activity coefficients are unity (ideal solution), and that no other side reactions or species are present. It also assumes that the cumulative stability constants are accurate and that the system is at equilibrium. This approach accounts for all possible cobalt species formed with 0 to 4 SCN- ligands and correctly normalizes the fraction to total cobalt. Thus, the derived equations are: 1) c(Co) = [Co2+] * (1 + β1*[SCN-] + β2*[SCN-]^2 + β3*[SCN-]^3 + β4*[SCN-]^4), 2) [Co2+] = c(Co) / (1 + β1*[SCN-] + β2*[SCN-]^2 + β3*[SCN-]^3 + β4*[SCN-]^4), 3) fraction of Co(SCN)2 = β2 * [SCN-]^2 / (1 + β1*[SCN-] + β2*[SCN-]^2 + β3*[SCN-]^3 + β4*[SCN-]^4).
