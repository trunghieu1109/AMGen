============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- Hamiltonian operator: H = ε σ·n
- ε: constant with dimensions of energy
- σ = (σ_x, σ_y, σ_z): Pauli spin matrices (2×2 Hermitian matrices with eigenvalues ±1)
- n = (n_x, n_y, n_z): arbitrary unit vector (||n|| = 1)

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- H = ε(n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z) is a weighted sum of Pauli matrices
- Unit‐vector condition ||n||=1 implies (σ·n)^2 = I, so H^2 = ε^2 I
- The algebraic identity H^2 = ε^2 I constrains the spectrum to two values symmetric about zero with magnitude ε

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- Quantum mechanics (spin-½ systems)
- Linear algebra/operator theory (eigenvalue problems for 2×2 Hermitian matrices)
- Subfields: quantum information, magnetic resonance, spin dynamics

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- Whether H is expressed directly with Pauli matrices (implying eigenvalues ±ε) or via spin operators S = (ħ/2)σ (introducing factors of ħ/2)
- Any implicit physical constants (e.g., μ_B, ħ) or unit conventions that could affect the numerical factors
- The role or definition of n beyond being a unit vector (e.g., physical direction of a field)
