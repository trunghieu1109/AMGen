============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
   • Operators and Basis:
     – We have three components of a vector operator \(\vec P=(P_x,P_y,P_z)\).
     – The basis is the set of eigenvectors of \(P_z\).
   • Matrix representations (in the \(P_z\)-eigenbasis, dimension 3):
     – \(P_x\):
       Row 1: \((0,\\,\hbar/\sqrt2,\\,0)\)
       Row 2: \((\hbar/\sqrt2,\\,0,\\,\hbar/\sqrt2)\)
       Row 3: \((0,\\,\hbar/\sqrt2,\\,0)\)
     – \(P_y\):
       Row 1: \((0,\\,-i\hbar/\sqrt2,\\,0)\)
       Row 2: \((i\hbar/\sqrt2,\\,0,\\,-i\hbar/\sqrt2)\)
       Row 3: \((0,\\,i\hbar/\sqrt2,\\,0)\)
     – \(P_z\):
       Row 1: \((\hbar,\\,0,\\,0)\)
       Row 2: \((0,\\,0,\\,0)\)
       Row 3: \((0,\\,0,\\,-\hbar)\)
   • Quantum state:
     – The system is prepared in the eigenstate of \(P_x\) with eigenvalue \(-\hbar\).
     – Its coordinate (column) vector in the \(P_z\)-basis is
       \[\psi=\begin{pmatrix}-1/2 \\ 1/\sqrt2 \\ -1/2\end{pmatrix},\]
       which is normalized since \((1/2)^2+(1/\sqrt2)^2+(1/2)^2=1\).
   • Question metrics:
     – Compute the uncertainty \(\Delta P_z\) for this state.
     – Provided multiple‐choice answers: \(\hbar\), \(\hbar/2\), \(\hbar/\sqrt2\), \(\sqrt2\,\hbar\).

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
   • Operator algebra:
     – \(P_x, P_y, P_z\) satisfy the usual angular‐momentum commutation relations \([P_i,P_j]=i\hbar\,\epsilon_{ijk}P_k\).  These matrix forms correspond to the spin-1 representation of SU(2).
   • State–operator interplay:
     – The given state is an eigenvector of \(P_x\) (eigenvalue \(-\hbar\)), so \(P_x\psi=-\hbar\psi\).
     – To find \(\Delta P_z\), one needs \(\langle P_z\rangle=\psi^\dagger P_z\psi\) and \(\langle P_z^2\rangle=\psi^\dagger P_z^2\psi\).
   • Constraints and significance:
     – The normalization of \(\psi\) ensures expectation values are well‐defined.
     – The orthonormality of the \(P_z\)-eigenbasis simplifies matrix‐element calculations.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
   • Primary domain: Quantum mechanics (matrix mechanics formulation).
   • Relevant subfields:
     – Angular momentum in quantum systems (spin-1 representation).
     – Linear algebra over complex vector spaces (Hermitian operators).
   • Common contexts:
     – Quantum measurement and uncertainty relations.
     – Problems in undergraduate/graduate quantum physics courses and competition exams.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
   • All quantities are explicitly given and unambiguous:
     – The state vector is properly normalized.
     – Operator matrices are fully specified.
   • Possible subtlety: sign conventions for eigenstates of \(P_x\) and overall phase—but these do not affect uncertainties.
   • No further assumptions appear necessary; problem statement is complete as given.

Extract and Summarize Given Information:\n   • Operators and Basis:\n     – We have three components of a vector operator \\(\\vec P=(P_x,P_y,P_z)\\).\n     – The basis is the set of eigenvectors of \\(P_z\\).\n   • Matrix representations (in the \\(P_z\\)-eigenbasis, dimension 3):\n     – \\(P_x\\):\n       Row 1: \\((0,\\\\,\\hbar/\\sqrt2,\\\\,0)\\)\n       Row 2: \\((\\hbar/\\sqrt2,\\\\,0,\\\\,\\hbar/\\sqrt2)\\)\n       Row 3: \\((0,\\\\,\\hbar/\\sqrt2,\\\\,0)\\)\n     – \\(P_y\\):\n       Row 1: \\((0,\\\\,-i\\hbar/\\sqrt2,\\\\,0)\\)\n       Row 2: \\((i\\hbar/\\sqrt2,\\\\,0,\\\\,-i\\hbar/\\sqrt2)\\)\n       Row 3: \\((0,\\\\,i\\hbar/\\sqrt2,\\\\,0)\\)\n     – \\(P_z\\):\n       Row 1: \\((\\hbar,\\\\,0,\\\\,0)\\)\n       Row 2: \\((0,\\\\,0,\\\\,0)\\)\n       Row 3: \\((0,\\\\,0,\\\\,-\\hbar)\\)\n   • Quantum state:\n     – The system is prepared in the eigenstate of \\(P_x\\) with eigenvalue \\(-\\hbar\\).\n     – Its coordinate (column) vector in the \\(P_z\\)-basis is\n       \\[\\psi=\\begin{pmatrix}-1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt2 \\\\ -1/2\\end{pmatrix},\\]\n       which is normalized since \\((1/2)^2+(1/\\sqrt2)^2+(1/2)^2=1\\).\n   • Question metrics:\n     – Compute the uncertainty \\(\\Delta P_z\\) for this state.\n     – Provided multiple‐choice answers: \\(\\hbar\\), \\(\\hbar/2\\), \\(\\hbar/\\sqrt2\\), \\(\\sqrt2\\,\\hbar\\).\n\n2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:\n   • Operator algebra:\n     – \\(P_x, P_y, P_z\\) satisfy the usual angular‐momentum commutation relations \\([P_i,P_j]=i\\hbar\\,\\epsilon_{ijk}P_k\\).  These matrix forms correspond to the spin-1 representation of SU(2).\n   • State–operator interplay:\n     – The given state is an eigenvector of \\(P_x\\) (eigenvalue \\(-\\hbar\\)), so \\(P_x\\psi=-\\hbar\\psi\\).\n     – To find \\(\\Delta P_z\\), one needs \\(\\langle P_z\\rangle=\\psi^\\dagger P_z\\psi\\) and \\(\\langle P_z^2\\rangle=\\psi^\\dagger P_z^2\\psi\\).\n   • Constraints and significance:\n     – The normalization of \\(\\psi\\) ensures expectation values are well‐defined.\n     – The orthonormality of the \\(P_z\\)-eigenbasis simplifies matrix‐element calculations.\n\n3. Identify the Field of Study:\n   • Primary domain: Quantum mechanics (matrix mechanics formulation).\n   • Relevant subfields:\n     – Angular momentum in quantum systems (spin-1 representation).\n     – Linear algebra over complex vector spaces (Hermitian operators).\n   • Common contexts:\n     – Quantum measurement and uncertainty relations.\n     – Problems in undergraduate/graduate quantum physics courses and competition exams.\n\n4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:\n   • All quantities are explicitly given and unambiguous:\n     – The state vector is properly normalized.\n     – Operator matrices are fully specified.\n   • Possible subtlety: sign conventions for eigenstates of \\(P_x\\) and overall phase—but these do not affect uncertainties.\n   • No further assumptions appear necessary; problem statement is complete as given..These are just pieces of information related to the question. You are not required to answer the question — just follow what is defined in the instruction: Sub-task 4: Synthesize and choose the most consistent computation of ΔP_z matching provided choices..   \n\nRelated sub-task questions and answers:\n\n### Sub-task 2: Synthesize and choose the most consistent computation of the expectation value of P_z. \n\n ### thinking by Final Decision Agent kbiE:\nWe need ⟨P_z⟩=ψ†P_zψ with ψ=(−½,1/√2,−½)ᵀ and P_z=diag(ℏ,0,−ℏ). Compute term‐by‐term: \n\n|ψ₁|²ℏ = (¼)ℏ,\n|ψ₂|²·0 = 0,\n|ψ₃|²(−ℏ) = (¼)(−ℏ)=−(¼)ℏ.\n\nSumming gives ⟨P_z⟩=ℏ/4−ℏ/4=0. Both agents 3EwP and CFkU arrive at 0, whereas vTxM also finds ⟨P_z⟩=0 before discussing ΔP_z. Thus the most consistent result for ⟨P_z⟩ is 0.\n\n### answer by Final Decision Agent kbiE:\nC)\n\n### Sub-task 3: Synthesize and choose the most consistent computation of ⟨P_z^2⟩. \n\n ### thinking by Final Decision Agent 8t8O:\nWe need to compute ⟨P_z^2⟩ for the state ψ=(−1/2,1/√2,−1/2)^T in the P_z‐eigenbasis. 1) The matrix P_z is diagonal with entries (ħ,0,−ħ), so P_z^2=diag(ħ^2,0,ħ^2). 2) The squared magnitudes of the components of ψ are |ψ₁|²=1/4, |ψ₂|²=1/2, |ψ₃|²=1/4. 3) Thus ⟨P_z^2⟩=ħ^2·(1/4)+0·(1/2)+ħ^2·(1/4)=½ħ^2. All three derived answers agree on ħ^2/2. Mapping back to the provided multiple‐choice for ΔP_z gave C) as the consistent choice for the final uncertainty, and the chain‐of‐thought agents that computed ⟨P_z^2⟩ correctly also pointed to C).\n\n### answer by Final Decision Agent 8t8O:\nC)\n\n### Sub-task 4: Based on the outputs from Sub-task 2 and Sub-task 3, compute the uncertainty ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z^2⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩^2) and match to provided choices. \n\n ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent UpyP:\nFrom Sub-task 2: ⟨P_z⟩=0. From Sub-task 3: ⟨P_z^2⟩=ħ^2/2. Hence Var(P_z)=⟨P_z^2⟩−⟨P_z⟩^2=ħ^2/2. Therefore ΔP_z=√(ħ^2/2)=ħ/√2, which corresponds to choice C).\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent 98Pq:\nWe know from Sub‐task 2 that ⟨P_z⟩=0. From Sub‐task 3 we have ⟨P_z^2⟩=½ℏ^2. By definition the uncertainty is\n   ΔP_z=√(⟨P_z^2⟩−⟨P_z⟩^2)=√(½ℏ^2−0^2)=ℏ/√2.\nComparing to the provided choices (A)ℏ, (B)ℏ/2, (C)ℏ/√2, (D)√2ℏ the correct match is C).\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent eVKT:\n1.
