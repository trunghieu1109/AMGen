============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
   - The problem presents four candidate effective particles:
     * Magnon
     * Skyrmion
     * Pion
     * Phonon
   - The question asks: “Which of the following (effective) particles is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry?”
   - Key concepts:
     • “Effective particle” refers to a quasiparticle or composite excitation in a system.
     • “Spontaneously-broken symmetry” indicates that the ground state does not share a symmetry of the system’s underlying laws.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
   - Each listed particle/quasiparticle is known to arise in physical systems that may exhibit broken symmetries.
   - The condition “associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry” means that an excitation is interpreted as the Nambu–Goldstone boson or a topological excitation linked to that broken symmetry.
   - The problem hinges on identifying which candidate does not fit this pattern of being a Goldstone mode or topological defect tied to spontaneous symmetry breaking.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
   - Domains involved:
     • Condensed matter physics (magnons, phonons, skyrmions)
     • Particle physics (pions)
   - Subfields/concepts:
     • Spontaneous symmetry breaking and Goldstone’s theorem
     • Quasiparticles in solid-state systems
     • Topological solitons (skyrmions)
     • Chiral symmetry breaking in quantum chromodynamics (pions)

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
   - The precise definition of “associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry” in each context (e.g., phonons arise from broken translational symmetry in crystals).
   - Whether skyrmions are to be considered Goldstone modes or topological excitations of a broken symmetry.
   - The level of rigor expected: phenomenological vs. field-theoretic justification.
   - Potential ambiguity in the word “effective” when applied to fundamental particles like the pion versus quasiparticles in condensed matter.

They arise due to the spontaneous breaking of spin rotational symmetry in ferromagnets or antiferromagnets. Skyrmions are topological solitons or spin textures in magnetic systems and can be viewed as topological excitations related to the broken symmetry of the magnetic order parameter. Pions are mesons in particle physics that emerge as (approximate) Nambu-Goldstone bosons from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Phonons are quantized lattice vibrations in a crystal lattice and are associated with the spontaneous breaking of continuous translational symmetry when atoms form a periodic lattice structure. In summary, magnons, skyrmions, and pions are directly associated with spontaneously broken symmetries (spin rotational symmetry, topological order related to magnetic symmetry, and chiral symmetry respectively). Phonons, although arising from lattice vibrations, are also linked to the breaking of continuous translational symmetry due to the formation of a crystal lattice. Therefore, all four effective particles are associated with spontaneously broken symmetries in their respective contexts. However, if we consider the question\'s focus on effective particles as Nambu-Goldstone modes or topological excitations from spontaneously broken symmetries, skyrmions are topological solitons rather than Goldstone bosons but still relate to broken symmetry. Hence, all four have a connection to spontaneous symmetry breaking, but the nature of that connection differs. The question asks which is not associated with spontaneously broken symmetry, so based on this detailed analysis, none of them is completely unrelated. However, among the options, skyrmions are topological objects rather than Goldstone bosons, but they still arise in systems with broken symmetry. Thus, the most appropriate answer for the particle not directly associated as a Nambu-Goldstone mode of a spontaneously broken symmetry might be the skyrmion, but since the question says "effective particle" and skyrmions are topological excitations, the one least directly linked to spontaneous symmetry breaking in the usual sense could be the skyrmion. But since the question is about association, phonons also arise due to broken translational symmetry, magnons from broken spin symmetry, pions from broken chiral symmetry. Skyrmions are topological defects but not Goldstone bosons themselves. Therefore, the summary is: Magnon - spin rotational symmetry broken; Skyrmion - topological excitation associated with magnetic order; Pion - chiral symmetry broken; Phonon - translational symmetry broken. All are linked to spontaneously broken symmetries, but skyrmions are not Goldstone bosons but topological solitons. The question asks which is not associated with spontaneously broken symmetry, so none is completely unrelated, but among these, skyrmion is the odd one out as it is a topological excitation rather than a Goldstone boson. Therefore, the sub-task answer is a summary of origins and contexts, as requested.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent naoD:\nTo address the sub-task, we analyze the physical origin and context of each effective particle:\n\n1. Magnon: Magnons are quasiparticles representing collective excitations of electron spins in a lattice, specifically spin waves in a magnetically ordered system. They arise due to spontaneous breaking of continuous spin rotational symmetry (e.g., SU(2) symmetry) in a ferromagnet or antiferromagnet. The ground state chooses a preferred spin orientation, breaking the symmetry, and magnons are the associated Nambu-Goldstone bosons.\n\n2. Skyrmion: Skyrmions are topological solitons or particle-like excitations characterized by a nontrivial winding number in the spin texture of a magnetic material. They can be viewed as stable topological defects arising from the order parameter space of the system. Skyrmions appear in systems with broken symmetries, often linked to broken continuous symmetries and topological considerations, but they are not Goldstone bosons themselves. They are stable configurations due to topology rather than fluctuations around a symmetric ground state.\n\n3. Pion: Pions are mesons in particle physics, understood as the Nambu-Goldstone bosons of spontaneously broken chiral symmetry (approximate SU(2)_L × SU(2)_R symmetry) in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The QCD vacuum breaks chiral symmetry spontaneously, and pions emerge as low-energy excitations associated with this breaking.\n\n4. Phonon: Phonons are quantized lattice vibrations in a crystalline solid. They arise due to spontaneous breaking of continuous translational symmetry when atoms form a periodic lattice. The continuous translation symmetry of free space is broken down to a discrete subgroup, and phonons are the corresponding Nambu-Goldstone bosons associated with this broken symmetry.\n\nSummary: Magnons, pions, and phonons arise as Nambu-Goldstone bosons from spontaneously broken continuous symmetries (spin rotational, chiral, and translational, respectively). Skyrmions are topological excitations or solitons, not directly associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking in the same manner but rather with topological properties of the order parameter field.\n\nThis detailed understanding clarifies the context and physical origin of each effective particle.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent LZru:\nTo summarize the physical origin and context of each effective particle:\n\n1. Magnon: A magnon is a quasiparticle representing a collective excitation of the spin structure in a magnetically ordered system. It arises due to the spontaneous breaking of spin rotational symmetry in a ferromagnet or antiferromagnet. The ground state breaks the continuous spin rotational symmetry, and magnons are the associated Goldstone bosons.\n\n2. Skyrmion: A skyrmion is a topological soliton or particle-like excitation in a field theory or condensed matter system. In magnetic systems, skyrmions are stable spin textures characterized by a nontrivial topological winding number. They arise due to the topology of the order parameter space but are not themselves Goldstone bosons. Instead, they are topological excitations related to the broken symmetry phase.\n\n3. Pion: Pions are mesons in particle physics that emerge as (pseudo-)Goldstone bosons from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The approximate chiral symmetry of the QCD Lagrangian is spontaneously broken in the vacuum, giving rise to pions as effective low-energy excitations.\n\n4. Phonon: Phonons are quasiparticles representing quantized lattice vibrations in a crystalline solid. They arise due to the spontaneous breaking of continuous translational symmetry by the crystal lattice formation. The continuous translational symmetry of free space is broken down to discrete lattice translations, and phonons can be viewed as Goldstone bosons associated with this breaking.\n\nThus, magnons, pions, and phonons are Goldstone bosons associated with spontaneously broken continuous symmetries (spin rotational, chiral, and translational, respectively). Skyrmions, however, are topological solitons or defects in the order parameter field and not Goldstone bosons themselves, although they exist in phases with broken symmetry. They represent a different kind of excitation related to topology rather than a symmetry-breaking mode.\n\nThis detailed understanding clarifies the physical origin and context of each effective particle.\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent N8BG:\nA) Magnon: Quasiparticle representing spin wave excitations in magnetically ordered materials, arising from the spontaneous breaking of spin rotational symmetry.\n\nB) Skyrmion: Topological soliton or spin texture in magnetic systems, representing a topological excitation connected to the broken symmetry of the magnetic order parameter.\n\nC) Pion: Meson in particle physics acting as an approximate Nambu-Goldstone boson resulting from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics.\n\nD) Phonon: Quantized lattice vibration in crystals, associated with spontaneous breaking of continuous translational symmetry due to the formation of a periodic lattice.\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent naoD:\nB)\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent LZru:\nB)\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 1: Synthesize the most consistent and accurate summary of origins. \n\n then justify completely and detailedly, step-by-step why you think so in the "thinking" entry. \n                Consider all cases that are possible to happen.\n                Avoid some unclear explainations, such as "Using the circle equation or the condition for four points to be concyclic, we derive an equation in x.

Pion: Pions are mesons in particle physics, understood as the Nambu-Goldstone bosons of spontaneously broken chiral symmetry (approximate SU(2)_L × SU(2)_R symmetry) in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The QCD vacuum breaks chiral symmetry spontaneously, and pions emerge as low-energy excitations associated with this breaking.\n\n4. Phonon: Phonons are quantized lattice vibrations in a crystalline solid. They arise due to spontaneous breaking of continuous translational symmetry when atoms form a periodic lattice. The continuous translation symmetry of free space is broken down to a discrete subgroup, and phonons are the corresponding Nambu-Goldstone bosons associated with this broken symmetry.\n\nSummary: Magnons, pions, and phonons arise as Nambu-Goldstone bosons from spontaneously broken continuous symmetries (spin rotational, chiral, and translational, respectively). Skyrmions are topological excitations or solitons, not directly associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking in the same manner but rather with topological properties of the order parameter field.\n\nThis detailed understanding clarifies the context and physical origin of each effective particle.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent LZru:\nTo summarize the physical origin and context of each effective particle:\n\n1. Magnon: A magnon is a quasiparticle representing a collective excitation of the spin structure in a magnetically ordered system. It arises due to the spontaneous breaking of spin rotational symmetry in a ferromagnet or antiferromagnet. The ground state breaks the continuous spin rotational symmetry, and magnons are the associated Goldstone bosons.\n\n2. Skyrmion: A skyrmion is a topological soliton or particle-like excitation in a field theory or condensed matter system. In magnetic systems, skyrmions are stable spin textures characterized by a nontrivial topological winding number. They arise due to the topology of the order parameter space but are not themselves Goldstone bosons. Instead, they are topological excitations related to the broken symmetry phase.\n\n3. Pion: Pions are mesons in particle physics that emerge as (pseudo-)Goldstone bosons from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The approximate chiral symmetry of the QCD Lagrangian is spontaneously broken in the vacuum, giving rise to pions as effective low-energy excitations.\n\n4. Phonon: Phonons are quasiparticles representing quantized lattice vibrations in a crystalline solid. They arise due to the spontaneous breaking of continuous translational symmetry by the crystal lattice formation. The continuous translational symmetry of free space is broken down to discrete lattice translations, and phonons can be viewed as Goldstone bosons associated with this breaking.\n\nThus, magnons, pions, and phonons are Goldstone bosons associated with spontaneously broken continuous symmetries (spin rotational, chiral, and translational, respectively). Skyrmions, however, are topological solitons or defects in the order parameter field and not Goldstone bosons themselves, although they exist in phases with broken symmetry.

Specifically, magnons arise from the spontaneous breaking of continuous spin rotational symmetry in magnetically ordered systems; pions emerge as approximate Nambu–Goldstone bosons from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics; and phonons correspond to the Nambu–Goldstone bosons associated with the spontaneous breaking of continuous translational symmetry when a crystal lattice forms. On the other hand, skyrmions are topological solitons or stable spin textures characterized by a nontrivial topological winding number. While skyrmions exist in phases where symmetry is broken, they are not Goldstone bosons themselves. Instead, they are topological excitations related to the topology of the order parameter manifold in the broken symmetry phase. Their stability and existence depend on topological conservation laws rather than the presence of a continuous broken symmetry mode. Therefore, skyrmions are not directly associated with a spontaneously-broken continuous symmetry in the same way as magnons, pions, and phonons.
