============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
   • Crystal type: Rhombohedral (all edges equal, all angles equal).  
   • Interatomic distance (edge length a): 10 Å.  
   • Lattice angles: α = β = γ = 30°.  
   • Plane of interest: (111) Miller indices.  
   • Provided multiple-choice options for interplanar spacing d₁₁₁:  
     – 9.54 Å  
     – 8.95 Å  
     – 9.08 Å  
     – 10.05 Å  

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
   • In a rhombohedral lattice, edge length a and angle α determine the metric tensor components.  
   • Interplanar spacing dₕₖₗ is a function of (h,k,l), the lattice parameters a and α, and the angle between crystallographic axes.  
   • The (111) plane is symmetrically oriented; its spacing depends on both length and acute angles.  
   • Conditions like equal angles (α=β=γ) simplify formulas for d₁₁₁ but still require careful metric evaluation.  

3. Identify the Field of Study:
   • Domain: Crystallography / Solid State Physics.  
   • Subfields: Lattice geometry, Miller indices, interplanar spacing.  
   • Related mathematical concepts: 3D geometry, metric tensors, trigonometry.  
   • Applications: X-ray diffraction, materials science, crystallographic analysis.  

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
   • Angle value: α = 30° is unusually small for rhombohedral lattices—verify whether this refers to the internal angle or an obtuse supplement.  
   • Definition of “interatomic distance”: assumed to be the primitive lattice constant a.  
   • Sign convention or normalization for Miller indices in non‐orthogonal cells.  
   • Potential units consistency: Ångström throughout.  
   • Possible alternative lattice settings (hexagonal vs. primitive rhombohedral) influencing formula choice.

Analyze Relationships Between Components:\n   • In a rhombohedral lattice, edge length a and angle α determine the metric tensor components.  \n   • Interplanar spacing dₕₖₗ is a function of (h,k,l), the lattice parameters a and α, and the angle between crystallographic axes.  \n   • The (111) plane is symmetrically oriented; its spacing depends on both length and acute angles.  \n   • Conditions like equal angles (α=β=γ) simplify formulas for d₁₁₁ but still require careful metric evaluation.  \n\n3. Identify the Field of Study:\n   • Domain: Crystallography / Solid State Physics.  \n   • Subfields: Lattice geometry, Miller indices, interplanar spacing.  \n   • Related mathematical concepts: 3D geometry, metric tensors, trigonometry.  \n   • Applications: X-ray diffraction, materials science, crystallographic analysis.  \n\n4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:\n   • Angle value: α = 30° is unusually small for rhombohedral lattices—verify whether this refers to the internal angle or an obtuse supplement.  \n   • Definition of “interatomic distance”: assumed to be the primitive lattice constant a.  \n   • Sign convention or normalization for Miller indices in non‐orthogonal cells.  \n   • Potential units consistency: Ångström throughout.  \n   • Possible alternative lattice settings (hexagonal vs. primitive rhombohedral) influencing formula choice..These are just pieces of information related to the question.

The direct‐lattice metric has g_{ii}=a^2 and g_{ij}=a^2 cosα for i≠j. The spacing is d_{hkl}=1/√(h_i g*_{ij} h_j), where g* is the inverse metric.\n\nStep 2: Derive the closed‐form for (111).  One finds 1/d_{111}^2 =3/[a^2(1+2 cosα)], so\nd_{111}=a·√[(1+2 cosα)/3].\n\nStep 3: Substitute a=10\u2009Å, α=30° (cos30°=√3/2≈0.866025):\n(1+2·0.866025)=2.73205 → divided by 3 gives ≈0.910683 → sqrt ≈0.95431 → times 10\u2009Å gives d_{111}≈9.5431\u2009Å.\n\nStep 4: Compare to choices: 9.54\u2009Å corresponds exactly to choice A).\n\n### answer by Final Decision Agent h6Al:\nA)\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 2_1: Compare the computed interplanar spacing with the provided choices and select the closest match.Given previous attempts and feedback, carefully consider where you could go wrong in your latest attempt.
