============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
   • Operators: P→ with components Px, Py, Pz.
   • Matrix representations in the Pz‐eigenbasis (ordered as eigenvalues +ħ, 0, –ħ).
     – Px = ħ/√2·[[0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0]].
     – Py = ħ/√2·[[0, –i, 0], [i, 0, –i], [0, i, 0]].
     – Pz = ħ·diag(1, 0, –1).
   • Basis: The column basis vectors are eigenvectors of Pz with eigenvalues +ħ, 0, –ħ.
   • System state: eigenstate of Px with eigenvalue –ħ, given explicitly as |ψ⟩ = (–½, 1/√2, –½)ᵀ.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
   • Commutation/Algebra: Px, Py, Pz form a spin‐1 SU(2) algebra (noncommuting angular‐momentum–type operators).
   • State choice: |ψ⟩ is an eigenvector of Px, so ⟨ψ|Px|ψ⟩ = –ħ, and it is expressed in the Pz basis.
   • Implication for Pz: Uncertainty ΔPz involves ⟨ψ|Pz|ψ⟩ and ⟨ψ|Pz²|ψ⟩. The Pz‐basis representation of |ψ⟩ gives direct amplitudes for each Pz eigenvalue.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
   • Domain: Quantum mechanics, specifically spin‐1 systems.
   • Subfields/Concepts: Linear algebra of Hermitian operators; angular momentum; operator expectation values and variances; the uncertainty principle.
   • Applications: Quantum measurement, spin polarization, quantum information, physics competitions.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
   • Basis ordering is assumed (+ħ, 0, –ħ) but should be confirmed.
   • The state vector is normalized (norm = 1); no further assumptions.
   • No other ambiguities in operator definitions or constraints.
