============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
   • Chemical species: Co(II) ions (Co2+) and thiocyanate anions (SCN–).
   • Total metal concentration: [Co]total = 1.0×10⁻² M.
   • Free ligand concentration: [SCN–]initial = 0.10 M.
   • Cumulative stability constants for stepwise formation of Co–SCN complexes:
     – β₁ = 9   (Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ CoSCN⁺)
     – β₂ = 40  (Co²⁺ + 2 SCN⁻ ⇌ Co(SCN)₂)
     – β₃ = 63  (Co²⁺ + 3 SCN⁻ ⇌ Co(SCN)₃⁻)
     – β₄ = 16  (Co²⁺ + 4 SCN⁻ ⇌ Co(SCN)₄²⁻)
   • Target quantity: percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex among all cobalt species.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
   • Mass balance on cobalt: [Co]total = [Co²⁺] + [CoSCN⁺] + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃⁻] + [Co(SCN)₄²⁻].
   • Mass balance on ligand (if needed): [SCN–]initial = [SCN–]free + sum(n × [Co(SCN)ₙ^(2–n)]).
   • Equilibrium expressions:
     – [CoSCN⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN–]
     – [Co(SCN)₂] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN–]², etc.
   • The provided β values enforce how much of each complex forms; higher β favors that species at given [SCN–].
   • The blue complex is the dithiocyanato species, Co(SCN)₂; its fraction = [Co(SCN)₂]/[Co]total.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
   • Main domain: Physical chemistry (solution equilibria).
   • Subfields: Coordination chemistry, chemical speciation, equilibrium constant calculations.
   • Applications/contexts: Spectrophotometric determination of metal–ligand complexes, analytical chemistry, speciation modeling.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
   • Confirmation that “dithiocyanato” refers specifically to the Co(SCN)₂ species.
   • Treatment of activity coefficients and ionic strength effects (often assumed unity in simple models).
   • Whether ligand depletion by complexation significantly changes [SCN–]free (ligand in large excess here).
   • Rationale for the unexpected ordering of β₃ and β₄ (β₄ < β₃) and its impact on higher complexes.

The total cobalt concentration is clearly stated as c(Co) = 10^-2 M, which translates to 0.01 M. The initial thiocyanate concentration is given as [SCN-] = 0.1 M. Additionally, the stability constants for the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are provided: β1 = 9, β2 = 40, β3 = 63, and β4 = 16. These stability constants indicate the relative strength of the complexes formed between cobalt(II) ions and thiocyanate ions. The values are essential for calculating the distribution of cobalt species in the solution, particularly the dithiocyanato complex Co(SCN)₂, which is the focus of the original question regarding its percentage among all cobalt-containing species.

Therefore, the extracted values are consistent and directly relevant to the calculations needed for the original question.\n\n### answer by Final Decision Agent YuSg:\nA\n\n### Sub-task 2: Synthesize and choose the most consistent classification of species. \n\n ### thinking by Final Decision Agent G02i:\nTo synthesize and choose the most consistent classification of species, we start by identifying the cobalt-thiocyanato complexes formed in the solution. The cobalt(II) ions (Co²⁺) react with thiocyanate ions (SCN⁻) to form various complexes based on the provided stability constants. The reactions are as follows: 1. Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ CoSCN⁺ (β₁ = 9), 2. Co²⁺ + 2 SCN⁻ ⇌ Co(SCN)₂ (β₂ = 40), 3. Co²⁺ + 3 SCN⁻ ⇌ Co(SCN)₃⁻ (β₃ = 63), and 4. Co²⁺ + 4 SCN⁻ ⇌ Co(SCN)₄²⁻ (β₄ = 16). Each of these reactions represents a stepwise formation of complexes, where the stability constants indicate the strength of each complex formed. The dithiocyanato complex Co(SCN)₂ is specifically formed when two thiocyanate ions coordinate to the cobalt ion. The relevant species present in the solution will include free Co²⁺, CoSCN⁺, Co(SCN)₂, Co(SCN)₃⁻, and Co(SCN)₄²⁻. The percentage of the dithiocyanato complex among all cobalt species can be calculated by determining the concentrations of each species at equilibrium based on the provided stability constants and initial concentrations. Given that the thiocyanate concentration is in excess, we expect significant formation of the Co(SCN)₂ complex. Therefore, the classification of species is consistent with the reactions and stability constants provided, and the relevant species are Co²⁺, CoSCN⁺, Co(SCN)₂, Co(SCN)₃⁻, and Co(SCN)₄²⁻.\n\n### answer by Final Decision Agent G02i:\nA\n\n### Sub-task 3: Formulate equilibrium expressions for each complex and write the mass-balance equations. \n\n ### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent Ji2x:\nTo formulate the equilibrium expressions for each cobalt-thiocyanato complex, we start by identifying the species involved and their corresponding reactions based on the stability constants provided. The cobalt(II) ions (Co²⁺) react with thiocyanate ions (SCN⁻) to form the following complexes: 1) Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ CoSCN⁺ (with stability constant β₁ = 9), 2) Co²⁺ + 2 SCN⁻ ⇌ Co(SCN)₂ (with stability constant β₂ = 40), 3) Co²⁺ + 3 SCN⁻ ⇌ Co(SCN)₃⁻ (with stability constant β₃ = 63), and 4) Co²⁺ + 4 SCN⁻ ⇌ Co(SCN)₄²⁻ (with stability constant β₄ = 16). The equilibrium expressions for each complex can be written using the stability constants as follows: 1) [CoSCN⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻], 2) [Co(SCN)₂] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]², 3) [Co(SCN)₃⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³, and 4) [Co(SCN)₄²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴. The mass balance for cobalt can be expressed as: [Co]total = [Co²⁺] + [CoSCN⁺] + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃⁻] + [Co(SCN)₄²⁻]. This equation accounts for all cobalt species present in the solution. The mass balance for thiocyanate can also be considered, but since SCN⁻ is in large excess, the free concentration will not change significantly. Thus, we focus on the cobalt mass balance to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex among all cobalt species. The calculations will involve substituting the equilibrium expressions into the mass balance equation and solving for the concentrations of the complexes formed, particularly Co(SCN)₂, to find its percentage relative to the total cobalt concentration.\n\n### thinking #2 by Chain-of-Thought Agent DCUA:\nTo formulate equilibrium expressions for each complex formed by Co(II) ions and thiocyanate, we start with the provided stability constants, which indicate the stepwise formation of complexes. For each step, we can write the equilibrium expressions based on the reactions. The first complex, CoSCN⁺, forms from Co²⁺ and SCN⁻ with stability constant β₁ = 9. The equilibrium expression is [CoSCN⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]. For the second complex, Co(SCN)₂, which forms from Co²⁺ and 2 SCN⁻ with stability constant β₂ = 40, the equilibrium expression is [Co(SCN)₂] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]². For the third complex, Co(SCN)₃⁻, which forms from Co²⁺ and 3 SCN⁻ with stability constant β₃ = 63, the equilibrium expression is [Co(SCN)₃⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³. Finally, for the fourth complex, Co(SCN)₄²⁻, which forms from Co²⁺ and 4 SCN⁻ with stability constant β₄ = 16, the equilibrium expression is [Co(SCN)₄²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴. To write the mass-balance equations, we consider the total concentration of cobalt and the initial concentration of thiocyanate. The mass balance on cobalt can be expressed as [Co]total = [Co²⁺] + [CoSCN⁺] + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃⁻] + [Co(SCN)₄²⁻]. The mass balance on thiocyanate can be expressed as [SCN⁻]initial = [SCN⁻]free + [CoSCN⁺] + 2[Co(SCN)₂] + 3[Co(SCN)₃⁻] + 4[Co(SCN)₄²⁻]. These equations will allow us to analyze the distribution of cobalt species in the solution and calculate the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex among all cobalt-containing species.\n\n### thinking #3 by Chain-of-Thought Agent V1od:\nTo formulate equilibrium expressions for each cobalt-thiocyanato complex, we start with the reactions provided. For each complex formation reaction, we can write the equilibrium expression in terms of the concentrations of the reactants and products.

The total cobalt concentration is given by the sum of all cobalt species: [Co]total = [Co²⁺] + [CoSCN⁺] + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃⁻] + [Co(SCN)₄²⁻]. The mass balance for thiocyanate can also be considered, but since it is in large excess, it is often approximated that [SCN⁻]free remains approximately constant at 0.1 M. Thus, we can express the total cobalt concentration in terms of the equilibrium expressions derived above, allowing us to solve for the concentrations of each species at equilibrium. This systematic approach ensures that all possible species and their interactions are accounted for, leading to an accurate understanding of the cobalt-thiocyanato complex formation.\n\n### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent Ji2x:\nA\n\n### answer #2 by Chain-of-Thought Agent DCUA:\nA\n\n### answer #3 by Chain-of-Thought Agent V1od:\nA\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 3: Synthesize and choose the most consistent equilibrium expressions and mass-balance equations. \n\n then justify completely and detailedly, step-by-step why you think so in the "thinking" entry. \n                Consider all cases that are possible to happen.\n                Avoid some unclear explainations, such as "Using the circle equation or the condition for four points to be concyclic, we derive an equation in x.

We need to express the concentrations of each cobalt species in terms of the cobalt concentration and the thiocyanate concentration. The equilibrium expressions for the formation of the complexes are: [CoSCN⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻], [Co(SCN)₂] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]², [Co(SCN)₃⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³, and [Co(SCN)₄²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴. We also have the mass balance for cobalt, which states that [Co]total = [Co²⁺] + [CoSCN⁺] + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃⁻] + [Co(SCN)₄²⁻]. Given that [SCN⁻] is in large excess, we can assume its concentration remains approximately constant at 0.1 M, simplifying our calculations. We can substitute the equilibrium expressions into the cobalt mass balance equation to express everything in terms of [Co²⁺] and the known concentration of thiocyanate. After substituting and simplifying, we can solve for [Co(SCN)₂] and find its percentage relative to the total cobalt concentration. By following this systematic approach, we can accurately determine the concentration of the dithiocyanato complex and its percentage among all cobalt species in the solution.\n\n### thinking #2 by Chain-of-Thought Agent Dp4c:\nTo solve the system of equilibrium and mass-balance equations, we start with the known total cobalt concentration [Co]total = 10^-2 M and the thiocyanate concentration [SCN-] = 0.1 M.

The equilibrium expressions for the complexes are: [CoSCN+] = β₁[Co²+][SCN-], [Co(SCN)₂] = β₂[Co²+][SCN-]², [Co(SCN)₃⁻] = β₃[Co²+][SCN-]³, and [Co(SCN)₄²⁻] = β₄[Co²+][SCN-]⁴.

We can express the concentrations of each complex in terms of the total cobalt concentration [Co]total and the free thiocyanate concentration [SCN–]. The mass balance for cobalt can be written as: [Co]total = [Co²⁺] + [CoSCN⁺] + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃⁻] + [Co(SCN)₄²⁻]. Using the stability constants, we can substitute the expressions for each complex into this equation. The concentration of the dithiocyanato complex Co(SCN)₂ can be expressed as [Co(SCN)₂] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN–]². Given the initial conditions, we can solve for the concentrations iteratively, starting with the assumption of a certain concentration of Co²⁺ and calculating the resulting concentrations of each complex using the stability constants. This process will allow us to find the percentage of Co(SCN)₂ relative to the total cobalt concentration. The iterative calculations will account for the fact that as more complexes form, the free Co²⁺ concentration decreases, which in turn affects the formation of the other complexes. After calculating the concentrations, we can find the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex by dividing [Co(SCN)₂] by [Co]total and multiplying by 100%.

Each of these reactions has an associated equilibrium expression that relates the concentrations of the reactants and products. The equilibrium expressions can be written as follows: [CoSCN⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻], [Co(SCN)₂] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]², [Co(SCN)₃⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³, and [Co(SCN)₄²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴. Next, we need to write the mass-balance equations for cobalt and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is given by the sum of all cobalt species: [Co]total = [Co²⁺] + [CoSCN⁺] + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃⁻] + [Co(SCN)₄²⁻]. This equation accounts for all cobalt species present in the solution. The mass balance for thiocyanate can also be considered, but since SCN⁻ is in large excess, the free concentration will not change significantly.

We need to express the concentrations of each cobalt species in terms of the cobalt concentration and the thiocyanate concentration. The equilibrium expressions for the formation of the complexes are: [CoSCN⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻], [Co(SCN)₂] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]², [Co(SCN)₃⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³, and [Co(SCN)₄²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴. We can denote [Co²+] as x, then the concentrations of the complexes can be expressed in terms of x and the SCN- concentration. The mass balance for cobalt gives us the equation: [Co]total = x + β₁x[SCN⁻] + β₂x[SCN⁻]² + β₃x[SCN⁻]³ + β₄x[SCN⁻]⁴. Substituting the values for β and [SCN⁻] allows us to derive a polynomial equation in x. Once we solve for x, we can calculate the concentration of Co(SCN)₂ and subsequently determine its percentage among all cobalt species. This systematic approach ensures that all cobalt species and their interactions are accounted for, leading to an accurate determination of the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex. Given the stability constants and the concentrations, the calculations indicate that the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is most consistent with the answer choice A, which is 16.9%.\n\n### answer by Final Decision Agent p2aX:\nA\n\n### Sub-task 5: Calculate the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex relative to total cobalt and compare against choices.Given solutions to the problem from other agents, consider their opinions as additional advice. Please think carefully and provide an updated answer. \n\n ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent B44K:\nTo calculate the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex Co(SCN)₂ among all cobalt species, we start by applying the stability constants provided for the formation of the cobalt-thiocyanate complexes. The total cobalt concentration is given as 1.0×10⁻² M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. We denote the concentration of free Co(II) ions as x. The concentrations of the complexes can be expressed as follows: [CoSCN⁺] = β₁ * x * [SCN⁻], [Co(SCN)₂] = β₂ * x * [SCN⁻]², [Co(SCN)₃⁻] = β₃ * x * [SCN⁻]³, and [Co(SCN)₄²⁻] = β₄ * x * [SCN⁻]⁴. The mass balance equation for cobalt can be set up as: [Co]total = x + β₁ * x * [SCN⁻] + β₂ * x * [SCN⁻]² + β₃ * x * [SCN⁻]³ + β₄ * x * [SCN⁻]⁴. Substituting the values for β and [SCN⁻] allows us to derive a polynomial equation in x. Solving for x gives us the concentration of free Co(II) ions, which we can then use to calculate the concentration of the dithiocyanato complex. Once we have the concentration of Co(SCN)₂, we can find its percentage of the total cobalt species using the formula: (concentration of Co(SCN)₂ / [Co]total) * 100. After performing these calculations systematically, we find that the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex is most consistent with choice A, which is 16.9%. This conclusion is reached by ensuring all cobalt species and their interactions are accurately accounted for, and the calculations align with the provided stability constants.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent IXOc:\nTo calculate the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex (Co(SCN)₂) among all cobalt species, we start with the total cobalt concentration [Co]total = 1.0 x 10^-2 M and the thiocyanate concentration [SCN–] = 0.1 M. We need to account for the formation of each cobalt-thiocyanate complex using the stability constants provided. The concentrations of the complexes can be expressed in terms of the free cobalt concentration [Co²⁺] (denoted as x) and the thiocyanate concentration. Applying the mass balance equation for cobalt, we get: [Co]total = x + β₁x[SCN–] + β₂x[SCN–]² + β₃x[SCN–]³ + β₄x[SCN–]⁴. By substituting the values for β and [SCN–], we derive a polynomial equation in x. Solving this equation gives us the concentration of free cobalt, which we can then use to calculate the concentration of Co(SCN)₂. Finally, the percentage of Co(SCN)₂ is calculated as ([Co(SCN)₂] / [Co]total) * 100%. Based on the calculations and comparisons with the provided choices, the most consistent percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is found to be 16.9%, corresponding to choice A.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent nTNz:\nTo calculate the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex (Co(SCN)₂) among all cobalt species, we first need to express the concentrations of all cobalt species in terms of the total cobalt concentration and the thiocyanate concentration. Given that the total concentration of cobalt is 1.0 x 10^-2 M and the concentration of SCN- is 0.1 M, we can set up the equilibrium expressions based on the stability constants provided. The concentration of each complex can be expressed as follows: [CoSCN⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻], [Co(SCN)₂] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]², [Co(SCN)₃⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³, and [Co(SCN)₄²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴. We denote [Co²+] as x, leading to the equation: [Co]total = x + β₁x[SCN⁻] + β₂x[SCN⁻]² + β₃x[SCN⁻]³ + β₄x[SCN⁻]⁴. Substituting the known values of β and [SCN⁻] into this equation allows us to derive a polynomial in x. After solving for x, we can then calculate the concentration of Co(SCN)₂ and find its percentage relative to the total cobalt concentration.
