============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
   • 13 identical particles, each carrying charge q = 2e (e = elementary charge).
   • Negligible mass (dynamics irrelevant; only electrostatics matters).
   • 12 charges constrained to lie at distance R = 2 m from a central point P (i.e. on a sphere of radius 2 m).
   • The 13th charge is fixed at point P (the sphere’s center).
   • Coulomb interaction governs potential energy: U_{ij} = k q_i q_j/r_{ij}.
   • Candidate answers for minimum total energy: 2.822×10^-26 J, 5.645×10^-26 J, 7.056×10^-27 J, 122.330 J.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
   • Each peripheral charge interacts with the central charge at distance R: contributes energy U_central = 12·(k q^2/R).
   • Peripheral–peripheral interactions depend on mutual chord lengths on the sphere. Minimizing energy requires maximizing those distances.
   • The classical Thomson problem for N = 12 suggests a regular icosahedral arrangement on the sphere to minimize the sum of 1/r_{ij} terms.
   • Constraints fix radial distances; only angular coordinates vary, so symmetry arguments drive the minimal configuration.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
   • Domain: classical electrostatics (physics) and energy minimization problems.
   • Subfield: discrete geometry/Thomson problem (optimal distribution of point charges on a sphere).
   • Applications: atomic and molecular modeling, spherical codes, mathematical competitions.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
   • Numerical constant values: e (elementary charge), k = 1/(4πϵ₀).
   • Should distances among peripheral charges be computed as straight-line chords (yes) vs. surface arcs (no).
   • Uniqueness and stability of the icosahedral arrangement vs. possible local minima.
   • Units consistency (meters, Coulombs, Joules).
   • Assumption that peripheral charges are free to move only on the spherical surface (no additional constraints).

Extract and Summarize Given Information:\n   • 13 identical particles, each carrying charge q = 2e (e = elementary charge).\n   • Negligible mass (dynamics irrelevant; only electrostatics matters).\n   • 12 charges constrained to lie at distance R = 2 m from a central point P (i.e. on a sphere of radius 2 m).\n   • The 13th charge is fixed at point P (the sphere’s center).\n   • Coulomb interaction governs potential energy: U_{ij} = k q_i q_j/r_{ij}.\n   • Candidate answers for minimum total energy: 2.822×10^-26 J, 5.645×10^-26 J, 7.056×10^-27 J, 122.330 J.\n\n2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:\n   • Each peripheral charge interacts with the central charge at distance R: contributes energy U_central = 12·(k q^2/R).\n   • Peripheral–peripheral interactions depend on mutual chord lengths on the sphere. Minimizing energy requires maximizing those distances.\n   • The classical Thomson problem for N = 12 suggests a regular icosahedral arrangement on the sphere to minimize the sum of 1/r_{ij} terms.\n   • Constraints fix radial distances; only angular coordinates vary, so symmetry arguments drive the minimal configuration.\n\n3. Identify the Field of Study:\n   • Domain: classical electrostatics (physics) and energy minimization problems.\n   • Subfield: discrete geometry/Thomson problem (optimal distribution of point charges on a sphere).\n   • Applications: atomic and molecular modeling, spherical codes, mathematical competitions.\n\n4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:\n   • Numerical constant values: e (elementary charge), k = 1/(4πϵ₀).\n   • Should distances among peripheral charges be computed as straight-line chords (yes) vs. surface arcs (no).\n   • Uniqueness and stability of the icosahedral arrangement vs. possible local minima.\n   • Units consistency (meters, Coulombs, Joules).\n   • Assumption that peripheral charges are free to move only on the spherical surface (no additional constraints)..These are just pieces of information related to the question.
