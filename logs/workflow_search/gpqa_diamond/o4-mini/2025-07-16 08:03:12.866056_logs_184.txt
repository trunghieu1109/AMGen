============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
   • Hamiltonian operator H = ε σ·n , where:
     – ε is a constant with dimension of energy.
     – σ = (σ_x, σ_y, σ_z) are the Pauli spin matrices (2×2 Hermitian operators satisfying σ_iσ_j = δ_{ij}I + iε_{ijk}σ_k).
     – n = (n_x,n_y,n_z) is an arbitrary unit vector (‖n‖ = 1).
   • The question presents four multiple-choice eigenvalue sets: {+ε,–ε}, {+(εħ/2),–(εħ/2)}, {+1,–1}, {+ħ/2,–ħ/2}.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
   • H is a linear combination of Pauli matrices along direction n, i.e. H = ε(n_xσ_x + n_yσ_y + n_zσ_z).
   • Since σ·n is itself a Hermitian operator with spectrum ±1 (for any unit n), H scales that spectrum by ε.
   • Key constraint: n being a unit vector normalizes σ·n so that (σ·n)^2 = I, implying H^2 = ε^2I.
   • This implies two distinct eigenvalues symmetric about zero, independent of n’s orientation.
   • The choice of units (whether ℏ=1 or not) may introduce an extra factor of ħ/2 in some conventions.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
   • Domain: Quantum mechanics / quantum spin systems.
   • Subfields & concepts: 2×2 matrix theory, SU(2) algebra, spectral decomposition of spin-½ operators.
   • Applications & contexts: spin dynamics, magnetic resonance, quantum computing (qubit Hamiltonians), mathematical physics textbooks and competitions.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
   • Convention for Planck’s constant: is ħ set to 1, or should factors of ħ/2 appear explicitly?
   • Sign or range of ε: typically positive, but could be any real constant.
   • The direction of n is arbitrary—does the context assume any particular basis or coordinate system?
   • The problem implicitly uses properties of Pauli matrices; a reader unfamiliar with these algebraic identities may need them stated.

The vector σ represents the vector of Pauli spin matrices (σ_x, σ_y, σ_z), which are 2x2 Hermitian matrices representing spin-1/2 operators in quantum mechanics. The vector n is an arbitrary unit vector, meaning it has magnitude 1, and is used to define the direction along which the spin operator σ is projected. This means n is a real 3-dimensional vector with components (n_x, n_y, n_z) satisfying n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1. Thus, the Hamiltonian is a linear combination of the Pauli matrices weighted by the components of n and scaled by ε. Each component is well-defined: ε is a scalar energy constant, σ is the vector of Pauli matrices, and n is a unit vector in real 3D space. This classification is standard in quantum mechanics for spin-1/2 systems and is consistent with the problem statement. There is no ambiguity in the identification of these components given the problem\'s definitions.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent BQDG:\nThe Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n. Here, ε (epsilon) is explicitly stated as a constant with the dimension of energy, so it represents an energy scale or coupling constant in the system. The vector σ = (σ_x, σ_y, σ_z) represents the Pauli spin matrices, which are well-known 2x2 Hermitian matrices used to describe spin-1/2 systems in quantum mechanics. Each σ_i is a matrix operator acting on a two-dimensional Hilbert space. The vector n = (n_x, n_y, n_z) is an arbitrary unit vector, meaning it has magnitude 1 (|n| = 1). This vector defines the direction along which the spin operator is projected. Thus, the Hamiltonian is a linear combination of Pauli matrices weighted by the components of n and scaled by ε. In summary, ε is a scalar energy constant, σ are the Pauli spin matrices (operators), and n is a unit vector in three-dimensional space specifying the direction of the spin projection. This classification is standard in quantum mechanics for spin Hamiltonians, and no ambiguity arises from the problem statement.

The operator σ·n is defined as σ·n = n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z. The Pauli matrices satisfy the algebraic relation σ_i σ_j = δ_ij I + i ε_ijk σ_k, where δ_ij is the Kronecker delta and ε_ijk is the Levi-Civita symbol. Using this, we compute (σ·n)^2: (σ·n)^2 = (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z)^2 = n_x^2 σ_x^2 + n_y^2 σ_y^2 + n_z^2 σ_z^2 + cross terms. Since each σ_i^2 = I, the sum of the squared terms is (n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2) I = I because n is a unit vector. The cross terms involve products like σ_i σ_j for i ≠ j, which can be expressed as i ε_ijk σ_k plus a term proportional to the identity. However, these cross terms cancel out due to the antisymmetric nature of ε_ijk and the symmetric product n_i n_j. Therefore, (σ·n)^2 = I. This implies that the eigenvalues λ of σ·n satisfy λ^2 = 1, so λ = ±1. Since H = ε σ·n, the eigenvalues of H are ε times the eigenvalues of σ·n, i.e., ±ε. This result holds for any unit vector n, confirming that the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are ±ε.

The operator σ·n is defined as σ·n = n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z. The Pauli matrices satisfy the algebraic relation σ_i σ_j = δ_ij I + i ε_ijk σ_k, where δ_ij is the Kronecker delta and ε_ijk is the Levi-Civita symbol. Using this, we compute (σ·n)^2: (σ·n)^2 = (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z)^2 = n_x^2 σ_x^2 + n_y^2 σ_y^2 + n_z^2 σ_z^2 + cross terms. Since each σ_i^2 = I, the sum of the squared terms is (n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2) I = I because n is a unit vector. The cross terms involve products like σ_i σ_j for i ≠ j, which can be expressed as i ε_ijk σ_k plus a term proportional to the identity. However, these cross terms cancel out due to the antisymmetric nature of ε_ijk and the symmetric product n_i n_j. Therefore, (σ·n)^2 = I.

Since the Hamiltonian is H = ε σ·n, the eigenvalues of H are simply ε times the eigenvalues of σ·n. Thus, the eigenvalues of H are ±ε. This holds for any unit vector n and any real constant ε with dimensions of energy. Other choices involving factors of ħ/2 do not apply here because the Hamiltonian is given explicitly as ε σ·n without additional factors. Therefore, the correct eigenvalues are +ε and -ε.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent qKRX:\nThe operator σ·n, where σ are the Pauli matrices and n is a unit vector, has eigenvalues ±1 because (σ·n)^2 = I. This comes from the algebraic properties of the Pauli matrices: each σ_i squared is the identity, and the cross terms vanish due to the antisymmetric Levi-Civita symbol and symmetric products of components of n. Since H = ε σ·n, the eigenvalues of H are simply ε times the eigenvalues of σ·n. Therefore, the eigenvalues of H are ±ε. This reasoning holds regardless of the direction of n, as long as it is a unit vector, and independent of the value of ε. The eigenvalues do not include factors of ħ or 1/2 because the problem is formulated with ε having energy dimension directly scaling σ·n, whose eigenvalues are ±1. Hence, the correct choice is the eigenvalues ±ε.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent kMQK:\nFrom the previous analysis, we know that the operator σ·n has eigenvalues ±1 because (σ·n)^2 = I, where I is the identity operator. Since H = ε σ·n, the eigenvalues of H are simply ε times the eigenvalues of σ·n. Therefore, the eigenvalues of H are ±ε. This result holds regardless of the direction of the unit vector n, and no additional factors such as ħ/2 appear in the eigenvalues because the given Hamiltonian is directly proportional to σ·n with a scalar ε that has dimensions of energy.
