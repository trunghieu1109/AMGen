============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
   - Star: radius R_* = 1.5 R_☉.  
   - Planet 1: radius R_{p1} = 1 R_⊕; circular orbit; transit impact parameter b_1 = 0.2; orbital period P_1 = 3 d.
   - Planet 2: radius R_{p2} = 2.5 R_⊕; circular orbit; same orbital plane (same inclination) as planet 1; unknown period P_2 (choices ≃7.5, 12.5, 33.5, 37.5 d).
   - Both transit and occultation are required for planet 2.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
   - Geometry: impact parameter b = (a cos i)/R_* for circular orbits, with inclination i common to both planets.
   - Transit condition: |b| < 1 + R_p/R_*; occultation condition (for circular orbit): |b| < 1 – R_p/R_*.
   - For planet 2, maximum semi‐major axis a_{2,max} is set by b_{2,max} = 1 – (R_{p2}/R_*).
   - Via Kepler’s third law: P ∝ a^{3/2}, so P_{2,max} scales as (a_{2,max}/a_1)^{3/2}·P_1.
   - Impact: larger R_{p2}/R_* tightens the bound on a_{2,max}, hence on P_{2,max}.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
   - Domain: exoplanetary astronomy / orbital mechanics.
   - Subfields: transit and occultation geometry, Kepler’s laws, celestial mechanics.
   - Applications: exoplanet detection strategies, light‐curve modeling, astrophysical parameter inference.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
   - Stellar mass M_* is not given; often assumed M_* ≃ M_☉ for Kepler’s law.
   - Exact orbital inclination i is unspecified (only impact parameter of planet 1 is known).
   - Neglect of eccentricity is implicit; real orbits may be slightly elliptical.
   - Units consistency: R_* in R_☉ vs. a in physical units (AU) must be addressed if computing a explicitly.
