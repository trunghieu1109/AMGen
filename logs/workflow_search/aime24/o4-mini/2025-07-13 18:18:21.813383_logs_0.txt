============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
   • Distance of walk: 9 kilometers.
   • Aya’s walking speeds and total times (including coffee break of t minutes):
     – At speed s km/h: total time = 4 hours (240 minutes).
     – At speed (s + 2) km/h: total time = 2 hours 24 minutes (144 minutes).
     – At speed (s + 1/2) km/h: total time unknown; to be determined (including same t).
   • Coffee‐shop break: duration t minutes, the same in each scenario.
   • Walk segment time = (distance) ÷ (walking speed); total time = walk time + t.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
   • For speed s: 9/s hours + t minutes = 240 minutes.  
   • For speed (s+2): 9/(s+2) hours + t minutes = 144 minutes.  
   • The unknown total at speed (s+1/2) will be 9/(s + 1/2) hours + t minutes.
   • These two equations link s and t; once s and t are consistent with the first two cases, they determine the third.
   • Constraints:
     – s > 0 (positive walking speed).
     – t ≥ 0 (nonnegative coffee‐shop time).
   • The coffee‐shop duration t is a constant offset added to each walking time.
   • Hypothesis: Solve the first two time‐balance equations to find s and t, then compute the third.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
   • Primary domain: algebra (rational equations with time, rate, and distance).
   • Subfields/concepts: linear equations, unit conversion between hours and minutes.
   • Related contexts: word problems in secondary mathematics, time‐rate‐distance modeling, elementary applications in physics.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
   • Units consistency: ensure conversion between hours and minutes is handled correctly.
   • Implicit assumption: coffee break t is the same for all walking speeds.
   • No ambiguity in distance or speeds; all values are numeric symbols to solve for.
   • Potential challenge: determining whether t emerges as an integer number of minutes once s is found.
