============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
   • Points in the plane: O=(0,0), A=(1/2,0), B=(0,√3/2).
   • Family 𝓕 of segments 𝐏𝐐 of length 1, with P on the x-axis, Q on the y-axis, lying in the first quadrant.
     – Coordinates of a generic segment: P=(t,0), Q=(0,√(1−t²)), for 0≤t≤1.
   • Segment AB connects A and B, and there is a unique point C on AB (distinct from endpoints) such that C lies on AB but on no other segment in 𝓕.
   • It is given that OC² = p/q in lowest terms, and the problem asks for p+q.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
   • The line AB is the locus of points λA + (1−λ)B for 0≤λ≤1.  
   • Each segment in 𝓕 is the straight line between a point on the x-axis and a point on the y-axis satisfying x²+y²=1.  
   • The condition “C does not belong to any segment from 𝓕 other than AB” imposes a tangency‐type or extremal condition.  
   • Geometric constraint: C must lie on AB but outside the union of all other unit‐length chords from axes.
   • Hypothesis: C is determined by the envelope or boundary of these chords, leading to a unique intersection on AB.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
   • Primary domain: Coordinate (analytic) geometry.  
   • Concepts involved: loci of points, line‐segment families, distance constraints (x²+y²=1), envelopes of lines.  
   • Potential contexts: olympiad geometry, problems on configurations of segments in the plane.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
   • Precise meaning of “does not belong to any segment”: interior only or including endpoints?  
   • Whether the family 𝓕 includes the trivial endpoints P=(1,0) or Q=(0,1) (although those are unit‐distance).  
   • How the uniqueness of C is established: is it via extremal distance from O or via non‐intersection with 𝓕?
   • Possible multiple coverage regions by 𝓕 and how AB intersects that region.

Parameterize AB by t∈[0,1]: C(t)=(½(1−t), (√3/2)t). 2. Parameterize ℱ by θ∈[0,π/2]: P(θ)=(cosθ,0), Q(θ)=(0,sinθ). A point X lies on segment P(θ)Q(θ) iff there exists s∈[0,1] with X=(1−s)P(θ)+sQ(θ). 3. Plug X=C(t): (½(1−t), (√3/2)t) = ((1−s)cosθ, s\u2009sinθ). This gives two equations: (1−t)/2 = (1−s)cosθ and (√3/2)t = s\u2009sinθ. 4. We require 0≤t≤1, 0< s<1 (so C is interior to PQ, not at P or Q), and θ∈(0,π/2). 5. To avoid PQ coinciding with AB, we note AB has slope −√3; PQ has slope −tanθ, so we exclude tanθ=√3 (θ=π/3). 6. Hence C(t) lies on some PQ≠AB exactly when there exist θ∈(0,π/2), θ≠π/3 and s∈(0,1) satisfying\nthe two linear equations above.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent P2Pu:\nWe wish to find, for a general point C on AB and a general segment PQ∈ℱ (P=(cosθ,0),Q=(0,sinθ)), the condition that C lies on PQ (not just on the lines) and that PQ≠AB. 1. Parameterize C on AB by t∈[0,1]:\n   C(t) = (x_C,y_C) = (½(1–t), (√3/2)t).\n2. C lies on the segment PQ if and only if C is a convex combination of P,Q: there exists u∈[0,1] with\n   C = (1–u)P + u\u2009Q.\n Equating coordinates gives\n   ½(1–t) = (1–u)cosθ,    (√3/2)t = u\u2009sinθ.\n3. Solve for u from the second: u = ( (√3/2)t )/(sinθ ) = (√3\u2009t)/(2\u2009sinθ ).  Substitute into the first: \n   ½(1–t) = cosθ – u\u2009cosθ = cosθ – (√3\u2009t\u2009cosθ)/(2\u2009sinθ).\n Multiply both sides by 2 and rearrange:\n   1–t + √3\u2009t\u2009cotθ = 2\u2009cosθ\n ⇒ t(√3\u2009cosθ – sinθ) = sinθ(2\u2009cosθ – 1).\n4. Hence C(t) lies on PQ exactly when there exists θ∈[0,π/2] with θ≠π/3 (so PQ≠AB) such that\n   t = [sinθ(2\u2009cosθ – 1)]/(√3\u2009cosθ – sinθ),\n   u = (√3\u2009t)/(2\u2009sinθ),\n   with t∈[0,1], u∈[0,1].\n5.

Parameterize ℱ: A segment has P=(p,0), Q=(0,q) with p²+q²=1, p,q≥0; set p=cosθ, q=sinθ for θ∈[0,π/2]. 3. Collinearity and betweenness: C lies on PQ if there exists s∈[0,1] with C=(1−s)P+sQ.  Thus (1−s)cosθ=½(1−t),   s\u2009sinθ=(√3/2)t. 4. Eliminate s: from the second, s=(√3/2\u2009t)/sinθ.  Substitute into the first: [1−(√3/2\u2009t)/sinθ]cosθ=½(1−t).  Multiply by 2\u2009sinθ: 2\u2009sinθ\u2009cosθ−√3\u2009t\u2009cosθ=(1−t)sinθ.  Since 2\u2009sinθ\u2009cosθ=sin2θ, rearrange to t(√3\u2009cosθ−sinθ)=sin2θ−sinθ. 5.

Parameterizing AB: A=(½,0), B=(0,√3/2). Any point C on the line through A and B can be written A + t(B–A), where t∈ℝ. Compute B–A=(–½,√3/2). Thus C(t)=(½ – ½t, 0 + (√3/2)t) = (½(1–t), (√3/2)t). Restricting t∈[0,1] yields exactly the segment from A (t=0) to B (t=1). No other cases arise since AB is straight. 2. Parameterizing ℱ: Each segment in ℱ has endpoints P=(p,0) on the x‐axis and Q=(0,q) on the y‐axis, both in the first quadrant, and satisfies |PQ|=1. The distance formula gives √(p²+q²)=1, so p²+q²=1. In the first quadrant p≥0, q≥0, the only solutions lie on the quarter‐circle of radius 1. We introduce θ∈[0,π/2] to cover all these points exactly once: set p=cosθ, q=sinθ.

Parameterize AB by t∈[0,1]: C(t)=(½(1−t), (√3/2)t). 2. Parameterize ℱ by θ∈[0,π/2]: P(θ)=(cosθ,0), Q(θ)=(0,sinθ). A point X lies on segment P(θ)Q(θ) iff there exists s∈[0,1] with X=(1−s)P(θ)+sQ(θ). 3. Plug X=C(t): (½(1−t), (√3/2)t) = ((1−s)cosθ, s\u2009sinθ). This gives two equations: (1−t)/2 = (1−s)cosθ and (√3/2)t = s\u2009sinθ. 4. We require 0≤t≤1, 0< s<1 (so C is interior to PQ, not at P or Q), and θ∈(0,π/2). 5. To avoid PQ coinciding with AB, we note AB has slope −√3; PQ has slope −tanθ, so we exclude tanθ=√3 (θ=π/3). 6.

Parameterize C on AB by t∈[0,1]:\n   C(t) = (x_C,y_C) = (½(1–t), (√3/2)t).\n2. C lies on the segment PQ if and only if C is a convex combination of P,Q: there exists u∈[0,1] with\n   C = (1–u)P + u\u2009Q.\n Equating coordinates gives\n   ½(1–t) = (1–u)cosθ,    (√3/2)t = u\u2009sinθ.\n3. Solve for u from the second: u = ( (√3/2)t )/(sinθ ) = (√3\u2009t)/(2\u2009sinθ ).  Substitute into the first: \n   ½(1–t) = cosθ – u\u2009cosθ = cosθ – (√3\u2009t\u2009cosθ)/(2\u2009sinθ).\n Multiply both sides by 2 and rearrange:\n   1–t + √3\u2009t\u2009cotθ = 2\u2009cosθ\n ⇒ t(√3\u2009cosθ – sinθ) = sinθ(2\u2009cosθ – 1).\n4.

Parameterize ℱ: A segment has P=(p,0), Q=(0,q) with p²+q²=1, p,q≥0; set p=cosθ, q=sinθ for θ∈[0,π/2]. 3. Collinearity and betweenness: C lies on PQ if there exists s∈[0,1] with C=(1−s)P+sQ.  Thus (1−s)cosθ=½(1−t),   s\u2009sinθ=(√3/2)t. 4. Eliminate s: from the second, s=(√3/2\u2009t)/sinθ.  Substitute into the first: [1−(√3/2\u2009t)/sinθ]cosθ=½(1−t).  Multiply by 2\u2009sinθ: 2\u2009sinθ\u2009cosθ−√3\u2009t\u2009cosθ=(1−t)sinθ.  Since 2\u2009sinθ\u2009cosθ=sin2θ, rearrange to t(√3\u2009cosθ−sinθ)=sin2θ−sinθ. 5.

A point X lies on segment P(θ)Q(θ) iff there exists s∈[0,1] with X=(1−s)P(θ)+sQ(θ). 3. Plug X=C(t): (½(1−t), (√3/2)t) = ((1−s)cosθ, s\u2009sinθ). This gives two equations: (1−t)/2 = (1−s)cosθ and (√3/2)t = s\u2009sinθ. 4. We require 0≤t≤1, 0< s<1 (so C is interior to PQ, not at P or Q), and θ∈(0,π/2). 5. To avoid PQ coinciding with AB, we note AB has slope −√3; PQ has slope −tanθ, so we exclude tanθ=√3 (θ=π/3). 6.

Parameterize ℱ: A segment has P=(p,0), Q=(0,q) with p²+q²=1, p,q≥0; set p=cosθ, q=sinθ for θ∈[0,π/2]. 3. Collinearity and betweenness: C lies on PQ if there exists s∈[0,1] with C=(1−s)P+sQ.  Thus (1−s)cosθ=½(1−t),   s\u2009sinθ=(√3/2)t. 4. Eliminate s: from the second, s=(√3/2\u2009t)/sinθ.  Substitute into the first: [1−(√3/2\u2009t)/sinθ]cosθ=½(1−t).

A necessary and sufficient condition for C(t) to lie on some PQ with P=(cosθ,0),Q=(0,sinθ),θ≠π/3, is that there exists s∈(0,1) satisfying\n  (1–t)/2=(1–s)cosθ,  (√3/2)t=s\u2009sinθ.\nEliminating s gives the single equation\n  t(√3\u2009cosθ–sinθ)=sin2θ–sinθ,\nwith θ∈(0,π/2)\\\x7f{π/3}.  Solving for t yields\n  t(θ)=[sin2θ–sinθ]/[√3\u2009cosθ–sinθ]\n=sinθ(2cosθ–1)/(√3\u2009cosθ–sinθ).\nAs θ→0+ this t→0, as θ→π/2– this t→1, and as θ→π/3± it approaches 3/4 from both sides.  Thus the range of t(θ) on θ≠π/3 is (0,3/4)∪(3/4,1).  The only t in [0,1] not attained is t=3/4.  This point C(3/4) lies only on the segment PQ with θ=π/3, namely AB.  Hence it is the unique C on AB not on any other segment in ℱ.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent wVOV:\nWe seek the unique t∈[0,1] for which no θ∈(0,π/2), θ≠π/3 solves\n  t(√3\u2009cosθ−sinθ)=sin2θ−sinθ.\nEquivalently define g(θ)=(sin2θ−sinθ)/(√3\u2009cosθ−sinθ).  A point C on AB with parameter t lies on some PQ≠AB iff t=g(θ) for some allowed θ.\nAs θ→0+, g→0; as θ→π/2−, g→1; at θ→π/3 the formula has 0/0 but by L’Hôpital\ng(π/3)=limθ→π/3 g(θ)=(2cos2θ−cosθ)/(−√3\u2009sinθ−cosθ)|θ=π/3 = (−3/2)/(−2)=3/4.\nThus g maps continuously onto [0,1] and takes the value 3/4 exactly at θ=π/3, which is excluded.  Hence the only t∈[0,1] for which no θ≠π/3 yields t=g(θ) is t=3/4.\nTherefore the unique point C=A+t(B−A) with t=3/4 is\n  C = (½(1−3/4), (√3/2)(3/4)) = (1/8, 3√3/8).\nNo other point on AB fails to lie on some PQ∈ℱ besides AB itself.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent Vu5G:\nWe seek the unique point C on AB (with A=(½,0), B=(0,√3/2)) that lies on no segment PQ∈ℱ except AB itself.  \n\n1. Parameterize AB by t∈[0,1]:\n   C(t) = A + t(B–A) = (½(1–t), (√3/2)t).\n\n2. A generic segment PQ∈ℱ has P=(cosθ,0), Q=(0,sinθ), θ∈[0,π/2].  C lies on PQ iff for some s∈[0,1]\n   (1–s)P + sQ = C(t).  Equating coordinates gives the single equation\n      t(√3\u2009cosθ – sinθ) = sin\u20092θ – sinθ\n   (with the exclusion θ=π/3 so that PQ≠AB).  \n\n3. For each fixed t, this is one equation in θ.  If it has a solution θ≠π/3 then C(t) lies on another PQ.  To find the t for which the only solution is the excluded θ=π/3, we find the value of t at which this equation becomes tangent to the θ–axis at θ=π/3.  Equivalently, we solve the system\n   F(t,θ)= t(√3\u2009cosθ–sinθ) – (sin2θ–sinθ)=0,\n   ∂F/∂θ = 0,\n   at θ=π/3.\n\n4. At θ=π/3 the numerator and denominator in the formula t = (sinθ(2\u2009cosθ–1))/(√3\u2009cosθ–sinθ) both vanish, so we apply l’Hôpital’s rule:  \n   Let N(θ)=sin2θ–sinθ, D(θ)=√3\u2009cosθ–sinθ.  Then at θ=π/3,\n     N′ = 2\u2009cos2θ – cosθ = 2(–1/2) – 1/2 = –3/2,  \n     D′ = –√3\u2009sinθ – cosθ = –√3(√3/2) – 1/2 = –2.  \n   Hence\n     t = lim_{θ→π/3} N/D = N′/D′ = (–3/2)/(–2) = 3/4.\n\n5.

Equivalently, the lines supporting PQ in ℱ form a one‐parameter family whose envelope inside triangle OAB touches AB at exactly one point C.  We carry out the envelope calculation:  \n\n1.  Equation of a generic PQ–line:  If P=(p,0), Q=(0,q) with p²+q²=1, then in the plane its line equation is  x/p + y/q =1.  Parametrize p=cosθ, q=sinθ, θ∈(0,π/2).  Thus  F(x,y,θ) := x\u2009secθ + y\u2009cscθ −1 =0.  \n\n2.  Envelope condition:  In addition, ∂F/∂θ=0 at the envelope.  Compute  ∂F/∂θ = −x\u2009secθ\u2009tanθ − y\u2009cscθ\u2009cotθ =0,  i.e.\n     x\u2009secθ\u2009tanθ = −y\u2009cscθ\u2009cotθ\n  ⇒ x\u2009sinθ/cos²θ = −y\u2009cosθ/sin²θ\n  ⇒ y = − x\u2009tan³θ.  \n\n3.  Substitute back into F=0.  Since y = −x\u2009tan³θ , we have\n     x\u2009secθ  − x\u2009tan³θ\u2009cscθ  = 1\n  Divide both terms by 1:\n     x (1/ cosθ − (sin³θ/ cos³θ)(1/ sinθ)) =1\n  Simplify the parenthesis:\n     1/ cosθ − sin²θ/ cos³θ = (cos²θ − sin²θ)/ cos³θ = cos2θ / cos³θ.\n  Hence\n     x = cos³θ / cos2θ,\n  and therefore  y = −x\u2009tan³θ = −(sin³θ / cos2θ).  \n\n4.  The envelope is the parametric curve\n     C(θ) = ( cos³θ / cos2θ ,  − sin³θ / cos2θ ),\n  with θ chosen so that C(θ) lies on the segment AB in the first quadrant (0≤x≤½, 0≤y≤√3/2).  \n\n5.  We now locate the unique θ₀ for which this envelope curve is tangent to AB.  AB has slope −√3 and endpoints A=(½,0), B=(0,√3/2).  The tangency condition is that the derivative dy/dx of the envelope at θ₀ equals −√3.

Parameterizing AB: A=(½,0), B=(0,√3/2). Any point C on the line through A and B can be written A + t(B–A), where t∈ℝ. Compute B–A=(–½,√3/2). Thus C(t)=(½ – ½t, 0 + (√3/2)t) = (½(1–t), (√3/2)t). Restricting t∈[0,1] yields exactly the segment from A (t=0) to B (t=1). No other cases arise since AB is straight. 2. Parameterizing ℱ: Each segment in ℱ has endpoints P=(p,0) on the x‐axis and Q=(0,q) on the y‐axis, both in the first quadrant, and satisfies |PQ|=1. The distance formula gives √(p²+q²)=1, so p²+q²=1. In the first quadrant p≥0, q≥0, the only solutions lie on the quarter‐circle of radius 1. We introduce θ∈[0,π/2] to cover all these points exactly once: set p=cosθ, q=sinθ. Thus for each θ, P(θ)=(cosθ,0) and Q(θ)=(0,sinθ). This exhausts all possible unit segments with P,Q in the first quadrant.

We parameterize the two families:\n   • Points on AB: A=(½,0), B=(0,√3/2).  Any C on AB is C(t)=((1−t)/2,\n     (√3/2)t), 0≤t≤1.\n   • Segments in ℱ: Endpoints P=(p,0), Q=(0,q) with p²+q²=1, p,q≥0.  Write p=cosθ,\n     q=sinθ for θ∈[0,π/2].  Thus P(θ)=(cosθ,0), Q(θ)=(0,sinθ).\n2.  C lies on PQ iff C is a convex combination: C=(1−s)P+sQ for some s∈[0,1].\n   Equating coordinates gives two equations:\n     (1−t)/2 = (1−s)cosθ,\n     (√3/2)t = s\u2009sinθ.\n3.  Solve the second for s: s = (√3/2\u2009t)/sinθ = (√3\u2009t)/(2\u2009sinθ).  Substitute into the\n   first:\n     (1−t)/2 = cosθ − s\u2009cosθ\n            = cosθ − (√3\u2009t\u2009cosθ)/(2\u2009sinθ).\n   Multiply both sides by 2\u2009sinθ and rearrange:\n     (1−t)sinθ = 2\u2009sinθ\u2009cosθ − √3\u2009t\u2009cosθ\n                = sin2θ − √3\u2009t\u2009cosθ.\n   Hence\n     t(√3\u2009cosθ − sinθ) = sin2θ − sinθ.\n4.  We must also ensure this PQ is not AB.  AB has slope −√3, while PQ has slope −tanθ;\n   they coincide only if tanθ=√3, i.e. θ=π/3.  Thus exclude θ=π/3 so the denominator\n   √3\u2009cosθ−sinθ≠0.\n5.  Finally, s=(√3\u2009t)/(2\u2009sinθ) must lie in (0,1) and t∈[0,1], θ∈(0,π/2).  These\n   guarantee C is strictly interior to PQ and P,Q lie in the first quadrant.\n\nThis produces a single scalar equation and clear constraints that are both necessary\nand sufficient for C(t) to lie on some PQ∈ℱ distinct from AB.\n\n### answer by Final Decision Agent 4QIl:\nA point C on AB with parameter t∈[0,1] lies on some segment PQ∈ℱ (distinct from AB) if and only if there exist θ∈(0,π/2), θ≠π/3 and s∈(0,1) satisfying\n  (1−t)/2 = (1−s)cosθ,\n  (√3/2)t = s\u2009sinθ.\nEquivalently,\n  t(√3\u2009cosθ − sinθ) = sin2θ − sinθ,\nwith θ≠π/3 (so √3\u2009cosθ−sinθ≠0) and s=(√3\u2009t)/(2\u2009sinθ)∈(0,1).\n\n### Sub-task 3: Identify the unique point C on AB not on any other segment in F. Given solutions to the problem from other agents, consider their opinions as additional advice. Please think carefully and provide an updated answer. \n\n ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent aFpe:\nWe seek the unique point C on AB (parameterized by C(t)=((1–t)/2,(√3/2)t),0≤t≤1) that lies on no unit segment PQ∈ℱ other than AB itself.  A necessary and sufficient condition for C(t) to lie on some PQ with P=(cosθ,0),Q=(0,sinθ),θ≠π/3, is that there exists s∈(0,1) satisfying\n  (1–t)/2=(1–s)cosθ,  (√3/2)t=s\u2009sinθ.\nEliminating s gives the single equation\n  t(√3\u2009cosθ–sinθ)=sin2θ–sinθ,\nwith θ∈(0,π/2)\\\x7f{π/3}.  Solving for t yields\n  t(θ)=[sin2θ–sinθ]/[√3\u2009cosθ–sinθ]\n=sinθ(2cosθ–1)/(√3\u2009cosθ–sinθ).\nAs θ→0+ this t→0, as θ→π/2– this t→1, and as θ→π/3± it approaches 3/4 from both sides.  Thus the range of t(θ) on θ≠π/3 is (0,3/4)∪(3/4,1).  The only t in [0,1] not attained is t=3/4.  This point C(3/4) lies only on the segment PQ with θ=π/3, namely AB.  Hence it is the unique C on AB not on any other segment in ℱ.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent wVOV:\nWe seek the unique t∈[0,1] for which no θ∈(0,π/2), θ≠π/3 solves\n  t(√3\u2009cosθ−sinθ)=sin2θ−sinθ.\nEquivalently define g(θ)=(sin2θ−sinθ)/(√3\u2009cosθ−sinθ).  A point C on AB with parameter t lies on some PQ≠AB iff t=g(θ) for some allowed θ.\nAs θ→0+, g→0; as θ→π/2−, g→1; at θ→π/3 the formula has 0/0 but by L’Hôpital\ng(π/3)=limθ→π/3 g(θ)=(2cos2θ−cosθ)/(−√3\u2009sinθ−cosθ)|θ=π/3 = (−3/2)/(−2)=3/4.\nThus g maps continuously onto [0,1] and takes the value 3/4 exactly at θ=π/3, which is excluded.  Hence the only t∈[0,1] for which no θ≠π/3 yields t=g(θ) is t=3/4.\nTherefore the unique point C=A+t(B−A) with t=3/4 is\n  C = (½(1−3/4), (√3/2)(3/4)) = (1/8, 3√3/8).\nNo other point on AB fails to lie on some PQ∈ℱ besides AB itself.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent Vu5G:\nWe seek the unique point C on AB (with A=(½,0), B=(0,√3/2)) that lies on no segment PQ∈ℱ except AB itself.  \n\n1. Parameterize AB by t∈[0,1]:\n   C(t) = A + t(B–A) = (½(1–t), (√3/2)t).\n\n2. A generic segment PQ∈ℱ has P=(cosθ,0), Q=(0,sinθ), θ∈[0,π/2].  C lies on PQ iff for some s∈[0,1]\n   (1–s)P + sQ = C(t).  Equating coordinates gives the single equation\n      t(√3\u2009cosθ – sinθ) = sin\u20092θ – sinθ\n   (with the exclusion θ=π/3 so that PQ≠AB).  \n\n3. For each fixed t, this is one equation in θ.  If it has a solution θ≠π/3 then C(t) lies on another PQ.  To find the t for which the only solution is the excluded θ=π/3, we find the value of t at which this equation becomes tangent to the θ–axis at θ=π/3.  Equivalently, we solve the system\n   F(t,θ)= t(√3\u2009cosθ–sinθ) – (sin2θ–sinθ)=0,\n   ∂F/∂θ = 0,\n   at θ=π/3.\n\n4. At θ=π/3 the numerator and denominator in the formula t = (sinθ(2\u2009cosθ–1))/(√3\u2009cosθ–sinθ) both vanish, so we apply l’Hôpital’s rule:  \n   Let N(θ)=sin2θ–sinθ, D(θ)=√3\u2009cosθ–sinθ.  Then at θ=π/3,\n     N′ = 2\u2009cos2θ – cosθ = 2(–1/2) – 1/2 = –3/2,  \n     D′ = –√3\u2009sinθ – cosθ = –√3(√3/2) – 1/2 = –2.  \n   Hence\n     t = lim_{θ→π/3} N/D = N′/D′ = (–3/2)/(–2) = 3/4.\n\n5. Therefore the unique t is 3/4, giving\n   C = C(3/4) = (½·(1–3/4), (√3/2)·3/4) = (1/8, 3√3/8).\n\nConclusion: C=(1/8,3√3/8) is the only point on AB (apart from A and B) not lying on any other segment in ℱ.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent NDVI:\nWe seek the unique point C on AB that is not covered by any other segment PQ in the family ℱ.  Equivalently, the lines supporting PQ in ℱ form a one‐parameter family whose envelope inside triangle OAB touches AB at exactly one point C.  We carry out the envelope calculation:  \n\n1.  Equation of a generic PQ–line:  If P=(p,0), Q=(0,q) with p²+q²=1, then in the plane its line equation is  x/p + y/q =1.  Parametrize p=cosθ, q=sinθ, θ∈(0,π/2).  Thus  F(x,y,θ) := x\u2009secθ + y\u2009cscθ −1 =0.  \n\n2.  Envelope condition:  In addition, ∂F/∂θ=0 at the envelope.  Compute  ∂F/∂θ = −x\u2009secθ\u2009tanθ − y\u2009cscθ\u2009cotθ =0,  i.e.\n     x\u2009secθ\u2009tanθ = −y\u2009cscθ\u2009cotθ\n  ⇒ x\u2009sinθ/cos²θ = −y\u2009cosθ/sin²θ\n  ⇒ y = − x\u2009tan³θ.  \n\n3.  Substitute back into F=0.  Since y = −x\u2009tan³θ , we have\n     x\u2009secθ  − x\u2009tan³θ\u2009cscθ  = 1\n  Divide both terms by 1:\n     x (1/ cosθ − (sin³θ/ cos³θ)(1/ sinθ)) =1\n  Simplify the parenthesis:\n     1/ cosθ − sin²θ/ cos³θ = (cos²θ − sin²θ)/ cos³θ = cos2θ / cos³θ.\n  Hence\n     x = cos³θ / cos2θ,\n  and therefore  y = −x\u2009tan³θ = −(sin³θ / cos2θ).  \n\n4.  The envelope is the parametric curve\n     C(θ) = ( cos³θ / cos2θ ,  − sin³θ / cos2θ ),\n  with θ chosen so that C(θ) lies on the segment AB in the first quadrant (0≤x≤½, 0≤y≤√3/2).  \n\n5.  We now locate the unique θ₀ for which this envelope curve is tangent to AB.  AB has slope −√3 and endpoints A=(½,0), B=(0,√3/2).  The tangency condition is that the derivative dy/dx of the envelope at θ₀ equals −√3.  Computing:\n     dx/dθ = (3 cos²θ (−sinθ)·cos2θ − cos³θ·(−2 sin2θ)) / cos²2θ,\n     dy/dθ = (−3 sin²θ cosθ·cos2θ − (−sin³θ)·(−2 sin2θ)) / cos²2θ.\n  Then dy/dx = (dy/dθ)/(dx/dθ).  One solves dy/dx = −√3 numerically or symbolically, and one finds the unique solution θ₀ = arctan(1/√3) = π/6.  \n\n6.  Substituting θ₀ = π/6 back into x = cos³θ/ cos2θ gives\n     cosθ₀ = √3/2,  cos2θ₀ = 1/2\n     ⇒ x_C = (√3/2)³ ÷ (1/2) = (3√3/8)·2 = 3√3/4  ,\n  which lies outside [0,½], so we reject π/6.  Instead, the correct tangency occurs at θ₀ = π/3.  Substituting θ₀=π/3:  cosθ=1/2, sinθ=√3/2, cos2θ=−1/2 gives x_C = (1/2)³/(−1/2)=−1/4 (outside) so that is also invalid directly;  instead one must intersect the envelope with AB explicitly.  \n\n7.  It is more transparent to switch to the AB–parameter t, where\n     C(t) = ( x(t), y(t) ) = ( ½(1−t) , (√3/2) t ),   0≤t≤1.  \n  A point C(t) lies on the line PQ of parameter θ≠π/3 if and only if\n     t(√3 cosθ − sinθ) = sin2θ − sinθ,\n  and moreover the division parameter s = (√3\u2009t)/(2\u2009sinθ) must satisfy 0<s<1.

Parameterizing AB: A=(½,0), B=(0,√3/2). Any point C on the line through A and B can be written A + t(B–A), where t∈ℝ. Compute B–A=(–½,√3/2). Thus C(t)=(½ – ½t, 0 + (√3/2)t) = (½(1–t), (√3/2)t). Restricting t∈[0,1] yields exactly the segment from A (t=0) to B (t=1). No other cases arise since AB is straight. 2. Parameterizing ℱ: Each segment in ℱ has endpoints P=(p,0) on the x‐axis and Q=(0,q) on the y‐axis, both in the first quadrant, and satisfies |PQ|=1. The distance formula gives √(p²+q²)=1, so p²+q²=1. In the first quadrant p≥0, q≥0, the only solutions lie on the quarter‐circle of radius 1. We introduce θ∈[0,π/2] to cover all these points exactly once: set p=cosθ, q=sinθ.

Parameterize AB by t∈[0,1]: C(t)=(½(1−t), (√3/2)t). 2. Parameterize ℱ by θ∈[0,π/2]: P(θ)=(cosθ,0), Q(θ)=(0,sinθ). A point X lies on segment P(θ)Q(θ) iff there exists s∈[0,1] with X=(1−s)P(θ)+sQ(θ). 3. Plug X=C(t): (½(1−t), (√3/2)t) = ((1−s)cosθ, s\u2009sinθ). This gives two equations: (1−t)/2 = (1−s)cosθ and (√3/2)t = s\u2009sinθ. 4. We require 0≤t≤1, 0< s<1 (so C is interior to PQ, not at P or Q), and θ∈(0,π/2). 5. To avoid PQ coinciding with AB, we note AB has slope −√3; PQ has slope −tanθ, so we exclude tanθ=√3 (θ=π/3). 6.

C lies on the segment PQ if and only if C is a convex combination of P,Q: there exists u∈[0,1] with\n   C = (1–u)P + u\u2009Q.\n Equating coordinates gives\n   ½(1–t) = (1–u)cosθ,    (√3/2)t = u\u2009sinθ.\n3. Solve for u from the second: u = ( (√3/2)t )/(sinθ ) = (√3\u2009t)/(2\u2009sinθ ).  Substitute into the first: \n   ½(1–t) = cosθ – u\u2009cosθ = cosθ – (√3\u2009t\u2009cosθ)/(2\u2009sinθ).\n Multiply both sides by 2 and rearrange:\n   1–t + √3\u2009t\u2009cotθ = 2\u2009cosθ\n ⇒ t(√3\u2009cosθ – sinθ) = sinθ(2\u2009cosθ – 1).\n4.

Parameterize ℱ: A segment has P=(p,0), Q=(0,q) with p²+q²=1, p,q≥0; set p=cosθ, q=sinθ for θ∈[0,π/2]. 3. Collinearity and betweenness: C lies on PQ if there exists s∈[0,1] with C=(1−s)P+sQ.  Thus (1−s)cosθ=½(1−t),   s\u2009sinθ=(√3/2)t. 4. Eliminate s: from the second, s=(√3/2\u2009t)/sinθ.  Substitute into the first: [1−(√3/2\u2009t)/sinθ]cosθ=½(1−t).  Multiply by 2\u2009sinθ: 2\u2009sinθ\u2009cosθ−√3\u2009t\u2009cosθ=(1−t)sinθ.  Since 2\u2009sinθ\u2009cosθ=sin2θ, rearrange to t(√3\u2009cosθ−sinθ)=sin2θ−sinθ. 5.

This gives two equations: (1−t)/2 = (1−s)cosθ and (√3/2)t = s\u2009sinθ. 4. We require 0≤t≤1, 0< s<1 (so C is interior to PQ, not at P or Q), and θ∈(0,π/2). 5. To avoid PQ coinciding with AB, we note AB has slope −√3; PQ has slope −tanθ, so we exclude tanθ=√3 (θ=π/3). 6.

Parameterize ℱ: A segment has P=(p,0), Q=(0,q) with p²+q²=1, p,q≥0; set p=cosθ, q=sinθ for θ∈[0,π/2]. 3. Collinearity and betweenness: C lies on PQ if there exists s∈[0,1] with C=(1−s)P+sQ.  Thus (1−s)cosθ=½(1−t),   s\u2009sinθ=(√3/2)t. 4. Eliminate s: from the second, s=(√3/2\u2009t)/sinθ.  Substitute into the first: [1−(√3/2\u2009t)/sinθ]cosθ=½(1−t).  Multiply by 2\u2009sinθ: 2\u2009sinθ\u2009cosθ−√3\u2009t\u2009cosθ=(1−t)sinθ.  Since 2\u2009sinθ\u2009cosθ=sin2θ, rearrange to t(√3\u2009cosθ−sinθ)=sin2θ−sinθ. 5.

Equivalently, we solve the system\n   F(t,θ)= t(√3\u2009cosθ–sinθ) – (sin2θ–sinθ)=0,\n   ∂F/∂θ = 0,\n   at θ=π/3.\n\n4. At θ=π/3 the numerator and denominator in the formula t = (sinθ(2\u2009cosθ–1))/(√3\u2009cosθ–sinθ) both vanish, so we apply l’Hôpital’s rule:  \n   Let N(θ)=sin2θ–sinθ, D(θ)=√3\u2009cosθ–sinθ.  Then at θ=π/3,\n     N′ = 2\u2009cos2θ – cosθ = 2(–1/2) – 1/2 = –3/2,  \n     D′ = –√3\u2009sinθ – cosθ = –√3(√3/2) – 1/2 = –2.  \n   Hence\n     t = lim_{θ→π/3} N/D = N′/D′ = (–3/2)/(–2) = 3/4.\n\n5. Therefore the unique t is 3/4, giving\n   C = C(3/4) = (½·(1–3/4), (√3/2)·3/4) = (1/8, 3√3/8).\n\nConclusion: C=(1/8,3√3/8) is the only point on AB (apart from A and B) not lying on any other segment in ℱ.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent NDVI:\nWe seek the unique point C on AB that is not covered by any other segment PQ in the family ℱ.  Equivalently, the lines supporting PQ in ℱ form a one‐parameter family whose envelope inside triangle OAB touches AB at exactly one point C.  We carry out the envelope calculation:  \n\n1.  Equation of a generic PQ–line:  If P=(p,0), Q=(0,q) with p²+q²=1, then in the plane its line equation is  x/p + y/q =1.  Parametrize p=cosθ, q=sinθ, θ∈(0,π/2).  Thus  F(x,y,θ) := x\u2009secθ + y\u2009cscθ −1 =0.  \n\n2.  Envelope condition:  In addition, ∂F/∂θ=0 at the envelope.  Compute  ∂F/∂θ = −x\u2009secθ\u2009tanθ − y\u2009cscθ\u2009cotθ =0,  i.e.\n     x\u2009secθ\u2009tanθ = −y\u2009cscθ\u2009cotθ\n  ⇒ x\u2009sinθ/cos²θ = −y\u2009cosθ/sin²θ\n  ⇒ y = − x\u2009tan³θ.  \n\n3.  Substitute back into F=0.  Since y = −x\u2009tan³θ , we have\n     x\u2009secθ  − x\u2009tan³θ\u2009cscθ  = 1\n  Divide both terms by 1:\n     x (1/ cosθ − (sin³θ/ cos³θ)(1/ sinθ)) =1\n  Simplify the parenthesis:\n     1/ cosθ − sin²θ/ cos³θ = (cos²θ − sin²θ)/ cos³θ = cos2θ / cos³θ.\n  Hence\n     x = cos³θ / cos2θ,\n  and therefore  y = −x\u2009tan³θ = −(sin³θ / cos2θ).  \n\n4.  The envelope is the parametric curve\n     C(θ) = ( cos³θ / cos2θ ,  − sin³θ / cos2θ ),\n  with θ chosen so that C(θ) lies on the segment AB in the first quadrant (0≤x≤½, 0≤y≤√3/2).  \n\n5.  We now locate the unique θ₀ for which this envelope curve is tangent to AB.  AB has slope −√3 and endpoints A=(½,0), B=(0,√3/2).  The tangency condition is that the derivative dy/dx of the envelope at θ₀ equals −√3.  Computing:\n     dx/dθ = (3 cos²θ (−sinθ)·cos2θ − cos³θ·(−2 sin2θ)) / cos²2θ,\n     dy/dθ = (−3 sin²θ cosθ·cos2θ − (−sin³θ)·(−2 sin2θ)) / cos²2θ.\n  Then dy/dx = (dy/dθ)/(dx/dθ).  One solves dy/dx = −√3 numerically or symbolically, and one finds the unique solution θ₀ = arctan(1/√3) = π/6.  \n\n6.  Substituting θ₀ = π/6 back into x = cos³θ/ cos2θ gives\n     cosθ₀ = √3/2,  cos2θ₀ = 1/2\n     ⇒ x_C = (√3/2)³ ÷ (1/2) = (3√3/8)·2 = 3√3/4  ,\n  which lies outside [0,½], so we reject π/6.  Instead, the correct tangency occurs at θ₀ = π/3.  Substituting θ₀=π/3:  cosθ=1/2, sinθ=√3/2, cos2θ=−1/2 gives x_C = (1/2)³/(−1/2)=−1/4 (outside) so that is also invalid directly;  instead one must intersect the envelope with AB explicitly.  \n\n7.  It is more transparent to switch to the AB–parameter t, where\n     C(t) = ( x(t), y(t) ) = ( ½(1−t) , (√3/2) t ),   0≤t≤1.  \n  A point C(t) lies on the line PQ of parameter θ≠π/3 if and only if\n     t(√3 cosθ − sinθ) = sin2θ − sinθ,\n  and moreover the division parameter s = (√3\u2009t)/(2\u2009sinθ) must satisfy 0<s<1.

Parameterizing AB: A=(½,0), B=(0,√3/2). Any point C on the line through A and B can be written A + t(B–A), where t∈ℝ. Compute B–A=(–½,√3/2). Thus C(t)=(½ – ½t, 0 + (√3/2)t) = (½(1–t), (√3/2)t). Restricting t∈[0,1] yields exactly the segment from A (t=0) to B (t=1). No other cases arise since AB is straight. 2. Parameterizing ℱ: Each segment in ℱ has endpoints P=(p,0) on the x‐axis and Q=(0,q) on the y‐axis, both in the first quadrant, and satisfies |PQ|=1. The distance formula gives √(p²+q²)=1, so p²+q²=1. In the first quadrant p≥0, q≥0, the only solutions lie on the quarter‐circle of radius 1. We introduce θ∈[0,π/2] to cover all these points exactly once: set p=cosθ, q=sinθ. Thus for each θ, P(θ)=(cosθ,0) and Q(θ)=(0,sinθ). This exhausts all possible unit segments with P,Q in the first quadrant. No additional parameters or cases are needed.\n\n### answer by Final Decision Agent 2Kp1:\nParameterization of AB: For t∈[0,1], C(t) = (x(t),y(t)) = (½(1–t), (√3/2)t).  \nParameterization of the family ℱ of unit segments PQ: For θ∈[0,π/2], P(θ) = (cosθ, 0), Q(θ) = (0, sinθ).\n\n### Sub-task 2: Synthesize and choose the consistent membership condition. \n\n ### thinking by Final Decision Agent 4QIl:\n1. We parameterize the two families:\n   • Points on AB: A=(½,0), B=(0,√3/2).  Any C on AB is C(t)=((1−t)/2,\n     (√3/2)t), 0≤t≤1.\n   • Segments in ℱ: Endpoints P=(p,0), Q=(0,q) with p²+q²=1, p,q≥0.  Write p=cosθ,\n     q=sinθ for θ∈[0,π/2].  Thus P(θ)=(cosθ,0), Q(θ)=(0,sinθ).\n2.  C lies on PQ iff C is a convex combination: C=(1−s)P+sQ for some s∈[0,1].\n   Equating coordinates gives two equations:\n     (1−t)/2 = (1−s)cosθ,\n     (√3/2)t = s\u2009sinθ.\n3.  Solve the second for s: s = (√3/2\u2009t)/sinθ = (√3\u2009t)/(2\u2009sinθ).  Substitute into the\n   first:\n     (1−t)/2 = cosθ − s\u2009cosθ\n            = cosθ − (√3\u2009t\u2009cosθ)/(2\u2009sinθ).\n   Multiply both sides by 2\u2009sinθ and rearrange:\n     (1−t)sinθ = 2\u2009sinθ\u2009cosθ − √3\u2009t\u2009cosθ\n                = sin2θ − √3\u2009t\u2009cosθ.\n   Hence\n     t(√3\u2009cosθ − sinθ) = sin2θ − sinθ.\n4.  We must also ensure this PQ is not AB.  AB has slope −√3, while PQ has slope −tanθ;\n   they coincide only if tanθ=√3, i.e. θ=π/3.  Thus exclude θ=π/3 so the denominator\n   √3\u2009cosθ−sinθ≠0.\n5.  Finally, s=(√3\u2009t)/(2\u2009sinθ) must lie in (0,1) and t∈[0,1], θ∈(0,π/2).

A necessary and sufficient condition for C(t) to lie on some PQ with P=(cosθ,0),Q=(0,sinθ),θ≠π/3, is that there exists s∈(0,1) satisfying\n  (1–t)/2=(1–s)cosθ,  (√3/2)t=s\u2009sinθ.\nEliminating s gives the single equation\n  t(√3\u2009cosθ–sinθ)=sin2θ–sinθ,\nwith θ∈(0,π/2)\\\x7f{π/3}.  Solving for t yields\n  t(θ)=[sin2θ–sinθ]/[√3\u2009cosθ–sinθ]\n=sinθ(2cosθ–1)/(√3\u2009cosθ–sinθ).\nAs θ→0+ this t→0, as θ→π/2– this t→1, and as θ→π/3± it approaches 3/4 from both sides.  Thus the range of t(θ) on θ≠π/3 is (0,3/4)∪(3/4,1).  The only t in [0,1] not attained is t=3/4.  This point C(3/4) lies only on the segment PQ with θ=π/3, namely AB.  Hence it is the unique C on AB not on any other segment in ℱ.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent wVOV:\nWe seek the unique t∈[0,1] for which no θ∈(0,π/2), θ≠π/3 solves\n  t(√3\u2009cosθ−sinθ)=sin2θ−sinθ.\nEquivalently define g(θ)=(sin2θ−sinθ)/(√3\u2009cosθ−sinθ).  A point C on AB with parameter t lies on some PQ≠AB iff t=g(θ) for some allowed θ.\nAs θ→0+, g→0; as θ→π/2−, g→1; at θ→π/3 the formula has 0/0 but by L’Hôpital\ng(π/3)=limθ→π/3 g(θ)=(2cos2θ−cosθ)/(−√3\u2009sinθ−cosθ)|θ=π/3 = (−3/2)/(−2)=3/4.\nThus g maps continuously onto [0,1] and takes the value 3/4 exactly at θ=π/3, which is excluded.  Hence the only t∈[0,1] for which no θ≠π/3 yields t=g(θ) is t=3/4.\nTherefore the unique point C=A+t(B−A) with t=3/4 is\n  C = (½(1−3/4), (√3/2)(3/4)) = (1/8, 3√3/8).\nNo other point on AB fails to lie on some PQ∈ℱ besides AB itself.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent Vu5G:\nWe seek the unique point C on AB (with A=(½,0), B=(0,√3/2)) that lies on no segment PQ∈ℱ except AB itself.  \n\n1. Parameterize AB by t∈[0,1]:\n   C(t) = A + t(B–A) = (½(1–t), (√3/2)t).\n\n2. A generic segment PQ∈ℱ has P=(cosθ,0), Q=(0,sinθ), θ∈[0,π/2].  C lies on PQ iff for some s∈[0,1]\n   (1–s)P + sQ = C(t).  Equating coordinates gives the single equation\n      t(√3\u2009cosθ – sinθ) = sin\u20092θ – sinθ\n   (with the exclusion θ=π/3 so that PQ≠AB).  \n\n3. For each fixed t, this is one equation in θ.  If it has a solution θ≠π/3 then C(t) lies on another PQ.  To find the t for which the only solution is the excluded θ=π/3, we find the value of t at which this equation becomes tangent to the θ–axis at θ=π/3.  Equivalently, we solve the system\n   F(t,θ)= t(√3\u2009cosθ–sinθ) – (sin2θ–sinθ)=0,\n   ∂F/∂θ = 0,\n   at θ=π/3.\n\n4. At θ=π/3 the numerator and denominator in the formula t = (sinθ(2\u2009cosθ–1))/(√3\u2009cosθ–sinθ) both vanish, so we apply l’Hôpital’s rule:  \n   Let N(θ)=sin2θ–sinθ, D(θ)=√3\u2009cosθ–sinθ.  Then at θ=π/3,\n     N′ = 2\u2009cos2θ – cosθ = 2(–1/2) – 1/2 = –3/2,  \n     D′ = –√3\u2009sinθ – cosθ = –√3(√3/2) – 1/2 = –2.  \n   Hence\n     t = lim_{θ→π/3} N/D = N′/D′ = (–3/2)/(–2) = 3/4.\n\n5.

Parameterizing AB: A=(½,0), B=(0,√3/2). Any point C on the line through A and B can be written A + t(B–A), where t∈ℝ. Compute B–A=(–½,√3/2). Thus C(t)=(½ – ½t, 0 + (√3/2)t) = (½(1–t), (√3/2)t). Restricting t∈[0,1] yields exactly the segment from A (t=0) to B (t=1). No other cases arise since AB is straight. 2. Parameterizing ℱ: Each segment in ℱ has endpoints P=(p,0) on the x‐axis and Q=(0,q) on the y‐axis, both in the first quadrant, and satisfies |PQ|=1. The distance formula gives √(p²+q²)=1, so p²+q²=1. In the first quadrant p≥0, q≥0, the only solutions lie on the quarter‐circle of radius 1. We introduce θ∈[0,π/2] to cover all these points exactly once: set p=cosθ, q=sinθ. Thus for each θ, P(θ)=(cosθ,0) and Q(θ)=(0,sinθ). This exhausts all possible unit segments with P,Q in the first quadrant. No additional parameters or cases are needed.\n\n### answer by Final Decision Agent 2Kp1:\nParameterization of AB: For t∈[0,1], C(t) = (x(t),y(t)) = (½(1–t), (√3/2)t).  \nParameterization of the family ℱ of unit segments PQ: For θ∈[0,π/2], P(θ) = (cosθ, 0), Q(θ) = (0, sinθ).\n\n### Sub-task 2: Synthesize and choose the consistent membership condition. \n\n ### thinking by Final Decision Agent 4QIl:\n1. We parameterize the two families:\n   • Points on AB: A=(½,0), B=(0,√3/2).  Any C on AB is C(t)=((1−t)/2,\n     (√3/2)t), 0≤t≤1.\n   • Segments in ℱ: Endpoints P=(p,0), Q=(0,q) with p²+q²=1, p,q≥0.  Write p=cosθ,\n     q=sinθ for θ∈[0,π/2].  Thus P(θ)=(cosθ,0), Q(θ)=(0,sinθ).\n2.  C lies on PQ iff C is a convex combination: C=(1−s)P+sQ for some s∈[0,1].\n   Equating coordinates gives two equations:\n     (1−t)/2 = (1−s)cosθ,\n     (√3/2)t = s\u2009sinθ.\n3.  Solve the second for s: s = (√3/2\u2009t)/sinθ = (√3\u2009t)/(2\u2009sinθ).  Substitute into the\n   first:\n     (1−t)/2 = cosθ − s\u2009cosθ\n            = cosθ − (√3\u2009t\u2009cosθ)/(2\u2009sinθ).\n   Multiply both sides by 2\u2009sinθ and rearrange:\n     (1−t)sinθ = 2\u2009sinθ\u2009cosθ − √3\u2009t\u2009cosθ\n                = sin2θ − √3\u2009t\u2009cosθ.\n   Hence\n     t(√3\u2009cosθ − sinθ) = sin2θ − sinθ.\n4.  We must also ensure this PQ is not AB.  AB has slope −√3, while PQ has slope −tanθ;\n   they coincide only if tanθ=√3, i.e. θ=π/3.  Thus exclude θ=π/3 so the denominator\n   √3\u2009cosθ−sinθ≠0.\n5.  Finally, s=(√3\u2009t)/(2\u2009sinθ) must lie in (0,1) and t∈[0,1], θ∈(0,π/2).  These\n   guarantee C is strictly interior to PQ and P,Q lie in the first quadrant.\n\nThis produces a single scalar equation and clear constraints that are both necessary\nand sufficient for C(t) to lie on some PQ∈ℱ distinct from AB.\n\n### answer by Final Decision Agent 4QIl:\nA point C on AB with parameter t∈[0,1] lies on some segment PQ∈ℱ (distinct from AB) if and only if there exist θ∈(0,π/2), θ≠π/3 and s∈(0,1) satisfying\n  (1−t)/2 = (1−s)cosθ,\n  (√3/2)t = s\u2009sinθ.\nEquivalently,\n  t(√3\u2009cosθ − sinθ) = sin2θ − sinθ,\nwith θ≠π/3 (so √3\u2009cosθ−sinθ≠0) and s=(√3\u2009t)/(2\u2009sinθ)∈(0,1).\n\n### Sub-task 3: Given all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer. \n\n ### thinking by Final Decision Agent eFsN:\n1. Parameterize AB: A=(½,0), B=(0,√3/2). Any point C on AB can be written C(t)=A+t(B−A) = ((1−t)/2, (√3/2)t), with t∈[0,1].\n\n2. Parameterize ℱ: Each unit‐length segment PQ with P on the x‐axis and Q on the y‐axis in the first quadrant has endpoints P=(cosθ,0), Q=(0,sinθ), θ∈[0,π/2].\n\n3. Membership condition: C(t) lies on PQ if there exists s∈[0,1] such that (1−s)P + sQ = C(t). Equating coordinates gives\n   (1−t)/2 = (1−s)cosθ,\n   (√3/2)t   = s\u2009sinθ.\n Solve the second for s: s = (√3\u2009t)/(2\u2009sinθ). Substitute into the first and simplify to obtain\n   t(√3\u2009cosθ − sinθ) = sin2θ − sinθ.\n Denote g(θ) = (sin2θ − sinθ)/(√3\u2009cosθ − sinθ). Then C(t) lies on some PQ≠AB exactly when t = g(θ) for some θ≠π/3.\n\n4. Behavior of g(θ): As θ→0+, g→0; as θ→π/2−, g→1. At θ→π/3 the expression is 0/0, but by l’Hôpital’s rule\n   lim_{θ→π/3} g(θ) = (2\u2009cos2θ − cosθ)/(−√3\u2009sinθ − cosθ) |_{θ=π/3} = (−3/2)/(−2) = 3/4.\n Thus g maps (0,π/2) continuously onto [0,1], taking the value 3/4 only at θ=π/3, which is excluded to avoid PQ=AB.\n\n5. Conclusion: Every t∈[0,1] except t=3/4 arises as g(θ) for some θ≠π/3, so C(t) lies on another segment in ℱ. The only t for which no such θ exists is t=3/4. Hence the unique point C on AB not lying on any other PQ∈ℱ is C(3/4).\n\n6.
