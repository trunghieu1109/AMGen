============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
   • Variables: x, y, z are positive real numbers.
   • Equations (base-2 logarithms):
     – log₂(x/(y z)) = 1/2
     – log₂(y/(x z)) = 1/3
     – log₂(z/(x y)) = 1/4
   • Target expression (not to solve here): |log₂(x⁴ y³ z²)| expressed as a reduced fraction m/n.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
   • Each equation ties one variable’s ratio to the product of the other two via a specified logarithmic value.
   • Converting each to exponential form yields:
     – x/(y z) = 2^{1/2}
     – y/(x z) = 2^{1/3}
     – z/(x y) = 2^{1/4}
   • Multiplying or combining these relations can eliminate cyclic dependencies.
   • The constraints of positivity ensure all logarithms and exponentials are well-defined.
   • These cyclic symmetries suggest a consistent scaling of x, y, z by powers of 2.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
   • Primary domain: Algebra (logarithmic and exponential equations).
   • Subfields: Real analysis (properties of logs), system of equations, exponent rules.
   • Common contexts: Mathematical contests, logarithm manipulation exercises in precalculus or algebra courses.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
   • No ambiguity in variable domains—x, y, z > 0.
   • All equations are explicit; no hidden conditions.
   • Potential challenge: tracking exponents when combining three cyclic equations and ensuring reduction to simplest fraction form.

By definition of logarithms, log₂(A) = C is equivalent to A = 2^C. Applying this to each: 1. A = x/(yz), C = 1/2, so x/(yz) = 2^(1/2). 2. A = y/(xz), C = 1/3, so y/(xz) = 2^(1/3). 3. A = z/(xy), C = 1/4, so z/(xy) = 2^(1/4). All variables are positive, so the exponential forms are valid with no extraneous cases.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent Werb:\nFirst, recall the definition of a logarithm: for any positive base b≠1 and positive argument A, log_b(A)=C if and only if A=b^C. Here our base is 2, which satisfies 2>0 and 2≠1. Next, note that x, y, z are given as positive real numbers, so each argument x/(yz), y/(xz), and z/(xy) is also positive—this guarantees the logarithms are well-defined and we may apply the exponential conversion without introducing extraneous solutions. Therefore, we convert each of the three equations one by one:\n\n1. From log_2(x/(yz))=1/2, we get x/(yz)=2^(1/2).\n2. From log_2(y/(xz))=1/3, we get y/(xz)=2^(1/3).\n3.

Solve for a: from a–b–c=1/2 and b+c=(a+b+c)–a = –13/12–a, we get\n    a – (–13/12–a) = 1/2 ⇒ 2a +13/12 = 1/2 ⇒ 2a = –7/12 ⇒ a = –7/24.\n\n6.  Solve for b: from b–a–c=1/3 and a+c=(a+b+c)–b = –13/12–b, we get\n    b – (–13/12–b) = 1/3 ⇒ 2b +13/12 = 1/3 ⇒ 2b = –3/4 ⇒ b = –3/8.\n\n7.  Solve for c: from c–a–b=1/4 and a+b=(a+b+c)–c = –13/12–c, we get\n    c – (–13/12–c) = 1/4 ⇒ 2c +13/12 = 1/4 ⇒ 2c = –5/6 ⇒ c = –5/12.\n\n8.

To solve for x,y,z as powers of 2, proceed step by step:\n\nStep 1: Multiply all three equations.  \nLeft side: [x/(yz)]·[y/(xz)]·[z/(xy)]\n = (x·y·z)/(yz·xz·xy)\n = (xyz)/(x^2 y^2 z^2)\n = 1/(x y z).\nRight side: 2^{1/2+1/3+1/4} = 2^{(6+4+3)/12} = 2^{13/12}.\nThus 1/(xyz)=2^{13/12}, so  xyz=2^{-13/12}.\n\nStep 2: Solve for x.  From x/(yz)=2^{1/2}, we have x=2^{1/2}·y·z.  But y·z = (xyz)/x =2^{-13/12}/x.  \nHence x^2 =2^{1/2}·2^{-13/12}=2^{6/12 - 13/12}=2^{-7/12},\nso x=2^{-7/24} (positive root).\n\nStep 3: Solve for y.  From y/(xz)=2^{1/3}, so y=2^{1/3}·x·z.  But x·z= (xyz)/y=2^{-13/12}/y.  \nThus y^2=2^{1/3}·2^{-13/12}=2^{4/12-13/12}=2^{-9/12}=2^{-3/4},\nso y=2^{-3/8}.\n\nStep 4: Solve for z.  From z/(xy)=2^{1/4}, so z=2^{1/4}·x·y.  But x·y=(xyz)/z=2^{-13/12}/z.  \nThus z^2=2^{1/4}·2^{-13/12}=2^{3/12 -13/12}=2^{-10/12}=2^{-5/6},\nso z=2^{-5/12}.\n\nNo other cases arise because x,y,z>0.

Although the values of a, b, and c (exponents of x, y, z) were correctly found in Sub-task 3, the summation 4a + 3b + 2c was computed as negative (-25/8), and the absolute value was taken as 25/8.

The key mistake is that the linear system solution yields negative exponents a, b, c, but the sum 4a + 3b + 2c should be carefully re-examined in the context of the original equations. The negative sum indicates that the expression inside the logarithm is less than 1, so the absolute value is positive, but the fraction 25/8 is not in lowest terms relative to the problem's expected answer. Moreover, the final step did not compute m+n but returned only the fraction 25/8, which is incomplete per the problem statement. The reasoning also failed to verify if the fraction 25/8 is in lowest terms or if the problem expects the sum m+n, not just the fraction.

We compute each term: 4a=4·(–7/24)=–28/24=–7/6; 3b=3·(–3/8)=–9/8; 2c=2·(–5/12)=–10/12=–5/6. Summing: L=(–7/6)+(–5/6)+(–9/8)= (–12/6)+(–9/8)=–2 –9/8. Converting –2 to eighths: –2=–16/8, so L=–16/8 –9/8=–25/8. Taking absolute value: |L|=25/8.\n\nNext, we express 25/8 in lowest terms. The numerator is 25=5^2, the denominator is 8=2^3.
