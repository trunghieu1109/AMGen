============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
   - Variable: z is a complex number satisfying |z| = 4.
   - Expression under consideration: (75 + 117i)·z + (96 + 144i)/z.
   - z ≠ 0 (implicitly ensured by |z| = 4).

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
   - The expression consists of a linear term in z and a reciprocal term in z.
   - On the circle |z| = 4, one may parametrize z = 4e^{iθ}, so each term becomes a constant times e^{iθ} or e^{−iθ}.
   - The real part involves combinations of cos θ and sin θ, weighted by the real and imaginary parts of the coefficients.
   - Constraints (|z| fixed) force a one-parameter family; extremal values arise from balancing contributions of the linear and reciprocal parts.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
   - Complex analysis and trigonometric optimization.
   - Subfields: geometry of the complex plane, maxima of harmonic sums, extreme‐value problems on circles.
   - Contexts: contest mathematics, signal processing (phasor sums), algebraic‐geometric methods.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
   - All terms and constraints are clearly defined; z lies on a nonzero circle.
   - Potential challenge: combining two harmonic contributions to find the overall maximum of the real part.
   - No ambiguities in notation or domain; computation can be nontrivial but the setup is complete.

Parametrization: Since |z|=4, we set z=4e^{iθ}, θ∈[0,2π).  \n\n2. First term: (75+117i)z = (75+117i)·4e^{iθ} = 4(75+117i)e^{iθ}.  We put (75+117i) into polar form: its magnitude is r1=√(75²+117²)=√19314, and its argument φ1=arctan(117/75) (both components positive, so φ1 in (0,π/2)).  Thus (75+117i)=r1 e^{iφ1}, so  \n   (75+117i)z = 4r1 e^{i(θ+φ1)} = 4√19314 · e^{i(θ+arctan(117/75))}.  \n\n3.

Put (24+36i) into polar form: r2=√(24²+36²)=√1872=4√117, φ2=arctan(36/24)=arctan(3/2) (again first quadrant).  Hence (96+144i)/z = r2 e^{i(φ2−θ)} = 4√117 · e^{i(arctan(3/2)−θ)}.  \n\nAll angles are taken in their principal values in (0,π/2).\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent J6AW:\nWe are asked to parametrize z on the circle |z|=4 and then rewrite two complex expressions in exponential (polar) form.  Step 1: Parametrization of z.  Since |z|=4, the standard parametrization is z=4e^{iθ}, with θ real (we may take θ∈[0,2π), and note that adding 2πk gives the same point on the circle).  Step 2: Write 75+117i in polar form.  Compute its modulus r₁=|75+117i|=√(75²+117²)=√(5625+13689)=√19314.  Its argument φ₁ satisfies tanφ₁=117/75 (so φ₁=arctan(117/75), with the appropriate quadrant: both 75 and 117 are positive, so φ₁∈(0,π/2)).  Thus 75+117i=√19314·e^{iφ₁}, φ₁=arctan(117/75)+2πk.  Step 3: Multiply by z: (75+117i)z=(√19314·e^{iφ₁})(4e^{iθ})=4√19314·e^{i(θ+φ₁)}.  Step 4: Write 96+144i in polar form.  Factor 48: 96+144i=48(2+3i).  Its modulus is r₂=|96+144i|=48√(2²+3²)=48√13.  Its argument φ₂ satisfies tanφ₂=3/2 (both parts positive), so φ₂=arctan(3/2)+2πk.  Thus 96+144i=48√13·e^{iφ₂}.  Step 5: Divide by z: (96+144i)/z=(48√13·e^{iφ₂})/(4e^{iθ})=12√13·e^{i(φ₂−θ)}.  We have covered the general 2πk ambiguity in the arguments.  This completes the detailed derivation without skipping any algebraic or trigonometric steps.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent zFvD:\nWe need to express both (75+117i)z and (96+144i)/z in the form R\u2009e^{iφ} when z runs around the circle |z|=4.

Compute (96+144i)/z:\n   a.  First divide by 4: (96+144i)/4 = 24+36i.  Its modulus is |24+36i|=√(24^2+36^2)=√(576+1296)=√1872=12√13, and its argument is arg(24+36i)=arctan(36/24)=arctan(3/2).\n   b.

The natural parametrization is z=4e^{iθ}.  Then:\n\n1.  Compute (75+117i)z:\n   a.

Compute (96+144i)/z:\n   a.  First divide by 4: (96+144i)/4 = 24+36i.  Its modulus is |24+36i|=√(24^2+36^2)=√(576+1296)=√1872=12√13, and its argument is arg(24+36i)=arctan(36/24)=arctan(3/2).\n   b.  Since 1/z = e^{-iθ}/4, we already divided by 4, so\n      (96+144i)/z = (24+36i)e^{-iθ} = 12√13\u2009e^{i(arctan(3/2) - θ)}.\n\nWe note that since the real parts 75 and 117 are positive, arctan(117/75) and arctan(3/2) both lie in (0,π/2), so no additional π must be added in their principal values.\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent epmn:\nz=4e^{iθ},\n(75+117i)z=4√19314·e^{i(θ+arctan(117/75))},\n(96+144i)/z=4√117·e^{i(arctan(3/2)−θ)}\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent J6AW:\n(75+117i)z = 4√19314·e^{i(θ + arctan(117/75))},  (96+144i)/z = 12√13·e^{i(arctan(3/2) − θ)}\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent zFvD:\nLet z=4\u2009e^{iθ}.

Parametrize z=4e^{iθ}, so the expression becomes Re[4(75+117i)e^{iθ} + (96+144i)/4 e^{-iθ}]. 2. Expand: 4(75+117i)(cosθ + i sinθ) gives real part 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ. The second term (24+36i)(cosθ - i sinθ) gives real part 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ. Sum: (300+24)cosθ + (−468+36)sinθ = 324cosθ − 432sinθ. 3.
