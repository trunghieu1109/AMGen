============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
   • Total population: 900 residents of Aimeville.
   • Four items considered:
     – Diamond ring: 195 owners.
     – Golf clubs: 367 owners.
     – Garden spade: 562 owners.
     – Candy hearts: 900 owners (every resident).
   • Ownership counts by exact number of items:
     – Exactly two items: 437 residents.
     – Exactly three items: 234 residents.
   • Unknown quantity to find: number of residents owning all four items.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
   • Sets: let D, G, S, H denote owners of diamond rings, golf clubs, spades, hearts.
   • Universe U has |U|=900; |H|=900 so H=U.
   • Inclusion–exclusion over four sets applies:
     |D∪G∪S∪H| = ∑|single| − ∑|pairwise| + ∑|triple| − |quadruple|.
   • Counts of "exactly k" imply sums of intersection sizes of various orders but do not immediately yield individual intersection counts.
   • Constraints ("exactly two", "exactly three") restrict possible distributions of pairwise and triple overlaps; these interact to determine |D∩G∩S∩H|.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
   • Primary domain: combinatorics (set theory, counting principles).
   • Specific concept: inclusion–exclusion principle and distributions of elements by intersection order.
   • Contexts: classic set‐counting problems, probability/set‐theory exercises in discrete mathematics or competition math.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
   • Individual pairwise or triple intersection sizes are not given; only total counts of residents in exactly two or exactly three categories.
   • Interpretation of "owns exactly two of these things"—does it include hearts as one of the two? (Yes, hearts count since H=U.)
   • No direct counts for residents owning exactly one item or none—but here none own none since everyone owns hearts.
   • Potential multiple configurations of intersections require careful accounting to avoid under‐ or over‐counting.

============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
   • Total population: 900 residents of Aimeville.
   • Four types of ownership: diamond ring (D), golf clubs (G), garden spade (S), candy hearts (H).
   • |D| = 195, |G| = 367, |S| = 562.
   • Every one of the 900 owns H, so |H| = 900.
   • 437 residents own exactly two of {D,G,S,H}.
   • 234 residents own exactly three of {D,G,S,H}.
   • We seek the number of residents owning all four.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
   • We have four sets D, G, S, H over a universe of size 900.
   • Since H = the entire universe, intersections involving H reduce to the other sets.
   • The ‘‘exactly k’’ counts place constraints on all pairwise, triple, and quadruple intersections:
       – Exactly two means ∑|X ∩ Y| over X<Y minus contributions from triples and quadruples sums to 437.
       – Exactly three means sum of triple intersections minus 4-fold intersections equals 234.
   • Inclusion–exclusion will link the individual |D|,|G|,|S|,|H| with sums of intersections to determine the unknown |D ∩ G ∩ S ∩ H|.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
   • Main domain: Combinatorics, specifically finite set theory and the inclusion–exclusion principle.
   • Subconcepts: Counting arguments for unions/intersections; exact-k overlap counts.
   • Common contexts: survey or census problems; Venn diagram analysis; competition math.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
   • Interpretation of “exactly two” and “exactly three”: assumed over all four categories uniformly.
   • Because H is universal, some might misinterpret pair/triple counts that include H.
   • No other numerical ambiguities, but careful bookkeeping is required to avoid over- or under-counting intersections.
