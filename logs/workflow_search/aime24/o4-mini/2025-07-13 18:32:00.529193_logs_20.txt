============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
   • b is an integer with b ≥ 2.
   • A positive integer n is called b-eautiful if:
     – In base b, n has exactly two digits, say d₁ (the leading digit) and d₀ (the units digit), with 1 ≤ d₁ ≤ b−1 and 0 ≤ d₀ ≤ b−1.
     – The sum of those two digits equals √n.  
   • Example: For b=13, n=81; in base 13, 81 = 6·13 + 3, so digits are (6,3), and 6+3=9=√81.
   • The question: Find the smallest integer b ≥ 2 for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
   • Writing n = d₁·b + d₀ and letting k = √n ∈ ℕ, the conditions become:
     (i)  d₁·b + d₀ = k²,
     (ii) d₁ + d₀ = k,
     with digit bounds 1 ≤ d₁ ≤ b−1, 0 ≤ d₀ ≤ b−1.
   • These two equations link the base b, the digit pair (d₁,d₀), and the integer k in a small Diophantine system.
   • The “exactly two digits” constraint enforces d₁ ≠ 0, and the digit‐sum = √n condition forces n to be a perfect square.
   • To count b-eautiful n, one must find all integer solutions (b,d₁,d₀,k) satisfying both equations and digit bounds, then check how many distinct n arise.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
   • Primary domain: elementary number theory (especially base‐representation and digit‐sum properties).
   • Subfields/concepts: Diophantine equations, digital expansions in arbitrary bases, enumeration of constrained integer solutions.
   • Contexts: contest/problem‐solving in olympiads, basic cryptography or coding theory (digit constraints), computational search.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
   • It is assumed that "exactly two digits" means no leading zero, so d₁ ≥ 1.
   • All variables (b,d₁,d₀,k) are integers; √n must be integer.
   • Potential complexity arises from how b grows and how many solutions (d₁,d₀,k) exist for each b; one must be careful that counting distinct n does not double‐count when different digit pairs give the same n.
   • No other hidden constraints appear, but the search over b and k could be computationally heavy for large b.

Next, we impose the b-eautiful condition: the sum of the two digits equals √n. Let k = √n, which must be an integer. Then d1 + d0 = k and k^2 = n. Substituting n = d1·b + d0 into k^2 = n gives k^2 = d1·b + d0. Replacing k by (d1 + d0) yields (d1 + d0)^2 = d1·b + d0. Expanding gives d1^2 + 2d1d0 + d0^2 = d1·b + d0. This single quadratic relation, together with the integer constraints on d1, d0, and k, fully characterizes all b-eautiful numbers.
