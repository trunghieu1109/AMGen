============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
   - Let ABCDEF be a convex equilateral hexagon with common side length s.
   - Opposite sides are parallel: AB ∥ DE, BC ∥ EF, CD ∥ FA.
   - Extend lines AB, CD, and EF; their pairwise intersections form a triangle whose side lengths are 200, 240, and 300.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
   - Parallelism of opposite sides implies the hexagon is an affine image of a regular hexagon; interior angles alternate in two values.
   - The three chosen directions (along AB, CD, EF) meet at three intersection points; the distances between these points depend on s and the angles between those directions.
   - The given triangle side lengths correspond to pairwise distances between lines in those directions; they encode linear combinations of s scaled by trigonometric functions of the hexagon’s angles.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
   - Primary domain: Euclidean plane geometry.
   - Subfields/concepts: convex equilateral polygons, parallelism, affine transformations, triangle geometry.
   - Typical context: competition-style geometry problems involving special convex polygons and line-extension arguments.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
   - Which given length (200, 240, 300) corresponds to the intersection distance of which pair of lines (AB vs. CD, CD vs. EF, EF vs. AB).
   - Implicit orientation or labeling of A, B, C, D, E, F to ensure consistent assignment of directions and intersection points.
   - Assumption that lines are extended indefinitely and intersections lie in a convex configuration.

Vector‐based representation automatically captures side lengths and parallelism.  Label the directed edges as • AB=u, • BC=v, • CD=w, • DE=?, • EF=?, • FA=?.  We want DE ∥ AB, EF ∥ BC, FA ∥ CD, and all lengths equal to s.\n\n2. Equilateral and parallel opposite sides force DE=–u, EF=–v, FA=–w, with |u|=|v|=|w|=s.

Convexity is guaranteed if the three nonzero vectors u,v,w emanate from a common origin and their arguments (angles) increase strictly in counterclockwise order with each turning angle less than π.  Explicitly, if θ_u, θ_v, θ_w are their arguments, we require 0<θ_v–θ_u<π, 0<θ_w–θ_v<π, and 0<(θ_u+2π)–θ_w<π.  This ensures all interior angles are less than π and the boundary winds once around.\n\n4.

Label the directed edges e1=𝐵−𝐴, e2=𝐶−𝐵, e3=𝐷−𝐶, e4=𝐸−𝐷, e5=𝐹−𝐸, e6=𝐴−𝐹.  Because the hexagon closes, e1+e2+e3+e4+e5+e6=0.  “Opposite sides parallel” means e1∥e4, e2∥e5, e3∥e6, and since all sides have equal length s, each pair of parallel vectors must be equal in magnitude.  The only way to satisfy closure is e4=−e1, e5=−e2, e6=−e3.  Then e1+e2+e3+(−e1)+(−e2)+(−e3)=0 holds identically.  To ensure convexity, we take three noncollinear vectors a, b, c in the plane, each of length s, whose arguments (angles) are strictly increasing in cyclic order and differ by less than π (so the turn at each vertex remains interior and positive).  We then set e1=a, e2=b, e3=c, e4=−a, e5=−b, e6=−c.  Choose A at the origin.  Then consecutive vertices are B=A+a, C=B+b, D=C+c, E=D−a, F=E−b, returning to A=F−c.

Opposite sides are parallel by construction, and each of the six sides has the same length exactly when |u|=|v|=|w|=s.\n\n2.  Convexity condition:  To ensure ABCDEF is convex and the labels proceed around the boundary in order, we require that the three vectors u, v, w all emanate from the same point (say the origin) and appear in counterclockwise order with each turning angle strictly between 0 and π.  Explicitly, if we write their arguments (angles) θ_u, θ_v, θ_w, then we demand\n    0 < θ_v – θ_u < π,\n    0 < θ_w – θ_v < π,\n    and, for closure of a full turn, 0 < (θ_u + 2π) – θ_w < π.\n   This guarantees that when we walk along AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FA in that order, the interior always remains on our left side, hence convexity.\n\n3.  Coordinate realization:  A convenient embedding in the plane is:\n    A = (0,0),\n    B = A + u,\n    C = B + v = u + v,\n    D = C + w = u + v + w,\n    E = D – u = v + w,\n    F = E – v = w.\n   Here u, v, w are three vectors of length s arranged cyclically CCW as above.  One may choose an explicit orthonormal basis and set\n    u = s·(1,0),\n    v = s·(cos α, sin α),\n    w = s·(cos β, sin β),\n   with 0<α<π, 0<β–α<π, and α<β<α+π to satisfy the convexity inequalities.\n\nThis construction yields exactly the family of all convex equilateral hexagons with opposite sides parallel (up to rigid motions and relabeling).\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent gK6L:\nWe want an equilateral convex hexagon ABCDEF with all opposite sides parallel. 1. Label the consecutive edge vectors as →AB=u, →BC=v, →CD=w, →DE, →EF, →FA. 2. Opposite sides parallel means →DE must be parallel to →AB, →EF∥→BC, →FA∥→CD. 3. Because the hexagon is equilateral, all six edges have the same length s. 4. The only way to assign six vectors of length s so that three pairs of them are parallel and they sum to zero (closure) is to take the first three vectors u,v,w (all of length s) and then take the next three to be their negatives: –u, –v, –w. 5. Thus the edge‐vector sequence is u, v, w, –u, –v, –w; these sum to zero, ensuring closure. 6. Convexity requires that u, v, w are ordered by angle around the origin so they rotate strictly in one direction (for example, 0<arg(u)<arg(v)<arg(w)<π). 7. Therefore set A=(0,0), B=A+u, C=B+v, D=C+w, E=D–u, F=E–v. Then FA=F–A=–w. Each segment has length |u|=|v|=|w|=s and opposite sides are parallel (since DE=–u, EF=–v, FA=–w).\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent pSps:\nLabel three vectors a, b, c in the plane with |a|=|b|=|c|=s whose directions satisfy 0<arg(b)−arg(a),arg(c)−arg(b),arg(a)−arg(c (mod 2π))<π.

One may choose an explicit orthonormal basis and set\n    u = s·(1,0),\n    v = s·(cos α, sin α),\n    w = s·(cos β, sin β),\n   with 0<α<π, 0<β–α<π, and α<β<α+π to satisfy the convexity inequalities.\n\nThis construction yields exactly the family of all convex equilateral hexagons with opposite sides parallel (up to rigid motions and relabeling).\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent gK6L:\nWe want an equilateral convex hexagon ABCDEF with all opposite sides parallel. 1. Label the consecutive edge vectors as →AB=u, →BC=v, →CD=w, →DE, →EF, →FA. 2. Opposite sides parallel means →DE must be parallel to →AB, →EF∥→BC, →FA∥→CD. 3. Because the hexagon is equilateral, all six edges have the same length s. 4. The only way to assign six vectors of length s so that three pairs of them are parallel and they sum to zero (closure) is to take the first three vectors u,v,w (all of length s) and then take the next three to be their negatives: –u, –v, –w. 5. Thus the edge‐vector sequence is u, v, w, –u, –v, –w; these sum to zero, ensuring closure. 6. Convexity requires that u, v, w are ordered by angle around the origin so they rotate strictly in one direction (for example, 0<arg(u)<arg(v)<arg(w)<π). 7. Therefore set A=(0,0), B=A+u, C=B+v, D=C+w, E=D–u, F=E–v. Then FA=F–A=–w. Each segment has length |u|=|v|=|w|=s and opposite sides are parallel (since DE=–u, EF=–v, FA=–w).\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent pSps:\nLabel three vectors a, b, c in the plane with |a|=|b|=|c|=s whose directions satisfy 0<arg(b)−arg(a),arg(c)−arg(b),arg(a)−arg(c (mod 2π))<π.

Please think carefully and provide an updated answer. \n\n ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent my7T:\nWe need explicit parametric equations of the three lines AB, CD, EF in a convenient coordinate system that captures all convex equilateral hexagons with opposite sides parallel.  Following the standard vector‐model (edges AB=u, BC=v, CD=w, DE=–u, EF=–v, FA=–w), we place A at the origin and orient u along the x–axis: \n\n1.  Choose A=(0,0) and set u=(s,0).  Let v have length s and angle θ from the x–axis, so v=(s\u2009cos\u2009θ,\u2009s\u2009sin\u2009θ).  Let w have length s and angle φ from the x–axis, w=(s\u2009cos\u2009φ,\u2009s\u2009sin\u2009φ), with 0<θ<π, θ<φ<θ+π, φ<2π.  This choice ensures each side has length s and opposite sides are parallel by DE=–u, EF=–v, FA=–w.  The convexity conditions on θ, φ guarantee no three points are collinear and all interior angles <π.\n\n2.  Compute the relevant vertices:\n   B=A+u=(s,0)\n   C=B+v=(s+s\u2009cos\u2009θ,\t s\u2009sin\u2009θ)\n   D=C+w=(s+s\u2009cos\u2009θ+s\u2009cos\u2009φ,\t s\u2009sin\u2009θ+s\u2009sin\u2009φ)\n   E=v+w=(s\u2009cos\u2009θ+s\u2009cos\u2009φ,\t s\u2009sin\u2009θ+s\u2009sin\u2009φ)\n   F=w=(s\u2009cos\u2009φ,\t s\u2009sin\u2009φ)\n\n3.  Then the three lines:\n   • AB is the line through A in direction u:\n     AB: (x,y)=(t\u2009s,\t0),\t t∈ℝ.\n\n   • CD is the line through C in direction w:\n     CD: (x,y)=(s(1+cos\u2009θ)+t\u2009s\u2009cos\u2009φ,\t s\u2009sin\u2009θ+t\u2009s\u2009sin\u2009φ),\t t∈ℝ.\n\n   • EF is the line through E in direction –v:\n     EF: (x,y)=(s(cos\u2009θ+cos\u2009φ)−t\u2009s\u2009cos\u2009θ,\t s(sin\u2009θ+sin\u2009φ)−t\u2009s\u2009sin\u2009θ),\t t∈ℝ.\n\nThese equations are given in terms of the side length s and the two angular parameters θ, φ.  In later triangle‐side computations one finds φ determined by the condition on the triangle with side‐lengths 200,240,300, reducing to one effective parameter θ.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent HYzR:\nTo derive parametric equations for the three lines AB, CD, and EF in a completely general convex equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel, one needs:\n\n1. A concrete but flexible coordinate placement.  We may rigidly translate and rotate the figure without loss of generality.\n2. Two angular parameters (the exterior “turning” angles between consecutive edges) and the common side length s.  Convexity forces these angles θ and φ to lie in (0,π) with θ+φ<π, and the third exterior angle is ψ=π−θ−φ.\n3. Explicit vector‐edge notation: u=AB, v=BC, w=CD, DE=−u, EF=−v, FA=−w, each of length s.  Then opposite sides are automatically parallel, closure is automatic, and convexity is ensured by 0<θ,φ<π, θ+φ<π.\n\nStep‐by‐step:\n\n• Place A at the origin and orient AB along the positive x‐axis:  A=(0,0), u=AB=(s,0), so B=(s,0).\n\n• Let the exterior angle from u to v be θ.  Then v=BC=(s cosθ, s sinθ), so C=B+v=(s+s cosθ, s sinθ).\n\n• Let the next exterior angle (from v to w) be φ.  Then w=CD=(s cos(θ+φ), s sin(θ+φ)), so D=C+w=(s+s cosθ+s cos(θ+φ), s sinθ+s sin(θ+φ)).\n\n• By the equilateral + parallel‐opposites condition, DE=−u, EF=−v, FA=−w.  Hence E=D−u and F=E−v in turn, but all that matters now is the line EF has direction −v.\n\n• We now write each of the three lines in standard parametric form using real parameters t, u, λ.  Every line is described for all real values of its parameter.\n\nThis yields the following final parametric equations.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent VcBX:\nTo derive parametric equations for lines AB, CD, and EF, we start with the standard vector‐based model of a convex equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel. 1.  Place A at the origin O=(0,0).  2.  Let the edge vectors be u, v, and w of common length s, satisfying convexity by requiring their directions (angles) increase strictly. 3.  Up to rotation and relabeling, we may take u along the positive x‐axis, v at angle θ₁ from u, and w at angle θ₂ from u, with 0<θ₁<θ₂<π and θ₁+θ₂<π.  Then:    • u = (s, 0)    • v = (s\u2009cosθ₁,\u2009s\u2009sinθ₁)    • w = (s\u2009cosθ₂,\u2009s\u2009sinθ₂). 4.  The six vertices are:    A = (0,0)    B = A + u = (s, 0)    C = B + v = (s + s\u2009cosθ₁,\u2009s\u2009sinθ₁)    D = C + w = (s + s\u2009cosθ₁ + s\u2009cosθ₂,\u2009s\u2009sinθ₁ + s\u2009sinθ₂)    E = D – u = (s\u2009cosθ₁ + s\u2009cosθ₂,\u2009s\u2009sinθ₁ + s\u2009sinθ₂)    F = E – v = (s\u2009cosθ₂,\u2009s\u2009sinθ₂). 5.  Opposite sides are then AB∥DE, BC∥EF, and CD∥FA by construction. 6.  Hence the three lines of interest are:    • Line AB passes through A with direction u.    • Line CD passes through C with direction w.    • Line EF passes through E with direction –v (or equivalently v). 7.  Writing each line in parametric form with parameter t∈ℝ gives the final result below.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent 70rU:\nWe need explicit parametric equations for the three lines AB, CD, and EF in terms of the side length s and one angle parameter θ, under the model of a convex equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel.  A particularly simple choice is to take the first edge AB aligned with the positive x–axis and the second edge BC making angle θ with it; then, to ensure opposite‐side parallelism and equal lengths, the third edge CD must go in the direction π–θ.  Concretely:  \n\n1.  Choose u=(s,0) so that AB has length s along the x–axis.  Then set v=(s\u2009cos\u2009θ,s\u2009sin\u2009θ) so that BC also has length s and makes an angle θ with AB.  To ensure CD is parallel to FA (the opposite side of CD) and has the same length s but in the “reflected” direction, take w = (s\u2009cos(π–θ),s\u2009sin(π–θ)) = (–s\u2009cos\u2009θ,s\u2009sin\u2009θ).  \n\n2.  Place A at (0,0).  Then B = A+u = (s,0).  Next C = B+v = (s + s\u2009cos\u2009θ, s\u2009sin\u2009θ).  Then D = C+w = (s + s\u2009cos\u2009θ – s\u2009cos\u2009θ, s\u2009sin\u2009θ + s\u2009sin\u2009θ) = (s,2s\u2009sin\u2009θ).  Next E = D–u = (0,2s\u2009sin\u2009θ) and F = E–v = (–s\u2009cos\u2009θ,s\u2009sin\u2009θ).  \n\n3.  Now write each of the three lines in point‐direction form:\n   • AB passes through A=(0,0) with direction u=(1,0).  \n   • CD passes through C=(s + s\u2009cos\u2009θ, s\u2009sin\u2009θ) with direction w normalized to (–cos\u2009θ,sin\u2009θ).  \n   • EF passes through E=(0,2s\u2009sin\u2009θ) with direction –v normalized to (–cos\u2009θ,–sin\u2009θ).  \n\nThese parametrizations are valid for any 0<θ<π, ensuring convexity.

Convexity is guaranteed if the three nonzero vectors u,v,w emanate from a common origin and their arguments (angles) increase strictly in counterclockwise order with each turning angle less than π.  Explicitly, if θ_u, θ_v, θ_w are their arguments, we require 0<θ_v–θ_u<π, 0<θ_w–θ_v<π, and 0<(θ_u+2π)–θ_w<π.  This ensures all interior angles are less than π and the boundary winds once around.\n\n4. Up to a rigid motion, we can place A at the origin, then define the six vertices sequentially so that each edge vector matches the desired u,v,w,–u,–v,–w.  This parametrizes exactly all convex equilateral hexagons with opposite sides parallel.\n\n### answer by Final Decision Agent usL3:\nChoose three vectors u,v,w in the plane, each of length s, whose arguments satisfy\n0 < arg(v) – arg(u) < π,\n0 < arg(w) – arg(v) < π,\n0 < (arg(u)+2π) – arg(w) < π.\nThen set\nA = (0,0),\nB = A + u,\nC = B + v = u + v,\nD = C + w = u + v + w,\nE = D – u = v + w,\nF = E – v = w.\n\nThe directed edges are AB=u, BC=v, CD=w, DE=–u, EF=–v, FA=–w.  All six sides have length s, opposite sides are parallel by construction, and the cyclic ordering of u,v,w guarantees convexity.\n\n### Sub-task 2: Choose a coordinate system and derive parametric equations for lines AB, CD, EF in terms of s and θ.Given solutions to the problem from other agents, consider their opinions as additional advice. Please think carefully and provide an updated answer. \n\n ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent my7T:\nWe need explicit parametric equations of the three lines AB, CD, EF in a convenient coordinate system that captures all convex equilateral hexagons with opposite sides parallel.  Following the standard vector‐model (edges AB=u, BC=v, CD=w, DE=–u, EF=–v, FA=–w), we place A at the origin and orient u along the x–axis: \n\n1.  Choose A=(0,0) and set u=(s,0).  Let v have length s and angle θ from the x–axis, so v=(s\u2009cos\u2009θ,\u2009s\u2009sin\u2009θ).  Let w have length s and angle φ from the x–axis, w=(s\u2009cos\u2009φ,\u2009s\u2009sin\u2009φ), with 0<θ<π, θ<φ<θ+π, φ<2π.  This choice ensures each side has length s and opposite sides are parallel by DE=–u, EF=–v, FA=–w.  The convexity conditions on θ, φ guarantee no three points are collinear and all interior angles <π.\n\n2.  Compute the relevant vertices:\n   B=A+u=(s,0)\n   C=B+v=(s+s\u2009cos\u2009θ,\t s\u2009sin\u2009θ)\n   D=C+w=(s+s\u2009cos\u2009θ+s\u2009cos\u2009φ,\t s\u2009sin\u2009θ+s\u2009sin\u2009φ)\n   E=v+w=(s\u2009cos\u2009θ+s\u2009cos\u2009φ,\t s\u2009sin\u2009θ+s\u2009sin\u2009φ)\n   F=w=(s\u2009cos\u2009φ,\t s\u2009sin\u2009φ)\n\n3.  Then the three lines:\n   • AB is the line through A in direction u:\n     AB: (x,y)=(t\u2009s,\t0),\t t∈ℝ.\n\n   • CD is the line through C in direction w:\n     CD: (x,y)=(s(1+cos\u2009θ)+t\u2009s\u2009cos\u2009φ,\t s\u2009sin\u2009θ+t\u2009s\u2009sin\u2009φ),\t t∈ℝ.\n\n   • EF is the line through E in direction –v:\n     EF: (x,y)=(s(cos\u2009θ+cos\u2009φ)−t\u2009s\u2009cos\u2009θ,\t s(sin\u2009θ+sin\u2009φ)−t\u2009s\u2009sin\u2009θ),\t t∈ℝ.\n\nThese equations are given in terms of the side length s and the two angular parameters θ, φ.  In later triangle‐side computations one finds φ determined by the condition on the triangle with side‐lengths 200,240,300, reducing to one effective parameter θ.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent HYzR:\nTo derive parametric equations for the three lines AB, CD, and EF in a completely general convex equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel, one needs:\n\n1. A concrete but flexible coordinate placement.  We may rigidly translate and rotate the figure without loss of generality.\n2. Two angular parameters (the exterior “turning” angles between consecutive edges) and the common side length s.  Convexity forces these angles θ and φ to lie in (0,π) with θ+φ<π, and the third exterior angle is ψ=π−θ−φ.\n3. Explicit vector‐edge notation: u=AB, v=BC, w=CD, DE=−u, EF=−v, FA=−w, each of length s.  Then opposite sides are automatically parallel, closure is automatic, and convexity is ensured by 0<θ,φ<π, θ+φ<π.\n\nStep‐by‐step:\n\n• Place A at the origin and orient AB along the positive x‐axis:  A=(0,0), u=AB=(s,0), so B=(s,0).\n\n• Let the exterior angle from u to v be θ.  Then v=BC=(s cosθ, s sinθ), so C=B+v=(s+s cosθ, s sinθ).\n\n• Let the next exterior angle (from v to w) be φ.  Then w=CD=(s cos(θ+φ), s sin(θ+φ)), so D=C+w=(s+s cosθ+s cos(θ+φ), s sinθ+s sin(θ+φ)).\n\n• By the equilateral + parallel‐opposites condition, DE=−u, EF=−v, FA=−w.  Hence E=D−u and F=E−v in turn, but all that matters now is the line EF has direction −v.\n\n• We now write each of the three lines in standard parametric form using real parameters t, u, λ.  Every line is described for all real values of its parameter.\n\nThis yields the following final parametric equations.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent VcBX:\nTo derive parametric equations for lines AB, CD, and EF, we start with the standard vector‐based model of a convex equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel. 1.  Place A at the origin O=(0,0).  2.  Let the edge vectors be u, v, and w of common length s, satisfying convexity by requiring their directions (angles) increase strictly. 3.  Up to rotation and relabeling, we may take u along the positive x‐axis, v at angle θ₁ from u, and w at angle θ₂ from u, with 0<θ₁<θ₂<π and θ₁+θ₂<π.  Then:    • u = (s, 0)    • v = (s\u2009cosθ₁,\u2009s\u2009sinθ₁)    • w = (s\u2009cosθ₂,\u2009s\u2009sinθ₂). 4.  The six vertices are:    A = (0,0)    B = A + u = (s, 0)    C = B + v = (s + s\u2009cosθ₁,\u2009s\u2009sinθ₁)    D = C + w = (s + s\u2009cosθ₁ + s\u2009cosθ₂,\u2009s\u2009sinθ₁ + s\u2009sinθ₂)    E = D – u = (s\u2009cosθ₁ + s\u2009cosθ₂,\u2009s\u2009sinθ₁ + s\u2009sinθ₂)    F = E – v = (s\u2009cosθ₂,\u2009s\u2009sinθ₂). 5.  Opposite sides are then AB∥DE, BC∥EF, and CD∥FA by construction. 6.  Hence the three lines of interest are:    • Line AB passes through A with direction u.    • Line CD passes through C with direction w.    • Line EF passes through E with direction –v (or equivalently v). 7.  Writing each line in parametric form with parameter t∈ℝ gives the final result below.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent 70rU:\nWe need explicit parametric equations for the three lines AB, CD, and EF in terms of the side length s and one angle parameter θ, under the model of a convex equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel.  A particularly simple choice is to take the first edge AB aligned with the positive x–axis and the second edge BC making angle θ with it; then, to ensure opposite‐side parallelism and equal lengths, the third edge CD must go in the direction π–θ.  Concretely:  \n\n1.  Choose u=(s,0) so that AB has length s along the x–axis.  Then set v=(s\u2009cos\u2009θ,s\u2009sin\u2009θ) so that BC also has length s and makes an angle θ with AB.  To ensure CD is parallel to FA (the opposite side of CD) and has the same length s but in the “reflected” direction, take w = (s\u2009cos(π–θ),s\u2009sin(π–θ)) = (–s\u2009cos\u2009θ,s\u2009sin\u2009θ).  \n\n2.  Place A at (0,0).  Then B = A+u = (s,0).  Next C = B+v = (s + s\u2009cos\u2009θ, s\u2009sin\u2009θ).  Then D = C+w = (s + s\u2009cos\u2009θ – s\u2009cos\u2009θ, s\u2009sin\u2009θ + s\u2009sin\u2009θ) = (s,2s\u2009sin\u2009θ).  Next E = D–u = (0,2s\u2009sin\u2009θ) and F = E–v = (–s\u2009cos\u2009θ,s\u2009sin\u2009θ).  \n\n3.  Now write each of the three lines in point‐direction form:\n   • AB passes through A=(0,0) with direction u=(1,0).  \n   • CD passes through C=(s + s\u2009cos\u2009θ, s\u2009sin\u2009θ) with direction w normalized to (–cos\u2009θ,sin\u2009θ).  \n   • EF passes through E=(0,2s\u2009sin\u2009θ) with direction –v normalized to (–cos\u2009θ,–sin\u2009θ).  \n\nThese parametrizations are valid for any 0<θ<π, ensuring convexity.  All three lines extend infinitely, and their mutual intersections will yield the triangle constructed by the extensions of AB, CD, EF in the original problem.\n\n### answer #1 by Debate Agent my7T:\nCoordinate system and parametric equations:\n\nSet A=(0,0) and orient AB along the x–axis.

Observe that by symmetry of the equilateral‐hexagon construction, one expects simple rational sines and cosines.  We make the ansatz that θ and φ satisfy sinθ=4/5, cosθ=3/5 and sinφ=3/5, cosφ=4/5.  (This choice makes sin(θ−φ)= (4/5·4/5 − 3/5·3/5)=7/25 and yields nice arithmetic.)\n\n3.  Compute cotφ = cosφ/sinφ = (4/5)/(3/5)=4/3,  cotθ = (3/5)/(4/5)=3/4.\n\n4.  Substitute into the definitions:\n   X_R = 1 + (3/5) − (4/3)·(4/5) = 1 + 3/5 − 16/15 = (15/15 + 9/15 − 16/15)=8/15,\n   X_Q = (4/5) − (3/4)·(3/5) = 4/5 − 9/20 = (16/20 − 9/20)=7/20,\n   sin(θ−φ)=7/25,\n   X_P = 1 + 3/5 + 4/5 − [(4/5·4/5)/(7/25)] = 1 + 7/5 − [(16/25)/(7/25)]\n        = 1 + 7/5 − 16/7 = (7/7 + 49/35 − 80/35) = (35/35 + (49−80)/35)=4/35,\n   Y_P = 4/5 + 3/5 − [(4/5·3/5)/(7/25)]\n        = 7/5 − [(12/25)/(7/25)] = 7/5 − 12/7 = (49/35 − 60/35)=−11/35.\n\n5.

No one ever enforced the geometric constraints 0<θ<φ<π, φ−θ<π or y_P>0 (so that P lies above the x-axis), nor did they split the |X_Q−X_R| case and check which ordering of Q,R actually fits a convex hexagon.  3. The Debate stage in Sub‐task 4 produced four conflicting numeric proposals, then the “winner” simply picked one by an unverified ansatz, rather than systematically testing each candidate against the original unsquared equations and domain restrictions.', 'suggestion': '•\u2003Clarify in an early subtask which computed distance (PQ, QR, or RP) goes with each of the given lengths 200, 240, 300.  That way the system is fully determined rather than under\xadspecified.  \n•\u2003After solving the algebraic system for s (and θ,φ), introduce a verification subtask: rebuild the hexagon numerically, enforce 0<θ<φ<π and φ−θ<π, check y_P>0, and plug back into the *unsquared* distance formulas to eliminate extraneous roots.  Only solutions passing that geometric‐consistency check should be carried forward.\n•\u2003Break Sub-task 4 into (4.1) algebraic solution, (4.2) domain‐and‐sign‐case filtering, and (4.3) explicit numeric verification.  This will prevent acceptance of spurious s=84 and guide one to the correct unique value.'}}, {'verifier_name': 'gpt-4.1-mini', 'evaluation': {'failure_reason': 'The final answer s=84 is incorrect because the reasoning process failed to correctly reconcile the geometric constraints with the affine transformation properties of the hexagon and the triangle formed by the extended lines. The main error lies in the solving and verification step where multiple inconsistent candidate values for s were found, but the chosen root (s=84) does not satisfy all geometric conditions simultaneously. Additionally, the affine invariance and area-scaling arguments that relate the hexagon side length to the triangle side lengths were not properly integrated with the trigonometric system solution, leading to contradictory results and an incorrect final numeric value.', 'feedback': 'The reasoning process was thorough in modeling the hexagon and deriving parametric equations for the lines and their intersections, as well as formulating the system of equations relating s, θ, and φ to the given triangle side lengths. However, the critical failure occurred in Sub-task 4 (solving for s):\n\n1. Multiple candidate values for s (60, 84, 87, 120) emerged from different solution approaches, including direct algebraic elimination, affine area-scaling arguments, and trigonometric ansatzes.\n\n2. The final decision agent selected s=84 based on algebraic elimination and root checking, but this value conflicts with the affine geometry insight that the hexagon is an affine image of a regular hexagon, and the triangle formed by the extended lines is an affine image of an equilateral triangle of side 3s.\n\n3. The affine argument (used by some agents) suggests a value closer to 87, while other trigonometric consistency checks suggest 60 or 120, indicating inconsistency in the solution verification.\n\n4. The root cause is that the algebraic elimination and root-finding step did not fully incorporate or cross-validate the affine geometric constraints and area relations, leading to acceptance of a root that does not satisfy all geometric conditions.\n\n5. Moreover, the absolute value and sign cases in the distance equations were not exhaustively resolved, causing ambiguity in the solution branches.\n\n6. The workflow lacked a final consistency check step that integrates the affine geometry insight with the algebraic/trigonometric solutions to confirm the unique valid s.\n\nIn summary, the error is primarily in the solution and verification phase where the algebraic root was accepted without full geometric validation, and the multiple candidate solutions were not reconciled properly.', 'suggestion': '1. Integrate a dedicated final consistency verification subtask that cross-validates algebraic/trigonometric solutions with affine geometry and area-scaling arguments. This subtask should explicitly check that the candidate s satisfies both the system of equations and the affine invariance properties (e.g., area ratios, side length scaling).\n\n2. Refine Sub-task 4 by breaking it down into smaller subtasks: (a) Solve the system for s, θ, φ considering all sign and ordering cases explicitly; (b) Use affine geometry and area arguments to derive independent constraints on s; (c) Cross-validate and reconcile all candidate solutions to identify the unique physically consistent solution.\n\n3. Employ a stronger collaboration pattern for Sub-task 4, such as Debate combined with Reflexion, to allow agents to challenge and refine candidate solutions, ensuring no contradictions remain.\n\n4. Improve instructions for Sub-task 4 to emphasize the necessity of geometric consistency checks beyond pure algebraic root-finding, and require explicit handling of sign cases and solution branches.\n\nThese steps will prevent premature acceptance of incorrect roots and ensure the final numeric answer is geometrically valid and consistent with all problem constraints.'}}]

Ensure 0<θ<φ<π and φ−θ<π. \n\n ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent Vuf1:\nWe need to describe an equilateral convex hexagon ABCDEF whose opposite sides are parallel, using a single side‐length s and two angle parameters θ, φ satisfying 0<θ<φ<π and φ−θ<π. Since it’s equilateral, all six edges have the same length s. Parallelism of opposite edges shows there are only three distinct edge directions, each repeated once in the opposite direction. We may take those three directions to be angles 0, θ, and φ (all measured from the positive x–axis). Then the six (directed) side‐vectors in cyclic order can be chosen as:  v₁=AB=s·(cos0, sin0)=s·(1,0)  v₂=BC=s·(cosθ, sinθ)  v₃=CD=s·(cosφ, sinφ)  v₄=DE=−v₁= s·(−1,0)  v₅=EF=−v₂= s·(−cosθ, −sinθ)  v₆=FA=−v₃= s·(−cosφ, −sinφ)  Because v₄, v₅, v₆ are negatives of v₁, v₂, v₃, respectively, the closure condition v₁+⋯+v₆=0 holds automatically.  Convexity and correct cyclic ordering require that the turn from direction 0 to θ to φ to 0+π to θ+π to φ+π is strictly increasing in argument around the circle without reversing; this is guaranteed by 0<θ<φ<π and φ−θ<π.  No other case arises, since any re‐labeling or reflection of the three base directions yields an equivalent pattern up to rigid motion or relabeling of vertices.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent J05i:\nWe need to parameterize a convex equilateral hexagon ABCDEF with side length s, and opposite sides parallel: AB∥DE, BC∥EF, CD∥FA. We introduce two angles θ,φ and derive vertex coordinates in the plane.\n\n1. Choice of origin and initial direction:\n   - Place A at the origin: A=(0,0).\n   - Since AB∥DE and AB is one of our reference directions, we take AB to lie along the positive x–axis.  Thus B=A+s(1,0)=(s,0).\n\n2. Introduce angles θ,φ for the next two sides:\n   - Let BC make an angle θ with the positive x–axis: C=B+s(cosθ,sinθ).\n   - Let CD make an angle φ with the positive x–axis: D=C+s(cosφ,sinφ).\n   - Impose 0<θ<φ<π to keep turns in the same (counterclockwise) sense, and φ−θ<π to avoid a reflex turn that would break convexity.\n\n3. Parallelism of opposite sides gives the remaining directions up to a sign:\n   - DE∥AB ⇒ DE must be horizontal.  To keep the polygon turning left (counterclockwise), DE points left: angle=π.  Thus E=D+s(cosπ,sinπ)=D+s(−1,0).\n   - EF∥BC ⇒ EF has the same slope as BC but pointing opposite to continue the boundary: EF has angle θ+π.  So F=E+s(cos(θ+π),sin(θ+π))=E+s(−cosθ,−sinθ).\n   - FA∥CD ⇒ FA has the same slope as CD but again continuing the loop: angle φ+π.  The closing condition F+s(cos(φ+π),sin(φ+π)) must return to A=(0,0).  Indeed \n     F+s(−cosφ,−sinφ)=A is automatically satisfied by the previous sums of vectors cancelling in pairs.\n\n4. Convexity check and uniqueness:\n   - The sequence of edge directions is 0,θ,φ,π,θ+π,φ+π.  Since 0<θ<φ<π and φ−θ<π, these angles increase monotonically (mod 2π) and span less than one full rotation before closing, yielding a strictly convex hexagon.\n\n5. Other sign‐choices (for example taking DE to point right) would violate convexity or reverse orientation.  Thus this is the unique convex orientation satisfying the given parallelism and equilaterality.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent Xpi6:\nWe are asked to give a coordinate or vector model for a convex equilateral hexagon ABCDEF of side length s, with opposite sides parallel: AB ∥ DE, BC ∥ EF, CD ∥ FA, and to introduce two angle parameters θ, φ satisfying 0<θ<φ<π and φ−θ<π. We must justify every step and discuss all possible cases.\n\n1. Vector approach to opposite‐side parallelism and equal length:\n   - Label the side vectors in order around the hexagon as v₁=AB, v₂=BC, v₃=CD, v₄=DE, v₅=EF, v₆=FA.\n   - Equilateral condition: |v_i|=s for i=1,…,6.\n   - Opposite sides parallel (and equal length) ⇒ v₄=–v₁, v₅=–v₂, v₆=–v₃.\n   - Hexagon closure ⇒ v₁+v₂+v₃+v₄+v₅+v₆=0, which is automatically satisfied if v₄=–v₁, v₅=–v₂, v₆=–v₃.\n\n2. Reduce free parameters to two angles:\n   - We need three independent vectors v₁,v₂,v₃ of length s in the plane. Up to rigid motions, we can fix v₁ along the positive x‐axis: v₁=(s,0).\n   - Parametrize v₂ by an angle θ measured CCW from v₁: v₂=(s cosθ, s sinθ).\n   - Parametrize v₃ by a second angle φ measured CCW from v₁: v₃=(s cosφ, s sinφ).\n\n3. Convexity constraints:\n   - The ordered turning angles at the vertices must be between 0 and π.  Since we go from v₁ to v₂ to v₃ in CCW order,\n     we require 0<θ<φ<π (so each turn is less than 180° in the positive sense) and φ−θ<π (so the interior at C is <180°).\n   - These inequalities ensure that all interior angles of the hexagon are <π and that the hexagon is convex.\n\n4. Determine the remaining vertices and sides:\n   - Then v₄=DE=–v₁=(–s,0), v₅=EF=–v₂=(–s cosθ, –s sinθ), v₆=FA=–v₃=(–s cosφ, –s sinφ).\n   - Choose A=(0,0), B=A+v₁, C=B+v₂, D=C+v₃, E=D+v₄, F=E+v₅, and verify F+v₆=A.\n\n5. Discussion of other cases:\n   - The only other “case” would be reflecting the entire figure (replacing all angles by their negatives), which yields the same shape up to reflection.\n   - Swapping the order of θ and φ or reversing orientation would violate 0<θ<φ<π or convexity, so the above is the unique (up to rigid motion and reflection) model that satisfies all conditions.\n\nThus we have a complete, detailed vector/coordinate model depending on s, θ, φ with the required parallelism and convexity.\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent Vuf1:\nPlace A at the origin and let AB lie along the positive x–axis. Introduce two angles θ, φ with 0<θ<φ<π and φ−θ<π, and let all sides have length s. Define the directed side‐vectors in order around the hexagon by:\n\nAB = v₁ = s·(1,0)\nBC = v₂ = s·(cosθ, sinθ)\nCD = v₃ = s·(cosφ, sinφ)\nDE = v₄ = −v₁ = s·(−1,0)\nEF = v₅ = −v₂ = s·(−cosθ, −sinθ)\nFA = v₆ = −v₃ = s·(−cosφ, −sinφ)\n\nThen:\n1. All six sides have length s.  \n2. Opposite sides are parallel (since v₄=−v₁, v₅=−v₂, v₆=−v₃).  \n3. Closure v₁+…+v₆=0 is automatic.  \n4. Convexity and cyclic ordering are ensured by requiring 0<θ<φ<π and φ−θ<π.\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent J05i:\nLet s>0, choose angles satisfying 0<θ<φ<π and φ−θ<π.

Ensure 0<θ<φ<π and φ−θ<π. \n\n ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent Vuf1:\nWe need to describe an equilateral convex hexagon ABCDEF whose opposite sides are parallel, using a single side‐length s and two angle parameters θ, φ satisfying 0<θ<φ<π and φ−θ<π. Since it’s equilateral, all six edges have the same length s. Parallelism of opposite edges shows there are only three distinct edge directions, each repeated once in the opposite direction. We may take those three directions to be angles 0, θ, and φ (all measured from the positive x–axis). Then the six (directed) side‐vectors in cyclic order can be chosen as:  v₁=AB=s·(cos0, sin0)=s·(1,0)  v₂=BC=s·(cosθ, sinθ)  v₃=CD=s·(cosφ, sinφ)  v₄=DE=−v₁= s·(−1,0)  v₅=EF=−v₂= s·(−cosθ, −sinθ)  v₆=FA=−v₃= s·(−cosφ, −sinφ)  Because v₄, v₅, v₆ are negatives of v₁, v₂, v₃, respectively, the closure condition v₁+⋯+v₆=0 holds automatically.  Convexity and correct cyclic ordering require that the turn from direction 0 to θ to φ to 0+π to θ+π to φ+π is strictly increasing in argument around the circle without reversing; this is guaranteed by 0<θ<φ<π and φ−θ<π.  No other case arises, since any re‐labeling or reflection of the three base directions yields an equivalent pattern up to rigid motion or relabeling of vertices.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent J05i:\nWe need to parameterize a convex equilateral hexagon ABCDEF with side length s, and opposite sides parallel: AB∥DE, BC∥EF, CD∥FA. We introduce two angles θ,φ and derive vertex coordinates in the plane.\n\n1. Choice of origin and initial direction:\n   - Place A at the origin: A=(0,0).\n   - Since AB∥DE and AB is one of our reference directions, we take AB to lie along the positive x–axis.  Thus B=A+s(1,0)=(s,0).\n\n2. Introduce angles θ,φ for the next two sides:\n   - Let BC make an angle θ with the positive x–axis: C=B+s(cosθ,sinθ).\n   - Let CD make an angle φ with the positive x–axis: D=C+s(cosφ,sinφ).\n   - Impose 0<θ<φ<π to keep turns in the same (counterclockwise) sense, and φ−θ<π to avoid a reflex turn that would break convexity.\n\n3. Parallelism of opposite sides gives the remaining directions up to a sign:\n   - DE∥AB ⇒ DE must be horizontal.  To keep the polygon turning left (counterclockwise), DE points left: angle=π.  Thus E=D+s(cosπ,sinπ)=D+s(−1,0).\n   - EF∥BC ⇒ EF has the same slope as BC but pointing opposite to continue the boundary: EF has angle θ+π.  So F=E+s(cos(θ+π),sin(θ+π))=E+s(−cosθ,−sinθ).\n   - FA∥CD ⇒ FA has the same slope as CD but again continuing the loop: angle φ+π.  The closing condition F+s(cos(φ+π),sin(φ+π)) must return to A=(0,0).  Indeed \n     F+s(−cosφ,−sinφ)=A is automatically satisfied by the previous sums of vectors cancelling in pairs.\n\n4. Convexity check and uniqueness:\n   - The sequence of edge directions is 0,θ,φ,π,θ+π,φ+π.  Since 0<θ<φ<π and φ−θ<π, these angles increase monotonically (mod 2π) and span less than one full rotation before closing, yielding a strictly convex hexagon.\n\n5. Other sign‐choices (for example taking DE to point right) would violate convexity or reverse orientation.  Thus this is the unique convex orientation satisfying the given parallelism and equilaterality.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent Xpi6:\nWe are asked to give a coordinate or vector model for a convex equilateral hexagon ABCDEF of side length s, with opposite sides parallel: AB ∥ DE, BC ∥ EF, CD ∥ FA, and to introduce two angle parameters θ, φ satisfying 0<θ<φ<π and φ−θ<π. We must justify every step and discuss all possible cases.\n\n1. Vector approach to opposite‐side parallelism and equal length:\n   - Label the side vectors in order around the hexagon as v₁=AB, v₂=BC, v₃=CD, v₄=DE, v₅=EF, v₆=FA.\n   - Equilateral condition: |v_i|=s for i=1,…,6.\n   - Opposite sides parallel (and equal length) ⇒ v₄=–v₁, v₅=–v₂, v₆=–v₃.\n   - Hexagon closure ⇒ v₁+v₂+v₃+v₄+v₅+v₆=0, which is automatically satisfied if v₄=–v₁, v₅=–v₂, v₆=–v₃.\n\n2. Reduce free parameters to two angles:\n   - We need three independent vectors v₁,v₂,v₃ of length s in the plane. Up to rigid motions, we can fix v₁ along the positive x‐axis: v₁=(s,0).\n   - Parametrize v₂ by an angle θ measured CCW from v₁: v₂=(s cosθ, s sinθ).\n   - Parametrize v₃ by a second angle φ measured CCW from v₁: v₃=(s cosφ, s sinφ).\n\n3. Convexity constraints:\n   - The ordered turning angles at the vertices must be between 0 and π.  Since we go from v₁ to v₂ to v₃ in CCW order,\n     we require 0<θ<φ<π (so each turn is less than 180° in the positive sense) and φ−θ<π (so the interior at C is <180°).\n   - These inequalities ensure that all interior angles of the hexagon are <π and that the hexagon is convex.\n\n4. Determine the remaining vertices and sides:\n   - Then v₄=DE=–v₁=(–s,0), v₅=EF=–v₂=(–s cosθ, –s sinθ), v₆=FA=–v₃=(–s cosφ, –s sinφ).\n   - Choose A=(0,0), B=A+v₁, C=B+v₂, D=C+v₃, E=D+v₄, F=E+v₅, and verify F+v₆=A.\n\n5. Discussion of other cases:\n   - The only other “case” would be reflecting the entire figure (replacing all angles by their negatives), which yields the same shape up to reflection.\n   - Swapping the order of θ and φ or reversing orientation would violate 0<θ<φ<π or convexity, so the above is the unique (up to rigid motion and reflection) model that satisfies all conditions.\n\nThus we have a complete, detailed vector/coordinate model depending on s, θ, φ with the required parallelism and convexity.\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent Vuf1:\nPlace A at the origin and let AB lie along the positive x–axis.

Ensure 0<θ<φ<π and φ−θ<π. \n\n ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent Vuf1:\nWe need to describe an equilateral convex hexagon ABCDEF whose opposite sides are parallel, using a single side‐length s and two angle parameters θ, φ satisfying 0<θ<φ<π and φ−θ<π. Since it’s equilateral, all six edges have the same length s. Parallelism of opposite edges shows there are only three distinct edge directions, each repeated once in the opposite direction. We may take those three directions to be angles 0, θ, and φ (all measured from the positive x–axis). Then the six (directed) side‐vectors in cyclic order can be chosen as:  v₁=AB=s·(cos0, sin0)=s·(1,0)  v₂=BC=s·(cosθ, sinθ)  v₃=CD=s·(cosφ, sinφ)  v₄=DE=−v₁= s·(−1,0)  v₅=EF=−v₂= s·(−cosθ, −sinθ)  v₆=FA=−v₃= s·(−cosφ, −sinφ)  Because v₄, v₅, v₆ are negatives of v₁, v₂, v₃, respectively, the closure condition v₁+⋯+v₆=0 holds automatically.  Convexity and correct cyclic ordering require that the turn from direction 0 to θ to φ to 0+π to θ+π to φ+π is strictly increasing in argument around the circle without reversing; this is guaranteed by 0<θ<φ<π and φ−θ<π.  No other case arises, since any re‐labeling or reflection of the three base directions yields an equivalent pattern up to rigid motion or relabeling of vertices.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent J05i:\nWe need to parameterize a convex equilateral hexagon ABCDEF with side length s, and opposite sides parallel: AB∥DE, BC∥EF, CD∥FA. We introduce two angles θ,φ and derive vertex coordinates in the plane.\n\n1. Choice of origin and initial direction:\n   - Place A at the origin: A=(0,0).\n   - Since AB∥DE and AB is one of our reference directions, we take AB to lie along the positive x–axis.  Thus B=A+s(1,0)=(s,0).\n\n2. Introduce angles θ,φ for the next two sides:\n   - Let BC make an angle θ with the positive x–axis: C=B+s(cosθ,sinθ).\n   - Let CD make an angle φ with the positive x–axis: D=C+s(cosφ,sinφ).\n   - Impose 0<θ<φ<π to keep turns in the same (counterclockwise) sense, and φ−θ<π to avoid a reflex turn that would break convexity.\n\n3. Parallelism of opposite sides gives the remaining directions up to a sign:\n   - DE∥AB ⇒ DE must be horizontal.  To keep the polygon turning left (counterclockwise), DE points left: angle=π.  Thus E=D+s(cosπ,sinπ)=D+s(−1,0).\n   - EF∥BC ⇒ EF has the same slope as BC but pointing opposite to continue the boundary: EF has angle θ+π.  So F=E+s(cos(θ+π),sin(θ+π))=E+s(−cosθ,−sinθ).\n   - FA∥CD ⇒ FA has the same slope as CD but again continuing the loop: angle φ+π.  The closing condition F+s(cos(φ+π),sin(φ+π)) must return to A=(0,0).  Indeed \n     F+s(−cosφ,−sinφ)=A is automatically satisfied by the previous sums of vectors cancelling in pairs.\n\n4. Convexity check and uniqueness:\n   - The sequence of edge directions is 0,θ,φ,π,θ+π,φ+π.  Since 0<θ<φ<π and φ−θ<π, these angles increase monotonically (mod 2π) and span less than one full rotation before closing, yielding a strictly convex hexagon.\n\n5. Other sign‐choices (for example taking DE to point right) would violate convexity or reverse orientation.  Thus this is the unique convex orientation satisfying the given parallelism and equilaterality.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent Xpi6:\nWe are asked to give a coordinate or vector model for a convex equilateral hexagon ABCDEF of side length s, with opposite sides parallel: AB ∥ DE, BC ∥ EF, CD ∥ FA, and to introduce two angle parameters θ, φ satisfying 0<θ<φ<π and φ−θ<π. We must justify every step and discuss all possible cases.\n\n1. Vector approach to opposite‐side parallelism and equal length:\n   - Label the side vectors in order around the hexagon as v₁=AB, v₂=BC, v₃=CD, v₄=DE, v₅=EF, v₆=FA.\n   - Equilateral condition: |v_i|=s for i=1,…,6.\n   - Opposite sides parallel (and equal length) ⇒ v₄=–v₁, v₅=–v₂, v₆=–v₃.\n   - Hexagon closure ⇒ v₁+v₂+v₃+v₄+v₅+v₆=0, which is automatically satisfied if v₄=–v₁, v₅=–v₂, v₆=–v₃.\n\n2. Reduce free parameters to two angles:\n   - We need three independent vectors v₁,v₂,v₃ of length s in the plane. Up to rigid motions, we can fix v₁ along the positive x‐axis: v₁=(s,0).\n   - Parametrize v₂ by an angle θ measured CCW from v₁: v₂=(s cosθ, s sinθ).\n   - Parametrize v₃ by a second angle φ measured CCW from v₁: v₃=(s cosφ, s sinφ).\n\n3. Convexity constraints:\n   - The ordered turning angles at the vertices must be between 0 and π.  Since we go from v₁ to v₂ to v₃ in CCW order,\n     we require 0<θ<φ<π (so each turn is less than 180° in the positive sense) and φ−θ<π (so the interior at C is <180°).\n   - These inequalities ensure that all interior angles of the hexagon are <π and that the hexagon is convex.\n\n4. Determine the remaining vertices and sides:\n   - Then v₄=DE=–v₁=(–s,0), v₅=EF=–v₂=(–s cosθ, –s sinθ), v₆=FA=–v₃=(–s cosφ, –s sinφ).\n   - Choose A=(0,0), B=A+v₁, C=B+v₂, D=C+v₃, E=D+v₄, F=E+v₅, and verify F+v₆=A.\n\n5. Discussion of other cases:\n   - The only other “case” would be reflecting the entire figure (replacing all angles by their negatives), which yields the same shape up to reflection.\n   - Swapping the order of θ and φ or reversing orientation would violate 0<θ<φ<π or convexity, so the above is the unique (up to rigid motion and reflection) model that satisfies all conditions.\n\nThus we have a complete, detailed vector/coordinate model depending on s, θ, φ with the required parallelism and convexity.\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent Vuf1:\nPlace A at the origin and let AB lie along the positive x–axis.

Choice of origin and initial direction:\n   - Place A at the origin: A=(0,0).\n   - Since AB∥DE and AB is one of our reference directions, we take AB to lie along the positive x–axis.  Thus B=A+s(1,0)=(s,0).\n\n2. Introduce angles θ,φ for the next two sides:\n   - Let BC make an angle θ with the positive x–axis: C=B+s(cosθ,sinθ).\n   - Let CD make an angle φ with the positive x–axis: D=C+s(cosφ,sinφ).\n   - Impose 0<θ<φ<π to keep turns in the same (counterclockwise) sense, and φ−θ<π to avoid a reflex turn that would break convexity.\n\n3. Parallelism of opposite sides gives the remaining directions up to a sign:\n   - DE∥AB ⇒ DE must be horizontal.  To keep the polygon turning left (counterclockwise), DE points left: angle=π.  Thus E=D+s(cosπ,sinπ)=D+s(−1,0).\n   - EF∥BC ⇒ EF has the same slope as BC but pointing opposite to continue the boundary: EF has angle θ+π.  So F=E+s(cos(θ+π),sin(θ+π))=E+s(−cosθ,−sinθ).\n   - FA∥CD ⇒ FA has the same slope as CD but again continuing the loop: angle φ+π.  The closing condition F+s(cos(φ+π),sin(φ+π)) must return to A=(0,0).  Indeed \n     F+s(−cosφ,−sinφ)=A is automatically satisfied by the previous sums of vectors cancelling in pairs.\n\n4. Convexity check and uniqueness:\n   - The sequence of edge directions is 0,θ,φ,π,θ+π,φ+π.  Since 0<θ<φ<π and φ−θ<π, these angles increase monotonically (mod 2π) and span less than one full rotation before closing, yielding a strictly convex hexagon.\n\n5. Other sign‐choices (for example taking DE to point right) would violate convexity or reverse orientation.  Thus this is the unique convex orientation satisfying the given parallelism and equilaterality.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent Xpi6:\nWe are asked to give a coordinate or vector model for a convex equilateral hexagon ABCDEF of side length s, with opposite sides parallel: AB ∥ DE, BC ∥ EF, CD ∥ FA, and to introduce two angle parameters θ, φ satisfying 0<θ<φ<π and φ−θ<π. We must justify every step and discuss all possible cases.\n\n1. Vector approach to opposite‐side parallelism and equal length:\n   - Label the side vectors in order around the hexagon as v₁=AB, v₂=BC, v₃=CD, v₄=DE, v₅=EF, v₆=FA.\n   - Equilateral condition: |v_i|=s for i=1,…,6.\n   - Opposite sides parallel (and equal length) ⇒ v₄=–v₁, v₅=–v₂, v₆=–v₃.\n   - Hexagon closure ⇒ v₁+v₂+v₃+v₄+v₅+v₆=0, which is automatically satisfied if v₄=–v₁, v₅=–v₂, v₆=–v₃.\n\n2. Reduce free parameters to two angles:\n   - We need three independent vectors v₁,v₂,v₃ of length s in the plane. Up to rigid motions, we can fix v₁ along the positive x‐axis: v₁=(s,0).\n   - Parametrize v₂ by an angle θ measured CCW from v₁: v₂=(s cosθ, s sinθ).\n   - Parametrize v₃ by a second angle φ measured CCW from v₁: v₃=(s cosφ, s sinφ).\n\n3. Convexity constraints:\n   - The ordered turning angles at the vertices must be between 0 and π.  Since we go from v₁ to v₂ to v₃ in CCW order,\n     we require 0<θ<φ<π (so each turn is less than 180° in the positive sense) and φ−θ<π (so the interior at C is <180°).\n   - These inequalities ensure that all interior angles of the hexagon are <π and that the hexagon is convex.\n\n4. Determine the remaining vertices and sides:\n   - Then v₄=DE=–v₁=(–s,0), v₅=EF=–v₂=(–s cosθ, –s sinθ), v₆=FA=–v₃=(–s cosφ, –s sinφ).\n   - Choose A=(0,0), B=A+v₁, C=B+v₂, D=C+v₃, E=D+v₄, F=E+v₅, and verify F+v₆=A.\n\n5. Discussion of other cases:\n   - The only other “case” would be reflecting the entire figure (replacing all angles by their negatives), which yields the same shape up to reflection.\n   - Swapping the order of θ and φ or reversing orientation would violate 0<θ<φ<π or convexity, so the above is the unique (up to rigid motion and reflection) model that satisfies all conditions.\n\nThus we have a complete, detailed vector/coordinate model depending on s, θ, φ with the required parallelism and convexity.\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent Vuf1:\nPlace A at the origin and let AB lie along the positive x–axis.

Ensure 0<θ<φ<π and φ−θ<π. \n\n ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent Vuf1:\nWe need to describe an equilateral convex hexagon ABCDEF whose opposite sides are parallel, using a single side‐length s and two angle parameters θ, φ satisfying 0<θ<φ<π and φ−θ<π. Since it’s equilateral, all six edges have the same length s. Parallelism of opposite edges shows there are only three distinct edge directions, each repeated once in the opposite direction. We may take those three directions to be angles 0, θ, and φ (all measured from the positive x–axis). Then the six (directed) side‐vectors in cyclic order can be chosen as:  v₁=AB=s·(cos0, sin0)=s·(1,0)  v₂=BC=s·(cosθ, sinθ)  v₃=CD=s·(cosφ, sinφ)  v₄=DE=−v₁= s·(−1,0)  v₅=EF=−v₂= s·(−cosθ, −sinθ)  v₆=FA=−v₃= s·(−cosφ, −sinφ)  Because v₄, v₅, v₆ are negatives of v₁, v₂, v₃, respectively, the closure condition v₁+⋯+v₆=0 holds automatically.  Convexity and correct cyclic ordering require that the turn from direction 0 to θ to φ to 0+π to θ+π to φ+π is strictly increasing in argument around the circle without reversing; this is guaranteed by 0<θ<φ<π and φ−θ<π.  No other case arises, since any re‐labeling or reflection of the three base directions yields an equivalent pattern up to rigid motion or relabeling of vertices.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent J05i:\nWe need to parameterize a convex equilateral hexagon ABCDEF with side length s, and opposite sides parallel: AB∥DE, BC∥EF, CD∥FA.

Reviewing the three chain‐of‐thought proposals, they all converge on the same vector‐model: fix v₁ along the x‐axis, let v₂ and v₃ be at angles θ and φ, and take v₄, v₅, v₆ as their negatives to enforce opposite‐side parallelism and automatic closure. This model is minimal (one length parameter, two angles), fully specifies all vertices, and its convexity follows exactly from the stated inequalities. Other proposed variations (reflections or different sign‐choices) either violate convexity or are equivalent up to rigid motion. Thus the most consistent, simplest, and fully justified model is: place A at (0,0); define the directed side‐vectors v₁,…,v₆ of length s by angles 0, θ, φ, π, θ+π, φ+π; and build the vertices by successive addition.

Ensure 0<θ<φ<π and φ−θ<π. \n\n ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent Vuf1:\nWe need to describe an equilateral convex hexagon ABCDEF whose opposite sides are parallel, using a single side‐length s and two angle parameters θ, φ satisfying 0<θ<φ<π and φ−θ<π. Since it’s equilateral, all six edges have the same length s. Parallelism of opposite edges shows there are only three distinct edge directions, each repeated once in the opposite direction. We may take those three directions to be angles 0, θ, and φ (all measured from the positive x–axis). Then the six (directed) side‐vectors in cyclic order can be chosen as:  v₁=AB=s·(cos0, sin0)=s·(1,0)  v₂=BC=s·(cosθ, sinθ)  v₃=CD=s·(cosφ, sinφ)  v₄=DE=−v₁= s·(−1,0)  v₅=EF=−v₂= s·(−cosθ, −sinθ)  v₆=FA=−v₃= s·(−cosφ, −sinφ)  Because v₄, v₅, v₆ are negatives of v₁, v₂, v₃, respectively, the closure condition v₁+⋯+v₆=0 holds automatically.  Convexity and correct cyclic ordering require that the turn from direction 0 to θ to φ to 0+π to θ+π to φ+π is strictly increasing in argument around the circle without reversing; this is guaranteed by 0<θ<φ<π and φ−θ<π.  No other case arises, since any re‐labeling or reflection of the three base directions yields an equivalent pattern up to rigid motion or relabeling of vertices.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent J05i:\nWe need to parameterize a convex equilateral hexagon ABCDEF with side length s, and opposite sides parallel: AB∥DE, BC∥EF, CD∥FA. We introduce two angles θ,φ and derive vertex coordinates in the plane.\n\n1. Choice of origin and initial direction:\n   - Place A at the origin: A=(0,0).\n   - Since AB∥DE and AB is one of our reference directions, we take AB to lie along the positive x–axis.  Thus B=A+s(1,0)=(s,0).\n\n2. Introduce angles θ,φ for the next two sides:\n   - Let BC make an angle θ with the positive x–axis: C=B+s(cosθ,sinθ).\n   - Let CD make an angle φ with the positive x–axis: D=C+s(cosφ,sinφ).\n   - Impose 0<θ<φ<π to keep turns in the same (counterclockwise) sense, and φ−θ<π to avoid a reflex turn that would break convexity.\n\n3. Parallelism of opposite sides gives the remaining directions up to a sign:\n   - DE∥AB ⇒ DE must be horizontal.  To keep the polygon turning left (counterclockwise), DE points left: angle=π.  Thus E=D+s(cosπ,sinπ)=D+s(−1,0).\n   - EF∥BC ⇒ EF has the same slope as BC but pointing opposite to continue the boundary: EF has angle θ+π.  So F=E+s(cos(θ+π),sin(θ+π))=E+s(−cosθ,−sinθ).\n   - FA∥CD ⇒ FA has the same slope as CD but again continuing the loop: angle φ+π.  The closing condition F+s(cos(φ+π),sin(φ+π)) must return to A=(0,0).  Indeed \n     F+s(−cosφ,−sinφ)=A is automatically satisfied by the previous sums of vectors cancelling in pairs.\n\n4. Convexity check and uniqueness:\n   - The sequence of edge directions is 0,θ,φ,π,θ+π,φ+π.  Since 0<θ<φ<π and φ−θ<π, these angles increase monotonically (mod 2π) and span less than one full rotation before closing, yielding a strictly convex hexagon.\n\n5. Other sign‐choices (for example taking DE to point right) would violate convexity or reverse orientation.  Thus this is the unique convex orientation satisfying the given parallelism and equilaterality.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent Xpi6:\nWe are asked to give a coordinate or vector model for a convex equilateral hexagon ABCDEF of side length s, with opposite sides parallel: AB ∥ DE, BC ∥ EF, CD ∥ FA, and to introduce two angle parameters θ, φ satisfying 0<θ<φ<π and φ−θ<π. We must justify every step and discuss all possible cases.\n\n1. Vector approach to opposite‐side parallelism and equal length:\n   - Label the side vectors in order around the hexagon as v₁=AB, v₂=BC, v₃=CD, v₄=DE, v₅=EF, v₆=FA.\n   - Equilateral condition: |v_i|=s for i=1,…,6.\n   - Opposite sides parallel (and equal length) ⇒ v₄=–v₁, v₅=–v₂, v₆=–v₃.\n   - Hexagon closure ⇒ v₁+v₂+v₃+v₄+v₅+v₆=0, which is automatically satisfied if v₄=–v₁, v₅=–v₂, v₆=–v₃.\n\n2. Reduce free parameters to two angles:\n   - We need three independent vectors v₁,v₂,v₃ of length s in the plane. Up to rigid motions, we can fix v₁ along the positive x‐axis: v₁=(s,0).\n   - Parametrize v₂ by an angle θ measured CCW from v₁: v₂=(s cosθ, s sinθ).\n   - Parametrize v₃ by a second angle φ measured CCW from v₁: v₃=(s cosφ, s sinφ).\n\n3. Convexity constraints:\n   - The ordered turning angles at the vertices must be between 0 and π.  Since we go from v₁ to v₂ to v₃ in CCW order,\n     we require 0<θ<φ<π (so each turn is less than 180° in the positive sense) and φ−θ<π (so the interior at C is <180°).\n   - These inequalities ensure that all interior angles of the hexagon are <π and that the hexagon is convex.\n\n4. Determine the remaining vertices and sides:\n   - Then v₄=DE=–v₁=(–s,0), v₅=EF=–v₂=(–s cosθ, –s sinθ), v₆=FA=–v₃=(–s cosφ, –s sinφ).\n   - Choose A=(0,0), B=A+v₁, C=B+v₂, D=C+v₃, E=D+v₄, F=E+v₅, and verify F+v₆=A.\n\n5. Discussion of other cases:\n   - The only other “case” would be reflecting the entire figure (replacing all angles by their negatives), which yields the same shape up to reflection.\n   - Swapping the order of θ and φ or reversing orientation would violate 0<θ<φ<π or convexity, so the above is the unique (up to rigid motion and reflection) model that satisfies all conditions.\n\nThus we have a complete, detailed vector/coordinate model depending on s, θ, φ with the required parallelism and convexity.\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent Vuf1:\nPlace A at the origin and let AB lie along the positive x–axis.

Ensure 0<θ<φ<π and φ−θ<π. \n\n ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent Vuf1:\nWe need to describe an equilateral convex hexagon ABCDEF whose opposite sides are parallel, using a single side‐length s and two angle parameters θ, φ satisfying 0<θ<φ<π and φ−θ<π. Since it’s equilateral, all six edges have the same length s. Parallelism of opposite edges shows there are only three distinct edge directions, each repeated once in the opposite direction. We may take those three directions to be angles 0, θ, and φ (all measured from the positive x–axis). Then the six (directed) side‐vectors in cyclic order can be chosen as:  v₁=AB=s·(cos0, sin0)=s·(1,0)  v₂=BC=s·(cosθ, sinθ)  v₃=CD=s·(cosφ, sinφ)  v₄=DE=−v₁= s·(−1,0)  v₅=EF=−v₂= s·(−cosθ, −sinθ)  v₆=FA=−v₃= s·(−cosφ, −sinφ)  Because v₄, v₅, v₆ are negatives of v₁, v₂, v₃, respectively, the closure condition v₁+⋯+v₆=0 holds automatically.  Convexity and correct cyclic ordering require that the turn from direction 0 to θ to φ to 0+π to θ+π to φ+π is strictly increasing in argument around the circle without reversing; this is guaranteed by 0<θ<φ<π and φ−θ<π.  No other case arises, since any re‐labeling or reflection of the three base directions yields an equivalent pattern up to rigid motion or relabeling of vertices.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent J05i:\nWe need to parameterize a convex equilateral hexagon ABCDEF with side length s, and opposite sides parallel: AB∥DE, BC∥EF, CD∥FA. We introduce two angles θ,φ and derive vertex coordinates in the plane.\n\n1. Choice of origin and initial direction:\n   - Place A at the origin: A=(0,0).\n   - Since AB∥DE and AB is one of our reference directions, we take AB to lie along the positive x–axis.  Thus B=A+s(1,0)=(s,0).\n\n2. Introduce angles θ,φ for the next two sides:\n   - Let BC make an angle θ with the positive x–axis: C=B+s(cosθ,sinθ).\n   - Let CD make an angle φ with the positive x–axis: D=C+s(cosφ,sinφ).\n   - Impose 0<θ<φ<π to keep turns in the same (counterclockwise) sense, and φ−θ<π to avoid a reflex turn that would break convexity.\n\n3. Parallelism of opposite sides gives the remaining directions up to a sign:\n   - DE∥AB ⇒ DE must be horizontal.  To keep the polygon turning left (counterclockwise), DE points left: angle=π.  Thus E=D+s(cosπ,sinπ)=D+s(−1,0).\n   - EF∥BC ⇒ EF has the same slope as BC but pointing opposite to continue the boundary: EF has angle θ+π.  So F=E+s(cos(θ+π),sin(θ+π))=E+s(−cosθ,−sinθ).\n   - FA∥CD ⇒ FA has the same slope as CD but again continuing the loop: angle φ+π.  The closing condition F+s(cos(φ+π),sin(φ+π)) must return to A=(0,0).  Indeed \n     F+s(−cosφ,−sinφ)=A is automatically satisfied by the previous sums of vectors cancelling in pairs.\n\n4. Convexity check and uniqueness:\n   - The sequence of edge directions is 0,θ,φ,π,θ+π,φ+π.  Since 0<θ<φ<π and φ−θ<π, these angles increase monotonically (mod 2π) and span less than one full rotation before closing, yielding a strictly convex hexagon.\n\n5.

Given all the above thinking and answers, find the most consistent and correct modeling of the convex equilateral hexagon with parameters s, θ, φ. \n\n ### thinking by Final Decision Agent gY1A:\nWe are asked to choose a single, coherent parametrization of a convex equilateral hexagon ABCDEF with side length s and opposite sides parallel, using two angle‐parameters θ,φ satisfying 0<θ<φ<π and φ−θ<π. Reviewing the three chain‐of‐thought proposals, they all converge on the same vector‐model: fix v₁ along the x‐axis, let v₂ and v₃ be at angles θ and φ, and take v₄, v₅, v₆ as their negatives to enforce opposite‐side parallelism and automatic closure. This model is minimal (one length parameter, two angles), fully specifies all vertices, and its convexity follows exactly from the stated inequalities. Other proposed variations (reflections or different sign‐choices) either violate convexity or are equivalent up to rigid motion. Thus the most consistent, simplest, and fully justified model is: place A at (0,0); define the directed side‐vectors v₁,…,v₆ of length s by angles 0, θ, φ, π, θ+π, φ+π; and build the vertices by successive addition. The convexity, equilaterality, parallel‐oppose, and closure are immediate.\n\n### answer by Final Decision Agent gY1A:\nPlace A at the origin and let all sides have length s. Introduce angles 0<θ<φ<π with φ−θ<π.  Define the side‐vectors in order around the hexagon by\n  AB = v₁ = ( s,  0 )            (angle = 0)\n  BC = v₂ = ( s\u2009cosθ,  s\u2009sinθ )  (angle = θ)\n  CD = v₃ = ( s\u2009cosφ,  s\u2009sinφ )  (angle = φ)\n  DE = v₄ = −v₁ = (−s,  0 )     (angle = π)\n  EF = v₅ = −v₂ = (−s\u2009cosθ, −s\u2009sinθ) (angle = θ+π)\n  FA = v₆ = −v₃ = (−s\u2009cosφ, −s\u2009sinφ) (angle = φ+π)\n\nThen set\n  A = (0,0)\n  B = A + v₁\n  C = B + v₂\n  D = C + v₃\n  E = D + v₄\n  F = E + v₅\n\nOne checks F + v₆ = A, so the hexagon closes.  Each |vᵢ|=s, and opposite sides are parallel by v₄=−v₁, v₅=−v₂, v₆=−v₃.  The inequalities 0<θ<φ<π and φ−θ<π guarantee that the turning angles at each vertex lie strictly between 0 and π, so ABCDEF is convex.\n\n### Sub-task 2.1: Choose a convenient coordinate system: place A at the origin, AB along the x-axis, and express successive vertices B, C, D, E, F in terms of s, θ, and φ.

Please think carefully and provide an updated answer. \n\n ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent SDmH:\nWe need a concrete, minimal parametrization of the convex equilateral hexagon ABCDEF with side length s and opposite sides parallel.  A standard choice is: place A at the origin and AB along the positive x-axis.  Then all side-vectors have length s and come in parallel, opposite pairs.  Introduce two angles 0<θ<φ<π with φ−θ<π to guarantee all interior angles lie in (0,π) and hence convexity.  Define the first three directed edges by angles 0, θ, φ; the last three edges are their negatives to enforce parallelism and closure automatically.  This yields a full description of vertices in terms of s, θ, φ, and immediately gives the required unit direction vectors.  No other sign choices or reflected models are needed, since this one covers the convex case uniquely up to rigid motion.\n\n### answer #1 by Debate Agent SDmH:\nPlace A at (0,0).
