============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
   • Torus T: generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 about an axis in the circle’s plane, at distance 6 from the circle’s center.  
   • Sphere S: radius 11.  
   • Two external tangency configurations:  
     – When T “rests” on the outside of S in one orientation, they are tangent along a circle of radius r_i.  
     – In another external orientation, they are tangent along a circle of radius r_o.  
   • The problem asks (but we do not solve here) about the difference r_i – r_o expressed as an irreducible fraction m/n, then m+n.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
   • Geometric constraint: external tangency between a toroidal surface and a sphere occurs along a circle where their normal distances coincide.  
   • The distance between the torus’ central axis and the sphere’s center changes with orientation, leading to two distinct tangency circles.  
   • Variables involved:  
     – Fixed torus parameters (major radius 6, minor radius 3).  
     – Sphere radius 11.  
     – Center‐to‐center distance in each resting position, determining the tangency circle’s radius.  
   • Significance of tangency: ensures that locally at each tangency circle, the torus and sphere share a common tangent plane.  
   • Hypothesis: computing r_i and r_o will require setting up distance equations in 3D (e.g., using Pythagorean relations in cross‐sectional plane) and solving for the circle of intersection radius.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
   • Primary domain: classical geometry of surfaces of revolution (3D geometry).  
   • Subfields: analytic geometry (equations of sphere and torus), maybe optimization if one considers minimal distances.  
   • Related contexts: problems on geometry‐model contests, physics of rolling bodies, computer graphics for collision detection.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
   • The phrase “when T rests on the outside of S” appears twice—are these two distinct orientations or a typo?  
   • How exactly is the torus positioned in each case—i.e., which part of the torus touches the sphere first (inner tube vs. outer tube)?  
   • Orientation of the circle of tangency: is it assumed horizontal, vertical, or determined by symmetry?  
   • Potential challenge: setting up a coordinate system to capture both configurations unambiguously without overcomplicating the algebra.

By symmetry the circle of tangency lies in a horizontal plane z=const, so every tangency point has ρ=√(x²+y²)=r and z-coördinate some z₀.  These must satisfy both surface equations:\n\n  Torus:  (ρ–R)² + z₀² = a²  ⇒  (r–6)² + z₀² = 9,    (1)\n  Sphere:  ρ² + (z₀–D)² = b² ⇒   r² + (z₀–D)² =121.     (2)\n\nFrom (1) we get\n    z₀² = 9 – (r–6)².                                      (3)\nFrom (2) we write\n    (z₀–D)² = 121 – r²    ⇒   z₀ = D ± √(121 – r²).

A more direct route is to eliminate z₀ by subtracting (1) from (2):\n\n  (r² + (z₀–D)²) – ((r–6)² + z₀²) = 121–9 =112\n⇒ r² + z₀² –2Dz₀ + D² – r² +12r –36 – z₀² =112\n⇒ 12r –2D z₀ + D² –36 =112\n⇒ 2D z₀ = 12r + D² –148\n⇒ z₀ = (12r + D² –148)/(2D).

Given solutions from other agents, consider their opinions as additional advice. Please think carefully and provide an updated answer. \n\n ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent YGJA:\nWe place the sphere of radius 11 at the origin and translate the standard torus (major radius 6, minor radius 3) along the z–axis by distance D.  In cylindrical coordinates (ρ,θ,z) the torus equation becomes\n   F(ρ,z)= (ρ−6)^2 + (z−D)^2 −9 =0,\nand the sphere is\n   G(ρ,z)= ρ^2 + z^2 −121 =0.\nAt a circle of tangency the two surfaces not only meet (F=G=0) but also have proportional normals ∇F∥∇G.  Writing ∇F=(2(ρ−6)(ρ⁻¹·ρ_vec),\u20092(z−D)) and ∇G=(2ρ_vec,\u20092z), colinearity in the ρ–z plane gives\ndef λ= (ρ−6)/ρ so that z−D = λ·z ⇒ z= D·ρ/6.\n\nSubstitute into G=0:  ρ^2 + (D·ρ/6)^2 =121 ⇒ ρ^2(1 + D^2/36)=121 ⇒ ρ^2=4356/(D^2+36).\n\nHence the radius of the circle of tangency is\n   r(D)=ρ= 66/√(D^2+36).\n\n(Note that enforcing also F=0 then forces D to be one of the two special values 2√7 or 4√10, yielding the inner/outer tangency circles.)\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent ExD3:\nWe place the torus center at the origin and its axis along the z–axis.  The torus has major radius R=6 and minor radius r₀=3, so its equation in cylindrical coords (ρ,φ,z) is\n   (ρ−6)² + z² = 3².  A sphere of radius 11 has center on the z–axis at (0,0,D) and equation\n   ρ² + (z−D)² = 11².\n\nA point of tangency lies on both surfaces, so its (ρ,z) satisfy\n  (1)  (ρ−6)² + z² = 9,\n  (2)  ρ² + (z−D)² = 121.\n\nFurthermore at a true tangency their normals are parallel.  In cylindrical form the gradient of the torus surface F_T(ρ,z)=(ρ−6)²+z²−9 is\n   ∇F_T = (2(ρ−6), 2z)\n(and in Cartesian the x,y components simply scale by x/ρ,y/ρ).  The gradient of the sphere F_S(x,y,z)=x²+y²+(z−D)²−121 is\n   ∇F_S = (2x,2y,2(z−D)) ⇒ in (ρ,z)‐projection (up to the same x/ρ,y/ρ factors) is (2ρ,2(z−D)).\n\nNormal‐parallel ⇒ there is μ so that\n   (2ρ, 2(z−D)) = μ·(2(ρ−6),2z)\n⇒\n   ρ = μ(ρ−6),\n   z−D = μ z.\nFrom the first μ = ρ/(ρ−6).  From the second\n   z−D = (ρ/(ρ−6)) z  ⇒  (z−D)(ρ−6) = ρ z\n                 ⇒  ρz −6z −Dρ +6D = ρz\n                 ⇒ 6z = 6D −Dρ\n                 ⇒ z = D(1 − ρ/6).\n\nNow eliminate z between this and the intersection of (1),(2).  Subtract (2)−(1):\n   [ρ² + (z−D)²] − [(ρ−6)² + z²] = 121−9 =112\n⇒ ρ² + z² −2Dz +D² −ρ² +12ρ −36 −z² =112\n⇒ 12ρ −2D z + D² −36 =112\n⇒ 6ρ −D z = (112 +36 −D²)/2 = (148 −D²)/2.\n\nSubstitute z = D(1−ρ/6):\n   6ρ − D·D(1−ρ/6) = (148−D²)/2\n⇒ 6ρ −D² + (D²ρ)/6 = (148−D²)/2.\nMultiply by 6:\n   36ρ −6D² + D²ρ = 3(148−D²) = 444 −3D²\n⇒ ρ(36 + D²) = 444 +3D²\n⇒ ρ = r(D) = (3D² +444)/(D² +36)\n⇒ r(D) = 3·(D² +148)/(D² +36).\n\nThis single‐branch formula indeed gives the unique circle of external tangency (ρ≤9) for all D≥2√5 (so that ρ≤9).\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent 4rYc:\nWe seek the radius r of the circle along which a torus of major radius R=6 and minor radius a=3 is tangent to a sphere of radius S=11 whose center lies at distance D from the torus’s center.  By symmetry the circle of contact lies in the plane z=0 at x=c and has radius r=√(y²+z²)=|y|.  Points P=(c,y,0) on this circle satisfy two conditions:\n\n  1.  P lies on the torus:  (√(c²+y²)–R)²+0² = a².  Hence √(c²+r²)–6 = ±3, so √(c²+r²)=6±3 ≡ u₀.  Thus\n\n        c² + r² = u₀²,    where u₀ = 6 + 3 = 9  or  u₀ = 6 – 3 = 3.\n\n  2.  P lies on the sphere:  (c–D)² + y² + 0² = S² = 121.  Hence\n\n        (c–D)² + r² = 121.\n\nSubstitute r² = u₀²–c² into the sphere equation:\n\n    (c–D)² + (u₀²–c²) = 121\n    ⇔ c² – 2cD + D² + u₀² – c² = 121\n    ⇔ –2cD + D² + u₀² = 121\n    ⇔ c = (D² + u₀² – 121)/(2D).\n\nThen\n\n    r² = u₀² – c² = u₀² – [ (D² + u₀² – 121)/(2D) ]²\n         = [4D²u₀² – (D² + u₀² –121)²]/(4D²).\n\nThus there are two analytic branches corresponding to u₀=9 or u₀=3.  In summary,\n\n    r(D) = sqrt\\{ u₀² – \\bigl[(D² + u₀² –121)/(2D)\\bigr]² \\},  for u₀=9 or 3.\n\nThis yields the two possible contact‐circle radii as functions of D.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent z9Lj:\nWe want the radius r of the circle of intersection (tangency) between the torus and the sphere as a function of the distance D between their centers.  Place the torus center at the origin, with axis along the z–axis, major radius R and minor radius a.  Place the sphere center at (0,0,D) with radius b.  A point (x,y,z) on both surfaces satisfies:\n  1) Torus: (√(x²+y²) – R)² + z² = a².\n  2) Sphere: x²+y² + (z – D)² = b².\nLet ρ = √(x²+y²).  Then the torus gives\n  z² = a² – (ρ – R)².

Please think carefully and provide an updated answer. \n\n ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent YGJA:\nWe place the sphere of radius 11 at the origin and translate the standard torus (major radius 6, minor radius 3) along the z–axis by distance D.  In cylindrical coordinates (ρ,θ,z) the torus equation becomes\n   F(ρ,z)= (ρ−6)^2 + (z−D)^2 −9 =0,\nand the sphere is\n   G(ρ,z)= ρ^2 + z^2 −121 =0.\nAt a circle of tangency the two surfaces not only meet (F=G=0) but also have proportional normals ∇F∥∇G.  Writing ∇F=(2(ρ−6)(ρ⁻¹·ρ_vec),\u20092(z−D)) and ∇G=(2ρ_vec,\u20092z), colinearity in the ρ–z plane gives\ndef λ= (ρ−6)/ρ so that z−D = λ·z ⇒ z= D·ρ/6.\n\nSubstitute into G=0:  ρ^2 + (D·ρ/6)^2 =121 ⇒ ρ^2(1 + D^2/36)=121 ⇒ ρ^2=4356/(D^2+36).\n\nHence the radius of the circle of tangency is\n   r(D)=ρ= 66/√(D^2+36).\n\n(Note that enforcing also F=0 then forces D to be one of the two special values 2√7 or 4√10, yielding the inner/outer tangency circles.)\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent ExD3:\nWe place the torus center at the origin and its axis along the z–axis.  The torus has major radius R=6 and minor radius r₀=3, so its equation in cylindrical coords (ρ,φ,z) is\n   (ρ−6)² + z² = 3².  A sphere of radius 11 has center on the z–axis at (0,0,D) and equation\n   ρ² + (z−D)² = 11².\n\nA point of tangency lies on both surfaces, so its (ρ,z) satisfy\n  (1)  (ρ−6)² + z² = 9,\n  (2)  ρ² + (z−D)² = 121.\n\nFurthermore at a true tangency their normals are parallel.  In cylindrical form the gradient of the torus surface F_T(ρ,z)=(ρ−6)²+z²−9 is\n   ∇F_T = (2(ρ−6), 2z)\n(and in Cartesian the x,y components simply scale by x/ρ,y/ρ).  The gradient of the sphere F_S(x,y,z)=x²+y²+(z−D)²−121 is\n   ∇F_S = (2x,2y,2(z−D)) ⇒ in (ρ,z)‐projection (up to the same x/ρ,y/ρ factors) is (2ρ,2(z−D)).\n\nNormal‐parallel ⇒ there is μ so that\n   (2ρ, 2(z−D)) = μ·(2(ρ−6),2z)\n⇒\n   ρ = μ(ρ−6),\n   z−D = μ z.\nFrom the first μ = ρ/(ρ−6).  From the second\n   z−D = (ρ/(ρ−6)) z  ⇒  (z−D)(ρ−6) = ρ z\n                 ⇒  ρz −6z −Dρ +6D = ρz\n                 ⇒ 6z = 6D −Dρ\n                 ⇒ z = D(1 − ρ/6).\n\nNow eliminate z between this and the intersection of (1),(2).  Subtract (2)−(1):\n   [ρ² + (z−D)²] − [(ρ−6)² + z²] = 121−9 =112\n⇒ ρ² + z² −2Dz +D² −ρ² +12ρ −36 −z² =112\n⇒ 12ρ −2D z + D² −36 =112\n⇒ 6ρ −D z = (112 +36 −D²)/2 = (148 −D²)/2.\n\nSubstitute z = D(1−ρ/6):\n   6ρ − D·D(1−ρ/6) = (148−D²)/2\n⇒ 6ρ −D² + (D²ρ)/6 = (148−D²)/2.\nMultiply by 6:\n   36ρ −6D² + D²ρ = 3(148−D²) = 444 −3D²\n⇒ ρ(36 + D²) = 444 +3D²\n⇒ ρ = r(D) = (3D² +444)/(D² +36)\n⇒ r(D) = 3·(D² +148)/(D² +36).\n\nThis single‐branch formula indeed gives the unique circle of external tangency (ρ≤9) for all D≥2√5 (so that ρ≤9).\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent 4rYc:\nWe seek the radius r of the circle along which a torus of major radius R=6 and minor radius a=3 is tangent to a sphere of radius S=11 whose center lies at distance D from the torus’s center.  By symmetry the circle of contact lies in the plane z=0 at x=c and has radius r=√(y²+z²)=|y|.  Points P=(c,y,0) on this circle satisfy two conditions:\n\n  1.  P lies on the torus:  (√(c²+y²)–R)²+0² = a².  Hence √(c²+r²)–6 = ±3, so √(c²+r²)=6±3 ≡ u₀.  Thus\n\n        c² + r² = u₀²,    where u₀ = 6 + 3 = 9  or  u₀ = 6 – 3 = 3.\n\n  2.  P lies on the sphere:  (c–D)² + y² + 0² = S² = 121.  Hence\n\n        (c–D)² + r² = 121.\n\nSubstitute r² = u₀²–c² into the sphere equation:\n\n    (c–D)² + (u₀²–c²) = 121\n    ⇔ c² – 2cD + D² + u₀² – c² = 121\n    ⇔ –2cD + D² + u₀² = 121\n    ⇔ c = (D² + u₀² – 121)/(2D).\n\nThen\n\n    r² = u₀² – c² = u₀² – [ (D² + u₀² – 121)/(2D) ]²\n         = [4D²u₀² – (D² + u₀² –121)²]/(4D²).\n\nThus there are two analytic branches corresponding to u₀=9 or u₀=3.  In summary,\n\n    r(D) = sqrt\\{ u₀² – \\bigl[(D² + u₀² –121)/(2D)\\bigr]² \\},  for u₀=9 or 3.\n\nThis yields the two possible contact‐circle radii as functions of D.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent z9Lj:\nWe want the radius r of the circle of intersection (tangency) between the torus and the sphere as a function of the distance D between their centers.

By symmetry the circle of tangency lies in a horizontal plane z=const, so every tangency point has ρ=√(x²+y²)=r and z-coördinate some z₀.  These must satisfy both surface equations:\n\n  Torus:  (ρ–R)² + z₀² = a²  ⇒  (r–6)² + z₀² = 9,    (1)\n  Sphere:  ρ² + (z₀–D)² = b² ⇒   r² + (z₀–D)² =121.

A more direct route is to eliminate z₀ by subtracting (1) from (2):\n\n  (r² + (z₀–D)²) – ((r–6)² + z₀²) = 121–9 =112\n⇒ r² + z₀² –2Dz₀ + D² – r² +12r –36 – z₀² =112\n⇒ 12r –2D z₀ + D² –36 =112\n⇒ 2D z₀ = 12r + D² –148\n⇒ z₀ = (12r + D² –148)/(2D).

The torus has major radius R=6 and tube (minor) radius a=3.  There are two ways the sphere of radius b=11 can be externally tangent to the torus: at the torus’s outer equator (distance from torus center =R+a) or at its inner equator (distance =R−a).  In each case the single point of tangency must satisfy that its distance to the sphere center equals b.\n\n1. Outer‐equator tangency: occurs at a point distance R+a from the torus center in the horizontal plane.  Hence\n   √[(R+a)² + D_o²] = b,\n   (6+3)² + D_o² =11²  ⇒ 81 + D_o² =121  ⇒ D_o²=40  ⇒ D_o=√40=2√10.\n\n2. Inner‐equator tangency: occurs at distance R−a from the torus center.  Hence\n   √[(R−a)² + D_i²] = b,\n   (6−3)² + D_i² =11²  ⇒ 9 + D_i² =121  ⇒ D_i²=112 ⇒ D_i=√112=4√7.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent EOsn:\nWe want the two center‐to‐center distances D for which the sphere of radius b=11 and the torus (major radius R=6, minor radius a=3) are tangent along a single circle – i.e. the intersection of their surfaces degenerates from two distinct circles to one.  From Sub‐task 1 we have the general formula for the radius r of the tangency circle as a function of D:  \n\n  r(D)=\\frac{6\\bigl(121+36+D^2-9\\bigr)\\pm D\\sqrt{4\\cdot9\\,(36+D^2)-(9+36+D^2-121)^2}}{2(36+D^2)}.  \n\nExternal tangency at exactly one circle occurs when the expression under the square root vanishes.

Then u^2 –188u +4480=0.  Its discriminant is 188^2 –4·4480=35344–17920=17424=132^2.  Hence\n\n    u=\\frac{188±132}{2}=160 or 28,\n    so D=√u>0 gives\n\n    D_i=√160=4√10,    D_o=√28=2√7.\n\nThese are the two center‐to‐center distances for the inner‐ and outer‐surface tangencies.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent rqmR:\nWe seek D such that a torus of major radius R=6 and tube radius a=3, centered at the origin with axis along z, is externally tangent to a sphere of radius b=11 whose center is at (0,0,D). The condition is that the minimum distance from the sphere center to the torus surface equals b.\n\nParametrize the torus by (x,y,z)=((R+a\\cosφ)\\cosθ,(R+a\\cosφ)\\sinθ,a\\sinφ).

Thus in both cases\n  r = (6D^2 + 888) / (2D^2 + 72)\n     = (3D^2 + 444) / (D^2 + 36).\n\nFor D_i^2 = 28:\n  r_i = (3·28 + 444)/(28 + 36)\n      = (84 + 444)/64\n      = 528/64\n      = 33/4.\n\nFor D_o^2 = 160:\n  r_o = (3·160 + 444)/(160 + 36)\n      = (480 + 444)/196\n      = 924/196\n      = 33/7.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent Y5Hk:\nWe start with the analytic formula from Sub-task 1:\n r(D) = [6(D² + 148) ± D·√{36(D² + 36) − (D² − 76)²}] / [2(D² + 36)].\nFrom Sub-task 2 we have the two critical distances D_i = 2√7 and D_o = 4√10, at which the discriminant inside the square root vanishes:\n  Δ(D) = 36(D² + 36) − (D² − 76)² = −(D² − 28)(D² − 160).\nHence at D = D_i or D_o, Δ = 0 and the ± term drops out. Thus\n r(D) = 6(D² + 148) / [2(D² + 36)] = 3(D² + 148)/(D² + 36).\n1. For D_i = 2√7, D_i² = 28:\n   r_i = 3(28 + 148)/(28 + 36) = 3·176/64 = 528/64 = 33/4.\n2. For D_o = 4√10, D_o² = 160:\n   r_o = 3(160 + 148)/(160 + 36) = 3·308/196 = 924/196 = 33/7.\nTherefore the inner‐circle radius is 33/4 and the outer‐circle radius is 33/7.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent HqIz:\nWe start from the analytic formula for the tangency‐circle radius as a function of D (the sphere’s center offset):\n\n  r(D)\n    = [6(121 + 36 + D^2 – 9) ± D·√{4·9·(36 + D^2) − (9 + 36 + D^2 − 121)^2}] / [2(36 + D^2)].\n\n1. Simplify constants inside the bracket: 121 + 36 − 9 = 148, and under the radical we have\n   4·9·(36 + D^2) = 36(36 + D^2)\n   and (9 + 36 + D^2 − 121) = D^2 − 76.\n\n   Hence the formula becomes\n\n   r(D) = [6(D^2 + 148) ± D·√{36(D^2 + 36) − (D^2 − 76)^2}] / [2(D^2 + 36)].\n\n2.

Because Δ(D_i)=Δ(D_o)=0, the square‐root term vanishes for both, so the “±” makes no difference and we get\n\n   r(D) = 6(D^2 + 148) / [2(D^2 + 36)]\n         = 3(D^2 + 148) / (D^2 + 36).\n\n4.

(4)\n\nSubstitute (4) into (3):\n    [D ± √(121–r²)]² = 9 – (r–6)².\nExpand and rearrange to isolate the square root, then square again.  A more direct route is to eliminate z₀ by subtracting (1) from (2):\n\n  (r² + (z₀–D)²) – ((r–6)² + z₀²) = 121–9 =112\n⇒ r² + z₀² –2Dz₀ + D² – r² +12r –36 – z₀² =112\n⇒ 12r –2D z₀ + D² –36 =112\n⇒ 2D z₀ = 12r + D² –148\n⇒ z₀ = (12r + D² –148)/(2D).                                 (5)\n\nNow substitute (5) into (1) or equivalently into z₀² = 9 – (r–6)² to obtain a single quadratic in r.  The result factors into two solutions corresponding to the “inner” and “outer” circles of tangency.  Equivalently one can solve for r explicitly to get the following closed‐form:\n\n   r(D) = [ R( b² + R² + D² – a² )  ±  D·√{ 4a²( R² + D² )  –  ( a² + R² + D² – b² )² } ]\n                                / [ 2( R² + D² ) ]\n\nwhere R=6, a=3, b=11.  Plugging in these values gives the final analytic expression\n\n   r(D) = [6(121 + 36 + D² –9)  ±  D·√{4·9·(36 + D²)  –  (9 +36 + D² –121)²}]\n                                    /[2(36 + D²)]\n\nThis single formula, with the choice of “+” or “–”, describes both the outer (larger‐radius) and inner (smaller‐radius) tangency circles as functions of the center‐separation D.\n\n### answer by Final Decision Agent DkFK:\nr(D) = [6(121 + 36 + D^2 – 9) ± D · sqrt{ 4·9·(36 + D^2) – (9 + 36 + D^2 – 121)^2 }] / [2(36 + D^2)],\nwith the “+” or “–” giving the two possible (outer and inner) tangency‐circle radii.\n\n### Sub-task 2: Synthesize and choose the most consistent solutions for D_i and D_o. \n\n ### thinking by Final Decision Agent pVWI:\nWe start from the condition that external tangency along a circle occurs exactly when the discriminant in the formula for r(D) vanishes: Δ(D)=4a^2(R^2+D^2)−(a^2+R^2+D^2−b^2)^2=0, with R=6, a=3, b=11.  Substituting gives D^4−188D^2+4480=0 ⇒ letting u=D^2, u^2−188u+4480=0.  Its solutions are u=28 or 160, so D=√28=2√7 or D=√160=4√10.  To decide which root is D_i (inner‐equator contact) and which is D_o (outer‐equator contact), we compare the sphere’s top height z_top=−D+b to the torus’s inner‐equator plane at z=0.  For D=2√7≈5.29, z_top≈5.71>0 so the sphere rises above the equatorial plane and contacts the torus’s inner tube—hence D_i=2√7.  For D=4√10≈12.65, z_top≈−1.65<0 so the sphere remains below z=0 and touches the outer bulge—hence D_o=4√10.\n\n### answer by Final Decision Agent pVWI:\nD_i = 2√7, D_o = 4√10\n\n### Sub-task 3: Synthesize and choose the most consistent values for r_i and r_o. \n\n ### thinking by Final Decision Agent r8GE:\n1. From Sub-task 1 we have the general tangency‐circle radius formula:\n   r(D) = [6(D² + 148) ± D·√{36(D² + 36) − (D² − 76)²}] / [2(D² + 36)].\n2. Sub-task 2 gives the two sphere‐center distances at which external tangency occurs:\n   D_i = 2√7  (inner tube contact),\n   D_o = 4√10 (outer bulge contact).\n3. At both D_i and D_o the discriminant under the square root vanishes:\n   Δ(D) = 36(D² + 36) − (D² − 76)² = 0.  Hence the “±” term is zero and the formula simplifies to\n   r(D) = 6(D² + 148) / [2(D² + 36)]\n         = 3(D² + 148) / (D² + 36).\n4. Compute r_i by substituting D_i² = (2√7)² = 28:\n   r_i = 3(28 + 148) / (28 + 36)\n       = 3·176 / 64\n       = 528 / 64\n       = 33/4.\n5. Compute r_o by substituting D_o² = (4√10)² = 160:\n   r_o = 3(160 + 148) / (160 + 36)\n       = 3·308 / 196\n       = 924 / 196\n       = 33/7.\nThus the inner‐tangency circle radius is 33/4 and the outer‐tangency circle radius is 33/7.\n\n### answer by Final Decision Agent r8GE:\nr_i = 33/4, r_o = 33/7\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Calculate the difference r_i minus r_o, express it as a reduced fraction m/n, and determine m+n. \n\n then justify completely and detailedly, step-by-step why you think so in the "thinking" entry. \n                Consider all cases that are possible to happen.\n                Avoid some unclear explainations, such as "Using the circle equation or the condition for four points to be concyclic, we derive an equation in x.

However, there was inconsistency and confusion about which root corresponds to the inner tangency (r_i) and which corresponds to the outer tangency (r_o). Some agents assigned D_i = 4√7 and D_o = 2√10, while others reversed this to D_i = 2√7 and D_o = 4√10. The final accepted answer used D_i = 2√7 and D_o = 4√10, justified by comparing the sphere\'s top height relative to the torus\'s inner equator plane. However, this assignment contradicts the geometric intuition that the larger distance corresponds to the inner tangency (since the inner tube is closer to the axis) and the smaller distance to the outer tangency. This mismatch propagated into Sub-task 3 and Sub-task 4, where the radii r_i and r_o were computed and then their difference taken.

This ambiguity contributed to confusion in assigning which radius corresponds to inner or outer tangency.\n\nThe error originated in Sub-task 2\'s reasoning and was not corrected or clarified in subsequent subtasks. The context provided was sufficient to resolve this ambiguity (e.g., by analyzing the vertical positions of the sphere and torus), but agents did not consistently apply or communicate this reasoning. The final numeric calculations in Sub-task 3 and 4 were mathematically correct given the inputs, but the inputs themselves were mislabeled, causing the final answer to be wrong relative to the problem\'s intended definitions.\n\nIn summary, the root cause is the inconsistent and incorrect assignment of D_i and D_o to inner and outer tangency configurations, which led to swapping r_i and r_o and thus an incorrect difference calculation.', 'suggestion': '1. Improve instructions and context in Sub-task 2 to explicitly require agents to justify and confirm the geometric meaning of D_i and D_o, including which corresponds to inner and outer tangency. This should include analyzing the vertical positions of the sphere relative to the torus and clarifying the problem\'s terminology about "inner" and "outer" tangency.\n\n2. Change the collaboration pattern in Sub-task 2 from SC_CoT (self-consistent chain-of-thought) to a Debate or Reflexion pattern, where agents explicitly discuss and resolve the ambiguity in labeling D_i and D_o before passing results downstream. This will reduce inconsistent assignments.\n\n3. Add explicit context passing from Sub-task 2 to Sub-task 3 that includes the geometric justification for the labeling of D_i and D_o, so that Sub-task 3 can verify and confirm the assignments before computing radii.\n\nBy focusing on clarifying and confirming the physical meaning of the two distances and their corresponding radii early in the workflow, the downstream subtasks will use consistent inputs, preventing the final answer from being incorrect due to swapped labels.'}}]

============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
   - Torus T: generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 about an axis in its plane, with the axis a distance 6 from the circle’s center. Thus T has major radius R = 6 and minor radius r = 3.
   - Sphere S: centered somewhere, with radius 11.
   - Two configurations of external tangency: when T "rests on the outside" of S in one orientation, they touch along a circle of radius r_i; in a second orientation (flipped over), they touch along a different circle of radius r_o.
   - It is given that r_i − r_o = m/n in lowest terms, and the final goal is to find m + n.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
   - The distance between centers of S and of the generating circle of T depends on whether the torus contacts S on its inner tube surface (minor radius inward) or its outer tube surface (minor radius outward). These distances will be 11 + 3 (outer contact) or |11 − 3| (inner contact).
   - In each orientation, the circle of contact lies in a plane perpendicular to the line of centers, and its radius can be found via a right‐triangle relation between the distance of centers, the torus major radius (6), and the radius of the contact circle.
   - The constraints “externally tangent” enforce that the normal distance between surfaces equals the sum of radii at the contact point.
   - Changing from one orientation to the other effectively replaces one sign in the center‐to‐center distance (±3), hence giving two different contact‐circle radii r_i and r_o.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
   - Primary domain: 3D Euclidean geometry (solid geometry of surfaces).
   - Subtopics: toroidal and spherical surfaces, external tangency, circle‐of‐intersection computations.
   - Potential contexts: advanced geometry problems in mathematical competitions, CAD/solid modeling in engineering, theoretical studies of contact loci between curved surfaces.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
   - The phrase “when T rests on the outside of S” appears twice; it should distinguish between the torus’ inner‐tube contact and outer‐tube contact configurations.
   - Implicit assumption: the centers of the torus and sphere lie on a common vertical line when “resting,” but this orientation should be stated explicitly.
   - No coordinate system is specified; one must choose an axis for computing the circle radii.
   - It is not directly stated which of r_i or r_o corresponds to the larger or smaller contact circle, though the notation suggests r_i > r_o.

To find the two possible distances D between the sphere’s center O and the torus’s generating‐circle center C when they are externally tangent, consider a point P on the torus’s small circle (of radius r) that touches the sphere.  Since |OP|=S and |CP|=r, in the plane containing O, C, and P we have either\n  (1) (D + r)^2 = S^2    ⇒  D + r = S   ⇒  D = S − r  = 11 − 3 = 8,  or\n  (2) (D − r)^2 = S^2    ⇒  D − r = S   ⇒  D = S + r  = 11 + 3 = 14.\nThus the two center‐to‐center distances are D_outer = 8 and D_inner = 14.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent 713Y:\nWe want the vertical distance D between the sphere’s center and the torus’s center so that the generating circle of radius r (3) is tangent to the sphere of radius R_s (11).  Place the sphere center at (0,0) and the torus generating-circle center at (6,D) in the plane of centers (6 is the torus’s major radius).  \n\nCase 1 (outer tangency): the two circles are externally tangent, so\n  distance between centers = R_s + r = 11 + 3 =14.\nThus  sqrt(6^2 + D_outer^2) =14  =>  D_outer^2 =14^2 -6^2 =196 -36 =160  =>  D_outer = √160 =4√10.\n\nCase 2 (inner tangency): the generating circle touches the sphere on its inner side, so they are internally tangent:\n  distance between centers = |R_s - r| =11 -3 =8.\nThus  sqrt(6^2 + D_inner^2) =8  =>  D_inner^2 =8^2 -6^2 =64 -36 =28  =>  D_inner = √28 =2√7.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent jRRQ:\nWe set up the cross‐section in the plane through the torus axis and the sphere center.  Let O be the sphere center, L the torus axis, and d the distance OL.  A point P of tangency lies in this plane and satisfies: OP (distance to sphere center) = 11, and the distance from P to L equals the local tube‐radius of the torus, which is either R+r or R–r.\n\n1.

Please think carefully and provide an updated answer. \n\n ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent q5Iw:\nWe seek the radius of the circle along which a torus and a sphere touch tangentially.  Let a torus be generated by revolving a circle of (minor) radius r about the z–axis at distance R from that axis; let the center of that generating circle lie at height D above the sphere’s center (which we place at the origin).  A point on the torus can be parametrized by the “generating‐circle” angle α and the “revolution” angle β:  \n\n x = (R + r\u2009cos\u2009α)\u2009cos\u2009β,\n y = (R + r\u2009cos\u2009α)\u2009sin\u2009β,\n z = D + r\u2009sin\u2009α.\n\n The sphere’s equation is x² + y² + z² = S², but for tangency we need two conditions: (1) the distance from the sphere’s center to a point on the torus is stationary in α, and (2) that distance equals S.  \n\n 1.  Distance‐squared to the point is\n    F(α) = (R + r\u2009cos\u2009α)² + (D + r\u2009sin\u2009α)².\n\n 2.  Tangency (stationary distance) ⇒ dF/dα = 0.  Compute:\n    dF/dα = 2(R + r\u2009cos\u2009α)(−r\u2009sin\u2009α) + 2(D + r\u2009sin\u2009α)(r\u2009cos\u2009α).\n    Set = 0 ⇒ −(R + r\u2009cos\u2009α)\u2009sin\u2009α + (D + r\u2009sin\u2009α)\u2009cos\u2009α = 0.\n    The mixed r\u2009cos\u2009α\u2009sin\u2009α cancel, leaving\n      −R\u2009sin\u2009α + D\u2009cos\u2009α = 0   ⇒   tan\u2009α = D/R.\n    Hence  cos\u2009α = R/√(R² + D²),  sin\u2009α = D/√(R² + D²).\n\n 3.  The circle of contact is obtained by revolving that single generatrix point (α fixed) about β.  Its radius in the x–y plane is\n    r_contact = ρ = R + r\u2009cos\u2009α\n              = R + r * [R/√(R² + D²)]\n              = R + (r\u2009R) / √(R² + D²).\n\n Thus in general, for a torus of major radius R and minor radius r whose generating‐circle center lies a distance D from the sphere’s center, the contact circle has radius\n\n    r_contact = R + (r\u2009R) / √(R² + D²).\n\n(This formula then may be applied to the two tangency‐cases by substituting the corresponding D.)\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent AEuH:\nWe place the torus axis along the y-axis and work in the cross-sectional (x,y) plane.  The torus generating circle has center C = (R,0) + a vertical shift (0,D) = (R,D) and radius r.  The sphere centered at the origin has radius S.  Their point of tangency in the cross-section satisfies both circle equations\n  (1) x^2 + y^2 = S^2,\n  (2) (x â\x80\x93 R)^2 + (y â\x80\x93 D)^2 = r^2.\nSubtracting (2) from (1) gives the linear relation\n  Rx + D y = (S^2 â\x80\x93 r^2 + R^2 + D^2)/2.\nBut at tangency the center–center distance c satisfies c^2=R^2+D^2 and c=SÂ±r, so S^2â\x80\x93r^2+R^2+D^2=2Sc and the linear equation becomes\n  Rx + D y = S c.\nSubstitute y=(S c â\x80\x93 R x)/D into x^2+y^2=S^2, clear denominators and simplify; the discriminant vanishes (unique tangency) giving the double root\n  x = R S / c.\nSince the full ring of tangency in 3-D is obtained by rotating this point about the axis, its radius is exactly x.  Finally, c is just the center distance D (between the sphere center and the torus–circle center), so the general formula is\n  r_contact = R·S / D.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent mvJu:\nWe model the torus T by revolving the “minor‐circle” of radius r about the z–axis at distance R from that axis.  Place the sphere center at the origin O=(0,0,0), and the minor‐circle center at C=(R,0,D).  A point P on the torus satisfies (√(x²+z²)–R)²+(y–D)²=r²; the sphere satisfies x²+y²+z²=S².  At tangency the two tangent‐planes coincide along a circle.  That common tangent‐plane is perpendicular to the line OC.  Its unit normal is u=(R,D)/√(R²+D²).  The torus surface normal at a point P on the minor‐circle is parallel to the inward normal of that circle (lying in the plane y–D) rotated about the z–axis.  The only way this can line up with u is if P lies at the “top” or “bottom” of the minor‐circle in its own plane, so that the minor‐circle’s normal is colinear with OC.  At those two points (antipodal on the minor‐circle), the distance from the axis is ρ, where\n    ρ=R±r·(R/√(R²+D²))\nbut the actual circle of contact is the circle swept out by rotating those two points around the z–axis, so its radius is\n    r_contact = r·(R/√(R²+D²)).\nThus for any placement with center‐offset D, the common tangency circle has radius r_contact = r\u2009R/√(R²+D²).\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent IVer:\n1. Coordinate setup and definitions\n   • Place the sphere center at O=(0,0) and the torus generating‐circle center at C=(R,D) in the x–z plane, where x is the distance from the axis of revolution (the z-axis) and z is the vertical coordinate.\n   • The sphere (great circle in the x–z plane) has equation x²+z²=S², and the torus’s generating circle has equation (x–R)²+(z–D)²=r².\n\n2. Point of tangency P lies on the line OC\n   • For two circles tangent in the plane, the unique tangency point P lies on the line joining their centers.\n   • Let c=|OC|=√(R²+D²). The unit vector from O to C is u=(R/c,\u2009D/c).\n\n3. Coordinates of P\n   • Because P is on the sphere of radius S at tangency, P=O+S·u=(S·R/c,\u2009S·D/c).\n\n4. Contact circle radius\n   • Rotating the x–z cross–section about the z-axis yields a 3-D contact circle of radius |xₚ|. Hence\n     r_contact=|x-coordinate of P|=S·R/c= S·R/√(R²+D²).\n\n5. Eliminate S using the tangency condition\n   • At tangency the center distance c satisfies c=S±r (“+” for external, “–” for internal)\n     ⇒ S=c∓r=√(R²+D²)∓r.\n   • Substitute into r_contact:\n     r_contact=(R (√(R²+D²)∓r))/√(R²+D²)\n     which simplifies to\n     r_contact=R∓(r R)/√(R²+D²).\n\n6. Final general formula\n   • In summary, for a torus of major radius R and minor radius r whose generating‐circle center sits distance D from the sphere’s center, the contact circle radius is\n          r_contact = R ∓ (r\u2009R)/√(R² + D²)\n     with the upper sign (–) for external tangency and the lower sign (+) for internal tangency.\n\n### answer #1 by Debate Agent q5Iw:\nr_contact = R + \\frac{r\\,R}{\\sqrt{R^2 + D^2}}\n\n### answer #1 by Debate Agent AEuH:\nr_contact = R S / D\n\n### answer #1 by Debate Agent mvJu:\nr_contact = (r·R)/√(R² + D²)\n\n### answer #1 by Debate Agent IVer:\nr_contact = R ∓ \\frac{rR}{\\sqrt{R^2 + D^2}}\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 1.1: Given all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer. \n\n then justify completely and detailedly, step-by-step why you think so in the "thinking" entry. \n                Consider all cases that are possible to happen.\n                Avoid some unclear explainations, such as "Using the circle equation or the condition for four points to be concyclic, we derive an equation in x.

Tangency conditions\n   For two circles (sphere’s great circle of radius S and torus generating circle of radius r) to be tangent, their center-to-center distance must equal the sum or difference of their radii:\n   • Outer tangency (circles touch externally): c = S + r = 11 + 3 = 14.\n   • Inner tangency (one circle touches inside the other): c = |S – r| = 11 – 3 = 8.\n\n4. Solve for D in each case\n   Using c² = R² + D²:\n   a) Outer case: 14² = 6² + D_outer²  ⇒ 196 = 36 + D_outer²  ⇒ D_outer² = 160  ⇒ D_outer = √160 = 4√10.\n   b) Inner case: 8² = 6² + D_inner²   ⇒ 64  = 36 + D_inner²  ⇒ D_inner² = 28   ⇒ D_inner = √28 = 2√7.\n\nThus the two center-to-center vertical distances are D_outer = 4√10 and D_inner = 2√7.\n\n### answer by Final Decision Agent tgt2:\nD_outer = 4√10, D_inner = 2√7\n\n### Sub-task 1.1: Derive general formula for contact circle radius r_contact as function of major radius R and center distance D.Given solutions to the problem from other agents, consider their opinions as additional advice. Please think carefully and provide an updated answer. \n\n ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent q5Iw:\nWe seek the radius of the circle along which a torus and a sphere touch tangentially.  Let a torus be generated by revolving a circle of (minor) radius r about the z–axis at distance R from that axis; let the center of that generating circle lie at height D above the sphere’s center (which we place at the origin).  A point on the torus can be parametrized by the “generating‐circle” angle α and the “revolution” angle β:  \n\n x = (R + r\u2009cos\u2009α)\u2009cos\u2009β,\n y = (R + r\u2009cos\u2009α)\u2009sin\u2009β,\n z = D + r\u2009sin\u2009α.\n\n The sphere’s equation is x² + y² + z² = S², but for tangency we need two conditions: (1) the distance from the sphere’s center to a point on the torus is stationary in α, and (2) that distance equals S.  \n\n 1.  Distance‐squared to the point is\n    F(α) = (R + r\u2009cos\u2009α)² + (D + r\u2009sin\u2009α)².\n\n 2.  Tangency (stationary distance) ⇒ dF/dα = 0.  Compute:\n    dF/dα = 2(R + r\u2009cos\u2009α)(−r\u2009sin\u2009α) + 2(D + r\u2009sin\u2009α)(r\u2009cos\u2009α).\n    Set = 0 ⇒ −(R + r\u2009cos\u2009α)\u2009sin\u2009α + (D + r\u2009sin\u2009α)\u2009cos\u2009α = 0.\n    The mixed r\u2009cos\u2009α\u2009sin\u2009α cancel, leaving\n      −R\u2009sin\u2009α + D\u2009cos\u2009α = 0   ⇒   tan\u2009α = D/R.\n    Hence  cos\u2009α = R/√(R² + D²),  sin\u2009α = D/√(R² + D²).\n\n 3.  The circle of contact is obtained by revolving that single generatrix point (α fixed) about β.  Its radius in the x–y plane is\n    r_contact = ρ = R + r\u2009cos\u2009α\n              = R + r * [R/√(R² + D²)]\n              = R + (r\u2009R) / √(R² + D²).\n\n Thus in general, for a torus of major radius R and minor radius r whose generating‐circle center lies a distance D from the sphere’s center, the contact circle has radius\n\n    r_contact = R + (r\u2009R) / √(R² + D²).\n\n(This formula then may be applied to the two tangency‐cases by substituting the corresponding D.)\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent AEuH:\nWe place the torus axis along the y-axis and work in the cross-sectional (x,y) plane.  The torus generating circle has center C = (R,0) + a vertical shift (0,D) = (R,D) and radius r.  The sphere centered at the origin has radius S.  Their point of tangency in the cross-section satisfies both circle equations\n  (1) x^2 + y^2 = S^2,\n  (2) (x â\x80\x93 R)^2 + (y â\x80\x93 D)^2 = r^2.\nSubtracting (2) from (1) gives the linear relation\n  Rx + D y = (S^2 â\x80\x93 r^2 + R^2 + D^2)/2.\nBut at tangency the center–center distance c satisfies c^2=R^2+D^2 and c=SÂ±r, so S^2â\x80\x93r^2+R^2+D^2=2Sc and the linear equation becomes\n  Rx + D y = S c.\nSubstitute y=(S c â\x80\x93 R x)/D into x^2+y^2=S^2, clear denominators and simplify; the discriminant vanishes (unique tangency) giving the double root\n  x = R S / c.\nSince the full ring of tangency in 3-D is obtained by rotating this point about the axis, its radius is exactly x.  Finally, c is just the center distance D (between the sphere center and the torus–circle center), so the general formula is\n  r_contact = R·S / D.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent mvJu:\nWe model the torus T by revolving the “minor‐circle” of radius r about the z–axis at distance R from that axis.  Place the sphere center at the origin O=(0,0,0), and the minor‐circle center at C=(R,0,D).  A point P on the torus satisfies (√(x²+z²)–R)²+(y–D)²=r²; the sphere satisfies x²+y²+z²=S².  At tangency the two tangent‐planes coincide along a circle.  That common tangent‐plane is perpendicular to the line OC.  Its unit normal is u=(R,D)/√(R²+D²).  The torus surface normal at a point P on the minor‐circle is parallel to the inward normal of that circle (lying in the plane y–D) rotated about the z–axis.  The only way this can line up with u is if P lies at the “top” or “bottom” of the minor‐circle in its own plane, so that the minor‐circle’s normal is colinear with OC.  At those two points (antipodal on the minor‐circle), the distance from the axis is ρ, where\n    ρ=R±r·(R/√(R²+D²))\nbut the actual circle of contact is the circle swept out by rotating those two points around the z–axis, so its radius is\n    r_contact = r·(R/√(R²+D²)).\nThus for any placement with center‐offset D, the common tangency circle has radius r_contact = r\u2009R/√(R²+D²).\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent IVer:\n1. Coordinate setup and definitions\n   • Place the sphere center at O=(0,0) and the torus generating‐circle center at C=(R,D) in the x–z plane, where x is the distance from the axis of revolution (the z-axis) and z is the vertical coordinate.\n   • The sphere (great circle in the x–z plane) has equation x²+z²=S², and the torus’s generating circle has equation (x–R)²+(z–D)²=r².\n\n2. Point of tangency P lies on the line OC\n   • For two circles tangent in the plane, the unique tangency point P lies on the line joining their centers.\n   • Let c=|OC|=√(R²+D²). The unit vector from O to C is u=(R/c,\u2009D/c).\n\n3. Coordinates of P\n   • Because P is on the sphere of radius S at tangency, P=O+S·u=(S·R/c,\u2009S·D/c).\n\n4. Contact circle radius\n   • Rotating the x–z cross–section about the z-axis yields a 3-D contact circle of radius |xₚ|. Hence\n     r_contact=|x-coordinate of P|=S·R/c= S·R/√(R²+D²).\n\n5. Eliminate S using the tangency condition\n   • At tangency the center distance c satisfies c=S±r (“+” for external, “–” for internal)\n     ⇒ S=c∓r=√(R²+D²)∓r.\n   • Substitute into r_contact:\n     r_contact=(R (√(R²+D²)∓r))/√(R²+D²)\n     which simplifies to\n     r_contact=R∓(r R)/√(R²+D²).\n\n6. Final general formula\n   • In summary, for a torus of major radius R and minor radius r whose generating‐circle center sits distance D from the sphere’s center, the contact circle radius is\n          r_contact = R ∓ (r\u2009R)/√(R² + D²)\n     with the upper sign (–) for external tangency and the lower sign (+) for internal tangency.\n\n### answer #1 by Debate Agent q5Iw:\nr_contact = R + \\frac{r\\,R}{\\sqrt{R^2 + D^2}}\n\n### answer #1 by Debate Agent AEuH:\nr_contact = R S / D\n\n### answer #1 by Debate Agent mvJu:\nr_contact = (r·R)/√(R² + D²)\n\n### answer #1 by Debate Agent IVer:\nr_contact = R ∓ \\frac{rR}{\\sqrt{R^2 + D^2}}\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 1.1: Given all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer. \n\n then justify completely and detailedly, step-by-step why you think so in the "thinking" entry. \n                Consider all cases that are possible to happen.\n                Avoid some unclear explainations, such as "Using the circle equation or the condition for four points to be concyclic, we derive an equation in x.

Setting dF/dα = 0 gives \n   −(R + r\u2009cos\u2009α)\u2009r\u2009sin\u2009α + (D + r\u2009sin\u2009α)\u2009r\u2009cos\u2009α = 0 \n  ⇒  −R\u2009sin\u2009α + D\u2009cos\u2009α = 0  ⇒  tan\u2009α = D/R.  \nHence  cos\u2009α = R/√(R² + D²),  sin\u2009α = D/√(R² + D²).  \n\nThus at tangency the point’s radial coordinate is \n  ρ = x₀ = R + r\u2009cos\u2009α = R + r·(R/√(R² + D²)).  \nRotating this point about the z-axis sweeps out the contact circle of radius ρ.  \n\nTherefore the general formula for the torus–sphere contact circle (for either external or internal tangency, differing only in the value of D) is\n\n    r_contact = R + (r·R) / √(R² + D²)\n\n### answer by Final Decision Agent PEa3:\nr_contact = R + (r·R) / sqrt(R^2 + D^2)\n\n### Sub-task 1.2: Synthesize computed values of r_o and r_i. \n\n ### thinking by Final Decision Agent bun3:\nWe use the previously derived contact‐circle formula for a torus and a sphere: r_contact = R + (r·R)/√(R² + D²), where R = 6 and r = 3. There are two possible tangency cases—external and internal—corresponding to the two values of the vertical offset D between the sphere’s center and the torus generating‐circle center.  \n\nCase 1 (external tangency):\n• D_outer = 4√10 ⇒ D_outer² = 160.\n• Compute √(R² + D_outer²) = √(36 + 160) = √196 = 14.\n• Substitute into r_contact: r_o = 6 + (3·6)/14 = 6 + 18/14 = 6 + 9/7 = 51/7.\n\nCase 2 (internal tangency):\n• D_inner = 2√7 ⇒ D_inner² = 28.\n• Compute √(R² + D_inner²) = √(36 + 28) = √64 = 8.\n• Substitute into r_contact: r_i = 6 + (3·6)/8 = 6 + 18/8 = 6 + 9/4 = 33/4.\n\nThese are the only two tangency configurations, so the synthesized values are:\n\n### answer by Final Decision Agent bun3:\nr_o = 51/7, r_i = 33/4\n\n### Sub-task 1.3: Calculate difference r_i - r_o, reduce to lowest terms m/n, and compute m+n.Given previous attempts and feedback, carefully consider where you could go wrong in your latest attempt. Using insights from previous attempts, try to solve the task better. \n\n ### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent yEmJ (yourself):\nWe have from sub-task 1.2 that r_i = 33/4 and r_o = 51/7.\n\n1. Compute difference:\n   r_i – r_o = 33/4 – 51/7.\n2. Find common denominator 28:\n   33/4 = (33×7)/28 = 231/28,\n   51/7 = (51×4)/28 = 204/28.\n   Thus r_i – r_o = (231 – 204)/28 = 27/28.\n3. Reduce fraction:\n   gcd(27,28) = 1, so 27/28 is in lowest terms with m = 27, n = 28.\n4.

In subtask 1.1 the agents derived only r_contact = R + (r·R)/√(R² + D²) and then applied that to both the inner and outer tangency cases.  In fact the general formula should carry a ± sign, with the minus sign used for the outer‐tube contact.

This small refinement—enforcing the ± in the general formula and its correct assignment—will prevent the mix‐up and yield the correct final answer.'}}, {'verifier_name': 'gpt-4.1-mini', 'evaluation': {'failure_reason': 'The previous reasoning process failed due to an incorrect or inconsistent application of the tangency conditions and sign conventions when deriving the formula for the contact circle radius. Specifically, the formula used for r_contact did not correctly distinguish between the inner and outer tangency cases, leading to swapped or misassigned values for r_i and r_o, which propagated to the final numeric answer.', 'feedback': 'The main error occurred in Sub-task 1.1 and carried through Sub-task 1.2 and 1.3. Multiple agents proposed different formulas for the contact circle radius r_contact, with some suggesting r_contact = R + (r·R)/√(R² + D²), others r_contact = R ∓ (r·R)/√(R² + D²), and yet others r_contact = (R·S)/D. The final adopted formula was r_contact = R + (r·R)/√(R² + D²) without sign distinction. However, the problem involves two tangency configurations: one where the torus contacts the sphere on its inner tube surface (inner tangency) and one on its outer tube surface (outer tangency). These correspond to different geometric constraints and require careful sign handling in the formula.\n\nThe failure to correctly assign the signs or interpret which D corresponds to which tangency led to swapping r_i and r_o values. For example, the inner tangency (distance c = |S - r|) should correspond to a smaller contact circle radius, but the final numeric values assigned r_i = 33/4 (8.25) and r_o = 51/7 (~7.29), which contradicts the expected ordering (r_i > r_o). This inconsistency indicates a misinterpretation of which radius corresponds to which configuration.\n\nMoreover, the agents did not sufficiently verify or cross-check the geometric meaning of the formulas and the physical interpretation of the contact circles. The final subtraction and fraction simplification in Sub-task 1.3 were arithmetically correct but based on incorrect inputs.\n\nIn summary, the root cause is the incorrect or incomplete handling of the sign conventions and tangency conditions in the formula for r_contact, leading to mislabeling and wrong final numeric results.', 'suggestion': '1. Refine Sub-task 1.1 to explicitly derive and clarify the sign conventions for the contact circle radius formula, distinguishing clearly between inner and outer tangency cases. The formula should be presented as r_contact = R ∓ (r·R)/√(R² + D²), with a precise explanation of which sign corresponds to which tangency and why.\n\n2. In Sub-task 1.2, ensure that the computed D values (D_outer and D_inner) are correctly matched with the corresponding sign in the formula and that the resulting r_i and r_o values are consistent with the physical interpretation (i.e., the inner contact circle radius should be smaller or larger as per the problem statement).\n\n3. Add an explicit verification step after computing r_i and r_o to check the ordering and physical plausibility of the results before proceeding to subtraction.\n\n4. Improve context passing by including the sign convention explanation and geometric interpretation from Sub-task 1.1 into Sub-task 1.2 and 1.3 to avoid mislabeling.\n\n5.

Equivalently, one can derive this by locating the unique latitude φ on the torus at which its surface normal lines up with the radial direction to the sphere center, and then reading off the horizontal radius of that latitude circle on the torus:\n\n1.  Coordinates and equations:\n   •  Place the torus so its axis of revolution is the z–axis and its center‐circle of radius R lies in the plane z=0.  A point on the torus may be parametrized by (θ,φ):\n       x=(R + r\u2009cosφ)\u2009cosθ,\n       y=(R + r\u2009cosφ)\u2009sinθ,\n       z= r\u2009sinφ.\n   •  The sphere of radius S (unused in the general derivation) has center on the z–axis at z=D; its normal at any point P is the vector from the sphere’s center to P, namely (x, y, z–D).\n   •  The torus surface normal is ∇F for F=(√(x²+y²)–R)²+z²–r², which at a torus point simplifies to a vector proportional to (r\u2009cosφ\u2009x/(R+r\u2009cosφ), r\u2009cosφ\u2009y/(R+r\u2009cosφ), r\u2009sinφ).\n\n2.  Tangency condition (normals parallel) at latitude φ:\n   We require\n         (r\u2009cosφ)/(R + r\u2009cosφ)  =  (r\u2009sinφ)/(r\u2009sinφ − D)\n   ⇒  R\u2009sinφ + D\u2009cosφ = 0\n   ⇒  tanφ = −D/R.\n\n3.  The horizontal (in‐plane) radius of the torus at latitude φ is\n       r_contact = R + r\u2009cosφ.\n   Since tanφ=−D/R, we have  cosφ = ± R/√(R² + D²).\n\n4.  Therefore two solutions arise:\n     •  cosφ = +R/√(R² + D²)  ⇒  r_contact = R + r·(R/√(R² + D²))\n     •  cosφ = −R/√(R² + D²)  ⇒  r_contact = R − r·(R/√(R² + D²)).\n\n5.  In terms of D measured from the torus axis, these give the two possible contact‐circle radii.  If instead D is the center–to–center distance between the sphere and the torus’s generating‐circle center (as in Sub‐task 2), then one shows √(R² + D_axis²)=D_gen, so cosφ=R/D_gen and the same two radii become\n       r_contact = R ± (r·R)/D\n   where the “+”–choice is the larger circle on the outer side of the torus tube and the “−”–choice is the smaller circle on the inner side.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent uEp0:\nWe place the torus so that its axis is the z–axis, its generating circle (tube‐circle) center C_t lies in the plane z=0 at distance R from the z–axis, and the sphere center C_s lies somewhere on the z–axis at height h.  Then the center‐to‐center distance is D=|C_s−C_t|=√(R²+h²).  A point P of contact must lie on the generating circle and on the sphere, and the common normal there points along the line C_tP and along the line C_sP, so C_t,P,C_s are collinear.  Thus P=C_t + s·u, where u is the unit vector from C_t to C_s and s=±r (the two “sides” of the tube).  At tangency the distance |P−C_s| equals the sphere radius S, so |s−D|=S, which forces D=S±r – the two cases of outer‐tube or inner‐tube contact.  The horizontal (radial) coordinate of P from the z–axis is \n   r_contact = |(C_t)_⊥ + s·u_⊥| = |R − s·(R/D)| = R·|D−s|/D.\nSubstituting s=+r (outer‐tube surface) or s=−r (inner‐tube surface) and using D=S±r at tangency gives the neat formulas below.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent WH5E:\nWe seek the radius ρ of the common circle along which a sphere of center O_s and radius S is tangent to a torus of major radius R (center O_t of generating circle) and minor radius r.  By symmetry we place O_t at the origin, the torus axis along the z–axis, and O_s at (0,0,D).  Any point P on the contact circle lies at cylindrical coordinates (ρ,θ,z) with θ arbitrary, so the circle lies in a plane z=constant and has radius ρ.  \n\n1.  Torus equation (in ρ,z):  (ρ−R)² + z² = r².             (1)\n2.  Sphere equation:         ρ² + (z−D)² = S².                (2)\n3.  At a tangency point P the normals ∇F (to torus) and ∇G (to sphere) are parallel.  Equivalently, the line P\u2009O_t (direction of torus normal) and the line P\u2009O_s (direction of sphere normal) coincide.  In coordinates this yields\n     λ= (ρ−R)/ρ  and   z = λ(z−D),\n   whence  z·R = −D·(ρ−R).                                     (3)\n\n4.  Substitute (3) into (1):\n     (ρ−R)² + [ (ρ−R)·D/R ]² = r²\n     ⇒ (ρ−R)² (1 + D²/R²) = r²\n     ⇒ ρ − R = ± (rR)/√(R² + D²).\n\nThus the contact circle radius is\n     ρ = R ± (rR)/√(R² + D²).\n\n5.

Unit normal at P to the torus is n = (cos u cos v,\u2009sin u cos v,\u2009sin v).  For tangency we require O_s–P ∥ n.

Equating the x‐ and y‐components gives\n   λ cos v = −(R + r cos v),\n  so λ = −(R + r cos v)/cos v.\n  The z‐component then yields\n   D − r sin v = λ sin v = −(R + r cos v)\u2009tan v,\n  which simplifies to\n   D\u2009cos v + R\u2009sin v = 0\n  ⇒ tan v = −D/R.\n\n2.

The torus is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis in its plane. By definition, the minor radius r of a torus equals the radius of this revolving circle. Since that radius is given as 3, we set r = 3. 2. The major radius R of a torus equals the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis of revolution. The problem states this distance is 6, so R = 6. 3. The sphere S is stated to have radius 11, so S = 11. 4. There are no alternative interpretations in the usual torus construction or the question’s wording. Thus the consistent extraction is R = 6, r = 3, S = 11.\n\n### answer by Final Decision Agent 5bjR:\nR = 6, r = 3, S = 11\n\n### Sub-task 2: Synthesize and choose the most consistent distances D_outer and D_inner. \n\n ### thinking by Final Decision Agent OLJW:\nTo find the center-to-center distances when the torus (minor radius r=3) rests externally tangent to the sphere (radius S=11), we proceed step-by-step:\n\n1.

Since that radius is given as 3, we set r = 3. 2. The major radius R of a torus equals the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis of revolution.
