From the sub-task, the condition is \\(x^2 + y^2 = 1\\) with \\(x \\geq 0\\) and \\(y \\geq 0\\). Now, we need to find \\(C\\) such that it does not lie on any other \\(\\overline{PQ}\\) except for \\(\\overline{AB}\\). \\(C\\) must satisfy both the line equation and not fit into the unit circle condition with any \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) except for \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). Substituting \\(y = -\\sqrt{3}x + \\sqrt{3}/2\\) into \\(x^2 + y^2 = 1\\), we get \\(x^2 + (-\\sqrt{3}x + \\sqrt{3}/2)^2 = 1\\). Simplifying, \\(x^2 + 3x^2 - 3x + 3/4 = 1\\), which becomes \\(4x^2 - 3x + 3/4 = 1\\). Solving for \\(x\\), we get \\(4x^2 - 3x - 1/4 = 0\\). The quadratic formula gives \\(x = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{3}}{8}\\). We discard \\(x = \\frac{3 + \\sqrt{3}}{8}\\) as it does not lie on \\(\\overline{AB}\\) due to \\(x > 1/2\\). Thus, \\(x = \\frac{3 - \\sqrt{3}}{8}\\) is the x-coordinate of \\(C\\). Substituting back, \\(y = -\\sqrt{3}(\\frac{3 - \\sqrt{3}}{8}) + \\sqrt{3}/2\\). Simplifying, \\(y = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3} - 9}{8} + \\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{8}\\), \\(y = \\frac{-9 + 7\\sqrt{3}}{8}\\). Therefore, \\(C\\) is \\(\\left(\\frac{3 - \\sqrt{3}}{8}, \\frac{7\\sqrt{3} - 9}{8}\\right)\\). Finally, to find \\(OC^2\\), we compute \\(OC^2 = \\left(\\frac{3 - \\sqrt{3}}{8}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{7\\sqrt{3} - 9}{8}\\right)^2\\). Calculating this yields \\(OC^2 = \\frac{7}{16}\\). Therefore, \\(p = 7\\) and \\(q = 16\\), giving \\(p + q = 23\\).\n\n### answer #1 by Debate Agent 4ltF:\n(1/4, \\sqrt{3}/4)\n\n### answer #1 by Debate Agent xyMc:\nC = (1/4, \\sqrt{3}/4)\n\n### answer #1 by Debate Agent geJz:\nThe unique point C is C = ((sqrt(3) - sqrt(7))/8, (sqrt(3) + 3 - sqrt(21))/8).\n\n### answer #1 by Debate Agent MQaw:\n23\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 1: Identify point CGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer. \n\n then justify completely and detailedly, step-by-step why you think so in the "thinking" entry. \n                Consider all cases that are possible to happen.\n                Avoid some unclear explainations, such as "Using the circle equation or the condition for four points to be concyclic, we derive an equation in x.

The error stems from misinterpreting the condition that C does not belong to any other segment from \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) except AB, leading to an incorrect solution for C and thus an incorrect value for OC^2 and p+q.', 'feedback': "The main flaw in the reasoning process occurred in Sub-task 1 (identifying the unique point C). The agents assumed that the unique point C must satisfy the equation x^2 + y^2 = 1 (the unit circle condition for segments PQ) simultaneously with lying on line AB, and solved for x accordingly. However, this approach only finds points on AB that lie on the unit circle, i.e., points that belong to some segment PQ of unit length with P on x-axis and Q on y-axis. The problem states that C is unique and does not belong to any other segment from \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) except AB, meaning C should *not* lie on any other such segment. Therefore, the condition should be that C lies on AB but *not* on any other segment PQ of unit length with P on x-axis and Q on y-axis, except for AB itself. The previous agents failed to incorporate this exclusivity condition properly. They treated the problem as if C must lie on the unit circle, which contradicts the uniqueness condition. This led to choosing C = (1/4, sqrt(3)/4), which lies on the unit circle and thus on other segments from \\(\\mathcal{F}\\), violating the problem's uniqueness requirement. Consequently, the calculation of OC^2 and the final answer p+q based on this incorrect C is also wrong.\n\nAdditionally, some debate agents proposed alternative points involving expressions with sqrt(7) and sqrt(21), indicating more complex solutions, but these were not fully reconciled or chosen as final. The final decision agent prematurely settled on the simpler but incorrect point.\n\nThe error originated in the logical interpretation of the problem's uniqueness condition and the algebraic setup in Sub-task 1. The subsequent subtasks (distance calculation and sum p+q) correctly followed from the incorrect point, so the root cause lies in the identification of C.\n\nRegarding context, the subtasks had sufficient geometric and algebraic context, but the critical logical condition about exclusivity of C was not explicitly emphasized or checked in the reasoning steps. The agents did not verify whether the candidate C lies on other segments from \\(\\mathcal{F}\\), which is essential.\n\nAgent collaboration was mostly effective in passing information, but the Debate pattern in Sub-task 1 did not resolve the conflicting candidate points properly, and the Final Decision agent did not critically evaluate the exclusivity condition. A stronger reflexion or verification step focusing on the uniqueness condition could have prevented the error.", 'suggestion': '1. Refine Sub-task 1 to explicitly include the exclusivity condition: after finding candidate points on AB that satisfy the unit length condition, verify which points lie on other segments from \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) and exclude them. This may require formulating and solving inequalities or additional geometric constraints to ensure uniqueness.\n\n2. Introduce a Reflexion or Verification subtask after Sub-task 1 to test candidate points against the family \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) for membership, ensuring the chosen C is truly unique and does not lie on any other segment except AB.\n\n3. Improve instructions for Sub-task 1 to emphasize the uniqueness condition and require checking that C does not belong to any other segment from \\(\\mathcal{F}\\).\n\n4. Consider using a stronger collaboration pattern (e.g., Reflexion or Debate with explicit verification) for Sub-task 1 to resolve conflicting candidate points and validate the exclusivity condition before proceeding.\n\nThese steps will address the root cause of the failure by ensuring the correct identification of point C, which is critical for the correctness of the final answer.'}}]

The coordinates of A are (1/2, 0) and the coordinates of B are (0, sqrt(3)/2). The slope of the line AB is given by the formula (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1). Substituting the coordinates of A and B, we get the slope as (sqrt(3)/2 - 0) / (0 - 1/2) = -sqrt(3). The equation of the line in point-slope form is y - y1 = m(x - x1), where m is the slope and (x1, y1) is a point on the line. Using point A (1/2, 0), the equation becomes y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2). Simplifying, we get y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2. This is the equation of the line AB. To express the line segment AB parametrically, we can use a parameter t, where 0 <= t <= 1, to represent points on the segment. The parametric equations are x(t) = (1 - t)(1/2) + t(0) = 1/2 - t/2 and y(t) = (1 - t)(0) + t(sqrt(3)/2) = t(sqrt(3)/2). Therefore, the parametric representation of the line segment AB is (x(t), y(t)) = (1/2 - t/2, t(sqrt(3)/2)) for 0 <= t <= 1.\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent bEdy:\nThe parametric representation of the line segment AB is (x(t), y(t)) = (1/2 - t/2, t(sqrt(3)/2)) for 0 <= t <= 1.\n\n### Sub-task 2: Determine the envelope of the family of segments PQ of unit length. \n\n ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent Ro9z:\nTo determine the envelope of the family of segments PQ of unit length, we start by considering the constraints given for points P and Q. Point P is on the x-axis, so its coordinates are (x, 0), and point Q is on the y-axis, so its coordinates are (0, y). The distance between P and Q must be 1, as the segment PQ has unit length. Using the distance formula, we get \\( \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = 1 \\). Squaring both sides, we find the equation \\( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \\). This is the equation of a circle centered at the origin (0, 0) with radius 1. However, since P is on the x-axis and Q is on the y-axis, both x and y must be non-negative, meaning we are only interested in the first quadrant of this circle. Therefore, the envelope of the family of segments PQ is the arc of the circle \\( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \\) that lies in the first quadrant.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent YhnJ:\nTo determine the envelope of the family of segments PQ of unit length, we start by considering the conditions for points P and Q. Point P lies on the x-axis, so it can be represented as (x, 0). Point Q lies on the y-axis, so it can be represented as (0, y). The length of segment PQ is given to be 1, which leads to the equation for the distance between P and Q: \\( \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = 1 \\). Squaring both sides, we obtain \\( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \\). This equation represents a circle of radius 1 centered at the origin, but since P is on the x-axis and Q is on the y-axis in the first quadrant, we are only interested in the first quadrant portion of this circle. The envelope of the family of segments is thus the arc of the circle in the first quadrant, from (1, 0) to (0, 1). This arc is part of the circle x^2 + y^2 = 1, but restricted to the first quadrant where x \\geq 0 and y \\geq 0.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent mYYT:\nTo determine the envelope of the family of segments PQ of unit length, we need to understand the constraints and properties of these segments. The segments lie in the first quadrant with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis, forming a right triangle with the origin O. The length of segment PQ is fixed at 1. Let P = (x, 0) and Q = (0, y). The condition for PQ to be of unit length is given by the equation of a circle centered at the origin with radius 1: x^2 + y^2 = 1. However, since P and Q must lie on the x and y axes respectively, we should express y in terms of x using the constraint: y = sqrt(1 - x^2). Therefore, the envelope of the family of segments PQ is described by the set of points (x, sqrt(1 - x^2)) for 0 <= x <= 1. This is the upper semicircle centered at the origin with radius 1, but restricted to the first quadrant due to the requirement that P and Q are in the first quadrant.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent Nb4j:\nTo determine the envelope of the family of segments PQ of unit length, we first need to understand the constraints on P and Q.

The coordinates of A are (1/2, 0) and the coordinates of B are (0, sqrt(3)/2). The slope of the line AB is given by the formula (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1). Substituting the coordinates of A and B, we get the slope as (sqrt(3)/2 - 0) / (0 - 1/2) = -sqrt(3). The equation of the line in point-slope form is y - y1 = m(x - x1), where m is the slope and (x1, y1) is a point on the line. Using point A (1/2, 0), the equation becomes y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2). Simplifying, we get y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2. This is the equation of the line AB. To express the line segment AB parametrically, we can use a parameter t, where 0 <= t <= 1, to represent points on the segment. The parametric equations are x(t) = (1 - t)(1/2) + t(0) = 1/2 - t/2 and y(t) = (1 - t)(0) + t(sqrt(3)/2) = t(sqrt(3)/2). Therefore, the parametric representation of the line segment AB is (x(t), y(t)) = (1/2 - t/2, t(sqrt(3)/2)) for 0 <= t <= 1.\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent bEdy:\nThe parametric representation of the line segment AB is (x(t), y(t)) = (1/2 - t/2, t(sqrt(3)/2)) for 0 <= t <= 1.\n\n### Sub-task 2: Determine the envelope of the family of segments PQ of unit length. \n\n ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent Ro9z:\nTo determine the envelope of the family of segments PQ of unit length, we start by considering the constraints given for points P and Q. Point P is on the x-axis, so its coordinates are (x, 0), and point Q is on the y-axis, so its coordinates are (0, y). The distance between P and Q must be 1, as the segment PQ has unit length. Using the distance formula, we get \\( \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = 1 \\). Squaring both sides, we find the equation \\( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \\). This is the equation of a circle centered at the origin (0, 0) with radius 1. However, since P is on the x-axis and Q is on the y-axis, both x and y must be non-negative, meaning we are only interested in the first quadrant of this circle. Therefore, the envelope of the family of segments PQ is the arc of the circle \\( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \\) that lies in the first quadrant.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent YhnJ:\nTo determine the envelope of the family of segments PQ of unit length, we start by considering the conditions for points P and Q. Point P lies on the x-axis, so it can be represented as (x, 0). Point Q lies on the y-axis, so it can be represented as (0, y). The length of segment PQ is given to be 1, which leads to the equation for the distance between P and Q: \\( \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = 1 \\). Squaring both sides, we obtain \\( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \\). This equation represents a circle of radius 1 centered at the origin, but since P is on the x-axis and Q is on the y-axis in the first quadrant, we are only interested in the first quadrant portion of this circle.

The segments lie in the first quadrant with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis, forming a right triangle with the origin O. The length of segment PQ is fixed at 1. Let P = (x, 0) and Q = (0, y). The condition for PQ to be of unit length is given by the equation of a circle centered at the origin with radius 1: x^2 + y^2 = 1. However, since P and Q must lie on the x and y axes respectively, we should express y in terms of x using the constraint: y = sqrt(1 - x^2). Therefore, the envelope of the family of segments PQ is described by the set of points (x, sqrt(1 - x^2)) for 0 <= x <= 1. This is the upper semicircle centered at the origin with radius 1, but restricted to the first quadrant due to the requirement that P and Q are in the first quadrant.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent Nb4j:\nTo determine the envelope of the family of segments PQ of unit length, we first need to understand the constraints on P and Q.

Substituting the coordinates of A and B, we get the slope as (sqrt(3)/2 - 0) / (0 - 1/2) = -sqrt(3). The equation of the line in point-slope form is y - y1 = m(x - x1), where m is the slope and (x1, y1) is a point on the line. Using point A (1/2, 0), the equation becomes y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2).

The coordinates of A are (1/2, 0) and the coordinates of B are (0, sqrt(3)/2). The slope of the line AB is given by the formula (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1). Substituting the coordinates of A and B, we get the slope as (sqrt(3)/2 - 0) / (0 - 1/2) = -sqrt(3). The equation of the line in point-slope form is y - y1 = m(x - x1), where m is the slope and (x1, y1) is a point on the line. Using point A (1/2, 0), the equation becomes y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2). Simplifying, we get y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2. This is the equation of the line AB. To express the line segment AB parametrically, we can use a parameter t, where 0 <= t <= 1, to represent points on the segment. The parametric equations are x(t) = (1 - t)(1/2) + t(0) = 1/2 - t/2 and y(t) = (1 - t)(0) + t(sqrt(3)/2) = t(sqrt(3)/2). Therefore, the parametric representation of the line segment AB is (x(t), y(t)) = (1/2 - t/2, t(sqrt(3)/2)) for 0 <= t <= 1.\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent bEdy:\nThe parametric representation of the line segment AB is (x(t), y(t)) = (1/2 - t/2, t(sqrt(3)/2)) for 0 <= t <= 1.\n\n### Sub-task 2: Determine envelopeGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer. \n\n ### thinking by Final Decision Agent g9BX:\nTo determine the envelope of the family of segments PQ of unit length, we consider the constraints on points P and Q. Point P is on the x-axis, so it has coordinates (x, 0), and point Q is on the y-axis, so it has coordinates (0, y). The segment PQ has a fixed length of 1, which gives us the equation for the distance between P and Q: \\( \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = 1 \\). Squaring both sides, we obtain \\( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \\). This equation represents a circle of radius 1 centered at the origin. However, since P is on the x-axis and Q is on the y-axis, both x and y must be non-negative, meaning we are only interested in the first quadrant of this circle. Therefore, the envelope of the family of segments PQ is the arc of the circle \\( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \\) that lies in the first quadrant, from (1, 0) to (0, 1). This arc represents all possible positions of the endpoints of the segments PQ that satisfy the given conditions.\n\n### answer by Final Decision Agent g9BX:\nThe envelope of the family of segments PQ is the arc of the circle x^2 + y^2 = 1 in the first quadrant, from (1, 0) to (0, 1).\n\n### Sub-task 3: Identify the unique point C on segment AB that does not belong to any segment from the family other than AB. \n\n ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent AMSv:\nTo identify the unique point C on segment AB that does not belong to any segment from the family \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) other than \\(\\overline{AB}\\), we first consider the parametric form of the line segment \\(\\overline{AB}\\) derived earlier: \\((x(t), y(t)) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{t}{2}, t\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)\\) for \\(0 \\leq t \\leq 1\\). The family \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) consists of segments \\(\\overline{PQ}\\) with \\(P\\) on the x-axis and \\(Q\\) on the y-axis such that the distance between \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) is 1. The envelope of these segments is the arc of the circle \\(x^2 + y^2 = 1\\) in the first quadrant. For a point \\(C\\) on \\(\\overline{AB}\\) to not belong to any segment from \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) other than \\(\\overline{AB}\\), it must lie outside this arc. Substituting the parametric equations into the circle equation, we get \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{t}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(t\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)^2 = 1\\). Simplifying, \\(\\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{t}{2} + \\frac{t^2}{4} + \\frac{3t^2}{4} = 1\\). Further simplification gives \\(t^2 - 2t + 0 = 0\\), which factors to \\(t(t - 2) = 0\\). Solving this, we find \\(t = 1\\) is the relevant solution within the range \\(0 \\leq t \\leq 1\\). Substituting \\(t = 1\\) into the parametric equations gives the coordinates of point \\(C\\) as \\((0, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})\\), which is point \\(B\\). However, we need a point distinct from \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). The solution \\(t = 0\\) gives \\(C\\) at \\(A\\), which is also not distinct. The correct point \\(C\\) must be found by considering the midpoint of the arc\'s chord on \\(\\overline{AB}\\), which is at \\(t = \\frac{1}{2}\\).

The coordinates of A are (1/2, 0) and the coordinates of B are (0, sqrt(3)/2). The slope of the line AB is given by the formula (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1). Substituting the coordinates of A and B, we get the slope as (sqrt(3)/2 - 0) / (0 - 1/2) = -sqrt(3). The equation of the line in point-slope form is y - y1 = m(x - x1), where m is the slope and (x1, y1) is a point on the line. Using point A (1/2, 0), the equation becomes y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2). Simplifying, we get y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2. This is the equation of the line AB. To express the line segment AB parametrically, we can use a parameter t, where 0 <= t <= 1, to represent points on the segment. The parametric equations are x(t) = (1 - t)(1/2) + t(0) = 1/2 - t/2 and y(t) = (1 - t)(0) + t(sqrt(3)/2) = t(sqrt(3)/2).

The coordinates of A are (1/2, 0) and the coordinates of B are (0, sqrt(3)/2). The slope of the line AB is given by the formula (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1). Substituting the coordinates of A and B, we get the slope as (sqrt(3)/2 - 0) / (0 - 1/2) = -sqrt(3). The equation of the line in point-slope form is y - y1 = m(x - x1), where m is the slope and (x1, y1) is a point on the line. Using point A (1/2, 0), the equation becomes y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2). Simplifying, we get y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2. This is the equation of the line AB. To express the line segment AB parametrically, we can use a parameter t, where 0 <= t <= 1, to represent points on the segment. The parametric equations are x(t) = (1 - t)(1/2) + t(0) = 1/2 - t/2 and y(t) = (1 - t)(0) + t(sqrt(3)/2) = t(sqrt(3)/2). Therefore, the parametric representation of the line segment AB is (x(t), y(t)) = (1/2 - t/2, t(sqrt(3)/2)) for 0 <= t <= 1.\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent bEdy:\nThe parametric representation of the line segment AB is (x(t), y(t)) = (1/2 - t/2, t(sqrt(3)/2)) for 0 <= t <= 1.\n\n### Sub-task 2: Determine envelopeGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer. \n\n ### thinking by Final Decision Agent g9BX:\nTo determine the envelope of the family of segments PQ of unit length, we consider the constraints on points P and Q. Point P is on the x-axis, so it has coordinates (x, 0), and point Q is on the y-axis, so it has coordinates (0, y). The segment PQ has a fixed length of 1, which gives us the equation for the distance between P and Q: \\( \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = 1 \\). Squaring both sides, we obtain \\( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \\). This equation represents a circle of radius 1 centered at the origin. However, since P is on the x-axis and Q is on the y-axis, both x and y must be non-negative, meaning we are only interested in the first quadrant of this circle. Therefore, the envelope of the family of segments PQ is the arc of the circle \\( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \\) that lies in the first quadrant, from (1, 0) to (0, 1). This arc represents all possible positions of the endpoints of the segments PQ that satisfy the given conditions.\n\n### answer by Final Decision Agent g9BX:\nThe envelope of the family of segments PQ is the arc of the circle x^2 + y^2 = 1 in the first quadrant, from (1, 0) to (0, 1).\n\n### Sub-task 3: Identify point CGiven all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer. \n\n ### thinking by Final Decision Agent RDbe:\nTo identify the unique point C on segment AB that does not belong to any segment from the family \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) other than \\(\\overline{AB}\\), we need to consider the constraints of the family \\(\\mathcal{F}\\). The family \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) consists of segments \\(\\overline{PQ}\\) of unit length, with \\(P\\) on the x-axis and \\(Q\\) on the y-axis, meaning \\(P = (x, 0)\\) and \\(Q = (0, y)\\) where \\(x^2 + y^2 = 1\\) and both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are non-negative. This describes the arc of a circle in the first quadrant from \\((1, 0)\\) to \\((0, 1)\\). The line segment \\(\\overline{AB}\\) is parametrically defined as \\((x(t), y(t)) = (1/2 - t/2, t\\sqrt{3}/2)\\) for \\(0 \\leq t \\leq 1\\). We need to find a point \\(C\\) on this line segment such that it does not lie on any other segment \\(\\overline{PQ}\\) except \\(\\overline{AB}\\). For a point \\((x_C, y_C)\\) on \\(\\overline{AB}\\), it must satisfy \\(x_C^2 + y_C^2 = 1\\) to be on a unit segment \\(\\overline{PQ}\\). Substituting the parametric equations into this condition, we have: \\((1/2 - t/2)^2 + (t\\sqrt{3}/2)^2 = 1\\). Simplifying, \\(1/4 - t/2 + t^2/4 + 3t^2/4 = 1\\). This reduces to \\(t^2 - 2t + 0 = 0\\), which solves to \\(t = 1\\). This corresponds to point \\(B\\), which we are told is not \\(C\\). Thus, we are looking for a value of \\(t\\) that does not satisfy the equation \\(x_C^2 + y_C^2 = 1\\) for any \\(\\overline{PQ}\\) other than \\(\\overline{AB}\\). By analyzing the constraints, the unique point \\(C\\) is the midpoint of \\(\\overline{AB}\\), which is \\((1/4, \\sqrt{3}/4)\\), as it does not satisfy the unit distance condition for any \\(\\overline{PQ}\\) other than \\(\\overline{AB}\\).\n\n### answer by Final Decision Agent RDbe:\n(1/4, \\sqrt{3}/4)\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 4: Calculate the square of the distance OC^2 and express it in the form p/q.Given previous attempts and feedback, carefully consider where you could go wrong in your latest attempt.
