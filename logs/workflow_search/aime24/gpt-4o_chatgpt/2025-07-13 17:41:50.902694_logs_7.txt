We aim to express \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) in terms of each other or a common parameter. First, let\'s solve the first equation for \\( \\log(y) \\): \\( \\log(y) = \\frac{10 \\log(x)}{x} \\). Substitute this into the second equation: \\( 4y \\log(x) = 10 \\frac{10 \\log(x)}{x} \\). Simplifying gives \\( 4y \\log(x) = \\frac{100 \\log(x)}{x} \\).

Now, substitute \\( y = \\frac{25}{x} \\) back into the expression for \\( \\log(y) \\): \\( \\log(y) = \\log\\left(\\frac{25}{x}\\right) = \\log(25) - \\log(x) \\).

We aim to express x and y in terms of each other or a common parameter. From equation 1, we have x log(y) = 10 log(x), which implies log(y) = (10/x) log(x). Similarly, from equation 2, we have 4y log(x) = 10 log(y), which implies log(x) = (10/4y) log(y). Now, substitute log(y) = (10/x) log(x) from the first equation into the second equation: log(x) = (10/4y) ((10/x) log(x)). Simplifying, we get log(x) = (100/4xy) log(x). Assuming log(x) is not zero (since x > 1), we can divide both sides by log(x) to get 1 = 100/4xy. Simplifying gives 4xy = 100, so xy = 25. Thus, x and y are related by the equation xy = 25. This expresses x and y in terms of a common parameter, their product.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent WB0X:\nWe have two equations from Sub-task 1: 1) x log(y) = 10 log(x) and 2) 4y log(x) = 10 log(y). We need to express x and y in terms of each other or a common parameter. Let\'s start with the first equation: x log(y) = 10 log(x). Divide both sides by log(y) log(x) to get x / log(x) = 10 / log(y). This implies log(y) = 10 log(x) / x. For the second equation, 4y log(x) = 10 log(y). Divide both sides by log(x) log(y) to get 4y / log(y) = 10 / log(x). This implies log(x) = 4y log(y) / 10. Now, we have two expressions: log(y) = 10 log(x) / x and log(x) = 4y log(y) / 10. Substitute log(y) from the first expression into the second: log(x) = 4y (10 log(x) / x) / 10. Simplify this to get log(x) = (4y log(x)) / x. Cancel log(x) from both sides (assuming log(x) is not zero), we get 1 = 4y / x. Therefore, x = 4y. Now, substitute x = 4y into log(y) = 10 log(x) / x: log(y) = 10 log(4y) / (4y). This gives us a relationship between x and y. Alternatively, substitute x = 4y into the second equation 4y log(x) = 10 log(y): 4y log(4y) = 10 log(y). This can be further simplified to find a specific relationship between x and y, but we have already expressed x in terms of y as x = 4y.\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent JKpd:\ny = \\frac{25}{x}\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent gPlM:\nxy = 25\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent WB0X:\nx = 4y\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 2: Synthesize and choose the most consistent answer for the equationsGiven all the above thinking and answers, find the most consistent and correct solutions for the equations \n\n then justify completely and detailedly, step-by-step why you think so in the "thinking" entry. \n                Consider all cases that are possible to happen.\n                Avoid some unclear explainations, such as "Using the circle equation or the condition for four points to be concyclic, we derive an equation in x.

From y = 25/x, we can substitute into xy = 25 to confirm: x(25/x) = 25, which simplifies to 25 = 25, confirming consistency.\n\n2. From x = 4y, substituting into xy = 25 gives 4y^2 = 25, leading to y^2 = 25/4, so y = 5/2. Then, x = 4(5/2) = 10.

Converting these to exponential form, we get: 1) \\( y^x = x^{10} \\) and 2) \\( x^{4y} = y^{10} \\).
