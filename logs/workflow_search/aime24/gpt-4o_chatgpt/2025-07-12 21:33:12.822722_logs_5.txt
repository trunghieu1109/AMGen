[{'objective': 'Determine the geometric properties and symmetries of the given tetrahedron based on the provided edge lengths.'}, {'objective': 'Identify the conditions under which a point inside the tetrahedron is equidistant from all faces, possibly involving the concept of the incenter or centroid.'}, {'objective': 'Calculate the distance from the point to the faces in the form specified, ensuring the expression is simplified with integers m, n, and p.'}, {'objective': 'Sum the values of m, n, and p to find the final answer.'}]
