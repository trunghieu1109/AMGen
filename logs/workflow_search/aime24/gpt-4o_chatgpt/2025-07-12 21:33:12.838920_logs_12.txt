[{'objective': 'Express the expression (75+117i)z + (96+144i)/z in terms of real and imaginary parts using z = re^(iθ) where r = 4.'}, {'objective': 'Simplify the expression to identify the real part as a function of θ, using trigonometric identities.'}, {'objective': 'Differentiate the real part with respect to θ and find the critical points to determine the maximum value.'}, {'objective': 'Evaluate the real part at the critical points and endpoints to find the largest possible value.'}]
