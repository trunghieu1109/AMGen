[{'objective': 'Determine the constraints imposed by the equation a + b + c = 300 on the values of a, b, and c.'}, {'objective': 'Analyze the equation a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000 to understand how it restricts the values of a, b, and c.'}, {'objective': 'Develop a method to efficiently iterate over possible values of a, b, and c that satisfy both equations.'}, {'objective': 'Count the number of valid (a, b, c) triples that meet all the given conditions.'}]
