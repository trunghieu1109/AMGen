============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
    - The torus $T$ is formed by revolving a circle of radius $3$ around an axis that is $6$ units away from the circle's center. This gives the torus a major radius of $6$ and a minor radius of $3$.
    - The sphere $S$ has a radius of $11$.
    - The problem involves two configurations: when the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, it forms circles of tangency with radii $r_i$ and $r_o$.
    - The objective is to find the difference $r_i - r_o$ and express it as a fraction $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are coprime, and then find $m+n$.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
    - The torus and sphere are externally tangent, meaning they touch at a single point along a circle.
    - The circle of tangency is formed by the intersection of the torus and the sphere.
    - The conditions of tangency imply geometric constraints on the distances between the centers of the torus and the sphere.
    - The difference $r_i - r_o$ is influenced by the relative positions of the torus and sphere in the two configurations.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
    - The problem is primarily in the domain of geometry, specifically involving 3D geometry and the study of surfaces like tori and spheres.
    - Concepts from analytic geometry may be relevant to determine the positions and distances involved.
    - Such problems are common in mathematical competitions and can have applications in physics and computer graphics.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
    - The problem statement mentions the torus resting on the outside of the sphere twice, which seems redundant. It likely means two different configurations of tangency.
    - The exact nature of the tangency and how the radii $r_i$ and $r_o$ are determined needs clarification.
    - Assumptions about the orientation and positioning of the torus relative to the sphere may be needed to proceed with a solution.

The difference in the radii of these tangent circles, r_i - r_o, is influenced by the torus\'s major and minor radii and the sphere\'s radius.\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent JCSm:\nThe torus is externally tangent to the sphere when the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is such that the surfaces touch at a single point along a circle. In one configuration, this distance is 14, and in the other configuration, it is 8.\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent cj8m:\nThe torus is externally tangent to the sphere when the distance between the centers of the torus\'s tube and the sphere is equal to the sum of the sphere\'s radius and the torus\'s minor radius, which is 14. The torus can be positioned above or below the sphere, leading to different circles of tangency with radii r_i and r_o.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent sRFK:\nTo determine the geometric relationship and conditions for tangency between the torus and the sphere, we must consider the structure of the torus and how it can be positioned relative to the sphere. The torus is defined by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis that is 6 units away from the circle\'s center, resulting in the torus having a major radius of 6 and a minor radius of 3. The sphere has a radius of 11. \n\nWhen the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, it means that the surface of the torus touches the surface of the sphere at exactly one point along a circle. The center of the torus is a distance of 6 from the center of the tube, and the tube itself has a radius of 3. For the torus to be tangent to the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus must equal the sum of the sphere\'s radius and the radius of the circle of tangency. \n\nIn one configuration, the torus can be positioned such that its central hole is around the sphere, and the torus is tangent to the sphere along an inner circle (this gives the radius r_i). In the other configuration, the torus is positioned such that the outer surface of the torus tube is tangent to the sphere, giving the outer circle of tangency (this gives the radius r_o). \n\nThe difference in the radii of these tangent circles, r_i - r_o, is determined by the difference in how the torus is positioned relative to the sphere in the two configurations. The torus\'s major radius (6) and minor radius (3) dictate the possible positions of tangency relative to the sphere\'s surface.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent JCSm:\nTo determine the geometric relationship and conditions for tangency between the torus and the sphere, we need to consider the positions and distances involved. The torus is defined by a major radius (R = 6) and a minor radius (r = 3). The sphere has a radius of 11. For the torus to be externally tangent to the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus (which is the center of the circle that defines the torus) must be such that the surfaces touch at a single point along a circle.\n\n1. When the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, the distance between the center of the sphere and the center of the torus is 11 + 3 = 14, because the torus\'s minor radius extends outward from its center.\n\n2. In the second configuration, when the torus is again externally tangent to the sphere, the distance between the center of the sphere and the center of the torus is 11 - 3 = 8, because the torus\'s minor radius extends inward from its center.\n\nThese two configurations give us two circles of tangency with different radii. The radii of these circles of tangency are determined by the geometry of the torus and the sphere in these configurations.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent cj8m:\nTo determine the geometric relationship and conditions for tangency between the torus and the sphere, we need to consider the positions and dimensions of both shapes.

For this torus, the major radius is 6, and the minor radius is 3. The sphere has a radius of 11. When the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, the distance between the center of the sphere and the center of the torus\'s tube must equal the sum of the sphere\'s radius and the torus\'s minor radius. This is because the torus will touch the sphere along a circle, and the distance from the center of the sphere to the point of tangency is the sphere\'s radius, while the distance from the center of the torus to the point of tangency is the torus\'s minor radius. In one configuration, the torus rests above the sphere such that the center of the torus\'s tube is directly above the sphere\'s center, and in the other configuration, the torus rests below the sphere.

The inner tangency configuration is incorrectly described. When the torus is internally tangent to the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus should be the difference between the sphere\'s radius and the torus\'s major radius, not the sum of the sphere\'s radius and the torus\'s minor radius. Therefore, the correct distance should be 11 - 6 = 5, not 14. The circle of tangency in this case should have a radius of 5 - 3 = 2, not 8. The outer tangency configuration is correctly described, with a circle of tangency radius of 8 - 6 = 2. Therefore, the difference in the radii of the circles of tangency should be 2 - 2 = 0, not 6.

The torus is created by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis that is 6 units away from the circle\'s center. This means the torus has a major radius (distance from the center of the torus to the center of the tube) of 6 and a minor radius (radius of the tube) of 3. The sphere has a radius of 11. These are the key geometric properties needed to understand the problem.\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent xCKc:\nThe torus has a major radius of 6 and a minor radius of 3. The sphere has a radius of 11.\n\n### Sub-task 2: Synthesize and choose the most consistent answer for tangency conditionsGiven all the above thinking and answers, find the most consistent and correct solutions for the tangency conditions. \n\n ### thinking by Final Decision Agent FU1z:\nTo determine the most consistent answer for the tangency conditions between the torus and the sphere, we need to consider the geometric setup and the given answers. The torus has a major radius of 6 and a minor radius of 3, while the sphere has a radius of 11. The torus can be externally tangent to the sphere in two configurations: one where the torus\'s central hole is around the sphere (inner tangency) and one where the outer surface of the torus is tangent to the sphere (outer tangency). The key is to find the distances from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus in these configurations. \n\nAgent JCSm provides a clear explanation of these distances: \n1. In the inner tangency configuration, the distance is 11 + 3 = 14, because the torus\'s minor radius extends outward from its center. \n2. In the outer tangency configuration, the distance is 11 - 3 = 8, because the torus\'s minor radius extends inward from its center. \n\nThese distances are consistent with the geometry of the torus and sphere, and they match the conditions for external tangency. Therefore, the most consistent answer is that the distances are 14 and 8 for the inner and outer tangency configurations, respectively.\n\n### answer by Final Decision Agent FU1z:\nThe torus is externally tangent to the sphere when the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 14 in one configuration and 8 in the other configuration.\n\n### Sub-task 3: Identify and clarify the configurations of tangency, specifically the internal and external tangency conditions, and how they relate to the radii of the circles of tangency.Given previous attempts and feedback, carefully consider where you could go wrong in your latest attempt.

The distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is the sum of the sphere\'s radius and the torus\'s minor radius, which is 11 + 3 = 14. The circle of tangency in this case has a radius of 14 - 6 = 8, because the major radius of the torus is 6.\n\n2. Outer Tangency: In this configuration, the outer surface of the torus is tangent to the sphere. The distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is the difference between the sphere\'s radius and the torus\'s minor radius, which is 11 - 3 = 8. The circle of tangency in this case has a radius of 8 - 6 = 2, because the major radius of the torus is 6.\n\nThe difference between the radii of the circles of tangency is 8 - 2 = 6. However, the problem asks for the difference in terms of the radii of the circles of tangency when the torus is externally tangent to the sphere in both configurations. The correct interpretation is that the difference in the radii of the circles of tangency is 8 - 2 = 6, which can be expressed as a fraction 6/1, where 6 and 1 are coprime.

The torus has a major radius of 6 and a minor radius of 3, while the sphere has a radius of 11. The torus can be externally tangent to the sphere in two configurations: \n\n1. Inner Tangency: In this configuration, the torus\'s central hole is around the sphere. The distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is the sum of the sphere\'s radius and the torus\'s minor radius, which is 11 + 3 = 14. The circle of tangency in this case has a radius of 14 - 6 = 8, because the major radius of the torus is 6.\n\n2. Outer Tangency: In this configuration, the outer surface of the torus is tangent to the sphere. The distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is the difference between the sphere\'s radius and the torus\'s minor radius, which is 11 - 3 = 8. The circle of tangency in this case has a radius of 8 - 6 = 2, because the major radius of the torus is 6.\n\nThe difference between the radii of the circles of tangency is 8 - 2 = 6. However, the problem asks for the difference in terms of the radii of the circles of tangency when the torus is externally tangent to the sphere in both configurations. The correct interpretation is that the difference in the radii of the circles of tangency is 8 - 2 = 6, which can be expressed as a fraction 6/1, where 6 and 1 are coprime.

[{'combined_feedback': '• The core issue lies in a fundamental geometric misunderstanding of the tangency conditions between the torus and the sphere. Specifically, the agents incorrectly assumed the center-to-center distances (D) for the inner and outer tangency cases by simply adding or subtracting the torus\'s minor radius to/from the sphere\'s radius, treating curved surfaces as flat. This led to incorrect values for D (e.g., 11 ± 3) instead of the correct distances derived from solving the system of equations representing tangency (D = 2√7 or 4√10).\n\n• Because of the incorrect D values, all downstream calculations, including the radii of the circles of tangency (r_i and r_o), were flawed. The agents used heuristics like "D - 6" to compute these radii rather than solving for the exact intersection points using the torus parametrization, resulting in incorrect radii (8 and 2) and an incorrect difference (6).\n\n• The critic/reflexion step (subtask 3), which included a critic agent, failed to identify or correct this fundamental error. The feedback from the critic was not effectively integrated into subsequent subtasks, which continued to propagate the incorrect assumptions.\n\n• The workflow lacked explicit analytic geometry derivations or geometric proofs to rigorously establish the tangency conditions, distances, and radii. There was also insufficient passing of critical feedback and context between subtasks, leading to repeated errors.\n\n• Agent collaboration was mostly linear and cooperative, but the absence of adversarial or debate-style interactions prevented early surfacing and resolution of the geometric misunderstandings.\n\n• Subtasks 4, 5, 6, and 7 failed due to reliance on incorrect assumptions from earlier subtasks. Only subtask 1 correctly extracted geometric properties, and subtask 2 partially identified tangency conditions but with flawed assumptions.\n\n• Overall, the problem stems from both flawed reasoning in geometric modeling and insufficient integration of critique and verification within the agent workflow.', 'combined_suggestion': '• Revise subtask 2 to explicitly derive the center-to-center distances (D) by solving the system of equations representing the tangency conditions between the torus and sphere:\n  - Solve (R - 6)^2 + y^2 = 3^2 and R^2 + (y - D)^2 = 11^2 simultaneously,\n  - Enforce the double intersection (discriminant = 0) condition to find exact values of D (D = 2√7 or 4√10).\n\n• Introduce a new dedicated subtask before calculating radii to solve for both the parameter t and D simultaneously, possibly using Lagrange multipliers or matching normals, ensuring precise tangency conditions are met.\n\n• In subtasks 4 and 5, replace heuristic radius calculations with exact computations by substituting the solved D and t back into the torus parametrization R = 6 + 3 cos t, yielding correct radii r_i = 9 and r_o = 3.\n\n• Modify the reflexion (subtask 3) and overall workflow to explicitly pass critic feedback as context to all subsequent subtasks, requiring agents to address and incorporate corrections before proceeding.\n\n• Add verification subtasks that rigorously check geometric consistency of computed distances and radii using analytic geometry or coordinate geometry methods, preventing propagation of errors.\n\n• Enhance instructions and context by including clear geometric definitions, diagrams, and analytic proofs to clarify the physical configuration and meaning of all parameters involved.\n\n• Introduce adversarial collaboration or debate steps where agents challenge assumptions and reasoning, helping to surface and resolve misunderstandings early in the workflow.\n\n• Adjust model parameters (e.g., temperature) in geometry-related subtasks to encourage more critical, precise, and analytic reasoning.\n\n• Ensure all relevant feedback, especially from critic agents, is systematically included in the context passed to later subtasks to improve error detection and correction.\n\nImplementing these changes will root out the curvature and tangency errors, improve integration of critique, and lead to a correct and robust solution for the difference r_i - r_o.'}]
