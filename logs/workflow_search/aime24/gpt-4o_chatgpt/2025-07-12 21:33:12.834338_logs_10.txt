[{'objective': 'Identify the geometric properties and relationships given in the problem, such as the collinearity of points and the circle on which points lie.'}, {'objective': 'Use the given lengths of sides of the rectangles and the properties of collinear points to set up equations or expressions involving CE.'}, {'objective': 'Apply the appropriate geometric theorems or properties, such as circle theorems or properties of collinear points, to solve for the length of CE.'}]
