[{'objective': 'Define the conditions for a number to be b-beautiful, including the digit representation in base b and the sum condition.'}, {'objective': 'Determine the range of numbers that could potentially be b-beautiful based on their two-digit representation in base b.'}, {'objective': 'Calculate the number of b-beautiful numbers for each base b, starting from b=2, and check if there are more than ten such numbers.'}, {'objective': 'Identify the smallest integer b for which there are more than ten b-beautiful integers.'}]
