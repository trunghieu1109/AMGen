[{'objective': 'Analyze and simplify the functions f(x) and g(x) to understand their behavior.'}, {'objective': 'Determine the transformation applied to f(x) and g(x) in the expressions y=4 g(f(sin(2πx))) and x=4 g(f(cos(3πy))).'}, {'objective': 'Set up the equations for the intersections of the graphs based on the transformations and solve for x and y.'}, {'objective': 'Count the number of solutions to determine the number of intersections of the graphs.'}]
