[{'objective': 'Understand the relationship between set A and the sets B, specifically how the maximum element of B being in A affects the number of sets B.'}, {'objective': 'Determine how the number of sets B (2024) relates to the elements in set A and how many elements must be in A to produce this number of sets.'}, {'objective': 'Calculate the elements of set A based on the determined relationship and number of elements, ensuring it satisfies the condition of producing exactly 2024 sets B.'}, {'objective': 'Compute the sum of the elements in set A after identifying the correct elements.'}]
