============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- The figure is a convex equilateral hexagon named ABCDEF.
- All pairs of opposite sides are parallel. Since the hexagon is equilateral, all its sides have the same length (unknown).
- The triangle mentioned is formed by the extensions of the sides AB, CD, and EF.
- The side lengths of this triangle are given as 200, 240, and 300.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The hexagon is equilateral, so |AB| = |BC| = |CD| = |DE| = |EF| = |FA| = s (unknown side length).
- Opposite sides are parallel: AB || DE, BC || EF, CD || FA.
- The triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF suggests these lines intersect pairwise outside the hexagon, creating a triangle with sides 200, 240, and 300.
- The lengths 200, 240, and 300 correspond to the sides of this triangle formed by the extended lines, not the hexagon itself.
- The parallelism and equilateral conditions impose strong geometric constraints on the hexagon's shape and angles.
- The problem likely involves relating the hexagon's side length s to the triangle's side lengths formed by the extended lines.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem lies primarily in Euclidean geometry.
- Subfields include polygon geometry, properties of convex polygons, and line geometry (intersections of extended sides).
- Concepts of parallelism, equilateral polygons, and triangle side lengths are central.
- Such problems are common in mathematical competitions and advanced geometry studies.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The exact method of constructing the triangle from the extensions of AB, CD, and EF is not explicitly described; it is assumed that the three lines intersect pairwise to form a triangle.
- The orientation and labeling of the hexagon vertices could affect the configuration.
- The problem assumes convexity but does not specify angles or other dimensions.
- Potential complexity arises from relating the hexagon's side length to the triangle formed by extended lines, which may involve nontrivial geometric or trigonometric relations.
