============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- Variables: x, y, z are positive real numbers.
- Equations:
  \[ \log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}, \quad \log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}, \quad \log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4} \]
- Objective: Compute \( \left| \log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) \right| \) in simplest fractional form \( \frac{m}{n} \) with \(m,n\) coprime positive integers, then find \(m+n\).

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- Each equation relates the logarithm of a ratio involving one variable over the product of the other two.
- The logarithmic form suggests converting to linear equations in terms of \( \log_2 x, \log_2 y, \log_2 z \).
- The system is symmetric in structure but with different constants on the right side.
- The constraints ensure positivity of variables (since logarithms are defined).
- The target expression \( \log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) \) is a linear combination of the logarithms of x, y, and z.
- The problem reduces to solving a linear system in three variables and then evaluating a linear form.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- Primary domain: Algebra (logarithmic equations and linear algebra).
- Subfields: Logarithmic identities, systems of linear equations.
- Contexts: Typical of mathematical competitions or problem-solving in algebra.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The problem is well-defined with positive real variables and explicit equations.
- No ambiguity in the logarithm base or variable domains.
- Potential challenge: careful algebraic manipulation to avoid errors.
- Assumptions: Variables are positive real numbers as stated, ensuring logarithms are defined.

b - c + b - a - c + c - a - b = (a - a - a) + (-b + b - b) + (-c - c + c) = -a - b - c\n\nOn the right side, sum the fractions:\n1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 = (6/12) + (4/12) + (3/12) = 13/12\n\nSo we have:\n-a -

Each agent carefully handled the fractions and common denominators, arriving at the same values: a = -7/24, b = -3/8, c = -5/12. The consistency across all three independent solutions confirms the correctness of these values. The step-by-step algebraic manipulations are clear, logically sound, and correctly handle the fractional arithmetic.

They substituted these into the expression 4a + 3b + 2c and carefully combined the fractions step-by-step. The calculations were: 4*(-7/24) = -7/6, 3*(-3/8) = -9/8, and 2*(-5/12) = -5/6. Adding these gives (-7/6 - 5/6) - 9/8 = -12/6 - 9/8 = -2 - 9/8 = -16/8 - 9/8 = -25/8. Taking the absolute value yields 25/8. The fraction 25/8 is already in simplest form since 25 and 8 share no common factors other than 1. Therefore, m = 25 and n = 8, and m + n = 33. Since all agents agree and the arithmetic is correct and clearly explained, the most consistent and correct simplified fraction is 25/8, and the sum m + n is 33.\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 6: Find the sum m + n of the numerator and denominator of the simplified fraction representing the absolute value, and present this final result.Given previous attempts and feedback, carefully consider where you could go wrong in your latest attempt.
