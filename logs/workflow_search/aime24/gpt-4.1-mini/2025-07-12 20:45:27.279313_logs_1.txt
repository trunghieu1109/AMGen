============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- Triangle ABC is inscribed in a circle \( \omega \).
- Tangents to \( \omega \) at points B and C intersect at point D.
- Line segment \( \overline{AD} \) intersects \( \omega \) again at point P.
- Side lengths are given: \( AB = 5 \), \( BC = 9 \), and \( AC = 10 \).
- The problem asks to find the length \( AP \) expressed as a reduced fraction \( \frac{m}{n} \), and then compute \( m + n \).

Properties:
- \( ABC \) is a triangle inscribed in circle \( \omega \), so points A, B, C lie on \( \omega \).
- Points B and C have tangents to \( \omega \) intersecting at D, implying D lies outside the circle.
- Point P lies on \( \omega \) and on line \( AD \), distinct from A.

Objective:
- Compute the length \( AP \) in simplest fractional form and find the sum of numerator and denominator.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- Since D is the intersection of tangents at B and C, D is the ex-similicenter of the circle with respect to points B and C.
- The line \( AD \) intersects the circle again at P, so P is the second intersection point of line \( AD \) with \( \omega \).
- The given side lengths allow determination of triangle ABC's dimensions and potentially the circle's radius or other parameters.
- The tangents at B and C and their intersection D relate to the polar and pole concepts in circle geometry.
- The problem likely involves power of a point, chord lengths, or similar triangles to relate \( AP \) to known lengths.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem is in Euclidean Geometry, specifically Circle Geometry.
- Subfields include properties of tangents, chords, and cyclic quadrilaterals.
- Concepts such as power of a point, radical axis, and similarity may be relevant.
- Such problems commonly appear in mathematical competitions and advanced geometry studies.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The exact position of point A relative to B and C is not explicitly given, but side lengths define the triangle uniquely up to congruence.
- The problem assumes standard Euclidean plane geometry and that \( P \neq A \).
- No ambiguity in the definition of tangents or intersection points is apparent.
- Potential challenge: computing \( AP \) requires understanding the configuration of D and P, which may involve nontrivial geometric constructions or algebraic methods.
- Assumption: The circle \( \omega \) is the circumcircle of triangle ABC, and all points and lines lie in the Euclidean plane.
