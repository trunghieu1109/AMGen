============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- Variables: Nonnegative integers a, b, c.
- Constraint 1: a + b + c = 300.
- Constraint 2: a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.
- Objective: Find the number of triples (a,b,c) satisfying both constraints.

Properties:
- The sum constraint is linear and symmetric in a,b,c.
- The second constraint is a homogeneous symmetric polynomial of degree 3, involving terms of the form a^2b and permutations.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The sum constraint restricts the domain to the integer lattice points on the plane a+b+c=300 in the nonnegative orthant.
- The polynomial constraint is symmetric and can be rewritten or related to symmetric sums or expressions involving a,b,c.
- The polynomial expression can be interpreted as sum over all ordered pairs of distinct variables of the form (variable)^2 * (other variable).
- The constraints together define a discrete set of points; the problem is to count how many satisfy both.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- Combinatorics (counting integer solutions under constraints).
- Algebra (symmetric polynomials, polynomial identities).
- Number theory (integer solutions).
- Possibly algebraic combinatorics or discrete geometry.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The problem is well-defined; however, the complexity lies in handling the polynomial constraint.
- Potential challenge: The polynomial constraint is nonlinear and symmetric, making direct enumeration difficult.
- Assumptions: Variables are nonnegative integers; no other constraints.
- It may be helpful to express the polynomial in terms of symmetric sums or to find alternative forms to simplify analysis.
