============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- The problem gives a primitive 13th root of unity \( \omega \), with \( \omega \neq 1 \).
- The expression to evaluate is \( \prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) \).
- The task is to find the remainder when this product is divided by 1000.

Properties:
- \( \omega \) satisfies \( \omega^{13} = 1 \).
- The set \( \{ \omega^k : k=0,1,\ldots,12 \} \) are all the 13th roots of unity.
- The product runs over all these roots, including \( k=0 \) which corresponds to \( \omega^0 = 1 \).

Objective:
- Compute the product \( \prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) \) and find its remainder modulo 1000.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The terms inside the product are expressions involving powers of \( \omega \), specifically linear and quadratic powers.
- Since \( \omega^{13} = 1 \), powers can be reduced modulo 13.
- The product over all roots of unity suggests a connection to evaluating a polynomial at roots of unity or using factorization properties.
- The expression inside the product can be viewed as \( f(\omega^k) \) for some polynomial \( f(x) = 2 - 2x + x^2 \).
- The product over all roots of unity of \( f(\omega^k) \) is related to the resultant or norm of \( f(x) \) with respect to the cyclotomic polynomial \( \Phi_{13}(x) \).
- The condition \( \omega \neq 1 \) is given, but the product includes \( k=0 \) (i.e., \( \omega^0=1 \)), so the product is over all 13th roots including 1.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem lies in algebra and number theory.
- Specifically, it involves algebraic number theory concepts such as roots of unity, cyclotomic polynomials, and polynomial factorization.
- It also touches on modular arithmetic due to the remainder modulo 1000.
- Such problems are common in mathematical competitions and abstract algebra contexts.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The problem states \( \omega \neq 1 \), but the product includes \( k=0 \) which corresponds to \( \omega^0 = 1 \). This could be a point of ambiguity: whether the product is over all 13th roots including 1 or excluding 1.
- The problem likely intends the product over all 13th roots including 1, but the phrase \( \omega \neq 1 \) may be to specify that \( \omega \) is a primitive root.
- The expression inside the product is quadratic in \( \omega^k \), which may be simplified or factored.
- The main challenge is to connect the product over roots of unity to a known polynomial evaluation or resultant to avoid direct computation.
- Assumptions: Treat \( \omega \) as a primitive 13th root of unity, and the product is over all 13th roots including 1 (i.e., \( k=0 \) to 12). This aligns with standard notation and the problem's structure.
