============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- The problem involves the 13th roots of unity, denoted by \( \omega \), where \( \omega^{13} = 1 \) and \( \omega \neq 1 \).
- The product is taken over \( k = 0 \) to \( 12 \), i.e., over all 13th roots of unity including \( \omega^0 = 1 \).
- The expression inside the product is \( 2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k} \).
- The problem asks for the remainder when this product is divided by 1000.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The 13th roots of unity are complex numbers evenly spaced on the unit circle in the complex plane, satisfying \( \omega^{13} = 1 \).
- The product involves evaluating a quadratic polynomial in \( \omega^k \) for each root.
- Since \( \omega^{13} = 1 \), powers of \( \omega \) cycle modulo 13.
- The polynomial inside the product can be viewed as \( f(x) = 2 - 2x + x^2 \) evaluated at each \( x = \omega^k \).
- The product over all roots of unity suggests a connection to the factorization of polynomials or resultant computations.
- The condition \( \omega \neq 1 \) is given but the product includes \( k=0 \) (i.e., \( \omega^0 = 1 \)), so the product includes the term at 1.
- The modulo 1000 condition implies the final numeric value is to be considered modulo 1000, possibly to simplify or interpret the result.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem lies primarily in algebra and number theory.
- Specifically, it involves complex roots of unity, polynomial factorization, and modular arithmetic.
- Subfields include cyclotomic polynomials, algebraic number theory, and modular arithmetic.
- Such problems commonly appear in mathematical competitions and contest math.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The problem states \( \omega \neq 1 \) but the product runs from \( k=0 \) to 12, which includes \( \omega^0 = 1 \). This could be a point of ambiguity.
- The nature of the polynomial inside the product and its factorization properties might be nontrivial.
- Computing the product directly is complex; understanding the algebraic structure is key.
- The modulo 1000 operation suggests the final numeric value might be large, and modular arithmetic techniques may be necessary.
- No explicit instructions on intermediate steps or simplifications are given.
