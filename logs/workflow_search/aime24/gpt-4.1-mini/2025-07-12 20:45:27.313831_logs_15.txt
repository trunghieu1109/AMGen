============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- Total residents: 900.
- Items: diamond ring (195 owners), golf clubs (367 owners), garden spade (562 owners), and candy hearts (owned by all 900).
- Exactly two items owned by 437 residents.
- Exactly three items owned by 234 residents.
- Objective: Find the number of residents owning all four items.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- Each resident owns candy hearts, so the problem reduces to analyzing ownership of the other three items plus candy hearts.
- The counts of exactly two and exactly three items include candy hearts as one of the items.
- The problem involves overlapping sets and their intersections.
- The condition that everyone owns candy hearts simplifies the problem, as candy hearts is a universal set.
- The number owning all four items corresponds to the intersection of all four sets.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- Set theory and combinatorics, specifically inclusion-exclusion principle.
- Counting problems in discrete mathematics.
- Applications in survey analysis and data classification.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- Whether the counts of exactly two and exactly three items include candy hearts or only the other three items.
- The exact interpretation of "exactly two" and "exactly three" in the context of four items where one is universal.
- Assumptions about independence or overlap among the three non-universal items.
- Clarification on whether "exactly two" means exactly two of the four items or exactly two of the three non-candy items plus candy hearts.

Reasonable assumptions may include treating candy hearts as a universal set and interpreting the counts accordingly to apply inclusion-exclusion.
