============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- Functions defined: f(x) = | |x| - 1/2 | and g(x) = | |x| - 1/4 |.
- Two curves defined implicitly:
  (a) y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx)))
  (b) x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy)))
- The problem asks for the number of intersection points of these two curves.

Properties:
- f and g are compositions of absolute value functions, producing piecewise linear, nonnegative functions.
- The arguments to f are sin(2πx) and cos(3πy), which are periodic with periods 1 and 2/3 respectively.
- The functions involve nested absolute values, which create symmetry and piecewise linear segments.

Objective:
- Determine the number of points (x,y) satisfying both equations simultaneously, i.e., the number of intersections of the graphs of y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))).

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The functions f and g transform the sine and cosine values into nonnegative values with specific piecewise linear shapes.
- The sine and cosine inputs introduce periodicity and oscillations in the outputs.
- The equations define implicit curves where y depends on x through a transformed sine function, and x depends on y through a transformed cosine function.
- The intersection points satisfy both equations simultaneously, implying a fixed point condition in the plane.
- The constraints from absolute values and periodicity restrict the range and shape of the curves.
- The interplay between frequencies (2π for sine in x, 3π for cosine in y) suggests a complex pattern of intersections.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem lies primarily in real analysis and geometry, specifically in the study of piecewise-defined functions and implicit curves.
- It involves trigonometric functions, absolute value transformations, and implicit curve intersections.
- Subfields include analysis of periodic functions, piecewise linear functions, and implicit function theory.
- Such problems are common in mathematical competitions, real analysis, and sometimes in applied contexts involving signal processing or pattern analysis.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The domain of x and y is not explicitly stated; presumably real numbers.
- The problem does not specify if intersections at boundary points or infinite intersections are possible.
- The behavior of f and g at points where their arguments equal 1/2 or 1/4 may create nondifferentiable points affecting the curve shapes.
- The complexity of the nested absolute values combined with trigonometric functions may lead to multiple branches or segments.
- Assumptions that x and y range over all real numbers and that intersections are counted as distinct points are reasonable to proceed.
- Clarification on whether to count multiplicities or only distinct intersection points would be helpful but is likely not required.
