============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- Variables: Nonnegative integers a, b, c.
- Constraints: a + b + c = 300.
- Equation: a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.
- Objective: Find the number of triples (a,b,c) satisfying both conditions.

Properties:
- The sum constraint is linear and symmetric in a,b,c.
- The polynomial is symmetric and homogeneous of degree 3, involving terms like a^2b and ab^2.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The sum constraint restricts the domain to a 2D simplex in the nonnegative integer lattice.
- The polynomial expression is symmetric and can be rewritten or factored to reveal relationships between variables.
- The polynomial sums terms where one variable is squared and multiplied by another, summing over all permutations.
- The constraints together define a discrete set of points; the polynomial condition further restricts this set.
- The problem likely requires understanding how the polynomial relates to the sum and the distribution of values among a,b,c.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- Combinatorics (counting integer solutions under constraints).
- Algebra (symmetric polynomials, polynomial identities).
- Number theory (integer solutions).
- Possibly discrete geometry (lattice points in polytopes).

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- Whether order matters: Are (a,b,c) and (b,a,c) distinct? The problem implies ordered triples.
- The complexity of the polynomial suggests potential multiple solutions or symmetries to exploit.
- No explicit domain restrictions beyond nonnegativity and sum.
- Assumptions: Treat (a,b,c) as ordered triples of nonnegative integers; the polynomial is exactly as given.
- Potential challenge: The polynomial is not straightforward to factor; may require rewriting or bounding.
- The problem is well-posed but may require insight into symmetric sums or combinatorial identities.
