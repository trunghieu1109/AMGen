============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- Variables: x, y, z are positive real numbers.
- Equations:
  \[ \log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2} \]
  \[ \log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3} \]
  \[ \log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4} \]
- Expression of interest: \( \left| \log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) \right| \) which is given as a reduced fraction \( \frac{m}{n} \) with relatively prime positive integers m and n.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- Each equation relates the logarithm of a ratio involving one variable in the numerator and the product of the other two variables in the denominator.
- The logarithmic equations impose multiplicative constraints on x, y, and z.
- Since the logarithms are base 2, the equations can be rewritten as exponential forms, linking the variables via powers of 2.
- The system is symmetric in structure but with different constants (1/2, 1/3, 1/4), suggesting a nontrivial interdependence.
- The expression \( \log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) \) can be expanded using logarithm properties into a linear combination of \( \log_2 x, \log_2 y, \log_2 z \), which are related to the given equations.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- Primary domain: Algebra, specifically logarithmic and exponential equations.
- Subfields: Real analysis (due to positivity constraints), logarithmic identities, and systems of equations.
- Potential applications: Mathematical problem solving in competitions, algebraic manipulation, and understanding logarithmic relationships.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The problem is well-defined with clear constraints; all variables are positive real numbers.
- No ambiguity in the logarithm base or the domain of variables.
- Potential challenge lies in solving the system due to the fractional exponents and the interdependence of variables.
- The problem requires careful algebraic manipulation rather than numerical approximation.

Each original equation log2(variable / product of other two variables) becomes a linear equation in terms of a, b, and c. The consistent system of linear equations is: a - b - c = 1/2; b - a - c = 1/3; c - a - b = 1/4. This rewriting is consistent across all agents and correctly represents the original logarithmic system as linear equations.\n\n### answer by Final Decision Agent iN83:\na - b - c = 1/2; b - a - c = 1/3; c - a - b = 1/4\n\n### Sub-task 2: Derive a linear system from the rewritten equations and simplify it to prepare for solving. \n\n ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent YdK9:\nStarting with the system of linear equations: a - b - c = 1/2; b - a - c = 1/3; c - a - b = 1/4, we add all three equations to find a relationship between a, b, and c. Adding them gives (a - b - c) + (b - a - c) + (c - a - b) = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4. The left side simplifies to - (a + b + c) because the terms a, b, c cancel out accordingly: a - b - c + b - a - c + c - a - b = - (a + b + c). The right side sums to 13/12. Thus, we have - (a + b + c) = 13/12, or a + b + c = -13/12. Using this, we can express each equation in terms of a single variable. For example, from the first equation a - b - c = 1/2, replace b + c by (a + b + c) - a = -13/12 - a, leading to a - (-13/12 - a) = 1/2, which simplifies to 2a + 13/12 = 1/2, giving a linear equation in a. Similarly, we can solve for b and c. Hence, the simplified system prepared for solving is: a + b + c = -13/12; a - b - c = 1/2; b - a - c = 1/3; c - a - b = 1/4. This set can be used to solve for a, b, and c.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent SHsw:\nStarting from the system of linear equations: a - b - c = 1/2; b - a - c = 1/3; c - a - b = 1/4, we add all three equations to simplify. Adding left sides: (a - b - c) + (b - a - c) + (c - a - b) = a - b - c + b - a - c + c - a - b = (a - a + b - b + c - c) - (c + c + a + b + b + a) = 0 - 2(a + b + c) = -2(a + b + c). Adding right sides: 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 = 6/12 + 4/12 + 3/12 = 13/12. So, -2(a + b + c) = 13/12, hence a + b + c = -13/24. Next, express the system in terms of a single variable by substituting c = -13/24 - a - b back into the original equations to reduce the system. This prepares the system for solving for a, b, and c.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent BNdT:\nStarting from the system of linear equations in terms of a, b, and c: a - b - c = 1/2; b - a - c = 1/3; c - a - b = 1/4. Adding all three equations, we get (a - b - c) + (b - a - c) + (c - a - b) = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4. The left side simplifies to - (a + b + c) because a, b, c terms cancel out pairwise except for the negatives. So, - (a + b + c) = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 = (6/12 + 4/12 + 3/12) = 13/12. Therefore, a + b + c = -13/12. Using this, we substitute back into each equation to express in terms of a single variable. For example, from the first equation a - b - c = 1/2, rewrite as a - (b + c) = 1/2, and since a + b + c = -13/12, then b + c = -13/12 - a. Substitute into the first equation: a - (-13/12 - a) = 1/2 => a + 13/12 + a = 1/2 => 2a = 1/2 - 13/12 = (6/12 - 13/12) = -7/12 => a = -7/24. Similarly, solve for b and c using the other equations. This simplification prepares the system for straightforward solving. The simplified system thus is: a + b + c = -13/12; and the original three equations as they are, or equivalently, use the substitutions to solve for each variable individually.\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent YdK9:\na + b + c = -13/12; a - b - c = 1/2; b - a - c = 1/3; c - a - b = 1/4\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent SHsw:\na + b + c = -13/24; a - b - c = 1/2; b - a - c = 1/3\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent BNdT:\nThe simplified linear system includes the equation a + b + c = -13/12 derived by adding all three original equations, along with the original equations: a - b - c = 1/2; b - a - c = 1/3; c - a - b = 1/4, which can be used to solve for a, b, and c.\n\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 2: Synthesize and choose the most consistent simplified linear system.\n\n.

Using the first equation a + b + c = -13/12, we substitute into the others. From the first and second equations: a - b - c = 1/2 and a + b + c = -13/12. Adding these two gives 2a = 1/2 - 13/12 = (6/12 - 13/12) = -7/12, so a = -7/24. Similarly, from the first and third equations (b - a - c = 1/3) and (a + b + c = -13/12), adding them gives 2b = 1/3 - 13/12 = (4/12 - 13/12) = -9/12 = -3/4, so b = -3/8. From the first and fourth equations (c - a - b = 1/4) and (a + b + c = -13/12), adding them gives 2c = 1/4 - 13/12 = (3/12 - 13/12) = -10/12 = -5/6, so c = -5/12. Thus, the solution is a = -7/24, b = -3/8, c = -5/12.\n\n### answer #1 by Debate Agent ra9b:\na = -7/24, b = -3/8, c = -5/12\n\n### answer #1 by Debate Agent K77h:\na = -7/24, b = -3/8, c = -5/12\n\n### answer #1 by Debate Agent 27Mf:\na = -7/24, b = -3/8, c = -5/12\n\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 3: Given all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final solution for a, b, c.\n\n.

The left side simplifies to - (a + b + c) because the terms a, b, c cancel out pairwise except for the negatives. The right side sums to 13/12. Thus, - (a + b + c) = 13/12, or a + b + c = -13/12. This is consistent with the majority of the agents\' reasoning and the arithmetic of the sums. Including this equation along with the original three equations provides a consistent and simplified system that can be used to solve for a, b, and c. Therefore, the most consistent simplified linear system is: a + b + c = -13/12; a - b - c = 1/2; b - a - c = 1/3; c - a - b = 1/4.\n\n### answer by Final Decision Agent zUMa:\na + b + c = -13/12; a - b - c = 1/2; b - a - c = 1/3; c - a - b = 1/4\n\n### Sub-task 3: Solve the linear system for a, b, and c (the logarithms of x, y, and z respectively). Given solutions to the problem from other agents, consider their opinions as additional advice. Please think carefully and provide an updated answer. \n\n ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent ra9b:\nWe are given the system: a + b + c = -13/12; a - b - c = 1/2; b - a - c = 1/3; c - a - b = 1/4. Here, a = log2(x), b = log2(y), c = log2(z). From the first equation, a + b + c = -13/12. Using the second, a - b - c = 1/2. Adding these two equations: (a + b + c) + (a - b - c) = -13/12 + 1/2 => 2a = -13/12 + 6/12 = -7/12, so a = -7/24. Similarly, add the first and third: (a + b + c) + (b - a - c) = -13/12 + 1/3 => 2b = -13/12 + 4/12 = -9/12 = -3/4, so b = -3/8. Add the first and fourth: (a + b + c) + (c - a - b) = -13/12 + 1/4 => 2c = -13/12 + 3/12 = -10/12 = -5/6, so c = -5/12.
