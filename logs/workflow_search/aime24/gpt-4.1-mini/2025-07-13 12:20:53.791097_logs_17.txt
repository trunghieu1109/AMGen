============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- Variables: Nonnegative integers a, b, c.
- Constraint 1: a + b + c = 300.
- Constraint 2: a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.
- The second equation is symmetric in a, b, c and involves terms of the form a^2b and ab^2.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The sum constraint restricts the triples to lie on a plane in the integer lattice.
- The second constraint is a homogeneous polynomial of degree 3, symmetric in the variables.
- The terms can be grouped or rewritten to reveal symmetry or factorization, possibly relating to symmetric sums or power sums.
- The constraints together define a discrete set of points (a,b,c) in the nonnegative integer lattice.
- The problem likely requires understanding how these polynomial expressions relate to the sum and how to count integer solutions.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- Primary domain: Combinatorics (counting integer solutions under constraints).
- Secondary domains: Algebra (symmetric polynomials), Number Theory (integer solutions), possibly Discrete Geometry.
- Such problems appear in mathematical competitions and enumerative combinatorics.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- No ambiguity in variable domains or constraints; all are clearly stated.
- Potential challenge: complexity in handling the cubic symmetric polynomial constraint.
- Multiple configurations possible due to symmetry; counting distinct triples may require considering permutations or equivalence classes.
- The large constants suggest computational or algebraic simplification is needed rather than brute force.
