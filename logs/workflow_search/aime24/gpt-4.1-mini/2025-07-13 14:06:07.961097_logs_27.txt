============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- The variable N is a four-digit positive integer, meaning 1000 ≤ N ≤ 9999.
- N has a special property: if any one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7.
- Q and R are defined as the quotient and remainder when N is divided by 1000, i.e., N = 1000Q + R, with Q an integer and 0 ≤ R < 1000.
- The problem involves finding Q + R after determining N.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- Changing one digit of N to 1 produces a new number divisible by 7. This implies that for each digit position i (thousands, hundreds, tens, units), replacing the digit at position i with 1 yields a number divisible by 7.
- Since N is four-digit, the thousands digit is at least 1.
- The divisibility by 7 condition applies to four different numbers (one for each digit replaced by 1).
- The quotient Q corresponds to the thousands digit(s) of N (since dividing by 1000), and R corresponds to the last three digits.
- The problem’s structure suggests modular arithmetic and digit manipulation constraints.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem lies primarily in Number Theory, specifically dealing with divisibility and modular arithmetic.
- It also involves combinatorial reasoning about digits and their positions.
- Such problems are common in mathematical competitions and recreational mathematics.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The problem does not explicitly state whether the digit changed to 1 can be the same digit already equal to 1; presumably, the change must be to 1 regardless of the original digit.
- It is not specified whether the digit replacement is done one digit at a time or simultaneously; the wording suggests one digit at a time.
- The problem assumes standard decimal representation without leading zeros after digit replacement.
- Potential challenges include handling multiple divisibility conditions simultaneously and ensuring the greatest such N is found.

The problem states that if any one digit of N is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. This gives us four numbers formed by replacing each digit with 1 one at a time:\n\n1. Replace the thousands digit a with 1: 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d\n2. Replace the hundreds digit b with 1: 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d = 1000a + 100 + 10c + d\n3.

The modular conditions derived are four congruences modulo 7 involving a, b, c, d. By reducing coefficients modulo 7 and setting up the system, we find the relations between digits modulo 7. The key modular equations are: d ≡ 6a - 5 (mod 7), 3c - 2b ≡ 1 (mod 7), and 6a + 2b + 3c + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 7). From these, we express b, c, d in terms of a modulo 7 and enumerate possible digits (0-9) matching these residues. Testing all a from 1 to 9, only a=5 yields digits b=6, c=9 or 2, d=4 that satisfy all conditions. Among these, N=5694 (with c=9) is greater than N=5624 (with c=2). Checking divisibility for all four replacements confirms N=5694 satisfies the problem\'s conditions. Other candidates fail divisibility checks. Therefore, the greatest such N is 5694. Finally, dividing N by 1000 gives quotient Q=5 and remainder R=694, so Q+R=699.
