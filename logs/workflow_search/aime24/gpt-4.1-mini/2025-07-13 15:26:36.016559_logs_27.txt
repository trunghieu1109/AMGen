============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- The variable N is defined as the greatest four-digit positive integer with a special divisibility property.
- The property: Changing any one digit of N to 1 results in a number divisible by 7.
- Q and R are defined as the quotient and remainder when N is divided by 1000, i.e., N = 1000Q + R, with Q and R integers.
- The problem asks for the sum Q + R.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- N is a four-digit integer, so 1000 ≤ N ≤ 9999.
- Changing any single digit of N to 1 produces a number divisible by 7. This implies a set of divisibility conditions for each digit position.
- Since changing digits affects the number's value, the divisibility by 7 must hold for all such single-digit modifications.
- Q and R relate to N via division by 1000, effectively separating the thousands digit(s) (Q) from the last three digits (R).
- The constraints imply a strong modular arithmetic relationship involving the digits of N and the modulus 7.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem lies primarily in Number Theory, specifically modular arithmetic and divisibility rules.
- It also involves combinatorial reasoning about digit changes and their effects.
- Such problems are common in mathematical competitions and recreational mathematics.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The problem does not explicitly state whether leading zeros are allowed when digits are changed to 1; however, since N is four-digit, the changed number should presumably remain four-digit.
- It is not specified whether the digit changed to 1 can be the same digit if it is already 1 (i.e., does changing a digit that is already 1 count as a change?).
- The exact method to handle the division into Q and R is straightforward but requires attention to ensure correct interpretation.
- Potential complexity arises from checking divisibility conditions for all digit positions and ensuring the greatest such N is found.
