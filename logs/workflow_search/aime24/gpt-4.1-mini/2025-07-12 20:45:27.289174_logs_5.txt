============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- The problem involves a tetrahedron named ABCD.
- Edge lengths are given with pairs equal: AB = CD = √41, AC = BD = √80, BC = AD = √89.
- There exists a point I inside the tetrahedron such that the perpendicular distances from I to each of the four faces are equal.
- The distance from I to each face can be expressed in the form (m√n)/p, where m, n, p are positive integers, m and p are coprime, and n is square-free.
- The task is to find the sum m + n + p.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The tetrahedron has pairs of edges equal in length, suggesting some symmetry or special geometric property.
- The point I is equidistant from all faces, implying it is the incenter of the tetrahedron (the center of the inscribed sphere).
- The equal distances to faces correspond to the radius of the inscribed sphere.
- The given edge lengths constrain the shape and size of the tetrahedron, affecting the inradius.
- The problem likely requires relating edge lengths to face areas, volume, and then using the formula for the inradius r = 3V / S, where V is volume and S is total surface area.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem lies in solid geometry, specifically 3D Euclidean geometry.
- It involves concepts of tetrahedra, distances, and inscribed spheres.
- Subfields include metric geometry and spatial reasoning.
- Such problems are common in mathematical competitions and advanced geometry studies.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The exact coordinates or angles of the tetrahedron are not given, only edge lengths.
- It is assumed the tetrahedron is non-degenerate and the given edge lengths are consistent.
- The position of point I is not specified but is implied to be the incenter.
- Calculating volume and surface area from edge lengths alone can be complex.
- Assumptions: The tetrahedron is valid with the given edges, and I is the incenter, so standard formulas for inradius apply.
