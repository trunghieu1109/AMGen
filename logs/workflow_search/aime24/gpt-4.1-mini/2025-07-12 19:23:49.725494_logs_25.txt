============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- The figure is a convex equilateral hexagon ABCDEF, meaning all six sides have equal length.
- All pairs of opposite sides are parallel: AB || DE, BC || EF, and CD || FA.
- A triangle is formed by the extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF, and this triangle has side lengths 200, 240, and 300.
- The objective is to find the common side length of the hexagon.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The hexagon is equilateral and has pairs of opposite sides parallel, implying it is a special type of hexagon, often called an affine-regular or equiangular hexagon with parallel opposite sides.
- The triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF suggests that these three lines (or their extensions) intersect pairwise to form a triangle outside or around the hexagon.
- The side lengths of this triangle (200, 240, 300) correspond to distances between intersection points of these extended lines.
- The parallelism and equal side length conditions impose strong geometric constraints, likely allowing the use of vector or coordinate geometry to relate the hexagon’s side length to the triangle’s side lengths.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem lies primarily in Euclidean geometry, specifically polygon geometry and properties of convex polygons.
- Subfields include affine geometry (due to parallelism and equal lengths), vector geometry, and possibly trigonometry for relating side lengths and angles.
- Such problems are common in mathematical competitions and advanced geometry studies.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The exact configuration of the hexagon (e.g., orientation, coordinates) is not specified.
- The position and nature of the triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF need clarification: are these lines extended beyond the hexagon, and how do their intersections define the triangle?
- It is assumed the hexagon is convex and equilateral with parallel opposite sides, but the problem does not specify if it is equiangular.
- To proceed, one might assume a coordinate system or vector representation to model the hexagon and the triangle, justifying these assumptions by the problem’s geometric constraints.
