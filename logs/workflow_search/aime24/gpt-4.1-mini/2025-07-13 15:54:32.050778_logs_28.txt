============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- A torus T is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis in the plane of the circle, at a distance 6 from the circle's center. This creates a standard torus (donut shape) with major radius 6 and minor radius 3.
- A sphere S has radius 11.
- The torus T is placed externally tangent to the sphere S in two different configurations, each time tangent along a circle.
- In one configuration, the circle of tangency on the torus has radius r_i; in the other, it has radius r_o.
- The problem involves the difference r_i - r_o, which can be expressed as a reduced fraction m/n, with m and n positive integers.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The torus is defined by two radii: the major radius (distance from the center of the tube to the axis of revolution) R=6, and the minor radius (radius of the revolving circle) r=3.
- The sphere of radius 11 is fixed.
- External tangency between the torus and sphere means they touch without intersecting, along a circle on the torus surface.
- The two different tangency configurations correspond to two distinct circles of contact on the torus, with radii r_i and r_o.
- The difference r_i - r_o relates to the geometry of the torus and sphere and their relative positions.
- The problem implicitly involves understanding how the torus can be positioned relative to the sphere to achieve external tangency along different circles.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem lies primarily in geometry, specifically 3D geometry involving surfaces of revolution.
- Concepts involved include toroidal surfaces, spheres, tangency conditions, and circle radii on surfaces.
- Subfields include differential geometry (surface properties), and possibly algebraic geometry (equations of surfaces).
- Such problems are common in mathematical competitions and geometric modeling.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The phrase "when T rests on the outside of S" is repeated; it is unclear if the two tangency configurations correspond to different orientations or positions of T relative to S.
- The exact positions or orientations of the torus relative to the sphere for each tangency are not specified.
- The problem assumes knowledge of how to find the radius of the circle of tangency on the torus surface, which may require understanding the torus parameterization.
- Potential challenges include determining the precise geometric conditions for external tangency and computing the radii of the tangent circles without explicit coordinates.
