============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- A regular octagon with 8 vertices.
- Each vertex is independently colored red or blue with equal probability (1/2 each).
- The coloring is random and independent across vertices.
- The problem considers rotations of the octagon (by multiples of 45 degrees) that permute vertices.
- The event of interest is that there exists a rotation such that all blue vertices are mapped onto vertices that were originally red.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The octagon's rotational symmetry group is cyclic of order 8, generated by rotation by 45 degrees.
- Each rotation permutes the vertices, thus permuting the color assignments.
- The condition requires existence of a rotation g such that for every vertex v colored blue, the vertex g(v) was originally red.
- This implies the blue set and the red set are related by the rotation g.
- Since colors are assigned independently, the probability involves counting colorings with this property and dividing by total colorings (2^8).
- The problem involves understanding how rotations act on subsets of vertices and how colorings transform under these actions.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem is in combinatorics, specifically probabilistic combinatorics.
- It involves group actions on sets (group theory), symmetry in geometry.
- Concepts from discrete geometry and probability theory are relevant.
- Such problems appear in mathematical competitions and in studies of symmetry and coloring problems.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The phrase "all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices" implies a mapping from blue vertices under rotation to original red vertices, but it is not explicitly stated whether the rotation must be nontrivial or can be the identity.
- It is not explicitly stated whether the rotation must be a proper rotation (excluding identity) or can include the identity rotation.
- The problem assumes vertices are labeled or ordered to define rotations, but the labeling convention is implicit.
- Potential complexity arises in enumerating all rotations and colorings satisfying the condition, and in handling overlapping cases where multiple rotations satisfy the condition.
