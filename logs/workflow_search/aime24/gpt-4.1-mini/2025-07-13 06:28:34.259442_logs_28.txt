============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- A torus T is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis in the plane of the circle, at a distance 6 from the circle's center. This creates a standard torus with major radius R = 6 and minor radius r = 3.
- A sphere S has radius 11.
- The torus T is placed externally tangent to the sphere S in two different configurations, each time tangent along a circle on the torus surface.
- In these two configurations, the radii of the tangent circles on the torus are denoted r_i and r_o.
- The problem asks for the difference r_i - r_o expressed as a reduced fraction m/n, and then to find m + n.

Objective: Determine the difference between the radii of the two tangent circles formed by the torus when it rests externally tangent to the sphere in two distinct ways.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The torus is defined by two radii: the major radius R = 6 (distance from the center of the tube to the axis of revolution) and the minor radius r = 3 (radius of the revolving circle).
- The sphere of radius 11 is fixed.
- External tangency implies the torus and sphere touch without intersection, along a circle on the torus surface.
- The two tangent circles correspond to two different positions or orientations of the torus relative to the sphere.
- The radii r_i and r_o correspond to the radii of these tangent circles on the torus surface, which depend on the geometry of the torus and the point(s) of contact with the sphere.
- The difference r_i - r_o is a measure of how these tangent circles differ in size, reflecting the geometric constraints imposed by the sphere's radius and the torus's dimensions.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem lies primarily in geometry, specifically in 3D geometry involving surfaces of revolution.
- Concepts involved include the geometry of tori and spheres, external tangency conditions, and circle radii on curved surfaces.
- This problem is typical in mathematical competitions and advanced geometry contexts.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The problem states "when T rests on the outside of S" twice, which may be a typographical repetition; presumably, the two tangent configurations differ in orientation or position.
- The exact nature of the two tangent circles (r_i and r_o) is not explicitly described; it is implied they correspond to two distinct tangent positions.
- The problem assumes knowledge of how to find the radii of circles of tangency on a torus when tangent to a sphere, which may require assumptions about the torus's orientation.
- It is reasonable to assume the torus is oriented so that its axis of revolution is aligned in a way that allows two distinct external tangencies with the sphere.
- The problem does not specify the location of the torus relative to the sphere beyond external tangency, so one may assume standard positioning to analyze the problem.

The sphere S is centered at the origin with radius 11, so its equation is x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 121. External tangency means the torus and sphere touch along a circle without intersecting. Because the torus is symmetric about the z-axis, the tangent circle lies on a toroidal circle defined by a fixed angle parameter on the minor circle. The radius of this tangent circle on the torus is R + r cos(θ), where θ is the angle parameter on the minor circle. The distance from the origin to the center of the circle generating the torus cross-section at angle θ is R + r cos(θ). The torus surface points satisfy (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - R)^2 + z^2 = r^2, and the sphere points satisfy x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 121. For external tangency along a circle, the sphere radius must equal the distance from the origin to the torus surface at the tangent circle. The distance from the origin to the center of the circle generating the torus cross-section is R + r cos(θ), and the radius of the circle in the z-direction is r sin(θ). The distance from the origin to any point on this circle is sqrt((R + r cos(θ))^2 + (r sin(θ))^2) = sqrt(R^2 + 2Rr cos(θ) + r^2). Setting this equal to 11 (the sphere radius) and squaring gives R^2 + 2Rr cos(θ) + r^2 = 121. Substituting R=6 and r=3 yields 36 + 36 cos(θ) + 9 = 121, or 45 + 36 cos(θ) = 121, so 36 cos(θ) = 76, and cos(θ) = 19/9, which is impossible since |cos(θ)| ≤ 1. This means the torus cannot be tangent to the sphere in this fixed position. However, if the torus is translated along the x-axis (or any axis), the centers of the torus's generating circles are at a distance d from the origin. The external tangency condition becomes |d| ± r = 11, where the plus or minus corresponds to the inner or outer edge of the torus tube touching the sphere. Since the torus's major radius is 6, the torus's ring of centers lies on a circle of radius 6 about the z-axis. By shifting the torus along the x-axis, two distinct external tangencies occur when the sphere touches the torus at the inner or outer edge of the tube. These correspond to the torus being tangent to the sphere at two different positions, yielding two tangent circles of different radii r_i and r_o. Therefore, the external tangency conditions are that the distance from the sphere center to the torus center circle is such that the sphere touches the torus at either the inner or outer edge of the tube, mathematically expressed as d = R ± r, and the sphere radius equals the distance from its center to the torus surface at those points, i.e., 11 = d ± r. This yields two distinct tangent circles corresponding to the inner and outer edges of the tube, with radii r_i = R - r and r_o = R + r, respectively, adjusted for the displacement relative to the sphere.

The equation of the torus is (\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} - R)^2 + z^2 = r^2. The sphere S is centered at the origin with radius 11, so its equation is x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 121. External tangency between T and S means that they touch along a curve (in this case, a circle) but do not intersect or overlap. For tangency along a circle, the two surfaces must share a common tangent plane at every point of the circle of contact, and the circle lies on both surfaces. The torus is symmetric about the z-axis, so the tangent circle on the torus lies on a toroidal circle defined by a fixed angle parameter on the revolving circle. The radius of this tangent circle on the torus is given by the distance from the z-axis at that cross-section, which is R + r cos(\\theta), where \\theta is the angle parameter on the minor circle. The sphere\'s radius is fixed at 11. To establish the external tangency conditions, consider the distance d between the center of the sphere (origin) and the center of the circle generating the torus cross-section at angle \\theta. This distance is R + r cos(\\theta). The torus surface points satisfy (\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} - R)^2 + z^2 = r^2, and the sphere points satisfy x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 121. The circle of tangency lies at a fixed z and radius \\rho = R + r cos(\\theta). For the torus to be tangent externally to the sphere along this circle, the distance from the origin to the circle\'s center (\\rho, 0, 0) plus or minus the radius of the circle in the z-direction (r sin(\\theta)) must equal the sphere\'s radius 11. More precisely, the circle of tangency lies where the sphere and torus surfaces coincide and share tangent planes. This leads to the equation: \\sqrt{(R + r cos(\\theta))^2 + (r sin(\\theta))^2} = 11, which simplifies to \\sqrt{R^2 + 2Rr cos(\\theta) + r^2} = 11. Squaring both sides, we get R^2 + 2Rr cos(\\theta) + r^2 = 121. Substituting R=6 and r=3, this becomes 36 + 36 cos(\\theta) + 9 = 121, or 45 + 36 cos(\\theta) = 121, so 36 cos(\\theta) = 76, and cos(\\theta) = 76/36 = 19/9, which is impossible since |cos(\\theta)| ≤ 1. This implies the torus cannot be tangent along the circle generated by the original orientation. However, the torus can be positioned differently relative to the sphere. If the torus is displaced along the x-axis by a distance d, the centers of the torus\'s generating circles are at distance |d| from the origin. The condition for external tangency along a circle then becomes |d| ± r = 11, where the plus or minus corresponds to the inner or outer circle of the torus touching the sphere. Since the major radius is 6, the torus\'s ring of centers lies on a circle of radius 6 about the z-axis. By shifting the torus along the x-axis (or any axis), two distinct external tangencies occur when the sphere touches the torus at the inner or outer edge of the tube. These correspond to the torus being tangent to the sphere at two different positions, yielding two tangent circles of different radii r_i and r_o. Hence, the external tangency conditions are that the distance from the sphere center to the torus center circle is such that the sphere touches the torus at either the inner or outer edge of the tube, mathematically expressed as d = R ± r, and the sphere radius equals the distance from its center to the torus surface at tangency, i.e., 11 = d ± r. This yields two distinct tangent circles corresponding to the inner and outer edges of the tube, with radii r_i = R - r and r_o = R + r, respectively, adjusted for the displacement relative to the sphere. Therefore, the two positions or orientations of the torus relative to the sphere that yield two distinct tangent circles correspond to the torus being tangent at either the inner or outer edge of its tube to the sphere, with the sphere radius equal to the distance from the sphere center to the torus surface at those points.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent 5h94:\nTo establish the conditions for external tangency between the torus T and the sphere S, we first recall their equations and parameters. The torus T is defined by revolving a circle of radius r=3 about the z-axis at a distance R=6 from the axis, so its implicit equation is (\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} - 6)^2 + z^2 = 9. The sphere S is centered at the origin with radius 11, so its equation is x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 121. External tangency means the surfaces touch along a circle, with no penetration. Since the torus is symmetric about the z-axis, consider the torus positioned so that its axis aligns with the z-axis and the sphere is centered at the origin. The torus can be translated along the z-axis to achieve tangency with the sphere. The tangent circle lies where the torus surface and sphere surface coincide and share a tangent plane. The torus surface points satisfy (\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} - 6)^2 + z^2 = 9, and the sphere surface points satisfy x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 121. For tangency along a circle, the two surfaces intersect in a circle, and their normals at points on this circle are parallel. The torus has a tube of radius 3 around the circle of radius 6 in the xy-plane. The sphere radius 11 is larger than the major radius plus minor radius (6 + 3 = 9), so the torus can be externally tangent. The torus can be placed so that its central circle lies at height h along the z-axis. The distance from the sphere center to the torus central circle is |h|. The sphere radius is 11, and the torus tube radius is 3. For tangency, the distance from the sphere center to the torus central circle must satisfy |h| = 11 ± 3, giving two possible positions: h = 14 or h = 8. At h = 14, the torus is tangent to the sphere along a circle of radius r_o on the torus; at h = 8, the torus is tangent along a circle of radius r_i. The radii of tangent circles on the torus are given by the radius of the circle formed by the intersection of the torus tube at height h, which is sqrt(r^2 - (h - z_0)^2) where z_0 is the height of the torus center. Since the torus is shifted along z, the tangent circle radius changes accordingly. Thus, the two tangent circles correspond to the torus shifted up or down by 14 or 8 units. Hence, the conditions for external tangency are that the distance from the sphere center to the torus central circle is either 14 or 8, and the tangent circles have radii corresponding to the cross-section of the torus tube at those heights. These two positions yield two distinct tangent circles with radii r_i and r_o. This reasoning identifies the two possible torus positions and the mathematical conditions for external tangency.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent wkVP:\nWe have a torus T defined by revolving a circle of radius r=3 around the z-axis with the center of the circle at distance R=6 from the z-axis. The torus equation is (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6)^2 + z^2 = 9. The sphere S has radius 11 and is centered at the origin, so its equation is x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 121. External tangency means the torus and sphere touch along a circle without intersecting. Since the torus is symmetric about the z-axis and the sphere is centered at the origin, the torus can be positioned so that its axis aligns with the sphere\'s center. The torus can be translated along the z-axis to touch the sphere externally in two distinct configurations: one where the torus is \'above\' the sphere, and one where it is \'below\' the sphere, each yielding a tangent circle of intersection. To establish the external tangency condition, consider the distance d between the centers of the sphere and the torus\'s central circle. For external tangency along a circle, the distance between the sphere center and the torus center circle must satisfy |d - R| = radius of sphere ± minor radius r of torus, depending on the configuration. More precisely, the torus surface points satisfy (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - R)^2 + z^2 = r^2. The sphere surface points satisfy x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 121. At tangency, the sphere and torus surfaces meet along a circle where these equations hold simultaneously and the normals are parallel. The tangent circle radius on the torus is the distance from the z-axis to the point of tangency on the torus\'s generating circle. The two distinct tangent circles correspond to two distances d where the torus is tangent externally to the sphere, one with the torus shifted \'up\' and one \'down\' along the z-axis. These positions correspond to the torus\'s center circle being at height h such that the sphere and torus meet tangentially. Hence, the external tangency conditions can be expressed as (d - R)^2 + z^2 = r^2 and x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 121 with a common tangent circle, leading to equations relating d, R, r, and 11. The two distinct tangent circles emerge from the two possible values of d (or height h) satisfying these conditions, giving two tangent circles with radii r_i and r_o on the torus. Thus, the external tangency conditions are established by solving the system of equations representing the torus and sphere surfaces with the constraint of tangency, yielding two distinct solutions corresponding to the two tangent circles.\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 2: Synthesize and choose the most consistent and correct solutions for the tangency conditions. \n\n then justify completely and detailedly, step-by-step why you think so in the "thinking" entry. \n                If stuck in loop, stop this reasoning.\n                Again, your task is only to answer the question Sub-task 2: Synthesize and choose the most consistent and correct solutions for the tangency conditions. and explaination your thinking.\n                Follow the instruction step-by-step.

For the torus to be tangent externally to the sphere along this circle, the distance from the origin to the circle\'s center (\\rho, 0, 0) plus or minus the radius of the circle in the z-direction (r sin(\\theta)) must equal the sphere\'s radius 11. More precisely, the circle of tangency lies where the sphere and torus surfaces coincide and share tangent planes. This leads to the equation: \\sqrt{(R + r cos(\\theta))^2 + (r sin(\\theta))^2} = 11, which simplifies to \\sqrt{R^2 + 2Rr cos(\\theta) + r^2} = 11. Squaring both sides, we get R^2 + 2Rr cos(\\theta) + r^2 = 121. Substituting R=6 and r=3, this becomes 36 + 36 cos(\\theta) + 9 = 121, or 45 + 36 cos(\\theta) = 121, so 36 cos(\\theta) = 76, and cos(\\theta) = 76/36 = 19/9, which is impossible since |cos(\\theta)| ≤ 1. This implies the torus cannot be tangent along the circle generated by the original orientation. However, the torus can be positioned differently relative to the sphere. If the torus is displaced along the x-axis by a distance d, the centers of the torus\'s generating circles are at distance |d| from the origin. The condition for external tangency along a circle then becomes |d| ± r = 11, where the plus or minus corresponds to the inner or outer circle of the torus touching the sphere. Since the major radius is 6, the torus\'s ring of centers lies on a circle of radius 6 about the z-axis. By shifting the torus along the x-axis (or any axis), two distinct external tangencies occur when the sphere touches the torus at the inner or outer edge of the tube. These correspond to the torus being tangent to the sphere at two different positions, yielding two tangent circles of different radii r_i and r_o. Hence, the external tangency conditions are that the distance from the sphere center to the torus center circle is such that the sphere touches the torus at either the inner or outer edge of the tube, mathematically expressed as d = R ± r, and the sphere radius equals the distance from its center to the torus surface at tangency, i.e., 11 = d ± r. This yields two distinct tangent circles corresponding to the inner and outer edges of the tube, with radii r_i = R - r and r_o = R + r, respectively, adjusted for the displacement relative to the sphere. Therefore, the two positions or orientations of the torus relative to the sphere that yield two distinct tangent circles correspond to the torus being tangent at either the inner or outer edge of its tube to the sphere, with the sphere radius equal to the distance from the sphere center to the torus surface at those points.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent 5h94:\nTo establish the conditions for external tangency between the torus T and the sphere S, we first recall their equations and parameters. The torus T is defined by revolving a circle of radius r=3 about the z-axis at a distance R=6 from the axis, so its implicit equation is (\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} - 6)^2 + z^2 = 9. The sphere S is centered at the origin with radius 11, so its equation is x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 121. External tangency means the surfaces touch along a circle, with no penetration. Since the torus is symmetric about the z-axis, consider the torus positioned so that its axis aligns with the z-axis and the sphere is centered at the origin. The torus can be translated along the z-axis to achieve tangency with the sphere. The tangent circle lies where the torus surface and sphere surface coincide and share a tangent plane. The torus surface points satisfy (\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} - 6)^2 + z^2 = 9, and the sphere surface points satisfy x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 121. For tangency along a circle, the two surfaces intersect in a circle, and their normals at points on this circle are parallel. The torus has a tube of radius 3 around the circle of radius 6 in the xy-plane. The sphere radius 11 is larger than the major radius plus minor radius (6 + 3 = 9), so the torus can be externally tangent. The torus can be placed so that its central circle lies at height h along the z-axis. The distance from the sphere center to the torus central circle is |h|. The sphere radius is 11, and the torus tube radius is 3. For tangency, the distance from the sphere center to the torus central circle must satisfy |h| = 11 ± 3, giving two possible positions: h = 14 or h = 8. At h = 14, the torus is tangent to the sphere along a circle of radius r_o on the torus; at h = 8, the torus is tangent along a circle of radius r_i. The radii of tangent circles on the torus are given by the radius of the circle formed by the intersection of the torus tube at height h, which is sqrt(r^2 - (h - z_0)^2) where z_0 is the height of the torus center. Since the torus is shifted along z, the tangent circle radius changes accordingly. Thus, the two tangent circles correspond to the torus shifted up or down by 14 or 8 units. Hence, the conditions for external tangency are that the distance from the sphere center to the torus central circle is either 14 or 8, and the tangent circles have radii corresponding to the cross-section of the torus tube at those heights. These two positions yield two distinct tangent circles with radii r_i and r_o. This reasoning identifies the two possible torus positions and the mathematical conditions for external tangency.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent wkVP:\nWe have a torus T defined by revolving a circle of radius r=3 around the z-axis with the center of the circle at distance R=6 from the z-axis. The torus equation is (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6)^2 + z^2 = 9. The sphere S has radius 11 and is centered at the origin, so its equation is x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 121. External tangency means the torus and sphere touch along a circle without intersecting. Since the torus is symmetric about the z-axis and the sphere is centered at the origin, the torus can be positioned so that its axis aligns with the sphere\'s center. The torus can be translated along the z-axis to touch the sphere externally in two distinct configurations: one where the torus is \'above\' the sphere, and one where it is \'below\' the sphere, each yielding a tangent circle of intersection. To establish the external tangency condition, consider the distance d between the centers of the sphere and the torus\'s central circle. For external tangency along a circle, the distance between the sphere center and the torus center circle must satisfy |d - R| = radius of sphere ± minor radius r of torus, depending on the configuration. More precisely, the torus surface points satisfy (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - R)^2 + z^2 = r^2. The sphere surface points satisfy x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 121. At tangency, the sphere and torus surfaces meet along a circle where these equations hold simultaneously and the normals are parallel. The tangent circle radius on the torus is the distance from the z-axis to the point of tangency on the torus\'s generating circle. The two distinct tangent circles correspond to two distances d where the torus is tangent externally to the sphere, one with the torus shifted \'up\' and one \'down\' along the z-axis. These positions correspond to the torus\'s center circle being at height h such that the sphere and torus meet tangentially. Hence, the external tangency conditions can be expressed as (d - R)^2 + z^2 = r^2 and x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 121 with a common tangent circle, leading to equations relating d, R, r, and 11. The two distinct tangent circles emerge from the two possible values of d (or height h) satisfying these conditions, giving two tangent circles with radii r_i and r_o on the torus. Thus, the external tangency conditions are established by solving the system of equations representing the torus and sphere surfaces with the constraint of tangency, yielding two distinct solutions corresponding to the two tangent circles.\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 2: Synthesize and choose the most consistent and correct solutions for the tangency conditions. \n\n then justify completely and detailedly, step-by-step why you think so in the "thinking" entry. \n                If stuck in loop, stop this reasoning.\n                Again, your task is only to answer the question Sub-task 2: Synthesize and choose the most consistent and correct solutions for the tangency conditions. and explaination your thinking.\n                Follow the instruction step-by-step.

Because the torus is symmetric about the z-axis, the tangent circle lies on a toroidal circle defined by a fixed angle parameter on the minor circle. The radius of this tangent circle on the torus is R + r cos(θ), where θ is the angle parameter on the minor circle. The distance from the origin to the center of the circle generating the torus cross-section at angle θ is R + r cos(θ). The torus surface points satisfy (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - R)^2 + z^2 = r^2, and the sphere points satisfy x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 121.

The distance from the origin to any point on this circle is sqrt((R + r cos(θ))^2 + (r sin(θ))^2) = sqrt(R^2 + 2Rr cos(θ) + r^2). Setting this equal to 11 (the sphere radius) and squaring gives R^2 + 2Rr cos(θ) + r^2 = 121. Substituting R=6 and r=3 yields 36 + 36 cos(θ) + 9 = 121, or 45 + 36 cos(θ) = 121, so 36 cos(θ) = 76, and cos(θ) = 19/9, which is impossible since |cos(θ)| ≤ 1. This means the torus cannot be tangent to the sphere in this fixed position. However, if the torus is translated along the x-axis (or any axis), the centers of the torus's generating circles are at a distance d from the origin. The external tangency condition becomes |d| ± r = 11, where the plus or minus corresponds to the inner or outer edge of the torus tube touching the sphere.

The distance from the origin (center of the sphere) to any point on this circle is sqrt((R + r cos(θ))^2 + (r sin(θ))^2) = sqrt(R^2 + 2Rr cos(θ) + r^2). For external tangency along a circle, this distance equals the sphere radius 11, so R^2 + 2Rr cos(θ) + r^2 = 121. Solving for cos(θ) gives cos(θ) = (121 - R^2 - r^2) / (2 R r).

The sphere S has radius 11. The torus can be externally tangent to the sphere along a circle on its surface. The radius of such a tangent circle on the torus is given by the distance from the axis of revolution to the circle, which is R + r cos(θ), where θ is the angle parameter on the minor circle of the torus. The torus surface points satisfy (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - R)^2 + z^2 = r^2, and the sphere points satisfy x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 11^2 = 121. The distance from the origin (center of the sphere) to the center of the generating circle of the torus at angle θ is R + r cos(θ), and the radius of the circle in the z-direction is r sin(θ). The distance from the origin to any point on this circle is sqrt((R + r cos(θ))^2 + (r sin(θ))^2) = sqrt(R^2 + 2Rr cos(θ) + r^2). For external tangency along a circle, this distance equals the sphere radius, 11. Hence, the key equation is: sqrt(R^2 + 2Rr cos(θ) + r^2) = 11, or equivalently R^2 + 2Rr cos(θ) + r^2 = 121. Solving for cos(θ) yields cos(θ) = (121 - R^2 - r^2) / (2 R r). The tangent circle radius on the torus surface is then r_tangent = R + r cos(θ). Since the torus can be tangent to the sphere in two distinct ways (inner and outer edges of the tube), these correspond to two values of θ giving two tangent circle radii r_i and r_o. Therefore, the radii of the tangent circles r_i and r_o satisfy: r_i = R + r cos(θ_i), r_o = R + r cos(θ_o), where cos(θ_i) and cos(θ_o) are the two solutions of the equation R^2 + 2Rr cos(θ) + r^2 = 121. Thus, the difference r_i - r_o = r (cos(θ_i) - cos(θ_o)) can be found once the cosines are determined from the geometry. This sets up the equations relating the radii of the tangent circles to the torus parameters R, r and the sphere radius 11, completing the expression of r_i and r_o in terms of the given parameters.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent KPti:\nThe torus T is generated by revolving a circle of radius r = 3 around an axis at a distance R = 6 from the center of the circle, so the torus has major radius R = 6 and minor radius r = 3.

The radius of a circle of constant angle θ on the minor circle of the torus is given by the distance from the axis of revolution to the center of the small circle plus the radius of that small circle times cos(θ), i.e., radius of the circle of tangency on the torus is R + r cos(θ). The torus is tangent to the sphere along a circle where the sphere radius equals the distance from the origin to the points of the torus on that circle. The distance from the origin to a point on the torus at angle θ is sqrt((R + r cos(θ))^2 + (r sin(θ))^2) = sqrt(R^2 + 2Rr cos(θ) + r^2). Setting this equal to 11 (sphere radius) and squaring gives R^2 + 2Rr cos(θ) + r^2 = 121. Substituting R=6 and r=3 yields 36 + 36 cos(θ) + 9 = 121, or 45 + 36 cos(θ) = 121, so 36 cos(θ) = 76, cos(θ) = 19/9, which is impossible since |cos(θ)| ≤ 1. This means the torus cannot be tangent to the sphere without translation. By translating the torus so that the center circle of the torus is at distance d from the origin, the external tangency condition becomes |d| ± r = 11, where the ± corresponds to the inner or outer edge of the tube touching the sphere. Thus, the two tangent circles correspond to the torus being tangent at the inner edge (radius r_i = R - r) and outer edge (radius r_o = R + r) of the tube, with the sphere radius equal to the distance from the sphere center to the torus surface at those points. Therefore, the radii of the tangent circles on the torus surface are r_i = R - r and r_o = R + r, with the external tangency condition setting the distance from the sphere center to the torus center circle as d = 11 ∓ r.

The sphere S has radius 11. The torus can be externally tangent to the sphere along a circle on its surface. The radius of such a tangent circle on the torus is given by the distance from the axis of revolution to the circle, which is R + r cos(θ), where θ is the angle parameter on the minor circle of the torus. The torus surface points satisfy (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - R)^2 + z^2 = r^2, and the sphere points satisfy x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 11^2 = 121. The distance from the origin (center of the sphere) to the center of the generating circle of the torus at angle θ is R + r cos(θ), and the radius of the circle in the z-direction is r sin(θ). The distance from the origin to any point on this circle is sqrt((R + r cos(θ))^2 + (r sin(θ))^2) = sqrt(R^2 + 2Rr cos(θ) + r^2). For external tangency along a circle, this distance equals the sphere radius, 11. Hence, the key equation is: sqrt(R^2 + 2Rr cos(θ) + r^2) = 11, or equivalently R^2 + 2Rr cos(θ) + r^2 = 121. Solving for cos(θ) yields cos(θ) = (121 - R^2 - r^2) / (2 R r). The tangent circle radius on the torus surface is then r_tangent = R + r cos(θ). Since the torus can be tangent to the sphere in two distinct ways (inner and outer edges of the tube), these correspond to two values of θ giving two tangent circle radii r_i and r_o. Therefore, the radii of the tangent circles r_i and r_o satisfy: r_i = R + r cos(θ_i), r_o = R + r cos(θ_o), where cos(θ_i) and cos(θ_o) are the two solutions of the equation R^2 + 2Rr cos(θ) + r^2 = 121. Thus, the difference r_i - r_o = r (cos(θ_i) - cos(θ_o)) can be found once the cosines are determined from the geometry. This sets up the equations relating the radii of the tangent circles to the torus parameters R, r and the sphere radius 11, completing the expression of r_i and r_o in terms of the given parameters.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent KPti:\nThe torus T is generated by revolving a circle of radius r = 3 around an axis at a distance R = 6 from the center of the circle, so the torus has major radius R = 6 and minor radius r = 3. The sphere S has radius 11. The torus and sphere are externally tangent along a circle on the torus surface. The torus surface points satisfy (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - R)^2 + z^2 = r^2. The radius of a circle of constant angle θ on the minor circle of the torus is given by the distance from the axis of revolution to the center of the small circle plus the radius of that small circle times cos(θ), i.e., radius of the circle of tangency on the torus is R + r cos(θ). The torus is tangent to the sphere along a circle where the sphere radius equals the distance from the origin to the points of the torus on that circle. The distance from the origin to a point on the torus at angle θ is sqrt((R + r cos(θ))^2 + (r sin(θ))^2) = sqrt(R^2 + 2Rr cos(θ) + r^2). Setting this equal to 11 (sphere radius) and squaring gives R^2 + 2Rr cos(θ) + r^2 = 121. Substituting R=6 and r=3 yields 36 + 36 cos(θ) + 9 = 121, or 45 + 36 cos(θ) = 121, so 36 cos(θ) = 76, cos(θ) = 19/9, which is impossible since |cos(θ)| ≤ 1. This means the torus cannot be tangent to the sphere without translation. By translating the torus so that the center circle of the torus is at distance d from the origin, the external tangency condition becomes |d| ± r = 11, where the ± corresponds to the inner or outer edge of the tube touching the sphere. Thus, the two tangent circles correspond to the torus being tangent at the inner edge (radius r_i = R - r) and outer edge (radius r_o = R + r) of the tube, with the sphere radius equal to the distance from the sphere center to the torus surface at those points. Therefore, the radii of the tangent circles on the torus surface are r_i = R - r and r_o = R + r, with the external tangency condition setting the distance from the sphere center to the torus center circle as d = 11 ∓ r. These equations relate the tangent circle radii to the torus parameters R and r and the sphere radius 11.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent pwvC:\nThe torus T is generated by revolving a circle of radius r = 3 around an axis at a distance R = 6 from the center of the circle.

The distance from the origin (center of the sphere) to any point on this circle is sqrt((R + r cos(\\theta))^2 + (r sin(\\theta))^2) = sqrt(R^2 + 2Rr cos(\\theta) + r^2). For external tangency along a circle, this distance should equal the sphere radius 11, so R^2 + 2Rr cos(\\theta) + r^2 = 11^2 = 121.

This implies the torus cannot be tangent to the sphere centered at the origin without translation. Considering the torus translated so its center circle is at distance d from the sphere center, the tangency occurs when the sphere of radius 11 is tangent to the inner or outer edge of the torus tube, i.e., when d ± r = 11.

When the torus is translated so that the center circle is at distance d from the sphere center, the tangency condition becomes |d ± r| = 11, where ± corresponds to the inner or outer edge of the tube touching the sphere. This means the torus can be tangent in two configurations: one where the inner edge of the tube touches the sphere (d + r = 11) and one where the outer edge touches it (d - r = 11). In these configurations, the radii of the tangent circles on the torus surface correspond to the radii of the circles formed by the minor circle at angles where the tube contacts the sphere, which are r_i = R - r and r_o = R + r, representing the inner and outer radii of the torus tube. Hence, the explicit formulas for the radii of the tangent circles are r_i = R - r and r_o = R + r.

The sphere has radius 11. The torus surface satisfies (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - R)^2 + z^2 = r^2. A circle on the torus at angle \\theta on the minor circle has radius R + r cos(\\theta). The distance from the origin (center of the sphere) to any point on this circle is sqrt((R + r cos(\\theta))^2 + (r sin(\\theta))^2) = sqrt(R^2 + 2Rr cos(\\theta) + r^2). For external tangency along a circle, this distance should equal the sphere radius 11, so R^2 + 2Rr cos(\\theta) + r^2 = 11^2 = 121. Solving for cos(\\theta) gives cos(\\theta) = (121 - R^2 - r^2) / (2 R r). Substituting R=6 and r=3, cos(\\theta) = (121 - 36 - 9) / (2 * 6 * 3) = 76 / 36 = 19/9, which is >1, impossible for cosine. This implies the torus cannot be tangent to the sphere centered at the origin without translation. Considering the torus translated so its center circle is at distance d from the sphere center, the tangency occurs when the sphere of radius 11 is tangent to the inner or outer edge of the torus tube, i.e., when d ± r = 11. The torus tube radii circles have radii r_i = R - r (inner edge) and r_o = R + r (outer edge). Hence, the tangent circles on the torus surface have radii r_i = 6 - 3 = 3 and r_o = 6 + 3 = 9. These correspond to the two tangent configurations: one where the torus is tangent via its inner tube edge, and one via its outer tube edge. Thus, the explicit formulas for the tangent circle radii are r_i = R - r and r_o = R + r, derived from the torus geometry and tangency conditions with the sphere, distinguishing the two tangent configurations by whether the inner or outer tube edge is tangent to the sphere.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent BSkM:\nThe torus T is generated by revolving a circle of radius r=3 around an axis at distance R=6, so the torus has major radius R=6 and minor radius r=3. The sphere S has radius 11. The torus surface points satisfy the equation (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - R)^2 + z^2 = r^2. A circle on the torus corresponding to a fixed angle θ on the minor circle has radius R + r cos(θ). The distance from the origin (center of the sphere) to any point on this circle is sqrt((R + r cos(θ))^2 + (r sin(θ))^2) = sqrt(R^2 + 2Rr cos(θ) + r^2). For the torus to be tangent externally to the sphere along such a circle, the radius of this circle from the origin must equal the sphere radius 11, so we have R^2 + 2Rr cos(θ) + r^2 = 11^2 = 121. Solving for cos(θ) gives cos(θ) = (121 - R^2 - r^2) / (2 R r). Substituting R=6 and r=3, we get cos(θ) = (121 - 36 - 9) / (36) = 76/36 = 19/9, which is greater than 1 and impossible. This indicates the torus must be translated relative to the sphere to achieve tangency. When the torus is translated so that the center circle is at distance d from the sphere center, the tangency condition becomes |d ± r| = 11, where ± corresponds to the inner or outer edge of the tube touching the sphere. This means the torus can be tangent in two configurations: one where the inner edge of the tube touches the sphere (d + r = 11) and one where the outer edge touches it (d - r = 11). In these configurations, the radii of the tangent circles on the torus surface correspond to the radii of the circles formed by the minor circle at angles where the tube contacts the sphere, which are r_i = R - r and r_o = R + r, representing the inner and outer radii of the torus tube. Hence, the explicit formulas for the radii of the tangent circles are r_i = R - r and r_o = R + r. These correspond to the two tangent configurations distinguished by the torus\'s position relative to the sphere. This conclusion is consistent with the torus and sphere geometry and the external tangency condition after translation.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent fQBB:\nWe start with a torus defined by revolving a circle of radius r=3 around an axis at distance R=6. The torus surface satisfies (\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} - R)^2 + z^2 = r^2. The sphere has radius 11. To find the tangent circles on the torus when it rests externally tangent to the sphere, we consider the circle on the torus parameterized by angle \\theta on the minor circle. The radius of such a circle in the xy-plane is R + r cos(\\theta). The vertical displacement is r sin(\\theta). The distance from the origin (center of the sphere) to any point on this circle is then \\sqrt{(R + r \\cos \\theta)^2 + (r \\sin \\theta)^2} = \\sqrt{R^2 + 2 R r \\cos \\theta + r^2}.

Plugging in R=6, r=3, we get \\cos \\theta = (121 - 36 - 9) / (2*6*3) = 76 / 36 = 19/9, which is impossible since cosine must be between -1 and 1. This means the torus must be translated relative to the sphere center for tangency. When the torus is translated so that the center circle is at distance d from the sphere center, the tangency condition becomes |d \\pm r| = 11, where the \\pm corresponds to inner or outer edge of the tube touching the sphere. The radii of the tangent circles on the torus surface correspond to the distances from the axis of revolution: r_i = R - r and r_o = R + r. These represent the inner and outer radii of the torus tube. Thus, the two tangent circles have radii r_i = 6 - 3 = 3 and r_o = 6 + 3 = 9. These formulas arise naturally from the torus geometry and the external tangency condition, distinguishing the two tangent configurations by which edge of the tube touches the sphere.

However, the problem involves a sphere of radius 11 tangent externally to the torus, and the tangent circles are formed by the intersection of the torus and the sphere. The radii r_i and r_o are the radii of these tangent circles on the torus surface, which depend on the position of tangency and the geometry of the sphere and torus together. The difference r_i - r_o is not simply 3 - 9 = -6. The problem requires a more detailed geometric analysis involving the distance between the centers and the radii of the sphere and torus, and the conditions for external tangency along a circle.

Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.\n\nDetailed Analysis: \n1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:\n- A torus T is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis in the plane of the circle, at a distance 6 from the circle\'s center. This creates a standard torus with major radius R = 6 and minor radius r = 3.\n- A sphere S has radius 11.\n- The torus T is placed externally tangent to the sphere S in two different configurations, each time tangent along a circle on the torus surface.\n- In these two configurations, the radii of the tangent circles on the torus are denoted r_i and r_o.\n- The problem asks for the difference r_i - r_o expressed as a reduced fraction m/n, and then to find m + n.\n\nObjective: Determine the difference between the radii of the two tangent circles formed by the torus when it rests externally tangent to the sphere in two distinct ways.\n\n2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:\n- The torus is defined by two radii: the major radius R = 6 (distance from the center of the tube to the axis of revolution) and the minor radius r = 3 (radius of the revolving circle).\n- The sphere of radius 11 is fixed.\n- External tangency implies the torus and sphere touch without intersection, along a circle on the torus surface.\n- The two tangent circles correspond to two different positions or orientations of the torus relative to the sphere.\n- The radii r_i and r_o correspond to the radii of these tangent circles on the torus surface, which depend on the geometry of the torus and the point(s) of contact with the sphere.\n- The difference r_i - r_o is a measure of how these tangent circles differ in size, reflecting the geometric constraints imposed by the sphere\'s radius and the torus\'s dimensions.\n\n3. Identify the Field of Study:\n- The problem lies primarily in geometry, specifically in 3D geometry involving surfaces of revolution.\n- Concepts involved include the geometry of tori and spheres, external tangency conditions, and circle radii on curved surfaces.\n- This problem is typical in mathematical competitions and advanced geometry contexts.\n\n4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:\n- The problem states "when T rests on the outside of S" twice, which may be a typographical repetition; presumably, the two tangent configurations differ in orientation or position.\n- The exact nature of the two tangent circles (r_i and r_o) is not explicitly described; it is implied they correspond to two distinct tangent positions.\n- The problem assumes knowledge of how to find the radii of circles of tangency on a torus when tangent to a sphere, which may require assumptions about the torus\'s orientation.\n- It is reasonable to assume the torus is oriented so that its axis of revolution is aligned in a way that allows two distinct external tangencies with the sphere.\n- The problem does not specify the location of the torus relative to the sphere beyond external tangency, so one may assume standard positioning to analyze the problem..These are just pieces of information related to the question.

The sphere S has radius 11. The problem states that when the torus rests externally tangent to the sphere, it is tangent along a circle on the torus surface. There are two such tangent circles, with radii r_i and r_o. These correspond to the inner and outer edges of the torus tube, which have radii R - r and R + r respectively. Thus, r_i = 6 - 3 = 3 and r_o = 6 + 3 = 9. The difference r_i - r_o = 3 - 9 = -6. Since the problem requires the difference expressed as a positive fraction m/n with relatively prime positive integers, we take the absolute value to get 6/1. The fraction 6/1 is already in lowest terms because 6 and 1 share no common factors other than 1. Therefore, m = 6 and n = 1, and m + n = 7. This reasoning is consistent with the geometry of the torus and sphere and matches the interpretations given by other agents. Hence, the final simplified fraction for the difference r_i - r_o is 6/1, and the sum m + n is 7.\n\n### Sub-task 7: Calculate the sum m + n from the simplified fraction and provide the final answer as requested by the problem.Given previous attempts and feedback, carefully consider where you could go wrong in your latest attempt. Using insights from previous attempts, try to solve the task better. \n\n ### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent FLgI (yourself):\nThe problem involves a torus with major radius R = 6 and minor radius r = 3, and a sphere with radius 11. The torus is externally tangent to the sphere along two distinct circles on its surface, with radii r_i and r_o. The problem asks for the difference r_i - r_o expressed as a reduced fraction m/n, and then to find m + n.\n\nFrom the geometry of the torus, the radii of the circles on the torus surface vary between R - r and R + r, i.e., between 3 and 9. The two tangent circles correspond to these two extremes, so r_i = 3 and r_o = 9 (or vice versa). The difference is r_i - r_o = 3 - 9 = -6. Taking the absolute value (since the problem expects a positive fraction), we get 6/1.\n\nThe fraction 6/1 is already in lowest terms since 6 and 1 share no common factors other than 1. Therefore, m = 6 and n = 1, and the sum m + n = 7.\n\nThis conclusion is consistent with the problem\'s geometric setup and the interpretation of the tangent circles on the torus surface. Hence, the final answer is 7.\n\n### Please review the answer above and criticize on where might be wrong. If you are absolutely sure it is correct, output exactly \'True\' in \'correct\' \n\n ### feedback #1 by Critic Agent uVFG:\nThe answer incorrectly assumes that the two tangent circles correspond simply to the minimum and maximum radii of the torus cross-section, i.e., R - r = 3 and R + r = 9. However, the problem involves a sphere of radius 11 tangent externally to the torus, and the tangent circles are formed by the intersection of the torus and the sphere. The radii r_i and r_o are the radii of these tangent circles on the torus surface, which depend on the position of tangency and the geometry of the sphere and torus together. The difference r_i - r_o is not simply 3 - 9 = -6. The problem requires a more detailed geometric analysis involving the distance between the centers and the radii of the sphere and torus, and the conditions for external tangency along a circle. Therefore, the conclusion that m + n = 7 is not justified by the reasoning given. The answer oversimplifies the problem and does not correctly find the tangent circle radii or their difference.\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 7: Calculate the sum m + n from the simplified fraction and provide the final answer as requested by the problem.Given previous attempts and feedback, carefully consider where you could go wrong in your latest attempt. Using insights from previous attempts, try to solve the task better. \n\n then justify completely and detailedly, step-by-step why you think so in the "thinking" entry. \n                If stuck in loop, stop this reasoning.\n                Again, your task is only to answer the question Sub-task 7: Calculate the sum m + n from the simplified fraction and provide the final answer as requested by the problem.Given previous attempts and feedback, carefully consider where you could go wrong in your latest attempt.

[{'combined_feedback': "The primary failure occurs from Sub-task 2 onward, where the geometric reasoning oversimplifies the torus–sphere tangency conditions. Specifically, the agents reduce the external tangency condition to trivial equalities (d = R ± r and 11 = d ± r), ignoring the necessary translation of the torus tube center and the angle θ at which the sphere and torus surfaces meet. This leads to incorrect assumptions that the tangent circles correspond simply to the inner and outer radii of the torus tube (r_i = R - r and r_o = R + r), which do not incorporate the sphere's radius or the relative positioning of the torus and sphere. Consequently, the final computed difference r_i - r_o is incorrect (-6 instead of the correct 3/2), causing the final answer to be wrong. Additionally, the workflow passes only the agents' reasoning text without carrying forward critical numeric values and formulas, resulting in loss of essential geometric constraints in later subtasks. The use of multiple SC_CoT agents repeating the same flawed reasoning without stronger guidance or validation allows the error to propagate unchecked. The agent collaboration pattern (CoT, SC_CoT, Debate, Reflexion) is structurally sound but lacks explicit enforcement of geometric constraints and validation checks, such as verifying that computed cosine values lie within valid ranges. Overall, the problem stems from an oversimplified model of the geometry, insufficient context passing, and inadequate validation within the agent workflow.", 'combined_suggestion': "To correct the reasoning and improve the workflow, implement the following detailed modifications:\n\n1. Refine Sub-task Structure:\n   - Break down the geometry into clearer subtasks: (a) compute the translation distance d of the torus tube center from the sphere center, and (b) solve for the angle θ where the torus and sphere surfaces are tangent, using the equation √((d + r cos θ)² + (r sin θ)²) = 11.\n   - Introduce an intermediate subtask between Sub-tasks 2 and 3 to explicitly analyze and compute possible displacements of the torus relative to the sphere that allow external tangency.\n\n2. Enhance Sub-task Instructions:\n   - In Sub-task 2, explicitly instruct agents to derive d from external tangency conditions at both inner and outer tube edges (i.e., solve d ± r = 11).\n   - In Sub-tasks 3 and 4, require agents to incorporate the sphere radius and relative positioning into tangent circle radius calculations, emphasizing that tangent circles are not simply R ± r but depend on intersection geometry.\n\n3. Improve Context Passing:\n   - Ensure that numeric values and formal definitions of R, r, d, and the tangency equation are passed explicitly between subtasks, not just the reasoning text.\n   - Pass the output of Sub-task 2 (including displacement and tangency conditions) explicitly into Sub-task 3 and subsequent subtasks to maintain critical geometric constraints.\n\n4. Strengthen Agent Collaboration and Validation:\n   - Replace or reduce the SC_CoT ensemble stage with a single Chain-of-Thought (CoT) agent given clear directives to solve for θ and compute r_i = |d + r cos θ_i| and r_o = |d + r cos θ_o|.\n   - Implement explicit validation checks in final decision agents to verify that computed cosine values lie within the valid range [–1, 1]; if not, prompt agents to reconsider assumptions or include translations.\n   - Introduce earlier and more iterative Reflexion or Debate stages starting from Sub-task 3 to challenge oversimplified assumptions and enforce consideration of sphere radius and displacement effects.\n\n5. Update Final Computation and Workflow Code:\n   - In Sub-task 7, compute the final difference r_i - r_o using the corrected tangent circle radii derived from refined geometric analysis.\n   - Adjust agent prompting and temperature settings to encourage deeper geometric reasoning and validation.\n   - Modify workflow code to explicitly pass displacement and sphere radius constraints forward and insert the additional displacement analysis subtask.\n\nThese changes will ensure the agents correctly model the torus–sphere tangency geometry, maintain critical constraints throughout subtasks, validate intermediate results, and ultimately produce the accurate final answer consistent with the problem's complexity."}]

The sphere has radius 11 and is centered at the origin. The torus tube center circle lies in the xy-plane at radius R=6 from the z-axis. When the torus is displaced along the z-axis by a distance d, the center of the tube circle is at height z=d. The points on the tube circle can be parameterized by an angle θ, where the coordinates of a point on the tube circle are (R, 0, d) + (r cos θ, 0, r sin θ) in the plane of the tube circle. Since the torus is symmetric about the z-axis, the distance from the origin to a point on the tube circle is sqrt((R)^2 + (d + r cos θ)^2 + (r sin θ)^2). However, for the purpose of tangency, we focus on the distance from the sphere center to points on the tube circle along the axis of revolution. The key is to find the values of d such that the torus is tangent to the sphere externally. The external tangency condition implies that the distance from the sphere center to the tube circle center plus or minus the tube radius equals the sphere radius. This gives two equations: d + r = 11 and d - r = 11. Solving these yields d = 11 - r = 8 and d = 11 + r = 14.

A natural choice is a 3D Cartesian coordinate system (x, y, z) with the z-axis as the axis of revolution for the torus. The torus T is generated by revolving a circle of radius r = 3 centered at (R, 0) in the xy-plane around the z-axis, where R = 6 is the major radius (distance from the center of the tube to the axis of revolution). The standard implicit equation of such a torus is (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - R)^2 + z^2 = r^2, or equivalently, (x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + R^2 - r^2)^2 = 4R^2(x^2 + y^2). This equation describes all points (x, y, z) on the torus surface. The sphere S with radius 11 is centered at the origin (0, 0, 0) for simplicity, and its equation is x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 11^2 = 121. External tangency between T and S means that the two surfaces touch at one or more points without intersecting or overlapping. Since the torus is a surface of revolution with a circular cross-section, the tangency occurs along a circle on the torus surface. This circle of tangency lies on both surfaces, meaning every point on this circle satisfies both the torus and sphere equations, and the surfaces share a common tangent plane at each point of this circle.

Establish coordinate systems and geometric representations for both surfaces. Clearly state the meaning of external tangency between T and S, emphasizing that the torus touches the sphere along a circle on its surface without intersection. Prepare the framework for detailed geometric analysis. \n\n ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent Ud8O:\nTo formally define the torus T and the sphere S, we start by choosing a coordinate system that simplifies the description of both surfaces. A natural choice is a 3D Cartesian coordinate system (x, y, z) with the z-axis as the axis of revolution for the torus. The torus T is generated by revolving a circle of radius r = 3 centered at (R, 0) in the xy-plane around the z-axis, where R = 6 is the major radius (distance from the center of the tube to the axis of revolution). The standard implicit equation of such a torus is (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - R)^2 + z^2 = r^2, or equivalently, (x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + R^2 - r^2)^2 = 4R^2(x^2 + y^2). This equation describes all points (x, y, z) on the torus surface. The sphere S with radius 11 is centered at the origin (0, 0, 0) for simplicity, and its equation is x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 11^2 = 121. External tangency between T and S means that the two surfaces touch at one or more points without intersecting or overlapping. Since the torus is a surface of revolution with a circular cross-section, the tangency occurs along a circle on the torus surface. This circle of tangency lies on both surfaces, meaning every point on this circle satisfies both the torus and sphere equations, and the surfaces share a common tangent plane at each point of this circle. The framework for detailed geometric analysis involves using these equations to find the positions and radii of the tangent circles on the torus when it rests externally tangent to the sphere. This setup allows us to analyze the conditions for tangency and to compute the radii r_i and r_o of the tangent circles, which are the radii of the cross-sectional circles of the torus at the points of contact with the sphere. This formal definition and coordinate setup provide a clear geometric context for further analysis of the problem.\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 2: Derive the mathematical condition for external tangency between the torus and the sphere by introducing the displacement distance d of the torus tube center from the sphere center along the axis of revolution.

The sphere has radius 11 and is centered at the origin. The torus tube center circle lies in the xy-plane at radius R=6 from the z-axis. When the torus is displaced along the z-axis by a distance d, the center of the tube circle is at height z=d. The points on the tube circle can be parameterized by an angle θ, where the coordinates of a point on the tube circle are (R, 0, d) + (r cos θ, 0, r sin θ) in the plane of the tube circle. Since the torus is symmetric about the z-axis, the distance from the origin to a point on the tube circle is sqrt((R)^2 + (d + r cos θ)^2 + (r sin θ)^2). However, for the purpose of tangency, we focus on the distance from the sphere center to points on the tube circle along the axis of revolution. The key is to find the values of d such that the torus is tangent to the sphere externally. The external tangency condition implies that the distance from the sphere center to the tube circle center plus or minus the tube radius equals the sphere radius. This gives two equations: d + r = 11 and d - r = 11. Solving these yields d = 11 - r = 8 and d = 11 + r = 14.

The torus is displaced along the axis of revolution by a distance d. The tangency condition between the torus and sphere can be analyzed by looking at the distance from the sphere center to points on the torus tube circle. The key tangency equation is sqrt((d + r cos θ)^2 + (r sin θ)^2) = 11, where θ parameterizes points on the tube circle. Simplifying inside the square root gives sqrt(d^2 + 2 d r cos θ + r^2) = 11. For tangency, this equation must hold for some θ in [0, 2π]. The minimum and maximum values of the left side as θ varies are at cos θ = ±1, giving distances |d - r| and |d + r| respectively. External tangency requires that the sphere radius 11 equals either d + r or |d - r| (since the tube circle lies a distance d from the sphere center along the axis). Thus, two candidate values for d arise: d + r = 11 => d = 11 - 3 = 8, and d - r = 11 => d = 11 + 3 = 14. Both d=8 and d=14 are positive and physically meaningful distances along the axis. For d=8, the minimal distance from sphere center to tube circle points is |8 - 3|=5, and maximal distance is 11, matching the sphere radius; for d=14, minimal distance is |14 - 3|=11, maximal distance is 17, again matching the sphere radius at the minimal distance. Therefore, both values d=8 and d=14 satisfy the external tangency condition geometrically and are valid. This confirms the two distinct valid values of d that allow external tangency between the torus and the sphere, respecting positive distances and the cosine range. Hence, the two tangent configurations correspond to these d values. This conclusion aligns with the geometric constraints and the problem context.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent W00Q:\nFrom Sub-task 2, the external tangency conditions between the torus and sphere give two equations for the displacement d of the torus tube center from the sphere center along the axis of revolution: d + r = 11 and d - r = 11, where r = 3 is the minor radius of the torus, and the sphere radius is 11. Solving these yields d = 8 and d = 14. Both values are positive distances, which is physically reasonable since the torus is displaced along the axis away from the sphere center. Next, we verify the tangency condition sqrt((d + r cos θ)^2 + (r sin θ)^2) = 11 for some θ. This expression simplifies to sqrt(d^2 + 2 d r cos θ + r^2) = 11. For tangency to occur, there must exist a θ in [0, 2π] satisfying this. Since cos θ ranges from -1 to 1, the expression under the square root varies between (d - r)^2 and (d + r)^2. For d = 8, the range is from (8 - 3)^2 = 25 to (8 + 3)^2 = 121. Since 11^2 = 121, the maximum value matches exactly, so θ = 0 (cos θ = 1) satisfies the tangency condition. For d = 14, the range is from (14 - 3)^2 = 121 to (14 + 3)^2 = 289. The minimum value matches 11^2 = 121, so θ = π (cos θ = -1) satisfies the tangency condition. Thus, both d = 8 and d = 14 correspond to valid external tangencies with the sphere, each at a unique θ. These two distinct values of d respect geometric constraints and yield two tangent circles on the torus surface. This confirms the validity of the two tangency positions derived. Therefore, the two distinct valid values of d allowing external tangency are d = 8 and d = 14.\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Given all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer identifying the two valid displacement values d. \n\n then justify completely and detailedly, step-by-step why you think so in the "thinking" entry. \n                If stuck in loop, stop this reasoning.\n                Again, your task is only to answer the question Given all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer identifying the two valid displacement values d. and explaination your thinking.\n                Follow the instruction step-by-step.

Next, we verify the tangency condition sqrt((d + r cos θ)^2 + (r sin θ)^2) = 11 for some θ. This expression simplifies to sqrt(d^2 + 2 d r cos θ + r^2) = 11. For tangency to occur, there must exist a θ in [0, 2π] satisfying this. Since cos θ ranges from -1 to 1, the expression under the square root varies between (d - r)^2 and (d + r)^2. For d = 8, the range is from (8 - 3)^2 = 25 to (8 + 3)^2 = 121. Since 11^2 = 121, the maximum value matches exactly, so θ = 0 (cos θ = 1) satisfies the tangency condition. For d = 14, the range is from (14 - 3)^2 = 121 to (14 + 3)^2 = 289. The minimum value matches 11^2 = 121, so θ = π (cos θ = -1) satisfies the tangency condition. Thus, both d = 8 and d = 14 correspond to valid external tangencies with the sphere, each at a unique θ. These two distinct values of d respect geometric constraints and yield two tangent circles on the torus surface. This confirms the validity of the two tangency positions derived. Therefore, the two distinct valid values of d allowing external tangency are d = 8 and d = 14.\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Given all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer identifying the two valid displacement values d. \n\n then justify completely and detailedly, step-by-step why you think so in the "thinking" entry. \n                If stuck in loop, stop this reasoning.\n                Again, your task is only to answer the question Given all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer identifying the two valid displacement values d. and explaination your thinking.\n                Follow the instruction step-by-step.

These values come from evaluating the radius of the tangent circle on the torus surface, which is given by R + r cos(θ), where R = 6 and r = 3. For the two tangent positions, cos(θ) takes values 1 and -1, leading to radii 9 and 3, respectively. The difference is then r_i - r_o = 9 - 3 = 6. Since 6 can be expressed as the fraction 6/1, and 6 and 1 share no common factors other than 1, the fraction is already in simplest terms. Therefore, m = 6 and n = 1, and m + n = 7. This conclusion is consistent with the problem\'s geometric interpretation and the given conditions, and no further reduction is possible.

Please think carefully and provide an updated answer. \n\n ### thinking #1 by Debate Agent vIZh:\nFrom the previous sub-task analysis, we have the two tangent circle radii on the torus as r_i = 9 and r_o = 3. These values come from evaluating the radius of the tangent circle on the torus surface, which is given by R + r cos(θ), where R = 6 and r = 3. For the two tangent positions, cos(θ) takes values 1 and -1, leading to radii 9 and 3, respectively. The difference is then r_i - r_o = 9 - 3 = 6. Since 6 can be expressed as the fraction 6/1, and 6 and 1 share no common factors other than 1, the fraction is already in simplest terms. Therefore, m = 6 and n = 1, and m + n = 7. This conclusion is consistent with the problem\'s geometric interpretation and the given conditions, and no further reduction is possible.
