============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- Points: O = (0,0), A = (1/2, 0), B = (0, sqrt(3)/2) in the coordinate plane.
- Family \(\mathcal{F}\): segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of length 1, with P on the x-axis (i.e., P = (x,0), x > 0) and Q on the y-axis (i.e., Q = (0,y), y > 0), lying in the first quadrant.
- Segment \(\overline{AB}\) connects A and B.
- There exists a unique point C on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from A and B, such that C does not lie on any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\) itself.
- Objective: Find \(OC^2 = \frac{p}{q}\) in lowest terms and compute \(p+q\).

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The segments in \(\mathcal{F}\) are all unit length, with endpoints constrained to axes in the first quadrant.
- The segment \(\overline{AB}\) lies between A and B, which are fixed points on the axes but not at the origin.
- The point C lies on \(\overline{AB}\) and is unique with the property that it is not covered by any other segment in \(\mathcal{F}\) except \(\overline{AB}\).
- The problem involves understanding which points in the first quadrant can be covered by segments of length 1 with endpoints on the axes, and identifying the exceptional point C on \(\overline{AB}\).
- The condition that C is unique and distinct from A and B suggests a boundary or extremal property related to the coverage of \(\mathcal{F}\).

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem is primarily in Euclidean geometry and analytic geometry.
- It involves coordinate geometry, segment length constraints, and locus or coverage problems.
- Subfields include plane geometry, geometric inequalities, and possibly optimization or geometric measure theory.
- Such problems are common in mathematical competitions and geometric problem solving.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The exact nature of "does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\)" could be interpreted as C lying only on \(\overline{AB}\) within \(\mathcal{F}\), implying no other unit segment with endpoints on axes passes through C.
- The uniqueness of C suggests a special geometric or algebraic property that distinguishes it from other points on \(\overline{AB}\).
- It is assumed that segments in \(\mathcal{F}\) are closed line segments.
- The problem implicitly assumes the first quadrant excludes the axes except for the endpoints P and Q.
- Potential challenge: characterizing the union of all such unit segments \(\overline{PQ}\) and identifying points on \(\overline{AB}\) not covered by any other segment.
- Reasonable assumptions include that P and Q vary continuously along the positive x- and y-axes, and that the problem is well-posed with a unique such point C.
