============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- Functions defined:
  - f(x) = | |x| - 1/2 |, which is the absolute value of the difference between the absolute value of x and 1/2.
  - g(x) = | |x| - 1/4 |, similarly defined with 1/4.
- The graphs under consideration are:
  - y = 4 * g(f(sin(2πx)))
  - x = 4 * g(f(cos(3πy)))
- The variables x and y are real numbers, and the functions involve compositions of trigonometric functions with f and g.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The functions f and g are piecewise linear due to absolute values, creating 'V'-shaped graphs with breakpoints at specific values (1/2 and 1/4).
- The inner arguments to f are sin(2πx) and cos(3πy), which are periodic with periods 1 and 2/3 respectively.
- The outer function g is applied to f of these trigonometric values, then scaled by 4.
- The system is symmetric in a sense: y depends on x through sin(2πx), and x depends on y through cos(3πy).
- The intersection points correspond to solutions (x,y) satisfying both equations simultaneously.
- The constraints imply the graphs are formed by compositions of periodic and piecewise linear functions, likely leading to multiple intersection points.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem lies primarily in real analysis and algebra, involving piecewise-defined functions and trigonometric functions.
- Subfields include:
  - Analysis of piecewise linear functions.
  - Trigonometric function properties and periodicity.
  - Implicit function analysis and intersection counting.
- Potential applications include mathematical problem solving in competitions, signal processing (due to periodicity and absolute values), and dynamical systems.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The domain of x and y is not explicitly stated; presumably real numbers, but bounded intervals might affect the number of intersections.
- The nature of the intersection counting (e.g., counting multiplicities, considering only real solutions) is not specified.
- The complexity of the nested absolute values combined with trigonometric functions may lead to multiple branches and piecewise definitions, complicating direct analysis.
- The implicit nature of the system (x and y defined in terms of each other) may allow multiple or infinite solutions depending on domain assumptions.

The inner expression |x| - c (where c is 1/2 or 1/4) changes sign at |x| = c, which are the breakpoints. For f(x):\n- When |x| >= 1/2, |x| - 1/2 >= 0, so f(x) = |x| - 1/2.\n- When |x| < 1/2, |x| - 1/2 < 0, so f(x) = -( |x| - 1/2 ) = 1/2 - |x|.\nSimilarly for g(x):\n- When |x| >= 1/4, g(x) = |x| - 1/4.\n- When |x| < 1/4, g(x) = 1/4 - |x|.\n\nTherefore, both f and g are V-shaped piecewise linear functions centered at 0 with a \'vertex\' at the points where |x| equals 1/2 or 1/4 respectively. The ranges of f and g are from 0 to infinity (since absolute values are non-negative and the minimum value occurs at |x| = 1/2 for f and |x| = 1/4 for g, where the function value is zero).\n\nExplicitly:\nFor f(x):\n- If x >= 1/2, f(x) = x - 1/2\n- If 0 <= x < 1/2, f(x) = 1/2 - x\n- If -1/2 <= x < 0, f(x) = 1/2 + x\n- If x < -1/2, f(x) = -x - 1/2\n\nFor g(x):\n- If x >= 1/4, g(x) = x - 1/4\n- If 0 <= x < 1/4, g(x) = 1/4 - x\n- If -1/4 <= x < 0, g(x) = 1/4 + x\n- If x < -1/4, g(x) = -x - 1/4\n\nThis detailed piecewise description captures the linear segments and breakpoints clearly, which is essential for analyzing the composite functions in the original question.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent BXja:\nTo derive explicit piecewise linear expressions for f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|, we first note that both depend on the absolute value of x, so the functions are even functions. The inner absolute value |x| is always non-negative. Then, for f(x), we consider the expression | |x| - 1/2 |. The function f(x) measures the distance between |x| and 1/2 on the real line. The breakpoints occur where the expression inside the outer absolute value changes sign, i.e., at |x| = 1/2. Thus, the critical points are at x = -1/2 and x = 1/2. For |x| ≤ 1/2, |x| - 1/2 ≤ 0, so f(x) = 1/2 - |x|. For |x| ≥ 1/2, |x| - 1/2 ≥ 0, so f(x) = |x| - 1/2. Hence, f(x) can be expressed piecewise as:\n\nf(x) = {\n  1/2 - |x|, if |x| ≤ 1/2\n  |x| - 1/2, if |x| ≥ 1/2\n}\n\nSimilarly, for g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|, the breakpoints occur at |x| = 1/4. For |x| ≤ 1/4, g(x) = 1/4 - |x|, and for |x| ≥ 1/4, g(x) = |x| - 1/4. So g(x) is:\n\ng(x) = {\n  1/4 - |x|, if |x| ≤ 1/4\n  |x| - 1/4, if |x| ≥ 1/4\n}\n\nRanges: Both f and g are non-negative since they are absolute values of real expressions. The maximum values occur at x=0 for both functions: f(0) = |0 - 1/2| = 1/2 and g(0) = |0 - 1/4| = 1/4. The minimum value of both functions is zero, attained at |x|=1/2 for f and |x|=1/4 for g.\n\nIn the context of the query, these piecewise linear forms highlight the \'V\' shaped graphs centered at the breakpoints and help understand the behavior of the composite functions involving trigonometric inputs and scaling by 4.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent ZKrv:\nTo derive explicit piecewise linear expressions for the functions f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|, we start by considering the inner absolute value |x|. Since |x| ≥ 0 for all real x, the expressions depend on the value of |x| relative to 1/2 for f and 1/4 for g. For f(x), the function measures the absolute difference between |x| and 1/2, which creates a \'V\' shape with a vertex at |x| = 1/2. Similarly, g(x) has a vertex at |x| = 1/4. We analyze f(x): For |x| ≤ 1/2, f(x) = 1/2 - |x|; for |x| ≥ 1/2, f(x) = |x| - 1/2. Because |x| is symmetric about zero, the expressions can be written in terms of x with cases for x ≥ 0 and x ≤ 0. Similarly for g(x), for |x| ≤ 1/4, g(x) = 1/4 - |x|; for |x| ≥ 1/4, g(x) = |x| - 1/4. The breakpoints are at x = ±1/2 for f and x = ±1/4 for g. The range of both functions is [0, ∞), as absolute values are non-negative. The piecewise linear nature and breakpoints are crucial for understanding the composition with trigonometric functions in the original problem. This detailed piecewise formulation aids in analyzing intersections and behavior of the composite functions involving f and g.\n\n\nPlease think broadly, explore multiple dimensions (e.g., effectiveness, generalizability, popularity, clarity, efficiency, potential risks), and adapt your reasoning dynamically depending on the nature of the plans.

The inner expression |x| - c (where c is 1/2 or 1/4) changes sign at |x| = c, which are the breakpoints. For f(x):\n- When |x| >= 1/2, |x| - 1/2 >= 0, so f(x) = |x| - 1/2.\n- When |x| < 1/2, |x| - 1/2 < 0, so f(x) = -( |x| - 1/2 ) = 1/2 - |x|.\nSimilarly for g(x):\n- When |x| >= 1/4, g(x) = |x| - 1/4.\n- When |x| < 1/4, g(x) = 1/4 - |x|.\n\nTherefore, both f and g are V-shaped piecewise linear functions centered at 0 with a \'vertex\' at the points where |x| equals 1/2 or 1/4 respectively. The ranges of f and g are from 0 to infinity (since absolute values are non-negative and the minimum value occurs at |x| = 1/2 for f and |x| = 1/4 for g, where the function value is zero).\n\nExplicitly:\nFor f(x):\n- If x >= 1/2, f(x) = x - 1/2\n- If 0 <= x < 1/2, f(x) = 1/2 - x\n- If -1/2 <= x < 0, f(x) = 1/2 + x\n- If x < -1/2, f(x) = -x - 1/2\n\nFor g(x):\n- If x >= 1/4, g(x) = x - 1/4\n- If 0 <= x < 1/4, g(x) = 1/4 - x\n- If -1/4 <= x < 0, g(x) = 1/4 + x\n- If x < -1/4, g(x) = -x - 1/4\n\nThis detailed piecewise description captures the linear segments and breakpoints clearly, which is essential for analyzing the composite functions in the original question.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent BXja:\nTo derive explicit piecewise linear expressions for f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|, we first note that both depend on the absolute value of x, so the functions are even functions. The inner absolute value |x| is always non-negative. Then, for f(x), we consider the expression | |x| - 1/2 |. The function f(x) measures the distance between |x| and 1/2 on the real line. The breakpoints occur where the expression inside the outer absolute value changes sign, i.e., at |x| = 1/2. Thus, the critical points are at x = -1/2 and x = 1/2. For |x| ≤ 1/2, |x| - 1/2 ≤ 0, so f(x) = 1/2 - |x|. For |x| ≥ 1/2, |x| - 1/2 ≥ 0, so f(x) = |x| - 1/2. Hence, f(x) can be expressed piecewise as:\n\nf(x) = {\n  1/2 - |x|, if |x| ≤ 1/2\n  |x| - 1/2, if |x| ≥ 1/2\n}\n\nSimilarly, for g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|, the breakpoints occur at |x| = 1/4. For |x| ≤ 1/4, g(x) = 1/4 - |x|, and for |x| ≥ 1/4, g(x) = |x| - 1/4. So g(x) is:\n\ng(x) = {\n  1/4 - |x|, if |x| ≤ 1/4\n  |x| - 1/4, if |x| ≥ 1/4\n}\n\nRanges: Both f and g are non-negative since they are absolute values of real expressions. The maximum values occur at x=0 for both functions: f(0) = |0 - 1/2| = 1/2 and g(0) = |0 - 1/4| = 1/4. The minimum value of both functions is zero, attained at |x|=1/2 for f and |x|=1/4 for g.\n\nIn the context of the query, these piecewise linear forms highlight the \'V\' shaped graphs centered at the breakpoints and help understand the behavior of the composite functions involving trigonometric inputs and scaling by 4.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent ZKrv:\nTo derive explicit piecewise linear expressions for the functions f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|, we start by considering the inner absolute value |x|. Since |x| ≥ 0 for all real x, the expressions depend on the value of |x| relative to 1/2 for f and 1/4 for g. For f(x), the function measures the absolute difference between |x| and 1/2, which creates a \'V\' shape with a vertex at |x| = 1/2. Similarly, g(x) has a vertex at |x| = 1/4. We analyze f(x): For |x| ≤ 1/2, f(x) = 1/2 - |x|; for |x| ≥ 1/2, f(x) = |x| - 1/2. Because |x| is symmetric about zero, the expressions can be written in terms of x with cases for x ≥ 0 and x ≤ 0. Similarly for g(x), for |x| ≤ 1/4, g(x) = 1/4 - |x|; for |x| ≥ 1/4, g(x) = |x| - 1/4. The breakpoints are at x = ±1/2 for f and x = ±1/4 for g. The range of both functions is [0, ∞), as absolute values are non-negative. The piecewise linear nature and breakpoints are crucial for understanding the composition with trigonometric functions in the original problem. This detailed piecewise formulation aids in analyzing intersections and behavior of the composite functions involving f and g.\n\n\nPlease think broadly, explore multiple dimensions (e.g., effectiveness, generalizability, popularity, clarity, efficiency, potential risks), and adapt your reasoning dynamically depending on the nature of the plans.

Both sin(2πx) and cos(3πy) range between -1 and 1, so their absolute values range from 0 to 1. The function f is defined as f(x) = 1/2 - |x| if |x| ≤ 1/2, and f(x) = |x| - 1/2 if |x| ≥ 1/2. Applying this to |sin(2πx)| and |cos(3πy)|, we get piecewise linear functions with breakpoints at 1/2. The periodicity of sin(2πx) is 1, so f(sin(2πx)) is periodic with period 1. The periodicity of cos(3πy) is 2/3, so f(cos(3πy)) is periodic with period 2/3. The range of f composed with these trigonometric functions is from 0 to 1/2. Next, applying g, which is defined as g(x) = 1/4 - |x| if |x| ≤ 1/4, and g(x) = |x| - 1/4 if |x| ≥ 1/4, to the output of f, we get g(f(sin(2πx))) and g(f(cos(3πy))) as piecewise linear functions with breakpoints at 1/4. Since f outputs values in [0,1/2], g outputs values in [0,1/4]. The periodicities remain the same after applying g.

Applying this to |sin(2πx)| and |cos(3πy)|, we get piecewise linear functions with breakpoints at 1/2. The periodicity of sin(2πx) is 1, so f(sin(2πx)) is periodic with period 1. The periodicity of cos(3πy) is 2/3, so f(cos(3πy)) is periodic with period 2/3. The range of f composed with these trigonometric functions is from 0 to 1/2. Next, applying g, which is defined as g(x) = 1/4 - |x| if |x| ≤ 1/4, and g(x) = |x| - 1/4 if |x| ≥ 1/4, to the output of f, we get g(f(sin(2πx))) and g(f(cos(3πy))) as piecewise linear functions with breakpoints at 1/4.

The periodicity of sin(2πx) is 1, so y(x) is periodic with period 1. The periodicity of cos(3πy) is 2/3, so x(y) is periodic with period 2/3. For intersections, the system requires (x,y) such that y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))).

The compositions are:\n   - y = 4 * g(f(sin(2πx)))\n   - x = 4 * g(f(cos(3πy)))\n\nBecause f(sin(2πx)) and f(cos(3πy)) are periodic with periods 1 and 2/3 respectively (due to the periodicity of sine and cosine), and both f and g are piecewise linear with breakpoints at 1/2 and 1/4 respectively, the compositions g(f(...)) are also piecewise linear and periodic with the same periods.\n\nThe ranges after applying g are [0,1/4], so multiplying by 4 yields ranges [0,1] for both y and x.\n\nTherefore:\n- y ∈ [0,1]\n- x ∈ [0,1]\n\nFor intersections (x,y) satisfying both equations simultaneously, both x and y must lie within [0,1]. This constraint arises naturally from the compositions and scaling.\n\nFurthermore, the periodicity implies that these functions repeat their patterns infinitely over the real line, but the outputs are always constrained to [0,1].\n\nHence, the system\'s solution points (intersections) must satisfy x,y ∈ [0,1]. Outside this square, no solutions exist because the functions do not produce values outside [0,1].\n\nIn summary:\n- The possible values of y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) lie in [0,1].\n- The possible values of x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) lie in [0,1].\n- The intersection points (x,y) must lie within the unit square [0,1] × [0,1].\n\nThis is consistent with the piecewise linear, periodic nature of the functions and their ranges.\n\nAdditional advice from other agents aligns with this conclusion, confirming the ranges and periodicities, and the constraints on x and y for intersections.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent 8IWa:\nWe start with the given functions f and g, defined as f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|, both piecewise linear with breakpoints at 1/2 and 1/4 respectively. The inner arguments to f are sin(2πx) and cos(3πy), which range between -1 and 1, so their absolute values range from 0 to 1. Applying f to these values yields outputs in [0, 1/2], since f(x) = | |x| - 1/2 | maps [0,1] to [0,1/2]. Specifically, f(|sin(2πx)|) and f(|cos(3πy)|) are piecewise linear functions with breakpoints at 1/2. Next, applying g to f(sin(2πx)) and f(cos(3πy)) maps [0,1/2] to [0,1/4], because g(x) = ||x| - 1/4| has a breakpoint at 1/4 and outputs values in [0,1/4]. Thus, g(f(sin(2πx))) and g(f(cos(3πy))) are piecewise linear functions with breakpoints at 1/4 and range [0,1/4]. Multiplying by 4 scales the range to [0,1]. Therefore, y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) both range from 0 to 1. The periodicity of sin(2πx) is 1, so y(x) is periodic with period 1. The periodicity of cos(3πy) is 2/3, so x(y) is periodic with period 2/3. For intersections, the system requires (x,y) such that y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). Because both x and y are constrained to [0,1], the intersection points lie in the unit square [0,1]×[0,1]. The piecewise linearity and periodicity imply multiple intersection points within these intervals. The constraints for intersections are therefore x ∈ [0,1], y ∈ [0,1], with x and y satisfying the coupled equations involving periodic, piecewise linear functions with breakpoints at 1/2 and 1/4 inside f and g.

Specifically, f(|sin(2πx)|) and f(|cos(3πy)|) are piecewise linear functions with breakpoints at 1/2. Next, applying g to f(sin(2πx)) and f(cos(3πy)) maps [0,1/2] to [0,1/4], because g(x) = ||x| - 1/4| has a breakpoint at 1/4 and outputs values in [0,1/4].

They agree that for values of |x| less than the breakpoint, the function decreases linearly from the breakpoint value to zero at x=0, and for values of |x| greater than the breakpoint, the function increases linearly. The functions are symmetric about zero due to the absolute value. The ranges are from 0 to the maximum value at x=0 (1/2 for f and 1/4 for g). The explicit piecewise forms are consistent across the agents, with the simplest and clearest form expressed in terms of |x|: f(x) = 1/2 - |x| if |x| ≤ 1/2, and f(x) = |x| - 1/2 if |x| ≥ 1/2; similarly for g(x) with 1/4. This form captures the V-shape and breakpoints clearly and is most suitable for further analysis of compositions with trigonometric functions. Therefore, the most consistent and clear piecewise linear expressions for f and g are those expressed in terms of |x| with breakpoints at 1/2 and 1/4 respectively, as detailed above.', 'The problem involves analyzing the compositions f(sin(2πx)) and f(cos(3πy)) where f and g are piecewise linear functions defined by absolute values with breakpoints at 1/2 and 1/4 respectively. Both sin(2πx) and cos(3πy) range between -1 and 1, so their absolute values range from 0 to 1. The function f is defined as f(x) = 1/2 - |x| if |x| ≤ 1/2, and f(x) = |x| - 1/2 if |x| ≥ 1/2. Applying this to |sin(2πx)| and |cos(3πy)|, we get piecewise linear functions with breakpoints at 1/2. The periodicity of sin(2πx) is 1, so f(sin(2πx)) is periodic with period 1. The periodicity of cos(3πy) is 2/3, so f(cos(3πy)) is periodic with period 2/3. The range of f composed with these trigonometric functions is from 0 to 1/2. Next, applying g, which is defined as g(x) = 1/4 - |x| if |x| ≤ 1/4, and g(x) = |x| - 1/4 if |x| ≥ 1/4, to the output of f, we get g(f(sin(2πx))) and g(f(cos(3πy))) as piecewise linear functions with breakpoints at 1/4. Since f outputs values in [0,1/2], g outputs values in [0,1/4]. The periodicities remain the same after applying g. Thus, the most consistent expressions and properties for the compositions are: f(sin(2πx)) = {1/2 - |sin(2πx)| if |sin(2πx)| ≤ 1/2; |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 if |sin(2πx)| ≥ 1/2}, f(cos(3πy)) = {1/2 - |cos(3πy)| if |cos(3πy)| ≤ 1/2; |cos(3πy)| - 1/2 if |cos(3πy)| ≥ 1/2}, and g(f(sin(2πx))) = {1/4 - f(sin(2πx)) if f(sin(2πx)) ≤ 1/4; f(sin(2πx)) - 1/4 if f(sin(2πx)) ≥ 1/4}, g(f(cos(3πy))) = {1/4 - f(cos(3πy)) if f(cos(3πy)) ≤ 1/4; f(cos(3πy)) - 1/4 if f(cos(3πy)) ≥ 1/4}.

Then applying g to f(...) maps [0, 1/2] to [0, 1/4]. Multiplying by 4 scales the range to [0,1]. Therefore, y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) both range from 0 to 1. The periodicity of sin(2πx) is 1, so y(x) is periodic with period 1. The periodicity of cos(3πy) is 2/3, so x(y) is periodic with period 2/3. For intersections, the system requires (x,y) such that y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). Because both x and y are constrained to [0,1], the intersection points lie in the unit square [0,1]×[0,1]. The piecewise linearity and periodicity imply multiple intersection points within these intervals. The constraints for intersections are therefore x ∈ [0,1], y ∈ [0,1], with x and y satisfying the coupled equations involving periodic, piecewise linear functions with breakpoints at 1/2 and 1/4 inside f and g. This domain restriction is critical when counting or analyzing intersection points. No solutions exist outside this unit square because the functions do not produce values outside [0,1].

They agree that for values of |x| less than the breakpoint, the function decreases linearly from the breakpoint value to zero at x=0, and for values of |x| greater than the breakpoint, the function increases linearly. The functions are symmetric about zero due to the absolute value. The ranges are from 0 to the maximum value at x=0 (1/2 for f and 1/4 for g). The explicit piecewise forms are consistent across the agents, with the simplest and clearest form expressed in terms of |x|: f(x) = 1/2 - |x| if |x| ≤ 1/2, and f(x) = |x| - 1/2 if |x| ≥ 1/2; similarly for g(x) with 1/4. This form captures the V-shape and breakpoints clearly and is most suitable for further analysis of compositions with trigonometric functions. Therefore, the most consistent and clear piecewise linear expressions for f and g are those expressed in terms of |x| with breakpoints at 1/2 and 1/4 respectively, as detailed above.\n\n### Sub-task 2: Synthesize and choose the most consistent expressions and properties for compositions. \n\n ### thinking by Final Decision Agent F3bJ:\nThe problem involves analyzing the compositions f(sin(2πx)) and f(cos(3πy)) where f and g are piecewise linear functions defined by absolute values with breakpoints at 1/2 and 1/4 respectively. Both sin(2πx) and cos(3πy) range between -1 and 1, so their absolute values range from 0 to 1. The function f is defined as f(x) = 1/2 - |x| if |x| ≤ 1/2, and f(x) = |x| - 1/2 if |x| ≥ 1/2. Applying this to |sin(2πx)| and |cos(3πy)|, we get piecewise linear functions with breakpoints at 1/2. The periodicity of sin(2πx) is 1, so f(sin(2πx)) is periodic with period 1. The periodicity of cos(3πy) is 2/3, so f(cos(3πy)) is periodic with period 2/3. The range of f composed with these trigonometric functions is from 0 to 1/2. Next, applying g, which is defined as g(x) = 1/4 - |x| if |x| ≤ 1/4, and g(x) = |x| - 1/4 if |x| ≥ 1/4, to the output of f, we get g(f(sin(2πx))) and g(f(cos(3πy))) as piecewise linear functions with breakpoints at 1/4. Since f outputs values in [0,1/2], g outputs values in [0,1/4]. The periodicities remain the same after applying g. Thus, the most consistent expressions and properties for the compositions are: f(sin(2πx)) = {1/2 - |sin(2πx)| if |sin(2πx)| ≤ 1/2; |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 if |sin(2πx)| ≥ 1/2}, f(cos(3πy)) = {1/2 - |cos(3πy)| if |cos(3πy)| ≤ 1/2; |cos(3πy)| - 1/2 if |cos(3πy)| ≥ 1/2}, and g(f(sin(2πx))) = {1/4 - f(sin(2πx)) if f(sin(2πx)) ≤ 1/4; f(sin(2πx)) - 1/4 if f(sin(2πx)) ≥ 1/4}, g(f(cos(3πy))) = {1/4 - f(cos(3πy)) if f(cos(3πy)) ≤ 1/4; f(cos(3πy)) - 1/4 if f(cos(3πy)) ≥ 1/4}. These functions are piecewise linear, periodic with periods 1 and 2/3 respectively, and have ranges [0,1/4] after applying g.\n\n### Sub-task 3: Synthesize and finalize ranges and constraints for intersection analysis. \n\n ### thinking by Final Decision Agent o1UC:\nThe functions f and g are defined as f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|, both piecewise linear with breakpoints at 1/2 and 1/4 respectively.

Then applying g to f(...) maps [0, 1/2] to [0, 1/4]. Multiplying by 4 scales the range to [0,1]. Therefore, y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) both range from 0 to 1. The periodicity of sin(2πx) is 1, so y(x) is periodic with period 1. The periodicity of cos(3πy) is 2/3, so x(y) is periodic with period 2/3. For intersections, the system requires (x,y) such that y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))).
