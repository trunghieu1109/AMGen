[{'objective': 'Analyze and simplify the functions f(x) and g(x) to understand their behavior and range.'}, {'objective': 'Express the given equations y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) explicitly and analyze their domains and ranges.'}, {'objective': 'Formulate and analyze the system of equations representing the intersection points of the two graphs.'}, {'objective': 'Determine and count the number of solutions (intersection points) to the system within the relevant domain.'}]
============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- Functions defined:
  - f(x) = | |x| - 1/2 |, which is the absolute value of the difference between the absolute value of x and 1/2.
  - g(x) = | |x| - 1/4 |, similarly defined with 1/4.
- The problem involves the graphs of two equations:
  - y = 4 * g(f(sin(2πx)))
  - x = 4 * g(f(cos(3πy)))
- Variables x and y are real numbers, presumably.
- The functions involve compositions of trigonometric functions (sin and cos) with f and g, which are piecewise linear due to absolute values.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The inner functions f and g transform the outputs of sin(2πx) and cos(3πy) through nested absolute values and shifts.
- The equations are symmetric in a sense: y is expressed in terms of x, and x in terms of y, both involving similar functional forms.
- The scaling factor 4 outside g amplifies the output.
- The problem sets up an implicit system where the intersection points correspond to pairs (x,y) satisfying both equations simultaneously.
- The constraints from absolute values and periodicity of sine and cosine imply the functions are piecewise linear and periodic in nature.
- The interplay between the periods of sin(2πx) and cos(3πy) and the piecewise linear transformations will influence the number and distribution of intersections.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem lies primarily in real analysis and algebra, involving piecewise-defined functions and trigonometric functions.
- Subfields include:
  - Analysis of piecewise linear functions.
  - Trigonometric function properties and periodicity.
  - Implicit function analysis and intersection counting.
- Potential applications or contexts:
  - Mathematical problem solving and competitions.
  - Study of functional equations and graph intersections.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The domain of x and y is not explicitly stated; assumed to be real numbers.
- The problem does not specify if the graphs are considered over all real numbers or restricted intervals.
- The behavior of f and g at points where their arguments equal 1/2 or 1/4 may cause nondifferentiability; the impact on counting intersections is not detailed.
- The complexity arises from nested absolute values and compositions with periodic functions, which may lead to multiple intersection points or complicated graph shapes.
- The problem does not specify if multiplicities of intersections count or only distinct points.
- The implicit nature of the system may allow multiple or infinite solutions depending on domain assumptions.
