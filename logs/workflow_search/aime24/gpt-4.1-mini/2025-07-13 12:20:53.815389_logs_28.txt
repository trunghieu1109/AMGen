============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- A torus T is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis in the plane of the circle, with the axis located 6 units from the center of the circle. This creates a standard torus (donut shape) with a major radius R = 6 and minor radius r = 3.
- A sphere S has radius 11.
- The torus T is placed externally tangent to the sphere S in two different configurations, each time resting on the outside of S.
- In each configuration, the torus and sphere are tangent along a circle. The radius of this tangent circle is denoted r_i in one configuration and r_o in the other.
- The problem involves the difference r_i - r_o, which can be expressed as a reduced fraction m/n, with m and n positive integers and relatively prime.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The torus is defined by two radii: the major radius (distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus) R = 6, and the minor radius (radius of the tube) r = 3.
- The sphere has radius 11.
- External tangency between the torus and sphere implies that their surfaces touch without intersecting, and the contact set is a circle.
- The two different resting positions of the torus on the sphere correspond to two distinct tangent circles with radii r_i and r_o.
- The difference r_i - r_o relates to the geometry of the torus and sphere and their relative positions.
- The problem likely involves understanding the locus of points of tangency and how the torus can be positioned relative to the sphere to produce these tangent circles.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem lies primarily in geometry, specifically 3D geometry involving surfaces of revolution.
- Concepts involved include the geometry of tori and spheres, external tangency, and circle of intersection.
- Subfields include differential geometry (surface tangency), classical Euclidean geometry, and possibly algebraic geometry if equations of surfaces are used.
- Such problems are common in mathematical competitions and geometric modeling.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The problem states "when T rests on the outside of S" twice, which may be a typographical repetition; presumably, the two tangent configurations differ in how the torus is positioned relative to the sphere.
- The exact nature of the two tangent circles (r_i and r_o) and how they arise from the two configurations is not fully detailed.
- The axis of revolution and orientation of the torus relative to the sphere is not explicitly described beyond the initial construction.
- Potential challenges include visualizing the two distinct tangent configurations and determining the radii of the tangent circles without explicit coordinate systems or equations.
