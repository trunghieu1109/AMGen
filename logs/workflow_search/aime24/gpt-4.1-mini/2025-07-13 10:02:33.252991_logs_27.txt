============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- N is a four-digit positive integer (i.e., 1000 ≤ N ≤ 9999).
- N has the property that if any one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7.
- Q and R are defined as the quotient and remainder when N is divided by 1000, i.e., N = 1000Q + R, with Q an integer between 1 and 9 (since N is four-digit) and 0 ≤ R < 1000.
- The task is to find Q + R.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- Changing any one digit of N to 1 produces a number divisible by 7. This implies that for each digit position, replacing that digit with 1 yields a multiple of 7.
- Since N has four digits, there are four such modified numbers, each differing from N in exactly one digit.
- The divisibility by 7 condition imposes modular arithmetic constraints on the digits of N.
- The problem asks for the greatest such N, so among all numbers satisfying the property, the maximum is sought.
- Q and R come from dividing N by 1000, so Q is the thousands digit and R is the last three digits.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- Number theory, specifically divisibility and modular arithmetic.
- Elementary algebra related to digit manipulation and modular constraints.
- Possibly combinatorics in considering digit replacements.
- Such problems are common in mathematical competitions and recreational mathematics.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The problem is clear in its conditions; however, it assumes the reader understands "changing one digit to 1" means exactly one digit is replaced, not multiple digits.
- It is implicit that the digits are decimal digits (0–9), and the leading digit is nonzero (since N is four-digit).
- No ambiguity in the division by 1000; standard integer division applies.
- Potential challenge lies in systematically checking or characterizing all such numbers without exhaustive search.
- Assumptions: digits are base-10, leading digit ≥ 1, and only one digit is changed at a time to 1.
