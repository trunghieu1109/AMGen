[{'objective': 'Classify game positions as winning or losing based on the allowed moves of removing 1 or 4 tokens.'}, {'objective': 'Identify the pattern or formula that characterizes losing positions for the first player.'}, {'objective': 'Determine which initial values of n up to 2024 correspond to losing positions for Alice.'}, {'objective': 'Count the number of values n ≤ 2024 where Bob has a guaranteed winning strategy.'}]
============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- There is a stack of n tokens, where n is a positive integer.
- Two players, Alice and Bob, alternate turns; Alice moves first.
- On each turn, a player removes either 1 or 4 tokens from the stack.
- The player who removes the last token wins.
- The problem asks for the count of positive integers n ≤ 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy regardless of Alice's play.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The game is sequential and turn-based with perfect information.
- The moves allowed (removing 1 or 4 tokens) define the possible transitions between game states.
- The initial state is defined by n tokens; the state space is the integers from 0 to n.
- The winning condition depends on the parity and structure of reachable states.
- Bob's winning strategy implies that for certain n, the position after Alice's first move is losing for her, meaning Bob can always respond to force a win.
- The problem involves identifying losing and winning positions (P-positions and N-positions) in combinatorial game theory.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem lies in combinatorial game theory, a subfield of discrete mathematics.
- It involves concepts of impartial games, winning and losing positions, and strategy analysis.
- Such problems are common in mathematical competitions and theoretical computer science.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The problem is clear in its rules and conditions; no ambiguous terms are present.
- Potential challenges include determining the pattern of winning and losing positions up to n=2024 without exhaustive computation.
- Understanding the structure of the game states and their classification is key to solving the problem efficiently.
