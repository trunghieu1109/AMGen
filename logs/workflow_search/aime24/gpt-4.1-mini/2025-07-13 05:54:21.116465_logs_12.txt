============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- Given a complex number z with modulus |z| = 4.
- Expression to analyze: (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z.
- Objective: Find the largest possible real part of this expression.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- z lies on the circle of radius 4 in the complex plane, so z = 4e^{iθ} for some real θ.
- The expression involves a linear term in z and a reciprocal term 1/z, both multiplied by complex constants.
- The real part depends on θ through the arguments of z and 1/z, which are conjugates in terms of angle.
- Constraints on |z| fix the magnitude, so optimization reduces to varying θ.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- Complex analysis and trigonometry.
- Optimization on the complex plane.
- Relevant subfields: complex numbers, polar representation, and possibly inequalities.
- Applications: mathematical problem solving, complex function analysis.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The problem is well-defined with no ambiguous terms.
- Potential challenge: expressing the real part in terms of θ and maximizing it.
- Assumption: z ≠ 0 (given |z|=4, so valid), and standard interpretation of complex arithmetic applies.

To compute (75 + 117i)z, we multiply the complex number (75 + 117i) by z: (75 + 117i) * 4(cosθ + i sinθ) = 4[(75 + 117i)(cosθ + i sinθ)]. Expanding this, we use distributive property: 4[(75 cosθ + 75 i sinθ + 117 i cosθ + 117 i^2 sinθ)]. Since i^2 = -1, this becomes 4[(75 cosθ + 75 i sinθ + 117 i cosθ - 117 sinθ)]. Grouping real and imaginary parts: real part is 75 cosθ - 117 sinθ, imaginary part is 75 sinθ + 117 cosθ. So, (75 + 117i)z = 4[(75 cosθ - 117 sinθ) + i(75 sinθ + 117 cosθ)]. Similarly, for (96 + 144i)/z, since z = 4e^{iθ}, 1/z = 1/(4e^{iθ}) = (1/4)e^{-iθ} = (1/4)(cosθ - i sinθ). Multiplying (96 + 144i) by 1/z gives (96 + 144i)(1/4)(cosθ - i sinθ) = (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ). Expanding: 24 cosθ - 24 i sinθ + 36 i cosθ - 36 i^2 sinθ. Since i^2 = -1, this is 24 cosθ - 24 i sinθ + 36 i cosθ + 36 sinθ. Grouping real and imaginary parts: real part is 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ, imaginary part is -24 sinθ + 36 cosθ. So, (96 + 144i)/z = (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ) + i(-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ).

Substitute these into the expression:\n\n(75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ} + (96 + 144i) * (1/4) e^{-iθ} = 4(75 + 117i)e^{iθ} + (1/4)(96 + 144i)e^{-iθ}.\n\nCalculate the coefficients:\n4 * (75 + 117i) = 300 + 468i,\n(1/4) * (96 + 144i) = 24 + 36i.\n\nSo the expression becomes:\n(300 + 468i) e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i) e^{-iθ}.\n\nThe real part is:\nRe[(300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ) + (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ)]\n= Re[(300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + i(300 sinθ + 468 cosθ) + 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ + i(-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ)]\n= (300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ\n= (300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ\n= 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.\n\nThis is a linear combination of sine and cosine.
