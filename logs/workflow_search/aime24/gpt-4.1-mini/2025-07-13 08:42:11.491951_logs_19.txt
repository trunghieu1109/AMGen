============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- We have \( \omega \neq 1 \), where \( \omega \) is a 13th root of unity, i.e., \( \omega^{13} = 1 \).
- The product is taken over \( k = 0 \) to \( 12 \) of the expression \( 2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k} \).
- The task is to find the remainder when this product is divided by 1000.

Properties:
- The 13th roots of unity are complex numbers on the unit circle satisfying \( x^{13} - 1 = 0 \).
- \( \omega^0 = 1 \) is included in the product, so the product runs over all 13th roots of unity including 1.
- The expression inside the product is a quadratic polynomial in \( \omega^k \).

Objective:
- Compute \( \prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) \) modulo 1000.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The terms \( \omega^k \) are roots of unity, so they satisfy \( \omega^{13} = 1 \).
- The product over all \( k \) from 0 to 12 suggests a factorization related to the polynomial whose roots are \( \omega^k \).
- The expression inside the product can be viewed as \( f(\omega^k) \) where \( f(x) = 2 - 2x + x^2 \).
- The product over all roots \( \omega^k \) of \( f(\omega^k) \) is related to the resultant or evaluation of a polynomial at roots of unity.
- The inclusion of \( k=0 \) (i.e., \( \omega^0 = 1 \)) is significant; the problem states \( \omega \neq 1 \) but the product includes \( k=0 \), so the product is over all roots including 1.
- The polynomial \( f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2 \) can be analyzed for its roots and relation to the 13th roots of unity.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem lies in algebra and number theory, specifically in the study of roots of unity and polynomial factorization.
- Subfields include cyclotomic polynomials, complex numbers, and modular arithmetic.
- Such problems commonly appear in mathematical competitions and algebraic number theory contexts.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The problem states \( \omega \neq 1 \) but the product includes \( k=0 \) which corresponds to \( \omega^0 = 1 \). This could be a point of ambiguity.
- It is unclear if the product is intended over all 13th roots including 1 or excluding 1; the problem as stated includes \( k=0 \).
- The expression inside the product is quadratic in \( \omega^k \), which may complicate direct factorization.
- The modulus 1000 suggests that the final number might be large, so modular arithmetic or simplification is necessary.
- Reasonable assumption: The product is over all 13th roots of unity including 1, as per the index range, despite the initial statement \( \omega \neq 1 \) possibly referring to the root \( \omega \) itself.
- Another assumption is that the problem expects use of properties of roots of unity and polynomial factorization rather than brute force computation.
