============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- The figure is a fixed regular dodecagon (12-sided polygon) with vertices equally spaced on a circle.
- Rectangles are to be formed inside this dodecagon.
- Each side of the rectangle must lie on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon.
- The problem provides a diagram illustrating three such rectangles.
- Objective: Find the total number of such rectangles.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The dodecagon's vertices define a set of line segments: 12 sides and multiple diagonals.
- Rectangles require four right angles and opposite sides equal and parallel.
- Each rectangle side must coincide with a polygon side or diagonal, implying the rectangle's edges are aligned with chords of the circumscribed circle.
- The problem's constraints imply that the rectangle's vertices are intersection points of these sides and diagonals.
- The regularity and symmetry of the dodecagon impose geometric constraints on possible rectangles.
- The problem likely involves identifying sets of four vertices or intersection points that form rectangles with edges on polygon lines.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- Primary domain: Geometry, specifically Euclidean and polygonal geometry.
- Subfields: Combinatorial geometry (counting geometric figures), polygonal properties, and possibly discrete geometry.
- Applications: Problems of this type appear in mathematical competitions, geometric combinatorics, and computational geometry.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- Whether rectangle vertices must be polygon vertices or can be intersection points of diagonals.
- Whether all diagonals are considered or only certain subsets.
- The exact definition of 'side or diagonal'â€”does it include all diagonals or only those connecting certain vertices?
- Potential complexity due to multiple intersection points inside the polygon.
- Assumptions may be needed that rectangle vertices lie at intersections of polygon sides and diagonals, and that all diagonals are considered.
- Clarifying these would help in formulating a counting strategy.
