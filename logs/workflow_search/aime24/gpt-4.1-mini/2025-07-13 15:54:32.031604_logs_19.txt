============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- The problem involves the 13th roots of unity, denoted by \( \omega \), where \( \omega^{13} = 1 \) and \( \omega \neq 1 \).
- The product is taken over \( k = 0, 1, \ldots, 12 \) of the terms \( 2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k} \).
- The expression inside the product is a polynomial in \( \omega^k \) of degree 2.
- The problem asks for the remainder when this product is divided by 1000.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The \( \omega^k \) are the 13th roots of unity, so they satisfy \( \omega^{13} = 1 \).
- The product runs over all 13th roots of unity, including \( k=0 \) which corresponds to \( \omega^0 = 1 \).
- The polynomial inside the product can be viewed as \( f(x) = 2 - 2x + x^2 \) evaluated at each \( \omega^k \).
- Since the roots \( \omega^k \) are roots of \( x^{13} - 1 = 0 \), the product over all \( k \) of \( f(\omega^k) \) relates to the resultant or factorization properties involving cyclotomic polynomials.
- The condition \( \omega \neq 1 \) is given, but the product includes \( k=0 \) (where \( \omega^0 = 1 \)), so the term at \( k=0 \) is \( f(1) \).
- The problem's structure suggests leveraging properties of roots of unity, symmetric polynomials, or polynomial factorization to simplify the product.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem lies primarily in algebra and number theory.
- Subfields involved include cyclotomic polynomials, roots of unity, and modular arithmetic.
- The problem also touches on polynomial factorization and evaluation at roots of unity.
- Such problems commonly appear in mathematical competitions and number theory contexts.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The problem states \( \omega \neq 1 \), but the product includes \( k=0 \) where \( \omega^0 = 1 \). This could cause confusion about whether the term at \( k=0 \) should be included or excluded.
- The expression inside the product is quadratic in \( \omega^k \), but the significance of this particular polynomial is not explicitly stated.
- The problem does not specify whether to consider complex numbers or work purely algebraically.
- Computing the product directly is complex due to the 13 terms and the nature of roots of unity.
- The modulo 1000 condition suggests that the final numeric value is large and requires modular arithmetic techniques.
