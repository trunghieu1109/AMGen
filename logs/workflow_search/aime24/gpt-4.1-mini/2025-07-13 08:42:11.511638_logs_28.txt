============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- A torus T is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis in the plane of the circle, at a distance 6 from the circle's center. This describes a standard torus with major radius R = 6 and minor radius r = 3.
- A sphere S has radius 11.
- The torus T is placed externally tangent to the sphere S in two different ways, each time tangent along a circle on the torus surface.
- These two tangent circles have radii r_i and r_o respectively.
- The problem asks for the difference r_i - r_o expressed as a reduced fraction m/n, and then to find m + n.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The torus is defined by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis 6 units away, so the torus' centerline circle has radius 6.
- The sphere of radius 11 is fixed.
- External tangency between the torus and sphere along a circle implies the torus and sphere touch along a common circle on the torus surface.
- The two tangent configurations correspond to the torus resting on the sphere in two distinct ways, producing two tangent circles with radii r_i and r_o.
- The difference r_i - r_o is sought, indicating these radii correspond to two different cross-sectional circles on the torus.
- The problem likely involves geometric constraints relating the torus parameters, sphere radius, and the position of the tangent circle.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem lies in geometry, specifically 3D geometry involving surfaces of revolution.
- Concepts include torus geometry, sphere geometry, and external tangency conditions.
- It may involve analytic geometry or spatial reasoning.
- Such problems are common in mathematical competitions and advanced geometry contexts.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The problem states "when T rests on the outside of S" twice, which may be a typographical repetition; presumably, one is when the torus rests on the sphere in one orientation, and the other in a different orientation.
- The exact positions or orientations of the torus relative to the sphere for the two tangent circles are not explicitly described.
- It is assumed the torus is positioned so that the axis of revolution is vertical or aligned in a way that allows these tangent circles to be well-defined.
- The problem assumes the torus and sphere are externally tangent along circles, which implies certain geometric constraints that must be interpreted carefully.
- To proceed, one might assume the torus is placed so that its axis is vertical and the sphere is centered below or above it, allowing two distinct tangent circles on the torus surface.
- The problem does not specify the location of the tangent circles on the torus (inner vs outer), but the notation r_i and r_o suggests inner and outer radii of the tangent circles.
- No explicit coordinate system or reference frame is given, so a standard orientation is likely assumed.
