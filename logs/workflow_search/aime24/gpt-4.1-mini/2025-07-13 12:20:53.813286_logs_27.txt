============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- N is a four-digit positive integer (i.e., 1000 ≤ N ≤ 9999).
- N has the property that if any one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7.
- Q and R are defined by the division of N by 1000, i.e., N = 1000Q + R, where Q is the quotient and R the remainder.
- The problem asks for the value of Q + R.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The digits of N can be represented as a 4-digit sequence: d_1 d_2 d_3 d_4, with d_1 ≠ 0.
- Changing any single digit d_i to 1 produces a new number divisible by 7. This implies four divisibility conditions, one for each digit position.
- These conditions impose modular arithmetic constraints on N and its digits.
- The division of N by 1000 separates N into Q (the thousands digit) and R (the last three digits), linking the digit structure to quotient and remainder.
- The constraints likely restrict the possible digits of N significantly, influencing the structure of N and its divisibility properties.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- Number theory, specifically divisibility and modular arithmetic.
- Elementary algebra related to digit manipulation and place value.
- Potentially combinatorics in enumerating digit possibilities.
- Such problems commonly appear in mathematical competitions and recreational mathematics.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The problem does not explicitly state whether digits can be zero except for the leading digit, but standard four-digit number conventions imply d_1 ≠ 0.
- It is not specified whether the digit changed to 1 is allowed if it is already 1; presumably, the change must be to 1 from a different digit.
- The exact method to handle the divisibility conditions is not given, which may involve complex modular equations.
- Multiple numbers might satisfy the property; the problem specifies the greatest such number, implying a search or ordering.
- The remainder R when dividing by 1000 corresponds to the last three digits, but the problem does not explicitly state this, relying on standard division interpretation.
