============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- The problem involves a four-digit positive integer \(N\).
- \(N\) is the greatest such integer with a special property: changing any one of its digits to 1 results in a number divisible by 7.
- \(Q\) and \(R\) are defined as the quotient and remainder when \(N\) is divided by 1000, i.e., \(N = 1000Q + R\).
- The goal is to find \(Q + R\).

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The digits of \(N\) are interconnected through the divisibility condition: for each digit position, replacing that digit with 1 yields a number divisible by 7.
- This implies multiple divisibility constraints, one for each digit position, creating a system of modular equations.
- The condition that \(N\) is the greatest such number imposes an ordering constraint, likely requiring maximization under these modular conditions.
- The division by 1000 separates \(N\) into its thousands digit (\(Q\)) and the last three digits (\(R\)), which may be useful in analyzing or expressing the divisibility conditions.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem lies primarily in Number Theory, specifically modular arithmetic and divisibility.
- It also involves combinatorial reasoning about digits and constraints on digit replacement.
- Such problems are common in mathematical competitions and recreational mathematics.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The problem does not explicitly state whether \(N\) can have repeated digits or if leading digits can be 1 after replacement (though \(N\) itself is four-digit, so leading digit \(\neq 0\)).
- The exact method to handle the multiple divisibility conditions simultaneously may be complex.
- Potential challenges include managing multiple modular constraints and ensuring the maximality of \(N\) under these constraints.
