============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- A torus T is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis in the plane of the circle, at a distance 6 from the circle's center. This creates a standard torus with major radius R = 6 and minor radius r = 3.
- A sphere S has radius 11.
- The torus T rests on the outside of the sphere S in two different ways, each time being externally tangent to S along a circle.
- These two tangent circles have radii r_i and r_o respectively.
- The problem asks for the difference r_i - r_o expressed as a reduced fraction m/n, and then to find m + n.

Objective: To find the difference between the radii of the two tangent circles formed by the external tangency of the torus to the sphere in two distinct resting positions.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The torus is defined by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis 6 units away, so the torus' centerline circle has radius 6.
- The sphere of radius 11 is fixed.
- The torus rests on the sphere externally tangent along a circle, meaning the surfaces touch along a circle, not just a point.
- There are two such tangent configurations, producing two tangent circles with radii r_i and r_o.
- The difference r_i - r_o is sought.
- The tangency along a circle implies a geometric constraint relating the torus' and sphere's surfaces, likely involving distances between centers and radii.
- The two tangent circles correspond to two different positions or orientations of the torus relative to the sphere.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem lies in geometry, specifically 3D geometry involving surfaces of revolution.
- Concepts involved include torus geometry, sphere geometry, and external tangency conditions.
- The problem may also involve algebraic manipulation of distances and radii.
- Such problems are common in mathematical competitions and advanced geometry contexts.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The phrase "when T rests on the outside of S" is used twice, but the problem distinguishes two tangent circles r_i and r_o; it is ambiguous how these two configurations differ.
- The exact positions or orientations of the torus relative to the sphere in each tangent case are not explicitly described.
- It is not stated whether the torus is oriented in a particular way or if it can be rotated.
- The problem assumes knowledge of how the torus and sphere can be tangent along a circle externally, which may require assumptions about their relative placement.

Reasonable assumptions to proceed might include:
- The torus is positioned so that its axis is aligned in a certain way relative to the sphere.
- The two tangent circles correspond to the torus touching the sphere at the inner and outer edges of the torus' tube.
- The problem likely expects using the standard torus parameters (major radius 6, minor radius 3) and sphere radius 11 to find the radii of the tangent circles geometrically.

Overall, the problem involves understanding the geometry of a torus and a sphere in 3D space, analyzing their external tangency along circles, and computing the difference in radii of these tangent circles.
