============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- Variables: x, y, z are positive real numbers.
- Equations:
  \[ \log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}, \quad \log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}, \quad \log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4} \]
- Objective: Find the value of \( \left| \log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) \right| \) expressed as a reduced fraction \( \frac{m}{n} \), then compute \( m + n \).

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- Each equation relates the logarithm of a ratio involving one variable over the product of the other two.
- Using logarithm properties, these can be rewritten as linear equations in \( \log_2 x, \log_2 y, \log_2 z \).
- The system is linear in the variables \( a = \log_2 x, b = \log_2 y, c = \log_2 z \).
- The target expression \( \log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = 4a + 3b + 2c \) is a linear combination of these variables.
- The constraints ensure a unique solution for \(a,b,c\), enabling computation of the target.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- Primary domain: Algebra, specifically logarithmic equations and linear algebra.
- Subfields: Properties of logarithms, solving linear systems.
- Contexts: Common in mathematical competitions and problem-solving involving logarithmic identities.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The problem states x, y, z are positive, so logarithms are well-defined.
- No ambiguity in the base of logarithm (base 2) or the form of the equations.
- The absolute value and fraction reduction require careful handling after solving.
- Assumptions: Variables are strictly positive real numbers; logarithms are real-valued.
- Potential challenge: Ensuring fraction is reduced and correctly summing numerator and denominator.

Using the logarithm property log(a/b) = log(a) - log(b), we rewrite each equation in terms of a = log2(x), b = log2(y), and c = log2(z). For the first equation, log2(x/(yz)) = log2(x) - log2(y) - log2(z) = a - b - c = 1/2. Similarly, the second equation becomes b - a - c = 1/3, and the third becomes c - a - b = 1/4. Thus, the system of equations is linear in a, b, and c: a - b - c = 1/2, b - a - c = 1/3, c - a - b = 1/4.

We define a = log2(x), b = log2(y), c = log2(z). Using the logarithm quotient rule, log2(M/N) = log2(M) - log2(N), we rewrite each equation:\n\n1) log2(x) - log2(y) - log2(z) = 1/2  => a - b - c = 1/2\n2) log2(y) - log2(x) - log2(z) = 1/3  => b - a - c = 1/3\n3) log2(z) - log2(x) - log2(y) = 1/4  => c - a - b = 1/4\n\nThese are linear equations in variables a, b, c.

The problem asks for the absolute value of this result, which means we take the positive value of the fraction. The absolute value of -25/8 is 25/8. Next, we check if the fraction 25/8 is in lowest terms. The numerator 25 factors as 5*5, and the denominator 8 factors as 2*2*2. Since there are no common factors between 25 and 8 other than 1, the fraction is already in lowest terms. Therefore, the relatively prime numerator m is 25 and the denominator n is 8.
