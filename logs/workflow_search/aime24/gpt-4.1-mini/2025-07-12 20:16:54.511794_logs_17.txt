[{'objective': 'Rewrite the given polynomial expression in terms of symmetric sums of a, b, and c to simplify the equation.'}, {'objective': 'Use the constraint a + b + c = 300 to express the polynomial condition in terms of symmetric sums and reduce the problem.'}, {'objective': 'Determine all nonnegative integer triples (a,b,c) satisfying the simplified polynomial equation and the sum constraint.'}, {'objective': 'Count the number of valid triples (a,b,c) that meet both conditions.'}]
