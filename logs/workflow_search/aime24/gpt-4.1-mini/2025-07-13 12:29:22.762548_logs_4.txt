============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- There exists a prime number p, which is the least prime with a certain property.
- There exists a positive integer n such that p^2 divides n^4 + 1.
- The problem asks to find the least positive integer m such that p^2 divides m^4 + 1.
- Key entities: prime number p, positive integers n and m, expression n^4 + 1.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The divisibility condition p^2 | n^4 + 1 implies that n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p^2).
- Since p is prime, the problem involves modular arithmetic and properties of residues modulo prime powers.
- The condition that p is the least prime with such an n suggests uniqueness or minimality constraints on p.
- The search for the least m with the same divisibility condition indicates a minimal solution in the modular arithmetic context.
- The problem likely involves understanding the structure of the multiplicative group modulo p^2 and the existence of fourth roots of -1 modulo p^2.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- Number theory, specifically modular arithmetic and properties of prime powers.
- Subfields: multiplicative group theory modulo prime powers, possibly quadratic and higher power residues.
- Contexts: problems involving divisibility, prime factorization, and modular equations common in mathematical competitions and research in algebraic number theory.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The problem does not specify whether n and m must be distinct or if m can equal n.
- It is not explicitly stated whether p^2 divides n^4 + 1 exactly or if higher powers of p might also divide it.
- The uniqueness or multiplicity of such n and m is not addressed.
- Potential challenges include determining the existence of such primes p and integers n, m, and handling computations modulo p^2 which can be nontrivial.

More precisely, for n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p) to have a solution, p must satisfy p ≡ 1 (mod 8), because the multiplicative group modulo p is cyclic of order p-1, and the existence of an element of order 8 requires 8 divides p-1. Next, lifting the solution from modulo p to modulo p^2 involves Hensel\'s lemma or similar lifting arguments. The existence of n such that n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p^2) requires that the derivative of the polynomial f(x) = x^4 + 1 at the solution modulo p is not congruent to 0 modulo p, ensuring the solution can be lifted. Since f\'(x) = 4x^3, and n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p), n is invertible modulo p, so f\'(n) ≠ 0 mod p. Therefore, solutions modulo p can be lifted to modulo p^2. Summarizing, the necessary conditions on prime p for the existence of n satisfying n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p^2) are: (1) p ≡ 1 (mod 8), ensuring -1 is a fourth power residue modulo p; (2) the solution modulo p can be lifted to modulo p^2 by Hensel\'s lemma. Hence, the least prime p with such a property must be congruent to 1 modulo 8. The smallest such prime is 17.

Since p is prime, Fermat\'s little theorem and properties of the multiplicative group modulo p apply. The equation n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p) implies that -1 is a fourth power residue modulo p. For this to hold, the order of the multiplicative group modulo p, which is p-1, must be compatible with the existence of an element whose fourth power is -1.

First, note that 17 is prime and 17 ≡ 1 (mod 8), so there exist solutions to m^4 ≡ -1 (mod 17). We want to lift these solutions modulo 17 to modulo 289 using Hensel\'s lemma. \n\nStep 1: Find solutions to m^4 ≡ -1 (mod 17). Since -1 mod 17 is 16, we want m^4 ≡ 16 (mod 17).\n\nCheck powers modulo 17:\n- 1^4 = 1\n- 2^4 = 16 (since 2^4=16)\n- 3^4 = (3^2)^2 = 9^2 = 81 ≡ 81 - 4*17=81-68=13\n- 4^4 = (4^2)^2 = 16^2 = 256 ≡ 256 - 15*17=256-255=1\n- 5^4 = (5^2)^2 = 8^2=64 ≡ 64 - 3*17=64-51=13\n- 6^4 = (6^2)^2 = 2^2=4\n- 7^4 = (7^2)^2 = 15^2=225 ≡ 225 - 13*17=225-221=4\n- 8^4 = (8^2)^2 = 13^2=169 ≡ 169 - 9*17=169-153=16\n\nSo m=2 and m=8 satisfy m^4 ≡ 16 (mod 17).\n\nStep 2: Use Hensel\'s lemma to lift these solutions modulo 289.\n\nHensel\'s lemma applies if f(m) ≡ 0 (mod p) and f\'(m) ≠ 0 (mod p), where f(m) = m^4 + 1.\n\nCompute f\'(m) = 4m^3.\n\nFor m=2 mod 17:\nf\'(2) = 4 * 8 = 32 ≡ 32 - 1*17=15 ≠ 0 mod 17.\n\nFor m=8 mod 17:\nf\'(8) = 4 * 512 = 2048 ≡ 2048 - 120*17=2048-2040=8 ≠ 0 mod 17.\n\nSo both can be lifted.\n\nStep 3: Lift m=2 mod 17 to m mod 289.\n\nWe want m = 2 + 17t such that (2 + 17t)^4 ≡ -1 mod 289.\n\nExpand (2 + 17t)^4 mod 289 using binomial theorem and reduce terms modulo 289.\n\nCalculate (2 + 17t)^4 mod 289:\n(2 + 17t)^4 = 2^4 + 4*2^3*17t + 6*2^2*(17t)^2 + 4*2*(17t)^3 + (17t)^4\n= 16 + 4*8*17t + 6*4*289 t^2 + 4*2*17^3 t^3 + 17^4 t^4\n\nNote 289 = 17^2, so terms with 289 or higher powers vanish mod 289.\n\nSo modulo 289, (2 + 17t)^4 ≡ 16 + 4*8*17t = 16 + 544 t mod 289.\n\n544 mod 289 = 544 - 1*289 = 255.\n\nSo (2 + 17t)^4 ≡ 16 + 255 t mod 289.\n\nWe want (2 + 17t)^4 ≡ -1 ≡ 288 mod 289.\n\nSo 16 + 255 t ≡ 288 mod 289\n=> 255 t ≡ 272 mod 289 (since 288 -16 = 272)\n\nNow solve 255 t ≡ 272 mod 289.\n\nFind inverse of 255 mod 289.\n\nUse Extended Euclidean Algorithm:\n289 = 255*1 + 34\n255 = 34*7 + 17\n34 = 17*2 + 0\n\nGCD is 17, not 1, so 255 and 289 are not coprime, no inverse exists.\n\nThis means no solution for t here.\n\nTry m=8 + 17t:\n\n(8 + 17t)^4 mod 289:\n8^4 = (8^2)^2 = 13^2 = 169 mod 17, but we need mod 289.\nCalculate 8^4 mod 289:\n8^2 = 64\n8^4 = 64^2 = 4096\n4096 mod 289:\n289*14=4046\n4096-4046=50\nSo 8^4 ≡ 50 mod 289.\n\nNow expand (8 + 17t)^4:\n= 8^4 + 4*8^3*17t + ... higher powers divisible by 289\nCalculate 8^3 mod 289:\n8^3 = 8*64=512\n512 mod 289 = 512 - 289 = 223\n\nSo (8 + 17t)^4 ≡ 50 + 4*223*17 t mod 289\n= 50 + 4*223*17 t\nCalculate 4*223*17:\n4*223=892\n892*17=15164\n15164 mod 289:\n289*52=15028\n15164-15028=136\n\nSo (8 + 17t)^4 ≡ 50 + 136 t mod 289\n\nWe want (8 + 17t)^4 ≡ -1 ≡ 288 mod 289\n\nSo 50 + 136 t ≡ 288 mod 289\n=> 136 t ≡ 238 mod 289 (since 288 - 50 = 238)\n\nNow solve 136 t ≡ 238 mod 289.\n\nCheck gcd(136,289):\n289 - 2*136 = 289 - 272 = 17\n136 - 8*17 = 136 - 136 = 0\nSo gcd is 17, not 1, no inverse.\n\nNo solution here either.\n\nTry m=9 + 17t:\n\nCheck m=9 mod 17:\n9^4 mod 17:\n9^2=81 ≡ 81 - 4*17=81-68=13\n9^4=13^2=169 ≡ 169 - 9*17=169-153=16\nSo 9^4 ≡ 16 mod 17, good.\n\nCalculate 9^4 mod 289:\n9^2=81\n9^4=81^2=6561\n6561 mod 289:\n289*22=6358\n6561-6358=203\nSo 9^4 ≡ 203 mod 289.\n\nExpand (9 + 17t)^4:\n9^4 + 4*9^3*17 t mod 289\nCalculate 9^3 mod 289:\n9^3=9*81=729\n729 mod 289:\n289*2=578\n729-578=151\n\nSo (9 + 17t)^4 ≡ 203 + 4*151*17 t mod 289\n4*151=604\n604*17=10268\n10268 mod 289:\n289*35=10115\n10268-10115=153\n\nSo (9 + 17t)^4 ≡ 203 + 153 t mod 289\n\nWant 203 + 153 t ≡ 288 mod 289\n=> 153 t ≡ 85 mod 289\n\nCheck gcd(153,289):\n289 - 1*153=136\n153 - 1*136=17\n136 - 8*17=0\nGCD=17\nNo inverse.\n\nTry m=6 + 17t:\n\n6^4 mod 17:\n6^2=36 ≡ 2\n6^4=2^2=4\nNot 16,

First, note that 17 is prime and 17 ≡ 1 (mod 8), so there exist solutions to m^4 ≡ -1 (mod 17). We want to lift these solutions modulo 17 to modulo 289 using Hensel\'s lemma. \n\nStep 1: Find solutions to m^4 ≡ -1 (mod 17). Since -1 mod 17 is 16, we want m^4 ≡ 16 (mod 17).\n\nCheck powers modulo 17:\n- 1^4 = 1\n- 2^4 = 16 (since 2^4=16)\n- 3^4 = (3^2)^2 = 9^2 = 81 ≡ 81 - 4*17=81-68=13\n- 4^4 = (4^2)^2 = 16^2 = 256 ≡ 256 - 15*17=256-255=1\n- 5^4 = (5^2)^2 = 8^2=64 ≡ 64 - 3*17=64-51=13\n- 6^4 = (6^2)^2 = 2^2=4\n- 7^4 = (7^2)^2 = 15^2=225 ≡ 225 - 13*17=225-221=4\n- 8^4 = (8^2)^2 = 13^2=169 ≡ 169 - 9*17=169-153=16\n\nSo m=2 and m=8 satisfy m^4 ≡ 16 (mod 17).\n\nStep 2: Use Hensel\'s lemma to lift these solutions modulo 289.\n\nHensel\'s lemma applies if f(m) ≡ 0 (mod p) and f\'(m) ≠ 0 (mod p), where f(m) = m^4 + 1.\n\nCompute f\'(m) = 4m^3.\n\nFor m=2 mod 17:\nf\'(2) = 4 * 8 = 32 ≡ 32 - 1*17=15 ≠ 0 mod 17.\n\nFor m=8 mod 17:\nf\'(8) = 4 * 512 = 2048 ≡ 2048 - 120*17=2048-2040=8 ≠ 0 mod 17.\n\nSo both can be lifted.\n\nStep 3: Lift m=2 mod 17 to m mod 289.\n\nWe want m = 2 + 17t such that (2 + 17t)^4 ≡ -1 mod 289.\n\nExpand (2 + 17t)^4 mod 289 using binomial theorem and reduce terms modulo 289.\n\nCalculate (2 + 17t)^4 mod 289:\n(2 + 17t)^4 = 2^4 + 4*2^3*17t + 6*2^2*(17t)^2 + 4*2*(17t)^3 + (17t)^4\n= 16 + 4*8*17t + 6*4*289 t^2 + 4*2*17^3 t^3 + 17^4 t^4\n\nNote 289 = 17^2, so terms with 289 or higher powers vanish mod 289.\n\nSo modulo 289, (2 + 17t)^4 ≡ 16 + 4*8*17t = 16 + 544 t mod 289.\n\n544 mod 289 = 544 - 1*289 = 255.\n\nSo (2 + 17t)^4 ≡ 16 + 255 t mod 289.\n\nWe want (2 + 17t)^4 ≡ -1 ≡ 288 mod 289.\n\nSo 16 + 255 t ≡ 288 mod 289\n=> 255 t ≡ 272 mod 289 (since 288 -16 = 272)\n\nNow solve 255 t ≡ 272 mod 289.\n\nFind inverse of 255 mod 289.\n\nUse Extended Euclidean Algorithm:\n289 = 255*1 + 34\n255 = 34*7 + 17\n34 = 17*2 + 0\n\nGCD is 17, not 1, so 255 and 289 are not coprime, no inverse exists.\n\nThis means no solution for t here.\n\nTry m=8 + 17t:\n\n(8 + 17t)^4 mod 289:\n8^4 = (8^2)^2 = 13^2 = 169 mod 17, but we need mod 289.\nCalculate 8^4 mod 289:\n8^2 = 64\n8^4 = 64^2 = 4096\n4096 mod 289:\n289*14=4046\n4096-4046=50\nSo 8^4 ≡ 50 mod 289.\n\nNow expand (8 + 17t)^4:\n= 8^4 + 4*8^3*17t + ... higher powers divisible by 289\nCalculate 8^3 mod 289:\n8^3 = 8*64=512\n512 mod 289 = 512 - 289 = 223\n\nSo (8 + 17t)^4 ≡ 50 + 4*223*17 t mod 289\n= 50 + 4*223*17 t\nCalculate 4*223*17:\n4*223=892\n892*17=15164\n15164 mod 289:\n289*52=15028\n15164-15028=136\n\nSo (8 + 17t)^4 ≡ 50 + 136 t mod 289\n\nWe want (8 + 17t)^4 ≡ -1 ≡ 288 mod 289\n\nSo 50 + 136 t ≡ 288 mod 289\n=> 136 t ≡ 238 mod 289 (since 288 - 50 = 238)\n\nNow solve 136 t ≡ 238 mod 289.\n\nCheck gcd(136,289):\n289 - 2*136 = 289 - 272 = 17\n136 - 8*17 = 136 - 136 = 0\nSo gcd is 17, not 1, no inverse.\n\nNo solution here either.\n\nTry m=9 + 17t:\n\nCheck m=9 mod 17:\n9^4 mod 17:\n9^2=81 ≡ 81 - 4*17=81-68=13\n9^4=13^2=169 ≡ 169 - 9*17=169-153=16\nSo 9^4 ≡ 16 mod 17, good.\n\nCalculate 9^4 mod 289:\n9^2=81\n9^4=81^2=6561\n6561 mod 289:\n289*22=6358\n6561-6358=203\nSo 9^4 ≡ 203 mod 289.\n\nExpand (9 + 17t)^4:\n9^4 + 4*9^3*17 t mod 289\nCalculate 9^3 mod 289:\n9^3=9*81=729\n729 mod 289:\n289*2=578\n729-578=151\n\nSo (9 + 17t)^4 ≡ 203 + 4*151*17 t mod 289\n4*151=604\n604*17=10268\n10268 mod 289:\n289*35=10115\n10268-10115=153\n\nSo (9 + 17t)^4 ≡ 203 + 153 t mod 289\n\nWant 203 + 153 t ≡ 288 mod 289\n=> 153 t ≡ 85 mod 289\n\nCheck gcd(153,289):\n289 - 1*153=136\n153 - 1*136=17\n136 - 8*17=0\nGCD=17\nNo inverse.\n\nTry m=6 + 17t:\n\n6^4 mod 17:\n6^2=36 ≡ 2\n6^4=2^2=4\nNot 16,

289:\n15^2=225\n15^4=225^2=50625\n50625 mod 289:\n289*175=50575\n50625-50575=50\n\n(15 + 17t)^4 ≡ 50 + 4*15^3*17 t mod 289\nCalculate 15^3 mod 289:\n15^3=15*225=3375\n3375 mod 289:\n289*11=3179\n3375-3179=196\n\nSo (15 + 17t)^4 ≡ 50 + 4*196*17 t mod 289\n4*196=784\n784*17=13328\n13328 mod 289:\n289*46=13294\n13328-13294=34\n\nSo (15 + 17t)^4 ≡ 50 + 34 t mod 289\n\nWant 50 + 34 t ≡ 288 mod 289\n=> 34 t ≡ 238 mod 289\n\nCheck gcd(34,289):\n289 - 8*34=289-272=17\n34 - 2*17=0\nGCD=17\nNo inverse.\n\nTry m=1 + 17t:\n\n1^4=1 mod 17, no.\n\nTry m=3 + 17t:\n\n3^4 mod 17=13,

First, we find solutions modulo 17 to m^4 ≡ -1 mod 17, which is m^4 ≡ 16 mod 17. Checking powers modulo 17, m=2 and m=8 satisfy this. Using Hensel\'s lemma, we attempt to lift these solutions modulo 289. For m=2 + 17t and m=8 + 17t, we try to find t such that m^4 ≡ 288 mod 289. Attempts to solve the linear congruences for t fail due to gcd conditions, so we resort to direct search. By checking m from 1 to 289, the minimal m found satisfying m^4 ≡ -1 mod 289 is m=110. This is verified by computing 110^4 mod 289, which equals 288, confirming the divisibility condition. Hence, the minimal positive integer m is 110.\n\n### answer by Final Decision Agent zqIC:\n110\n\n\nPlease think broadly, explore multiple dimensions (e.g., effectiveness, generalizability, popularity, clarity, efficiency, potential risks), and adapt your reasoning dynamically depending on the nature of the plans.
