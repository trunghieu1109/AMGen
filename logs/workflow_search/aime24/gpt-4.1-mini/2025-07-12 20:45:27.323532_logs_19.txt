============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- We have a primitive 13th root of unity omega, with omega ^13 = 1 and omega = 1 excluded.
- The product is taken over k = 0 to 12 of the expression (2 - 2omega^k + omega^{2k}).
- The task is to find the remainder when this product is divided by 1000.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The terms inside the product depend on powers of omega, which are roots of unity satisfying omega^{13} = 1.
- The expression inside the product can be viewed as evaluating a polynomial at omega^k.
- Since the product runs over all 13th roots of unity, this suggests a connection to the factorization of polynomials over roots of unity.
- The exclusion of omega = 1 is explicitly stated, so the product includes all roots including omega^0 = 1; however, the problem states omega 
eq 1, so the product is over all k from 0 to 12, but omega is a 13th root of unity not equal to 1, so the product is over all roots including 1.
- The expression inside the product can be rewritten or simplified using algebraic manipulation to identify a polynomial whose roots are omega^k.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem lies in algebra and number theory, specifically in the study of roots of unity and cyclotomic polynomials.
- It involves polynomial factorization, modular arithmetic, and properties of complex numbers.
- Such problems are common in mathematical competitions and abstract algebra contexts.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The problem states omega 
eq 1 is a 13th root of unity, but the product index k runs from 0 to 12, which includes omega^0 = 1. It is ambiguous whether the product includes the term for k=0 (i.e., omega^0=1) or only over the 12 nontrivial roots.
- The problem's wording suggests omega is a fixed root not equal to 1, but the product is over all powers 	extstyle ig\u03omega^k for k=0 to 12, which includes 1. Clarification on whether the product includes k=0 is needed.
- The expression inside the product might be simplified or factored, but the complexity of the powers and the modulo operation could pose computational challenges.
- Assumptions may be needed about the inclusion of k=0 term and the interpretation of omega as a primitive root to proceed.
