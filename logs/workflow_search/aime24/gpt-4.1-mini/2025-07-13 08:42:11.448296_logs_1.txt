============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- Triangle ABC is inscribed in circle \( \omega \).
- Tangents to \( \omega \) at points B and C intersect at point D.
- Line segment \( \overline{AD} \) intersects \( \omega \) again at point P.
- Side lengths are given: \( AB = 5 \), \( BC = 9 \), and \( AC = 10 \).
- The problem asks to find \( AP \) expressed as a reduced fraction \( \frac{m}{n} \), then compute \( m + n \).

Properties:
- \( ABC \) is a triangle inscribed in circle \( \omega \), so points A, B, C lie on \( \omega \).
- D is the intersection of tangents at B and C, so D lies outside \( \omega \) and is the ex-tangential point related to chord BC.
- P lies on \( \omega \) such that \( A, D, P \) are collinear.

Objective:
- Determine the length \( AP \) in simplest fractional form and find the sum of numerator and denominator.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The tangents at B and C intersect at D, implying D is the pole of chord BC with respect to \( \omega \).
- Since \( A, D, P \) are collinear and P lies on \( \omega \), P is the second intersection of line AD with the circle.
- The given side lengths allow determination of triangle dimensions and potentially the circle's radius or other parameters.
- The problem likely involves properties of power of a point, pole-polar relationships, or harmonic divisions.
- The tangency condition at B and C constrains D uniquely, influencing the position of P.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem is primarily in Euclidean Geometry.
- Subfields include Circle Geometry, specifically properties of tangents, chords, and poles/polars.
- Concepts such as power of a point, chord lengths, and line-circle intersections are relevant.
- Such problems commonly appear in mathematical competitions and advanced geometry studies.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The exact position of point A is not explicitly given, only side lengths; however, since ABC is inscribed in \( \omega \), the triangle is determined up to congruence.
- The problem assumes a unique configuration of ABC and circle \( \omega \) consistent with the given side lengths.
- It is assumed that \( P \neq A \) and that \( AD \) intersects \( \omega \) at exactly two points (A and P).
- No ambiguity in the definition of tangents or intersection points is present.
- Potential challenge: computing \( AP \) requires understanding the interplay between the tangents and the circle, possibly involving coordinate geometry or power of a point.
- Reasonable assumptions include that the triangle is non-degenerate and the circle is uniquely defined by ABC.
