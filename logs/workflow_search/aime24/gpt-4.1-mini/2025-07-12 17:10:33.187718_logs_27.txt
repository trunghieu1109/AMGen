============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- N is a four-digit positive integer (i.e., 1000 ≤ N ≤ 9999).
- N has the property that if any one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7.
- Q and R are defined as the quotient and remainder when N is divided by 1000, i.e., N = 1000Q + R, with Q an integer between 1 and 9 (since N is four-digit) and 0 ≤ R < 1000.
- The objective is to find Q + R.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- Changing any one digit of N to 1 produces a number divisible by 7. This implies that for each digit position, replacing that digit with 1 yields a multiple of 7.
- Since there are four digits, there are four such numbers, each divisible by 7.
- The divisibility conditions impose modular arithmetic constraints on the digits of N.
- The problem asks for the greatest such N, so among all numbers satisfying the property, the maximum is sought.
- Q and R come from dividing N by 1000, so Q is the thousands digit and R is the last three digits.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- Number theory, specifically divisibility and modular arithmetic.
- Elementary algebra related to digit manipulation.
- Possibly combinatorics in considering digit replacements.
- Such problems are common in mathematical competitions and recreational mathematics.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The problem states "whenever one of its digits is changed to 1," but does not specify if the digit is already 1 or different; presumably, changing a digit to 1 even if it is already 1 counts as well.
- It is not explicitly stated whether leading zeros are allowed after digit replacement; presumably, the resulting numbers remain four-digit numbers.
- The exact method to handle the divisibility conditions is not given, which may require assumptions about modular constraints.
- The problem assumes standard base-10 representation.
- No ambiguity in Q and R definitions, but it is important to note Q is the thousands digit and R the last three digits.

Overall, the problem involves analyzing digit-wise modular conditions to find the maximum four-digit number N such that changing any digit to 1 yields a multiple of 7, then computing Q + R from N.
