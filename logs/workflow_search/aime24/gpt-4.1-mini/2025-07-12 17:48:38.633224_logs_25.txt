============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- The figure is a convex equilateral hexagon ABCDEF, meaning all six sides have equal length.
- The hexagon has the property that all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. Since it is a hexagon, opposite sides are AB and DE, BC and EF, CD and FA.
- A triangle is formed by the extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF. The sides of this triangle have lengths 200, 240, and 300.
- The objective is to find the common side length of the hexagon.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The hexagon is equilateral and has pairs of opposite sides parallel, implying it is a special type of hexagon, often called an affine-regular or equilateral hexagon with parallel opposite sides.
- The triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF suggests that these three lines (or their extensions) intersect pairwise to form a triangle outside or around the hexagon.
- The side lengths of this triangle (200, 240, 300) correspond to distances between intersection points of these extended lines.
- The parallelism and equal side length conditions impose strong geometric constraints, likely allowing the use of vector or coordinate geometry to relate the hexagon's side length to the triangle's side lengths.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem lies primarily in Euclidean geometry, specifically polygon geometry.
- Subfields include affine geometry (due to parallelism and equilateral conditions), and possibly vector geometry or analytic geometry for relating side lengths and directions.
- Such problems are common in mathematical competitions and advanced geometry studies.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The exact configuration of the hexagon (e.g., orientation, labeling of vertices) is not fully specified but can be inferred from the naming.
- The nature of the triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF: whether the sides 200, 240, 300 correspond to distances between intersection points of these extended lines or some other measure.
- It is assumed the hexagon is convex and equilateral with opposite sides parallel, which restricts its shape but does not uniquely determine it without further assumptions.
- The problem assumes the triangle formed by the extended lines is well-defined and non-degenerate.
- To proceed, one might assume standard orientation or use vector methods to model the hexagon and the triangle.
