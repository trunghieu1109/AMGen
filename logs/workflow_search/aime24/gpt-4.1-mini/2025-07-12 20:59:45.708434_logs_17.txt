============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- Variables: Nonnegative integers a, b, c.
- Constraint 1: a + b + c = 300.
- Constraint 2: a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.
- Objective: Find the number of such triples (a,b,c) satisfying both constraints.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The sum constraint restricts the triples to lie on the plane a + b + c = 300 in the nonnegative integer lattice.
- The second condition is a symmetric homogeneous polynomial of degree 3, summing terms of the form a^2b and permutations.
- The expression can be rewritten or analyzed using symmetric sums or by grouping terms, possibly relating to known symmetric polynomial identities.
- The constraints together define a discrete set of points on a plane intersected with a cubic polynomial equation.
- The problem likely requires understanding how the polynomial expression varies over the integer lattice points on the plane and counting those that yield the given value.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- Primary domain: Combinatorics (counting integer solutions under constraints).
- Secondary domains: Algebra (symmetric polynomials), Number Theory (integer solutions), possibly Discrete Geometry.
- Contexts: Problems of this type appear in combinatorial enumeration, algebraic combinatorics, and mathematical competitions.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The problem is clear in its statement; however, the complexity lies in handling the polynomial constraint.
- Potential challenges include the complexity of the polynomial expression and the large sum constraint.
- Assumptions: Variables are nonnegative integers; no other constraints are given.
- It may be helpful to consider symmetry to reduce the search space or to express the polynomial in terms of symmetric sums (e.g., a+b+c, ab+bc+ca, abc) to simplify analysis.
