============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- The variable N is defined as the greatest four-digit positive integer with a special divisibility property.
- The property: Changing any one digit of N to 1 results in a number divisible by 7.
- Q and R are defined as the quotient and remainder when N is divided by 1000, i.e., N = 1000Q + R, with Q and R integers.
- The problem asks for the sum Q + R.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- N is a four-digit integer, so 1000 ≤ N ≤ 9999.
- The key condition involves digit manipulation: for each digit position in N, replacing that digit with 1 yields a number divisible by 7.
- This implies multiple divisibility conditions, one for each digit position, creating a system of modular constraints.
- The quotient Q corresponds to the thousands digit(s) of N, and R corresponds to the last three digits.
- The problem’s structure suggests exploring modular arithmetic and digit-based transformations.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- Number theory, specifically divisibility and modular arithmetic.
- Elementary algebra related to digit manipulation and place value.
- Potentially combinatorics or logic in considering all digit replacements.
- Such problems commonly appear in mathematical competitions and recreational mathematics.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The problem states "whenever one of its digits is changed to 1," but does not specify if the digit is already 1 or different; presumably, the digit is replaced regardless of its original value.
- It is not explicitly stated whether leading digits can be changed to 1, but since N is four-digit, changing the first digit to 1 still yields a four-digit number.
- The problem assumes standard decimal representation without leading zeros.
- Potential challenges include handling multiple modular conditions simultaneously and ensuring the greatest such N is found.
