Taking natural logarithms of both equations gives: (a) x ln(y) = 10 ln(x) and (b) 10 ln(y) = 4y ln(x). From (a), we express ln(y) = (10 ln(x)) / x.

Substituting y = 25 / x back into the first equation y^x = x^{10} gives (25 / x)^x = x^{10}, which can be rewritten as 25^x = x^{x + 10}.

Since x > 1, we can equate exponents: 100/x = 4y. Hence, y = 100/(4x) = 25/x. Now, recall from equation (1) that y = x^{10/x}. Equate these two expressions for y: x^{10/x} = 25/x. Multiply both sides by x: x^{1 + 10/x} = 25. This is a transcendental equation in x, but it relates x and y explicitly. Also, from y = 25/x, we can find the product xy = x * (25/x) = 25. Thus, the product xy is 25. This is the combined relation and the value of the product xy.

From equation (1), we can express y in terms of x: y = (x^{10})^{1/x} = x^{10/x}. Substitute this expression for y into equation (2): (x^{10/x})^{10} = x^{4y} => x^{100/x} = x^{4y}. Since x > 1, we can equate exponents: 100/x = 4y. Hence, y = 100/(4x) = 25/x. Now, recall from equation (1) that y = x^{10/x}. Equate these two expressions for y: x^{10/x} = 25/x. Multiply both sides by x: x^{1 + 10/x} = 25. This is a transcendental equation in x, but it relates x and y explicitly. Also, from y = 25/x, we can find the product xy = x * (25/x) = 25. Thus, the product xy is 25. This is the combined relation and the value of the product xy. The step-by-step reasoning involves rewriting the logarithmic equations into exponential form, expressing one variable in terms of the other, substituting back, and simplifying to find a direct relation and the product xy.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent 8vme:\nWe start with the two exponential equations derived from the logarithmic equations: (1) y^x = x^{10} and (2) y^{10} = x^{4y}.

Our goal is to find x > 1 and y > 1 satisfying both. Since y = 25 / x, for y > 1, we must have 25 / x > 1, which implies x < 25. Combined with x > 1, we have 1 < x < 25. Now, consider the transcendental equation: (x + 10)/x * ln(x) = ln(25). We can rewrite it as ln(x) + (10 / x) * ln(x) = ln(25). The function f(x) = (x + 10)/x * ln(x) is continuous and increasing for x > 1 because ln(x) is increasing and positive, and (x+10)/x decreases but remains positive. At x = 1, f(1) = (1+10)/1 * ln(1) = 11 * 0 = 0. At x = 25, f(25) = (25 + 10)/25 * ln(25) = (35/25) * ln(25) = 1.4 * ln(25). Since ln(25) > 3, 1.4 * ln(25) > ln(25), so the function value at 25 exceeds ln(25). Therefore, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there exists a unique x in (1, 25) such that f(x) = ln(25). This x satisfies the transcendental equation. Once x is found, y = 25 / x follows directly. Both x and y are greater than 1, satisfying the domain conditions. Finally, the product xy = x * (25 / x) = 25. Thus, the explicit constraint is that x is the unique solution in (1, 25) of (x + 10)/x * ln(x) = ln(25), and y = 25 / x, with xy = 25.

Since y = 25 / x, y > 1 implies 25 / x > 1, or x < 25. Combined with x > 1, we have 1 < x < 25. Now, consider the transcendental equation: (x + 10)/x * ln(x) = ln(25). Define f(x) = ((x + 10)/x) * ln(x). We want f(x) = ln(25). Note ln(25) = 2 * ln(5) ≈ 3.2189. We analyze f(x) on (1, 25): As x approaches 1 from the right, ln(x) approaches 0+, so f(x) approaches 0. As x approaches 25, ln(25) ≈ 3.2189, and (x + 10)/x = (25 + 10)/25 = 35/25 = 1.4, so f(25) ≈ 1.4 * 3.2189 ≈ 4.5065 > ln(25). Since f(x) is continuous on (1, 25), and f(1) ≈ 0 < ln(25) < f(25) ≈ 4.5065, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there is at least one solution x in (1, 25) such that f(x) = ln(25). Also, f(x) is increasing in this range (because ln(x) increases and (x + 10)/x decreases slowly but product increases), so the solution is unique.

At x = 1, f(1) = (1+10)/1 * ln(1) = 11 * 0 = 0. At x = 25, f(25) = (25 + 10)/25 * ln(25) = (35/25) * ln(25) = 1.4 * ln(25). Since ln(25) > 3, 1.4 * ln(25) > ln(25), so the function value at 25 exceeds ln(25). Therefore, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there exists a unique x in (1, 25) such that f(x) = ln(25). This x satisfies the transcendental equation. Once x is found, y = 25 / x follows directly. Both x and y are greater than 1, satisfying the domain conditions. Finally, the product xy = x * (25 / x) = 25. Thus, the explicit constraint is that x is the unique solution in (1, 25) of (x + 10)/x * ln(x) = ln(25), and y = 25 / x, with xy = 25. This fully characterizes the solution under the given conditions.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent zDVY:\nStarting from the simplified system in Sub-task 3, we have y = 25 / x and the transcendental equation (x + 10)/x * ln(x) = ln(25).

Since y = 25 / x, y > 1 implies 25 / x > 1, or x < 25. Combined with x > 1, we have 1 < x < 25. Now, consider the transcendental equation: (x + 10)/x * ln(x) = ln(25). Define f(x) = ((x + 10)/x) * ln(x). We want f(x) = ln(25). Note ln(25) = 2 * ln(5) ≈ 3.2189. We analyze f(x) on (1, 25): As x approaches 1 from the right, ln(x) approaches 0+, so f(x) approaches 0. As x approaches 25, ln(25) ≈ 3.2189, and (x + 10)/x = (25 + 10)/25 = 35/25 = 1.4, so f(25) ≈ 1.4 * 3.2189 ≈ 4.5065 > ln(25). Since f(x) is continuous on (1, 25), and f(1) ≈ 0 < ln(25) < f(25) ≈ 4.5065, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there is at least one solution x in (1, 25) such that f(x) = ln(25). Also, f(x) is increasing in this range (because ln(x) increases and (x + 10)/x decreases slowly but product increases), so the solution is unique. Thus, there exists a unique x in (1, 25) satisfying the equation, and y = 25 / x > 1. Hence, the explicit constraints are: 1 < x < 25, y = 25 / x > 1, and (x + 10)/x * ln(x) = ln(25).

Since y = 25 / x, for y > 1, we require 25 / x > 1, which implies x < 25. Combined with x > 1, this restricts x to the interval (1, 25). The function f(x) = ((x + 10)/x) * ln(x) is continuous and increasing on (1, 25) because ln(x) is increasing and positive, and (x + 10)/x decreases but remains positive. Evaluating at the endpoints: f(1) = 11 * ln(1) = 0, which is less than ln(25), and f(25) = (35/25) * ln(25) = 1.4 * ln(25), which is greater than ln(25). By the Intermediate Value Theorem, there exists a unique x in (1, 25) such that f(x) = ln(25). Once x is found, y = 25 / x follows directly and is greater than 1. The product xy = x * (25 / x) = 25 is constant regardless of the exact values of x and y, as long as they satisfy the transcendental equation and domain conditions. Therefore, the explicit solution is characterized by x being the unique solution in (1, 25) of (x + 10)/x * ln(x) = ln(25), y = 25 / x, both greater than 1, and the product xy = 25.
