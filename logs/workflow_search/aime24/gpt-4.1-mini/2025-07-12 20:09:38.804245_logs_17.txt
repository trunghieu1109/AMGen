[{'objective': 'Rewrite the polynomial equation in terms of symmetric sums or simpler symmetric expressions involving a, b, and c'}, {'objective': 'Use the constraint a + b + c = 300 to reduce the problem to an equation in two variables'}, {'objective': 'Express the polynomial condition in terms of the reduced variables using the sum constraint'}, {'objective': 'Enumerate possible integer values for one variable and solve for the others to satisfy both conditions'}, {'objective': 'Count the number of nonnegative integer triples (a,b,c) that satisfy both the sum and polynomial equations'}]
