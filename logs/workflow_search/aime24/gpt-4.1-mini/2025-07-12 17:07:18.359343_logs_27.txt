============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- N is a four-digit positive integer (i.e., 1000 ≤ N ≤ 9999).
- N has the property that if any one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7.
- Q and R are defined by the division of N by 1000, i.e., N = 1000Q + R, where Q is the quotient and R the remainder.
- The task is to find Q + R.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- Changing one digit of N to 1 creates a new number divisible by 7. This implies that for each digit position i (thousands, hundreds, tens, units), replacing the digit d_i with 1 yields a number divisible by 7.
- Since only one digit is changed at a time, there are exactly four such numbers (one for each digit position) all divisible by 7.
- The problem requires finding the greatest such N, so among all four-digit numbers satisfying this property, the maximum is sought.
- The division N ÷ 1000 separates N into its thousands digit (Q) and the last three digits (R). The sum Q + R is then requested.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- Number theory, specifically divisibility and modular arithmetic.
- Digit manipulation and properties of integers.
- Possibly combinatorics or modular constraints on digits.
- Such problems are common in mathematical competitions and recreational mathematics.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The problem does not explicitly state whether the digits of N can be zero except for the leading digit (which must be nonzero for a four-digit number).
- It is assumed that changing a digit to 1 means replacing the original digit at that position with 1, regardless of its original value.
- The problem does not specify if the resulting number after digit change must remain four-digit; presumably yes, since changing the thousands digit to 1 keeps it four-digit.
- Potential challenge: ensuring all four modified numbers are divisible by 7 simultaneously, which imposes modular constraints on digits.
- Assumption: standard decimal representation, no leading zeros, and digit changes are independent and only one digit changed at a time.

- N is a four-digit positive integer (i.e., 1000 ≤ N ≤ 9999).
- N has the property that if any one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7.
- Q and R are defined as the quotient and remainder when N is divided by 1000, i.e., N = 1000Q + R, with Q an integer between 1 and 9 (since N is four-digit) and 0 ≤ R < 1000.
- The objective is to find Q + R.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- Changing any one digit of N to 1 produces a number divisible by 7. This implies that for each digit position, replacing that digit with 1 yields a multiple of 7.
- Since N is four-digit, it has digits d_4 d_3 d_2 d_1 (thousands to units). For each position i, the number formed by replacing d_i with 1 must be divisible by 7.
- This creates a system of divisibility constraints linking the digits of N.
- The problem asks for the greatest such N, so among all numbers satisfying these constraints, the maximum is sought.
- Q and R come from dividing N by 1000, so Q is the thousands digit and R is the last three digits.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The problem states "whenever one of its digits is changed to 1," but does not specify if the digit is already 1 or different; presumably, changing a digit to 1 means replacing it regardless of its current value.
- It is not explicitly stated whether the digits can be zero or any digit 0–9; however, since N is four-digit, the leading digit cannot be zero.
- The problem does not specify if multiple digits can be 1 initially; this may affect the divisibility conditions.
- The problem assumes standard base-10 representation.
- The main challenge is to handle the multiple divisibility conditions simultaneously and find the greatest N satisfying them.
