============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- Total residents: 900.
- Number owning diamond ring (D): 195.
- Number owning golf clubs (G): 367.
- Number owning garden spade (S): 562.
- Every resident owns a bag of candy hearts (C), so all 900 own C.
- Number owning exactly two of these items: 437.
- Number owning exactly three of these items: 234.
- Objective: Find the number of residents owning all four items (D, G, S, and C).

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- Since all own candy hearts, the problem reduces to analyzing ownership of D, G, and S along with C.
- The counts for exactly two and exactly three items include candy hearts as one of the items.
- The problem involves set intersections and unions, with constraints on exact counts of residents owning certain numbers of items.
- The condition that everyone owns candy hearts simplifies some intersections but complicates counting exactly two or three items.
- The number owning all four items corresponds to the intersection of all four sets.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem is in combinatorics and set theory.
- Specifically, it involves inclusion-exclusion principles and counting subsets.
- Such problems are common in discrete mathematics and mathematical competitions.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- It is not explicitly stated whether the counts for exactly two and exactly three items include candy hearts or only among the other three items.
- The interpretation of "exactly two" and "exactly three" items needs to be clarified given that candy hearts are owned by all.
- Assumption likely needed: candy hearts is counted as one of the items in the totals for exactly two and exactly three.
- Potential challenge: disentangling the counts given the universal ownership of candy hearts.

This formalism sets the foundation for analyzing ownership patterns and solving for the number of residents owning all four items.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent XIVk:\nWe have four sets representing the ownership of each item among the 900 residents of Aimeville: D (diamond ring), G (golf clubs), S (garden spade), and C (candy hearts). Since every resident owns candy hearts, C includes all 900 residents. We define variables for the sizes of all possible intersections of these sets to analyze ownership patterns. These variables include the number of residents owning exactly one item, exactly two items, exactly three items, and all four items. Specifically, we define the following variables:\n\n- |D|, |G|, |S|, |C|: the sizes of the individual sets.\n- |D ∩ G|, |D ∩ S|, |D ∩ C|, |G ∩ S|, |G ∩ C|, |S ∩ C|: sizes of all pairwise intersections.\n- |D ∩ G ∩ S|, |D ∩ G ∩ C|, |D ∩ S ∩ C|, |G ∩ S ∩ C|: sizes of all triple intersections.\n- |D ∩ G ∩ S ∩ C|: size of the quadruple intersection.\n\nBecause C includes all residents, intersections involving C simplify to the corresponding intersections among D, G, and S. However, since the problem counts candy hearts as one of the items in \'exactly two\' and \'exactly three\' items, we must keep C in the representation explicitly to analyze ownership counts correctly.\n\nWe also define variables for the number of residents owning exactly one item (only one of D, G, S, or C), exactly two items, exactly three items, and all four items. These variables are crucial to apply inclusion-exclusion principles and solve for the unknown intersections.\n\nAssumption: Since candy hearts is universally owned, any resident owning exactly one item must own only candy hearts (C) and none of D, G, or S. Similarly, residents owning exactly two items must own candy hearts plus exactly one of the other items, or exactly two of the other items without candy hearts (which is impossible since candy hearts is universal). Therefore, the variables and intersections must be defined to reflect these ownership patterns including candy hearts as one of the items.\n\nHence, the formal representation is:\n\n- Let D, G, S, C be the sets of residents owning diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts respectively.\n- Define variables for the cardinalities of all relevant intersections: |D|=195, |G|=367, |S|=562, |C|=900.\n- Define variables for all pairwise intersections: |D ∩ G|, |D ∩ S|, |D ∩ C|, |G ∩ S|, |G ∩ C|, |S ∩ C|.\n- Define variables for all triple intersections: |D ∩ G ∩ S|, |D ∩ G ∩ C|, |D ∩ S ∩ C|, |G ∩ S ∩ C|.\n- Define variable for the quadruple intersection: |D ∩ G ∩ S ∩ C|.\n\nThese variables provide the framework needed to analyze the ownership patterns and solve the problem using inclusion-exclusion and given counts for exactly two and exactly three items owned.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent qpBi:\nWe have four sets representing ownership of items among the 900 residents: D (diamond ring), G (golf clubs), S (garden spade), and C (candy hearts). Since every resident owns candy hearts, the set C includes all 900 residents (C = 900). To analyze ownership patterns, we define variables for the sizes of all relevant intersections of these sets. These include single sets (|D|, |G|, |S|, |C|), pairwise intersections (|D ∩ G|, |D ∩ S|, |D ∩ C|, |G ∩ S|, |G ∩ C|, |S ∩ C|), triple intersections (|D ∩ G ∩ S|, |D ∩ G ∩ C|, |D ∩ S ∩ C|, |G ∩ S ∩ C|), and the quadruple intersection (|D ∩ G ∩ S ∩ C|). Because C includes all residents, intersections involving C with any other set equal the size of the other set (e.g., |D ∩ C| = |D|). However, for completeness and clarity in solving, we keep these variables. We also define variables for the number of residents owning exactly one item, exactly two items, exactly three items, and all four items, as these counts are central to the problem. Assumptions made include: candy hearts is counted among the items owned in exactly two and exactly three ownership counts; all intersections are well-defined subsets of the 900 residents; and the sets are subsets of the universal set of 900 residents. This formal representation and variable definition set the stage for applying inclusion-exclusion principles and further analysis.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent FqZI:\nWe have four sets representing the residents owning each item: D (diamond rings), G (golf clubs), S (garden spades), and C (candy hearts).

Given that |C| = 900 (all residents). Define variables for all relevant intersections: \n- Pairwise intersections: |D ∩ G|, |D ∩ S|, |G ∩ S|, |D ∩ C|, |G ∩ C|, |S ∩ C|.\n- Triple intersections: |D ∩ G ∩ S|, |D ∩ G ∩ C|, |D ∩ S ∩ C|, |G ∩ S ∩ C|.\n- Quadruple intersection: |D ∩ G ∩ S ∩ C|.\nSince every resident owns candy hearts, |D ∩ C| = |D|, |G ∩ C| = |G|, and |S ∩ C| = |S|, and similarly for triple intersections involving C. This formalism sets the foundation for analyzing ownership patterns and solving for the number of residents owning all four items.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent XIVk:\nWe have four sets representing the ownership of each item among the 900 residents of Aimeville: D (diamond ring), G (golf clubs), S (garden spade), and C (candy hearts). Since every resident owns candy hearts, C includes all 900 residents. We define variables for the sizes of all possible intersections of these sets to analyze ownership patterns. These variables include the number of residents owning exactly one item, exactly two items, exactly three items, and all four items. Specifically, we define the following variables:\n\n- |D|, |G|, |S|, |C|: the sizes of the individual sets.\n- |D ∩ G|, |D ∩ S|, |D ∩ C|, |G ∩ S|, |G ∩ C|, |S ∩ C|: sizes of all pairwise intersections.\n- |D ∩ G ∩ S|, |D ∩ G ∩ C|, |D ∩ S ∩ C|, |G ∩ S ∩ C|: sizes of all triple intersections.\n- |D ∩ G ∩ S ∩ C|: size of the quadruple intersection.\n\nBecause C includes all residents, intersections involving C simplify to the corresponding intersections among D, G, and S. However, since the problem counts candy hearts as one of the items in \'exactly two\' and \'exactly three\' items, we must keep C in the representation explicitly to analyze ownership counts correctly.\n\nWe also define variables for the number of residents owning exactly one item (only one of D, G, S, or C), exactly two items, exactly three items, and all four items. These variables are crucial to apply inclusion-exclusion principles and solve for the unknown intersections.\n\nAssumption: Since candy hearts is universally owned, any resident owning exactly one item must own only candy hearts (C) and none of D, G, or S. Similarly, residents owning exactly two items must own candy hearts plus exactly one of the other items, or exactly two of the other items without candy hearts (which is impossible since candy hearts is universal). Therefore, the variables and intersections must be defined to reflect these ownership patterns including candy hearts as one of the items.\n\nHence, the formal representation is:\n\n- Let D, G, S, C be the sets of residents owning diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts respectively.\n- Define variables for the cardinalities of all relevant intersections: |D|=195, |G|=367, |S|=562, |C|=900.\n- Define variables for all pairwise intersections: |D ∩ G|, |D ∩ S|, |D ∩ C|, |G ∩ S|, |G ∩ C|, |S ∩ C|.\n- Define variables for all triple intersections: |D ∩ G ∩ S|, |D ∩ G ∩ C|, |D ∩ S ∩ C|, |G ∩ S ∩ C|.\n- Define variable for the quadruple intersection: |D ∩ G ∩ S ∩ C|.\n\nThese variables provide the framework needed to analyze the ownership patterns and solve the problem using inclusion-exclusion and given counts for exactly two and exactly three items owned.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent qpBi:\nWe have four sets representing ownership of items among the 900 residents: D (diamond ring), G (golf clubs), S (garden spade), and C (candy hearts). Since every resident owns candy hearts, the set C includes all 900 residents (C = 900). To analyze ownership patterns, we define variables for the sizes of all relevant intersections of these sets. These include single sets (|D|, |G|, |S|, |C|), pairwise intersections (|D ∩ G|, |D ∩ S|, |D ∩ C|, |G ∩ S|, |G ∩ C|, |S ∩ C|), triple intersections (|D ∩ G ∩ S|, |D ∩ G ∩ C|, |D ∩ S ∩ C|, |G ∩ S ∩ C|), and the quadruple intersection (|D ∩ G ∩ S ∩ C|). Because C includes all residents, intersections involving C with any other set equal the size of the other set (e.g., |D ∩ C| = |D|). However, for completeness and clarity in solving, we keep these variables. We also define variables for the number of residents owning exactly one item, exactly two items, exactly three items, and all four items, as these counts are central to the problem. Assumptions made include: candy hearts is counted among the items owned in exactly two and exactly three ownership counts; all intersections are well-defined subsets of the 900 residents; and the sets are subsets of the universal set of 900 residents. This formal representation and variable definition set the stage for applying inclusion-exclusion principles and further analysis.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent FqZI:\nWe have four sets representing the residents owning each item: D (diamond rings), G (golf clubs), S (garden spades), and C (candy hearts).

Given total residents: x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 = 900. Given exactly two items: x2 = 437; exactly three items: x3 = 234; candy hearts owned by all (|C|=900). Individual set sizes: |D|=195, |G|=367, |S|=562. Since candy hearts is universal, intersections involving C correspond to the other sets. The counts of exactly two and three items include candy hearts as one item. Using inclusion-exclusion and these constraints, the relationships among the sets and variables are established to solve for x4, the number owning all four items. Assumptions: candy hearts is counted among owned items; all sets are subsets of the 900 residents. These constraints form the basis for analyzing ownership patterns and applying inclusion-exclusion principles.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent 30mJ:\nGiven the problem data and previous assumptions, we define the following sets: D (diamond rings), G (golf clubs), S (garden spades), and C (candy hearts), with |C| = 900 (universal ownership). Residents are categorized by the number of items they own: exactly one, exactly two, exactly three, and exactly four. The counts for exactly two and exactly three items include candy hearts as one of the items owned. The total number of residents is 900. The sum of residents owning exactly one, two, three, or four items must equal 900: x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 = 900, where xk is the number of residents owning exactly k items. Given: x2 = 437 and x3 = 234. Thus, x1 + 437 + 234 + x4 = 900, or x1 + x4 = 229. The total number of owners for each item relates to these categories and their intersections. Since candy hearts is owned by all, the counts involving candy hearts simplify some intersections, but since it is counted in the exact ownership counts, the sets and intersections must be considered with candy hearts included. The constraints include: |D| = 195, |G| = 367, |S| = 562, |C| = 900; x2 = 437, x3 = 234; total residents = 900; x1 + x4 = 229. The variables for intersections and exact ownership counts are linked through inclusion-exclusion principles and the definitions of exact ownership numbers. Assumptions include counting candy hearts in the exact ownership counts and that all sets are subsets of the 900 residents. These constraints and relationships form the basis for solving the problem and determining the number of residents owning all four items.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent vmGB:\nFrom the problem, we have four sets: D, G, S, and C, representing residents owning diamond rings, golf clubs, garden spades, and candy hearts respectively. Given that all 900 residents own candy hearts, |C| = 900. The total population is 900, so the universal set U has size 900. The problem gives the number of residents owning exactly two items as 437 and exactly three items as 234, where candy hearts is counted as one of the items. We define variables for the number of residents owning exactly one item (x1), exactly two items (x2 = 437), exactly three items (x3 = 234), and exactly four items (x4, unknown). Since every resident owns candy hearts, every resident owns at least one item (candy hearts), so there are no residents owning zero items. The sum of residents owning exactly one, two, three, or four items must be 900: x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 = 900. The sizes of the sets are |D|=195, |G|=367, |S|=562, and |C|=900. Because candy hearts is universal, intersections involving C correspond to the other sets (e.g., |D ∩ C|=|D|). The counts of exactly two and exactly three items include candy hearts, so residents owning exactly two items could be those owning candy hearts plus one other item, or two of the other items without candy hearts (which is impossible since candy hearts is universal). Thus, the exactly two items group includes residents owning candy hearts plus exactly one of {D, G, S}. Similarly, exactly three items means candy hearts plus exactly two of {D, G, S}. Exactly four items means candy hearts plus all three of {D, G, S}. Using these, the problem can be analyzed with the following constraints and relationships: 1) Total residents: 900; 2) |C|=900; 3) x2=437; 4) x3=234; 5) x1 + 437 + 234 + x4 = 900; 6) |D|=195, |G|=367, |S|=562; 7) Residents owning all four items = x4; 8) Residents owning exactly two items = those owning candy hearts and exactly one of {D,G,S}; 9) Residents owning exactly three items = those owning candy hearts and exactly two of {D,G,S}; 10) Residents owning exactly four items = those owning candy hearts and all three of {D,G,S}. These relationships form the basis for applying inclusion-exclusion and solving for x4.

The counts of exactly two and exactly three items owned include candy hearts as one of the items. Define variables for the number of residents owning exactly one item (x1), exactly two items (x2 = 437), exactly three items (x3 = 234), and exactly four items (x4, unknown).

Given total residents: x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 = 900. Given exactly two items: x2 = 437; exactly three items: x3 = 234; candy hearts owned by all (|C|=900). Individual set sizes: |D|=195, |G|=367, |S|=562. Since candy hearts is universal, intersections involving C correspond to the other sets. The counts of exactly two and three items include candy hearts as one item. Using inclusion-exclusion and these constraints, the relationships among the sets and variables are established to solve for x4, the number owning all four items. Assumptions: candy hearts is counted among owned items; all sets are subsets of the 900 residents. These constraints form the basis for analyzing ownership patterns and applying inclusion-exclusion principles.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent 30mJ:\nGiven the problem data and previous assumptions, we define the following sets: D (diamond rings), G (golf clubs), S (garden spades), and C (candy hearts), with |C| = 900 (universal ownership). Residents are categorized by the number of items they own: exactly one, exactly two, exactly three, and exactly four. The counts for exactly two and exactly three items include candy hearts as one of the items owned. The total number of residents is 900. The sum of residents owning exactly one, two, three, or four items must equal 900: x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 = 900, where xk is the number of residents owning exactly k items. Given: x2 = 437 and x3 = 234. Thus, x1 + 437 + 234 + x4 = 900, or x1 + x4 = 229. The total number of owners for each item relates to these categories and their intersections. Since candy hearts is owned by all, the counts involving candy hearts simplify some intersections, but since it is counted in the exact ownership counts, the sets and intersections must be considered with candy hearts included. The constraints include: |D| = 195, |G| = 367, |S| = 562, |C| = 900; x2 = 437, x3 = 234; total residents = 900; x1 + x4 = 229. The variables for intersections and exact ownership counts are linked through inclusion-exclusion principles and the definitions of exact ownership numbers. Assumptions include counting candy hearts in the exact ownership counts and that all sets are subsets of the 900 residents. These constraints and relationships form the basis for solving the problem and determining the number of residents owning all four items.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent vmGB:\nFrom the problem, we have four sets: D, G, S, and C, representing residents owning diamond rings, golf clubs, garden spades, and candy hearts respectively. Given that all 900 residents own candy hearts, |C| = 900. The total population is 900, so the universal set U has size 900. The problem gives the number of residents owning exactly two items as 437 and exactly three items as 234, where candy hearts is counted as one of the items. We define variables for the number of residents owning exactly one item (x1), exactly two items (x2 = 437), exactly three items (x3 = 234), and exactly four items (x4, unknown). Since every resident owns candy hearts, every resident owns at least one item (candy hearts), so there are no residents owning zero items. The sum of residents owning exactly one, two, three, or four items must be 900: x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 = 900. The sizes of the sets are |D|=195, |G|=367, |S|=562, and |C|=900. Because candy hearts is universal, intersections involving C correspond to the other sets (e.g., |D ∩ C|=|D|). The counts of exactly two and exactly three items include candy hearts, so residents owning exactly two items could be those owning candy hearts plus one other item, or two of the other items without candy hearts (which is impossible since candy hearts is universal). Thus, the exactly two items group includes residents owning candy hearts plus exactly one of {D, G, S}. Similarly, exactly three items means candy hearts plus exactly two of {D, G, S}. Exactly four items means candy hearts plus all three of {D, G, S}. Using these, the problem can be analyzed with the following constraints and relationships: 1) Total residents: 900; 2) |C|=900; 3) x2=437; 4) x3=234; 5) x1 + 437 + 234 + x4 = 900; 6) |D|=195, |G|=367, |S|=562; 7) Residents owning all four items = x4; 8) Residents owning exactly two items = those owning candy hearts and exactly one of {D,G,S}; 9) Residents owning exactly three items = those owning candy hearts and exactly two of {D,G,S}; 10) Residents owning exactly four items = those owning candy hearts and all three of {D,G,S}. These relationships form the basis for applying inclusion-exclusion and solving for x4. Assumptions made include counting candy hearts as one of the items in the \'exactly two\' and \'exactly three\' counts, and that no resident owns zero items since candy hearts is universal.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent QqwQ:\nGiven the problem data and previous assumptions, we have four sets D, G, S, and C, representing residents owning diamond rings, golf clubs, garden spades, and candy hearts respectively, with |C| = 900 (universal ownership).

Using the sizes of D (195), G (367), and S (562), we form equations expressing the number of residents owning each set as sums of the numbers owning exactly one, two, three, and four items that include that set. These algebraic equations, incorporating the universal ownership of candy hearts and the given counts, capture the constraints needed to analyze the ownership patterns and solve for x4.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent MeTS:\nWe define variables x1, x2, x3, and x4 to represent the number of residents owning exactly one, two, three, and four items respectively, where the items are diamond ring (D), golf clubs (G), garden spade (S), and candy hearts (C). Given that candy hearts is owned by all residents, no one owns zero items, so the sum x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 equals the total population of 900. We know x2 = 437 and x3 = 234 from the problem statement. Therefore, x1 + x4 = 900 - (437 + 234) = 229. \n\nWe interpret owning exactly one item as owning only candy hearts (since everyone owns candy hearts, owning only candy hearts means no other items).

Residents owning exactly four items own candy hearts plus all three of {D, G, S}. Using the sizes of the sets D (195), G (367), and S (562), and the universal ownership of candy hearts, we can express the total counts of owners of each item as sums of the variables. For example, the total number owning D is the sum of those owning exactly one item D (with candy hearts), those owning exactly two items including D, those owning exactly three items including D, and those owning all four items.

The sizes of sets D, G, S relate to these variables by summing over the residents owning those items. These form the algebraic constraints incorporating universal ownership of candy hearts.\n\n### answer by Chain-of-Thought Agent vqMt:\nLet x1, x2, x3, and x4 be the number of residents owning exactly one, two, three, and four items respectively. Since every resident owns candy hearts, no one owns zero items, so x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 = 900. Given x2 = 437 and x3 = 234, then x1 + x4 = 229. The residents owning exactly two items own candy hearts plus exactly one of {D, G, S}, those owning exactly three items own candy hearts plus exactly two of {D, G, S}, and those owning exactly four items own candy hearts plus all three of {D, G, S}. Using the sizes of D (195), G (367), and S (562), we form equations expressing the number of residents owning each set as sums of the numbers owning exactly one, two, three, and four items that include that set. These algebraic equations, incorporating the universal ownership of candy hearts and the given counts, capture the constraints needed to analyze the ownership patterns and solve for x4.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent MeTS:\nWe define variables x1, x2, x3, and x4 to represent the number of residents owning exactly one, two, three, and four items respectively, where the items are diamond ring (D), golf clubs (G), garden spade (S), and candy hearts (C). Given that candy hearts is owned by all residents, no one owns zero items, so the sum x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 equals the total population of 900. We know x2 = 437 and x3 = 234 from the problem statement. Therefore, x1 + x4 = 900 - (437 + 234) = 229. \n\nWe interpret owning exactly one item as owning only candy hearts (since everyone owns candy hearts, owning only candy hearts means no other items). Owning exactly two items means owning candy hearts plus exactly one of {D, G, S}. Owning exactly three items means owning candy hearts plus exactly two of {D, G, S}. Owning exactly four items means owning candy hearts plus all three of {D, G, S}.\n\nThe total counts of items owned (|D|=195, |G|=367, |S|=562) relate to these variables as follows: each resident owning exactly two items contributes one to the count of the respective item they own besides candy hearts, each owning exactly three items contributes two, and each owning exactly four items contributes three. Residents owning exactly one item (only candy hearts) contribute zero to D, G, S counts.\n\nThus, the sum of owners of D, G, and S is:\n|D| + |G| + |S| = x2 * 1 + x3 * 2 + x4 * 3\n\nPlugging in known values:\n195 + 367 + 562 = 437 * 1 + 234 * 2 + 3 * x4\n\nWhich simplifies to an equation that can be solved for x4. The key algebraic equations are:\n1) x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 = 900\n2) x2 = 437\n3) x3 = 234\n4) 195 + 367 + 562 = 437 + 468 + 3 * x4\n\nThese represent the constraints incorporating the universal ownership of candy hearts and the exact counts of ownership for the other items.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent Pnes:\nWe define variables x1, x2, x3, and x4 as the number of residents owning exactly one, two, three, and four items respectively. Since every resident owns candy hearts (C), no resident owns zero items, so the sum of these variables equals the total population: x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 = 900. Given x2 = 437 and x3 = 234, we have x1 + x4 = 229. The residents owning exactly one item either own candy hearts alone or candy hearts plus none of the other three items, but since everyone owns candy hearts, owning only candy hearts counts as owning exactly one item. Residents owning exactly two items own candy hearts plus exactly one of {D, G, S}. Residents owning exactly three items own candy hearts plus exactly two of {D, G, S}. Residents owning exactly four items own candy hearts plus all three of {D, G, S}. Using the sizes of the sets D (195), G (367), and S (562), and the universal ownership of candy hearts, we can express the total counts of owners of each item as sums of the variables. For example, the total number owning D is the sum of those owning exactly one item D (with candy hearts), those owning exactly two items including D, those owning exactly three items including D, and those owning all four items. Similar expressions hold for G and S. Hence, the constraints translate into the following algebraic equations: x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 = 900; x2 = 437; x3 = 234; x1 + x4 = 229; and equations expressing |D|, |G|, and |S| in terms of x1, x2, x3, x4, partitioned by which items are owned exactly. The assumption made is that candy hearts is counted as one of the items owned in the exact counts and that no resident owns zero items due to universal candy hearts ownership.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent vqMt:\nLet x1, x2, x3, and x4 be the number of residents who own exactly one, two, three, and four items respectively. Since every resident owns candy hearts (C), no resident owns zero items, so the total number of residents is x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 = 900. Given x2 = 437 and x3 = 234, it follows that x1 + x4 = 900 - 437 - 234 = 229. The sets D, G, and S represent diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades, respectively. Because candy hearts is universal, owning exactly two items means owning candy hearts plus exactly one of {D, G, S}, owning exactly three items means candy hearts plus exactly two of {D, G, S}, and owning exactly four items means candy hearts plus all three of {D, G, S}. The total ownership counts for D, G, and S give the following relationships: the total number of residents owning D is the sum of those owning exactly one item (D only, plus candy hearts), plus those owning exactly two items that include D, plus those owning exactly three items that include D, plus those owning all four items. Similar equations hold for G and S. These constraints can be translated into algebraic equations: x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 = 900, x2 = 437, x3 = 234, x1 + x4 = 229, and equations expressing the sums of residents owning each set D, G, and S in terms of x1, x2, x3, and x4, considering the subsets of exactly one, two, three, and four items including candy hearts.

Since every resident owns candy hearts (C), owning exactly one item means owning only candy hearts. Owning exactly two items means owning candy hearts plus exactly one of {D, G, S}. Owning exactly three items means candy hearts plus exactly two of {D, G, S}. Owning exactly four items means candy hearts plus all three of {D, G, S}. Given: total residents = 900, x2 = 437, x3 = 234, and x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 = 900, so x1 + x4 = 229. The total owners of D, G, and S are 195, 367, and 562 respectively, summing to 1124. Each resident owning exactly two items contributes 1 to the count of the respective item they own besides candy hearts; each owning exactly three items contributes 2; each owning exactly four items contributes 3; those owning exactly one item (only candy hearts) contribute 0 to D, G, S counts. Therefore, the sum of owners of D, G, and S is: 1124 = 437*1 + 234*2 + 3*x4 = 437 + 468 + 3*x4. This gives the equation 1124 = 905 + 3*x4, or 3*x4 = 219.
