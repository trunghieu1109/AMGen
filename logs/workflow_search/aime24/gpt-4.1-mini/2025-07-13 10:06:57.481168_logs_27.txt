============== high level task decomposition ================
[{'objective': 'Formulate the divisibility conditions for N based on changing each digit to 1 and requiring divisibility by 7'}, {'objective': 'Determine the greatest four-digit integer N that satisfies all the divisibility conditions simultaneously'}, {'objective': 'Divide N by 1000 to find the quotient Q and remainder R'}, {'objective': 'Calculate and return the sum Q + R'}]
============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- N is a four-digit positive integer (i.e., 1000 ≤ N ≤ 9999).
- The key property: For any digit of N, if that digit is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7.
- Q and R are defined by the division N ÷ 1000, where Q is the quotient and R is the remainder.
- The task is to find Q + R.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- Changing any digit of N to 1 produces a number divisible by 7. This implies a set of divisibility conditions for each digit position.
- Since N has four digits, there are four such modified numbers, each differing from N in exactly one digit replaced by 1.
- The divisibility by 7 condition imposes modular arithmetic constraints on N and its digits.
- The problem asks for the greatest such N, so an optimization or search over possible N values is implied.
- Q and R come from dividing N by 1000, so Q is the thousands digit and R is the last three digits of N.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- Number theory (divisibility, modular arithmetic).
- Elementary algebra (digit manipulation, place value).
- Possibly combinatorics or systematic search methods.
- Such problems are common in mathematical competitions and recreational mathematics.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The problem does not explicitly state whether digits can be changed to 1 if they are already 1; presumably, the operation applies to each digit regardless.
- It is not stated whether leading zeros are allowed after digit replacement; likely not, since the resulting number must be a valid four-digit number.
- The exact method to find N is not requested, only the analysis.
- Potential complexity arises from multiple divisibility conditions and the search for the greatest N.
- Reasonable assumptions include that the replaced digit is changed independently for each digit position, and the resulting number remains four-digit.
