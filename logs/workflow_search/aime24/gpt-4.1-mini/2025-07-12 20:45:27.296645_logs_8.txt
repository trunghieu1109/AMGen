[{'objective': 'Define and characterize winning and losing positions in the token removal game based on allowed moves.'}, {'objective': 'Develop a method or recurrence to classify each position n up to 2024 as winning or losing for the player to move.'}, {'objective': 'Identify all positions where the first player (Alice) is in a losing position, implying Bob has a winning strategy.'}, {'objective': "Count and return the number of such positions n (≤ 2024) where Bob can guarantee a win regardless of Alice's moves."}]
============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- There is a stack of n tokens, where n is a positive integer with 1 ≤ n ≤ 2024.
- Two players, Alice and Bob, alternate turns; Alice moves first.
- On each turn, a player removes either 1 or 4 tokens from the stack.
- The player who removes the last token wins.
- The task is to find how many values of n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2024) allow Bob to have a winning strategy regardless of Alice's moves.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The game is sequential and turn-based with perfect information.
- The moves allowed (removing 1 or 4 tokens) define the possible transitions between game states.
- The concept of winning and losing positions applies: a position is winning if the current player can force a win, losing otherwise.
- Since Alice moves first, Bob can guarantee a win if the initial position is losing for Alice.
- The problem reduces to identifying losing positions for the first player under the given move set.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- This problem belongs to combinatorial game theory, a branch of discrete mathematics.
- It involves concepts like impartial games, winning/losing positions, and the Sprague-Grundy theorem.
- Such problems are common in mathematical competitions and theoretical computer science.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The problem is clear in its rules and objectives; no ambiguous terms are present.
- Potential challenges include efficiently characterizing losing positions up to n=2024.
- Assumptions: standard game theory definitions apply; no additional constraints or variations exist.
- It is assumed that both players play optimally.
