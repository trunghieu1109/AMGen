============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- N is a four-digit positive integer, so 1000 ≤ N ≤ 9999.
- N has the property that if any one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7.
- Q and R are defined by the division N ÷ 1000, where Q is the quotient (the thousands digit) and R is the remainder (the last three digits).
- The problem asks for Q + R.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- Changing any single digit of N to 1 produces a number divisible by 7. This implies that for each digit position i (thousands, hundreds, tens, units), replacing that digit with 1 yields a multiple of 7.
- Since N is four-digit, the thousands digit Q is between 1 and 9.
- The remainder R is between 0 and 999.
- The divisibility conditions impose modular arithmetic constraints on the digits of N.
- The problem seeks the greatest such N, indicating an optimization or maximality condition under these constraints.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- Number theory, specifically divisibility and modular arithmetic.
- Elementary algebra related to digit manipulation and base-10 representation.
- Potentially combinatorics or logic to handle digit substitutions.
- Such problems commonly appear in mathematical competitions or recreational mathematics.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The exact method of digit replacement: it is assumed only one digit is changed at a time to 1, not multiple digits simultaneously.
- Whether leading digit replacement to 1 is allowed (which would produce a three-digit number if the thousands digit is replaced by 1, but since the problem states four-digit integer N, the resulting number after replacement might be three-digit; the problem does not specify if the resulting number must remain four-digit).
- Potential complexity in checking all digit positions and ensuring divisibility by 7 for each modified number.
- Multiple candidate numbers might satisfy the condition; the problem asks for the greatest such number, implying a search or ordering.
- The problem does not specify if digits can be originally 1, which might affect the replacement operation.
