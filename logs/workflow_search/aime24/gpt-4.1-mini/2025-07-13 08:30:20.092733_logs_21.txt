============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- The figure is a fixed regular dodecagon (12-sided polygon with equal sides and angles).
- Rectangles are to be formed inside this polygon.
- Each side of the rectangle must lie on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon.
- A diagram (not shown here) illustrates three such rectangles.
- The task is to find the total number of such rectangles.

Properties:
- The dodecagon is regular, so vertices are equally spaced on a circle.
- Sides and diagonals correspond to chords connecting vertices.
- Rectangles have four right angles and opposite sides equal and parallel.

Objective:
- Compute the number of rectangles inside the dodecagon with sides on polygon sides or diagonals.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- Rectangles must be inscribed such that their edges coincide with polygon sides or diagonals.
- Since the polygon is regular, its symmetry and chord structure determine possible rectangle edges.
- The condition that rectangle sides lie on polygon sides or diagonals restricts possible rectangles to those whose edges align with chords between vertices.
- The problem likely involves combinatorial geometry: selecting sets of vertices or chords that form rectangles.
- Constraints such as right angles and parallelism must be satisfied by chosen chords.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- Primary domain: Geometry, specifically Euclidean and combinatorial geometry.
- Subfields: Polygon geometry, chord properties in regular polygons, combinatorics.
- Applications: Problems of this type appear in mathematical competitions, discrete geometry, and computational geometry.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The exact definition of "side or diagonal"â€”does it include all diagonals or only certain ones?
- Whether rectangles must be strictly inside the polygon or can coincide with polygon edges.
- Whether rectangles can be degenerate or must have positive area.
- The problem assumes the polygon is fixed and regular, but the orientation or labeling of vertices might affect counting.
- Potential complexity arises from the large number of diagonals and possible chord combinations.

Reasonable assumptions:
- All diagonals connecting any two vertices are considered.
- Rectangles are non-degenerate with positive area.
- Rectangles are counted up to distinct sets of vertices or edges.
- The polygon is convex and regular, so standard properties of chords and angles apply.
