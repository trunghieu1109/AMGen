[{'objective': 'Rewrite the given polynomial equation in terms of symmetric sums or simpler polynomial expressions involving a, b, and c.'}, {'objective': 'Use the constraint a + b + c = 300 to express one variable in terms of the other two, reducing the problem to two variables.'}, {'objective': 'Substitute the expression from the sum constraint into the polynomial equation to obtain an equation in two variables.'}, {'objective': 'Identify all nonnegative integer pairs (a,b) that satisfy the reduced polynomial equation and the bounds implied by the sum constraint.'}, {'objective': 'Count the total number of triples (a,b,c) that satisfy both the sum and polynomial constraints.'}]
