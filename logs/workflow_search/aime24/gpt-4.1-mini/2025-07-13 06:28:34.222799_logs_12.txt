============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- Given a complex number z with magnitude |z| = 4.
- Expression to analyze: (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z.
- Objective: Find the largest possible real part of this expression.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- z lies on the circle of radius 4 in the complex plane, so z = 4e^{iθ} for some real θ.
- The expression involves a linear term in z and a reciprocal term in z, both scaled by complex constants.
- The real part depends on the argument θ of z, and the problem reduces to optimizing over θ.
- The constraint |z|=4 ensures the magnitude is fixed, simplifying the problem to a single-variable optimization over the angle.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- Complex analysis and trigonometric optimization.
- Subfields: Complex numbers, polar form representation, and real part extraction.
- Applications: Problems of this type appear in mathematical competitions and complex function optimization.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The problem is well-defined with no ambiguous terms.
- Potential challenge: expressing the real part in terms of θ and maximizing it.
- Assumption: z can be represented as 4e^{iθ} with θ in [0, 2π), which is standard for fixed magnitude complex numbers.

The goal is to rewrite this in the form R cos(θ - φ). Recall the identity: A cos(θ) + B sin(θ) = R cos(θ - φ), where R = sqrt(A^2 + B^2) and φ satisfies cos(φ) = A/R and sin(φ) = B/R. Here, A = 324 and B = -432. First, compute R: R = sqrt(324^2 + (-432)^2) = sqrt(104976 + 186624) = sqrt(291600) = 540. Next, find φ: cos(φ) = A/R = 324/540 = 3/5 = 0.6, sin(φ) = B/R = -432/540 = -4/5 = -0.8. Since sin(φ) is negative and cos(φ) positive, φ lies in the fourth quadrant. The angle φ = arccos(0.6) which is approximately 53.13 degrees or 0.9273 radians. Because sin(φ) is negative, φ = +0.9273 radians is consistent with the fourth quadrant. Thus, the expression can be written as 540 cos(θ - 0.9273). This transformation simplifies the trigonometric expression to a single cosine function with amplitude 540 and phase shift approximately 0.9273 radians.

We want to rewrite it as a single cosine function with a phase shift: R cos(θ - φ). The general formula for rewriting A cos(θ) + B sin(θ) as R cos(θ - φ) is: R = sqrt(A^2 + B^2), and φ = arctan(B/A). Note the sign of φ depends on the sign of B and A. Here, A = 324 and B = -432. Step 1: Calculate R = sqrt(324^2 + (-432)^2) = sqrt(104976 + 186624) = sqrt(291600) = 540. Step 2: Calculate φ = arctan(B/A) = arctan(-432/324) = arctan(-4/3). Since A > 0 and B < 0, φ is negative. The angle whose tangent is -4/3 is approximately -0.9273 radians (or -53.13 degrees). Therefore, the expression can be written as 540 cos(θ - (-0.9273)) = 540 cos(θ + 0.9273). But the problem asks for the form R cos(θ - φ), so φ = -(-0.9273) = 0.9273 radians. Hence, the expression is 540 cos(θ - (-0.9273)) = 540 cos(θ + 0.9273). Alternatively, we can write it as 540 cos(θ - (-0.9273)). Therefore, R = 540 and φ = -arctan(4/3) ≈ -0.9273 radians. To express φ as a positive angle between 0 and 2π, we can add 2π if needed, but the negative angle is acceptable. This transformation simplifies the trigonometric expression into a single cosine function with amplitude 540 and phase shift approximately -0.9273 radians.

Next, find φ: cos(φ) = A/R = 324/540 = 3/5 = 0.6, sin(φ) = B/R = -432/540 = -4/5 = -0.8. Since sin(φ) is negative and cos(φ) positive, φ lies in the fourth quadrant. The angle φ = arccos(0.6) which is approximately 53.13 degrees or 0.9273 radians. Because sin(φ) is negative, φ = +0.9273 radians is consistent with the fourth quadrant. Thus, the expression can be written as 540 cos(θ - 0.9273). This transformation simplifies the trigonometric expression to a single cosine function with amplitude 540 and phase shift approximately 0.9273 radians. This form is useful for further optimization or analysis.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent BD7C:\nWe are given the trigonometric expression 324 cos(θ) - 432 sin(θ).

We want to rewrite it as a single cosine function with a phase shift: R cos(θ - φ). The general formula for rewriting A cos(θ) + B sin(θ) as R cos(θ - φ) is: R = sqrt(A^2 + B^2), and φ = arctan(B/A). Note the sign of φ depends on the sign of B and A. Here, A = 324 and B = -432. Step 1: Calculate R = sqrt(324^2 + (-432)^2) = sqrt(104976 + 186624) = sqrt(291600) = 540. Step 2: Calculate φ = arctan(B/A) = arctan(-432/324) = arctan(-4/3). Since A > 0 and B < 0, φ is negative. The angle whose tangent is -4/3 is approximately -0.9273 radians (or -53.13 degrees). Therefore, the expression can be written as 540 cos(θ - (-0.9273)) = 540 cos(θ + 0.9273). But the problem asks for the form R cos(θ - φ), so φ = -(-0.9273) = 0.9273 radians. Hence, the expression is 540 cos(θ - (-0.9273)) = 540 cos(θ + 0.9273). Alternatively, we can write it as 540 cos(θ - (-0.9273)). Therefore, R = 540 and φ = -arctan(4/3) ≈ -0.9273 radians. To express φ as a positive angle between 0 and 2π, we can add 2π if needed, but the negative angle is acceptable. This transformation simplifies the trigonometric expression into a single cosine function with amplitude 540 and phase shift approximately -0.9273 radians. This is the standard approach to combine linear combinations of sine and cosine into a single shifted cosine function.\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 2: Synthesize and choose the most consistent answer for transforming trig expression to single cosine. \n\n then justify completely and detailedly, step-by-step why you think so in the "thinking" entry. \n                If stuck in loop, stop this reasoning.\n                Again, your task is only to answer the question Sub-task 2: Synthesize and choose the most consistent answer for transforming trig expression to single cosine. and explaination your thinking.\n                Follow the instruction step-by-step.

Using insights from previous attempts, try to solve the task better..   \n\nRelated sub-task questions and answers:\n\n### Sub-task 1: Determine the maximum value of the real part function expressed as R cos(θ - φ) + constant by identifying the maximum of the cosine term and adding the constant term. Provide the largest possible real part value. \n\n ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent 4AAG:\nThe expression given is of the form R cos(θ - φ) + constant, where R = 540 and φ ≈ 0.9273 radians. The cosine function cos(θ - φ) achieves its maximum value of 1 when θ = φ. Therefore, the maximum value of the real part function is R * 1 + constant = 540 + 0 = 540. Since the constant term is zero in this case, the largest possible real part is simply the amplitude R of the cosine term. This is a standard result in trigonometric optimization: the maximum of A cos x + B sin x is sqrt(A^2 + B^2), and when rewritten as R cos(θ - φ), the maximum is R. Hence, the largest possible real part value is 540.\n\n### Sub-task 1: Formally represent the complex number z with the constraint |z|=4 using polar form z = 4e^{iθ}, where θ ∈ [0, 2π). Emphasize that θ is the only variable parameter and that the magnitude constraint fixes the radius. \n\n ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent a6o2:\nGiven the constraint |z| = 4, the complex number z lies on the circle centered at the origin with radius 4 in the complex plane. Any complex number can be represented in polar form as z = r * e^(iθ), where r is the magnitude (or modulus) of z and θ is the argument (or angle) of z. Since the magnitude is fixed at 4, r = 4 is constant. Therefore, the only variable parameter is θ, which represents the angle that z makes with the positive real axis. The angle θ can vary from 0 to 2π to cover the entire circle. Hence, the formal representation of z under the given constraint is z = 4e^(iθ), where θ ∈ [0, 2π). This representation simplifies the problem by reducing the two-dimensional complex number z to a single variable θ, making it easier to analyze and optimize expressions involving z.\n\nGiven the above, answer the following question: Sub-task 2: Your problem is to verify the solution by checking the value of θ that achieves the maximum real part and confirm that it satisfies the original constraint |z|=4.

[{'combined_feedback': "• The algebraic manipulations and trigonometric rewriting of the expression were correctly performed, including the polar representation of z and the transformation of the real part into a single cosine form.\n• However, the key failure lies in the reasoning and workflow: the maximum real part was assumed to be the amplitude (540) of the cosine term without rigorously verifying if this maximum is achievable given the full expression and the constraint |z|=4.\n• The reciprocal term (96+144i)/z introduces a factor of 1/|z|=1/4, which affects the expression's structure and cannot be ignored; treating the problem as a simple trigonometric optimization oversimplifies the problem.\n• The verification step only confirmed the angle θ that maximizes the cosine term and the magnitude constraint on z, but did not validate the actual maximum real part value or check if it is consistent with the original expression.\n• Context passing between subtasks was incomplete, causing the verification subtask to lack the numeric maximum value and thus failing to confirm or expose it properly.\n• The final answer was misrouted: the system output θ instead of the numeric maximum real part, violating the user’s request to return only an integer.\n• Agent collaboration patterns (Chain-of-Thought, Reflexion) were effective in breaking down the problem but lacked a dedicated rigorous verification subtask to challenge the assumption about the maximum value.\n• Overall, the problem stems from a reasoning flaw (oversimplification and insufficient verification) and workflow misalignment (missing context passing and final output selection), not from algebraic errors or agent collaboration structure.", 'combined_suggestion': '• Introduce a new, dedicated subtask immediately after the trigonometric rewriting step to rigorously analyze and verify the maximum real part of the expression, explicitly considering the reciprocal term and the full complex structure. This subtask should:\n  - Reformulate the expression to incorporate both terms properly, for example as a sum involving z and its conjugate or by other complex analysis methods.\n  - Apply mathematical tools such as the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or bounding techniques to find the true maximum real part.\n  - Check whether the previously found amplitude (540) is attainable or if constraints reduce it.\n\n• Enhance the verification subtask to validate not only the maximizing angle θ and the magnitude constraint |z|=4 but also the correctness and achievability of the maximum real part by substituting back into the original expression or using bounding arguments.\n\n• Modify instructions for all relevant subtasks to explicitly require justification that the maximum value is consistent with the original problem constraints and expression structure, preventing oversimplification.\n\n• Improve context passing by including the numeric maximum value and relevant intermediate results in the inputs of verification and final answer subtasks, ensuring the chain of intent is preserved.\n\n• Adjust the final answer generation step to output the numeric maximum real part (an integer) as requested, rather than the angle θ or other intermediate values.\n\n• Optionally, consolidate the final subtasks by first outputting the numeric maximum immediately after computation, then performing verification, reducing the risk of losing key results.\n\n• In code, add logging and validation checks to cross-verify the final maximum value against the original expression, ensuring consistency and correctness.\n\nBy implementing these changes, the workflow will avoid oversimplification, rigorously verify the solution, maintain proper context flow, and produce a mathematically sound and user-aligned final answer.'}]

Ensure all coefficients are correctly computed, explicitly reflecting the contribution of both z and 1/z terms. \n\n ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent 2JF0:\nWe start with the given expression: (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where |z| = 4. We want to rewrite the real part of this expression in terms of cos(θ) and sin(θ), where z = 4e^{iθ} = 4(cosθ + i sinθ). First, calculate (75 + 117i)z: multiply out to get the real and imaginary parts. (75 + 117i)(4 cosθ + 4 i sinθ) = 75 * 4 cosθ + 75 * 4 i sinθ + 117i * 4 cosθ + 117i * 4 i sinθ. Simplify each term: 300 cosθ + 300 i sinθ + 468 i cosθ + 468 i^2 sinθ. Since i^2 = -1, 468 i^2 sinθ = -468 sinθ. Group the real and imaginary parts: real part is 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ; imaginary part is 300 sinθ + 468 cosθ. Next, calculate (96 + 144i)/z = (96 + 144i)/(4 e^{iθ}) = (96 + 144i)/(4 (cosθ + i sinθ)) = (96 + 144i)/(4 (cosθ + i sinθ)). Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of denominator: (96 + 144i)(cosθ - i sinθ) / (4 (cos^2θ + sin^2θ)) = (96 + 144i)(cosθ - i sinθ)/4. Compute numerator: 96 cosθ - 96 i sinθ + 144 i cosθ - 144 i^2 sinθ = 96 cosθ - 96 i sinθ + 144 i cosθ + 144 sinθ (since i^2 = -1). Group real and imaginary parts: real part = 96 cosθ + 144 sinθ; imaginary part = -96 sinθ + 144 cosθ. Divide both by 4: real part = 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ; imaginary part = -24 sinθ + 36 cosθ. Now, add the real parts from both terms: (300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ) = (300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. Similarly, the imaginary parts add to: (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ) + (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ) = (300 - 24) sinθ + (468 + 36) cosθ = 276 sinθ + 504 cosθ. Therefore, the real part of the original expression is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. This rewriting explicitly shows the contribution of both z and 1/z terms, combining like terms and constants, and expresses the real part as a trigonometric function in terms of cos(θ) and sin(θ).\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent uxk9:\nWe start with the given expression: (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where |z| = 4. We represent z in polar form as z = 4e^{iθ} = 4(cosθ + i sinθ). Its reciprocal is 1/z = 1/(4e^{iθ}) = (1/4)e^{-iθ} = (1/4)(cosθ - i sinθ). \n\nFirst, compute (75 + 117i)z:\n= (75 + 117i) * 4(cosθ + i sinθ)\n= 4[(75)(cosθ + i sinθ) + 117i(cosθ + i sinθ)]\n= 4[75 cosθ + 75 i sinθ + 117 i cosθ + 117 i^2 sinθ]\nSince i^2 = -1,\n= 4[75 cosθ + 75 i sinθ + 117 i cosθ - 117 sinθ]\nGroup real and imaginary parts:\nReal: 75 cosθ - 117 sinθ\nImaginary: 75 sinθ + 117 cosθ\nMultiply by 4:\nReal: 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ\nImaginary: 300 sinθ + 468 cosθ\n\nNext, compute (96 + 144i)/z = (96 + 144i) * (1/4)(cosθ - i sinθ) = (1/4)(96 + 144i)(cosθ - i sinθ)\nMultiply:\n= (1/4)[96 cosθ - 96 i sinθ + 144 i cosθ - 144 i^2 sinθ]\nAgain, i^2 = -1:\n= (1/4)[96 cosθ - 96 i sinθ + 144 i cosθ + 144 sinθ]\nGroup real and imaginary parts:\nReal: 96 cosθ + 144 sinθ\nImaginary: -96 sinθ + 144 cosθ\nMultiply by 1/4:\nReal: 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ\nImaginary: -24 sinθ + 36 cosθ\n\nNow, sum the real parts:\n(300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ) = (300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ\n\nSum the imaginary parts:\n(300 sinθ + 468 cosθ) + (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ) = (300 - 24) sinθ + (468 + 36) cosθ = 276 sinθ + 504 cosθ\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to:\nReal part: 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ\nImaginary part: 276 sinθ + 504 cosθ\n\nThis matches the previously identified form and correctly reflects the contributions from both z and 1/z terms with all coefficients computed explicitly.

We write z in polar form as z = 4(cosθ + i sinθ). Then 1/z = 1/(4(cosθ + i sinθ)) = (1/4)(cosθ - i sinθ) because the conjugate over the magnitude squared is the reciprocal for complex numbers. Next, we compute each term separately:\n\n(75 + 117i)z = (75 + 117i) * 4(cosθ + i sinθ) = 4[(75 cosθ - 117 sinθ) + i(75 sinθ + 117 cosθ)] = 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ + i(300 sinθ + 468 cosθ).\n\n(96 + 144i)/z = (96 + 144i) * (1/4)(cosθ - i sinθ) = (1/4)[(96 cosθ + 144 sinθ) + i(144 cosθ - 96 sinθ)] = 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ + i(36 cosθ - 24 sinθ).\n\nAdding the real parts: (300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ) = (300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.\n\nAdding the imaginary parts: (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ) + (36 cosθ - 24 sinθ) = (468 + 36) cosθ + (300 - 24) sinθ = 504 cosθ + 276 sinθ.\n\nThus, the expression simplifies to (324 cosθ - 432 sinθ) + i(504 cosθ + 276 sinθ).\n\nThe real part, explicitly combining all terms and coefficients, is therefore 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Ensure all coefficients are correctly computed, explicitly reflecting the contribution of both z and 1/z terms. \n\n ### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent 2JF0:\nWe start with the given expression: (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where |z| = 4. We want to rewrite the real part of this expression in terms of cos(θ) and sin(θ), where z = 4e^{iθ} = 4(cosθ + i sinθ). First, calculate (75 + 117i)z: multiply out to get the real and imaginary parts. (75 + 117i)(4 cosθ + 4 i sinθ) = 75 * 4 cosθ + 75 * 4 i sinθ + 117i * 4 cosθ + 117i * 4 i sinθ. Simplify each term: 300 cosθ + 300 i sinθ + 468 i cosθ + 468 i^2 sinθ. Since i^2 = -1, 468 i^2 sinθ = -468 sinθ. Group the real and imaginary parts: real part is 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ; imaginary part is 300 sinθ + 468 cosθ. Next, calculate (96 + 144i)/z = (96 + 144i)/(4 e^{iθ}) = (96 + 144i)/(4 (cosθ + i sinθ)) = (96 + 144i)/(4 (cosθ + i sinθ)). Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of denominator: (96 + 144i)(cosθ - i sinθ) / (4 (cos^2θ + sin^2θ)) = (96 + 144i)(cosθ - i sinθ)/4. Compute numerator: 96 cosθ - 96 i sinθ + 144 i cosθ - 144 i^2 sinθ = 96 cosθ - 96 i sinθ + 144 i cosθ + 144 sinθ (since i^2 = -1). Group real and imaginary parts: real part = 96 cosθ + 144 sinθ; imaginary part = -96 sinθ + 144 cosθ. Divide both by 4: real part = 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ; imaginary part = -24 sinθ + 36 cosθ. Now, add the real parts from both terms: (300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ) = (300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. Similarly, the imaginary parts add to: (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ) + (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ) = (300 - 24) sinθ + (468 + 36) cosθ = 276 sinθ + 504 cosθ. Therefore, the real part of the original expression is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. This rewriting explicitly shows the contribution of both z and 1/z terms, combining like terms and constants, and expresses the real part as a trigonometric function in terms of cos(θ) and sin(θ).\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent uxk9:\nWe start with the given expression: (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where |z| = 4. We represent z in polar form as z = 4e^{iθ} = 4(cosθ + i sinθ).

The real part is now expressed as a linear combination of cosθ and sinθ with combined coefficients, suitable for further analysis or optimization.\n\n### thinking by Chain-of-Thought Agent Lha9:\nWe start with the given expression: (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where |z| = 4. We write z in polar form as z = 4(cosθ + i sinθ). Then 1/z = 1/(4(cosθ + i sinθ)) = (1/4)(cosθ - i sinθ) because the conjugate over the magnitude squared is the reciprocal for complex numbers. Next, we compute each term separately:\n\n(75 + 117i)z = (75 + 117i) * 4(cosθ + i sinθ) = 4[(75 cosθ - 117 sinθ) + i(75 sinθ + 117 cosθ)] = 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ + i(300 sinθ + 468 cosθ).\n\n(96 + 144i)/z = (96 + 144i) * (1/4)(cosθ - i sinθ) = (1/4)[(96 cosθ + 144 sinθ) + i(144 cosθ - 96 sinθ)] = 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ + i(36 cosθ - 24 sinθ).\n\nAdding the real parts: (300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ) = (300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.\n\nAdding the imaginary parts: (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ) + (36 cosθ - 24 sinθ) = (468 + 36) cosθ + (300 - 24) sinθ = 504 cosθ + 276 sinθ.\n\nThus, the expression simplifies to (324 cosθ - 432 sinθ) + i(504 cosθ + 276 sinθ).\n\nThe real part, explicitly combining all terms and coefficients, is therefore 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

The expression is symmetric and the maximum real part is exactly 540.\n\nStep 10: Use Cauchy-Schwarz inequality as a bounding technique:\n\nRewrite F(z) as:\n\nF(z) = (75 + 117i) z + (96 + 144i)/z\n\nLet’s consider vectors:\n\nU = (75 + 117i) z\nV = (96 + 144i)/z\n\nThen,\n\n|Re(F)| ≤ |U| + |V| = |75 + 117i| * |z| + |96 + 144i| / |z|\n\nCalculate magnitudes:\n\n|75 + 117i| = sqrt(75^2 + 117^2) = sqrt(5625 + 13689) = sqrt(19314) ≈ 138.97\n\n|96 + 144i| = sqrt(96^2 + 144^2) = sqrt(9216 + 20736) = sqrt(29952) ≈ 173.05\n\nThen,\n\n|Re(F)| ≤ 138.97 * 4 + 173.05 / 4 = 555.88 + 43.26 = 599.14\n\nThis is an upper bound, but our earlier exact analysis shows maximum real part is 540, which is less than this bound.\n\nThis confirms that 540 is attainable and consistent.\n\nConclusion: The largest possible real part of the expression is 540.\n\nThis is consistent with the previous findings and is attained at θ = φ where cos φ = 3/5, sin φ = -4/5.\n\nThus, the maximum real part is 540.\n\n### thinking #1 by Debate Agent seZY:\nWe are given the expression: (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where |z| = 4.

We substitute z = 4e^{iθ} with these values into the original expression F(z) = (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z. Since |z|=4, the magnitude constraint is satisfied by construction. Substituting, we calculate the real part of F(z) explicitly: \n\nFirst, compute (75 + 117i)z = (75 + 117i) * 4 * (3/5 - 4i/5) = 4 * (75 + 117i) * (0.6 - 0.8i).\n\nMultiplying out:\n(75)(0.6) = 45, (75)(-0.8i) = -60i,\n(117i)(0.6) = 70.2i, (117i)(-0.8i) = -93.6 (since i*i = -1).\n\nSum real parts: 45 - 93.6 = -48.6\nSum imaginary parts: -60i + 70.2i = 10.2i\n\nMultiply by 4: real = -48.6 * 4 = -194.4, imaginary = 10.2 * 4 = 40.8i\n\nSecond, compute (96 + 144i)/z = (96 + 144i) * (1/4) * (3/5 + 4i/5) = 0.25 * (96 + 144i) * (0.6 + 0.8i).\n\nMultiplying out:\n(96)(0.6) = 57.6, (96)(0.8i) = 76.8i,\n(144i)(0.6) = 86.4i, (144i)(0.8i) = -115.2\n\nSum real parts: 57.6 - 115.2 = -57.6\nSum imaginary parts: 76.8i + 86.4i = 163.2i\n\nMultiply by 0.25: real = -57.6 * 0.25 = -14.4, imaginary = 163.2 * 0.25 = 40.8i\n\nNow sum both parts:\nReal: -194.4 + (-14.4) = -208.8\nImaginary: 40.8i + 40.8i = 81.6i\n\nThis result contradicts the earlier maximum real part of 540, indicating a miscalculation in the above step. The error arises from the sign of sinθ; the maximum was found for sinθ = -4/5, but in the reciprocal term, the exponent is negative, so the angle is -θ, which flips the sign of sinθ. Correcting this:\n\nFor the reciprocal term, e^{-iθ} = cosθ - i sinθ = 3/5 + 4i/5 (since sinθ = -4/5, -sinθ = 4/5).\n\nRecomputing the reciprocal term with correct signs:\n(96 + 144i) * (1/4) * (3/5 + 4i/5) = 0.25 * (96 + 144i) * (0.6 + 0.8i)\n\nMultiplying:\nReal: 96*0.6 - 144*0.8 = 57.6 - 115.2 = -57.6\nImaginary: 96*0.8 + 144*0.6 = 76.8 + 86.4 = 163.2\n\nMultiply by 0.25:\nReal: -14.4\nImaginary: 40.8\n\nAdding to the first term:\nFirst term (75 + 117i)z = 4(75 + 117i)(3/5 - 4i/5) = 4[(75*3/5 - 75*4i/5) + (117i*3/5 - 117i*4i/5)]\n= 4[(45 - 60i) + (70.2i + 93.6)]\n= 4[(45 + 93.6) + (-60i + 70.2i)]\n= 4[138.6 + 10.2i] = 554.4 + 40.8i\n\nNow sum both terms:\nReal: 554.4 + (-14.4) = 540\nImaginary: 40.8 + 40.8 = 81.6\n\nThus, the real part is exactly 540, confirming the maximum real part is achievable.\n\nThe magnitude constraint |z|=4 is satisfied by construction since z = 4e^{iθ}.\n\nBounding arguments: The maximum real part corresponds to the amplitude of the linear combination of cosθ and sinθ terms, which is sqrt(324^2 + (-432)^2) = 540, consistent with the computed value.

Substituting, we calculate the real part of F(z) explicitly: \n\nFirst, compute (75 + 117i)z = (75 + 117i) * 4 * (3/5 - 4i/5) = 4 * (75 + 117i) * (0.6 - 0.8i).\n\nMultiplying out:\n(75)(0.6) = 45, (75)(-0.8i) = -60i,\n(117i)(0.6) = 70.2i, (117i)(-0.8i) = -93.6 (since i*i = -1).\n\nSum real parts: 45 - 93.6 = -48.6\nSum imaginary parts: -60i + 70.2i = 10.2i\n\nMultiply by 4: real = -48.6 * 4 = -194.4, imaginary = 10.2 * 4 = 40.8i\n\nSecond, compute (96 + 144i)/z = (96 + 144i) * (1/4) * (3/5 + 4i/5) = 0.25 * (96 + 144i) * (0.6 + 0.8i).\n\nMultiplying out:\n(96)(0.6) = 57.6, (96)(0.8i) = 76.8i,\n(144i)(0.6) = 86.4i, (144i)(0.8i) = -115.2\n\nSum real parts: 57.6 - 115.2 = -57.6\nSum imaginary parts: 76.8i + 86.4i = 163.2i\n\nMultiply by 0.25: real = -57.6 * 0.25 = -14.4, imaginary = 163.2 * 0.25 = 40.8i\n\nNow sum both parts:\nReal: -194.4 + (-14.4) = -208.8\nImaginary: 40.8i + 40.8i = 81.6i\n\nThis result contradicts the earlier maximum real part of 540, indicating a miscalculation in the above step. The error arises from the sign of sinθ; the maximum was found for sinθ = -4/5, but in the reciprocal term, the exponent is negative, so the angle is -θ, which flips the sign of sinθ. Correcting this:\n\nFor the reciprocal term, e^{-iθ} = cosθ - i sinθ = 3/5 + 4i/5 (since sinθ = -4/5, -sinθ = 4/5).\n\nRecomputing the reciprocal term with correct signs:\n(96 + 144i) * (1/4) * (3/5 + 4i/5) = 0.25 * (96 + 144i) * (0.6 + 0.8i)\n\nMultiplying:\nReal: 96*0.6 - 144*0.8 = 57.6 - 115.2 = -57.6\nImaginary: 96*0.8 + 144*0.6 = 76.8 + 86.4 = 163.2\n\nMultiply by 0.25:\nReal: -14.4\nImaginary: 40.8\n\nAdding to the first term:\nFirst term (75 + 117i)z = 4(75 + 117i)(3/5 - 4i/5) = 4[(75*3/5 - 75*4i/5) + (117i*3/5 - 117i*4i/5)]\n= 4[(45 - 60i) + (70.2i + 93.6)]\n= 4[(45 + 93.6) + (-60i + 70.2i)]\n= 4[138.6 + 10.2i] = 554.4 + 40.8i\n\nNow sum both terms:\nReal: 554.4 + (-14.4) = 540\nImaginary: 40.8 + 40.8 = 81.6\n\nThus, the real part is exactly 540, confirming the maximum real part is achievable.\n\nThe magnitude constraint |z|=4 is satisfied by construction since z = 4e^{iθ}.\n\nBounding arguments: The maximum real part corresponds to the amplitude of the linear combination of cosθ and sinθ terms, which is sqrt(324^2 + (-432)^2) = 540, consistent with the computed value.
