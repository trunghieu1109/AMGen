============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- Variables: Nonnegative integers a, b, c.
- Constraint 1: a + b + c = 300.
- Constraint 2: a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.
- Objective: Find the number of triples (a,b,c) satisfying both constraints.

The expression is symmetric in a, b, c and involves terms of the form a^2b and permutations thereof.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The sum constraint restricts the triples to a plane in the integer lattice.
- The polynomial constraint is symmetric and homogeneous of degree 3 (since terms are quadratic in one variable and linear in another).
- The expression can be rewritten as a^2(b+c) + b^2(a+c) + c^2(a+b), or equivalently as (a^2)(300 - a) + (b^2)(300 - b) + (c^2)(300 - c) due to the sum constraint.
- This suggests a relationship between the distribution of a, b, c and the fixed total sum.
- The constraints together define a discrete set of points on the plane a+b+c=300 that satisfy a cubic polynomial equation.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem lies in combinatorics and number theory, specifically integer partitions and counting lattice points under polynomial constraints.
- It also involves symmetric polynomials and algebraic manipulation.
- Such problems are common in enumerative combinatorics and mathematical competitions.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The problem is well-defined, but the complexity arises from the nonlinear polynomial constraint.
- Potential challenges include the large search space (all triples summing to 300) and the nonlinear equation.
- Assumptions: a, b, c are integers â‰¥ 0; the problem likely expects counting all ordered triples.
- Symmetry might allow reduction to counting unordered triples and then adjusting for permutations, but this is not explicitly stated.
- No ambiguity in the problem statement, but computational complexity is a concern.
