============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- N is a four-digit positive integer (i.e., 1000 ≤ N ≤ 9999).
- N has the property that if any one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7.
- Q and R are defined as the quotient and remainder when N is divided by 1000, i.e., N = 1000Q + R, with Q an integer between 1 and 9 (since N is four-digit) and 0 ≤ R < 1000.
- The task is to find Q + R.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- Changing any single digit of N to 1 produces a number divisible by 7. This implies a set of divisibility conditions for each digit position.
- Since N is four-digit, digits can be labeled as d_4 d_3 d_2 d_1 (thousands to units).
- For each digit position i, replacing d_i with 1 yields a number divisible by 7.
- These conditions impose modular arithmetic constraints on the digits of N.
- The problem asks for the greatest such N, so among all numbers satisfying these constraints, the maximum is sought.
- Q and R relate to the division of N by 1000, so Q is the thousands digit and R is the last three digits.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- Number theory, specifically modular arithmetic and divisibility rules.
- Elementary algebra related to digit manipulation and modular constraints.
- Problem is typical of mathematical competitions or recreational mathematics.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The problem is clear in its conditions; however, it assumes the reader understands "changing one digit to 1" means exactly one digit is replaced by 1, not multiple digits.
- It is implicit that the digit replaced is any one of the four digits, including possibly the digit already being 1.
- The problem does not specify if the original digit can be 1; presumably yes.
- Potential challenge: multiple configurations may satisfy the divisibility conditions; the problem asks for the greatest such number.
- Assumption: standard decimal representation, no leading zeros (since four-digit number).
- Assumption: division by 1000 is integer division with remainder as usual.
