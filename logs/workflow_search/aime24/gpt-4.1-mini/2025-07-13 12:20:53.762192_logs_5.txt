============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- The problem involves a tetrahedron named ABCD.
- The lengths of edges are given as follows:
  - AB = CD = √41
  - AC = BD = √80
  - BC = AD = √89
- There exists a point I inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from I to each of the four faces of the tetrahedron are equal.
- The equal distance from point I to each face can be expressed in the form \( \frac{m \sqrt{n}}{p} \), where m, n, p are positive integers, m and p are coprime, and n is square-free.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The tetrahedron ABCD is defined by six edges with specific lengths, exhibiting a certain symmetry since pairs of edges have equal lengths (AB=CD, AC=BD, BC=AD).
- The point I is located inside the tetrahedron such that its perpendicular distances to all four faces are equal, implying I is the incenter of the tetrahedron.
- The equal distance condition imposes a geometric constraint linking the position of I to the shape and size of the tetrahedron.
- The problem’s structure suggests the use of properties related to the incenter and possibly volume, face areas, or other metric relations to express the distance in the given radical form.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem lies primarily in the domain of solid geometry (3D Euclidean geometry).
- It involves concepts of tetrahedra, distances from points to planes, and properties of incenters in polyhedra.
- Subfields include metric geometry and possibly vector geometry or analytic geometry if coordinate methods are used.
- Such problems commonly appear in mathematical competitions and advanced geometry contexts.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The problem does not specify the coordinates or angles of the tetrahedron, only edge lengths, which may require deducing the shape or verifying its existence.
- It is assumed that the tetrahedron is non-degenerate and that the point I (incenter) exists uniquely inside it.
- The problem implicitly assumes knowledge of how to find the incenter and distances to faces in a tetrahedron.
- Potential challenges include handling the symmetry in edge lengths, computing face areas or volumes without explicit coordinates, and expressing the final distance in simplified radical form.
