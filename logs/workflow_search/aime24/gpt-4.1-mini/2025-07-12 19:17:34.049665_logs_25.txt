============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- The figure is a convex equilateral hexagon ABCDEF, meaning all six sides have equal length.
- The hexagon has the property that all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. Since it is a hexagon, opposite sides are AB and DE, BC and EF, CD and FA.
- A triangle is formed by the extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF. The sides of this triangle have lengths 200, 240, and 300.
- The objective is to find the common side length of the hexagon.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The hexagon is equilateral and has pairs of opposite sides parallel, implying it is a special type of hexagon, often called an affine-regular or equilateral hexagon with parallel opposite sides.
- The triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF suggests that these three lines (or their extensions) intersect pairwise to form a triangle outside or around the hexagon.
- The side lengths of this triangle (200, 240, 300) correspond to distances between intersection points of these extended lines.
- The parallelism and equal side length conditions impose strong geometric constraints, likely relating the hexagon’s side length to the triangle’s side lengths.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem lies primarily in Euclidean geometry, specifically polygon geometry and properties of convex polygons.
- It involves concepts of parallel lines, convex polygons, and properties of line intersections.
- The problem may also touch on affine geometry or vector geometry due to parallelism and length relations.
- Such problems are common in mathematical competitions and advanced geometry studies.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The exact configuration of the hexagon (e.g., orientation, coordinates) is not specified.
- The nature of the triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF is not fully detailed—whether the triangle is inside or outside the hexagon, or how the extensions intersect.
- It is assumed the hexagon is convex and equilateral with parallel opposite sides, but no information on angles or other side relations is given.
- To proceed, one might assume a coordinate system or vector representation to model the hexagon and the triangle formed by the extended lines.
- The problem does not specify which side length corresponds to which pair of extended sides in the triangle, which may require assumptions or derivations.
