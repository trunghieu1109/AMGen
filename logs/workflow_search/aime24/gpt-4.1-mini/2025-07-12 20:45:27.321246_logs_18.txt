============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- Points: O = (0,0), A = (1/2, 0), B = (0, sqrt(3)/2) in the coordinate plane.
- Segment AB connects A and B.
- Family \(\mathcal{F}\): all segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of length 1, with P on the x-axis (i.e., P = (x,0), x > 0) and Q on the y-axis (Q = (0,y), y > 0), lying in the first quadrant.
- There exists a unique point C on segment AB, distinct from A and B, such that C does not lie on any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) except for \(\overline{AB}\) itself.
- The quantity to find is \(OC^2 = \frac{p}{q}\), where p and q are positive coprime integers, and then compute p + q.

Objective: Determine the squared distance from O to the unique point C on AB with the stated property.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The segment AB lies between A and B, which are fixed points.
- The family \(\mathcal{F}\) consists of all unit-length segments connecting a point on the positive x-axis to a point on the positive y-axis.
- Each segment in \(\mathcal{F}\) has endpoints P = (x,0) and Q = (0,y) satisfying \(x^2 + y^2 = 1\).
- The problem states that C is the only point on AB (other than A and B) that is not covered by any such segment \(\overline{PQ}\) except for AB itself.
- This implies that for every other point on AB (except C), there exists some segment in \(\mathcal{F}\) passing through it.
- The uniqueness and exclusion of endpoints suggest a geometric or analytic characterization of C related to the coverage of the first quadrant by these unit segments.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem is primarily in Euclidean geometry and analytic geometry.
- It involves coordinate geometry, properties of line segments, and distance calculations.
- Concepts include loci of points, segment parametrization, and possibly optimization or uniqueness arguments.
- Such problems are common in mathematical competitions and geometric problem solving.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The exact meaning of "does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\)" could be interpreted as "no other segment in \(\mathcal{F}\) passes through C except AB"; this should be confirmed.
- The problem assumes the first quadrant, so P and Q have positive coordinates; this restricts the family \(\mathcal{F}\).
- The uniqueness of C suggests a special geometric property; understanding why such a point exists and is unique may require assumptions about continuity or coverage.
- It is assumed that segments in \(\mathcal{F}\) are closed line segments.
- No explicit parameterization of AB is given, but it can be inferred from A and B.
- The problem does not specify whether segments in \(\mathcal{F}\) can overlap or intersect AB at multiple points; presumably, only one intersection per segment is relevant.

Reasonable assumptions:
- Segments \(\overline{PQ}\) are closed and lie entirely in the first quadrant.
- The point C lies strictly between A and B (not equal to either).
- The problem is well-posed with a unique such point C.
- The squared distance \(OC^2\) is rational and can be expressed as a reduced fraction.
