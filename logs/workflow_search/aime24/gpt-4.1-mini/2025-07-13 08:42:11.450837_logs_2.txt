============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- A regular octagon has 8 vertices.
- Each vertex is colored independently red or blue with equal probability (1/2 each).
- The problem asks for the probability that there exists a rotation of the octagon such that all blue vertices are mapped onto vertices that were originally red.
- The probability is expressed as a reduced fraction \( \frac{m}{n} \), and the final answer sought is \( m + n \).

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The octagon's vertices are arranged in a circle, and rotations correspond to cyclic permutations of the vertex colors.
- The key condition is the existence of a rotation \( r \) such that the set of blue vertices after rotation is a subset of the original red vertices.
- Since colors are assigned independently, the problem involves probabilistic analysis over all colorings.
- The rotational symmetry group of the octagon is cyclic of order 8, generated by rotation by one vertex.
- The problem reduces to counting colorings for which there exists some rotation \( r \) with the blue set mapped into the red set.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem lies primarily in combinatorics and probability.
- It involves group actions (rotations) on sets, so group theory and combinatorial enumeration under symmetry are relevant.
- Concepts from discrete mathematics, such as counting colorings and analyzing orbits under group actions, are involved.
- Such problems are common in mathematical competitions and combinatorial probability contexts.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The problem states "the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices." It is implicit that the rotation is by multiples of 45 degrees (vertex-to-vertex rotations).
- It is not explicitly stated whether the rotation must be nontrivial (identity rotation is presumably allowed).
- The problem assumes independence and equal probability for coloring each vertex.
- Potential challenges include enumerating all colorings and checking the rotational condition efficiently.
- A reasonable assumption is that the rotation group considered is the cyclic group of order 8 acting on the vertices, and that the identity rotation is included.
- Another assumption is that the problem is asking for the probability over all possible colorings, not conditioned on any other event.
