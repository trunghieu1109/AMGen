Given Information: Aya walks 9 km each morning and stops at a coffee shop afterward. The total time includes walking time plus t minutes at the coffee shop. When walking at speed s km/h, total time is 4 hours (including t minutes). When walking at speed s + 2 km/h, total time is 2 hours 24 minutes (including t minutes). The problem asks for the total time (walk plus coffee) when walking at speed s + 0.5 km/h. Relationships: The total time equals walking time plus coffee time t. Walking time depends on speed and distance: walking time = 9 / speed (in hours). The coffee time t is constant across scenarios. The two given scenarios provide two equations involving s and t, allowing determination of these variables. The third scenario uses these values to find the total time at speed s + 0.5 km/h. Field of Study: This problem lies in algebra and arithmetic, involving linear equations and unit conversions between hours and minutes. It also touches on rate-time-distance relationships common in elementary algebra. Aspects Needing Clarification: The problem assumes t is the same in all scenarios and that walking speed is constant during each walk. It is implicit that the coffee shop time t is included in the total time given. No ambiguity in the problem statement is apparent. Reasonable assumptions include treating t as a fixed constant and speeds as positive real numbers. The problem is straightforward with no multiple configurations or ambiguous constraints.

Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get: 9/s - 9/(s+2) = 4 - 2.4 = 1.6. Simplify the left side: 9/s - 9/(s+2) = 9[(s+2) - s]/[s(s+2)] = 9(2)/[s(s+2)] = 18/[s(s+2)]. So, 18/[s(s+2)] = 1.6. Multiply both sides by s(s+2): 18 = 1.6 * s(s+2). Divide both sides by 1.6: s(s+2) = 18/1.6 = 11.25. Expand: s^2 + 2s = 11.25. Rearrange: s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0. Solve quadratic equation: s = [-2 ± sqrt(4 + 4*11.25)] / 2 = [-2 ± sqrt(4 + 45)] / 2 = [-2 ± sqrt(49)] / 2 = [-2 ± 7] / 2.

When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour.

The total time includes walking time plus t minutes at the coffee shop. When walking at speed s km/h, total time is 4 hours (including t minutes). When walking at speed s + 2 km/h, total time is 2 hours 24 minutes (including t minutes). The problem asks for the total time (walk plus coffee) when walking at speed s + 0.5 km/h. Relationships: The total time equals walking time plus coffee time t. Walking time depends on speed and distance: walking time = 9 / speed (in hours). The coffee time t is constant across scenarios. The two given scenarios provide two equations involving s and t, allowing determination of these variables. The third scenario uses these values to find the total time at speed s + 0.5 km/h.
