============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- The figure is a convex equilateral hexagon ABCDEF, meaning all its sides have equal length.
- All pairs of opposite sides are parallel, implying ABCDEF is a parallelogon with three pairs of parallel sides.
- The triangle formed by the extensions of sides AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300.
- The objective is to find the common side length of the hexagon.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- Since ABCDEF is equilateral and has opposite sides parallel, it is a special type of hexagon often called an equilateral parallelogon.
- The extensions of sides AB, CD, and EF intersect to form a triangle; the lengths of this triangle's sides are given.
- The parallelism and equal length conditions impose strong geometric constraints, likely relating the hexagon's side length to the triangle's side lengths.
- The problem likely involves vector or coordinate geometry to relate side vectors and the triangle formed by their extensions.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- The problem lies primarily in Euclidean geometry, specifically polygon geometry.
- Subfields include convex polygons, parallelism, and properties of equilateral polygons.
- Vector geometry or analytic geometry methods may be relevant.
- Such problems commonly appear in mathematical competitions and advanced geometry contexts.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The exact nature of the "extensions" of sides AB, CD, and EF: whether these are lines containing these segments or rays.
- The configuration of the triangle formed by these extensions: which sides correspond to which segments.
- Whether the triangle formed is inside or outside the hexagon.
- Potential ambiguity in orientation or labeling of vertices.

Reasonable assumptions include treating the extensions as infinite lines containing the sides and that the triangle formed is the one bounded by these three lines. These assumptions align with standard geometric interpretations and are necessary to proceed.
