============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- N is a four-digit positive integer (i.e., 1000 ≤ N ≤ 9999).
- N has the property that if any one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7.
- Q and R are defined as the quotient and remainder when N is divided by 1000, i.e., N = 1000Q + R, with Q an integer between 1 and 9 (since N is four-digit) and 0 ≤ R < 1000.
- The objective is to find Q + R.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- Changing any one digit of N to 1 produces a number divisible by 7. This implies that for each digit position, replacing that digit with 1 yields a multiple of 7.
- Since N has four digits, there are four such modified numbers, each differing from N in exactly one digit.
- The divisibility by 7 condition imposes modular arithmetic constraints on the digits of N.
- The division of N by 1000 separates N into its thousands digit (Q) and the last three digits (R), which may be useful in expressing N and analyzing digit changes.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- Number theory, specifically divisibility and modular arithmetic.
- Elementary algebra related to digit manipulation and place value.
- Potentially combinatorics or logic to handle digit replacement conditions.
- Such problems are common in mathematical competitions and recreational mathematics.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The problem does not explicitly state whether digits can be zero except for the leading digit (which must be nonzero for a four-digit number).
- It is assumed that changing a digit to 1 means replacing the digit at that position regardless of its original value.
- The problem does not specify if the original digit can already be 1; presumably, changing a digit that is already 1 to 1 leaves the number unchanged, which must also be divisible by 7.
- Potential complexity arises from multiple digit positions and ensuring all modified numbers are divisible by 7.
- Assumptions: digits are from 0 to 9, leading digit is nonzero, and the divisibility condition applies to all four digit positions independently.
