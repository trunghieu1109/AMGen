============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- Parameter: An integer base b ≥ 2.
- Definition: A positive integer n is called b-eautiful if:
  * n has exactly two digits in base b, i.e., n = x*b + y with digits x, y where 1 ≤ x ≤ b-1 and 0 ≤ y ≤ b-1.
  * The sum of the two digits equals the square root of n, i.e., x + y = √n.
- Example: For b=13, n=81 is b-eautiful since 81 = 6*13 + 3 and 6 + 3 = 9 = √81.
- Objective: Find the least integer b ≥ 2 such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The two-digit number n in base b is n = x*b + y with digit constraints.
- The condition x + y = √n links the digits linearly to the square root of the number they form.
- Since √n must be an integer, n must be a perfect square.
- The problem reduces to finding integer solutions (x,y,b) satisfying:
  x*b + y = (x + y)^2,
  with 1 ≤ x ≤ b-1, 0 ≤ y ≤ b-1, and b ≥ 2.
- The constraints on digits limit possible values of x and y, and the base b affects the range of n.
- The problem is to find the smallest b for which the count of such (x,y) pairs exceeds 10.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- Number theory: dealing with integer representations, perfect squares, and digit sums.
- Base number systems and positional notation.
- Diophantine equations: integer solutions to polynomial equations.
- Potentially combinatorics: counting valid digit pairs.
- The problem is typical in mathematical competitions and recreational number theory.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- The problem states 'exactly two digits' in base b, implying x ≠ 0; this is clear.
- It is implicit that digits are integers within [0, b-1].
- The problem does not specify if b-eautiful integers must be distinct; presumably yes.
- The problem assumes the square root is integer; this is deduced but not explicitly stated.
- Potential challenge: multiple (x,y) pairs may correspond to the same n if not careful, but since n = x*b + y, uniqueness is ensured.
- Assumption: counting distinct n values, each corresponding to unique (x,y) pairs.
- The problem requires analyzing the equation for varying b and counting solutions, which may be complex without further constraints.
