============== task analysis ================
1. Extract and Summarize Given Information:
- Variables: Nonnegative integers a, b, c.
- Constraints:
  - Linear: a + b + c = 300.
  - Polynomial: a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.
- Objective: Find the number of triples (a,b,c) satisfying both conditions.

2. Analyze Relationships Between Components:
- The first condition restricts the sum of the variables to a fixed total.
- The second condition is symmetric in a, b, c and involves terms of the form a^2b and permutations thereof.
- The polynomial can be rewritten or analyzed using symmetric sums or factorizations to understand dependencies.
- The symmetry suggests that permutations of a solution triple are also solutions.
- The constraints together define a discrete set of points on a plane (since a+b+c=300) that satisfy a nonlinear equation.

3. Identify the Field of Study:
- Combinatorics (counting integer solutions under constraints).
- Algebra (polynomial symmetric functions).
- Number theory (integer solutions to polynomial equations).
- Possibly discrete geometry or integer lattice point counting.

4. Highlight Aspects Needing Clarification:
- Whether permutations of (a,b,c) are considered distinct solutions or counted once.
- The complexity of the polynomial expression and whether it can be simplified or transformed.
- Potential multiple solution configurations due to symmetry.
- Assumption that a,b,c are integers â‰¥ 0, as stated.
- No explicit mention of ordering or uniqueness conditions, so likely all ordered triples count.
- The problem may require assumptions or techniques to handle the nonlinear constraint efficiently.
