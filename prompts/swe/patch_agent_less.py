AGENTLESS_REPAIR = """We are currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here is the issue text:
--- BEGIN ISSUE ---
{problem_statement}
--- END ISSUE ---

Below are some code segments, each from a relevant file. One or more of these files may contain bugs.

--- BEGIN FILE ---
```
{content}
```
--- END FILE ---

Please first localize the bug based on the issue statement, and then generate *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits to fix the issue.

Every *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit must use this format:
1. The file path
2. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
3. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
4. The dividing line: =======
5. The lines to replace into the source code
6. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE

Here is an example:

```python
### mathweb/flask/app.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Please note that the *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit REQUIRES PROPER INDENTATION. If you would like to add the line '        print(x)', you must fully write that out, with all those spaces before the code!
Wrap each *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit in a code block as shown in the example above. If you have multiple *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits, use a separate code block for each one.
Output your *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit in the 'answer' entry."

THINKING_SYSTEM = """
A user will ask you to solve a task. You should first draft your thinking process (inner monologue). Then, generate the solution.

Your response format must follow the template below:
<think>
Your thoughts or/and draft, like working through an exercise on scratch paper. Be as casual and as long as you want until you are confident to generate a correct solution.
</think>
<solution>
Final solution presented to the user.
</solution>
