    """"""sum_to_n is a function that sums numbers from 1 to n.
    
    The function uses the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers:
    sum = n * (n + 1) / 2
    
    Args:
        n (int): The upper limit of the sum (inclusive).
    
    Returns:
        int: The sum of all integers from 1 to n.

Correct Solution:
def sum_to_n(params you should put here):

    return sum(range(n + 1))
