Heinrich Gross participated in the Nazi regime's Aktion T4 more commonly referred to as what?,"Karl Freiherr Michel von Tüßling (27 July 1907 – 30 October 1991) was a Schutzstaffel (SS) officer who served in the Nazi government of German dictator Adolf Hitler and in the SS Main Office.  From 1936 onwards, he was the personal adjutant of ""Reichsleiter"" and SS-""Obergruppenführer"" Philipp Bouhler, who was in charge of Hitler's Chancellery (Kanzlei des Führers), head of the euthanasia programme Aktion T4, as well as co-initiator of Aktion 14f13.  In 1947 Tüßling provided an affidavit in defence of war criminal Viktor Brack who was sentenced to death at the Nuremberg trials.
Heinrich Gross (14 November 1915 – 15 December 2005) was an Austrian psychiatrist, medical doctor and neurologist, a reputed expert as a leading court-appointed psychiatrist, ill-famed for his proven involvement in the killing of at least nine children with physical, mental and/or emotional/behavioral characteristics considered ""unclean"" by the Nazi regime, under its Euthanasia Program.  His role in hundreds of other cases of infanticide is unclear.  Gross was head of the Spiegelgrund children's psychiatric clinic for two years during World War II.
Am Spiegelgrund was the name of a children's clinic in Vienna where 789 children were killed under the Nazi Regime Children's Euthanasia Program, also known as Aktion T4.  Between 1940-1945, the clinic operated as part of the psychological institution “Am Steinhof” (renamed the Otto Wagner Clinic) on the Baumgartner Höhe, now located in Penzing, the 14th district of Vienna.  This clinic was divided into a reform school and a sanatorium for children, which included a so-called Children’s Ward, where sick, disabled, and otherwise ‘un-educable’ adolescents were abused and subjected to harsh medical experiments.  Some died by lethal injection and gas poisoning; others by disease, undernourishment, exposure to the elements, and 'accidents' relating to their conditions.  The brains of up to 800 victims were preserved in jars and housed in the hospital for decades.
Philipp Bouhler (11 September 1899 – 19 May 1945) was a senior Nazi Party official who was both a ""Reichsleiter"" (National Leader) and Chief of the Chancellery of the Führer of the NSDAP.  He was also an SS-""Obergruppenführer"" in the ""Allgemeine SS"" who was responsible for the Nazi ""Aktion T4"" euthanasia program that killed more than 70,000 handicapped adults and children in Nazi Germany, as well as co-initiator of ""Aktion 14f13"", also called ""Sonderbehandlung"" (""special treatment""), that killed 15,000–20,000 concentration camp prisoners.
Artur Hojan (7 August 1973 – found dead, 9 February 2014) was a journalist and published author specializing in the history of the Chełmno extermination camp and the Nazi involuntary euthanasia programme conducted in the territory of occupied Poland by the SS during World War II.  Hojan was the co-founder of the ""Tiergartenstrasse4"" Association in 2005 (together with Cameron Munro) devoted to Aktion T4 history, with emphasis on the Kościan psychiatric hospital located where he lived.  Hojan, age of 40, left home in the evening of 1 December 2013 at 8 p.m. for a walk around town and disappeared.  His body was found two months later on 9 February 2014 floating in the Obra canal near the town of Kiełczewo, and identified later.  The cause of death has not been determined.  He was buried at the Kościan cemetery on 15 February 2014.  He left behind a wife and young daughter.  The monograph ""Treblinka Death Camp: History, Biographies, Remembrance"" by Chris Webb, the co-founder of H.E.A.R.T (also known as the HolocaustResearchProject.org), is dedicated to his memory.
Aktion T4 (German, ] ) was a postwar name for mass murder through involuntary euthanasia in Nazi Germany.  The name T4 is an abbreviation of ""Tiergartenstraße 4"", a street address of the Chancellery department set up in the spring of 1940, in the Berlin borough of Tiergarten, which recruited and paid personnel associated with T4.  Certain German physicians were authorized to select patients ""deemed incurably sick, after most critical medical examination"" and then administer to them a ""mercy death"" (""Gnadentod"") .  In October 1939 Adolf Hitler signed a ""euthanasia decree"" backdated to 1 September 1939 that authorized his personal physician Karl Brandt and ""Reichsleiter"" Philipp Bouhler to implement the programme.
Karl Brandt (January 8, 1904 – June 2, 1948) was a German physician and ""Schutzstaffel"" (SS) officer in Nazi Germany.  Trained in surgery, Brandt joined the Nazi Party in 1932 and became Adolf Hitler's escort physician in August 1934.  A member of Hitler's inner circle at the Berghof, he was selected by Philipp Bouhler, the head of Hitler's Chancellery, to administer the ""Aktion T4"" euthanasia program.  Brandt was later appointed the Reich Commissioner of Sanitation and Health (""Bevollmächtigter für das Sanitäts- und Gesundheitswesen"").  Accused of involvement in human experimentation and other war crimes, Brandt was indicted in late 1946 and faced trial before a U.S. military tribunal along with 22 others in ""United States of America v. Karl Brandt, et al"".  He was convicted, sentenced to death, and later hanged on June 2, 1948.
Gerhard Herbert Kretschmar (20 February 1939 – 25 July 1939), was a German child born with severe disabilities.  After receiving a petition from the child's parents, the German Führer Adolf Hitler authorized one of his personal physicians, Karl Brandt, to have the child killed.  This marked the beginning of the program in Nazi Germany known as a ""euthanasia program"" (Aktion T4) which ultimately resulted in the deliberate killing of about 200,000 people with mental and/or physical disabilities.
Adolf Hitler signed a memorandum authorizing involuntary euthanasia in October 1939 to serve as the legal basis for Aktion T4, the Nazi forced euthanasia program.  Its purpose was to assure the doctors and nurses who took part in the euthanasia program would not be prosecuted for murder.  During the postwar trials of these same individuals, they attempted to use this decree as a justification for their actions.
Dasein ohne Leben – Psychiatrie und Menschlichkeit (""Existence Without Life"" – ""Psychiatry and Humanity"") is a 1942 Nazi propaganda film about the physically and mentally disabled: closeups of disabled persons.  The director was Hermann Schwenninger, one of the three managing directors of Gemeinnützige Krankentransport (""Charitable Ambulance""), a front company of Aktion T4, the central institution for the mass murder of patients in the Third Reich.  Schwenninger also wrote parts of the screenplay of ""Ich klage an"".

Hurricane Keith was an Atlantic hurricane in October 2000 that caused extensive damage in Central America, especially in Mexico and Belize.  It was the fifteenth tropical cyclone, eleventh named storm, and seventh hurricane of the that year's Atlantic hurricane season.  Keith developed as a tropical depression from a tropical wave in the western Caribbean Sea on September 28.  The depression gradually strengthened, and became Tropical Storm Keith on the following day.  As the storm tracked westward, it continued to intensify and was upgraded to a hurricane on September 30.  Shortly thereafter, Keith began to rapidly deepen, and peaked as a Category 4 hurricane less than 24 hours later.  Keith then began to meander erratically offshore of Belize, which significantly weakened the storm due to land interaction.  By late on October 2, Keith made landfall in Ambergris Caye, Belize as a minimal hurricane.  It quickly weakened to a tropical storm, before another landfall occurred near Belize City early on the following day.  While moving inland over the Yucatán Peninsula, Keith weakened further, and was downgraded to a tropical depression before emerging into the Gulf of Mexico on October 4.

She was active in the civic life of her country and held many honorary and active positions, including chairman of Fu Jen Catholic University.

The Battle of Yiwu (伊吾) is also called the Battle to Defend Yiwu (伊吾保卫战) by the Communist Party of China, and resulted in the communist victory.

The Campaign to Defend Siping (四平保卫战) was a struggle between the Nationalists and the communists for the control of Siping during the Chinese Civil War in the post World War II era.  The nationalists have combined this campaign with the Battle of Siping as part of the battle, but this was rather misleading since the strategies for both sides were totally different from the strategies in this campaign and unrelated to each other, furthermore, the commanders for both sides in this campaign were completely different from the Battle of Siping.  More importantly, the nationalists in the Battle of Siping was in name only, because they were former nationalists (mostly warlords ostensively under nationalist reign) turned Japanese puppet regime forces who rejoined the nationalists after World War II, and the local bandits recruited by the nationalist administrators to fight off communists, since Chiang Kai-shek’s nationalist regime simply did not have the resource to rapidly deploy his forces into the region.  In fact, in the Battle of Siping, Chiang’s own force did not even participated in the fights.  This campaign was characterized by the fact that the supreme commanders of both sides had overestimated their strength and set unrealistic goals that could doom their troops in the field, but in both cases, the brilliant frontline commanders on both sides had successfully averted the potential catastrophes by convincing their respective supreme commanders to change their original decisions.

The beginnings of Portuguese poetry go back to the early 12th century, around the time when the County of Portugal separated from the medieval Kingdom of Galicia in the northwest of the Iberian Peninsula.  It was in this region that the ancestral language of both modern Portuguese and modern Galician, known today as Galician-Portuguese, was the common language of the people.  Like the troubadour culture in the Iberian Peninsula and the rest of Europe, Galician-Portuguese poets sang the love for a woman, which often turned into personal insults, as she had hurt her lover's pride.  However, this region produced a specific type of song, known as ""cantigas de amigo"" (songs of a friend).  In these, the lyrical subject is always a woman (though the singer was male) talking about her friend (lover) from whom she has been separated - by war or other activities - as shown in the Reconquista.  They discuss the loneliness that the woman feels.  But some poems also project eroticism, or confess the lover's meeting in a secret place, often through a dialogue she has with her mother or with natural elements (such could be considered a custom adapted from the pagan peoples in the region).  Epic poetry was also produced, as was common in Romantic medieval regions (""Gesta de D. Afonso Henriques"", of unknown authorship).

Acclimatisation societies were voluntary associations in the 19th and 20th centuries that encouraged the introduction of non-native species in various places around the world with the hope of their acclimatisation and adaptation.  The motivation at the time was a sense that introducing these species of plants and animals would enrich the flora and fauna of a region .  These societies were born during a period of colonialism when Europeans began to settle in unfamiliar environments, and the movement sought to establish familiar plants and animals (mainly from Europe) in new areas while also bringing exotic and useful foreign plants and animals into the European centres.  Today it is widely understood that introducing species can be harmful to native species and their ecosystems; for example, in Australia plants were harmed by rabbits' overgrazing; in North America house sparrows displace and kill native birds; and around the world, salamander populations are today threatened by introduced fungal infections.  At the time of acclimatisation societies, however, this was insufficiently understood .
The prohibition ""do not feed the animals"" reflects a policy forbidding the artificial feeding of wildlife (wild or feral animals) in situations where the animals, or the people doing the feeding, might be harmed.  Signs displaying this message are commonly found in zoos, circuses, animal theme parks, aquariums, national parks, parks, public spaces, farms, and other places where people come into contact with wildlife.  In some cases there are laws to enforce such no-feeding policies.  However, some people (such as some of those who enjoy feeding pigeons in cities) openly and strongly oppose such laws claiming that animals such as pigeons can be an amenity for people who do not have company such as friends or family, and say that the laws prohibiting feeding animals in urban places must change.  In some countries, such as Greece, feeding the pigeons in cities is a widespread practice.  Cultural hostility to feeding animals in cities and laws that ban the practice raise concerns about how humans relate to other living beings in the urban environment.  Politicians have also protested laws that ban feeding feral pigeons in cities.  Feral pigeons in cities existed for thousands of years but only recently in some countries humans started seeing them as a nuisance and became hostile to them.  In India, feeding feral animals in cities is considered a noble act.  Academicians say that how humans treat animals is related to how humans treat each other and thus raise concerns about the cultural shift from seeing feral city pigeons as harmless in the 1800s to seeing them a undesirable in some countries in the 2000s.

In which county is the English king Harold Godwinson buried?,"Tostig Godwinson ( 1026 – 25 September 1066) was an Anglo-Saxon Earl of Northumbria and brother of King Harold Godwinson.  After being exiled by his brother, Tostig supported the Norwegian king Harald Hardrada's invasion of England, and was killed at the Battle of Stamford Bridge.
Edith the Fair (Old English: ""Ealdgȳð Swann hnesce"" , ""Edyth the Gentle Swan""; c. 1025 – c. 1086), also known as Edith Swanneck, was the first wife of King Harold Godwinson.  ""Swanneck"" (or Swan-Neck) comes from the folk etymology which made her in Old English as ""swann hnecca"", ""swan neck"", which was actually most likely a corrupted form of ""swann hnesce, """"Gentle Swan"""" "".  She is sometimes confused with Ealdgyth, daughter of Earl Ælfgar of Mercia, who was queen during Harold's reign.
Edith Walks is a 2017 documentary film directed by Andrew Kötting which imagines a journey by Edith the Fair, wife of English king Harold Godwinson, from Waltham Abbey where he is buried to near the site of the Battle of Hastings and the invasion of England by William the Conqueror in 1066.  It includes contributions from the writers Alan Moore and Iain Sinclair, the torch singer Claudia Barton, and the musician Jem Finer.
Fictional accounts based on the events surrounding Harold Godwinson's brief reign as king of England have been published, notably the play ""Harold"", by Alfred, Lord Tennyson, in 1876; and the novel ""Last of the Saxon Kings"", by Edward Bulwer-Lytton, in 1848.  Rudyard Kipling wrote a short story, included in his 1910 collection, ""Rewards and Fairies"", where an aged King Harold meets Henry I and dies in the arms of a Saxon knight.
The Last English King (1997) is a historical novel by English writer Julian Rathbone.  The novel covers the time of the Battle of Hastings.  It revolves around Walt Edwinson, a housecarl of Harold Godwinson, the last Anglo-Saxon king of England.  The story starts with Walt returning to his home at Iwerne in Dorset four years after the Battle of Hastings.  He had fled England after the defeat of the Anglo-Saxons and had spent the time travelling across Europe and Asia Minor.  The story of his journey from Constantinople via Nicomedia and Nicaea to Side is then recounted in parallel with his recollections of the time before the battle, such as his accompanying Harold to William of Normandy's attack on Dinan.
Leofwine Godwinson (c. 1035 – 14 October 1066) was a younger brother of King Harold Godwinson, the fifth son of Earl Godwin.
The Battle of Stamford Bridge took place at the village of Stamford Bridge, East Riding of Yorkshire, in England on 25 September 1066, between an English army under King Harold Godwinson and an invading Norwegian force led by King Harald Hardrada and the English king's brother Tostig Godwinson.  After a bloody battle, both Hardrada and Tostig along with most of the Norwegians were killed.  Although Harold Godwinson repelled the Norwegian invaders, his army was defeated by the Normans at Hastings less than three weeks later.  The battle has traditionally been presented as symbolising the end of the Viking Age, although major Scandinavian campaigns in Britain and Ireland occurred in the following decades, such as those of King Sweyn Estrithson of Denmark in 1069–1070 and King Magnus Barefoot of Norway in 1098 and 1102–1103.
Gytha Thorkelsdóttir (Old English: ""Gȳða Þorkelsdōttir"" , 997 – c. 1069), also called Githa, was a Danish noblewoman.  She was the mother of King Harold Godwinson and of Edith of Wessex, queen consort of King Edward the Confessor of England.

To the east of the existing church are traces of an enormous eastward enlargement of the building, begun following the re-foundation of the abbey in 1177.  In the Late Middle Ages, Waltham was one of the largest church buildings in England and a major site of pilgrimage; in 1540 was the last religious community to be closed during the Dissolution of the Monasteries.  It is still an active parish church for the town.
Godwin of Wessex (Old English: ""Godƿin"" ; 100115 April 1053) was one of the most powerful earls in England under the Danish king Cnut the Great and his successors.

Lieutenant General Andrew Davis Bruce (September 14, 1894 – July 28, 1969) was an American academic and soldier who served as the third president of the University of Houston.  He retired from the United States Army in 1954 as a lieutenant general after seeing action in both World War I and World War II and founding Fort Hood, Texas.  Three countries, France, the Philippines, and the United States, awarded him service medals, including the Distinguished Service Cross, the U.S. Army's second highest military decoration.  Bruce is interred in Arlington National Cemetery.
The Distinguished Service Cross is the second highest military award that can be given to a member of the United States Army (and previously, the United States Army Air Forces and the United States Air Force), for extreme gallantry and risk of life in actual combat with an armed enemy force.  Actions that merit the Distinguished Service Cross must be of such a high degree that they are above those required for all other U.S. combat decorations but do not meet the criteria for the Medal of Honor.  The Distinguished Service Cross is equivalent to the Navy Cross (Navy and Marine Corps), the Air Force Cross (Air Force), and the Coast Guard Cross (Coast Guard).

Cavazos served with great distinction for thirty-three years, with his final command as head of the U.S. Army Forces Command.
In the United States Army, United States Marine Corps, and United States Air Force, major general is a two-star general-officer rank, with the pay grade of O-8.

(The higher ranks are temporary ranks linked to specific positions, although virtually all officers who have been promoted to those ranks are approved to retire at their highest earned rank.)

She had a small, devoted following, but did not reach a mass audience during her lifetime.  She rose to sudden literary fame eleven years after her death, in August 2015, with Farrar, Straus and Giroux's publication of a volume of selected stories, ""A Manual For Cleaning Women"", edited by Stephen Emerson.  It hit ""The New York Times"" bestseller list in its second week, and within a few weeks, had outsold all her previous books combined.

Tao Yuanming (365? –427), also known as Tao Qian (Hanyu Pinyin) or T'ao Ch'ien (Wade-Giles), was a Chinese poet who lived during the Eastern Jin (317-420) and Liu Song (420-479) dynasties.  He is considered to be one of the greatest poets of the Six dynasties period.  Tao Yuanming spent most of his life in reclusion, living in a small house in the countryside, reading, drinking wine, receiving the occasional guest, and writing poems in which he often reflected on the pleasures and difficulties of life in the countryside, as well as his decision to withdraw from civil service.  His simple, direct, and unmannered style was at odds with the norms for literary writing in his time.  Although he was relatively well-known as a recluse poet in the Tang dynasty (618-907), it was not until the Northern Song dynasty (960-1127), when influential literati figures such as Su Shi (1037-1101) declared him a paragon of authenticity and spontaneity in poetry, that Tao Yuanming would achieve lasting literary fame.  He is also regarded as the foremost representative of what would latter be known as Fields and Gardens poetry, a style of landscape poetry that found inspiration in the beauty and serenity of the natural world close at hand.

In 1991, seven years after meeting in a summer stock production of ""Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat"" in Shamokin Dam, Pennsylvania, Dan Murphy and Sharon Maroney (married), along with fellow performer Matthew Ryan (a native of Tigard, OR) and his partner Joseph Morkys, decided to move from New York City to start a summer stock theatre in Tigard.  The team pooled their savings of $21,000 and in November 1991, Broadway Rose Theatre Company was incorporated as a 501(c)(3).  In the summer of 1992, the first season of Broadway Rose Theatre Company was performed at the Deb Fennell Auditorium at Tigard High School.  The company produced five mainstage shows and a children's show in eight weeks, with an average audience of 32 people per performance.  The company lost $8,700 in its first season, but the following year the fledgling company received a $3,000 grant from the Metropolitan Arts Commission (a forerunner of the Regional Arts & Culture Council), to help bring the organization out of debt.  In 1993, the company produced ""Oklahoma! "" with no funds—putting the entire payroll on Dan's personal credit card.  The situation resolved itself as audiences picked up.  In 1994, the company received a $4,000 grant from the Metropolitan Arts Commission.  Audiences averaged 132 people per performance that year—a 313 percent increase from 1992.  In 1995, The Collins Foundation provided the company a $5,000 grant, allowing Sharon Maroney to become the company's first paid employee.  Platt Electric Supply became Broadway Rose's first title sponsor in 1996, providing a new level of stable funding (they would stay on as a title sponsor through 2012 when Harvey Platt sold the company).  In 1997, co-founders Matthew Ryan and Joe Morkys left Broadway Rose and returned to New York.  That year Broadway Rose held its first drama camp for young performers aged 8–11.  Also in 1997, Shoshana Bean, who would later become famous for portraying Elphaba on Broadway in the musical ""Wicked"""","" starred in the Broadway Rose production of ""Bye Bye Birdie.""  The company's offices moved from Dan and Sharon's home to a Platt Electric Supply branch office in 1999.  Later that year, the Sherwood Arts Council contracted Broadway Rose to produce ""Broadway Goes Hollywood"", a fundraiser for SAC held at the historic Robin Hood Theater in Sherwood, OR.  Broadway Rose's annual budget rose to around $175,000 with ticket sales accounting for just under half of the total, and Dan's general manager position officially became funded, making him an employee rather than a volunteer.

The Wise Woman of Hoxton is a city comedy by the early modern English playwright Thomas Heywood.  It was published under the title ""The Wise-Woman of Hogsdon"" in 1638, though it was probably first performed c. 1604 by the Queen's Men company (of which Heywood was a shareholder), either at The Curtain or perhaps The Red Bull.  The play is set in Hoxton, an area that at the time was outside the boundaries of the city of London and notorious for its entertainments and recreations.  The Victorian critic F. G. Fleay suggested that Heywood, who was also an actor, originally played the part of Sencer.  It has often been compared with Ben Jonson's comic masterpiece ""The Alchemist"" (1610)—the poet T. S. Eliot, for example, argued that with this play Heywood ""succeeds with something not too far below Jonson to be comparable to that master's work"".

Jean-Louis Aumer was a French danseur and choreographer, who was born in Strasbourg on 21 April 1774, and who died in Saint-Martin-de-Boscherville in July 1833.  Educated at the school of the Paris Opera Ballet, he joined the company in 1801 after an initial engagement with Jean Dauberval in Bordeaux.  The Paris Opera's ""maître de ballet"" Pierre Gardel presented an obstacle which led Aumer to choose the Théâtre de la Porte Saint-Martin as the venue for which to create his early ballets.  Faced with the implacable competition from Gardel, Aumer left France for engagements in Kassel (1808–1814) and Vienna (1814–1820).  Brief periods in Paris (1821–1822) and London (1824–1825) were followed by his return to the Paris Opera Ballet (1820–1831), where, enriched by the experience of working abroad, he engaged in a profound renovation of the French repertory, capped by his ""chef-d'œuvre"", ""Manon Lescaut"" (1830).

Cesare Pugni (Russian: Цезарь Пуни ) (] ; 31 May 1802–26 January [O.S. 14 January] 1870 ) born in Genoa, was an Italian composer of ballet music, a pianist and a violinist.  In his early career he composed operas, symphonies, and various other forms of orchestral music.  Pugni is most noted for the ballets he composed for Her Majesty's Theatre in London (1843–1850), and for the Imperial Theatres in St. Petersburg, Russia (1850–1870).  The majority of his ballet music was composed for the works of the ballet master Jules Perrot, who mounted nearly every one of his ballets to scores by Pugni.  In 1850 Perrot departed London for Russia, having accepted the position of ""Premier maître de ballet"" of the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatres at the behest of Carlotta Grisi, who was engaged as ""Prima ballerina"".  Cesare Pugni followed Perrot and Grisi to Russia, and remained in the imperial capital even after Grisi's departure in 1853 and Perrot's departure in 1858.

Ballet Master (also ""Balletmaster"", ""Ballet Mistress"" [increasingly archaic English language use], ""Premier Maître de ballet"" or ""Premier Maître de ballet en Chef"") is the term used for an employee of a ballet company who is responsible for the level of competence of the dancers in their company.  In modern times, ballet masters are generally charged with teaching the daily company ballet class and rehearsing the dancers for both new and established ballets in the company's repertoire.

Cuthy Mede is a Malawian artist.  Lonely Planet said ""possibly the best-known [Malawian] artist is Cuthy Mede – he is also actively involved in the development and promotion of Malawian art within the country and around the world.""  Cuthy Mede grew up on Likoma Island, Lake Malawi where he drew in the rough sands of the beach as a child.  Later he studied Fine Art in Chancellor College and became a lecturer at the College in the 1970s.  By the 1980s Mede established Gallerie Africaine in Lilongwe City Centre, the first art gallery by a local artist in Malawi.  Mede exhibited his work widely in Malawi, becoming a successful artist selling his work to international collectors.  Mede encouraged the work of young Malawian artists struggling to make a living selling folk art and wood carvings as street traders.  He also brought fine art work from other Malawian artists into his Gallery.  He was commissioned to paint a large mural decorating the City Centre.  Mede is best known for his modern art styles: modern, futurist, cubist and pointillist, with strong local themes.  His paintings depicted local people, historic events and current events in Malawi, Biblical references with local interpretations, indigenous religious expressions, and paintings about ideas such as Justice, Greed, Man and Machine.  His paintings depict famine, refugees from Mozambique during the Civil War, voting and democracy, wedding celebration, spirits and possession, and the Nyau masquerade.  Mede's less known work is realistic, including a reproduction of the Mona Lisa.  His best known work is dominated by bright primary colors, cubist style, though his pointillist work favors ochres and softer tones in the overall effect.  In later years Mede painted mostly in shades of blue, then white on white, the purest light.  Mede is an evangelical Christian and his work begins with a point of light from which the rest of the painting flows, the energy from God.  This point of light is evident in most of his paintings as a single dot, a sun or moon, or an orb.  Best known for his paintings, Mede also produced sculptural forms such as wood figures covered in beads and pigments.  His garden in Lilongwe was made into a work of art, in white and light, with fluorescent light tubes hanging from trees and white painted rocks lining the drive and entry.  Mede's wife, Esther (deceased 2009), served as Principal Secretary for the Ministry of Research and Environmental Affairs in the Malawi government.

John Cowper Powys ( ; 8 October 187217 June 1963) was a British philosopher, lecturer, novelist, literary critic, and poet.  Although Powys published a collection of poems in 1896 and his first novel in 1915, he did not gain success as a writer until he published the novel ""Wolf Solent"" in 1929.  He was influenced by many writers, but he has been particularly seen as a successor to Thomas Hardy, and ""Wolf Solent"", ""A Glastonbury Romance"" (1932), along with ""Weymouth Sands"" (1934) and ""Maiden Castle"" (1936), are often referred to as his Wessex novels.  As with Hardy's novels, the landscape plays a major role in Powys's works, and an elemental philosophy is important in the lives of his characters.  In 1934 he published his important ""Autobiography"".  Powys was also a highly successful itinerant lecturer, first in England and then from 1905 until 1930 in the USA.  Many of Powys's novels were written in America and his early novels, and all his major novels, up to and including ""Owen Glendower"" (1940), as well as ""Autobiography,"" were first published in the United States",6,six,0.0,0.05442764999999997

The Curtiss OX-5 was an early V-8 American liquid-cooled aircraft engine built by Curtiss.  It was the first American-designed aircraft engine to enter mass production, although it was considered obsolete when it did so in 1917.  It nevertheless found widespread use on a number of aircraft, perhaps the most famous being the JN-4 ""Jenny"".  Some 12,600 units were built through early 1919.  The wide availability of the engine in the surplus market made it common until the 1930s, although it was considered unreliable for most of its service life.  Today, the engine can be found powering many Edwardian automobile racing specials on the historic racing scene.

The Australian government ordered 24 F-111Cs to equip the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) in 1963, but the aircraft were not delivered until 1973 because of long-running technical problems.  During 1979 and 1980 four of these aircraft were converted to the RF-111C reconnaissance variant.  Four ex-United States Air Force (USAF) F-111As were purchased by Australia and converted to F-111C standard in 1982 to replace F-111Cs destroyed during accidents.  Australia also operated 15 F-111Gs between 1993 and 2007, mainly for conversion training.  The RAAF retired its remaining F-111Cs in December 2010.  In Australian military and aviation circles, the F-111 Aardvark was affectionately known as the ""Pig"", due to its long snout and terrain-following ability.

He spent his career working for Convair which became General Dynamics, then Lockheed, and then Lockheed Martin.  His feisty personality and at times insubordinate attitude at one time led company leaders to strongly consider firing him.  However, his brilliance at envisioning and designing desirable aircraft years before there was even a market for them led to his appointment as Vice President for science and engineering for all of General Dynamics.
