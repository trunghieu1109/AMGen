As a result, its population has gradually declining and rapidly aging. In 2011, the conservative government began a program to increase the birth rate with a focus on ethnic Magyars by reinstating 3 year maternity leave as well as boosting part-time jobs. The birth rate has gradually increased from 1.27 children born/woman in 2011. The natural decrease in the first 10 months of 2016 was only 25,828 which was 8,162 less than the corresponding period in 2015. In 2015, 47.9% of births were to unmarried women.

Byron Leftwich then completed a short pass to Fred Taylor, who turned it into a 32-yard gain. Two plays later, Maurice Jones-Drew scored on a 6-yard touchdown run. After forcing a punt, Jacksonville wasted no time tacking onto their lead, with Leftwich completing passes to Reggie Williams and George Wrighster for long gains. Taylor would then score on a 13-yard touchdown run for a 14-0 Jaguars lead. Early in the second quarter, the Jets attempted a punt, but the Jaguars' Gerald Sensabaugh blocked it, and Jorge Cordova recovered at the Jets' 8-yard line. Three plays later, Jones-Drew scored on a 4-yard touchdown run, surviving a challenge by the Jets. It only snowballed from there, as Pennington was intercepted by Terry Cousin on the next possession, and Leftwich flipped a 1-yard touchdown pass to Wrighster. Jacksonville would add a Josh Scobee 43-yard field goal early in the second half, and after Deon Grant intercepted Pennington, Leftwich threw a 16-yard touchdown pass to Williams for a 38-0 lead. The Jets' lone scoring chance in the second half was stopped when Leon Washington was stuffed on a 4th-and-goal from the Jaguars' 1-yard line early in the fourth quarter. The Jets were stopped on fourth down on their next possession when Pennington's scramble fell a yard short, and Scobee added a 40-yard field goal to close the scoring.

The lands adjoining towns and strongholds were captured by the rebels and the peasant uprising spread to the Bavarian Forest, parts of the Upper Palatinate and Kelheim on the Danube. A Braunau Parliament meeting was held in December 1705 in the then-Bavarian Braunau. Long before the French Revolution and early German parliamentarianism the meeting was held on 21 December 1705 in an inn belonging to the Baron von Paumgarten; representatives met of the four estates in Bavaria: aristocracy, clergy, burghers and peasants. The Braunau Parliament  is the name of the congress on the defence of the state of Bavaria held at Braunau am Inn convened on 21 December 1705. Following the initial uprising in November 1705, there was little response from the Austrians for nearly two months. However, that changed following an attempt by the rebels to capture the Bavarian capital, Munich. Following their unsuccessful attack, the night of 25 December 1705 saw an Austrian column encounter the peasant army near Sendling outside of Munich.  The battle was known as Sendling's Night of Murder  or the Sendling Christmas Day Massacre. The insurgents from the Bavarian Oberland were defeated and completely routed by Emperor Joseph I's troops. The number of deaths on the Bavarian side in this battle is estimated at around 1,100 men, but the Austrians lost only about 40. Some of the insurgents were killed after they had already surrendered.  About two weeks later, on 8 January 1706, the Battle of Aidenbach ended with the utter defeat of the insurgents and about 4,000 casualties on the Bavarian side.

In the 1685 attempt, the Venetian armies were aided by the local militia of the Republic of Poljica, who thereby rebelled against their nominal Ottoman suzerainty that had existed since 1513. In an effort to retaliate to Poljica, in June 1685, the Ottomans attacked Zadvarje, and in July 1686 Dolac and Srijane, but were pushed back, and suffered major casualties. With the help of the local population of Poljica as well as the Morlachs, the fortress of Sinj finally fell to the Venetian army on 30 September 1686. On 1 September 1687 the siege of Herceg Novi started, and ended with a Venetian victory on 30 September. Knin was taken after a twelve-day siege on 11 September 1688. The capture of the Knin Fortress marked the end of the successful Venetian campaign to expand their territory in inland Dalmatia, and it also determined much of the final border between Dalmatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina that stands today. The Ottomans would besiege Sinj again in the Second Morean War, but would be repelled. On 26 November 1690, Venice took Vrgorac, which opened the route towards Imotski and Mostar.

At the time, the Habsburg King Ferdinand I of Bohemia  immediately rejected the agreement; nevertheless, in 1675 the \"Great Elector\" Frederick William of Brandenburg laid claim to the Silesian principalities when, with the death of Duke George William of Liegnitz, the Piast line ended. In 1603, Hohenzollern Elector Joachim III Frederick of Brandenburg also inherited the Silesian Duchy of Jägerndorf from his cousin, Margrave George Frederick of Brandenburg-Ansbach. After the Bohemian Revolt and the outbreak of the Thirty Years' War, however, the Catholic Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand II confiscated the possessions of the Protestant Hohenzollerns in his Bohemian lands in 1621 after winning the Battle of White Mountain. The Electors of Brandenburg continued, nevertheless, to assert themselves as the legitimate rulers of Jägerndorf. Brandenburg, however, was unable to enforce these dynastic territorial claims. In 1685, when Austria was engaged in the Great Turkish War, Emperor Leopold I gave Elector Frederick William immediate control of the Silesian exclave of Schwiebus in return for military support against the Turks and the surrender of the outstanding Hohenzollern claims in Silesia. However, after the accession of the Elector's son and successor, Frederick III of Brandenburg, the Emperor took back control of Schwiebus in 1694, asserting that the territory had only been personally assigned to the late Frederick William for life.

In the late 1920s under Stalin, the party engaged in an intensive recruitment campaign, the \"Lenin Levy\", resulting in new members referred to as the Lenin Enrolment, from both the working class and rural areas. This represented an attempt to \"proletarianize\" the party and an attempt by Stalin to strengthen his base by outnumbering the Old Bolsheviks and reducing their influence in the Party. In 1925, the party had 1,025,000 members in a Soviet population of 147 million. In 1927, membership had risen to 1,200,000. During the collectivization campaign and industrialization campaigns of the first five-year plan from 1929 to 1933, party membership grew rapidly to approximately 3.5 million members. However, party leaders suspected that the mass intake of new members had allowed \"social-alien elements\" to penetrate the partys ranks and document verifications of membership ensued in 1933 and 1935, removing supposedly unreliable members. Meanwhile, the party closed its ranks to new members from 1933 to November 1936. Even after the reopening of party recruiting, membership fell to 1.9 million by 1939.

After another Titans punt, Tennessee head coach Jeff Fisher grew impatient with starting quarterback Kerry Collins, pulling him in favor of rookie quarterback Vince Young. Young drove the Titans to the Jets' 32-yard line, but underthrew receiver David Givens on the next play, and Andre Dyson intercepted. Pennington drove the Jets into the Titans' red zone, completing a 10-yard pass to Sean Ryan, but Ryan was hit hard by Keith Bulluck and fumbled, with Tennessee recovering. However, two plays later, the Jets would get the ball right back, as Collins, inserted back into the game, was intercepted by Dyson, his second of the quarter. Setting up shop at the Titans' 36-yard line, the Jets would capitalize, as Pennington threw an 8-yard touchdown pass to Jerricho Cotchery with 18 seconds left in the first half, but kicker Mike Nugent shanked the extra-point attempt wide right to leave the Jets with a 13-0 halftime lead. Tennessee's woes in the passing game continued as soon as the second half started, with Collins getting intercepted again, this time by Kerry Rhodes, who returned the ball 25 yards to the Tennessee 22. Nugent nailed an 18-yard field goal as the drive stalled at the one-yard line. On the Jets' next possession, Pennington drove to the red zone again, but Nugent missed a 34-yard field goal attempt wide right. On the Jets' next possession, Pennington appeared to find Cotchery on a 2-yard touchdown pass, but the touchdown was nullified by a holding penalty on D'Brickashaw Ferguson. When the drive stalled, Nugent missed another field goal, hitting the right upright from 30 yards out. Tennessee finally capitalized, with Travis Henry scoring on a 3-yard touchdown run with 10:48 left in the game. Tennessee went for two, and brought in Young. Young's pass intended for Bobby Wade was incomplete, but Jets defensive back Derrick Strait was flagged for pass interference, giving the Titans second life. They would take advantage, with Collins handing off to Henry for the conversion. After a trade of punts, the Jets took over on their own 11 with 7:28 to go. On third down, Pennington was sacked by Cortland Finnegan, and Tennessee's Randy Starks recovered at New York's 1-yard line. Tennessee went for two and converted, with Collins finding Drew Bennett open, and the game was tied, 16-16. The Jets came right back, first with Justin Miller returning the ensuing kickoff 41 yards, and then Pennington steadily driving downfield, finding Baker on the 12-yard touchdown pass to cap a 7-play, 57-yard drive. The Jets had to hold on because on the next possession, Collins found Bennett on a 26-yard completion moving the ball to midfield, and he then completed long passes to Ben Troupe and Wade to move the ball to the Jets' 12-yard line with 1:11 to play. The Jets locked down, and on 4th-and-6 from the Jets' 8-yard line, Collins' pass for Bo Scaife was knocked away by Rhodes, ending the game.\nQuestion: How many yards was the longest touchdown pass?\nAnswer:",

        "question": "Passage: In 1918, party membership was approximately 200,000. In the late 1920s under Stalin, the party engaged in an intensive recruitment campaign, the \"Lenin Levy\", resulting in new members referred to as the Lenin Enrolment, from both the working class and rural areas. This represented an attempt to \"proletarianize\" the party and an attempt by Stalin to strengthen his base by outnumbering the Old Bolsheviks and reducing their influence in the Party. In 1925, the party had 1,025,000 members in a Soviet population of 147 million. In 1927, membership had risen to 1,200,000. During the collectivization campaign and industrialization campaigns of the first five-year plan from 1929 to 1933, party membership grew rapidly to approximately 3.5 million members. However, party leaders suspected that the mass intake of new members had allowed \"social-alien elements\" to penetrate the partys ranks and document verifications of membership ensued in 1933 and 1935, removing supposedly unreliable members. Meanwhile, the party closed its ranks to new members from 1933 to November 1936. Even after the reopening of party recruiting, membership fell to 1.9 million by 1939. Nicholas DeWitt gives 2.307 million members in 1939, including candidate members, compared with 1.535 million in 1929 and 6.3 million in 1947. In 1986, the CPSU had over 19 million membersapproximately 10% of the Soviet Unions adult population. Over 44% of party members were classified as industrial workers and 12% as collective farmers. The CPSU had party organizations in 14 of the Soviet Unions 15 republics.

The lands adjoining towns and strongholds were captured by the rebels and the peasant uprising spread to the Bavarian Forest, parts of the Upper Palatinate and Kelheim on the Danube. A Braunau Parliament meeting was held in December 1705 in the then-Bavarian Braunau. Long before the French Revolution and early German parliamentarianism the meeting was held on 21 December 1705 in an inn belonging to the Baron von Paumgarten; representatives met of the four estates in Bavaria: aristocracy, clergy, burghers and peasants. The Braunau Parliament  is the name of the congress on the defence of the state of Bavaria held at Braunau am Inn convened on 21 December 1705. Following the initial uprising in November 1705, there was little response from the Austrians for nearly two months. However, that changed following an attempt by the rebels to capture the Bavarian capital, Munich. Following their unsuccessful attack, the night of 25 December 1705 saw an Austrian column encounter the peasant army near Sendling outside of Munich.  The battle was known as Sendling's Night of Murder  or the Sendling Christmas Day Massacre. The insurgents from the Bavarian Oberland were defeated and completely routed by Emperor Joseph I's troops. The number of deaths on the Bavarian side in this battle is estimated at around 1,100 men, but the Austrians lost only about 40. Some of the insurgents were killed after they had already surrendered.  About two weeks later, on 8 January 1706, the Battle of Aidenbach ended with the utter defeat of the insurgents and about 4,000 casualties on the Bavarian side.

        "question": "Passage: In the Morean War, the Republic of Venice besieged Sinj in October 1684 and then again March and April 1685, but both times without success. In the 1685 attempt, the Venetian armies were aided by the local militia of the Republic of Poljica, who thereby rebelled against their nominal Ottoman suzerainty that had existed since 1513. In an effort to retaliate to Poljica, in June 1685, the Ottomans attacked Zadvarje, and in July 1686 Dolac and Srijane, but were pushed back, and suffered major casualties. With the help of the local population of Poljica as well as the Morlachs, the fortress of Sinj finally fell to the Venetian army on 30 September 1686. On 1 September 1687 the siege of Herceg Novi started, and ended with a Venetian victory on 30 September. Knin was taken after a twelve-day siege on 11 September 1688. The capture of the Knin Fortress marked the end of the successful Venetian campaign to expand their territory in inland Dalmatia, and it also determined much of the final border between Dalmatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina that stands today. The Ottomans would besiege Sinj again in the Second Morean War, but would be repelled. On 26 November 1690, Venice took Vrgorac, which opened the route towards Imotski and Mostar. In 1694 they managed to take areas north of the Republic of Ragusa, namely Čitluk, Gabela, Zažablje, Trebinje, Popovo, Klobuk and Metković. In the final peace treaty, Venice did relinquish the areas of Popovo polje as well as Klek and Sutorina, to maintain the pre-existing demarcation near Ragusa.\nQuestion: How many areas were taken north of the Republic of Ragusa?\nAnswer:",

At the time, the Habsburg King Ferdinand I of Bohemia  immediately rejected the agreement; nevertheless, in 1675 the \"Great Elector\" Frederick William of Brandenburg laid claim to the Silesian principalities when, with the death of Duke George William of Liegnitz, the Piast line ended. In 1603, Hohenzollern Elector Joachim III Frederick of Brandenburg also inherited the Silesian Duchy of Jägerndorf from his cousin, Margrave George Frederick of Brandenburg-Ansbach. After the Bohemian Revolt and the outbreak of the Thirty Years' War, however, the Catholic Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand II confiscated the possessions of the Protestant Hohenzollerns in his Bohemian lands in 1621 after winning the Battle of White Mountain. The Electors of Brandenburg continued, nevertheless, to assert themselves as the legitimate rulers of Jägerndorf. Brandenburg, however, was unable to enforce these dynastic territorial claims. In 1685, when Austria was engaged in the Great Turkish War, Emperor Leopold I gave Elector Frederick William immediate control of the Silesian exclave of Schwiebus in return for military support against the Turks and the surrender of the outstanding Hohenzollern claims in Silesia. However, after the accession of the Elector's son and successor, Frederick III of Brandenburg, the Emperor took back control of Schwiebus in 1694, asserting that the territory had only been personally assigned to the late Frederick William for life. Furious, Frederick III in turn reasserted the old Hohenzollern claims to Jägerndorf and the Silesian Piast heritage.\nQuestion: How many years before Austria was engaged in the Great Turkish War was the battle of white mountain won?\nAnswer:",

In the late 1920s under Stalin, the party engaged in an intensive recruitment campaign, the \"Lenin Levy\", resulting in new members referred to as the Lenin Enrolment, from both the working class and rural areas. This represented an attempt to \"proletarianize\" the party and an attempt by Stalin to strengthen his base by outnumbering the Old Bolsheviks and reducing their influence in the Party. In 1925, the party had 1,025,000 members in a Soviet population of 147 million. In 1927, membership had risen to 1,200,000. During the collectivization campaign and industrialization campaigns of the first five-year plan from 1929 to 1933, party membership grew rapidly to approximately 3.5 million members. However, party leaders suspected that the mass intake of new members had allowed \"social-alien elements\" to penetrate the partys ranks and document verifications of membership ensued in 1933 and 1935, removing supposedly unreliable members. Meanwhile, the party closed its ranks to new members from 1933 to November 1936. Even after the reopening of party recruiting, membership fell to 1.9 million by 1939.

The lands adjoining towns and strongholds were captured by the rebels and the peasant uprising spread to the Bavarian Forest, parts of the Upper Palatinate and Kelheim on the Danube. A Braunau Parliament meeting was held in December 1705 in the then-Bavarian Braunau. Long before the French Revolution and early German parliamentarianism the meeting was held on 21 December 1705 in an inn belonging to the Baron von Paumgarten; representatives met of the four estates in Bavaria: aristocracy, clergy, burghers and peasants. The Braunau Parliament  is the name of the congress on the defence of the state of Bavaria held at Braunau am Inn convened on 21 December 1705. Following the initial uprising in November 1705, there was little response from the Austrians for nearly two months. However, that changed following an attempt by the rebels to capture the Bavarian capital, Munich. Following their unsuccessful attack, the night of 25 December 1705 saw an Austrian column encounter the peasant army near Sendling outside of Munich.  The battle was known as Sendling's Night of Murder  or the Sendling Christmas Day Massacre. The insurgents from the Bavarian Oberland were defeated and completely routed by Emperor Joseph I's troops. The number of deaths on the Bavarian side in this battle is estimated at around 1,100 men, but the Austrians lost only about 40. Some of the insurgents were killed after they had already surrendered.  About two weeks later, on 8 January 1706, the Battle of Aidenbach ended with the utter defeat of the insurgents and about 4,000 casualties on the Bavarian side.

        "question": "Passage: After the teams traded punts on the first four possessions of the game, Pennington led the Jets on a 9-play, 76-yard drive, aided by a pass-interference call on Titans linebacker Peter Sirmon that negated an interception by defensive back Reynaldo Hill, capped off by a 1-yard touchdown run from Kevan Barlow. After another Titans punt, Tennessee head coach Jeff Fisher grew impatient with starting quarterback Kerry Collins, pulling him in favor of rookie quarterback Vince Young. Young drove the Titans to the Jets' 32-yard line, but underthrew receiver David Givens on the next play, and Andre Dyson intercepted. Pennington drove the Jets into the Titans' red zone, completing a 10-yard pass to Sean Ryan, but Ryan was hit hard by Keith Bulluck and fumbled, with Tennessee recovering. However, two plays later, the Jets would get the ball right back, as Collins, inserted back into the game, was intercepted by Dyson, his second of the quarter. Setting up shop at the Titans' 36-yard line, the Jets would capitalize, as Pennington threw an 8-yard touchdown pass to Jerricho Cotchery with 18 seconds left in the first half, but kicker Mike Nugent shanked the extra-point attempt wide right to leave the Jets with a 13-0 halftime lead. Tennessee's woes in the passing game continued as soon as the second half started, with Collins getting intercepted again, this time by Kerry Rhodes, who returned the ball 25 yards to the Tennessee 22. Nugent nailed an 18-yard field goal as the drive stalled at the one-yard line. On the Jets' next possession, Pennington drove to the red zone again, but Nugent missed a 34-yard field goal attempt wide right. On the Jets' next possession, Pennington appeared to find Cotchery on a 2-yard touchdown pass, but the touchdown was nullified by a holding penalty on D'Brickashaw Ferguson. When the drive stalled, Nugent missed another field goal, hitting the right upright from 30 yards out. Tennessee finally capitalized, with Travis Henry scoring on a 3-yard touchdown run with 10:48 left in the game. Tennessee went for two, and brought in Young. Young's pass intended for Bobby Wade was incomplete, but Jets defensive back Derrick Strait was flagged for pass interference, giving the Titans second life. They would take advantage, with Collins handing off to Henry for the conversion. After a trade of punts, the Jets took over on their own 11 with 7:28 to go. On third down, Pennington was sacked by Cortland Finnegan, and Tennessee's Randy Starks recovered at New York's 1-yard line. Tennessee went for two and converted, with Collins finding Drew Bennett open, and the game was tied, 16-16. The Jets came right back, first with Justin Miller returning the ensuing kickoff 41 yards, and then Pennington steadily driving downfield, finding Baker on the 12-yard touchdown pass to cap a 7-play, 57-yard drive. The Jets had to hold on because on the next possession, Collins found Bennett on a 26-yard completion moving the ball to midfield, and he then completed long passes to Ben Troupe and Wade to move the ball to the Jets' 12-yard line with 1:11 to play. The Jets locked down, and on 4th-and-6 from the Jets' 8-yard line, Collins' pass for Bo Scaife was knocked away by Rhodes, ending the game.\nQuestion: How many yards was the longest touchdown pass?\nAnswer:",

In the late 1920s under Stalin, the party engaged in an intensive recruitment campaign, the \"Lenin Levy\", resulting in new members referred to as the Lenin Enrolment, from both the working class and rural areas. This represented an attempt to \"proletarianize\" the party and an attempt by Stalin to strengthen his base by outnumbering the Old Bolsheviks and reducing their influence in the Party. In 1925, the party had 1,025,000 members in a Soviet population of 147 million. In 1927, membership had risen to 1,200,000. During the collectivization campaign and industrialization campaigns of the first five-year plan from 1929 to 1933, party membership grew rapidly to approximately 3.5 million members. However, party leaders suspected that the mass intake of new members had allowed \"social-alien elements\" to penetrate the partys ranks and document verifications of membership ensued in 1933 and 1935, removing supposedly unreliable members. Meanwhile, the party closed its ranks to new members from 1933 to November 1936. Even after the reopening of party recruiting, membership fell to 1.9 million by 1939.

At the time, the Habsburg King Ferdinand I of Bohemia  immediately rejected the agreement; nevertheless, in 1675 the \"Great Elector\" Frederick William of Brandenburg laid claim to the Silesian principalities when, with the death of Duke George William of Liegnitz, the Piast line ended. In 1603, Hohenzollern Elector Joachim III Frederick of Brandenburg also inherited the Silesian Duchy of Jägerndorf from his cousin, Margrave George Frederick of Brandenburg-Ansbach. After the Bohemian Revolt and the outbreak of the Thirty Years' War, however, the Catholic Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand II confiscated the possessions of the Protestant Hohenzollerns in his Bohemian lands in 1621 after winning the Battle of White Mountain. The Electors of Brandenburg continued, nevertheless, to assert themselves as the legitimate rulers of Jägerndorf. Brandenburg, however, was unable to enforce these dynastic territorial claims. In 1685, when Austria was engaged in the Great Turkish War, Emperor Leopold I gave Elector Frederick William immediate control of the Silesian exclave of Schwiebus in return for military support against the Turks and the surrender of the outstanding Hohenzollern claims in Silesia. However, after the accession of the Elector's son and successor, Frederick III of Brandenburg, the Emperor took back control of Schwiebus in 1694, asserting that the territory had only been personally assigned to the late Frederick William for life. Furious, Frederick III in turn reasserted the old Hohenzollern claims to Jägerndorf and the Silesian Piast heritage.\nQuestion: How many years before Austria was engaged in the Great Turkish War was the battle of white mountain won?\nAnswer:",

The lands adjoining towns and strongholds were captured by the rebels and the peasant uprising spread to the Bavarian Forest, parts of the Upper Palatinate and Kelheim on the Danube. A Braunau Parliament meeting was held in December 1705 in the then-Bavarian Braunau. Long before the French Revolution and early German parliamentarianism the meeting was held on 21 December 1705 in an inn belonging to the Baron von Paumgarten; representatives met of the four estates in Bavaria: aristocracy, clergy, burghers and peasants. The Braunau Parliament  is the name of the congress on the defence of the state of Bavaria held at Braunau am Inn convened on 21 December 1705. Following the initial uprising in November 1705, there was little response from the Austrians for nearly two months. However, that changed following an attempt by the rebels to capture the Bavarian capital, Munich. Following their unsuccessful attack, the night of 25 December 1705 saw an Austrian column encounter the peasant army near Sendling outside of Munich.  The battle was known as Sendling's Night of Murder  or the Sendling Christmas Day Massacre. The insurgents from the Bavarian Oberland were defeated and completely routed by Emperor Joseph I's troops. The number of deaths on the Bavarian side in this battle is estimated at around 1,100 men, but the Austrians lost only about 40. Some of the insurgents were killed after they had already surrendered.

        "question": "Passage: Like most other European countries, Hungary is experiencing sub-replacement fertility; its estimated total fertility rate of 1.43 is well below the replacement rate of 2.1, albeit higher than its nadir of 1.28 in 1999. As a result, its population has gradually declining and rapidly aging. In 2011, the conservative government began a program to increase the birth rate with a focus on ethnic Magyars by reinstating 3 year maternity leave as well as boosting part-time jobs. The birth rate has gradually increased from 1.27 children born/woman in 2011. The natural decrease in the first 10 months of 2016 was only 25,828 which was 8,162 less than the corresponding period in 2015. In 2015, 47.9% of births were to unmarried women. Life expectancy was 71.96 years for men and 79.62 years for women in 2015, growing continuously since the End of Communism in Hungary (1989).\nQuestion: How many points lower was the fertility rate in 1999 in Hungary compared to what it is now experiencing?\nAnswer:",

Byron Leftwich then completed a short pass to Fred Taylor, who turned it into a 32-yard gain. Two plays later, Maurice Jones-Drew scored on a 6-yard touchdown run. After forcing a punt, Jacksonville wasted no time tacking onto their lead, with Leftwich completing passes to Reggie Williams and George Wrighster for long gains.

        "question": "Passage: In 1918, party membership was approximately 200,000. In the late 1920s under Stalin, the party engaged in an intensive recruitment campaign, the \"Lenin Levy\", resulting in new members referred to as the Lenin Enrolment, from both the working class and rural areas. This represented an attempt to \"proletarianize\" the party and an attempt by Stalin to strengthen his base by outnumbering the Old Bolsheviks and reducing their influence in the Party. In 1925, the party had 1,025,000 members in a Soviet population of 147 million. In 1927, membership had risen to 1,200,000. During the collectivization campaign and industrialization campaigns of the first five-year plan from 1929 to 1933, party membership grew rapidly to approximately 3.5 million members. However, party leaders suspected that the mass intake of new members had allowed \"social-alien elements\" to penetrate the partys ranks and document verifications of membership ensued in 1933 and 1935, removing supposedly unreliable members. Meanwhile, the party closed its ranks to new members from 1933 to November 1936. Even after the reopening of party recruiting, membership fell to 1.9 million by 1939. Nicholas DeWitt gives 2.307 million members in 1939, including candidate members, compared with 1.535 million in 1929 and 6.3 million in 1947. In 1986, the CPSU had over 19 million membersapproximately 10% of the Soviet Unions adult population. Over 44% of party members were classified as industrial workers and 12% as collective farmers. The CPSU had party organizations in 14 of the Soviet Unions 15 republics.

After another Titans punt, Tennessee head coach Jeff Fisher grew impatient with starting quarterback Kerry Collins, pulling him in favor of rookie quarterback Vince Young. Young drove the Titans to the Jets' 32-yard line, but underthrew receiver David Givens on the next play, and Andre Dyson intercepted. Pennington drove the Jets into the Titans' red zone, completing a 10-yard pass to Sean Ryan, but Ryan was hit hard by Keith Bulluck and fumbled, with Tennessee recovering. However, two plays later, the Jets would get the ball right back, as Collins, inserted back into the game, was intercepted by Dyson, his second of the quarter. Setting up shop at the Titans' 36-yard line, the Jets would capitalize, as Pennington threw an 8-yard touchdown pass to Jerricho Cotchery with 18 seconds left in the first half, but kicker Mike Nugent shanked the extra-point attempt wide right to leave the Jets with a 13-0 halftime lead. Tennessee's woes in the passing game continued as soon as the second half started, with Collins getting intercepted again, this time by Kerry Rhodes, who returned the ball 25 yards to the Tennessee 22. Nugent nailed an 18-yard field goal as the drive stalled at the one-yard line. On the Jets' next possession, Pennington drove to the red zone again, but Nugent missed a 34-yard field goal attempt wide right. On the Jets' next possession, Pennington appeared to find Cotchery on a 2-yard touchdown pass, but the touchdown was nullified by a holding penalty on D'Brickashaw Ferguson. When the drive stalled, Nugent missed another field goal, hitting the right upright from 30 yards out. Tennessee finally capitalized, with Travis Henry scoring on a 3-yard touchdown run with 10:48 left in the game. Tennessee went for two, and brought in Young. Young's pass intended for Bobby Wade was incomplete, but Jets defensive back Derrick Strait was flagged for pass interference, giving the Titans second life. They would take advantage, with Collins handing off to Henry for the conversion. After a trade of punts, the Jets took over on their own 11 with 7:28 to go. On third down, Pennington was sacked by Cortland Finnegan, and Tennessee's Randy Starks recovered at New York's 1-yard line. Tennessee went for two and converted, with Collins finding Drew Bennett open, and the game was tied, 16-16. The Jets came right back, first with Justin Miller returning the ensuing kickoff 41 yards, and then Pennington steadily driving downfield, finding Baker on the 12-yard touchdown pass to cap a 7-play, 57-yard drive. The Jets had to hold on because on the next possession, Collins found Bennett on a 26-yard completion moving the ball to midfield, and he then completed long passes to Ben Troupe and Wade to move the ball to the Jets' 12-yard line with 1:11 to play. The Jets locked down, and on 4th-and-6 from the Jets' 8-yard line, Collins' pass for Bo Scaife was knocked away by Rhodes, ending the game.\nQuestion: How many yards was the longest touchdown pass?\nAnswer:",

The lands adjoining towns and strongholds were captured by the rebels and the peasant uprising spread to the Bavarian Forest, parts of the Upper Palatinate and Kelheim on the Danube. A Braunau Parliament meeting was held in December 1705 in the then-Bavarian Braunau. Long before the French Revolution and early German parliamentarianism the meeting was held on 21 December 1705 in an inn belonging to the Baron von Paumgarten; representatives met of the four estates in Bavaria: aristocracy, clergy, burghers and peasants. The Braunau Parliament  is the name of the congress on the defence of the state of Bavaria held at Braunau am Inn convened on 21 December 1705. Following the initial uprising in November 1705, there was little response from the Austrians for nearly two months. However, that changed following an attempt by the rebels to capture the Bavarian capital, Munich. Following their unsuccessful attack, the night of 25 December 1705 saw an Austrian column encounter the peasant army near Sendling outside of Munich.  The battle was known as Sendling's Night of Murder  or the Sendling Christmas Day Massacre. The insurgents from the Bavarian Oberland were defeated and completely routed by Emperor Joseph I's troops. The number of deaths on the Bavarian side in this battle is estimated at around 1,100 men, but the Austrians lost only about 40. Some of the insurgents were killed after they had already surrendered.  About two weeks later, on 8 January 1706, the Battle of Aidenbach ended with the utter defeat of the insurgents and about 4,000 casualties on the Bavarian side.

        "question": "Passage: The country's economic transformation was far from complete. Political and financial crises in 1997, shattered the Czech Republic's image as one of the most stable and prosperous of post-Communist states. Delays in enterprise restructuring and failure to develop a well-functioning capital market played major roles in Czech economic troubles, which culminated in a currency crisis in May. The formerly pegged currency was forced into a floating system as investors sold their Korunas faster than the government could buy them. This followed a worldwide trend to divest from developing countries that year. Investors also worried the republic's economic transformation was far from complete. Another complicating factor was the current account deficit, which reached nearly 8% of GDP. In response to the crisis, two austerity packages were introduced later in the spring , which cut government spending by 2.5% of GDP. Growth dropped to 0.3% in 1997, −2.3% in 1998, and −0.5% in 1999. The government established a restructuring agency in 1999 and launched a revitalization program - to spur the sale of firms to foreign companies. Key priorities included accelerating legislative convergence with EU norms, restructuring enterprises, and privatising banks and utilities.

Philadelphia managed to draw close with McNabb completing an 8-yard touchdown pass to tight end L.J. Smith (with a failed 2-point conversion). In the fourth quarter, the Redskins padded its lead with Campbell completing a 6-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Keenan McCardell, yet the Eagles answered with McNabb's 45-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Reggie Brown. The Redskins tried to pull away as Suisham nailed a 21-yard field goal. However, Philadelphia sealed the win with Westbrook turning a 57-yard reception and a 10-yard run into touchdowns. With the loss, the Redskins fell to 5-4.

        "question": "Passage: Like most other European countries, Hungary is experiencing sub-replacement fertility; its estimated total fertility rate of 1.43 is well below the replacement rate of 2.1, albeit higher than its nadir of 1.28 in 1999. As a result, its population has gradually declining and rapidly aging. In 2011, the conservative government began a program to increase the birth rate with a focus on ethnic Magyars by reinstating 3 year maternity leave as well as boosting part-time jobs.

        "question": "Passage: The Eagles faced off with the Baltimore Ravens in an interconference matchup.  Both defenses dominated the first quarter, and in the second quarter, Baltimore forced three turnovers (two interceptions and a fumble) from Donovan McNabb.  Ravens kicker Matt Stover booted a 44-yard field goal, while quarterback Joe Flacco completed a 1-yard touchdown pass to tight end Daniel Wilcox.  However, rookie  Quintin Demps returned the following kickoff 100 yards for a Philadelphia touchdown to make it 10-7 Ravens at halftime.  Andy Reid decided to bench McNabb (who was 8-for-18 for 59 yards and two interceptions) and put backup quarterback Kevin Kolb into the game.  Kolb also struggled with the Baltimore defense, and the Eagles fell behind 12-7 when linebacker Jameel McClain blocked Sav Rocca's punt into the back of the endzone for a safety. In the fourth, the Ravens kicked another field goal after a Kolb interception, then Mark Clayton took a short slant 53-yards for a touchdown to make it 22-7.  Kolb drove Philadelphia to the Raven 1-yard line, but was intercepted in the end zone by Ed Reed, who returned the ball an NFL-record 108 yards for the touchdown.

        "question": "Passage: The Dutch East India Company  fleet from Batavia sailed at the end of 1620. The fleet consisted of 19 ships, 1,655 European troops and 286 Asian auxiliaries, and was led by Governor-General Jan Pieterszoon Coen. On 21 February 1621, The fleet arrived in Fort Nassau, where it was reinforced by the fort's 250-strong garrison and 36 indigenous vessels. After unsuccessfully trying to recruit Englishmen from the nearby Run and Ay islands, Coen began sending scouts to the coastline of Lontor, the main Bandanese island. The reconnaissance took two days, during which some boats came under cannon fire from the native defenders. The scouts found fortified positions along the Southern coast and in the hills and failed to find a possible beachhead. On 7 March, a VOC probing party landed in the island but was repulsed after suffering one dead and four wounded. On 11 March he ordered a decisive assault. He divided his forces into several groups, which attacked different points in the island. The invaders swiftly captured key strongholds, and by the end of the day the island's northern lowlands and southern promontories. The defenders and local population fled to the hills that made up the island's center, with the Dutch forces in pursuit. By the end of 12 March, the Dutch occupied the whole island, suffering six dead and 27 wounded.\nQuestion: How many days after a decisive assault ordered did it take for the Dutch to occupy the whole island?\nAnswer:",
