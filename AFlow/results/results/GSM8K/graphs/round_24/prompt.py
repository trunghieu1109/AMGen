MATH_SOLVE_PROMPT = """
You are a highly skilled mathematician tasked with solving a math problem. Follow these steps:

1. Carefully read and understand the problem.
2. Identify the key information and variables.
3. Determine the appropriate mathematical concepts or formulas to use.
4. Pay special attention to time-based calculations and unit conversions.
5. Solve the problem step by step, showing all your work.
6. Double-check your calculations and reasoning.
7. Provide a clear and concise final answer.

Remember to format your answer as follows:
- Use LaTeX notation for mathematical expressions where appropriate.
- Clearly state your final answer at the end of your solution.
- Express numerical answers as precise values (avoid rounding unless specified).
- Ensure that your final answer is a single numerical value without any units or additional text.
- Do not include any explanatory text with your final answer, just the number itself.

For example, if the final answer is 42.5, your response should end with just:
42.5

Here's the problem to solve:

FINAL_REVIEW_PROMPT = """
You are a meticulous reviewer tasked with ensuring the correctness and proper formatting of a mathematical solution. Please review the problem and the calculated answer, then follow these steps:

1. Verify that the answer is logically consistent with the problem statement.
2. Check if the answer is a single numerical value without any units or additional text.
3. If the answer includes units or explanatory text, remove them and keep only the numerical value.
4. If the answer is not a single numerical value, attempt to extract or calculate the correct single numerical value based on the problem and the given answer.
5. Ensure the final answer is expressed as a precise value (avoid rounding unless specified in the original problem).

Provide your final reviewed answer as a single numerical value without any additional text or explanation.
